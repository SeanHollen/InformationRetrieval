<HEAD>Drifter Found Guilty In Slayings Of Three Indian Women</HEAD>

   A drifter who sometimes posed as an American
Indian was convicted Friday of murdering and sexually mutilating
three Indian women and sentenced to life in prison.
   ``I'm not the serial killer,'' Billy Glaze, 45, told Hennepin
County Judge Jonathan Lebedoff after the jury found him quilty.
   But the judge said he wasn't swayed by Glaze's denial and
sentenced him to three life sentences in prison to be served
consecutively.
   ``I have no reason to dispute the legitimacy of the findings of
the jury,'' Lebedoff said. He described the jury as ``extremely
conscientious.''
   ``The horrors that we've been privy to over the last few weeks
cannot be undone by any sentence. There's nothing I can do to turn
back the clock,'' Lebedoff said.
   Glaze was convicted of three counts of first-degree murder and
three counts of second-degree murder in the slayings of Kathleen
Bullman, 19, Angeline Whitebird-Sweet, 26, and Angela Green, 21, in
1986 and 1987. Police believe the women met their killer in taverns.
   Glaze said he had no complaint with the jury. But he disputed the
testimony of ``the witness that got up there and lied. I never wore
no bandana. I never went into a bar and said those things about
Indian women.''
   ``I'm just not the serial killer, but you do what you have to,''
he told the judge.
   Noting that Minnesota does not have a death sentence, Lebedoff
said it was his ``strong wish that you serve the rest of your life
in prison.''
   Deliberations began Tuesday after a two-week trial.
   Assistant Hennepin County Attorney Pete Connors said in his
closing statement that Glaze's motive was that he hated Indian
women. ``He had a fury in his gut; he wanted to hurt them badly. He
told people that.''
   But Glaze's attorney, Michael Colich, said the state had failed
to prove that Glaze killed anyone. Glaze did not testify.
   Colich characterized Glaze as a non-violent drifter who called
attention to himself by saying despicable things about women. He
said police were not thorough in their investigation of other
suspects because of public pressure to solve the killings. Glaze was
indicted last June.
   Glaze is believed to have left Minneapolis around May 1, 1987. He
was arrested later that month on a drunken driving charge in New
Mexico. Albuquerque police contacted Minneapolis authorities when
they learned Glaze was sought for questioning in the three killings.
   Glaze once told a television reporter that he had claimed to be
an Indian because their culture fascinated him, and federal
authorities said he used aliases including Jesse Settingcrow and
Jesse Sitting Crow.

   Fire swept through a historic hotel
Friday, killing one person and injuring 14 others, as freezing
temperatures forced firefighters to draw water from a canal a half
mile away.
   The fire broke out about 4 a.m. in the Wall Block Inn, where
about 50 people lived, authorities said.
   More than 200 firefighters responded to the fire before it was
declared under control at about 7:40 a.m., said Sue Pinkham, a
spokeswoman for the county Emergency Services Department.
   State Police fire marshal John Pflantz said he did not know the
identity of the victim.
   ``There is no reason to believe there are any more (bodies), but
we will continue to look,'' Pflantz said.
   The cause of the fire, which started on the second floor of the
three-story residential hotel, was under investigation, Pflantz
said. A previous fire at the hotel in 1978 had an electrical origin.
   Firefighters stretched hoses 2,600 feet from the Montclair Canal
of the Schuylkill River because cold temperatures slowed the water
flowing through water mains, Mrs. Pinkham said. The hoses forced the
closing of Route 29 in this Philadelphia suburb, she said.
   One man was in critical condition in a Philadelphia hospital. Two
people were admitted to Phoenixville Hospital, and 11 others were
released after treatment for minor injuries.
   The hotel, built in 1905, is listed on the National Register of
Historic Places as a significant part of a historic district, said
Jane L.S. Davidson, county historic preservation officer.

<HEAD>Democrats React Warily to Bush Budget Message</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Edits throughout to raise higher some GOP comment</HEAD>

   Congressional Democrats reacted warily Thursday
as President Bush began to spell out a budget based on his campaign
promises, criticizing him for vagueness and vowing to reject any tax
changes that favor the wealthy. But predictably, Republican praised
Bush's speech.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, invited Bush's budget
officials to Capitol Hill for consultations next week, and said ``we
are ready to meet with President Bush any time he wishes and seek
common solutions.''
   But Wright signaled that certain things would be off the table,
such as cuts in Medicare and tax changes favoring upper-income
taxpayers. And he put the onus on Bush to address homelessness, the
trade deficit, the war on drugs and poor math and science scores
among U.S. students, all of which he portrayed as legacies of the
Reagan administration. ``America can do better than that,'' Wright
said.
   Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said Bush had extended a
cooperative hand to Capitol Hill. ``Congress can swat it away, or it
can grasp the President's hand in the true spirit of cooperation,''
he said. He called Bush's plan was ``not the final answer, it's a
starting point.''
   Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, the senior Republican on the
House Budget Committee, said Bush's budget was ``faithful to the
campaign pledges'' he made last year, although Frenzel predicted
that advocates of education, the environment, day care and aid to
the homeless would complain that they got less than was needed.
   ``The Bush budget is a tough one giving first priority to deficit
reduction,'' Frenzel said in a statement. ``It will be subject to
lots of negotiation, but it is an important step toward a deficit
solution.''
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., welcomed
Bush's emphasis on what he termed neglected social programs, but
added: ``Unfortunately, President Bush gave us a minimum down
payment on his `kinder, gentler America,' with no clear indication
of how he intends to make the necessary annual payments.''
   Bush continued the Reagan administration's practice of using
unrealistic economic assumptions to pretend that the deficit is
smaller, Sasser charged. And the president painted an optimistic
picture, but ``shunned the responsibility for telling us what the
sacrifices will be and who will make them,'' he said.
   ``Overall, the Bush budget outline does not meet the rigorous
economic demands of this moment in America's history,'' said Sasser.
``It gives the illusion of deficit reduction without decisively
addressing the deficit problem.''
   Wright, too, hinted that he would look to the administration for
more than small symbolic steps to fulfill promises to protect the
environment, aid education and fight drugs.
   ``We know, and you know that these goals cannot be achieved by
words alone, or by symbolic gestures,'' Wright said in a Democratic
counterpoint to Bush's nationally televised budget speech. ``They
require money.''
   In his remarks, Wright pointed to some Democratic priorities for
the year, including an increase in the minimum wage, employer-paid
health insurance for all workers, boosting the share of cleanup
costs paid by polluters and reining in the wave of leveraged
corporate buyouts.
   Earlier, in a speech at the National Press Club, House Ways and
Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., promised to fight
Bush's call for a cut in the tax rate on capital gains to 15
percent, reflecting the views of many Democrats that such a break
unfairly favors the rich.
   ``I'm not about to tell the wage earners in Chicago that they
should pay a higher tax than stockbrokers,'' Rostenkowski said.
   Wright, for his part, said, ``We would have to reject any kind of
`flexible freeze' that would bend with flexibility for the rich and
powerful but freeze out the middle income families of America.''
   But both Wright and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, who shared the
stage for the Democrats' televised response, avoided any sharp
disagreements with Bush on specific programs. ``We want to give him
a chance to be heard,'' Wright said.
   But some Republicans were almost as wary as the Democrats. ``It's
not immediately apparent how all those initiatives are going to be
paid for, even with the defense freeze,'' said Sen. Gordon J.
Humphrey, R-N.H.
   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said
while Bush's call for cooperation was welcome, he left many
questions unanswered.
   ``Many of the tough choices on deficit reduction were put off for
another day,'' he said, adding that he and Sasser would meet with
Bush Budget Director Richard Darman next week to quiz him about
budget specifics.
   In his response, Bentsen echoed the theme of his losing 1988
campaign for vice president, saying Democrats ``will be guided by a
set of enduring values. At the top of that list is good jobs at good
pay.''
   And he picked up Bush's competitiveness theme, noting that
American workers are no longer the best paid in the world and that
the nation is suffering from technological competition from its
allies.
   ``It's all very well to say, `read my lips,''' Bentsen said in a
reference to Bush's oft-quoted anti-tax pledge. ``Japanese computer
companies tell customers: `Read my chips.' It's effective. Even the
Pentagon buys Japanese microchips.''

<HEAD>Appeals Court Allows Husband To Authorize Abortion For His Comatose
Wife</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 12 grafs to UPDATE with comment from husband after
learning of stay, further comment from attorney and hospital confirming
stay. Picks up 9th graf pvs, `Mrs. Klein...'.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A state appeals court Thursday ruled the husband
of a comatose pregnant woman can become her legal guardian so he can
authorize an abortion that doctors say could help her recover.
   But hours later, an attorney for two anti-abortion activists said
he obtained a stay from the Court of Appeals, the state's highest
court, blocking Martin Klein from becoming the guardian of his
32-year-old wife, Nancy.
   Their action evoked an impassioned plea from Klein last Thursday.
   ``I'm begging the American people to please help us,'' he said by
telephone from the couple's home in the Long Island suburub of Upper
Brookville.
   ``Our family is beaten down. We're torn up. These strangers have
come off the street and are intruding in our lives. We don't know
what to do about it.''
   Klein was awarded the guardianship Tuesday in a state trial
court, but that decision was stayed pending the outcome of the first
appeal. The Appellate Division of the state trial court Thursday
dismissed requests by the two anti-abortion activists to be
appointed guardians of Mrs. Klein.
   Before the stay was granted, Klein said he was relieved and
pleased with the appeals court decicsion.
   ``I hope this will be the end of it now,'' he said.
   In rejecting the first appeal, the five-judge appeals panel said
the record confirms that ``these absolute strangers to the Klein
family, whatever their motivation, have no place in the midst of
this family tragedy.''
   But John Short and John Broderick, who filed the appeal, said
they would take the case to the Court of Appeals.
   ``It would be a tragedy if they go through with that abortion,''
Short, founder of the Long Island Right-To-Life Committee, said by
telephone.
   Late Thursday, A. Lawrence Washburn, Broderick's attorney, said
he had obtained a temporary stay from the Court of Appeals in
Albany. He said no hearing was immediately scheduled. He said the
appeal had been filed before Thursday's ruling, and the temporary
stay obtained by telephone.
   Mrs. Klein, who is approximately 17 weeks pregnant, has been in a
coma at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset since a Dec. 13
car accident. Hospital spokeswoman Alice Siegel said the hospital
had confirmed the temporary stay with the Court of Appeals.
   She is severely brain damaged and is given a slight chance at
recovery. Klein sought an abortion for his wife after he said some
physicians advised him that an abortion may enhance her recovery and
could save her life. The couple has a 3-year-old daughter.
   In testimony before the appeals court, five medical experts said
that pregnancy increased the risks for the comatose patient and
could possibly threaten her life. But two medical experts testified
the pregnancy was not life-threatening.
   The appeals court said Klein ``was fully capable of handling his
wife's affairs ... And while medical opinion may be divided, the
record indicates that he intends to act with the full support of
Mrs. Klein's parents in such a manner so as to enhance his wife's
chances of recovery.''
   In the lower court ruling, Judge Bernard McCaffrey said that ``as
of this time an abortion is not medically necessary'' to save Mrs.
Klein's life.
   But McCaffrey said the issue before the court was Mrs. Klein's
constitutional rights. If she were competent, he said, she would
have the absolute right to an abortion up to the 24th week of
pregnancy.

   Police and paramedics should be wary of AIDS,
treating any body fluids they can't be sure of as dangerous,
according to new congressionally mandated recommendations from
federal health authorities.
   A 45-page report from the Centers for Disease Control contains
tips for emergency medical technicians, paramedics, firefighters,
police officers and prison guards to avoid the virus that causes
AIDS.
   Blood, the CDC report stresses, ``is the single most important
source of HIV (AIDS virus) ... in the workplace setting.'' And while
AIDS transmission has not been documented through urine or sweat,
for example, other bodily fluids also can carry the virus.
   The CDC noted that the ``unpredictable'' circumstances faced by
emergency workers ``may make differentiation between hazardous body
fluids and those which are not hazardous very difficult and often
impossible.''
   ``Therefore, when emergency medical and public-safety workers
encounter body fluids under uncontrolled, emergency circumstances
... they should treat all body fluids as potentially hazardous.''
   The CDC recommends a wide range of precautions for various
occupations and settings: masks, goggles, gloves and gowns when
handling a patient or prisoner who is bleeding badly; but nothing
more than disposable gloves for workers placing intravenous lines in
patients.
   Officials of the CDC and the National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health learned from meeting with paramedics, police
officers and other personnel to discuss the recommendations, said
Phil Strine, an AIDS specialist with NIOSH in Atlanta.
   ``We knew EMTs (emergency medical technicians) saw a lot of blood
and body fluids,'' he said. ``What we didn't really realize before
was how uncontrolled their environment is. When it's 3 a.m. and it's
raining and you're pulling people out of a car, you don't have time
to tell what the fluid you see is.''
   The CDC report, released this week, also recommends special masks
for use by workers giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, although no
AIDS cases have been traced to the procedure and ``the potential for
salivary transmission ... is remote,'' the agency said.
   The CDC noted that 169 health-care workers in this country have
acquired AIDS with no other explainable risk factors. The deadly
disease chiefly strikes homosexual or bisexual men and intravenous
drug users.
   Detailed information is available for 44 of those cases, and they
include nurses or nursing assistants, doctors, lab technicians, a
dentist and a paramedic.
   Three law enforcement officers also have similar cases.
   Follow-up investigations of the police and paramedic cases
``could not determine conclusively'' if their AIDS infections were
job-related, the CDC reported.
   A number of cases have been reported previously in which doctors,
nurses or other health-care workers have been infected with AIDS
following needle-sticks, cuts or other injuries while working with
AIDS patients.
   To prevent needle-sticks, the CDC recommended that needles should
not be recapped, purposely bent, broken by hand or removed from
disposable syringes by hand, and should be disposed in
puncture-resistant containers.
   Many of the CDC's precautionary recommendations, such as the use
of gloves and masks in certain situations, were included in AIDS
precautions the agency released for health care workers more than
three years ago. Those recommendations urge that all medical
patients be ``assumed to be infectious'' to guard against
transmission of disease.
   But ``the way that specific occupational groups or situations are
addressed (in the new report) is different from anything we've had
in the past,'' Strine said.
   AIDS has now struck 85,590 people in the United States, killing
48,957 of them so far.

   Less than four years ago, Donald Johnson was cited
for heroism after he rescued a family from a fire. Last week, police
fatally shot the teen-ager after he took a Greyhound bus for a joy
ride.
   Police maintain they shot at the bus, killing Johnson, because he
was endangering the lives of others by refusing to stop driving
erratically through a Boston neighborhood late at night. And city
officials, in preliminary findings, say the shooting was justified.
   But his mother, Betty Johnson, a longtime community activist, and
other black leaders claim that police overreacted, shooting someone
who was unarmed and had no criminal background.
   ``This means a black kid's life in Boston doesn't mean very
much,'' said the Rev. Graylan Ellis-Hagler, a minister in the mostly
black neighborhood of Roxbury. ``Police don't hesitate to use deadly
force against kids of color.''
   Mrs. Johnson, 48, is unable to explain why her son, a junior in
high school who turned 19 the day before he died, took the bus on
Jan. 31.
   She was further embittered by the fact that she was not notified
by police about her son's death, learning about it from a newspaper
the next morning. The Boston Herald ran an Associated Press
photograph of her son taken at the scene. The newspaper said the
teen-ager had not been identified.
   Police spokesman James Jordan on Thursday said police did not
know who Johnson was until his mother, having seen the picture in
the newspaper, went to the city morgue and identified him.
   Mrs. Johnson said she remembers her son as a ``boy with a heart
of gold,'' a Boy Scout who worked with her on community projects and
was active in youth anti-drug work.
   ``Donald wasn't on drugs. He wasn't a drinker,'' said Mrs.
Johnson. ``I'm not saying he wasn't wrong in what he did. I'm saying
he wasn't out to hurt anybody.
   ``If police had given him half a chance, he would have come home
to me in the bus and I could have gotten him out of there.''
   Certificates attesting to Donald's community work sit on a shelf
surrounded by the plaque he received in 1985 for rescuing a mother
and her three children in a fire in suburban Winchester. He and a
friend were out selling candy when they spotted the blaze and led
the family to safety.
   Family and friends said Johnson wanted to be a bus driver and
called him a dreamer.
   Police said Johnson stole a Greyhound bus in Providence, R.I.,
and drove it 50 miles to Boston.
   Officers spotted the bus in the Chinatown section of the city
about 10:25 p.m. A chase ensued through urban neighborhoods,
reaching 40 mph on small side streets. He was apparently heading to
his mother's home.
   As the chase neared an end, the bus hit several cars and struck a
garage before stopping before a vacant house on a dead-end street.
   Police say officers approached the bus when it suddenly leaped
forward, ramming into the house. The driver then threw the bus into
reverse, hitting several police cruisers. No officers were injured.
   About five officers opened fire at the bus as it backed out of
the street, rounded the corner and came to a stop nearby. Johnson
was pronounced dead from a gunshot wound, authorities said.
   A group led by Ellis-Hagler is conducting an independent
investigation of the shooting, and says Johnson was wounded twice,
not once as authorities said.
   Separate investigations are being conducted by the Suffolk County
district attorney's office, police and the Metropolitan District
Commission, whose police force also was involved in the chase. Still
being determined, officials said, are which officer fired the fatal
shot and whether Johnson had drugs or alcohol in his system at the
time of the chase.
   But in preliminary comments, Mayor Raymond Flynn, who had posed
proudly with Johnson after the fire rescue in 1985, backed the
officers.
   ``Under the circumstances, the law required that the police take
some action to protect themselves and the public,'' Flynn said last
week. ``I don't think it is fair to jump all over the police every
time they go out and do their job.''
   First Assistant District Attorney Paul K. Leary said a day after
the shooting that his preliminary investigation showed it appeared
to be justified. Ellis-Hagler disagrees.
   ``It wasn't something to die for,'' he said. ``To spend all that
time and energy chasing a Greyhound bus with all the drugs and the
gang activity around here is such a waste.''

   A posh retreat laid out more than 800 years ago
for emperors awaits President and Mrs. Bush when they come to China
Feb. 25. The guesthouse has 26 rooms in its two stories and costs
$20,000 a night for regular guests.
   An electric massage chair and whirlpool bath is in the main
bedroom.
   The Diaoyutai State Guesthouse stands almost as a contradiction
to the austerity of today's China.
   ``Yes, we are socialist,'' explains Sun Guotong, one of the
officials who run the place, ``but for heads of state you must have
such things.''
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union will stay
there when he visits in May. So will Prince Charles and Princess
Diana when they come in November.
   The 26-room guesthouse on the complex, simply called No. 18, was
remodeled for Queen Elizabeth II when she visited Beijing in 1986.
   The Chinese government pays the bill for official and state
guests such as these, but others have to come up with $20,000 a
night.
   Diaoyutai, which means ``fishing terrace,'' sits on 100 acres of
pine groves where peacocks wander and swans grace a pond.
   The complex is made up of 15 large guest villas. No. 18 is the
most sumptuous.
   From its gold-plated bathroom fixtures and silk-covered walls to
its displays of ancient bronzeware and gold cloisonne, the villa
radiates luxury and elitism in a grubby, gray city where
egalitarianism so lately was in style.
   But ideology seems to stop at the gates to Diaoyutai. Even during
the extreme leftist Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, Chairman Mao
Tse-tung's wife, Jiang Qing, relaxed in villa No. 17 by watching
Western movies.
   China's shifting foreign policy can be charted, however, from the
guest list. In 1959, when the separate villas were built, most of
the guests were communist comrades.
   Now, Director Cheng Shaoliang said, most guests are Americans and
Japanese.
   The Vietnamese revolutionary Ho Chi Minh, Soviet leader Nikita S.
Khrushchev, President Francois Mitterrand of France and Presidents
Richard M. Nixon, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan were among the
parade of world leaders who stayed at Diaoyutai.
   ``Other hotels in Beijing may be more convenient _ guests can
come and go more freely,'' Cheng said in a recent interview. ``But
we offer quiet and security they can't match.''
   Diaoyutai's telephone operators are ordered not to connect calls
to guests if the caller doesn't know their room number. The police
who stand at attention at the compound's gates admit only cars whose
license plates have been cleared in advance.
   For the guests, however, almost anything is possible. Cheng tells
a story of a guest years ago who wanted water chestnuts during the
winter, when they were out of season. The guesthouse sent Peoples'
Liberation Army soldiers to a nearby lake to cut through the ice and
try to find some, he said.
   ``Now we wouldn't do that,'' Cheng said. But almost. Diaoyutai
sends its own trucks to the coast to pick up fresh shrimp and has
special ingredients flown in from all over the country.
   It pays 1,000 yuan ($270) a pound for a rare herb necessary for a
special scallop soup.
   ``Hotels won't do that,'' Cheng said.
   With that kind of overhead, rates start surprisingly low at $140
a night for a standard room. Presidential suites cost $500 a night.
   But the fanciest villas, No. 12 and No. 18, must be rented in
their entirety for $20,000 a night.
   Among other recent users of No. 18 were Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi of India and Armand Hammer, the American industrialist.
   Prince Charles and Princess Diana are booked for Nov. 1.
   No. 18's presidential suite includes separate his-and-her
bedrooms and bathrooms, each thickly carpeted and decorated with

   To help cover its annual 28-million-yuan ($7.5-million) budget,
Diaoyutai began selectively accepting non-VIP tourists and
businessmen in 1980 and opened a club for locally based foreign
businessmen last year.
   But non-VIPs need connections to get a room reservation.
   ``People can't come in off the street,'' said Sun Guotong,
Cheng's deputy.
   The club, with a $40,000 membership fee, also is intended only
for ``the leading people,'' Sun said.
   ``If a lot of people come, the air is not so fresh,'' he added,
while walking through the deserted exercise room, three-lane bowling
alley and billiards room. The indoor swimming pool is only four feet
deep _ ``very safe'' for visiting leaders, Sun said.
   He paused in front of a green felt-covered table used for playing
the Chinese tile game of mahjong and pushed back the pieces to
reveal a mechanism that automatically lines up tiles for each new
game.
   Mahjong in China is practically synonymous with gambling, which
is illegal. Do guests gamble?
   ``I don't know,'' Sun said diplomatically.

<HEAD>Court Fines Artist Who Made Earrings From Human Fetuses</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Some readers may find the following objectionable.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An artist who designed a pair of earrings made from
freeze-dried human fetuses has been fined by a court that ruled the
earrings violated public decency.
   The court Thursday also fined the curator of an art gallery where
the earrings were displayed.
   A defense lawyer said the earrings were meant to denounce
abortion, but a judge said they were offensive.
   The case centered on earrings made from two freeze-dried fetuses
that were attached to the ears of a female dummy and displayed in a
glass case in December 1987.
   Police raided London's Young Unknowns Gallery the day the item
went on display. The case aroused heated debate in artistic circles,
where it was viewed as a test of cultural tolerance in Britain.
   Judge Brian Smedley said he accepted that artist Rick Gibson, a
Canadian living in London, and gallery curator Peter Sylveire were
sincere in their motives.
   But, he added, ``In any civilized society, there has to be a
constraint on freedom to act in a way which has an adverse effect on
other members of the society in which we live.
   ``There are some things which, although in your view have
artistic merit, are nonetheless so offensive that the public simply
will not tolerate their exhibition,'' Smedley said.
   Gibson, 37, obtained the 3- to 4-month-old fetuses from a London
college professor, according to court testimony.
   Geoffrey Robertson, Sylveire's attorney, said the work was a
``profoundly moral'' comment on a society that allows abortions to
destroy tens of thousands of fetuses every year and tolerates animal
furs as acceptable attire.
   Smedley told the jury it was not to judge the work's artistic
merit. ``You are here to set the standards of public decency,'' he
said.
   After deliberating for five hours, the jury voted 10-2 to convict
on charges of outrage to public decency. Gibson was fined $875 and
Sylveire, 43, was fined $610.

<HEAD>Driver Gets Probation In Hit-And-Run Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A motorist who eluded authorities
for 2{ years using attorney-client privilege has been sentenced to
30 months probation in the hit-and-run death of a 28-year-old man.
   William D. Morser, 55, was also ordered Thursday to surrender his
driver's license for 18 months and perform 500 hours of community
service for leaving the scene of the accident that killed Mark
Baltes on March 9, 1986.
   The victim's mother was hoping for a stiffer sentence for Morser,
who said he failed to stop after running over Baltes' prone body on
South Ocean Boulevard in Palm Beach because he thought it was a pile
of rags.
   ``This man has no remorse. He took a human life. I feel he should
be punished through the penal system of the court,'' Mildred Baltes
of Middletown, N.Y., said after the ruling by Palm Beach Circuit
Judge Thomas Sholtz.
   Morser, a Delray Beach restaurateur, changed his plea from
innocent to no contest Thursday in order to put an end to the highly
publicized case, his attorney Barry Krischer said.
   Morser, who still faces a $6 million civil lawsuit by Baltes'
family, had faced a maximum sentence of one year in jail under state
guidelines.
   The case drew national attention when it was learned that the
driver of the hit-and-run vehicle had hired a lawyer the day after
the accident. Krischer refused to disclose his client's name, citing
the attorney-client privilege of confidentiality.
   Investigators first suspected Morser on Nov. 3, 1988, after
inspecting his white Buick Riviera, which resembled the car that
struck Baltes.
   Morser came forward two days later, identifying himself as the
driver. Under the terms of the subpoena issued to compel him to talk
about the case, Morser was given immunity in exchange for a
confession.
   Morser has denied he was at fault in the accident, blaming Baltes
for being in the road in the middle of the night. Tests showed
Baltes had a blood alcohol level of 0.26 percent, more than 2{ times
the legal limit in Florida.
   Morser said he didn't realize he had hit a person until he read a
newspaper the next day. After learning a man had been killed, he
decided to seek a lawyer's advice.
   In the ensuing months, Krischer refused to disclose his client's
identification despite the lawsuit brought by Baltes' parents.

   Retailers on the second-costliest shopping street
in the world carried on with their accustomed snobbery, hoisting a
nose at news they've been supplanted for the top spot.
   ``We get the cream of the world coming to this street,'' said
Michael Bishop, manager of Burberry's, a British clothier at 9 E.
57th in midtown Manhattan. ``The Ginza may have a higher price, but
there's no comparison in clientele.''
   The Ginza, in Tokyo, demolished East 57th Street in the latest
survey of retail rents, scoring an astronomical average of $650 per
square foot per year. East 57th, the leader last year, was second at
$435 per square foot.
   ``They are taking over,'' said a horrified saleswoman at Guy
Laroche, a dress shop on East 57th between Park and Madison.
   But others interviewed on Thursday took the news in stride.
   At Giorgio Beverly Hills, a boutique at No. 47, manager Randall
Hemming purred his standard customer greeting _ ``Would you like a
martini?'' _ and extolled his store's location.
   ``The whole reason for being here is prestige,'' he said. ``If
you look at the shops on 57th from Fifth to Park, you're looking at
the entire world.''
   At least, a select slice of it. Store windows, starting with a
glittering bang at Tiffany's on the corner of Fifth Avenue, boast a
mind-boggling array of jewel encrustments, haute couture, master
artworks and fine antiques.
   Inside any door, the ambience is genteel in the extreme. Floors
are thickly carpeted, rooms tastefully furnished. Salespeople hover
discreetly, often far outnumbering the shoppers. Cash registers
operate soundlessly.
   You can drop $65 for a tie at Chanel, $120 for a wool scarf at
Burberry's, $900 for a cashmere running suit at Giorgio. At
Ackermann Galleries, packed with 18th-century English furniture,
things are a bit more dear.
   ``A single piece here may go for 24 or 25. While not a lot of
people come in off the street, one designer can spend 100 pretty
easily,'' said salesman John Vlachos. He was talking thousands.
   The serene Ackermann's, though, is a relic of bygone days on 57th
Street, where antique shops and fine art galleries reigned for
decades. ``There are so few of us left,'' sighed Vlachos. ``The
rents have killed people.''
   Bishop, at Burberry's, didn't want to discuss his rent. He did
want to discuss his space _ four floors, 1,500 square feet each; his
staff _ 25 salespeople and a stable of Italian-trained tailors; and
his merchandise.
   ``The Japanese customer shops more in here than he does in the
Ginza. They have a love affair with our quality goods,'' he said. In
the Ginza, he didn't mind adding, the shops are small and the
street's in a perpetual traffic jam.
   ``In the Ginza, it's unbelievable. There's no room,'' Bishop
said. ``If Japan was a bigger island, then it would be a different
story.''

   A year after she took over Arizona's top job from
Evan Mecham, Gov. Rose Mofford says she has brought ``stability'' to
the state and plans to run for a full term, but some critics suggest
she's in over her head.
   The 66-year-old Democrat, who often refers to herself as
Arizona's mother and is instantly recognized by her beehive hairdo,
has found it tough adjusting from the popularity that went with her
largely ceremonial position of secretary of state to the controversy
that goes with being chief executive.
   She has tried to quiet those voices with such bold proposals as
$255 million in new taxes to balance a $3.35 billion budget, on top
of the $180 million tax increase she approved last summer. She also
has stood up to controversy by vetoing measures approved by
lawmakers.
   Mrs. Mofford became acting governor when Mecham, the first-term
Republican elected to the post in 1986, was impeached a year ago
this week. He was convicted and removed from office in April, and
she became governor.
   Mrs. Mofford's supporters attribute what they acknowledge as her
slow start to that turmoil.
   ``They sort of hit the ground without any time to get
organized,'' said Bill Jamieson, a former Cabinet chief to
Democratic Gov. Bruce Babbitt, Mecham's predecessor. ``It's like
changing the tires of a truck while it's still going down the
highway.''
   But others see deeper problems, saying Mrs. Mofford lacks
self-confidence and is hurting herself by her reluctance to explain
herself to lawmakers, the news media and the public.
   ``I don't have a theory on what is bedeviling this
administration, but clearly, at this point, it cannot be labeled a
smashing success,'' said Jack LaSota, a former state attorney
general and Babbitt chief of staff.
   ``She's in way over her head,'' said Republican Senate President
Robert Usdane.
   ``Rose's problem is that she is so unsure of herself,'' said Rep.
Peter Goudinoff, a Tucson Democrat and professor of political
science at the University of Arizona.
   Still, Goudinoff said he sees government moving forward after
years of inertia in during the lame-duck period of the Babbitt
adminstration and Mecham's crippled, shortened term.
   Mrs. Mofford and top aides declined to be interviewed about the
first year and what comes next, but she said Monday that her major
accomplishments have been ``the staff I was able to assemble and the
appointments I have made.''
   ``I think stability has been brought back to the state,'' she
added. She plans to run for a full term next year.
   She remains popular with voters, though the level of satisfaction
has ebbed a bit. A Behavior Research Center survey of 713 state
residents in early January found 40 percent rated her good or
excellent, compared with 45 percent in a similar survey in July.
Thirty-one percent rated her fair, the same as in July, but 14
percent saw her as poor or very poor, up slightly from 11 percent in
July. The pollsters said their margin of error was plus or minus 3.4
percent.
   Politicians say journalists have treated Mrs. Mofford more gently
than they did Mecham. But there have been some embarrassments during
her first year.
   Reporters found that while secretary of state and in charge of
financial disclosure regulations, she had failed to list property,
loans and income on the same disclosure forms that got Mecham in
trouble.
   They also found that over five years as secretary of state she
had spent at least $50,000 in state funds on gifts to visiting
dignitaries and office decorations while telling the public she paid
for such things herself.
   Even ribbon-cutting and making speeches, a favorite Mofford
pastime, turned sour when she fell from a platform at a speech and
suffered a concussion. She worked a limited schedule for weeks
afterward.
   Ken Smith, Mecham's last press secretary, says Mofford aides are
smart to keep her away from most media contact because ``she does
not cope well with those kinds of stressful situations.''
   Mrs. Mofford's few news conferences have been short.
   Reporters _ and the public _ have had difficulty getting answers
to such questions as how she feels about restricting abortion or
reinstating Arizona's death penalty in the wake of a court decision
invalidating it. Some newspapers have dubbed her the ``stealth
governor.''
   Yet in addition to showing courage by proposing new taxes, Mrs.
Mofford won praise for vetoing a bill giving the state's largest
telephone company a tax break. More controversial were her vetoes of
a measure that would have allowed communities to set their own
obscenity standards instead of relying on a statewide standard and
one that would have made it a felony for people who know they have
AIDS to have sex without telling the partner.
   ``She's not a caretaker at all,'' said state health director Ted
Williams, who has served five governors in a variety of posts. ``Any
time I have any questions, any time I want any policy clarified, she
has been there.''

   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has
foiled a military coup attempt that may have included plans to bomb
his reviewing stand on Armed Forces Day, diplomats in Baghdad report.
   They said he remains firmly in control of the nation he has ruled
for a decade and would not have visited North Yemen in mid-January
if he had been worried.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz told reporters in New York on
Thursday reports of a coup attempt in his country were ``completely
baseless,'' adding, ``We absolutely deny'' claims that Iraqi army
officers were punished.
   Aziz met U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar at U.N.
headquarters on Thursday regarding peace talks with Iran.
   Reports of the coup attempt centered on air force officers from
Samarra, whose people are traditional rivals of Hussein's clan in
Tikrit, another provincial town.
   An Armed Forces Day parade scheduled for Jan. 6 was canceled,
without explanation, and European defense ministers who had been
invited were asked stay away.
   Some diplomats in the Iraqi capital said the plan was for three
air force planes to bomb the president's reviewing stand.
   While acknowledging details were sketchy, they pointed to the
absence in public of Air Marshal Hamid Shaaban, the air force
commander highly decorated by Hussein during the eight-year war with
Iran. They said this indicated a plot, and said Shaaban might have
been executed.
   Others said the attempt was made while Hussein visited Egypt in
December, with the result that up to 200 military officers and
members of the ruling Baath Socialist Party were executed.
   Dissident Kurdish groups and Iraqi exiles have reported the
executions.
   Earlier reports said a top military commander disappeared just
after the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the war with Iran and two others
died in mysterious helicopter crashes.
   Hussein, 51, became vice president when the Baath Socialist Party
seized power in 1968 and has been president since 1979. He rose
through the political ranks, not the military.
   Iraq was plagued by coups before the Baath party took over, and
Islamic fundamentalist groups loyal Iran tried to assassinate
Hussein several times in the early years of the war.
   He has controlled the military by appointing members of his
Tikrit clan to the most sensitive posts and keeping other officers
in line with a combination of favoritism and purges.
   A Middle East dipomat said: ``He got rid of any generals or
commanders as soon as their stars started to shine a bit brighter.''
   According to a Western envoy, ``There's always some potential for
a coup. The only plausible quarter is from the military.''
   The diplomats speculate that plotters may have been encouraged by
trouble within Hussein's tight-knit clan over his treatment of his
eldest son, Odai, who killed a favorite presidential bodyguard in
October.
   They said the son was imprisoned, but later released, and now is
believed to have a diplomatic post in Switzerland.
   Hussein's wife protested when he ordered that Odai be tried
publicly for what some saw as a tragic accident, and she went to
live in Switzerland, where she remains, the diplomats reported.
   Gen. Adnan Khairallah, her brother and Iraq's defense minister,
also had a brief falling out with Hussein because the general
intervened, they said.
   ``If the opposition had come from any other direction, Saddam
would not have hesitated in chopping their heads off, but this was
his clan,'' the Middle Eastern diplomat said.
   Serious economic problems have gained attention in Iraq since the
cease-fire.
   The president wants to revive ambitious development plans he had
before the war, including construction of steel and petrochemical
industries that can produce high-tech weapons.
   His government borrowed an estimated $70 billion during the war
and creditors are pressing for payment, but none has offered to help
finance reconstruction.
   Iraq still has 1 million men under arms and military analysts say
it cannot afford to keep them there for long, but demobilization
would them on an economy with no industrial base.
   Many lack basic job skills because they have been fighting a war
for eight years. One diplomat said frustration might lead them to
take up arms against the government if they became unemployed
civilians.

   Inaugural addresses are the style, but budgets
are the substance of new administrations. With his first spending
plan, George Bush completed the transition from the Reagan to the
Bush presidency.
   ``I don't propose to reverse direction,'' Bush told the nation
Thursday night in a televised speech to a joint session of Congress.
   What he set forth was a shift in direction, not a reversal or a
sharp turn. While the direction remained conservative, it was a
direction that was clearly his own.
   A dependence on growth and an opposition to taxes remained
central to his plan for the economy. He stood fast on Star Wars.
   But in many of the priorities and most clearly in the tone, this
was George Bush, not Ronald Reagan.
   Compare their views of government.
   ``Government is not the solution to the problem. Government is
the problem,'' said Reagan, early in his presidency.
   ``We in government cannot stand on the sidelines,'' said Bush,
when he turned to homelessness.
   The new president's budget offers tangible reminders of his
campaign pledges to become ``the education president'' and encourage
a ``kinder, gentler nation.''
   He rejected Reagan's proposal to cut $1.7 billion from the
Medicaid health program for the poor. He proposed increased spening
for the Head Start preschool program as well as a new merit award
program for schools and increased subsidies for black colleges.
   At the same time, however, Bush accepted his predecessor's plan
to cut $5 billion from Medicare, the corresponding health program
for the elderly, and his overall education budget fails to keep pace
with inflation.
   The overall numbers, in fact, vary little from Reagan's budget.
But the changes that Bush did make were carefully designed to show
movement.
   Hence, Bush's call for a child care tax credit of $1,000 for poor
families and for an expanded $3,000 tax deduction for adoption
expenses _ the types of programs Reagan so often was accused of
neglecting.
   Not only did Bush walk away from Reagan's proposal to increase
military spending by 2 percent above the rate of inflation, but he
dropped his predecessor's militant rhetoric on Central America.
   For nearly his entire eight-year presidency, Reagan waged a
crusade against the Sandinista government of Nicaragua, a campaign
that resulted in the major scandal of his administration, the effort
to channel covert funds to the anti-government Contra forces.
   Reagan devoted some of his strongest rhetoric to condemning the
Sandinistas and praising the Contras.
   This was Bush's only reference to the conflict: ``We must stand
firm for self-determination and democracy in Central America __
including in Nicaragua.''
   There was a new emphasis on preventing the spread of nuclear
weapons.
   But Bush did not turn away from his predecessor's plan to
established a space-based missile defense system.
   ``I will vigorously pursue the Strategic Defense Initiative,'' he
said.
   The seeds of conflict with the Democratic Congress were present.
   His plan for a cut in capital gains taxes is certain to get a
cool reception. His belief that economic growth will provide new
jobs and pay for new social programs surely will be tested by
uncertainty about whether that growth can long be sustained.
   But while Reagan often fostered conflict, even with congressional
Republicans, over his budget proposals, the new president went out
of his way to keep relations smooth.
   He recalled his own brief service in the House chamber and said:
``I feel as if I am returning home to friends.''
   He continued: ``I intend in the months and years to come, to give
you what friends deserve: frankness, respect, and my best judgment
about ways to improve America's future.''
   Welcome words to a Congress often locked in confrontation with
his predecessor.

<HEAD>Federal Marshals Find Hair-Adulterated Cheese in Kraft Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ULM, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials seized 830 cases of Kraft
cheese slices from a manufacturing plant here after a routine
inspection uncovered animal hair in one sample.
   The confiscation of the Kraft Deluxe American Slices was ordered
by the U.S. attorney's office in Minneapolis after the FDA found
three hairs in a sample, said Jay Allen, acting director of the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration's compliance branch in Minneapolis.
   ``Once we find a violation, we seize the entire lot,'' he said
Thursday.
   Laboratory analysis determined one of the hairs was that of a
dog, Allen said. Test results were not conclusive on the other two
hairs, but they did not belong to humans.
   Allen said that finding hair in cheese produced in the United
States ``doesn't happen a lot.''
   ``It's really hard to say how it (the hair) got in there,'' said
Tom Nelson, consumer affairs officer at the FDA in Minneapolis.
   Kathy Knuth, a spokeswoman for Kraft Inc. in Glenview, Ill., said
marshals tagged the cheese and left it at the plant. None of the
cheese in the lot had reached the market, she said.
   ``We've never had a consumer complaint'' of hair in cheese, Knuth
said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mary Jo Madigan said Kraft can appeal the
confiscation order. If the company does not challenge the order, the
cheese will be destroyed, she said.
   Knuth said Kraft has not decided whether to challenge the order.
She said the FDA inspection occurred in mid-December but the company
never received a written explanation of the inspection findings.
   ``Despite our request for test results, we've received no
documentation,'' she said. ``We don't know what the situation is
right now.''
   Madigan said the FDA will not seek any damages, fines or other
penalties against Kraft.

<HEAD>Stock Scandal Issue A Problem As Emperor Akihito Opens Parliament</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's parliament resumed business today with an
address by Emperor Akihito as it faced the prospect that a stock
scandal would stall debate on the government's budget for the next
fiscal year.
   The legislative body opened its regular session with the new
monarch's first appearance in the Japanese parliament since he
ascended the Chrysanthemum throne following the Jan. 7 death of his
father, Emperor Hirohito.
   The 55-year-old monarch, clad in a formal morning suit, said
Japan is expected to promote world peace and prosperity and act as a
nation that cherishes culture and nature.
   ``I sincerely hope the Diet will fully perform its mission as the
highest organ of state power,'' Akihito said in a brief speech.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and other top officials of the
majority Liberal Democratic Party were expected to address the
parliament, or Diet.
   Opposition parties were widely expected to disrupt parliamentary
proceedings with demands that Takeshita or other top leaders resign
to take responsibility for the involvement of prominent party
officials in the scandal.
   About 150 influential politicians, bureaucrats and executives
have been implicated in the scandal arising from purchases of shares
in Recruit-Cosmos Co. prior to their listing on Tokyo's
over-the-counter market.
   Although the government has determined the transactions were not
illegal, the affair has raised suspicions of influence peddling and
bribery due to numerous financial links between Recruit, politicians
and civil servants.
   Political analysts here say opposition parties are certain to
demand that key ruling party officials, who bought shares from
Recruit or received political donations from the company, must
resign to ``take responsibility.''
   Opposition boycotts could delay passage of the most important
item on the parliament's agenda, the $47.57 billion national budget.
   The Liberal Democratic Party, which holds a majority of 297-203
in the House of Representatives and a 143-108 majority in the House
of Councillors, often attempts to gain the support of opposition
parties for its legislation.
   In the past year, however, the party has abandoned traditional
consensus politics on several occasions to make progress on crucial
legislation, forcing measures through the parliament despite bitter
opposition from minority parties.
   In December, the governing party ended a 10-year effort to reform
Japan's tax system by forcing a set of bills through parliament
after months of stalling by opposition parties demanding a thorough
investigation into the Recruit scandal.

   Here is a transcript of President Bush's speech
Thursday night.
   Less than three weeks ago, I joined you on the West Front of this
very building and _ looking over the monuments to our proud past _
offered you my hand in filling the next page of American history
with a story of exended prosperity and continued peace.
   Tonight, I am back, to offer you my plans as well.
   The hand remains extended, the sleeves are rolled up, America is
waiting, and now we must produce. Together, we can build a better
America.
   It is comforting to return to this historic chamber. Here, 22
years ago, I first raised my hand to be sworn into public life. So
tonight, I feel as if I am returning home to friends. And I intend,
in the months and years to come, to give you what friends deserve:
frankness, respect, and my best judgment about ways to improve
America's future.
   In return, I ask for an honest commitment to our common mission
of progress. If we seize the opportunities on the road before us,
there will be praise enough for all. The people didn't send us here
to bicker. It's time to govern.
   Many presidents have come to this chamber in times of great
crisis. War. Depression. Loss of national spirit.
   Eight years ago, I sat in that chair as President Reagan spoke of
punishing inflation and devastatingly high interest rates, people
out of work, American confidence on the wane. Our challenge is
different.
   We are fortunate _ a much changed landscape lies before us
tonight. So I don't propose to reverse direction. We are headed the
right way. But we cannot rest. We are a people whose energy and
drive have fueled our rise to greatness. We are a forward-looking
nation _ generous, yes, but ambitious as well _ not for ourselves,
but for the world. Complacency is not in our character _ not before,
not now, not ever.
   So tonight, we must take a strong America _ and make it even
better. We must address some very real problems. We must establish
some very clear priorities. And we must make a very substantial cut
in the federal budget deficit.
   Some people find that agenda impossible. But I am presenting to
you tonight a realistic plan for tackling it. My plan has four broad
features: attention to urgent priorities, investment in the future,
an attack on the deficit, and no new taxes.
   This budget represents my best judgment of how we can address our
priorities. There are many areas in which we would all like to spend
more than I propose, I understand that, but we cannot until we get
our fiscal house in order.

   Next year alone, thanks to economic growth, without any change in
the law, the federal government will take in over $80 billion more
than it does this year. That's right _ over $80 billion in new
revenues, with no increase in taxes. Our job is to allocate those
new resources wisely.
   We can afford to increase spending _ by a modest amount, but
enough to invest in key priorities and still cut the deficit by
almost 40 percent in one year. That will allow us to meet the
targets set forth in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law.
   But to do that, we must recognize that growth above inflation in
federal programs is not preordained, that not all spending
initiatives were designed to be immortal.
   I make this pledge tonight: My team and I are ready to work with
the Congress, to form a special leadership group, to negotiate in
good faith, to work day and night _ if that's what it takes _ to
meet the budget targets, and to produce a budget on time.
   We cannot settle for business as usual. Government by continuing
resolution _ or government by crisis _ will not do.
   I ask the Congress tonight to approve several measures which will
make budgeting more sensible. We could save time and improve
efficiency by enacting two-year budgets. Forty-three governors have
the line-item veto. Presidents should have it, too.
   At the very least, when a president proposes to rescind federal
spending, the Congress should be required to vote on that proposal _
instead of killing it by inaction.
   And I ask for Congress to honor the public's wishes by passing a
constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget. Such an
amendment, once phased in, will discipline both Congress and the
executive branch.
   Several principles describe the kind of America I hope to build
with your help in the years ahead.
   We will not have the luxury of taking the easy, spendthrift
approach to solving problems _ because higher spending and higher
taxes put economic growth at risk.
   Economic growth provides jobs and hope. Economic growth enables
us to pay for social programs. Economic growth enhances the security
of the nation. And low tax rates create economic growth.
   I believe in giving Americans greater freedom and greater choice
_ and I will work for choice for American families, whether in the
housing in which they live, the schools to which they send their
children, or the child care they select for their young.
   You see, I believe that we have an obligation to those in need,
but that government should not be the provider for first resort for
things that the private sector can produce better.
   I believe in a society that is free from discrimination and
bigotry of any kind. I will work to knock down the barriers left by
past discrimination, and to build a more tolerant society that will
stop such barriers from ever being built again.
   I believe that family and faith represent the moral compass of
the nation _ and I will work to make them strong, for as Benjamin
Franklin said: ``If a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His
notice, (can) a (great nation) rise without His aid?''
   And I believe in giving people the power to make their own lives
better through growth and opportunity. Together, let's put power in
the hands of people.

   Three weeks ago, we celebrated the Bicentennial Inaugural, the
200th anniversary of the first presidency. And if you look back, one
thing is so striking about the way the founding fathers looked at
America. They didn't talk about themselves. They talked about
posterity. They talked about the future.
   We, too, must think in terms bigger than ourselves.
   We must take actions today that will ensure a better tomorrow. We
must extend American leadership in technology, increase long-term
investment, improve our educational system, and boost productivity.
These are the keys to building a better future.
   Here are some of my recommendations:
   _I propose almost $2.2 billion for the National Science
Foundation to promote basic research and keep us on track to double
its budget by 1993;
   _I propose to make permanent the tax credit for research and
development;
   _I have asked ice President Quayle to chair a new Task Force on
Competitiveness;
   _I request funding for NASA and a strong space program _ an
increase of almost $2.4 billion over the current fiscal year. We
must have a manned space station; a vigorous, safe space shuttle
program; and more commercial development in space. The space program
should always go ``full throttle up'' _ that's not just our
ambition; it's our destiny.
   I propose that we cut the maximum tax rate on capital gains to
increase long-term investment. History on this is clear: this will
increase revenues, help savings, and create new jobs.
   We won't be competitive if we leave whole sectors of America
behind. This is the year we should finally enact urban enterprise
zones, and bring hope to our inner cities.
   But the most important competitiveness program of all is one
which improves education in America. When some of our students
actually have trouble locating America on a map of the world, it is
time for us to map a new approch to education.
   We must reward excellence, and cut through bureaucracy. We must
help those schools that need help most. We must give choice to
parents, students, teachers, and principals. And we must hold all
concerned accountable. In education, we cannot tolerate mediocrity.
   I want to cut the drop-out rate, and make America a more literate
nation. Because what it really comes down to is this: the longer our
graduation lines are today, the shorter our unemployment lines will
be tomorrow.
   So tonight I am proposing the following initiatives:
   _The beginning of a $500 million program to reward America's best
schools _ ``merit schools'';
   _The creation of special presidential awards for the best
teachers in every state _ because excellence should be rewarded;
   _The establishment of a new program of National Science Scholars,
one each year for every member of the House and Senate, to give this
generation of students a special incentive to excel in science and
mathematics;
   _The expanded use of magnet schools which give families and
students greater choice;
   _And a new program to encourage ``alternative certification'' _
which will let talented people from all fields teach in our
classrooms.

<TEXT>
   I have said I'd like to be ``the education president.'' Tonight,
I ask you to join me by becoming ``the education Congress.''
   Just last week, as I settled into this new office, I received a
letter from a mother in Pennsylvania, who had been struck by my
message in the inaugural address. ``Not 12 hours before,'' she
wrote, ``my husband and I received word that (our) son was addicted
to cocaine. (He) had the world at his feet. Bright, gifted,
personable ... he could have done anything with his life. (Now) he
has chosen cocaine.''
   ``Please,'' she wrote, ``find a way to curb the supply of
cocaine. Get tough with the pushers. (Our son) needs your help.''
   My friends, that voice crying out for help could be the voice of
your own neighbor. Your own friend. Your own son. Over 23 million
Americans used illegal drugs last year _ at a staggering cost to our
nation's well-being.
   Let this be recorded as the time when America rose up and said
``No'' to drugs. The scourge of drugs must be stopped. I am asking
tonight for an increase of almost a billion dollars in budget
outlays to escalate the war against drugs. The war will be waged on
all fronts.
   Our new ``drug czar,'' Bill Bennett and I will be
shoulder-to-shoulder in the executive branch leading the charge.
   Some money will be used to expand treatment to the poor, and to
young mothers. This will offer the helping hand to the many innocent
victims of drugs _ like the thousands of babies born addicted, or
with AIDS, because of the mother's addiction.
   Some will be used to cut the waiting time for treatment. Some
money will be devoted to those urban schools where the emergency is
now the worst. And much of it will be used to protect our borders,
with help from the Coast Guard, the Customs Service, the departments
of State and Justice, and yes, the U.S. military.
   I mean to get tough on the drug criminals. Let me be clear: this
president will back up those who put their lives on the line every
single day _ our local police officers.
   My budget asks for beefed-up prosecution, for a new attack on
organized crime, and for enforcement of tough sentences _ and for
the worst kingpins, that means the death penalty.
   I also want to make sure that when a drug dealer is convicted,
there is a cell waiting for him. He should not go free because
prisons are too full.
   Let the word go out: if you are caught and convicted, you will do
time.
   But for all we do in law enforcement, in interdiction and
treatment, we will never win this war on drugs unless we stop demand
for drugs.
   So some of this increase will be used to educate the young about
the dangers of drugs. We must involve parents. We must involve the
teachers. We must involve the communities. And my friends, we must
involve ourselves, each and every one of us in this chamber.
   One problem related to drug use demands our urgent attention and
our continuing compassion. That is the terrible tragedy of AIDS. I
am asking for $1.6 billion for education to prevent the disease _
and for research to find a cure.

   If we're to protect our future, we need a new attitude about the
environment. We must protect the air we breathe. I will send to you
shortly legislation for a new, more effective Clean Air Act. It will
include a plan to reduce, by date certain, the emissions which cause
acid rain _ because the time for study alone has passed, and the
time for action is now.
   We must make use of clean coal. My budget contains full funding,
on schedule, for the clean coal technology agreement that we made
with Canada. We've made that agreement with Canada and we intend to
honor that agreement.
   We must not neglect our parks. So I am asking to fund new
acquisitions under the land and water conservation fund.
   We must protect our oceans. I support new penalties against those
who would dump medical waste and other trash into our oceans. The
age of the needle on the beaches must end.
   In some cases, the gulfs and oceans off our shores hold the
promise of oil and gas reserves which can make our nation more
secure and less dependent on foreign oil. When those with the most
promise can be tapped safely, as with much of the Alaska National
Wildlife Refuge, we should proceed. But we must use caution and we
must respect the environment.
   So tonight I am calling for the indefinite postponement of three
lease sales which have raised troubling questions _ two off the
coast of California, and one which could threaten the Everglades in
Florida. Action on these three lease sales will await the
conclusions of a special task force set up to measure the potential
for environmental damage.
   I am directing the attorney general and the administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency to use every tool at their disposal
to speed and toughen the enforcement of our laws against toxic waste
dumpers. I want faster cleanups and tougher enforcement of penalties
against polluters.
   In addition to caring for our future, we must care for those
around us. A decent society shows compassion for the young, the
elderly, the vulnerable, and the poor.
   Our first obligation is to the most vulnerable _ infants, poor
mothers, children living in poverty _ and my proposed budget
recognizes this. I ask for full funding of Medicaid _ an increase of
over $3 billion _ and an expansion of the program to include
coverage of pregnant women who are near the poverty line.
   I believe we should help working families cope with the burden of
child care. Our help should be aimed at those who need it most _
low-income families with young children. I support a new child care
tax credit that will aim our efforts at exactly those families _
without discriminating against mothers who choose to stay at home.
   Now, I know there are competing proposals. But remember this: The
overwhelming majority of all preschool child care is now provided by
relatives and neighbors, churches and community groups. Families who
choose these options should remain eligible for help. Parents should
have choice.
   And for those children who are unwanted or abused, or whose
parents are deceased, we should encourage adoption. I propose to
re-enact the tax deduction for adoption expenses, and to double it
to $3,000. Let's make it easier for these kids to have parents who
love them.
   We have a moral contract with our senior citizens. In this
budget, Social Security is fully funded, including a full
cost-of-living adjustment. We must honor our contract.

<TEXT>
   We must care about those in ``the shadow of life,'' and I, like
many Americans, am deeply troubled by the plight of the homeless.
The causes of homelessness are many, the history is long, but the
moral imperative to act is clear.
   Thanks to the deep well of generosity in this great land, many
organizations already contribute. But we in government cannot stand
on the sidelines. In my udget, I ask for greater support for
emergency food and shelter, for health services and measures to
prevent substance abuse, and for clinics for the mentally ill _ and
I propose a new initiative involving the full range of government
agencies. We must confront this national shame.
   There is another issue I decided to mention here tonight. I have
long believed that the people of Puerto Rico should have the right
to determine their own political future. Personally, I favor
statehood. But I ask the Congress to take the necessary steps to let
the people decide in a referendum.
   Certain problems, the result of decades of unwise practices,
threaten the health and security of our people. Left unattended,
they will only get worse _ but we can act now to put them behind us.
   Earlier this week, I announced my support for a plan to restore
the financial and moral integrity of our savings system. I ask
Congress to enact our reform proposals within 45 days. We must not
let this situation fester. We owe it to the savers in this country
to solve this problem.
   Certainly, the savings of Americans must remain secure _ insured
depositors will continue to be fully protected. But any plan to
refinance the system must be accompanied by major reform. Our
proposals will prevent such a crisis from recurring. The best answer
is to make sure that a mess like this will never happen again.
   The majority of thrifts in communities across this nation have
been honest; they have played a major role inhelping families
achieve the American dream of home ownership. But make no mistake:
Those who are corrupt, those who break the law, must be kicked out
of the business; and they should go to jail.
   We face a massive task in cleaning up the waste left from decades
of environmental neglect at America's nuclear weapons plants.
Clearly, we must modernize these plants and operate them safely.
That is not at issue _ our national security depends on it.
   But beyond that, we must clean up the old mess that's been left
behind _ and I propose in this budget to more than double our
current effort to do so. This will allow us to identify the exact
nature of the various problems so we can clean them up _ and clean
them up we will.
   We have been fortunate during these past eight years. America is
a stronger nation than it was in 1980. Morale in our armed forces is
restored. Our resolve has been shown. Our readiness has been
improved. And we are at peace. There can no longer be any doubt that
peace has been made more secure through strength. When America is
stronger, the world is safer.
   Most people don't realize, that after the successful restoration
of our strength, the Pentaon budget has actually been reduced in
real terms for each of the last four years. We cannot tolerate
continued, real reductions in defense.
   In light of the compelling need to reduce the deficit, however, I
support a one-year freeze in the military budget _ something I
proposed last fall in my flexible freeze plan.
   This freeze will apply for only one year _ after that increases
above inflation will be required. I will not sacrifice American
preparedness; and I will not compromise American strength.

   I should be clear on the conditions attached to my recommendation
for the coming year:
   _The savings must be allocated to those priorities for investing
in our future that I have spoken about tonight;
   _This defense freeze must be a part of a comprehensive budget
agreement which meets the targets spelled out in the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law without raising taxes, and which
incorporates reforms in the budget process.
   I have directed the National Security Council to review our
national security and defense policies and report back to me within
90 days to ensure that our capabilities and resources meet our
commitments and strategies.
   I am also charging the Department of Defense with the task of
developing a plan to improve the defense procurement process and
management of the Pentagon _ one which will fully implement the
Packard Commission report. Many of the changes can only be made with
the participation of the Congress _ so I ask for your help.
   We need fewer regulations. We need less bureaucracy. We need
multiyear procurement and two-year budgeting. And frankly, don't
take this wrong, we need less congressional micromanagement of our
nation's military policy.
   (Applause.) I detect a slight division on that question.
   But nevertheless, securing a more peaceful world is perhaps the
most important priority I'd like to address tonight. We meet at a
time of extraordinary hope. Never before in this century have our
values of freedom, democracy, and economic opportunity been such a
powerful political and intellectual force around the globe.
   Never before has our leadership been so crucial, because while
America has its eyes on the future, the world has its eyes on
America.
   It is a time of great change in the world _ and especially in the
Soviet Union. Prudence and common sense dictate that we try to
understand the full meaning of the change going on there, review our
policies, and then proceed with caution. But I first personally
assured General Secretary Gorbachev that, at the conclusion of such
a review, we will be ready to move forward. We will not miss any
opportunity to work for peace.
   The fundamental fact remains that the Soviets retain a very
powerful military machine, in the service of objectives which are
still too often in conflict with ours. So let us take the new
openness seriously. Let us step forward to negotiate. But let us
also be realistic. And let us always be strong.
   There are some pressing issues we must address: I will vigorously
pursue the Strategic Defense Initiative. The spread and even use of
sophisticated weaponry threatens global security as never before.
   Chemical weapons must be banned from the face of the Earth, never
to be used again. And, look, this won't be easy. Verification (will
be) extraordinarily difficult. But civilization and human decency
demand that we try.
   And the spread of nuclear weapons must be stopped. I will work to
strengthen the hand of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Our
diplomacy must work every day against the proliferation of nuclear
weapons.
   And, around the globe, we must continue to be freedom's best
friend. We must stand firm for self-determination and democracy in
Central America _ including in Nicaragua. For when people are given
the chance, they inevitably will choose a free press, freedom of
worship, and certifiably free and fair elections.

   We must strengthen the alliance of industrial democracies _ as
solid a force for peace as the world has ever known. This is an
alliance forged by the power of our ideals, not the pettiness of our
differences. So let us lift our sights _ to rise above fighting
about beef hormones to building a better future, to move from
protectionism to progress.
   I have asked the secretary of state to visit Europe next week and
to consult with our allies on the wide range of challenges and
opportunities we face together _ including East-West relations. And
I look forward to meeting with our NATO partners in the near future.
   I, too, shall begin a trip shortly _ to the far reaches of the
Pacific Basin, where the winds of democracy are creating new hope,
and the power of free markets is unleashing a new force.
   When I served as our representative in China 14 or 15 years ago,
few would have predicted the scope of the changes we've witnessed
since then. But in preparing for this trip, I was struck by
something I came across from a Chinese writer. He was speaking of
his country, decades ago _ but his words speak to each of us, in
America, tonight.
   ``Today,'' he said, ``we are afraid of the simple words like
goodness and mercy and kindness.''
   My friends, if we're to succeed as a nation, we must rediscover
those words.
   In just three days, we mark the birthday of Abraham Lincoln _ the
man who saved our union, and gave new meaning to the word
opportunity. Lincoln once said: ``I hold that while man exists, it
is his duty to improve not only his own condition, but to assist in
ameliorating (that of) mankind.''
   It is this broader mission to which I call all Americans. Because
the definition of a successful life must include serving others.
   To the young people of America, who sometimes feel left out _ I
ask you tonight to give us the benefit of your talent and energy
through a new program called ``YES,'' for Youth Entering Service to
America.
   To those men and women in business _ remember the ultimate end of
your work _ to make a better product, to create better lives. I ask
you to plan for the longer-term and avoid the temptation of quick
and easy paper profits.
   To the brave men and women who wear the uniform of the United
States of America _ thank you. Your calling is a high one _ to be
the defenders of freedom and the guarantors of liberty. And I want
you to know that the nation is grateful for your service.
   To the farmers of America, we appreciate the bounty you provide.
We will work with you to open foreign markets to American
agricultural products.
   To the parents of America, I ask you to get involved in your
child's schooling. Check on their homework. Go to the school, meet
the teachers, care about what is happening there. It is not only
your child's future on the line, it is America's.
   To kids in our cities _ don't give up hope. Say no to drugs. Stay
in school. And yes, ``Keep hope alive.''
   To those 37 million Americans with some form of disability _ you
belong in the economic mainstream. We need your talents in America's
work force. Disabled Americans must become full partners in
America's opportunity society.

   To the families of America watching tonight in your living rooms:
Hold fast to your dreams, because ultimately America's future rests
in your hands.
   And to my friends in this chamber, I ask for your cooperation to
keep America growing while cutting the deficit. It is only fair to
those who now have no vote _ the generations to come.
   Let them look back and say that we had the foresight to
understand that a time of peace and prosperity is not the time to
rest, but a time to press forward. A time to invest in the future.
   And let all Americans remember that no problem of human making is
too great to be overcome by human ingenuity, human energy, and the
untiring hope of the human spirit. I believe this. I would not have
asked to be your president if I didn't.
   Tomorrow, the debate on the plan I have put forward begins. I ask
the Congress to come forward with your own proposals, if they are
different. Let us not question each other's motives. Let us debate.
Let us negotiate. But let us solve the problem.
   Recalling anniversaries may not be my specialty in speeches _ but
tonight is one of some note. On Feb. 9, 1941, just 48 years ago
tonight, Sir Winston Churchill took to the airwaves during Britain's
hour of peril.
   He had received from President Roosevelt a hand-carried letter
quoting Longfellow's famous poem: ``Sail on, Oh Ship of State! Sail
on, Oh Union, strong and great! Humanity with all its fears, with
all the hopes of future years, Is hanging breathless on my fate!''
   Churchill responded on this night by radio broadcast to a nation
at war, but he directed his words to Franklin Roosevelt. ``We shall
not fail or falter,'' he said. ``We shall not weaken or tire. Give
us the tools, and we will finish the job.''
   Tonight, almost a half-century later, our peril may be less
immediate, but the need for perseverance and clear-sighted fortitude
is just as great.
   Now, as then, there are those who say it can't be done. There are
voices who say that America's best days have past. That we are bound
by constraints, threatened by problems, surrounded by troubles which
limit our ability to hope.
   Well, tonight I remain full of hope. We Americans have only begun
on our mission of goodness and greatness. And to those timid souls,
I repeat the plea _ give us the tools; and we will do the job.

   Here is a transcript of remarks by House
Speaker Jim Wright Thursday night.
   For 200 years this nation has given every new president its hand
and its help and a chance to lead.
   Senator Lloyd Bentsen and I are here tonight to tell you that the
Democratic Congress wants to work with this president in every way
that we can. We'll give him our sincere cooperation. That does not
mean obedience. It does mean our honest help and our very best
advice.
   In world affairs, Democrats in Congress are committed to seeking
true bipartisanship in all areas of America's foreign policy. As we
deal with other nations of the world, friend or foe, Americans
should stand as one.
   America struggles today to overcome three enormous deficits _ the
budget deficit, the trade deficit, and the social deficit which
results from our prolonged underinvestment in such things as public
education and industrial modernization.
   These deficits have been feeding on one another in a vicious way.
In just the short time it took us to hear Mr. Bush make his speech
tonight, the public debt was increasing by about $15 million. That
much is added to our children's bill every 50 minutes.
   As the debt skyrocketed during the past decade, the trade deficit
grew, and our standard of living began to fall for the first time in
modern recollection.
   Instead of employing Americans making goods to sell abroad _ and
lending money to those who buy our goods _ we've been buying things
that others make _ and borrowing from them to pay for it. And to pay
for our borrowing, we've been selling off little pieces of America.
Foreign interests own a bigger and bigger slice of this country. And
that's not good enough.
   We have seen the gap grow wider between the rich and the poor in
our own country, and average American families today are finding it
harder, not easier, to pay for such necessary things as housing and
health care and higher education for our children.
   As we sit in our warm homes right now, gazing at our television
sets, some things are easy to forget. I ask you to remember when you
go to bed this evening that 3 million of our fellow countrymen are
homeless tonight.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Less Than One In Three Czechs Is Considered Healthy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government official said less
than a third of Czechs surveyed can be considered healthy, and an
official newspaper blamed poor nutrition and ``bad living.''
   The Communist Party daily Rude Pravo in its Thursday article
quoted Josef Podstata, a deputy minister of health care and social
affairs of the Czech Socialist Republic, as citing a ``selective
investigation in 1986'' that disclosed 669 chronic diseases per
1,000 inhabitants.
   The article did not say how many people were surveyed and no
figures were given on the health situation in Slovakia, the other
major region of Czechoslovakia.
   ``One citizen out of four dies of cardiovascular diseases and one
out of four due to malignant tumors,'' the paper said on the most
frequent causes of death in the Czech Republic.
   ``There is no doubt a role is played here by the bad living and
working environment and nutrition, i.e. lack of foodstuffs that
would correspond to requirments of good nutrition,'' Podstata was
quoted as saying.

   They have no place of their own to eat or sleep, to take a bath
or wash their clothes. Their children have no place to study or play.
   No, these are not just derelicts or ne'er-do-wells or social
misfits. They represent many families of the working poor who have
low-paying jobs and work every day, but just can't find a way to pay
for the inflated price of housing.
   America can do better than that. We must do better!
   Of course, we cannot expect to vanquish all these evils
immediately, but if we have the will we can make significant
progress against all three deficits this year.
   We in the Congress, and surely all Americans everywhere, are
anxious to help our new president fulfill his promise of a ``kinder,
gentler America.'' I want very much to help George Bush qualify to
be known as ``the education president.''
   We in Congress are eager to help him attain the goals he has
expressed of wider access for all Americans to Head Start services,
to safe and wholesome child day care in an age when both parents
must work, to affordable housing and to a cleaner environment.
   By working hard together, we must drive the scourge of drugs from
our streets and our schools as Mr. Bush pledged in his inaugural
speech and his speech tonight. Congress made significant progress
last year in this truly bipartisan goal. We developed a good battle
plan for the war against drugs. But when it came to paying for the
war, the government ran out of money. Right now we're financing not
a war, but a skirmish.
   That's not good enough. Our society can afford to pay for a
vigorous anti-drug effort. Truth is, we can't afford not to. That's
our first line of defense.
   That, and the education of our children _ more vital to our
national security than Star Wars.
   But, since 1980, the federal investment in education has actually
declined by 12 percent. Is it any wonder that American students _
better fed and surely just as smart _ do worse in mathematics and
languages, and geography, and science, than students do in almost
any other industrial nation?
   That's not good enough. We can do better than that. And we will.

<HEAD>WASHN: we will.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Working together Congress will pass a clean air bill this year to
protect that precious commodity upon which all human life depends.
   A kinder, gentler America? That's old time Democratic religion.
We embrace it enthusiastically!
   We know, and you know, that these goals cannot be achieved by
words alone, or by symbolic gestures. They require money _ the
commitment of resources sufficient to win the battle against these
common enemies.
   On the question of how these vital initiatives will be paid for,
the Democrats in Congress will insist on fairness.
   We would have to reject any kind of ``flexible freeze'' that
would bend with flexibility for the rich and powerful but freeze out
the middle income families of America.
   We will oppose attempts to cut Medicare.
   We are ready to meet with President Bush any time he wishes and
seek common solutions. Our House Budget Committee will begin its
formal hearings in just a few days. The president's representatives
are invited. We are determined to complete our work on time, and
pass our appropriations bills on time, again this year _ just as we
did last year.
   We do have limited resources and urgent challenges. But you know
there are some things we can do without spending public money.
   We must raise the minimum wage, held down for eight long years _
because those who work honestly for wages in America must never
receive less than they would on welfare.
   We can ask that polluters pay more of the cost of cleaning up the
poisons which they create and from which they profit.
   We must encourage American corporations to reinvest in America _
in plants and factories and jobs and strength, not in leveraged
buyouts and paper profits.
   We should require that corporations insure the health of their
employees _ so that the hard-earned family savings of a decade or
more cannot be just wiped out by the single illness of a child.
   When it comes to shaping a kinder, gentler, fairer nation the
real test is not whether we have the words but whether we have the
will. For ultimately we will be judged by what we have done.
   In the years ahead, long after this night is forgotten and the
phrases have faded and our page of history has turned, let it be
said of us that we have refreshed America's sense of common concern;
that we renewed America's basic strength; that together we reached
out for America's future and put our faith and our investment in the
American people.
   In our earnest efforts to help the new president build this
future, the House and Senate will work together. The Senate
Democratic majority is represented tonight by the chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee _ our recent nominee for vice president of
the United States _ Senator Lloyd Bentsen.

   Here is a transcript of remarks by Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen Thursday night.
   My friends, George Bush and I have had our battles but we've been
on the same side too _ as far back as 45 years ago. We were both
young men, bomber pilots, defending the cause of freedom. There's
nothing like the first puffs of anti-aircraft fire to teach a flight
crew about the need to work together.
   Tonight, we're together again. Democrats and Republicans may
disagree on tactics. But we have the same destination in mind _ a
strong, free, prosperous America.
   There's a lot we can do together. Because we have worked as a
team, America is stronger militarily. President Reagan achieved a
major nuclear arms reduction treaty. That's good.
   My old colleague, the late Scoop Jackson, once said that in
foreign policy ``the best politics is no politics.'' I agree.
Democrats won't play politics with matters of war and peace.
Remember: that military build-up was enacted with lots of Democratic
votes. Democrats know how to work as a team. We've done it.
   That doesn't mean we won't disagree. There'll be sharp,
principled disagreements among Democrats and Republicans over one of
the greatest challenges America has ever faced.
   Because today our great industrial heartland is under attack. Not
from foreign military forces. From new technology. From foreign
competition _ often from our allies.
   You see the evidence everywhere. You see it in ships pulling up
to American docks loaded not with immigrants but with Volkswagens.
You see it in the living rooms of America _ in those VCRs so many of
you tonight have sitting beside the TV set. None of those VCRs are
made in America _ not one! It's all very well to say: read my lips.
Japanese computer companies tell customers: read my chips. It's
effective; even the Pentagon buys Japanese microchips.
   The result? We're losing good jobs. And that hurts the very
fabric of America. A few months ago, in Dawson, Ga., after two
plants closed wiping out 2,000 jobs, a high school class was asked
where they would settle after graduation. Only two out of 20 wanted
to stay in Dawson. At the beginning of this decade our workers had
the highest average income in the world. Today that distinction
belongs to the West Germans and the Japanese.
   Is it inevitable that we lose to Japan _ or the other Pacific rim
countries? Or Europe united by 1992? Should kids growing up in
Dawson, Ga., settle for a second-class economy dependent on the
goods of others?
   I don't buy that. America is a country of great strength. We can
take charge of our economic future.
   But to do that we're going to have to be more productive. You
can't have a vacuum tube outlook for the age of microchips. We'll
have to get tough with those countries whose trade practices are
unfair _ we deserve a level playing field. And we'll have to face
some hard facts.
   Example: Under the last administration we became the largest
debtor nation in history. Last year our trade deficit was $150
billion. That's cost us 500,000 manufacturing jobs.
   Example: The last administration rolled up more debt than every
administration from George Washington to Jimmy Carter combined. This
year one out of every seven federal dollars _ another $150 billion _
will go just to pay interest on that debt.
   We don't oppose foreign investment. But why should the money from
average taxpayers go to pay off bonds owned by rich bondholders,
whether from Tokyo _ or Palm Beach? How can we stay competitive _
how can we even preserve Social Security _ when we saddle ourselves
and our children with such a debt? It's like putting lead weights on
Michael Jordan's legs and asking him to slam dunk anyway.

<TEXT>
   Frankly, I don't think Republicans have faced up to these twin
towers of debt _ or some other problems.
   Education: Right now 25 percent of our youngsters won't finish
high school. Twenty-five million Americans can't read the warning
label on a bottle of poison. The Army uses comic books for
instruction manuals: there's a five-page comic to explain how to
release the hood of a jeep.
   How are we going to stay competitive that way? We have to cure
adult illiteracy. We must train Americans for the sophisticated jobs
of the 1990s.
   The environment: We have to send a message to polluters, whether
they dump PCBs into our river beds, or fluorocarbons into the
atmosphere. We have to tell them the free ride is over; that we want
air we can breathe and water safe to drink.
   And let's send a message to those who think they can fly light
planes loaded with cocaine across our southern borders _ or sell
crack in the schoolyards of New York and Chicago. The message to
drug dealers and criminals is this: you can't hide behind smart
lawyers. We won't plea bargain away our rights. We'll find you.
We'll catch you. And we'll put you away.
   A few years ago, Yelena Bonner, the Soviet dissident, visited
America. ``Americans don't want war,'' she wrote. ``They want a
house.''
   She's right. But it's becoming harder and harder to find housing
_ not just for the homeless but for those who grew up in homes and
want to buy one for their families. For the first time in four
decades the homeownership rate is declining in America. I meet lots
of young couples who've simply had to move in with mom and dad.
They'd like to be on their own.
   And mom and dad think that's a good idea, too.
   Finally, ethics: Do we really want Korean companies getting
favors from influence peddling ex-administration officials? Or
racketeers in New York getting contracts from cronies of an attorney
general? It's one thing to have a government that's a friend to
business. It's quite another to have one that just wants business
for its friends.
   George Bush is right, there is a new breeze blowing through
Washington. But don't expect us to stand with our fingers in the air
to see which way that breeze is blowing. We Democrats will work with
President Bush, but we will be guided by a set of enduring values.
At the top of the list is good jobs at good pay. We want American
workers to be the best paid in the world _ just as they were eight
years ago.
   You know, I've been around a long time. But in the last few weeks
my thoughts have often turned to a man who was around even longer _
in fact for almost half the history of our country.
   He was born dirt-poor. His parents were homesteaders on the
plains of South Dakota in a sod house. When that first blizzard blew
in, the family took turns staying awake during one 36-hour stretch,
burning bundles of straw so they wouldn't freeze to death.
   They made it through the storm. They lived. My father worked
hard. He prospered. And last fall, shortly before his death, he had
the privilege of seeing his son campaign for vice president of the
United States.
   I wish we'd done a little better for him.
   Still, my friends, in the story of Lloyd Bentsen Sr., lies the
promise of America. It's a reminder that this country allows those
who believe in hard work _ and teamwork _ to succeed, whether
sodbusting during a South Dakota winter . . . or as president.
   At this moment, when President Bush has announced his flight plan
for the years ahead, we Democrats in the co-pilot's seat say: let's
work hard _ together _ to keep America strong _ not just in planes
and tanks, but in the factory, in the farmhouse, and in the
schoolhouse. We'll make sure that when our children look back on the
last years of the 20th century, they'll say we did the job: we kept
the American dream alive.
   Thank you, and God bless you.

<HEAD>Senators: Indian Hearings Show Need for Major Overhaul of BIA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senators say the Bureau of Indian Affairs in
for a major overhaul after an initial series of hearings detailed
contract fraud, Mafia infiltration and child sexual abuse on
reservations.
   Senators heard emotional testimony Thursday from Hopi Indian
mothers who say their children were sexually abused at reservation
schools.
   Five mothers, some near tears, told of teachers and relatives who
had molested children, and their desperation to find counselors who
could help them and their young ones deal with the trauma.
   The testimony came as two weeks of hearings wrapped up before a
special unit of the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs. The
hearings, which also detailed fraud in the government's
Indian-preference contract program and mob influence on reservation
gambling operations, are to resume Feb. 21.
   But senators said they have heard enough already to decide that
the BIA is in need of major changes, and that more funding is needed
to help Indians victimized by the problems on the reservations.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., assured the mothers who testified
Thursday that more money will be provided for counseling centers to
combat the child abuse problem. ``We'll get the funding,'' he said.
   The mothers told of the case of John Boone, a former teacher and
coach at Pollaca Day School, which is operated by the BIA on the
Hopi reservation in northeastern Arizona.
   Boone molested 142 to 144 boys over nine years, said a mother who
identified herself as Sylvia. He now is serving a prison term after
pleading guilty to sex offenses on the reservation, said Mary Lou
Soller, an attorney for the committee.
   Debra, whose son was one of Boone's victims, said she reported
Boone to the school principal in 1986 after her son came home and
said he'd taken a shower with the teacher in the teacher's home.
   She said the principal got angry with her and took no action.
   ``I was devastated,'' she said.
   Debra said that to no avail she forbade her sons from going to
Boone's house, and on one occasion sent her daughter to retrieve
them.
   The daughter told her she saw Boone ``wrestling around'' with one
of the boys and stole a ``sex book'' from Boone's house that had
photos and definitions of sex terms.
   This time, about a year after the first incident, Debra went to
the tribal investigator and later the FBI arrested Boone.
   During the investigation, agents found a list Boone kept of boys
and the kinds of relations he had had with them, said Sylvia.
   Another mother, Mary, told of seeing a teacher fondling a little
girl at the Hoteville Bacavi School, a non-BIA school on the
reservation. She said she complained and the teacher was dismissed,
but no other action was taken and he is now teaching in New Mexico.
   Last May, as a result of the Boone incident, the federal
government set up a child sex abuse center on the reservation to
provide counseling, but the center is understaffed and 38 people are
on its waiting list, said Sylvia.
   She said some of the boys who were abused by Boone are now young
men who are becoming abusers themselves.
   Funding for the center is due to expire this May, but McCain
assured that it would not.
   ``Don't tell me they (the BIA) don't have the money to go into an
area where 142 kids have been abused for nine years,'' he said.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., chairman of the special
committee, said the BIA could expect some major changes as the
result of the hearings.
   When asked after the hearing if the BIA needed an overhaul,
DeConcini responded: ``It's pretty clear it does.''

<HEAD>Thornburgh Says Only a Fraction of S&amp;L Losses Recoverable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush promises to ``relentlessly
pursue'' crooked managers of failed savings and loans, but his
attorney general does not expect to recover more than a tiny
fraction of the billions of dollars in federally insured deposits
they embezzled or lost.
   ``We'd be fooling ourselves to think that any substantial portion
of these assets is going to be recovered,'' Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh told the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.
   ``In many cases,'' he said, ``the assets have been dissipated
through laundering schemes or taken out of the country and are
beyond the reach of federal authorities.''
   Bush's $90 billion rescue package to take control of the
remaining insolvent S&amp;Ls and pay off their depositors would require
at least $40 billion from taxpayers over the next 10 years.
   While acknowledging that taxpayers ultimately will bear a burden,
many lawmakers say they first want federal prosecutors to recover as
much as possible through forfeitures and fines from what Sen.
Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., called the ``go-go boys who perpetrated
this outrageous fraud.''
   Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, where the biggest portion of
the fraudulent S&amp;L lending cases have occurred, agreed with
Thornburgh that ``you might not get blood out of a turnip, but you
can get some satisfaction.''
   ``The plain truth is that the real crooks have long left the S&amp;L
business,'' Gramm said. ``But we want you to find your meanest and
toughest prosecutors and go after these people.''
   Rep. Paul K. Kanjorski, D-Pa., on Thursday asked the General
Accounting Office to review Bush's plan and whether the $50 billion
in higher insurance premiums that it would impose on S&amp;Ls and banks
will drive more of them into insolvency.
   Thornburgh blamed fraud, embezzlement and other insider abuses
for 25 percent to 30 percent of the S&amp;L failures, saying
white-collar crime in the industry was responsible for $2 billion in
losses in 1988 alone.
   ``There are clearly institutions where active criminal activity
has been the primary source of the failure of the institution or
losses to the point that it had to be taken over,'' he said.
   But he said he could not guarantee that the 600 new prosecutors,
other attorneys and investigators that Bush wants for pursuing
criminal wrongdoing will be able to recover even the $50 million
that the effort will cost annually.
   Developers who dealt with many of the failed thrift institutions,
particularly in Texas, where federally insured deposits were used to
buy yachts, lavish parties and resort homes for S&amp;L owners, agreed.
   David Gleeson, president of Lincoln Asset Management Co. in
Dallas, the nation's largest apartment developer and also a major
developer of shopping centers and office buildings, told the
committee he suspects a lot of the money has been ``squirreled away
in foreign countries.''
   ``Even if you could obtain a conviction and prove that funds were
illegally obtained and used for building a $6 million house in North
Dallas, that doesn't go very far in trying to recover $75 billion to
$85 billion,'' Gleeson told the Senate panel.
   Thornburgh said the Justice Department would use the $50 million
to set up several multi-agency task forces similar to a 57-member
team that has been operating in the Dallas area for the past 18
months.
   So far, that Dallas task force has brought eight indictments and
16 criminal informations against 33 individuals. The investigation
has yielded 20 convictions, fines totaling $133,250 and
court-ordered restitutions totaling nearly $2.8 million.
   Of the 12 people who have been sentenced, however, only one
received more than a one-year jail term and four were placed on
probation, Thornburgh said.
   Bush made his promise to ``relentlessly pursue'' S&amp;L fraud cases
earlier this week when he unveiled his plan, which also calls for
increasing the maximum prison sentences in such cases to 20 years.
   Thornburgh and other Justice Department officials acknowledged
that current federal sentencing guidelines for white-collar crime
are too lenient to be an effective deterrent.
   ``For a bank fraud violation resulting in a $25 million loss to
the victim financial institution, for example, the culprit could
receive a mere 30 months' imprisonment, perhaps even less,'' said
Edward Dennis, an assistant attorney general in the Justice
Department's criminal division.

<HEAD>Public-Private Scenic Byways Program Wins Approval</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department has officially given
the green light to a ``scenic byways'' promotion by the Plymouth
division of Chrysler Motors but is shying away from endorsing the
company's products.
   A three-way partnership was worked out with the California-based
Forest Education Foundation, Plymouth and USDA to help upgrade
designated scenic stretches of highways into major tourist
attractions.
   F. Dale Robertson, chief of the Forest Service, said Thursday the
191 million acres of national forests _ if gathered in one place, an
area larger than Texas _ offer ``some of America's most spectacular
scenery.''
   ``This partnership will allow us to showcase the beauty of these
areas for the American public, nearly half of whom spend part of
their leisure time driving for enjoyment,'' he said.
   Robertson told a news conference the venture is the first major
national effort undertaken by his agency with a private corporation.
The agreement is for three years and could be renewed.
   He said the Forest Service's involvement with Plymouth and the
foundation is strictly on behalf of the byways program and that the
company ``will not be using our logo'' on any of its products or
receive any endorsement by the agency.
   But Robertson and Pat Smorra, general marketing manager for
Plymouth, dodged reporters' questions about details of the financial
arrangement between the agency and the company.
   Smorra said that he was ``not announcing the exact dollars we're
putting into (the program), but it is extensive in terms of
communication efforts, as well as promotional efforts.''
   Robertson said the budget proposed for the Forest Service in the
1990 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, calls for $1.5 million for
``challenge cost-share projects'' including the byways program.
   ``So we would anticipate at least that amount in 1990 _ and
perhaps some more of our budget _ going into it,'' he said.
   The funds call for matching dollars, at least, from approved
participants to carry out the cost-share projects.
   ``There is some up-front cash from Plymouth, but I'm not free to
say (how much) right now,'' Robertson said.
   The scenic byways program began last year with the designation of
a 26-mile stretch of U.S. Highway 64 in southeastern Tennessee. So
far, 30 have been designated, covering 1,676 miles, and others are
being identified for addition to the system.
   One goal is to upgrade the highway areas to make them more useful
and entertaining for motorists. Projects can include interpretive
signs, improved road maintenance, pullouts at scenic overlooks,
parking areas, some rest area facilities and short-loop walking
trails.
   According to an information folder by the non-profit foundation,
Plymouth will publicize the byways through ``an ambitious
promotional program which includes 20 exhibitions at heavily
attended regional consumer shows, discreet signage in 3,500 Plymouth
dealerships, and in 700 high-traffic retail locations and ski
areas.''
   The promotion also includes a national sweepstakes with a
Plymouth as grand prize.

   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
600,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat under an Agriculture Department
export subsidy program.
   Christopher E. Goldthwait, acting general sales manager for the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service, said Thursday the wheat
was part of an authorization of more than 2 million tons under the
Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Goldthwait said the wheat is for shipment in March. Counting some
left over from a previous EEP arrangement and 2 million tons
authorized Jan. 25, the Soviets have more than 1.4 million tons
still available under the program.
   With the latest sale, the Soviet Union has bought about 2.6
million tons of wheat for delivery in the sixth year of a long-term
supply agreement, which was extended last fall to run through Dec.
31, 1990.
   A metric tons is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 600,000 tons are equal to about 22 million bushels
worth around $90 million at recent U.S. farm prices.
   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced
prices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   Sales for delivery in the sixth year of the agreement also
included about 10.2 million tons of corn, along with 450,000 tons of
soybeans, 1.4 million tons of soybean meal, and 508,900 tons of
grain sorghum.
   Goldthwait said the 600,000 tons of wheat were sold by Ferruzzi,
USA Inc., 100,000 tons; Continental Grain Co., 250,000; Louis
Dreyfus Corp., 200,000; and Central States Enterprises Inc., 50,000.
   The companies will get subsidy of $23.01 per ton, or about 63
cents per bushel, under the EEP arrangement.

<HEAD>Mother Says Shop Sold Gun to Suicide Despite Warning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HIALEAH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A resident who says she warned a gun
dealer across the street not to sell a weapon to her depressed son
is suing the shop because the young man later bought a pistol there
and shot himself to death.
   Alicia Portela filed a wrongful death suit in Dade Circuit Court
against Metro Distributors Inc., owner of the gun shop across the
street from her home.
   Ms. Portela said her 29-year-old son, Luis Oscar Perez, suffered
from depression and had been receiving psychiatric care for two
years.
   ``He said he wanted to kill himself,'' she said Wednesday. ``He
told his father he was going to buy a gun. Since the shop is right
across the street from our house, I went there and told them not to
sell my son a gun. I told them he had a mental illness.''
   Portela, however, said she did not remember whom she talked to,
and Metro vice president Dennis Whitt said no one at the store
recalls the incident.
   ``I'm not familiar with the person. I'm not familiar with the
incident. None of this rings a bell,'' Whitt said.
   According to the suit, Perez bought the gun at the store Aug. 5,
two or three months after his mother says she talked to the clerk.
He paid $345 for a .357-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson and a box of shells.
   The shop waited the required 48 hours to give him the gun, and
two weeks later he used it to commit suicide.
   The mother said Metro had violated state law by selling the gun
to ``a person of unsound mind.''
   The clerk should have been able to tell he was unsound because of
his ``trembling hands. The look in his eyes. His uneasiness,'' the
mother contends.

   A disgruntled waiter accused of attacking
two men with a hammer and a knife after they left him a paltry tip
has been found temporarily incompetent to stand trial.
   Superior Court Judge Edward Leavitt ruled Wednesday that Guang Da
Shen, 19, of New York City was unable to assist in his own defense
and could not understand the assault charges lodged against him.
   The attack took place Jan. 14 outside the Dragon House Restaurant
after Louis Pabian, 59, of Trumbull, and his son, Neil, 24, of
Bridgeport, left Shen a $2 or $3 tip after eating a dinner costing
less than $50, according to police.
   Shen waited for them outside the restaurant and when they
approached their car, he attacked them with a hammer and knife,
police said. They suffered minor injuries in the incident.
   After hearing about 20 minutes of testimony from Dr. James
Alexander, a Bridgeport psychiatrist who conducted a court-ordered
examination of Shen, Leavitt concluded there was a ``substantial
probability that competency may be regained with inpatient
psychiatric treatment.''
   The judge ordered Shen to be placed in the custody of state
mental health officials.

<HEAD>Entertainment Industry Fighting for Assault Weapon Waiver</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The entertainment industry wants film and
television producers excluded from the flood of anti-assault weapons
bills proposed since a schoolyard massacre that claimed the lives of
five children in Stockton.
   Lisa Rawlins, director of the California Film Commission, said
she had already mounted a campaign seeking waivers in 10
anti-assault weapons bills before the state Legislature.
   When the California Film Commission meets Wednesday in
Sacramento, Ms. Rawlins will seek official CFC endorsement of a move
to preserve the right to use or simulate use of assault weapons in
entertainment programs. No opposition was anticipated, she said.
   The first such waiver was contained in a Los Angeles city ban
approved by the City Council and signed Wednesday by Mayor Tom
Bradley.
   The ordinance bans the sale of assault weapons and gives owners
15 days to render such weapons inoperable or surrender them to
police. Violators face six months in jail and a fine of up to $1,000.
   Originally, the law didn't specifically exclude the entertainment
industry. But Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky revised the proposal at the
urging of Charles Weisenberg, the city's director of Motion Picture
and Television Affairs.
   ``An assault weapon may be maintained in the possession of an
entity or establishment engaged in the business of motion picture,
television or video production, but only for the purpose of being
utilized as a prop,'' the city ordinance states in part.
   Ms. Rawlins told the industry newspaper Daily Variety she had
already alerted the legislative unit of the state Department of
Commerce, which will be monitoring the proposed state bills and
induce their authors to offer proposals with industry exemptions.
   In addition, she plans to enlist the aid of the California League
of Cities and the County Supervisors Association of California.
   Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn plans to introduce a
county-wide anti-assault weapons law next week.
   The rush to enact assault weapons bans and restrictions follows
last month's Stockton shooting in which a gunman with an AK-47 rifle
killed five youngsters.

<TEXT>
   Michael Manley, who led a pro-Cuban
socialist government in the 1970s, swept to victory Thursday over
conservative Prime Minister Edward Seaga in an election marred by
gunfire and allegations of widespread fraud.
   With 65 percent of the ballots counted, Jamaica Broadasting
Corp., the government-run television network, declared Manley's
party the winner of at least 34 of the 60 seats in Parliament. The
network declared Seaga's party the winner of eight seats, with the
remaining 18 undecided as of 10 p.m. EST.
   Under the Jamaica's British-modeled system, the party winning a
majority of parliamentary seats forms the government.
   In the popular vote, Manley's left-leaning People's National
Party led Seaga's right-of-center Jamaica Labor Party vote 57
percent to 43 percent, or 429,680 votes to 324,486.
   ``Let us set an example for all future generations of dignity and
cooperation in victory,'' Manley told a cheering throng outside
party quarters in Kingston.
   It is ``not given to many people a second chance to serve a
nation,'' he added.
   The results closely matched the findings of an opinion poll
Sunday that predicted Manley's party would capture 48 of the 60
seats of Parliament. Seaga's party now holds all 60 seats.
   Seaga conceded at 10:45 p.m. EST.
   ``The people have spoken and we abide by their decision,'' he
said at party headquarters. ``We can hold our heads high as a
previous government and we'll hold our heads high as an opposition.''
   He added: ``We shall take our defeat with a smile,'' indicating
he would not challenge the results.
   Manley was prime minister from 1972 to 1980. His government then
embraced Cuba, alarming the United States and foreign investors, but
he lately has projected a more moderate image. Seaga has been one of
the Caribbean region's strongest U.S. allies.
   Many polling stations closed early because of the violence, and
soldiers fired shots and used tear gas to break up skirmishes.
Sporadic gunfire left one woman dead and at least six others wounded.
   Throughout the day, the two candidates accused each other of
fraud, intimidation and voting irregularities.
   The killing of Glenna Williams, a 25-year-old pregnant houswife,
raised to at least 12 the number of people killed in politically
related violence since the campaign opened Jan. 15. Seaga said Mrs.
Williams was shot a minute before he arrived to vote.
   It was Jamaica's first nationally contested election since 1980,
when an estimated 700 people were killed in political violence over
a nine-month campaign.
   This campaign was shortened to just over three weeks because of
fears of violence at the height of the island's winter tourist
season.
   Attacks were confined mainly to slums in Kingston, the capital,
and a few towns where armed gangs control large voting blocs.
Montego Bay and other beach resorts on the northern coast were calm.
   About 10,000 police and soldiers were deployed to maintain order
at more than 6,000 polling stations.
   Some stations closed early because of the disturbances and fraud
allegations. Moments before Seaga's motorcade drove through a
central Kingston neighborhood, soldiers fired shots in the air and
used tear gas to break up fighting and skirmishes outside polling
stations. Similar incidents were reported across the country.
   About 1 million people were eligible to vote in this country of
2.4 million people, and lines formed early. Although there was no
official estimate, voter turnout was heavy.
   Manley voted at a probation office in Kingston. He said he
awakened at 5:30 a.m. to check polling stations where there might be
trouble.
   He said Seaga supporters were harassing his supporters verbally
at one polling station, and five other stations lacked red ink to
mark voters' fingers to prevent people from casting multiple ballots.
   Noting the atmosphere was less charged than in 1980, Manley said
Jamaicans were ``returning to former habits'' of holding peaceful
elections.
   After voting at a Kingston high school, Seaga accused his
opposition of fraud.
   ``The level of stealing of ballot boxes and stuffing of ballot
boxes, backed by intimidation and pressure from adjoining areas and
by leading political figures is something that's undefinable,''
Seaga said.
   Seaga said Mrs. Williams was killed ``a minute before I got
there. I saw her dead right there.'' Police said she was shot when a
man fired at party supporters.
   A member of Seaga's party, Sen. George Ramocan, said Manley's
supporters intimidated some voters and that men posing as policemen
stole ballot boxes from a polling station in a Seaga stronghold.
   Manley dismised Seaga's charges, saying, ``Frankly, the charge is
a pathetic excuse for the anticipated defeat for the Jamaica Labor
Party.''
   Jamaica's leading pollster, Carl Stone of the University of the
West Indies, forecast Manley's party would win 48 seats.
   Manley and the People's National Party boycotted the last
election in 1983 in a dispute over voter registration.
   Seaga sought a third consecutive term, something no prime
minister has achieved since universal suffrage in 1944.
   The campaign centered on bread-and-butter issues and the
contrasting personalities of Seaga and Manley.
   Seaga, 58, is regarded as a skillful manager, but aloof and
autocratic. Manley, 64, a powerful orator with an engaging
personality, is seen by supporters a champion of the little people.
   Manley has said he would restore diplomatic relations with Cuba _
broken by Seaga in 1980 _ but that priority would be given to good
relations with the Bush administration.
   Seaga, Boston-born and Harvard-educated, was the first official
foreign visitor to the Reagan White House in 1981 and supported the
1983 U.S. invasion of Grenada.
   Although Seaga restored Jamaica's tattered economy, he raised
taxes and devalued the currency, cutting deeply into the buying
power of poorly paid wage earners.

   Burt Reynolds' new television series will
have a captive audience for its debut when the inmates at Lantana
Correctional Institution view it on five new color televisions
provided by the star.
   Reynolds' production company, Blue Period Inc., provided $1,500
for the TVs to make up for inmates' inconvenience during three days
of filming of the detective series ``B.L. Stryker'' at the prison in
late January.
   ``It was a gesture on their part,'' prison Superintendent Ray
Henderson said. ``We did not require it. They wanted to do something
that would impact the most, since the inmates were inconvenienced.''
   During the filming, the prison's 40 inmates were confined to one
end of the prison and barred from using their outdoor recreation
yard, Henderson said.
   Officials expect the televisions to arrive in time for the
inmates to catch Monday night's premier on ABC-TV. The sets will
replace the prison's present ones, which ``are on their last legs,''
Henderson said.

<TEXT>
   Premier John Swan and his governing
United Bermuda Party late Thursday won their third general election
in six years but lost ground to the opposition party in the British
colony's parliament.
   ``We have a reduced majority but it is still a working
majority,'' Swan said after the election.
   The governing party won 50 percent of the popular vote, or 22,774
votes, compared with 62 percent in the October 1985 election. The
opposition Progressive Labor Party won 16,848 votes, or 37 percent
of the popular vote.
   Having started with control of 31 of the 40 parliamentary seats
in the island's House of Assembly, however, the governing party
emerged with 23 seats.
   Almost all the lost seats went to the Progressives, who now
control 15 of the 40 seats.
   Swan, 53, said he had anticipated the result, which he attributed
to the ``ebbs and flows of democracy.''
   He acknowledged the result was a setback and that his party has
been sent a clear message from Bermuda's 30,000 registered voters.
   ``We will be ensuring frank and open discussion in order to keep
the public informed,'' he said.
   Among governing party leaders who lost seats were three Cabinet
ministers, including his Finance Minister and Deputy Premier
Clarence James.
   During the campaign, Swan made it clear that the governing party
no longer considers independence from Britain a priority for the
chain of 150 small islands in the western Atlantic, about 690 miles
southeast of New York.
   Under a 1968 consitution, Britain's appointed governor is
normally bound to accept the advice of the Cabinet in matters other
than foreign affairs, defense and internal security.
   Bermuda has been under British control since 1684.

<HEAD>Push on in Congress to Reinstate Fairness Doctrine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Broadcasters are going to have a tough time
convincing Congress they can provide balanced coverage of
controversial issues without a new Fairness Doctrine, a congressman
says.
   Rep. Matthew J. Rinaldo, R-N.J., said at a hearing Thursday that
the doctrine from 1949 until its repeal in 1987 served as a mild
reminder to broadcasters ``of their obligations under the law.''
   ``It is not the unblinking eye of government on our
broadcasters,'' said Rinaldo, the ranking minority member of the
House Commerce and Energy telecommunications and finance
subcommittee.
   Rinaldo added that while he was encouraged by broadcasters'
performance since the Federal Communications Commission repealed the
doctrine, ``I think the facts of life are such that they have ... a
long way to go before they're going to convince Congress that the
doctrine is not needed any longer.''
   In repealing the doctrine, the FCC said it violated the First
Amendment and did not serve the public interest. Broadcasters
appearing before the subcommittee Thursday argued that the doctrine
was a ``chilling'' restraint on broadcast journalism and was an
anachronism in an era of new technology and media diversity.
   John Spain, news director of WBRZ-TV in Baton Rouge, La., said
the mere threat of a Fairness Doctrine complaint can make
broadcasters hesitant to cover controversial issues.
   ``The time and money stations expend whenever licenses are
threatened by a fairness complaint clearly inhibits and harasses
broadcasters,'' Spain told the panel.
   But Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., the subcommittee chairman,
said writing the Fairness Doctrine into law would be the
subcommittee's first order of business.
   ``The Fairness Doctrine did not chill broadcaster speech, nor did
it infringe on broadcasters' First Amendment rights,'' Markey said.
``The Fairness Doctrine did, however, ensure that broadcasters did
not infringe the First Amendment rights of the rest of us _ those of
us without broadcast licenses.''
   Commerce Committee Chairman John D. Dingell, D-Mich.,
reintroduced a Fairness Doctrine bill when Congress returned to
Washington in January. Congress in 1987 passed a bill to make the
doctrine a law, but President Reagan vetoed the measure. The House
passed the measure again, but it did not come to a vote in the
Senate.
   Dingell said he hopes the Bush administration ``will take a
different perspective.''
   Dingell left little doubt that Congress will not take up other
issues of concern to broadcasters until the issue of the Fairness
Doctrine is resolved.
   Broadcasting issues Congress may consider include possible
restraints on children's TV advertising, federal support for
high-definition television and restoration of rules requiring cable
TV systems to carry all local over-the-air broadcast stations.
   Dingell said that ``once this issue has been disposed of ... we
can then move on to address other questions and listen to requests
for special treatment from the broadcasters.''
   Phillip Jones, executive vice president of Meredith Broadcasting,
said he objected to use of the Fairness Doctrine as a ``bargaining
chip'' between Congress and broadcasters.
   ``That bothers me greatly because this is my freedom of press and
my freedom of speech. ... I understand the freight train is coming
along the track and ... it's very hard to stand in front of this
thing right now knowing that you want to get this done. But I think
you owe it to your constituents to consider the constitutionality of
this thing,'' Jones said.
   ``We feel that we can administer ourselves ... that we have the
best interest of the local community at heart,'' Jones said. ``To
think that we don't want to cover all issues completely is somewhat
insulting.''
   Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., said Congress should pass the bill
quickly, let President Bush veto it, as he pledged to do during the
campaign, and then let the courts decide the issue.
   Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, took the side of broadcasters, saying the
doctrine no longer is constitutional.
   ``Things have changed substantially since the time that the
Fairness Doctrine was first enacted. We have had a proliferation of
media outlets since that time. We have a wide diversity of
viewpoints expressed to the American public,'' Tauke said.

<HEAD>Toxic Spill Occurred at Libyan Plant, Webster Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CIA Director William Webster says Libya
recently experienced a serious toxic spill at chemical weapons
production facilities as the country rushes toward large-scale
manufacture of mustard gas and nerve agents.
   Webster told the Senate Government Operations Committee on
Thursday that the spill occurred at Rabta, some 60 miles southwest
of Tripoli, but he provided no other details.
   He said that while such problems are expected to continue, Libya
is on the verge of producing a chemical weapons capability far in
excess of any realistic military needs, posing the possibility such
weapons could be transferred to Middle East nations with past links
to terrorists.
   Webster based his statements on intelligence estimates.
   Webster said the Libyan facility is the largest single factory
complex in the Third World capable of producing chemical weapons.
Iraq's overall chemical weapons potential is thought to be larger
still, he said.
   ``We are concerned that the plant's production capabilities far,
far exceed what Libya could use for its own military purposes,''
Webster said.
   ``Therefore it becomes a potential brokering agent for other
countries,'' in the Middle East with links to groups which may have
past terrorist intentions, he said. He did not elaborate.
   Webster said the Libyan chemical complex is linked to a nearby
metal fabrication facility ``equipped with the precision materials
to manufacture components for a variety of bombs and artillery.''
   ``Other facilities are involved with filling and storing chemical
weapons,'' he said.
   Repeating previous U.S. assertions, Webster said West German
companies have given Libya extensive assistance to assemble the
chemical complex and provide materiel for it.
   In a related development, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of
Kansas predicted a ``strong American reaction'' unless West Germany
quickly cracks down on companies helping Libya develop chemical
weapons and enacts tough domestic laws to control the export of
chemical weapons technology and material.
   Dole said he delivered that message Thursday to Wolfgang
Schaeuble, chief of staff to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
during a meeting in his Capitol office.
   ``West Germany is among our strongest allies and we can't afford
to have this important issue _ on which we should share the same
view _ divide us,'' Dole said.
   Dole is pressing for congressional passage of legislation
imposing sanctions on foreign firms which help Libya and other Third
World nations develop chemical weapons.
   He said firms providing such assistance have been both witting
and unwitting about the ultimate nature of the Libyan facility.
   Asked why a Western company would knowingly help Libya and other
Third World nations achieve a chemical warfare potential, Webster
said: ``I can only surmise that greed is the explanation.''

<TEXT>
   When the patrician suburb of Swampscott asked the
gritty industrial city of Lynn to share its sewage system, Lynn was
agreeable but attached one condition: help us integrate our schools.
   The proposal left some in Swampscott ``in a state of shock,''
according to the town clerk, and stirred up century-old differences
of race and class in the two seaside communities.
   ``I feel very strongly that these people in my neighboring
community feel that perhaps they're a better class of people,
because they're all white and affluent, and they're acting
accordingly,'' Lynn Mayor Albert DiVirgilio said Thursday.
   The arrangement would have advantages for both Swampscott, a town
of 14,600 characterized by rows of Victorian sea captains' mansions,
and Lynn, a city of 79,000 that was once the center of the nation's
shoe industry.
   Most officials agree that a regional school district would cut
costs. Swampscott, in fact, is considering merging its school
administrative staff with that of nearby Nahant, another affluent
community on the other side of Lynn.
   DiVirgilio said he wants Lynn to be party to such a
regionalization. He said the city could offer the two towns its
strong vocational school and a wider offering of courses.
   But Swampscott is reluctant to open its schools to Lynn students.
   ``We listened politely, but it didn't go over very well,'' said
Swampscott Town Clerk Jack L. Paster. ``If I had to wager right now,
I'd say we'll be building our own sewage plant.''
   Lynn, which has been a magnet for immigrants since its peak
shoe-making days a century ago, still attracts newcomers because of
its relatively inexpensive housing. It has a median household income
of $12,000, about one-third that of Swampscott.
   Swampscott officials, facing a court order to improve the town's
sewage treatment system, first asked in December whether Lynn's
sewage plant could start treating Swampscott's waste.
   Donald Brewer, the town's public works superintendent, said a new
sewage plant would cost about $16.3 million, some $5 million more
than building a pumping station and hooking into Lynn's plant.
   DiVirgilio gave Lynn's answer two weeks ago in a speech to the
Swampscott Rotary Club that left the Rotarians ``in a state of
shock,'' according to Paster.
   The mayor said Lynn would be glad to assist Swampscott with its
sewage _ if Swampscott, where 96 percent of the students are white,
would help Lynn integrate its public schools.
   The state Education Department is pressuring Lynn to eliminate
racial imbalances in its 17 elementary schools. Although 31 percent
of the city's students are black, Asian or Hispanic, some schools
consisted of less than 25 percent minorities last year and others
more than 50 percent.
   Unless the city develops a plan to guarantee no recurrence of
such imbalances, the state will cancel a $340,000 grant, School
Superintendent Robert J. Gerardi said.
   DiVirgilio said his message to the Rotary ``basically was that
`If you want to work with the city of Lynn, we should work together
on all our problems, not just the ones that are in your favor.'''
   At least, he said, Swampscott should accept Lynn students instead
of the 63 Boston inner-city students it takes in a program to put
urban minority children in suburban schools.
   Swampscott School Committee Chairman Robert Ingram said the town
might consider a limited number of Lynn students.
   Swampscott officials, while conceding that a financial and ethnic
gulf exists between their town and Lynn, denied that racial or class
prejudice was a factor in the town's reluctance to merge schools.
   Rather, the issue is control, Paster said.
   ``We don't want to be controlled by Lynn, and while it would be a
nice idea if we could pay one price and tie in (the sewers) with
them, the mayor of Lynn is putting strings on it, and people here
don't want to hear that,'' he said.
   ``Swampscott is its own little community with its own way of
doing things, and it doesn't want to be beholden to the big city.''

<HEAD>Administration Looking at Reducing Scope of Deposit Insurance</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Bush Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   President Bush is challenging Congress to enact
within 45 days his plan to rescue the savings and loan industry,
including a yearlong study of ``methods to reduce the scope of
deposit insurance coverage.''
   A review by the Treasury Department of deposit insurance would
unearth a suggestion that created an uproar in Congress when it was
offered last month by the outgoing Reagan administration.
   The phrasing in the budget document released Thursday is vague,
but trade association officials interpret it as a warning that the
administration will take another look at lowering the $100,000
insurance limit on bank and thrift institution accounts.
   Treasury's study would include an examination of ``incentives for
market discipline ... (and) methods to reduce the scope of deposit
insurance coverage and the resulting liability of the'' Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., the budget document says.
   ``With that kind of language, we'd read it as a red flag,'' said
Diane Casey, director of regulatory affairs for the Independent
Bankers Association of America. ``We'd oppose any lowering of
deposit insurance.''
   Many conservative economists argue that deposit insurance
encourages banks and S&amp;Ls to take risks because depositors have no
incentive to monitor the health of their institution. Others argue
that reducing deposit insurance could destabilize the financial
system and contribute to bank runs.
   Bush outlined most aspects of his S&amp;L program on Monday. It
includes using taxpayer dollars and higher industry insurance
premiums to pay for the $126 billion S&amp;L crisis. He also proposed
restructuring the regulatory system.
   In his nationally televised speech to a joint session of
Congress, the president called on the legislators to enact the
proposal within 45 days and pledged ``insured depositors will
continue to be fully protected.''
   ``We must not let this situation fester,'' he warned, adding,
``Any plan to refinance the system must be accompanied by major
reform. Our proposals will prevent such a crisis from recurring.''
   Sen. Richard Shelby, D-Ala., a member of the Senate Banking
Committee, called Bush's appeal to complete a bailout bill in 45
days ``a short timetable legislatively'' but said it is not
impossible.
   ``We'd be moving mighty fast to do that, but it can be done,''
said Rep. Tom Bevill of Alabama, a senior Democrat on the House
Appropriations Committee.
   Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, had said in an interview earlier this week he hoped to
have the bailout legislation reported out of his committee by the
first week of March.
   The hint in the budget on the scope of deposit insurance comes
only a month after the Reagan administration suggested in its final
economic report that curtailing deposit insurance ``would restore
much-needed discipline to the system.''
   The Treasury Department, only an hour after the release of the
Reagan report, issued a statement disavowing the suggestion.
However, later it was reported that the department had considered
reducing deposit insurance coverage in the early stages of
formulating Bush's S&amp;L policy.
   The passage in the Bush budget could also be interpreted as
meaning an investigation of curbing the so-called ``too big to fail
syndrome.''
   Regulators have been unwilling to allow large banks to fail,
fearing a possible ripple effect on the financial system. So, in
many cases, they have been protecting all deposits, even those
exceeding the $100,000 insurance limit.
   Edwin Dale, an adviser to budget director Richard Darman, said
the Treasury study was intended ``to find out whether the basic
concept of deposit insurance should be changed.''
   However, neither the president, nor other administration
officials, nor materials given to reporters on Monday, made any
reference to examining a reduction in the scope of deposit insurance.
   Bush's budget also proposed ``incentives to attract more private
capital (to S&amp;Ls) from banks and other financial service firms,'' an
apparent reference to lifting barriers to the acquisition of S&amp;Ls by
bank holding companies.
   The president would also give financial regulators the power to
set risk-based insurance premiums ``if further study demonstrates
the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach.'' Currently
every bank pays the same insurance premium regardless of the safety
or riskiness of its activities.

   President Bush's education budget makes good on
his campaign promises but falls short of matching inflation and
fails to restore cuts made under his predecessor.
   Bush, the would-be ``education president,'' is seeking $441
million more in Education Department spending authority than former
President Reagan had recommended. Most of the money would be used to
reward good schools and set up magnet schools, two ideas Bush pushed
on the campaign trail.
   But education officials, while welcoming Bush's initiatives and
his proposed $250 million increase in Head Start funding, also noted
the new president's budget would not save 24 programs Reagan asked
Congress to kill.
   And they said that even with the extra money Bush has proposed,
the increase is about $360 million short of what would be needed to
keep pace with inflation of about 4.2 percent.
   ``Funds have been moved around and a few dollars have been added,
but we're still dealing with the status quo, a maintenance level
budget,'' said Mary Futrell, president of the National Education
Association, the nation's largest teacher union.
   The federal education budget would go from $21.9 billion this
year to $22.5 billion in fiscal 1990 under the Bush plan, according
to unofficial department estimates. Of the $441 million sought by
Bush, less than $100 million would actually be spent in fiscal 1990.
   The major Bush education initiative is $250 million for a merit
schools program designed to reward schools with safe environments,
high-achieving students and low dropout rates. Grants would average
about $100,000 per school. Special emphasis would be given to
schools serving disadvantaged children. If Congress approved the
program, about $30 million would actually be spent in fiscal 1990.
Outlays would rise to $593 million by 1993.
   Bush is also asking Congress to authorize $100 million for magnet
schools offering specialized curriculum with an emphasis on math and
science and on recognizing the potential of children from
disadvantaged families. Outlays in fiscal 1990 would come to $12
million. The Education Department already runs a $115 million magnet
school program, but the money is available only for desegregation
purposes.
   Bush also called for a $250 million increase for Head Start, the
preschool enrichment program operated by the Department of Health
and Human Services. The program, now receiving slightly over $1.2
billion, currently serves about 20 percent of eligible low-income
children.
   Other education proposals include emergency grants to
drug-infested urban schools; endowment grants to historically black
colleges and universities; science scholarships and teacher awards;
grants to help homeless students and illiterate homeless adults;
money to make it easier for scientists, engineers and other
professionals become teachers and principals, and grants to schools
that experiment in a broad range of areas including curriculum,
management and teaching methods.
   Congress would have to approve all but the homeless programs, the
drug-free school grants and the endowment grants to black colleges.
   Under the Reagan and Bush plans, more than half of the $750
million saved by eliminating 24 programs would go to the Pell grant
program for needy college students and the Chapter 1 program for
disadvantaged schoolchildren.
   Congress has refused in the past to kill the programs Reagan and
Bush have targeted for extinction, which include Perkins or
campus-based direct loans; state student incentive grants that to
spur states to set up need-based scholarship programs, and some
impact aid, which goes to school districts with high enrollments or
low tax revenues due to federal activities.
   The combination of new ideas and old cuts left education
officials with a kinder view of the Bush administration but still
nursing the wounds of past budget battles.
   ``Certainly this is a different administration than the one we
had before. They show a positive inclination to try and do something
for education. There are some promising things,'' said Gerald
Morris, a lobbyist for the American Federation of Teachers and
president of a coalition called Committee for Education Funding.
   ``But the additional investment in Chapter 1 will come at the
expense of other programs,'' Morris added. ``That's the other side
of the coin.''
   Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the House Education
and Labor Committee, said Bush's budget does not stem ``the serious
erosion of education spending that has occurred over the past eight
years.'' He called the plan ``a framework for future discussion and
I look forward to helping the president do a better job of making
good on his campaign pledges.''

<HEAD>$2 Billion Farm Cut `Unreasonable,' House Chairman Says</HEAD>

   President Bush's plan to cut $2 billion in farm
payments next year as a way of mopping up red budget ink makes
``unreasonable demands on agriculture,'' says the top farm lawmaker
in the House.
   ``We in agriculture are prepared to make a fair contribution,''
Agriculture Committee Chairman E. (Kika) de la Garza, D-Texas, said
Thursday night. ``But this administration is asking us to take cuts
which represent considerably more than our share of the
budget-balancing burden.''
   His comments came as Bush delivered to Congress a speech about
his fiscal 1990 budget which called for something similar to the
sweeping farm cuts proposed a month ago by an outgoing President
Reagan.
   Reagan called for a 19 percent cut in overall Agriculture
Department spending, ranging from payments for crop producers to a
subsidy for school lunches for youngsters of families earning more
than $39,500 annually.
   Total USDA spending would have dropped from $52.1 billion
currently to $42.4 billion in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.
Reagan proposed to cut farm payments by $2 billion in next year's
budget, but actually would only have reduced payments by $1.1
billion, paying $900 million to the farmers in the current fiscal
year.
   Bush's blueprint said current programs were put in place to
counter the farm crisis five years ago and noted that the farm
economy is now flourishing.
   ``It is now time to reform our farm programs and not wait until
the current farm bill expires two years hence,'' said Bush's budget
book. It said Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter would ``work
with the Congress to develop a specific set of initiatives designed
to reduce federal farm expenditures by $2 billion in 1990.''
   De la Garza said in a statement, however, that the Bush proposal
``still makes unreasonable demands on agriculture, which already has
given $30 billion in cuts from proposed budgets over the last eight
years.''
   The $30 billion figure did not represent rollbacks in actual
spending but included estimates of outlays under programs altered to
head off soaring costs.
   ``I would remind everyone that if we cut out the entire amount
proposed for agricultural spending, it would still make only an
almost infinitesimal impact on the total budget situation,'' de la
Garza said.
   Most lawmakers were waiting until the nitty-gritty of the Bush
blueprint became clearer before saying much about it.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, a power on
agriculture issues, met with reporters and pronounced himself
pleased that Bush ``touched on the farmers'' in his speech.
   Rep. Virginia Smith, R-Neb., a member of the House Appropriations
Committee, said she did scan some of the details and found to her
dismay that Bush's assumptions about current spending were at sharp
variance with those of his predecessor. She said that could force
down next year's levels.
   Tough negotiations are expected between the administration and
farm lawmakers wary over the reaction of farmers hammered by drought
last summer and fearing more of the same this year, she said.
   ``Ultimately, Mother Nature and the U.S. Congress will have the
last word,'' she added.
   Bush cuts actually would be double the automatic reductions that
would kick in under the Gramm-Rudman law if Congress failed to
reduce the deficit, according to Senate Agriculture Committee
Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.
   ``An agricultural budget cutting twice as deep as the
Gramm-Rudman sequester is not a kinder and gentler budget,'' Leahy
said.
   He also said reducing farm payments would do nothing to pressure
America's trading partners to reduce their own agricultural
subsidies. Some lawmakers say the way to force down payments that
spur European Community farm exports is for America to retaliate
with huge subsidies of its own.
   Actually, U.S. subsidies are running at a level of about $13
billion annually, down from twice that amount only three years ago
when the government pulled out all the stops to get agricultural
exports moving and pump life into a farm economy that was wallowing
in the doldrums.
   Leahy said that when ``the 1990 Reagan budget was released, I
expressed my hope that it was designed to make Bush budget kinder
and gentler.''
   ``I also expressed my fear that the Reagan farm cuts would
undermine a tough U.S. negotiating position in the GATT talks,'' he
said, referring to efforts to reduce subsidies through changes in
the 97-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. ``I am very
disappointed that the Bush budget is neither kinder to the farmer
nor tougher on our competitors in the GATT negotiations.''

   President Bush says former President Reagan's
Pentagon budget has to be cut, but he's leaving it up to his defense
secretary to figure out where the reductions will be made.
   That means it may be several weeks before there are any specifics
because the nomination of John Tower, Bush's choice as defense
secretary, is bogged down in questions about Tower's personal life
and financial dealings.
   Bush called on Thursday for Pentagon spending of $308.8 billion
in fiscal 1990, which would maintain defense spending at about the
current pace, allowing for inflation. The Pentagon is operating on a
$299.5 billion budget.
   The Bush plan is a 2 percent cut from the proposal sent to
Capitol Hill a month ago by Reagan. And Bush says he prefers the
Reagan version.
   ``The president would like to embrace, even for the short term,
the defense budget projections which are in the Reagan budget,''
Bush said in his budget message. ``Unfortunately, the current
economic situation requires defense budget savings.''
   The Bush plan is on target with the predictions of leaders of the
Democratic-controlled Congress, who said a month ago that the best
the Pentagon could hope for would be a budget which keeps pace with
inflation.
   There were few details in the Bush plan, outside his promise that
the National Security Council will review U.S. policy and defense
commitments over the next 90 days.
   Bush also promised to reform the weapons procurement system, but
offered no specifics. The system has been plagued for years by
inefficiency and cost overruns and now is the target of a Justice
Department criminal investigation of fraud.
   One reason for the lack of details in Bush's speech is Tower's
stalled nomination. Without Tower or any of the new top-level
defense team in place, the Pentagon has essentially been rudderless,
according to defense sources.
   Routine decisions are being made by hold-over officials from the
Reagan administration, but major decisions have been delayed until
there is a new defense secretary.
   Tower's nomination won't be voted upon by the Senate Armed
Services Committee for at least two weeks. That means that even if
he were confirmed by the full Senate, he couldn't take office until
late in February.
   But Tower has been advising Bush on defense issues and sat next
to the president Thursday in a Cabinet review of the defense budget.
He entered the House of Representatives with the rest of the Cabinet
to listen to Bush's nationally televised address.
   One decision that will have to be made quickly is whether to
build the single-warhead Midgetman nuclear-tipped missile or a
railroad-based version of the 10-warhead MX missile.
   Congressional Democrats favor Midgetman while Reagan backed the
rail-based MX. In a compromise last year, the current Pentagon
budget includes $350 million which can be used for research and
development of one missile or the other.
   But that budget includes a March 15 deadline for making the
decision. Unless Tower is confirmed soon, the decision may be made
by Brent Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser and a supporter
of the Midgetman weapon. Scowcroft chaired a 1983 presidential
commission which recommended construction of hundreds of Midgetman
weapons.
   If Tower is confirmed, he may also seek cuts in Star Wars. The
current budget is $4.1 billion, and Reagan last month proposed to
increase the figure to $5.9 billion for the program known formally
as the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   Bush's budget plan called for ``the active pursuit'' of SDI, but
included no figures. Last month, Tower told senators at his
confirmation hearing there are still a large number of unanswered
questions about Star Wars.
   The president's message also urged ``a new partnership with this
nation's allies,'' particularly in Japan and Western Europe.
   Although Bush's proposal offered no specifics, the United States
has been pushing both Japan and the European members of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization to increase their contributions to
allied defenses.

   Barbara Blodgett kissed her newborn son as
she happily recalled that just two months ago, suffering from
``cerebral death,'' she became one of the few comatose women in
medical history to give birth.
   Since that time Mrs. Blodgett has made a recovery that has
confounded her doctors.
   On Thursday, she gazed at little Simon Alan Blodgett, stroked the
hair of her other son and nodded her head emphatically when asked if
she hoped for full recovery. She pointed to letters on a piece of
paper to spell out words.
   ``I felt wonderful,'' the 24-year-old woman spelled, when asked
her first response to seeing the newborn.
   Sitting in a wheelchair with her dark hair in a ponytail, she
watched her husband, David, feed the baby from a bottle. Then she
kissed the infant.
   One expert on head injuries speculates that Simon's birth on Dec.
9 may also have triggered his mother's return to consciousness
following a June 1988 auto accident.
   ``One of the things that occurs during birth is massive changes
in hormones,'' said Dr. Bill Blackerby, a specialist in head
injuries in suburban Nashville, Tenn. ``There could be some
relationship between hormonal changes taking place and in some way
maybe that triggered some sort of metabolic process to increase the
level of alertness.''
   Dr. Thomas Benedetti, who delivered the baby, said at the time of
birth that it was only the fourth such case in the world that he
could locate in medical records.
   Such a birth is so rare because any injury sufficient to cause a
coma likely will cause a miscarriage too, said Blackerby, a
physician at Rebound Corp., a private rehablition center for people
with head injuries.
   Coma-causing injuries are also commonly followed by respiratory
problems, which can kill a fetus, he said.
   Dr. Loren Winterscheid, medical director of Seattle's University
Hospital, said he doubts there is a connection between the birth and
return to consciousness.
   ``There is no way of knowing when or how much a patient in a coma
is going to recover,'' he said in a telephone interview from Seattle.
   Although Mrs. Blodgett was never diagnosed as brain dead,
hospital spokesman L.G. Blanchard described her condition as
``cerebral death.'' And her doctors did not hold much hope for her
recovery, Winterscheid said.
   But within a week after the birth, Mrs. Blodgett began to show
signs of coming out of the coma, doctors said. Since then, her
recovery has been steady.
   By mid-January, after returning home, she had regained limited
use of her left hand, and the ability to answer questions by shaking
her head. By late January, she was able to mouth words, could take
wheelchair rides and hold a bottle to Simon's lips.
   It seems like a miracle to family members who had been warned to
hold out little hope for recovery.
   Family members are now watching with interest a New York case in
which a man is seeking to abort a 17-week-old fetus that doctors say
is threatening the life of his comatose wife.
   David Blodgett Sr., Mrs. Blodgett's father-in-law, said he
questions the advice of medical experts who recommend the abortion,
suggesting they cannot really know if that will save the mother.
   ``Any baby that is conceived should have a chance to live,'' he
said.
   Mrs. Blodgett was thrown from a Jeep during an auto accident in
Yakima on June 30, 1988. A cousin was killed, but her husband and
young son escaped serious injury.
   Mrs. Blodgett, who was three months pregnant at the time of the
accident, went into a coma with damage to the cord that connects her
brain to her spine.
   She was transferred on Aug. 18 to University Hospital, where
Benedetti and other doctors monitored the pregnancy.
   On Dec. 9, doctors used drugs to induce labor and delivered
8-pound Simon by Caesarean section.

   A Congress used to being Ronald Reagan's
whipping boy ambled out of the House chamber Thursday night trying
hard to accustom itself to President Bush's offer of partnership in
shaping the next federal budget.
   While the president's debut of his $1.16 trillion spending plan
for fiscal 1990 left many of them suspicious about its details, the
Bush tone of conciliation seemed to make the biggest impression on
them.
   In a town that values comity as the best way to make progress,
many of the lawmakers agreed the mood Bush strove to create was an
auspicious way to start the legislative year.
   ``This is a man I can work with,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel,
D-N.Y., the liberal chairman of the House narcotics committee.
``With Reagan I just never had the opportunity.''
   Being a member of Congress for the last eight years meant
listening to speech after speech in which then-President Reagan
vilified the lawmakers as profligates whose unbridled pleasure at
spending was a key cause of deficits hitting $200 billion annually.
   But the president who spoke to the joint session of Congress for
50 minutes Thursday was a different man with a different message.
   ``His speech could have been delivered by any Democrat,'' said
Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark. ``His problem will be getting it through
his party. Ours will go along with 70 or 80 percent of it.''
   ``We know what we have to do now,'' said Sen. Alan Simpson of
Wyoming, the Republican Senate whip. ``We have to go hump.''
   Everyone realizes that once the tough work of actually shaping a
budget begins, there will be conflict as usual. Many of the
battlefields on which Bush will clash with the Democrats who control
both houses of Congress became clear after the speech.
   One was the president's proposal to lump hundreds of programs _
mainly domestic _ into a single category that, in total, he would
restrict to the same amount of spending as this year. Because of
inflation, population growth and the lurking possibility of
unanticipated problems, such restraint can be tougher than it sounds.
   For Bush, this was a manifestation of his ``flexible freeze''
approach he mentioned vaguely during the presidential campaign. For
many Democrats, this was a crafty way of claiming deficit savings
while leaving the hard choices for later.
   ``It's a black box that frankly we haven't seen before,''
complained Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee.
   ``There's a black hole over at OMB into which all these programs
have sunk,'' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser,
D-Tenn., referring to the president's Office of Management and
Budget, which wrote the spending plan.
   ``I suspect his strategy is to not make specific proposals for
cuts, and to try to bring Congress into negotiations so Congress can
share the blame for the cuts and the pain,'' Sasser said.
   Many Democrats also grumbled that the president had simply not
provided enough specific information on how the government would
save raise revenues and reduce spending.
   ``The only thing that troubles me is the arithmetic,'' said Rep.
Norman Mineta, D-Calif. ``He has a lot of additional programs, but
the arithmetic doesn't add up.''
   Another fight looms over Bush's proposal to slash the capital
gains tax on productive assets held more than two years to 15
percent, less than half the current top rate. Many Democrats find
his claim that the reduction would increase revenues by $4.8 billion
next year to be implausible.
   Nonetheless, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said the
Democratic reaction ``doesn't mean there won't be some compromise.''
And Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the Senate Appropriations
Committee, wouldn't rule out the idea. ``I think he's going to have
to sell that to the American people,'' he said.
   Bush won Democratic praise for his proposal to limit the increase
in defense spending to the inflation rate and spreading some of the
savings around to domestic programs.
   ``Nobody can come in and say he's controlling growth in domestic
programs to fund defense,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
   Overall, it was a budget message that left Congress feeling like
it had been offered a hand, not a fist.
   ``Tonight,'' said Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., ``this was a
president who didn't want to pick a fight.''

   British Airways is making precautionary checks on
five of its seven Concorde jets after discovering ``small cracks''
in the roof structure of one of them, aviation officials said.
   The Civil Aviation Authority said Thursday that the airline was
checking planes that have made more than 3,500 landings before they
take five more flights. French airline officials are making the same
checks on Concorde jets, it added.
   ``No Concorde is flying with British Airways which has any
cracks,'' said a British Airways spokeswoman, who did not give her
name in keeping with British practice.
   The authority said cracks on the Concorde were discovered during
maintenance work.
   It said the upper fuselages of the planes were to be given
ultrasonic checks, to be repeated after every 100 flights until
parts are replaced.
   Of five planes to be investigated in this manner, four had been
checked and another was undergoing maintenance, it said.

   Social services groups welcomed President
Bush's budget plan restoring funds that former President Reagan had
proposed cutting from Medicaid, but they said he should have done
the same with Medicare.
   Bush's proposal incorporating Reagan's $5 billion in Medicare
savings ``extinguishes forever some of the president's vaunted
`thousand points of light,''' said Michael D. Bromberg, executive
director of the Federation of American Health Systems, which
represents 1,400 for-profit hospitals.
   The savings would be achieved mainly by limiting increases in
payments to hospitals, doctors and other health care providers _
which, Bromberg said, will result in more hospital closings and loss
of health-related jobs.
   Medicare serves about 31 million elderly and 3 million disabled
Americans.
   Bush's spending plan would hold Medicare growth to $8 billion,
about $5 billion less than it would be if the program were extended
in its current form. Bush would fund the program at $92.5 billion in
fiscal 1990, about 9.5 percent above the current level.
   To meet his pledge for a ``kinder, gentler nation,'' Bush
proposed to maintain the current level of Medicaid services for 26
million poor Americans in fiscal 1990 and extend coverage for
pregnant women and children. He also wants to increase spending for
AIDS research and outreach, the homeless and adoption services.
   For Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for the
poor, Bush restored $1.7 billion Reagan had proposed cutting back
and added $3.3 billion, or 9.7 percent, to bring the program up to
$37.6 billion _ the amount needed to maintain the current level of
services under the program.
   Bush withdrew Reagan's proposal to cut $1.1 billion in matching
Medicaid payments to the states, an action that drew praise from the
American Association of Retired Persons.
   ``Restoring Medicaid to full funding ... is good news,'' said
Horace Deets, AARP executive director. ``But we're certainly
disappointed we're not hearing a similar statement on Medicare.''
   Costs of the Medicaid and Medicare programs are among the fastest
growing segments of the federal budget because health care costs
have been increasing far faster than the general inflation rate.
   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonprofit group
that researches policy issues affecting low-income people, said Bush
took ``a step in the right direction'' by requiring Medicaid
coverage for pregnant women and infants at 30 percent higher than
the poverty level, up from the poverty level, and expanding
immunization coverage for children.
   But Ellen Nissenbaum, legislative director of the center, said
Bush would be placing a heavier burden on states, which besides
paying for half the costs of the expansion would also have to pick
up a larger share of the administrative costs of the program.
   ``States, which administer Medicaid, would end up having to make
other cuts in Medicaid protection for poor children and their
families in order to finance Bush's Medicaid expansions, unless
states were willing to pump significantly more money of their own
into the program,'' she said.
   Spending on AIDS research and educational programs would rise 13
percent to $1.4 billion next year, not enough to satisfy AIDS
activists, who noted that the Department of Health and Human
Services last year proposed $1.9 billion for AIDS research and
education.
   The Reagan administration said reported cases of the fatal
disease in this country are expected to reach 365,000 by the end of
1992 _ with 80,000 new cases and 65,000 deaths projected for that
year alone.

<HEAD>State Department Would Warn Everyone, not Just Employees</HEAD>

   The State Department will make sure any airline
travel warning issued to government employees because of terrorist
threats will also go to the general public, a department official
told Congress.
   L. Paul Bremer, ambassador-at-large for counterterrorism, told
the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday the American embassy
in Moscow violated policy in posting a warning about Pan American
flights from Frankfurt to the United States.
   The warning, which was not made public, came eight days before
270 people died in Scotland when a bomb exploded aboard Pan Am
Flight 103, which was headed for New York from Frankfurt after a
plane change in London.
   ``It is not our policy to alert government officials and not the
general public to such a threat,'' Bremer said at the second
congressional hearing of the day on efforts to combat air terrorism
after the Dec. 21 downing of the Boeing 747.
   ``There is, and can be, no double standard,'' he said.
   On Dec. 13, a notice was posted on the bulletin board of the
Moscow embassy disclosing the threat and advising embassy personnel
they could decide ``on altering personal travel plans or changing to
another American carrier.''
   Bremer said the threat, which came in a call to the embassy in
Helsinki and was relayed to embassies and the airline by the Federal
Aviation Administration, was later determined to be a hoax and only
a ``gruesome coincidence'' in light of the still unsolved bombing of
Flight 103.
   The official said it is not State Department policy ``to
selectively alert people to terrorist threats.''
   ``If we have a credible and specific terrorist threat to an
airline which cannot be countered effectively on the spot, then our
policy is to recommend that the airline cancel the flight,'' he said.
   He said if that is mpossible, ``we would issue a public travel
advisory to the American traveling public.''
   Asked why the embassy posted the Dec. 13 notice, Bremer said,
``It should not have been posted.'' He said embassy officials later
said they found the policy on warnings ``not as clear as we thought
it was.''
   Relatives of people killed in the explosion told the House
Science, Space and Technology's subcommittee on transportation that
the government must do more to alert passengers to terrorist threats
and in installing sophisticated equipment to detect explosives and
weapons.
   ``I bring no particular expertise to this committee other than
possibly sadness, grief and tears,'' said Robert P. Berrell, an
automobile dealer from Fargo, N.D., whose 20-year-old son, Steven, a
student at Syracuse University, was among those killed in the crash.
   ``When threats as specific as this are received, interested
passengers must be notified,'' Berrell said.
   Several other victims' relatives sat in the audience. The parents
of nine students who died in the explosion gave a letter to the
committee asking, ``Why weren't the passengers and their families
warned? Why didn't airline security detect the bomb?''
   Bremer, who testified at both hearings, said FAA officials have
told him an average of three bomb threats are received daily by
American airlines and airports.
   Announcing all of the threats, he said, would ``encourage
copy-cat terrorist threats,'' would ``cause panic and disruption''
and would eventually not be believed by the public.

   Here are some facts and figures on Jamaica:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Jamaica, nearly the size of the state of Connecticut,
is the third largest in the Caribbean after Cuba and Hispaniola,
which is shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti. About 550 miles
south of Miami, the island has mountains, lush tropical vegetation
and fine beaches.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ About 80 percent of Jamaica's 2.4 million people are
black, mostly descended from African slaves. The remainder are
white, Chinese, East Indians or of mixed ancestry. English is the
official language, but Caribbean patois is widely spoken.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Jamaica exports bauxite, aluminum, sugar cane and
rum, primarily to the United States, Canada and Britain. It has a
flourishing underground economy in marijuana. Its primary income
comes from the $600 million tourism industry, which has bounced back
since Hurricane Gilbert struck in September, killing 45 people and
causing $1 billion in damage.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Christopher Columbus visited Jamaica in 1494, and the
island was ruled by Spain until the British seized it in 1655. In
1962, Jamaica was declared independent.
   In the 1970s, Michael Manley led a pro-Cuban socialist
government, but the election of conservative Edward Seaga as prime
minister in 1980 brought closer U.S. relations and business ties.
Jamaica took part in the October 1983 invasion of Grenada.
   Manley's party, espousing sharply moderated views in particular
toward the United States, swept to victory Thursday.

   Those who met him say Yu Kikumura entered the
United States with an easygoing manner, clean-cut looks and a ready
smile, a world away from anyone's image of an international
terrorist.
   As he traveled the country in a strange, month-long odyssey,
staying in campgrounds and inns and shopping at K marts, the quiet,
36-year-old Japanese visitor left few clues that he might have been
something other than an ordinary tourist.
   ``Looking back now I can see a few strange things, like he said
he was a tourist but I never saw a camera,'' recalled Chris Brande,
a Manhattan accountant who rented half his apartment to Kikumura.
   ``He giggled and smiled and stuff, and joked about getting a
parking ticket,'' Brande said Thursday in an interview with The
Associated Press. ``Once he left, I never thought I would have heard
of him again.''
   Brande didn't until last April 12, when police and FBI agents
showed up at his apartment to question him about Kikumura, who had
been arrested earlier in the day on the New Jersey Turnpike with
three powerful homemade bombs in his car.
   Kikumura, now long-haired and wearing a beard down to his chest,
was sentenced Tuesday to 30 years in prison on explosives and
weapons charges, as well as carrying false documents. Prosecutors
said he was planning to bomb a Navy recruiting center in New York as
part of a Libyan-sponsored campaign of terrorism.
   The Japanese Foreign Ministry identifies Kikumura as a member of
the notorious Japanese Red Army terrorist group. U.S. prosecutors
say he received terrorist training in Lebanon's Bekka Valley.
Kikumura and his lawyers deny the allegations.
   During his short stay in the United States, Kikumura traveled
with a wad of cash on a 7,000-mile trek to buy parts for the bombs
he would build. His travels apparently were financed in part by
money drawn from a Swiss bank account.
   Investigators used receipts found in Kikumura's car to piece
together his movements in the month before his arrest. His travels
took him to roadside motels through America's heartland, across its
colonial byways and into the Bible Belt.
   The documents show he spent time in Massachusetts, New York, New
Jersey, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky,
West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Along the way, he bought such items
as gas cans, a diet scale, flash bulbs, electrical wire and tape,
glue and fire extinguishers.
   ``The materials he bought to make the bombs are most always used
for legitimate purposes,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney John P.
Lacey, who helped prosecute the case against Kikumura. ``And when he
traveled around to buy the different materials, it decreased the
risk of somebody piecing together what he was doing.''
   Kikumura's favorite store was K mart, authorities said.
   ``Turn Mr. Kikumura loose near a K mart and a sporting goods
store and in a matter of hours, literally, he can make what was
found in his car today,'' said U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr.
   Authorities say Kikumura arrived at New York's Kennedy
International Airport last March 8 after using a stolen and altered
passport to travel through Italy, France and Switzerland.
   Within a week, he had purchased a used Mazda 626 from a car
dealer in the Bronx and set out on his tour, staying mostly at
smaller inns and bed-and-breakfast houses in out-of-the-way towns.
   He didn't make his first known bomb-parts purchase until March
30, when he stopped in an art supply store in Nashville, Tenn., to
buy two cans of aluminum powder.
   The next day he went to a K mart in Lexington, Ky., and in two
visits bought gas cans, a diet scale, coffee-maker accessories,
glue, contact cement, electrical wire and electrical tape.
   In Huntington, W.Va., he bought a toggle switch, circuit tester,
phone jacks, phone plugs and wire. In one interstate shopping spree,
he stopped in several stores to buy sealing tape, flash bulbs,
batteries and at least one fire extinguisher.
   Twice during his travels he stayed at Carmen and Herbert Brown's
campground in Huntington. At one point, the Browns noticed bandages
on his face and thought he had been in a fight; prosecutors believe
he was injured in a minor explosion while mixing combustible
materials.
   ``I thought he had been in a scrap and we don't want those kind
of people around here,'' Brown said. ``I never thought then that he
was a darned Communist terrorist.''
   Prosecutors said Kikumura intended to blow up the Navy
recruitment center in lower Manhattan on April 14, 1988, exactly two
years after a U.S. air attack on Libya.
   But Kikumura, in broken and heavily accented English, said during
his sentencing hearing that the charges were trumped up.
   ``The United States had fabricated (a) story about Libya in order
to justify its own attacks against Libya. These attacks have
violated international law and have caused the deaths of Libyan
civilians not guilty of any crime or acts against the United States.
So I denounce these illegal and immoral acts of state terrorism,''
he said.
   According to prosecutors, Kikumura planned to leave the United
States the day after the bombing. Flight schedules were found in his
car.
   ``He was stopped from carrying out his plot only by luck,'' Alito
said, ``only by good luck.''

   President Bush's call for environmental action
including suspension of some offshore oil leasing and increased
anti-pollution measures has heartened environmental activists but
left them looking for the fine print.
   The president's budget message Thursday night was long on pledges
of concern for environmental protection, and contained a number of
initiatives:
   _Re-examination of offshore oil drilling projects in Florida and
California.
   _$206 million worth of new recreation land acquisitions.
   _$120 million in fiscal 1990 to curb acid rain through the Clean
Coal Technology Program, roughly $25 million more than proposed by
the Reagan administration.
   _A $64 million increase for coordinated federal water quality
programs in four agencies.
   _Stricter enforcement and fines on producers of hazardous waste,
but no Superfund money for toxic waste cleanup beyond the $175
million increase outlined in Reagan's fiscal l990 budget submitted
last month.
   Bush left several specifics unanswered, and he failed to back off
one of the environmental community's top priorities _ oil
exploration in the vast Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
   Representatives of several environmental groups said they were
inclined to welcome the improvement over former President Reagan's
proposal, but were wary of vague wording.
   ``Reagan was so abysmal that it's making it easier for Bush to
come across as an environmentalist,'' said Ben Beach, spokesman for
the Wilderness Society.
   One of the most positive proposals from the environmentalists'
point of view was the postponement of lease sales for oil drilling
off Northern and Southern California and Southern Florida pending
review of environmental effects by a task force Bush will set up.
   Under Reagan, preparations for leasing were already under way in
all three areas Bush singled out. The former Texas oilman said he is
committed to continuing the sale of oil and natural gas leases if
they are ``prudent and environmentally sound.''
   The president said lease sales along the California coast north
from Mendocino County, which were scheduled for later this year,
would be ``indefinitely postponed'' as would a sale off southern
Florida.
   Lease sales for tracts scattered off Southern California from San
Luis Obispo to the Mexican border, scheduled for l990, also would be
delayed pending task force review.
   ``Should the task force report indicate significant adverse
environmental effects that have not been previously identified, a
decision will be made to delay further or cancel the sale,'' Bush's
budget message said.
   That brought criticism from Michael Fischer, director of the
Sierra Club, who said the environmental hazards are already
sufficiently documented to block drilling.
   He also said if Bush does not see enough environmental reasons to
keep the Arctic refuge from being leased, ``There ought to be no
cause for relaxation on the part of Californians'' trying to protect
their coastline.
   David Hawkins, air quality specialist for the National Resources
Defense Council, said Bush did not specify specific tonnage of
emissions to be decreased when he called for ``significant
reductions'' in industrial emissions that cause the problem.
Arguments on that point have been central to blocking a solution to
acid rain.
   He also said an emphasis on clean coal efforts and innovations
could distract from timely removal of acid rain pollutants from the
air, he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Off Sharply, Stocks Set New High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar closed sharply lower today against
the Japanese yen, while stock prices rebounded after early losses to
set a record high for the sixth consecutive day of trading.
   The dollar closed at 127.65 yen, down 1.74 yen from Thursday's
close of 129.39 yen. The U.S. currency opened at 127.80 yen and
traded at 127.30-128.10 yen.
   Traders ascribed the dollar's slide to its overnight drop on
foreign markets.
   Japanese Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama told reporters today he
considered the new dollar level stable, indicating monetary
authorities are pleased with the currency's retreat.
   A dealer with the Bank of Tokyo said there was no fresh incentive
from President Bush's budget address, which was delivered late this
morning Tokyo time.
   Bush, making his first appearance before the Congress, proposed a
$1.16 trillion budget for fiscal 1990 that he said would hold down
the nation's budget deficit to $91.1 billion.
   The budget was also designed to increase money for social
programs while freezing defense spending for a year, said Bush,
pledging to work hard with Congress to put America's fiscal house in
order.
   ``The president will have to carry (his pledges) through a
difficult period ... with the U.S. economy predicted to slow down in
1990 and a growing concern over inflation likely during the first
half of this year stemming from high (U.S.) interest rates,'' said
Nobuyuki Ueda, a senior economist at the Japan Long-Term Credit Bank.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues gained 53.56 points, or 0.16 percent, to finish the
week at 32,131.99, a new high. The Nikkei index shed 46.36 points
during the morning session but gained toward the end of trading. It
closed at a 32,078.43-point record high Thursday.
   ``Following an overnight fall on Wall Street, investors had some
concern over the index's continued rise during the morning session
but they came back with a strong buying drive toward the end of the
day,'' said a dealer at a major Japanese brokerage, who requested
anonymity.
   Analysts say low interest rates in Japan, steady expansion of
domestic demand and relative stability in exchange rates are pushing
stock prices higher.

   President Bush's $1.16 trillion spending plan
makes a down payment on his campaign promises but leaves unanswered
many important questions about how to pay for a cleaner and
better-educated America.
   Unlike President Reagan, Bush didn't face a requirement to submit
a full budget to Congress spelling out precisely how every dollar
would be spent and what programs would be cut to reach the deficit
targets.
   Instead, he offered a 193-page outline of his priorities which
went into some detail on his spending increases for education, the
homeless, the fight against drugs and cleaning up the environment.
   However, the budget was a good deal less specific about where he
would make cuts to finance the increases. In the case of the
Pentagon, Bush called for a reduction of $2.6 billion in spending,
but provided few specifics about what military programs would come
under the knife. Instead, he proposed a 90-day study by his National
Security Council.
   In other areas, Bush tacitly embraced many of the program
eliminations Reagan has repeatedly sought over the years, although
Bush said he was willing to consider other ways to save the money
which might be suggested in negotiations with Congress.
   In broad outlines, the Bush budget envisions collecting $1.069
trillion in the fiscal year which begins next Oct. 1 and spending
$1.160 trillion, leaving a deficit of $91.1 billion.
   Bush upped the deficit estimate for the current year to $163.3
billion, $1.8 billion higher than Reagan's budget estimated just a
month ago, in part because of the worsening savings and loan crisis.
   Bush's deficit projection for next year would be well within the
Gramm-Rudman law's target of $100 billion. However, most of the
cushion comes from sales of government assets, which can't be
counted toward meeting the deficit targets, and a highly
controversial cut in the tax on capital gains, which Bush claims
will make, not lose, money for the government.
   Bush's first budget projects that the deficit will be eliminated
by 1993, when he estimates the government will enjoy a $3.8 billion
budget surplus. But that forecast relies on optimistic assumptions
about the performance of the economy which many private analysts
believe are highly improbable.
   Bush did not propose any new general tax increase, but in what
some might consider a violation of his no-new-taxes pledge, he did
recommend continuing two taxes that are scheduled to expire or
decline _ the 3 percent federal tax on local and long distance
telephone calls and the 8 percent tax on airline tickets.
   Many of the promises Bush made during his long campaign for the
White House were reflected in his budget blueprint. To wit:
   _Increases in education spending to boost by one-third the number
of 4-year-olds enrolled in Head Start, to provide $30 million as a
down payment toward an eventual $500 million-a-year program of
grants to reward excellence in schools and to provide smaller
amounts for funding of new awards programs for teachers and
students. However, Bush's overall spending for education still would
not keep up with inflation.
   _A new tax credit of up to $1,000 per child under age 4 that
would go to working poor families with infants and toddlers and a
separate tax deduction of up to $3,000 for families who adopt
children.
   _Increased support for the war on drugs, pushing federal spending
to $5.5 billion in 1990. The increases would include a 24 percent
jump in spending for drug treatment.
   _Increased spending to fight acid rain, clean up ocean pollution
and purchase park lands, all in support of Bush's drive to protect
the environment.
   _Full funding of the McKinney Act to provide housing for the
homeless, increasing outlays from a projected $500 million this year
to $644 million in 1990.
   _Rejection of Reagan's proposed $1.7 billion cut in the Medicaid
health program for the poor. But Bush also accepted Reagan's plan to
cut $5 billion from Medicare, the insurance program for the elderly.
   _Also rejected was a Reagan proposal to save $828 million by
cutting the school lunch program and raising $394 million by
charging veterans higher fees when they took out VA mortgages.
   Bush kept Reagan's proposed reductions in farm subsidy programs,
and retained Reagan's proposals for a freeze in 1990 pension
payments to retired civil servants. For 1991 and beyond, the
president proposed limiting government retirees' cost-of-living
raises to 1 percentage point below inflation. Currently, they get
the full inflation increase.
   In reacting to Bush's proposals, Democrats in Congress voiced
strong opposition to the proposed cut in the capital gains tax,
which they branded as a giveaway to the wealthy. They also
complained about the lack of specifics in many parts of Bush's
budget.
   ``Unfortunately, President Bush gave us a minimum down payment on
his `kinder, gentler America,' with no clear indication of how he
intends to make the necessary annual payments,'' said Senate Budget
Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn.
   But Richard Darman, Bush's budget director, said the president is
willing to negotiate with Congress.
   ``We are not claiming to have solved all the problems,'' Darman
said. ``This is an extremely credible beginning. (Bush) is saying he
is ready to negotiate. He doesn't expect it to be found 100 percent
acceptable.''

   Here is information about the jurors in Oliver
North's trial. They were chosen from a pool of 45 people, all of
whom said under questioning that they knew little or nothing of him.
   Caswell Gilbert Hartridge, 61, tow-truck driver who says that in
connection with North and the Iran-Contra affair, ``Whatever I heard
I didn't understand.''
   Lisa Krishawn Brooks, 20, a clerk typist at the U.S. Department
of Labor, who said that ``the front page is the last thing I look
at'' and that she changes channels when the news is on television.
At the time North was testifying on Capitol Hill in 1987, she said,
she was going to clerk-typist school by day and working in the
evening.
   Ernest W. Nelson, 29, an electronics technician who works for MCI
and installs and maintains long-distance communications lines.
Regarding the Iran-Contra affair and North's congressional
testimony, he said that between headlines and TV ``I can't help but
see it,'' but didn't follow it.
   Tara Leigh King, 34, Xerox operator who said ``I don't remember''
anything about North's nationally televised appearance in which he
gave immunized testimony to Congress.
   Justine Newell Parrish, 39, worked for the Navy 21 years and says
the only thing she heard about North is that he was ``selling
weapons to the overseas people.''
   Deborah Gray Bell, 37, a statistician for the U.S. Labor
Department, says that when she reads the paper, she focuses on the
comics or the horoscope and wasn't interested in North's
congressional testimony.
   Earl F. Williams, 64, unemployed, a veteran of Patton's 3rd Army
in World War II, his last job was as a security guard and he
formerly was a messenger for the State Department. He said ``I sure
would try'' to be fair to North if selected for the jury and said
his knowledge was limited to seeing North's picture on the front
page of the newspaper.
   Jean I. Johnson, 53, a cashier with a husband who is disabled,
has a son who is a deliveryman for The Washington Post. North lawyer
Barry Simon, who lodged objections to selection of almost all of the
prospective jurors, objected to her being included because she had
read headlines and was therefore exposed to North's testimony.
   Helen Gina Lynch, a pathology lab technician at George Washington
University, said she heard that North ``shredded some papers ...
that's all I know.''
   Denise Anderson, 34, a clerical worker at a hospital, lives with
her mother whom she refers to as ``news media'' because she likes to
watch the news. Ms. Anderson, on the other hand, says ``I don't like
the news'' and when her mother comes to her room to discuss current
events ``I always tell her to get out.''
   Beverly Turner, a typist in the Army chaplains' office at the
Pentagon who worked for the government 17{ years. She says she knows
only that North ``is the head of soldiers that went to Iran or
something like that.''
   Patricia Bennett, 39, laid-off office manager of an advertising
firm, said she thinks she heard that North was ``selling something
to Iran,'' recalled something about shredding, but didn't watch any
of the congressional testimony. North's attorneys objected to her
selection, saying she read the paper and ``could not miss
headlines.''

   Now that he's experienced sunshine, grass and
trees, Willie B. will get a chance to learn about the birds and the
bees.
   The sheltered lowland gorilla, who spent 27 years caged up with a
spare tire and a television set, will be placed in a menage a trois
with two female gorillas from the Yerkes Regional Primate Research
Center, according to a deal worked out by Zoo Atlanta.
   It will be the first major social move for the 30-year-old
gorilla, who has only experienced outdoor life for less than a year.
He was moved into an outdoor habitat last year.
   Officials hope that, over the next few months, Willie B. will
learn how to relate to other gorillas and, with a little luck, make
his first addition to the world's ape population.
   Willie B. has been targeted for high priority breeding by the
Species Survival Plan of the American Association of Zoological
Parks and Aquariums, according to zoo officials.
   ``The SSP recognizes what an unusually fine specimen Willie B. is
and how nice it would be to see him again as a social animal,'' Dr.
Lester Fisher, chairman of the gorilla SSP committee, said recently.
   Zoo officials intend to start Willie B.'s socialization with
about 30 days of close visual contact with 26-year-old Katoomba and
6-year-old Kinyani, females who already reside at the zoo.

   Sam Worland-Esquith's participation in a
project to teach fifth-graders about small business led him to this
market insight: ``Kids seem to like slime a lot.''
   One of 13 young retailers at the Wardcliff Elementary School,
Worland-Esquith found that his product, slime, sold very well.
   And success didn't deter him from disclosing his manufacturing
secrets. ``I just mix cornstarch with water, add some food coloring,
put it in Zip-Loc bags, and sell it for 25 cents,'' the fifth-grader
said.
   Slime buyers got notes to inform parents that slime is non-toxic,
might stain, and should be stored in the refrigerator.
   With costs at $6 and revenue at $8, Worland-Esquith counted a $2
profit in the first wave of selling Wednesday.
   But he noted that private enterprise has its pitfalls.
   ``I don't think it's easy to make a good profit,'' he said.
``You've got to know what people want at the time and sometimes you
just aren't lucky enough to get customers.''
   Worland-Esquith wasn't really sure why slime was selling so well:
``Maybe it just seems fun to them to have something kind of gross.''

wear spawned by the television miniseries is raging in Houston.
   Western wear stores are being flooded with requests for hats like
the ones Gus and Captain Call wore in the movie, for coats like Jake
Spoon's and for spurs. And there is a stampede for copies of the
Pulitzer Prize-winning Larry McMurtry novel on which the CBS
miniseries was based.
   ``They want (Western) hats, spurs and dusters _ those
long-waisted coats,'' said Rick Cowen, manager of Stelzig's, a

   An error at the Internal Revenue Service has
delayed 450,000 federal tax refunds by a week, but the government
says the problem was corrected in time to get checks out after only
the brief delay.
   Ellen Murphy, IRS director of public affairs said checks for
those who filed in the second or third week of January will be
mailed Feb. 17, rather than Feb. 10 as had been planned.
   ``People are going to get their refund checks in the
four-to-six-week time frame that is typical at this time of the
year,'' she said Thursday.
   The problem, the result of a human error in running a computer,
was fixed before it grew to the proportions of 1985, when millions
of tax refunds were delayed for several weeks because of problems
with a new $103 million computer system.

   Financially-strapped Veterans' Administration
hospitals have had to raid supply accounts to pay salaries and avoid

   Top Iranian officials say their country
took ``too big a bite'' trying to defeat Iraq, and pointed to U.S.
intervention in the Persian Gulf as having tipped the scales in
their war against Iraq.
   In a series of unusually frank interviews with the official
Islamic Republic News Agency, President Ali Khamenei, Parliament
Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani and Chief Justice Musavi Ardebili also
said the Islamic revolution is still a long way from achieving its
goals.
   The comments on the Iran-Iraq war were the first by senior
figures to shed light on the inner workings of Tehran's military
planning and its eventual decision to accept the U.N.-mediated
cease-fire last summer after eight years of fighting.
   The interviews, monitored in Nicosia in recent days, came as Iran
celebrates the 10th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution with the
leadership divided over the country's future.
   IRNA quoted Rafsanjani, also acting commander-in-chief of Iran's
army, as saying of Iran's aim of military victory: ``We took too big
a bite.
   ``Yes, we wanted something, but were not able to get it, and that
was military victory. If we had moved with a bit more planning maybe
it would not have been so far off,'' he said.
   Rafsanjani is considered the second most powerful figure in Iran
after spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Ardebili noted that Iran suffered a severe jolt when the United
States and several European navies intervened in the Persian Gulf to
protect shipping from Iranian attack.
   ``We saw that the United States was prepared to send its navy
into the Persian Gulf and pull the world along with it,'' he said.
``We had not taken that into account.''
   He noted: ``I am among those who believe that the war should have
been stopped after the liberation of Khorramshahr.''
   The Iraqis were driven out of that southern Iranian port city on
the Shatt al-Arab waterway in 1982, nearly two years after they
invaded Iran following border skirmishes.
   The Iranian news agency did not say whether Ardebili indicated he
had opposed Khomeini, whose objective was to defeat Iraq and topple
President Saddam Hussein, in 1982 or sought to convince him to end
the war after the Iraqis were driven back across the border.
   But the remarks by Ardebili, Rafsanjani and Khamenei appeared to
indicate that some of Iran's more pragmatic leaders disagreed with
Khomeini's insistence on continuing the war.
   Tehran accepted a U.N. cease-fire resolution last July after a
series of battlefield defeats. The cease-fire took effect Aug. 20.
   Khomeini said at the time that accepting the cease-fire was
``more deadly than poison.''
   Ardebili said Iran accepted cease-fire resolution after the
Iranian leadership ``had done some calculations on our
capabilities'' after a series of Iraqi offensives that left Iranian
forces in disarray.
   Dissident Iranian sources have said that Khomeini had little
choice but to accept the cease-fire after Rafsanjani, Khamenei and
other senior officials and military commanders met in early July and
concluded that poor military morale and severe shortages of heavy
weapons gave Iran no prospect of winning.
   The news agency reported few comments by Khamenei on the conduct
of the war. But when asked whether the Islamic revolution had
achieved its goals, he was quoted as saying: ``It's true we have not
reached our destination and we might not even be halfway there.
   ``But we have started to move in the right direction and this is
very important. So the revolution can by no means be branded a
failure.''
   All three leaders agreed that it was time to analyze the
revolution and its objectives to prevent mistakes being repeated.
   ``We're still at the stage where we're trying to blame others for
our own sins,'' Ardebili noted. ``We have to get through this stage.
If we don't it will bring catastrophe.''

   Vicky and Bill Bates buried their young
sons side by side in twin white caskets, taking scant comfort in
knowing that the boys, inseparable in life, had died together when
they drowned in an icy pond.
   ``I know those little guys are arm in arm somewhere,'' Mrs. Bates
said. ``Everything Chad did, Adam did ... They always were
together.''
   The boys were buried Thursday, three days after drowning in the
pond on their parents' farm near Madisonville.
   ``It is not how long the blossom lasts,'' the Rev. John Meredith
said during the service. ``It's whether we loved it before it's
gone. And we certainly can say we did love these boys.''
   Family, friends and classmates from the Roman Catholic elementary
school which the boys attended wept quietly as Bates leaned over the
caskets to kiss his boys goodbye.
   Chad, 9, and Adam, 7, went out to play on the farm Monday after
being forced to stay home from school because of icy roads in
western Kentucky. They drowned after being in the pond about 35
minutes, authorities said.
   Mrs. Bates described her sons as excellent swimmers, but she
believes Adam, whose orange cap was found near a small hole on the
pond, fell into the pond while trying to skate on the surface and
that Chad tried to save him.
   Chad died late Monday afternoon at Madisonville's Regional
Medical Center, where his mother is a nurse. Adam, who would have
turned 8 today, died about 11 hours later.
   On Wednesday, she and her husband sat in their living room
looking at photograph albums filled with the boys' pictures.
   There were pictures of Adam and Chad on the soccer team that
their father coached, and photographs of the two in Halloween
costumes. One picture showed Adam watching as a proud Chad posed
with his first pulled tooth.
   ``Adam wanted to lose a tooth after Chad lost one,'' Bates said.
``I remember Adam pulled and pushed, trying to lose a tooth so he
would be like Chad.''
   Mrs. Bates dressed them alike until this past year, when each
began asserting his own individuality.
   ``They were about as close as brothers could get,'' Bates said.
``If Chad had a hamburger, he would give Adam half of it.''
   Bates went looking for his sons Monday after they failed to
answer their mother's call. He said that 15 minutes earlier they had
been playing near the barn where he was working.
   He jumped into the pond after realizing the cap on the ice was
Adam's. Mrs. Bates rushed to the pond to find her husband up to his
chin in the cold water, frantically searching for their boys.
   ``He was breaking the ice with his elbows,'' she said.
   Emergency rescue workers eventually pulled the boys from the pond.

<HEAD>Central American Officials Deeply Divided Over Human Rights Monitoring</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Senior officials from five Central American
nations disagreed over how to monitor human rights but were united
in asking for U.N. inspectors to make sure none of them supports
subversion against a neighbor.
   Foreign ministers and senior aides from Nicaragua, Honduras,
Guatemala, El Salvador and Costa Rica on Thursday wrapped up two
days of discussions aimed at reviving the Central American peace
plan of 1987.
   Nicaragua's foreign minister, Miguel d'Escoto, told reporters
Thursday's session was ``very successful.''
   In the discussions, the leaders attempted to set the agenda for
next week's meeting of the five presidents in El Salvador.
   Under the 1987 plan, the nations agreed to cease-fires with
rebels, amnesties and democratic reforms, including free elections
and respect for human rights.
   D'Escoto said Nicaragua and neighboring Honduras reached
agreement on ``general terms of reference'' on how human rights
should be monitored.
   They accepted Nicaragua's proposal that the Inter-American Human
Rights Commission verify and monitor human rights practices.
   El Salvador's foreign minister, Ricardo Acevedo Peralta,
supported forming a political commission composed of distinguished
Latin Americans to monitor human rights.
   Guatemala advocates that each nation found a commission to review
its practices and file quarterly reports, said its deputy foreign
minister, Ariel Rivera Irias.
   The ideas will be forwarded to the five presidents for
consideration next week.
   The officials on Wednesday asked U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar to send West German, Spanish and Canadian
inspectors to guarantee that no Central American nation shelters
rebels from another, or supports subversion in a neighboring country.
   Thousands of Contra rebels and Nicaraguan refugees are in camps
in Honduras near its long border with Nicaragua, which the
U.S.-backed Contras cross to launch attacks.
   The United States has accused Nicaragua of aiding leftist rebels
fighting a U.S.-supported government in El Salvador.
   The Foreign Ministry officials requested Latin Americans be
included in the U.N. inspection team, and told Perez de Cuellar they
preferred that the inspectors be unarmed U.N. military observers,
said a Nicaraguan official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Perez de Cuellar said he is considering sending military
observers, saying civilians ``do not have the necessary authority
for removing rebels from one of the countries.''
   Plans for the force have already been drafted, U.N. officials
said, and Spain, Canada and West Germany have agreed to contribute
observers.
   A technical group to plan the inspection force has been appointed
under the senior U.N. peacekeeper, Undersecretary-General Marrack
Goulding, and it will meet soon with Central American
representatives, said U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani.
   The force will have military and civilian branches, Giuliani said.
   The Security Council will eventually have to approve formation of
the military observer group, and D'Escoto and Costa Rica's foreign
minister, Madrigal Nieto, believed it would pass.

   Today's generation of affluent women between the
ages of 40 and 65 are confident and relaxed in contrast to the ``mad
housewife'' of the 1960s, according to a new poll.
   Ninety-five percent of the women who responded to the poll,
released Thursday, take pleasure in their lives and 94 percent
believe they can get what they want from life, now and in the future.
   Fifty-nine percent said they are experiencing the best years of
their lives, the survey said.
   ``Women of this age defy and debunk every myth about them,''
declared Lear's magazine, which commissioned the poll by Lou Harris
and Associates. ``The great majority believe they are richer,
stronger, more accomplished, more serene and happier than they have
ever been.''
   ``The portrait that emerges ... shows a confident, relaxed
generation of women _ in sharp contrast to the `mad housewife' of
the 60's _ who enjoy life and believe it is possible for them to get
what they want out of it,'' said the survey.
   The pollsters, using random-digit dialing, interviewed 701
college-educated women, ages 40 to 65, whose households earned at
least $40,000 a year. The nationwide survey, with a margin of error
of plus or minus 4 percent, was conducted from Aug. 30 to Oct. 3.
   The women reported that the best things in life are, indhey have sex
as often as or more
often than when they were younger.
   Forty-eight percent said they are more attracted to older men
than to younger men. But as women age, the attraction of older men
declines: Only 30 percent of women age 60 to 65 find older men more
appealing.
   The 17 percent who like younger men said the appeal rests in
energy and enthusiasm; only 20 percent of those women are attracted
to a younger body.
   The survey also found that 47 percent of the women said they
usually feel younger than they believe men their own age do; 11
percent said they feel older.

<HEAD>American Veteran Starts `Halfway House' For Amerasians</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A U.S. veteran who fathered a daughter
during the Vietnam War has started a ``halfway house'' in Vietnam
for the hundreds of Vietnamese-Americans who roam the streets and
dream of a new life in the United States.
   John Rogers, a 43-year-old businessman from Honolulu who spent
six years in service in Vietnam, said today he has rented space in a
downtown Ho Chi Minh City building and obtained official permission
to allow 40 Amerasians to reside there.
   More than 200 others, he said, would be able to use the facility
to take showers or rest from their lives as petty vendors and
beggars in the streets. The Amerasians have chosen two seniors among
them _ nicknamed Raymond and Charlie Brown _ to act as
administrators.
   ``The Vietnamese authorities are willing to go along with just
about anything these days to show they are on the good side,''
Rogers said in an interview after his most recent trip to Vietnam.
   He said city officials even gave him permission to buy a house
for the Amerasians, but the price was too high.
   Rogers said the single-room and adjacent bathroom facilities,
which he hopes to expand, would serve as a ``halfway house,'' giving
the street children a sense of some permanence before they are
accepted for entry to the United States. Most of the Amerasians he
has befriended have applied to leave Vietnam.
   Rogers said he first returned to Vietnam in May 1988 to find his
daughter, 19-year-old Gloria, and ran into crowds of other
Amerasians in Ho Chi Minh City's parks and streets.
   Rogers promised them he would to return and help.
   ``They were skeptical,'' said Rogers, who is fluent in
Vietnamese. ``They told me a lot of Americans had come and promised
to help them but all they did was take their pictures.''
   Rogers' daughter and her mother are scheduled to leave Vietnam
later this month and he said he would be returning again in March,
hopefully after having raised more funds to expand the project to
other cities in Vietnam.
   Rogers served in non-combat duty during his army tours. He met a
Vietnamese woman in 1969 to whom he is still married in the United
States; he fathered Gloria during a brief liaison.
   Unlike most U.S. servicemen, Rogers learned Vietnamese. On his
most recent trip he sang in the language at several Ho Chi Minh City
nightclubs.
   Since 1982, more than 5,000 Amerasians have departed for the
United States under a U.N.-sponsored Orderly Departure Program. An
unknown number of others have fled illegally since the war ended in
1975.
   U.S. officials say 8,000 to 12,000 remain in Vietnam, but other
estimates range far higher. Rogers believes as many as 50,000 remain
and recalls seeing a dozen Amerasians in a remote village near the
Cambodian border who had no idea that a resettlement program existed.
   Although Vietnam and the United States have no diplomatic ties,
cooperation has increased significantly over the past year on a
number of issues, including the Amerasians.
   Vietnam also has allowed private groups and individuals like
Rogers to initiate activities that would have been unthinkable a few
years ago when suspicion of outsiders ran high within the communist
officialdom.

<HEAD>Astronomers Discover Pulsar, Fastest-Spinning Object Ever Detected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Astronomers say they have documented the
creation of an extremely dense, spinning star known as a pulsar for
the first time, an insight that could change beliefs about how big
stars explode.
   The discovery, reported Thursday, confirms a theory that pulsars
are created by the explosion of enormous stars, called supernovas,
said Carl Pennypacker, a research physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory.
   The pulsar, a highly dense star known as a neutron star, spins
nearly 2,000 times per second, according to Pennypacker, who said
its speed is three times faster than anything researchers have
observed before.
   ``It's really phenomenal,'' he said, describing the pulsar as
``something that has the mass of the sun squished down to a
10-kilometer radius.''
   The discovery offers key information into what happens when a
supernova explodes, he said.
   ``It tells us about the birth of pulsars and the final stage of
big stars,'' Pennypacker said. ``It will probably change our sense
of what the (supernova) explosion mechanism is. I think it's going
to have a pretty profound effect.''
   Pennypacker, a researcher at LBL and the Space Sciences
Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, said the
pulsar emits light that creates ``sort of a searchlight effect.''
   The pulsar's creation was observed as part of an international
research project begun two years ago when astronomers first spotted
the parent supernova, named Supernova 1987A.
   Located about 170,000 light-years away from the Earth, the
explosion of Supernova 1987A was much closer than any other
supernova explosion in four centuries. Observers were able to watch
it with the naked eye for several months. Pennypacker called that
explosion ``probably the most exciting astronomical observation of
the decade.''
   ``We barely have an understanding of what makes these stars
explode,'' he said. ``They're neat because all the atoms in us came
from Supernova explosions. ... They're some of the brightest things
in the universe; ancients watched them.''
   When the big star's core collapsed in an enormous explosion, the
neutron star was formed, he said.
   The pulsar was detected inside the cloud of gas dust left by the
supernova in the Large Magellanic Cloud near the Milky Way galaxy.
   Speculation about how fast the pulsar would spin had ranged from
two or three rotations per second to Pennypacker's guess that it
would spin at a rate of ``at least 100 times a second,'' but no one
had come close to anticipating the pulsar's spectacular speed.
   The pulsar, which will likely keep researchers busy until at
least 1995, probably existed for about two years, but debris and fog
have obscured its presence, Pennypacker said.
   Astronomers in Chile gathered the first data that documented the
discovery Jan. 18, Pennypacker said, adding that a team of about
eight researchers has been interpreting the information since then.
   More observations are expected soon from telescopes in Australia
and Chile, he said.
   The team that discovered the pulsar included scientists from the
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, the Los Alamos National Laboratory,
the Las Campanas and Cerro Tololo observatories in Chile, NASA's
Ames Research Center, the Mount Stromlo-Siding Springs Observatory
in Australia, and the Universities of Oregon and Toronto.

<HEAD>Jail Release Considered for Molestation Defendant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) Raymond Buckey, one of only two defendants left
in the 5-year-old McMartin preschool molestation case, was a step
closer to gaining his freedom today after spending five years in
jail without being convicted.
   Superior Court Judge William Pounders, who has heard personal
assurances from some 20 people who posted their property to insure
Buckey's $1.5 million bail, said he likely would decide today
whether to release Buckey after hearing the results of the Los
Angeles County Counsel's investigation of bail security.
   The judge expressed concern that Buckey's five years in jail
already has exceeded the average sentence for a person convicted of
a felony _ and Buckey has not been convicted on the charges he faces.
   The 30-year-old defendant is on trial with his 61-year-old
mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, on charges of molesting children at
their now-defunct preschool in Manhattan Beach.
   Mrs. Buckey has been freed on $295,000 bail.
   Deputy District Attorney Lael Rubin, who has opposed Buckey's
release on bail, told reporters she still considers him a danger to
the community.
   ``There are a lot of people, parents of children involved, who
are concerned about his release,'' she said
   Buckey's attorney, Danny Davis, told reporters: ``Ray wanted to
say he'd not been in the company of so many friends in five years
and it has restored his faith in not only people, but the system.''
   Davis said a total of $3 million in property was posted _ twice
the bail amount required by the court.
   Pounders said Buckey already has served the equivalent of a
10-year sentence with time off for good behavior.
   Buckey and his mother are the last of the seven original
defendants in the case, which burst into the national media
spotlight in 1983 with lurid tales of mass sexual abuse, devilish
rituals, death threats and animal mutilations.
   Buckey is charged with 52 counts of molestation and his mother is
charged with 12 counts. Both face a combined charge of conspiracy in
the case, which stems from alleged abuse of 11 children at the
school.
   The case against the Buckeys has run more than a year and a half
in Superior Court.
   Five teachers originally charged later were cleared as defendants
when the district attorney declared the evidence failed to support
the charges.

<HEAD>Bush Comments Favoring Statehood For Puerto Rico Praised</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top official of a Puerto Rican
party that favors statehood for the U.S. Commonwealth praised
President Bush for calling for a referendum on Puerto Rico's future
in his address to Congress.
   ``It is the type of direct message we were expecting from
President Bush,'' said Pedro Rosello, vice president of the New
Progressive Party.
   ``When the president says he is in favor of the process and asks
for congressional cooperation, it gives a seriousness to the issue
which never before existed,'' Rosello said.
   In his speech Thursday evening before a joint session of the
House and the Senate, Bush said he favored statehood for Puerto Rico
but believed the Puerto Rican people should decide their own future.
   ``I have long believed that the people of Puerto Rico should have
the right to determine their own political future,'' Bush said.
``Personally, I favor statehood. But I ask the Congress to take the
necessary steps to let the people decide in a referendum.''
   Puerto Rico, an island of 3.3 million mostly Spanish-speaking
people, has been a U.S. territory since 1898 and a commonwealth
since 1952. Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, but they pay no U.S.
taxes and cannot vote for president. They are eligible for military
service.
   The island's three main parties are divided on its future,
supporting either statehood, commonwealth or independence. But they
united in January to ask Congress and the president to support the
results of a plebiscite.
   In the last referendum in 1967, 60 percent of Puerto Ricans
favored commonwealth status, 39 percent favored statehood and 1
percent voted for independence. The referendum had no significance,
however, because the results were not recognized by Congress.
   Puerto Rican leaders want congressional legislation to guarantee
the results will be carried out.

<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. magistrate refused to suspend
around-the-clock medical surveillance of the ailing wife of
convicted spy Jonathan Pollard, despite her doctor's contention that
it aggravates her problems.
   ``She has no dignity at all,'' Dr. Edward Goldberg said Thursday
of the 24-hour watch, which includes trips to the bathroom. ``I
think that is the added complication (to her condition). At worst,
it is punitive. At best, it showed either inexperience or
incompetence.''
   Anne Henderson-Pollard, who is serving a five-year prison term in
connection with her husband's crimes, is being treated at the
Federal Medical Center for gastrointestinal problems that have
reduced her weight to 90 pounds.
   In a lawsuit against the center's warden, Joseph Bogan, she
charged that she is being subjected to ``cruel and unusual
punishment'' because doctors have been ``deliberately indifferent to
her medical needs.''
   At Thursday's hearing, her lawyer, former Watergate prosecutor
Hamilton Fox, asked interim relief from the 24-hour watch. U.S.
Magistrate Jan Symchych denied the motion, saying medical opinion is
divided on the value of the surveillance.
   Symchych recessed the hearing until Feb. 16, when
Henderson-Pollard is expected to testify.
   The pale, 28-year-old inmate hunched over during the hearing as
the center's medical director, Dr. Martha Grogan, said suveillance
was needed because Henderson-Pollard's weight is dangerously low and
she has refused treatment.
   ``There's never been a patient who's been so uncooperative,''
Grogan said.
   Grogan said Henderson-Pollard has been examined by 22 Mayo Clinic
specialists at a cost of $55,640. She said the primary diagnosis was
``irritable bowel syndrome,'' a little-understood ailment associated
with chronic abdominal pain.
   Fox maintains that his client suffers from a more serious
gastrointestinal problem that has been exacerbated by a hostile
patient-physician relationship.
   Late last month, Jonathan Pollard, who is serving a life sentence
in a federal prison in Marion, Ill., launched a five-day hunger
strike to protest his wife's transfer from a Danbury, Conn.,
hospital to the Rochester facility.
   Pollard, 34, was convicted in 1987 of supplying classified U.S.
documents to Israeli agents. Henderson-Pollard was charged as an
accessory to his possession of the documents.
   She was transferred to Rochester Jan. 14, three days after she
collapsed at a prison camp in Danbury.

<TEXT>
   Returning to the chamber where he began his
political career as a House member 22 years ago, George Bush drew
his first cheer of his first address to Congress when he said, ``I
feel as if I am returning home to friends.''
   Eight times as vice president Bush had occupied the chair next to
the Speaker of the House, listening in silence as President Reagan
assessed the State of the Union and drew the cheers.
   On Thursday night there was another vice president _ Dan Quayle _
to do the respectful listening, to provide the dutiful applause.
   George Bush could, at last, look out over Congress assembled, the
Supreme Court, his own Cabinet, the diplomatic corps, and address
the nation and the world in his own right.
   It was his turn to set the national agenda.
   The new president's debut before Congress was interrupted by
applause at least 62 times, although there were times when lines
that appeared to beg for applause failed to attract any at all.
   The first cheers, the first standing ovation went not to the
president but to First Lady Barbara Bush as she entered the family
gallery of the House of Representatives.
   When his wife's moment was over, Bush took center stage and
promoted his programs, not attempting to match Ronald Reagan's
fabled charismatic style.
   Bush's delivered the address with a measured pace, his voice low
pitched and under control.
   He was applauded when he was tough _ when he pledged a billion
new dollars for the war on drugs, when he hailed the nation's police
officers, when he warned drug dealers: ``If you are caught and
convicted you will do time.''
   He was applauded for his initiatives on education and on the
environment.
   He was applauded when he denounced complacency, when he pledged,
yet again, that he plans ``no new taxes.''
   But when he asked for reductions in the capital gains tax, the
roar of approval from the Republican side of the aisle produced a
counterpoint in the distinct groan from the Democrats seated to his
right.
   While Bush's speech lacked much of the ideological pungency of
many of Reagan's addresses to Congress, there were other times when
the applause stopped abruptly on the Republican edge of the aisle,
leaving Democrats in frozen silence.
   That happened when Bush repeated Reagan's fervent wish that
Congress pass a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced
federal budget.
   And it happened with a vengeance when Bush, telling his audience
``don't take this wrong,'' called for an end to ``congressional
micro-management of our nation's military policy.''
   All cheers and clapping hands from the GOP. All silence and
folded arms from the Democrats.
   ``It seems there is a slight division on that question,'' the
president ad libbed, drawing a bipartisan laugh.
   One Bush line drew only a single pair of clapping hands.
   ``We must make use of clean coal,'' Bush said, to the applause of
coal-state Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.
   During the 49-minute speech Bush quoted Benjamin Franklin, a
distressed Pennsylvania mother whose son had become ``addicted to
cocaine,'' Abraham Lincoln, Sir Winston Churchill, Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow and a Chinese poet who, Bush said, once advised his
readers not to fear ``the simple words like goodness and kindness
and mercy.''
   The 41st president did not Reagan, at least not by name. He did
praise his predecessor for reversing the nation's course and said:
``I don't propose to reverse direction.''
   And he drew a low rumble from Democrats when he adopted, without
attribution, Democrat Jesse Jackson's 1988 campaign slogan, ``Keep
hope alive.''
   Still, although Bush carried on the spirit of conciliation he
called for in his inaugural address, there was a hint at the onset
that the administration and Congress may not be on the same path.
   The White House took pains to portray the speech as just a
speech, a look at the new president's budget priorities and not a
formal State of the Union address.
   But the House and Senate resolution authorizing Thursday night's
joint session said its purpose was to: ``receive a message from the
president on the State of the Union.''

<HEAD>Sihanouk Says Pol Pot Will Never Return To Power</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom
Sihanouk said today that Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot would never
return to power in Cambodia.
   The announcement came a day after resistance leaders called for
``national reconciliation'' between the warring factions of Cambodia
and issued a peace plan that they said would keep the Khmer Rouge
from returning to power.
   ``I solemnly declare that there is no question of letting Mr. Pol
Pot return to power,'' Sihanouk said in a statement.
   ``If one day there are elections held in Cambodia under the
United Nations, Mr. Pol Pot will not take part,'' Sihanouk's
statement continued. ``And after the elections, there will be no
question of giving Mr. Pol Pot a place in the government of free
Cambodia.''
   Pol Pot led the pro-Chinese Khmer Rouge during their bloody reign
of Cambodia from 1975 to early 1979, when they were ousted from
power by a Vietnamese invasion.
   During Pol Pot's rule, an estimated 2 million of Cambodia's 8
million people died from Khmer Rouge executions, famine and civil
unrest.
   Since the Vietnamese invasion, the Khmer Rouge have joined forces
with those of Sihanouk, Cambodia's former ruler, and Son Sann, a
Western-leaning politician, to fight the occupation.
   In a news conference Thursday, Khieu Samphan, who now leads the
Khmer Rouge, declined to disclose the whereabouts of Pol Pot. He
also refused to confirm or deny reports that China offered to let
Pol Pot live in Beijing as part of a settlement of the Cambodian
conflict.
   Under the resistance leaders' proposal, 2,000 U.N. personnel
would supervise the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops.
   A U.N. peacekeeping force would also be stationed in Cambodia
after the Vietnamese left to keep the Khmer Rouge from monopolizing
power, prevent a civil war and protect Cambodia from the possibility
of another Vietnamese invasion.
   The proposal also calls for the establishment of a provisional
government during the withdrawal that would include the three
resistance factions and the Vietnamese-backed government. General
elections would follow.
   The plan will be discussed during talks with Vietnam in Jakarta,
Indonesia, beginning Feb. 19.
   Also taking part will be Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
   Faced with a worsening economy, the Soviet-backed Vietnamese
government has said it will withdraw its troops from Cambodia by
September provided the four warring parties arrive at a political
settlement. Hanoi says 50,000 troops remain in Cambodia. U.S.
officials put the toll much higher.
   China also has agreed to cut its aid to the guerrilla factions as
Vietnamese forces returned home.

<TEXT>
   Here are highlights of President Bush's fiscal
1990 budget proposal, a revision of an earlier budget proposal
submitted by former President Reagan.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>BUSH BUDGET-REAGAN BUDGET:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Most of the $1.16 trillion budget remains as Reagan had proposed
it. That includes the unpopular proposal to terminate dozens of
domestic programs. However, the Bush plan calls for no increase in
the military budget beyond keeping up with inflation.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>SAVINGS AND LOANS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush budget revisions would include the $1.9 billion cost to
taxpayers next year of his program to bail out the ailing savings
and loan industry.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CHILD CARE AND EDUCATION:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   A renewed and expanded $3,000 tax deduction for adoption
expenses; a child care tax credit of $1,000 for low-income families;
increased spending on the Head Start preschool education program by
$149 million; a new merit award program for schools and increased
subsidies for black colleges.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>HEALTH:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Bush rejects Reagan's proposed $1.7 billion cut in the Medicaid
health program for the poor, but embraces Reagan's call for limiting
spending on Medicare resulting in a $5 billion cut in what otherwise
would be spent. Increased spending for the battle against drug abuse
and for AIDS research.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>FLEXIBLE FREEZE:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Most budget items left over from Reagan would be lumped together
in Bush's ``flexible freeze'' as he invites Congress to join him in
setting national priorities for increasing or decreasing specific
areas. He nonetheless uses the sum of those Reagan cuts in
contending that he, too, would meet deficit-reduction goals.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>DEFICIT:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush budget document says the federal deficit would be
reduced to less than $91.1 billion next year, just slightly lower
than the $92.5 billion in Reagan's proposal. The Gramm-Rudman law
sets a $100 billion deficit limit in 1990.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CAPITAL GAINS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Reduce the tax rate on capital gains to as low as 15 percent for
productive assets held more than two years. That's less than half
the current maximum.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>SOCIAL SECURITY:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Social Security is untouched by the budget plan.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>DRUG WAR:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Bush proposes increasing spending by almost $1 billion over this
year for a total of $5.5 billion, $236 million more than Reagan
proposed.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>ENERGY:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   More than $300 million in new tax breaks for the oil and gas
industry; allowing new drilling in selected offshore areas and in
the Alaska wildlife refuge.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>ENVIRONMENT:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   More spending on the Superfund program for toxic waste cleanup,
clean coal technology, clean water and wetlands programs, and a
greater emphasis on global environmental problems such as the
greenhouse effect. Adds $350 million to the $1.4 billion Reagan
sought for cleanups needed at the government's nuclear plants.

<TEXT>
   The daughter of James R. Hoffa, the former
Teamsters union leader presumed to be dead, has asked a federal
court to force the FBI to give her its files on his disappearance
13{ years ago.
   ``I think it's time the family knows what the FBI knows,'' said
Barbara Ann Crancer of St. Louis County. ``I think it would benefit
the public to know what kind of investigation was done.''
   Crancer, a lawyer, said in a complaint filed in U.S. District
Court that the FBI has twice denied her request for records under
the Freedom of Information Act. She asks the court to require the
agency to respond with her request under the act.
   Hoffa disappeared July 30, 1975, outside a restaurant in
Southfield, Mich., a suburb of Detroit.
   Crancer's complaint says she is seeking documents to help her in
her search for those responsible for her father's disappearance.
   Despite the 13{ years that have passed since Hoffa disappeared,
the complaint says, ``there have been no indictments, no trials, no
convictions as a result of the Department of Justice's investigation.
   ``Instead, the family of James R. Hoffa must glean information
from official and unofficial leaks made to the media.''
   In rejecting Crancer's previous requests for information, the
Justice Department has said the release of the records ``could
reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.''
   Crancer, 50, said she wanted to learn what information the FBI
had about the account of a nurse who saw Hoffa forced into a car
outside the restaurant.

<HEAD>At Autograph Auction, Jimmy Carter Gets Lost In Shuffle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Babe Ruth's autograph sold for $600 and first
lady Barbara Bush's went for $350. But former President Carter's
autograph couldn't bring down the gavel, even at a bargain price of
$75.
   ``No bid,'' the auctioneer said Thursday night at a Herman
Darvick Autograph Auction.
   ``Very popular president,'' one observer said sarcastically as
some of the nearly 100 people who crowded into a Manhattan hotel
chuckled.
   Oliver North was far more popular. An autographed copy of the
former national security aide's high school yearbook sold for $450.
The yearbook shows North with a printed quote: ``I am not only witty
in myself but the cause that wit is in other men.''
   Another big seller was a Greta Garbo signature on an amended
movie contract signed March 4, 1939. The document sold for $3,850.
   ``She has the most valuable autograph of any living person,''
said Herman Darvick, whose firm specializes in celebrity signatures.
   A signed Thomas Edison patent went for $7,700 and a Benjamin
Franklin autograph was sold to a doctor from Pennsylvania for
$11,000.
   The Babe Ruth signature was splayed across a photograph of the
Bambino shaking hands with an unidentified man in a business suit.
Two campaign-related letters by Mrs. Bush, on her personal red,
white and blue stationery, were sold as one item.
   An autographed picture of President Ronald Reagan and then Vice
President Bush sold for $750. But an autographed picture of Carter
with President Gerald Ford, another slow seller, went for $140.
   ``It's hard to explain,'' Darvick said of Carter's dismal
signature value. ``He's just not selling anything, in books, checks
and letters.''
   Actually, an item billed as a ``Rare Jimmy Carter White House
Card'' which was projected to bring between $700 and $800, did sell
_ for $150. The card bore a vignette of the south portico of the
White House and was signed in facsimile by Carter.
   But mostly, the Carter autographs drew silence, like lot No. 98,
an autographed copy of Carter's book, ``Why Not The Best?''
   ``Do I hear $75?'' asked the auctioneer. ``If not, we'll pass.
... Pass on 98.''
   Former President Richard Nixon enjoyed considerably more
commercial appeal, with a letter to a reporter signed ``Dick''
selling for $500.
   Darvick said John F. Kennedy has the most sought after
presidential signature, followed by Reagan and Nixon.
   ``Kennedy became senator in 1953. Ten years later he was dead. He
had machines that signed his autograph. He's very rare in
authenticated material,'' Darvick said.
   Referring to Nixon's Watergate notoriety, Darvick said, ``It's
like going to a wax museum. People don't want to see the presidents.
They want to see the ax murderers.''

<HEAD>Former Congressman Sets Sail For POW Rescue Mission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former U.S. congressman sailed today for the
South China Sea to launch about 1,000 helium balloons toward Vietnam
and Laos carrying messages offering rewards for American prisoners
of war.
   Billy Hendon and three relatives of U.S. servicemen missing in
action left the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club in mild weather on a
65-foot boat that once carried Vietnamese refugees to asylum in this
British colony.
   Hendon said late Thursday he plans to sail at least 200 miles
south of Hong Kong to encounter air currents that will send the
balloons to Laos and Vietnam, where he believes hundreds of missing
Americans remain imprisoned 14 years after the war in Indochina
ended.
   The balloons will carry messages that say in local languages:
``Bring an American prisoner to freedom and you will receive a huge
prize in return,'' Hendon said.
   He said anyone who can free and bring to U.S. custody an American
prisoner of war would get a $2.4 million reward, pledged by 21
members of Congress and others.
   ``This is no joke, we're spending a lot of time and a lot of
effort here,'' said Hendon, who previously traveled to Thailand to
float balloons with the reward offer down the Mekong River, which
forms the border with Laos.
   ``We're not here to argue whether POWs are still there or not. We
are convinced they are,'' he said. ``Our job is to help solve the
dilemma.''
   The U.S. government says it has been unable to prove that
Americans remain captive from the war in Indochina. But it says the
possibility cannot be discounted and investigations continue.
   The United States has criticized the reward offer as a hindrance
to official contacts with Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia to resolve the
fates of 2,383 Americans listed as missing in action. The Communist
nations have reacted angrily to the reward offer and have strongly
denied holding any Americans.
   Hendon, 44, a two-term Republican congressman from North Carolina
who was defeated in 1986, is a member of a POW Publicity Fund formed
by families of missing men and others to advertise the reward offer.
   Accompanying Hendon are Elizabeth Stewart of Washington, Bobby
Bischoff of Wilson, N.C., and Jeffrey Donahue of Cocoa Beach, Fla.,
whose fathers are among the U.S. servicemen reported missing in
action. The group expects to return to Hong Kong on Sunday.
   Hendon said he visited Hong Kong's Royal Observatory twice before
leaving to study weather data and acknowledged it will be tricky to
land the messages in Indochina during the weekend trip.
   ``It's sort of like shooting a basketball for a goal a mile
away,'' he said.

<HEAD>Network Presidents: SAG Strike Would Be `Devastating'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A likely strike this summer by the Screen Actors
Guild would be ``devastating'' to the networks, still struggling
with the effects of last summer's writers' walkout, the president of
CBS Entertainment said.
   The other two network entertainment presidents, Brandon Tartikoff
of NBC and Brandon Stoddard of ABC, agreed with CBS' Kim LeMasters
at Thursday's meeting of the International Radio and Television
Society.
   The guild contract is up June 30th, and a strike is considered
likely. Contract issues are similar to those that prompted the
24-week strike by the Writers Guild of America, among them the
amount of royalties received from network programs sold into
syndication. Movie production would also be halted if the actors'
guild called a strike.
   ``We think it would be tremendously damaging to the network
business if there was an SAG strike,'' said LeMasters. ``All three
networks are still reeling from the WGA strike. It is a business
where we are trying to increase and hold our shares, not have them
go down. ... I fervently hope that there isn't (a strike).''
   The writers' strike caused delays in the start of the networks'
1988-89 television season and is blamed for further defections in
network audiences to cable options and videocassettes. The three
networks' aggregate share of the viewing audience has averaged 68
percent so far this season, compared to 90 percent a decade ago.
   The three-network share rose into the 80s during this week's run
of CBS' blockbuster miniseries ``Lonesome Dove,'' which finished
14th on the list of all-time highest-rated network miniseries.
   The critically acclaimed miniseries was considered proof that
quality programming will still draw viewers to network television,
but the level of acting, writing and productions values is not
likely to be often repeated on network television.
   NBC's Tartikoff said studios and networks should start working
now to deal with the strike threat.
   ``I think the attitude on the part of the studios, and certainly
on the part of the networks is, we've got to get out there much
earlier than we did ... with the WGA, that we can't wait for certain
periods of negotiation and deadlines to be hit before we start to
take it seriously,'' he said.
   ``And I think the attitude is to start wrestling with the
situation now and not waiting until we get to June 30th, which is
the D-day date.''

<HEAD>Acid Rain Top Subject for Bush's First Presidential Visit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Canadians aren't expecting much in the way of
specifics toward resolving their dispute with Washington over acid
rain when President Bush visits Ottawa today.
   ``U.S. President George Bush is coming to Canada tomorrow, and so
are 8,767 tons of U.S. sulfur dioxide,'' said a comment Thursday in
the Montreal Gazette, illustrating Canada's preoccipation with the
subject. Sulfur dioxide causes acid rain.
   Bush's half-day trip for meetings with Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney will be his first outside the United States as president.
Officials of both countries portray the visit as a chance to get
acquainted and set the agenda for future dealings.
   Canadians believe Bush will do more than former President Reagan
did about acid rain. In his speech to a joint session of Congress
Thursday night, Bush said, ``the time for action is now.''
   He proposed spending $120 million in fiscal 1990 to curb acid
rain, roughly $25 million more than was proposed by the Reagan
administration. He also called for timetables to be set for the
curbing of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions, but didn't
announce any deadlines.
   The damage done in Canada by sulfur dioxide and other emissions
from the United States has been a sore point in relations for years.
   William K. Reilly, chosen by Bush to head the Environmental
Protection Agency, attracted widespread attention in Canada when, at
his nomination hearing in Washington, he said legislation to curb
acid rain would be ``first out of the box'' for Bush.
   Bush said in Washington on Thursday that his administration will
honor the U.S. commitment to Canada to spend $2.5 billion over five
years to develop technologies for cleaner coal production.
   Mulroney is in the early months of his second term. His
Progressive Conservative Party won an election Nov. 21 fought
largely on the free trade agreement he negotiated with the United
States.
   Parliament met briefly in December to clear the way for the pact
to take effect Jan. 1, and will begin its regular business in March
or April.
   The trade deal phases out remaining tariffs over 10 years,
establishes panels to resolve disputes and eases barriers to
investment and trade in energy and services.
   Opponents expressed fear that Canada would be overwhelmed by its
more populous and economically powerful neighbor. Bush and Mulroney
will discuss application of the agreement, but their main topic for
discussion is acid rain.
   Mulroney had sought a treaty requiring both countries to reduce
emissions of toxic fumes. Bush is not expected to be any more eager
for a treaty than Reagan was, but his willingness to submit
legislation is considered a major step.
   Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard said this week Canada wants
a timetable of six to eight years for reducing emissions.
   President and Mrs. Bush will spend four hours in Ottawa before
going to their home in Kennebunkport, Maine. Mrs. Bush's activities
will include a visit to a school and a tour of the new National
Gallery with Mila Mulroney, wife of the prime minister.

<HEAD>Report: PLO Leader To Attend Hirohito Funeral</HEAD>

   Palestine Liberation Organization chief
Yasser Arafat will attend the Feb. 24 funeral of Japan's Emperor
Hirohito, a Persian Gulf newspaper reported today.
   The Abu Dhabi-based Al-Ittihad said Arafat also will meet with
several Arab and foreign leaders in Tokyo for the funeral.
   The report could not immediately be confirmed.
   In Tokyo, the Japanese Foreign Ministry said it had not heard
that Arafat was coming or had asked to come to the funeral.
   Japan does not recognize the newly declared Palestinian state.
Therefore, the Foreign Ministry did not tell the PLO office in Tokyo
that it was welcome to send a national representative, which it did
for all countries having diplomatic ties with Japan.
   The Foreign Ministry said if Japan received word that the PLO
wanted to send a delegation to the funeral, such a delegation would
``not be treated as a governmental one.''
   Representatives of more than 100 countries will be present at the
funeral, including President Bush.
   Arafat was flying from Tunis to Riyadh, capital of Saudi Arabia,
where his elder brother Jamal died early today, the Palestianian
news agency WAFA reported.
   Jamal Arafat, 72, the Palestinian diplomatic representative in
Yemen, was hospitalized in Riyadh after suffering a heart attack
Thursday in San'a, the capital of Yemen, the agency said.

<HEAD>Group Files Petition To Impeach Judge Who Angered Homosexuals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A petition has been filed to impeach a judge who
said he gave a convicted killer a lighter sentence in part because
the man's victims were homosexual.
   The petition for impeachment of District Judge Jack Hampton was
filed Thursday with District Judge Ron Chapman, who also serves as
the state's presiding judge of the First Administrative Judicial
Region.
   ``Completing this action today represents a bold and courageous
step on the part of these participants _ many of whom earn their
living by practicing law in Judge Hampton's courtroom,'' said
William Waybourn, president of the Dallas Gay Alliance, which
coordinated the filing of the petition.
   Under the state constitution, impeachment proceedings may be
started with a petition from 10 lawyers who practice in the court of
the targeted judge.
   Two weeks after sentencing Richard Bednarski to 30 years in
prison for the slaying of two Dallas men, Hampton told the Dallas
Times Herald he gave Bednarski a lighter sentence because the
victims were ``queers.''
   ``I put prostitutes and gays at about the same level,'' the judge
told the newspaper. ``If these boys had picked up two prostitutes
and taken them to the woods and killed them, I'd consider that a
similar case.''
   In Austin, meanwhile, a coalition of civil rights groups
scheduled a rally today to demand that the State Commission on
Judicial Conduct remove Hampton.
   The judge's clerk said he was busy in a trial and not free to
comment when called by The Associated Press Thursday.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party members called on their
leaders to close the deep divisions in the ruling elite and use
today's Central Committee meeting as a springboard to social and
political reform.
   The official MTI news agency, in a brief dispatch, said officials
opened the Central Committee meeting and ``will discuss current home
political issues, to be presented by (Communist Party leader) Karoly
Grosz'' but gave no further details.
   The special session was called after a leading party reformer
touched off unprecedented debate with a startling reassessment of
the Hungarian revolt in 1956 against the Soviets.
   It also comes after a weekly party youth magazine revealed that
former Premier Janos Kadar repeatedly called the revolt a ``popular
uprising'' and urged Soviet troops to leave his country just three
days before they crushed the rebellion and elevated him to power.
   Kadar, who relinquished the party leadership last May, dropped
the offending term following the revolt, which began Oct. 23, 1956
with mass demonstrations for a new government and demands that
Soviet troops leave Hungary.
   The rebellion, however, quickly ended on Nov. 4 when 200,000
Soviet troops entered Budapest to quell the uprising.
   What happened in 1956 remains as important emotionally to
Hungarians as the Prague Spring reforms and Warsaw Pact invasion of
Czechoslovakia in 1968 is to most Czechoslovaks.
   The ideological debate over 1956 revived Jan. 28 when Politburo
member Imre Pozsgay in a radio interview termed the revolt a popular
uprising, contradicting what for years has officially been termed a
counterrevolution, or communist parlance for a concerted effort to
overthrow socialism.
   Party leader Grosz, who replaced Kadar, and other Politburo
members publicly disagreed with Pozsgay.
   But Pozsgay's statement has triggered a passionate debate that
has ranged beyond the uprising to include the pace and extent of
recent Hungarian reform and relations with Moscow.
   Last month, Hungary's Parliament passed laws legalizing
independent poltical movements and most demonstrations, and setting
an Aug. 1 deadline for a bill intended to legalize alternative
political parties.
   But party provincial members warned Thursday that such reforms as
a coalition government are in danger from party conservatives.
   The reform wing of the party's Csongrad County branch was quoted
as saying, ``The crisis of confidence among the party membership has
been reproduced, and the danger of a party rupture exists even
before attitudes are cleared up.''
   Similarly, the newspaper Magyar Nemzet quoted a party
organization of social science institutes in a Budapest district as
saying:
   ``What we see ... is that passions have been unleashed and in the
wake of this organizations have become stronger that endanger the
process of political reform and democratization.''
   Government spokesman Gyoergy Marosan warned Thursday evening that
the party must unite if the government is to improve the stagnating
economy and repay Hungary's $17 billion foreign debt.
   Marosan comments referred to increasing dissatisfaction over two
waves of price hikes last month and other austerity measures the
government says are necessary but which have slashed real wages and
prompted strikes by workers.
   This week's edition of Oetlet, a publication of the Communist
Youth Union, published the text of a stunning radio appeal made by
Kadar on Nov. 1, 1956.
   Kadar reportedly referred to the revolt five times as a popular
uprising, but an informed source said the speech was not published
afterward except in underground journals.
   Oetlet reported that in the same radio address, Kadar also said,
``Our people have proved that by shedding their blood they are
solidly behind the government's demand for the total withdrawal of
Soviet forces.
   ``We no longer want to be dependent. We don't want the country to
become a battle zone,'' Kadar reportedly said.

<HEAD>Jury Finds Anthony Quinn's Son Innocent of Assault</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Anthony Quinn's son has been
found innocent of charges that he beat his girlfriend, whom defense
attorneys depicted as a crazed woman like the villain in the movie
``Fatal Attraction.''
   Francesco Quinn, an actor whose credits include several
television roles and an appearance in the movie ``Platoon,'' was
acquitted Thursday of beating and assaulting his live-in girlfriend,
Carolyn Greenberg.
   The criminal charges stemmed from an alleged fight on Oct. 31,
1987, between Quinn, 25, and Greenberg, 24, who shared a West
Hollywood condominium.
   In his closing argument Wednesday, defense attorney Godfrey Isaac
said no beating occurred. He portrayed Ms. Greenberg as an
emotionally unstable would-be model who, like the female villain in
the movie ``Fatal Attraction,'' could not let go of a romantic
involvement.
   Ms. Greenberg alleged Quinn beat her on the arms, struck her in
the stomach and kicked her in the side as she cowered on the
bathroom floor of their condo.
   The injuries resulted in a ruptured spleen, which doctors removed
several weeks after the fight, according to testimony during the
trial.
   Isaac maintained that Ms. Greenberg was injured while riding a
dirt bike and, desperate over the failure of the relationship, she
lied about the cause of her injuries.

   An anti-apartheid clergyman
today denounced the ``vigilante actions'' of youths who served as
Winnie Mandela's bodyguards, and a newspaper said the body of a boy
allegedly abducted by the group had been found.
   The fate of the missing 14-year-old, Stompie Sepei, has been at
the center of the controversy surrounding Mrs. Mandela, wife of
jailed African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, and the
so-called Mandela United soccer team.
   Community leaders in Soweto have accused the team members of
abducting and beating four other youths who were living at a local
Methodist church. One of the four, Stompie, has been missing since
Jan. 1.
   The Weekly Mail, a prominent anti-apartheid newspaper, quoted an
unidentified Soweto activist as saying Stompie's body was dug up
Thursday in the black township outside Johannesburg. Police
headquarters said today the report could not be confirmed.
   Bishop Peter Storey, regional leader of the Methodist Church,
said that if Stompie's body had indeed been found, ``the worst fears
of the church and community have been realized.''
   Some of Mrs. Mandela's supporters have contended the four youths
were taken from the church to the Mandela home because they were
being sexually molested by a white minister, the Rev. Paul Verryn.
Methodist officials say they investigated that claim and determined
it to be false.
   The national leader of the Methodist Church, the Rev. Stanley
Magoba, issued a statement today saying church leaders ``noted with
anger and concern the vigilante actions'' of Mandela United.
   He described the allegations against Verryn as ``a transparent
attempt to divert the attention of both church and community away
from the ruthless actions of the `football team' and the
disappearence and possible death of Stompie.''
   The events ``point to an increasing lack of respect for the
rights and freedoms of people and a vacuum in leadership in the
townships through the detention of authentic leaders under the state
of emergency.''
   The African National Congress has asked Mrs. Mandela to disband
Mandela United.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said Thursday that police
were investigating all aspects of the controversy, including the
alleged abductions, the disappearance of Stompie and the charges of
sexual abuse.
   Vlok said police were wary of appearing vindictive against Mrs.
Mandela and expected difficulties finding witnesses who were
prepared to testify in court against her.
   Widely regarded abroad as an anti-apartheid heroine, Mrs. Mandela
has been entangled in several controversies in recent years. She was
criticized for authorizing construction of a palatial new home in
Soweto and for endorsing ``necklacings'' in which burning tires were
used to execute suspected collaborators.
   Last year, her home in Soweto was set afire by local high school
students angered by actions of Mandela United members.

   Michael Manley shed his bush jacket for
a business suit and replaced anti-imperialistic rhetoric with talk
of free enterprise in his successful bid to return to power.
   Before his party's victory in parliamentary elections Thursday,
Manley tried to show he had changed from the radical who nearly
bankrupted his country and was soundly defeated in 1980 after eight
years as prime minister.
   ``I think there are two types of people: those who won't learn
and those who try to,'' Manley told reporters this week. ``I try to
learn.''
   As prime minister in the 1970s, Manley catapulted Jamaica to the
forefront of the developing world's non-aligned movement. He forged
close ties with neighboring Cuba and railed against CIA plots and
capitalist domination.
   His policies and defiant words alienated the United States and
foreign investors, plunging Jamaica into economic chaos.
   Today, the 64-year-old Manley encourages foreign investment and
says he has ``abandoned all thoughts of nationalization'' and wants
private business to flourish. He says he would restrict relations
with Cuba to normal diplomacy and gives far greater emphasis to the
United States and Western lending agencies.
   As vice president of Socialist International, Manley says his
true philosophy is what he calls ``social democracy.''
   ``What I really am,'' he said in an interview recently, ``is a
hard-line democrat. But not Democrat vs. Republican. Democrat in the
sense that ... my abiding commitment is to the democratic process.''
   If less defiant now, Manley is still a powerful orator who can
stir a throng to near frenzy. They call him Joshua, after the Old
Testament prophet. Away from the crowds, he is a man of refined
tastes, wit and quiet pleasures. He spends much of his time on his
40-acre coffee farm in the mountains and jogs daily.
   The former prime minister is the author of seven books, his
latest a 575-page history of West Indies cricket. He watches
American football on television, reads spy thrillers and is ``an
enthusiastic but utterly indifferent bridge player.''
   But his ``real sort of secret passion,'' is classical music.
``For a long time, I've loved people like Shostakovich and
Prokofiev,'' he said of the Russian composers _ ``but not because of
where they come from, please.''
   He has been married four times and is separated from his wife,
Beverley. He has two sons and three daughters.
   Michael Norman Manley was born Dec. 10, 1924, the son of Norman
Manley, founder of his People's National Party, and his wife Edna, a
sculptor and artist. He was graduated from Jamaica College in 1943
and served in the Royal Canadian Air Force until the end of World
War II.
   He then took an economics degree at the London School of
Economics and spent a year working as a free-lance journalist for
the British Broadcasting Corp.
   On his return to Jamaica in the early 1950s, Manley got involved
in the trade union movement and was elected president of the
Caribbean Bauxite and Mineworkers Union in 1962.
   He was first elected to Parliament in 1962 and became leader of
his party in 1969, upon his father's retirement.
   Picking up the mantle of radical socialism, Manley led his party
to victory in 1972. He developed a warm relationship with Cuban
leader Fidel Castro and brought in scores of Cuban doctors and
technicians to build schools and train young Jamaicans.
   Soon, the firebrand Jamaican with the trademark bush jacket and
camouflaged ascot was a familiar figure around the world and a thorn
in Washington's side. Foreign investors fled and grocery shelves
emptied.
   In 1980, with the country at the edge of bankruptcy, Manley was
turned out of the prime minister's office by conservative Edward
Seaga in a landslide.
   Now, after eight years out of government, Manley considers
himself a wiser man whose top priority is ``a new beginning'' with
the United States and Western financial institutions upon which his
developing nation depends.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses to Let Guggenheim Reclaim Painting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Guggenheim Museum may not reclaim a $200,000
Marc Chagall painting it says was stolen 24 years ago and discovered
in a Fifth Avenue home, a Manhattan judge ruled.
   State Supreme Court Justice Shirley Fingerhood said Thursday that
amuseum officials never reported the theft of the 1912 gouache,
``Menageries,'' because they admittedly were embarrassed by its loss
and feared adverse publicity.
   ``The property owner has an obligation to use reasonable efforts
to locate its property,'' the judge said in a six-page decision.
``Plaintiff did nothing for 20 years except search its premises.''
   Museum officials said they suspected a former mailroom employee
had taken the gouache, a type of watercolor, along with four other
paintings but had no proof.
   Jules and Rachel Lubell bought the painting in 1967 for $17,000
from the Robert Elkon Gallery on Madison Avenue. It was unclear how
Elkon got it.
   When the Lubells tried to have the painting appraised in 1985, an
employee of Sotheby's who formerly worked at the Guggenheim
recognized the painting from an art dealer's transparency.
   That employee called the Guggenheim about the missing Chagall,
which has been valued at $200,000, and the museum traced the
painting to the Lubells.

   Roman Catholic officials in the United States
hailed a new Vatican denunciation of racism, saying it marks a
milestone in the church's assault on racial hatred.
   ``This is the first time for a statement of this magnitude,''
said John Carr, social development specialist for the U.S. Catholic
Conference.
   Carr said the document, released today, shows the connection
between different types of ``social racism,'' whether based on skin
color, religion, ethnicity or economic condition.
   ``Racism is a part of prejudice against foreigners, Jews or the
poor as well as against people of different color,'' he said. ``All
are linked in some way.''
   He said the document sees them all as ``assaults on human
dignity'' and to eliminate them calls for a ``change of hearts'' as
well as a ``change of structures.''
   The Vatican report, ``The Church and Racism: Towards a More
Fraternal Society,'' examines the history and causes of racism and
singles out specific countries for criticism. It said ``much still
needs to be done'' to combat racism in the United States.
   Several church authorities hailed the educational value of the
document and its potential impact on society, including its sharp
condemnation of South Africa's apartheid system of racial separation.
   ``This is particularly important at this time,'' Carr said.
   Eugene Fisher, director of the Catholic bishops' office for
Catholic-Jewish relations, said the document was ``the first
official church statement to link anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism,''
which it firmly condemns.
   ``This is very helpful,'' Fisher said. ``Anti-Zionism often is
used as a cover.''
   Regarding the document generally, Fisher said it ``seems to be
striving for a fundamental theory of racism in all its
manifestations and distinction'' as ``one of the fundamental evils
of our times.''
   ``It's the first document that attempts this kind of depth
analysis, putting racism into its larger context,'' he said. ``The
phenomenon of prejudice and animosities in the world have the same
dynamics.''
   ``Hatred is hatred,'' he added, whether directed at the poor,
blacks, immigrants, foreigners or other groups treated as inferiors
or outsiders.
   He said the new document should ``help expand the horizons of
Americans by its dynamics. I would like to see it become a
centerpiece of educational efforts in communities across the
country.''
   Auxiliary Bishop John Ricard of Baltimore, chairman of the
bishops' committee for black Catholics, called the document ``a
milestone.''
   ``It is the first time in my memory that the Holy See has
explicity singled out the issue of racism as a primary factor in
causing divisions in the human family, as a source of suffering and
threat to peace,'' Ricard said.
   Ricard, who is black, termed the document ``very comprehensive in
its breadth and depth,'' adding, ``I think it will be extremely
helpful to us and to our brothers and sisters in South Africa who
are under institutional racism.''

<TEXT>
   Military headquarters has denied a
claim that South African troops invaded Angola this week in
violation of a regional peace agreement.
   Angola's Defense Ministry, in a statement reported Thursday by
the Angolan news agency ANGOP, said South African troops penetrated
25 miles into southern Angola a day earlier in support of the UNITA
rebel movement.
   ANGOP said there was a clash in which the South Africans used
long-range artillery, but it made no mention of any casualties.
   South African military headquarters said in response that its
forces were strictly observing the peace agreement signed in
December.
   The agreement bars South African military support for UNITA and
calls for withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola, where they have
been supporting the Marxist government in the civil war. The treaty
also calls for implementation of a U.N. plan to bring independence
to Namibia, which South Africa has ruled since World War I.
   ``Allegations like this could have a detrimental effect on
agreements already signed,'' the South African statement said.
   ``Conflicts between FAPLA (the Angolan armed forces) and UNITA
should not be laid at South Africa's door,'' it said. ``The joint
military monitoring commission was established (under the peace
agreement) precisely to investigate such allegations.''
   UNITA was not party to the peace agreement and says it plans to
continue fighting.

<HEAD>Talks On Political Reform Begin With Government Foes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today began talks with two
longtime foes, tackling political reforms as part of a series of
negotiations aimed at legalizing Solidarity and signing a new social
accord.
   In southern Poland, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa urged 2,000
people in a rally to support efforts to reach agreement with
authorities.
   In Warsaw, Adam Michnik and Jacek Kuron, opposition philosophers
and essayists who have been active in anti-government organizing
since 1968, were prominent among the group taking seats at the
Council of Ministers Palace.
   Last year, the government opposed permitting the pair into the
proposed talks, but dropped the objections following last month's
Communist Party decision to seek an agreement with the opposition.
   In 1976, Michnik and Kuron were founding members of the Committee
for Defense of Workers, and Michnik's collected essays, ``Letters
from Prison,'' have provided much of the philosophical underpinning
for the Polish opposition movement.
   The broad talks began Monday, and working groups have been
meeting through the week on specific topics. The full negotiations
are expected to last four to six weeks.
   The group on political reform, holding its first meeting today
with 36 participants, will face some of the most delicate problems.
   The government has insisted that in exchange for legalizing
Solidarity again, the union agree on a package of political and
economic reforms, help draft a new law on elections and participate
in parliament and other official forums.
   It would put the opposition in the position of endorsing a
political system that guarantees communist domination, and some
opposition members are wary of being co-opted.
   In Krakow, Walesa tried to sell his vision of seeking a
compromise to the crowd at the 600-year-old Jagiellonian University.
   Walesa invoked a slogan that rhymes in Polish: ``Agreement
builds, disagreement ruins.''
   ``If you take the path of peaceful evolution, it will be a
revolution,'' he told the crowd, including many students, that
overflowed from a cramped auditorium. ``Let us give the (talks) a
chance. Let us not provoke, because then we will all have to pay.''
   Walesa spoke for 10 minutes, and spent another hour answering
questions from the audience. Earlier in the day, he met privately
with Krakow Roman Catholic Cardinal Franciszek Macharski.
   Later he was to travel to the industrial city of Bielsko-Biala,
site of Poland's small-car factory.
   Walesa met Thursday night with workers from the strike-prone Nowa
Huta steel mill, asking them to set aside the local grievances for
now in order to help regain Solidarity's right to function legally.
   A mediator sent by Walesa helped settle a strike Thursday by
thousands of workers at the Belchatow power plant in central Poland.
   But new signs of labor unrest appeared this morning when a strike
over wages declared by the increasingly militant official union OPZZ
crippled bus service in Piotrkow Trybunalski, a central Poland
provincial capital of 80,000 people.

   Two young brothers died after being scalded
by hot water in the bathtub of their housing project apartment in an
apparent accident, police said.
   Detectives questioned the boys' parents following the deaths
Thursday, but no charges were filed, police said. ``It just looks
like a very tragic accident,'' a homicide detective, Lt. James
Hansen said.
   Troy Ayers, 3{, and Kevin Wilson, 2, lived in the Queen Lane
Apartments with their mother, Sandra Ayers, 25, and her friend,
Kevin Wilson, according to Courtnay Bachan Cannady, spokeswoman for
the Philadelphia Housing Authority.
   A neighbor summoned housing authority police shortly after 10
a.m., Ms. Cannady said. She said the officers found the youngsters
outside the apartment, where a woman was trying to resuscitate one
and Wilson was holding the other.
   Housing police said the mother was not home, but The Philadelphia
Inquirer quoted police sources as saying Wilson and Ms. Ayers told
police they were asleep when the two boys apparently got out of bed,
went into the bathroom, climbed into the tub and turned on the water.
   In the steam-filled apartment, officers found a tub filled with
scalding hot water. Clothes, magazine and toys were floating in the
tub, Ms. Cannady said.
   The boys were pronounced dead on arrival at the Medical College
of Pennsylvania, hospitial spokeswoman Linda Lally said. The medical
examiner's officer ruled the cause of death as scalding.

   To the beat of heavy-metal rock music, two
teen-agers carved tombstones out of plastic foam, then shot
themselves to death in an apparent suicide pact, authorities said.
   The bodies of Phillip Gomiser and David Olive, both 15, were
found Wednesday night in a trash-filled field just west of here by
Gomiser's father, Phillip Sr., a spokesman for the Palm Beach County
sheriff's office said.
   Both teen-agers apparently died of self-inflicted shotgun wounds
to the head several days earlier, spokesman Bob Ferrell said
Thursday. They disappeared from their Lake Worth homes about a week
ago, taking along a shotgun from Olive's home.
   Their partially decomposed bodies were found lying beside plastic
foam tombstones etched with their initials and the letters
``R.I.P.,'' for ``Rest In Peace,'' Ferrell said.
   ``At this point, we're assuming that each one shot himself,''
Ferrell said. ``There was only one shotgun found. The sequence of
events may be something we can never determine.''
   Authorities, friends and family spoke of various things that
might have triggered the suicides: a divorce, the suicide death of a
classmate, heavy-metal music.
   Jim Cappello, a classmate of Olive's at Santaluces High School,
said the boys had talked openly of ending their lives since another
student at the high school committed suicide several months ago.
   Olive's mother, Eline, said said she had tried to find
psychiatric care for her son at various private and public agencies
but all had waiting lists.
   ``I felt he had serious problems, and I was doing the best I
could to get him some help,'' she said.
   ``He was depressed over family situations, a recent divorce and
separation,'' Mrs. Olive said. ``My son had ... over the past two
months not cared whether he lived or died.''
   Ferrell said a tape recorder with a Led Zeppelin tape that had
played itself out was found near the bodies.
   ``It appears at this time it was tied to heavy metal,'' Ferrell
said.
   But one friend said he did not believe that the music contributed
to their suicides.
   ``I listen to that same music,'' said Steven Swann, a
10th-grader. ``We just like the music, we didn't pay that much
attention to what it meant.''

   A man who killed his two children, doused
them with gasoline and died in the resulting inferno had dropped a
veiled threat in a conversation less than an hour before, his widow
says.
   ``I asked him why he was calling me at lunchtime because I was
busy,'' said Connie Bilbrew, 24. ``He asked me did I want him
anymore. I told him, `No.' He told me I wasn't going to see the kids
anymore. He then just hung up.''
   Within an hour after the conversation Wednesday, Bennie Bilbrew
had killed Benny Jr., 6, and Fecia, 5, doused their bodies with
gasoline and burned them and himself in a pickup truck outside the
hospital where Mrs. Bilbrew worked, authorities say. Police believe
the children were already dead when they were set afire.
   ``I was thinking he was talking about leaving with them. I didn't
think he was talking about that,'' Mrs. Bilbrew said.
   Police had said earlier that there was nothing out of the
ordinary in the conversation, and no suggestion that Bilbrew planned
to take his children's lives.
   Before the fire, Bilbrew had been keeping the children
temporarily for his ex-wife, whose electricity at her Jackson
apartment was out because of an ice storm.

<HEAD>Poll: 65 Percent of Israelis Accept Trading Land for Peace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About two-thirds of Israeli Jews would return
some occupied territory in exchange for peace, and more than half
want to negotiate with the PLO under certain conditions, according
to two polls published today.
   The results indicate that Israelis are more dovish than their
current leadership. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has repeatedly
said he will never negotiate with the Palestine Liberation
Organization, and the platform of his Likud bloc rules out
relinquishing the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Likud and Israel's other main political bloc, the center-left
Labor Party, formed a coalition government in December after
elections failed to give either party a clear mandate. Labor is
willing to trade some territory for peace.
   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from
Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   A survey by the Israel Institute of Applied Social Research
showed that 65 percent of 1,192 Israeli Jews questioned were willing
to give up at least a small part of the occupied lands.
   Of those, 17 percent wanted to return all or most of the
territories, according to the poll, which was published by the daily
Jerusalem Post. Thirty-five percent opposed any territorial
concessions, compared to 45 percent two years ago. The survey was
conducted in January and has a margin of error from 3 percent to 5
percent.
   The poll indicated Israelis resent outside involvement in
settling the Arab-Israeli conflict. Asked whether Israel should
agree if the United States exerts pressure on it to withdraw from
most of the occupied lands, 73 percent said no. The figure has
remained unchanged for the past 11 years, the poll said.
   Another poll, conducted by the Dahaf Institute in the first week
of February, found that 53 percent of Israeli Jews favor talking to
the PLO under certain conditions.
   Of that group, however, 38 percent said the PLO has not yet
fulfilled its promises of renouncing terror and recognizing Israel
and that talks should only begin when those conditions are met.
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat said in December that he renounced terror
and recognized Israel, prompting the United States to open a
dialogue with the organization.
   Another 15 percent of those polled by Dahaf said Arafat has lived
up to his promises and talks should begin immediately.
   Forty-two percent opposed talks with the PLO under any conditions.
   A similar survey conducted in December found 54 percent backing
talks with the PLO under certain conditions, and 44 percent ruling
out any contacts.
   Dahaf questioned 1,209 Israeli Jews. The poll has a margin of
error of 2.5 percent.
   Asked whether Arafat was sincere in announcing that he was
interested in peace with Israel, only 11 percent said yes, while 89
percent said no.
   In results published earlier by Dahaf, the poll showed that 77
percent of the respondents oppose the formation of a Palestinian
state, compared to 23 percent who favor such a state.
   The results indicated a slight thaw in Israeli attitudes. A
decade ago, 90 percent of Israeli Jews opposed the formation of a
Palestinian state.

<HEAD>Flu Season Hits Its Stride, With Possible `Epidemic' Levels</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The winter flu season has hit full stride from
coast to coast, and 1989 is shaping up as a fairly typical year for
the annual scourge, according to the federal Centers for Disease
Control.
   ``There have been numerous outbreaks requiring closings of
schools, and where everybody's feeling miserable,'' Dr. Robert
Cannon, a CDC viral specialist, said Thursday. ``I wouldn't feel
uncomfortable saying there is an `epidemic' of influenza. Of course,
there is every year.''
   Last week, for the second week in a row, the percentage of deaths
attributable to either pneumonia or influenza exceeded the expected
statistical standard for this time of year, Cannon said.
   In the first week of the month there were 982 deaths attributed
to the two illnesses in the 121 U.S. cities the CDC regularly
monitors. The agency does not compile separate statistics for flu
alone. During the same period last year, 820 people died.
   Flu hits its highest level during the winter months in the United
States, and the level ``has reached about as high as it was last
year,'' Cannon said. ``It's a typical year.''
   Researchers with the Atlanta-based CDC don't keep track of
exactly how many people have influenza, or ``flu-like illness,'' or
even pneumonia. What they do know is that states from coast to coast
have reported at least some confirmed flu cases.
   The 1988-89 flu vaccine, recommended by the CDC, contains
protection against three different flu strains seen late last
winter: the Victoria flu, the Sichuan flu and the Taiwan flu.
   All three appear to be back this year, with the Victoria flu seen
most frequently, Cannon said.

   The largest exhibition of avant-garde art in
China's history reopened today, five days after police shut it down
when artists defied a ban on performance art and a sculptor shot her
own work with a BB gun.
   The sculptor said she didn't regret shooting her work and that
finally the piece had been completed.
   ``It was something I had to do, but I didn't realize it would
cause such a stir,'' Xiao Lu, the 26-year-old artist, said in an
interview at the China Art Gallery. ``The piece needed to be
destroyed slightly to be perfected.''
   Ms. Xiao and her boyfriend, Tang Song, were arrested and spent
three days in jail after the incident. They were released Wednesday,
two days early, and the case has been closed.
   ``My speedy release is a good sign,'' Ms. Xiao said. ``The police
were very reasonable. They tried very hard to understand my
motives.''
   None of the 300 works of art were removed during the three-day
closure, although such a move was discussed, said Fei Dawei, an
exhibition organizer.
   Museum officials, however, ordered the organizers to hire about
20 security guards to prevent any more performance art.
   Fei said that if artists continued to defy the ban on performance
art the show could be closed again. He said museum officials banned
the art form because they said it might ``cause chaos in society.''
   ``Because this is the first nationwide show of avant-garde art,
they said it was too early to do performance art,'' Fei said. ``But
we will be doing it in the future.''
   Police closed the show Sunday after a series of performance art
pieces rocked the exhibition.
   One artist sold shrimp to protest ``the commercialization of
art.''
   Three others, wrapped from head to toe in white cloth, walked
around the gallery, bumping into viewers.
   Another took off some of his clothes and squatted over several
eggs.
   One strolled around the gallery tossing handfuls of change and
condoms on the floor.
   Museum officials ordered these artists to stop their performances
but none was arrested.
   Shortly before noon, Ms. Xiao and Tang entered the museum.
   Tang handed her a BB gun and she fired twice into her work,
``Dialogue,'' a glass-and-metal sculpture of a man and a woman
talking to each other from two phone booths.
   Ms. Xiao fled the museum but Tang was arrested by police. She
later turned herself in after spending most of the day watching the
museum from across the street.
   Ms. Xiao said it was significant that Tang helped her shoot her
creation.
   ``It was an artwork about communication, between men and women,''
she said. ``So I needed him to help me add a destructive element.''
   Even without performance art, the show is an impressive one,
covering three floors of the gallery. A variety of styles, from
abstract to expressionist to video art, are represented.
   In one corner, viewers surrounded a waterbed filled with dead
fish. In another, a crowd swarmed around three huge balloons, shaped
like breasts.

   Eight people have been killed by sniper
fire across Beirut's dividing Green Line since last week, police
said today.
   A police spokesman also said unidentified gunmen fired rifle
grenades Thursday night at two checkpoints manned by Syrian soldiers
in Moslem west Beirut, but no casualties were reported.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named in line with standing
regulations, said the sniper victims were ``civilians.''
   He said six of them were killed in Moslem districts on the
western side of the Green Line which has divided Beirut into
sectarian districts since the outbreak of civil war in 1975. The two
other victims were killed in Christian east Beirut, the spokesman
said.
   He said it could not be determined who was provoking increased
exchanges of sniper fire across the Green Line in the past two
weeks. The line is a traditional civil war front in Beirut but had
been calm for more than a year.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the grenade
attacks in west Beirut which apparently were intended to discredit
the Syrians' peacekeeping role.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, maintains 40,000 troops
in eastern and northern provinces as well as in west and south
Beirut under a 1976 Arab League mandate to end the civil war.

   Gale-force winds that turned to breezes
dramatically slowed the progress of the yacht Thursday's Child,
delaying its record-breaking arrival at the Golden Gate by as much
as a day.
   The racing sloop made such poor progress Thursday that
spokeswoman Nancy Lush said it would be ``miraculous'' if Thursday's
Child sailed into San Francisco Bay today.
   She said it would likely arrive on Saturday, still smashing the
world's oldest existing speed record by nine days. The ship left New
York on Nov. 23 in an assault on a 135-year-old record for sailing
around Cape Horn to San Francisco.
   The record for the 14,500-mile trip had been held by the
2,376-ton clipper ship Flying Cloud, which sailed in 1854 and made
the voyage in 89 days, 8 hours.
   At midday Thursday, the 10-ton Thursday's Child was 300 miles
south of the Golden Gate, making only 6 knots in unfavorable winds.
The position was about 60 miles west of Santa Barbara, west of San
Miguel Island.
   After hitting reported gale-force winds up to 40 knots earlier in
the day, Thursday's Child apparently hit shifting winds to the
north, forcing it to tack east and west in order to progress to the
north.
   Northerly winds for northbound boats on the West Coast always
signal a frustrating, time-consuming tacking drill, also tough on
the crew.
   The merchantman Flying Cloud, with its 17-story masts that could
carry 35 sails, was the marvel of its day. It was reputed the
fastest of thousands of sailing vessels that raced each other across
the Atlantic and Pacific, often with perishable cargo.

   Iran's chief justice today urged U.N.
officials to pressure Iraq into removing its troops from Iranian
territory.
   In a speech during Friday prayers at Tehran University, justice
Musavi Ardebili said Iraq is blocking peace negotiations by delaying
the withdrawal.
   Groups of Iranian servicemen in uniform were among thousands of
worshippers gathered for the prayer session. On Saturday, a rally
will be held on the 10th days of celebrations marking the Islamic
Revolution's 10th anniversary.
   Ardebili said that U.N. officials handling gulf war peace efforts
appeared to have ``caught a cold,'' and he urged them to ``show a
bit of firmness.''
   ``Can't they see who is the obstructor now? Who is the one who is
still refusing to retreat from the lands of others?'' the chief
justice asked.
   Iraq still occupies 260 square miles of Iranian territory seized
just before a cease-fire in the eight-year war took effect Aug. 20,
1988.
   U.N.-sponsored peace talks in Geneva that started five days later
have been deadlocked over the issue of troop pull-outs.
   However, Iran and Iraq's foreign ministers were to hold direct
talks today at the United Nations in New York with Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar acting as mediator, officials at the world
body said.
   Iran insists the Iraqi troops must be withdrawn as the next stage
in implementing U.N. Security Council Resolution 598, which both
sides accept as the basis for a lasting peace agreement.
   But Iraq says Iran must first give up its right to search ships
in the international waters of the Persian Gulf for war material
bound for Iraq.

   The United States said today it is committed to
ending apartheid in South Africa but remains opposed to imposing
further economic sanctions to achieve that goal.
   U.S. delegate William H. Marsh told the United Nations Human
Rights Commission that American laws ``imposed some of the world's
most severe restrictions on trade with South Africa,'' but without
significant results.
   ``Because of our experience, the United States believes the idea
of comprehensive and mandatory sanctions can contribute very little
toward achieving the abolition of apartheid, the fundamental goal we
all share,'' he said.
   Marsh spoke as the 40-nation commission discussed a U.N. report
that says South Africa's black majority overwhelmingly favors
sweeping economic, diplomatic and other sanctions as the most
effective way to pressure the white government to end racial
discrimination.
   Earlier this week, the U.S. State Department said in its annual
report on human rights worldwide that conditions in South Africa
continued to deteriorate last year because of greater government
repression of opponents of apartheid.

<HEAD>Officials Say One-fifth Of Byelorussia Contaminated</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet officials are monitoring the health of more
than 300,000 people in Byelorussia because of radioactive
contamination from the Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster, according
to Tass.
   Fallout has contaminated nearly one-fifth of the region, just
north of the power plant, Tass reported Thursday. Cancer and other
disease rates in the area are rising but remain below the national
average, it said.
   The official news agency asked why residents whose health may be
in danger were learning of the threat nearly three years after the
explosion and fire at the Chernobyl plant. ``Is this not too late to
tell the public the complete picture of the radiation situation?''
the agency asked.
   Vladimir Yevtukh, chairman of the area disaster relief
commission, responded by implying that residents still might not
know if it weren't for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
glasnost, or more openness.
   ``Glasnost and the democratization of public life played no small
role in the making public the data on the radiation situation in the
republic,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Yevtukh, a member of the Byelorussian Council of Ministers, said
some time was needed to collect 40,000 soil samples after the
accident in April 1986.
   Last week, the government newspaper Izvestia said 20 Byelorussian
villages were being abandoned. The number of people affected was not
given, but the newspaper said 1,200 apartments would be built for
them.
   The contaminated area is twice the size of Massachusetts.
Chernobyl is just south in the Ukraine, which was not addressed in
the article.
   Soviet officials did not report the Chernobyl accident until
three days later, when Sweden complained of unusually high radiation
levels. Reports on the cleanup have been sketchy.
   Tass said on Thursday the radiation absorbed by the residents of
the Byelorussian zone was nearly three times that found elsewhere,
but still less than 60 percent of the permissible level, according
to Yevtukh. It added, however, that ``no one precisely knows'' how
much radiation is dangerous.
   The contaminated area is divided into four zones, starting with
that immediately adjacent to the power plant. Tass said 4,400 people
were evacuated from the closest zone immediately after the accident.
   About 19,000 people were moved in the next four months from what
now is called the second zone, the report said.
   In the third zone, which covers 400 communities in the Gomel and
Mogilev regions of Byelorussia, authorities were giving medical
checkups to more than 100,000 residents and taking decontamination
measures, Tass said.
   In the fourth, the health of the 200,000 residents and the purity
of their food were being monitored.
   Towns in the contaminated area were washed to remove fallout from
roofs, fences and walls. Also, asphalt was replaced and hundreds of
thousands of tons of topsoil were removed and buried, Tass reported,
but did not say where the contaminated soil was taken.

   Prosecutors have dropped charges against a
man accused of attacking actress Tracy Scoggins in a hotel elevator
because she has refused to testify against him, authorities said.
   Ms. Scoggins told a prosecutor she would not travel here to
testify against Pedro Concepcion Padilla because he was to be tried
only on a misdemeanor assault charge. The maximum penalty on the
charge is $200.
   ``She told me that she is unwilling to come here to prosecute him
when all he's facing is a $200 fine,'' Assistant County Attorney
Timothy Byrne said at a court hearing Thursday.
   The charge was then dropped against Padilla, 36, of El Paso.
   Ms. Scoggins, who played the role of Monica Colby on ``The
Colbys'' television show, said Padilla pulled down her dress in a
hotel elevator while she was in El Paso to be cohost of the Miss USA
pageant in February 1988.
   A grand jury declined to indict Padilla on felony assault
charges, choosing to issue an indictment alleging a Class C
misdemeanor.
   Padilla's lawyer, Jose Montes, said Ms. Scoggins' decision proves
his contention that she was only seeking publicity from the alleged
attack.
   ``She's gotten what she wanted out of the case, millions of
dollars in publicity, while my client has sat in jail,'' Montes
said. But Padilla has spent only a few hours in jail since his
arrest.
   Padilla's arrest drew attention when he was released by a
municipal magistrate on just $100 bond when arraigned on a felony
charge of attempted sexual assault.
   After it was revealed that Padilla had given a false name at the
arraignment, another judge raised the bond to $100,000 and ordered
Padilla rearrested. Padilla quickly posted the higher bond.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet newspaper said Soviet Jews have suffered
discrimination for decades and that dictator Josef Stalin destroyed
Jewish culture in the country.
   Soviet officials have long denied Western charges of
anti-Semitism in their country. However, publications have recently
engaged in far greater criticism of Soviet society under a new
government policy of glasnost, or more openness.
   The Soviet Culture newspaper carried a nearly full-page article
in Thursday's editions on Soviet anti-Semitism, which it said has
led to ``the moral damage of all society.''
   ``It is finally time to ponder the actual reason why tens of
thousands of Jews have renounced their Soviet citizenship and left
for other countries, including Israel,'' the newspaper said in an
article signed by historians C. Rogov and V. Nosenko.
   ``Because of the emigration of thousands, even tens of thousands,
many Jews who didn't intend to leave the motherland encountered
problems in obtaining education and jobs.''
   The Soviets have allowed growing numbers of Jews to leave the
country in recent years. After granting visas for only 681 people in
1986, they let more than 15,000 depart last year.
   An estimated 1.8 million Jews remain in the Soviet Union.
   Although anti-Semitism in Russia dates at least to the 19th
century, when pogroms sent the first wave of Russian Jewish emigres
to the United States, the article singled out Stalin for blame.
   Stalin, who killed millions of his own people, ``destroyed Jewish
culture'' in the Soviet Union, the newspaper said.
   Soviet officials and publications have in recent months
repeatedly attacked Stalin, who ruled from 1924 to 1953, for many
abuses, including killing about 40 million people with his political
purges and programs.
   The newspaper implied that officials treated all Jews as if they
would soon be leaving and that Soviets have long looked on emigres
as traitors abandoning their homeland. ``Limits were secret but
enacted without trouble,'' it said.
   The paper said the result of this discrimination can be seen in
statistics.
   The number of Jewish students in higher education was cut in
half, and the traditionally high proportion of Jews in specialty
occupations also dropped, the paper said. It did not give more
specific figures or the time periods for the decreases.

<HEAD>Texas Lawmakers Want to Trim Governor's Salary _ By $84,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pay-cut fever has apparently spread from Washington
to Texas, where several lawmakers have threatened to slash Gov. Bill
Clement's salary by $84,000 to bring it in line with their own
incomes.
   State Rep. Keith Oakley has drafted a bill to cut Clements'
$91,000 salary to $7,200, and the measure has won support from other
Texas House members who were upset by an exchange between the
governor and House Speaker Gib Lewis.
   During a luncheon Wednesday attended by both Clements and Lewis,
the governor said he would not support a raise for state
legislators, who are paid $7,200.
   When Lewis reminded Clements of the gap between his salary and
legislators', the governor said, ``And I hope that gap gets wider.''
   Lewis, a Democrat from Fort Worth, is co-sponsor of a
constitutional amendment to raise legislators' pay. However, he said
he wasn't angered by the Republican governor's remark.
   ``I think it was an attempt to be cute and funny and we all get
in trouble when we do that,'' he said.
   But state Rep. David Hudson said many lawmakers were ``appalled
and disgusted'' by the governor's remark. ``I am not amused. And
members of the Legislature are not amused,'' Hudson said.
   A spokesman for Clements, Reggie Bashur, said the governor
opposes legislation to raise lawmakers' pay, but not a
constitutional amendment that would be submitted to voters.
   In the face of a popular outcry, Congress voted overwhelmingly
Tuesday to reject a proposed pay increase for its members from
$89,500 to $135,000.

<TEXT>
   A jet chartered by the United Nations
arrived in Kabul today with 30 tons of wheat and dried milk to help
feed the most needy people in the embattled capital.
   The Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 707, emblazoned with ``UN'' on one
side, was loaded with 238 bags of supplies to be handed out to
30,000 people targeted as the most vulnerable to the bitter winter
and food shortages plaguing Kabul.
   The food will be distributed from 30 centers around Kabul
beginning Sunday, said Steffan de Mistura, a spokesman for the U.N.
Office of Economic and Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan.
   ``This is a small step, a small shipment which we hope will be
able to make a real difference to the lives of some of the
vulnerable groups in Kabul that have been suffering from a hard
winter and being caught in the middle of war,'' said Ross Mountain,
deputy drector of the country's U.N. Development Program.
   An estimated 350,000 people in Kabul have been suffering from a
lack of food and fuel during one of the city's harshest winters in
years.
   U.N. officials say that if the conditions deteriorate, those who
will be most affected will be children between the ages of 1 and 5,
pregnant women and nursing mothers.
   Another 360 tons of food, medicine and blankets will be airlifted
into Kabul within the next 10 days, weather permitting, de Mistura
said.
   Kabul has been hit by severe shortages since early January
because of bad weather and attacks by Moslem rebels that have
disrupted convoys coming from the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet Union last month began airlifting supplies into the
city, delivering flour, canned meat and other items. Dozens of
Soviet military transport planes land daily in Kabul.
   Soviet officials have delivered more than 6,000 tons of flour
this month, about half the amount they said they wanted to airlift
in before the Feb. 15 deadline for their army's withdrawal from the
country.
   The goods are distributed on a coupon-rationing system, but only
government employees and supporters of the ruling party have access
to the supplies.
   The United Nations originally chartered an Egyptian Airlines
plane to fly in shipments to Kabul, but on Wednesday, officials said
the crew backed out because of concern for their safety.
   A six-member Ethiopian crew, headed by Capt. Sisay Tadisse,
agreed to do the job.
   ``I find it rather beautiful that after many years when the
United Nations has been airlifting goods into Ethiopia, it is the
Ethiopian airline that helps out the U.N.,'' de Mistura said.
   Michael Keating of the World Food Program said the crew had no
problems on the flight. Asked if he was concerned about safety
during the flight, Tadisse said, ``A little bit.''
   In neighboring Pakistan, Afghan rebels met today to debate a
future Islamic government in Afghanistan, but Iranian-based
guerrillas boycotted the gathering because of a feud with the
Pakistani-based faction.
   The meeting, or ``shura,'' coming five days before the scheduled
departure of all Soviet troops from Afghanistan, has been seen by
Western advisers as a last-ditch effort to avert a civil war between
the factions and consolidate power against the Kabul government.
   A spokesman for Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, chairman of the alliance
of Pakistani-based rebels, said after the opening session the
meeting would adjourn ``indefinitely'' until leaders agree on a
compromise for including the Iran-based contingent.
   Mohammad Karim Khalili, chairman of the Iran-based coalition,
said the dispute was over representation to the shura and a separate
supreme council of guerrilla leaders and their appointees.

   Brains dulled by age may be restored to the
quick brightness of youth by a new drug developed for treatment of
stroke, Chicago researchers report in a study published today.
   Experts at Northwestern University medical school say that a drug
called nimodipine was able to reinvigorate aging brains with the
fast learning ability of youth in a laboratory test using young and
middle-aged rabbits.
   The older rabbits receiving the drug ``actually learned at the
same rate, if not a slightly faster rate, than the young rabbits,''
said John F. Disterhoft, a cell biology professor who directed the
study. ``Two-thirds of the control group (older rabbits not
receiving the drug) never did learn the task.''
   He said that although the experiment used only a laboratory test
of learning, there is ``every reason to believe'' that the results
would also apply to higher learning skills. Results of the study
were published in the journal Science.
   The Northwestern experiment used four groups of rabbits. Rabbits
in two of the groups were about 30 months old, about middle age for
rabbits. The other two groups were three months old, young adult age
for rabbits.
   Nimodipine was administered to one of the older groups and to one
of the younger groups. The others were kept free of the drug to
provide control, or comparison, groups.
   To test learning ability, all of the rabbits were exposed to the
sound of a tone, immediately followed by a mild burst of air against
the eye. The air burst causes the eye to blink.
   This process was repeated 80 times a day. The researchers
measured how soon and how often the rabbits learned to anticipate
the burst of air by closing their eyes at the sound of the tone.
Each group received 15 training sessions.
   Disterhoft said that four of six older rabbits who did not
receive nimodipine never did learned to blink at the sound. The
other two did learn, but at a slower rate than the older rabbits
receiving the drug.
   ``All of the aging nimodipine animals learned the task in less
than eight days of training,'' he said, and this was slightly faster
than the learning rate shown by both the groups of young rabbits.
Disterhoft said nimodipine did not make the younger rabbits any
smarter. The drug appears to help only the aged brain.
   Disterhoft said the experiment was suggested after German doctors
noticed that stroke patients seemed to recover some learning
abilities when they were treated with nimodipine.
   The drug, manufactured by Miles Inc., was approved by the Food
and Drug Administration last December to treat impairment among
patients who have suffered a ruptured blood vessel in the brain,
which is a type of stroke. Bob Quick, a Miles spokesman, said the
drug is marketed under the name Nimotop. He said it is approved for
use now only by some types of stroke patients, and is does not have
FDA approval for other uses. Miles plans to market the drug in the
United States starting in April.
   Disterhoft said it is not known exactly why the drug appears to
restore learning deficits in aging brains, but it may be related to
the cellular absorption of calcium. Nimodipine is a calcium channel
blocker, which means it prevents cells from taking up excess
calcium. This is not related directly to calcium in the diet.
   ``In aging humans, one of the causes of problems in neurons
(brain cells) is too much calcium,'' he said. ``This (nimodipine)
might counteract that inappropriately high level of calcium.''
   More study will be needed before the drug could be used strictly
for the purpose of sharpening the learning ability of aging minds,
but Disterhoft said it could be a ``candidate'' for such use.
   The air-puff-in-the-eye test used on the rabbits also has been
used to test learning ability among humans.
   ``At about 40 years of age, there is a clear deficit of learning
this task in humans,'' said Disterhoft. ``A comparable deficit
occurs in rabbits at about 30 months of age, which is the beginning
of middle age for rabbits.''
   The air puff task may not take great mental exertion, but
Disterhoft said it is a direct test of mental sharpness.
   ``This is an associative learning task and there is every reason
to believe it (test results) would apply to other forms of higher
learning as well,'' he said.
   Working with Disterhoft on the experiment were Richard A. Deyo
and Karen T. Straube, also of Northwestern.
   Science is the journal of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.

   Afghan insurgents today met to debate
a future Islamic government in Afghanistan, but Iranian-based
guerrillas boycotted the gathering because of a feud with the
Pakistani-based faction.
   Journalists were allowed access to the site, a religious complex
at the outskirts of Islamabad, for only 10 minutes.
   A spokesman for Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, chairman of the alliance
of Pakistani-based insurgents, said after the opening session the
meeting would adjourn ``indefinitely'' until leaders agree on a
compromise for including the Iran-based contingent.
   ``It will not be complete without representation from Afghans
living in Iran,'' the spokesman said earlier, after the chairman of
the Iran-based guerrillas announced his group would not participate.
   The meeting, or ``shura,'' coming five days before the scheduled
departure of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, has been seen by
Western advisers as a last-ditch effort to avert a civil war between
the factions and consolidate power against the weakened
Soviet-backed government in Kabul.
   Several hundred Pakistan-based insurgents, officials of previous
Afghan governments, scholars and exiles attended today's session.
   Mohammad Karim Khalili, chairman of the Iran-based coalition,
said the dispute was over representation to the shura and a separate
supreme council composed of guerrilla leaders and their appointees.
The supreme council would make many day-to-day decisions of a rebel
government.
   He said his Iran-based guerrillas were promised seven Cabinet
positions and six seats on this supreme council, as well as 100
delegates to the shura, during a meeting several days ago in Tehran
with Mojaddidi.
   On Thursday, the Pakistani-based guerrilla spokesman, Qaribur
Rehman Saeed, said the insurgents living in Iran were offered 80
delegate seats. There were no offers of Cabinet positions or supreme
council seats.
   ``We have problems, big problems,'' Saeed told reporters.
   Khalili said he agreed on the higher figures with Mojaddidi, but
reports circulated today in Pakistan's official Pakistan Times that
Mojaddidi had been replaced as leader of the guerrillas based in
Pakistan.
   A spokesman for Mojaddidi's Afghan National Liberation Front,
Ghulam Waziri, denied the reports.
   Waziri said the Iran-based Afghans broke off talks after four of
the seven guerrilla groups in the Pakistani alliance refused to
accept their representation figures.
   The majority of Afghan fighters based in Iran belong to
Afghanistan's minority Shiite sect of Islam. The Pakistan-based
guerrillas are Sunni Moslems, which represent about 80 percent of
Afghans.
   The guerrilla leaders had been touting today's meeting as a
political solution to 10 years of fighting between U.S.- and
Pakistani-based guerrillas and Soviet-backed communists.
   The guerrilla's political maneuvering over a future government
assumes the fall of Afghanistan's ruling communists after the Soviet
troop withdrawal.
   The Soviets had 115,000 troops in Afghanistan before the
withdrawal began in May under a U.N.-mediated agreement. Most of the
several thousand remaining troops are believed headed home along the
Salang Highway.
   Soviet forces intervened in Afghanistan in 1979 to support the
Afghan communists against the guerrillas. The communists seized
power in a 1978 coup.

<HEAD>Woman Accused of Sending Michael J. Fox Threatening Letters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman accused of sending more than 5,000
threatening letters to actor Michael J. Fox apparently became upset
when she learned that he planned to marry actress Tracy Pollan,
authorities said.
   ``She wanted him to go back to an old girlfriend,'' said Al
Albergate, spokesman for the Los Angeles County district attorney's
office.
   Tina Marie Ledbetter, 26, was arrested in Westlake Village Feb. 3
for investigation of making terrorist threats, district attorney
investigator Gary Schram said Thursday. She was released after
posting $100,000 bail.
   Fox and Miss Pollan, who once played the actor's girlfriend in
the hit NBC television series ``Family Ties,'' were married last
July.
   The letters, sent to studios where Fox worked and to public
relations firms that represented him, were first sent in February
1988 and kept arriving after the couple were married.
   ``They were spread out pretty evenly over a year's time,''
Albergate said. ``I haven't read all 5,000. Basically, they have the
same theme. She threatened to kill him and his wife and their unborn
baby.''
   Fox, 27, who won two Emmys for his portrayal of the insufferable
conservative son of liberal parents on ``Family Ties'' has also
starred in such movies as ``Back to the Future'' and ``Bright
Lights, Big City.''

<BYLINE>Sakharov Receives Honorary Citizenship, Calls for Tolerance ^By

<DATELINE>FLORENCE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andrei Sakharov, the human rights
campaigner from the Soviet Union, became an honorary citizen of this
Renaissance city today.
   The scientist thanked the citizens of Florence and all others who
supported him during his struggles with five Soviet regimes.
   ``It's been said here that liberty and fraternity unite people,''
the Nobel Peace Prize winner said. ``Certainly that's true but there
is another thing that unites us, the knowledge of the danger that
threatens mankind.
   ``I think a city like Florence, with its grand humanistic
tradition, can contribute strongly to mankind's following the road
of understanding, tolerance and wisdom, the only road by which we
can avoid this danger.''
   During his five-day visit to Italy, Sakharov has cited pollution
and the threat of nuclear war as dangers.
   He told 200 people in a city government hall that his trip to
Florence was an emotional one.
   His wife, Yelena Bonner, also a human rights activist, stayed in
Florence several times in the 1970s and early 1980s when seeking
treatment for an eye problem. ``She always told me how she felt
protected and surrounded by warmth in this city,'' Sakharov said.
   The Florence city government voted in February 1980 to make
Sakharov an honorary citizen. A month earlier, he had been banished
to the closed Soviet city of Gorky for what Moscow called
anti-Soviet behavior.
   During his nearly seven years in Gorky, Sakharov went on several
hunger strikes so that his wife, also sent into exile, could travel
to Italy for operations.
   In conferring the certificate of honorary citizenship, Florence
Mayor Massimo Bogianckino hailed Sakharov for his human rights work.
   Sakharov accepted the document to the blare of horns played by
musicians dressed as Renaissance courtiers in red-and-white velvet
tunics. A huge banner with a red fleur-de-lis, the symbol of
Florence, dominated the gilt-trimmed room where the government has
met for nearly eight centuries.
   During Sakharov's seven-year detention, the Soviet government
said he would never be allowed to leave the country because of his
knowledge of state secrets. The nuclear physicist helped develop the
Soviet hydrogen bomb.
   But in December 1986, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev released
the couple from internal exile.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inventors whose innovations range from the
moldboard plow to the magnetic resonance imager will be added to the
National Inventors Hall of Fame this weekend.
   Induction ceremonies are scheduled for Sunday at the U.S. Patent
Office, home of the hall of fame.
   The four new members bring to 76 the number of inventors
memoralized at the Patent Office in suburban Arlington, Va.
   Scheduled to be inducted on Sunday are:
   _John Deere, born in 1804 in Rutland, Vt., developer of the
moldboard plow. Addition of the moldboard to the standard plow
improved the ability of the tool to turn over the soil.
   _George Westinghouse, for the invention of the steam-powered
brake for railroads. Westinghouse was born in Central Bridge, N.Y.,
in 1846.
   _Irving Langmuir of Brooklyn, N.Y., who developed the gas-filled
incandescent electric lamp. He was born in 1881.
   _Raymond Damadian of Forest Hills, N.Y., who won a patent for the
magnetic resonance imaging scanner in 1974. The scanner is used in
medical diagnosis.
   The ceremonies are to be held during the annual inventors
exposition at the Patent Office where dozens of new innovations will
be on display, ranging from toys to sporting goods to a better
mousetrap.

<HEAD>Ronald H. Brown Elected Chairman of Democratic Party</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 10 grafs new with Brown election; picks up 5th grafs pvs,
A 47-year-old.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Ronald H. Brown was elected today chairman of
the Democratic Party, the first black to head a major political
party, and said his chairmanship ``won't be about race, it will be
about the races we win.''
   ``You have made history,'' he told the Democratic National
Committee moments after it elected him chairman by acclamation.
   A former aide to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and adviser to
Jesse Jackson, Brown was unopposed for the party chairmanship.
   Four other contenders to succeed Paul G. Kirk Jr. in the top
party post dropped out early in the contest.
   ``There is no need to dwell on, but we cannot ignore, the history
of this moment,'' he said. ``Let me speak frankly,'' he went on, ``I
did not run on the basis of race but I will not run away from it.
   ``I am proud of who I am. And I am proud of this party, for we
are truly America's last, best hope to bridge the divisions of race,
region, religion, and ethnicity.''
   Brown said his first priority would be winning elections and ``I
promise you: the story of my chairmanship won't be about race, it
will be about the races we win over the next four years.''
   He is stepping in as chairman of the Democratic Party with a
pledge to reach out to the moderates and conservatives who opposed
him because of his ties to Kennedy and Jackson.
   As he made the rounds Thursday of meetings of party officials,
Brown acknowledged that many Democrats had been reluctant to support
his bid for the chairmanship.
   It no longer mattered, he said, whether people were early
supporters or late. ``Most of all we've got to be united as a
party.''
   A 47-year-old partner in one of Washington's largest and most
politically active law firms _ Patton, Boggs &amp; Blow _ Brown was
deputy manager of Kennedy's 1980 presidential campaign and then
served as general counsel and staff director of the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
   He was a top adviser to Jackson in the late stages of his 1988
presidential campaign and was given credit for helping unify the
party at its Atlanta convention last summer.
   Brown grew up in Harlem where his father was manager of the
Theresa Hotel. But his parents, both graduates of Howard University,
sent their only child to predominantly white schools on Manhattan's
Upper East Side.
   That pattern continued into college, where Brown was the only
black in the class of 1962 at Middlebury College in Vermont.
   ``I have maintained a significant interest in politics over the
years,'' Brown wrote in autobiographical notes for his 25th reunion
yearbook at Middlebury.
   His involvement with the liberal wing of his party was the focus
of much of the opposition to Brown when he announced his bid for the
chairmanship.
   But once he clinched the job, even his most vocal opponents
rallied around the chairman-to-be.
   ``I say let's give him a chance,'' said John Baker, chairman of
the Alabama Democratic Party, who once threatened to boycott the
national party if Brown became chairman.
   ``A lot of Democrats feel excluded, feel rejected,'' said Baker.
``They feel there's no room in the party for them because they are
moderate or conservative in philosophy.''
   The Alabama chairman said it would be ``helpful, first of all, if
he'd acknowledge that we've got that problem.''
   Brown did just that.
   ``The South is crucial to the future of the Democratic Party,''
Brown told a meeting of the Southern Caucus of the Democratic
National Committee.
   ``I don't want to be the chairman of a party that writes off any
region of the country,'' he said to Democrats aware their
presidential candidates have received none of the South's electoral
votes in the last two elections.
   Brown urged Democrats to ``speak forcefully'' on defense, crime
and drugs, issues he said are in the forefront of voter concerns.

<HEAD>Judge Going Slow In Protest Over Pay Freeze</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge with a reputation for resolving
lawsuits quickly has decided to slow down to protest the
congressional vote to scuttle 51 percent pay raises for federal
lawmakers and judges.
   Chief Judge Carl Rubin of the Southern District of Ohio said he
will limit himself to two civil trials a month, starting with his
oldest cases.
   ``I'm not willing to take this lying down,'' Rubin told The
Cincinnati Enquirer in an interview published today. ``I believe I
have been dealt with unjustly. This is the only way I have to
protest.''
   Rubin, 69, said he intended to work for $100 an hour. Since his
pay is $89,500 a year, he calculated that he would have to work 900
hours a year or about 20 hours a week.
   Congress voted Tuesday to block a proposal which would have
automatically raised pay for its members and federal judges to
$135,000.
   Under his slowdown, Rubin said, a lawsuit will take about 20
months to come to trial in his court, instead of a year. He said 20
months is the national average.
   ``I'm not required to be a particularly speedy judge,'' he said.
``I'm going to be an average judge. If I'm being paid in that
fashion, I'll work in that fashion.''

<HEAD>Exploding Packets Of Dye Foil Robber; Passers-By Return Most of the
Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A would-be bank robber foiled by an
exploding packet of dye and tear gas concealed with the money
apparently went to a second bank branch minutes later and was foiled
the same way again, authorities said.
   In one case, the exploding packet spewed money on a downtown
street, setting off a lunchtime scramble for cash, witnesses said.
But a bank spokesman said most of the money was returned.
   ``Cars were stopping and people were jumping out and grabbing
money,'' Brenda L. Johnson, a witness, said after the robbery turned
into a free-for-all Wednesday. Cash was ``flying around,'' she said.
   Two branches of the Colonial National Bank, about 1{ miles apart,
were robbed between noon and 1 p.m. Wednesday, police said. In both
crimes, a man wearing a blue jacket and a red scarf across his face
demanded cash from a teller.
   Authorities said they suspect the same man was involved in both
robberies, but planned to compare pictures taken by bank cameras to
be sure.
   After the first bank was hit, the robber dropped the money bag he
was handed when a packet of red dye and tear gas in it exploded.
   The second time, the robber asked the money not be put in a bag,
police said. The teller handed over wads of cash with the explosive
pack concealed inside.
   After the robber left the bank, the device exploded in a flash of
red smoke, sending the money flying on the street. The man fled, a
witness said.
   The sight of $50, $20, $10 and $1 bills prompted shouts of
``hallelujah'' from one pedestrian.
   Ms. Johnson said she gave police several hundred dollars that she
retrieved after the explosion occurred within five feet of her.
   Bank spokesman Al Jacobson said all but an ``insignificant''
amount of money was recovered. He declined to say how much was
stolen.

<HEAD>House Passes Bill To Repeal State's 200-Year-Old Adultery Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state's House of Representatives has
passed a bill repealing New Hampshire's 200-year-old law that makes
adultery a crime punishable by a year in jail.
   The measure, passed 201-149 Thursday, goes to the Senate, where a
similar bill two years ago was defeated.
   ``What two consenting adults do with each other is not for the
state to interfere with,'' Rep. Scott Green said during floor debate.
   Supporters of the measure also said the law is unenforceable, but
critics said passage of the repeal bill would lead to a perception
that New Hampshire tolerates adultery.
   ``Morality is a part of government,'' said Rep. Daniel Healy.
``Washington, D.C., is a good example (of) what happens when
immorality takes place.''
   The law, which hadn't been enforced in decades, became an issue
in 1987 when Robert Stackelbeck, 37, of Milford, filed a lawsuit
against Daniel Hebenstreit, 37, charging him with committing
adultery with 25-year-old Sharon Stackelbeck.
   Hebenstreit denied the charge and police refused to prosecute.
Stackelbeck filed his own complaint, but later asked that the
charges be dropped.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three more detainees involved
in a widespread hunger strike were hospitalized today, and another
striker was reported on the verge of kidney failure, a human rights
group said.
   Two anti-apartheid church leaders, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and
the Rev. Allan Boesak, said they were considering joining the
19-day-old hunger strike. About 300 of the estimated 1,000 people
detained without charge are participating in the strike, demanding
they be freed or put on trial.
   The hunger strike represents one of the strongest challenges to
the policy of detention without trial since President P.W. Botha
declared a national state of emergency in June 1986.
   The three hunger strikers taken to Hillbrow Hospital in
Johannesburg brought to 11 the number that have been hospitalized
this week, according to the Detainees Aid Center.
   Mark Modiba, who was sent to the hospital on Wednesday, was
suffering from pre-renal failure, a serious kidney disorder, the
group said.
   The strike began Jan. 23 at Diepkloof Prison outside Johannesburg
and has spread to at least three other cities.
   The detainees, some held for 32 months, have demanded the
government charge them with an offense or release them.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for
varying lengths of time under the state of emergency.
   ``The emergency regulations have paralyzed the legal system
because detainees cannot challenge their detention in court,''
Boesak said. ``They have had to use this extreme method to draw
attention to their plight.''
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said in Parliament, ``It is
clear the strike is being orchestrated from outside.''
   ``It is not spontaneous, but carefully planned worldwide by these
organizations,'' Vlok said without referring to any groups by name.
``Most of the detainees taking part do not share the enthusiasm of
these organizations.''
   He claimed some detainees were intimidated into joinging the
strike.
   Vlok has said the detainees are being held for ``good reason''
and that the government chose not to charge them because it would be
difficult to obtain convictions in many of the cases.
   On Thursday, more than 40 civil rights lawyers pledged to fast
for 48 hours in support of the strikers' demands.
   The Star newspaper of Johannesburg, the country's largest-selling
daily, carried a feature article today about Bobby Sands, the Irish
Republican Army leader who died at a prison in Northern Ireland in
1981 after a 66-day hunger strike.

   The quake measured 6.9 on the Richter scale and was centered 870
miles southeast of Manila in the Philippines, the observatory said
in a statement.
   The Richter scale is a guage of energy released by an earthquake
and each increase of one number means the ground motion is 10 times
greater.
   A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in a populated
area, while one of magnitude 7 is capable of causing widespread and

<TEXT>
   A neo-Nazi whose political
organization was outlawed by the government said today he has formed
a new group.
   ``Right after the banning of the Nationale Sammlung (National
Rallying), I formed a new organization with the name Initiative
Volkswille (Popular Will Initiative),'' Michael Kuehnen said. ``I
want to keep being politically active.''
   Kuehnen, who has spent more than seven years in prison for his
neo-Nazi activities, spoke to reporters outside a Munich court,
where he was fined $490 for staging an illegal rally in May.
   In Bonn, an Interior Ministry spokesman, Michael-Andreas Butz,
called Thursday's outlawing of Kuehnen's Nationale Sammlung a
success.
   Butz also emphasized during a news conference that the ban came
in time to prevent the group from running in next month's municipal
elections in Frankfurt and suburban Langen.
   Police confiscated guns, knives, ammunition and Nazi propaganda
in a series of coordinated raids against homes of the organization's
members Thursday. The group, which was founded during the summer,
had about 170 members.
   Guenther Scheicher, head of the Hesse state Office for the
Protection of the Constitution, said in a telephone interview today
that slayings and robberies have been linked to ``the neo-Nazi
scene,'' but he did not name any groups or individuals.
   Scheicher said the raids have been completed, and no further
actions were planned. He said state officials had no plans to issue
any arrest warrants as a result of the raids.
   A newspaper today reported that more than 30 neo-Nazis at a time
had gathered at Kuehnen's home, and neighbors summoned police when
loudspeakers blared ``the tape-recorded speeches of Hitler and (Nazi
propaganda chief Joseph) Goebbels at full volume one Sunday last
summer.''
   The Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper said police ordered the
volume turned down but did not stop the speeches from being played.
   The Nationale Sammlung had fielded candidates for next month's
elections in Frankfurt and suburban Langen and said it hoped to run
in other locations as well. Its platform included renaming a railway
station after Adolf Hitler.
   The ban forbids Nationale Sammlung members from carrying out
activities as a group, including running candidates in an election,
and bans them from using the name publicly.
   The Interior Ministry may ban any organization it determines is
spreading Nazi propaganda. Violations of the ban carry penalties of
up to five years in prison.
   The ministry's action coincided with a growing concern in West
Germany of a possible resurgence of ultrarightist tendencies.
   A poll published Sunday by Welt am Sonntag newspaper said another
extreme right-wing group, the Republican Party, would win 11.5
percent of the vote nationwide if federal elections were held now.
   The Republicans, headed by a former Nazi Waffen SS soldier,
captured 7.5 percent of the vote in last month's elections in West
Berlin. That sends 11 party members to the local legislature and
gives the Republicans two seats in Parliament next year.

   A 17-year-old girl and her newborn
infant were found living with farm animals in a run-down, abandoned
house, state social workers said.
   ``There were animals in the house, sheep and dogs,'' said
prosecutor Richard Garcia, who represents the Texas Department of
Human Services in child welfare cases. ``The baby had a severe case
of diaper rash. The mother was dirty and lice infested.''
   Garcia said the infant, whose gender was not disclosed, was taken
to a children's shelter after DHS officials obtained emergency
custody of the baby a week ago. On Thursday, District Judge Tom
Rickhoff gave DHS officials six months' custody of the baby and
ordered the mother to undergo evaluation.
   ``This was a 5-day-old baby and they had no place to live, no
food, no heat, no water, no nothing,'' Garcia said after the hearing.
   A social worker's affadavit said newspapers lined the floors in
the ramshackle dwelling, which smelled of urine. The social worker
described the house as being littered with ``filthy piles of junk.''
   A caller told health services officials that the mother was
sitting outside the abandoned house on a couch with the infant in
the cold night air.
   The young mother became agitated when social workers offered to
take her and the infant to the San Antonio Metropolitan Ministries
Shelter for the homeless, Garcia said.

   Officials said the foreign ministers of
Iran and Iraq would hold direct talks today with Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar as mediator, the first time the two
ministers have agreed to face-to-face talks.
   ``The only thing I want is to agree on what to do next, and to
obtain from the two parties (assurances) that they will resume the
direct talks,'' Perez de Cuellar told The Associated Press as he
left his home this morning.
   The U.N. chief said he hoped to persuade the foreign ministers to
resume more extended direct talks ``perhaps in the end of March,
early April.''
   Top U.N. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Perez de Cuellar would ask the two to begin talks with him today.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati met Perez de Cuellar
this morning to receive the request.
   His Iraqi counterpart, Tariq Aziz, said Thursday he is ready for
talks with Velayati in an effort to break the deadlock in the
negotiations, which began in August.
   The two have met for peace talks in Geneva and New York but have
not held face-to-face talks. After initial appearances at a
conference table for photographers, they and their aides went to
separate rooms.
   Velayati said on Thursday that he expected to take part in
three-way talks with Aziz and the secretary-general. He was at the
U.N. headquarters for a reception sponsored by his country's U.N.
Mission.
   The Persian Gulf neighbors went to war in September 1980. They
agreed to a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire that went into effect in
August and was followed by peace talks.
   ``Unfortunately, those meetings, which were called `direct
talks,' were fruitless to a great extent,'' Aziz told reporters
Thursday.
   
   Both parties have expressed optimism and a willingness to talk
but have given no sign they are ready to budge from their positions.
   Iran believes that the cease-fire is complete and that Baghdad
and Tehran should move on to the next points in Security Council
Resolution 598, the 1987 U.N. peace plan that calls for withdrawal
of armies to the border, exchange of prisoners of war, and holding
peace talks leading to a negotiated settlement.
   Iraq still occupies about 260 square miles of Iranian territory.
   Baghdad says the cease-fire is not yet legally in place because
Iran has not yet yielded its right to search ships in international
waters of the Persian Gulf for war material bound for Iraq.
   Iraq says it will withdraw from the land it holds when Iran gives
up its right to search ships.
   Baghdad also wants Iran to cooperate with an Iraqi plan to have
the United Nations dredge and open the Shatt-al-Arab waterway for
use by both nations.
   The waterway, which forms part of their southern border, is
clogged with silt, sunken ships and unexploded ordnance. It is
Iraq's main outlet to the gulf, along which Iran has a long
coastline.
   Iran has been unwilling to discuss the Shatt al-Arab unless it
retains sovereignty over the eastern half of the waterway under a
1975 treaty. Iraq believes the treaty should be renegotiated.

   President Bush told Congress he needs $5.5
billion to wage the war on drugs, with the lion's share going to law
enforcement efforts including border interdiction.
   The request is 21 percent more _ $974 million _ than the $4.6
billion to be spent this year. And it is $236 million more than
former President Reagan sought in his first-draft 1990 plan
submitted last month, according to Richard Darman, director of the
Office of Management and Budget.
   Bush's proposal Thursday calls for almost $970 million ``to
educate our young people to say no to drugs'' including programs
from kindergarten through college, $661 million to expand drug abuse
treatment, ``particularly for the indigent, disadvantaged, youth and
expectant mothers,'' and $3.9 billion for law enforcement efforts,
according to the budget documents.
   Although not included in the drug war proposals, Bush also called
for $929 million in spending on corrections.
   ``I want to make sure that when a drug dealer is convicted, there
is a cell waiting for him,'' Bush said Thursday night in his
nationally televised speech to Congress. ``He should not go free
because prisons are too full.''
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden, D-Del., chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, praised Bush for adding $1 billion to the anti-drug
effort, but said, ``He's still got a way to go.''
   ``Illegal drugs is a $100 billion-a-year business, but we spend
only one-twentieth of that amount trying to stop them,'' he said.
``At the very least, we should fully fund the drug bill, which will
require another $500 million.''
   While the budget document listed actual outlay requests for broad
goals, it provided only multi-year authorization requests _ which
generally are higher _ for more specific programs.
   The authorization requests include $150 million for the Justice
Department's program of drug grants to state and local governments.
Reagan had eliminated all funding for such grants in his 1990 budget
proposal.
   The Drug Enforcement Administration would get more than 300 new
positions and would be called upon to increase its overseas
operations.
   Funding for the State Department's Bureau of International
Narcotics Matters would increase by $14 million to $115 million to
allow for ``enhanced crop eradication and lab destruction in foreign
drug-producing countries,'' especially in the cocaine-producing
countries of South America.
   The U.S. Customs Service would add about 550 people to its drug
interdiction program, authorized at a total of $442 million, and the
Coast Guard's drug-interdiction authorization would increase by 9
percent to $690 million.
   The Defense Department, which Congress authorized to get $300
million in 1989 for its expanded role in the drug war, would receive
the same amount under Bush's 1990 budget authorization request.
   Bush also requested $215 million for new Organized Crime Drug
Enforcement task forces.
   The budget request also calls for funding two new programs for
anti-drug education. About $25 million would be spent on Urban
Emergency Grants to ``city school systems with the worst drug
problems,'' and $35 million would go for community partnership
grants.
   Bush also is seeking $367 million for the Drug-Free Schools and
Communities program, which provide grants for states, higher
education institutions and teacher training, among others.
   In addition, Bush proposed $25 million to reduce admission delays
to drug treatment programs, $30 million for a new grant program ``to
support expansion of treatment capacity for the indigent,
disadvantaged, youth or expectant mothers in selected states which
are seriously committed to expansion,'' and a tripling of funding,
to $7 million, for HHS research into effective treatment programs.

<TEXT>
   A New York arts foundation has extended its
temporary financial assistance to a stranded Soviet ballet troupe
and a way may be found to allow the dancers to continue their tour,
a spokeswoman said.
   The Donetsk Ballet, still hoping to complete a 15-city U.S. tour,
has been in limbo for a week in Baltimore. The troupe ran out of
money when backers withdrew their commitment of $200,000 because
dancers from better-known Soviet ballet companies could not join the
tour.
   The Donetsk is a troupe of 59 Ukrainian ballet dancers, mostly
under the age of 25.
   Natalie Moody, spokeswoman for the Howard Gilman Foundation in
New York, said Thursday that the foundation is supporting the
dancers' stay at least through Sunday while a way to salvage their
itinerary is sought.
   ``The foundation has extended their stay, as solutions seem to be
closer to keeping the troupe here,'' Ms. Moody said. She said an
announcement might be made as early as today.
   As news of the troupe's plight has spread, arts patrons have sent
money and telegrams and have made other gestures of support. A free
performance by the dancers Wednesday at the Lyric Opera House
brought donations of about $4,200 from people in the audience.
   The dancers originally were scheduled to remain in the United
States through April and had performances booked in Detroit;
Chicago; Columbus, Ohio; and other cities.
   The Soviet Embassy reportedly was seeking financial backers to
take over the tour. Embassy press secretary Igor Bulay referred all
calls Thursday to the consular attache, but there was no answer at
that office.
   David Hermon, one of three stockholders in Heart of Art Inc., a
Santa Rosa, Calif.-based artistic management company that organized
the tour, said he hoped the financial problems would be resolved.
   Hermon said a condition imposed by Gilman was that Heart of Art
forfeit control of the tour.
   The dancers' plight also has drawn some attention from Mikhail
Baryshnikov, the Soviet emigre dancer who now is artistic director
for the American Ballet Theatre in New York. The New York Times
reported that Baryshnikov offered to lend costumes and scenery to
the troupe if the U.S. tour continues.

<HEAD>Georgia Tech President Swaps Roles With Student for Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After trading places with a student for a day,
Georgia Tech President John Patrick Crecine got into big trouble. He
was late for his calculus class.
   Meanwhile, junior David Ritchie was having a grand time as the
university's chief executive officer, abolishing parking fees and
giving pleasant contemplation to the idea of canceling classes.
   Crecine and junior Ritchie exchanged car keys and identities
Thursday morning in a parking lot outside Junior's Grill.
   Crecine inherited a 1981 Cutlass Supreme and no special
privileges, while Ritchie got the president's new Chrysler New
Yorker and all the perks and power of office.
   Each drove off with some last-minute advice from the other.
   ``If the Legislature calls, they're friends,'' Crecine told his
alter ego. ``Take that call.''
   Ritchie offered the president some tips on whre he might find a
parking space _ an issue of great concern for Tech students.
   Even with the inside scoop, Crecine had trouble parking and was
15 minutes late for his 8 a.m. calculus class.
   ``This is embarrassing,'' he said, interrupting class. ``About
the best I can hope for is that there will be no pop quizzes.''
   Trading places was the idea of Tech's Student Foundation, a group
that financially assists student organizations. To raise money,
members of the foundation approached Crecine about raffling off his
job for a day and the president readily accepted.
   Ritchie said he bought 20 raffle tickets at $1 each. About 260
tickets were sold.
   ``I wanted to get to see the administration from a different
point of view -or bring a different point of view to the
administration,'' the student said.
   One of Ritchie's first actions, although short-lived, was to
abolish fees at the new parking deck on campus. He contemplated
canceling classes, but realized the move would let Crecine off the
hook.
   But along with the power came responsibility. After giving a
speech to officials of the Ford Motor Co., Ritchie was briefed on
the university's plans for restructuring its academic departments.
He also met with Tech's library director about the need for more
funding.
   ``I've found myself wanting to talk to people more, but I have
other appointments,'' Ritchie said. ``The president only has so much
time in a day.''
   Although Crecine's schedule intentionally was designed by
students to have built-in hassles (getting a student identification
card, for instance), the break from the daily meetings was a welcome
relief.
   ``This is a great luxury,'' Crecine said. ``The notion of having
some time where you get to concentrate on something longer than five
minutes is refreshing. It's like being in an isolation tank.''
   Ritchie and Crecine both agreed they'd like to continue the swap,
but a deal's a deal. At the stroke of 5 p.m., they reluctantly
resumed their former identities.

   A Cuban cargo ship carrying 45 crew members was
sliced in half by a Miami-based cruise liner today just off the
Cuban coast, leaving three missing and one man severely injured, the
Coast Guard said.
   No one was reported hurt aboard the 734-foot Celebration cruise
ship, which remained in the area 20 miles off the eastern tip of
Cuba searching for more survivors, said Coast Guard spokesman Jeff
Karonis.
   Forty-two of the 45 people aboard the 320-foot Cuban ship Capitan
San Luis were rescued after the 6 a.m. collision and brought aboard
the Celebration, Karonis said. Searchers were continuing to look for
the other three.
   Karonis said the stern of the Cuban vessel, which carried cement,
sank immediately, but the bow section remained floating.
   ``We don't know what happened yet,'' he said. ``The only thing we
know is that one of the Cuban survivors said it happened rather
suddenly.''
   Numerous Coast Guard ships and planes were rushing to the site,
Karonis said, and a helicopter and a Falcon jet were already on the
scene this morning.
   ``The Cuban government is also sending out some boats to
search,'' said Joe Dye, another Coast Guard spokesman. The Coast
Guard informally advised the Cuban government shortly after the
accident.
   The injured man, whose foot was severed in the accident, was
expected to be taken to nearby Matthew Town on the Bahamian island
of Great Inagua, and then transferred by Coast Guard jet to a Miami
hospital with a trauma center, Dye said.
   ``We have also informally advised the Cubans this morning,''
Karonis said, noting that the collision occurred in heavily traveled
shipping lanes only 20 miles off Punta Guarico near the eastern tip
of Cuba.
   He said Cuban ships were within fairly easy reach of the spot,
but did not know if they had arrived yet.
   Karonis said there was no information yet on whether the accident
caused a major oil spill, but said it was likely fuel tanks were
split aboard the Capitan San Luis when it was cut in half.
   The Liberian-registry Celebration, owned by Carnival Cruise Lines
in Miami and believed to be on its way back to Miami after a stop in
San Juan, Puerto Rico, reported only minor damage, Karonis said.
   Because the accident happened on the high seas between a Liberian
and a Cuban ship, the Coast Guard will not formally investigate the
cause, Dye said. Those two nations will have to determine the cause
of the collision.
   Carnival spokesmen were not immediately available to answer phone
calls, according to office secretaries.

<TEXT>
   The sister of American hostage Terry
Anderson today prayed for his release from Lebanon and for peace in
that war-battered country.
   But Lebanon's main Shiite Moslem spiritual leader ruled out an
early release of foreign hostages. In an interview published today,
he cited unspecified ``new complications.''
   Peggy Say hung a bracelet engraved with her brother's name on a
cross on the altar of the Greek Catholic church of St. Sergius,
built 300 years after the death of Christ. It is one of the oldest
churches in the world.
   With the local priest, Rev. Michael Zarura, Mrs. Say also prayed
for better U.S.-Syrian relations, urging ``the healing of
relationships between our countries and the hearts of the people in
Lebanon so they may live in peace.''
   Syria is believed to have played a role in the release of French
and German hostages last year, acting as mediator between countries
seeking the release of hostages and the pro-Iranian Moslem groups
holding them.
   Syria has close relations with Iran and was that country's only
major Arab ally in the Iran-Iraq war. Syria, with 40,000
peacekeeping troops in Lebanon, is the major power broker in that
country.
   Zarura prayed, ``here, in the oldest church in the world, that
your wishes come true and that Terry Anderson is in good health.''
   Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was seized by Shiite Moslem extremists March 16, 1985.
   Anderson, a native of Lorain, Ohio, is the longest-held of 15
foreign hostages in Lebanon. There are eight other Americans, three
Britons, an Irishman, an Italian and a Belgian.
   Mrs. Say is in Syria for meetings with Syrian officials who have
been cooperating in attempts to free the hostages.
   She came to this ancient Christian site at the suggestion of
Jodeph Atiyeh, a Syrian-American of Baton Rouge, La. Atiyeh is
employed as an oil consultant in Syria and the United States.
   Mrs. Say and Atiyeh met in the lobby of a Damascus Hotel.
   ``We came to pray for a miracle,'' Mrs. Say said after hearing
that Maaloula is the site of several reported miracles in the early
history of the Christian church.
   Mrs. Say and Atiyeh also prayed at the chapel marking the hiding
place of St. Takla, described as the first female Christian martyr
who was converted to Christianity by St. Paul.
   Several miracles are attributed to St. Takla, including creation
of a holy spring near the chapel, carved out of a rock cliff.
   Sister Agatha Homsy, of the convent built around the chapel,
showed Mrs. Say and Atiyeh the spring where faithful may drink from
a metal cup.
   ``I'm a believer and I believe that water has some real bounce to
it,'' Atiyeh said after he and Mrs. Say drank.
   The Rev. Raymond Barnet, of Vancouver, Canada, who is
accompanying Mrs. Say, also prayed in the chapel of St. Takla and
asked that a miracle be performed again for the persecuted and that
Anderson and the other hostages be freed.
   Barnet, a Protestant minister, whose organization ``Friends in
the West'' is active in seeking the hostages' release, asked God for
``that special miracle you alone can grant, freedom for Terry
Anderson and all the hostages.''
   In Beireut, Sheik Mohammed Mehdi Shamseddin, interviewed by
Lebanon's weekly magazine Ash-Shiraa, would not explain the ``new
complcations'' mentioned. When he was asked if he was hopeful of an
early settlement of the hostage issue, he was quoted as saying, ``In
fact, no.''

<HEAD>Judge Appoints Lawyer As Guardian For Sadler</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has appointed a lawyer as
guardian for author-singer Barry Sadler, whose disabling injury in a
shooting last fall touched off a legal dispute among his relatives.
   Attorney David Brandon, appointed as guardian Thursday, said he
hopes to return Sadler from Brecksville Veterans Administration
Hospital in Ohio to a VA hospital in Nashville or nearby
Murfreesboro.
   Sadler, 48, who had the 1960s hit record ``Ballad of the Green
Berets'' and has also written a series of adventure novels, has been
the object of a legal tug-of-war since he was brain-damaged in a
shooting in Guatemala in September.
   ``I think it's necessary that we get Mr. Sadler back here as fast
as we can,'' Probate Judge Jim Everett said in making the
appointment.
   Brandon represents neither side of the family, Everett's office
said today.
   Everett ordered Sadler's relatives Thursday not to ``comment
derogatorily about each other in the presence of Mr. Sadler or
anyone else.''
   Sadler's wife and children, who live near Nashville, and his
business agent, Rob Robison, filed a lawsuit in Probate Court on
Jan. 10. They said they were to surprised to learn on the previous
day that Sadler had been discharged from the Wade Park Veterans
Administration Hospital in Cleveland, where he was transferred in
November from Nashville's VA hospital.
   The lawsuit said the group had just learned that Sadler's mother,
Bebe Sadler of Denver, had filed a petition for guardianship in
Cleveland on Jan. 5.
   ``I think everybody probably has the right purpose in mind, but
they're not going about it in the right way,'' Everett said.
   A Cleveland judge who visited Sadler in a private hospital ruled
Jan. 31 that Sadler needs help in making medical and other
decisions. But after hearing from attorneys for both sides of
Sadler's family, that judge said he would let Everett name a neutral
guardian.

<TEXT>
   Israel today rejected Soviet accusations that it
is violating the human rights of Palestinians in the occupied
territories, saying Moscow's remarks were unjust and one-sided.
   The Soviet Union on Thursday accused Israel of ``crudely
violating human rights and trampling underfoot generally recognized
international legal norms'' in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``The Israeli authorities are stiffening reprisals against the
innocent Palestinian population and extensively using firearms and
ammunition, which leads to suffering, injuries and the deaths of
many people,'' Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov said in a statement.
   Alon Liel, a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry, said the
statement was ```blatantly one-sided.'' He said, ``It is unjust and
therefore cannot be accepted with indifference.''
   The Soviet criticism was relayed through the Dutch Embassy in
Moscow, which represents Israeli interests in the Soviet capital.
   It came one day after the U.S. State Department released a report
outlining Israeli abuses in the occupied lands, where government
troops have been battling Palestinians in the 14-month uprising
against Israeli rule.
   The Soviets called on Israel to halt violent activity in the
territories, which Moscow said ``could not be justified under any
circumstances.''
   Gerasimov criticized Israel for relying on ``power methods''
instead of pursuing a Middle East peace settlement to end the
uprising.
   Liel said the Soviet Union could not help bring peace to the
region unless it restored relations with Israel, broken after the
1967 Middle East war.
   Only after the restoration of ties ``will the Soviet attitude be
based on an understanding of the complexity of the issues in
question,'' Liel said, quoting from a statement being relayed to
Moscow.
   Israel-Soviet relations have been improving slowly, and the harsh
exchange was not expected to threaten that progress, said Arye
Levine, who represents Israel's interests in Moscow.
   ``They have probably thought long and hard before taking a
position on this,'' he said on Israel radio. ``They have taken a
position, but that does not affect ... the process of normalization
of relations.''

<HEAD>Religious Figure: Cambodia Holding U.S. Remains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cambodian government is holding the
remains of about eight Americans killed during the Indochina war, a
U.S. religious figure today quoted the Cambodian prime minister as
saying.
   W. Stanley Mooneyham, a former president of the Christian aid
group World Vision, said the prime minister, Hun Sen, told him in an
interview Feb. 3 that about 10 percent of the 83 American servicemen
Washington lists as missing in action in Cambodia have been found.
   ``Let us talk and we can discuss an aircraft to take them out,''
Mooneyham quoted Hun Sen as saying.
   Mooneyham said Hun Sen told him no conditions would be attached
to talks or repatriation of the remains to the United States, which
does not recognize the Cambodian government and refuses to deal with
it.
   Hun Sen also told Mooneyham there were more than 83 American MIAs
in Cambodia. No figure was given. Eight other Americans also
disappeared in Cambodia during the war, which ended in 1975. They
included journalists, contractors, a missionary and a merchant
seaman. A total of 2,383 are listed as missing in action in Vietnam,
Cambodia, Laos and China.
   Hun Sen was quoted as saying his government continued to search
for MIAs but might abandon its efforts if the United States did not
respond.
   ``Our people are losing faith in the search because we are being
scolded by the United States instead of being encouraged,''
Mooneyham quoted Hun Sen as saying.
   Mooneyham first went to Cambodia in 1968 and has known Hun Sen
for 10 years. Mooneyham said he would relay information from his
talks with Hun Sen to U.S. Embassy officials in Bangkok and had
offered to act as a mediator.
   Some U.S. officials say the Cambodian government hopes to use the
MIA issue to gain some form of recognition from Washington. The
United States regards the Phnom Penh government as a puppet regime
set up by Vietnam after it invaded Cambodia in late 1978.
   Mooneyham served as president of World Vision from 1969 to 1982
and now is involved in consulting and Christian activities. In 1980
he persuaded Hun Sen to allow World Vision to reopen a pediatrics
hospital in Phnom Penh that the group built and staffed during the
war.

that has long tormented humanity and urged efforts to stamp out all
forms of prejudice. It said the Roman Catholic Church itself shares
the blame for racism.
   In a major document that took the unusual step of mentioning
countries by name, the Vatican reserved its harshest criticism for
South Africa's system of apartheid.
   It also said ``much still needs to be done'' to wipe out racial
prejudice in the United States, but it cited the country as one of
the most interracial societies in the world.
   Examining the history and causes of prejudice, the 45-page
document warned of possible new forms of racism, saying modern
science could be exploited by ``apprentice sorcerers'' seeking to
produce human beings selected by race.
   The document, titled ``The Church and Racism: Towards A More
Fraternal Society,'' was writted by the Vatican's Justice and Peace
Commission at the request of Pope John Paul II.
   It said the Roman Catholic Church ``wants first and foremost to
change racist attitudes, including those within her own
communities'' and noted that throughout history church leaders
themselves have not been blameless.
   The document said harboring racist thoughts and attitudes ``is a
sin against the specific message of Christ.''
   ``Racism still exists and continually reappears in different
forms. ... It is a wound in humanity's side that mysteriously
remains open.''
   The document called South African apartheid ``institutionalized
racism ... justified by an ideology of the superiority of persons
from European stock over those of African or Indian origin or
`colored' which is, by some, supported by an erroneous
interpretation of the Bible.''
   Under apartheid, that nation's black majority has no voice in
national affairs.
   ``Today apartheid is the most marked and systematic form'' of
racism, the document said. ``Change is absolutely necessary and
urgent.''
   There was no immediate comment from South Africa's government.
   The document added: ``It would be hypocritical to point a finger
at only one country: rejection based on race exists on every
continent.''
   It called anti-Semitism ``the most tragic form that racist
ideology has assumed in our century,'' referring to the Nazi
extermination of millions of Jews during World War II.
   ``As if some had nothing to learn from the crimes of the past,
certain organizations, with branches in many countries, keep alive
the anti-Semite racist myth, with the support of networks of
publications,'' it said.
   The document cited terrorist attacks against Jewish people and
symbols, and said anti-Zionism ``serves at times as a screen for
anti-Semitism, feeding on it and leading to it.''
   In an apparent reference to the Soviet Union, it noted some
countries ``impose undue harassments and restrictions'' on Jewish
emigration.
   The document said the world should not forget other mass
exterminations, such as that of Armenians after World War I and
Cambodians in the 1970s.
   The document expressed fear about ``new and yet unknown forms of
racism'' that might appear as a result of artificial procreation
techniques and the possibilities of genetic manipulation for racist
ends. It called for laws to prevent this.
   The document praised the role of the Catholic church in
contributing to the passage of civil rights legislation in the
United States, but added: ``Despite ongoing efforts, much still
remains to be done to eliminate completely racial prejudice and
behavior even in what can be considered one of the most interracial
nations of the world.''
   Among other things, the document:
   _Condemned legislation that discriminates against religious
minorities, singling out the imposition of the ``sharia,'' or
Islamic law, on non-Moslems in certain countries. It did not name
them.
   _Cited problems of people who ``although living in their own
land, are subjected to humiliating conditions.'' While not naming
any people, it said in a footnote the pope has often stated
Palestinians have the right to a homeland as well as Jews.
   _Called for revision of school history texts which ``falsify
history, pass over the historical misdeeds of racism in silence or
justify the principles behind it.''

<TEXT>
   The government will try to persuade its
NATO allies to put off a decision on replacing some nuclear missiles
in Europe with longer-range rockets, a spokesman for Chancellor
Helmut Kohl said today.
   Some Western allies have viewed West Germany's position on the
plan as a test of its loyalty to the Western military alliance.
   The Kohl spokesman, Friedhelm Ost, told reporters today that West
Germany sees no need for the 16-member North Atlantic Treaty
Organization to decide the issue before 1991. The decision is now
expected to be made in June.
   The United States, Britain, and other members of the Western
alliance have already voiced support for the missile upgrading,
which is referred to as ``modernization.'' They have also suggested
the alliance lay out its position on the controversial subject
during a NATO summit expected in June.
   West German officials have been sending out conflicting signals
over the past few months on whether they will approve the
modernization plan.
   Kohl and his government have hinted they consider a decision this
year to be premature and potentially harmful to East-West
disarmament talks.
   Today, Kohl's spokesman made that position explicit.
   ``We want no decision during this dynamic disarmament process,''
Ost said.
   He refused to be pinned down, however, on whether West Germany
would go along with the rest of the alliance if allies press for the
plan at the summit.

<HEAD>South To Redefine North As Non-Hostile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has proposed a law that
would redefine North Korea as non-hostile in an effort to promote
trade and other exchanges, officials said today.
   The decision came despite a snag this week in talks aimed at
improving relations between the two Koreas.
   On Wednesday, the North postponed today's scheduled meeting of
parliament members in the border truce village of Panmunjom to
protest annual U.S.-South Korean joint miltitary exercises.
   However, South Korean officials said today that high-ranking
government officials and representatives of the governing Democratic
Justice Party made the decision to redefine North Korea as
non-hostile at a meeting Thursday.
   The participants also decided to set up a special committee to
coordinate exchanges with North Korea and other communist countries,
the officials said. They said the proposed panel will be chaired by
Prime Minister Kang Young-soon.
   Officials said a bill will be sent to the National Assembly
following an endorsement of the plan by the Cabinet next week.
   A special assembly session will convene Monday to take up several
bills, possibly the one redefining North Korea.
   The law would take precedence over security law that now defines
the North as a hostile country and bans private sector contacts with
North Koreans.
   The capitalist South is ideologically anti-communist and has
until now banned activities and publications that support or
sympathize with the North.
   South Korea and North Korea were created at the end of World War
II and fought the Korean war from 1950 to 1953. They are technically
still at war because no peace treaty was signed, and more than 1
million heavily armed soldiers face each other across the 150-mile
border.
   About 42,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea under a
1954 mutual defense treaty.
   Under the proposed law described by the officials, South Korean
nationals will be allowed to visit the North. Trade with the North
would be treated as internal commerce and imports from the North
would be exempt from import tariffs.
   Under a policy of detente, the South recently held preliminary
contacts with North Korean lawmakers and government officials. South
Korean traders also began to purchase North Korean goods.

<TEXT>
   President Bush arrived here today for talks with
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney after vowing to attack the
acid rain problem that has strained sound relations between the two
friendly neighbors.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, speaking with
reporters on Air Force One en route from Washington, said no
agreements were expected to emerge from Bush's first foreign trip as
presiden.
   On the eve of his visit here for five hours of meetings with
Mulroney, Bush declared regarding acid rain that ``the time for
study alone has passed, and the time for action is now.''
   In a speech to a joint session of Congress on Thursday night, he
urged creation of an acid rain program that would curb sulfur
dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. He said he wanted timetables
set, but didn't announce what deadlines he had in mind.
   Still, that was a step away from the policy of the Reagan
administration, which insisted for eight years that more research
was needed on acid rain and clean-coal technology before
emission-reduction timetables could be considered.
   Mulroney greeted Bush at an air base outside the city, with
Canadian and American flags snapping in the wind behind them. The
two leaders then rode in a motorcade through snow-covered
countryside to the complex of government buildings.
   The first in a series of meetings took place in the official
Canadian government guest house. Bush and Secretary of State James
A. Baker III and other top government aides sat across a long table
from Mulroney and his top assistants.
   ``We're here to do a little business,'' Mulroney said, joking at
one point that the 16-degree temperature outside was quite different
from the usual climate of Bush's adopted home state of Texas.
   Bush said in his speech to Congress that his administration would
honor a U.S. commitment to Canada to spend $2.5 billion over five
years to develop technology for burning coal more cleanly. He
proposed spending $120 million in fiscal 1990 to curb acid rain,
roughly $25 million more than that proposed by the Reagan
administration.
   Mulroney, in the early months of his second term as the
Progressive Conservative Party head of government, has called Bush a
``great friend of Canada.''
   Mulroney has said he expects a good relationship with Washington
to produce an agreement on acid rain _ an issue that has caused
lingering strains between Ottawa and Washington.
   In a letter at the front of a press book assessing U.S.-Canadian
relations, Bush said he thought it was ``entirely fitting'' that he
chose Canada for his first visit outside the United States. He
called it ``our friend and neighbor to the north.''
   In advance of Bush's trip to Ottawa, Canadian officials had
voiced hope of making headway on winning an American commitment to
precise timetables for reducing industrial emissions wafting into
Canada from the United States.
   In his proposed changes to the fiscal 1990 budget that former
President Reagan submitted, Bush indicated he will seek specific
dates for reductions of certain emissions, although the timetable
was not spelled out.
   Mulroney had a half-day of meetings, including a luncheon,
awaiting Bush and the presidential entourage, which included
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, national security adviser
Brent Scowcroft and White House chief of staff John Sununu.
   Aside from discussions of acid rain, the two leaders were
expected to review how each country will implement the U.S.-Canada
Free Trade Agreement, now approved on both sides of the border. The
pact is aimed at phasing out all trade barriers between the two
nations.
   During a visit to Washington in April 1988, Mulroney pleaded
before a joint meeting of Congress for what he conceded would be
expensive programs to clean up U.S. plant emissions. Such pollution,
he said, was responsible for half the acid rain that has killed
15,000 Canadian lakes and threatened or damaged 300,000 more.
   During a briefing for White House reporters earlier this week,
Scowcroft said he did not expect major new Bush administration
acid-rain commitments in the Ottawa talks. Bush merely reaffirmed a
commitment that Reagan had made, but he proposed spending more money
to attack the problem.
   Scowcroft said Bush believes ``the first step has to be the
domestic part of the acid rain agenda _ before he's prepared to be
all that specific with the Canadians.''
   Edward Fried, a scholar at the liberal-oriented Brookings
Institution here, said he did not think substantive issues needed to
be discussed.
   The Bush trip, Fried said, is ``a useful, inexpensive gesture to
the Canadian people and to the Canadian government. I think it's
important for both of them to say ... there are going to be
problems, but we're both going to win on this.''

   Israel remains the most reliable U.S.
ally in the world, but it must recognize that the killing of
Palestinian civilians in the strife-torn West Bank and Gaza Strip is
``clearly unacceptable,'' Vice President Dan Quayle told an American
Jewish group today.
   The uprising by Palestinians in those regions ``has resulted in
nearly 400 Palestinians being killed and many more injured,'' Quayle
said in a speech prepared for a conference of the Anti-Defamation
League of B'nai B'rith.
   ``Some may say that by the grisly standards of some of Israel's
neighbors a few hundred people killed in the course of a year-long
uprising is not a very staggering figure,'' he said.
   But, he added, Israel should be judged not by those standards but
``on the basis of standards which prevail in the democratic West.
And on the basis of these standards the status quo on the West Bank
and Gaza Strip is clearly unacceptable.''
   On the other hand, Quayle said, the recent first-ever talks
between representatives of the United States and the Palestine
Liberation Organization do not indicate any fundamental change in
attitude toward the PLO or its leader, Yasser Arafat.
   He reiterated the cautionary stance taken by Reagan
administration officials who began the dialogue in the last days
before President Bush took office.
   ``Simple prudence obliges us to monitor Mr. Arafat and his
organization very carefully, and to probe his words very closely
before arriving at a final determination,'' Quayle said.
   He added that while Arafat has recognized the state of Israel and
renounced terrorism, factions within the PLO hold opposing
viewpoints.
   The vice president's trip to Florida also included a scheduled
dinner speech to the Cuban-American Bar Association.
   Quayle, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force Two en route here,
said the new Council on Competitiveness that Bush has named him to
head would continue some of the regulatory review work handled by a
deregulation commission under former President Reagan.
   But he said it also go beyond that to look at other factors
affecting U.S. industry's competitiveness in the world. He said some
of those areas would be job training and human resources.
   Bush announced creation of the council in his budget address to
Congress Thursday night.
   Besides the new competitiveness council, Quayle's only official
duties are to head the national commission on space and to preside
over the Senate.
   The vice president has said that with very few ongoing
assignments from Bush, his principal role is to be an adviser to the
president.

<TEXT>
   Michael Manley, a social democrat who
led Jamaica in the 1970s, returned to power today after trouncing
Prime Minister Edward Seaga in a tense but generally orderly
election.
   With 65 percent of the ballots counted, the government-run
Jamaica Broadcasting Corp. network declared Manley's party the
winner of at least 34 of Parliament's 60 seats. Seaga's party took
eight seats and 18 were undecided.
   The party winning a majority of parliamentary seats forms the
government for a five-year term. Seaga's party held all 60 seats
going into the vote.
   The latest returns showed Manley's left-leaning People's National
Party leading Seaga's right-of-center Jamaica Labor Party by a 57
percent to 43 percent margin, or 429,680 votes to 324,486.
   The balloting was Jamaica's first nationally contested election
since 1980, when an estimated 700 people were killed in political
violence over a nine-month campaign.
   The killing Thursday of a pregnant housewife, Glenna Williams,
raised to at least 12 the number of people killed in politically
related violence since the campaign opened Jan. 15.
   The island was generally quiet this morning, but police reported
isolated disturbances.
   Police chased off dozens of political activists who erected
barricades of burning debris and blocked a road for about an hour
today just outside Spanish Town, the old colonial section of
Kingston. Police would not say whether the demonstrators were Manley
or Seaga supporters.
   The campaign was shortened to just over three weeks because of
fears of violence at the height of the island's tourist season.
Tourism, the main industry, has bounced back after Hurricane Gilbert
raked the island Sept. 12, killed 45 people and left about $1
billion in damage.
   Across the Caribbean island, 10,000 police and soldiers were
deployed to maintain order at more than 6,000 polling stations, but
skirmishes broke out.
   Many polling stations closed early because of violence, and
soldiers fired shots and used tear gas in many instances to break up
arguments.
   Attacks were confined mainly to slums in Kingston, the capital.
   Manley, 64, told cheering supporters outside his headquarters,
``Let us set an example for all future generations of dignity and
cooperation in victory. ``(It is) not given to many people a second
chance to serve a nation.''
   Manley was prime minister from 1972 to 1980. His government then
embraced Cuba, alarming the United States and foreign investors. But
he has moderated his views and today seeks a ``new beginning'' with
the Bush administration.
   ``I am wiser, more experienced man,'' he said in a recent
interview.
   In his concession speech, Seaga indicated he would not challenge
the results despite his earlier allegations of fraud.
   ``The people have spoken and we abide by their decision,'' Seaga
told supporters at his party headquarters. ``We can hold our heads
high as a previous government and we'll hold our heads high as an
opposition.''
   Manley and the People's National Party boycotted the last
election in 1983 in a dispute over voter registration.
   First elected in 1980, Seaga, 58, was trying for a third
consecutive term, something no prime minister has done since
universal suffrage began in 1944.
   Seaga, Boston-born and Harvard-educated, was the closest U.S.
ally in the Caribbean. He was the first official visitor to the
Reagan White House in 1981, and supported the U.S. invasion of
Grenada in 1983.
   Seaga restructured the economy by emphasizing exports, raising
taxes and laying off thousands of government workers. Although the
economy grew it did not recover from the collapse of the vital
bauxite industry in 1983, and the standard of living of Jamaica's
2.4 million people fell.
   He is regarded as a skillful manager, but aloof and autocratic.
Manley, a powerful orator with an engaging personality, is seen by
supporters a champion of the little people.
   In the 1970s, Manley alienated the United States and foreign
investors, broke off with the International Monetary Fund and
plunged Jamaica into economic chaos.
   Manley has said he would re-establish diplomatic relations with
Cuba _ broken in 1980 by Seaga _ but that a greater priority would
be given to the U.S. ties and relations with international lending
agencies and business.

   A doctor who was forced to resign as the
director of a hospital and as a psychiatry professor at Harvard
Medical School because of plagiarism has a new appointment at the
hospital.
   McLean Hospital trustees said Thursday they named Dr. Shervert H.
Frazier as a staff psychiatrist with full admitting privileges.
   They also named him psychiatrist in chief emeritus, an honorary
position that ``recognizes Dr. Frazier's prominent place in
psychiatry and his former role as psychiatrist in chief'' of the
hospital, trustees said.
   Frazier, a 67-year-old former director of the National Institute
of Mental Health, has not been re-appointed to the Harvard faculty.
   Dr. Daniel Tosteson, dean of the Harvard Medical School, asked
Frazier to resign from the school and the hospital four months ago
after an investigation by medical school officials revealed he
plagiarized other people's work in four papers published between
1966 and 1975. A graduate student first noted the plagiarism.
   In a prepared statement, Tosteson said the new appointment to
McLean ``expresses appropriate respect and gratitude for Dr.
Frazier's many years of service as an administrator and physician
concerned for the care of the mentally ill.''
   McLean, a 328-bed psychiatric hospital, is affliated with Harvard.
   Telephone calls to Frazier's office today were not returned, and
McLean spokeswoman Sandra Judd said, ``He does not want to make a
public comment.''

   A bomb exploded today outside
an army medical building in a Johannesburg business district,
injuring 10 people, police said.
   The building's entryway was damaged, and windows in adjoining
office buildings were shattered. Ten passers-by _ eight whites and
two blacks _ were slightly injured by flying glass and taken to a
hospital, said Col. Frans Malherbe, a police spokesman.
   They were treated and released from a hospital.
   The Soviet-made mine exploded at 1:21 p.m. on a window ledge of
army's regional medical headquarters, Malherbe said.
   There have been scores of bombings in Johannesburg and other
cities the past three years, virtually all of them blamed by police
on the African National Congress guerrilla movement. Limpet mines,
which can be attached to other objects, have been used in many of
the bombings.
   The ANC has declined to confirm or deny responsibility for most
recent bombings.
   On Thursday, a limpet mine planted in a police van exploded on a
highway in the port city of Durban, injuring two policemen and a
pedestrian.

   Four Wyoming counties surrounding
Yellowstone National Park received an economic boost from the forest
fires that raged in and around the park last year, according to a
state report issued today.
   Although the park's tourist flow plummeted in August, September
and October as the infernos charred thousands of acres, sales tax
collections in Park, Teton, Sublette and Fremont counties showed an
increase from a year earlier, the report said.
   ``On the premise that visitors were held rather `captive' in
Jackson, Cody and the surrounding area (due to park closures), and
that thousands of firefighters were brought into the area, the
boosted sales tax figures are fairly understandable,'' it said.
   Prepared by the Department of Administration and Fiscal Control's
Research and Statistics Division, the report said the four counties'
sales tax collections jumped 4.94 percent in June, July, August and
October from the year before.
   Statewide, sales tax collections through the same period were up
6.78 percent, the report said.
   ``The areas most affected were the retail and service related
sectors,'' the report's authors said in analyzing the collections.
``In reviewing the following data for these particular sectors, it
appeared that the `impact' was generally of a positive nature
instead of negative, in terms of taxable sales.''
   The four counties realized a 4.94 percent increase in sales tax
collections, from $8.8 million during the period in 1987 to $9.2
million last year.
   With roughly half of the 2.2-million-acre park blackened by the
firestorms, visitation to Yellowstone in 1988 was off 17.2 percent
as a result of the fires, the report noted.
   The number of visitors was down 50,724 in July 1988 compared to
July 1987; down 187,695 in August 1988 compared to August 1987; and
off 186,129 in September 1988 compared to September 1987.
   In October, however, tourists flooded the park as the fires died
down. While 125,597 people visited Yellowstone in October 1987, the
total jumped 39.3 percent in October 1988 to 175,019.

<HEAD>New Jersey Says Wrestling May Look Nasty, But It's Really A Safe
Profession</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fierce-looking professional wrestlers may
grunt, groan and pound bodies to the canvas amid the roars of
frenzied fans, but don't be fooled.
   These big guys aren't really hurting each other, says the New
Jersey State Senate. Senators on Thursday passed a bill to remove
professional wrestling from the strict safety regulations posed by
the state Athletic Control Board.
   ``Wrestling is an entertainment event which poses little serious
risk to the participants,'' said state Sen. Francis J. McManimon,
the bill's sponsor. ``The strict regulatory procedures needed to
protect the health of boxers are not needed for professional
wrestling.''
   McManimon said his bill would attract more wrestling events to
New Jersey because wrestlers would be free from the state's tight
safety regulations of boxers, including requirements that a doctor
and an ambulance be at the matches. The bill now heads to the state
Assembly.
   And those snarling behemoths who regularly tell tales of how they
will terrorize their opponents aren't objecting to reports that
their body slams pose no serious health dangers.
   Officials from the World Wrestling Federation are seeking wider
access to the potentially lucrative New Jersey market, which
includes the Atlantic City casinos.
   The officials recently admitted in a legislative hearing that
Hulk Hogan and other big-name wrestlers perform in a sport of
entertainment in which participants are trained to avoid serious
injury.

   A Boeing 737 operated by the Mozambican
airline LAM overshot a runway after landing in bad weather, and five
of 108 people aboard were injured, it was reported Friday.
   The accident occurred Thursday in the northern town of Lichinga
during a regularly scheduled flight between Maputo and three other
cities, the news agency AIM.
   The jetliner touched down on the runway but failed to stop in
time and overshot the landing strip by about 100 yards, the news
agency said.
   The plane was badly damaged, the agency said. It gave no further
details on the accident.

   Security forces also visited the offices of the magazine and told
its news editor and senior writer to report to police.
   Nigeria's government has pledged to respect press freedom, but it
has detained journalists on several occasions for reporting on its

   A Vietnamese delegation arrived Friday to help
arrange the first large-scale repatriation of boat people willing to
return home.
   It was the first time a delegation from Hanoi has visited this
British colony.
   The four-member team will interview and issue travel documents to
83 Vietnamese boat people who have asked to return home, Hong Kong
government spokesman Akber Khan said.
   Vietnam earlier cleared repatriation of 145 Vietnamese from Hong
Kong, but some changed their minds, Khan said.
   There are more than 25,000 Vietnamese in Hong Kong camps,
including about 15,000 waiting to be resettled overseas. About
10,000 arrived under a tough new policy put into effect last June
that subjects them to forced repatriation if they cannot prove they
were persecuted in Vietnam.
   Hanoi says it will treat returnees well, and U.N. officials have
agreed to help them put their lives back in order.

   A herd of elephants forced residents of a
coastal town to remain indoors overnight and allowed nightclub
revelers to enjoy themselves long after legal closing hours, a news
agency reported.
   The residents of Kwale said residents fled indoors and locked
themselves inside when 20 elephants strolled into town about 8:30
p.m. Wednesday, the state-owned Kenya News Agency reported.
   Bar patrons, afraid of provoking the elephants into stampeding,
stayed put until Thursday morning.
   All these precautions proved unnecessary. The elephants finally
settled in the town's playground for the night, and leisurely
strolled to the nearby Shimba Hills at dawn.
   Elephants have been known to destroy crops by stampeding through
farms around Kwale, about 18 miles southwest of the Indian Ocean
port of Mombasa. The Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife is installing
an electrified fence to confine them inside nearby Tsavo West
National Park.

<DATELINE>PONTIAC, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three elementary schools disciplined
special-education students by locking them inside wooden
``time-out'' boxes for up to 30 minutes, a punishment one critic
said has not been seen ``since the Dark Ages.''
   The state began an investigation into use of the boxes after a
12-year-old boy escaped from one last month. The boxes have not been
used since at Washington Elementary School, principal Lyle Stine
said.
   The boxes, measuring about 3 feet by 3 feet and 7 feet tall, are
used ``in extreme cases as a very last resort,'' Stine said. They
are used for pupils who have ``behavior disorders'' and need
isolation.
   ``The only reason we do this is when we feel it's needed for the
safety of the kids or the teachers,'' he said.
   ``I would prefer not having to use it, but sometimes you have no
choice,'' Stine said today, adding that he would rather use a room
instead, but there is not one available.
   The State Board of Education is reviewing the practice and is
expected to issue a report by the end of next week, the the Peoria
Journal Star said in a story published today.
   ``We don't necessarily oppose time-out procedures when used
appropriately,'' said Rene Christensen, the board's consultant for
the severely and multiply handicapped. ``We do not condone the use
of boxes.''
   Time-out is a common disciplinary method in which a special
education child who misbehaves is separated from classmates.
   But use of a box for discipline has not been seen ``since the
Dark Ages,'' said Michelle Hall Bolden of the Champaign-based
Protection and Advocacy Inc., a watchdog group advocating the rights
of the mentally ill and disabled that is considering lawsuits to
fight the practice.
   ``The box I saw is in a vacant room. Why not use just the vacant
room?'' she said.
   Children are kept up to 30 minutes in a box, which is equipped
with a lock, Ms. Bolden said, adding that it seems cramped.
   Stine, however, said the box is not cramped.
   ``You can easily get three people in there,'' he said.
   Stine said use of the box is the culmination of a 10-step
``assertive discipline process,'' which includes a trip to the
principal's office.
   Three elementary schools at Pontiac, a central Illinois town of
11,000, use the boxes because they have special education students.

<DATELINE>HARLINGEN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City officials, citing health and fire
code violations, today evicted the Immigration and Naturalization
Service from a building where it processes thousands of political
asylum applicants.
   The city fire marshal and police cleared the building of INS
personnel and immigrants about 10 a.m., then chained and padlocked
two main entryways. Another door was sealed with duct tape.
   ``We are finally forced to take this drastic action,'' Mayor Bill
Card said. ``It's a situation where we have not been able to get the
cooperation and the attention of the federal government.''
   The City Commission also voted to sue the federal agency. Card
said his city will seek a state district court injunction to keep
the INS building closed. Both votes were unanimous.
   Omer Sewell, the director of the INS' Harlingen district covering
south Texas, said he was shocked by the city's action.
   ``All I know is there's a notice on the door that says the
building is not safe for habitation,'' Sewell said.
   INS officials had received notice of the code infractions from
the city three days ago and were attempting to make corrections,
Sewell said.
   ``We don't know what is happening,'' said Juan Francisco Mayrena,
a Nicaraguan amnesty applicant who was waiting in a van packed with
about 15 other Central Americans.
   On some nights, scores of Central Americans sleep outside the INS
building and the grounds are strewn with litter. Nearby vacant lots
are dotted with human waste, Card said.
   Seating inside the building exceeds a maximum set under city fire
codes, Card said.
   ``The city of Harlingen happens to be the community where the INS
processing center is located, and so it's our responsibility to our
citizens to see that that facility is operated in a proper manner,''
Card said.
   ``It's unsanitary. It's a nuisance. And we're not going to allow
for it to be operated any further,'' the mayor said after meeting
with city commissioners in a closed session this morning.
   The INS has been processing about 2,000 primarily Central
American political asylum applicants weekly in this city 25 miles
north of the border city of Brownsville.
   Hundreds of Central Americans began piling up at the southern tip
of Texas after the INS on Dec. 16 began a policy of restricting
asylum applicants to the INS' Harlingen district while their cases
were being reviewed.
   A U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela in Brownsville on Jan. 9
issued a temporary restraining order forcing the immigration service
to once again allow asylum applicants to travel on to their U.S.
destinations to pursue their claims for refugee status.
   But Vela has said he probably will allow the INS to resume its
travel-restricting policy on Feb. 20.

<TEXT>
   The Security Council met today to debate
Israel's methods of combating the Palestinian uprising in the
occupied lands. The meeting came after a U.S. report criticized the
Israeli crackdown.
   The PLO has tried since mid-January to draft a resolution
condemning the Israeli army's use of rubber and plastic bullets and
tear gas but has been unable to formulate language that the United
States will not veto.
   About a week ago the PLO gave up and withdrew its resolution
after U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters said he would veto any
language that did not also call on the Palestinians to restrain
their protests.
   More than 370 Palestinians have been killed in protests since the
uprising began in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in December
1987.
   Fifteen Jews also have died in clashes.
   Asked about the latest resolution, Riyad H. Mansour, the PLO's
deputy permanent U.N. observer, said the language was still being
drafted, but ``it condemns the Israeli policies and practices.''
   ``We expect a resolution to be adopted that will allow the
Security Council to really assume its responsibility to stop the
Israelis from the continuation of this onslaught against our
people,'' said Mansour.
   ``There will be reference to human rights violations, especially
as it is coming from the United States, the closest friend to
Israel.''
   The Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Arab League
renewed their efforts after the State Department criticized the
Israeli army in a human rights report for tactics that caused ``many
avoidable deaths and injuries.''

<HEAD>Baryshnikov A Good Bug in `Metamorphosis'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DURHAM, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail Baryshnikov earned bravos as a bug
from the North Carolina critics in the Broadway-bound stage version
of Franz Kafka's ``Metamorphosis,'' now playing at Duke University.
   Tony Brown of The Charlotte Observer, the state's largest
newspaper, called the dancer's stage acting debut ``powerful,''
adding, ``The surprise is that Baryshnikov _ in his first acting
role in which he does not play a dancer _ does so well in the
speaking parts.''
   As for the play, written and directed by Steven Berkoff, Brown
predicted it would be a success on Broadway, drawing ``dance fans,
Kafka nuts, Berkoff followers and the strictly curious. And the
show's sheer power will win over the critics.''
   In the Raleigh News and Observer, Harry Hargrave described
Baryshnikov as ``simply amazing,'' saying his performance was ``an
exhausting and very physical tour de force'' in the 95-minute play,
which is performed with no intermission.
   Jim Wise of the Durham Morning Herald said the 41-year-old dance
superstar ``does make an engaging bug. A sympathetic one, even. More
importantly, a metaphorical one, which engages a viewer's
fellow-feeling and renders `Metamorphosis,' surreal as it is, a
moving expression of human feeling.''
   But Wise thought the stage adaptation was ``not overwhelming
theater. Despite the show's frequent humor and rapid,
intermission-less pace, the tedium that is part of its theme
eventually catches up with the showmanship. Even so, however, the
story's essential humanity shines through.''
   Abe D. Jones Jr. of the Greensboro News &amp; Record said Baryshnikov
``seems perfect for the role'' of Gregor Samsa, a young man who
wakes up one day and finds he has started to turn into an insect.
   Not that the production needed favorable reviews to do good
business at the 640-seat Reynolds Industries Theater at Duke. The
run, which ends Feb. 25, has been sold out for weeks.
   ``Metamorphosis'' opens on Broadway on March 6 at the Ethel
Barrymore Theater.

<TEXT>
   A fisherman from Maine who knew a
bargain when he saw one ended up getting a fishing boat valued at
$55,000 for just $10 in a government auction.
   The government lost $3,000 to $4,000 in storage, advertising,
maintenance and towing costs on the deal, said U.S. Marshal Donald
W. Wyatt.
   ``One man's loss is another man's gain,'' said the buyer, Mark
Lewis of Brunswick, Maine, who once was a member of the crew of the
boat.
   The auction Thursday of the 65-foot Sandra and Cindy, which was
seized by the government after it was used to smuggle hashish, was
expected to draw more interest, but Lewis was the only bidder, said
Wyatt.
   ``We didn't expect to get a good price for it _ it was built in
1945 and had been laid up here since last June _ but we expected to
get several thousand dollars,'' Wyatt said. ``He got himself a
bargain.''
   Although the vessel was appraised at $55,000, it may have been
overvalued, and will require several thousand dollars' worth of
repairs, he added.
   Lewis was a member of the boat's crew in the early 1970s, long
before it became involved in the $30 million smuggling scheme. The
boat was used to carry at least 8 tons of hashish from a freighter
offshore to the harbor at Point Judith, Wyatt said.
   Last month, two people were convicted in federal court in
Providence on charges stemming from the drug smuggling. They face
sentencing March 30.

   The anti-racism statement issued by the Vatican
on Friday was hailed by U.S. Roman Catholic officials as a the
church's most comprehensive repudiation yet of prejudice in its many
forms.
   Jewish leaders also praised the document for its extensive
condemnation of anti-Semitism, often in the name of anti-Zionism.
   The document was seen as likely to increase awareness of the
problem and spur efforts to eradicate it.
   Auxiliary Bishop John Ricard of Baltimore, chairman of the
bishops' committee for black Roman Catholics, called the document
``a milestone,'' and added:
   ``It is the first time in my memory that the Holy See has
explictly singled out the issue, and dealt with it in such breadth
and depth as a primary factor in human evil.''
   He said racism is pinpointed as a ``multiple problem'' because of
the tendency to treat various groups as inferior, whether because of
skin color, ethnicity, nationality, religion or economic status.
   ``I think the document should be extremely helpful to us, and to
our brothers and sisters of South Africa who are under institutional
racism,'' he said.
   John Carr, social-development secretary for the U.S. Catholic
Conference in Washington, noted that the document strongly condemns
the South African system of apartheid, or enforced racial
separation. ``This is particularly important at this time,'' he said.
   He said the document points up ``the connections'' between
various forms of racism, linking prejudices againt blacks, the poor,
immigrants, Jews, Hispanics, foreigners and others as ``assaults on
human dignity.''
   ``This is the first time for a statement of this magnitude,'' he
said.
   Eugene Fisher, director of the Catholic bishops' office for
Catholic-Jewish relations, said the document ``was the first
official church statement to link anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism,''
which is strongly condemned.
   ``This should be helpful,'' he said, observing that
``anti-Zionism often is used as a cover'' for anti-Jewishness. In
the United Nations, Arab representatives often assail ``Zionism,''
or Jewish commitment to their biblical homeland, claiming such a
stance is not anti-Semitic.
   Rabbi James Rudin, interreligious affairs director of the
American Jewish Committee, said the document ``is a clear and
powerful repudiation of all forms of racism and bigotry.''
   ``It represents another effective weapon in the global struggle
to eradicate these cancerous mythologies from the human family,'' he
said. He particurlarly applauded the statement that anti-Zionism is
used as a ``screen for anti-Semistism.''
   Fisher said the document seems to attempt a ``theory of racism in
all its manifestations'' as ``one of the fundamental evils of our
times.''
   ``It's the first document that attempts this kind of depth
analysis, putting racism into its larger context,'' he said. ``The
phenmomenon of prejudice and animosities in the world have the same
dynamics.''
   ``Hatred is hatred,'' he said, whether directed at blacks,
immigrants, the poor, foreigners or other groups treated as
inferiors because of external factors.
   He said the document should ``help expand the horizons of
Americans by its dynamics. I would like to see it become a
centerpiece of educational efforts in communities across the
country.''
   Ronaldo Cruz, associate director of the bishops' office for
Hispanic affairs, said the document offers a ``broader perspective''
on racism, including all sorts of victims, even the handicapped.
   ``It puts things into perspective as an educational tool,'' he
said. He said it is important'' in clarifying the ``connectedness''
of differing kinds of prejudices.

<TEXT>
   President Bush is asking Congress to vote a tax
cut for the nation's wealthiest people and a new tax benefit for
some of America's poorest families.
   The tax portions of his budget plan also include canceling a
scheduled reduction in taxes on airline tickets and cargo, making
permanent the 3 percent tax on telephone service, raising Social
Security taxes on 2 million state and local government workers, and
cutting taxes on corporations in general and the oil industry in
particular.
   In a message to Congress Thursday night, the new president showed
no qualms about tinkering with the landmark 1986 tax overhaul, even
though some congressional leaders suggest any significant change
could lead to a complete unraveling.
   He is likely to gain wide support for some version of a new
day-care tax credit that he recommended to help 2.5 million poorer
working families. A family with at least one worker and with income
under $13,000 could get a tax cut of up to $1,000 a year for each
child under age 4. The credit could even exceed the family's tax
liability.
   On the other hand, Bush is assured a fight over his plan to tax
capital gains _ profits from the sale of stock, real estate and
other assets _ at a lower rate than applies to wages and other
income. The change is necessary, he said, to maintain American
leadership in the world.
   ``Lower capital-gains rates will stimulate investment and
economic growth and create additional jobs for Americans,'' Bush
said in a written message.
   Several hours earlier, the senior tax-writer in Congress, Rep.
Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., had anticipated the proposal and wasted
neither time nor verbiage in showing his distaste.
   ``I personally will strongly resist any effort to undo (the 1986)
tax reform, including the return to a preferential tax rate for
capital gains,'' Rostenkowski said. ``I'm not about to tell the wage
earners in Chicago that they should pay a higher tax than
stockbrokers.''
   Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,
contends restoring the capital-gains break would open the door to
re-enacting other deductions and exemptions that were eliminated or
reduced in order to pay for across-the-board cuts in overall tax
rates.
   Many Democrats also have problems because the lion's share of
capital gains are enjoyed by the nation's richest taxpayers.
   More than 34 percent of the $135 billion in taxable gains that
were reported on returns filed in 1987 were recorded by 34,818
taxpayers whose incomes exceeded $1 million apiece, the Internal
Revenue Service says. Their gains averaged $1.3 million.
   Seventy percent of the overall gain went to 1.15 million people
with incomes over $100,000 each.
   Bush said the cut would generate such investment activity that it
would bring the government more _ not less _ revenue. Over the next
five years, he said, it would increase tax collections by $16
billion, although it would cost the treasury $20 billion during the
following three years. Many economists ridicule the no-cost theory.
   Capital gains and wages now are taxed the same: at rates of 15
percent, 28 percent and 33 percent. Bush wants a new system that
when fully effective would tax most gains at a top rate of 15
percent if assets were owned more than 36 months; people with lower
incomes would pay as low as 8.25 percent. Paintings and other
collectibles would not qualify.
   Couples with adjusted gross incomes under $20,000 and single
people under $10,000 would pay no tax on any qualified capital gain.
   The president apparently dumped a suggestion advanced last month
by then-President Reagan, which would have required the IRS to
charge taxpayers for telephone calls with questions about how to
file their tax returns.
   Bush did ask Congress to:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Make permanent the 3 percent tax on local and long-distance
telephone service, which otherwise would expire Dec. 31, 1990. This
would cost taxpayers $6 billion in the following three years.
   _Require 2 million state and local government workers hired
before April 1, 1986, to pay a tax for Medicare, which many already
qualify for because of a prior, non-government job or a working
spouse. The tax, collected as part of the Social Security levy, is
1.45 percent of the first $48,000 of annual earnings.
   _Retain the full federal taxes on airline tickets, air cargo and
aviation fuel, which are due to drop by half next year.
   _Permit a deduction of up to $3,000 for expenses of adopting a
child with special needs, such as a physical handicap.
   _Give the oil and gas industry tax credits for the first $10
million of expenditures each year on such intangible oil-drilling
expenses as labor and pipe, and for spending required to use
sophisticated ``tertiary'' techniques to produce oil. Rules that
hinder the sale of proven oil properties to independent producers
would be repealed. Independent producers would be allowed to deduct
from the minimum tax 80 percent of certain exploratory intangible
drilling costs.
   _Make permanent a 20 percent credit for increased corporate
spending for research, and permit international corporations to
deduct 67 percent of total research spending against domestic income.
   _Give businesses $1 billion worth of tax incentives over four
years for locating in economically distressed areas.

   A fire raced through a hotel today,
injuring 11 people and leaving at least three others unaccounted
for, as subfreezing temperatures forced firefighters to draw water
from a river a half-mile away.
   The fire at the Wall Block Inn was reported about 4 a.m., said
Mike Hatlin, a supervisor with the Chester County fire and rescue
dispatch service.
   Twenty-five to 30 people living at the hotel were evacuated to a
nearby building, where the American Red Cross aided victims, said
Sue Pinkham, a spokeswoman for the county Emergency Services
Department.
   ``There are between three and five unaccounted for,'' she said.
``To my knowledge, nobody's been allowed to go into the building to
do a search for anybody.''
   More than 200 firefighters responded to the fire, which was
declared under control at about 7:40 a.m., Mrs. Pinkham said. The
cause was under investigation.
   The weather slowed water flowing through mains and forced
firefighters to draw water from the Schuylkill River, Mrs. Pinkham
said. Phoenixville is about 25 miles northeast of Philadelphia.
   One man was critically burned and transferred to a Philadelphia
hospital. Two people were admitted to Phoenixville Hospital, six
others were treated for minor injuries and two rescue workers were
being examined, officials said.

   A group of Chicago doctors and other
medical personnel arrived Friday to operate free-of-charge on 100
Thai children born with cleft lips and palates, a Thai doctor said.
   The group, from Chicago, will leave Monday for Chaiyaphum in
northeastern Thailand, where children from one to 12 years of age
await operations to correct the birth defect, said the doctor, Dusit
Sundaranu.
   The 16 Americans _ seven doctors and nine other medical
specialists _ will stay for six days. Thai doctors will assist the
team and arrange follow-up care.
   Dr. Craig Bradley, the plastic surgeon leading the group, has
said the doctors would volunteer their time and pay their own fare.
Some funds for supplies were provided by Rush-Presbyterian-St.Luke's
Medical Center in Chicago, where Bradley works.

<HEAD>Brown New Democratic Chairman, Says Election of Black `Made History'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ronald H. Brown, telling Democrats ``you have
made history,'' was elected chairman of his party Friday, becoming
the first black to head a major political party. He immediately
urged Americans to ``set labels aside.''
   ``My chairmanship will not be about race; it will be about the
races we win over the next four years,'' he told cheering members of
the Democratic National Committee.
   The former aide to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and adviser to Jesse
Jackson outdistanced four opponents in recent weeks and was
unopposed Friday as he won election to a four-year term at the helm
of a party that is struggling to reverse a string of defeats in
presidential elections.
   ``I couldn't be prouder,'' said outgoing chairman Paul G. Kirk
Jr. as he handed the gavel to Brown.
   Democratic Party officials, who had openly feared that Brown's
bid for the chairmanship would split the party along racial lines,
stood and cheered.
   ``He's his own man,'' said Florida Democratic chairman Charles
Whitehead, who nominated Brown for chairman.
   When the campaign to succeed Kirk began, Whitehead and most other
Southern party leaders were looking for an alternative to Brown.
There also was opposition among some Jewish Democrats concerned
about his involvement with Jackson.
   Six leaders of major Jewish organizations circulated a letter
they sent to Brown ``welcoming your election'' and saying ``we are
confident that you bring to this critical post the same commitment
and effectiveness in achieving unity that you demonstrated during
the recent campaign.''
   ``There is no need to dwell on, but we cannot ignore, the history
of this moment,'' Brown said after his election.
   ``In choosing the first American of African descent to lead one
of America's major political parties, you have made history.''
   Then, in a wry reference to the early opposition to his
candidacy, Brown said, ``I know some people are wondering just what
kind of history we've made.''
   ``Let me speak frankly,'' he went on ``I did not run on the basis
of race, but I will not run away from it. I am proud of who I am and
I am proud of this party, for we are truly America's last, best hope
to bridge the divisions of race and region and religion and
ethnicity.''
   He recalled John F. Kennedy's need to overcome opposition to
electing a Catholic as president and said, ``I ask America to do as
you have done _ I ask America to set labels aside _ and I know
America will do so.''
   As the nation approaches the 1990 Census, which will require a
redrawing of congressional and state legislative district lines to
reflect population shifts, Brown said the goal was to win 600 more
legislative seats for the Democrats.
   State legislatures have a key role in drawing the new district
lines and both major parties are devoting resources to legislative
elections between now and 1991.
   But, said Brown, the political contest over the next four years
``will not be one about tactics, but one about values. Given that
matchup, I have nothing but confidence about the future.''
   Democrats are painfully aware they have lost five of the last six
presidential elections, four of them by landslide margins.
   ``We need to chart a roadmap to the presidency,'' said Brown ``a
roadmap that includes the South and the West.''
   ``We need to say flat out: There is no one tougher than Democrats
when it comes to protecting our children from drugs, when it comes
to protecting our cities against crime, and when it comes to
protecting our nation against terrorism and aggression,'' said the
new chairman.
   The Democratic National Committee also elected Robert Farmer as
party treasurer.
   Jack Otero, a vice president of the Transportation-Communications
International Union, was elected a vice chairman with responsibility
for voter registration.
   Other vice chairs elected were Lynn Cutler of the District of
Columbia, Carmen O. Perez of California and Mayor Lottie Shackelford
of Little Rock, Ark.

<TEXT>
   A 12-year-old elephant selected to
carry the sacred tooth of Buddha in an annual festival arrived in
Colombo on Friday en route to his new home at Sri Lanka's holiest
shrine.
   Indiraja, a 4,884-pound elephant named for former Indian Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi, will live at the Temple of the Tooth, the
Buddhist shrine in the central mountain town of Kandy, and will
participate in the temple's annual pageant.
   Indiraja was taken off a West German cargo vessel, the
Quibeluberg, after a 48-hour voyage from Madras in south India.
   He will be trained to replace Raja, the elephant who held pride
of place in the Kandy pageant.
   A golden casket containing a tooth believed to be from the Lord
Buddha is carried by the lead elephant during a ceremonial
procession, the high point of the festival.
   Raja died last year at the age of 82, and plunged the
predominantly Buddhist nation into grief. The elephant had been
declared a national treasure by former President Junius R.
Jayewardene.
   The search for a replacement was not easy, said Niranjan
Wijeratne, the temple's chief custodian. According to custom, the
elephant's tail and trunk should touch the ground in a perfect arc,
the sign of a pachyderm with poise.
   Indiraja was found in a south Indian zoo by Wijeratne after
months of searching. The elephant was then donated to the temple by
Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, the son of Indira Gandhi.
   Indiraja will rest at the Colombo Zoo before he leaves for Kandy,
about 50 miles to the northeast, said zoo director Bradley Fernando.

<HEAD>Arens Supports Soviet Role in Talks, Opposes Land for Peace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens has expressed
support for a Soviet role in Middle East peace talks but said Israel
is not prepared to consider trading occupied territory for peace.
   Arens has opposed Soviet participation in negotiations along with
other permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.
   In an interview with the daily Jerusalem Post, however, he said
he now believes Moscow could play a useful role.
   ``I would say, in principle, any country might contribute to the
peace process if it has good will, if it's truly interested in the
stability of the area, and if in addition it has something to
contribute,'' he said in the interview, published in the newspaper's
Friday editions.
   ``I think the Soviet Union falls in that category. ... My
impression is that they want to contribute in that area, and since
they have influence with some countries in the area I would say in
principle, `yes' to Soviet participation,'' Arens said.
   Arens also said he would not support a peace initiative that
included relinquishing any of the occupied West Bank or Gaza Strip,
and that he opposed removing Jewish settlers from the lands.
   ``Just what part of the territories Israel would retreat from ...
and just where the secure boundaries for Israel are, that's a
subject for interpretation,'' Arens said. ``It bears directly on a
permanent settlement and is not something that is usefully discussed
at the present time.''
   The Palestine Liberation Organization has called for resolving
the Arab-Israel problem through an international peace conference
sponsored by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council: the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and
China.
   Although accepting some role for Moscow, Arens repeated his
opposition to an international conference.
   He also said he was encouraged by progress toward resuming
diplomatic ties with Moscow.
   The Soviets halted diplomatic relations after the 1967 Middle
East war, in which Israel seized the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Golan
Heights from the Soviet Union's Arab allies.
   Israel has made normalization of ties a condition for Soviet
participation in peace negotiations.

   A man accused of killing 14 members of
his family punched a prosecutor today in front of the jury and a
crowded courtroom hearing his murder trial.
   R. Gene Simmons, 48, and lawyers in the case were in conference
at the bench of Johnson County Circuit Court Judge John Patterson
when Simmons struck out with his right fist and hit Prosecutor John
Bynum on the chin.
   As Simmons struggled and Bynum regained his balance, law
enforcement officers swarmed Simmons, subdued him and hustled him
out of the courtroom.
   Some spectators shrieked and several relatives of the people
Simmons is accused of killing ducked to the floor and huddled over
each other.
   ``I'm all right,'' Bynum said. ``He just got me one time. I'm all
right.''
   Bynum said the conference was about how much more time would be
needed to complete the trial, which began Monday.
   The scuffle took place in full view of the jury.
   A few minutes later, Patterson had the jury brought back to the
court and announced that the trial would take a recess for lunch.
   ``I want you to set aside what happened in the courtroom just
now,'' Patterson said. ``This trial has gone on five days. We want
to finish it if we can. You need to disregard the incident that
happened here today.''
   Defense lawyers said they were shocked by the attack and said
they were considering seeking a mistrial.
   Earlier today, firearms expert Burwin Monroe of the state Crime
Lab in Little Rock testified that a gun handed to authorities by
Simmons was one that fired the bullets that killed several victims.
   Monroe cited tests that showed a .22-caliber revolver which
Simmons had when he surrendered after a 40-minute shooting rampage
in Russellville on Dec. 28, 1987, fired the shots that killed his
wife, eldest son, and others whose bodies were found that day in
Simmons' house or the next day in a nearby grave.
   On Thursday, defense and state attorneys blamed each other for
leaking a statement to the press in which Simmons said he would see
his eldest daughter in hell.
   Simmons made the remark about Sheila Marie McNulty, 24, in a
written statement found in his safe-deposit box in a bank in
Russellville.
   Simmons also apparently refers to Mrs. McNulty's husband, Dennis
McNulty, 33, in the note.
   ``You have destroyed me,'' Simmons wrote. ``I do not want D. to
set foot on my property. He turned you against me. You want me out
of your life. I will be out of your life. I will see you in hell.''
   A three-page transcript of Simmons' five-page handwritten
statement was published in Thursday editions of the Arkansas
Democrat, a Little Rock newspaper.
   The bodies of the McNultys and 12 other members of Simmons'
family were found at his home on Dec. 28 and Dec. 29, 1987,
following Simmons' arrest for a shooting rampage in Russellville
that left two people dead. Simmons was sentenced to death for the
two Russellville killings last year and has tried to waive appeals
of his death sentence, saying he wants to die.
   Patterson said he was disappointed at the disclosure of the
statement, which appears to be notes Simmons made to himself,
possibly to prepare for a telephone conversation with his daughter.
   ``I think evidence ought to come out in the trial, not in the
newspapers,'' Patterson said.

<HEAD>Authorities Reclassify Charges, Fail to Release Him</HEAD>

   Authorities on Friday modified the charges
against detained prominent playwright Vaclav Havel but did not
release him, his brother said Friday.
   Ivan Havel expressed optimisim the prosecutor won't indict his
brother, who was arrested with eight other dissidents Jan. 16 on
Prague's Wenceslas Square during a peaceful rally.
   Palach Press, a London-based newsletter monitoring events in
Czechoslovakia, said the fact that Havel was not released indicates
authorities are planning to put him on trial despite a mounting
campaign at home and abroad calling for his freedom.
   Palach Press also noted that Havel continues to be under arrest
although all three possible reasons for officially justifying
continued detention no longer exist. These include being a
particular danger to society, influencing witnesses while at large,
and the danger of repeating the offense.
   Havel was arrested for taking part in a peaceful demonstration to
mark the death in 1969 of Jan Palach, who burned himself alive to
protest the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia, and for
allegedly calling for such a rally in a foreign radio broadcast.
   The modification of the charges against Havel was announced by
his lawyer, Josef Lzicar, according to Ivan Havel, who spoke in a
telephone interview with The Associated Press.
   While a previous charge was for hooliganism, Havel is now charged
with violating the law in dealing with instigation of other persons
to commit a crime, an offense punishable by up to two years in
prison.
   The playwright, whose works have long been banned in
Czechoslovakia, is also charged with obstruction of the exercise of
the authority of a public official, punishable by up to six months
in prison.
   The material against Havel now goes to a prosecutor who must
decide whether it warrants indictment. If it does he must daw up the
indictment and inform the accused and his lawyer of the trial date a
week in advance, Palach Press said.
   The other six detained Jan. 16 were released on Jan. 25, but
they, too, face indictment. Still in detention are Jana Petrova of
the Independent Peace Association and Otakar Veverka of the John
Lennon Peace Club.

<HEAD>Pioneering Needle Exchange Wins Final Approval</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pioneering hypodermic needle exchange to
fight AIDS has won final approval from the county health board
despite last-minute opposition from some business owners.
   The program to give addicts free needles when they turn in used
ones was started on a private basis in August by former drug
counselor Dave Purchase. Final approval of a government role in the
effort came Thursday when the the Tacoma-Pierce County Health Board
approved $43,000 to provide Purchase with a van, needles and a
salary.
   It is believed to be the nation's first full-scale,
government-sponsored effort to stop the spread of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome by offering drug users clean needles. A similar
program began in New York on an experimental basis in November but
has attracted only a handful of the city's estimated 250,000 addicts.
   Tacoma, a city of 160,000, has an estimated 3,000 intravenous
drug abusers.
   ``It might be a risk. It might save a life. That's what I want to
find out,'' said Pierce County Executive Joe Stortini, one of those
who voted for the program.
   City Council member Greg Mykland, who cast the lone no vote, said
the program sent a bad message and urged that the money be spent on
drug treatment instead.
   ``I do believe we're condoning the use of drugs by giving out
needles,'' Mykland said.
   He also was joined by downtown business operators and others in
questioning the effectiveness of the program.
   ``They will feed their habit when they need to or when they can
with the nearest needle available _ clean or dirty _ as they always
have,'' said Jim McDaniel, assistant director of the Tacoma Rescue
Mission.
   Supporters like Judy Giles of the Martin Luther King Center,
however, said the issue was saving lives.
   ``If it just saves the life of one rape victim, one child, one
baby, then we need to spend this money,'' she said.
   Health officials say 63 cases of AIDS have been reported since
1983 in the county, not counting people who might have been
diagnosed before moving to the Tacoma area.

   If the name Fonda helps an acting career like the
name Kennedy helps in politics, then Bridget Fonda should have an
easy time.
   But the 25-year-old actress said in the March issue of
Mademoiselle that she's had to battle everybody's expectations for
her to ``be somebody'' in able to ``be herself.''
   Bridget, daughter of Peter, niece of Jane and granddaughter of
Henry, says the ``only thing I can get from them is inspiration.''
   ``A person can't possibly know what's right until they've tried
it themselves. It's like these are your favorite shoes, but I wear a
different size, so big deal. I can't put them on,'' she said.
   In the movie ``Shag,'' Fonda played a teen-ager enjoying a wild
weekend with high school friends. This month, she's in London
shooting ``Scandal,'' which re-creates the scandalous Profumo affair
that brought down Britain's Conservative government in 1963.
   Her role includes some nude scenes. She hopes her future roles
won't.
   ``Now a lot of scripts I get have nudity in them because they
know I can be a bad girl,'' she said. ``I don't want that to happen.
So if the part has nudity in it from now on, I'm going to turn it
down. It's not that I'm anti-nudity, I just want to stop being
associated with it.''

   Jose Canseco, the American League's Most Valuable

1989 Jaguar was traveling 125 mph on a Florida highway.
   Canseco, 24, was stopped in his bright red car on Interstate 95
at about 1:25 a.m., cited for reckless driving and allowed to drive
away, police said. No court date has been set.
   ``He was very reasonable. He did not deny it or say he did it,''
Florida Highway Patrol spokesman Lt. Tim Betts said. ``He just
accepted his ticket.''
   The maximum penalty for reckless driving is imprisonment for 90
days and a $500 fine, Betts said.
   Canseco, the Oakland Athletics' rightfielder, was a unanimous
winner of the AL MVP after hitting 42 home runs and stealing 40
bases, the first 40-40 player in major league history. Last week he
received a $1.245 million raise, the largest in baseball history. He

charge is $200.
   ``She told me that she is unwilling to come here to prosecute him

   A grand jury declined to indict Padilla, 36, of El Paso, on

   Attorneys for the White House, State Department
and the Office of Government Ethics are studying investments held by
Secretary of State James A. Baker III to determine if any should be
sold to avoid a possible conflict of interest, administration
spokesmen said today.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman denied a Washington
Post report that White House counsel C. Boyden Gray has pressed
Baker to sell off stock in Chemical New York Corp., a bank holding
company that has $4.5 billion in loans to Third World nations.
   Redman also denied ``that there was some sort of resistance'' on
Baker's part to his investments being scrutinized.
   The statement came amid questions whether the holdings might pose
a potential conflict as the new secretary of state deals with the
Third World debt crisis.
   ``At this point they haven't reached a decision'' on disposing of
the investments, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told
reporters aboard Air Force One as President Bush flew to Ottawa,
Canada.
   Gray, Bush's top adviser on ethics, has been arguing that Baker
should sell the stock in Chemical New York Corp. to avoid the
appearance of conflict of interest, the Post quoted unnamed sources
as saying.
   At the State Department, Redman said Baker _ both as White House
chief of staff and Treasury Secretary _ had removed himself from
policy issues that might have specifically affected his holdings,
and had done so with the approval of the Office of Government Ethics.
   However, Redman added, a new review of Baker's holdings was
underway because of a 1987 Justice Department interpretation of the
ethics rules, which requires officials ``to be more conservative in
participating in broad policy discussions than previously believed
necessary by government ethics attorneys.''
   Redman said the secretary was seeking the advice as to ``whether
additional steps, such as a waiver under the statute or sale of
assets, might be advisable.''
   Baker will take ``appropriate action'' after getting such advice,
Redman said.
   Baker's latest disclosure form filed with Office of Government
Ethics lists some 5,310 shares of various types of stock held in the
Chemical New York Corp.
   It is listed on a form under assests of a dependent child. The
Bakers have a teen-age daughter, Mary Bonner Baker.
   On the form, some types of Chemical stock are listed as having
values ranging from $1,000 to $5,000, while others are listed as
being valued at $5,000 to $15,000. According to the list, the stocks
in total would be worth more than $12,004, but less than $40,000.
   The stock's dividends were reported to have ranged from $3,104 to
$8,500 in 1988.
   The form, filed last month, covers only January through August of
1988, since Baker left the government to head Bush's presidential
campaign.
   The Post said the secretary of state wants to hold his bank
stocks, arguing he can continue the practice he observed as Treasury
secretary for the last four years.
   Under that practice, Baker would remove himself from matters
particularly associated with Chemical and seek a ``presidential
waiver'' of normal conflict-of-interest regulations to allow him to
participate in broader matters that might affect the bank.
   The Post quoted officials involved in the dispute as saying
Gray's position that the stocks be sold is bolstered by a Justice
Department ruling last year.
   That decision said top administration officials whose personal
holdings would inevitably and predictably benefit from policies they
help establish cannot simply recuse themselves from involvement in
those policies. Instead, the department ruled, they must sell the
stock in question or get a formal waiver from a superior which, in
Baker's case, would be the president.
   Before last year, officials such as Baker could participate in
developing general policy even though they had personal holdings
that might be affected by the policy, the report stated.
   When Baker first joined former President Reagan's White House as
chief of staff in 1981, he put his bank stock and other holdings in
a ``qualified blind trust,'' an arrangement that left the assets in
the hands of a trustee. However, under the arrangement, Baker was
informed annually of his holdings. and knew throughout that he still
owned the bank shares.
   Originally, they were shares in Texas Commerce Bancshares, a
banking company that grew out of a bank organized by Baker's
grandfather, the Post said. In May 1987, Texas Commerce was merged
with a subsidiary of Chemical, and Baker became a large holder of
the New York bank company's stock, it said.

<HEAD>Gov't Foes in Talks on Political Reform</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Friday began work on
political reforms with two of its longest and bitterest foes _ men
it considered too extreme to take part when the broad-ranging talks
were proposed six months ago.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, meanwhile, was on the road
promoting agreement with the government to skeptical followers in
southern Poland.
   Several small labor disputes broke out, led by members of the
government-supported trade union alliance and opposed by the
unsanctioned but increasingly tolerated Solidarity movement.
   Adam Michnik and Jacek Kuron, opposition philosophers and
essayists who have been active in anti-government organizing since
1968, were prominent among the 36 people at the Council of Ministers
Palace to discuss political reforms.
   Michnik and Kuron were founding members of the Committee for
Defense of Workers in 1976. Michnik's collected essays, ``Letters
from Prison,'' have provided much of the philosophical underpinning
for the opposition movement.
   ``I am totally surprised that the talks did occur,'' Kuron said
later. ``They open great possibilities.''
   Kuron said he spoke about the problems of minority groups in
Poland, such as Ukranians, Lithuanians and Byelorussians, while
Michnik said he concentrated on changes occurring in other communist
nations and their meaning for Poland.
   Last year, the government vehemently opposed including Kuron and
Michnik in the proposed talks, calling them too extreme. But the
objections have been dropped in the wake of a Communist Party
decision last month to seek common ground with the opposition.
   The talks, known as the ``round table,'' began with a plenary
session Monday. Working groups have been meeting all week on
specific topics. The full negotiations are expected to last up to
six weeks.
   Solidarity spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz said the union seeks ``a
country that belongs to the whole nation and is not dominated by one
party.''
   At the meeting, he said, Solidarity proposed the following steps:
   _ Legalizing Solidarity;
   _ Removing political controls on the courts;
   _ Adopting a law to enable various groups to form, including
independent student organizations and groups representing national
minorities; and
   _ Making municipal governments democratically elected.
   The government said the first step should be constructing a new
parliament with representatives from the opposition, said Politburo
member Janusz Reykowski.
   Authorities have insisted that in exchange for legalizing
Solidarity, the union agree to a package of political and economic
reforms, help draft a law on elections, and take part in parliament
and other aspects of official life. The opposition has been hesitant
to endorse a political system that guarantees communist domination
and is wary of being co-opted.
   Solidarity's leader at the talks, historian Bronislaw Geremek,
said the session was difficult. ``Today was a show of differences.
... There is no mutual trust. There is a lack of, or even crisis of,
trust on both sides,'' he said.
   In Krakow, Walesa addressed 2,000 people at Jagiellonian
University to sell his vision of seeking a compromise with
authorities. Walesa invoked a slogan that rhymes in Polish:
``Agreement builds, disagreement ruins.''
   ``If you take the path of peaceful evolution, it will be a
revolution,'' he said. ``Let us give the round table a chance. Let
us not provoke, because then we will all have to pay.''
   Walesa also met with Krakow Cardinal Franciszek Macharski and
went to the city of Bielsko-Biala, site of Poland's small-car
factory, and addressed about 500 workers.
   Walesa has been urging workers not to strike during the talks
with the government, but followers of the official trade unions
staged several actions around the country Friday.
   An OPZZ strike over wages crippled bus service in Piotrkow
Trybunalski, a central provincial capital of 80,000 people. OPZZ
officials in Warsaw said it was a local grievance and they had no
immediate details.
   OPZZ unionists at a steel plant in Ostrowiec Swietokrzyski near
Kielce in southern Poland also went on strike, seeking wage
increases of about $59 a month, official media reported.
   Solidarity spokesman Robert Bogdanski said Solidarity activists
``distance themselves from the strike.''
   The OPZZ, faced with the threat of legal competition from
Solidarity, has grown increasingly militant in an apparent bid to
demonstrate its independence.
   Representatives have tried to argue that the OPZZ can do a better
job than Solidarity of protecting workers' interests because it does
not have to appear moderate to authorities in order to get legalized.

   The Justice Department today sought for a third
time to delay Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial, contending that
defense lawyers will hurt national security by spilling state
secrets onto the public record.
   The department asked a three-member panel of the U.S. Court of
Appeals to reconsider its refusal to delay the trial while it
studies the presiding judge's refusal to implement procedures the
government argues are needed to prevent surprise disclosures of
classified information.
   If the trial were allowed to start next week under the ground
rules set by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, the department
said, ``highly sensitive items of classified information will be
revealed by the defense in its opening statement, causing
irreperable damage to both the national security and foreign affairs
interests of the United States.''
   The Justice Department, at the request of intelligence agencies
including the National Security Agency, wants more stringent
controls on North's plans to introduce classified material in the
case.
   In a court filing Wednesday, the department criticized Gesell,
saying he had adopted procedures that ``fail'' to identify what
portions of the classified material North wants to present are
relevant and whether they are admissible.
   Gesell finished selecting a jury Thursday and rejected the
department's censorship bid, calling it ``wholly misplaced.'' He
told the jurors to report back Monday morning.
   Gesell said the department has no standing to interfere in the
trial at this point because independent counsel Lawrence Walsh is
handling the prosecution of North. Walsh wants to proceed with the
trial immediately and opposes the department's effort to halt the
case.
   A few hours later, the appeals court upheld Gesell's decision.
   Loye Miller, a Justice Department spokesman, said the appeals
judges on Thursday ``had before them a lot more'' material from
Walsh ``than they had from us.''
   Assistant Attorney General Edward S.G. Dennis, head of the
department's criminal division, claimed that ``the risk to national
security would be significant'' under the rules laid down by Gesell.
He said the government would lack control over ``disclosure of very
sensitive, classified information.''
   Gesell issued a ruling Jan. 19 permitting North to introduce
classified material if it tends to show that North's purpose was not
to violate the law, or that government witnesses are lying.
   He also said North may use classified information, where
relevant, about the Reagan administration's efforts to have other
countries aid the Nicaraguan Contra rebels after Congress had banned
U.S. military aid to them.
   The Justice Department is seeking a court order saying that North
may disclose no classified information to which the U.S. government
has any pending objection.
   North is charged with concealing from Congress and the attorney
general the administration's secret support for the Contras during
the period in which direct U.S. aid was banned.
   He also is accused of illegally accepting installation of a
security system at his home, converting to his own use at least
$4,300 in traveler's checks from a Contra leader and conspiring to
use a tax-exempt foundation illegally to raise money for the rebels.

   New York state's high court today denied an
appeal by anti-abortion activists seeking to prevent a Long Island
man from having an abortion performed on his comatose wife.
   Even before today's decision by the New York Court of Appeals, a
lawyer for the activists had said he would turn to the federal
courts if the state court rejected the appeal.
   The seven judges of the Court of Appeals, without comment,
refused to hear the appeal of a lower court's ruling that appointed
Martin Klein as guardian of his 32-year-old pregnant wife, Nancy.
   Klein has said he wants the abortion in the hopes that it will
save the life of his wife. The anti-abortion activists have sought
to be appointed guardians themselves of Mrs. Klein, saying her
emotional health is at stake.
   ``I'm begging the American people to please help us,'' Martin
Klein said Thursday after he was rebuffed a second time in his
battle to be appointed the guardian of his wife.
   ``We're torn up,'' he said. ``These strangers have come off the
street and are intruding in our lives. We don't know what to do
about it.''
   Late Thursday, a state appeals court upheld a lower court ruling
that made Klein, an accountant from Upper Brookville, his wife's
guardian. But two members of the anti-abortion group immediately
appealed to the state's highest court, which placed a stay on the
decision.
   ``It's just something you can't set aside,'' said John Short,
founder of the Long Island Right-to-Life group. ``Our concern is of
the psychological and emotional state of Nancy Klein if she wakes
up.''
   ``Under our plan, we say the baby's down at the neonatal clinic
getting the best care possible. Under their plan, they've got to
tell her they've killed her baby. Emotionally, that would kill her.''
   In its ruling, the five-member appeals court panel had dismissed
requests by Short and John Broderick to be appointed guardians of
Mrs. Klein and her fetus.
   The panel found that ``ultimately the record confirms that these
absolute strangers to the Klein family, whatever their motivation,
have no place in the midst of this family tragedy.''
   But at about 8:30 p.m., 30 minutes after the appeals court
ruling, Short and Broderick obtained the temporary stay from the
Court of Appeals in Albany, New York state's highest court. No
hearing was immediately scheduled.
   Mrs. Klein, who is approximately 17 weeks pregnant, has been in a
coma at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset on Long Island
since a Dec. 13 car accident.
   She is severely brain-damaged and given a slight chance at
recovery. Klein sought an abortion for his wife after he said some
physicians advised him that an abortion may enhance her recovery and
could save her life.
   ``All we want to do is save Nancy's life,' he said Thursday
night. ``Time is precious. Any delay in terminating the pregnancy is
only increasing the risks to Nancy. These people's actions
constitute severe harassment and interference with Nancy's rights
and my wishes and Nancy's parents wishes.''
   The appellate court that ruled in Klein's favor found that ``the
case law in this state firmly establishes that strangers will not be
appointed legal guardians of the incompetent unless it is impossible
to find within the family circle one who is qualified to serve.''
   The decision further stated that the anti-abortion activists have
``not made a sufficient showing of an adverse interest between Mr.
Klein and his comatose wife.''
   Klein was awarded guardianship on Tuesday from Judge Bernard
McCaffrey, but Short and Broderick won a stay of the ruling pending
the appeals court decision.
   In his decision, McCaffrey said that the issue in the case was
not what moral or medical determination Klein should exercise if
appointed guardian but Nancy Klein's constitutional right to an
abortion.

<HEAD>Report: Boy's Body Found; Church Leader Denounces Mandela Youth Group</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said Friday they were
investigating a report that someone had found the body of a boy
allegedly abducted by teen-agers who have acted as bodyguards for
Winnie Mandela.
   An anti-apartheid leader who heads South Africa's Methodist
Church joined a growing number of blacks who have denounced the
teen-agers as lawless and accused them of kidnapping and beating
other youngsters.
   The fate of the missing 14-year-old, Stompie Sepei, has been at
the center of the controversy surrounding Mrs. Mandela, wife of
jailed African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela.
   The Weekly Mail, a prominent anti-apartheid newspaper, quoted an
unidentified Soweto activist as saying the boy's body was dug up
Thursday in Soweto. No additional details were given.
   Police headquarters said Friday it had not confirmed the report.
   The youths associated with Mrs. Mandela call themselves the
Mandela United soccer team. They have served as her bodyguards and
some live at her home in Soweto, the huge black township outside
Johannesburg.
   The Rev. Stanley Mogoba, national president of the Methodist
Church, Friday said Mandela United members had abducted four youths
who were living at a local Methodist church. One of the four,
Stompie, has been missing since Jan. 1.
   The other youths, Mogoba said, ``were severely assaulted and held
... in defiance of the unanimous will of community leadership in
Soweto.''
   He said they were held from Dec. 29 to Jan. 16.
   Bishop Peter Storey, regional leader of the Methodist Church,
said if Stompie's body had been found, ``the worst fears of the
church and community have been realized.''
   Some of Mrs. Mandela's supporters have contended that the four
youths were taken from the church to the Mandela home because they
had been sexually molested by a white minister, the Rev. Paul
Verryn. Methodist officials say they investigated the claim and
found it was false.
   Mogoba, once imprisoned for his anti-apartheid activities, said
church leaders ``noted with anger and concern the vigilante
actions'' of Mandela United.
   The allegations against Verryn were a ``a transparent attempt to
divert the attention of both church and community away from the
ruthless actions of the `football team' and the disappearence and
possible death of Stompie,'' he said.
   Mogoba said the situation resulted from a ``vacuum in leadership
in the townships through the detention of authentic leaders under
the state of emergency,'' imposed in June 1986 in response to
growing unrest over apartheid, the system of racial separation that
discriminates against blacks.
   An estimated 30,000 people, including many leading activists,
have been detained without charges during the state of emergency.
   About 150 Soweto community leaders met last month to investigate
abductions allegedly carried out by the youth group and the ANC
later asked Mrs. Mandela to disband Mandela United.
   Black leaders say the group hurts the campaign to end white
minority rule in South Africa.
   Several newspapers have reported that continuing allegations that
the teen-agers engaged in unlawful behavior have become a source of
friction between Mrs. Mandela and her husband, South Africa's
best-known black leader.
   She says she has disbanded the group.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said Thursday that police
were investigating the alleged abductions, Stompie's disappearance
and the charges of sexual abuse.
   Mrs. Mandela, widely regarded abroad as an anti-apartheid
heroine, has been entangled in several controversies in recent years.
   She was criticized for authorizing construction of a palatial
Soweto home she never moved into, and for endorsing ``necklacings,''
in which burning tires were used to execute suspected collaborators.
   Last year, high school students angered by actions of Mandela
United members set her home afire.

   A 1,582-page paperback Bible with the skyline of
Manhattan on an orange cover is going on sale in Britain aimed at
people who may not know what it's all about.
   ``Discover the world's greatest book,'' says a headline above the
main title, ``The Bible.''
   ``We used a color photo of Manhattan as a symbol for a book that
is both contemporary and timeless,'' said Julia Young, religious
books publicist at publishers Hodder and Stoughton.
   ``The wording markets the Bible on its own merits, without
appealing to the reader's religious commitment,'' Mrs. Young said.
   Inside, the text runs right across the page instead of in the
usual double column found in Bibles.
   ``This makes for ease of reading, and shows the many poetic
passages to best advantage,'' the publishers say.
   There's a 42-page introduction to the Old and New Testaments and
a reading plan for getting through the 810,000 words in one year,
from Genesis to Revelations.
   Also included is a history of Israel, an account of the Jewish
religion and a few lines about each of the 66 books of the Bible.
   A page headed ``Well-known events in the Bible,'' starts with the
Creation, runs through Plagues on Egypt, Daniel in the lions' den
and ends with Paul's shipwreck.
   ``The greatest story ever told is now being marketed as just
that: a sort of gigantic thriller,'' reported London's Evening
Standard newspaper. ``They've even dropped the `Holy' from the title
to leave it short and punchy in 2-inch embossed silver letters.''
   ``We don't mind them saying that because we want to attract the
general reader rather than the Christian community who know the
Bible,'' Mrs. Young said.
   The publishers have ordered a first print run of 100,000 copies,
said Dick Douglas, editorial manager of the company's Bible division.
   The book retails for about $8.60, and will be sold at train
stations and airports, as well as major bookstores.
   Asked if he thought sales would go over 100,000, Douglas said:
``Oh good heavens, yes, I should jolly well hope so.''
   The publishers hired front-rank advertising agents Saatchi and
Saatchi to take care of the national press campaign and posters,
showing the book compared to Moses' tablets of stone and the slogan,
``Easier to digest than tablets.''
   Martin Lee, who buys religious books for the W.H. Smith chain of
410 bookstores and newsstands, said: ``We think it's a great step
forward in Bible publishing to make it more accessible to everyday
man. It really does look like a mass market novel.''
   The text of the paperback is the Anglicized New International
Version, a complete edition of the Bible produced in the United
States in 1978 by the International Bible Society and first
published in Britain in 1979.
   ``It is now the world's best-selling Bible in modern English and
the outright best-seller in many countries,'' Mrs. Young said.
   ``It's bang up to date, but it has a kind of literary quality
which sets it apart. It preserves echoes from the King James
Version, which is so central to English culture,'' she said.

   Siskel and Ebert have nothing on students at two
Queens high schools who were treated this week to an advance
screening of the movie ``Tap'' _ followed by a talk with its star,
Gregory Hines.
   Hines told 200 students on Tuesday that they can learn some
things from his ``Tap'' character, Max Washington, who must decide
between his career as a dancer or his career as a criminal.
   ``Max confronts many of these same issues'' facing the students
in the near future, said Hines, whose previous films include ``White
Knights'' with Mikhail Baryshnikov and ``Running Scared'' with Billy
Crystal.
   ``It's good to start (a career) now,'' Hines told the students.
``In 10 years, you'll have some craft behind you. If you want it,
you have to be aggressive and make it happen for yourself.''
   Hines also offered the students a warning: If you want to follow
in his footsteps as a performer, be ready to make some sacrifices
and hard choices along the way.
   ``I think it's a risk anytime someone wants to be an artist in
our culture,'' said Hines. ``To be an artist here is to be outside
the mainstream.''

<HEAD>Vatican Denounces All Forms of Racism, Attacks Apartheid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vatican said Friday racism is a ``wound
in humanity's side,'' citing apartheid in South Africa,
anti-Semitism and the treatment of peasants and native peoples as
slaves.
   Apartheid received the harshest criticism. In a major document,
the Vatican said it was ``the most marked and systematic form'' of
racism and economic sanctions against South Africa could be
justified.
   The document, ``The Church and Racism: Towards A More Fraternal
Society'' stressed, however, that one country should not be singled
out because ``It would be hypocritical to point a finger at only one
country: rejection based on race exists on every continent.''
   It also criticized discrimination against religious minorities in
countries governed by Islamic law and warned of ``apprentice
sorcerers'' exploiting modern science in an effort to produce human
beings selected by race.
   Although the United States is one of the world's most interracial
societies, it said, ``much still needs to be done'' to eliminate
prejudice there.
   Pope John Paul II had the Vatican's Justice and Peace Commission
prepare the document to help ``enlighten and awaken consciences.''
Naming countries in the document was a departure from usual practice.
   The commission said it was not trying to ``gloss over the
weaknesses and even, at times, the complicity'' of the Roman
Catholic Church in racism throughout history, and declared that the
church ``wants first and foremost to change racist attitudes,
including those within her own communities.''
   Racism is a sin that blasphemes God, it said, and the church
encourages legislation, administrative measures and ``even
appropriate external pressure'' against it.
   It can be eliminated only by going ``to its roots, where it is
formed: in the human heart,'' the commission wrote. ``Racism still
exists and continually reappears in different forms. ... It is a
wound in humanity's side that mysteriously remains open.''
   South Africa's apartheid policy of discrimination is
``institutional racism,'' the document said. ``It is justified by an
ideology of the superiority of persons from European stock over
those of African or Indian origin or `colored,' which is, by some,
supported by an erroneous interpretation of the Bible.
   ``Today apartheid is the most marked and systematic form'' of
racism and ``change is absolutely necessary and urgent.''
   ``Although some steps toward change have been taken in recent
years, the black majority ... remains excluded from effective
representation in national government and enjoys citizenship in word
only,'' it continued.
   Cardinal Roger Etchegaray of France, head of the commisssion that
prepared the document, said it reflects his observations during a
two-week tour of South Africa last year.
   At a news conference, he described apartheid as ``monstrous'' and
added that, while South Africa had made some reforms since 1978,
``apartheid maintains untouched in its foundations.''
   He cited laws that register people by race at birth, establish
separate living areas for different races and reserve most of the
land for whites.
   Etchegaray said the Vatican supports the South African bishops,
who have said economic sanctions can be ``morally justified'' but
should be applied only on condition they do not destroy the
country's economy and cause further suffering.
   The document called anti-Semitism ``the most tragic form that
racist ideology has assumed in our century,'' referring to the Nazi
extermination of 6 million Jews.
   ``Certain organizations, with branches in many countries, keep
alive the anti-Semite racist myth, with the support of networks of
publications,'' it said.
   It cited terrorist attacks against Jewish people and symbols, and
said anti-Zionism ``serves at times as a screen for anti-Semitism,
feeding on it and leading to it.''
   Discrimination against aboriginal people and immigrants, and
exploitation of poor peasants by powerful landowners, ``are new
forms of slavery which are frequent in the Third World,'' the
document said.
   The report said the world should not forget other mass
exterminations, such as those of Armenians after World War I and
Cambodians in the 1970s, and urged the revision of history texts
that ``falsify history, pass over the historical misdeeds of racism
in silence or justify the principles behind it.''

<HEAD>In Her First Official Visit Abroad, Bhutto Comes to China</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   When Benazir Bhutto arrives here Saturday, she
will be following in the footsteps of her father and other Pakistani
leaders who for decades cultivated close ties with China, despite
major differences between the nations.
   Ms. Bhutto's four-day trip to China _ her first abroad since
becoming prime minister _ is a sign both of Beijing's importance to
Islamabad and to the new prime minister herself.
   For China, the visit comes at a time of great change in its
relations with the rest of Asia. Improving ties with India and the
Soviet Union no longer make Pakistan a natural ally. But other
factors, such as a shrinking arms market highlighting Pakistan's
importance as a buyer, guarantee a good relationship for some time
to come.
   ``In other countries you are witnessing the first visits to China
in 30 years,'' said Pakistan's ambassador, M. Akram Zaki, referring
to the recent visit to China by Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
and the planned summit in May with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev. ``With us, we have been friends throughout.''
   Indeed, despite momentous political changes _ coups and wars in
Pakistan, the Cultural Revolution in China _ the relationship
between the two countries has improved steadily since 1950, when
Islamabad first recognized Beijing.
   Ms. Bhutto has been in office just over two months, becoming
prime minister in December after Pakistani leader Mohammed Zia
ul-Haq died in a plane crash.
   She will meet with all of China's top leaders and is expected to
sign two agreements of limited importance: a barter trade agreement
and an agreement on the mutual protection of investment.
   The nations exchanged their first prime ministerial visit in
1956, but the relationship began to pick up quickly after China's
border war with India in 1962.
   Military cooperation, which remains the most critical element in
the relationship, began in 1965, during Pakistan's battles with
India.
   China began selling Pakistan arms. Today 50 percent of Pakistan's
400-plane air force comes from China, as do 1,100 of its 1,600
tanks, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute. Only the United States sells more weapons to Pakistan.
   China also helps Pakistan with its nuclear industry, having
signed an agreement in September 1986.
   Although the agreement said cooperation would be limited to
peaceful uses, there have been persistent reports China is helping
Pakistan build an atomic bomb.
   Both China and Pakistan have denied this, but Western diplomats
say they are convinced cooperation in this field is not limited to
electricity.
   Trade has been a disappointing part of the relationship. In 1987,
total trade hit $360 million, with a large surplus in China's favor.
   Relations with China went from good to very good during the
administration of Ms. Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who
visited China three times when he was president and prime minister
from 1971 to 1976.
   The relationship improved under Zia, who ousted the elder Bhutto
in a coup. Significantly, though, Beijing is said to have been quick
to support Ms. Bhutto once it appeared she enough votes to form a
government.
   China's ambassador to Pakistan met her three times within three
days of the election.

   Four weeks after former Prime Minister
Paul Vanden Boeynants vanished near his home, leaving behind a shoe,
pipe and hearing aid, police still don't know whether he is dead or
being held for ransom.
   About 100 officers are working on the case, but police stopped
holding daily press briefings for lack of information. ``We are
increasingly worried as time goes by,'' deputy prosecutor Andre
Vandoren said.
   Members of the 69-year-old politician's family have made two
television appeals for his return.
   In the second, Jan. 31, his son, Christian, said tearfully he was
willing to negotiate with the kidnappers at their convenience. His
plea for a sign that his father was alive went unanswered.
   Investigators said two weeks ago they were sure Vanden Boeynants
was abducted by the Socialist Revolutionary Brigade. The previously
unknown group claimed responsibility hours after he disappeared Jan.
14 and sent his identity card and a letter in his handwriting to a
Brussels newspaper.
   The alleged kidnappers have been silent since, however, and
police now wonder whether the group is ideological or merely a front
used by ordinary kidnappers to mislead them.
   As a result, authorities don't know whether they are dealing with
Belgium's first major political kidnapping or with its first
political killing in 39 years.
   Assailants who were never caught shot a communist leader dead in
1950 after he shouted ``Long live the republic!'' during King
Baudouin's coronation.
   Vanden Boeynants, a right-wing Christian Democrat, was a major
factor in postwar Belgian politics before a conviction for business
tax fraud ended his political career in 1986.
   Prime Minister Wilfried Martens said the former premier received
threats in the weeks before he disappeared, but Martens did not
reveal their nature. Vanden Boeynants also had requested a meeting
with the interior minister, presumably to discuss his personal
safety.
   After he vanished, the alleged kidnappers made conflicting
statements, first saying Vanden Boeynants would be returned ``in
little pieces,'' then claiming he would face a ``people's tribunal''
and finally saying he would ``appear free before the people'' if
ransom was paid.
   The handwritten letter about his ordeal sent to the newspaper
Jan. 24 demonstrated that Vanden Boeynants was alive after he
disappeared, but how long remains a question.
   A ransom note from the Socialist Revolutionary Brigade demanded
30 million francs (about $790,000), two-thirds to be given to the
poor through relief agencies chosen in polls of their readers by two
newspapers. It said the money must come from the victim's political
and business allies.
   Neither paper took a poll of its readers because no further word
ws received from the alleged abductors.
   Vanden Boeynants was prime minister from 1966 to 1968 and briefly
in 1978. He was a skilled backstage negotiator during 40 years in
politics and had a hand in most major government decisions.
   He also made a fortune in the meat-packing industry and got into
trouble over taxes. The judge who gave him a three-year suspended
sentence in 1986 called the former prime minister an ``inveterate
swindler'' for whom ``tax evasion is second nature.''

   Ronald H. Brown, the new chairman of the
Democratic Party, ``doesn't have to wear a name tag at a party
meeting or in black politics'' said a liberal activist involved in
bringing Brown into the Jesse Jackson campaign.
   The ability to move smoothly between often contrasting worlds has
characterized Brown since his childhood when he was the black
student from Harlem at predominantly white schools on Manhattan's
Upper East Side.
   It came to the fore last May, when the establishment lawyer whose
clients included the Japanese electronics industry and the
government of Haiti stepped into a key role in Jackson's
anti-establishment presidential campaign.
   Ann Lewis, who was a top Jackson adviser, recalled that Brown had
turned down Jackson's request to be his campaign manager.
   After the bitter New York presidential primary in April 1988 _ a
contest during which New York Mayor Ed Koch had said any Jew ``would
have to be crazy'' to vote for Jackson _ the former civil rights
leader sought again to bring Brown into his campaign, this time to
be his convention manager.
   Lewis said a meeting of Jackson campaign officials was held in
her Georgetown office. Brown chaired the session and everyone
accepted his leadership role.
   ``If you did it with Lego blocks, you'd come up with someone with
Ron's qualities,'' she said when asked what characteristics the
campaign was seeking. ``Ron doesn't have to wear a name tag at a
party meeting or in black politics, and it was his ability to move
credibly in both worlds that worked so well.''
   Most Democrats cheered when Brown agreed to be Jackson's man in
the negotiations leading up to the Atlanta convention that would
nominate Michael Dukakis for president.
   ``There was a rather tense atmosphere going into the
convention,'' recalled Paul Brountas, chairman of the Dukakis
campaign. ``The Reverend Jackson had started a bus caravan in
Chicago which picked up speed and people on the way to the
convention. This was after several weeks where Reverend Jackson was
hitting Dukakis pretty hard, building an expectation that Jackson
deserved more than he had received.''
   ``None of that created an environment which assured any kind of
unity,'' Brountas said.
   Brown and Brountas met privately on the Saturday before the
convention and the Jackson aide showed up with a list of his
concerns.
   By the time their meeting ended, Brountas said, ``I understood
where he was coming from and I was able to respond to most of them
and give an indication where I was coming from.''
   There would be more meetings including one that included Dukakis
and Jackson. The result was a convention that ended on a note of
harmony.
   From his childhood, Brown has bridged two very different worlds.
He grew up in Harlem, but his parents sent him to predominantly
white private schools in the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
   He attended Middlebury College in Vermont where he was one of
only a handful of black students. When he joined Sigma Phi Epsilon
fraternity, the house was stripped of its national membership for
violating the whites-only charter.
   At St. John's University Law School, one of his professors was
Mario Cuomo.
   Brown ran the Washington office of the Urban League before
joining Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and becoming a senior aide on his
presidential campaign. Later, he became general counsel of the
Senate Judiciary Committee which Kennedy chaired.
   ``He's nobody's man but his own,'' said Kennedy. ``Ron could say
no to me or to Jesse Jackson or to anyone else if he believed that
whatever was requested wasn't in the interests of the party.''
   Big time, big money law beckoned and Brown now is a partner in
one of the capital's biggest, most politically active firms.
   During that period he also served as deputy chairman of the
Democratic National Committee.
   Former party chairman John C. White recalled Brown and Paul Kirk
from earlier days at the DNC.
   ``They were around the office all the time, mostly with a press
release demanding my resignation,'' laughed White.
   A sandy-haired Texan, White was Jimmy Carter's hand-picked choice
to head the party.
   Brown and Kirk were aides to Kennedy, who was opposing the
incumbent president's bid for renomination.
   This was down-and-dirty, no-holds-barred politics. ``I'll whip
his ass,'' the president of the United States had said of the
Massachusetts senator who bore one of the most famous names in
American politics.
   But White was an old pro and Brown and Kirk were budding young
pros.
   ``Hell, they were so nice about it, I just got so I would invite
them in for a cup of coffee,'' recalled White. ``We just got to
where we liked each other. I knew what they were doing and they knew
what I was doing.''
   Six years later, Kirk became Democratic Party chairman and on
Friday, the 47-year-old Brown succeeded him in that post.

   A council meeting of Afghan guerrilla
leaders was postponed Friday after rival factions split over the
formation of an interim government for their nation and
Iranian-based guerrillas walked out.
   Guerrilla officials said the meeting was postponed indefinitely
because rival groups were deadlocked on issues including who should
head a provisional government to replace Afghanistan's communist
regime.
   Representatives of eight Afghan Shiite guerrilla groups based in
Iran refused to attend after the seven guerrilla groups based in
Pakistan reneged on an agreement to give the Shiites 100 seats on
the council.
   The larger, more powerful Pakistani-based groups from the rival
Sunni Moslem sect said the Shiite demand was excessive, but that
they hoped to reach an agreement to include the Iranian parties.
   ``Nobody knows what is happening. The leaders cannot decide on
who will lead the government and there is much disagreement,'' said
a senior guerrilla official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Delegates, who included military commanders, political leaders
and academics, adjourned after electing two leaders of the
Pakistani-based groups to head the council.
   Nabi Mohammadi was elected chairman and Rasul Saiaf was appointed
secretary.
   The council meeting was called to form a provisional government
and clear the way for elections in Afghanistan now that the
insurgents, who have been fighting their nation's communist regime
for 10 years, appear close to victory.
   The communist government is not expected to survive for long once
Soviet forces complete their withdrawal, expected by Wednesday.
   But the Pakistani-based guerrilla groups are deeply divided and
are scrambling for power. Some Afghan leaders fear that without a
broad-based government there could be a bloody power struggle
between the groups, which often have clashed.
   About 350 delegates showed up Friday for the heavily guarded
meeting; 526 had been expected.
   ``God is great!'' the delegates chanted when journalists were
allowed inside the hall briefly.
   Mohammad Karim Khalili, chairman of the guerrilla alliance in
Iran, said the Pakistani-based groups proposed renewed talks with
the Shiites and hinted they would give them 60 council seats.
   But Khalili said his alliance would accept nothing but the
initial offer of 100 seats.
   ``We don't want any new discussions. We want to realize our
agreement,'' he told The Associated Press.
   One guerrilla official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the council meeting had been postponed indefinitely and ``will not
be complete without representation from Afghans living in Iran.''
   Delegates had been instructed to remain in Islamabad, and some
guerrilla officials said the council might reconvene by Monday.
   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, acting chairman of the alliance of
Pakistan-based guerrillas, worked out the agreement earlier this
month to give the Iranian-based guerrillas 100 council seats. The
agreement was intended to get the Shiites take part in the council.
   But leaders of other Pakistani-based groups rejected Mojaddidi's
deal, either because of religious opposition to Shiites or because
of the view that 100 seats was excessive.
   The Pakistani parties each got 60 council seats.
   The Shiite groups are much smaller than the seven Sunni guerrilla
parties. Khalili said about 30 percent of Afghans are Shiites, but
most pre-war estimates put the figure at about 15 percent.
   Afghan leaders denied reports in Pakistan that Mojaddidi had been
removed as chairman of the Sunni alliance for making a deal with the
Iranian-based guerrillas. Leaders of the groups in Pakistan take
turns serving as chairman of their alliance.
   Afghan communists seized power in a bloody 1978 coup. Soviet
forces entered Afghanistan in 1979 to prop up the regime against the
guerrillas, and stayed for nine years.

   For one day, Georgia Tech President John Patrick
Crecine experienced life as a student. And it wasn't all a big party.
   For one thing, he couldn't find a parking spot and was late for
his first class.
   Crecine and junior David Ritchie traded places Thursday, an idea
of Tech's Student Foundation, which raised money by raffling off the
president's job for a day.
   When the president and the student exchanged car keys _ Crecine
inherited a 1981 Cutlass Supreme, while Ritchie drove off with the
president's new Chrysler New Yorker _ Ritchie offered tips on
parking spots.
   But Crecine still had trouble, showing up 15 minutes late for his
8 a.m. calculus class.
   ``This is embarrassing,'' he said, interrupting class. ``About
the best I can hope for is that there will be no pop quizzes.''
   Ritchie abolished parking fees for the day and thought about
canceling classes, but realized it would let Crecine off the hook.
His day was full: a speech to officials of the Ford Motor Co., a
briefing on plans to restructure the school's academic departments,
and a meeting about the need for more library funding.
   Crecine did enjoy his leisure time.
   ``The notion of having some time where you get to concentrate on
something longer than five minutes is refreshing,'' he said.

   Or is it Ferrisburgh?
   That's the question that seems to have troubled the town since
the original charter of 1762, when both spellings, with and without
the ``h'' appeared on different parts of the now yellow document.
   The most visible sign of the debate today is that the U.S. Post
Office for Ferrisburg stands right next door to the Town Clerk's
Office for Ferrisburgh.
   Town Clerk Paul Hoffman, who favors the Ferrisburgh spelling,
says he believes initially there was an ``h'' at the end of the word
because the town originated from a land grant.
   Webster's New World Dictionary defines ``burg'' as a fortified or
walled town, ``burgh'' as a chartered town, Hoffman explained. The
town is about 20 miles south of Burlington.
   The Ferrisburgh Historical Society officially re-adopted the
``h'' more than a decade ago, but the word never reached the state
or federal governments. The Post Office still spells it Ferrisburg,
as does the 1988 Vermont Year Book, which lists the town's
population at 2,117.
   At the Little Otter Creek General Store, even families disagree.
Owner Donald Myers said he has always added the ``h.''
   His wife, Margie Myers, does not. ``To be perfectly honest, I
didn't know it was spelled with an `h,''' she said.

   When it came down to a choice of Atlantic
Coast Conference basketball or President George Bush, Republican
Gov. Jim Martin decided the president could wait.
   The governor chose to attend the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill vs. North Carolina State University basketball game,
which was held at the same time as the president's address Thursday
to a joint session of Congress.
   ``I'll watch it later,'' he said, adding he would record the
speech. ``My son, Ben, wants to go (to the game), so I can
rationalize it that way.''
   The governor said he would remain neutral at the game, which was
won by N.C. State, 98-88.
   ``I'm supporting both (UNC) Coach (Dean) Smith and (N.C. State)
Coach (Jim) Valvano _ and that's in alphabetical order,'' he said.

   Gov. Thomas H. Kean, a two-term governor and
former classroom teacher who has championed educational causes, was
named Friday as the president of Drew University.
   Kean, who is barred by state law from seeking a third consecutive
term, will assume the post when he leaves public office in January.
   ``Governor Kean's first career was in education and we're
delighted he is returning to the academic world by coming to Drew,''
said Nancy S. Schaenen, chairwoman of the 123-year-old university's
board of trustees. The board unanimously elected him.
   Kean met with the student body shortly after the announcement. He
said he hoped to raise the visibility of the school, which has 2,200
students.
   ``What I'm looking forward to now is learning from you,'' he told
the students at the school's Baldwin Gymnasium. ``To the best of my
ability, I'm going to spend time with the student body because I
want you to teach me.''
   ``With his background in politics, he's going to be able to do
some things for Drew that others can't do,'' said Tammy Ahrens, a
21-year-old junior political science major. ``His charismatic
leadership will help put us on the map.''
   Kean, 53, an Episcopalian, will become the first non-Methodist to
hold the top job at the private university, which opened in 1866 as
a Methodist seminary. He will be Drew's 10th president.
   Kean, who gave the keynote address at the Republican National
Convention last August, taught American history and English at St.
Mark's, the preparatory school he attended as a student in
Massachusetts. He also taught history and political science at
Rutgers University.
   But Kean's record on education has not been without controversy.
   The governor's aid package to school districts this year dwindled
along with tax revenues. He also recommended no overall increase in
aid for the state's colleges and universities, and cut $60,000 from
the aid package for Drew University itself. The aid to the school
last year was $985,000.

   Communist Laos has signed an agreement
for a joint venture in hotels and tourism with a U.S. businessman,
according to a Laotian news agency.
   The report described the deal as the first cooperation between
the Laotian Trade Ministry and an American businessman in 10 years.
   The Laotian news agency KPL said the agreement involves
restoration of hotels and promotion of tourism in Champassak,
Savannakhet and Vientiane, the capital of Laos. Golf courses are to
be put down in some provinces, KPL said.
   Somphavan Inthavong, deputy minister of trade and foreign
economic relations, signed the agreement with Donald W. Scott of
Brunswick, Maine, and Boun-Om Lattanavong, a Laotian living in the
United States, the agency said in a report received Friday in
Bangkok.
   In the past two years, Laos has followed many communist countries
in seeking Western investment.
   Scott's wife, Marilyn, said in Maine that her husband is an
independent businessman who specializes in real estate.
   This is his first business venture in Southeast Asia, but he has
traveled there many times in the past five years as a result of his
involvement in refugee resettlement efforts, she said. Mrs. Scott
had no other details on the venture.
   She said she and Scott, 49, became involved in refugee work,
mainly in camps in Bangkok, through their work in the U.S. medical
relief program Project Concern in Vietnam in the late 1960s. Mrs.
Scott said her husband played a key role in the 1986 resettlement of
a group of more than 200 of the Montagnard people from Vietnam, most
of whom settled in Greensboro, N.C.

   Emperor Akihito opened a new session of Japan's
parliament on Friday in his first appearance before the body since
ascending to the throne last month.
   The parliament, or Diet, began a new session with legislators
gearing up for stormy sessions over a widespread stock scandal.
   The 55-year-old monarch, clad in a morning suit, said Japan is
expected to promote world peace and prosperity and to act as a
nation that cherishes both culture and nature.
   ``I sincerely hope the Diet will fully perform its mission as the
highest organ of state power,'' Akihito said in his brief speech.
His father, Emperor Hirohito, died of cancer on Jan. 7.
   Later Friday, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and other top
officials of the majority Liberal Democratic Party addressed
Parliament.
   Takeshita reiterated earlier pledges for political reform to
``restore the people's trust in politics.''
   ``All of us who have positions of responsibility in politics are
being called upon to take the initiative in exercising restraint ...
and in ensuring that our positions are upright,'' Takeshita said as
members of the political opposition jeered.
   Opposition parties are widely expected to disrupt next week's
parliamentary proceedings with demands that Takeshita or other top
leaders resign to take responsibility for the scandal.
   About 150 influential politicians, bureaucrats and executives
have been implicated in the scandal arising from purchase of shares
in Recruit-Cosmos Co., a real estate subsidiary of the employment
information conglomerate Recruit Co.
   The scandal has produced more than 20 resignations, including
those of three Cabinet members of the governing party and three
opposition members.
   The shares were legally purchased before public listing and then
later sold publicly at a large profit. However, critics say the
purchasers were still morally wrong and subject to influence as a
result of the transactions.
   Opposition boycotts over the scandal could delay passage of the
most important item on Parliament's agenda, a proposed national
budget of about $48 billion.
   The Parliament adjourned until Monday, and its regular session is
expected to last until May 28.

<HEAD>Unions Blast Proposed Bush Order on Security Clearances</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union officials representing federal, defense
and nuclear workers vowed Friday to try to block a proposed
presidential order that would eliminate protections accorded their
members during security investigations for the past 29 years.
   They promised to go to court or Congress if necessary to stop the
plan now under consideration by the Bush administration.
   Among other provisions in the 21-page draft order, applicants for
positions in the federal government and defense plants could be
denied a security clearance _ and even a job _ without explanation
or right of appeal.
   A copy of the draft now being circulated to 30 federal agencies
for comment was obtained by The Associated Press.
   ``I think it's really an outrageous action,'' said Bob Tobias,
president of the National Treasury Employees Union. He said his
union would ask congressional appropriations committees to bar any
spending to implement the order if it is signed by President Bush.
   John N. Sturdivant, president of the American Federation of
Government Employees, which represents 700,000 federal workers,
called the proposal ``unreasonable and unfair.'' He said his union,
the largest one for federal workers, ``would be reviewing the draft
to determine whether court action to block it is possible.''
   ``This union would be appalled at such an action,'' said Pat
Ziska, spokesman for the Machinists union, which has 200,000 members
who work for military contractors, mostly aerospace companies.
``It's very frightening, a real threat and shock to us.''
   Nolan Hancock, legislative director of the Oil, Chemical and
Atomic Workers union, said, ``This is a far-reaching order and it's
not in the best interests of our workers or of national security if
somebody could arbitrarily revoke clearances.''
   The proposed order also has stirred opposition at the Senate
intelligence committee and elsewhere on Capitol Hill and among
interest groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union.
   Job applicants denied clearance and workers with low-level
clearances who are denied access to more secret information would be
stripped of their existing procedural rights to challenge damaging
information. Workers whose clearances were being revoked would see
their appeal rights curtailed under the proposed order.
   The order would establish the first governmentwide standards for
background investigations _ a goal long sought by both executive
branch and congressional study groups.
   It would require more thorough investigations than are done now
for initial clearances and would require a new investigation every
five years for those with top-secret clearance and at least every 10
years for those with secret clearance. Some recently apprehended
spies have not been reinvestigated for many years _ sometimes as a
result of lack of manpower.
   The order would authorize security officers to determine whether
a worker or applicant ``has exploitable vulnerabilities or has
engaged in any exploitable conduct or indiscreet behavior''
including ``criminal or dishonest activity, alcohol or substance
abuse, or exploitable sexual conduct.''
   Security agents also are to determine whether the individual
``has a history of mental, emotional and financial stability,'' the
order said.
   ``An employee could be denied a security clearance or an upgraded
clearance because of an administrative error or simply because of
personal dislike,'' AFGE's Sturdivant said. ``What harm would be
caused by giving these employees the reasons for a denial? It's
certainly not a question of national security.''
   Tobias, whose Treasury employees union represents 140,000 federal
workers, said, ``People will be summarily discharged if they fail to
get the security clearance. There are many jobs for which the
security clearance is required and if they lose it they'll be
fired.''
   He said his represents all the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
employees, all of whom must have security clearances, as well as
many Energy Department employees whose jobs require security
clearances.
   The same impact was predicted in the private sector.
   The Machinists' Ziska said, ``Lifting a clearance could mean a
lower paying job or firing. With vague standards, this could be used
against union shop stewards and leave a lot of room for abuse.''
   Hancock, whose Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union represents
10,000 workers at privately owned nuclear plants, said, ``If they
don't have a security clearance in those plants, they don't work.
And they don't get paid waiting around the hearings that are
provided now, although it takes weeks and months to get through them.
   ``Under this, your clearance could be revoked for reasons that
have nothing to do with national security, but more to do with your
personal behavior.''
   Last October, the House intelligence committee said there were
2.8 million Pentagon workers and 1.1 million defense industry
employees whose jobs required security clearances. In addition, all
employees of the CIA, FBI and National Security Agency must have
clearances as must numerous Energy and Treasury Department employees.
   ``Circulation of the proposed executive order is the Bush
administration's first opportunity to review the question of access
to classified information,'' said National Security Council
spokesman Bob Hall.

<HEAD>Federal Judge To Slow Down Work Over Killed Pay Raise</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto CS3</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief federal judge for southern Ohio says
he intends to work at a slower pace because Congress killed a 51
percent pay raise, and says other judges have called to say they
sympathize.
   ``I've had a number of them (fellow judges) call me and
congratulate me for saying it,'' U.S. District Judge Carl B. Rubin
said Friday. ``I don't ask anybody to join me. It's a matter of your
own conscience.''
   Rubin, a 17-year federal judge nominated to the bench by
President Nixon, said his slowdown would not involve criminal cases,
most of which must be heard within periods defined by the federal
speedy trial law.
   But Rubin, who prides himself on moving quickly to resolve civil
lawsuits, said he would hear those cases at a slower pace.
   ``All I'm doing is, I'm going to the level of the average federal
judge. That's all I'm doing,'' Rubin said. ``Would you rather that I
got a picket sign and walked in front of the Capitol?''
   S. Arthur Spiegel, another judge in the Cincinnati federal court,
said he sympathized with his colleague. ``I'm certainly disappointed
that we didn't get our raise,'' Spiegel said.
   The third judge in Cincinnati, Herman J. Weber, declined to
comment.
   Members of Congress and federal judges are paid $89,500 a year.
Under intense criticism from voters, Congress voted Tuesday to block
a proposal which would have automatically raised pay to $135,000
annually. President Bush signed the legislation.
   Rubin, 69, said he will limit himself to two civil trials a
month, starting with his oldest cases. Instead of a lawsuit going to
trial within a year in Rubin's court, it now will take the national
average of approximately 20 months, he said.
   ``I'm not willing to take this lying down,'' Rubin said. ``I
believe I have been dealt with unjustly.''
   He calculated he would be working at $100 an hour _ 900 hours a
year, or approximately 20 hours a week.
   Rubin said his current salary buys less than his first $40,000
salary as a federal judge 17 years ago. He said he would need at
least $120,000 a year to restore the purchasing power he had when he
was appointed.
   ``I do this with great reluctance. I just don't know any other
way. I'm not going to go on strike,'' he said.
   One effect of Rubin's decision could be to delay out-of-court
settlements, since some lawsuits are resolved just before they go to
trial, said Robert A. Pitcairn Jr., a lawyer who frequently
practices in federal court.
   ``One of the strengths of Judge Rubin was his control of his
docket and how hard he worked,'' Pitcairn said.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A chartered jet brought 30 tons of
wheat and dried milk to Kabul's neediest residents Friday, beginning
a U.N. airlift after a two-day delay.
   In New Delhi, Afghan Ambassador Abdul Samad Azhar said he expects
the Soviet Union to continue arming his government after the Red
Army withdrawal is completed Wednesday.
   Azhar told a news conference: ``We will not rely only on their
material support, on their food supplies, in the future but also on
their military supplies and their moral support.''
   Soviet military transport planes have been flying food to Kabul,
which is packed with two million people and surrounded by guerrillas.
   He accused the United States and Pakistan of trying to prevent
peace by continuing to aid the Moslem guerrillas who began fighting
after a communist coup 11 years ago.
   The U.N. airlift was to have begun Wednesday, but was delayed by
a change of airlines.
   An Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 707, emblazoned with ``UN'' on one
side, arrived with 238 bags of supplies for distribution to 30,000
people considered the most vulnerable in one of Kabul's bitterest
winters of recent years.
   Guerrilla blockades and attacks on supply convoys created severe
food and fuel shortages as the Red Army packed up and left after a
nine-year campaign against the insurgents that cost 15,000 Soviet
lives.
   Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979 and an
estimated 115,000 were in the country when the withdrawal began May
15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement. Feb. 15, next Wednesday, is the
deadline for all to be gone.
   Pakistan's official news agency said the U.N. relief flight took
off from Quetta, a southwestern city 65 miles from the Afghan
border, and another flight with 36 tons of dried milk would be made
Saturday.
   Thirty centers in Kabul will distribute the food beginning
Sunday, said Steffan de Mistura, a spokesman for the U.N. Office of
Economic and Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan.
   ``This is a small step, a small shipment which we hope will be
able to make a real difference to the lives of some of the
vulnerable groups in Kabul that have been suffering from a hard
winter and being caught in the middle of war,'' said Ross Mountain,
deputy drector for Afghanistan of the U.N. Development Program.
   An estimated 350,000 people in Kabul have been seriously affected
by food and fuel shortages. U.N. officials say those suffering the
most are children aged 1-5, pregnant women and nursing mothers.
   About 400 tons of food, medicine and blankets will be flown to
Kabul in a 10-day period, weather permitting, de Mistura said.
   Soviet military jets began bring bringing flour, canned meat and
other staples to the city last month. Dozens of Soviet transports
land in Kabul every day, but Soviet officers say the airlift will
stop when control of the airport is turned over to the Afghan army
next week.
   More than 6,000 tons of flour has been flown in so far this
month, about half the amount intended by the withdrawal deadline,
Soviet officials said.
   The Soviet supplies are distributed on a coupon-rationing system,
but only government employees and supporters of the Communist Party
have access to the coupons.
   When Friday's U.N. flight arrived, de Mistura said: ``I find it
rather beautiful that after many years when the United Nations has
been airlifting goods into Ethiopia, it is the Ethiopian airline
that helps out the U.N.''
   Michael Keating of the World Food Program said the crew had no
problems on the flight.
   In neighboring Pakistan, Afghan rebels met to choose a future
Islamic government for Afghanistan, but guerrillas based in Iran
boycotted the council because of a feud with the Pakistani-based
faction.
   A spokesman for Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, chairman of the guerrilla
alliance based in Pakistan, said the meeting would adjourn
``indefinitely'' while a compromise was arranged.

<HEAD>European Trade Official Urges US to Take Lead in Hormone Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Washington should give Europe ``some
kind of signal'' to break the deadlock over a ban on imports of
hormone-treated beef from the United States, the top West European
trade official said Friday.
   ``I think they should start'' trying to resolve the dispute,
Frans Andriessen, new foreign affairs chief of the European Economic
Community, said in an interview at the Brussels headquarters of the
12-nation trading bloc.
   He said the community, also known as the Common Market, is
limited in suggesting remedies because ``we believe this
(prohibition) is in complete conformity with our international
obligations.''
   ``So I think some kind of signal ... would be very helpful,''
said Andriessen, a former Dutch finance minister. ``I don't know
what can be done. What we cannot do is change fundamentally our
legislation.''
   On Jan. 1, the Common Market barred imports of meat from cattle
treated with growth hormones. When the United States refused to
comply and imposed duties on several European products, the EEC
threatened its own retaliatory tariffs.
   On Thursday, the United States blocked a European demand for an
international investigation of the American measures.
   The community has no new proposals from the United States,
Andriessen said, but added that he and Carla Hills, the new U.S.
trade representative, had a long telephone conversation late last
week.
   ``Both of us (said) that we should do lots of thinking to find
some kind of solution because ... nobody wants this matter to
escalate,'' he said.
   Andriessen will travel to Washington at the end of next week to
meet with Mrs. Hills and Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who
was U.S. trade representative in the Reagan administration. Ray
MacSharry, the EEC agriculture minister, will join some of the talks.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will be in Brussels next
week on a tour of Western Europe and has scheduled a meeting with
Common Market officials for Feb. 17.
   European foreign ministers are to meet in Brussels three days
later to decide whether to apply countermeasures against the United
States. Last month, they threatened to impose high duties on
American dried fruit and walnuts.
   ``The actions of the United States until now are not very
encouraging,'' Andriessen said. Mrs. Hills ``showed a willingness to
find a solution,'' he said, ``but she was not very specific.''
   He reported contacts with Texas officials who would like to ship
hormone-free beef to Europe, but said any deals must be worked out
through Washington.
   Europeans imposed the hormone ban on grounds the stimulants may
pose a health risk, which the United States disputes.
   Importation of about $100 million worth of beef and beef
byproducts from the United States is affected. Meat used to make pet
food is exempt.
   Total trade between the EEC and the United States last year was
an estimated $166 billion.
   Asked about prospects for trade relations with the new
administration, Andriessen said President Bush ``is very well aware
of the mentality and attitudes on this side of the Atlantic, and
that I think is an advantage.''
   He described Yeutter as a ``a determined man (who likes) to get
some results out of negotiations'' and said Mrs. Hills also has a
reputation for determination.
   ``If that is the attitude on both sides, we might have perhaps
difficult negotiations but we couldn't exclude (achieving) results
as well,'' Andriessen said.
   EEC member nations are Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, Greece,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain and
West Germany.

   The operator of Holiday Spa fitness centers in
six states was accused by the Justice Department on Friday of
discriminating against blacks who seek membership in the exercise
clubs.
   In a civil suit filed here in U.S. District Court, the department
charged that U.S. Health Inc. had instructed its employees to
discourage blacks from joining the Holiday Spas and offering less
favorable membership terms.
   The company operates spas in Maryland, Virginia, Massachusetts,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Georgia as well as the District of
Columbia.
   In a complaint signed by Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, the
department sought a court order to enjoin further practices which it
said violated the public accommodation section of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964.
   The lawsuit, filed by the department's civil rights division,
charged that staff members were told to offer less favorable
membership and credit terms for black applicants than were offered
to whites.
   In addition, the suit charged that the Towson, Md.-based company
violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, by denying financing for
membership fees to blacks.
   ``Defendant has made statements, in account of race and color,
that would discourage a reasonable black person from making or
pursuing a credit application to purchase a membership and-or
entitlement to use the facilities of its health and fitness
centers,'' the complaint stated.
   A reporter's telephone call seeking comment from the company was
not immediately returned.
   The Justice Department found that a manager in Media, Pa., told
employees that white, middle-class executives were the ``favored
clientele,'' according to a report of the agency's investigation.
   The manager ``stated that the presence of blacks would interfere
with this regular business, describing a scenario of a prospective
white member seeing `niggers' in the swimming pool,'' the report
said.
   The manager told employees ``whites won't patronize a place if
there is a mix of races,'' the report said.

   A PLO envoy read a litany of abuse he
blamed on Israeli soldiers in the occupied lands Friday during a
U.N. debate that followed U.S. criticism of troops for shooting
civilians and destroying homes.
   ``Have you ever heard, even during the Dark Ages, of the
demolition of a family's home because of a stone thrown by a child
at occupation troops?'' asked M. Nassar Kidwa, the representative of
the Palestine Liberation Organization, during the Security Council
session.
   ``Have you ever heard of the so-called plastic bullet that
settles inside the head, causing total brain damage or brain death,
mostly among children?
   ``Have you ever heard of troops, even when not in so-called
danger, being given license to fire at unarmed civilians?''
   Israeli Ambassador Johanan Bein replied: ``Israel is confronting
large-scale rioting and wide-scale violence.
   ``Gangs of youths who hurl heavy rocks and iron bars at Israelis
with very clear intent to kill are not demonstators,'' he said.
   He said Palestinians have thrown gasoline bombs at cars and
school buses ``burning alive women with babies, innocent families
taking vacations, pupils on their way to school.''
   Speakers from Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan, and Senegal called on
Israel to obey the Fourth Geneva Convention protecting civilians
during conflict.
   The U.N. session was adjourned until Monday with no vote on a
resolution.
   The PLO has tried since mid-January to draft a resolution
condemning the Israeli army, but it has been unable to formulate
language that the United States will not veto.
   At least 380 Palestinians have been killed in protests since the
uprising began in Dec. 1987, and 15 Jews have died in clashes. The
activists are trying to chase the Israelis out of the territories
seized from Arab neighbors in the 1967 Middle East War.
   The PLO and Arab League renewed their efforts this week after the
U.S. State Department criticized the Israeli army in a human rights
report. The report said the army's tactics caused ``many avoidable
deaths and injuries.''
   The State Department, normally a staunch backer of Israel's
policies, said Israeli soldiers ``frequently used gunfire in
situations that did not present mortal danger to troops, causing
many avoidable deaths and injuries.''
   The State Department also condemned the demolition of at least
108 houses and sealing of 46 homes in 1988.
   The occupants were accused of security violations, but the houses
were demolished before trial or conviction.

<HEAD>Winner of $1.3 Million Pennsylvania Lottery Prize Disputed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ten car dealership employees who routinely pool
money to buy lottery tickets are challenging a co-worker's claim
that she and her husband alone won a $1.3 million jackpot before she
quit her job, their lawyer said Friday.
   State lottery officials said Friday they would hold up payment of
the jackpot until they determine the rightful winner of the Feb. 3
Wild Card Lotto drawing, which is worth $63,190 a year for 21 years
before taxes.
   ``They could go to court,'' said lottery spokeswoman Jane Shafer
in Harrisburg. ``They may settle out of court. We're like a stakes
holder. We're just waiting to find out who is the rightful party to
pay.''
   Officials said a woman and her husband, whom they refused to
identify, walked into the state lottery office in the northwestern
Pennsylvania town of Meadville on Monday with what was apparently
the winning ticket.
   Later that day, attorney John Petruso filed a counter-claim for
the same prize on behalf of 10 people, said Judy Terrell of the
Meadville lottery office.
   The dispute involves workers at Smith-Gray Cadillac Oldsmobile in
Meadville, 10 of whom pooled $50 to buy tickets for three lottery
drawings, one Feb. 3 and two the following week, Petruso said.
   Names of the 10 participants were written on an envelope, he
said. He declined to identify the woman who bought the tickets for
the other workers, but said she was not one of the participants in
the drawing.
   Petruso said the woman told a co-worker on Sunday that none of
the pool's tickets were winners, but that a ticket she and her
husband bought won.
   At work Monday, Petruso said, ``she was congratulated by
everybody. Then at some point, there were questions asked as to
where the ticket came from.'' He contended it came from the pool's
block of tickets.
   The woman quit her job Tuesday, he said.
   Shafer said ownership disputes have occurred ``two or three
times'' in the lottery commission's 17-year history.
   The winning ticket was one of a block of $1 tickets bought at the
same time, Shafer said. But she wouldn't disclose how many tickets
had been bought or whether the winning one was in the middle of the
block or at an end.
   Maxine Percy, who sells lottery tickets at the store where the
disputed ticket was bought, said she couldn't recall who bought the
tickets.
   ``No one can remember what she looks like,'' said Percy. ``She
came in quite a bit, but nobody paid much attention. She just bought
them for all the guys at Smith-Gray.''
   Lottery officials said the period of several weeks for processing
a lottery jackpot helps ensure that possible challenges will be
filed before money is paid.
   They said that period was lengthened in part because of a fraud
case last year. The lottery ``winner'' drew the first annual check
before it was discovered the ticket was phony.

<HEAD>Barbara Bush, Mila Mulroney Read Nursery Tale to Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The kids got a real hoot Friday out of Barbara Bush
and Mila Mulroney.
   Within minutes of arriving in Ottawa with President Bush, who
left to meet with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Mrs. Bush and Mrs.
Mulroney spent about 30 minutes visiting more than 250 young
children at a school.
   They read from the book ``Owl Moon,'' stumbling momentarily over
who was to handle the hooting despite the handy instructions pasted
to pages by aides.
   ``It's terrible ... sorry,'' Mrs. Bush said after inadvertently
delivering a series of hoots intended for her partner.
   Later, the two fielded questions.
   Mrs. Bush, 63, was asked whether she liked being the wife of a
president.
   ``I have loved being George Bush's wife for 44 years, so yes,''
she said.
   Mrs. Mulroney, 36, assured the children there was a lot of work
but ``prime ministers' wives have a lot of fun.''
   Each listed her duties, from running households to answering mail
and working for favorite causes such as literacy and AIDS research
for Mrs. Bush and cystic fibrosis research for Mrs. Mulroney.
   ``But all of them are so much fun and so important that I don't
feel like it's work,'' said Mrs. Bush.
   The children gathered in a gymnasium in one wing of an old
convent school where they were entertained in a sing-song by a
guitar-playing duo who crooned such favorites as ``Jimmy Crack
Corn,'' ``Zippity Do Da'' and ``Skinamarinky Do.''
   Among them was 3-year-old Nicolas Mulroney, who snuggled between
the two while they read to his playmates.
   The gym walls were adorned with youthful handiwork: signs of
welcome, a banner reading ``Hands Across the Border'' and Canadian
and U.S. flags.
   The children greeted the visitors with a song written for the
occasion: ``Hello ladies. What do you say? It's going to be a happy
day.''
   Natalie Ryan, 11, said it sounded like the women had wonderful
lives because ``you always get to go everywhere and you always have
security guards and aides to look after you.''
   After the visit, the women toured the National Art Gallery,
stopping to admire works depicting the windswept shores of central
Ontario lakes.
   A reporter asked Mrs. Bush if she knew many of those same lakes
were dead or dying as a result of acid rain _ a topic atop the
agenda of her husband's meeting with the prime minister.
   ``They're beautiful,'' she said of the paintings before walking
away. ``They're beautiful.''

   Soldiers raided homes in six West Bank towns and
villages Friday and seven Palestinians were wounded by army gunfire
in scattered clashes, including a 15-year-old who lost his eye, army
and Arab reports said.
   In the West Bank town of Bir Zeit, activists of the Palestinian
Communist Party staged a march to mark the seventh anniversary of
the party's founding. The party is illegal in Israel.
   About 100 people took part, marching with red banners and
Palestinian flags, witnesses said. Many hid their faces behind Arab
keffiyehs, or checkered headdresses, or used black hoods with eye
slits.
   Arab hospitals reported that seven Palestinians suffered gunshot
wounds in stone-throwing clashes with Israeli soldiers, including a
12-year-old boy and an 11-year-old girl.
   In the Gaza Strip town of Rafah, a 15-year-old Arab boy, Anwar
Suleiman El-Eid, was hit in the eye with a rubber bullet and lost
the eye, Arab reports said. The army command confirmed a 15-year-old
was injured in Rafah but had no other details.
   The army conducted raids in Qalqilya, Jenin, Kussera and Tulat in
the north and Hebron and the nearby village of Dahariya in the
south, detaining Palestinians suspected of firebomb attacks or
threats against fellow Arabs viewed as pro-Israeli collaborators, a
spokeswoman said.
   The spokeswoman, who cannot be identified in keeping with army
regulations, refused to say how many people were arrested.
   The raids came two days after an Israeli settler died in a car
fire near the West Bank settlement of Alfei Menashe.
   Police initially said Albert Jerassi's car was firebombed but
later said they were unable to pinpoint the cause of the blaze.
   In the West Bank town of Ramallah, residents began a three-day
strike to protest the death of a 17-year-old resident killed when
military guards opened fire Wednesday to quell a riot in the Megiddo
prison in northern Israel. Nidal Zuhdi Deeb was one of two prisoners
killed in the incident.
   He was the 380th Palestinian to be killed in the uprising.
Fifteen Israelis have died.
   Also Friday, the army destroyed a house in the village of Burkin
near Jenin. It was the home of a Palestinian youth ``suspected as
one of the ringleaders'' in the uprising, the army said.
   The army also informed nine families their homes would be
destroyed or sealed as punishment for anti-Israeli activities. The
notice apparently was given in advance to give the families time to
appeal, Israel radio said.
   Israeli troops have destroyed or sealed more than 190 homes in
the occupied lands since the uprising began.

   The military and police arrested more than
3,700 people and seized more than 3,000 pounds of opium in drug
raids last year, a state-owned newspaper said Friday.
   The total worth of the seizures, which also included 854 pounds

the Working People's Daily said.
   The raids on both jungle and urban hideouts produced 3,718
arrests and netted 3,032 pounds of opium, the report said. No
details were given on the status of those arrested.
   Opium, a major product in Burma, can be refined to make heroin.

<HEAD>Kohl Wants NATO Decision on Modernization Delayed Until 1991</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl fears a
controversial NATO proposal to upgrade some European nuclear
missiles would spoil opportunities for arms control, and he is
expected to press NATO to delay the decision three years.
   Kohl's spokesman told reporters Friday the chancellor sees no
reason for the alliance to decide prematurely on the question of
``modernization'' of short-range missiles when no decision is
necessary before 1991 or 1992.
   A NATO decision on whether to proceed with plans to replace
U.S.-made Lance missiles with longer-range rockets had been expected
in June, when Kohl and leaders of the other 15 alliance members
gather for a summit in Brussels.
   The United States, Britain and other NATO members have made clear
they intend to reaffirm the decision taken five years ago that calls
for replacement of aging short-range missiles.
   But West Germans have been demonstrating increasing resistance to
the plan because of what they see as improved opportunity for
disarmament progress in light of troop reduction proposals by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``We want no decision during this dynamic disarmament process,''
Kohl's spokesman, Friedhelm Ost, said at a news conference.
   ``We will discuss all of the elements of our strategy'' at the
Brussels summit, Ost said, ``but we want to leave our options open.''
   Kohl said in an interview published Friday that the Lance
missiles ``remain sufficient and intact until 1995,'' and that the
alliance should put off its decision on modernization for the next
three years.
   He also rejected the view of some allies that West Germany's
position on modernization will be a test of its loyalty to the
alliance.
   ``It doesn't interest me at all if others see this as a sort of
litmus test,'' Kohl told the British daily Financial Times. ``I have
to represent German interests, and I am a reliable partner.''
   Public opinion polls show that 75 percent of West Germans favor
removal of all nuclear weapons from Europe and that an even larger
percentage see no serious security threat from the East.
   Those sentiments run counter to NATO policy, which has demanded
the Warsaw Pact's superiority in conventional weaponry be reduced
before the West trades away its nuclear options.
   At an annual NATO strategy session in January, West Germany took
a verbal beating from allied defense experts for dragging its feet
on the question.
   Ost denied that the delay in making a decision was connected to
nationwide elections scheduled for December 1990. Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union has lost ground in regional contests the past two
years.
   The modernization plan would replace all 88 Lance launchers and
the more than 700 missiles deployed with the firing units. The new
missiles would be capable of reaching targets 300 miles away,
compared with their current range of 75 miles.
   The replacement missiles would bring the NATO short-range
capability to the threshold of the medium-range class, which is
being abolished under the December 1987 U.S.-Soviet agreement.
   Soviet and East-bloc officials contend the modernization program
is intended to make up some of the ground bargained away by the
medium-range agreement and that such a move would jeopardize arms
control efforts.

<HEAD>Number Of Workers Hired Declines Sharply In January</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of workers hired by farmers showed a
sharp decline to an estimated 701,000 in January from 976,000 last
October, partly seasonal but also because of poor weather
conditions, the Agriculure Department said Friday.
   Those did not include 152,000 ``agricultural service'' workers
provided by crew chiefs and labor contractors. Last fall, those
totaled 274,000 workers.
   The report said ``substantial rains'' occurred during the Jan.
8-14 week when the labor survey was made, from eastern Texas into
the middle Atlantic states.
   The report said the national figures for hired workers had a
sampling error of 4.1 percent.
   Average pay for all workers hired directly by farmers was $5.51
per hour, up from $5.18 during last fall's survey week of Oct. 9-15.
   For workers hired by contractors, there was no national wage rate
available. However, workers in California were reported at $6.42 per
hour in January, up from $6.16 last fall, and Florida at $5.79 in
January and $4.98 last fall.

<HEAD>With AM-Vatican-Racism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Excerpts from the English-language document
on racism prepared by the Vatican's Justice and Peace Commission at
the request of Pope John Paul II.
   On South Africa:
   The most obvious form of racism, in the strictest sense of the
word, to be found today is ``institutionalized racism.''
   This type is still sanctioned by the constitution and laws of a
country. It is justified by an ideology of the superiority of
persons from European stock over those of African or Indian origin
or ``colored,'' which is, by some, supported by an erroneous
interpretation of the Bible. This is the regime of ``apartheid'' or
of ``separate development.''
   This regime in the Republic of South Africa has long been
characterized by a radical segregation in vast areas of public life,
between the black, colored, Indian and white peoples, with only the
latter, although numerically a minority, holding political power and
considering themselves masters of by far the greatest part of the
territory. All South Africans are defined by a race to which they
are officially assigned.
   Although some steps toward change have been taken in recent
years, the black majority of the population remains excluded from
effective representation in national government and enjoys
citizenship in word only. Many are relegated to ``homelands'' which
are hardly capable of being self-sustaining and are moreover
economically and politically dependent on the central power.
   South Africa is an extreme case of a vision of racial inequality.
The prolongation of a state of repression, of which the majority of
the population is victim, is less and less tolerated. Such a
situation carries within it the seed of racist reflexes on the part
of the oppressed, which would be as unacceptable as those of which
they are victim today.
   For this reason, it is urgent that these prejudices be overcome
in order to build the future on the principle of the equal dignity
of every person. Experience has shown moreover that peaceful
evolutions are possible in this regard. The entire south African
community, as well as the international community, must make every
effort to promote a concrete dialogue between the principal parties
involved.
   On anti-Semitism:
   If anti-Semitism has been the most tragic form that racist
ideology has assumed in our century, with the horrors of the Jewish
Holocaust, it has unfortunately not yet entirely disappeared. As if
some had nothing to learn from the crimes of the past, certain
organizations, with branches in many countries, keep alive the
anti-Semitic racist myth, with the support of networks of
publications.
   Terrorist acts which have Jewish persons or symbols as their
target have multiplied in recent years and show the radicalism of
such groups. Anti-Zionism _ which is not of the same order, since it
questions the State of Israel and its policies _ serves at times as
a screen for anti-Semitism, feeding on it and leading to it.
Furthermore, some countries impose undue harassments and
restrictions on the free emigration of Jews.
   On the dangers of science:
   There is widespread fear that new and as yet unknown forms of
racism might appear. This at times is expressed concerning the use
that could be made of ``techniques of artificial procreation''
through in vitro fertilization and the possibilities of genetic
manipulation. Although such fears are still in part hypothetical,
they nonetheless draw the attention of humanity to the new and
disquieting dimension of man's power over man and thus to the urgent
need for corresponding ethical principles.
   It is more important that laws determine as soon as possible the
limits which must no be surpassed so that such ``techniques'' will
not fall into the hands of abusive and irresponsible powers who
might seek to ``produce'' human beings selected according to racial
criteria or any other characteristic.
   This would give rise to a resurgence of the deadly myth of
eugenic racism, the misdeeds of which the world has already
experienced. A similar abuse would be to prevent the birth of human
beings of one or another social or ethnic category through abortion
and sterilization campaigns. Wherever the absolute respect for life
and its transmission according to the Creator's intentions
disappears, it is to be feared that all moral restraint on a
person's power will also disappear, including the power to fashion
humanity in the derisive image of these apprentice sorcerers.
   On the United States:
   It was only in 1964 that the Civil Rights Law put an end to all
forms of legally practiced discrimination. This represented a
considerable step forward, matured over a long period and marked by
numerous initiatives of non-violent nature. The Catholic Church,
especially through its extensive educational system, as well as
through the declarations of the Episcopate, contributed to this
process.
   Despite ongoing efforts, much still remains to be done to
eliminate completely racial prejudice and behavior even in what can
be considered one of the most interracial nations of the world.
Proof of this is the statement adopted by the Administrative Board
of the United States Catholic Conference on March 26, 1987 which
pointed out the persistence of signs of racism in American society
and condemned the activity of racist organizations such as the Ku
Klux Klan.

<HEAD>Sihanouk Says Pol Pot Won't Retake Power</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodian rebel leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk
said Friday that Pol Pot, who led the Khmer Rouge during its reign
of terror in the 1970s, will have no role in a future government in
Cambodia.
   ``I solemnly declare that there is no question of letting Mr. Pol
Pot return to power,'' Sihanouk said.
   His announcement came a day after resistance leaders meeting in
Beijing announced a peace plan for Cambodia.
   That plan would join the Khmer Rouge in a provisional government
with other rebel groups and the current Vietnamese-backed government
of Hun Sen, but it seeks to prevent any attempt by the Khmer Rouge
to seize complete control.
   China and Thailand, two leading supporters of the Cambodian
resistance, expressed support Friday for establishing such a
provisional government, according to China's Xinhua News Agency.
   Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila and his Chinese
counterpart, Qian Qichen, also voiced support for Sihanouk and
called for strict U.N. supervision of Vietnam's troop withdrawal.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1979 and its troops remained to prop
up the central government. Hanoi says it will withdraw its 50,000
troops, whose numbers are put much higher by Western sources, by
September if the warning parties reach a political settlement.
   Vietnam's decision to pull out troops prompted a flurry of talks
aimed atsaid Friday that Pol Pot would have no place in
a permanent Cambodian government.
   ``If one day, there are elections held in Cambodia under the
United Nations, Mr. Pol Pot will not take part,'' he said. ``And
after the elections, there will be no question of giving Mr. Pol Pot
a place in the government of free Cambodia.''
   Pol Pot led the pro-Chinese Khmer Rouge during its reign of
Cambodia from 1975 to early 1979, when it was ousted by a Vietnamese
invasion. During Pol Pot's rule, an estimated 2 million of
Cambodia's 8 million people died from Khmer Rouge executions, famine
and civil unrest.
   Since the invasion, the Khmer Rouge have joined in resistance
with forces of Sihanouk, Cambodia's former ruler; and Son Sann, a
Western-oriented politician.
   On Thursday in Beijing, Khieu Samphan, who leads the Khmer Rouge,
declined to disclose the whereabouts of Pol Pot. He also refused to
comment on reports that China offered to let Pol Pot live in Beijing.
   Under the resistance leaders' proposal, 2,000 U.N. personnel
would supervise the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops.
   A U.N. peacekeeping force would also be stationed in Cambodia
afterward to keep the Khmer Rouge from monopolizing power, prevent a
civil war and protect Cambodia from the possibility of another
Vietnamese invasion.
   A provisional government including resistance and government
representatives would lead the country until general elections.
   The plan will be discussed during talks of Southeast Asian
nations, including Vietnam, in Jakarta, Indonesia, beginning Feb. 19.

<DATELINE>HARLINGEN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City officials Friday evicted the
Immigration and Naturalization Service from the building where
thousands of Central Americans apply for asylum each week, accusing
the INS of failing to follow fire codes or clean up litter and human
waste around the building.
   ``We are finally forced to take this drastic action,'' said Mayor
Bill Card. ``It's a situation where we have not been able to get the
cooperation and the attention of the federal government.''
   The fire marshal and police cleared the building at 10 a.m., then
locked the two main entrances and sealed a third with duct tape. A
notice was put on the door saying it was not safe for habitation.
   State District Judge Robert Garza later granted the city a
temporary restraining order, forbidding the INS to reopen the
application center or any other facility in Harlingen ``in such a
manner as to constitute a nuisance and threat to public health and
safety.''
   About 100 Central Americans and some INS employees stood outside
the padlocked building while police turned away arriving immigrants.
   ``We don't know what is happening,'' said Juan Francisco Mayrena,
a Nicaraguan who was waiting in a van with about 15 other Central
Americans.
   On some nights, scores of Central Americans sleep outside the
building to secure places in line the next morning.
   Four portable toilets at the side of the building have been
allowed to overflow, according to the city's lawsuit, and the
parking lot and nearby vacant lots are littered with trash, rotting
food and human waste.
   The INS kept a fire exit at the center locked and had seating for
450 people in a building where the maximum occupancy under the fire
code is 196, according to the lawsuit.
   The INS hasn't performed any health screening of the asylum
refugees for communicable diseases, the lawsuit said. Local health
officials have reported an increase in hepatitis cases.
   The city commission voted unanimously Friday to close the center,
a former furniture store on the edge of town. The INS leases it from
Wolfgang Benner of Lewisville, who is also listed as a defendant.
There was no answer Friday at Benner's home in suburban Dallas.
   INS officials say they have been working to improve the center.
   The agency has resolved two of the three fire code violations
brought to its attention, including recharging fire extinguishers
and leaving a side door unlocked as a fire escape, said INS attorney
David Ayala.
   The INS also was reducing the seating capacity, he said.
   Omer ``Jerry'' Sewell, director of the INS Harlingen district,
said he was shocked by the city's action.
   INS officials did not say when or how they'll resume processing
asylum applications in the area.
   The state judge set a Feb. 17 hearing on the eviction case.
   On Feb. 20, U.S. District Judge Felemon Vela is to rule on an INS
policy that could bar asylum-seekers from leaving southern Texas
until their applications are decided.
   Refugee advocates sued the INS on Jan. 6 and Vela ordered the INS
policy put on temporary hold, allowing the people to travel again.
But Vela has said he probably will allow the INS to resume its
travel restriction policy.
   Local officials have said they were planning something to get
federal attention. They complain the federal government has dumped
responsibility for the immigrants onto residents of the lower Rio
Grande Valley, one of the poorest areas in the country.
   The influx of immigrants into the border city of Brownsville and
Harlingen, 25 miles north, swelled last spring and reached a crisis
point after the INS adopted its travel restriction Dec. 16.
   Shelters filled up and hundreds, possibly thousands, of people
were forced to stayed in run-down buildings and squalid camps around
Brownsville.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, and Rep. Solomon Ortiz, D-Texas,
have introduced bills that would provide federal assistance to
people while their asylum applications are pending.

<HEAD>Neo-Nazi Leader Says He Formed New Group</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of an outlawed neo-Nazi
group said Friday he has formed a new one to pursue his political
goals, although the banning order prohibits him from forming
successor organizations.
   His goals include expelling foreign workers and people who have
sought asylum in West Germany.
   ``Right after the banning of the Nationale Sammlung, I formed a
new organization with the name Initiative Volkswille (Popular Will
Initiative),'' Michael Kuehnen said. ``I want to keep being
politically active.''
   Kuehnen said he hoped to run candidates in municipal elections in
North Rhine-Westphalia state this autumn.
   In Bonn, Interior Ministry spokesman Michael-Andreas Butz said
Thursday's ban of the Nationale Sammlung a was a success and noted
that the order would keep the party out of city elections in
Frankfurt and Langen next month. There was no official to Kuehnen's
announcement that he had formed a new group.
   Nationale Sammlung had entered candidates in the Frankfurt and
Langen elections. Its platform included renaming a railway station
after Adolf Hitler.
   An appeals court ruled Friday that the radical right-wing German
National Democratic Party may hold a two-day rally this weekend at
Rahden.
   Officials in Rahden, about 35 miles south of Bremen, said they
had forbidden the rally because they feared violence. A court in
Minden rejected the ban and the appeals court in Muenster agreed.
   More than 1,000 people are expected to attend the annual rally of
the party, which seeks the expulsion of foreigners to maintain a
``national German identity.''
   Kuehnen, who has spent more than seven years in prison for his
neo-Nazi activities, spoke to reporters outside a Munich court,
where he was fined $490 for holding an illegal rally there in the
Bavarian capital in May.
   He said most members of his new group belonged to Nationale
Sammlung. and ``We want to do away with the system.''
   Police raided homes of Nationale Sammlung members, confiscating
guns, knives, ammunition and Nazi propaganda.
   ``The Gruesome Dreams of Neo-Nazi Kuehnen,'' said a headline in
the mass-circulation newspaper Bild.
   It quoted Kuehnen as saying Hitler ``is for me the greatest
German in our history. We're continuing what he wanted.''
   The crackdown on Kuehnen's 170-member group came as West Germans
warily eye a possible resurgence of right-wing extremism.
   Opposition Social Democrats in the Parliament scheduled a hearing
Wednesday to discuss the Republican Party, another extreme
right-wing group that made a strong showing in West Berlin elections
last month.
   The Social Democrats want to question domestic intelligence
experts about what they know about the party, headed by former Nazi
Waffen SS soldier Franz Schoenhuber.
   Social Democrats have long argued that official government
figures fail to take account of all extreme-rightist tendencies. The
number of such extremists is now estimated at 28,300 nationwide,
with more than 1,500 classified as neo-Nazis.
   In founding the Nationale Sammlung last summer, Kuehnen and his
followers wrote: ``We must create a national-revolutionary and
social-revolutionary alternative. We must make protest-voters aware
of this alternative.''
   The federal government cited that statement to justify its
argument the Nationale Sammlung was attacking West Germany's
democratic system and should be banned.

<HEAD>Report: Death of Man Due to Obesity, Exhaustion, Face-Down Position</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A large man whose death in police custody set
off two nights of street violence suffocated partly from the
exhaustion of a violent struggle with officers and from being bound
face-down in a small space, a medical report said Friday.
   An autopsy revealed that Edgar Allen Price, a 40-year-old black
man, asphyxiated Feb. 1 after the struggle with eight police
officers during an undercover crack cocaine bust.
   Prosecutors are investigating the death to determine if there was
any criminal negligence or wrongdoing on the part of arresting
officers.
   At least 10 people were arrested in the two nights of
disturbances, and five officers received minor injuries. One grocery
store was looted and torched. The Tampa incidents followed three
nights of rioting last month in Miami, which were sparked by the
fatal shooting of a black motorcyclist by a policeman.
   The 6-foot-3 Price was hogtied, with hands cuffed behind him and
legs manacled then tied to the wrists, normally a method of
restraint that is ``relatively innocuous. However, in this case a
different set of circumstances existed,'' Dr. Charles Diggs,
associate Hillsborough County medical examiner said in his report.
   ``Mr. Price was a 296-pound individual who had undergone
extensive physical exertion and hyperventilation during the
scuffle,'' Diggs said. ``By being placed in a limited space with the
head face down into the back seat associated with limited activity
from being handcuffed and restrained, the necessary conditions for
producing an asphyxial death existed.''
   Diggs said the autopsy showed seven bruises on the arms, legs and
abdomen and a single 1}-inch cut on the head. ``None of these
injuries contributed to nor produced the death in this individual,''
he added.
   Diggs was unavailable for comment Friday, according to medical
investigator Jack Hall.
   ``I think we pretty much expected this,'' said police spokesman
Steve Cole. ``I don't think there are any surprises. It further
illustrates he did not die from any wounds from us hitting him, or
he was not choked to death.''
   Deputy Police Chief Tom Depolis had acknowledged that officers
used nightsticks and flashlights on Price, who was punching and
kicking.
   Police said they tried to arrest Price after an informant made a
crack cocaine buy in College Hill, a predominantly black housing
development.
   Price battled officers before he was finally cuffed and bound and
placed belly-down in the back of a cruiser, a routine police
procedure to subdue a combative prisoner, officials said.
   When medical personnel arrived, rock- and bottle-throwing erupted
before they could check Price in the back of the cruiser.
   ``He was put into the cruiser and removed from the area for his
own safety,'' said Cole.
   It was after a one-minute ride that officials noticed Price was
having trouble breathing, authorities said. He died at a hospital
two hours later.
   Police officers who subdued Price said he was conscious and
showed no signs of breathing problems when they put him in the car.
   Two officers have been placed on administrative leave while
prosecutors review the case.
   Price served 11 years of a 50-year prison sentence in Texas for
attempted murder of a Houston police officer and a string of
robberies. He was paroled in 1984 and came to Tampa in 1986, police
said. His girlfriend said Price worked as a long-distance trucker
and laborer.
   The Tampa Tribune reported Friday that Price had no cocaine in
his system when he died but had a blood-alcohol level of 0.06
percent. The legal standard for drunken driving is 0.10.

<TEXT>
   Farmers who signed up to produce 1989 soybeans
on land normally used to grow other crops will be allowed to plant
80 percent of the acreage they had requested, Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter announced Friday.
   Yeutter also said farmers who asked to plant sunflowers, another
oilseed crop, on 1989 land normally used for the other crops will be
allowed to plant all that they requested.
   The options were authorized by Congress in last year's Disaster
Assistance Act, which was drawn up to help farmers recover from the
devastating 1988 drought.
   Normally, farmers have to use their ``permitted acreage'' under
the government's programs for wheat, feed grains, cotton and rice in
order to protect their crop base, or history of plantings.
   But the legislation authorized the Agriculture Department to
allow soybeans and sunflowers on the acres without farmers losing
their acreage history.
   The law also directed USDA to adjust the special plantings so
that the expected additional production doesn't force the 1989
market price of soybeans below $5.49 per bushel, or 115 percent of
the 1988 price support level.
   After reviewing the acreage requested by farmers, Yeutter said it
was decided to trim the additional 1989 soybeans to 80 percent of
the 3.5 million acres they had signed up to plant.
   Sunflower producers asked to plant 353,000 acres on their other
cropland, and they will be allowed 100 percent of what they sought.

   A Superior Court jury convicted Peter T.
Trepanier Friday on 27 counts stemming from a series of sniper
attacks that terrorized northern Rhode Island two winters ago.
   The jury found Trepanier guilty of six counts each of assault
with intent to commit murder and conspiracy to commit murder,
resulting from six sniper attacks that wounded four people in
Cumberlanhfield in December 1986 and January 1987.
   Trepanier was also convicted of three counts of first-degree
arson and six countd and North Smits each of conspiracy to enter a dwelling
and
entering a dwelling with intent to commit larceny in housebreaks and
house fires in Burrillville and Glocester from April to June 1987.
The arson charges carry a maximum penalty of life in prison.
   Trepanier was acquitted on two charges, both relating to a
seventh burglary.
   Trepanier, 25, stared at the court clerk and showed no emotion as
the verdicts were read. There was no reaction from spectators in the
crowded courtroom.
   Superior Court Judge Dominic F. Cresto dismissed charges
pertaining to an eighth burglary and a seventh sniper attack before
the case went to the jury on Tuesday, saying there was not enough
evidence to support them.
   During the time of   Prosecutor Eva Marie Mancuso said before the trial
began that her
case would be based on circumstantial evidence.
   She summoned ballistics experts to link a rifle found in Stump
Pond in Smithfield to bullet fragments and casings found at the
scene of several of the shootings, although the experts were unable
to establish a definite link because they could not test the rifle
itself.
   Paula Laliberte, a friend of Trepanier's, testified that
Trepanier confessed to her about the burglaries and snipings several
hours before she persuaded him to turn himself in to police.
   John J. Hardiman, Trepanier's lawyer, portrayed Trepanier as a
jokester and attention-getter who confessed to crimes to get
publicity, and said Trepanier's knowledge of the crimes was gathered
from the media.
   Trepanier and Ducharme also face charges in two sniping attacks
in Bellingham, Mass., just north of the Rhode Island border.
Massachusetts authorities said they were waiting for the Rhode
Island cases to finish before pressing charges.

<HEAD>Soviet Banker Says `Nyet' To Helping Trim Deficit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Soviet banker said Friday that if government
ministers knock at his door seeking cash to eliminate the
government's budget deficit, the answer will be a firm ``nyet.''
   The statement by Vyacheslav S. Zakharov, deputy chairman of the
board of the Soviet State Bank, showed a rare rift in the government
about how to tackle the country's financial woes.
   Zakharov said the State Bank already has handed over to the
government 63.4 billion rubles _ about $102 billion at official
rates _ and is not eager to give any more.
   Some economists have projected the deficit will reach $160
billion this year, although Zakharov put the figure at $56 billion.
The total Soviet budget is $789 billion.
   Zakharov appeared to become angry when asked at a news conference
whether his bank would help erase the red ink.
   ``It is the difficulty of the Ministry of Finance. And the
Ministry of Finance must deal with its own problems on its own,''
said Zakharov.
   Later, he said the deficit is the ministry's ``responsibility,
its trouble, its misfortune.''
   Aside from the money it already contributes, he said: ``The state
bank will not give one kopeck more for the financing of budget
expenses.''
   A loan could be offered, but only if interest were charged,
Zakharov indicated.
   Economists have suggested various ways of eliminating the
deficit. Oleg T. Bogomolov, director of the Institute of Economics
of the World Socialist System, told reporters Wednesday that the
government could sell land and import video recorders and personal
computers and tax them up to 10 teims their value.
   Leonid Abalkin, director of the Economics Institute, suggested
Jan. 25 that the deficit be reduced by scrapping some production
targets and closing unprofitable businesses. In addition, he told a
news conference, expensive construction projects could be canceled.
   Also at Friday's news conference, Mikhail Y. Nakhmanovich, deputy
chairman of the Soviet Savings Bank, outlined how his institution is
trying to get customers to spend their money.
   Soviets have amassed savings of $480 billion, and the savings
bank loaned just 3 billion rubles last year, Nakhmanovich said. To
encourage clients to use the bank, he said, 77,000 branches have
been opened offering 10 kinds of accounts that pay 2 percent to 4
percent interest.
   The savings bank introduced checkbooks last year, and so far 1
million have been given out, Nakhmanovich reported.
   Authorities would also like to introduce credit cards, he said,
but there aren't enough computers to run a credit card system.
Construction of one Soviet banking computer center was started 14
years ago and is still incomplete. Zakharov blamed construction
workers.

<HEAD>Labor Leader Irving Brown Is Dead at 77</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irving Brown, the AFL-CIO's director of
international affairs from 1982 to 1986 and a labor representative
on President Franklin D. Roosevelt's War Production Board from 1942
to 1945, died Friday of cancer at his home in Paris, the union said
here. He was 77.
   Brown was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom last October
by then-President Reagan, largely for his work in leading the
resistance to communist takeovers of trade unions in Western Europe
after World War II.
   ``We have lost a giant,'' said AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland.
``No other individual did more than Irving to protect and advance
workers' rights in every nation around the world.''
   As the U.S. labor movement's emissary to Europe after the war,
Brown was instrumental in rallying support among unions there for
the Marshall Plan.
   Brown, son of a Teamster, was born in New York City and graduated
with an economics degree from New York University before starting a
labor career as an organizer for the Automobile Workers Union, a
predecessor of the United Auto Workers.
   He joined the American Federation of Labor as a national
organizer in 1940 and was its chief representative in Europe from
the end of World War II until 1962, after the AFL merged with the
Congress of Industrial Organizations.
   From 1962 to 1965, Brown headed the International Confederation
of Free Trade Unions' office to the United Nations and from 1965 to
1973 directed the AFL-CIO's African-American Labor Center that
provides technical aid to unions in Africa.
   He returned to the AFL-CIO's office in Paris before Kirkland
named him the federation's international affairs director in 1982.
   Brown is survived by his wife, Irena, and a son, Robert, who
lives in New York City. A private burial service is planned in Paris.

   The Army's current strategy for acquiring light
helicopters is inconsistent with Defense Department policy and
limits the amount of information available on the aircraft before
full-scale development begins, according to a report released Friday.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress,
said the Army made considerable changes in the acquisition strategy
for the light helicopter, or LHX, to reduce development costs from
$5.4 billion to $3.9 billion.
   ``The Army has chosen a higher risk acquisition strategy that may
not provide decision-makers with critical information _ such as
demonstrated performance and validation of cost estimates _ when
needed for key decisions,'' the GAO said.
   ``This information is pivotal for the LHX program, given the
advanced technology involved and the demonstrated impact of cost
growth on the program's affordability,'' the report said.
   The LHX represents the Army's next generation of scout and attack
helicopters and the service envisions having the aircraft replace
its fleet of aging helicopters.
   The Army expects the LHX to perform a number of missions,
including battlefield reconnaissance, locating and attacking armored
targets, striking deep against enemy positions and engaging enemy
helicopters in air combat.
   The LHX program, begun in 1983, is estimated at more than $40
billion.
   The report, titled, ``Light Helicopter Program: Risks Facing the
Program Raise Doubts About the Army's Acquisition Strategy,'' said
the altered strategy eliminates the testing and evaluation of
competitive prototypes of the LHX before the Defense Department
awards a winning contract and full-scale development begins.
   This strategy runs counter to Defense Department policy, which
calls for adequate test and evaluation to establish realistic
performance thresholds and to reduce risk and uncertainty. In
addition, the President's Blue Ribbon Commission on Defense
Management recommended in 1986 that a high priority be given to
building and testing prototypes.
   The Defense Department defines prototypes as ``an original or
model on which a later item is formed or based.''
   The report also said that technical risks still remain, including
the development of advanced technology such as more advanced threat
sensors. The Army also must make additional reductions in the light
helicopter's empty weight.
   The GAO recommends that the department reassess whether the light
helicopter should receive more research and development funds for an
acquisition strategy that matches Pentagon policy.
   The Defense Department agreed in principle with the GAO's
conclusions and recommendations, but noted the amount of money
available limits the strategy.

   President Bush, declaring a determination to see
that the U.S.-Canadian friendship ``becomes even stronger,''
promised on Friday that there would be speedy American action on
curbing border-crossing acid rain pollution.
   Bush, on his first foreign trip as president, said no specific
timetable was set in talks with Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney on when acid rain-causing emissions from U.S. plants would
be curbed.
   But, he said he was committed to ``move as fast as possible'' on
the new initiatives he outlined Thursday in his speech to Congress.
   ``I have an obligation to move forward with specifics,'' Bush
said in an outdoor news conference with Mulroney after a ``working
lunch'' at the prime minister's residence.
   Later, aboard Air Force One en route to Maine, Bush said that he
felt that Mulroney, in their talks, ``was reasonably
well-satisfied'' with the U.S. statements about acid rain.
   ``I mean, they probably are a little ahead of us in terms of
where they wish we were right now in terms of bilateral
negotiations. Generally speaking, there was no tension over that.
... It was very good in that sense,'' Bush added.
   In Ottawa, Mulroney praised Bush's initiative on fighting acid
rain _ including a promise to spend $2.5 billion toward solving the
problem, vowing to propose legislation setting new limits on
smokestack emissions, and negotiating an agreement with Canada on
specific acid rain levels.
   ``This is real progress,'' Mulroney said. ``And while I suppose
I, like a lot of people, would like it done tomorrow in this area, I
know it's not going to happen. But this represents some very
measurable progress.''
   Both the prime minister and the new president proclaimed
relations between the two nations good and getting better.
   Bush said he selected Canada for his first presidential trip
outside U.S. borders to ``symbolize the importance that we place on
the relationship with Canada. We're each other's largest trading
partners. We are friends. We share a long peaceful border and we
have many common interests.''
   Standing with snow on the ground and U.S. and Canadian flags
snapping in the breeze, Bush asserted: ``We will keep in touch. And
each of us is pledged to see that this strong relationship becomes
even stronger.''
   On another subject, Bush dismissed the importance of Friday's
report from the Labor Department that wholesale prices in January
surged a full percentage point.
   He said the Producer Price Index ``jumps around some. I am not
overly concerned about inflation in the United States.'' But, he
added, he did not like the figures.
   ``The economy is growing and I think that's good,'' Bush said,
calling Friday's report ``a blip on an otherwise calm radar screen.''
   Bush said he and Mulroney discussed various topics including
trade and East-West relations.
   He said he valued Mulroney's advice on dealings with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Mulroney called the meeting ``very encouraging.''
   He fielded questions in both English and French. And at one point
Bush tried to do likewise, but his high-school French didn't take
him very far.
   Would he take a question in French? ``Mais oui,'' (but yes), Bush
said.
   However, when the question was shouted out, Bush said, ``je ne
comprends pas,'' (I don't understand).
   Bush's five-hour visit consisted of three events: a two-hour
meeting with Mulroney at ``7 Rideau Gate,'' the government's guest
house; a two-hour ``working lunch''in the prime minister's
residence, and a shorter tea at the conclusion of the day.
   Earlier, Mulroney said, ``we're here to do a little work,'' as
talk with Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III began.
   Baker said later that Bush's promise on moving to curb acid rain
represents a major shift in U.S. additude on the issue, and that
Mulroney recognized this.
   However, he said discussing a specific timetable at this point
would be premature, given regional political feelings on the issue
of cleanup costs in the United States.
   Major questions still unanswered, Baker told a briefing, are
``what is the target for reductions and who is going to pay the
price?''
   Baker said Bush and Mulroney also discussed the president's
proposal for a one-year freeze on U.S. defense spending at the level
of inflation, as well as Central America and U.S.-Soviet relations.
   He called Friday's session ``primarily an agenda-setting
meeting.''
   Bush, in address to Congress on Thursday night, made a special
pitch for fighting acid rain, and talked about his $1.16 trillion
fiscal 1990 budget that seeks to curb Pentagon spending while
providing more for domestic programs.
   This included a commitment to spend $2.5 billion in a
government-industry project to find ways to reduce emissions that
cause acid rain.
   Bush also told Congress he would propose legislation for new
federal emission curbs, saying ``the time for study alone has
passed, and the time for action is now.''
   The pollution is caused when contaminants from coal-burning power
plants and other industrial plants are carried in the wind and mix
with the rain. The rainfall kills some wildlife and damages lakes,
forests and structures.
   As the two leaders had lunch, about three dozen demonstrators
stood outside in the snow, some carrying anti-American signs and
protesting the testing of U.S. warplanes in Canadian skies. ``George
Bush, enemy of the peoples of the world,'' one demonstrator yelled.
   Earlier, Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said the
president felt his address to Congress had been well-received.
   ``He was very pleased by the general reaction to it,'' including
the Democratic response, which Bush ``felt was very constructive,''
Fitzwater said. Fitzwater said Democrats appeared receptive to
Bush's proposal for early budget negotiations.
   ``The main thing is to sit down and start talking and see where
it goes,'' Fitzwater said.
   After leaving Canada, Bush planned to spend the weekend at his
family's seacoast retreat at Kennebunkport, Maine. No public events
were scheduled.
   On Monday, he makes a speech in Manchester, N.H., that aides said
would focus on his new budget.

   The European Economic Community this year is
expected to be the world's largest exporter of durum wheat used to
make pasta products, a trade usually dominated by the United States
and Canada, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   ``Because of this year's drought-induced short crop in North
America, the increase in (EEC) exports has been achieved somewhat
easily,'' the department's Foreign Agricultural Service said. ``But
if the U.S. and Canadian durum crops return to their normal size in
1989-90, the competition for export markets may become tighter.''
   The report said the EEC had a ``good harvest and unusually large
carry-in stocks'' of durum wheat this season.
   ``As in the past with a host of other commodities, the (EEC) has
responded by dumping its surplus on the world market through the use
of large export subsidies,'' the report said.

   Prime Minister-elect Michael Manley said
Friday he will visit Washington to establish the ``widest and most
constructive'' relationship possible with the Bush administration.
   He said he had met with U.S. Ambassador Michael G. Sotirhos about
the trip and wanted to make it as soon as possible. Manley, 64, led
a leftist Jamaican government in the 1970s that alarmed the United
States, but has moved toward the political center.
   Manley spoke to reporters and members of the Jamaican diplomatic
corps at a news conference the day after his general election
victory over conservative Prime Minister Edward Seaga, a staunch
U.S. ally.
   Unofficial results gave his People's National Party 44 seats in
Parliament to 16 for Seaga's Jamaica Labor Party. Manley led Seaga
in the popular vote 57 percent to 43.
   The Electoral Council was recounting some districts and stopped
releasing official tallies shortly before midnight Thursday, when
with 65 percent of the ballots counted Manley's party led Seaga's
with 429,680 votes to 324,486.
   Seaga had held all 60 parliamentary seats since 1983, when he
called an election after the U.S. invasion of Grenada and Manley
boycotted it in a dispute over voter registration.
   Thursday's results were in line with pre-election opinion polls,
despite widespread allegations of ballot-stuffing and voter
intimidation.
   In a conciliatory concession speech Thursday night, Seaga said
``The people have spoken and we abide by their decision,''
indicating he had no plan to challenge the results.
   Shootings and stabbings took 13 lives during the three-week
campaign period, including two on election day, but the scale of
violence was nothing like the mayhem of 1980. An estimated 700
people were killed in that nine-month campaign.
   ``I am very, very proud of my country to have made that much
progress,'' Manley said Friday. He noted the violence did not touch
Montego Bay and the other big tourist resorts along Jamaica's north
coast.
   Manley said his first priority at home would be to foster peace
between rival political groups and that church leaders had agreed to
hold an ecumenical ``service of national peace and unity'' Sunday,
the day before he is sworn in. Both he and Seaga are expected to
attend.
   Socialist policies Manley pursued in his first two terms as prime
minister, from 1972 to 1980, alienated foreign investors as well as
the United States. In recent years, however, he has moved from
radicalism to pro-U.S. ``social democracy.''
   Asked Friday to respond to skepticism about his more moderate
image, Manley said: ``What's my answer? What I say and what I do.''
   His previous administration taught him the damage confrontations
with the United States can cause, Manley said. ``The first thing we
learned was that getting into any kind of squabble doesn't help.''
   He repeated his pledge to restore diplomatic relations with
communist Cuba, which were broken by Seaga, but said it was ``not
top of the agenda.''
   While in Washington, Manley said, he wants to meet key figures in
the Bush administration, Congress and such major lending agencies
such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   Of his ``very specific objectives'' for the visit, ``the first is
to establish on the widest and most constructive possible basis the
relationship with the new administration of President Bush,'' he
said.
   Manley said he would consult with the Drug Enforcement
Administration to improve cooperation against the transit of
narcotics through Jamaica and will seek a bipartisan campaign
against drugs and guns on the island.
   Seaga, 58, was seeking an unprecedented third consecutive term.
He broke relations with Cuba upon taking office in 1980 and was an
outspoken supporter of the 1983 U.S. invasion of Grenada.
   To restore the economy, he instituted a series of austerity
measures, including higher taxes and a devaluation of the Jamaican
dollar, that cut deeply into the buying power of workers who already
were poorly paid.
   The campaign focused more on personalities than issues, with
Manley seen as a charismatic champion of the people and Seaga as
representing the interests of big business.
   On Friday, the prime minister-elect said his government would be
``genuinely willing to listen.'' He described Seaga's as
``essentially autocratic.''

<HEAD>Disintegrating Dogs, Early Retirements Are Signs of Soviet Pollution</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A lake in one Siberian city is so saturated with
toxic materials that stray dogs are regularly tossed into the water
to disintegrate.
   A chemical plant on the Volga River is so hazardous that
employees routinely take medical retirement at the age of 45.
   The rate of sickness from natural gas poisoning was so high in
one village that the entire town was moved away from a
gas-processing plant.
   Those environmental horror stories are just three of the items
that appeared Friday in Soviet newspapers, an indicatation not only
of the sorry state of the environment but the new aggressiveness the
media has acquired for environmental reporting.
   Such reporting is now sanctioned under the regime of President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev as good citizenship, rather than anti-Soviet
treachery.
   The newspaper Socialist Industry reported Friday that Moscow's
air contains double the allowable amount of hydrocarbons, and that
ceilings on nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide are exceeded by 30
percent.
   It said city water contains five to 20 times the permitted amount
of fertilizers and other toxic chemicals.
   The paper said Moscow already has moved 174 factories outside the
city limits in hopes of reducing its pollution problem. City fathers
had hoped to move 446 factories outside the city by 1990, but it now
appears that goal will not be reached until the year 2000, the
newspaper said.
   The entire village of Muzhichya Pavlovka has been moved away from
a local gas processing plant after 76 people suffered natural gas
poisoning in January, the newspaper Nedelya reported.
   Meanwhile, Pravda reported Friday that the Volga River city of
Chapaevsk is known locally as ``the city of young pensioners''
because the chemical factory there retires so many people when they
reach 45 to 50 years of age.
   In the Siberian city of Kemerovo, stray dogs that are not sent to
research laboratories or converted into fur boots and hats are
simply tossed into a lake filled with toxic phenols from a local
chemical plant, the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda reported.
   ``After several days, no trace is left,'' the newspaper reported.

   The sister of Terry Anderson prayed Friday
in one of the oldest churches in the world for the release of her
brother, an American hostage in Lebanon; for better U.S.-Syrian
relations and for peace in war-battered Lebanon.
   Peggy Say hung a barcelet engraved with her brother's name on a
cross on the altar of the Greek Catholic church of St. Sergius,
built about 300 years after the death of Jesus.
   With the local priest, Father Michael Zarura, Mrs. Say prayed
that her heart be healed after the captivity of her brother and the
death of her father and another brother, for ``the healing of
relationships between our countries and the hearts of the people in
Lebanon so they may live in peace.''
   Zarura prayed, ``here, in the oldest church in the world, that
your wishes come true and that Terry Anderson is in good health.''
   Anderson, 41, chief Middle East Correspondent for The Associated
Press, was seized by Shiite Moslem extremists on March 16, 1985.
   A native of Lorain, Ohio, Anderson is the longest-held of 15
foreign hostages in Lebanon. They are eight other Americans, three
Britons, an Irishman, an Italian and a Belgian.
   Mrs. Say is in Syria to meet Syrian officials who have been
cooperating in attempts to free the hostages.
   She came to this ancient Christian site at the suggestion of
Jodeph Atiyeh, 30, a Syrian-American of Baton Rouge, La. Atiyeh, a
1984 Olympic silver medalist in wrestling, works as an oil
consultant in Syria and the United States.
   Mrs. Say and Atiyeh met in the lobby of a Damascus Hotel.
   ``We came to pray for a miracle,'' Mrs. Say said after hearing
that Maaloula is the center of the last tiny region in the Middle
East where Aramaic, the language of Jesus, is spoken, and that it is
the site of reported miracles in the early history of the Christian
church.
   Mrs. Say and Atiyeh also prayed at the chapel marking the hiding
place of St. Takla, described as the first female Christian martyr
who was converted to Christianity by St. Paul.
   Miracles attributed to St. Takla include creation of a holy
spring near the chapel, carved out of a rock cliff.
   Sister Agatha Homsy, of the convent built around the chapel,
showed Mrs. Say and Atiyeh the spring where faithful may drink from
a metal cup.
   ``I'm a believer and I believe that water has some real bounce to
it,'' Atiyeh said after he and Mrs. Say drank.
   The Rev. Raymond Barnet, 52, a Protestant minister of Vancouver,
British Columbia, who is accompanying Mrs. Say, also prayed in the
chapel and asked for a miracle for the persecuted and for ``that
special miracle you alone can grant, freedom for Terry Anderson and
all the hostages.''
   Barnet's organization, Friends in the West, is active in seeking
the hostages' release.
   Syria is believed to have played a useful role in the release of
French and German hostages last year, acting as mediator among
countries with hostages in Lebanon, Iran, and pro-Iranian Moslem
groups holding captives.
   Syria has close relations with Iran and was its only major Arab
ally in the Iran-Iraq war. It has 40,000 peacekeeping troops in
Lebanon and is the major powerbroker there.
   Lebanon's main Shiite spiritual leader, Sheik Mohammed Mehdi
Shamseddin, was quoted in an interview published there Friday as
saying he was not hopeful for an early settlement of the hostage
issue because of ``new complications,'' which he declined to explain.
   The weekly magazine Ash-Shiraa quoted Shamseddin as calling on
``those capable of putting an end to this issue to do so because it
is a dark spot in our image.''

   The State Department on Friday congratulated
former Prime Minister Michael Manley on his party's victory in
Jamaica's national elections and expressed hope that his return to
power there will not mean a strain in U.S.-Jamaican relations.
   When Manley headed the government from 1972 to 1980, relations
with Washington soured partly because of Jamaica's close ties to
Cuba. But State Department spokesman Charles Redman noted that
Manley has said that in contrast to his earlier period in office, he
envisions no large Cuban presence or influence on the island.
   ``In our view, Cuba is more than ever an anachronism in a
hemisphere marked by a dramatic return to democracy in the 1980s,''
Redman said.
   ``We have talked about these things before, but Cuban repressive
practices at home and support for subversion and instability abroad
argue, in our view, against reintegration in the hemispheric
community,'' he added.
   A decade ago, the State Department was troubled by Manley's
radical rhetoric. During a 1979 visit to Cuba, he said that no
region in the world had suffered more from imperialist penetration
than the Caribbean had at the hands of the United States.
   Redman noted that Manley pledged during the election campaign to
pursue policies to promote Jamaica's continued economic development
in an atmosphere conducive to private sector activities and foreign
investment.
   ``Importantly, he has been clear and firm in stating his
determination to work vigorously to combat narcotics problems. He
has clearly stated he wants good relations with the United States
and we share that objective,'' Redman said.
   The United States was elated in 1980 when Manley was soundly
defeated by Prime Minister Edward Seaga and his Jamaica Labor Party.
   Seaga was elected just five days before Ronald Reagan won the
U.S. presidential election and close ties were forged quickly after
Reagan's inaugural. Seaga was one of Reagan's first foreign visitors
and he cooperated closely with the United States in the 1983
invasion of Grenada in which Jamaica joined the United States and
several other Caribbean countries in toppling the leftist regime
there.
   The Reagan administration embraced Seaga as an avowedly
anti-communist democrat who espoused free enterprise principles. It
hoped that Jamaica would emerge as a model of capitalist development
in the Third World.
   But officials said that Seaga's free enterprise policies did not
match his rhetoric, and there was open disappointment here over the
performance of the Jamaican economy, a situation which was greatly
aggravated by a disastrous hurricane last fall.

   Swap Hostages, Slain Druse Buried, Clashes in East Beirut
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Rival Shiite Moslem militias on Friday
exchanged 46 hostages who were captured during factional warfare
last month.
   The trade by the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the
mainstream militia Amal, which Syria supports, was part of a peace
agreement made Jan. 29.
   Syria and Iran mediated the accord, which halted eight months of
intermittent warfare that killed 500 people and wounded 1,500
wounded in Beirut and south Lebanon. The two militias are vying for
supremacy among 1 million Shiites, Lebanon's largest sect.
   Amal freed 33 detainees in Zefta, its security headquarters eight
miles southeast of Sidon in the south. Hezbollah released 13 Amal
fighters at Ein Bouswar, a few miles south of Sidon, police said.
   Police also said Friday that eight people described as civilians
were killed by sniper fire across Beirut's sectarian dividing line
in 10 days, six in Moslem districts and two on the Christian side of
the no-man's-land that cuts the city into Christian and Moslem
sectors.
   Meanwhile, a Shiite official said the International Committee of
the Red Cross had offered to arrange a trade of Lebanese held by
Israel for an Israeli airman captured in south Lebanon more than a
year ago.
   ``The ICRC has asked us to release the Israeli airman so that all
the Lebanese held in the prisons of Israel and its allies be
released,'' said Abdul Amir Qabalan, a Shiite religious judge.
   Qabalan spoke at a rally of about 10,000 people in Deir Qanoun
village, near Tyre in south Lebanon, organized by the Amal militia
to honor members killed fighting Israel.
   Hundreds of Lebanese are believed held in Israel's
self-proclaimed ``security zone'' just inside south Lebanon, which
is patrolled by Israeli soldiers and an allied militia.
   Navigator Ron Arad's plane crashed in south Lebanon while on a
bombing mission Oct. 16, 1986, and Amal said it captured him.
   Red Cross officials could not be reached for comment on Qabalan's
remarks.

   A prominent investigating magistrate died
Friday of gunshot wounds suffered in a terrorist attack a month ago.
   Constantine Androulidakis, 52, who had been in a coma for 24
hours, died Friday morning, Evangelismos Hospital said.
   Androulidakis was shot at least three times as he prepared to
drive to work Jan. 10, and witnesses said three men fled in a car.
November 17, the most notorious terrorist group in Greece, claimed
responsibility.
   He was one of two magistrates November 17 claimed to have shot in
an attempt to intimidate the judiciary for its alleged involvement
in the acquittal of two businessmen charged with fraud in the early
1980s.
   Pnayiotis Tarasouleas, 66, a Supreme Court prosecutor, was
wounded by a lone gunman Jan. 18 and hospitalized for several days.
   The terrorist group has claimed 12 killings since it emerged in
1975 with the assassination of Richard Welch, CIA station chief in
Greece.
   It also took responsibility for the slayings of two other senior
U.S. Embassy officials and several Greek businessmen, publishers and
police officers. None of its members has ever been arrested.
   November 17 takes its name from the date of a 1973 uprising
against the military dictatorship then in power by students at the
Athens Polytechnic Institute. The uprising was crushed by soldiers
with tanks.
   Another terrorist group, May 1, claimed responsibility for
assassinating magistrate Anastasios Bernardis on Jan. 23. Pamphlets
scattered near the scene accused him of ``covering up the crimes of
capitalists and crooked unionists.''
   The group first became known in 1987, when it claimed
responsibility for wounding labor leader Giorgos Raftopoulos.

<HEAD>Ex-Mossad Chief Says French Plotters Asked Help To Kill de Gaulle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS MEIXLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former head of Israel's intelligence agency
said Friday that rebellious French officers asked Israel to aid in a
plot to assassinate President Charles de Gaulle of France in 1961.
   Israel instead informed de Gaulle, leading to the arrest of the
plotters, Isser Harel said on Israel TV. Harel directed the Mossad
from 1952-63.
   Maurice Schumann, a former French official who worked closely
with de Gaulle, said it was ``simply preposterous'' for Israel to
claim any role in uncovering the plot.
   The plotters reportedly were out to kill de Gaulle because he
agreed to allow self-determination for Algeria, then considered an
integral part of France. Algeria became an independent North African
republic in 1962.
   De Gaulle, president from 1959 to 1969, died in 1970.
   The Yediot Ahronot newspaper said Israel's knowledge of the plot
began when a French officer met with Yitzhak Braun, Israel's
military attache in Paris, and promised increased military aid in
return for help in killing de Gaulle.
   The Hebrew daily was quoting Harel's new book, ``Security and
Democracy,'' which was released in Israel this week.
   Yediot said Braun informed the late Foreign Minister Golda Meir
of the plot and she asked Harel for advice.
   ``When I heard of this I said there were two reasons to
immediately warn de Gaulle,'' Harel said on television.
   ``First, if there really was a plot to kill de Gaulle and we knew
of it and didn't do anything, we would be accomplices to the
assassination of a world leader and a friend of Israel.
   ``Second, there were people in France who were saying that there
were groups in the security services who were friends of the Ultras,
the groups that favored a French Algeria.
   ``So I said (to Mrs. Meir), maybe they (the French) are trying to
test us,'' Harel added.
   He said he immediately called a meeting with Army Chief-of-Staff
Zvi Tzur and Deputy Defense Minister Shimon Peres to see if they
knew of the threat.
   ``They knew, but they thought we should not become involved,''
Harel said.
   Concerned that the plot would succeed, he turned to Prime Minster
David Ben-Gurion for advice.
   ``Don't waste a minute, warn de Gaulle immediately,'' Harel
recalls Ben-Gurion as saying.
   Harel said de Gaulle foiled the plot and that the officers
involved, whom he refused to name, were arrested. Some were
executed, he said.
   A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry, speaking on
condition of anonymity in keeping with government policy, said
allegations in Harel's book are ``a matter of history now. We don't
have any comment.''
   Schumann, then chairman of the French National Assembly's Foreign
Affairs Committee, said de Gaulle never mentioned any Israeli
tip-off in the episode.
   ``He would certainly have referred to it if there had been any
foundation to it,'' Schumann told The Associated Press.
   Yediot quoted Tzur as saying he didn't recall the incident but
adding: ``Harel is apparently basing what he says on documents, and
I have no reason to doubt it is true.''
   Yediot said Peres, who is now finance minister, denied it ever
happened. ``It never occurred,'' it quoted him as saying.

   Workers have cleaned up most of the oil
spilled into Antarctic waters from a sunken Argentine ship, but the
accident wiped out a colony of baby birds that scientists were
studying, officials said Friday.
   Lt. Jose Araya of the Chilean navy said the oil leak from the
ship was stopped after divers patched the damaged hull of the
vessel, the Bahia Paraiso.
   But a National Science Foundation official at the Palmer Station,
a U.S. Antarctic research facility near where the ship ran aground
on Jan. 28, said the oil that spill from the vessel has wiped out a
colony of skua chicks.
   Bernhard Lettau, program manager for polar ocean sciences for the
foundation, said the oil killed all but six chicks in a rookery of
53 nests. The skua is a predator bird related to the seagull.
   ``In another two days, we expect the remaining chicks also to be
dead,'' Lettau said by conference call to reporters in Washington.
   The deaths of the birds means that no chicks will be produced
this year from a rookery that American scientists have studied for
years on the Antarctic peninsula, about 600 miles from the tip of
South America.
   Lettau also said two seals examined seemed to be having
difficulty breathing, some dead gulls were found and mortality has
been ``very high'' among limpids and sponges living near beaches
touched by the fuel oil.
   American scientists are still evaluating the oil spill and ``the
total effect is not yet known,'' he said.
   Thomas Forehand, ocean project manager for the National Science
Foundation, said it is doubtful that the Argentine vessel can be
refloated because its damage is so great. It is hoped that it can be
it cut apart and removed, he said.
   Officials are worried about removing the remaining fuel oil and
drums of gasoline from the the vessel without creating another spill.
   The United States, Argentina and Chile have been working to clean
up the wreckage, the first real environmental threat to the
untouched Antarctic.
   Araya said a special skimming boat from the United States has
cleaned up most of the oil slick. Asked in a telephone interview
whether the problem is considered under control, Araya replied, ``I
would say so.''
   Araya said the skimming boat had cleaned up Palmer Bay two miles
from the ship. The skimming craft was being used Friday inside a
ring of floating booms set up around the ship to contain the leak.
   The emergency craft is supported by the Polar Duke, a National
Science Foundation vessel that traveled to the spill carrying 52
tons of cleanup equipment.

<HEAD>Guerrilla Election Proposal Falters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prospects for agreement on a
guerrilla proposal to postpone elections vanished Thursday when the
government and armed forces hardened their positions and political
parties failed to agree on a response.
   The proposal has been the subject of intense debate since the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front made it on Jan. 24.
   The rebels offered to take part in elections if voting was
postponed from March 19 until September. It represented a dramatic
turnaround. The rebels had boycotted and condemned as a sham five
previous national elections this decade.
   The leftist rebels have been fighting since 1980 to overthrow the
U.S.-backed government.
   The government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte initially
dismissed the rebel overture as insincere, then retreated somewhat
and left resolution of the matter up to political parties running in
the election.
   Speaking to journalists Thursday, Duarte criticized the
suggestion that all candidates withdraw so no election could be
held. Some sectors had advanced this as one way to postpone the
election without violating the constitution.
   ``We cannot use a subterfuge as a pretext for solution. What must
be sought is a true peace that will not lead us anew into
confrontation and war,'' Duarte said.
   Col. Emilio Ponce, chief of the joint chiefs of staff, said
rejection of the guerrilla proposal would strengthen Salvadoran
democracy. In a speech to the American-Salvadoran Chamber of
Commerce, Ponce likened the rebel initiative to a man bullying his
way into a poker game with a pistol, his own deck and his own dealer
_ ``who deals him a straight flush. Of course he wins.''
   He said rejection was advisable even though the government could
be perceived overseas as intransigent.
   On Tuesday, Defense Minister Gen. Carlos Vides Casanova said the
rebel proposal ``rather than bringing peace ... would aggravate
conditions.'' Vides said the armed forces consider the proposal a
strategy to foment insurrection.
   Representatives of all main political parties have been meeting
throughout the week trying to forge a consensus response to the
guerrilla document, with no sign of a breakthrough.
   The Marxist-led insurgents said they would participate in the
election and respect its outcome if it were postponed for six months
and other conditions were met dealing with security and fraud
prevention. Meeting the conditions would require constitutional
changes.
   The rebels said on their clandestine radio Wednesday that
response has been ``dilatory and irresponsible ... all we have seen
are inconsistencies, lack of will and indisposition to consensus.''
   The rebels insist that the army be confined to barracks for
election day, the point considered most objectionable by the armed
forces.
   On Thursday two rebel commanders, Shafik Handal and Roberto Roca,
sent a letter to the major political parties saying they were
willing to travel to San Salvador to discuss the election proposal
with legislators.
   ``If the Assembly invites them, we (the armed forces) will go
along, even though we don't like it,'' said Ponce.
   Sources participating in the politicians' meetings said the
rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, remained adamant
that the election should not be postponed.
   Arena, which trounced Duarte's Christian Democrats in legislative
and municipal elections last March, is favored to win the
presidential ballot and Arena leaders have said postponement can
only hurt their prospects.

   President Bush said Friday it's too
early to recommend a new package of pay raises for Congress, judges
and federal executives, saying he wants to ``let the dust settle''
on the explosive issue.
   Answering questions from reporters aboard Air Force One en route
to his vacation retreat, Bush bemoaned the refusal of the House and
Senate this week to approve 51 percent pay raises for themselves and
for top figures in the other two branches of government.
   The president reiterated his statement of Wednesday, saying
signed legislation rejecting the pay raises because he respected the
sentiment of the members of the House and Senate. The pay raise was
overwhelmingly turned down in both chambers.
   ``All I can do is make recommendations to the Congress about the
future legislation,'' Bush said. ``Having talked to some of the
leaders up there, I'm not sure the timing is right for that.''
   He said there has been ``a lot of wounds, a lot of hemorrhaging
up there. And I don't want to do something that'll look like I am
simply trying to step into the breach and raise a problem that has
caused a great deal of divisiveness in the Capitol.''
   Bush had said all along that he supported the substantial pay
raises for members of Congress, which would have elevated their
salaries from $89,500 to $135,000 a year, and he repeated that
Friday.
   ``When I signed that bill (rejecting the raise), I made a comment
about my feeling that the judicial salaries should go up. I am on
record as favoring an increase for members of Congress and senior
executives,'' he said.
   ``We've got to do something,'' the president said, signaling out
the National Institutes of Health as an example of a federal agency
that likely would suffer a loss of talent under existing pay scales
for top federal executives.
   ``But now,'' he said, ``I've got to rely on my people here to
make a recommendation to me, when I can be effective for the changes
that I think are overdue.''
   ``But what you don't want to do is come in and, when the wounded
are still lying on the battlefield, start fighting another battle,''
Bush said.
   ``Let's take a little time,'' he added. ``If I felt that a
specific recommendation out of the president right now ... would
have the effect of achieving what I've just spelled out ... I'd do
forward right now.''

   The government envisions a future
political structure in which it will not matter whether the
president is black or white, a Cabinet minister said Friday.
   ``A new constitution needs to be negotiated, and ... the head of
the state or of the government needs to be redefined,'' Information
Minister Stoffel van der Merwe said at a news briefing.
   ``The ideal situation would be to create such a system where it
becomes immaterial what color the occupants of the positions are.''
   A few years ago, Foreign Minister Pik Botha was severely
reprimanded by President P.W. Botha after suggesting to foreign
reporters that South Africa might someday have a black president.
   Van der Merwe was assessing the opening week of the 1989
parliamentary session, in which National Party leaders gave broad
outlines of the type of future government they would like to see.
   Pro-government media have depicted the speeches as representing a
dramatic shift away from racially based politics and a repudiation
of white-minority domination.
   But the government's liberal critics question whether the
rhetoric will be matched by action and note that no government
leaders have offered to give the black majority full voting rights.
   President P.W. Botha, who resigned as National Party leader last
week, is recovering from a stroke and has appointed a Cabinet
minister, Chris Heunis, as acting president. Another Cabinet
minister, F.W. de Klerk, was elected new leader of the party.
   ``We have to go through a very fundamental process of considering
how the government of the country should be structured,'' van der
Merwe said. ``But the power distribution should be such that it will
not matter what the color or origin of a particular incumbent is,
especially when one comes to the more symbolic positions.''
   Earlier Friday, Education Minister Gerrit Viljoen told reporters
that the black education system, for many years kept substandard by
law, is now capable of producing a future black president. He would
not comment further.
   De Klerk and Heunis have indicated they are rethinking
fundamental principles that have guided the National Party for 40
years, such as the strict allocation of political rights, housing
and education along racial lines.
   Van der Merwe said the party has embarked on a process of
long-term change, ``but regarding things that can be changed
unilaterally, we have proceeded almost as far as we can go.''
   He said the government wanted to negotiate with leaders of other
race groups before suggesting alternatives to key apartheid laws
such as the Group Areas Act, which mandates segregation of
residential areas.
   Heunis and de Klerk have depicted a future South Africa in which
some people live in a multiracial society while others who wish to
preserve segregation are allowed to do so on a local basis.

   Tens of thousands of Iranians chanted
``Allahu Akbar!'' _ God is Great! _ from rooftops and fireworks
burst over the city Friday night to honor the Islamic revolution's
10th anniversary.
   Officials said the celebrations were repeated in cities and towns
across the country as 10 days of celebrations moved toward their
climax Saturday, Feb. 11, the date in 1979 on which the
2,500-year-old Persian monarchy fell.
   Millions of Iranians were expected to brave icy winter winds
sweeping down from the snow-covered Alborz Mountains to attend a
huge rally in Tehran's Azadi Square on Saturday.
   Anniversary celebrations began Feb. 1, the date a decade ago on
which Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned to Iran in triumph from
15 years of exile.
   The 88-year-old revolutionary patriarch was not expected to
attend the Azadi Square rally because of frail health. He rarely
leaves his residence in the north Tehran suburb of Jamaran.
   This year's anniversary is more festive than previous ones, when
Iran was locked in a long and costly war with Iraq.
   Fighting was halted Aug. 20, after eight years, by a cease-fire
sponsored by the United Nations.
   Friday night's rituals in praise of God were decreed by the
government to begin at 8 p.m. and last 10 minutes. Voices of men
mingled with the lighter tones of women and children.
   Fireworks illuminated the sky over the sprawling city of 10
million people. Traffic stopped in many streets and people emerged
from cars and buses to stand on the snowy pavements and join the
chant of ``Allahu Akbar!''
   Ayatollah Musavi Ardebili, the nation's chief justice, urged all
Iranians during Friday prayers at Tehran University to attend
rallies Saturday and ``demonstrate our faith in the revolution.''
   Tehran's wide avenues were festooned with thousands of slogans
praising Khomeini's leadership and denouncing the United States and
Israel.
   Posters of Khomeini and revolutionary slogans hung from every
lamppost, and arches of myrtle leaves were erected in the streets.
Many building facades were covered by huge slogans or
larger-than-life portraits of Khomeini.
   This year's celebrations take place in a climate of increasing
public dicussion and official criticism of the shortcomings of the
revolution and the clergy-dominated government.
   Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, Khomeini's designated successor,
said in an interview this week with the newspaper Abrar:
   ``Unfortunately, instead of safeguarding the values of the
revolution we shouted slogans. Instead of keeping the people
involved, we isolated the intelligent and active forces, making them
more and more disgruntled.
   ``The biggest blow against the revolution was inflicted by wrong
management methods, excessive zeal, power in wrong hands,
factionalism and the disregard of true revolutionary values.
   ``We must avoid allowing a certain group to monopolize the
revolution and must value the ideas of all those individuals and
groups who believe in the revolution, the country and the
leadership.''

<TEXT>
   The top diplomats from Iran and Iraq met
face-to-face on Friday and agreed to hold talks next month in New
York in an effort to revive their deadlocked peace negotiations.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar mediated the
meeting between Foreign Minister Tariz Aziz of Iraq and Foreign
Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and their aides in a basement conference
room at U.N. Headquarters.
   ``It was a short meeting in which I found real cooperation with
both foreign ministers,'' the U.N. chief said after the 90-minute
meeting.
   He said Aziz and Velayati agreed to hold more substantive direct
meetings in New York in late March. The talks are to be preceded by
discussions this month between U.N. officials and representatives of
both countries.
   ``The idea is to give a new impetus to the peace process,'' Perez
de Cuellar said.
   Velayati said of Friday's session: ``We have only had procedural
talks.''
   But he said Iran still maintains that the next step of the peace
process should be an immediate withdrawal of forces to the prewar
boundaries of both countries.
   Iraq still occupies 260 square miles of Iranian territory it
seized during the 8-year-old war with Iran.
   This week, Aziz released a letter to Perez de Cuellar insisting
that Iran must first relinquish its right to search ships in the
Persian Gulf for Iraq-bound war cargo.
   Aziz also said Iran should show it sincerely wants peace by
agreeing to cooperate with a U.N. plan to dredge the Shatt al-Arab
waterway that forms the southern border between their nations.
   The waterway, which is blocked by silt and sunken ships, is
Iraq's outlet to international waters.
   Aziz left without offering any substantial comments.
   Velayati and Aziz seemed more comfortable this week than they had
in previous negotiating sessions held in Geneva and New York.
   On Wednesday, the Security Council unanimously called on Iran and
Iraq to stop stalling on implementing the U.N.'s peace plan.
   The demand coincided with a remarkable series of disclosures in
the Iranian media, in which Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani
said Tehran had overreached its grasp during the nearly eight-year
war.
   ``We took too big a bite,'' Rafsanjani was quoted as telling the
official Islamic Republic News Agency.
   ``Yes, we wanted something, but were not able to get it, and that
was military victory. If we had moved with a bit more planning maybe
it would not have been so far off,'' said Iran's Parliament speaker.
   Iraq had accepted a U.N. call for a cease-fire in 1987, but Iran
did not agree to the truce until July after suffering humiliating
defeats during an Iraqi advance on the battlefield.
   Since the cease-fire took effect Aug. 20, Iraq has often accused
Iran of seeking the truce only to halt its military losses.
   Peace talks that opened five days later in Geneva immediately
deadlocked.
   Iran says the cease-fire is in effect, and the rest of the U.N.
peace plan should be implemented. The peace plan calls for
withdrawing armies to the border, exchanging prisoners of war, and
negotiating a settlement to the conflict.
   Baghdad, however, says the cease-fire is not legally in place
because Iran has not relinquished its right to search ships in
international waters of the gulf for war cargo bound for Iraq.
   Both sides have shown flexibility in recent weeks over secondary
measures. Iran pledged to drain an artificial lake it built between
the opposing forces in the southern front near the Shatt.
   Iraq suspended a warning to civilian air traffic not to fly into
Iran. That ban had previously forced Iran-bound flights to detour
north through Turkey.
   Baghdad and Tehran have agreed to set up a joint commission of
military officers to discuss complaints of cease-fire violations
along their 730-mile front line.
   The joint commission will be led by officers of the U.N.
Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group, which monitors the truce.
   Both sides have released small groups of sick and injured
prisoners of war, which raised hopes that the International
Committee of the Red Cross might be able to register and repatriate
about 100,000 POWs held by both sides.

   Lawyers for Ferdinand Marcos asked a federal
judge Friday to remove the deposed Philippines president from a
racketeering case because of his health problems.
   U.S. prosecutors opposed the move, saying it was too soon to make
a final prognosis of the 71-year-old Marcos' chances for recovery
from pneumonia and other respiratory ailments.
   U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan reserved decision.
   Marcos has been hospitalized for nearly a month at St. Francis
Medical Center in Honolulu for pneumonia and bronchial asthma. He
suffered a collapsed lung Jan. 19 while at the hospital, but it was
reinflated. A spokesman listed him as in guarded condition Friday.
   In another development, a senior adviser to Philippines President
Corazon Aquino confirmed that he met in San Francisco with ``some
supposed representatives of Marcos'' earlier this week, but said he
ended the talk after learning they were not authorized to speak for
the Marcos family.
   ``I am not in the habit of talking uselessly about these
things,'' the official, Mateo Caparas, told reporters outside
Keenan's courtroom.
   Caparas, head of the Philippines' Presidential Commission on Good
Government, said he was asked to the meeting by Marcos' lawyers. He
said he had no authorization from Mrs. Aquino to talk with Marcos.
   Earlier, before Keenan, Marcos attorney Richard A. Hibey asked
the judge to sever Marcos from the case with a review of his health
status at a later date.
   The request, if granted, would not dismiss the charges against
the ailing former president but only separate his case from the
other defendants, including his wife, Imelda, 59, and Saudi Arabian
financier Adnan Khashoggi.
   The Marcoses and others are charged with a racketeering scheme
that allegedly looted $103 million from the Philippines and funneled
it through foreign bank accounts to buy New York real estate and
artworks.
   The Marcoses have lived in exile in Hawaii since fleeing Manila
in February 1986.
   A Feb. 4 report by Marcos's physician Dr. Claver P. Ramos,
submitted to the court by Hibey, said the former president was in
critical condition at St. Francis and required a respirator.
   ``I don't see that the U.S. courts are about the business of
visiting their jurisdiction on someone who is in this condition,''
Hibey told Keenan.
   When Keenan asked Hibey about news reports that Marcos was trying
to negotiate a settlement with the Philippines government, the
lawyer said: ``There have been conversations. There have not been
negotiations.''
   Hibey added: ``It is clear we have communicated to the Philippine
government the desire of the Marcos family that Mr. Marcos be
allowed to return to the Philippines to die. His condition is in
extremis.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella insisted that it was too
soon to make final determination of whether Marcos's health problems
precluded him from standing trial.
   ``I think it's much more prudent to wait three months to assess
Mr. Marcos's condition,'' said the prosecutor, adding, ``either he's
going to recover or he's not.''
   A continuation of a hearing by Keenan to determine if Marcos is
well enough to be arraigned in Honolulu is scheduled for March 6.

   President Daniel Ortega has raised the
possibility of early elections, electoral reform and amnesty for
political prisoners, the official Sandinista party newspaper
Barricada said Friday.
   It quoted an opposition leader, Isidro Tellez of the
Marxist-Leninist Party, as saying Ortega made those points at a
meeting with members of the opposition.
   According to Barricada, Tellez quoted Ortega as saying he would
bring it up at the Central American summit that starts Monday.
   The reported offer would move toward compliance with a dormant
Central American peace plan that the Central American presidents are
trying to revive.
   Ortega has been meeting with Tellez and other political foes to
seek broad support for tough austerity measures Nicaragua needs to
save itself from economic disaster.
   ``Tellez ... revealed that President Ortega has stated the
viability of an immediate amnesty for all the former Somocista
guards and even the possibility of early elections,'' Barricada
reported. Elections are now scheduled for November 1990.
   The leftist Sandinistas came to power in 1979 in a popular
revolution that ousted dictator Anastasio Somoza. The government
said on Dec. 10 that it still had 1,744 former members of Somoza's
National Guard in custody and that it had an additional 1,398
members of the anti-Sandinista rebel movement in jail.
   Tellez quoted Ortega as saying amnesty for the U.S.-backed
rebels, known as Contras, would hinge on whether thousands of
Contras still based on the Nicaraguan border in Honduras would lay
down their arms, Barricada reported.
   The U.S. Congress cut off military aid to the Contras in February
1988. A month later the Sandinistas and Contras signed a cease-fire
agreement. The level of fighting in Nicaragua has dropped sharply
since then, although some still occurs.
   Four rebels were killed and two were injured in fighting in the
northern province of Matagalpa on Thursday, a Sandinista military
spokesman said. He said no Sandinista soldiers were hurt.
   Ortega and the presidents of El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and
Costa Rica are to meet in El Salvador on Monday.
   The foreign ministers of the five nations asked the United
Nations on Wednesday to send a multinational force of inspectors to
Central America to verify that no country supports subversion
against its neighbors.

<HEAD>Soviet Activist Sakharov Asks Recognition of Ukrainian Catholics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SIENA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andrei Sakharov assailed the Soviet
government on Thursday for refusing to recognize Ukrainian Catholics
and urged other Catholics to campaign on behalf of the outlawed
church.
   Sakharov, a founder of the Soviet human rights movement and a
nuclear physicist, told a group of Siena residents at the northern
city's university campus he wanted to point out the ``problem of the
Ukrainian Catholic Church.''
   ``There is an absolutely anomalous situation in which a whole
church, with a great number of faithful, finds itself in a situation
of illegality and clandestineness,'' he said.
   ``I think Italian Catholics should use all the influence they can
so that this situation is normalized,'' he added to a burst of
applause.
   Sakharov, first expressed public support last summer for the
Ukrainian Catholic Church.
   His statements Thursday appeared to be his strongest about the
estimated 4 million Ukrainian Catholics, who make up the largest
underground church in the officially atheist Soviet Union.
   The remarks were especially significant coming in the same week
Sakharov met Pope John Paul II and Cardinal Myroslav Ivan
Lubachivsky, the Rome-based leader of Ukrainian Catholics.
   Sakharov, 67, is on a five-day visit to Italy, his second trip
abroad since being freed in December 1986 from nearly seven years of
internal exile.
   His wife, human rights campaigner Yelena Bonner, accompanied him
here. She has been treated several times at the University of Siena
opthalmological clinic for glaucoma. Her doctor, Renato Frezzotti,
said after a check-up Thursday that she appeared to have been cured
of the disease.
   On the trip Sakharov has spoken out on behalf of persecuted
minorities, focusing on ethnic Armenians in the Soviet Union.
   The winner of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded a gold
doctoral ring by the University of Siena for his defense of human
rights.
   Sakharov beamed and waved his hand in the air to show off the
ring.
   In his speech, he praised the restructuring policies of President
Mikhail Gorbachev, but he said the Soviet government had not made
enough progress in liberalizing the economy and introducing greater
democracy.
   Later, at a question-and-answer session, Sakharov said in part
while replying to a question about religious liberty under Gorbachev:
   ``Unfortunately I must say that there are members of the
religious hierarchy who in the past didn't always behave as they
should have, they chose compromises and accords that perhaps weren't
justified.''
   He did not elaborate, but appeared to be criticizing the Russian
Orthodox Church, which has been closely aligned with the communist
government.
   Dictator Josef Stalin suppressed the Ukrainian Catholic Church in
1946 and ordered it to merge with the Russian Orthodox Church. Many
Catholics refused and the church went underground.
   Sakharov said he hoped that in formulating a new law about
religion, the government would take into account ``the opinion of
churches outside the boundaries of the Soviet Union, and the desires
of believers.''
   Sakharov, who helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb, was barred
from leaving the Soviet Union for years because the government
claimed he knew state secrets from his scientific work. His standing
has improved dramatically since his release from exile and he is a
candidate in nationwide parliamentary elections scheduled for March.

<HEAD>Fair and Warm Weather Over Much of Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Much of the nation warmed up Friday after a week of record cold
and California mountain towns dug out of a snowstorm that held up
even the mailman. Brownsville, Texas, recorded temperatures above 60
degrees for the first time in six days, the second longest below-60
stretch since records began there in 1878.
   Temperatures rose to the 40s and 50s across much of the central
and southern Plains, southwest Louisiana, northern Florida, the
southern Rockies, southern California and the central Pacific coast.
   Temperatures were in the 20s and 30s in a band across the
northern United States, from the Pacific Northwest to much of the
northern Atlantic coast.
   But cold, still air caused some of Idaho's southwestern and
northern valleys to fill with smoke from wood stoves, and a
mandatory burning ban was issued.
   Freezing rain fell over portions of western Oregon, making
driving treacherous Friday morning. Foggy conditions covered much of
California.
   The warmer weather allowed Interstate 5 in California to open
after a two-day shutdown that blocked hundreds of cars and trucks on
each side of the 4,100-foot Tejon Pass through the Tehachapi and San
Gabriel mountains.
   The steep mountain highway was made impassable by ice and snow.
   ``Snow, snow and more snow,'' said Mildred Church, 66, who called
it the biggest storm in 27 years at the mountain hamlet of Frazier
Park. ``It's 5 foot deep.''
   The town and other communities atop the mountains next to Tejon
Pass were snowed in Wednesday and Thursday. Even the mail couldn't
go through until Friday. The mail truck from Bakersfield was stuck
at the bottom of the mountain.
   At Big Bear Lake in the San Bernardino Mountains, 18,000 water
customers were ordered not to use water unless absolutely necessary
because numerous burst pipes were draining supplies from storage
tanks.
   Early Friday, Oakland, Calif., had a low of 38, a record for the
date. Alameda, Calif., recorded a reading of 41, also a record low.
   Scattered snow showers were over portions of the Intermountain
region.
   The flow of cold air over the warmer waters of the lower Great
Lakes continued to produce lake effect snow.
   Overnight snowfall at South Bend, Ind., was from 1 to 2 inches,
and 2 to 4 inches fell over southwest lower Michigan.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from zero
degrees at Helena, Mont., to 77 degrees at Homestead, Fla., Air
Force base and Miami, Fla.
   The low in the nation Friday morning was 11 degrees below zero at
Helena, St. Johnsbury, Vt., and Newport, Vt.
   The forecast for Saturday was for rain showers widely scattered
from northern Mississippi across middle Tennessee to the upper Ohio
Valley. Snow was to continue across the lower Great Lakes and
northern New England. Snow also was expected over the Colorado
Rockies and northeast Minnesota.
   High temperatures were to be in teens over northeast Minnesota,
upper Michigan, northern Wisconsin and northern Maine; in the 20s
and 30s from the northern and central Intermountain region, the
northern and central Rockies, the northern and central Plains, much
of the middle and upper Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes to
the northern Atlantic coast; in the 40s and 50s from the northern
and central Pacific coast across northern portions of the Southern
plateau, the Texas Panhandle, Oklahoma, Arkansas and the Tennessee
Valley to the middle Atlantic coast and the Carolinas; and in the
60s and 70s from southern California across southern Arizona and New
Mexico, the southern two-thirds of Texas and the Gulf Coast region
to Florida and the southern Georgia coast.

   Vice President Dan Quayle criticized
Israel before an American Jewish group Friday for a ``clearly
unacceptable'' record of civilian killings in the West Bank and Gaza
strip, even as he pledged a strengthened U.S.-Israeli alliance under
the Bush administration.
   Quayle said that despite Israel's ``current difficulties and
turmoil,'' the last eight years have been good for that alliance.
   Speaking to a conference of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith, Quayle said the United States must not be in a position of
pressuring Israel, its longtime strategic and diplomatic ally, to
accept a ``pre-cooked'' solution on peace with its neighbors.
   But his comments also reinforced a recent State Department report
that criticized the civilian killings by Israeli military forces.
   Friction involving Palestinians living in the Israeli-controlled
regions ``has resulted in nearly 400 Palestinians killed, and many
more injured,'' Quayle said. ``Some may say that by the grisly
standards of some of Israel's neighbors, a few hundred people killed
in the course of a yearlong uprising is not a very staggering
figure.''
   But Israel should be judged not by those standards but by those
of ``the democratic West,'' he said. ``And on the basis of these
standards, the status quo on the West Bank and Gaza Strip is clearly
unacceptable.''
   Later, in a speech to the Cuban American Bar Association, Quayle
urged improved human rights in Latin American countries. Quayle
cited a human rights lecture he delivered last Friday to military
forces of the U.S.-backed El Salvador government.
   ``I believe I succeeded in getting my message across,'' Quayle
said. He said he told them ``about commitment to the rule of law and
human rights, two crucial areas in which they must do better.''
   While State Department statistics show that political murders
have declined from a high of 750 per month there in 1980 to 18 per
month in 1988, Quayle said that figure ``is still unacceptable.''
   He contended, however, that the worst violators of human rights
in El Salvador are the leftist guerrillas trying to overthrow the
democratic government.
   Quayle said Cuba, Nicaragua and Panama represent tyrannical Latin
governments that are ``desperately holding out against a democratic
tidal wave that is rising every higher.''
   The State Department's recent report on human rights worldwide
singled out Israel's military forces for excessively harsh measures
against Palestinian civilians.
   Quayle called for ``mutual restraint'' in the Middle East, and
said the Bush administration ``will continue to advance the cause of
human rights around the world. And we will continue to strengthen
and deepen our strategic alliance with israel.''
   Questioned by reporters, Quayle was reluctant to go further in
criticizing Israel, saying only that Israel is having some ``tough
times'' and that the government is ``trying to do a better job.''
   He told the Anti-Defamation League that the first-ever talks
between representatives of the United States and the Palestine
Liberation Organization do not indicate any fundamental change in
attitude toward the PLO or its leader, Yasser Arafat.
   ``Simple prudence obliges us to monitor Mr. Arafat and his
organization very carefully, and to probe his words very closely
before arriving at a final determination,'' Quayle said
   Quayle said that while Arafat has stated recognition of the state
of Israel and has renounced terrorism, some PLO factions hold
opposing viewpoints.
   In Miami, Quayle visited an inner city merit school, Charles Drew
Elementary School, where school test scores and achievement rank
among the highest in the nation. The vice president praised the
students' success and their voluntary attendance at school on
Saturdays.
   The school is located near the neighborhood where racial violence
and looting erupted last month, sparked by the shooting of a black
man by a police officer.
   At the school about two dozen protesters waved signs reading ``We
want justice now,'' and another small group carried signs reading,
``Deport all illegals now.''
   Quayle offered no solution to what the Bush administration will
do to help Florida cope with the massive influx of Latin refugees,
particularly from Nicaragua. But he criticized Nicaragua's
Sandinista government as the cause of the problem, saying the
refugees left because their freedoms were repressed by the leftist
government.

   Doctors prepared to perform an abortion on a
comatose woman after the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday rejected
efforts by two anti-abortion activists to stop her husband from
authorizing the procedure.
   ``Tough battle but we won it,'' said the husband, Martin Klein.
``We can now turn our attention to trying to help Nancy. Justice has
been done.''
   The abortion opponents waged a two-week legal fight to prevent
Klein from becoming his wife's guardian to authorize an abortion
that doctors said could help her recover.
   New York's highest court Friday refused to hear an appeal by the
two anti-abortion activists, and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood
Marshall, who handles New York cases, later turned down their
request for a stay.
   The Court of Appeals and Marshall rejected the motions without
comment.
   Klein said he learned of Marshall's decision while at North Shore
University Hospital on Long Island where his brain-damaged wife has
been in a coma since a Dec. 13 car accident. Mrs. Klein, 32, is 17
weeks pregnant.
   ``I told Nancy that everything was going to be fine. I gave her a
kiss and came home,'' Klein told The Associated Press from his home
in Upper Brookville.
   Klein, 34, and his wife have a 3-year-old daughter.
   Dan Rosett, a hospital spokesman, said the hospital is preparing
to perform the abortion Saturday morning. Another spokeswoman, Carol
Hauptman, said doctors Friday night gave Mrs. Klein medication that
is routinely administered about 12 hours before an abortion is
performed.
   John Short, who along with John Broderick, fought Klein for
guardianship rights, said they would ask Supreme Court Justice
Antonin Scalia to impose a stay so the case can be brought before
the full Supreme Court.
   ``They are criminally assaulting her and killing her child,'' he
said Friday night. ``It is tragic but we are pulling out every stop
we can.''
   He said they would pursue the case even if an abortion is
performed so that the questions raised by the case can be resolved.
   A Nassau County police officer was stationed in the hospital and
a police cruiser was parked out front Friday after hospital
officials were told the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue might
try to stop the abortion.
   The hospital said pro-choice activist Bill Baird had warned of
possible action by Operation Rescue.
   Thursday night, the Court of Appeals granted a temporary stay of
a lower state appeals court decision in Klein's favor. On Friday,
the judges of the top court met for more than four hours to review
the case.
   The five-member Appellate Division of the state Supreme Court in
Brooklyn, calling the abortion opponents, Short and Broderick
``absolute strangers,'' ruled Thursday that they ``have no place in
the midst of this family tragedy.''
   Short said Thursday he was concerned about about the
``psychological and emotional state'' of Nancy Klein if she wakes up.
   ``Under our plan, we say the baby's down at the neonatal clinic
getting the best care possible,'' he said. ``Under their plan,
they've got to tell her they've killed her baby. Emotionally, that
would kill her.''
   Mrs. Klein's parents, Frederick and Anne Zusselman of Delray
Beach, Fla., have been staying with their son-in-law during the
court battle and support his decision to seek an abortion.
   ``Life will never be the same. It was too terrible. And then to
have the complications come in and the publicity,'' said Zusselman
on Friday. ``This has been such a horrendous ordeal. I hope no one
will ever have to experience what we have.''
   ``We're really torn apart. We've been up and down on a roller
coaster. These people have put us through absolute hell,'' Zusselman
added.
   The Appellate Division judges said Thursday previous New York
court decisions had established that strangers will not be appointed
legal guardians unless it's impossible to find someone within the
family to serve in that role.
   Klein had first petitioned to be named his wife's guardian on
Jan. 26. One day later, the anti-abortion activists moved to block
his petition.

   The family of a woman who gave birth while
in a coma urged a New York man on Friday not to have his comatose
wife's pregnancy terminated, saying medical experts can be wrong.
   ``We should take whatever God has given us and that's the way it
is,'' said David Blodgett Sr., whose daughter-in-law, Barbara
Blodgett, was three months pregnant when she suffered a brain injury
in a June 1988 auto accident.
   Mrs. Blodgett, 24, gave birth to a healthy baby boy, Simon, on
Dec. 9. Despite a gloomy prognosis, she began regaining
consciousness shortly after the birth, and can now sit up in a
wheelchair, answer questions by nodding her head or pointing to
letters on a piece of paper, and hold a bottle to Simon's lips.
   Blodgett said he spoke Friday morning with John Broderick, one of
two anti-abortion activists who are fighting Martin Klein, 34, of
Upper Brookville, N.Y., to be appointed guardians of Klein's wife
Nancy, 32, and her fetus.
   New York state's highest court on Friday refused to let Broderick
and John Short intervene in the case. The abortion opponents
immediately filed a motion for a stay with U.S. Supreme Court
Justice Thurgood Marshall, who handles New York cases, but he turned
down their request late Friday.
   A spokesman at North Shore University Hospital on Long Island
said doctors were preparing to perform the abortion Saturday morning.
   Blodgett said he called Mrs. Klein's mother Thursday morning to
offer information. ``I told her what transpired with Barbie,'' he
said. ``I don't think taking the baby is going to be any benefit to
the mother.''
   Blodgett, who opposes abortion, said he was not able to talk with
Klein.
   Members of Mrs. Blodgett's family point to her recovery as proof
that doctors can be wrong in such cases.
   ``They (doctors) were at one time telling us the same kind of
thing,'' said Greg Valenzuela, Mrs. Blodgett's father. ``All we
asked them to do is make the attempt to maintain both as best they
could. Once they decided to do it, it didn't seem like a major
problem.''
   Blodgett said his daughter-in-law's life was also threatened by
elevated body temperatures caused by the brain injury, and that the
antibiotics used to treat the fever were a threat to the fetus. But
there was never any serious consideration of trying to save one over
the other, he said.
   Mrs. Klein, who is 17 weeks pregnant, has been in a coma at a
Manhasset, N.Y., hospital since a Dec. 13 car accident. She is
severely brain-damaged and given a slight chance at recovery. Klein
said some physicians advised him that an abortion may enhance her
recovery and could save her life.

   Savers withdrew a record $8.1 billion from the
nation's thrift institutions in December, but $3.4 billion of the
total was accounted for by a single, healthy institution which was
shrinking deposits as part of a deliberate strategy, the government
said Friday.
   The withdrawals topped the one-month record of $7.0 billion set
in November, bringing the net outflow for two months to $15.1
billion, said the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates
2,955 federally insured savings institutions.
   Meanwhile, in a separate development, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. said Friday it had taken control of six more savings
institutions, bringing to 10 the number of S&amp;Ls brought under the
agency's control since President Bush on Monday gave it that
responsibility under his plan for the S&amp;L crisis.
   The December outflow, the eighth consecutive, was happening at a
time of mounting publicity about S&amp;L problems. Regulators closed or
merged 75 institutions that month.
   But, Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria,
Va., said money was moving out of S&amp;Ls because their interest rates
are moving up more slowing than other investments, not because
depositors were nervous.
   ``I don't think people are losing confidence. ... What this is
signaling is we have an industry ... that is under real pressure
because of these rising rates,'' he said.
   Ely noted some accelaration in the increase of interest paid to
S&amp;L depositors and said rates would likely be forced higher as the
Federal Reserve Board tightens credit in an effort to dampen
inflation.
   ``They have to start matching the rising rates and, boy, that's
hard on the bottom line. This does not bode well for thrift
earnings,'' he said. The industry, on the way to a record year of
red ink, lost $9.4 billion in the first nine months of 1988.
   According to minutes released Friday of a Dec. 13-14 meeting of
Federal Reserve policymakers, the central bank decided to push up
interest rates. The lone dissenter was Federal Reserve Board member
Martha Seger, who ``expressed particular concern that the higher
interest rates ... would aggravate'' the troubled condition of the
S&amp;L industry, the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee said.
   Economist Martin Regalia of the National Council of Savings
Institutions said the president's effort this week appears to have
bolstered confidence in savings institutions.
   ``If you look at the stock market, they look at this whole
process as being a net plus. Thrift stocks have risen in the last
few days because I guess they feel the problem is being addressed,''
he said.
   James Barth, chief economist of the bank board, said a single
institution shrank its deposit base by $3.4 billion, on purpose,
substituting low-cost borrowing.
   He also noted that money normally flows out of savings accounts
in December as people spend to celebrate the holidays.
   For all of 1988, $8.4 billion flowed out of S&amp;Ls, compared with
$1.8 billion in 1987. The annual record of $25.4 billion was set in
1981, when interest rates soared and money flowed into money market
mutual funds and other alternatives to savings accounts.
   The six institutions taken over by the FDIC, under a cooperation
agreement with S&amp;L regulators, are: First Federal of Arkansas,
Little Rock, Ark.; Savers Federal Savings and Loan Association,
Little Rock, Ark; Sandia Federal Savings and Loan Association,
Albuquerque, N.M.; Bright Banc, Dallas; University Savings
Association, Houston, and Deseret Federal Savings and Loan
Association, Salt Lake City.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said his agency, which insures
commercial bank deposits, will take control of more than 200
insolvent S&amp;Ls in the next four to six weeks.
   In an interview Friday, he confirmed published reports that top
administration officials were worried that a faster takeover could
trigger a depositor run. He said the Federal Reserve Board put
together a plan to pump money into the S&amp;L system in the event of a
problem.
   ``There were people inside the government who were very
concerned,'' Seidman said. `` ... I was on the other side, but I was
just as eager to have a (contingency) plan just in case.''
   He said he believed the danger to the S&amp;L system had eased now
that Bush had submitted his S&amp;L proposal to Congress.

   A company of Ukrainian ballet dancers down on
their luck spent Friday as tourists in the nation's capital as
American benefactors tried to find theaters that would book them.
   The 65 dancers, members of the Donetsk State Opera and Ballet
Theater, had been left in Baltimore after promoters of their 15-city
American tour backed out, leaving them without work, costumes or
music.
   The experience has left the dancers with warm feelings about the
Americans who stepped forward to pay their hotel and meal tabs, but
it has soured them on the dog-eat-dog world of capitalist show
business.
   Vadim Pisarev, the troupe's lead dancer, said of American
businessmen, ``They're very harsh. They're very dangerous.''
   ``I will be very upset if we can't continue,'' he said through an
interpreter.
   Howard Gillman, who has paid most of the costs of housing and
feeding the dancers through a foundation that bears his name, said a
decision has to be reached in the next few days on arranging a new
tour or sending the troupe back to the Ukraine.
   ``This is something you do in a year,'' he said. ``This has to be
done in days.''
   Gillman said the troupe has landed one booking in New York city
later this month.
   In Moscow, the newspaper Izvestia reported that an affiliate of
the Soviet government arts agency has reached an agreement to keep
the tour going. A schedule is being worked out, the newspaper said.
   The collapse of the tour has led to a crossfire of accusations,
with the promoters saying the dance troupe did not show up with big
Russian stars as promised, while the other side accuses the
promoters of having cold feet and empty wallets.
   In the meantime, the dancers have been shepherded through a
series of outings, finding free entertainment in museums.
   On Friday, they toured the Capitol, the White House, the National
Gallery of Art and the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum.
   When they're not strolling through a museum, the dancers have
done what most people with time on their hands do: They watch
television.
   Lots of it.
   ``They have so many programs and they're so interesting,'' said
Vyachaslav Bilinsky, one of the dancers. The only complaint, he
said, is that the commercials are driving them crazy.

   A silver-and-white Italian
air force C-130 transport plane left Friday night with coffins
bearing the remains of 15 victims of the jetliner disaster that
killed 144 people on Santa Maria island. Earlier Friday,
investigators located the jet's flight data recorder.
   Inside the transport, the name-tagged coffins, some decorated
with flowers, were strapped to the floor for the flight to Bergamo
in northern Italy.
   Portuguese and Italian officials attended a brief memorial
service in a makeshift morgue at Santa Maria airport to bless the
coffins.
   Authorities said they expected a second Hercules transport,
waiting on the tarmac, to leave Saturday with 64 more coffins. A
third plane was to depart Sunday.
   All but two of the 137 passengers were Italian, and the seven
crew members of the U.S. charter were Americans. All on board were
killed.
   The Boeing 707, operated by Independent Air Corp. of Smyrna,
Tenn., crashed into rugged Pico Mountain on Wednesday while
preparing to land in fog on a mid-Atlantic refueling stop en route
from Bergamo to Puerto Plata, a vacation spot in the Dominican
Republic.
   On Thursday, Portuguese civilian aviation officials found the
jet's cockpit voice recorder. The flight data recorder was found
Friday in its proper place in the cockpit, said Jose Martins
Freitas, head of the Azores rescue service.
   Investigators hope information on the voice and data recorders
will explain why the aircraft hit the 1,947-foot mountain just below
its peak.
   On Friday, Italy's transport minister, Giorgio Santuz, suspended
all of the company's flights from Italy to the Dominican Republic.
He said the suspension would remain in effect while the
investigation continued.
   The jet's captain, Leon Daugherty of Nashville, Tenn., had been
cleared for landing with a safety altitude of 3,000 feet.
   A team from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board flew to
the island, about 750 miles west of the Portuguese mainland, to join
Portuguese officials in the investigation.
   Freitas called off the search for victims Thursday, saying the
remains of all but two were found. Airport workers, however, said
the remains in their care accounted for only 132 bodies.
   Giovanni Battistini, Italy's ambassador to Portugal, said
authorities agreed to ship to Italy ``all remains that can be put
together as corpses.''
   Italian Air Force Lt. Col. Geno Proner said the coffins
containing the American crew's remains also would be flown to Italy,
most likely Rome.
   Italian officials said earlier they would be allowed only to ship
identifiable remains to Italy. By nightfall, fewer than 30 victims
had been positively identified.

   A hardware store sold its entire
stock of AK-47 semiautomatic assault rifles and has about 150
special orders to fill after it advertised a
``get'em-before-you-can't'' sale this week.
   ``I guess you can say sales increased,'' said Rob McCarthy, a
clerk at Blair's True Value Hardware store who works at the gun
counter.
   McCarthy said Friday the store had sold all 15 of the AK-47s in
stock and had put in special orders for many more since placing a
four-inch classified advertisement in a Milwaukee newspaper Sunday.
Menomonee Falls is about 15 miles northwest of Milwaukee.
   The weapon has received increased attention since Jan. 17 when a
gunman opened fire with an AK-47 on 400 children in a Stockton,
Calif., playground, killing five children and injuring 29 others and
a teacher.
   Store owner Jim Blair said there was no connection between that
shooting and the sale although his store had benefitted from the
recent news media attention the gun has received.
   ``The day the ad was placed in the paper, we had a poor response.
But since then there's been a lot of interest by the news media and
sales have picked up,'' he said. Two local television stations
carried stories on the sale.
   The advertisement offers one assault rifle, a cleaning kit and a
bayonet for $350. It also offers a ``buddy package deal'' in which
two people can buy two guns and 1100 rounds of ammunition for $790.
   State Rep. David Travis criticized the store for using scare
tactics to boost its sales, saying the store had played upon
unwarranted fears that the gun will soon be outlawed.
   No bills restricting purchases of assault rifles are pending in
the state Legislature, but Congress is considered legislation that
would ban AK-47s, Uzis and other military-style, semiautomatic
rifles. On Friday, police urged Congress to pass the bill.
   Wisconsin law requires a 48-hour waiting period before the
purchase of a handgun is completed, but there is no wait to buy an
assault rifle such as the AK-47 because they are classified as a
hunting rifle.
   Federal law requires anyone buying a gun to fill out a form
asserting that he or she is not a convicted criminal, is not
mentally ill and has not been dishonerably discharged from the
military.
   Travis said sales like the one by Blair's Hardware have hurt any
attempts to keep AK-47s off the street since the California shooting.
   ``I think the damage is already done if we're having `blue-light'
specials in Wisconsin on the sales of these guns,'' Travis said.
   State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Strohl of Racine, who has
supported stricter regulation of handguns, blamed the news media for
giving too much attention to the AK-47 and thus creating a hysteria
to buy the gun.
   ``I think what has happened is once people discuss this and ask
questions about the control and use of these assault rifles, persons
start saying `I better go out and get one before it's too late,'''
Strohl said.

   Communist Party leaders will revise the
official view of the 1956 anti-Soviet uprising, which was branded a
counterrevolution for three decades, a source said Friday.
   One official offered a new assessment, saying the revolt began as
an uprising that turned into a counterrevolution.
   The 108 members of the party's Central Committee met behind
closed doors to discuss a reappraisal of the revolt, an emotional
issue that has gripped the nation since a Politburo reformer stunned
Hungarians on Jan. 28 by calling it a popular uprising.
   The reformer, Imre Pozsgay, was expected to survive fierce party
criticism of his statement at Friday's meeting, the source said on
condition of anonymity.
   Gyula Horn, a state secretary in the foreign ministry and a
Central Committee member, said ``a very careful assessment was
made'' of the uprising.
   Horn said the revolt ``started as an uprising, some may call it a
popular uprising, but later it turned into something which could be
termed a counterrevolution.''
   Horn appeared on state television after the meeting to take part
in a film festival discussion group, but was immediately asked by
other panelists about the Central Committee meeting.
   An official announcement said Friday's meeting discussed a report
by party chief Karoly Grosz on topical domestic issues and adjourned
until Saturday.
   Emil Kimmel, a Central Committee official, told the state news
agency MTI 16 people spoke on issues including transition to a
multiparty system and ``different views'' over how to assess the
past.
   Pozsgay questioned the official view that the 1956 revolt was a
counterrevolution crushed by Soviet tanks. His statement opened up
public differences with other party leaders and an unprecedented
debate in the state-run press and society about the events of 1956.
   Pozsgay based his statement on the still-unpublished report of a
party committee investigating four decades of communist rule in
Hungary.
   The party's new assessment of 1956 will emerge after discussion
of the report Friday and ``will be substantially modified'' from the
old view, the source said.
   He declined to give details or say when the new view would be
made public.
   Appeals to the Central Committee from groups seeking change
appeared again in the media Friday, indicating the party is under
pressure to modify its view on 1956 if it hopes to retain public
standing under a multiparty system to be introduced by next year.
   ``After 30 years of collective failure of memory, only the open
renunciation of the one-sided falsification of history in the Kadar
period can prepare a rapprochement between the power and the
nation,'' the independent youth group FIDESZ said in the daily
Magyar Nemzet.
   Janos Kadar, the party leader from 1956 until May 1988, was
rumored to be ill Friday, and it was not certain whether he attended
the Central Committee session. As honorary party president, he is
entitled to be there, but he has missed the last two sessions, a
Western diplomat said.
   A Nov. 1, 1956, speech by Kadar was published this week in the
official journal Idea and showed him referring five times to the
revolt then as a popular uprising.
   An article in the literary journal Life and Literature fiercely
attacked Kadar for staying silent on 1956, including his whereabouts
in the crucial days when Soviets rolled into Hungary to crush the
revolt.
   The revolt began Oct. 23, 1956, with demonstrations for a new
government and demands that Soviet troops leave Hungary. About
20,000 Soviet troops entered Budapest to quell the uprising on Nov.
4, and Kadar was elevated to power.
   FIDESZ urged the members of the Central Committee to ``jump over
their own shadows'' and perform ``a historic act of international
importance'' by reassessing the 1956 revolt.
   FIDESZ and 14 other mushrooming alternative groups said Monday
they would consider the coalition government talked of by some
communist reformers only if the party changes its stand on 1956.
   East bloc sources have suggested, however, that Moscow could not
agree with Pozsgay's assessment as the sole view of the 1956 revolt.
   Hungarians glimpsed possible new leeway from Moscow, however, in
a startling statement by the prominent Soviet academician Oleg
Bogomolov, indicating he would see no threat to the Soviet Union in
a neutral or socially democratic Hungary.
   Hungarian papers gave prominent play to Bogomolov's words, which
attracted almost as much public attention as 1956 and the Central
Committee meeting.
   Although it appeared party reformers could win a victory with the
official reassessment of 1956, there were also signs of strong
conservative forces in the party.
   A group identifying itself as the Front for Socialist Democracy
was quoted in Magyar Nemzet as expressing ``anxiety over the
re-evaluation of 1956.''

   Wayne L. Hays, a 14-term congressman
whose affair with House clerk Elizabeth Ray in 1976 touched off a
payroll-sex scandal and destroyed his political career, died Friday.
He was 77.
   Hays suffered a heart attack at home Friday afternoon, said his
wife, Pat. He was taken to Wheeling Hospital in nearby Wheeling,
W.Va., where he died, said hospital spokeswoman Linda Crook.
   Hays began his political career in 1939, when he was elected
mayor of Flushing in rural eastern Ohio. He was elected to his first
term in the U.S. House in 1948, with 51.4 percent of the vote.
   He ended his national political career after nearly 28 years in
Congress when he resigned Sept. 1, 1976, to stop a House Ethics
Committee investigation into his conduct. Public hearings were to
begin 2{ weeks later.
   ``I think he did it to save his family,'' Carl Albert, then House
speaker, told reporters after receiving Hays' resignation letter.
   The Ethics Committee then voted to end its three-month
investigation of the scandal on grounds that Hays no longer was a
congressman and no longer under the panel's jurisdiction.
   The Justice Department, which also was investigating, decided not
to prosecute. Department attorneys said they lacked evidence
corroborating the account of Ms. Ray, the House clerk, and her
relationship with Hays.
   After leaving office, Hays returned to his 300-acre Red Gate Farm
in Belmont, where he bred Angus cattle and Tennessee walking horses.
   In 1978, Hays made a comeback of sorts with his election to the
Ohio House. There, he pushed bills aimed at curbing big utilities
and promoting Ohio coal, but generally kept a low profile. One
exception came during an incident in which he threatened to punch a
television cameraman during a hearing.
   He was defeated in a re-election bid in 1980.
   In 1980, Hays became chairman of the Democratic Party in Belmont
County and remained active in local party politics.
   Hays and his first wife, Martha, were divorced in 1976 after 38
years of marriage. That same year, Hays married Pat.
   The sex scandal broke during the spring of 1976. Hays first
denied, then acknowledged having an affair with Ms. Ray, then 33.
But he steadfastly denied her charges that she was kept on his
Administration Committee payroll at $14,000 a year in federal funds
only to have sex with him. Hays maintained that she did regular
committee work.
   He was among congressmen who asked for the Ethics Committee to
begin an investigation in May 1976 when Ms. Ray made the allegations
in a story in The Washington Post.
   ``I can't type, I can't file, I can't even answer the phone,''
Ms. Ray told the newspaper.
   Hays first denied the charge to the Post, saying, ``Hell's fire!
I'm a very happily married man.''
   But three days later, in an emotional speech before the full
House, Hays admitted he lied when he denied having the relationship
with Ms. Ray, who began working for his House Administration
Committee in April 1974.
   Hays later said he lied because he did not want his new wife to
find out about it.
   On June 3, 1976, five days before the Ohio primary, Hays bowed to
mounting pressure from colleagues and stepped down as chairman of
the House Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
   Despite Hays' Washington reputation as mean and abrasive and the
Capitol Hill bully, many of his heavily blue-collar constituency saw
him as a man who got things done, such as pushing through pensions
for black-lung coal disease or getting official documents such as
Army discharge papers and passports.
   He could stand at a rally and call voters by their first names.
He sent greeting cards to mark marriages, anniversaries, births and
graduations.
   In a rally in Smithfield, at the height of the scandal, Hays
said, `` ... I'm not guilty of anything except a little damn
foolishness. And if they sent everybody to jail who made a mistake _
and I made one and I apologize for it _ well, you know there
wouldn't be enough to go around ... jails, that is.''
   Although he won the 1976 primary with 62 percent of the vote, the
scandal dashed his hopes of running for governor.
   Two days after the primary, Hays was rushed to a hospital in a
coma from an overdose of Dalmane, a sleeping tablet his doctors had
prescribed for him during the scandal. He emerged from the coma in
less than 24 hours but remained hospitalized for nine days.
   Hays later said the overdose was accidental: ``If I wanted to
commit suicide, there were 30 or 40 more pills in the bottle, and I
could have taken all of them and that would have done it.''
   Besides his wife, Hays is survived by a daughter and two
grandchildren. A burial service on Monday will be private, a family
friend said.

   The Democratic-controlled Congress began
adjusting to life under a new Republican administration today after
receiving President Bush's call for no new taxes, increases in
scattered domestic programs and a offer to ``work day and night'' to
tackle the deficit.
   ``The people didn't send us here to bicker,'' the new president
said Thursday night in a nationally televised speech before a joint
session of the House and Senate. ``It's time to govern.''
   Initial Democratic reaction to the new president and his $1.16
trillion budget was cordial but wary. Republicans cheered when he
renewed his campaign call for a cut in capital gains taxes. Most
Democrats sat silently in their seats.
   Fights also are likely over Bush's proposed $5 billion cut in the
Medicare insurance program for the elderly, and his renewed
commitment to the Star Wars missile defense program.

   Michael Manley, who once courted Cuba
but now seeks U.S. support, returned to Jamaica's helm today after
trouncing Prime Minister Edward Seaga in elections marred by gunfire
and charges of fraud.
   With 65 percent of the ballots counted, the government-run
Jamaica Broadcasting Corp. network declared Manley's party the
winner of at least 34 of Parliament's 60 seats. Seaga's party had
taken eight seats and 18 seats were undecided.
   The party winning a majority of parliamentary seats forms the
government for a five-year term. Seaga's party now holds 60 seats.
   The latest returns today showed Manley's left-leaning People's
National Party leading Seaga's right-of-center Jamaica Labor Party
by a 57 percent to 43 percent margin, or 429,680 votes to 324,486.

   An anguished husband's hopes to authorize an
abortion for his comatose wife on the chance it could save her life
were dashed again by two anti-abortion activists who say his wife's
emotional health is at stake.
   ``I'm begging the American people to please help us,'' Martin
Klein said Thursday after he was rebuffed a second time in a battle
to become the legal guardian of his 32-year-old wife, Nancy.
   ``We're torn up,'' he said. ``These strangers have come off the
street and are intruding in our lives. We don't know what to do
about it.''
   Late Thursday, a state appeals court upheld a lower court ruling
that made Klein, an accountant from Upper Brookville, his wife's
guardian. But two members of an anti-abortion group immediately
appealed to the state's highest court, which placed a stay on the
decision.

   Top Iranian officials say their country
took ``too big a bite'' trying to defeat Iraq, and pointed to U.S.
intervention in the Persian Gulf as having tipped the scales in
their war against Iraq.
   In a series of unusually frank interviews with the official
Islamic Republic News Agency, President Ali Khamenei, Parliament
Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani and Chief Justice Musavi Ardebili also
said the Islamic revolution is still a long way from achieving its
goals.
   The comments on the Iran-Iraq war were the first by senior
figures to shed light on the inner workings of Tehran's military
planning and its eventual decision to accept the U.N.-mediated
cease-fire last summer after eight years of fighting.
   The interviews, monitored in Nicosia in recent days, came as Iran
celebrates the 10th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution with the
leadership divided over the country's future.

   Communist Party members called on their
leaders to close the deep divisions in the ruling elite and use
today's Central Committee meeting as a springboard to social and
political reform.
   The official MTI news agency, in a brief dispatch, said officials
opened the Central Committee meeting and ``will discuss current home
political issues,'' but gave no further details.
   The special session was called after a leading party reformer
touched off unprecedented debate with a startling reassessment of
the Hungarian revolt in 1956 against the Soviets.
   It also comes after a weekly party youth magazine revealed that
former Premier Janos Kadar repeatedly called the revolt a ``popular
uprising'' and urged Soviet troops to leave his country just three
days before they crushed the rebellion and elevated him to power.

   Congressional Democrats said Friday they will
not begin negotiations with President Bush over his $1.16 trillion
budget until the administration specifies the programs it would cut
to reduce the deficit.
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., and his
House counterpart, Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said they would meet
Tuesday with administration budget director Richard Darman to try to
learn more details about the fiscal 1990 spending plan.
   They said the vagueness with which Bush spelled out his plan for
achieving savings is aimed at putting the pressure _ and the blame _
on Congress for cuts that will inevitably be unpopular.
   ``The fiscal buck has traditionally stopped at 1600 Pennsylvania
Ave., but last night President Bush tried to pass it up to
Congress,'' Sasser told reporters.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Friday
he was seeking a waiver from the Bush administration to permit him
to participate in decisions on Third World debt even while holding
stock in a major American lender to developing nations.
   But Baker stressed that he would accept any of several options
that might be chosen by administration lawyers and ethics
specialists, including possibly selling his stock in Chemical New
York Corp., a bank holding company.
   He denied reports that C. Boyden Gray, the White House counsel,
had pressed him to sell his holdings.
   ``The discussions now revolve around waiver,'' Baker said at a
news conference during President Bush's five-hour visit to the
Canadian capital.

   New York's highest court refused Friday to

Klein his wife's guardian.
   One of the activists, John Short of Farmingdale, said his lawyers
were sending material to the National Right to Life headquarters in
Washington, and would ask the U.S. Supreme Court for a stay. ``This
will be the first time life will have a chance in the Supreme

<DATELINE>ISHPEMING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The telephone lines have been jammed for
weeks in this tiny town on Michigan's northern coast, as Americans
elsewhere discover swampers, deer camps and people called Yoopers.
   They're calling up to talk to a certain Yooper, Jimmy DeCaire, or
to order tapes from his band, Da Yoopers. There were so many calls
to DeCaire's house deep in the snowy woods by Lake Superior last
month that the circuits gave up and phones rang willy-nilly around
town.
   ``Dentists were getting called. Little old ladies were getting
called at 2 in the morning. They're ready to burn me in effigy. It's
the biggest thing in Ishpeming since the high school burned down,''
DeCaire said.
   Welcome, Ishpeming _ tiny town among the pines and swamps of
Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Welcome to the world of novelty music.
   The songs that jammed Ishpeming's phone lines won't show up on
Billboard charts or in record store bins, but they and others like
them are flourishing in gas stations and on radio shows across the
United States.
   Novelty music is a do-it-yourself business. Da Yoopers record in
DeCaire's basement and distribute their comic songs, four mailbags a
day, from DeCaire's dining room.
   ``They exist in a kind of underground way,'' says Barry Hansen,
who regularly sheds his quiet demeanor to become the king of kooky
music, Dr. Demento, in Los Angeles.
   Hansen relied on old standbys such as Spike Jones when he started
broadcasting his Dr. Demento radio show in the early 1970s. Now, he
said, he receives up to 150 new tapes a week from would-be wackos
who want air time on the 185 stations that broadcast the doctor's
nationally syndicated show.
   Underground music is flourishing.
   Not-so-underground has been the appeal of Da Yoopers, named after
the people of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, a.k.a. the U.P.
   One Da Yoopers' tune reached the cult-coveted ``Funny Five''
status, topping out at No. 1 on Dr. Demento. It has had similar
ranking on more conventional radio shows, including the Satellite
Music Network's Pure Gold program, a show out of Dallas that reaches
more than 160 stations.
   The song is called ``Second Week of Deer Camp,'' and the
flannel-shirted Da Yoopers sing it to a polka beat in the Finnish
accent of ice fishermen and lumbermen from their native North:
   ``It's da second week of deer camp, and all da guys are here. We
drink, play cards and shoot da bull, but never shoot no deer. De
only time we leave da camp is when we go for beer.''
   The sound is local. The appeal is universal.
   ``They're very, very, very good. That's about 16 verys,'' said
Dan Christopherson, who spins the discs for KXRB in Sioux Falls, S.D.
   ``Oh, they're great!'' exclaimed Frank George, a DJ for WCHS
radio, a country music station in Charleston, W.Va. ``In fact, I've
got their tape in my hand right now.''
   ``Second Week of Deer Camp'' outdid everything else on the WCHS
request line for weeks, George said. That's not surprising in West
Virginia, where schools, factories, even a trash pickup service,
shut down for deer season so the population can go hunting.
   Da Yoopers' other hit, ``Rusty Chevrolet,'' has evoked a similar
grass-roots response. To the tune of Jingle Bells, ``Rusty
Chevrolet'' is a diatribe about one man's decrepit automobile:
   ``Oh, rust and smoke, the heater's broke, the door just blew
away. I light a match to see the dash, and then I start to pray. The
frame is bent, the muffler went, the radio, it's OK. Oh what fun it
is to drive this rusty Chevrolet.''
   A good novelty song will ring more request line phones than
something off the charts, Dr. Demento said. ``Songs like these reach
out to something special for individual people, whereas Michael
Jackson tries to reach the whole world.''
   But how is it that the folks out in Texas can take a shining to
group that sings about rubber boots called swampers and Canadian
beer?
   ``That's what makes the United States so unique is our accents
and stuff and the different pockets of people,'' DeCaire said.
``There's no difference between a guy in the U.P. and a guy in
southern Texas, except they talk a little different. They all drink
beer and go to work and drive a truck.''
   DeCaire, a dark Italian-Finn who can't sit still, speaks loudest
for Da Yoopers, but there are five members in the band: Lynn
Anderson, who owns an optical store; Jerry Coffey, who runs a carpet
cleaning business; Joe Delongchamp, a college student; and Da
Yoopers' co-founder Joe Potila.
   Potila is a quiet man with a deep growl of a voice and a vision
about what the band might do for Ishpeming besides tie up its
telephone lines.
   ``Pretty soon, maybe the whole world will know what a Yooper
is,'' he said.

<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Amid the tackiness of the recent syndicated
television convention here were those defenders of good taste, or at
least good entertainment, film critics Roger Ebert of the Chicago
Sun-Times and Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune.
   In a ``cave'' Buena Vista Television had constructed in back of
the exhibition hall, the two critics took up their places in front
of a snackbar and popcorn machine to announce that next month they
will tape a one-hour retrospective of great moments from their movie
review show.
   Originally, they were paired on the PBS series, ``Sneak
Previews,'' but more recently in the syndicated series ``At the
Movies'' and ``Siskel &amp; Ebert &amp; the Movies.'' The clips retrieved
from 12 years on the air together will be titled ``Siskel &amp; Ebert's
500th Show Celebration.''
   ``We don't know if it's the 500th show,'' said Ebert. ``It's
around the 500th show. It sounded better than `Siskel and Ebert's
503rd Show Celebration.'''
   They said the highlights of the special, to air in June, will
include best arguments; outtakes; collections of parodies of the
pair, such as the one in the movie ``Hollywood Shuffle;'' best and
worst films; and interviews with stars who get to say what they
think of the critics.
   Long-time competitors in the Chicago newspaper market, Siskel and
Ebert became an underground hit when they first began bantering on
public television. They later left public TV for a more lucrative
syndication deal. As evidenced by their appearance at the National
Association of Television Programming Executives here, they have
gotten an effective standup routine down pat, too.
   Since the beginning when a scruffy pooch leaped into the seats to
announce the weekly ``Dog of the Week'' _ the week's worst movie _
they have co-starred with a collection of critters.
   Siskel recalled that when the dog was replaced with a skunk, the
striped bearer of cinema symbolism did not immediately recognize the
importance of facing the camera, so the director had to frequently
call for someone to ``spin the skunk.'' ``I thought, `I'm on a show
where they spin the skunk,''' Siskel recalled with distaste.
   Ebert remembered an animal handler who wanted to use a turkey
vulture in the role. ``My only regret is that we never got to work
with a vulture,'' he said wistfully, noting in an aside to Siskel,
``or at least YOU didn't.''

Nielsen Co. ratings, during the hour when the two shows are opposite
each other (Sajak's 90-minute show is a half-hour longer than
Carson's) ``The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson'' had an average
rating of 5.9 and a 19 share. ``The Pat Sajak Show'' had a 4.1 and
15 share. Each rating point represents 904,000 homes with
televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use. During the
last half-hour of ``Sajak,'' which is opposite the first half-hour
of ``Late Night with David Letterman,'' Letterman, too, is
prevailing. In the most recent Nielsens, ``Sajak'' had a 2.8 rating
and Letterman a 3.4.

   Elizabeth Hurley wasn't intimidated by her
first screen test, because she didn't think she had a chance of
being cast in the title role of the PBS miniseries ``Christabel.''
   The 22-year-old British actress thought she was too young for the
role of Christabel Bielenberg, the Englishwoman who married a German
lawyer on the eve of World War II. Together they resisted and
survived the Nazi regime.
   The four-part BBC drama airs in one installment per week,
beginning Sunday on PBS' ``Masterpiece Theatre.''
   Hurley was selected over hundreds of other actresses for the
role, even though her only prior experience was a four-minute part
in the anthology movie ``Aria,'' some TV commercials and roles in
episodes of ``Inspector Morse'' and ``Rumpole of the Bailey.''
   ``The screen test was a difficult scene where she (Christabel) is
interrogated by the Nazis,'' Hurley said in an interview during her
first visit to Los Angeles. ``It was a heavy scene. I wasn't nervous
because I didn't think I'd get it. I was up against some well-known
actresses. I was too young. The producers only saw me because I had
a good agent.''
   The screenplay was adapted by leading British television
scriptwriter Dennis Potter (``The Singing Detective'') from Mrs.
Bielenberg's autobiography ``The Past Is Myself.'' Mrs. Bielenberg
and her husband now live on a farm in Ireland.
   Stephen Dillon, also an unknown actor, plays Peter Bielenberg,
who sent his family to hide in the Black Forest and joined the
Resistance.
   Christabel Bielenberg, said Hurley, ``could have gone back to
England, but she chose to stay in Germany with her husband. Her
husband was anti-Hitler and joined the Resistance against the Nazis,
for which he was imprisoned. Most of his friends were hanged. It was
thanks to Christabel that he survived.
   ``She volunteered for interrogation by the Gestapo. She went to
the concentration camp where her husband was held. She was
questioned six to eight hours and during that time managed to
persuade the Gestapo to let her husband go. She put herself in the
lion's den. It was an incredibly brave thing to do. Later, they hid
in the Black Forest.''
   Hurley was in Los Angeles to promote the miniseries, but she also
stayed over for some job interviews.
   ``It's more exciting than rushing back to London,'' she said.
``On my first interview, I ended up going to Warren Beatty's house.
I drank Coca-Cola in the kitchen with him. The interview was for a
role in `Dick Tracy,' but he was looking for an American girl.
Afterward, I rang up my friends in London and told them about it.
   ``I said I wouldn't feel like I'd been to Hollywood unless I met
someone famous. I had no idea Hollywood was so spread out and
sprawling. I thought it sort of had a center.''
   Hurley was born in Surrey, England, but spent her early years
abroad, because her father was a major in the British army. She
studied dance at the London Studio Centre, but soon switched to
acting.
   ``I was a rebellious teen-ager who hung around street corners,''
she said. ``My hair's brown now, but for a while it was spiked and
pink and white and black and I wore a ring in my nose. I knew I
wanted to do something theatrical. I loved dancing, but it wasn't
until I was 18 that I knew what field I was aiming for.''

<HEAD>A Bad Deal For Bondholders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many issues in the leveraged buyout binge of
corporations are destined to have repercussions far into the future,
a future so hazy that nobody can really forecast what those effects
will be.
   Everyone involved in a leveraged buyout understands that the
mountain of debt incurred must be worked off. But it is a safe
assumption that a large percentage has very little idea of how that
feat can be accomplished.
   In short, they rely on the future to somehow take care of things.
It has worked in the past. During the 1970s, for example, inflation
allowed real estate debtors to grow rich by repaying loans in
discounted dollars.
   But as one corporate economist stated, those who have taken on
tremendous debts to buy up corporations may not be so lucky. They
are, he said, simply placing their faith in the Federal Reserve to
save them from default.
   The future will make its decision, and it could be a painful one.
But one decision doesn't await the verdict of the future. It has
been made painfully obvious already: Conventional bondholders have
been damaged.
   In an analysis of economic issues facing the new administration,
Dun &amp; Bradstreet economist Joseph W. Duncan, observes that
bondholders _ the chief financiers of LBOs _ might very well be the
patsies.
   In effect, he states, those who mastermind leveraged buyouts make
the assumption that the stock price of the company they seek is
undervalued. They tender offers for the ``cheap'' stock, funding the
purchase with junk bonds.
   In this manner, he continues, returns to stockholders are
immediately maximized _ but at the expense of the bondholders, whose
values suffer for a variety of reasons:
   _Because additional interest payments have to be made on the new
debt, capital meant for investment or expansion _ part of the
security behind bonds _ may be diverted.
   The greater leverage also increases the chance of a default to
bondholders when troubled economic times occur. This might cause
bond prices to fall and bond yields to rise, jeopardizing the
further use of bonds as a financing tool.
   _The increased supply of bonds issued by a company, and by the
market in general, reduces the attractiveness of bonds, and hence
also reduces their price.
   _Whereas stockholders have the option to sell their shares to a
new management, thereby avoiding future risks, bondholders have no
such rights. They are exposed to the additional, unanticipated risk
of that new management.
   A leveraged buyout, for instance, means that existing bonds
outstanding are backed not by the publicly owned company that issued
them but by a privately owned successor. The old company might have
been solid, the new one risky.
   For another, the high-risk bonds used to finance the leveraged
buyout might relegate existing, older, once high-quality bonds to
``junk'' status too.
   Institutional bondholders are furious about the situation,
claiming their trust has been violated. Some have gone to court.
Most have also gone to a somewhat unsympathetic Securities and
Exchange Commission.
   While some answers might be forthcoming from the courts and
regulators, the real impact might develop in the marketplace itself.
   Having been burned so badly in bonds, that is, can bondholders,
who are generally conservative individuals and institutions, be
expected to take such chances again?

   It takes five years for one of the 184 tiny wheels
in a new Swiss watch to complete a single revolution. Another wheel
takes a century. Then after 400 years, a lever has to be moved so
the watch's calendar won't skip a leap year date.
   It also is the first timepiece to calculate the date of Easter
and features a celestial chart showing the Milky Way and 2,800
Northern Hemisphere stars.
   The 18-carat gold ``Calibre 89,'' which has a diameter of 3.4
inches and weighs 2.4 pounds, has two dials and 24 hands. Packed
among its parts are 68 springs, 126 jewels and 332 screws.
   Patek Philippe, the Geneva company that recently unveiled the
Calibre 89 to mark its 150th anniversary, says it hasn't any idea
how much it can sell the watch for, so it plans to auction it off
April 9 in Geneva.
   ``We estimate that it will get between 5 million and 10 million
Swiss francs ($3.2 million and $6.4 million),'' said Osvaldo
Patrizzi, the watch expert at Habsburg, Feldman auctioneers of
Geneva.
   To date, the highest price paid for a timepiece at an auction was
$1.2 million in 1984 for a clock from the mid-17th century.
   Patek officials say the company did not keep any accounting of
how much Calibre 89 cost to make since it was not done for marketing
purposes.
   But Patek is not likely to be contested in its claim that the
Calibre 89 is the world's most complicated watch.
   A team of watchmakers took more than five years to design its
1,728 parts and four years more to assemble them.
   ``At some points, we were greatly worried that we would not
succeed,'' said Jean-Pierre Musy, the head of the firm's Complicated
Pieces Department.
   Calibre 89 has 33 functions. That is 19 more than the firm's
Packard watch of 1927, which it bought back last year for $1.3
million.
   Calibre 89's features include a daily display of the sunrise and
sunset, chimes that ring on the hour and half-hour, and ``power
reserve'' indicators that show when rewinding is needed. The
mainspring can run for 30 hours.
   But the makers' pride is the watch's ``perpetual secular
calendar.''
   It takes into account that a leap year is skipped at the turn of
most centuries by the Gregorian calendar, introduced in 1582. Only
the century years that are exactly divisible by 400, such as 2000
and 2400, have a Feb. 29.
   To keep it ``up to date,'' the complicated mechanism makes one
wheel turn once every five years, triggering a 20-tooth ``century
wheel'' to move on by one notch. A peg gives that wheel an extra
push every 100 years, thus disengaging the calendar mechanism on
three out of four century years to skip the leap year. A lever
re-engages the mechanism after 400 years.
   The date of Easter, which changes every year, is shown on the
watch at midnight of the preceding Dec. 31. Calculating the date for
more than 30 years would require additional mechanisms that would
not fit into the watch. So a special cog allowing the watch to
display it must be replaced every 30 years.
   A computer helped produce 1,600 blueprints for the watch.
   ``We could have managed without them,'' said designer Francois
Devaut, who conceded he first thought the plan for Calibre 89 was a
``utopian idea.''
   ``But it would have taken us an additional four or five years.''
   Paul Buclin of the assembly team said synchronizing the various
mechanisms was the biggest challenge. It would take about two months
to take the watch apart and reassemble it.
   Its accuracy, within one minute a month, does not match a cheap
quartz watch.
   ``But precision is not the most important thing,'' said Philippe
Stern, the company's managing director. ``The tradition of
watchmaking is.''
   Based in Geneva, where the craft dates to the late 16th century,
Patek Philippe is the oldest family-owned watchmaker in the world.
The Stern family bought the company in 1932.
   Stern said the company hopes to make three more Calibre 89s over
the next four years, including one for the its private collection of
historic watches.
   The first one will be auctioned April 9, along with 300 other
precious Patek Philippe watches, after an exhibition tour of Paris,
Milan, New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore.

<HEAD>Airline Stocks Take Off</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also on financial wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While many stocks have prospered in the market
rally of the past three months, few groups have gone farther and
faster than airline issues.
   Stocks like Delta, UAL, AMR, NWA, Alaska Air and Southwest have
all traded lately at their highest levels in at least a year.
   As it happens, those six are all components of the Dow Jones
average of 20 transportation stocks.
   The transportation average, unlike many other market indicators,
has recently come close to recouping all ground lost in the market
decline of August through December 1987.
   On Feb. 3, the average stood at 1,083.44, just 2.19 percent shy
of the all-time closing high of 1,101.16 reached at the peak of the
bull market in 1987, notes William LeFevre, an analyst at Advest Inc.
   In Wall Street's view at least, this would seem to suggest that
the industry has begun to emerge from a long, turbulent period of
adjustment to deregulation and may be headed for smoother sailing in
the future.
   During 1988, ``everything that could possibly go right did,''
said Helane Becker, an analyst who follows the airline industry for
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``The airlines had one of their
best-ever years.''
   Pretax industry earnings grew 18 percent, she estimated in a
recent report, on a 12 percent gain in revenues.
   ``The likelihood of the profitability continuing into 1989 is, in
our opinion, quite high, although the percent changes will probably
not be as dramatic,'' she added.
   In its appraisal of 91 industry groups for their likely stock
price performance over the next 12 months, the Value Line Investment
Survey ranks the air transport group a lofty ninth.
   All this has caught some investors off guard, since they have
grown used to thinking of airline stocks as a kind of commodity,
like gold or soybeans, best suited for short-term trading strategies
rather than long-term holdings.
   Two prime forces affecting most airline stocks have been
developments in the industry's sporadic passenger fare wars and
fluctuations in the price of oil.
   Traders looked for falling oil prices (translated to read ``lower
jet fuel costs'') or indications of a letup in fare competition as a
cue to take airline stocks for a quick ride.
   Promotional air fares are not likely to disappear, Ms. Becker
acknowledged. ``However,'' she said, ``we think that, overall, air
fares will remain relatively stable.
   ``This should lead to better predictability of earnings.
Consequently, we think airline company equities will become more
than trading vehicles: They are likely to become investments.''
   Despite the bright current picture presented by the industry,
Value Line analysts caution that some clouds may be forming on the
horizon.
   They say U.S. airlines, like many another domestic industry
before them, may be confronted with increased competition from
abroad in the years ahead.
   Once members of the European Economic Community fulfill plans to
form a single, unified marketplace by 1992, Value Line says,
European airlines may well seek and gain the right to fly routes
within the United States, as some American carriers now do between
destinations in Europe.
   That competition could be especially formidable, the advisory
service observes, because of the reputation for good service that
many European carriers enjoy.
   ``We wouldn't be surprised if U.S. carriers once again found
themselves operating in a vastly different marketplace within the
next few years,'' Value Line concluded.
   ``We think the adjustment would be a difficult one, and one that
might well lead to another industry shakeout.''

<HEAD>Bush S&amp;L Financing Looks Nothing Like a Duck</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's proposal to pay for a way out
of the savings and loan crisis bears no resemblaterested in solving the
problem than in assessing blame for
letting it happen.
   He made his savings and loan proposal in advance of his
nationally televised budget address to a joint session of Congress
Thursday night, the equivalent of a first-year State of the Union
message. Bush clearly wanted to isolate the S&amp;L problem rather than
see it packaged as a major feature of his domestic program.
   Indeed, the president said that despite the huge price tag he
would not let the savings and loan crisis ``significantly alter our
overall budget priorities.''
   ``But nothing is without pain when you come to solve a problem of
this magnitude,'' he said as he presented his plan on Tuesday.
Nevertheless, the new administration crafted it to make it seem as
painless as possible. That may have been overdone, as it already is
prompting Democratic complaints about rigged accounting to make the
price look lower and the budget look better.
   When Bush personally presented his S&amp;L formula, he said it would
cost $90 billion. That went up in a hurry. The Office of Management
and Budget disclosed a day later, without fanfare, that interest
over the next decade would push the figure to at least $126 billion.
   Over 30 years, the bailout is going to cost about $200 billion.
But the Bush program is designed to minimize the impact on his
revised budget. It actually would show about $200 million less for
S&amp;L rescues than the budget Reagan presented before leaving office.
Actually, more money has to be spent, but it would be charged
against the current budget instead of the Bush's new one.
   The Bush plan is to finance the rescue with a combination of
general revenues _ the taxpayer share of the cost _ and higher fees
on deposit insurance in all federally-insured savings institutions.
For savings and loans, which already pay higher premiums, the
increase would be 22 cents on each $1,000 in deposits. For banks,
the increase would be 67 cents per $1,000.
   While that's billed as a way to have the savings industry finance
the plan, the cost could be passed on to customers.
   ``I believe that banks and thrifts should pay the real cost of
providing the deposit insurance protection,'' Bush said. But he
added ``there's no guarantee'' the added fees will not be passed
along to consumers.
   In fact, there is every prospect that they will be _ although the
prudent and politic course for an industry in such circumstances is
to wait until the issue subsides and then add back the cost,
gradually and quietly.

<HEAD>Historians Take Another Look at Lincoln</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID MORRIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GETTYSBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On his 180th birthday, Abraham Lincoln
still makes news, and historians continue to revise the reality and
try to deflate the myths attached to the country's 16th president.
   The latest attempt to flesh out the portrait is ``The Historian's
Lincoln: Pseudohistory, Psychohistory and History.'' According to
the work's editor, Gabor S. Boritt, the book ``takes some of the
best (Lincoln) writers in the past decade and sums up what they have
to say.''
   What they have to say, in short, is that the man who freed the
slaves, preserved the union and delivered the Gettysburg Address was
afraid to be intimate with women, had an unappreciated sense of
humor and remains a complex subject that requires further study.
   Boritt, a Gettysburg College professor and a leading Lincoln
scholar, said Lincoln continues to be a subject of fascination and
examination because he is both a central figure of American history
and mythology.
   In the introduction to the 416-page book, published to coincide
with the 180th anniversary of Lincoln's birth on Feb. 12, Boritt
wrote that since his assassination in 1865, Lincoln has been viewed
as both a man and a god, a dual role that troubles historians:
   ``Whatever the public thought, the compromise whereby the common
man captured the Illinois years and the divine one the presidency
could not be satisfactory for scholars, since it suggested an
inexplicable transfiguration. Accordingly, they have labored through
much of this century to bridge the gap.''
   In addition to bridging the gap, ``The Historian's Lincoln'' also
uses relatively new tools to examine the president.
   For instance, Charles B. Strozier, editor of Psychohistory
Review, devotes a chapter of the book to traits and experiences that
helped form Lincoln's personality.
   ``Lincoln's story fades into legend,'' Strozier wrote. ``As a
result we are probably better informed about the trivial anecdotes
and more confused about the significant events of his formative
years than about those of any figure in American history.
   ``Most of us know, or think we know, a good deal more about his
rail-splitting or his absentmindeness than we do about the shape of
his personality, especially the sources of his periodic, paralyzing
bouts of depression; what gave meaning to his relationship with his
wife and his children; and what made him a uniquely fitted leader
for a nation rent by discord.''
   One section of his essay touches on Lincoln's sex life and his
uneasy dealings with several women, including Mary Todd, who became
his wife. Lincoln broke off two engagements, including one with Mary
Todd, for no apparent reason.
   ``Lincoln, it seems, feared intimacy and had steered clear of
heterosexual union in two relationships,'' Strozier wrote.
   He suggests it took the marriage of Lincoln's best friend to get
him over his fear.
   ``When Speed (his friend) at last actually consummated his
relationship with Fanny _ and the sky did not fall in _ Lincoln was
liberated from his fear of marriage. Speed experienced what Lincoln
could only fantasize about. He served as a kind of emotional proxy
for his conflicted friend,'' Strozier wrote.
   Such details may seem tame to readers familiar with the tales of
Gary Hart and Jim Bakker, but to historians, such probing was
unheard of until recently.
   ``Not so long ago, a thing like psychohistory didn't exist. These
are ideas and concepts that wouldn't have occurred to people 75
years ago,'' Boritt said. ``It would have been bad manners, it would
have been voyeurism, it would have been unacceptable.''
   Despite the title, Boritt said he demanded that contributors and
critics, whose reactions are also published in the volume, write for
a lay audience.
   ``In the last generation or so, historians have been
inaccessible,'' Boritt said. ``They write only for themselves.''
   He added that if Lincoln scholars write for themselves, the
popular vision of Lincoln will be dictated by Gore Vidal, author of
``Lincoln: A Novel,'' and others whose writings Boritt dismisses as
simplistic and flawed.
   ``The most important thing history teaches you is to weigh the
evidence,'' Boritt said. ``You don't just hop on the bandwagon and
rush off.''
   Boritt, an intense 40ish man seems always in a hurry in person,
but labors over historical points. He spent a decade tracking down
the size of Lincoln's big toe to try to determine if the president
was a victim of Marfan's Syndrome, a rare genetic disorder. Boritt's
conclusion: He probably wasn't.
   The professor is already thinking about his fifth book, yet
another look at the Civil War and Lincoln, from the view of the
British.
   ``Things undiscovered remain yet to be discovered,'' he said.

<HEAD>Kopell Back with KAOS in `Get Smart' Movie</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After nine years of white socks and a charming
bunkside manner as the cruise boat doctor on ``The Love Boat,''
Bernie Kopell is up to no good in the ABC movie ``Get Smart, Again!''
   Kopell is back as Conrad Siegfried, still with KAOS, still
plugging evil and terror, still trying to take over the world, still
being thwarted by Agent 86 from CONTROL.
   Agent 86 was better known as Maxwell Smart, Siegfried's American
nemesis. The truth is they were both a couple of dim bulbs, but
Smart, aided by his brainy and beautiful colleague, Agent 99, always
managed to muddle through.
   Nearly the entire original cast from the ``Get Smart'' series,
which ran from 1965 to '70, first on NBC and then on CBS, is back
for the two-hour movie on Sunday _ Don Adams as Maxwell Smart,
Barbara Feldon as Agent 99, Dick Gautier as Hymie, Dave Ketchum as
Agent 13, Robert Karvelas as Larrabee, and King Moody as Shtarker.
Kenneth Mars takes over as chief of CONTROL in place of Edward
Platt, who died in 1974.
   In ``Get Smart, Again!'' KAOS kidnaps a scientist to obtain his
secret formula for creating a weather machine. Siegfried and his
henchman Shtarker demand a ransom of $250 billion.
   Neither KAOS nor CONTROL stood for anything, the way U.N.C.L.E.,
for instance, stood for United Network Command for Law and
Enforcement on ``The Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' Their nemesis was THRUSH.
   KAOS ought to stand for Kopell's Acts of (Comic) Subversion.
   ``Siegfried is more fun than anything I've done in my life,''
said Kopell. ``I could let loose. Is there a comedy of anger?
Siegfried always appears to be angry. In the movie, KAOS has been
taken over by a corporate raider, which only adds to Siegfried's
anger and frustration.''
   ``Get Smart'' was a spoof of James Bond and it gave no quarter as
it milked its laughs from sendups of secret agents, disguises,
codes, technological gadgets and monolithic intelligence
organizations. The series was created by Mel Brooks and Buck Henry.
   ``It was biting, incisive and stepped on a few toes,'' said
Kopell. ``We got a couple of good shots at the government. It didn't
pussyfoot around the way some other shows did. It took a few swipes
at some sacred cows.''
   Kopell has been a regular or a recurring character on eight
series. At the same time he was on ``Get Smart,'' he was on ``That
Girl,'' starring Marlo Thomas.
   ``I never had a contract for either show,'' he said. ``I got to
know the assistant directors over at `That Girl,' and I'd call over
and say, `Look, I'm not working Tuesday and Wednesday.' And they'd
set up all my scenes for those days. Marlo Thomas did `That Girl,'
and she was the best boss I ever had. She was very generous, very
supportive.''
   He was also on ``The Steve Allen Show,'' ``The Danny Kaye Show,''
``The Doris Day Show,'' ``Bewitched,'' ``The Love Boat'' and ``When
Things Were Rotten.'' The latter, in which he played Alan-a-Dale in
a Robin Hood spoof, was also created by Mel Brooks. Things were
really rotten because it lasted only a few weeks.
   Kopell also supplied some of the voices for the Saturday morning
series ``Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp,'' a cartoon spoof of James
Bond. The good chimps belonged to A.P.E. and the bad chimps, led by
the Baron (Kopell), belonged to C.H.U.M.P.
   His longest-running series and the only time he was ever cast in
a romantic role was ``The Love Boat.'' He played the ship's doctor,
Adam Bricker.
   ``I was always a character actor,'' he said. ``I couldn't believe
it when I got the role. It was wonderful. I'm grateful, but I never
knew how it happened. I was cast when Dick Van Patten pulled out
after doing the pilots to do ``Eight Is Enough.'''
   Kopell credits producer Leonard Stern with casting him as
Siegfried in ``Get Smart.''
   ``There was no reason why a 33-year-old kid would get the part,''
he said. ``But Leonard had seen me playing an immigrant in `The 49th
Dozen' at the Players Ring. He sent me a sweet letter and said we'd
work together sometime. Two years later he called me to play
Siegfried. He asked me if I could do the accent. I lied and said of
course I could.
   ``Makeup made me look very old. They put a fencing scar on my
left cheek. I was a baby-faced kid. I remember being unhappy
whenever the makeup came off. I was me again.''

<HEAD>Mixing Merchandising and Libido Makes Newstand Sales Sizzle</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: In 6th graf, `sexy sell' in quote is cq</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT DVORCHAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Sports Illustrated didn't invent the concept that covergirls in
skin-tight spandex make newsstand sales sizzle. That idea dawned on
magazine editors about the time they perfected glossy pictures.
   The spectrum now ranges from Four Wheeler magazine, which once a
year compliments the bodies of its trucks with bodies of beauties,
to Cosmopolitan, the women's magazine that thrives on sensuality and
cleavage.
   ``Sex is an attractive commodity if it's packaged well,'' said
Cosmopolitan's editor Helen Gurley Brown. ``Everybody likes to look
at pretty girls in bathing suits.''
   And in Cosmo's business office, there's mock surprise. ``Sex
sells? Nooooooo. Really?'' said Debbie Berg, making the questioner
feel like the farm boy caught looking at lingerie in the Sears
catalogue.
   Fashion designers know it. Health clubs show it. Car dealers grow
on it. Makers of everything from beer, booze and ice cream rake in
dough on it.
   ``Not only does sexy sell, which has been true since God created
women and men, there's a wholesomeness possible about sexiness,''
said Christie Hefner, empress of Playboy Enterprises, which
publishes the world's largest men's magazine. ``It's an acceptable
category of media. It's bigger than it's ever been.''
   Just ask Sports Illustrated. It makes an annual marketing splash
mixing merchandising and libido by showcasing baby-oiled bodies in
see-through mesh rather than the normal fare of athletes dressed in
sweat and grass stains.
   The swimsuit issue, now marking its 25th anniversary, is devoted
entirely to swimwear for the first time.
   This edition may be the best read in the magazine's 35-year
history. An estimated 41 million people, double the average, will
read it, including 13 million women, triple the norm.
   ``The notion that sex sells has been around since the turn of the
century when magazines learned they could reproduce a nice
illustration,'' said David Stewart, a consumer psychologist and
professor of marketing at the University of Southern California.
   ``You tend to get the opposite sex paying attention to the
picture, but a person of the same sex responding to the copy,'' he
said. ``Women like to emulate what they see. They want to know what
are the beauty secrets.''
   The swimsuit issue was born during the midwinter sports doldrums
when a bikini-clad Babette March graced the Jan. 20, 1964, cover.
The idea was to help readers weather the dead time between football
and spring training _ and to help magazine sales.
   The latest one could gross $30 million in sales and spinoffs for
Time Inc.
   The 2.5 million street copies are $3.95 each. The 286-page issue
has 118 pages of ads worth over $15 million. Home Box Office, also
owned by Time Inc., has a 50-minute show on how the issue was made
and has 600,000 orders for a $19.99 videocassette. About 750,000
calendars at $10.95 each are on sale.
   The success of bigger sales with smaller suits tempted
competitors to feature voluptuous women in teensy Lycra straining
against its carnal cargo.
   Inside Sports and Sport magazine have copycat versions. Swimwear
Illustrated and American Swimwear exhibit sultry women in suggestive
apparel, supplying order blanks but not bothering with articles.
   Hot Rod magazine's swimsuit issue last April pumped circulation
28 percent to more than 1 million copies. Four Wheeler, with an
audience that is 90 percent male, sold 156,000 copies or 50 percent
more than normal with a July swimsuit issue.
   ``We got 17 letters of protest, six from women who wrote, `Send
in the hunks.' They thought it was too one-sided,'' said editor John
Stewart. ``How can sex not sell? Why shouldn't it sell?''
   Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue gets tons of free publicity,
good and bad.
   It was recently spoofed in the Doonesbury cartoon strip. Dick
Bradley, a cartoonist for The Buffalo News, once depicted Hugh
Hefner holding the issue and saying, ``Actually, I read it because
of the interesting, ah, articles.''
   On the flip side, critics blister the jock journal for
sexploitation.
   ``It's about presenting women as bimbos. What is a sports
magazine doing publishing pornographic pictures of women?'' said
Mary Jo Kane, professor of sport management at Bowling Green State
University.
   ``I wish they'd spend half as much time presenting women as
serious athlethes instead of Playboy bunnies. They wouldn't get away
with it if they put stereotypes of racism or anti-Semitism on their
cover,'' she said.
   ``It borrows from pornography. It reduces women to a collection
of body parts. It's a damaging presentation of women,'' said Norma
Ramos, general counsel for Women Against Pornography.
   The swimsuit issue gets censored from school library shelves.
   ``Offensive, indecent and chauvinistic'' was the review from
Kenneth Roetzel, superintendent of schools in New Danube, Minn., who
removed it in 1985. In a letter to Sports Illustrated he said it
``stooped to the moral depths'' of Playboy and Penthouse.
   The debate can even place columnists from the same paper on
opposite sides.
   ``SI's swimsuit issue is little more than a euphemism for soft
porn, Playboy before the public revolution. It is the girlie
magazine men figure they can buy without offending their wives,''
wrote Kathleen Parker of The Orlando (Fla.) Sentinel.
   But the paper's sports columnist Brian Schmitz preferred models
over basketball players. He wrote: ``I'd rather look at Christie

   President Bush proposed a $1.16 trillion
``common sense'' budget for fiscal 1990 that calls for less military
spending but greater domestic outlays than sought by President
Reagan.
   The plan, unveiled Thursday, features a one-year freeze on scores
of federal programs. It is an overhaul of the budget submitted by
former President Reagan last month and carries out Bush's oft-stated
campaign vow of not seeking any increase in taxes.

   The Financial Accounting Standards Board proposed
rules that would force U.S. companies to deduct billions of dollars
in profits to account for medical and insurance benefits provided to
retired employees.
   The proposal, scheduled to take effect in 1992, could wipe out
the earnings of many companies, prompting some to reduce or
discontinue promised benefits, analysts said after Thursday's

<HEAD>Significant Events in the RJR Nabisco Takeover Battle</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-RJR Nabisco, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are key events in the takeover struggle for RJR Nabisco Inc.:
   _Oct. 20, 1988: RJR Nabisco announces that top managers led by
chief executive F. Ross Johnson propose to buy the company for $75 a
share in cash and securities or nearly $17 billion, using mostly
borrowed money to be repaid with the company's earnings, assets or
both, a transaction known as a leveraged buyout. The takeover would
dwarf the previous record $13.4 billion paid for Gulf Corp. by
Chevron Corp. in 1984. It also would come less than four years after
tobacco maker R.J. Reynolds bought Nabisco Brands for nearly $5
billion.
   _Oct. 24: Investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., the
leader in leveraged buyouts, offers $20.25 billion or $90 a share in
cash and securities for RJR.
   _Oct. 27: Salomon Brothers Inc. joins Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
as the main backers of Johnson's group. At the same time, Kohlberg
Kravis takes its bid directly to RJR shareholders with a tender
offer for their stock.
   _Nov. 2: Informal talks between the two competing bidders to
undertake a joint takeover collapse, partly because of disputes on
fees to be paid to the investment bankers.
   _Nov. 4: Johnson's group raises its bid to $92 a share or $20.7
billion. Forstmann Little &amp; Co., a buyout specialist that competes
with Kohlberg Kravis, suggests it is interested in possibly bidding
for the company as well.
   _Nov. 7: RJR's committee of outside directors announces it will
entertain bids for the company while pursuing other options,
including a debt-financed restructuring.
   _Nov. 16: ITT Corp.'s insurance subsidiaries, large holders of
RJR corporate bonds, sue RJR and Johnson, claiming the leveraged
buyout contemplated by management hurt the value of those bonds.
   _Nov. 17: Forstmann Little says it won't bid for RJR.
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., another big RJR bondholder, files
the second major lawsuit against Johnson and RJR.
   _Nov. 18: The first deadline for submitting bids to the special
RJR committee passes, and proposals are received from Johnson's
group, Kohlberg Kravis and a late contender, First Boston Corp.
   _Nov. 20: RJR special committee extends the auction until Nov.
29, saying the offers received were inadequate. It said Johnson
offered $100 a share or $22.7 billion; Kohlberg Kravis offered $94 a
share or $21.3 billion; and First Boston offerd a vague plan it
valued as high as $118 a share or $26.8 billion.
   _Nov. 28: In an interview published in Time magazine, his first
public statement since the the takeover fight began, Johnson denies
he undertook the leveraged buyout for personal enrichment, although
he could make $100 million.
   _Nov. 29: The second deadline for bids expires and all three
bidders submit new offers worth at least $100 a share each. Late
that night, the company announces a definitive merger agreement with
Kohlberg Kravis at $109 a share, or $24.53 billion.
   _Jan. 17, 1989: Kohlberg Kravis announces it has obtained
commitments for the $14.5 billion in bank loans it needs to help
finance the takeover.
   _Feb. 3: The Federal Trade Commission approves the acquisition on
the condition that Kohlberg Kravis sell lines of oriental foods,
packaged nuts and ketchup produced by either RJR or
Beatrice-Hunt-Wesson Inc., a Kohlberg Kravis unit.
   _Feb. 9: The Kohlberg Kravis tender offer expires, and Kohlberg
Kravis says it has been tendered approximately 96.8 percent of RJR
Nabisco's common stock. Johnson resigns and J. Paul Sticht, a former
chairman of RJR Industries Inc., is named acting chief executive.

<HEAD>Boeing Paid $125,000 FAA Fine For Failure To Inspect Plane Parts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. paid a $125,000 fine in early 1988
that was assessed by the Federal Aviation Administration for the
company's failure to properly inspect self-locking nuts used in its
airplanes, a company spokesman confirmed Thursday.
   After becoming aware of the defective parts, the company
tightened its specifications for manufacturing and testing the
particular kind of self-locking nut involved, Boeing spokesman Tom
Cole said.
   The fine was the largest ever assessed against Boeing for a
quality-control violation, he said.
   Cole said the nuts are used in various parts of the airplanes,
including flight-control systems for the rudder and wing flaps.
   He said there have been no Boeing planes involved in accidents or
incidents related to failure of the defective parts that he was
aware of. Failure of the self-locking nuts would be unlikely to
cause a serious problem because of backup systems built into the
planes, Cole said.
   Boeing learned in 1985 that some of the nuts in planes delivered
to customers did not meet specifications for torquing and locking,
Cole said. The company sent service bulletins to the customers and
the FAA issued airworthiness directives ordering airlines to check
the nuts and replace them if necessary.
   Cole said Boeing didn't blame the manufacturers who supplied the
defective parts, since it was Boeing's specifications that needed to
be revised.
   Cole said Boeing 767s were involved in the inspections, but that
the self-locking nuts are used on all types of planes the company
manufactures. He said the company paid four other fines of a few
thousand dollars each for lesser quality-control violations.
   ``When we find things wrong we report it to the FAA'' and take
steps to correct it, Cole said.

<HEAD>Accounting Board Proposes Rules That Could Lower Pension Benefits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employees expecting medical benefits after
retirement may wind up with drastically reduced health plans or none
at all if a controversial accounting rule is enacted.
   The Financial Accounting Standards Board on Thursday proposed a
new procedure that would force U.S. companies to deduct billions of
dollars in annual profits to account for medical and insurance
benefits to be paid to employees after they retire.
   But the proposed rules, scheduled to take effect in 1992, could
wipe out the earnings of many companies, forcing some to reduce or
discontinue benefits, analysts said.
   Such cutbacks could affect millions of employees.
   A 1988 survey by the Wyatt Co. consulting firm of more than 2,200
employers showed that 54 percent of all employers offer medical
benefits to retired workers. Twenty-one percent of the companies
pick up the entire tab, while 74 percent of the retirees pay less
than half of their bills.
   The impact of the proposed rules would vary but probably would
affect larger companies more than smaller ones, said Harry Don, a
Cleveland-based group-benefit consultant for Wyatt Co.
   ``There are moderate-sized companies out there who will go from a
profit position to a loss position. This will more than wipe out
their reported profits,'' Don said.
   Current accounting rules do not obligate companies to report
estimated retiree benefit expenses or to reserve money for them.
They only have to report such expenses as they are paid.
   But the new rule _ which has been in the works for a decade _
would require companies to deduct from their earnings enough money
for a special reserve that would cover the estimated benefit
expenses.
   FASB, a government-sanctioned authority for setting accounting
standards, acknowledges that retirement benefits are the biggest
liability for some companies, yet they are not recognized in most
financial statements.
   The proposal would require companies to set up a reserve to cover
retiree benefit costs. Companies would set aside funds when an
employee begins working and would add to the reserve until the
employee becomes eligible for retirement, generally at age 55.
   There also would be a reserve to make up for past years that
companies did not set aside funds.
   Most companies have not set up such reserves because, unlike
pension costs, other retirement benefits aren't deductible from
taxable income.
   But LTV Corp. last November announced it was taking a $2.26
billion charge for what it anticipates will be its potential health
insurance cost liability for 118,000 current and retired employees.
And earlier this month, Corning Glass Works announced an $84 million
after-tax charge to account for retiree medical benefits.
   FASB Chairman Dennis R. Beresford said the new rule would make
financial statements more informative and complete and would enhance
disclosure.
   ``It will require companies to publicly acknowledge their
existing commitments to investors and other users of financial
statements who in turn can evaluate the implications of those
promises,'' Beresford told a news conference.
   He also said the proposed accounting would not change the nature
or cost of current pension promises.
   With medical costs soaring at an average rate of 20 percent a
year, the potential benefit liability of U.S. corporations is
staggering.
   The Employee Benefit Research Institute, a non-profit
organization in Washington, estimates that non-governmental
employers owe at least $168.7 billion in retiree health benefits,
assuming medical inflation is brought under control. The General
Accounting Office puts the figure at over $200 billion.
   ``Those benefits may have been granted on the assumption that the
costs would be relatively minor and could be paid for quite easily
out of current cash flow and current earnings as they were
incurred,'' Beresford said.
   Some companies already are looking closely at how to minimize
their retiree health insurance costs by restricting or eliminating
such benefits.
   Employer groups are preparing to fight the rule, which could end
up before Congress and be dramatically modified by the time the
battle is over, said Lee Seidler, an accounting specialist and
senior managing director of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.
   Seidler believes the debate will postpone enactment of the rules
until at least 1995, and by then the impact will be dramatically
reduced.
   ``FASB will modify this thing, companies will reduce benefits to
employees and Congress will allow them to take money from overfunded
pension funds and put it in underfunded health funds. That will
relieve the impact,'' Seidler said.
   Companies will have six months to comment on the draft FASB
proposal. Public hearings will follow in October and November in New
York and Washington and a final rule is expected in late 1990.

   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Inc. is in the final
stages of its record $24.53 billion acquisition of RJR Nabisco Inc.,
having completed an epic tender offer for the food and tobacco giant.
   Kohlberg Kravis said it was tendered more than 216.6 million
shares, or approximately 97.2 percent, of RJR Nabisco's outstanding
common stock by the time its $109-per-share offer expired Thursday.
   The investment firm is undertaking the largest U.S. corporate
acquisition ever. The next largest would be the $13.4 billion
purchase of Gulf Oil Corp. by Chevron Corp. in 1984.
   As RJR Nabisco shares changed hands Thursday, so did control of
the conglomerate, which makes such well-known products as Winston
and Camel cigarettes and Oreo cookies.
   Company president F. Ross Johnson, defeated by Kohlberg Kravis in
the takeover fight, resigned as expected and was replaced by J. Paul
Sticht, a former chairman of RJR Industries Inc. RJR Industries
merged with Nabisco Brands Inc. in 1985 to form RJR Nabisco.
   Johnson left praising the people who beat him. ``I feel the
company is in good hands,'' he said in a statement issued by
Kohlberg Kravis.
   It was Johnson who instigated the bidding war for RJR Nabisco
with the announcement Oct. 20 that a management group he led was tendered
nearly 1.2 million
shares, or approximately 95 percent, of RJR Nabisco's preferred
stock. Those shares would be paid for on Friday, the firm said.
   Ruth Pachman, a spokeswoman for Kohlberg Kravis, said it was not
immediately known when the firm would complete the acquisition
because it must obtain federal approval for the new securities
before it can close the deal.
   After the acquisition is completed, Kohlberg Kravis must begin to
divest several food lines to comply with an order from the Federal
Trade Commission.
   In clearing the RJR Nabisco purchase earlier this month, the FTC
said Kohlberg Kravis must sell competing lines of oriental foods,
packaged nuts and ketchup produced by either RJR or another Kohlberg
Kravis unit, Beatrice-Hunt-Wesson Inc.
   Kohlberg Kravis will have a year to sell the product lines. Until
the divestiture is completed, it must run RJR Nabisco as a separate
operation.
   Kravis on Thursday reiterated his company's intention to sell $6
billion in food businesses over the next 18 months to help finance
the deal, which relies heavily on the use of high-interest junk
bonds.
   The purchase of RJR Nabisco is a leveraged buyout, in which a
company is acquired mainly with borrowed funds that are repaid with
money raised by asset sales or the company's cash flow.
   The size of the RJR Nabisco deal has prompted criticism of LBOs
in general and a series of congressional hearings about whether they
should be curtailed.

   When it came to the budget, Bush did not claim to have the final
solution.
   He said he and his team ``are ready to work with the Congress, to
form a special leadership group, to negotiate in good faith, to work
day and night _ if that's what it takes.''
   There were discouraging words for the president from Democrats
who vowed to fight any cuts in Medicare, and Rep. Dan Rostenkowski
said he would use his chairmanship of the House Ways and Means
Committee to contest cuts in the capital gains tax.
   Not all Republican were entirely pleased, either.
   ``It's not immediately apparent how all those initiative are
going to be paid for, even with the defense freeze. Maybe that will
become apparent tomorrow,'' said Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.
   One Democrat, Sen. Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, chided Bush for
straying too far from conservative doctrine.
   ``It's a much kinder, gentler budget. His speech could have been
delivered by any Democrat,'' he said..``His problem will be getting
it through his party. Ours will go along with 70 or 80 per cent of
it.''
   Bush said his predecessor had wrought improvements in eight years.
   ``I don't propose to reverse direction,'' he said. ``We are
headed the right way.'' Nonetheless, he proposed a string of
initiatives that indicated shifts from some of the positions of the
Reagan administration.
   Among his proposals:
   _Increased spending of $2.2 billion over Reagan's budget for
basic research.
   _Enactment of urban enterprise zone legislation to revitalize
inner cities.
   _An increase of almost $1 billion for the war on drugs, coupled
with this threat to the drug pushers: ``If you are caught and
convicted, you will do time.'' He repeated his campaign call for the
death penalty for ``the worst kingpins.''
   _Environmental initiatives including funding for a clean coal
technology agreement with Canada, an improved Clean Air Act with
specific deadlines for reducing acid rain and new acquisitions under
the land and water conservation fund. He also called for indefinite
postponement of two oil lease sales off the California Coast and a
third in Florida.
   In a bow to anti-abortionists, Bush proposed a tax deduction of
up to $3,000 for parents who adopt a child.
   He also called on Congress to enact his savings and loan industry
rescue plan within 45 days.
   And he called for a host of changes in budgeting, including
several that have been rejected before, including a constitutional
amendment to balance the budget, a law permitting the president to
veto individual items in appropriations bills. He recommended other
steps to strengthen his hand in budget negotiations with Congress,
as well.
   Bush also said he favors statehood for Puerto Rico, but called on
Congress to establish a referendum to allow the people of the
commonwealth to decide.

   Retired civil servants won't like what George
Bush's ``kinder, gentler America'' has in store for them. But other
citizens, from drug addicts seeking treatment to couples adopting
children, may find hope in the president's 1990 budget blueprint.
   For veterans, the president asked Congress in a nationally
broadcast address Thursday night to retain a 1 percent origination
fee on V.A. housing loans, but dropped former President Reagan's
proposed boost in the mortgage fee to 3.8 percent.
   Bush's proposal to extend the 3 percent federal excise tax on
local and long-distance phone calls will come as only the smallest
of surprises to those who read Bush's lips during the 1988
presidential campaign. Bush pledged ``no new taxes,'' but didn't say
anything about expiring ones.
   Like Reagan, the president offered a bitter pill to federal
retirees, including military pensioners: a 1990 pension freeze that
would save taxpayers $1.4 billion.
   Bush also would ban federal retirees from collecting a portion of
their benefits in a lump-sum that now averages nearly $30,000.
   In 1991 and beyond, Bush would limit the retirees' raises to the
cost-of-living minus 1 percentage point. Reagan, himself now a
federal pensioner, also sought those cuts.
   But the nation's 38 million Social Security beneficiaries, due
for roughly a 3.6 percent increase in January 1990, would not be
asked to sacrifice.
   ``Social Security is fully funded, including a full
cost-of-living adjustment. We must honor our contract,'' Bush said.
   To keep campaign promises, Bush asked for a $149 million increase
in the $1.2 billion Head Start budget to enroll up to 95,000 more
4-year-olds in the pre-school readiness program _ a one-third
increase in that age group. But advocates say more than 2 million
poor pre-kindergarten children are eligible for Head Start, and
currently there are places for only 453,000.
   Working poor families with infants and toddlers would benefit
from another budget plank lifted intact from the Bush campaign: a
new tax credit of up to $1,000 per child under age 4.
   This credit would be refundable to families that don't pay income
taxes, and would be phased out for families with incomes between
$8,000 and $13,000 in 1990.
   Bush also wants to tinker with the tax code to spur adoptions.
``I propose to re-enact the tax deduction for adoption expenses, and
to double it to $3,000,'' he said.
   He would pump more than a quarter-billion dollars extra into the
war on drugs, already slated for a sizable increase in the final
Reagan budget. All told, the Bush administration sought $5.5 billion
to wage the fight against drugs, $974 million, or 21 percent more
than in the current budget.
   Among the increases: $127 million, or 24 percent, more for drug
treatment, including a $25 million grant to reduce the waiting time
for admission to treatment programs.
   Victims of crime might be helped by Bush's request to increase a
federal compensation fund to $125 million from $94 million.
   He proposed a variety of incentives for America's students and
teachers, including the first $30 million toward an eventual $500
million ``Presidential Merit Schools'' program and new awards of
$5,000 apiece to 1,200 teachers.
   Top high school seniors in science and math could compete for 570
college scholarships worth up to $10,000 a year.
   Americans also might learn more about themselves and their
economy under Bush's blueprint. He wants to more than double to $1.6
billion the budget for gathering economic and demographic statistics.
   While Bush shelved a Reagan plan to cut more than $1 billion from
Medicaid payments to states, he still hopes to pare Medicare's
budget by $5 billion.
   Bush said his Medicaid budget would expand coverage to pregnant
women and infants up to 185 percent of the poverty line, and poor
children up to age 8. He also wants to allow poor families to get
immunizations for children under 6 simply by showing a food stamp
card at clinics.
   For the homeless, Bush proposed full-funding of the McKinney Act,
which would boost spending from $500 million to $644 million, and he
wants to launch a new $50 million initiative to help move homeless
families out of welfare hotels and improve services for the mentally
ill.
   And every young American would be challenged to perform voluntary
service under the aegis of Bush's proposed ``YES to America
Foundation'' The government would provide matching grants of $25
million a year for four years.

   Members of the Chicago Board of Trade were more
confused than enlightened following a closed-door meeting at which
exchange officals presented plans for an off-hours electronic
trading system, sources said.
   ``If the floor vote were held today I don't think it would
pass,'' said one trader. ``Not because people are against it in
principle but there are just too many questions about it.''
   The exchange plans to hold several smaller meetings with traders
over the next three weeks to further explain the system before
putting it to a vote of the 3,500 members on March 2, according to
traders who attended Thursday's meeting.
   Also on Thursday, BOT President Thomas Donovan said exchange
officials have withdrawn tentative plans to restrict or eliminate
dual trading after they were flooded with complaints from members.
Dual trading allows members to trade both for themselves and for
customers.
   Sources at the exchange said Board of Trade Chairman Karsten
Mahlmann told members the proposed electronic trading system was
designed to give foreign investors access to the exchange's
financial futures _ especially its U.S. Treasury bond futures market
_ when the trading floor is closed.
   But industry experts said the proposed move into computerizedke Globex,
the system would be open to other futures
exchanges that wish to list their products for trading. The New York
Mercantile Exchange and the Sydney Futures Exchange of Australia
have already indicated they will list some of their products on
Globex.
   But unlike Globex, the Board of Trade system would be developed
and owned entirely by the exchange and its members.
   Exchange officials did not provide a cost estimate of the
proposed system, traders said.

<HEAD>Lexus Name May Vanish From Toyota Lineup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Lexus name for Toyota Motor Corp.'s new luxury
car division will be history if a federal appeals court rules
against it in a lawsuit, a company official says.
   ``We'll have to change our name,'' Lexus General Manager Dave
Illingworth said Thursday, in the event the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeal in New York rules against it in a lawsuit brought by Mead
Data Central Inc. of Dayton, Ohio.
   Mead Data contends the car maker is illegally diluting the name
of its Lexis legal-information retrieval service.
   Illingworth, who took control of the Lexus Division last month
after Jim Perkins returned to General Motors Corp., said he expects
a ruling from the New York court by the end of the month. But if the
automaker loses, there will be no appeal to the Supreme Court, he
added.
   He said the timing of the launch of the Lexus line, consisting
for now of two sedans, requires that a name be in place by the time
the cars are delivered to showrooms this fall.
   Also, Illingworth said, ``I think it's very doubtful that the
Supreme Court would hear this case.''
   The process for choosing another name has begun, he said, but no
alternative name has been selected. He said he was aware of no
settlement negotiations going on, but that Toyota always has wanted
to resolve the case out of court.
   If the court rules against Lexus and the name is dropped,
Illingworth said, ``Two years from now, nobody will even remember
the old name.''
   During the course of the lawsuit, possible settlements had been
drafted by Mead Data and Toyota, but those will not be resurrected,
Illingworth said.
   Company officials have declined to say how much money is tied up
in the Lexus name, but that it is the millions of dollars.
   ``We aren't that unbusinesslike that we haven't made plans in
case that something unfortunate happens,'' Illingworth said. ``We're
fully prepared to make an adjustment and continue.''
   Lexus plans to sell Japanese-made cars costing between $20,000
and $40,000 in the United States this fall. But before that happens,
Illingworth said he expected a decision on a battle with Mead Data.
   Mead Data sued Toyota last year, claiming that Lexus diluted the
name of its legal-information retrieval service, Lexis. A federal
judge in New York agreed and in December ordered Lexus to stop using
the name.
   The automaker won a stay in the appellate court, which last heard
arguments Jan. 30. It has not said when it plans a ruling.

<TEXT>
   McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., the
nation's biggest operator of cellular phone systems, said its losses
more than doubled in the fourth quarter because of acquisition and
start-up costs in new markets.
   McCaw lost $92.2 million on revenue of $91.3 million in the
quarter, more than twice the $44.1 million lost in the same period
of 1987 on revenue of $61.3 million, the company said Thursday.
   Craig O. McCaw, chairman and chief operating officer, said the
losses were expected. He said costs for construction, acquisitions,
debt service and marketing were expected to be substantial.
   For all of 1988, McCaw Cellular had net losses of $297 million on
revenues of $310.8 million, compared with net income of $89.9
million on revenues of $196.4 million for 1987.
   McCaw said cellular subscribers in its markets and markets in
which it has the right to buy a controlling interest rose by 65
percent in 1988 to 250,000, from 156,000 the year before.
   McCaw offers cellular telephone service under the ``Cellular

<TEXT>
   Faberge Inc. of the United States is selling its
toiletries, cosmetics and fragrance businesses, including Elizabeth
Arden, to the Unilever Group for $1.55 billion in cash, it was
announced today.
   The deal will give Unilever, the British-Dutch consumer products
giant, ownership of such brand names as Faberge, Elizabeth Arden,
Brut, Aqua Net, Chloe and Lagerfeld.
   Faberge and its Elizabeth Arden subsidiary are owned by Meshulam
Riklis's Riklis Family Corp. and have headquarters in New York. The
units being sold had combined sales of more than $800 million and
operating profits of $100 million in their latest fiscal year.
   With 1987 sales of $31 billion, Unilever is one of the world's
largest manufacturers of brand-name consumer products, packaged
goods and personal care products.
   The only part of Faberge Inc. not being purchased by Unilever is
the McGregor Apparel Group, which has about $240 million in annual
sales and $20 million in operating profits, according to Daniel
Manella, chairman and chief executive of Faberge Inc.
   Manella said Faberge Inc. will drop its name as part of the deal,
possibly changing it to McGregor.
   The transaction is expected to be completed in 90 days and is
subject to the necessary government clearances. A month ago, the two
companies announced that they were in discussions which might lead
to the sale of some of Faberge's businesses to Unilever.
   Unilever chairman Michael Angus said the acquisition will
increase the size of Unilever's personal products business by more
than 25 percent. Unilever's strategy is to develop its operations
both internally and through acquisition, he said.
   ``The Faberge and Elizabeth Arden businesses provide an excellent
fit with Unilever's existing personal products operations
worldwide,'' Angus said.
   Angus said Elizabeth Arden's portfolio of brands will provide
Unilever with a global presence in the prestige segment of the skin
care and color cosmetics markets while it will also enhance
Unilever's position in fine fragrances.
   Faberge is expected to complement Unilever's existing hair-care
and male toiletries business in the United States. Elsewhere,
Faberge's male fragrance products will extend Unilever's existing
lines, Angus said.
   Meshulam Riklis bought Faberge Inc. for about $180 million in
1984 and added Elizabeth Arden for $700 million at the end of 1987,
Manella said.
   The McGregor Apparel Group that remains includes Botany 500,
Wonderknit, Billy the Kid and Global Licensing, which licenses the
McGregor apparel name, he said.
   Riklis's other properties include E-II Holdings, which has such
brand names as Samsonite luggage and Culligan water softeners, and
McCrory Corp., which owns 1,400 variety stores.

<HEAD>Bush Proposes Tax Incentives For Oil and Gas Producers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is asking Congress to enact
hundreds of millions of dollars in new tax breaks aimed at
stimulating the struggling oil and gas industry and easing the
country's growing dependence on oil imports.
   ``Sufficient energy supplies at reasonable prices are vital to
the economic well-being of this country and to the preservation of
our national security,'' Bush said in remarks accompanying his 1990
budget.
   He called Thursday for full decontrol of natural gas, a
re-examination of off-shore oil drilling projects in several
environmentally sensitive areas, and four separate tax incentives
aimed at finding new oil and gas fields and reclaiming old ones.
   He said tax incentives ``can give the domestic oil and gas
industry the necessary stimulus,'' particularly to the small
producers ``who are so vital to our energy security. Historically,
independent producers have drilled a majority of America's
exploratory wells.''
   Bush, however, called an oil import fee protectionist and said it
amounts to a tax increase on all energy users.
   His four tax incentives would encourage exploration of new oil
and gas fields and reclamation of old fields, and would be phased
out if the price of oil reaches $21 a barrel.
   The spot price for West Texas crude, the benchmark oil, closed at
$17.40 Thursday.
   Charles J. DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute,
called the tax incentives ``a step in the right direction. But they
alone cannot stem the serious decline in domestic petroleum
production.''
   Other steps are required, including opening to exploration
promising federal lands on shore in Alaska and off shore in
California and Florida, he said.
   ``Therefore, it was gratifying to hear once again the president
endorse access to the coastal plain off the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge in Alaska,'' DiBona said.
   Bush's budget would allow new drilling in selected offshore areas
and in the Alaska wildlife refuge.
   The API, however, ``would be concerned about unnecessary delays
in off-shore leasing'' and believes a prompt review of off-shore
leasing would show that exploration and production is
``environmentally safe and should be permitted to proceed,'' DiBona
said.
   While welcomed by another industry official, the measures must
still clear a Congress wrestling with a budget deficit and not known
for rushing to the industry's defense.
   ``It's going to take work. You've got a budget deficit that's a
black hole, and it's difficult to give tax incentives to J.R. Ewing.
That's how it plays in the public mind,'' said Barney White, a vice
president of corporate affairs at Zapata Corp. in Houston, an oil
drilling contractor founded by the president.
   Wells have been shut down because the costs of production exceed
returns, with the number of rigs falling from more than 4,000 in
1981 to less than 1,000 today. Some 150,000 jobs have been lost
since 1986 and domestic production fell from 9.1 million barrels a
day to little more than 8.1 billion a day.
   Bush's package includes a tax credit on intangible drilling
costs, those not directly associated with drilling a well _ such as
hauling equipment. The measure is expected to reduce revenues to the
U.S. Treasury by $200 million in fiscal 1990, $300 million in 1991
and 1992, and $400 million in 1993.
   He also recommends a tax credit for capital expenditures on all
new tertiary enhanced recovery projects _ those that use steam,
carbon dioxide or chemical injectants to remove oil and gas from
fields. The measure is expected to reduce revenues by $50 million or
less a year.
   Tax incentives are proposed to encourage exploration for
independent producers, at an anticipated cost to the government of
$100 million a year.
   Another element of the plan seeks to change oil and gas depletion
rules that discourage the transfer of marginal wells to independent
producers and result in the premature abandonment of producing
wells. The loss of federal revenues is estimated at $50 million or
less annually.

   The stock market fell sharply today, faced with
new worries about inflation and the federal budget.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 17.86 to 2,305.18
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 4 to 1 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 187 up, 811
down and 419 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 34.03 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that producer prices
of finished goods jumped 1 percent in January, for their sharpest
rise since they posted a similar increase in October 1985.
   The figure came in well above advance estimates on Wall Street,
and touched off new concerns on Wall Street about the inflation
outlook.
   Speculation quickly intensified about whether and when the
Federal Reserve might tighten credit further in its campaign against
inflation.
   Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite
direction from interest rates, fell about $10 for each $1,000 in
face value.
   Analysts also cited some disappointment among traders over
President Bush's budget message Thursday night, saying it didn't
live up to hopes that it would contain forceful new ideas about how
to straighten out the government's budget.
   Losers among the blue chips included Ford Motor, down ~ at 54\;
General Electric, down \ at 46}; American Express, down { at 30},
and International Business Machines, down [ at 126\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.97 to 165.16. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.30 at 324.06.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 20.17 to
2,323.04, for its biggest point drop since it lost 23.93 on Jan. 3.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 2 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 504 up, 996 down and 453 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 224.22 million shares, up from 189.42
million in the previous session.

   Wholesale prices skyrocketed at an annual rate
of 12.7 percent in January, the biggest monthly surge in more than
three years, the government said today.
   The Labor Department said the steepest increase in food prices in
a year combined with the largest rise in energy prices in two years
to push up the Producer Price Index 1.0 percent last month.
   Analysts said the rise in food prices partly was due to
after-effects of last summer's drought, while recent increases in
crude oil prices have pushed up energy costs. But the report also
showed strong increases in a variety of other categories.
   ``The report signals that the economy has launched into another
significant racheting upward of inflation,'' said economist Allen
Sinai of the Boston Co. ``There was no comfort in this inflation
report anywhere.''
   It was the biggest increase since an identical surge in October
1985. The index hasn't risen faster in a single month since April
1981, when it shot up 1.1 percent.
   The large gain surprised analysts, who were expecting a moderate
0.3 percent to 0.4 percent increase.
   Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Association of
Wholesaler-Distributors, called the report ``very troublesome.''
   With rising prices at the intermediate and crude levels likely to
trickle down into further increases for finished goods, ``we've got
some high numbers ahead of us,'' Van Dongen said.
   Economist Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co. International
Inc. predicted in advance of the report that any increase
substantially higher than 0.4 percent could roil financial markets.
   In December, wholesale prices climbed at half the January rate _
a still brisk 0.5 percent. That was revised up from an earlier
estimate of 0.4 percent.
   For all of 1988, the Producer Price Index rose 4.0 percent, the
steepest climb in seven years and nearly double the 2.2 percent
increase posted in 1987. Economists are looking for a slightly
faster rate of increase this year.
   Energy prices at the finished goods level, led by an 11.6 percent
jump in home heating oil, climbed 4.9 percent last month. It was the
largest boost since energy cost rose 7.2 percent in January 1987.
   Crude oil prices have climbed about $3 to more than $17 a barrel
over the last several months, but many analysts had predicted that
unusually warm winter weather would hold any heating oil increases
in check.
   Wholesale gasoline prices rose 4.1 percent last month after
falling 3.1 percent in December. Natural gas increased 4.8 percent
after rising 3.3 percent a month earlier.
   The price of food one stop short of the retail level climbed 1.1
percent, the biggest jump since January 1988.
   Egg prices alone soared 20.1 percent and pork prices jumped 11.4
percent.
   Goods other than food and energy collectively increased a
moderate 0.4 percent. There were, however, some sharp increases in
individual catagories, including prescription and over-the-counter
medicines, magazines, household electrical equipment, flatware, toys
and games and automobiles.
   The auto increase had been expected as car dealers phased out
incentive programs.
   The overall January increase left the Producer Price Index for
finished goods at 111.0, meaning a hypothetical selection of goods
costing $100 in 1982 would have cost $111 last month, $1 more than
in December.
   Price indexes for goods at the intermediate level of production
and for crude goods show more inflation in the pipeline.
   Intermediate goods rose 0.9 percent, the steepest monthly
increase in nearly eight years, while crude goods shot up 3.9
percent, the most since August 1980. Crude goods rose 3.4 percent in
December, but those prices fell for three consecutive months prior
to that.
   The heated pace of inflation in the report was likely to raise
concern at the Federal Reserve Board, which has been pushing up
interest rates in an effort to slow the economy and dampen inflation.
   Last month, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan warned Congress that the
central bank's policy would lean toward higher interest rates so
long as labor markets remained tight and factory capacity was
strained.
   The unemployment rate of 5.4 percent last month is near a 14-year
low, pushing wages up in some areas of the country. Use of factory
capacity is at a decade high.
   January's higher wholesale numbers, the first inflation report of
President Bush's term, will likely be seen as disturbing news at the
White House.
   Administration policymakers are counting on lower inflation to
help Bush hold the federal budget deficit down and keep his ``no new
taxes'' pledge.
   The nation will get its first look at inflation on the consumer
level, which includes imports and services, when the Labor
Department releases it Consumer Price Index on Feb. 22.
   David Wyss, an analyst with Data Resources Inc., a Lexington,
Mass., forecasting firm, warned that more food price increases may
be ahead, particularly for meat.
   ``We had all that heavy slaughtering in the fall (after the
drought) and now, of course, we're running out of beef,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, lack of rain east of the Rocky Mountains is shriveling
the winter wheat crop.
   ``It's no big deal yet ... but it's not an encouraging start to
the year,'' Wyss said.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Open Higher On USDA Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened slightly higher
this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade following downward
revisions in the Agriculture Department's projections for world crop
production.
   In a report released Thursday afternoon, the USDA lowered its
estimate for 1988-89 Argentine soybean production to 9 million
metric tons from 11 million metric tons and reduced its estimate for
Argentine corn production to 6 million metric tons from 8 million.
   The government also lowered its 1988-89 Soviet grain production
forecast by 5 million metric tons to 195 million and dropped its
projection for the Oct. 1 U.S. corn stockpile to 1.66 billion
bushels from 1.74 billion bushels.
   The report was considered mildly supportive for corn and soybean
futures and neutral for the wheat market.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 1 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.25{ a bushel; corn was { cent
to 2 cents higher with March at $2.65} a bushel; oats were 2 cents
to 3} cents higher with March at $2.08{ a bushel; soybeans were 2
cents to 5 cents higher with March at $7.49{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were lower in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange with some feeder cattle contracts down the
permitted daily limit of 1.50 cents a pound in a continuing reaction
to Wednesday's USDA report showing a larger-than-expected U.S.
cattle herd. Pork futures were mostly higher in early trading.
   Live cattle were .02 cent to .85 cent lower with the contract for
delivery in April at 74.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 1.22
cents to 1.50 cents lower with March at 81.42 cents a pound; live
hogs were .05 cent lower to .20 cent higher with April at 41.90
cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .28 cent to .38 cent higher
with March at 37.90 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled sharply lower on Thursday.

   Bond prices continued their slide in early
trading today in reaction to a government report that wholesale
prices shot up last month.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, issued on Thursday,
yielded 9.04 percent. The previous benchmark bond fell } point, or
$7.50 per $1,000 face amount, while its yield, which moves in the
opposite direction from its price, rose to 9.16 percent from 8.89
percent late Thursday.
   Bonds were hurt by inflation fears that the Labor Department
raised with its report that wholesale prices skyrocketed at an
annual rate of 12.7 percent, the most in more than three years.
   The key bond had already plunged 1| points on Thursday, the
biggest one-day drop since November, in response to a slumping
dollar and a weak reception for the government's bond auction.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments fell 5-32 to [ point, intermediate maturities fell 11-32
point and long-term issues were down } point, according to Telerate
Inc., the financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 4.39 to 1,127.23.
   In corporate trading, industrials were down. Moody's Investment
Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, fell 0.41
to 298.79.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.81 percent as the
discount rose 4 basis points to 8.51 percent. Yields on six-month
bills rose to 9.01 percent as the discount rose 10 basis points to
8.52. Yields on one-year bills rose to 9.17 percent as the discount
rose 9 basis points to 8.50 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 9 3-16 percent, up from 9[ percent late
Thursday.

   Top administration officials today emphasized
President Bush's willingness to negotiate with Congress over details
of his $1.16 trillion budget while Democrats said the White House
had underestimated next year's deficit by $20 billion.
   ``We're trying to work with the Congress to resolve the tough
issues,'' Budget Director Richard Darman said in an NBC interview
the morning after Bush's nationally televised address to both houses
of Congress.
   Added White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, ``Now I realize
Congress may try and suggest it can't be done but I think we're
ready to sit down, negotiate and work with whatever slight
differences they might have on the budget to fulfill our commitment
to the American people.''
   How slight the differences turn out to be won't be known for
several days, as Democrats sift through the details of Bush's plan
calling for no new taxes, increases in scattered domestic programs
such as education, the environment and the war on drugs and a $2.6
billion curtailment in the defense budget that President Reagan
bequeathed him.
   Democrats reacted cordially but warily to Bush's proposals at
first, although the president's call for a cut in the capital gains
tax was criticized by several lawmakers.
   But after a night of crunching numbers, Senate Democrats issued a
report claiming that Bush's spending plan underestimated the deficit
by $20 billion. They said the administration had relied on overly
optimistic assumptions about the economy.
   Bush says his plan would result in a deficit for the 1990 fiscal
year of $94.8 billion, not counting the proceeds from the sale of
certain federal assets. The Democrats said the figure was really
$115 billion.
   Bush himself left budget politics aside in favor of a brief trip
to Canada. But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters
the president was ``very pleased'' with the initial reaction.
   Fitzwater said that ``the main thing is to sit down and start
talking'' on forging a bipartisan budget agreement.
   ``We have every reason to believe the Democrats will want to be
encouraging about negotiations,'' Fitzwater said.
   That was in line with Bush's offer, made in his speech, to ``work
day and night'' if necessary to tackle the deficit.
   ``The people didn't send us here to bicker,'' the new president
said Thursday night in a nationally televised speech before a joint
session of the House and Senate. ``It's time to govern.''
   Initial Democratic reaction to the new president and his $1.16
trillion budget was cordial but wary. Republicans cheered when he
renewed his campaign call for a cut in capital gains taxes. Most
Democrats sat silently in their seats.
   Fights also are likely over Bush's proposed $5 billion cut in the
Medicare insurance program for the elderly, and his renewed
commitment to the Star Wars missile defense program.
   Democrats promised cooperation _ and left it at that.
   ``That does not mean obedience. It does mean our honest help and
our very best advice,'' said Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, who
presides over a House with a 261-175 Democratic majority.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole termed the president's budget
blueprint ``not the final answer, it's the starting point.'' He
added, ``Congress can swat it away, or it can grasp the president's
hand in the true spirit of cooperation.''
   The Bush budget envisions a deficit of $91.1 billion, beneath the
$100 billion mandated in the federal anti-deficit law. But Bush's
deficit figure is predicated on rosy economic assumptions carried
over from the Reagan administration _ assumptions of continued
strong growth that many economists question.
   The president's speech was not a State of the Union address in
the literal sense. But it served as one, from the pageantry of a
House chamber filled with lawmakers, the diplomatic corps, Supreme
Court justices and hundreds of guests, to the breadth of his remarks.
   ``We Americans have only begun our mission of goodness and
greatness,'' he concluded.
   Bush said he would ``proceed with caution'' in his dealings with
the Soviet Union, but said, ``We will not miss any opportunity for
peace.'' He vowed to work for the elimination of chemical weapons
and said he would ``stand firm'' for democracy in Nicaragua and
elsewhere in Central America.
   The new president called for trimming $2.6 billion from President
Reagan's final Pentagon budget, adding a few programs for education,
aid to the homeless and the environment, all areas that fit in his
campaign promise of a ``kinder, gentler nation.''
   However, his overall education budget would fail to keep up with
inflation, and his child-care credit is limited to only the poorest
of families _ those making $10,000 a year or less.
   He urged enactment of measures to revitalize inner cities,
declared a fiercer war on drugs and took a page from Jesse Jackson's
campaign text when he said to kids living in the inner cities:
``Keep hope alive.''
   Bush's Pentagon spending plan calls for an increase next year
that would allow spending to rise with inflation but no higher.
``After that increases above inflation will be required,'' he said.
   In their immediate post-mortems on Thursday night, Republicans
and Democrats alike predicted that Bush's spending blueprint would
pave the way for negotiations with Congress.
   ``The Bush budget is a tough one giving first priority to deficit
reduction,'' Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, senior Republican on
the House Budget Committee said. ``It will be subject to lots of
negotiation, but it is an important step toward a deficit solution.''
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas., who joined Wright in delivering the
official Democratic response, said his party will work with the
president. ``That doesn't mean we won't disagree. There'll be some
sharp, principled disagreements among Democrats and Republicans over
one of the greatest challenges America has ever faced,'' he said.

<UNK>FDIC Sues Bert Lance, Company For Allegedly Defaulting On Loans</UNK>
<DATELINE>ROME, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has charged
former White House budget director Bert Lance and a Calhoun company
with defaulting on loan payments to a now-defunct Tennessee bank.
   The U.S. District Court suit seeks $1.5 million from Lance and
the Kris Company Inc. It alleges that Lance and the company
defaulted on payments to the United American Bank of Knoxville for
four separate loans and renewal agreements dating to late 1981.
   The suit, filed in Rome, was made public Thursday after U.S.
District Judge Harold L. Murphy denied a request from the
government's lawyers to keep it secret for 20 days. The government
argued that media attention would adversely affect the FDIC's
ability to collect the money.
   Lance said Friday he had not seen a copy of the suit.
   ``However, I feel I must comment to the extent that over the
course of the last four years I have made significant payments and
good-faith efforts to pay all my debts in full,'' he said.
   ``I have not made any efforts to compromise any debt for less
than the full amount. But because of certain disputes about the
application of payments, I have been unable to come to any
agreement. Those disputes were not about my willingness to pay any
debt that was due in full.''
   He added, ``I consider it unfortunate that the FDIC took the
action it took, but I remain determined to stand up for the rights I
believe I ought to have. I am hopeful we can resolve our differences
as soon as possible.''
   Lance declined to talk about the Kris Company Inc., saying it was
a ``personal company.''
   The Tennessee banking commissioner assumed control of United
American Bank six years ago, and the FDIC later took over various
UAB loans, including the ones to Lance and the Kris Company.
   The FDIC suit listed four notes with principal balances of
$348,816, $196,656, $227,531 and $474,664, totaling $1,247,667. The
government also is seeking accrued interest as of Jan. 20 and per
diem interest since then.
   Lance and the company were given 10 days to pay the $1,509,000
before the amount is increased by 15 percent for attorney's fees,
FDIC lawyers said.
   The lawyers also asked Murphy for control of the real property
used to secure the loans, but no action has been taken on that
request.
   Lance was a Calhoun banker and former commissioner of the Georgia
Department of Transportation when he was named White House budget
director after fellow Georgian Jimmy Carter was elected president in
1976. He resigned in September 1977 amid allegations about his
banking practices.
   Three years ago, Lance agreed to pay a fine of $50,000 and not
work at any federally insured bank in a settlement resulting from
charges of bank fraud brought against him by the federal Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency.

   The stock market showed a broad loss today, faced
with new worries about inflation and the federal budget.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 15.54 to 2,307.50
by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 3 to 1 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 338 up, 971 down and
491 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported that producer prices of finished
goods jumped 1 percent in January, for their sharpest rise since
they posted a similar increase in October 1985.
   The figure came in well above advance estimates on Wall Street,
and touched off new concerns on Wall Street about the inflation
outlook.
   Speculation quickly intensified about whether and when the
Federal Reserve might tighten credit further in its campaign against
inflation.
   Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite
direction from interest rates, fell about $10 for each $1,000 in
face value.
   Analysts also cited some disappointment among traders over
President Bush's budget message Thursday night, saying it didn't

<TEXT>
   A surge in inflation at the wholesale level
unleashed a storm of selling in stock and Treasury bond trading
today but gave the dollar a boost on currency markets.
   Disappointment over President Bush's budget proposals was cited
as another factor in today's losses.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average skidded 15.54 to
2,307.50 by noon EST. Declining stocks outnumbered gainers by nearly
3 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Sellers took over after the Labor Department reported wholesale
prices skyrocketed at an annual rate of 12.7 percent in January, the
biggest monthly surge in more than three years.
   The government said the steepest increase in food prices in a
year combined with the largest rise in energy prices in two years to
push up the Producer Price Index 1.0 percent last month. It was the
biggest increase since an identical surge in October 1985.
   ``The number was much larger than anyone expected,'' said
Elizabeth G. Reiners, a vice president for money market research at
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Traders were concerned that the Federal Reserve, seeing the surge
in producer prices, would drive interest rates higher to try to
corral inflation.
   In the credit markets, today's inflation report deepened
Thursay's losses, which followed a disappointing Treasury bond
auction.
   The Treasury's 30-year bond sank nearly ~ point, or about $8.75
per each $1,000 in face value, after having fallen 1| points on
Wednesday. The bond's yield soared to 9.07 percent from 8.89 percent
late Wednesday.
   But the inflation report was bullish for the dollar, which tends
to rise on speculation that the Fed will tighten credit. Higher U.S.
interest rates make the dollar more attractive to foreign buyers.
   In New York, the dollar rose after the report was released. At
midday, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.8605 West German
marks, up from 1.8475 late Thursday, and at 128.45 Japanese yen, up
from 127.93 late Thursday.
   On Wall Street, some investors were disappointed by Bush's budget
message Thursday night, saying it didn't live up to hopes that it
would contain forceful new ideas about how to straighten out the
government's budget.
   There also was concern about Bush's plans on foreign markets. The
dollar declined in early trading overseas and prices fell sharply on
London's stock exchange.

   The Army said Friday it has again raised its
reliance on competitive bidding for the award of procurement
contracts.
   In a report to Congress on fiscal 1988 actions, the Army said
$18.45 billion _ or 61.6 percent of its total $29.94 billion in
procurement dollars _ was awarded to contractors after competitive
bidding.
   This was an increase from 58.8 percent in fiscal 1987 and a jump
over the 41.2 percent awarded on a competitive basis in fiscal 1983,
a year before the Army began a drive to limit the use of sole-source
contracts.
   More than 93 percent of the individual contracts signed during
fiscal 1988 were awarded after competitive bidding, up from 88
percent in fiscal 1987 and 48 percent in fiscal 1983, the Army said.

<HEAD>Japanese Automakers Moving From Exports To Overseas Expansion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a year of booming domestic sales and further
declines in exports, Japanese automakers are introducing a fistful
of new models and boosting overseas production to try to capture
more of the global car market.
   Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi and Mazda all saw increased
sales in Japan last year but reported sluggish exports, largely due
to the continued high value of the yen.
   Exports, which fell 3.2 percent in 1988, are expected to continue
dwindling this year, but not just because of the strong yen, which
makes Japanese products more expensive overseas.
   ``While shipments to Europe continue to be firm, exports to the
United States will encounter a more highly competitive environment
due to a gradual downturn in the American economy,'' Nissan
President Yutaka Kume said in January.
   Japanese companies produce about 29 percent of the world's autos,
according to statistics compiled by the Motor Vehicle Manufacturing
Association of America and Japan Automobile Manfacturing Association.
   Half of the 12.7 million cars, trucks and buses made in Japan in
1988 were exported. In 1987, the last year for which comparative
figures are available, 12.2 million motor vehicles were made in
Japan, well ahead of 10.9 million produced in the United States.
   Exchange rates and continuing restrictions on exports to the
United States have led Japanese automakers to make the 1980s the
decade of ``transplanting,'' or producing autos in the markets where
they will be sold.
   The voluntary export quotas were imposed beginning in fiscal 1981
to give U.S. automakers breathing room to recover from growing
Japanese competition. But the Japanese have responded by relocating
production overseas _ they already have established eight factories
in North America _ and have fallen short of their 2.3 million
vehicle annual quota in each of the last two years.
   Expansion planned for this year in North America would bring
transplant output to about 1 million cars annually, with expected
growth to 2 million within two years.
   ``Transplants are crucial to lessening trade friction, and they
are also an intelligent alternative to exports, which have become
increasingly problematic due to yen appreciation,'' said Koji Endo,
a Nomura Securities analyst, in a February report on the auto
industry.
   Automakers also have a strong base in the ever-hungry domestic
market, which grew a phenomenal 10 percent in 1988 and it continues
to be fueled by vigorous consumption, increasing personal income and
leisure time, more new models and high turnover of private cars.
   Toyota, which is aiming for 10 percent of the world market, this
year is opening production in the Philippines and a joint venture
with Volkswagen in West Germany. Overseas production is expected to
surge 82 percent in 1989 and Toyota's joint venture with General
Motors Corp., New United Motor Manufacturing in California, foresees
80 percent growth this year.
   This fall Toyota will market its new Lexus in an attmept to
further penetrate the U.S. market for luxury cars in the $20,000
$40,000 range.
   Nissan has the same strategy with two new cars under the Infiniti
label, which will be marketed this year to challenge Mercedes, BMW
and Jaguar.
   ``We have an image in the United States as a cheap truck maker,
so we're introducing the entirely new Infiniti sales network to shed
that image,'' Nissan's Kume said in an interview.
   Last year, Nissan saw overall exports tumble 11.2 percent,
including a 36.5 percent plunge in the U.S. export market, Japan's
biggest.
   But Nissan is banking on a slew of new models to boost exports
and increase transplant production. The four-door Maxima and
two-door Silvia sports car have debuted in recent months, and the
Infiniti models will join them in the United States.
   Nissan will expand overseas production 15.1 percent this year and
the automaker will expand its Smyrna, Tenn. plant by 1990 to build
two new models for the U.S. market.
   Honda, the top-selling Japanese car in the United States, started
Japan's luxury-car assault with its Acura Legend in 1986. Last year
it began importing to Japan cars it produced in Ohio, and plans to
increase such imports tenfold to 50,000 annually by 1991.
   Honda's production overseas this year will be little changed,
although it will inaugurate production of the five-door Concerto
developed jointly with the Austin Rover Group in Britain.
   Mazda Motor plans to keep production at 1.22 million cars,
lowering exports but raising production at its U.S. plant in
Michigan by more than 50 percent. Mazda does not reveal its global
production figures.
   President Norimasa Furuta told reporters in January that the
automaker would continue developing oversears projects and examine
new ventures with its long-time business partner, Ford Motor Co.
   Mazda produces Ford-badged cars in Japan for sale here and export
elsewhere in Asia. It also is introducing a lightweight, two-seat
sports car this year in Japan and the United States.
   Mitsubishi Motors also expects lower exports, but predicts a 47.5
jump in overseas production this year, including its joint
Diamond-Star Motors venture with Chrysler Corp.
   Fuji Heavy Industries and Isuzu Motors' joint venture,
Subaru-Isuzu Automotive, goes on-line in Indiana this September.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Lower, Gold Prices Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rallied in late European trading
Friday after news of a higher-than-expected January U.S. producer
price index rekindled speculation of a rise in U.S. interest rates.
   Gold prices fell.
   The dollar initially weakened because of market disappointment
that President George Bush's projected deficit for fiscal 1990
turned out to be little different from the Reagan administration's
projection last month.
   However, afternoon news that the U.S. producer price index rose 1
percent, far higher than an expected 0.4-percent rise, triggered a
dollar rally.
   Traders reasoned that the price rises meant the U.S. Federal
Reserve bank would raise interest rates to stop inflationary
pressures, and this prospect made the dollar attractive.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar closed sharply lower at 127.65 yen, down 1.74 yen from
Thursday's close of 129.39 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted
higher at 128.15 yen.
   Other late dollar rates, compared with late Thurday's rates were:
1.8595 West German marks, up from 1.8585; 1.5778 Swiss francs, down
from 1.5802; 6.3200 French francs, down from 6.3225; 2.0960 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.0990; 1,353.75 Italian lire, down from
1,355.50; and, 1.1857 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1832.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7547, compared with
$1.7540 Thursday.
   Gold was trading in London at a late bid price of $391 a troy
ounce, down from $394.25 bid late Thursday.
   In Zurich, the late bid price was $389.50, down from $394.25 bid
late Thursday.

   Fixed-rate home mortgages currently are
averaging 10.56 percent, according to a national survey released
Friday by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   That rate was up slightly from a rate of 10.55 percent last week.
   On one-year adjustable rate mortgages, lenders were asking an
average initial rate of 8.61 percent this week, up from 8.56 percent
the week before, Freddie Mac said.

<HEAD>Securities Group Will Seek To Block Fed's Plan Broadening Bank Powers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities Industry Association said Friday
it would file suit to block the Federal Reserve Board from
broadening the power of commercial banks to deal in securities.
   The association, representing nearly 600 stock brokerages and
investment banks in the United States and Canada, intends to file
suit later this month to overturn the Fed's decision enabling bank
holding companies to underwrite corporate debt and equity on a
limited basis, according to a statement by SIA President Edward I.
O'Brien and the group's chairman, Hardwick Simons.
   The suit will be filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington, D.C.
   In a ruling last month, Fed governors voted to allow banks to
underwrite corporate debt through affiliates but severely limited
the amount of underwriting the subsidiaries may handle.
   The ruling was significant because it continued the evolution in
the banking industry's financial powers.
   The distinctions between the securities business and commercial
banking spelled out in the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act have
blurred over time as each of the two industries have been granted
permission to expand their services. The Fed increasingly has taken
the lead in giving banks broader powers, as Congress generally has
not done so.
   The SIA suit will attempt to persuade the court that the Fed's
action was ``a dangerous piecemeal undermining of the safety
barriers'' of the nearly 55-year old Glass-Steagall, the statement.
   ``We believe the nation's law should be amended, if necessary, by
Congress, not by regulatory and administrative organizations, such
as the Federal Reserve,'' the statement read.
   ``Legal issues aside, it is absurd to let banks risk their
capital in the volatile securities market at the very time they are
still struggling with the developing-nations' debt problems, and the
economy-threatening problems of the thrift industry,'' they stated.

<HEAD>Cable TV Companies Announce Revised Merger Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cable companies United Artists Communications
Inc. and United Cable Television Corp. have agreed on new terms for
their often-delayed, billion-dollar merger, sweetening the amount of
cash available to United Cable shareholders.
   Analysts and company officials estimated the deal, which would
create the nation's third-largest cable company, would be worth $1.6
billion to $1.7 billion. United Cable also has an estimated $600
million in debt.
   The new company, to be called United Artists Entertainment Co.,
would have about 2.4 million basic subscribers, placing it behind
only Tele-Communications Inc. and American Television and
Communications Inc., a Time Inc. unit.
   The revised terms disclosed late Thursday are subject to approval
by the companies' boards and approval of the board of
Tele-Communications Inc., which owns stakes in both and would have
52 percent to 55 percent of the new company.
   The revised plan boosts by $3.50 a share to $38.50 the amount of
cash that will be available for about half of United Cable's common
stock.
   United Cable has about 44 million shares of fully-diluted common
stock, and about 41 percent is held by either United Cable or
Tele-Communications.
   The revised plan would give a combination of stock and rights to
sell the stock under certain condition conditions in exchange for
each of the remaining shares of United Cable stock, the same terms
as were proposed previously.
   United Artists Communications stock would be swapped on a
one-for-one basis for stock in the new company, the same as in the
earlier plan.
   In midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, United Cable
was up 12{ cents a share at $37. United Artists Communications was
unchanged at $30.75 a share in national over-the-counter trading.
   The companies first announced plans to merge in a stock
transaction Oct. 18, 1987, but the deal was called off two days
later in the wake of the Oct. 19 stock market crash.
   A new merger agreement was announced in March 1988 and amended in
September, but the companies disclosed Jan. 31 they would be unable
to meet a Feb. 28 completion deadline because of regulatory delays.
   Analysts had speculated United Cable would seek a higher price
because prices being paid for cable systems have continued
increasing sharply.
   John Tinker, an analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New York, said
the extra cash should allow the deal to be completed.
   ``There has been a sweetener and that will make it a lot easier
all around,'' he said. He noted the two companies already are
sharing office space in Denver and said, ``It would be hard for the
deal not to go through.''
   In announcing the latest revision, the companies said the new
deadline for completing the merger is May 31.
   ``This agreement will benefit all parties involved and should aid
us in completing our merger in a timely fashion,'' Stewart Blair,
president and chief executive of United Artists, and Gene Schneider,
chairman and chief executive of United Cable, said in a joint
statement.
   In addition to its cable interests, United Artists operates one
of the nation's largest motion picture theater chains.

   A seedy member of the turnip family has caught the attention of
Midwestern farmers, who contemplate competing with Canadians in the
growing market for canola and the cooking oil squeezed from its
seeds.
   U.S. citizens already consume Canadian canola seed in such
products as Puritan cooking oil, said Jack Ferris at Michigan State
University's agriculture economics department.
   ``It's low in saturated fats. It's marketable. There seems to be
a growing interest in using canola oil not only in the food industry
but in the fast food industry,'' Ferris said Thursday.
   ``Our only problem is quality. U.S.-grown canola was not meeting
the standards established in Canada,'' he said.
   Researchers believe a cool climate is the key, and they've turned
to farmers in Michigan's chilly Upper Peninsula for the answer.
   Michigan State University Cooperative Extension agent Ralph
Duffek in Houghton said Thursday he is telling his farmers that
canola's seed production is so high _ 1,800 pounds per acre _ that
at 80 cents a pound it outperforms even soybeans. One researcher
estimates that canola can cash in at a $291-per- acre profit,
compared with $200 an acre for soybeans, he said.
   Duffek said there is a ready market for canola oil and for the
crushed seed as a feed supplement for cattle.
   What he can't guarantee, however, is how Canadians will welcome
canola competition from across the border.
   Western Canadians have been growing the mustard-like winter crop
for years, crushing its tiny round seeds into cooking oils and
protein additives for cattle feed.
   ``The only skepticism that I have heard and somewhat share is
since the bulk of the canola is grown and processed in Canada,
unless the trade agreements are worked out, the U.S. producers could
be at a disadvantage,'' Duffek said.
   Archer Daniels Midland Co. Inc. is one of Canada's largest canola
processors. Only one of the company's plants, in Ontario, actually
is crushing the grain now, said Don Wright with the company's grain
marketing department.
   Archer Daniels Midland is devoting more and more of its resources
to canola processing, at the expense of soybeans, as the low-fat
crop catches on, Wright said.
   ``We've had canola for some time. It's used in Canada for
margarines, cooking oils, salad oils and the like. But when I came
here two years ago, ADM had only six or eight suppliers of it,''
Wright said. ``Now I have a source list of 20 to 25 people. I think
it's really coming along.''
   Kentucky and Illinois are the chief producers of canola in the
United States. Kentucky growers planted about 2,000 acres of canola
in 1987, then 8,000 acres as it caught on in 1988, according to a
study by the University of Kentucky.
   Farmers in Indiana, Tennessee, Ohio and Michigan so far have only
dabbled in the crop.
   Canola growers in all of Michigan probably harvested less than
5,000 bushels of seed last year, said Herm Geers, president of the
Michigan Agriculture Commodities Inc. in Lansing.
   ``The tough thing about a new crop is what if you only get 5,000
to 8,000 bushels? Most crushers don't want to switch over from one
day to the next. Frankly, we don't have the production it takes,''
Geers said.
   Yet Geers is pushing for the crop's development in Michigan and
has pledged that his company will continue to clean, store and
broker the crop if agriculture officials will continue to promote it.
   ``The potential is there,'' he said.
   Canola, a member of the rape seed family, typically is planted in
the fall and harvested in early summer, leaving farmers enough time
to put in soybeans the rest of the growing season.
   ``We feel that winter canola offers a real potential for becoming
a crop in Michigan,'' Duffek said.

<HEAD>Honeywell Reports $483 Million Loss for Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honeywell Inc., the struggling automation
company, said Friday it lost $483 million in the fourth quarter,
mainly because of one-time charges, and posted a loss of $435
million for the year as a whole.
   The loss was even larger than investors had expected and the
stock was off $2.12{ a share at $64.87{ in afternoon trading on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Honeywell had warned in December that its net loss for the year
``could'' exceed $400 million.
   James J. Renier, the chairman and chief executive, said the
company had a difficult year and was now concentrating on businesses
where it had a large share of the market.
   ``We are looking forward to a year of significant improvement in
1989,'' he said in a statement.
   Honeywell makes thermostats, gauges and other types of controls
and guidance systems for homes, buildings, industry, aerospace and
the military. It has a minority interest in Bull HN Information
Systems Inc., the computer company.
   In the fourth quarter, Honeywell reported a net loss of $483
million, compared with net income of $86 million, or $1.99 per
share, in the fourth quarter of 1987. Sales in the fourth quarter
were $1.93 billion, down from $1.99 billion in 1987.
   For the full year the net loss of $435 million compared with net
income of $254 million in 1987. Sales were $7.15 billion, up from
$6.69 billion in 1987.
   Total fourth-quarter orders for the company increased, compared
with fourth-quarter 1987.
   In December, Honeywell announced that, after posting a $67.1
million profit for the first nine months of 1988, it could lose more
than $400 million in 1988 and would cut 1,200 of its 79,000
employees. At the same time, the company said that James J. Renier,
who was already chief executive, would take over the chairmanship
from Edson Spencer, who retired.
   The company said its fourth-quarter loss includes:
   _ An income tax provision of $158 million.
   _ A provision for discontinuance of product lines of $126 million.
   _ Other charges of approximately $115 million, including the
costs of work force reductions.

<HEAD>Citibank, Chemical Join Prime Rate Hike To 11 Percent From 10.5 Percent</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 4 grafs to UPDATE with other major banks announcing
increases.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's biggest banks today increased their
prime lending rates to 11 percent from 10.5 percent, reflecting the
continuing rise of interest rates on financial markets.
   It was the first increase this year in the prime rate, which
banks use as a benchmark for setting interest on a variety of
consumer and corporate loans, and put the rate at its highest since
it was 10.75 percent in late 1984.
   The last increase, from 10 percent to 10.5 percent, was Nov. 28.
   Chicago-based Continental Bank and Republic National Bank of New
York were the first to boost their prime rates and soon were
followed by Citibank, the nation's largest bank, Chemical Bank and
other major banks.
   Rates have been rising due partly to the Federal Reserve's
tightening of credit in an attempt to curb inflation. The prime rate
reflects a bank's costs of borrowing money, including interest it
pays on savings accounts and certificates of deposit, and generally
reflects more subtle increases in other interest rates.
   The rate is watched closely because bankers use it as a basis for
calculating interest on corporate loans and for determining many
types of fixed and adjustable-rate consumer loans, such as home
equity loans.
   Republic said it increased its prime because of its rising cost
of money. At Continental, Bank, the former Continental Illinois
National Bank, officials said they wanted to bring the bank's rates
in line with those on money markets.
   Chemical Banking Corp., which owns Chemical Bank, is the nation's
sixth-largest bank holding company.
   Continental is owned by Continental Illinois Corp., the nation's
14th-largest holding company, while Republic's parent, Republic New
York Corp., ranked 27th in terms of total assets held June 30, 1988.

   The stock market fell sharply today, faced with
new worries about inflation and rising interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 30.72 to 2,292.32
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 4 to 1 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 310 up, 1,170 down
and 448 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported that producer prices of finished
goods jumped 1 percent in January, for their sharpest rise since
they posted a similar increase in October 1985.
   The figure came in well above advance estimates on Wall Street,
and touched off new concerns on Wall Street about the inflation
outlook.
   Speculation quickly intensified about whether and when the
Federal Reserve might tighten credit further in its campaign against
inflation.
   Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite
direction from interest rates, fell more than $5 for each $1,000 in
face value.
   And numerous large banks across the country raised their prime
lending rates from 10{ percent to 11 percent.
   Analysts also cited some disappointment among traders over
President Bush's budget message Thursday night, saying it didn't
live up to hopes that it would contain forceful new ideas about how
to straighten out the government's budget.
   Losers among the blue chips included Ford Motor, down 1[ at 54;
General Electric, down | at 46]; American Express, down 1[ at 30[,
and Philip Morris, down 1| at 107|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.79 to 164.34. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 2.38 at 322.98.

<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices closed sharply lower Friday
on the Chicago Board of Trade amid slack demand for what one analyst
called ``fairly comfortable'' supplies of soybean meal.
   Grain futures prices closed higher following downward revisions
in the Agriculture Department's forecasts for world crop production.
   The soybean complex rallied early in the session, then turned
down at midday despite a lack of significant news in the market.
   ``The soybean meal is bringing about this weakness,'' said Mario
Balletto, soybean market analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
Inc. in New York.
   ``We're looking at a fairly comfortable supply situation here in
the near term and that's really starting to pressure the market, and
the market's breaking down.''
   In a report released Thursday afternoon, the USDA lowered several
of its estimates for global grain production including downward
revisions in its projections for Argentine corn and soybean
production and Soviet grain production.
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents to 6} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.28{ a bushel; corn was { cent
to 1{ cents higher with March at $2.66 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court on Friday ruled that
the Federal Communications Commission had the authority to repeal
the broadcast Fairness Doctrine, but the court sidestepped the
overriding issue of the doctrine's constitutionality.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
upheld on statutory grounds the FCC's August 1987 repeal of the
40-year-old doctrine, which required broadcasters to provide
balanced coverage of controversial issues.
   The commission had said the doctrine no longer served the public
interest and was unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds.
   In its ruling Friday, the appeals court said the FCC had the
authority to decide whether the doctrine served the public interest.
But the three-judge panel decided not to address the constitutional
issue, which had been a primary basis for the court challenge to the
FCC's decision.
   The FCC's ruling had been precipitated when an anti-nuclear group
filed a Fairness Doctrine complaint against WTVH, a Meredith Corp.
television station in Syracuse, N.Y.
   Gigi B. Sohn, an attorney for the Media Access Project, which
represented the anti-nuclear Syracuse Peace Council, said Friday's
ruling paved the way for a bill pending in Congress that would write
the Fairness Doctrine into law.
   ``The big victory here is that any law that Congress passes ...
will not be presumptively unconstitutional,'' Sohn said. ``We
believe the court was wrong about the statutory findings, and we'll
deal with that in Congress or the Supreme Court or both.''
   Congress is expected to make the doctrine a law again this year,
but President Bush has said he would veto such a measure.
   The FCC, in a statement, said the court's decision was ``a
victory for the free speech rights of all Americans. The court has
vindicated the public's right to receive broadcast press coverage
free from government interference.''
   But a constitutional rights organization called it a ``hollow win
for the FCC.'' The court's decision ``leaves the door wide open for
congressional action to codify the Fairness Doctrine,'' said John H.
Buchanan, chairman of People for the American Way.
   The National Association of Broadcasters welcomed the ruling and
said that in the absence of the doctrine ``the vast majority of
broadcasters will continue to be fair in covering their communities
_ and they will do so without government regulation.''
   All three judges concurred in Friday's ruling, but Chief Judge
Patricia M. Wald dissented in part.
   The FCC in 1984 sided with the Syracuse Peace Council when the
group contended WTVH had not presented conflicting views when the
station ran a series of advertisements in 1982 that said the Nine
Mile 2 nuclear power plant was a ``sound investment for New York.''
   Meredith petitioned the FCC for reconsideration in 1985 on
grounds the doctrine violated its First Amendment rights. But the
FCC denied the petition, saying the constitutional question should
be left in the hands of Congress and the courts.
   However, the federal appeals court in Washington remanded the
case back to the FCC in January 1987, ordering the agency to
consider the constitutional challenge.
   Congress stepped in and wrote the doctrine into law, but
President Reagan vetoed the bill in June 1987. The FCC ruled in
August in the Meredith case that the doctrine violated the First
Amendment and did not serve the public interest as defined by the
1934 Communications Act.
   The anti-nuclear group appealed to the court, where the case was
joined on both sides by a host of media and citizens rights
organizations.
   Writing for the court Friday, Judge Stephen F. Williams said that
even though the FCC had ``intertwined'' constitutionality and public
interest in statements supporting its Meredith decision, the FCC
nonetheless was justified in not deciding the constitutional issue.
   ``In making a public interest judgment under the Communications
Act, the commission is exercising both its congressionally delegated
power and its expertise; it clearly enjoys broad deference on issues
of both fact and policy,'' Williams wrote.
   ``We conclude that the FCC's decision that the Fairness Doctrine
no longer served the public interest was neither arbitrary,
capricious nor an abuse of discretion, and are convinced that it
would have acted on that finding to terminate the doctrine even in
the absence of its belief that the doctrine was no longer
constitutional. Accordingly, we uphold the commission without
reaching the constitutional issues.''
   Williams said it was well established that American courts are
not to ``pass upon a constitutional question ... if there is also
present some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of.''
   Judge Kenneth W. Starr, while concurring with the court's
opinion, said in a lengthy separate opinion that he felt the court
should have addressed the constitutional question.
   The FCC had struck down two parts of the Fairness Doctrine. The
first required broadcasters ``to provide coverage of vitally
important controversial issues of interest in the community served
by the licensees.'' The second said broadcasters must ``provide a
reasonable opportunity for the presentation of contrasting
viewpoints on such issues.''
   In her partial dissent, Wald said the FCC, in inviting broadcast
community response to its Fairness Doctrine repeal, had failed to
give broadcasters proper notice that it would be looking at the
first part of the doctrine. She also said the repeal of part one was
``the very model of arbitrary and capricious decision making.''
   Wald said the FCC appeared to have been motivated by a fear of
``doing things halfway'' if it only eliminated the second half of
the doctrine.
   ``This is deregulation running riot,'' Wald wrote.

<HEAD>Unilever Signs $1.55 Billion Deal For Faberge Perfume, Cosmetics
Lines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unilever Group, the European conglomerate, has
agreed to buy the Faberge and Elizabeth Arden lines of toiletries,
cosmetics and fragrances for $1.55 billion in cash from New York
investor Meshulam Riklis, it was announced Friday.
   The deal marks the latest major European acquisition of a U.S.
company and continues the worldwide consolidation in the cosmetics
business.
   Unilever, a British-Dutch consumer products giant with $31
billion in 1987 sales, bought Chesebrough-Pond's Inc. for $3.1
billion two years ago and owns such brand names as Vaseline, Pond's,
Elizabeth Taylor's Passion, Cerruti and White Shoulders.
   Faberge Inc. and its independent subsidiary, Elizabeth Arden,
include brands such as Visible Difference, Chloe, Lagerfeld,
Flawless Finish, Aqua Net, Brut, McGregor and Babe.
   Combined sales of the units being sold totaled more than $800
million in the fiscal year that ended last month, and operating
profit was $100 million, Faberge said.
   ``From Unilever's perspective, it makes a lot of sense,'' said
Bonita Austin, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder in New York. She said
Unilever would be able to get more mileage out of the Faberge and
Arden brands than Riklis had because of its strengths in
distribution, manufacturing and research.
   ``The Faberge and Elizabeth Arden businesses provide an excellent
fit with Unilever's existing personal products operations
worldwide,'' Michael Angus, Unilever's chairman, said in a statement.
   The Faberge transaction is expected to be completed in 90 days
and is subject to the government regulatory clearances. A month ago,
the two companies announced they were in discussions which might
lead to the sale of some of Faberge's businesses to Unilever.
   Unilever is buying all of Faberge Inc. except for the McGregor
Apparel Group, which includes clothing lines such as Botany 500,
Wonderknit and Billy the Kid. Those units have sales of about $240
million and $20 million in operating profits.
   Unilever will get the Faberge name and Faberge Inc. probably will
switch its name to McGregor as part of the deal, according to Daniel
Manella, Faberge Inc.'s chairman and chief executive.
   Among other recent big acquisitions by Europeans, British
Petroleum PLC spent $8 billion for the 45 percent of Standard Oil
Co. it did not already own and West Germany's Hoechst AG bought
Celanese Corp. for $2.9 billion in 1987.
   In the consolidating cosmetics industry, Beecham Group PLC sold
Diane Von Furstenberg fragrances to Revlon Group Inc. in 1987 and
American Cyanamid Corp. sold the Jacqueline Cochran fragrance and
treatment lines, including the distribution rights to the Nina Ricci
line, to Sanofi Inc.
   Meshulam Riklis's Riklis Family Corp. bought Faberge Inc. for
about $180 million in 1984 and added Elizabeth Arden for $700
million at the end of 1987.
   Riklis's other properties include nine companies. Those companies
include Samsonite luggage and Culligan water softeners, which he
bought among others for $1.2 billion last year from American Brands
Inc.'s E-II Holdings Inc., and McCrory Corp., which owns 1,400
variety stores.

<HEAD>January Wholesale Prices Up At Fastest Pace In Three Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>EDs: To UPDATE with Bush comments, INSERTS two grafs after 5th
graf bgng ``The first inflation ... Also on general news wires.'' ^By NANCY
BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wholesale prices in January shot up at their
fastest pace in nearly three years, the government said Friday in a
report that analysts warned could signal spiraling inflation in 1989.
   January's unexpected 1 percent rise in the Producer Price Index
for finished goods was the biggest monthly increase since an
identical surge in October 1985 and was equivalent to a 12.7 percent
annual rate of inflation, the Labor Department said.
   The increase was paced by the steepest increase in food prices in
a year, the largest rise in energy prices in two years and sharply
higher costs in a variety of other categories as well.
   The report roiled financial markets, unleashing a storm of
selling in stocks and Treasury bonds, as traders became concerned
that the Federal Reserve Board would drive interest rates higher to
try to control inflation.
   The first inflation report since the change in administrations
brought no good news for President Bush, who just a day earlier
unveiled budget and deficit-reduction plans pinned on optimistic
assumptions for falling inflation and a strong overall economic
performance.
   Bush, asked about the latest inflation figures while on a visit
to Ottawa, said that ``I would not make assumptions based on one
monthly release'' of the Producer Price Index. He said the figures
tend to ``jump around somewhat.''
   The president said that he is ``not overly concerned about
inflation at this point,'' although he added that ``I don't like the
figures.''
   Private economists, skeptical about the rosy scenario presented
by Bush in his speech to Congress Thursday, have been predicting
slower growth this year and warned that the latest report from the
Labor Department could lead the Fed to boost interest rates to
restrain the economy and keep inflation in check.
   ``The report signals that the economy has launched into another
significant racheting upward of inflation,'' said economist Allen
Sinai of the Boston Co.
   ``We all should wait for another inflation report or two to draw
too pessimistic a conclusion, but my fear is that it will ultimately
take a major slowdown or recession to get inflation back down to
acceptable rates,'' Sinai said.
   The Producer Price Index for finished goods had risen 4 percent
during 1988, the steepest climb in seven years and nearly double the
2.2 percent increase posted in 1987. Many private economists expect
further increases this year, although not at the double-digit levels
that plagued the nation in 1979 and 1980.
   The index for finished goods, items one stop short of the retail
level, stood at 111.0 in January, meaning a hypothetical selection
of goods that cost $100 in 1982 would have cost $111 last month, up
$1 from the previous month.
   Economist David Wyss of Data Resources Inc., of Lexington, Mass.,
said the dramatic size of January's increase was a ``one-month
aberration'' caused largely by rising energy and food prices, but
that the overall trend nevertheless has been one of accelerating
inflation.
   ``I think it's going to be higher again this year and it could be
a lot higher if we have another drought,'' Wyss said. ``Early signs
don't look good. We haven't had much precipitation east of the
Rockies.''
   Energy prices were up 4.9 percent last month, in part reflecting
recent acceleration in crude oil prices. January's increase, the
biggest since a 7.2 percent rise in January 1987, was paced by an
11.6 percent rise in home heating oil and also included a 4.1
percent jump in wholesale gasoline prices and a 4.8 percent rise in
natural gas.
   With the after-effects of last summer's drought still in
evidence, food prices one stop short of grocery store shelves were
up 1.1 percent last month, the steepest increase since a 1.5 percent
rise in January 1988.
   Wholesale egg prices were up 20.1 percent, pork rose 11.4
percent, and prices for bakery products increased 1.3 percent.
   But even excluding energy and food costs, wholesale prices were
up a moderate 0.4 percent last month, including sharp increases in
children's apparel, prescription and over-the-counter medicines,
books, household electronic equipment, flatware, automobiles, toys
and games, and costume jewelry.
   Prices also were up at the earlier stages in the production
chain, with intermediate goods costs up 0.9 percent, the steepest
increase in nearly eight years, while crude goods shot up 3.9
percent, the biggest rise since August 1980.
   Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Association of
Wholesaler-Distributors, predicted those price increases would
translate into further rises at the finished goods level.
   ``My fear is that we reach a point where an inflation psychology
takes root in the economy,'' he said. ``It begins to feed on itself.
Wages begin to chase prices. ... It's extremely difficult to get
your arms around the problem without severely dampening economic
activity.''
   The nation will get this year's first look at inflation on the
consumer level with the Feb. 22 release of January's report on the
Consumer Price Index, which measures imports and services into
addition to goods. Consumer prices increased 4.4 percent in 1988.

<HEAD>Machinists Believe Eastern Lining Up Strike Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILL LESTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the Machinists union said Friday that a
tight-lipped Eastern Airlines is making arrangements through other
aviation companies to hire mechanics, baggage handlers and other
workers in case of a strike.
   An International Association of Machinists leader in Atlanta
charged Fridy that Eastern was recruiting mechanics through Butler
Aviation at an office building near Hartsfield International
Airport. Frank Ortis, vice president of local 702 in Miami, said
he's received several reports of recruiting workers, apparently for
the strike, but did not have proof. And Machinist leaders said they
suspected similar efforts in other cities.
   The Machinists had an informational picket at the site in Atlanta
and were telling people who arrived for job interviews that the jobs
would be for strikebreakers at Eastern in case the unions walk.
   A classified ad pitching the interviews in Atlanta was headlined
``Aviation Careers'' and gave directions to the job interview site,
but no phone number. It identified the employer only as a ``large
national company.''
   Michael Flynn, head of the IAM local in Atlanta, said Eastern
Airlines people were inside the building where the interviews were
taking place and armed guards were outside.
   He said he had heard of recruiting in several other cities, but
had few specifics.
   ``They won't have much luck with mechanics,'' Flynn predicted.
``All the airlines are hiring mechanics now.''
   Butler officials declined to talk about the Machinists' claims.
   ``We don't have any comment on that,'' said Bill Wynperle, vice
president of marketing for Butler International Inc., of Montvale,
N.J.
   Ortis said Machinists are looking into several newspaper
advertisements in the Miami area offering aviation-related jobs.
   ``We have reason to believe they are hiring strike-breakers,''
Ortis said. ``We expect companies to go ahead and start doing this.
But looking at the salary they advertised, I cannot believe anybody
would want to work for that. That's why we're on strike.''
   Eastern continued to decline comment on strike-related activities
or union charges.
   ``We have declined comment on any specifics of our contingency
plan,'' said Eastern spokeswoman Virginia Sanchez.
   But asked if there was a contingency plan, she replied: ``There
is.''
   ``Our goal is to operate, obviously,'' she said. ``However, our
objective in the short-term is always to reach a settlement because
we feel a strike will not benefit either party.''
   The three unions met Thursday to discuss their options if a
court-imposed March 3 deadline passes without a settlement in the
Machinists' 16-month contract dispute with the airline.
   ALPA and Machinists union members met with officials of the
Transport Workers Union, which represents Eastern's 7,000 flight
attendants. The TWU executive board met Thursday to discuss options,
but did not report on the meeting's outcome.
   Eastern's 3,400 pilots Thursday were being sent a taped message
from local union leader Capt. Jack Bavis urging them to consider
supporting the Machinists if they walk off the job.
   Eastern announced record net losses of $335.4 million for 1988,
nearly double the $181.7 million loss the year before. Revenues
dropped to $3.8 billion in 1988, compared to $4.4 billion in 1987.
   The Miami-based carrier, owned by Texas Air Corp., is seeking
$150 million in union wage concessions. It also claims to be losing
$1 million a day.
   The 8,500 Machinists comprise some 30 percent of Eastern's work
force. Mechanics make up about half of the union, which includes
baggage handlers, ramp agents and other ground-services workers.
   A National Mediation Board negotiator is continuing efforts to
gain an agreement between the two sides, although no recent progress
has been reported and both sides have shown signs of gearing up for
a strike.
   Union officials are predicted overwhelming approval of a strike
when the vote is concluded Feb. 14 by locals in Atlanta. The outcome
of that strike vote is expected late next week with a strike
deadline of March 3.

<HEAD>First Nationwide To Close 170 K mart Branches</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First Nationwide Bank announced Friday it
will close its 170 branches in K mart stores in 12 states, ending
the once-ballyhooed program in favor of a strategy focusing more on
traditional banking outlets.
   First Nationwide, a $26 billion savings bank whose parent is
owned by Ford Motor Co., said the planned March 10 closings are part
of ``a more focused strategy'' that has seen the company acquire
failed thrift institutions with billions of dollars in assets in
recent months.
   ``We regarded it as an experiment, and it just hasn't met what
our expectations were,'' said Lorna Doubet, a First Nationwide
spokeswoman. ``It just hasn't attracted as many customers as we had
thought it would.''
   First Nationwide had the 170 convenience branches in Arizona,
California, Colorado, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan,
Missouri, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia. The branches
accounted for about $200 million in deposits, compared with more
than $17 billion for the company's entire system, which also
included outlets in Hawaii, Illinois and New Jersey.
   ``Although we learned much about offering financial services in a
retail environment, we have concluded that convenience branches in K
marts don't fit the company's new strategic focus on its target
markets and profitable operations,'' said Robert C. Lackovic,
chairman and chief executive officer of the San Francisco-based
savings bank.
   ``K mart has given us strong support and we have an excellent
relationship, but the bank has found it necessary to change its
priorities,'' Lackovic said.
   Late in December, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board pledged $1.6
billion to assist First Nationwide Financial Corp., the savings
bank's parent, in the purchase of four failed savings and loans in
three states with assets of nearly $8 billion. When merged with
First Nationwide Bank, the company will have the nation's
second-biggest thrift business.
   First Nationwide failed in its September bid to acquire American
Savings and Loan Association, of Stockton, Calif., the nation's
biggest insolvent thrift.
   Jon Hartman, director of financial services for Troy, Mich.-based
K mart Corp., said the company had known for some time that results
at the branches were ``not as good as they could have been.'' He
also said the thrift recent acquisitions by First Nationwide had
signaled the shift in their strategy.
   ``I think what probably transpired is that we all thought this
was a good idea and there are situations where it can and has
worked, but it appears in talking with the bank that it's not
something that can be rolled out nationwide,'' Hartman said.
   First Nationwide accounts in the K mart branches will be
transferred to full-service offices, and affected customers will be
notified this week by mail.
   Ms. Doubet said about 350 employees would be affected by the
closings and First Nationwide was attempting to find new positions
with the company for many of them.

<HEAD>Militant Critters Getting Attention From Hoax Protest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Next week's demonstration by ``farmers'' against
Rebel Killer Swine won't exactly be a plea for support to stop
renegade barnyard pigs.
   It's just a staged protest to tout some new vinyl action toys and
their equally militaristic sheep foes debuting at this year's Toy
Fair.
   Bib overall-clad protesters carrying placards proclaiming ``Make
Bacon Not War!'' and ``Lamb Chops Not Karate Chops!'' will greet
visitors to the 86th annual American International Toy Fair, which
starts Monday.
   A group calling itself H.I.C.K.S. _ Horticulturists Incensed by
Commercialized Killer Swine _ issued a manifesto Friday urging the
publicto ``March shoulder-to-shoulder with pork producers and wool
farmers and demonstrate your solidarity against animal
exploitation!''
   The H.I.C.K.S. actually are actors hired to pose as Midwestern
farmers outraged by the Barnyard Commandos menagerie of action
figures being introduced at the fair.
   Playmate Toys Inc., creators of Barnyard Commandos, decided to
take this offbeat publicity approach to poke fun at itself and the
toy exhibition, which over the years has been known to cultivate a
healthy crop of advertising hyperbole.
   ``No one will mistake this for a real protest,'' said Playmates
spokesman Christopher A. Perez. ``It's so tongue-in-cheek and it's
all done in the spirit of fun.''
   Playmates, of La Mirada, Calif., claims Barnyard Commandos were
the demented result of a military experiment gone awry.
   In the company's Orwellian scenario, a Platoon of Rebel Killer
Swine are battling against a Rebel Army of Militant Sheep for
control of a farm.
   The opposing forces communicate with their comrades-in-arms using
secret languages: the P.O.R.K.S. speak Pork Latin and the R.A.M.S.
use Baa Code.
   The militant critters are a spoof of the army figures and war
toys now popular among children, said Perez.
   In recent years, some toy manufacturers have prided themselves on
presenting state-of-the art items, including gear that imitates the
latest in Pentagon weaponry and thinking.
   Perez said Playmates wants to show it doesn't take itself too
seriously and has retained a sense of humor despite its serious
success last year with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. These
creatures, based on a comic book, are described as the result of the
mutation of normal pet turtles that fell into a sewer. The turtles
turned out to be 1988's No.1 new toy.
   The only people that could take offense at Playmates' hoax are
real farmers. The fake ones hired by Playmates, led by Farmer
Fallow, are portrayed as rather unsophisticated yokels.
   Their dummy announcement, presented to look like it was printed
on an old-fashioned typewriter, concludes with a recommendation that
wouldn't exactly appeal to animal rights advocates.
   It says, ``Buy pork and lamb from your neighborhood butcher.''

   The dollar jumped higher against foreign
currencies Friday after reports of a big increase in wholesale
prices rekindled speculation of that U.S. interest rates would rise.
   The steep climb came just one day after the currency tumbled,
returned the dollar to where it was at midweek.
   The Labor Department reported wholesale prices rose in January at
a 12.7 percent annual rate, the steepest increase in more than three
months.
   Currency dealers speculated the Federal Reserve would combat
inflation by pushing up short-term interest rates, which would
attract global investors to put their money in dollars.
   Gold prices fell, even though investors usually flock to gold as
a haven against inflation. Dealers said selling swept the market
after gold failed to respond favorably to the wholesale price
figures.
   The dollar might have risen more but traders were uncertain how
aggressive Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan would be in
raising interest rates to cool the economy, said Garrett Glass, a
vice president at First National Bank of Chicago.
   On Thursday, the dollar's fall was blamed largely on the market's
nervous anticipation of President Bush's evening budget message to
Congress. The message contained no unpleasant surprises, market
watchers said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar closed at 127.65 yen, down from Thursday's close of
129.39 yen. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 128.15 yen. In
New York, the dollar rose to 128.68 yen from 127.93 late Thursday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7547 from $1.7540 on
Thursday. In New York, sterling fell to $1.7467 from $1.7645.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.8695 West German marks, up from
1.8475; 1.5885 Swiss francs, up from 1.5675; 1.1860 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1836; 6.3588 French francs, up from 6.2875; and
1,363.5 Italian lire, up from 1,347.5.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thurday's
rates were: 1.8595 West German marks, up from 1.8585; 1.5778 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5802; 6.3200 French francs, down from 6.3225;
2.0960 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0990; 1,353.75 Italian lire, down
from 1,355.50; and 1.1857 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1832.
   In Hong Kong, where trading endd before the U.S. inflation
figures were released, gold fell 43 cents to close at a bid of
$395.15 a troy ounce.
   Gold traded in London at a late bid of $391 a troy ounce, down
from $394.25 bid late Thursday. In Zurich, the late bid was $389.50,
down from $394.25 bid late Thursday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $388.80 a troy ounce from Thursday's $394.40.
Republic National Bank of New York said spot gold was bid at $387 an
ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down from $393.25.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid of $5.85 a troy ounce, down
from Thursday's late bid of $5.90. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery fell to $5.812 an ounce from $5.891.

   The stock market took its sharpest drop of the
year Friday in a selloff prompted by new inflation worries and
rising interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 36.97 to 2,286.07,
extending its loss for the week to 45.18 points.
   The last time the average recorded a bigger one-day decline was
Nov. 16, when it tumbled 38.59 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 4 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
301 up, 1,233 down and 446 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 173.56 million
shares, down from 224.22 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 205.33 million shares.
   The Labor Department reported that producer prices of finished
goods jumped 1 percent in January, for their sharpest rise since
they posted a similar increase in October 1985.
   The figure came in well above advance estimates, and touched off
new concerns on Wall Street about the inflation outlook.
   Speculation quickly intensified about whether and when the
Federal Reserve might tighten credit further in its campaign against
inflation.
   Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite
direction from interest rates, fell more than $5 for each $1,000 in
face value.
   And numerous large banks across the country raised their prime
lending rates from 10{ percent to 11 percent.
   Analysts also cited some disappointment among traders over

<HEAD>Fed Panel Moved Toward Higher Interest Rates in December</HEAD>

   Policymakers at the Federal Reserve, concerned
that strong economic growth posed a risk of higher inflation,
decided in December to push up interest rates in an effort to hold
down prices, according to records released Friday.
   The Federal Open Market Committee, which establishes policy for
the central bank, voted 11-1 at its Dec. 13-14 meeting to ``increase
somewhat'' its restraint on reserves held by commercial banks,
according to minutes of the session.
   Lowering the amount of cash which banks have available to back
loans drives up the interest rates charged on those loans.
   The Fed minutes said most members favored some immediate added
restraint on reserves, ``with some further tightening to be
implemented at the start of 1989, assuming that economic and
financial conditions remained reasonably consistent with current
expectations.''
   The Fed, whose main job is to guard against inflation, has been
pushing up interest rates in an effort to slow economic growth to a
more sustainable level and thus keep prices in check.
   At the committee's December meeting, the minutes said, ``members
focused on indications of continuing strength in the economic
expansion.''
   ``Many expressed concern that continued expansion at a relatively
rapid pace raised the risk that inflation would intensify,'' they
said.
   The lone dissenter was Martha Seger, who ``viewed current
business indicators as already pointing on balance to slower
economic expansion,'' the minutes said.
   Ms. Seger ``expressed particular concern that the higher interest
rates implied by greater monetary restraint would aggravate'' the
condition of the financially troubled savings and loan industry,
they said.
   The Fed began a series of credit-tightening steps last March
which included a one-half percentage point increase last August in
the discount rate, the interest it charges to make bank loans. The
discount rate now stands at 6.5 percent.
   Many private economists have been predicting the Fed will
continue to push interest rates upward in the face of strong
economic reports.
   Those expectations were reinforced by a report from the Labor
Department on Friday showing wholesale prices in January rose at
their fastest pace in nearly three years.
   Several of the nation's biggest banks on Friday increased their
prime lending rate by one-half percentage point to 11 percent,
reflecting the continuing rise of interest rates.
   Mortgage rates have been rising as well. The Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. reported Friday that fixed-rate mortgages now stand
at 10.56 percent, up from 9.84 percent a year earlier.
   The Fed's Open Market Committee met behind closed doors again
Tuesday and Wednesday to review policy and set monetary growth
targets for 1989. Their actions will not be revealed until Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan testifies before Congress on Feb. 21.
   Greenspan, in testimony before Congress last month, said the risk
of inflation remained strong enough that the Fed should ``err more
on the side of restrictiveness than stimulus'' in determining
monetary policy.
   But Fed efforts to slow the economy could spell trouble for the
Bush administration, which has tied its plans to reduce the federal
budget deficit without increasing taxes to expectations of strong
economic growth.
   President Bush, asked about the latest inflation figures while on
a visit to Ottawa, said he was ``not overly concerned about
inflation at this point,'' although he added, ``I don't like the
figures.''
   The Open Market Committee decided to tighten the central bank's
grip because members felt ``the risks of a downturn stemming from
the limited tightening under consideration were extremely small and
needed to be accepted in light of what they perceived as the much
greater threat of a recession if inflation were allowed to
intensify,'' the minutes said.
   Minutes of this week's Open Market Committee meeting won't be
released until after the committee's next meeting March 28. The
committee is composed of the seven-member Federal Reserve Board and
five of the 12 presidents of the Fed's regional banks.

<HEAD>Gold Futures Slide In Wholesale Price Reaction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An unexpected leap in wholesale prices triggered a plunge in gold
and silver futures prices Friday as traders anticipated further
credit tightening by the Federal Reserve Board in an effort to
control inflation.
   On other markets, coffee, energy and soybean futures prices fell
sharply; grain futures were higher and livestock and meat futures
were mixed.
   Gold futures prices settled $6.10 to $6.60 lower on New York's
Commodity Exchange with the contract for delivery in April at
$391.70 a troy ounce; silver was 7.7 cents to 8 cents lower with
March at $5.835 a troy ounce.
   The Labor Department's report of a 1 percent rise in the Producer
Price Index last month, the sharpest monthly increase in nearly
eight years, shocked economists and sent financial markets into
turmoil.
   Gold futures prices initially rose as startled investors bought
into a market traditionally viewed as a safe haven in times of
rising prices.
   But the gold bulls were rapidly overtaken by sellers who feared
the Federal Reserve would move quickly to drive up interest rates
and clamp down on inflation.
   ``The way the (gold) market reacted was not a good reaction,''
said Stephen Platt, a precious-metals analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. ``We were able to rally a buck and that
was it.''
   Earlier this week, the gold market had appeared to be struggling
back from the depressed levels it slipped into in late January. But
the market's reaction to the wholesale price report held out little
hope for recovery in the near future.
   ``I don't think the market really believes that inflation's going
to build into a new problem,'' said Craig Sloane, an analyst with
Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York.
   ``This really struck at the heart of gold bulls,'' said Platt.
   Coffee futures prices dropped sharply on New York's Coffee, Sugar
&amp; Cocoa Exchange in technically inspired trading, settling 1.10
cents to 6.94 cents lower with March at $1.33 a pound.
   Weakening chart signals helped push crude oil for March delivery
as low as $17.05 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange but a
late rally partially erased the losses.
   Crude oil settled 17 cents to 35 cents lower with March at $17.11
a barrel; heating oil was .61 cent to 1.25 cents lower with March at
47.36 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .20 cent to .79 cent
lower with March at 47.57 cents a gallon.
   Soybean futures prices fell sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade
amid slack demand for what one analyst called ``fairly comfortable''
supplies of soybean meal.
   Wheat futures gained on rumors that the Agriculture Department
was preparing to target China for sales of U.S. wheat at subsidized
prices.
   Wheat settled 3{ cents to 6\ cents higher with March at $4.28} a
bushel; corn was } cent to 1 cent higher with March at $2.66 a
bushel; oats were } cent to 1{ cents higher with March at $2.06} a
bushel; soybeans were 5 cents to 11 cents lower with March at $7.35
a bushel.
   Cattle futures steadied and finished mixed after an opening
plunge linked to Wednesday's USDA report showing a
larger-than-expected U.S. cattle herd.
   Pork futures also finished mixed in a day of choppy trading.
   Live cattle were .50 cent lower to .35 cent higher with April at
75.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .75 cent to 1.15 cents lower
with March at 82.15 cents a pound; hogs were .30 cent lower to .23
cent higher with February at 41.60 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .45 cent lower to .45 cent higher with February at 38
cents a pound.

<HEAD>Baker Seeks Waiver on Holdings, Agrees to Follow Administration Ruling</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates throughout with Baker, Bush remarks. Also moved on general
news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Friday
he was seeking a waiver from the Bush administration to permit him
to participate in decisions on Third World debt even while holding
stock in a major American lender to developing nations.
   But Baker stressed that he would accept any of several options
that might be chosen by administration lawyers and ethics
specialists, including possibly selling his stock in Chemical New
York Corp., a bank holding company.
   He denied reports that C. Boyden Gray, the White House counsel,
had pressed him to sell his holdings.
   ``The discussions now revolve around waiver,'' Baker said at a
news conference during President Bush's five-hour visit to the
Canadian capital.
   Bush himself said, ``All I know, there's nobody more ethical than
Jim Baker. Complied with the spirit and letter of good ethics
practice. ... I just haven't had a chance to look into it. We'll
have high standards, we know. There will be no conflicts of
interest.''
   Bush commented aboard Air Force One after leaving Ottawa.
   Baker, who was White House chief of staff and then treasury
secretary in the Reagan administration, has substantial interests in
real estate, oil and bank stocks, including Chemical New York Corp.,
a bank holding company that has $4.5 billion in loans to Third World
nations, his latest disclosure form shows.
   However, the form shows the Chemical holdings were not large at
the time the form was filed last month, between $12,000 and $40,000,
   At Treasury over the past several years, Baker put forward a plan
to deal with the sagging economies of Third World nations burdened
with debt to commercial banks in the United States and elsewhere. As
secretary of state, he would play a leading role in determining U.S.
policy toward the developing nations, especially their debt burden.
   ``I have concluded I should seek a waiver,'' Baker said as he
calmly answered a half-dozen questions about the ethics issue raised
in a front-page article in Friday's Washington Post. He said a
presidential waiver from normal conflict-of-interest rules ``gives
me additional protection and helps avoid the appearance of any sort
of conflict.''
   Baker, a Texas multimillionaire, said that as White House chief
of staff and then as treasury secretary, ``I've been very careful
about recusing myself'' from decisions where even an appearance of
impropriety was possible.
   At the same time, Baker said, he recognized that Bush ``made it
very clear that ethics are an important issue to him.''
   Baker said the thrust of discussions with administration lawyers
was to find ``mechanisms or actions that could be taken in my case
to insulate me from charges or suggestions of conflict of interest.''
   He said that if there were an ethical problem it would have been
discovered while his nomination was under consideration by the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee. During two days of hearings last
month, the issue of his finances was never brought up.
   Baker said he would be willing to remove himself from policy
discussions of Third World issues, restructure the trust holding his
stock or even sell his stock if that were the conclusion of the
current inquiry within the administration.
   He said he had not talked to Gray, who is the White House counsel
and the administration's chief ethics official. However, he said
Gray had raised the subject of Baker selling his stock in comments
to Robert Kimmit, a Washington lawyer recently named undersecretary
of state for political affairs.
   Earlier, on the flight to Ottawa, presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said, ``At this point they haven't reached a decision'' on
disposing of any investments. He was referring to ethics lawyers
from the White House, the State Department and the Office of
Government Ethics, which is also part of the executive branch.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said
the new review of Baker's holdings was undertaken because of a more
stringent interpretation of government ethics rules based on a 1987
Justice Department opinion. The Office of Government Ethics,
interpreting the Justice Department opinion, requires officials ``to
be more conservative ... than previously believed necessary by
government ethics attorneys,'' he said.
   From his arrival in the Reagan administration eight years ago
until the present, Baker has had his holdings in a ``qualified blind
trust,'' Redman said.
   However, the disclosure forms he has filed openly list his assets.
   His latest such forms, filed with Office of Government Ethics,
list some 5,310 shares of various types of stock held in the
Chemical New York Corp. _ listed on a form titled ``Assets of a
dependent child.'' The Bakers have a teen-age daughter, Mary Bonner
Baker.
   On the form, two types of Chemical stock are listed with values
ranging from $1,000 to $5,000, while two others are listed as being
valued at $5,000 to $15,000. According to a range provided on the
list, the stocks in total would be worth more than $12,000, but less
than $40,000.
   Baker's Chemical shares originally were in Texas Commerce
Bancshares, a banking company that grew out of a bank organized by
his grandfather. In May 1987, Texas Commerce was merged with a
subsidiary of Chemical, and Baker became a large holder of the New
York bank company's stock.

   Home heating oil prices fell sharply Friday,
taking other energy prices down with them.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for
heating oil fell 1.25 cents to 47.36 cents a gallon.
   ``The heating oil market had every reason to rally'' but was
unable to do so, said Andrew Lebow, an energy futures analyst with
E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc.
   Severe winter weather in the United States should have given
heating oil prices a boost, but warmer weather overseas and an
abundance of oil stocks here and abroad depressed prices, Lebow said.
   The gloomy news spilled over to the markets for crude oil and
gasoline.
   The March contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, dropped 28 cents to $17.11 a barrel, and the
March contract for unleaded gasoline declined 0.79 cent to 47.57
cents a gallon.
   ``It was a heating oil-led decline,'' Lebow said.
   Rising stockpiles of gasoline took a further toll on gas prices,
analysts said.

<HEAD>Proposed Payment Document Filed in Chubb Drought Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first payments are to be mailed out by
mid-March to about 7,400 farmers as the result of their settlement
with a New Jersey insurer in a lawsuit over crop insurance for the
summer drought, lawyers said Friday.
   Chubb Corp., an insurer based in Warren, N.J., agreed in November
to the $43.1 million settlement with the farmers, who sued Chubb on
grounds it had broken promises to issue crop insurance as protection
against possible drought damage. The settlement covers farmers in
Illinois, Iowa, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Tennessee, Minnesota,
Michigan, Missouri and Wisconsin.
   Cincinnati lawyer Lawrence Kane Jr., court-appointed
administrator for the settlement, filed a proposed payment schedule
Friday with the U.S. District Court in Cincinnati. It proposes
payments ranging from $250 to about $300,000.
   The proposed payments are subject to review by lawyers for the
farmers and Chubb, and then final approval by U.S. District Judge
Carl Rubin of Cincinnati, who is presiding over the case.
   The first checks should go out in mid-March covering half the
payments, with the balance to be mailed by late April, Kane said.
Objections can delay distribution of the payments, he said.
   ``We've resolved somewhere between 400 and 500 objections so
far,'' Kane said.
   Stanley Chesley, a Cincinnati lawyer for the farmers, said he
expects the payment schedule to receive all needed approvals.
   ``We're very satisfied. We think it'll reflect an accurate
accounting,'' Chesley said.
   Lawyers for Chubb and the farmers have united to jointly sue Good
Weather International Corp., a company which allegedly sold about
$350 million worth of Chubb drought insurance policies that Chubb
refused to honor.
   The farmers are demanding unspecified damages from Good Weather,
saying it violated its contract with Chubb. Chubb is suing Good
Weather for $68 million, saying the policies should not have been
sold.
   The case was to have gone to trial this week, but has been
postponed. Chesley said the farmers and Chubb plan to split any
settlement award. Chubb would get a third of whatever it wins from
Good Weather, and the farmers would get two-thirds, Chesley said.
Rubin is to hear the trial.

<HEAD>Energy Company Reports Fourth-Quarter Earnings Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coastal Corp. said Thursday its fourth-quarter
1988 earnings rose 103 percent to $71.1 million compared with a year
earlier in part because of improvements in its refining and
marketing division.
   Coastal said profits amounted to $1.22 a share on revenue of $2.1
billion. That compares with $35 million, or 68 cents a share, on
revenue of $2 billion for the same 1987 quarter.
   Coastal, a diversified energy company, last month offered to buy
Houston-based Texas Eastern Co. for $2.6 billion. Texas Eastern's
board of directors has rejected the $42-a-share bid as inadequate.
   For all of 1988, Coastal reported earnings of $157 million, or
$2.70 a share, on revenue of $8.24 billion, a 39 percent increase
from 1987 earnings of $113 million, or $2.10 a share, on revenue of
$7.43 billion.
   Profits from the company's refining and marketing segment for the
quarter increased to $124 million from a loss of $36.3 million in
1987. For the year, the segment's earnings grew to $169 million from
$43 million in 1987.

<HEAD>GM Contracts With Disney for Lumina Advertising</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Japan-Auto Industry, Bjt</HEAD>

   Mickey Mouse may be at the wheel the first time
most of America sees Chevrolet's Lumina cars for 1990.
   Chevrolet and Walt Disney World Co. have entered an advertising
pact to help launch the new General Motors Corp. car line and the
Disney-MGM Studios Theme park near Orlando, Fla., Chevrolet
officials said Friday.
   Bob Burger, general manager of GM's Chevrolet Division, said the
Lumina line's advertising will focus on portraying the cars as
family oriented.
   ``The Disney name is instantly recognized by families,'' he said.
``We believe this is a win-win partnership.'
   The four-door Lumina sedan will go on sale in March, with the new
Disney-MGM park set to open in April. A two-door coupe and minivan
will be available later in the year, said Mike Erdman, Chevrolet's
general marketing manager.
   Lumina is more than 2 inches wider than Celebrity, the midsize
Chevy it replaces. Prices won't be announced for at least 30 days,
Erdman said.
   The Disney-Chevrolet campaign will be used only on the Lumina
cars, while Chevrolet's award-winning ``Heartbeat of America''
advertising theme will continue, Erdman said. Lumina advertisements
will use Disney characters and the ``Heartbeat'' theme.
   Erdman declined to say how much money was involved in the
Disney-Chevrolet collaboration. He said the agreement calls for
Chevrolet ads with Disney characters and Disney ads with Lumina
cars. The agreement lasts into the fall.
   The television ads will debut March 29 during the motion picture
Academy Awards show. The joint campaign also includes radio and
print media.
   After the deal was announced in front of the Lumina display at
the Chicago Auto Show, Burger _ looking a little embarrassed _ posed
with Mickey Mouse and Goofy.
   Also Friday, GM Chairman Roger Smith said the corporation's North
American operations earned a large profit during 1988, declining to
say how much money was involved. GM earlier this week declared its
first split of common stock since 1955 and increased dividends on
most of its stock issues. The stock market responded with a big gain
Tuesday.
   Officials said a year ago that GM earned a marginal profit in
North America.
   GM reports its year-end earnings Tuesday. Smith has said
repeatedly the earnings would be a company record. In recent years,
overseas earnings, especially in Europe, have bolstered GM's sagging
North American performance.
   Smith also said the company planned to spend about $1 billion on
tools, machinery and equipment for its Saturn Corp. plant in Spring
Hill, Tenn. He said the Saturn project remained on schedule and
under budget for a launch in mid-1990.

<TEXT>
   W.R. Grace &amp; Co. said Friday it is considering
selling a stake in one or more of its businesses so it can channel
more capital into its core chemicals segment.
   Grace said it was considering the possible sale of a minority
interest in its specialty businesses, which include cocoa,
distribution, textiles and agriculture.
   The company also said it was looking into the possible sale of an
interest in its natural resources division. No price tags were named
for any of the businesses.
   J. Peter Grace, the company's chairman, said in a statement the
firm wanted to concentrate on its core specialty chemical business
``while insuring the necessary capital to support its non-specialty
chemical activities.''
   ``With high capital requirements arising from growth and earnings
opportunities in specialty chemicals, as well as other Grace niche
businesses, we are actively evaluating the possible redeployment of
capital,'' Grace said.
   The company said its specialty chemical business had $3.1 billion
in sales and $237 million in operating income last year.
   In its statement, Grace said it expected to have $338 million in
capital expenditures for Grace Specialty Chemicals Co. this year, up
from $288 million in 1988.

<TEXT>
   Farley Inc.'s chairman visited West
Point-Pepperell Inc. Thursday to inspect two of the company's
plants, apparently among the first of several potential buyers to
tour the textile giant's facilities.
   William Farley toured three facilities in Pepperell's consumer
apparel division: the Lanier-Carter Mill and West Point Pepperell
Mill Store in Huguley, Ala., and the Fairfax Mill in Valley, Ala.
   Pepperell spokeswoman Toni Cauble said in a statement that
Farley's visit was ``intended to permit Farley to see as much of our
operations as the other bidders will be permitted to see.''
   Ms. Cauble said Farley was in town as a bidder only and did not
meet with Pepperell Chairman Joseph Lanier Jr.
   Other prospective buyers of the West Point-based textile
manufacturer were to tour the company's facilities this week.
Representatives from two textile firms _ Dominion of Montreal and
Spartanburg, S.C.-based Milliken and Co. _ were expected to visit
soon.
   The visits were arranged to accommodate a Feb. 15 deadline to
receive bids for the textile giant. Pepperell set the deadline
Wednesday after its directors announced last week that the company
was for sale.
   Chicago-based Farley had already offered to buy Pepperell for
$1.54 billion, or $52 a share.
   Before Farley's visit, a West Point store owner had displayed a
sign suggesting that residents burn their underwear. Farley owns
Fruit of the Loom underwear, among other products.
   Workers in various Pepperell plants were busy preparing for
Farley's visit Wednesday. Some worked overtime Wednesday night
scraping ``Stop Farley'' stickers off the machinery in the plants.

   In another major European investment in
California wine, the interests of the fabled Chateau
Lafite-Rothschild of Bordeaux, France, have formed an alliance with
the state's superpremium Chalone Vineyard.
   Chateau Lafite's Baron Eric de Rothschild and Board Chairman Dick
Graff of Chalone made the announcement Thursday at a news
conference. Chalone, whose best wines sell for $20 a bottle and up,
is the only publicly owned operating winery in the country.
   The executives said the agreement, subject to the approval of
shareholders, calls for an approximately 6 percent ownership swap
between the companies, with a contemplated rise to 20 percent for a
$15 million investment by each party.
   Rothschild said the swap included none of the property or vines
of Chateau Lafite itself, only the 200-year-old winery's business
ownerships, specifically its domaines _ Chateau Rieussec, Chateau
Dehart-Milon, and Chateau La Cardonne _ plus the 50 percent-owned
Vina Los Vascos of Chile.
   All the French wineries are in the famous red wine district of
Medoc.
   ``Great wines are made from the proper soil, good weather and
talented people,'' said Rothschild. ``We found Chalone the only
American wine company that shares our philosophy.''
   Chalone president Philip Woodward said the companies planned
extensive exchanges of personnel, marketing talent, winemaking
information and details of grape growing. They also will make mutual
investments in the development of winery and vineyard properties.
Chalone now exports to 12 countries.
   Rothschild is the second of his family to invest in California
wine, though not in the same way. His late cousin, Baron Philippe de
Rothschild of Mouton-Rothschild, made the move after a California
wine trounced the best of French wines in a blind tasting in Paris
in 1976.
   In the late 1970s, Philippe, who died last year, entered into a
joint venture with Napa Valley winemaker Robert Mondavi to produce
Opus One, the proprietary name for a cabernet sauvignon blend whose
vintages enter the market roughly at $50 a bottle.
   ``There will not be an Opus Two,'' said Graff, emphasizing that
Chalone plans no viticultural or blending combinations with the
French.
   The Lafite domaines swap is regarded as an important boost to the
prestige of California wine. The deal also gives the French wineries
an important new opening into the booming premium American wine
market,
   Chalone, the oldest winery in Monterey County, first planted
vines in 1919 and today owns and operates Acacia Winery of Napa
Valley's prized Carneros; Carmenet Vineyard of Sonoma, and 50
percent of Edna Valley Vineyard of San Luis Obispo.
