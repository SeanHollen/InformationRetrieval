<HEAD>Bonn Closes Its East Berlin Mission Due To Refugee Overflow</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   West German officials said the Bonn
government closed its East Berlin mission to the public Tuesday
because its capacities were ``completely exhausted.''
   The West German government accused East Germany of being
responsible for a wave of refugees seeking to leave their communist
homeland.
   Scores of East Germans have fled to West German diplomatic
missions in East Berlin; the Hungarian capital of Budapest and
Prague, Czechoslovakia.
   Bonn officials said 130 East German citizens are in the West
German mission in East Berlin and are refusing to leave, demanding
that East Germany allow them to emigrate.
   Claus Duisberg, an aide to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, called on
East Germany to ``create conditions ... that would give people
reason for staying.''
   A leading West German parliamentarian, Eduard Lintner, said East
German leader Erich Honecker should either initiate political
reforms or resign, a newspaper reported.
   ``Erich Honecker and his old men should finally leave,'' the
Cologne Express newspaper quoted Lintner as saying.
   East German officials have refused to adopt political reforms
like those under way in the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary.
   Hundreds of East Germans have been trying to leave through
Hungary, which has been dismantling border barriers along its
frontier with Austria.
   Seventy-two East Germans who fled through Hungary arrived at a
temporary housing center in Giessen, West Germany, on Tuesday after
traveling by train from Vienna.
   News reports say about 200 East Germans are inside the West
German Embassy in Budapest, demanding that their government let
them move to the West.
   West German news reports say about 20 East Germans are inside
the West German mission in Prague.
   East Germany's state-run news agency ADN on Monday accused the
West German Embassy in Budapest of ``gross interference'' in East
German's internal affairs.
   West Germany summoned Lothar Glienke, head of the East German
diplomatic mission in Bonn, to the chancellery to protest the
statement, said West German government spokesman Herbert
Schmuelling.
   Schmuelling said West German officials also discussed the
situation at the East Berlin mission with Glienke and appealed to
the East German government to ``contribute to the solution of these
matters.''
   ``The federal government wants to continue its constructive
cooperation with the German Democratic Republic (East Germany)
despite this situation,'' Schmuelling said.
   West German officials said East Germany agreed not to arrest
refuge-seekers inside the East Berlin mission if they leave the
complex, but refused to guarantee they would be permitted to leave
the country.
   The West German newspaper Bild Zeitung reported the number of
East Germans who moved to West Germany _ both legally and illegally
_ increased dramatically since last year. It said the figure for
the first seven months of this year was 55,970 compared with 39,832
for all of last year.

<TEXT>
   Jan Victor Mladek, a member of
Czechoslovakia's last non-communist government and a retired
International Monetary Fund official, died of cancer at George
Washington University Hospital.
   Mladek, who was 77, died Monday.
   Mladek was also a founder of the Central and East European Art
Foundation, which promoted East European artists.
   Trained as an economist, he served in the anti-Nazi Czech army
in France and England before becoming head of the exile
Czechoslovakian government's monetary department in the Ministry of
Finance.
   He was vice chairman of the Czech delegation to the 1944 Bretton
Woods Conference, which planned Europe's postwar economy and where
the IMF, the worldwide lending agency, was created.
   An official in the finance ministry in the government of
Persident Eduard Benes after the war, Mladek represented
Czechoslovakia on the IMF executive board. He became the IMF's
deputy director of operations at its Washington headquarters after
the communists took power in Prague in 1948.
   He was head of the fund's central banking service for 14 years
before retiring in 1977.
   Mladek and his wife, Meda, established the art foundation in
Washington and helped mount shows of East and Central European art
at the city's Hirschorn and Corcoran art galleries.
   Born in Bochnia, Poland, in what was then the Austro-Hungarian
Empire, Mladek became a naturalized American citizen in 1960.

<TEXT>
   Pat Murphy, publisher of The Arizona Republic and
The Phoenix Gazette, resigned Tuesday, saying he felt it was time
to move on.
   ``I just turned 60 last week, and sometimes you ask yourself how
much time do you have left to do things you want to do?'' he said.
``I've had 3{ years as publisher and brought some terrific people _
managing editors and assistant managing editors _ on board.''
   ``I've gotten as much satisfaction as a publisher could have,''
he said in an interview, adding that it was time ``to take a
breather.''
   Murphy said he didn't know what he'd do next but was stepping
down immediately, trying to sell a screenplay and might write a
novel.
   Frank E. Russell, president of Central Newspapers Inc., the
Indianapolis company that controls the newspapers, said a search
would begin for a successor to Murphy, ``a person with a proven
track record as a publisher of a major metropolitan newspaper.''
   Central Newspapers is owned by the Pulliam family and includes
Vice President Dan Quayle as one of its owners. It owns Phoenix
Newspapers Inc., which was headed by Murphy and which publishes the
weekly Arizona Business Gazette as well as the daily Republic and
Gazette.
   Editors of the Republic, Gazette and Business Gazette will
report directly to Eugene S. Pulliam, publisher of The Indianapolis
Star and The Indianapolis News, until Murphy's successor is named,
said Bill Shover, director of public affairs for the Phoenix
newspapers.
   Murphy, a former columnist, took over the Phoenix newspapers on
March 11, 1986. He took an active role as publisher, describing
maverick Republican Gov. Evan Mecham as a ideological juggernaut
even as Mecham attacked the newspapers and their reporting.
   Mecham was ousted by a Senate Court of Impeachment last year but
found innocent on criminal charges.

   Twenty newspapers have been selected as
finalists in the Associated Press Managing Editors Association's
19th annual Public Service Awards competition.
   The finalists were announced Monday by the APME judges, who met
in New York City.
   The finalists were chosen from 126 entries _ 73 from newspapers
with more than 50,000 circulation and 53 with less than 50,000
circulation.
   One winner from each category will be announced in October at
the APME convention in Des Moines, Iowa.
   ``The high quality of the entries reflects the extraordinary
commitment of talent and resources by newspapers to probing
examinations of the core problems afflicting the communities we
serve,'' said Robert H. Giles, immediate past president of APME and
chair of the judging committee.
   ``The themes of the entries focused on the most troubling
problems we face as a democratic society: drugs, homelessness, care
of the aged, toxic chemicals, race relations, the environment,
governmental corruption and incompetence,'' said Giles, who is
editor and publisher of The Detroit News.
   Giles said the judges were particularly impressed with the
strong entries from the smaller newspapers.
   Finalists in the less than 50,000 category, listed
alphabetically, are:
   The Albuquerque (N.M.) Tribune, for a report on the effects of
alcoholism among the Indian residents of Gallup, N.M.
   The State-Times of Baton Rouge, La., for its investigation of
improprieties by a parish clerk of court that led to a special
grand jury investigation.
   The Beverly (Mass.) Times and The Peabody (Mass.) Times, for an
in-depth report on the homeless in the suburbs of Boston.
   Gwinnett Daily News, of Lawrenceville, Ga., for its disclosures
that county officials and their spouses had spent $50,000 in public
money on a junket to New York. The stories led to reforms and
repayment of most of the money.
   Herald-Dispatch of Huntington, W.Va., for a report through which
West Virginians set the agenda for the state's gubernatorial
campaign.
   The Journal of Commerce (New York City), for its investigation
of how the United States handles famine relief shipments to poor
nations. The stories forced the Department of Agriculture to hold
open bidding for contracts to ship the food.
   Naples (Fla.) Daily News, for its special report on destitute
Haitian, Mexican and Guatemalan migrant workers who had been
victimized by slumlords.
   Poughkeepsie (N.Y.) Journal, for a series that exposed how
bigotry affected the lives of Dutchess County's small black
community.
   Scottsdale (Ariz.) Progress, for an investigation of abuses in
land deals that allowed developers to pay low taxes and benefit
from special city projects tailored to their developments. The
stories led to a series of reforms.
   The Wilkes-Barre (Pa.) Times Leader, for an investigation into
illegal activities by local sewer department officials. The stories
were followed by a public investigation and reforms.
   Finalists from newspapers with more than 50,000 circulation are,
alphabetically:
   Anchorage (Alaska) Daily News, for its coverage of the Exxon
Valdez oil spill.
   Chicago Tribune, for its investigation into the mismanagement,
greed and corruption that created the savings and loan crisis.
   Colorado Springs (Colo.) Gazette Telegraph, for an investigation
of the U.S. Olympic Committee that revealed widespread
improprieties and led to corrective measures.
   The Detroit News, for its investigation of a $2 million land
deal that became a $42 million taxpayer purchase of used equipment,
which the city later resold for a nickel on the dollar. During the
investigation, the city's chief lawyer was jailed for ignoring a
judge's order to provide public documents to the newspaper.
   The Greenville (S.C.) News, for its examination of substandard
housing in South Carolina.
   The Hartford (Conn.) Courant, for its series ``Two
Connecticuts,'' which explored inequality and separateness in the
state.
   The Orlando (Fla.) Sentinel, for its series that brought to
public view a system of neglect and abuse in homes for the aged in
Florida. The series led to reforms.
   Roanoke (Va.) Times &amp; World-News, for an investigation of how
Virginia's weak regulation of the pest control industry had
resulted in shocking abuses. The newspaper's efforts spurred the
state Legislature to pass a tough law.
   San Francisco Examiner, for its exhaustive portrait of
homosexuals in America.
   USA Today, for its extensive examination of campus security at
50 U.S. colleges and universities that resulted in a comprehensive
report card on campus crime.
   The judges of the APME Public Service Awards competition are

<TEXT>
   Iran has broken a network of spies who provided
the Central Intelligence Agency with intimate details and documents
about Iranian military planning, The New York Times said in
Tuesday's editions.
   Citing unnamed U.S. officials, the Times said the Iranians had
detected the network months before it actually collapsed and had
used the spies to give the CIA false information.
   But some officials told the Times that before the network was
compromised, it yielded valuable military intelligence,
particularly about the Iranian Navy's operations in the Persian
Gulf at a time when American naval forces were confronting the
Iranians.
   The network did not supply intelligence on hostage cases or
political developments.
   The Times' sources confirmed for the first time Iranian claims
that spies had been arrested.
   The sources said the Iranian military, many of whose members
were trained in the United States, was considered one of the less
difficult groups in the country from which to recruit agents. The
CIA had more difficulty recruiting agents from among pro-Iranian
militants or officials in the Iranian Government who deal with
Lebanon.
   All of those in the dismantled intelligence ring were believed
to be Iranians, the Times said.
   It was not known how Iran uncovered the operation or how long
Iran used it to feed false information to the United States.
   CIA spokesman Bill Devine in Washington, when informed of the
Times report, said, ``We do not comment on allegations of
intelligence activity.''
   Iran first disclosed the existence of the CIA operation on April
21, when Hashemi Rafsanjani, who was then speaker of the Iranian
Parliament, told a Friday prayer meeting in Teheran about ``several
dens of espionage.''
   Over the next few months, Iranian television broadcast a
succession of programs in which purported spies confessed to their
roles.
   U.S. officials told the Times that the broadcasts _ which
described everything from secret writing techniques to the CIA
recruitment of agents through greed, entrapment and blackmail _
were a mixture of fact and fiction.
   Several officials told the Times that most of those identified
were double agents controlled by Iran.

   A hot-air balloon that crashed and
killed its pilot was leaking before take-off during a national
competition, a federal investigator said Monday.
   Robert A. Mock, who was killed Saturday when his balloon
deflated at 3,000 feet as thousands of spectators watched, should
have noticed rips in the balloon's fabric during inflation, said
Armond Edwards, an investigator for the National Transportation
Safety Board.
   ``If the pilot had looked closely at the balloon, he would have
noticed the separations I showed you,'' Edwards said at news
conference where the balloon was displayed.
   Edwards said he also was unable to locate a large thermometer
required for the balloon by federal law. The device warns pilots
about overheating.
   The balloon was 12 years old, although registration records
showed that Mock of Paonia, Colo., bought it in January, Edwards
said. The average life of a hot-air balloon is 10 years, he said.
   Mock, a former crop-dusting pilot, had logged 180 hours of
balloon flight time, most of it over the past 12 months.
   Edwards said it was the first balloon fatality he has
investigated that involved the fabric. Accidents involving power
lines are the most common, he said.
   Edwards said the fabric ripped ``at the top of the balloon.
That's the most critical part. Once you lose that there's nothing
you can do.''
   Although only one seam ripped open Saturday, several other seams
had begun to separate and could have split completely at any time,
Edwards said.
   The fatality was the first in the 19-year history of the
national balloon championship, officials said.

   Troy Thein gets some funny looks from
motorists when he rides his bike to work.
   It could be his unusual posture _ leaning back with his feet
pedaling in the air _ or the fact that he keeps up with traffic
going 50 mph.
   ``People right here in town still look at me funny. They say,
`What's that? Where did you get that?,'' said Thein. ``The other
day I was coming down the River Road hill and was going 52 miles
per hour.''
   Thein is one of three workers at Kann Manufacturing, the
Guttenberg company that makes the Linear brand of recumbent
bicycles. The company also makes aluminum semi-trailers, commercial
work boats and grain-hauling bodies for trucks.
   Instead of the standard bicycle seat, the recumbent bicycle has
a cushioned chair that supports a rider's back, making it easier to
generate pedal power. The upright position of a rider also puts
less pressure on the diaphragm for easier breathing, and the
position allows for an unrestricted view without neck cramping.
   The Linear bike has an aluminum frame and under-the-seat
steering so that a rider's arms hang down in their natural
position. Its 18 gears are shifted by a flick of the thumb.
   The Linear, designed by company president Dirk Kann, is the only
recumbent on the market that can be folded. That enables the 7-foot
bike to fit in a car trunk, Hansel said.
   ``You have to get used to it, but once you do, it's extremely
comfortable. It's much more efficient than the traditional 10-speed
or 12-speed,'' said Steve Hansel, director of production and
marketing at Kann.
   Recumbent bicycles have been around since the 1920s, Hansel
said, and Kann has been making them for five years. The company
hopes within two years to be making 1,200 recumbents annually.
   Hansel said the Linear, which retails for about $850, is faster
than conventional bicycles.
   ``A recumbent would just walk away with it in a race,'' he said.
   The world record speed for bicycles _ 65 mph _ was set in the
mid-1960s by an aerodynamic recumbent.
   However, John Kukoda, a senior editor who road-tests bicycles
for Bicycling magazine, said the recumbent has its disadvantages.
   ``I think they're inferior going up hills because there's no way
to stand up. You're not able to use the biggest muscles in the
body, the rear-end and lower back. I found it takes a lot more
power and energy to climb hills,'' Kukoda said in a telephone
interview from the monthly's headquarters in Emmaus, Pa.
   James Finney of Iowa City disagrees. Finney and a companion,
Melanie Pot, plan on Aug. 2 to embark on a 44,000-mile journey
around the world riding Linear recumbents.
   ``When I'm going up a hill, I find I'm breathing easier and am
not as tired when I get to the top than if I were hunched over a
traditional bike. I'm able to recover a lot faster,'' Finney said.

   Doctors used maggots to clean up rotted
skin caused by a massive infection on a teen-ager's legs, and the
treatment resulted in a remarkable recovery, her parents said.
   Shannon Dillingham, 17, was stricken with meningococcemia, a
blood-borne bacterial infection that eventually caused her to
suffer heart failure, kidney problems, diseased skin and the loss
of one foot and the toes on the other foot.
   She was critically ill when she was taken to Children's Hospital
in Washington on May 11. She was in fair condition Monday, a
hospital spokeswoman said.
   Antibiotics used to treat the bacteria had caused blood clots,
which reduced the flow of blood to her legs, resulting in the
rotting of the skin on her lower legs, said the girl's father,
Thomas Dillingham.
   Her left foot and ankle and her toes on the right foot had to be
amputated. Then doctors pondered how to clean the remaining skin.
Antibiotics did not work fast enough.
   So on July 21, more than 1,500 fly larvae were scooped onto her
legs with tongue depressors and secured with tape.
   Maggots eat only dead flesh, leaving healthy skin intact, said
Dr. Alan Fields.
   After 36 hours, doctors used a high-pressure hose to wash them
from her legs.
   The skin grafts are taking and she will soon be fitted with
prostheses and learn to walk again, her family said.
   Dillingham called her recovery miraculous.
   He said the medical bills were expected to be as much as
$750,000.

<HEAD>Bush Administration Ready to Begin S&amp;L Bailout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is poised to begin
pumping money into the nation's failed savings and loan
institutions as soon as possible after the president signs the bill
on Wednesday.
   President Bush intends to enact the historic legislation in a
White House ceremony on Wednesday, said administration and
congressional sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. The
Treasury Department said it will borrow the first $5 billion
installment of the bailout on Thursday.
   The legislation, passed by Congress on Saturday, authorizes $50
billion in borrowing over the next 26 months to close or merge 500
insolvent S&amp;Ls. Of that, $20 billion must be borrowed in the next
eight weeks, before the end of the 1989 fiscal year.
   Treasury officials said $15 billion of this year's borrowing
will be used to replace high-rate certificates of deposit at some
of the 262 failed thrifts already under government control. The
goal is to reduce operating losses until regulators can rescue the
thrifts permanently.
   ``The effect ... may be quite significant,'' said Richard
Breeden, Bush's chief adviser on savings and loans. ``You're taking
some of the institutions that have been rate leaders out of the
marketplace. That will reduce pressure on all other institutions,
both banks and thrifts, that have had to pay a premium to compete
against these unhealthy firms.''
   The remaining $5 billion raised this year will be used to either
shut down or attract new owners to the thrifts in the worst
financial trouble. The first of these deals could be announced as
soon as this week.
   ``I think the process will begin very quickly,'' said spokesman
Alan Whitney of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which is
getting the job of managing the bailout.
   However, he said the frequency of rescues will be ``more
measured'' than the frantic pace struck at the end of last year,
when the Federal Home Loan Bank Board committed $16 billion in a
two-day spending spree to rescue 75 institutions.
   The legislation, in addition to funding the bailout, imposes
tough new financial standards on savings and loans and triggers the
most sweeping overall changes in the regulatory bureaucracy in 50
years.
   Among many changes, the Resolution Trust Corp., a new agency
headed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, will be created to
oversee the FDIC's management of the bailout.
   Whitney said an organizational meeting of the RTC board is
planned on the same day as the White House signing ceremony and
that the board will appoint an executive director. Officials said
the board likely will choose someone already within the government
as a temporary director until a permanent appointment is made.
   The administration originally planned to borrow only $10 billion
in fiscal year 1989, which ends Sept. 30. However, as part of a
deal struck with Congress just before final passage of the
legislation, it agreed to raise $20 billion this year.
   That will balloon the 1989 deficit to near $170 billion, the
highest in three years.
   The government will raise another $30 billion for rescues in
1990 and 1991, but as part of the compromise the administration
will borrow that money through a new, quasi-private agency and the
spending will not be counted in the deficit.
   The Treasury Department said it will borrow the first $5 billion
on Thursday by auctioning 247-day cash management bills, which the
government must be repay on April 19.
   In a related development, the FDIC said it is taking over nine
insolvent S&amp;Ls in Louisiana, bring the total under government
control to 262 in 33 states.
   Meanwhile, one of the first institutions taken over by
regulators this year, Cartersville Federal Savings Bank of Georgia,
was sold to the Prudential Insurance Co. of America. Prudential is
investing $20 million for $56.9 million in assets. No government
assistance is involved.

<HEAD>Agriculture Secretary Seeking End to Farm Export Subsidies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter is
stepping up his call for a global agreement to end export subsidies
for farm goods as the end of the current round of international
trade talks looms.
   ``The economic case for reform can hardly be more compelling,''
Yeutter told the U.S. Feed Grains Council on Monday. ``The
resistance is political.''
   U.S. negotiators have been pushing the European Community in the
current Uruguay Round of trade talks to set a deadline for ending
all practices that distort agricultural markets. Thus far the
Europeans have declined.
   The negotiations, aimed at updating the 97-nation General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, have 18 months to run.
   ``The EC view seemingly is that such distortions should continue
forever _ a most discouraging outlook indeed for the developing
countries and for European consumers,'' Yeutter said.
   Yeutter, U.S. trade representative before taking over at the
Agriculture Department this year, is a longstanding critic of
export subsidies. His remarks in Chicago contained a new barrage of
choice rhetoric on the issue.
   He described the current system of subsidies under which
governments pay farmers and exporters to slash prices and thus
stimulate overseas sales as a game of ``fool's monopoly'' and said
the place to ``put an end to this madness is the Uruguay Round of
Multilateral Trade Negotiations.''
   Yeutter also acknowledged in effect that the United States is
often an active player in the subsidy game. ``Our European
colleagues have said repeatedly that there are no angels in
agriculture trade,'' he said. ``The question is, how do we get
closer to heaven?''
   He took aim at two lingering criticisms of the American position
in the talks. ``There are some who say that the U.S. proposal is
unrealistic _ that governments cannot and should not get completely
out of agriculture,'' he said. ``But that is not the U.S.
proposal.''
   Yeutter reiterated that the United States has no complaint about
financial supports for agriculture as long as they avoid distortion
of global markets. ``We have called only for the elimination of
trade-distorting measures over a period of time sufficient to allow
farmers to adapt to the new environment.''
   He also scoffed at the complaint that the negotiators have never
agreed on a definition of which practices are ``trade distorting.''
``We have 18 months, the final stage of the Uruguay Round, to
decide that,'' he said.
   Yeutter, however, left no doubt as to his view. ``Perhaps the
most vivid example is grain,'' he said. ``Ten years ago the EC had
net imports of nearly 20 million tons. Now the EC has net annual
exports of about 30 million tons. Their stated goal was self
sufficiency. But that goal was reached long ago.''
   ``The Community now uses billions of European currency units to
unload its surplus production on the world market, undercutting
lower cost competitors.
   ``In contrast the U.S., most unwisely, has unilaterally disarmed
itself by taking vast amounts of land out of production. That
action has helped support prices everywhere, but the result has
been a loss in market share.''

   Squalid living conditions in poverty-ridden
``colonias'' along the Mexican border was the topic of a July 25
chat between Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter and House
Agriculture Committee Chairman E. (Kika) de la Garza, D-Texas.
   The colonias, or shantytowns, often lack such basic facilities
as safe drinking water, elementary sanitation and paved streets.
Several are located in de la Garza's district in south Texas, and
the chairman has come under increasing pressure to do something
about them.
   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader criticized de la Garza at a
committee meeting two years ago over the painful situation in the
colonias, and community activists have turned up the heat since
then.
   Yeutter on Monday announced a $5.5 million package of loans and
grants targeted for water and sewer projects in colonias in Texas,
New Mexico, Arizona and California.
   The funds will be available Oct. 1 and represent 10 percent of
the Farmers Home Administration office reserve, which is held for
emergency use to ease health hazards connected with community water
and waste treatment, the Agriculture Department said.

   Max Carl, the lead singer of the band .38
Special, says his Nebraska roots and family values have kept his
perspective in check despite the topsy-turvy life as a rock 'n'
roll star.
   ``When everything goes awry in the music biz, when they don't
like your demo tape and the telephone calls stop coming _ and it's
hot and smoggy outside _ your kid's there and starts giggling or
gets jam all over you, it doesn't matter anymore. Because that's
your kid, and your kid is great,'' he said.
   Carl, 39, joined .38 Special two years ago when the 12-year-old
band was looking for a new lead singer. A few months ago, ``Second
Chance,'' with Carl as vocalist, hit No. 1 one on the adult
listening chart and No. 2 on the rock charts.
   He said the most difficult part of being in the band is leaving
his wife of 18 years, Mary, and children, Eva, 10, and Nick, 8,
when the group goes on tour. But he said his family has been
supportive.
   ``I've walked away from a lot of opportunities and made a lot of
sacrifices because of my family. Because whatever happens, they're
there,'' he said.

   AIDS activist Belinda Mason is moving
back to her western Kentucky home, and she may have fences to mend.
   Mason, a member of the National Commission on AIDS and the
president of the National Association of People With AIDS, left
Hartford, Ky., two years ago after she found she had the virus.
   Often in speeches around the country, Mason told the story of
how hard it was for her to find AIDS information and support in
rural Kentucky and of how the local municipal pool closed for a
week after she swam in it.
   The media gave Hartford a ``bad rap'' for focusing on the
swimming pool story, she said. She believes the acts of kindness
and compassion she experienced from people in the community were
much more important.
   Mason became infected with the AIDS virus two years ago from a
blood transfusion after she had complications while giving birth to
her second child.
   Mason, 31, her husband, Stephen Carden, and their two children
have been living in southern Indiana for the last two years. She is
looking forward to returning to Hartford.
   ``I'll be glad to get back because there are a lot of people
there who have helped me enormously,'' Mason said last week.

   NBC isn't alone in its appeal of a
multimillion-dollar libel award to entertainer Wayne Newton: Some
of the nation's top news organizations have joined the network's
fight.
   A jury in Las Vegas awarded Newton $19.3 million in damages over
allegations that NBC libeled Newton by linking him to mob figures
in the purchase of a hotel. A judge later reduced the award to $5.3
million.
   In its appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, NBC said
the award to Newton was ``excessive and insupportable.''
   Joining NBC in friends-of-the-court briefs filed last month were
CBS, Capital Cities@ABC, Fox Broadcasting, Gannett Co., The New
York Times Co., Dow Jones &amp; Co., Copley Press and Chronicle
Publishing, according to Monday's editions of the Las Vegas
Review-Journal.
   Newton's attorney, Morton Galane, said he consented to the other
media supporting NBC so the appeals court could be hear ``all
possible arguments.''

   Gerry Spence, the maverick trial attorney and
author of ``And Justice for None,'' says the final frontier of
injustice can be found behind the closed doors of corporate
boardrooms.
   ``If I had to identify a single enemy in this country,'' Spence
said in a recent interview, ``it would be ... the corporation. This
king controls and owns our judicial system, controls and owns our
congressmen and our presidents, pulls the strings of our media and
washes the brains of our children.''
   ``A justice system reflects the power structure and so the power
structure is corporate America,'' he said. ``The purpose of the
system is to maintain the status quo.''
   Spence, who lives in Jackson, Wyo., and also keeps a home in
Santa Barbara, Calif., gained prominence when he tackled chemical
giant Kerr-McGee in 1979 to win a $10.5 million jury award for the
heirs of Karen Silkwood.
   A federal appeals court reversed the award. Spence said the
family eventually settled for ``little more than a single year's
interest on the jury's original award.''
   Silkwood, a workers' rights advocate, was killed in 1974 in a
car crash on her way to meet a reporter from The New York Times to
talk about alleged exposure of workers to plutonium.

<HEAD>Iowa Uses 16-Inch Guns in Firing Exercise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The USS Iowa's test firing of its 16-inch guns
marks their first use since an explosion killed 47 sailors in
April, but a Navy spokesman says the turret involved in the blast
was not used.
   The test took place Friday without incident while the ship was
deployed for the Mideastern hostage crisis, Navy spokesman Lt. Greg
Smith said Monday.
   Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Carlyle Trost had ordered a
moratorium on the use of the weapons in all ships shortly after the
incident April 19 in which 47 sailors were killed, but that
decision was modified in June.
   Because fleet commanders need to respond to the possibility of
war, attack, or other contingencies, the so-called ``live-fire
training'' was permitted.
   ``The test was successful and without incident,'' Smith said.
   Smith said guns from two of the Iowa's three turrets were used
in the exercise. The No. 2 turret, the one involved in the April
explosion, was not used, he said.
   The Navy has yet to release the results of its investigation
into the explosion in the Iowa's No. 2 gun turret, one of the worst
naval disasters since the Vietnam war.
   The report has been submitted to the commander of surface forces
for the Atlantic Fleet in Norfolk, Va., and will eventually land on
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's desk after being passed up the
chain of command.
   The Iowa was one of several ships dispatched to the eastern
Mediterranean as part of the U.S. show of military force ordered in
response to the ongoing hostage crisis.
   The Iowa was in the Mediterranean to make a port call in
Marseilles, France, but cut short its visit to head closer to
Lebanon last week.
   Smith said the commander for the 6th fleet in the Mediterranean,
Vice Adm. James D. Williams, authorized the test firing.
   Williams, aboard the guided missile cruiser USS Belknap,
canceled a four-day call at the Soviet port of Sevastopol last week
in order to oversee the U.S. Navy movements in the area.
   Smith refused to discuss the number of guns used in the exercise
or the amount of explosives used to pack them. There are three guns
on each of the Iowa's gun turrets.
   Each gun can fire projectiles weighing up to 2,700 pounds at a
maximum range of 23 miles. It also has 12 5-inch guns.
   The battleship is also equipped with a variety of other weapons,
including Tomahawk and Harpoon cruise missiles.
   The only U.S. aircraft carrier in the 6th Fleet, the USS Coral
Sea, also is in the eastern Mediterranean, said a Defense
Department official.
   The aircraft carrier USS America, ordered from Singapore to the
north Arabia Sea as part of the show-the-flag exercise, was
scheduled to be on station today, the official added.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in remarks to reporters on
Monday, confirmed the positioning of the two carriers.
   Although the America was required to cross thousands of miles of
ocean to reach its station, Cheney called the deployment ``not that
unusual for us.
   ``We always have at least one carrier group in the Med ... There
are various and sundry other forces available in that part of the
world, as is normally the case,'' he added.

<HEAD>FAA Cancels Contract for New Landing Systems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL PAGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says it still plans to bring a
new generation of landing systems to the nation's airports by the
end of the century despite falling three years behind schedule and
canceling the main contract.
   The Federal Aviation Administration on Monday ended a $79
million contract with the Hazeltine Corp. to build 178 microwave
landing systems and said it will ask for new contractors' proposals
later this year.
   The company was chosen in 1984 to build systems that are to
replace the instrument landing systems used for years at most
airports.
   In a prepared statement, the FAA said engineering and production
problems at the Commack, N.Y.,-based company have delayed the
program by three years.
   But the FAA said it remains committed to putting the new
microwave landing systems at major U.S. airports in 1998 and at all
airports around 2000.
   Hazeltine has delivered two of the systems sought in the
contract. One has been installed at the Lebanon, N.H., airport.
   The FAA said it will buy 26 systems from other sources, test
that equipment and then decide whether to move ahead. The FAA said
it plans to award a new contract in 1991.
   Hazeltine, through its parent Emerson Electric Co. of St. Louis,
said it will sue over the FAA decision.
   The microwave landing system is intended to give pilots greater
flexibility in their landing approaches at airports and help
airports increase their flight capacity.
   The system uses high-frequency microwaves to direct planes to
landings, allowing them to make curved and steeper approaches
outside the strict paths necessary under the current system. The
system is virtually immune to weather hazards.
   In its letter to Hazeltine, the FAA said the company has
``failed to perform and deliver in accordance with the schedule of
the subject contract.''
   But Hazeltine blamed the government for production delays,
saying problems involving payments and timing of deliveries were
the result of changes the FAA made in the contract after it was
awarded.
   The agency had planned on putting new microwave systems at the
Laconia and Manchester airports in New Hampshire, but FAA spokesman
John Leyden said that because of the delays it may put early
systems at high-profile, high-volume airports such as John F.
Kennedy International in New York.
   The FAA plans to buy 750 of the new systems, if Congress
approves.

<HEAD>John Hinckley Says He Backs Gun Control</HEAD>

   John Hinckley says his attack on President
Reagan could have been prevented with proper gun control.
   Hinckley, now a patient at a mental hospital, says he shot
Reagan in a ``paradoxical rage induced by the constant use of
Valium.''
   In papers filed in U.S. District Court, Hinckley also sought
permission to be interviewed ``on rare occasions by other
responsible members of the news media ... including The Washington
Post.''
   ``I believe that my rehabilitation and my full recovery can only
be aided by my ability to communicate to the people of the United
States,'' said Hinckley.
   Hinckley's lawyer, Russell F. Canan, moved for a court order
permitting Hinckley to be interviewed for the ABC News program
Prime Time.
   Hinckley said that if a waiting period for buying weapons had
been required, ``I believe I would not have gone forward with the
effort to shoot the president.''
   The fact that there is no waiting period ``raises serious
questions about the gun laws,'' Hinckley said in the papers.
   Hinckley said that on two occasions he was arrested while in
possession of weapons in the same city where President Carter was
appearing.
   ``The fact that ... no action was taken by the United States
Secret Service raises serious questions,'' said Hinckley.
   Authorities at St. Elizabeths Hospital where Hinckley is in
custody say they will never allow Hinckley to be interviewed, Canan
said in the court papers filed Friday.

   A former Army intelligence officer is under a
judge's order not to discuss his complaints of waste and fraud in a
secret plan for maintaining the government after a nuclear attack.
   U.S. District Court Judge Norma Johnson issued the gag order
against Fred Westerman and his lawyer, Frank Mroz, after their
names appeared in a magazine article about the ``continuity of
government'' program, according to government sources.
   The program is aimed at enabling the government to regroup in
the event of a nuclear attack. Westerman owns a small firm that
provided security services related to the program to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
   A Senate committee investigator attempted to interview Westerman
as a result of the article in U.S. News &amp; World Report, but was
told the judge's order extended to conversations with Congress,
said the sources, who spoke Monday on condition of anonymity.
Johnson issued the order a week ago today.
   Westerman in March 1987 began alleging there were irregularities
in the program, according to papers on file in the U.S. Court of
Claims. Westerman has since been made a target of the
investigation, which he claims is an effort at retaliation.
   Details of Westerman's allegations are contained in a federal
court suit that was placed under seal early this year because of
the highly classified nature of the project.
   The project includes mobile communications systems and
command-post bunkers around the country, according to the magazine.
   After Johnson's gag order last week, a computerized docket sheet
at the federal courthouse was altered, so that case now is entitled
merely ``Sealed v. Sealed.''
   The docket previously had said that Westerman and his firm,
Systems Evaluation Inc., are suing the Army, three federal
agencies, a private corporation and an Army Corps of Engineers
officer who oversaw his contract.
   U.S. News reported that the Pentagon, the Justice Department,
the House Armed Services Committee and a federal grand jury are
looking into the continuity of government program.
   The investigations reportedly focus on allegations that
contracts were awarded improperly or that payments were made for
work not properly done, resulting in millions of dollars in costs
that may not be justified.
   On Christmas Eve 1987, after Westerman continued to make
allegations to superiors, the Army told him that his contract was
not being renewed despite earlier assurances that it would be,
according to papers he filed in the U.S. Court of Claims. He says
he is still owed $500,000 in unreimbursed costs.
   Westerman, a retired major who spent 20 years as an Army
counterintelligence officer, took his allegations to the FBI, the
Justice Department and the inspector general's office at the
emergency management agency.
   In January, two months after filing his case with the claims
court, he was informed that his contract was the focus of a
criminal investigation by the Justice Department for possible
fraud. He recently received a ``target'' letter from the U.S.
attorney's office in Baltimore informing him he is the focus of
that probe.
   His claims court case is suspended pending the outcome of the
criminal investigation.
   ``I think there are certain individuals in the government who
are using this process to ruin my client financially,'' Mroz said
Monday after a hearing on the claims court case.
   Mroz said the individuals, whom he did not identify, are
engaging in ``retribution ... in connection with certain
allegations by my client about waste and fraud as well as their
attempted cover-up of their own wrongdoing in the operation of his
contract.''
   Army spokesman Lt. Col. John Chapla said regarding the
allegations of irregularities in the secret program, ``the
appropriate authorities within the Congress and the executive
branch review (the program) regularly.''

   Japan's troubled governing party on Tuesday
overwhelmingly elected Toshiki Kaifu to become party president and
succeed Prime Minister Sousuke Uno in a vote likely to influence
the nation's future political balance.
   The 58-year-old Kaifu, a two-time former education minister, is
the party's second new leader in two months. Like Uno, he has
little power base of his own and hopes to overcome scandals and a
tax policy that loosened the governing Liberal Democrats' grip on
power for the first time since 1955.
   Party officials said Kaifu received 279 votes. Yoshiro Hayashi,
a former health and welfare minister, received 120 votes, while
Shintaro Ishihara, a novelist and former transportation minister
from the party's nationalist wing, received 48, with four invalid
votes out of the total of 451.
   Party members watched silently as six officials counted the
ballots and placed them in separate black lacquer trays, but broke
into applause when the winner was announced. Kaifu rose from his
seat and bowed.
   In an attempt at greater democracy, the Liberal Democrats
decided for the first time in 17 years to select the president by a
vote of their Parliament members and 47 delegates from prefectural
party organizations.
   The party president is expected to be confirmed as prime
minister on Wednesday by the lower house of Parliament, where the
governing party has a large majority.
   In elections July 23, the Liberal Democrats lost their majority
in the upper house for the first time since the party was formed 34
years ago.
   Meanwhile Emperor Akihito officially opened a new session of
Parliament on Tuesday, and called for the lawmakers to promote
world peace and the nation's prosperity, Kyodo News Service
reported.
   Noboru Takeshita stepped down as prime minister June 2 to take
responsibility for the Recruit influence-buying scandal, which
reached the top ranks of the governing party, bureaucracy and
business.
   His successor, Sousuke Uno, was plagued by reports that he kept
paid mistresses, and announced his resignation July 24 to take
responsibility for the loss in upper-house elections.
   All three candidates to replace Uno agreed in speeches to party
members Monday that the Liberal Democrats should revise an
unpopular 3 percent sales tax that outraged Japanese housewives and
contributed to the loss of the upper house. General elections for
the lower house are expected before spring.
   ``The situation the Liberal Democratic Party now faces is the
worst since its founding'' in 1955, Kaifu said in his speech, and
declared: ``I believe the LDP's resurrection is the only way for
Japan to maintain freedom, democracy, peace and affluence.''
   He said Japan also should play a greater role in the world.
   ``It is not enough for Japan to simply maintain the security
treaty with the United States and not to play a more responsible
role now that Japan has grown so powerful and economically
affluent,'' he said. ``We are responsible for fulfilling the
world's expectations of Japan.''
   Kaifu said Japan might be able to help President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reform efforts in the Soviet Union and contribute to
the opening of Eastern European countries.
   Ishihara, 56, said in his speech: ``Any further decline in the
Liberal Democratic Party's strength threatens Japan's free
enterprise system, which has enabled the people, through their
efforts, to create the most dynamic economy in the world.''
   Stressing the image problem, Hayashi, 62, said: ``Public anger
toward the party has not calmed down even after our election
defeat. There seem to be persistent distrust and anger among the
people.''

<HEAD>With AM-Japan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In 1960, a cocky 29-year-old politician predicted
that in another 29 years he would be prime minister of Japan.
   Toshiki Kaifu made that prophecy reality Tuesday as he was voted
to head the Liberal Democratic Party, assuring him of becoming
Japan's 19th postwar premier.
   A few weeks ago it seemed most unlikely. Kaifu didn't figure in
the early race to succeed Sousuke Uno, who is stepping down after
less than two months in the wake of his party's thrashing in recent
parliamentary elections.
   But with senior party leaders virtually eliminated from serving
in the nation's highest office because of their own links to an
influence-peddling scandal, Kaifu was called on as an experienced
politician with a clean image to lead the party out of its current
crisis.
   The head of the Liberal Democrats becomes prime minister because
of the party's majority in the lower house of Parliament. Kaifu is
expected to be formally named on Wednesday.
   The party lost its majority in the upper house in an election
last month, forcing Uno, already besieged by charges that he kept
paid mistresses, to take responsibility for the setback and resign.
   ``We must overcome the obstacles, which I deeply regret,'' Kaifu
told party members in a speech Monday. ``We must seriously consider
the harsh reality of the election results.''
   A veteran politician who served as education minister in the
Cabinets of two prime ministers, Kaifu is Japan's second-youngest
postwar leader. Only Kakuei Tanaka, premier in 1972-74, was
younger, taking office at age 54.
   An eloquent speaker who studied debating in college, Kaifu
learned his political ropes as a protege of the late Prime Minister
Takeo Miki, and was once considered a future party heavyweight.
   His influence waned, however, as the small intra-party faction
to which he belonged became overshadowed by larger groupings within
the party.
   The Liberal Democrats turned to him amid calls for a younger
leadership, and because of his support for political reform, which
he inherited from Miki.
   He was also a compromise candidate between the main rival
factions, whose leaders were tainted by the so-called Recruit Co.
scandal. Kaifu himself has acknowledged receiving $108,000 in
donations from Recruit, but has claimed they were all legitimate
political contributions.
   He moved quickly to repair damage to the Liberal Democrats since
formally declaring his candidacy on Friday, appealing particularly
to women, who felt estranged by allegations about Uno's affairs and
a new consumption tax forced into law by the party earlier this
year.
   ``We must think of constructing a social balance between men and
women that respects women's place in society and makes use of their
abilities,'' he said in his Monday speech.
   Kaifu's drawbacks are a lack of experience in foreign and
financial affairs, not heading his own faction and never having
served a top party post. Some political analysts therefore believe
his administration will end in October when the Liberal Democrats
elect a new party president for a two-year term.
   Others, however, believe Kaifu could last longer, depending on
how he fares in the coming three months.
   ``If he succeeds in hammering out his own color and philosophy,
there is a possibility his administration could last an
unexpectedly long time,'' Gakushuin University law professor
Hidekazu Kawai told the newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun.
   Kaifu considers the number 29 particularly significant. Aside
from his vow at age 29, he graduated from prestigious Waseda
University in the 29th year of the reign of the late Emperor
Hirohito, and was first elected to Parliament in Japan's 29th
general election.

<HEAD>Shrimpers Must Now Limit Trawls To 105 Minutes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists are threatening to take the
Commerce Department back to court over Secretary Robert Mosbacher's
decision allowing shrimpers to abandon devices that protect
endangered sea turtles in favor of regimented trawl times.
   The National Wildlife Federation and other conservation groups
argue that the Commerce Department must uphold the law requiring
shrimpers to equip their nets with turtle excluder devices, and
that limited trawling is ineffective in protecting sea turtles such
as the Kemp's ridley.
   Under a rule that took effect at 12:01 a.m. EDT today, shrimpers
were to begin pulling their nets every 105 minutes to check for
entangled sea turtles.
   Mosbacher predicted compliance with the limiting trawling times
would be far better than with the turtle excluder devices that
shrimpers loathe. But conservationists said only TEDs can save the
Kemp's ridley from extinction before the end of the century.

   MCI Corp. has criticized a complaint by
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. that MCI offered large business
customers illegally low prices to win their long-distance telephone
business.
   AT&amp;T officials said Monday they hope the complaint will lead to
a reversal of a Federal Communications Commission policy that
exempts AT&amp;T competitors from having to file tariffs with the FCC
detailing rates and other terms they offer customers.
   In its complaint to the FCC, AT&amp;T alleged that MCI has used
unlawful discriminatory discounts the past two years to win
contracts with the Pentagon, Merrill Lynch; Westin, Hilton and
Vista hotels; United Airlines, the University of Colorado and
Uniguard Security Insurance Co.
   MCI, which filed a similar complaint against AT&amp;T last year
after AT&amp;T won a contract for Holiday Inns' long-distance and
reservation system, called Monday's complaint a ``smokescreen.''

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Perry Rivkind, the volatile Florida immigration
chief who ignored orders to deport Nicaraguans but sent home
Haitian boat people, announced his resignation.
   Rivkind, district INS director since 1983, said Monday he would
resign Aug. 21 to teach criminal justice at a small college in
Virginia.
   Three years ago Rivkind refused to send back a group of
Nicaraguan refugees and announed he was flouting U.S. policies that
treated the Nicaraguans the same as other Central Americans, who
have no special immigration status.
   The more than 800,000 Cubans in South Florida _ the largest
Cuban community anywhere except the city of Havana _ admired
Rivkind's anti-communism and enforcement of an open-door policy for
Cuban refugees. Thousands of Nicaraguan refugees also live in the
region.
   Rivkind said the criticism that hurt him most were claims by
Haitians in Miami that his adherence to the federal order to send
Haitian boat people back home _ while allowing Nicaraguans to stay
_ was racist.
   He said it was ``simply not true'' that under his term Haitians
were discriminated against. ``I think it's dangerous and
irresponsible to make statements about discrimination in a
community as volatile as this.''
   ``It's true that my relationship with Mr. Rivkind has been up
and down some days. Sometimes we are friends, another time we are
enemies,'' said the Rev. Gerard Jean-Juste, a leader of the
100,000-member Haitian community here. ``I hope that the next
district director to come will provide equal justice, equal
treatment to the Haitian refugees as is given to the Cubans.''
   Rivkind said he tired of being held to official government
positions.
   ``I am one who likes to speak out on social issues, and
government sometimes says don't speak out,'' said Rivkind, who will
teach at Patrick Henry Community College in Martinsville, Va.

<TEXT>
   Adam Clayton of the Irish rock group U2
has been charged with possession of marijuana.
   The 29-year-old bass guitarist, dressed all in black, appeared
briefly in Dublin's District Court on Monday but under Irish law
was not required to enter a plea.
   Clayton was arrested near his Dublin home Sunday night and
charged with possessing marijuana and with having the drug with the
intent to supply someone else, police told the court.
   Judge Desmond Windle ordered Clayton to post bail of $710 and to
return to court on Sept. 1.
   If convicted of possession of marijuana, Clayton faces a maximum
fine of $1,420. Police said there is no fixed penalty for a
conviction for possession of the drug with intent to supply, and
the judge usually takes into account the circumstances of the
arrest and the amount of drug involved.
   Det. Michael Moody of the Garda Siochana, Ireland's police
force, told the court that when the first charge was read to him,
Clayton replied: ``There was nothing found in my possession.''
Clayton made no comment when the second charge was put to him,
Moody said.
   The musician stood with his hands clasped behind his back facing
the judge as the detective gave his evidence.
   The British-born musician became an Irish citizen earlier this
year.

<TEXT>
   A chemical company's chief executive will answer
questions about a toxic spill this week in a court case that
environmentalists and legal experts say could set a precedent for
punishing corporate negligence.
   U.S. District Judge Jack Tanner twice has refused to accept
pleas from officials representing Pennwalt Corp., a
Philadelphia-based chemical company charged with polluting a Tacoma
waterway in a 1985 toxic bleach spill, and requested the appearance
of chief executive and board Chairman Edwin E. Tuttle.
   ``Who is this corporation?'' Tanner asked in a hearing earlier
this year. ``I think the public is entitled to know who is
responsible.''
   Tuttle was to appear in court Wednesday, a company spokesman
said. Tuttle has declined to comment on his appearance.
   The case is the first in which the U.S. government based its
criminal investigation solely on corporate negligence, said
prosecutor David Marshall.
   ``To my knowledge, this is the first case of a federal judge's
ordering a particular individual from a corporate body to appear to
plead the guilt of the corporate entity,'' said David Skover,
professor of civil procedure and constitutional law at the
University of Puget Sound Law School.
   Skover predicted Tanner's tactic will be used again, possibly in
lawsuits against Exxon over the 11 million gallons of oil spilled
in Alaska's Prince William Sound.
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has said that Exxon is the
subject of a criminal investigation because of the March spill, the
nation's largest.
   ``The device used by Tanner may prove very effective in alerting
all corporations that the top executive will not be allowed to pass
the buck,'' Skover said.
   Environmentalists agreed that corporate executives will take
notice of the Pennwalt case.
   ``How can you be a corporate executive and not take
responsibility for your corporation?'' said David Ortman of the
Northwest office of Friends of the Earth. ``We no longer accept the
notion that corporations are faceless letterheads that can't be
threatened or held accountable.''
   The negligence charges in the case were aimed at corporate
officers and employees as well as the company, Marshall said.
   ``Corporations are run by people who are responsible for what
happens,'' he said.
   The only Pennwalt employee to admit wrongdoing was Tacoma plant
manager Orval J. High. He received two years' probation and a
$5,000 fine for negligently discharging pollutants and failing to
notify the Coast Guard.
   The case involved a spill of at least 75,000 gallons of a
chemical containing sodium dichromate into Tacoma's Hylebos
Waterway, which flows into Puget Sound. The spill occurred when a
180,000-gallon storage tank ruptured.
   Sodium dichromate is a toxic compound used as a bleach in the
paper industry. It contains hexavalent chromium, a cancer-causing
agent.
   Last year, a federal grand jury in Seattle indicted the company
and four company officers.
   On May 2, prosecutors and Pennwalt lawyers reached a plea
agreement, which called for the company to plead guilty to five
misdemeanor counts and pay a $1.1 million fine.
   The agreement covered two counts of negligently failing to
maintain adequate storage tanks at its Tacoma plant, two counts of
discharging pollutants, and one count of failing to promptly report
the spill to the Coast Guard.
   Charges against the company officials, including three
executives, were dropped. Tuttle was not charged.
   In May, Pennwalt's attorneys appeared at Tacoma's federal
courthouse to plead guilty to the reduced charges. But Tanner
refused to accept their pleas and asked that corporate officers
appear instead.
   In June, Pennwalt sent three corporate officers but Tanner
changed his mind. He asked to see Tuttle.
   Pennwalt spokesman Peter McCarthy declined to comment on the
company's reaction to Tanner's order except to say there was
``surprise.''
   In the Northwest, Pennwalt employs 135 people in Tacoma and 170
at a Portland, Ore., plant. The Tacoma operation produces chemicals
used in paper, adhesives and bleach. The company reported
first-quarter earnings of $28.5 million this year, on sales of
$279.9 million.

<HEAD>Launch of Japanese Weather Satellite Rocket Fails</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A three-stage rocket carrying a weather satellite
failed to lift off today when one of its three engines misfired
during countdown at a space center in southern Japan, officials
said.
   The $81 million H-1 rocket, capable of sending a 1,200-pound
satellite into geostationary orbit, failed to lift off at the
National Space Development Agency on Tanegashima Island, 616 miles
southwest of Tokyo, said NASDA spokesman Junji Oda.
   It was the space agency's first failure in 20 rocket launchings
since the agency successfully sent up the N-1 type rocket in 1975,
Oda said.
   He said the reason for the mishap was unknown.
   ``We fired the first stage, but something happened before it
reached the second stage and it was automatically stopped. At
present we don't know what it was,'' Oda said.
   Kishiro Nakamura, head of the Science and Technology Agency,
said he will seek a prompt report on the cause of the failure.
   ``The accident happened at a time when we have just started to
put more effort into space development. We have to be able to earn
the public's understanding and trust in space development,''
Nakamura said.
   Before starting an investigation into the causes of the failure,
the agency has to extract fuel and other materials from the rocket
to avoid an explosion, Oda said.
   If the trouble is not too serious and can be fixed ``without too
much effort,'' another trial could be possible by the end of
September, he said.
   The H-1 rocket carries the No. 4 weather satellite, which will
replace the current weather satellite known as ``Himawari No. 3,''
or ``Sunflower No. 3.'' The present satellite is capable of
pursuing its mission for another year or so, according to Oda.
   The launch was originally scheduled for Aug. 1, but it was
postponed twice by bad weather.

   A man battling his wife for custody of
their fertilized eggs says he would rather leave the seven
pre-embryos in cold storage than let them be born to a single
parent.
   Junior Lewis Davis said after the first day of his unprecedented
divorce trial Monday that he comes from a broken home and knows the
hardships it can cause.
   ``I just simply do not wish to have any children out there for
the fact it would be in a single-parent situation,'' he said. ``I
don't think it would be fair to me or the child.''
   Mary Sue Davis, who is fighting to have the seven pre-embryos
implanted in her womb, said they represent her best chance at
motherhood.
   ``I'm quite capable of raising a child by myself,'' she said.
``I don't think he has to worry about that.''
   Both Davises were to testify today in Blount County Circuit
Court before Judge W. Dale Young.
   Junior Davis, 30, sued for divorce in February and asked the
court to prevent his wife from having any of the eggs implanted.
Mary Sue Davis, 28, says she has the greater claim to the eggs
because she went to more trouble to produce them and potentially
can do more for them.
   The Davises were married nine years ago and entered the in vitro
fertilization program at a Knoxville hospital three years later
after Mrs. Davis had four tubal pregnancies.
   In vitro fertilization first was used successfully in England in
1978. It involves fertilization of eggs in a laboratory dish. The
fertilized eggs can be implanted in a womb and brought to term
naturally. The success rate, according to testimony Monday, is
about 18 percent nationwide.
   There originally were nine fertilized eggs; two were
unsuccessfully implanted before the couple's marriage broke down.
   Dr. I. Ray King, who runs the in vitro fertilization program,
testified Monday the seven pre-embryos are between four and eight
cells. A pre-embryo is an egg that has been fertilized for less
then 12 to 14 days.
   Other testimony Monday described pre-embryos as a mass of
undifferentiated cells with no human characteristics.
   But King testified the pre-embryos represent potential life. He
said they should not be destroyed, whatever the outcome of the
divorce suit, but provided to some other infertile couple.
   Jay Christenberry, Mrs. Davis' attorney, said in his opening
statement, ``The question of how we classify the embryos is vital.''
   ``I think it's important we recognize these are living cells,''
he said. ``They may or may not develop, but ... we believe they
deserve protection.''
   Junior Davis' attorney Charles Clifford said Davis ``wants to
leave the status quo in effect. He doesn't plan to alter the
pre-embryos, but he does ask that any use of them require his
consent.''
   Christenberry has tried to show that Mrs. Davis might not have
another chance to go through in vitro fertilization, which produces
so-called ``test-tube babies'' because the actual fertilization
takes place outside the womb in a laboratory dish.
   But both King and John A. Robertson, a University of Texas law
professor called by Clifford as an expert witness, said she
probably could go through the process again.
   Robertson said he believes there are some in vitro programs that
would accept a single woman as a client; or, he said, she might
remarry.

   Kelly, mother of seven litters and
beloved golden retriever of Town Council President Sandra Johanson,
is missing, the victim of what looks like a political dognapping.
   It started as nothing more than a lost dog story.
   But Kelly's disappearance turned sinister after 12 hours when a
man telephoned Mrs. Johanson's home and said:
   ``Get off the council and you'll get your dog.''
   Monday, one week after Kelly's disappearance, Mrs. Johanson
calmly retold the mysterious story, weary from grief-stricken
appeals on radio and television and a week of sleepless nights.
   Ginger and Chris, Kelly's daughter and former mate,
respectively, are upset, Mrs. Johanson said.
   ``The entire family is devastated. We haven't been right for a
week,'' she said.
   It all began the night of July 31. That was the last time
anybody saw Kelly. The 7-year-old canine had been let out for her
nightly cavort with Ginger to range over the Johanson's 64 acres in
this community of chicken and dairy farms and plantations of sod
for suburban lawns.
   At 9:15 p.m. Ginger came home _ alone.
   Mrs. Johanson, a Republican housewife and lifelong resident of
this town of 6,700, 45 miles south of Providence, said the apparent
dognapping is the work of a sick mind rather than a political foe.
Rumors have sprung up nevertheless.
   The 48-year-old Mrs. Johanson entered politics five years ago by
running for the five-member town council. She quickly moved to the
top to become the first woman chief executive in this town,
incorporated in 1757.
   ``I shouldn't have any enemies,'' Mrs. Johanson said, cradling
one of Kelly's latest puppies from a litter of nine.
   But it has been widely speculated that Mrs. Johanson's missing
dog is somehow related to the controversial firing last November of
the town dump custodian and the highway supervisor. The latter was
later reinstated, then resigned.
   Mrs. Johanson refused to comment about this, saying only that
her vote for dismissal was just one of five unanimous votes and
that the matter is the subject of a court suit over alleged
mismanagement of town property.
   ``I'm not pointing the finger at anybody,'' she said.
   Others disagreed.
   The general feeling around town, said Lorraine Russo, temporary
town clerk, is ``it's a personal vendetta against this woman.''
   And Police Chief George Weeden has speculated the apparent
dognapping had something to do with ``hard feelings from somewhere
in the past.''
   Weeden said Monday that he has no suspects but lots of tips.
``It's an important case to us,'' he said. ``It's sensitive. It's a
family pet.''
   Mrs. Johanson's fondness for her dogs is well known.
   A framed family portrait of Kelly, Ginger and Christopher adorns
the kitchen of the Johansons' 18th-century farmhouse.
   The dogs regularly play ball on the beach, Mrs. Johanson said.
``They go get the newspapers on Sunday mornings. They go shopping,
they go visiting with us.''
   There is a reward for Kelly's return, but Mrs. Johanson won't
say how much. ``How can you put a price tag on someone who is part
of your family?''
   The Johansons held a family powwow to decide whether Mrs.
Johanson should quit for the sake of Kelly's return. For now at
least, they decided against abdicating, dog or no dog.
   ``If I resign, if somebody gets their way on one thing, what's
next? I am not leaving the council at this time,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from the ``Declaration
of Tela'' signed Monday in Honduras, which calls for the disbanding
of the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels, as translated from Spanish by
The Associated Press:
   The five Central American presidents declared that it ``is
necessary to complete the steps agreed upon in Esquipulas II
(Guatemala, 1987) to reach a strong and lasting peace, such as
putting into effect the compliance of the promises made by the
presidents in the declarations and agreements that have been
achieved successively in Alajuela (Costa Rica, 1988) and Costa del
Sol (El Salvador, 1989).''
   As a result, the presidents pledged ``to prevent the use of each
country's territory to destabilize governments in other Central
American countries ...''
   They agreed ``to demobilize, repatriate or voluntarily relocate
to Nicaragua or third countries members of the Nicaraguan
resistance and their families.''
   Similarly, they supported an accord reached Monday by ``Honduras
and Nicaragua under which Nicargua agreed to withdraw a lawsuit
before the International Court of Justice'' accusing Honduras of
supporting the Contra rebels.
   The presidents of Guatemala, El Salvador and Costa Rica declared
their ``moral support'' of this agreement.
   The presidents then agreed to ``ratify the demand of armed
groups in the region, especially the FMLN (the leftist Farabundo
Marti Liberation Front guerrillas fighting the government of El
Salvador), currently in conflict, to desist from these actions ...
cease hostilities immediately, and engage in a dialogue to abandon
their armed struggle.''
   The presidents called for ``the incorporation of the FMLN into
the democratic life'' of El Salvador.
   ``The presidents recognize the efforts of the Guatemalan
government to strengthen its process of national reconciliation
through dialogue, in which the National Reconciliation Commission
has a strong presence.''
   The presidents added:
   ``We reiterate the call for armed groups to abandon their
hostile actions within the spirit of this agreeement and
incorporate themselves into institutional politics through the
process of national reconciliation.''
   The presidents also agreed ``to solicit the United Nations to
adopt the necessary measures to put into effect the mechanism of
verification in terms of security in that Honduras and Nicaragua
have arrived at an agreement that includes the withdrawal (of the
Contras) from Honduras ... and reiterate our request for the
establishment of an international peace keeping force.''
   The presidents finally declared they ``condemn energetically the
trafficking and use of drugs.''

   The State Department condemned the arrest of three
Cuban human rights activists, and a rights group said the
detentions confirmed Cuba's status as one of the world's ``most
rigidly totalitarian states.''
   Elizardo Sanchez, head of the Cuban Commission of Human Rights
and National Conciliation, was arrested early Sunday when about 20
security policemen showed up at his home soon after 5 a.m., his
wife Margarita said Monday.
   Hiram Abi Cobas, acting head of the Human Rights Party of Cuba,
and Hubert Jerez, president of the Jose Marti Commission on Human
rights, also were arrested, according to Ramon Cernuda, a Cuban
exile and book publisher here.
   There was no word on why authorities had detained the men.
   Mrs. Sanchez said friends are helping her work for her husband's
release.
   ``I haven't spoken to him yet,'' Mrs. Sanchez told The
Associated Press in a phone interview Monday. ``I spoke to my
brother-in-law this morning and he told me he was still in jail. My
mother-in-law is going to Villa Marista, where we think he is being
held.''
   Meanwhile, the State Department released a statement condemning
the arrest as a ``flagarant human rights violation.''
   ``We hope concerned members of the international community,
including the United Nations, will join us in condemning not only
Sanchez' arrest, but also the continued imprisonment of other
prominent human rights leaders,'' said Richard Boucher, a State
Department spokesman.
   Members of Sanchez' organization said he had spoken to American
reporters about human rights on the island a few days before his
arrest.
   Cernuda said Americas Watch, a New York-based human rights
organization, and Amnesty International, were already working for
the release of the workers.
   ``In jailing Sanchez, Cobas and Jerez, the Cuban government has
demonstrated that it deserves its reputation as one of the world's
most rigidly totalitarian states,'' a statement released Monday by
Americas Watch said.

<HEAD>New Prime Minister-Designate says Anti-Nuclear Policy to Continue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man elected today to succeed
outgoing Prime Minister David Lange said he intends to maintain a
tough anti-nuclear decree that bans U.S. warships from New Zealand
ports.
   ``Our nuclear policy won't be changed,'' Deputy Prime Minister
Geoffrey Palmer told a news conference after being named head of
the governing Labor Party today. Lange, 47, resigned Monday amid
party wrangling over economic policy, citing health reasons.
   ``We want to have dialogue with the Americans, we want to have
discussions, but I wouldn't want to suggest that there is going to
be any prospect of immediate change in that respect at all,''
Palmer said.
   The U.S. State Department said Monday that it hoped the next
prime minister would reassess the policy that led to the the
collapse of the ANZUS military alliance with America and Australia.
   Lange arranged to visit Gov.-General Sir Paul Reeves today to
formally submit his resignation. Upon acceptance of the
resignation, Palmer was to formally become prime minister.
   Helen Clark, 40, who was health minister, will become deputy
prime minister.
   Palmer, 47, former attorney-general and justice minister, was
elected leader of the traditionally left-leaning Labor Party at a
meeting of the party's caucus following Lange's sudden announcement
that he was resigning after five years.
   Lange said he wanted to step down while he was still on top. He
suffered a heart attack a year ago.
   He noted recent opinion polls show his personal popularity and
that of his Labor Party government are increasing.
   But observers pointed to party infighting over the economy and
last week's reappointment to the Cabinet of Roger Douglas, a
conservative archrival of Lange who Lange dismissed as finance
minister last year.
   Lange's government denied permission for U.S. warships to enter
New Zealand ports in 1984 because Washington refused to confirm or
deny whether specific ships carried atomic weapons.
   The United States in 1986 retaliated by suspending all military
cooperation with the government in Wellington, making it impossible
to operate the Australian-New Zealand-U.S. (ANZUS) defense alliance.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday: ``We are
hopeful ... that Prime Minister Lange's successor will reassess New
Zealand's anti-nuclear policy.
   ``We hope he will address with us the differences between our
two countries on security-related issues,'' he said.
   There was no immediate reaction to Lange's resignation from
France, which was embroiled in a major diplomatic row with New
Zealand after French agents in 1985 bombed the environmentalist
ship Rainbow Warrior in Wellington harbor, causing the death of a
Dutch photographer.
   Last year Lange allowed Douglas to deregulate industries, remove
subsidies and privatize government departments. But he opposed
Douglas' proposed flat tax among other ideas, saying it would hit
the poor hardest.
   ``There is no place in New Zealand for deregulated labor
markets. There is no place in New Zealand for doing away with a
minimum wage,'' Lange said. ``There is no place in New Zealand for
policies which would reduce women to some convenient chattels of
the marketplace.''

   Authorities shut down a day care
service while they investigate the death of a 3-year-old girl who
was left in a closed car for more than three hours on a sweltering
afternoon.
   Ebony Skinner was left alone in a late-model Cadillac with its
windows rolled up from 12:30 p.m. to 4 p.m. Friday, police Capt.
Richard Mulhall said. The car was parked in the driveway of the day
care operator's home, which is where the business is located.
   The girl was one of seven children between the ages of 3 and 6
who had returned from a brief shopping trip with the day care
operator, Carrie Allison.
   ``It's possible she fell asleep and was quiet in the back,''
Mulhall said. The other children and their parents were being
questioned.
   Temperatures were as high as 94 on Friday, while the humidity
was oppressive. Medical experts said under those conditions a child
can begin dehydrating in 30 minutes.
   The state medical examiner's office said Ebony died of
hyperthermia, a condition in which a person loses the ability to
sweat and thereby control body temperature.
   Mulhall said the car's windows were closed because its air
conditioning had been used during the trip to a nearby shopping
plaza.
   No charges had been filed against Allison, 57, who runs a
state-licensed day care business from her home. Mulhall said he
expected charges to be filed once the police investigation was
completed.
   Mulhall said Allison was ``very emotional and in a state of
shock'' on Monday.
   Allison didn't return a telephone call to her home Monday.
   Donna Jolly, a spokeswoman for the Department of Human
Resources, said the state temporarily suspended the license of the
day care service pending the investigation. No decision had been
made on whether to permanently close the business.
   The girl's mother, Melanise Hughes, and father, David Skinner,
weren't listed in local telephone directories and couldn't be
reached for comment.

<HEAD>Medicaid, Prison Spending Continue to Grow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RON JENKINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spending on prisons and Medicaid are the
fastest growing items in state budgets across the country, while
increases for education and welfare are lagging, a study shows.
   Education still gets the lion's share of state funds, but the
percentage increase in 1989 was far below that of corrections and
Medicaid, according to a survey by the fiscal staff of the National
Conference of State Legislatures.
   The survey also found that 30 states increased taxes this year,
and that states built their reserves to the highest level in nine
years.
   The survey was released Monday at the conference's summer
meeting in Tulsa, which is being attended by more than 5,000
people, mainly legislators and state officials and staff.
   Spending on prisons rose by 14.1 percent among the states as a
whole, while the increase in Medicaid costs was 10.4 percent.
   Education, considered the No. 1 issue in most states, got little
more than the average increase in overall spending.
   Elementary-secondary education spending rose by 7.8 percent,
while funding for colleges and universities jumped 7.3 percent.
   The overall increase in spending was 7.2 percent _ up from 6.6
percent a year ago.
   Spending on Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the basic
welfare program, rose just 4.4 percent.
   Education makes up more than 50 percent of state budgets across
the country.
   West Virginia, which had to pump money into teacher retirement
and health insurance, led the states with a 25.7 percent increase
in education funding.
   Next were Illinois with a 17.7 percent increase followed by
Nevada and New Hampshire with 16.8 percent, Ohio with 15.2 percent
and Georgia with 14.7 percent.
   The report showed states have an estimated $10.9 billion in
reserves _ or 4.4 percent of general funds. That's the highest
level since 1980, when reserves totaled $11.8 billion.
   Steven Gold, director of fiscal affairs for the conference, said
most states are ``comfortable'' from a financial standpoint. But he
added that ``the margin that is protecting them from being
uncomfortable is not so large.''
   The organization's president, Louisiana Senate President Pro
Tempore Samuel Nunez Jr., said experience has shown that states'
financial conditions can change rapidly and often are tied to the
national economy.
   ``The greatest concentration of fiscal problems this year was in
the New England states and in New York and New Jersey, places that
just two years ago were faring better than most states.''
   Lee Daniels, the group's president-elect and minority leader of
the Illinois House, noted that the recession of the early 1980s put
many states in financial difficulties.
   ``The current fiscal health is certainly not a cause for
complacency,'' he said.
   Nunez said 1989 was ``an active year for state tax policy,''
with tax increases totaling $3.5 billion in 30 states.
   Spending on prisons has jumped at a time when crime rates are
dropping in many areas. Gold attributed the increase to
court-ordered prison improvements and tougher sentencing guidelines.
   Nunez said the economic future of states is clouded by large
trade and federal budget deficits and uncertainty about federal aid
and federal mandates on various programs.
   He said federal initiatives in welfare reform, catastrophic
health care and nursing home legislation will raise state costs by
more than $2 billion a year.

   Family and friends of U.S. Rep. Mickey Leland
awaited word today on the fate of the congressman, who was on a
plane that failed to arrive as expected at a refugee camp near the
Ethiopian-Sudanese border.
   ``I think that he's going to be all right. Really, I do,''
Leland's mother, Alice Rains said Monday night. ``And I know I have
to have courage, because I want to give courage to the children.''
   The plane carried nine Americans and five Ethiopians. The
Americans included members of Leland's staff and U.S. Embassy
personnel.
   Alma Newsom, a spokeswoman in Leland's Washington office, said
Monday it was ``too early to raise alarms'' despite information
from the State Department that the plane was reported overdue on a
flight from the Ethiopian capitol of Addis Ababa to the refugee
camp, Fugnido, about 300 miles to the southwest.
   State Department spokesman Adam Shub said, however, ``We are
concerned about the welfare of Mr. Leland and his group.''
   Ms. Newsom said she is not overly concerned because
communications are poor and the travelers would not be able to
notify anyone of a change in plans.
   ``My guess is once en route, the camp that was the original
destination was too far and they opted to go to a different camp,''
Ms. Newsom said.
   She said the plane was late in departing Monday from Addis Ababa
because of bad weather.
   Ms. Newsom said pilots were strict about adhering to a 5 p.m.
curfew to return to Addis Ababa.
   ``If they feel they can't get back by that time, then you stay
where you are overnight,'' she said.
   The 44-year-old Leland is chairman of the House Select Committee
on Hunger. He has taken a strong interest in Africa's refugees and
visited the same area in March, officials said.
   The six-term congressman is married and has a son.
   Leland, who also serves on the House Committee on Energy and
Commerce and the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service and was
twice chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, often has served
as a mediator in matters of international or interracial
consequence.
   For 10 years, he has overseen a program in which black youths
from his urban district were sent to Israel for six-week stays.
   He joined two other congressmen last October in a trip to Cuba
in efforts to negotiate the release of five political prisoners and
their families.
   When members of the Veterans' Peace Convoy to Nicaragua were
stopped at their approach to the International Bridge in Laredo in
June 1988, Leland negotiated with U.S. Treasury officials in an
effort to allow the group's passage across the border.

<HEAD>Government Says New Indictment Against Milken By October</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Similar version on financial wires</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A grand jury investigation into former Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. bond financier Michael Milken is expected to
deliver a new indictment by October, the government said.
   Milken already has been charged with 98 counts of racketeering
and fraud but a long-awaited superseding indictment in the landmark
Wall Street corruption case could contain new charges.
   At a hearing Monday in federal court, Assistant U.S. Attorney
John K. Carroll said the government has ``an ongoing investigation
of many transactions.''
   Carroll told U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood the government was
targeting Oct. 1 to file an indictment against Milken, his brother,
Lowell, and former Drexel trader Bruce Lee Newberg.
   The government disclosed its intent to file a new indictment,
superceding one handed up March 29, after Milken lawyer Arthur
Liman accused prosecutors of issuing an ``indictment in
installments'' that had hamstrung defense work.
   ``We cannot really prepare this case when we only have part of
an indictment,'' Liman said before requesting a timetable for ``the
indictment we will go to trial on.''
   The standing indictment charges the three defendants with
racketeering, mail, wire and securities fraud. In the broadest use
yet of federal racketeering laws, they face lengthy jail terms and
billions of dollars in fines and forfeitures if convicted. A jury
trial tentatively is set for March 1, 1990.
   An indictment replacing the original one has been anticipated
for about two months by defense lawyers who are anxious to see what
if any new charges the government brings against Milken. Pressing
for and getting the target date should allow defense lawyers to
focus their preparations.
   Wood on Monday also ordered the government to be more specific
about charges and statements made in the original 110-page
indictment. The move came after defense lawyers charged the
government with refusing to answer more than 130 requests for more
information.
   Wood ordered the government to identify unindicted
co-conspirators named in the charges; identify unnamed people who
allegedly participated in some of the cited transactions; and
identify by category alleged victims and kinds of property
allegedly defrauded.
   Prosecutors said they would produce within one month the bulk of
the thousands of documents about transactions in the case that
defense lawyers have demanded. Martin Flumenbaum, another Milken
lawyer, accused the government of delaying release of critical
documents.
   The Milkens and Newberg have pleaded innocent. Newberg was one
of six defendants recently convicted in the Princeton-Newport
securities fraud trial and many of the transactions in that case
are included in the Milken indictment.
   Milken, 42, has set aside about $700 million in assets as part
of a bond package and is free pending trial. Milken, widely
credited with reshaping American finance through the use of
high-yield, high-risk bonds, resigned from Drexel earlier this year
to form an investment consulting firm.

<HEAD>Tokyo Stocks Up, Dollar Off Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index rebounded
today after four days of decline, while the U.S. dollar edged down
against the Japanese yen after a three-day climb.
   The dollar closed at 139.25 yen, down 0.53 yen from Monday's
139.78-yen finish. It opened at 139.55 yen and moved between 138.95
yen and 139.65 yen.
   The dollar had gained 3.58 yen in three trading days before
today's decline.
   Currency trading today was marked mainly by participants'
position adjustments, said Shinzo Yamamoto, a trader with Daiwa
Bank in Tokyo.
   News last Friday of a lower-than-expected U.S. jobless rate in
July had contributed to the dollar's rise.
   But Yamamoto said most market players were wary about buying too
many dollars because ``the jobless rate, which is only one of many
indicators, is not enough to determine the U.S. economy has started
to grow again.''
   A trader with the Bank of Tokyo said the dollar edged down
against the yen as the U.S. currrency was sold in dealings between
the dollar and the West German mark.
   Most of today's dealings were among banks, with individual
investors remaining on the sidelines, said the trader, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
climbed 129.10 points, or 0.37 percent, and closed at 34,759.48.
The index had lost 111.61 points the previous day.
   Genjiro Sasaki, a dealer with New Japan Securities Co., said
that after losing nearly 270 points since last Thursday, the Nikkei
rebounded because of speculative investors' buying spot issues and
selling futures issues to make profits from price gaps between the
two markets.
   ``The new prime minister was finally chosen, and it reassured
the market that there is less political uncertainty,'' he added.
   Today, the governing Liberal Democratic Party chose Toshiki
Kaifu, a former education minister, as the party's new president.
He thus will become prime minister, succeeding Sousuke Uno, who
resigned to take responsibility for the party's losses in the July
23 parliamentary election.
   ``Many participants were still reluctant to buy because they
don't want to lose money in case the index plunges due to a
possible major political change,'' Sasaki said.
   He noted first section volume was still small, estimated at 450
million shares, up from the previous day's 300 million.
   Traders reported many buy orders for Nintendo stock, which
closed at a limit high of 16,400 yen ($118) after the company
announced a gratis share offering today.
   The interest in Nintendo also triggered buying of Fanac and Sony
issues, Sasaki added.

   ``Parenthood'' weaned viewers from gimmicky
blockbusters and the fifth movie this summer topped the $100
million revenue mark, setting a record.
   Universal's paen to parenting, featuring Steve Martin under Ron
Howard's direction, brought in $10.5 million over the weekend,
Exhibitor Relations Co. reported Monday.
   The Tom Hanks-and-pooch love story ``Turner and Hooch'' was
second with $8.5 million dollars, followed by ``Lethal Weapon 2''
at $8 million.
   The romance didn't fade for ``When Harry Met Sally...,'' fourth
at $7.3 million. ``Batman'' was next with $6.7 million and
Sylvester Stallone brought in $6 million with the debut of ``Lock
Up'' at No. 6.
   Disney's ``Turner and Hooch'' was one of the studio's three Top
10 films, along with ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' at No. 7 with $4
million and ``Dead Poets Society'' at No. 10 with $2.1 million.
   Warner, like Disney, had three of the top 10 films with the No.
8-debuting ``Young Einstein'' at $3 million joining ``Lethal'' and
``Batman.'' Also in the Top 10 was Paramount's ``Friday the 13th
Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan'' in ninth place at $2.5 million.
   The blockbusters made room for `sex, lies &amp; videotape,'' the
Golden Palm winner at the Cannes Film Festival. In limited release,
`sex' took in $60,000 at New York's Cinema Studio to break the
house record of $41,000, and collected $90,600 at three Los Angeles
sites, with all evening shows sold out.
   ``Honey'' joined four other films surpassing the $100 million
mark this summer. The season's most popular film, Warner Bros.'
``Batman,'' has brought in $214.3 million.
   The others are ``Lethal Weapon 2,'' which has collected $102.1
million; Paramount's ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' with
$180.5 million and Columbia's ``Ghostbusters II'' with $104.5
million. The latter two films have dropped out of the Top 10.
   The previous record-holder was 1984, when four films broke the
$100 million mark. They were ``Indiana Jones and the Temple of
Doom''; ``Ghostbusters''; ``Beverly Hills Cop'' and ``Gremlins.''
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in
release.
   1. ``Parenthood,'' Universal, $10.5 million, 1,262 screens,
$8,325 per screen, $14 million, one week.

   A fire closed a section of one of the
nation's busiest highway interchanges and officials tried to
persuade motorists to take mass transit instead of their vehicles
to work.
   ``The rest of the week is going to be a disaster,'' said Debbie
Lawler, spokeswoman for the Department of Transportation. ``It's
going to take a while for people to find the best alternative route
for them, and it's going to take a while for them to be convinced
to take mass transit.''
   The fire that closed Interstate 78 started at about 1:30 a.m.
Monday at a garbage dump owned by Hub Recycling Co. underneath the
12-lane, elevated roadway, buckling steel beams. Late Monday, the
fire was contained but continued to smolder.
   A 1\-mile portion of the 62.2-mile roadway, which handles about
100,000 vehicles a day, will probably be closed for months,
authorities said.
   Alternate routes linking the busy New York metropolitan area
with New Jersey suburbs and parts of Pennsylvania are limited. New
Jersey Gov. Thomas H. Kean said a special panel has been convened
to study other routes.
   Kean said the state was preparing to go to court to press for a
cleanup of the site. A Superior Court clerk said a hearing could be
held today.
   The state has been trying for two years to get the court to
force Hub Recycling to remove rubbish stored under the interstate.
An Essex judge last May ordered the removal of the garbage but
stayed the decision on appeal from the company.
   Two of Hub Recycling's owners, Michael Harvan and Richard Bassi,
were convicted recently of illegal waste handling in North Bergen,
the state said.
   Harvan, of Clifton, and Bassi, of Morristown, were partners in
Big M Trucking Co. of Clifton, which authorities said took part in
a conspiracy to dump thousands of tons of construction debris at
several North Bergen sites.
   Attempts to reach the two men were unsuccessful Monday. Their
home telephone numbers could not be obtained.
   Their lawyer, Richard Roberts of Orange, did not respond to
messages left with his office.
   No injuries were reported in the blaze, which occurred about two
miles from downtown Newark.Officials were uncertain how the fire
started.
   Some businesses in the area evacuated workers when smoke poured
through cracks of up to eight inches in the highway. Environmental
officials tested for toxic materials in the plume.
   Peter Baish, area director of the U.S. Customs Service office in
Newark, said he evacuated his workers about midday after smoke
filled several floors housing his agency.
   He said some workers were coughing and complained of eye
irritations.
   The Associated Press also closed its Newark office, and moved
operations to its Trenton bureau as a precaution, said New Jersey
Chief of Bureau Jerry Gray.

<TEXT>
   The ``dialogue of the deaf'' that has at
times afflicted Mexico and the United States appears to be giving
way to a new era of understanding on issues from drug trafficking
to debt.
   ``The relationship between the United States and Mexico has
changed a lot in the last year,'' Attorney General Enrique Alvarez
del Castillo said Monday. ``It is a new relationship of
coordination, of collaboration.''
   Castillo, who pledged to eradicate drug production in Mexico,
spoke at the end of a day of talks that featured an unusually
high-level U.S. delegation headed by Secretary of State James A.
Baker III and four other Cabinet members.
   The talks produced no major accords but served to lay the
groundwork for a Salinas visit to Washington at the beginning of
October and the new mood of cooperation.
   ``The United States has no more important relationship than with
its neighbor and friend, the Republic of Mexico. These are not mere
words _ they represent the solemn commitment of the United
States,'' Baker said.
   Baker praised the new Mexican administration's vigor in the war
on drugs, saying it had made clear ``it wants to tear the roots of
the opium poppy and marijuana plant from its soil.''
   ``Mexico's success over the past six months in capturing and
prosecuting drug traffickers has seized the world's attention,''
Baker said.
   Mexico has been a principal source of heroin and marijuana and a
transit point for U.S.-bound cocaine. U.S. officials have said
corruption in the Mexican government prevented aggressive pursuit
of traffickers.
   A former Mexican police officer was convicted in the United
States last year in the 1985 torture-slaying of U.S. drug agent
Enrique Camarena. Another Mexican policeman was indicted in the
case last month.
   Mexican officials have long insisted that cutting U.S. demand is
the key to the problem.
   The Bush administration ``knows all too well that 60 percent of
the world's illegal drug supply is consumed in the United States,''
Baker said. ``This senseless demand must be cut through the efforts
of all Americans.''
   The U.S. recognition that it must cut the demand for drugs is
vital to the new spirit of cooperation, Foreign Minister Fernando
Solana said.
   Officials on both sides noted the positive new tone after years
of misunderstanding, disagreement and mutual recrimination that a
high-ranking Salinas administration official described as at times
having been a ``dialogue of the deaf.''
   Baker and Treasury Secretary Nicolas Brady praised the economic
policies of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, whose
administration has been in office eight months.
   Brady hailed the debt reduction agreement Mexico reached with
commercial banks two weeks ago and the steps it has taken to
encourage foreign investment and lower trade barriers. Payments on
the country's $107 billion foreign debt have contributed to a sharp
decline in living standards the past seven years.
   Baker said Mexico has become an economic model for other debtor
nations because of Salinas' ``bold far-sighted policies.''
   After two decades of 6 percent growth, the economy completely
stagnated under Salinas' predecessor, President Miguel de la
Madrid, in part due to an austerity program put into effect to keep
up with debt payments.
   But despite efforts to encourage non-petroleum exports, reduce
government deficit spending and cut inflation, the economy has
remained in the doldrums. Combined unemployment and underemployment
is estimated at 40 percent.
   Other U.S. officials joining Baker and Brady for the talks under
the auspices of the U.S.-Mexico Binational Commission included
Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, Commerce Secretary Robert
Mosbacher, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills and FBI director
William Session.
   Also on the agenda were issues relating to the U.S.-Mexican
border, the environment, fisheries, trade and investment and
cultural ties.

<HEAD>cuban Newspaper Says U.S. Refuses to Cooperate in Anti-Drug Effort</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuba's Communist Party newspaper says the
U.S. government is refusing to work with the Havana government in
fighting drug trafficking.
   The newspaper, Granma, said in an editorial Monday that the
United States wants Fidel Castro's communist government to change
before there is talk of cooperation.
   ``Washington cannot pretend that Cuba stop being what it is as a
condition for any progress in their relations, even to agree on
mechanisms for cooperation in the anti-drug struggle,'' Granma said.
   The editorial, headlined ``Cuba must be treated as it is: a
socialist and sovereign country,'' was carried in full by the Cuban
government news agency Prensa Latina and monitored in Mexico City.
   As long as there isn't a U.S. government ``with common sense and
political courage to understand that it cannot aspire to change us,
there will not be bilateral progress,'' the editorial said.
   During the trials in recent weeks of 14 military officers
accused of shipping Colombian cocaine and other drugs through Cuba
to the United States, Cuban officials and Granma articles accused
the U.S. government of failing to share intelligence it had on drug
trafficking.
   ``What is certain is that by denying that cooperation on
information, six tons of cocaine entered U.S. territory, the
equivalent of 4 million doses, although this represents less than 1
percent of annual consumption in the United States,'' the editorial
said.
   But it said Cuba set an example in its prosecution of the
officers, four of whom were executed by firing squad in July.
   ``The reality is that no country in this hemisphere has fought
as energetically against drugs as ours,'' it said. ``For many years
Cuba has fought by itself against the traffickers marauding its
coasts.''
   The editorial compared Cuba's punishment of the 14 officers with
the ``scandalously benign sentence imposed on Oliver North.''
   North, a National Security Council aide during the Reagan
administration, was fined $150,000 and sentenced to two years'
probation and 1,200 hours of community service for his role in the
the Iran-Contra affair. He was convicted of accepting an illegal
gift, abetting in the obstruction of Congress and shredding
official documents.
   ``We have lived 30 years without relations with the United
States,'' the editorial said. If there's anyone who isn't desperate
to normalize relations, it's Cuba.''
   Castro came to power after the rightist government of Fulgencio
Batista was overthrown in 1959.

   Five military astronauts boarded the
space shuttle Columbia today and prepared to fly on a secret
mission to deploy a high-tech satellite to spy on the Soviet Union.
   The weather was perfect and there were no technical problems as
a blacked-out countdown advanced toward a liftoff expected about 8
a.m.
   Because most details about the flight are classified, the
Pentagon would allow NASA to announce only that liftoff would occur
between 7:30 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. The countdown was to be made
public just nine minutes before the planned liftoff.
   A van carrying the astronauts, accompanied by security cars and
a hovering helicopter, arrived at the launch pad shortly after 5
a.m.
   The flight will be the first for Columbia in 3{ years. During
the hiatus, the craft has received 258 safety modifications
dictated by the 1986 Challenger explosion.
   The ship's return to space will give the space agency a fleet of
three orbiters to handle an increasing flight schedule. Three more
flights are planned this year and nine in 1990.
   The commander is Air Force Col. Brewster Shaw, a veteran of two
earlier missions. The others are Navy Cmdr. Richard Richards, Army
Lt. Col. James Adamson, Air Force Maj. Mark Brown and Navy Cmdr.
David Leestma, who flew once previously on a shuttle.
   Although mission details are classified, sources close to the
program said the astronauts will deploy a sophisticated 10-ton
reconnaissance satellite to gather intelligence information over a
wide area of the globe, including much of the Soviet Union, China
and the Middle East.
   The satellite is designed to take highly detailed photographs of
troop movements, military installations and other targets of
interest.
   The sources said that in the shuttle's cargo bay was a package
of scientific instruments for military research, possibly for the
``Star Wars'' missile defense project.
   What the astronauts do will not be reported by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration or the Pentagon.
   A blackout was to be imposed throughout the flight, and only
three brief announcements were planned to report on the health of
the shuttle and to reveal when it will land at Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif.
   The mission is expected to last five days.
   The flight is the eighth for Columbia, the oldest of the
shuttles, but its first since it flew the last mission before the
Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger explosion.
   After the accident, NASA concentrated on modifying the newer
orbiters, Discovery and Atlantis, and Columbia spent much of the
past few years as a ``hangar queen,'' stripped to provide spare
parts for its sister ships.
   Discovery and Atlantis each have made two trips into space since
post-Challenger flights resumed last September.
   During the flight, the astronauts were to check out 258
modifications made to Columbia to improve safety and reliability as
a result of the accident.
   The flight is the 30th for the shuttle program and the fourth
dedicated solely to a Defense Department mission.
   The Defense Department had planned at least 13 more military
launches from the shuttle through the 1990s, but, in the wake of
the Challenger accident cut that number to seven, shifting several
payloads to unmanned rockets to get away from reliance on a single
launch vehicle.
   The Pentagon contends the secrecy of the shuttle military
flights is necessary to make it more difficult for Soviet
satellites and spy ships off the Florida coast to monitor the
flight and know its purpose.
   Critics argue that the secrecy is unnecessary because the
Soviets, with their intelligence capabilities, undoubtedly already
know a great deal about Columbia's mission, and that once the
satellite is in orbit, the Russians will be able to track them
precisely and know what they are doing.

   A man who fled Vietnam hours before the fall
of Saigon gave his wife a dozen red roses as he was reunited with
his family after 14 years.
   Anthony Tran was the chief engineer aboard an army tugboat that
pulled out of the Gulf of Tonkin on April 29, 1975, about 12 hours
before South Vietnam's government surrendered.
   His wife, Dao, and five of their seven children rejoined him
Monday night at New Orleans International Airport, where they
arrived from Vietnam via San Francisco.
   ``I'm still very nervous and excited,'' Tran said.
   He translated his wife as saying, ``She can't speak, she is too
nervous.''
   Tran took a two-week vacation from his job as a refrigeration
technician to have time to spend with his family. He said he would
concentrate on teaching them about living in the United States.
   ``I have to teach them about freedom and the difference between
communism and freedom. Right now, I don't understand them and they
don't understand me,'' Tran said.
   Language may be a problem, he said.
   ``The first thing I have to know is how good they speak English.
In this country, they can't work without speaking English,'' Tran
said.
   He said he will not be able to support all his children _ his
oldest son is 32 _ on his salary.
   Tran has held numerous jobs since coming to this country. He
currently is working for a maintenance contractor at New Orleans
International Airport.
   Tran said before he left Vietnam, he had a friend spread the
word that he was dead, fearing the North Vietnamese would harm his
wife and children if they learned he had fled.
   Three years later, he got word to his family that he was alive
and he began sending money to his wife _ between $3,000 and $6,000
each year, he estimated _ so she could buy her family's way out of
the country.
   Two of Tran's daughters weren't part of the reunion plans. Their
oldest daughter drowned in 1980 with 37 other refugees when their
boat sank at sea.
   Their second oldest daughter, he said, is remaining in Vietnam
until the family can get enough money for her husband and their two
children to emigrate.

   The U.S. dollar eased in calm European trading
this morning and currency dealers said they expected it to settle
into a narrow trading range and wait for clues about the direction
of U.S. interest rates.
   Gold prices rose.
   Traders in Milan, Italy, said the dollar is coming back down
``to reality'' after rising on Friday's better-than-expected U.S.
employment figures.
   They said the dollar's rise had been magnified by the thin
August holiday market.
   ``The dollar wouldn't have reacted as much in a normal market,''
one trader said. ``It's a very sensitive market that tends to
accentuate even the slightest impulses.''
   Added a trader at a commercial bank in Frankfurt: ``What goes up
must come down. Nobody knows what they should think. People are
changing opinions faster than they're changing clothes.''
   Others predicted dollar activity might pick up later this week
with the release of the July U.S. producer price index and retail
sales figures.
   ``By now we've seen this market is almost exclusively interest
rate oriented,'' one trader said. ``It is hungry for news that can
confirm what the employment data suggested.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.53 yen to a closing 139.25 yen. Later, in
London, it was also quoted at 139.25 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _1.9035 West German marks, down from 1.9055
   _1.6375 Swiss francs, down from 1.6380
   _6.4403 French francs, down from 6.4470
   _2.1493 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1502
   _1,369.50 Italian lire, down from 1,373.50
   _1.1722 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1745
   In London, the dollar fell 1 cent against the British pound. It
cost $1.6175 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6075 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at $366.10 a troy ounce, compared with
late Monday's $365.75. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion
dealers fixed a recommended price of $366.20.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $366.10 compared with $365.40 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.18 to close at $367.28.
   Silver was quoted in London at $5.16 a troy ounce, down from
Monday's $5.18.

<HEAD>Canadian Air Brings Chill from Plains to Appalachians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A Canadian air mass chilled much of the nation's midsection this
morning, pushing temperatures to record lows from the southern
Plains to the Appalachians.
   Elsewhere this morning, showers and thunderstorms continued over
south-central Texas, across the central Gulf Coast and over
portions of Florida. Showers also were over eastern North Carolina
and rain was falling over much of New England.
   Thunderstorms dissipated over the Rockies but continued late
Monday evening across Nevada and portions of the Desert Southwest.
Strong winds caused dust storms in Arizona, reducing visibility to
a quarter of a mile in the Salt River Valley, and heavy rain slowed
traffic near Parker.
   A high pressure area extending from southern Canada to central
Kansas sent early morning temperatures plunging into the 40s in
parts of Michigan and the central Appalachians and into the 50s in
parts of the southern Plains and Southeast states.
   By early morning, at least 15 cities had set new record lows for
the date. They included Columbus, Ohio, where a reading of 51
degrees broke by one degree a mark set in 1886; Grand Rapids,
Mich., where the thermometer hit 46 degrees; Huntsville, Ala., with
58 degrees; and Dallas-Fort Worth, with 66 degrees.
   More than three dozen cities set record lows on Monday.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from south-central Texas across the Gulf Coast to Florida, and some
scattered thunderstorms over the Desert Southwest, the Rockies, and
the Plateau region west of the Rockies. A few showers also were
predicted for western New York state and northern New England.
   Highs were expected to be in the 60s over Michigan and western
Pennsylvania; the 90s from southern South Carolina into Florida, in
south-central and southwest Texas, and across much of the
intermountain region; between 100 and 108 degrees in the Desert
Southwest; and in the 70s and 80s elsewhere.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 44 degrees at Lansing,
Mich., to 92 degrees at Blythe and Thermal, Calif.

<HEAD>Immigration Officials Sees No Slowdown In Cuban Refugee Surge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In all of 1985, a single Cuban refugee was picked
up in the sea passage separating the island nation from the Florida
Keys.
   So far this year, 117 refugees have made the perilous journey to
Florida shores and several officials see no signs the latest wave
will abate as economic problems and political turmoil rattle Cuba.
   Thousands of other Cubans arrive each year at Miami
International Airport with forged passports or travel documents
obtained in other Latin countries, such as Panama or Ecuador.
   ``It's been the year of the Cuban refugee in Miami,'' said Perry
Rivkind, Immigration and Naturalization Service director in
Miami.``This is the most we've seen in at least the past five
years.''
   The U.S. Coast Guard in Miami reports that 59 Cubans were found
at sea last year and 44 were picked up in 1987.
   Many of the Cubans make the journey across the Florida Straits
in small boats or makeshift vessels, such as inner tubes or rafts.
Rivkind said some are washed overboard in rough seas or die of
dehydration or hunger.
   Three Cubans who were picked up by a Soviet spy ship about 26
miles southeast of Miami last month said they survived by catching
a sea bird and eating it raw. They said a fourth companion became
delirious during the six-day voyage and plunged overboard.
   ``There is no telling now many die trying to reach Florida,''
said Rivkind, who announced his resignation on Monday after six
years on the job.
   Under federal immigration law, Cuban refugees with close
relatives in the United States are released in their custody
following interviews with INS officials. Cubans with no ties are
placed in INS custody while asylum applications are processed, said
Rivkind.
   Since Cubans cannot be deported to their homeland under U.S.
law, most are granted legal status, said Rivkind.
   In 1980, nearly 125,000 Cubans entered South Florida in the
Mariel boatlift. Many of the newcomers were forced to camp under
highways and in vacant lots because few shelters were available.
   The latest surge of Cuban refugees began only weeks after the
Coast Guard responded to a record influx of Haitians traveling to
South Florida shores in overcrowded boats.
   In March, nearly 1,500 Haitians were stopped at sea, more than
any other month in an eight-year interdiction program which permits
the Coast Guard to return Haitians to their homeland after INS
interviews at sea. So far this year, the Coast Guard has returned
more than 2,600 Haitians.
   Only five of the more than 20,000 Haitians interviewed at sea
since 1981 have been brought into the country for political asylum
hearings, the Coast Guard reports. The others were deemed economic
refugees and returned to Port-au-Prince.

<TEXT>
   The state's high court disbarred a woman
who impersonated her husband and passed the California bar exam in
his name.
   In a 6-1 unsigned ruling Monday, the state Supreme Court said it
held ``sympathetic feelings'' for Laura Beth Lamb, who was pregnant
when she took the test for her husband and said she took it out of
fear he would abuse her.
   Dissenting Justice Marcus Kaufman said the court had overreacted
and imposed a punishment far harsher than the penalties it has
given to several lawyers convicted of dealing drugs and misusing
clients' money.
   Mrs. Lamb was ``on the verge of complete physical, mental and
emotional collapse'' when she took the test, Kaufman said.
   Kaufman said a period of suspension would be enough to protect
the public.
   The ruling allows Mrs. Lamb, now 33 and a legal secretary in Los
Angeles, to reapply for admission to the bar in 1993, five years
after she voluntarily went on inactive status.
   Her attorney, Tom Low, said he would urge her to ask the bar's
Board of Governors for permission to reapply two years earlier.
   Mrs. Lamb passed the California bar in 1983 and became a lawyer
for the Securities and Exchange Commission. Her husband, Morgan
Lamb, failed the exam in February 1985.
   For the July 1985 exam, the bar said, Mrs. Lamb cut her hair,
dressed in men's clothes, had a bar identification photo taken,
signed her husband's name and deliberately smudged her thumbprint.
She took the exam a month later and passed with the ninth highest
score in the state.
   After an anonymous tip to the bar led to an investigation, Mrs.
Lamb pleaded no contest to charges involving deception and
impersonation, and was fined $2,500, ordered to perform 200 hours
of community service and placed on probation.
   At the time, Mrs. Lamb, a diabetic, was in the late stages of a
difficult pregnancy. She said her husband had become violent,
smashing lamps, screaming at her and pushing her, and threatening
to kill her and the fetus.
   Low said Lamb left his wife after the baby was born and they
have since divorced.

   The governing Liberal Democrats today elected
Toshiki Kaifu party president and successor to Prime Minister
Sousuke Uno in the hopes of putting behind it a bribery and sex
scandal and an unpopular sales tax.
   The next prime minister called on fellow Japanese to give his
scandal-plagued party a chance to ``carry out political reforms and
shed our old skin.''
   As expected, Kaifu, 58, was elected to head the Liberal
Democratic Party, defeating late challenges by Yoshiro Hayashi, a
former welfare minister, and Shintaro Ishihara, a novelist and
former transport minister.
   A secret ballot by the conservative party's 404 members of
Parliament and one delegate from each of the party's 47 state
branches resulted in 279 votes for Kaifu, 120 for Hayashi and 48
for Ishihara, easily giving Kaifu the party presidency on the first
ballot. There were four invalid ballots.
   ``This is a crucial time for our party, so it will be a great
responsibility,'' Kaifu, a former education minister with little
personal clout, told a news conference shortly after the vote.
   As Japan's second new prime minister in two months, he will face
the challenge of fending off a surging opposition Socialist Party
and recovering the popularity the Liberal Democrats have lost in a
succession of scandals and a disliked tax policy.
   ``I want to carry out reforms and pass reform legislation based
on our deep self-reflection,'' he said, replying to a question
about his plan to regain public trust.
   He rejected the idea of holding elections immediately, as the
opposition demands.
   ``Through debate we hope to gain the people's understanding of
our policies'' before a general election, he said.
   Kaifu will be elected Wednesday to succeed Uno on the strength
of his party's large majority in the lower house of Parliament. He
also will face the first test of the new political situation in
Japan created by the party's loss of control in the upper house in
the July 23 elections.
   It is likely that the upper house will refuse to confirm him as
prime minister and vote instead for Socialist Party Chairwoman
Takako Doi, but under the constitution the lower house chooses the
head of government, so the main effect will be to embarrass the
Liberal Democrats.
   Uno resigned to take responsibility for the July election loss,
leaving the Liberal Democrats in their worst crisis since the party
was formed in 1955 and began enjoying uninterrupted rule.
   The party's major figures were all ruled out of contention for
the premiership by involvement in the Recruit influence-buying
scandal. In June, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita stepped down
because of links to the Recruit Co. conglomerate, but Takeshita
hand-picked Uno as his successor.
   Backing from Takeshita's faction was a key to Kaifu's successful
bid for party leadership.
   Uno resigned last month amid allegations he kept paid mistresses.
   One of Kaifu's first duties was a round of courtesy calls on
faction leaders whose opinions will count as Kaifu names a Cabinet
and party leadership.
   He said the party's reform plans try to tackle the problem of
the high cost of politics, which results in part from the present
system of multi-seat constituencies where Liberal Democratic
factions finance candidates who run against each other.
   To get away from the problem of huge corporate donations, he
said politicians should seek money from a wide range of individuals
instead.
   Large donations from Recruit angered the Japanese public and
helped send the Liberal Democrats' popularity skidding. Kaifu has
acknowledged that Recruit gave him about $110,000 over five years.
The donations were legal, he said, but he regretted having received
money from a company now accused of attempting to bribe
politicians, bureaucrats and business leaders.
   Recruit, a publishing and information services conglomerate,
sold stock at bargain prices to officials who turned around and
sold the shares at a handsome profit.
   Kaifu indicated he will try to persuade the public to accept a
disliked 3 percent sales tax by earmarking the revenues for social
welfare purposes.
   On foreign affairs, an area where he has little experience,
Kaifu pledged to maintain close security ties with the United
States and said he would deal with problems in relations with
Washington as they emerged.
   ``But at the same time, Japan is also a part of Asia. We should
do whatever we can to cooperate in economic development'' with
Asian nations, he said.
   He also said Japan should work with Moscow to help President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform plans. Japan, because of a longtime
territorial dispute with the Soviets, has had cool relations with
Moscow.

<HEAD>Oregon Mental Patient Has Run Away Before, Posing as Other People</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Oregon mental patient found
outside a church in this eastern Canadian city has wandered off
before, acting as another person, and her father says it is her way
of dealing with mental anguish.
   The woman, who called herself Christina, has been identified as
Rochelle Scholl of Portland, Ore., Ed Hallett, a spokesman for
Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells, said Monday.
   Hallet said the brown-haired woman, about 19, was identified by
Portland psychologist Susan Beattie, who arrived Monday in St.
John's, where Ms. Scholl has been hospitalized for treatment.
   Officials said Ms. Scholl on Monday night insisted she was
Christina.
   Her positive identification came one month after she was found
wrapped in a blanket at a church, clinging to a doll. Doctors in
the Newfoundland capital said the woman indicated she was a
severely handicapped 14-year-old with a life-threatening muscle
disease that left her unable to walk or talk, though she could
communicate through sign language.
   Rochelle has misled authorities on at least two other occasions,
officials said. Although seemingly mute and handicapped, Scholl was
later found to be able-bodied and able to speak.
   Her father, Rodney Scholl, said Monday in a telephone interview
from his home in Selma, Ore., that he is sure his daughter left
Oregon as Rochelle Scholl but in her own mind she isn't Rochelle
now.
   ``She has a mental diagnosis of a hysterical disassociation with
regression and amnesia,'' he said. ``My intentions are to bring her
home.''
   Scholl said he believes his daughter's adopting the persona of
Christina was her way of dealing with mental anguish. He said the
episodes are brought on by stress, but he could not think of any
specific incidents other than the stress of adolescence.
   ``She disassociates from it. She thinks she is who she is,'' he
said.
   Rochelle was living on her own in a low-income housing project
after being discharged from a mental hospital last spring, he said.
   ``She was being seen on an outpatient basis and did a lot of
volunteer work with nursing homes and with handicapped people,'' he
said.
   The father said Ms. Scholl left July 2, telling a neighbor she
was heading for California or Arizona with $1,000 in her pocket.
   Ms. Scholl had been living in Mesa, Ariz., with her mother and
stepfather from the age of five, Scholl said. At 18, she moved to
Oregon to be with her father.
   The discovery of Ms. Scholl on July 7 triggered an intense
investigation that involved Canadian police, social and medical
workers, customs officials, Scotland Yard and Interpol.
   She used sign language to tell doctors she came to Canada on a
yacht with her mother, three men and a nanny. She was thought to
understand English, German and a Yugoslavian dialect.
   News reports from January 1988 said she turned up at an airport
in Des Moines, Iowa, clutching a baby bottle and a handwritten
letter authorities originally believed was written by her mother,
said Len Power of the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary.
   Three months earlier she was found in an airport bathroom in
Springfield, Mo., with a baby bottle and a similar letter that
quoted from the Bible and blamed her apparent disabilities on
falling short of the ``Lord's blessing.''
   Lt. Freeman Twine of the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary said
police are satisfied Christina is Rochelle Scholl but she had not
admitted her identity Monday night. Nor had she started to walk or
talk.
   ``She just doesn't indicate anything,'' Twine said.
   Scholl has been committed to the Waterford mental hospital in
St. John's. A lawyer has been appointed by the provincial Justice
Department to represent her.

   A worker who lighted a match in a basement where
he was investigating a gas leak ignited an explosion that killed 18
people in the Ukraine, the Communist Party daily Pravda reported
today.
   The explosion Monday ripped through a five-story apartment house
in Mogilev-Podolsky, about 660 miles southwest of Moscow, bringing
down part of the building and destroying 20 apartments, the paper
said.
   Gas had accumulated from a leak in the building's basement,
Pravda said. Two maintenance workers were dispatched to
investigate, and one, identified as V. Marushchak, ``lighted a
match, and the explosion followed.''
   Marushchak was killed, but his companion survived, along with
five other tenants, Pravda said.
   More than 600 Soviets, many of them children, were killed in the
Ural Mountains last June when sparks from a passing train ignited
gas that had leaked from a major pipeline.

<TEXT>
   The official media is portraying China's new
Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, as a man of the people who does
not fear getting his hands dirty and is comfortable preaching
homely socialist virtues.
   ``Let's sing a song together,'' he reportedly told workers at a
Shanghai steelworks. ``We'll sing: `We Workers Have Strength,' OK?``
   ``Under Comrade Jiang Zemin's direction, the song rose loud and
clear,'' the party newspaper, the People's Daily, reported today in
a front-page article titled ``General Secretary Among the People of
Shanghai.''
   Jiang returned Sunday from a five-day visit to the city where he
was local party secretary until his June 24 appointment to the
national post. He succeeded Zhao Ziyang.
   Early in his two-year tenure, Zhao also was portrayed as a warm
and personable man who enjoyed visits outside the capital to mingle
with ordinary people. But since his ouster for allegedly supporting
student pro-democracy protesters, the media has printed only harsh
criticism of him and blamed him for virtually every problem China
faces, from an unbalanced budget to corruption to poor worker
morale.
   Jiang, on the other hand, ``repeatedly stressed that we must
rely entirely on the working class,'' Shanghai's Xinmen Evening
News said in a report on the party leader's visit.
   It said that while touring the No. 2 Textile Equipment Factory,
Jiang stopped to ask a young worker his age and what school he had
attended. He then stuck out his hand, causing the youth to blush
and try to wipe off his oil-covered hand.
   ``Never mind,'' Jiang said, grabbing the hand and pumping it.
``From now on we must rely on you'' workers.
   ``These words sank into people's ears,'' the report said. ``For
a while people had become hazy about the leading role of the
workers and the idea of the worker-peasant alliance as an
ideological foundation.''
   At the steelworks, the People's Daily said Jiang noticed that
some workers did not know all the words to the song that begins:
``We workers have strength, we workers have strength. Every day we
are busy at work.''
   ``We should sing this kind of song often,'' he admonished them.
The paper added: ``Watching the scene, some comrades said, `We
haven't seen a scene like this for many years.' ``
   Jiang also called for large and medium-sized businesses to take
the lead in economic development, giving implicit support to the
new post-Zhao emphasis on state ownership rather than
privatization. Those sized companies tend to be state-owned, and
most have large work forces with low productivity but guaranteed
lifetime employment.
   China's most efficient and fast-growing sector is its tiny
private sector, but most of these companies are small.
   The reports said Jiang rode about in a van on his tour, drank
only tea and insisted on eating at home _ all in keeping with the
government's current campaign to save money and encourage simple
living.
   They also said he listened closely to the problems of local
officials and often took notes. His only advice, however, appears
to have been ideological. After listening to reports by officials
in villages around Shanghai regarding export production, collective
enterprises and population control, the People's Daily said Jiang
``jotted down a plan for Shanghai and its suburbs.''
   His plan: ``Grasp well the building of party spirit, develop
education in socialism, patriotism and hard work, and strengthen
education in the national planning mentality.''

<HEAD>Government Demands India Finish Pullout Next Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said today it wants
India to withdraw all its troops by next month but that the New
Delhi government is offering a phased pullout that would finish in
February.
   Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne, briefing Parliament today on
talks he had last week with Indian leaders in New Delhi, said an
end to Indian military operations should be ``immediate and
unqualified.''
   Indian troops began arriving two years ago to enforce a New
Delhi-brokered peace plan aimed at ending an insurgency by minority
Tamils fighting for autonomy in the north and east. About 43,000
are now stationed on the Indian Ocean island.
   ``The Indian position on withdrawal, on the basis of three
shiploads per week of 1,500 to 1,600 personnel, including a three
week preparatory period, will take 28 to 30 weeks and will end in
February 1990,'' Wijeratne, who is also the deputy defense
minister, told Parliament.
   Wijeratne led a six-member delegation to New Delhi on July 29 to
discuss a time frame for the pullout. India has already withdrawn
2,220 troops in phases since July 29, the date initially set by
President Ranasinghe Premadasa for completion of the pullout.
   Sinhalese radicals have stirred up an anti-Indian campaign to
protest the presence of Indian soldiers deployed in the
Tamil-dominated north and east.
   The July 29, 1987, peace accord, which granted limited autonomy
to those areas failed when the dominant Tamil group, the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, rejected it, saying it did not meet their
aspirations for a homeland.
   On Indian troops halting military operations in the north and
east, Wijeratne said the Indians wanted the Tamil Tigers to first
unilaterally suspend military offensives for a 15-day period.
   India has linked the troop withdrawal with the devolution of
powers to the Northeastern Council, formed under the peace accord,
which gave Tamils limited autonomy in exchange for an arms
surrender.
   ``Our position is the implementation of the agreement was not
connected with the Indian troop withdrawal,'' Wijeratne said.
   Wijeratne's statement will be debated in Parliament and
Premadasa is expected to chair a meeting of his Cabinet Friday to
announce Sri Lankan position on the issues. There will be no voting.
   Sinhalese extremists claiming the presence of Indian troops
compromised the country's independence, have launched a vicious
campaign against the government. At least 4,000 people, mainly
government officials and supporters, have been killed in the
two-year Sinhalese uprising. The Tamil insurgency has claimed
11,000 lives.
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people, and
Sinhalese make up 75 percent. Tamils accuse the Sinhalese of
discriminating against them in jobs, education and use of the
Sinhalese language.
   About 60 million Tamils live in southern India.

   Hurricane Dean swept over Sable
Island off Nova Scotia with 89 mph winds before dawn and raced
toward Newfoundland, where weather forecasters said it would weaken
later today when it hits land.
   Seas in the area of the storm were reported running as high as
26 feet today as the storm pushed northeast at speeds of 35 mph
toward the tiny French island of St. Pierre and the cooler waters
of Avalon Peninsula.
   Sable Island, a sandspit 120 miles off Nova Scotia, is home
mostly to seals and wild ponies. A permanent weather station there
remained staffed but no injuries or damages were reported despite
high winds and heavy rains, forecasters said.
   Hurricane forecasters said Dean's path also includes St. John's,
Newfoundland's predominant city, but officials there hadn't issued
any special warnings.
   ``We're telling people to keep listening to their radios,'' one
officer said.
   ``Coastal vessels would probably run for the nearest safe haven
while ocean-going vessels would tend to track around the path of
the hurricane,'' said Jim Cormier, a spokesman for the Search and
Rescue Centre in Halifax.
   John Pearce, spokesman for the Canadian Hurricane Centre in
Halifax, said Dean remained a full-fledged hurricane but was
expected to quickly lose strength after hitting land this afternoon
in Newfoundland.
   At 6 a.m. EDT, the hurricane's center was 90 miles southwest of
St. Pierre, said Miles Lawrence of the National Hurricane Center in
Coral Gables, Fla. The center of the storm was near latitude 46.0
north and longitude 58.0 west, or about 235 miles southwest of Cape
Race, Newfoundland.
   Lawrence said winds peaked at 89 mph over Sable Island, and
remain about 80 mph around the hurricane's center. A hurricane
requires sustained winds over 74 mph.
   Hurricane Dean was spawned in the Caribbean last week. It
churned its way across Bermuda, leaving a trail of sunken boats and
roofless homes. Several people were slightly injured.
   Most hurricanes approaching Canada have been downgraded before
they hit land. The last storm to reach Canada at hurricane force
was Hurricane Blanche in 1975, which clipped Nova Scotia but caused
only minor damage.

<TEXT>
   A former Soviet cosmonaut reveals in a new book
that he was slated to beat the Americans to the moon but that a top
rocket designer's sudden death kept him grounded, the official Tass
news agency reported today.
   The book about Soviet spaceman Valery Bykovsky, titled
``Cosmonaut No. 5,'' contradicts the Kremlin's past denials that it
ever intended to send a man to the moon.
   Bykovsky, in one of several frank reports on Soviet space
failures to come out recently, describes how he began training for
the lunar flight, expected as early as 1968, Tass said.
   But the premature death of Sergei Korolev, the visionary chief
designer of the Soviet space program, ``hampered and retarded the
lunar program,'' the news agency said. ``The United States got
ahead.''
   Tass said design of the spaceship that was to take Bykovsky on a
preliminary orbit around the moon began soon after the Soviet Union
shocked the world by launching Sputnik, the first satellite, in
1957. The new craft was named Zond, which means probe.
   Tass did not specify why the Soviet Union never sent people to
the moon. Soviet officials have said they considered it too risky,
too wasteful, and not as productive as sending robot probes.
   American astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first human to set
foot on the moon in 1969. This past July 20, the 20th anniversary
of the moonwalk, Soviet television finally showed film clips of the
event.
   American space expert James Oberg says in a 1981 book the
Soviets may have been planning a manned flight around the moon for
the 50th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1967.
   Oberg, in ``Red Star in Orbit,'' says Korolev's premature death
``may have been the single most important contributing factor which
prevented this cosmonaut lunar flight from occurring.''
   Korolev died in 1966 from a botched operation, according to
unofficial Soviet sources. The official Pravda obituary said he
died of ``cardiac insufficiency'' after a cancer operation, and
Tass referred today only to his ``sudden death.''
   Recent Soviet revelations on space failures included an article
this summer in the daring weekly Ogonyok on what Western
researchers believe to be the country's deadliest space-related
disaster. A fully-fueled ICBM blew up on the launchpad in 1960,
killing the head of the Soviet rocket forces and literally
incinerating many others nearby.
   Bykovsky, a much-decorated cosmonaut, set a space endurance
record of five days in 1963. He is chief of the Soviet research and
engineering center in Berlin, East Germany, Tass said.
   ``Cosmonaut No. 5'' is not yet available in Moscow, but an
official at its publisher, Politizdat, said the book about Bykovsky
by author Grigory Reznichenko would be out soon.

   Video store owners say they are being unfairly
singled out by legislators who want to curb the rental of violent
films such as ``Ninja Brothers of Blood'' and ``Night of the
Demons.''
   Video retailers attending the eighth annual Video Software
Dealers Association convention, which entered its third day today,
expressed concern that they soon might be prosecuted if they rent
violence-filled features, even those rated PG-13, to children.
   The booming home video market is dominated by mass-appeal
blockbusters like ``E.T. The Extra-Terrestial'' and how-to tapes.
   But the strong presence of low-budget, violence-filled features
in thousands of rental stores has led to a number of bills aimed at
limiting the availability of such cassettes to minors.
   A Missouri bill that becomes law on Aug. 28, in fact, prohibits
the rental to minors of tapes that have either a tendency to appeal
to morbid interests or depict violence in a patently offensive way
as judged by local community standards.
   ``We think it has a lot to do with the Meese Commission,'' said
Pam Horovitz, executive vice president of the video association,
referring to the President Reagan-appointed commission on
pornography and violence.
   ``We really believe that it is the fundamental responsibility of
the parent to decide what their children can and cannot watch.
That's the only place where the decision can be made in the best
interests of the child,'' she said.
   Horovitz said some of the films that could be covered by the
Missouri bill are available to children on television or in
theaters.
   A Paramount Home Video spokesman said the marketplace _ not the
government _should decide what's acceptable.
   ``We are committed to making the highest quality motion pictures
and television shows that audiences want,'' said Deborah Rosen.
``The audience should decide what they want and what they don't
want.''
   ``We believe self-regulation is the best idea,'' said Ron
Castell, senior vice president of Blockbuster Video, the nation's
largest chain with more than 820 stores. ``We are concerned,
however, about box art. As an industry, we have to police ourselves
on that.''
   Program suppliers frequently redesign movie package art to boost
sales. A number of the so-called B titles are driven by lurid
packaging _ the more graphic the cassette cover design, the better
the cassette is expected to sell.
   But video retailers now find themselves under increased pressure
to submit new art to the Motion Picture Association of America. The
MPAA, which hands out movie ratings, demands that illustrations for
MPAA-rated films be approved separately.
   Home video sales are expected to hit $10 billion this year.
   ``This is not a hard business. All you do is rent movies.
Americans love movies,'' Kastell said. ``And they have an
insatiable demand.''
   A record 14,000 video retailers, distributors, producers and
tape manufacturers have come to the convention to check out videos
ranging from ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' to ``Balloonacy,'' a
how-to video complete with 50 balloons and tips to create more than
30 inflated animals.

   A twin-engine sightseeing plane
carrying four Americans and five Canadians crashed into a South
Island mountain today and all aboard are feared dead, police said.
   A New Zealander was piloting the Britten Norman Islander, which
came down this afternoon near Mt. Aspiring, between Milford Sound
and Wanaka, rescue coordinator Bob Randal said.
   ``It's thought that all those on board perished,'' he said.
   The cause of the crash was not immediately known. Police did not
release the names and hometowns of the 10 people on board.
   Wreckage from the Aspiring Air plane was scattered about 4,000
feet up a mountainside, and was spotted by a Queenstown helicopter
pilot shortly after the plane was reported missing, police said.
   Two helicopters with medical personnel went to the crash site
and reported from the air that there appeared to be no survivors.
   Randal said rescuers hope to recover the bodies later in the
day. However, he said there remained the threat of avalanches in
the steep, mountainous area.

   A man shot his obese daughter to put an
end to high medical bills for her treatment but brought her to a
hospital two hours later when she didn't die, police said.
   Anna Kwiatkowski, 34, was in serious condition today at St.
Joseph Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbor, said hospital spokeswoman Susan
Lathers.
   The victim's father, Valentine, 78, and her sister, Carol, 43,
were arraigned on attempted murder charges. Bail was set a $50,000.
   The victim, who weighed 360 pounds and suffered from asthma, was
shot twice in the head, Lt. John Reddy said.
   Police from from Westland, a Detroit suburb, were called to the
hospital Sunday and told that the father and daughter had brought
in the wounded woman.
   ``In talking to the father, he told them that they had shot her,
the reason being mounting medical bills,'' Reddy said. ``She didn't
die, so two hours later they brought her to the hospital.''
   Valentine Kwiatkowski fired the shots at close range with a
.32-caliber handgun as his daughter lay in bed, Sgt. Robert
Barthold said.
   The victim later asked to be taken to the hospital, where the
father and sister talked about what they had done, ``and they said
they would take their lives, too,'' Barthold said.
   A neighbor said the Kwiatkowski house was the scene of frequent
fights.
   ``They would slap each other around and cause a real ruckus,''
said Evelyn Fagan.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein called on
Iranian leaders today to sign a peace treaty to end the eght-year
Persian Gulf war, halted nearly a year ago by a U.N.-brokered
cease-fire.
   In a television message marking the anniversary of the day Iraq
accepted the U.N. cease-fire resolution, Saddam said a treaty would
guarantee ``both countries' legitimate rights.''
   ``The cease-fire agreement should not be taken as a talisman for
peace ... we are after a comprehensive, total and lasting peace
treaty,'' he said.
   Today was an official Iraqi holiday to mark the anniversary. On
Monday night, thousands of people poured into a central Baghdad
park for a fireworks display and traditional singing and dancing in
a government-organized celebration.
   Crowds of teen-agers, some wearing traditional Arab robes, waved
flags and portraits of Saddam labeled ``the maker of peace and
victory.''
   On Aug. 8, 1988, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
announced the cease-fire would take effect Aug. 20, following
Iraq's decision to drop a demand for direct talks before
hostilities were suspended.
   Both sides accepted U.N. Security Council Resolution 598,
calling for immediate withdrawals to pre-war borders, exchange of
prisoners, formal peace talks and a panel to determine
responsibility for the conflict that killed an estimated 1 million
people.
   U.N.-sponsored talks on a peace treaty started Aug. 25 in Geneva
but deadlocked immediately. Three further rounds of discussions
failed to make any progress.
   Saddam noted in his speech that Iran has made no public
declaration of its desire for peace, saying, ``The Iranian leaders
have been far away from peace in their deeds and maybe in their
intentions as well.''
   He said the ``no peace-no war'' situation with Iran created
instability and ``countries in the region, fearing the worst, will
remain on guard against Iran.''
   The talks stalled over Iranian insistence that the next step in
the peace process should be Iraq's withdrawal from about 380 square
miles of Iranian territory it occupies.
   The Iraqis, however, say they do not recognize a 1975 treaty
drawing part of the Iran-Iraq border down the middle of the
Shatt-Al-Arab waterway, their only outlet to the sea.
   Baghdad maintains the border should be redrawn to include all
the waterway as Iraqi, and that Iraq should have the sole right to
dredge it of mines and other war debris.
   He called for an immediate start to a full exchange of nearly
100,000 prisoners of war, saying ``it's a patriotic and
humanitarian responsibility that these prisoners should be
repatriated without delay.''
   Saddam added that Iran should avoid ``cheap bargaining'' on the
POW issue in order to gain leverage at the peace talks.
   Iraq has proposed that the POWs be swapped under an agreement
separate from the U.N. resolution, but Iran says they can only be
freed as part of an overall settlement of the conflict.
   So far, only 2,360 ailing and disabled prisoners have been
repatriated under exchanges arranged by the International Committee
for the Red Cross.
   Saddam said Iraq has demonstrated its wish for peace by
demobilizing about 200,000 soldiers, almost one-quarter of its
army, and freezing its paramilitary forces.
   The Iraqi leader said that government projects for swift
reconstruction of the war-damaged southern city of Basra and the
port of Faw is a further sign that Iraq is seeking lasting peace.
   The war began in September 1980 when Iraq invaded Iran after
border skirmishes.

   Two men convicted of killing a teen-age
girl whose wave they mistook for the signal of a rival gang drew
41-year prison sentences _ even more than state guidelines call for
or the prosecutor sought.
   Superior Court Judge D. Gary Steiner said Monday the terms will
be a message to those who commit gang crimes.
   ``Their crime is unique in its enormity,'' he said.
   Gregory T. Smith, 18, and Darrell J. Massey, 19, were convicted
of murder July 5 in the shooting death of Brenda J. Harris, 17.
   They also were convicted of attempting to murder two other
occupants of the car in which the girl was riding. The other
occupants were not injured.
   State sentencing guidelines call for 26 to 34 years; prosecutors
had asked for 36 years and 10 months for each.
   Ms. Harris, who had no gang ties, was riding with her friends on
March 24 when she waved at someone she thought she recognized,
police said.
   Police said Smith, Massey and two other men associated with the
Crips gang pursued the vehicle and opened fire. Ms. Harris was hit
in the head by a rifle bullet.
   The other men in the car testified against Smith and Massey and
pleaded guilty to lesser charges.

   Shiite Moslem fundamentalist leaders
today again rejected talks on exchanging three Israeli servicemen
and Western hostages for a kidnapped Moslem cleric held in Israel.
   Their statements came amid indications that Syria may be
authorized by Iran and Hezbollah, Tehran's main ally in Lebanon, to
negotiate the release of U.S. hostage Joseph Cicippio and 15 others
held in Lebanon.
   In Iran, the English-language Tehran Times said Tehran would be
willing to use its influence in the hostage crisis if the United
States agreed to release billions of dollars of Iranian assets long
frozen in New York banks.
   They also came as as signs appeared of a rift in Iran's new
leadership over the hostage issue, pitting hard-line Interior
Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi against pragmatist President Hashemi
Rafsanjani.
   In a statement distributed in Beirut, Sheik Sobhi Tofaili, a
senior Hezbollah leader said, ``There shall be no contacts and no
negotiations as long as Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid remains in
captivity.''
   ``This is the party's unshakeable conviction and this is what we
shall do,'' Tofaili said, adding, ``Hezbollah is not concerned with
the question of the hostages or the negotiations revolving around
it.''
   The hostage crisis was triggered when Israeli commandos
kidnapped Obeid, 33, from his home in south Lebanon July 28 and
whisked him to Israel.
   Israel has offered to trade Obeid and all 450 Shiite prisoners
it holds for the three Israelis and the Western hostages held in
Lebanon but Hezbollah insists the cleric should be unconditionally
freed.
   Hezbollah's spiritual guide, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,
said in a separate statement published by several Beirut newspapers
that Obeid's abduction left ``the region poised on a powder keg.''
   ``That act of piracy led to the killing of the American officer
Higgins,'' Fadlallah said, referring to the announcement nine days
ago by the underground Organization of the Oppressed on Earth that
it hanged U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins.
   Fadlallah said Israel's refusal to free Obeid and movements of
U.S. warships in the eastern Mediterranean after Higgins' death
reminded him of tensions that preceded Israel's 1982 invasion of
Lebanon.
   ``I do not rule out the possibility of a large-scale military
operation by Israel to get itself off the hook in this crisis which
it created,'' Fadlallah said.
   But the independent newspaper An-Nahar said today there were
indications Syria and Iran would ``coordinate and intensify efforts
to resolve the hostage issue and defuse the crisis.''
   ``This is expected to take its final shape when Iranian Foreign
Minister Ali Akbar Velayati arrives in Syria soon for talks with
President Hafez Assad's government,'' An-Nahar said in a report
from its Damascus correspondent.
   Syria was Iran's main ally in the 8-year gulf war against Iraq,
which ended in a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire last August.
   An-Nida, the organ of the pro-Moscow Lebanese Communist Party,
quoted unnamed travelers from the Syrian capital as saying the
government ``may have been authorized by Iran and Hezbollah to
negotiate the release of the Western hostages.'' It did not
elaborate.
   Higgins, who commanded the U.N. peacekeeping force, was
kidnapped near Tyre in south Lebanon on Feb. 17, 1988.
   Longest held of the U.S. hostages is Terry A. Anderson, chief AP
Middle East correspondent. He was kidnapped nearly 4{ years ago.
   President Bush on Monday paid tribute to Higgins during a
ceremony at Ft. Myer, Va., to celebrate the 200th anniversary of
the War Department, forerunner of the Department of Defense.
   In an emotion-filled voice, Bush said, ``We cannot leave here
today without pausing to salute one who stands as the symbol of the
courage that burns in the breast of every American in uniform, one
Marine who has been very much in our thoughts, Lt. Col. Higgins,
William Richard Higgins.''
   The videotape released last week in Beirut depicted a bound and
gagged man hanging from a rope around his neck.
   Israeli government officials have said their sources indicated
Higgins had been killed some time ago. Higgins was the target of
past death threats by the terrorists, who called him a spy.
   An-Nahar said Syria was among countries requested by Bush to
intervene after another extremist group threatened to kill Cicippio
in retaliation for Obeid's abduction.
   Cicippio, 58, was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986, from the American
University of Beirut where he worked as acting comptroller.
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization, which claims to be
holding Cicippio, has asked Syria to negotiate its offer through
international organizations.
   Damascus has made no public response and Israel rejected the
offer.
   Syria is Lebanon's main power broker, with 40,000 troops
stationed there under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. They
control Hezbollah's strongholds in Beirut's southern slums and east
Lebanon's Bekaa valley.
   The Tehran Times quoted a source close to Rafsanjani as saying
``the first step should be taken by the U.S. and if Tehran gets
satisfied that its assets will certainly be unfrozen, then the
second step will definitely come from Iran.''
   Washington froze more than $2 billion in Iranian assets after it
broke diplomatic relations with Tehran over the seizure of the U.S.
Embassy there in 1979.
   Rafsanjani offered last week to help Washington resolve the
hostage problem.
   But Mohtashemi appeared to challenge him in a speech Sunday
night at the grave of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. His
speech, broadcast Monday by Tehran radio, said there are ``many
Hezbollah cells around the world created by the holy breath of the
Imam Khomeini that cry death to the superpowers.''

   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack
Kemp pledged today to get ``the Republican influence peddlers'' out
of his troubled department and work for imrpoved opportunities for
poor people to own their own homes.
   Kemp addressed the annual conference of the National Urban
League a day after the civil rights organization issued a report
saying that at the present rate of progress it would take black
Americans 1,163 years to catch up with whites in home ownership.
   Before Kemp spoke, delegates observed a moment of silence to
express concern for Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, a member of the
Congressional Black Caucus missing on an airplane flight in Africa.
   ``It is typical of Mickey that if a plane were missing and
Mickey was on it, it would be on its way to northern Africa to help
the poor and those who have been left out,'' Kemp said.
   Turning to the investigations of questionable practices and
insider profiteering during the Reagan administration in the
department he now heads, Kemp said: ``We're going to take the
greedy and the consultants and the Republican influence peddlers
out of HUD.''
   ``I don't want it to work for the Democratic National Committee;
it shouldn't work for the Republican National Committee; it's got
to work for the people,'' he said.
   ``We want to take publicly assisted housing and publicly owned
housing and, if it's possible and if there's some sweat equity
involved and if people can homestead in this century as we should
have done more of in the last century, we should give people a
chance to own a home,'' Kemp said.
   ``We are going to do our very best to end the disgrace of
redlining (refusal of lenders to provide mortgages in certain
areas) in America, to make sure that seed capital is flowing into
low-income housing and low-income commmunities,'' he said.
   In its report Monday on the economic status of blacks, the Urban
League called for new efforts to ``overhaul the stalled engine of
racial progress.''
   ``The impressive long-term progress of African-Americans has in
more recent years stalled and, in some cases, even reversed,'' it
said.
   Blacks are gaining on whites so slowly in employment and
economic development that there appears little chance they will
catch up before the middle of the next century, said the report by
the league's research department.
   ``There is a commanding need to overhaul the stalled engine of
racial progress,'' it said.
   One of the bleakest parts of the report was on housing, where
the researchers reported that the black home ownership rate
increased only from 64.6 percent of the 1970 rate for whites to
65.1 percent in 1985 _ a gain of half a percentage point in 15
years.
   As a result, the report said, it would take until the year 3152
for blacks to catch up with whites.
   ``The impact of legal discrimination was perhaps most
dramatically manifest in the residential separation of the races,''
the report said. ``Institutional racism, as revealed in the racist
policies and practices of mortgage lenders, housing developers, and
real estate agents, has been equally consequential.
   ``Combined with the aversion whites have exhibited toward living
in areas in which African-Americans exceed or might exceed a
certain number, these factors have generated and sustained telling
levels of residential segregation,'' it said.
   In education and health the prospects are a little better, said
the report.
   But in some economic and health areas, including infant
mortality, the researchers said gains are being made so slowly that
they are unable to estimate when parity might be reached.
   By contrast, the number of blacks completing high school
compared with whites increased so dramatically, from 55 percent in
1967 to 79 percent in 1985, that the league estimated parity should
be reached in 16 years.
   The report said 43.7 percent as many whites as blacks were
unemployed in 1985, compared with 45.9 percent in 1967.
   ``Major initiatives are necessary if this trend is to be
checked,'' the league said.
   The report estimated it would take 54 years for blacks to reach
parity with whites in managerial and professional occupations, 73
years in median earnings for full-time workers and an undetermined
amount of time in family income.
   It estimated it will be 159 years, if present trends continue,
before black poverty rates shrink to equal those of whites.
   One area where blacks lost ground was in earnings of their
businesses, as a share of the earnings of all American companies.
In 1972, this figure was nearly 20 percent. In 1982, it had shrunk
to less than 7 percent.
   The report estimated it will take 55 years for black college
enrollment to reach parity with white enrollment, 40 years for life
expectancy, three years for voter registration and nine years for
voting rates in congressional elections.
   In its bleak report on infant mortality, it said the white rate,
as a percentage of the black rate, has declined from 54.6 percent
in 1970 to just over 51 percent in 1985.

   Fire early today destroyed a rooming house
whose landlord had been cited for failing to install sprinklers,
killing at least three people, injuring 11 and leaving 13
unaccounted for, authorities said.
   Several people escaped the 12:30 a.m. blaze in the four-story
brick tenement by jumping onto lower roofs. Others lowered
themselves on ropes that tenants said had been supplied in rooms in
place of a fire escape.
   It was not immediately clear whether local ordinances required
fire escapes.
   One victim was believed to have been shinnying down a rope when
he fell to the street, authorities said. Police said two more
bodies were spotted in the ruins. Firefighters awaited the arrival
of a crane to clear the debris.
   Early today 22 of the 35 residents believed to live in the house
were accounted for, authorities said.
   ``We've got a grisly task ahead of us,'' said Fire Chief Kurt
Numberg.
   The house had no sprinkler system, authorities said. Mike Barry,
an attorney for the city, said the owner, Leo Allard, was charged
in January with failing to install sprinklers as required under a
1987 city ordinance.
   Last month, Allard was charged with operating a woodworking shop
in the basement, a zoning violation, Barry said.
   Allard was at the scene this morning and refused to answer
reporters' questions.
   The cause of the fire was under investigation.
   ``People were jumping out of windows, hanging on mattresses and
climbing on ropes that knotted up and never reached bottom,''
Numberg said.
   One tenant who escaped said he had to drop about a story to the
street when the rope in his room proved too short to reach from the
window to the ground. Louis Clough, 43, another tenant, said ropes
were a fixture in some rooms.
   Michael Whalen, 40, said he woke up when he smelled smoke, then
broke a window and lowered himself to safety with a rope. He said
there were smoke detectors in the building, but he didn't hear any
go off.
   Lynn, a depressed working-class coastal town of about 79,000, is
15 miles north of Boston.
   Police Capt. Fred McGovern identified one of the dead as
Benjamin Amiro, 50. He was believed to have fallen while shinnying
down a rope.
   McGovern said seven other tenants were injured, along with two
police officers and two firefighters. The police and fire injuries
were not considered serious.

<TEXT>
   Soviets don't have much to laugh about these days,
but American comedian Billy Crystal had them in stitches with
slapstick and stand-up routines poking fun at long lines and
superpower politics.
   ``I was raised thinking you were the enemy. You were raised
thinking I was the enemy,'' Crystal told an invitation-only
audience of 600 people, about half foreigners and half Soviets.
``We were both wrong: It's the French.''
   The 41-year-old native New Yorker, whose grandmother emigrated
from Russia, brought his irreverent humor to the communist
heartland to tape ``On Location: Midnight Train to Moscow'' for
broadcast in October on Home Box Office.
   He spent a few days taping skits for the special around town,
then put on a 50-minute show Monday night at Moscow's Pushkin
Theater.
   With staples such as meat, sugar and toothpaste in short supply,
and ethnic violence, strikes and crime on the rise, Soviets need
some comic relief. A few, at least, got it from Crystal.
   A Soviet woman who spoke English said she had never heard of him
but decided to attend the show ``because we need positive
emotions.'' She roared throughout but admitted afterward the
``dialogue was hard to understand.''
   In an interview on Red Square, Crystal agreed comedy was sorely
needed in the Soviet Union.
   ``Here, there is a desperate need to be more open and have more
fun,'' he said.
   The comedian, known for his imitations of Sammy Davis Jr. and
other celebrities, studied with a language coach and opened his
show with a few minutes in Russian.
   ``I wanted to perform in the U.S. Embassy because it has the
best microphones,'' he said, referring to the new office building
the Americans say they can't occupy because of KGB bugs.
   During the rest of the show, Crystal did his best to help the
Soviets bridge the language gap and was most successful with
slapstick and mime. His impersonation of Jack Nicholson reciting a
Russian tongue-twister was a big hit with Soviets, who are familiar
with Nicholson's soft-spoken manner from movies available on
bootleg videotapes.
   Crystal, wearing a gray shirt and white pants that stood out
against a huge red backdrop of a man and woman holding a hammer and
sickle, also portrayed Charlie Chaplin scrounging for food in
Moscow. When he got some, it tasted terrible.
   About a dozen of his relatives in the Soviet Union attended
Monday's show. One called Crystal's comedy ``a new genre for us,
but very interesting.''
   In an interview, Crystal said he had a tough time preparing for
the special because ``there's no place to break the show in like
Impravda or Catch a Rising Tsar.'' The Improv and Catch a Rising
Star are comedy clubs in the United States.
   Standing outside Lenin's Mausoleum on Red Square, Crystal
compared the resting place of the founder of the Soviet state to
Graceland, the home of the late Elvis Presley that has become a
shrine for fans.
   Crystal, who first visited the Soviet Union in April, was asked
if he had any advice for tourists. ``If you bring laxatives, it's a
great place to be,'' he quipped.
   The funniest thing he saw during his visit, he said, was the
shower curtain in his hotel room. ``It's this big,'' he said,
making a tiny square with his hands.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Goodyear tire company
Tuesday threatened to fire 1,200 striking black workers as strikes
and lockouts crippled South Africa's motor vehicle industry.
   In all, 13,000 members of the National Union of Metalworkers of
South Africa at four automobile plants and two vehicle component
factories are not working due to strikes or lockouts. Industry
officials say the closed plants produce about two-thirds of South
Africa's motor vehicles.
   About 5,000 workers are on strike at Volkswagen's plant in
Uitenhage, about 3,600 workers from the Toyota plant near Durban
have been locked out and fired, and about 3,000 workers are on
strike at two plants of the South African Motor Corp., which
produces Fords and Mazdas.
   On Monday, British-owned Eveready locked out 800 workers at its
Uitenhage plant because of a wage dispute. Goodyear followed suit
on Tuesday, saying the 1,200 workers who have been on strike for
five weeks at its factory in Port Elizabeth would be fired unless
they signed an undertaking by Friday that they would accept
employment conditions proposed by the South African management in
the wake of disinvestment by the U.S. parent company.
   The strikes against the three auto manufacturers, which began
last week, are linked to the union's ongoing efforts to negotiate a
wage agreement on a nationwide basis with all major auto companies.
Toyota has been the most adamant in resisting such negotiations,
and says its dismissed workers will lose all chance to reclaim
their jobs unless they reapply by Monday.
   Auto manufacturers not yet affected by the current wave of labor
disputes include Nissan, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.

   Poor visibility hampered rescuers
searching today for a plane carrying Texas Rep. Mickey Leland and
13 other people that vanished en route to a refugee camp near the
Sudanese border.
   Heavy cloud cover made an aerial search of more than 400 miles
of rugged terrain from this capital to Leland's destination in
southwestern Ethiopia nearly impossible, said Robert Houdek, charge
d'affairs at the U.S. Embassy.
   At a briefing in Washington, Leland's press secretary, Alma
Newsom, said President Bush had telephoned Leland's wife in Houston
to express his concern and assure her the U.S. government had
offered full assistance to Ethiopia.
   She said Secretary of State James A. Baker III also had called
Mrs. Leland.
   ``At this point no news is good news,'' said Ms. Newsom, who
recalled being on similar trips with the congressman in the past
where air travel and communications were disrupted.
   Houdek said Interior Ministry officials in contact with police
and communications points along Leland's flight path reported a
small plane was sighted Monday circling a field at Dembidolo, about
75 miles from the Fugnido refugee camp where the Houston Democrat
group was bound.
   ``If it was our plane, what we find encouraging is that it would
have transversed a lot of the more treacherous terrain to
Fugnido,'' Houdek said. ``The plane circled, but the pilot
obviously felt that he didn't want to put down at that time.''
   Houdek said Dembidolo was in an inaccessible region far from any
communication points, ``which could provide a benign explanation
for why we haven't heard anything.''
   But he said the region contained several fields suitable for
landing that were cleared by the government to airlift food to
people during the 1984-85 famine that ravaged much of Ethiopia.
   Light aircraft that left early today to search for Leland and
his party were concentrating their efforts in the Dembidolo area,
said Houdek. However, a dense cloud cover and poor visibility was
hampering their efforts, he said.
   The missing Twin Otter plane that Leland was traveling in is
commonly used for bush flying. Officials with Ethiopia's Civil
Aviation Authority, coordinating the search, said a C-130 Hercules
cargo plane was standing by to help in case of an emergency.
   U.S. Embassy official John Guerra said the pilots were following
the general route the plane would have taken to the Fugnido camp,
480 miles southwest of Addis Ababa.
   Planes must fly over rough terrain to reach the camp, but the
aircraft would not pass over the area where rebels are battling
Ethiopia's government. Ethiopia's separatist movements are based in
the northern part of the country in the Horn of Africa.
   The missing plane, which also carried eight other Americans
including staff members and U.S. Embassy personnel, was last heard
from Monday morning about 15 minutes after leaving Ethiopia's Bole
Airport in Addis Ababa, Guerra said.
   ``It was about 25 miles outside of Addis at the time,'' said
Guerra. ``That was the last contact we had.''
   Five Ethiopians, including three government officials, the pilot
and co-pilot, also were aboard the airplane owned by Ethiopia's
Relief and Rehabilitation Commission, the government relief agency.
   The plane was due back in Addis Ababa at 5 p.m. Monday.
   Guerra said Leland's departure for Fugnido Monday had been
delayed for two hours because of bad weather in Addis Ababa and it
was possible the plane was diverted to a remote field or landing
strip.
   ``We are not discounting the possibility they put down
someplace,'' said Guerra, a political and economics officer. ``It
is very possible because of the nature of the weather.''
   Communications in Ethiopia, one of the world's poorest
countries, are minimal outside of the capital, and the flight to
the camp is over rough terrain.
   The Fugnido camp is run by the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees and is one of four camps in the region that are home to
more than 300,000 refugees who have fled civil war in neighboring
Sudan.
   Leland is chairman of the House of Representatives Select
Committee on Hunger. He has taken a keen interest in Africa's
refugees, and visited the same area in March, officials said.
   Leland arrived in Ethiopia early Monday and was expected to
spend two to three days in the East African nation. After visiting
Fugnido, he had been scheduled to meet government officials and
visit Gondar, the home of about 10,000 Falasha Jews in northwestern
Ethiopia.

<HEAD>Residents Return in Idaho; California Firefighters Make Progress</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with evacuated residents returning home in
Idaho, Utah and California fires contained, increase acreage of Idaho to
43,000, new warning on lightning danger. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Firefighters in California contained two large blazes and dozens
of Idaho residents returned home today a week after fires forced
them out. But a ``red flag'' went up for the third straight day,
warning of lightning strikes.
   Spotter planes cruised over Western forests in a search for
lightning-sparked fires after thousands of storm bolts struck the
region. Fire bosses said they saw no immediate evidence of a new
round of major blazes.
   ``The next two days should tell,'' said Ron Smith, spokesman for
the Boise Interagency Fire Center, the federal fire command post.
``There have been some strikes, but it takes time until we'll spot
whether they've touched off new fires.''
   Fire center officials today posted a ``red-flag'' warning of dry
thunderstorms and gusting wind.
   About 23,000 firefighters on Monday fought the worst of blazes
on 182,000 acres, primarily in Idaho, Oregon and California,
according to the fire center.
   The fire battles have cost more than $27 million, with the bill
rising sharply each day, the center said. More than 220,000 acres
have been charred in a bout of mostly lightning-caused fires that
began July 26.
   In Idaho, the most heavily burned state, more than 9,000 people
were committed to extinguishing to the blazes, including a
43,000-acre series of fires that destroyed a small resort town 70
miles northeast of Boise.
   Early today, dozens of residents who fled their homes more than
a week ago because of those fires were allowed back ``on the
condition they be prepared to leave immediately again,'' Boise
National Forest spokesman Rick Perkins said.
   ``A big wind could change the picture real fast,'' he said.
   About 25 people in the Long Creek summer home area remained
evacuated because of the fire danger.
   Nearly 5,000 firefighters in southern and central California
contained two blazes that blackened thousands of acres of forest
and wilderness for more than a week.
   Firefighters were mopping up a 7,550-acre fire in the Sierra
foothills east of Fresno and a 15,300-acre blaze in the Cleveland
National Forest east of San Diego, which was ignited by a target
shooter's bullet nine days ago. It torched a house and trailer and
neared the historic Mount Palomar Observatory earlier in the week.
   Lightning struck about 700 times Monday in six Western states.
   Most of the new fires were small. The largest had burned five to
seven acres in the Ochoco National Forest in central Oregon.
   Hundreds of federal troops moved through the Boise fire center
for training and eventual deployment. But land managers continued
pressing for more manpower.
   Before the lightning, firefighters in Oregon and Idaho had
consolidated gains made during cool weather last week and predicted
that many of the 100 fires that had burned nearly 89,000 acres
would be contained by midweek.
   Airplanes sent over national forests Monday in Washington to
look for smoke found dozens of lightning-caused fires, most of
which were quickly contained.
   Near Coalville, Utah, about 45 miles east of Salt Lake City,
firefighters finished digging a circle around a 1,700-acre blaze,
and authorities hoped to bring it under control tonight.
   In northwestern Nebraska, a fir that blackened 3,000 acres of
brush and timber in canyon country near Belmont was largely
contained.

   Immigration officials say they are just
following guidelines in trying to deport the children of two
Mexican nationals who have worked in the United States for years
and may receive amnesty.
   The children, aged 10 and 11, have no place to go if they are
sent back to Mexico because their grandmother, with whom they used
to stay, has moved across the border to Yuma, relatives say.
   Ruth Anne Myers, district director the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said one parent can also return to Mexico
if deportation is ordered.
   The family says it won't split up, even if it means both parents
have to return to Mexico and forfeit their chance at legalization.
   Enrique Garcia-Guiverra and Francesca Guadarrama-Fuentes hold
INS-approved jobs in Tucson and are waiting for decision on whether
they worked in the fields for long enough to qualify for the
amnesty program that was signed into law in November 1986.
   Their children, Israel and Francisco Javier Garcia-Guadarrrama,
lived with their grandmother in San Luis Rio Colorado at first but
joined them in the United States in June 1987.
   In January, when the family was stopped near Yuma, problems
arose.
   Border Patrol officers tried to deport the children on the spot,
but agreed to permit a hearing after the parents protested,
according to lawyers.
   The parents then turned to Southern Arizona Legal Aid, and legal
aid lawyers asked INS to grant the children an exemption under a
Family Fairness program designed to keep families together.
   But INS officials said the children did not qualify because they
weren't in the United States before November 1986. Instead, they
asked a hearing officer for immediate deportation.
   The November 1986 cutoff is arbitrary, legal aid attorney Nadine
Wettstein said. ``They have to draw a line someplace and it just
happens that it's on top of these kids heads,'' she says.
   ``These were guidelines that came from Washington,'' Ms. Myers
said. ``It was a national policy that was accepted or adopted by
the commissioner of naturalization and immigration.''
   The parents entered the country illegally in the first place,
and even if they can now benefit from amnesty, there's no reason to
extend that benefit to the children, Ms. Myers added.
   ``We've always worked hard,'' Garcia-Guiverra said Monday, with
Ms. Wettstein as translator from Spanish. ``We're not a problem for
the government.''
   Although INS is pressing for a decision from the hearing
officer, Ms. Myers said Monday it might be willing to hold off on
deportation even if the hearing officer authorizes it.
   ``That type of discretionary authority is there,'' she says.
   The statement comes as a surprise to Ms. Wettstein, who says INS
has already refused several proposals to put the issue on hold.

   The 22-year-old adopted son of country
music singer Freddy Fender died Tuesday of injuries suffered in a
traffic accident, authorities said.
   William L. Nance of Kimberling City died at St. John's Regional
Medical Center a few hours after the accident Monday night,
officials said.
   Three other people were seriously injured, including another of
Fender's sons, Danny Huerta, 23, officials said.
   The Highway Patrol said the car driven by Nance collided with a
vehicle driven by Shirley Diimig, 58, of Reeds Spring. The accident
occurred a quarter-mile west of Kimberling City.
   Ms. Diimig and Nance's brother-in-law, who was visiting from out
of town, were hospitalized at St. John's, officials said. The
relative's name was not known.
   Fender operates a country music theater in Branson. He had just
returned from Texas after the funeral of his mother, Margaret
Huerta, who died of a heart attack Aug. 1, said Sandra Lemons,
assistant general manager of Freddy Fender's Theater.

<DATELINE>MORRISON, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A storm during a packed prayer service at
a 10,000-seat amphitheater pelted participants with hail and cold
rain and sent people scrambling for cover. At least 130 people were
taken to hospitals.
   Two of the injured were taken to a coronary intensive care unit,
while the rest were treated and released Monday night, said Pat
Conroy, medical coordinator for the five-day Lutheran national
youth conference.
   Most were treated for dizziness and hypothermia, or low body
temperature, from getting soaked by the rain, which dropped the
temperature 20 degrees to about 45.
   About 9,000 teen-agers from across the United States were
participating in the service, dubbed Fire Power, when the storm
broke, said Gary Lane, Denver director of parks and arenas. The
arena is in a park belonging to the city of Denver but is outside
the city limits.
   ``When you have youths dressed in T-shirts and shorts and a
storm can kick up and drop temperatures 20 degrees, you get some
borderline hypothermia cases,'' Lane said.
   Four helicopters and 35 ambulances were brought in to treat the
crowd.
   ``The crowd had to leave the amphitheater, and there was some
panic as people were leaving. Some suffered hyperventilation and
some had hypothermia as they were getting wet,'' said Carolyn
Etter, a parks department director.
   Etter said Lee Gilling, superintendent of Denver's mountain
parks system, went to investigate. ``As far as Lee can tell, there
was no functional problem (with the amphitheater) but a storm and
crowd problem,'' she said.
   Mark Wagner, who led a group of 26 students from Houston,
attributed much of the panic to altitude sickness. Red Rocks, the
Denver park where the amphitheater is situated, is at 6,400 feet,
Lane said.
   ``As it started to rain, there was no covering, so people went
to the wall for cover,'' Wagner said. ``The people never had time
to get rested from the long walk up to Red Rocks.''
   Phyllis Westerman, 32, and David Jones, 40, remained today at
St. Anthony's Central for treatment of chest pains, said hospital
spokeswoman Bev Lilly. They were listed in good and stable
condition respectively. Their hometowns were not immediately known.
   The event was part of the five-day national youth conference
that began Saturday.

<HEAD>North Korea Urges United Nations to Open Border for Radical Student</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLY TUNNEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korea stepped up demands Tuesday
for the United Nations to let a South Korean student who visited
the communist nation return home via the border at Panmunjom.
   The United States accused North Korea of increasing tensions by
turning the truce village of Panmunjom into a ``political carnval''
with groups from North Korea shouting ``Yankee go home!'' and
making obscene gestures at U.S. guards.
   Officials in Seoul said the communist government in Pyongyang
sent two telephone messages to the South Korean government Tuesday
asking for meetings at Panmunjom to discuss the return of
20-year-old radical student Im Su-kyong.
   South Korea, which has said it will arrest Ms. Im when she
returns, did not reply immediately.
   At the 450th meeting of the Military Armistice Commission held
Tuesday in Panmunjom, North Korea demanded the U.S.-led United
Nations Command reconsider its refusal to allow Ms. Im to cross the
border.
   Maj. Gen. Choe Ui Ung, the chief North Korean delegate, said it
was ``quite natural and proper'' for Ms. Im to return home through
the border and ``there is no need for her to make the long way
around'' and travel through third countries.
   U.S. Rear Adm. Larry G. Vogt, leader of the U.N. delegation,
responded that Ms. Im's crossing concerns the two Koreas and ``is
not armistice business.''
   Vogt said North Korea has used Ms. Im and her supporters to
create a ``political carnival'' at the border with demonstrations,
banners, and protesters shouting ``Yankee go home.''
   He said groups visiting the North Korean side of the
Demilitarized Zone around Panmunjom in July shouted slogans, and
swore at and made obscene gestures toward those on the other side
of the border.
   Choe said, ``Even the U.S. youths and other Americans who
visited Panmunjom shouted with indignation towards your GIs, `Why
have the Americans came to another's country to serve as watchmen
of division?'''
   Observers said the demonstrations often included Ms. Im and
foreigners attending the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students
July 1-8 in Pyongyang.
   The student has said she will cross the border on Aug. 15, the
anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule in
1945, in a demonstration for unification of the countries divided
after World War II. Seoul says her illegal visit is a breach of
national security.
   Ms. Im has become a celebrity in Pyongyang, according to North
Korean military observer Lt. Col. Yun Ki Oon. He told the meeting
she is called the ``flower of unification'' and is mobbed wherever
she goes.
   North Korea's Central News Agency, monitored in Tokyo, said Ms.
Im has received many visitors and gifts at the hospital where she
is recovering from a six-day hunger strike, started after she was
refused permission to cross the border July 27.

<HEAD>Rocket Hits Kabul Ammunition Depot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rocket slammed into a large military
depot for ammunition today, setting off a chain reaction of
explosions that rocked the capital.
   There were no immediate reports of casualties from the attack at
dusk. Ambulances rushed to the scene.
   As the blasts echoed across the city, an electrical outage
plunged Kabul into darkess for about 20 minutes. Black smoke,
meanwhile, billowed over northwest Kabul where the depot was on
fire.
   The depot is about a half mile from a large residential
neighborhood.
   The almost nonstop wave of explosions was continuing two hours
after rocket hit. It was one of about six rockets fired late today.
   They followed a lull in such attacks earlier in the day.
However, more than 115 rockets have crashed into the city during
the past four days.
   No group claimed responsibility for today's attack, but
U.S.-backed guerrillas fighting to oust the Soviet-allied
government have tried repeatedly to hit military targets in Kabul,
with little success.
   Since late June, Kabul has been hit by almost daily rocket
attacks, but most have struck civilian areas. At least 281 people
have been killed and 745 injured in the rocket attacks and a car
bombing, according to U.N. sources.
   More than 40 rockets hit the capital Monday, the worst day of
the recent blitz. Eight people were reported killed.
   There were initially reports today that the depot was set on
fire by sabotage. However, U.N. sources confirmed it was hit by a
rocket.
   A well-informed military source said the Afghan army recently
moved a large amount of ammunition from the city's airport to the
depot.

<TEXT>
   Police Tuesday broke up a nine-day sit-in by
residents unhappy over the influx of Vietnamese refugees.
   About 100 police carried 26 protesters from the site in a rural
park, authorities said. The demonstrators linked hands and sang
before the officers moved in.
   ``One or two of them did struggle a little bit, but none of them
very violently,'' said district police commander Richard Younge.
There were no arrests, he said.
   Up to 300 protesters had assembled at the site during the
sit-in, although only 26 were there during the early morning raid.
   The protesters said they are concerned that the construction of
a camp for Vietnamese refugees would pollute a nearby reservoir.
They also have said they are unhappy with the influx of Vietnamese
into the British colony.
   Local residents met later Tuesday in the nearby village of Sai
Kung and said they would hold a mass protest demonstration,
government-funded radio reported. No date was given.
   A Hong Kong government spokesman said construction at the site,
which was delayed by the sit-in, had resumed.
   The government is building the detention center to shelter
Vietnamese fleeing their communist homeland. More than 52,000 boat
people have taken refuge in Hong Kong.
   Also on Tuesday, Japanese officials said two wooden boats
carrying 280 Vietnamese refugees arrived in southern Japan.
   One boat with 151 Vietnamese arrived near a small island
northwest of Nagasaki, said Keisuke Sakamoto, spokesman for the
local Maritime Safety Agency, Japan's coast guard.
   The second boat, carrying 129 refugees, arrived in the same area.
   Since May, 592 boat people have come ashore in Japan.
   Kyodo News Service quoted the latest boat people as saying they
left Vietnam to escape poverty.
   Sakamoto said they were to be taken to a refugee reception
center.
   At an international conference in June, Britain and Hong Kong
called for forced repatriation of boat people not fleeing political
persecution. Vietnam refuses to accept such people.

   A 5-year-old boy who was hit by cars

   Nathaniel Williams Jr. died Sunday, an hour after being struck
by a car as he walked home from a baseball field where he was

   On May 13, he was struck at the same spot, a half-block from

shopping, said Tim Blair, his uncle.
   ``He spent a week in the hospital and hadn't fully recovered,''
Blair said. ``The doctors were to decide soon whether he had to

   A spokesman for the Ramsey County attorney's office said the
driver in the fatal accident was arrested for suspected criminal
vehicular operation. The suspect was released Monday without being
charged, but the investigation would continue, the spokesman said.

   The Rev. A. W. Wilson, whose church

   Funeral services for Wilson, who died at home Friday after a

<HEAD>71 Feared Dead in Latest Attack by Pirates</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A group of pirates who stormed a
boat carrying 84 Vietnamese stole valuables, raped women and sunk
the vessel, and 71 of the refugees were feared dead, officials said
Tuesday.
   The attack brought to 271 the number of boat people missing and
believed dead as a result of piracy off the coast of this Southeast
Asian country this year, U.N. and Malaysian officials said.
   The officials, quoting the 13 survivors of the latest attack,
said the refugees left Vietnam last week. They were off the Kuala
Trengganu coast, 180 miles northeast of Kuala Lumpur, when they
were attacked Saturday night by pirates in two boats.
   The pirates took their valuables, raped some of the women, sank
the refugees' boat and fled, the officials said.
   The officials did not say how the attackers were armed.
   In the past, refugee officials have blamed most such attacks on
Thai pirates.
   Three survivors of the attack were rescued by oil rig workers
Sunday in the South China Sea, and fishermen picked up the other 10.
   Refugee officials said the survivors were being put into a
refugee camp to await screening for settlement in the United States
or elsewhere.
   In one of the worst such attacks in recent years, a Vietnamese
refugee boat with 130 people aboard was stormed by Thai pirates
April 16. One refugee survived, but the rest are believed dead.
   Officials say this year's death could actually be much higher
than 271, because some attacks leave no survivors and go unreported.
   The refugee officials say they believe most of the pirates were
Thais.
   About 23,000 Vietnamese refugees live in Malaysian camps.
Malaysia accepts them only for temporary stay before permanent
settlement elsewhere.

<HEAD>Former `Bloom County' Cartoonist Joins `Boating'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Berke Breathed,
whose last ``Bloom County'' comic strips appeared in newspapers
last weekend, will be a contributing editor at Boating magazine,
the magazine announced Tuesday.
   John Owens, editor-in-chief of Boating, said in a statement from
New York that Breathed, an avid boater who has homes in Evergreen
and Florida, will write a monthly humor column titled ``Overboard.''
   Breathed, who owns four boats, said his column will reflect his
consuming interest in the sport.
   ```Boating' looks at equipment in the way I want to look at
equipment _ what's coming out, and why we silly boaters think that
a new-style helm station is exciting,'' he said in the statement.
``The emphasis is on the engineering and the equipment, rather than
the events and personalities.''
   Breathed discontinued ``Bloom County,'' which featured Opus the
penguin, to begin work on a new strip called ``Outland'' that will
begin appearing Sept. 3. ``Outland'' features a black ghetto child
who was a ``Bloom County'' regular, with Opus possibly making
appearances.
   Breathed won the Pulitzer Prize for cartooning in 1987.

   First, Iran's new president offered to
help solve the hostage crisis, then the interior minister renewed
threats against the United States. On Tuesday, a Tehran newspaper
was offering help again.
   The events seem to be part of a tug of war between President
Hashemi Rafsanjani and his followers _ called pragmatic by some and
opportunist by others _ and the hard-liners of Interior Minister
Ali Akbar Mohtashemi for control of Iran following the death in
June of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Rafsanjani made the offer of help in his inaugural speech last
week. On Monday, Mohtashemi urged Shiite Moslems around the world
to continue fighting the United States, which Iran cals the ``great
Satan.''
   On Tuesday, the English-language Tehran Times quoted a source it
did not identify as saying Iran would ``definitely'' intercede to
gain the release of the hostages if Washington gave assurances it
would release frozen Iranian assets.
   Rafsanjani, allied with spiritual leader Ali Khamenei, is known
to seek better ties with the West in the effort to rebuild Iran
after eight years of war with Iraq. He appears to see freeing the
hostages as a first step to good relations.
   Mohtashemi's faction, including Premier Hussein Musavi and Ahmad
Khomeini, son of the revolutionary patriarch, wants the revolution
to keep its confrontational edge.
   For hard-liners, diplomatic reliations mean compromise with the
enemy. Many radical Shiite Moslems in Lebanon agree with them.
   Sixteen Western hostages are held in Lebanon, most by Shiite
groups sponsored by Iran. Eight are Americans.
   About $2 billion in assets, including military equipment ordered
before the revolution, were frozen after the U.S. Embassy in Tehran
was stormed in February 1979 by militant students, who held 52
Americans hostage for 444 days. Iran claims the assets now are
worth $12 billion.
   According to the source quoted in the Tehran Times, U.S.
assurances that the assets will be released ``should be concrete
and there should be convincing grounds that these proposals will be
translated into action.'' Excerpts of the report were carried by
the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
   Repeating Iran's frequently stated position, the source said:
``It's a well-known fact that we do not have any direct or indirect
hand in hostage-taking. Of course, we have spiritual influence in
Lebanon which we can use in our efforts for the release of the
hostages there.''
   Mohammad Javad Larijani, former deputy foreign minister and a
Rafsanjani ally, was quoted in a dispatch from the news agency as
saying ``it would be a great achievement for the world of Islam''
if Iran could secure the release of the hostages.
   ``It will make it clear that Iran has always been working for
the benefit of humanity,'' IRNA quoted him as saying.
   Larijani had helped improve diplomatic relations with the West,
but resigned earlier this year when a struggle over the issue began
in the leadership.
   In an editorial Tuesday, the Tehran Times called the United
States ``an oppresser'' for freezing the assets and said relations
between the two countries would be like that of ``lamb and wolf.''
   It added, however: ``As the officials of the Islamic Republic
have said repeatedly, the doors are not completely closed and the
right intentions and thoughts can help resolve the problems.''

   A homeless man accused of not paying $6.51
for a meal he had eaten was mistakenly held in jail for 87 days
after the complaint filed against him was dismissed, authorities
say.
   Robert J. Mandt apparently wanted to stay in the Waukesha County
Jail to get three meals a day and a roof over his head, his
attorney, Bradley J. Bloch, said Monday.
   Records showed Mandt was held for 48 days on a misdemeanor
charge of defrauding a restaurant keeper in a March 18 incident.
   The charge was dismissed May 5, but officials did not realize
that until July 29. Mandt was taken to a Milwaukee intersection and
released two days later at his request, Jail Administrator William
H. Conine said.
   The charge was dismissed because of the ``feeling the defendant
had been freeloading on the system'' and already had served enough
time for the offense, said Assistant District Attorney Timothy
Westphal.
   ``It's very unfortunate that he was able to manipulate the
system through a snafu when the paperwork never came through,''
Westphal said.

   A U.S. art dealer agreed today to give the
Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus access to four sixth-century
mosaics while she decides whether to appeal a judge's order to
return them to the Cypriots.
   U.S. District Judge James E. Noland ruled Thursday that dealer
Peg Goldberg of Carmel had not obtained valid title to the mosaics
when she bought them last summer in Switzerland for $1.2 million.
   Ms. Goldberg had refused to surrender the mosaics until she
decided whether to appeal. On Friday, the Cypriots demanded
immediate release of the artworks, but an agreement was worked out
before a hearing on the request began today.
   The agreement allows the Cypriots immediate access to the
mosaics in an Indianapolis vault. The Cypriots agreed not to remove
the mosaics or do any restoration work for two weeks while Ms.
Goldberg decides whether to appeal.
   If she does not appeal, the Cypriots can take the mosaics home.
   The Republic of Cyprus and the church had sued Ms. Goldberg to
recover the works, which had been stripped from a church in
Turkish-occupied Cyprus in the late 1970s.
   ``Today is a great day for Cyprus. Fifteen years of hard work in
securing our artifacts, our cultural heritage, have not been
wasted,'' said Michael Kyprianou, senior counsel to the Republic of
Cyprus.
   Cypriot officials learned of the mosaics' whereabouts when Ms.
Goldberg offered them to the J. Paul Getty Museum in California for
$20 million in January. The Cypriots sued Ms. Goldberg in March.
   June Walton, an attorney for the Cypriots, said a local Greek
Orthodox priest had been asked to bless the church treasures, which
date to 525 A.D. and depict Christ as a boy. An art expert also was
to inspect the mosaics today.

   Citizens of the town where Joseph
Cicippio's family is from have called on the Italian government to
help free him and other Western hostages held in Lebanon.
   Speaking on Italian TV Tuesday, Mayor Giovanni Di Stefano
expressed the townspeople's solidarity with Cicippio.
   He said that he and other people in the town of 1,400 located
110 miles east of Rome in the Abruzzi region had spoken by
telephone with Cicippio's relatives in the United States.
   Cicippio's father, Camillo, left Italy and settled in the United
States in 1909. Joseph Cicippio and his brother, Thomas, visited
Fresagrandinaria several years ago to try to reconstruct their
family tree.
   Cicippio, 58, was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986 from the American
University of Beirut where he worked as acting comptroller.
   Di Stefano said the town sent a telegram to Italy's Foreign
Ministry asking the government to take ``concrete steps'' to help
win the release of Cicippio and other Western hostages.

   A sharp earthquake shook the San Francisco
Bay area for 10 seconds early today, breaking glass, causing rock
slides and apparently prompting a man to jump to his death from a
fifth-story window, authorities said.
   The quake, measuring 5.1 on the Richter scale, occurred at 1:13
a.m. and was centered on the San Andreas Fault about 13 miles south
of San Jose, said the U.S. Geological Survey. It was felt as far as
San Luis Obispo, 230 miles south of here.
   No major damage was reported.
   The quake struck as state and federal emergency officials were
about to begin a two-day test of earthquake communications
procedures. The drill involved a mock earthquake in the Bay area in
which 5,000 people die.
   ``It felt like I was having my bed rolled around on a
skateboard. I woke up and I was moving,'' said Henry J. Peterson of
Santa Clara, next to San Jose.
   Two aftershocks measuring 4.2 and 4.5 rippled through the area
later this morning. State officials warned there could be more
quakes in northern California in the next five days, with a quake
up to 6.2 possible but not likely.
   In Los Gatos, 50 miles south of San Francisco, a 19-year-old man
was apparently startled awake by the earthquake and jumped out of
his bedroom window, police dispatcher Lisa Douglas said in a
statement.
   The shaking sent rocks tumbling onto highways, said a Santa Cruz
County Sheriff's Department emergency dispatcher who declined to
give her name. ``They cleared the debris by hand and all roads are
now cleared,'' she said.
   ``There was some damage in the Santa Cruz Mountains,'' said San
Jose police Officer Jay Forbes. ``It was mainly broken windows and
mirrors. Nothing serious.''
   The false ceiling in a vacant Los Gatos business came down, and
half a dozen businesses reported broken windows, police said.
   ``I felt a little rumble and then all the windows started
shaking real bad,'' said Chris Soliday, a clerk at an all-night
convenience store in Sunnyvale. ``Some stuff in the aisles fell
down. There's broken glass, dented cans, some beer bottles broken.''
   The epicenter was in almost exactly the same place as a 5.0
quake on June 27, 1988, said USGS geophysicist Dave Oppenheimer.
   Residents shaken awake by the temblor described it as jolting
and rolling.
   ``It was the strongest I've ever felt,'' said Bernie Beck, 38,
who lives in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district.
   ``I live in an old building that was built after the 1906 quake,
and it really had me going,'' Beck said. ``It felt like you were
sitting on a saw horse, rocking back and forth.''
   San Francisco's Great Quake, which occurred in 1906 before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3. Recent
estimates say more than 2,000 people died in the quake and the fire
it touched off, which burned much of the city.
   The open-ended Richter scale is a measure of the energy released
by an earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a
seisomograph.
   Each increase of one number, as in a jump from magnitude 5.5 to
6.5, means that the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of
3.5 can cause slight damage in populated areas, while a quake of
6.0 can cause severe damage. In March 1964 an earthquake in Alaska
hit 8.5 on the Richter scale, killing 114 people.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Mickey Leland, who earned a reputation in
the state Legislature as a black-power firebrand in the early
1970s, made his mark in Congress as a liberal, globe-trotting
advocate for the hungry and downtrodden.
   The 44-year-old Houston Democrat, who serves as chairman of a
select House Select Committee on Hunger, was aboard a plane
reported missing in Ethiopia today during a tour of refugee camps
near the border with Sudan.
   A Lubbock native who attended Houston public schools, Leland
graduated from Texas Southern University with a pharmacy degree and
was an instructor of pharmacy at TSU and a practicing pharmacist
before winning a Texas House seat in 1972.
   The lawmaker entered the Legislature from a poverty-stricken
section of Houston as a civil rights activist with a militant
reputation. He wore a big Afro, a leather shoulder bag, African
print shirts and high-heeled boots.
   As his career grew, his attire during the early years of his
three terms in the Legislature gave way to business suits, and he
has since shared a fashionable home in an upscale Houston
neighborhood with his wife, Alison, and son Jarrett, who was
baptized by South Africa's Bishop Desmond Tutu.
   His political style also has moderated somewhat since his
election to the U.S. House in 1978. He replaced the retiring
Democratic Rep. Barbara Jordan.
   Representing an inner-city district, he faced no Republican
opposition and defeated a Socialist Workers Party candidate with
more than 96 percent of the vote.
   Leland won re-election five times with ease, but drew a harsh
1988 primary challenge from Elizabeth Spates, who charged that
Leland had lost touch with constituents while seeking national
exposure as spokesman for the hungry and homeless.
   Leland won the primary with 82 percent of the vote but
acknowledged some truth in Ms. Spates' allegation.
   ``There's people I've not touched in a long time. This has been
a great exercise for me,'' Leland said. ``I feel very confident
that my community is very solidly behind me now. Before there was
some question _ I have been on the road quite a bit. I have been
going abroad.''
   In an article for the Houston Chronicle earlier this year, Rep.
Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, the ranking Republican on the House
Select Committee on Intelligence, said Leland's ``personal
diplomacy'' with Ethiopian and Sudanese officials ``opened up
life-sustaining corridors in the border region between the two
countries _ a peaceful (relief) supply route.''
   Leland, who also serves on the House Committee on Energy and
Commerce and the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service and was
twice chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, often has thrust
himself into the position of mediator in matters of international
or interracial consequence.
   For 10 years, he has overseen a program in which black youths
from his district were sent to Israel for six-week stays. He was
honored in April by the Union of American Hebrew Congregations for
his work in uniting blacks and Jews.
   He is one of several congressmen investigating colonias along
the Mexican border, where thousands live in communities witout
running water, electricity and sewage systems.
   He joined two other congressmen last October in a trip to Cuba
in an effort to negotiate the release of five political prisoners
and their families. The delegation got three prisoners freed; a
fourth decided to remain in Cuba.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who chose Leland as one of the top four
fund-raisers in his 1988 presidential campaign, praised the
``consistent streak of humanity in Mickey Leland'' during an
election year trip to Houston.
   His name has often been circulated as a possible mayoral
candidate in Houston, although he has indicated greater interest in
a U.S. Senate race.
   Despite his political roots, Leland has maintained a close
relationship with the business establishment in downtown Houston,
which is in his district. He said in a 1988 interview that success
has not changed his views.
   ``I certainly don't apologize for making myself better,'' Leland
said. But he added, ``It would be a profound contradiction if I was
getting rich and forgetting my constituents.''

   Up to 14 million American families are
``living on the knife edge of homelessness'' and may be forced onto
the streets by a mild recession, a private study concluded Tuesday.
   The report by the American Affordable Housing Institute said
that public efforts to help the homeless rely too little on
prevention, are badly underfinanced and uncoordinated and are
conducted by officials often unaware of the resources available to
them.
   ``People are falling through America's too loosely meshed safety
net,'' David C. Schwartz, director of the institute, said at a news
conference. ``People aren't getting the services governments say
they want to provide.''
   The report by the institute, a research center at Rutgers
University in New Brunswick, N.J., estimated that there are 4
million to 14 million American families ``living on the knife edge
of homelessness'' who could face life on the streets should a mild
recession occur.
   ``They are one pay check, one domestic argument from the
streets,'' the report said. ``In a mild recession, homelessness in
America is likely to double and triple almost overnight.''
   Estimates on the current number of homeless people range between
655,000 to 4 million, but the total is growing 20 percent to 40
percent annually, the study said.
   The main federal program for the homeless is the Stewart
McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, a 1987 law named for the late
Connecticut Republican congressman who was active on homelessness
issues.
   The legislation gave the government authority to spend up to $3
billion over five years for programs for the homeless, but through
this year Congress has actually provided only $1.1 billion.
   The report said the law's broad range of programs covering
temporary and permanent housing, drug counseling, health care and
educational services are the right steps to take. But it complained
that the legislation ``is not even an effective national treatment
for homelessness for it is still seriously underfunded.''
   Besides studying federal efforts, the report surveyed state
homelessness efforts.
   ``Plans submitted by each state indicate in many instances a
lack of coordination, capacity and compassion in addressing the
needs of their homeless populations,'' it said.
   The study singled out New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts,
Maryland, St. Louis, New York City and Allegheny County, Pa., for
for having programs that effectively help some people avoid living
on the streets.

<TEXT>
   Art collector Paul Mellon and the Yale Center
for British Art said Tuesday they plan to sell 42 masterworks
valued at more than $100 million, including Van Goghs and Picassos,
to fund future purchases.
   Fifteen major Impressionist and Modern works will go on the
block Nov. 14 in New York, Mellon said in a statement issued by
Christie's auction house.
   They include Edouard Manet's ``Rue Mosnier, Paris,'' Vincent van
Gogh's ``The Tree, Arles'' and ``A Ploughman in the Fields Near
Arles,'' and Pablo Picasso's ``The Death of Harlequin'' and ``Self
Portrait, Barcelona.'' The sale also includes an Edgar Degas bronze
and three Degas wax sculptures of ballet dancers.
   On Nov. 17, Christie's in London will offer nine works owned by
Mellon and 18 that he donated to the Yale Center for British Art.
   The selections range from the 1589 British School portrait of
``An Unknown Man, Aged 29,'' to the modern portrait of ``The Sixth
Earl of Winterton'' by Sir Alfred J. Munnings.
   ``By selling a small number of individual works by artists who
are already well represented at the center, we plan to establish an
acquisitions fund which will enrich and expand this important
educational resource,'' said Duncan Robinson, Yale Center director.
   Mellon has given the center more than 1,200 paintings, 20,000
prints and drawings, and 20,000 books since 1977.
   Mellon is a founding benefactor of the National Gallery of Art
in Washington, D.C., which was established by his father, Andrew W.
Mellon, and has given it more than 700 important works. He also has
donated about 1,500 works to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in
Richmond.
   ``I will continue to maintain and possibly enhance my
collection, which is a constant source of satisfaction to me and my
wife, Bunny, whose appreciative eye helped shape the Impressionist
and Modern collection,'' said Mellon. ``Naturally, cultural
institutions in which I am interested can be assured of my
continued support.''

   Michael Lomax is dropping out of the race for
mayor, an aide said today. The move leave former Mayor Maynard
Jackson the only announced candidate, with little over a week left
for others to decide whether to run.
   WAGA-TV and The Atlanta Journal reported that Lomax, the Fulton
County Commission chairman, would drop out with an announcement
later today.
   ``The decision has been made that Michael just can't win,''
campaign spokesman Jim Gray told the TV station.
   ``Michael does not want to be part of a divisive campaign. With
less than two months to go, he had to decide, `Do I want to slug it
out?'''
   Lomax and Jackson, both Democrats, were seeking to succeed
Andrew Young in the non-partisan election Oct. 3. Young is barred
by law from running for a third consecutive term. Candidates must
file qualifying papers Aug. 14-16.
   Gray said the campaign's polls showed the gap between the two
candidates had narrowed in recent days to about 18 points, but
Lomax decided he had too much ground to make up to catch Jackson,
who was mayor from 1974 to 1982.

<HEAD>Estonians Approve Strict Voting Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers in the republic of Estonia on Tuesday
tightened residency requirements for voting and running for office
in a move to stem the influence of Russians.
   Ina Tamet, an editor at official Estonian Radio in Tallinn, said
the Baltic republic's Supreme Soviet approved the law by a 194-36
margin.
   Russians make up about a third of the republic's 1.6 million
people, and some Russian workers went on strike for several days in
July to protest the legislation.
   Ms. Tamet said there were reports the Russian workers would
strike again after the law was approved, but Estonian journalists
had no firm information that a strike would follow.
   The law requires that residents live in one place for two years,
or in Estonia for five years before they be permitted to vote. It
requires candidates for local offices to live in one place for five
years, or if they've moved within Estonia to be residents of the
republic for 10 years before they may run, Ms. Tamet said.
   Despite the dispute over provisions of the law, she said the
legislative debate was ``relatively quiet.''
   Estonians, who are at the forefront of the three Baltic
republics' drive for greater local control over the economy and
political system, say they are being overrun by Russians and other
Soviet ethnic groups, imported to work in the republic's factories.
   Ethnic Estonians are more stable, and therefore would gain from
the new election law.
   In July, the national legislature also gave Estonia and the two
other Baltic republics, Lithuania and Latvia, the go-ahead to begin
wide-ranging economic reforms, including the possibility of
creating their own currencies.
   Economic reformers say that is essential to help them reform the
price structure. They view the rigid Soviet system of state-control
prices as one of the biggest handicaps they must overcome.

<HEAD>Witch Coven Wins Tax Break</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Witchcraft is a legitimate religion and
its churches, or covens, are entitled to the same tax breaks as
those of more established religions, the state division of taxation
has ruled.
   ``With this ruling, we witches will definitely be able to come
out of the closet and take our place in society,'' said Joyce
Siegrist, 45, high priestess of Rosegate Coven. She said the coven
has a core group of 11 members and 30 to 40 initiates.
   The ruling announced today by Tax Administrator R. Gary Clark
overturned an earlier decision that said the coven did not meet
criteria for being a church.
   The coven, also known as Our Lady of the Roses Wiccan Church,
will no longer have to pay state sales tax for supplies.
   ``This decision demonstrates that, with a properly presented
case, even unusual or small religious groups can be treated equally
with more mainstream religions by the state,'' said A. Gregory
Frazier, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who announced the
decision. He represented the witches in an administrative hearing
in May.
   Hearing officer Sandra J. Murphy, who recommended that Clark
grant the exemption, ruled July 20 that the coven fulfilled most of
the state Supreme Court's criteria for determining the legitimacy
of a religion.
   The Wiccans are a nonprofit group, not set up for the purpose of
avoiding taxes, and have a litany or system of prayer, as well as
specific doctrines and practices that all members of the coven were
expected to follow, Murphy ruled.
   Last fall, when the tax exemption was denied, the division's
questions indicated that officials were focusing on the apparent
lack of formal theology schools for training wiccan clergy, and
also on their willingness to allow members to belong to other
churches, Frazier said.
   The latter argument was rebutted when the Rev. Thomas Ahlburn,
senior minister of the First Unitarian Church of Providence,
testified that his church and many Eastern religions also permit
their members to belong to other faiths, Frazier said.

   Move over teen-agers, ``driver's ed'' isn't

   Drivers aged 55 and over who took a refresher course had fewer
traffic convictions and serious accidents than did their cohorts
who didn't return to the classroom, according to a California study
released Tuesday.
   The American Association of Retired Persons said the study is
evidence that proper training can help older people ``remain safe
drivers longer.''
   ``To lose the ability to drive often traps older people in their
homes,'' said AARP President-elect Robert Maxwell. ``For older
Americans, driving a car is more than just transportation. It means
independence and dignity.''
   Drivers over age 65 are second only to those age 15 to 24 in
traffic accidents, and, when the number of miles driven is taken
into account, the two groups are almost equal.
   The Department of Transportation says the verdict isn't in yet
on whether refresher courses actually change driver performance for
older Americans.
   But James Hedlund of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration said the California study ``certainly gives us more
positive information than we had before.''
   The study compared driving records for 40,339 graduates of
California's eight-hour Mature Driver Improvement Program with
those of 75,064 older drivers who did not take the course. All were
aged 55 or above; with ages ranging into the 80s.
   Factoring out differences between the two groups in gender,
prior driving record, age, and area of residence, the graduates had
16 percent fewer accidents involving death or injury and 15.7
percent fewer traffic convictions.
   The report cautioned that drivers who signed up for the
voluntary training were ``a highly self-selected group who would be
expected ... to have lower subsequent accident rates.''
   Neverthless, it said, there was ``suggestive evidence'' that the
courses were responsible for at least some of the reduction in
accident risk.
   ``We feel the results are quite suggestive and promising,'' said
Ray Peck, director of research for the California Department of
Motor Vehicles.
   Despite the positive results, neither Peck nor the AARP
advocated mandatory driver's education for older Americans, saying
unwilling participants make poor students.
   ``Drivers with real bad attitudes and bad records probably would
be irresponsive to it,'' Peck said.
   Maxwell added: ``Age does not determine your driving ability.
There are people who are 80 years old that are much better drivers
than people who are 50.''
   State laws in California and 28 other states make older
Americans eligible for reduced auto insurance premiums, with
discounts of up to 10 percent, if they take an approved refresher
course. Twenty-six of those laws have been passed since 1986.
   The California study recommended that ``caution be exercised in
any promotional efforts to substantially increase the proportion of
elderly drivers who enroll in a mature driver program'' because
that could bring in people who are greater accident risks and
diminish the rationale for giving insurance discounts.

   Toxic algae killed thousands of salmon as
it spread through two western fjords and engulfed six fish farms,
officials said Tuesday.
   The algae, which kills fish by destroying their gills, is not
believed to be harmful to humans, said Nils Torsvik of the
Fisheries Directorate.
   ``No one knows if it will spread. It is behaving differently
than anyone predicted. It is not acting like anything found in the
textbooks,'' said Jon Lauritzen, a spokesman for the Fisheries
Ministry.
   A crisis team will monitor the algae, which was discovered a
week ago in Ryfylke, an area of long fjords between the west coast
cities of Stavanger and Bergen, Torsvik said. Other areas will also
be tested, he said.
   The algae thrives in brackish waters and has killed more than
400 tons of fish, including 100,000 salmon worth $2.15 million,
Torsvik said.

   President Bush, telling a group of civil
rights leaders ``your problems are my problems,'' vowed today to
work toward stopping the decline of inner cities and making ``the
'90s a decade of urban renaissance.''
   ``We must create conditions for urban growth and economic
revival, conditions that leave no one behind,'' Bush said in
remarks to the 79th annual meeting of the National Urban League.
   Bush made no mention of current disputes between his
administration and civil rights advocates.
   But he said at one point, ``Before I go on _ I want to make sure
everyone in this room knows just where I stand, just where our
administration stands. My administration is committed to reaching
out to minorities, to striking down barriers to free and open
access.''
   ``We will not tolerate discrimination, bigotry or bias of any
kind _ period,'' Bush said.
   The president did not announce plans to visit sub-Saharan Africa
this fall, despite earlier such speculation by White House
officials.
   Although Bush reiterated promises to work against poverty and
racial intolerence, civil rights leaders attending the Urban League
conference earlier suggested Bush's deeds have not always matched
his words.
   Before hearing directly from Bush today, several prominent civil
rights advocates said the president's record thus far has been
weak, though they embraced Bush's role in achieving legislation
extending civil rights protection to disabled Americans.
   ``The civil rights community would give the president high marks
for accessibility and symbolism and rhetoric but low marks on
substantive civil rights policy,'' said Ralph Neas, executive
director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.
   Civil rights leaders cited Bush's acceptance of Supreme Court
rulings limiting affirmative action, his veto of minimum wage
legislation and his choice of black Detroit lawyer William Lucas to
be the Justice Department's top civil rights enforcer. Lucas was
rejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee on a 7-7 tie vote.
   Separately, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today
that the president is still undecided on whether to resubmit Lucas'
nomination during the current congressional recess _ a process that
would temporarily sidestep the confirmation process.
   ``No decision has been made,'' Fitzwater said. Most civil rights
groups have voiced opposition to Lucas' nomination, citing his
alleged inexperience with civil rights law.
   Fitzwater also suggested the president was not about to reverse
his position that no new laws are necessary to seek to modify the
Supreme Court decisions. ``That's a decision that's already been
made by the Justice Department,'' Fitzwater said.
   Civil rights leaders also fault the president's efforts to win
Senate confirmation to a federal judgeship for Vaughn Walker, a San
Francisco attorney under fire for his membership in a club that
excludes women; and the Justice Department's decision to undo
existing school desegregation orders in Georgia, and its filing of
a lawsuit challenging a Prince George's County, Md., desegregation
plan.
   Bush told the Urban League Conference: ``The challenge for urban
America is a challenge for all of America ... And it's a challenge
I take to heart. Your problems are my problems. Your hopes (are)
the hopes of all Americans.
   ``Today, I offer you my hand. I offer you my word. Together, we
will make America open and equal to all.
   ``Together, we will find a way to stop the decline of our inner
cities _ to restore hope, and make the 90s a decade of urban
renaissance,'' he added.
   Bush also said he would not rest ``until I know I've done
everything in my power to ensure that we succeed _ that every child
in our inner cities has a shot at a good job, that every kid stays
in school, gets a quality education, lives in decent housing _ in a
neighborhood free of drugs, fear and violence.''
   Frederick McClure, Bush's congressional liaison and the highest
ranking black member of the White House staff, said such episodes
``have in no way diminished the president's commitment on the civil
rights front.''
   Most of the civil rights movement's agenda ``is George Bush's
agenda,'' he said, adding that Bush's priority remains one of
``breaking down barriers, economic or otherwise.''
   Urban League President John E. Jacob challenged the president to
use the speech ``to present bold new initiatives that help
America's poor people and put us back on the path of racial
progress.''
   Civil rights leaders generally praise Bush for his ``offered
hand'' approach, but fault him on his actions.
   ``Symbolism is important, but it's not enough,'' said Neas.
   However, Neas did applaud Bush's role in helping to craft a
bipartisan compromise _ reached last week _ on legislation
extending civil rights laws to the nation's 37 million disabled
people.

   An Arab gunman who infiltrated from Jordan
wounded an American and held an off-duty soldier hostage for four
hours today before being killed by Israeli troops, the army said.
   The siege ended when soldiers stormed a hut on the Kibbutz Lotan
collective farm, 12 miles north of the Israeli resort city of Eilat
and less than a mile from the Jordan-Israel border.
   In Jordan, a military spokesman was quoted as saying the
attacker was a Jordanian soldier who had abandoned his post. The
Israeli army said the gunman, who carried an M-16 rifle, was
apparently deranged.
   Hospital officials identified the American as Lauren Rosen, 25,
of Englewood, N.J., who was working as a volunteer at the kibbutz.
They said she was slightly wounded by a bullet that passed through
her neck.
   The hostage, Osnat Lev, was a member of an army unit made up of
soldiers who live and work on collective farms.
   Ms. Rosen was quoted by Israel army radio as saying the attacker
shouted in English ``It's because of my brother!'' before opening
fire on her, the soldier and a third woman in a date grove near the
kibbutz. The third woman escaped.
   Soldiers stormed the hut in the date grove where the woman was
held after attempting to negotiate with the Jordanian soldier for
several hours, the radio said. It said his only demand during the
negotiations was for a copy of the Koran, the Moslem holy book,
which he was given.
   In Amman, Jordan, the military official identified the attacker
as Farid Ali Mustafa, a soldier, according to the official Petra
news agency.
   The senior official, who was not identified, said the soldier
``carried out the attack on his own obviously.''
   The initial attack came at 11:30 a.m. and the building was
stormed about 3:30 p.m., the army said.
   ``A man dressed in military dress came out from behind one of
the trees and shot one shot, and that was that,'' Ms. Rosen told
Israel army radio. ``I was very, very lucky. I feel just fine.''
   Ms. Lev said the man kept mentioning a dead sister and asked the
location of Israeli army bases that he could attack.
   ``He said all the time that his sister was killed, and why was
she killed, and why I killed her. So I said I did not kill her at
all. He said that the Jews killed her and now he comes to kill
everybody,'' said the woman.
   She said she had worked as a volunteer on the kibbutz since June
and would not be frightened away by the attack. She added she would
probably stay at the kibbutz several more weeks.
   ``It's a very beautiful place even if things like this happen,''
she said.
   In Tel Aviv, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin used the incident to
point to Israel's efforts to fight terrorism.
   ``I believe it is time that the world will realize what is the
difference when we talk about terrorism ... and all the sorts of
atrocities they have carried out, and when the rest of the world
talks about (it), either from Washington or Paris or London,'' he
said.
   ``For us, fighting terrorism is a matter of night and day, a
matter of life and death,'' he told reporters at the Defense
Ministry.
   When asked if the attack was by a guerrilla group, Rabin replied
that it ``was an act by an individual,'' apparently a Jordanian
soldier.
   Ms. Rosen was rushed to Eilat's Yosef Tal Hospital with a
gunshot wound in the neck just where it meets the shoulder,
hospital director Haim Shoham said.
   About 60 to 70 people are believed to live at Kibbutz Lotan,
which grows vegetables and dates.
   The last cross-border attack involving hostages was on March 7,
1988, when three PLO guerrillas sneaked into southern Israel from
Egypt and hijacked a commuter bus in southern Israel.
   They killed three hostages before being shot dead by police. In
addition, nine Israelis, all workers at a nearby nuclear plant,
were shot and wounded.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization claimed responsibility for
the attack, which Israeli officials said was aimed at sabotaging an
American peace initiative by then-Secretary of State George Shultz.
   Two shooting incidents took place along the Jordanian border
earlier this year.
   On May 27, a Jordanian soldier and an Israeli patrol exchanged
fire across the border near Beit Shean, northeast of Jerusalem. The
Jordanian was killed, and two Israeli soldiers were wounded.
   In that incident, Jordan radio also reported the Jordanian
soldier had acted on his own after abandoning his post.
   On March 17, two gunmen killed an Israeli soldier near Hazeva,
23 miles south of the Dead Sea. Jordan later announced it captured
several men in the same area.
   In Damascus, Syria, the Fatah Uprising group, a rebel offshoot
of Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction of the PLO, claimed
responsibility for that attack.

   President Bush will make a detour to Miami on
his way to Maine next week to campaign for the Republican seeking
the late Claude Pepper's congressional seat, the White House said
Tuesday.
   Bush will appear in Miami next Wednesday at a rally for Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen, a Cuban-American and former state senator vying for
the seat left vacant when the 88-year-old Democratic dean of
Congress died in May.
   Bush's son Jeb, former Dade County Republican chairman and
Florida secretary of commerce, is managing her campaign.
   The Democrats will choose their nominee in a runoff next
Tuesday, and the special election will be Aug. 29.
   Bush is planning to spend Aug. 16-Sept. 5 at his oceanfront home
in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater joked about the
2,500-mile detour on the journey northward, ``So we're going to
Florida on the way to Maine. It's a fairly common route.''
   He said Bush has no plans yet to campaign in Texas or California
where other elections are coming up to fill seats vacated by two
other prominent Democrats who resigned, former Speaker Jim Wright
and majority whip Tony Coelho.

   President Bush conveyed thanks Tuesday for
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's efforts on behalf of the U.S.
hostages and asked his help in securing release of the body of
American hostage William R. Higgins.
   Bush expressed his gratitude in a meeting with Egypt's new
defense minister, Youssef Sabry Abu-Taleb.
   ``The phone calls were well received. ... He's been so helpful
to us in so many ways,'' the president said at the outset of an
Oval Office meeting.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said later the defense
minister brought a message from Mubarak ``dealing with the current
situation in the region'' and offering ``to help in any way that he
could.''
   He said Bush discussed the continuing U.S. ``concern about
regional security, including Libya,'' and, in a brief discussion of
the hostages, ``reiterated his desire for a definitive accounting
of Lt. Col. Higgins and his concern for the safety and release of
the hostages.''
   Eight Americans are being held by terrorist groups in Lebanon.
   FBI experts concluded Monday that a videotape released by one
terrorist group in Beirut last week does show Higgins dead.
   Abu-Taleb spent 15 to 20 minutes with Bush, and left the White
House without stopping to answer reporters' questions.
   Bush personally called many world leaders last week to seek
their help when terrorists were threatening to kill a second
American hostage, Joseph Cicippio. They suspended the threat on
Thursday under intense international pressure.
   Abu-Taleb is on his first visit to the United States to confer
with top U.S. officials since being named to the military post in a
surprise move by Mubarak four months ago. He replaced Field Marshal
Abdel-Halim Abu-Ghazala after eight years in the office.

   Paul Warhola, who used to give his youngest
brother, Andy Warhol, tips on art, is trying his own hand at
painting _ a can of Heinz vegetarian baked beans and two nearly
identical Heinz ketchup bottles.
   ``I'm starting from scratch on art,'' Warhola said. ``I wouldn't
want you to see the first 10 or so paintings. It will take me a
while to get into stride.''
   Warhola, 67, lives on a farm near Pittsburgh where he grows
flowers and vegetables and keeps chickens, ducks and geese.
   ``I picked Heinz because it's here in Pittsburgh and Andy did
Campbell's,'' Warhola said.
   Warhola already has a collector, a friend in the metals
recycling business who bought the three unsigned paintings for $350
apiece.
   ``He wanted me to sign them `Paul Warhol, Andy Warhol's

name _ Paul Warhola _ I will cheapen them. I have to be left alone
to do what I think is right.''

   Former CBS and now ABC newswoman Diane Sawyer
was called ``indisputably terrific'' and ``extremely intelligent''
in leading the women journalists on three major networks graded by
a panel selected by TV Guide.
   Connie Chung, of CBS, who left NBC this year; Maria Shriver, of
NBC; and Mary Alice Williams, formerly of CNN and now at NBC, were
also graded by the panel in the Aug. 12 issue of the magazine.
   The panel consisted of former CBS anchor Douglas Edwards,
Washington Post TV critic Tom Shales, Barbara Matusow, author of
``The Evening Stars'' and media writer for Washingtonian Magazine;
and Elsa Klensch, style editor, writer, and anchor for CNN. They
were asked to rank each woman in order of preference and comment on
each woman's journalistic ability, on-air presence, and strength
and weaknesses.
   Klensch described Sawyer as having a fantastic presence and
packaging herself very well. But Shales disagreed.
   ``She's the biggest star in the world. But no one knows why. She
didn't have any hot pieces on `60 Minutes' and it was generally
said that she waited to have stories handed to her,'' he said.
   Chung was ranked second. Panelists praised her skill, pointing
out her work as a CBS News correspondent in Washington during the
Watergate scandal.
   ``She's a tough reporter, very formidable,'' Shales said.
   The two men on the panel commented on Chung's sense of humor,
but the women felt she needed to ``loosen up a bit.''
   Shriver, ranked third, received the most criticism by three of
the panel members, who said she did not come across as serious or
sincere.
   Edwards praised Shriver for journalistic competence: ``She does
her homework and is very good in interviews.''
   The panel focused on former CNN vice president and anchorwoman
Williams' on-air presence rather than her abilities.
   ``She's skilled in live situations and she's very comfortable on
the air,'' Matusow said. ``As good an ad-libber as Sawyer, and very
brainy,'' Edwards said.
   Sawyer and Chung reportedly are making $1.6 million each, and
Williams and Shriver are taking in $500,000 each.

   The NFL has decided not to muffle the
Ickey Shuffle.
   The football league on Monday clarified its position on the
touchdown celebration dance made famous by Cincinnati Bengals'
fullback Ickey Woods. The league said the dance was not prohibited
under league rules governing taunting on and off the field.
   ``That brightens my day,'' Woods said Monday after practice.
   Woods traditionally performs the shuffle on the sidelines.
   On Thursday, the Bengals were informed that the Ickey Shuffle
would be banned under a new rules provision adopted in March during
a meeting of the team owners of the National Football League.
   But the NFL, upon further investigation, decided that
celebrations along the bench area were not considered off-field
celebrations, said Joe Browne, NFL director of communications.

   Heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson paid
$300 in fines and agreed to conduct three youth clinics after
pleading guilty Tuesday to speeding.
   Appearing with boxing promoter Don King in Albany Traffic Court,
Tyson was fined $100 for a speeding incident on April 26 when he
raced his 1989 Lamborghini with another car. Police clocked Tyson
going 71 mph in a 30 mph zone.
   Judge Stephen Safranko also ordered Tyson to conduct two clinics
at the Arbor Hill Community Center within 60 days.
   For the second incident, which occurred in Albany nine days
later, Tyson was fined $200 and ordered to conduct a clinic for the
Albany Parks Department. Authorities said Tyson got that ticket
while going at an ``imprudent speed'' in a 30 mph zone while again
racing another vehicle.
   Asked by Safranko if the sentences were fair, Tyson mumbled,
``It's fair.'' Tyson had no other comment.
   Tyson, 23, paid the fines to the court clerk in cash.
   The youth clinics will include discussion sessions and could
involve boxing, said Gerard Maney, assistant corporation counsel
for the city.

   A planned debut exhibit of Hedda
Nussbaum's photographs has been canceled after a gallery received
threatening calls, New York Newsday reported Tuesday.
   Romany Kramoris, owner of the Kramoris Gallery, said callers had
threatened to damage her property if the Nussbaum exhibit was held,
according to Newsday. The exhibit was to open Aug. 19.
   The photographs were taken during Nussbaum's 18 months of
rehabilitation at Four Winds Hospital in Westchester. The dozen
black-and-white nature photos are titled ``Signs of Life.''
   Sag Harbor village police have stepped up patrols around the
shop, said Officer Evelyn Halliday.
   Nussbaum was the battered live-in companion of convicted killer
Joel Steinberg, who is serving 8 1-3 to 25 years for the beating
death of 6-year-old Lisa Steinberg. The couple illegally adopted
the girl.
   Some callers accused Kramoris of trying to cash in on the case's
notoriety, while one complained the exhibit would glorify Nussbaum,
Newsday said. Kramoris was not at the art gallery Tuesday, and a
person answering the phone there said she would be back Wednesday.

   Five Central American leaders have signed
a plan to disband the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels by December,
and President Daniel Ortega called on Washington to respect the
Contras' ``death sentence.''
   ``In this way the United States can contribute to peace in
Nicaragua and Central America,'' the Nicaraguan leader said Monday
night upon returning to Managua from a three-day summit at this
Honduran beach resort.
   The plan was a sharp rebuff to the United States.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
United States was ``generally supportive'' of the Central American
leaders' agreement. However, he said any move to disband the
Contras ``must be accepted by them voluntarily.''
   Asked how the United States would react if Honduras tried to
drive the Nicaraguan rebels from its territory, Fitzwater replied,
``It's too early and unfair to say that the game is over.''
   In Managua, opposition leaders said today the government should
meet with the rebels to discuss how to carry out the plan. They
called for continued talks with the internal opposition on the
Sandinistas' pledge to carry out democratic reforms.
   ``The next step will be very arduous,'' said Silviano Matamoros,
leader of the opposition National Conservative Party. ``The
Sandinistas are not exactly known for fulfilling their
commitments.''
   The 120-day plan, laid out in a set of three accords signed
Monday, set a 30-day deadline for a combined U.N.-Organization of
American States observer mission to organize itself and another 90
days for the Contras to demobilize.
   About 11,000 Contras and their 12,000 dependents living in
Honduras along the Nicaraguan border are to be resettled, in
Nicaragua if they want and in other nations if not. Guatemala, El
Salvador and Costa Rica volunteered to take some in, though most
would prefer to go to the United States.
   In approving the plan, the five countries ignored U.S. lobbying
to keep the Contras intact until after February elections in
Nicaragua. Central to reaching an agreement appeared to be a
Honduran decision that, after eight years, it wanted the rebels out.
   In the past, the government had denied the rebels were in the
country, then called for them to leave but allowed them to stay.
   Ortega accused the United States of trying to block the accord,
but U.S. officials and officials of other Central American nations
denied the charge.
   Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros blamed the outcome on
``political confusion in Washington.''
   ``This is a disaster for the State Department because it tried
to impose its policy too late,'' said Matamoros in an interview
with Costa Rica's Radio Impacto. Last-minute U.S. pressure ``had a
counterproductive effect,'' he added.
   The Bush administration had been lobbying to keep the Contras
active until February's scheduled elections in Nicaragua as a
guarantee of the ``democratization'' that Ortega's leftist
government has promised.
   In Mexico City, where he met with Mexican officials, U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said he could not comment
because he had not seen a text of the pact.
   Baker noted that the Esquipulas agreement, a Central American
accord signed two years ago, says any Contra demobilization must be
carried out under conditions of safety and democracy in Nicaragua
and must be voluntary.
   ``I don't think the Central American democracies would do
anything to change the terms of the agreement that they have put
forth,'' Baker said.
   If the full 120 days from Monday were used, Dec. 5 would be the
deadline for the new plan. The accords do not mention the
consequences of any delay, but deadlines in previous Central
American agreements have often been observed more in the breach.
   The Central American nations must ``find enough will to go along
with the accords'' if they are to stick, said Costa Rican President
Oscar Arias, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for initiating the
regional peace process more than two years ago.
   It was not immediately clear whether the Contras are willing to
surrender their arms, but assuming Honduras lives up to its word
the Contras would have no territory from which to operate.
   ``We have signed a death sentence for the Contras,'' said
Ortega. He called on the United States to support the accords,
cease ``aggression'' and lift its economic embargo on Nicaragua.
   The Contras have been reduced to making sporadic attacks since
last year, when the United States cut off military aid. Non-lethal
aid continues at a rate of $4.5 million a month, with the
stipulation that it can be used for disbanding and resettling the
Contras.
   ``This is a very difficult situation for the Nicaraguan people.
We have been fighting for 10 years to achieve peace and democracy
for our country and now we feel abandoned,'' Contra spokeswoman
Azucena Ferrey said in Miami.
   The Central American presidents agreed to ask the United Nations
to provide observers and verify the demobilization. Canada, West
Germany and Spain already have volunteered to send observers under
U.N. auspices.
   The accords also call for a cease-fire in the 9-year-old
Salvadoran civil war, but have no provisions for enforcement.
   The presidents had already agreed to dismantle the Nicaraguan
rebels at a summit in February in El Salvador, but a 90-day
deadline for working out the details passed without notice.
   In the meantime, Ortega set elections for Feb. 25 and obtained
an agreement with his domestic opposition that undermined the
Contras by calling for their dissolution.
   El Salvador's civil war has left 70,000 dead, according to
independent estimates, while the Nicaraguan government says the
conflict with the Contras has claimed at least 50,000 lives.

<HEAD>Division of Taxation Rules Witches Entitled To Exemptions</HEAD>

   A coven of witches has won tax exempt
status in Rhode Island as a legitimate religious group.
   ``With this ruling, we witches will definitely be able to come
out of the closet and take our place in society,'' said the coven's
high priestess, Joyce Siegrist, also known as Lady Genevieve.
   Tax Administrator R. Gary Clark said he overturned the state's
initial ruling, that the Rosegate Coven did not qualify for a sales
tax exemption, because it proved on appeal that it met the
guidelines for legitimate church groups as set out by a 1986 Rhode
Island Supreme Court ruling.
   Administrative Hearing Officer Sandra Murphy said Tuesday that
she heard about 2{ hours of testimony in May and undertook
extensive research on her own before recommending the action that
Clark took on July 28.
   ``I'm happy that anyone who is practicing a religion in earnest
is able to do so without state impediment,'' she said.
   The coven, also known as Our Lady of the Roses Wiccan Church,
has 30 to 40 members in Rhode Island and meets approximately three
times a month for rituals, said Siegrist.
   The core of the Wiccan worship is belief in a diety with male
and female attributes, whose psychic energy can be tapped. Although
the power can be used for good or ill will, witches do not use it
for destructive purposes.
   When the tax exemption was denied last fall, the division's
questions indicated tax officials were focusing on the apparent
lack of formal theology schools for training Wiccan clergy, said A.
Gregory Frazier, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney who
represented the witches in the administrative hearing in May.
   He said officials also questioned the group's willingness to
allow members to belong to other churches while claiming coven
membership.
   That argument was rebutted when the Rev. Thomas Ahlburn, senior
minister of the First Unitarian Church of Providence, testified
that his church and many Eastern religions also permit members to
belong to other faiths, Frazier said.
   Under state laws, a religion must be a nonprofit group, not set
up for the purpose of avoiding taxes. It must have a litany or
system of prayer, as well as specific doctrines and practices that
its members are expected to follow.
   Clark said the connotation of ``witches'' may have made it more
difficult for the state.
   ``If all the facts were identical and they were not called
witches but were called brothers and sisters, for example, it
probably would not have been anywhere nearly so'' controversial, he
said.
   Murphy said she didn't think the decision would set a precedent.
   ``This was very logical, very straightforward and very
unemotional,'' she said, noting the coven is empowered by the state
to officiate over marriage and burials.

   The European Community and Poland on
Tuesday signed an agreement to expand and strengthen trade and
economic cooperation in the next five years.
   Pablo Benavides, a foreign affairs official of the European
Community, traveled to Warsaw to sign a letter on an emergency food
program for the financially strapped nation, said a spokesman for
the 12-nation trading bloc.
   The spokesman, demanding anonymity, said Benavides' agenda
called for talks with Polish authorities, including Ireneusz
Sekula, deputy prime minister, and Dominik Jastrzebski, minister of
foreign economic cooperation, as well as officials of the
Solidarity trade union.
   Negotiators for the community and Poland reached agreement late
last month on the trade and economic cooperation accord, which
gives a five-year timetable for gradually lifting quotas and
tariffs on a range of industrial and farm products.
   It also calls for greater cooperation in such fields as
petrochemicals, construction, mining, energy, transportation,
tourism and telecommunications.
   The trade agreement was the third between the Common Market
trading bloc and an East European country since a thaw in relations
a little more than a year ago. Accords also have been worked out
with Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
   The letter sets out some conditions for receipt of $120 million
in free food the community will draw out of its surplus stocks and
deliver soon to Poland, which has been suffering from serious food
shortages.
   The community wants to link the food shipments to changes in the
structure of the Polish economy, such as in the inadequate system
for getting food from farms to consumers' tables.
   The idea is to allow the Poles to sell the food to consumers and
use the money for economic improvements. The Poles have accepted
the plan, and the letter calls for creating a fund that often is
used in development programs.
   President Bush and other world leaders attending an economic
summit in Paris urged emergency food shipments to Poland. They also
called on the European Community to hold a high-level conference to
come up with an economic aid plan for both Poland and Hungary.
   Western officials held their first meeting on the aid plan last
week. Other discussions were expected to be scheduled in the fall.

<HEAD>Race To Replace Wright Could Be Toss-Up</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats had a 34-year lock on the
congressional seat held by deposed House Speaker Jim Wright, but
Saturday's special election could spell Republican.
   ``It's a race that we shouldn't lose, but we could lose,'' said
Texas Democratic Party Chairman Bob Slagle.
   Both parties call the election a toss-up. A poll published
Sunday showed the leading Republican had 16 percent, the leading
Democrat had 15 percent, with 64 percent not sure.
   Sissy Day, a Democratic political consultant and a former Wright
aide, said Democrats, angry and disillusioned about Wright's
resignation during an ethics investigation, might not vote.
   Both Slagle and Day feel voters in the district are strong
Wright supporters, and if they can't vote for Wright, they don't
want to bother to vote.
   ``The ones that are maddest about it are really disillusioned
about it,'' Slagle said. ``And they might just say to hell with
it.''
   All the better, say Republicans, who have been inching into
Texas government and now boast U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm and Gov. Bill
Clements among their ranks. But Republicans aren't exactly
predicting victory.
   ``Clearly, we have an opportunity ... but the power of
incumbency is great,'' said Fred Meyer, state Republican Party
chairman. ``Whoever turns out their vote on election day is going
to win.''
   Texas now is represented by nine Republicans and 20 Democrats in
Congress. Four Democrats, three Republicans and a Libertarian have
filed for Wright's District 12 seat.
   The Democrats are Pete Geren, Jim Lane, George Petrovich Jr. and
Bill Turner. Laraine Bethke, Jim Hunter and Bob Lanier are the
Republicans. Robert Buckingham Jr., is the Libertarian.
   Because one candidate must get 51 percent of the vote to win, a
runoff is expected. Lanier, a physician who is host of the
nationally syndicated television show ``60 Second Housecall,'' and
Geren, a Fort Worth attorney, are considered the frontrunners, and
were the two leaders in the recent poll results. Each has his
party's endorsement, although Lane has important endorsements from
labor and police.
   Wright, who stepped down as speaker in May and later resigned
his House seat in the face of an ethics investigation that turned
up 69 instances of alleged rules violations, has not endorsed
anyone.
   The district, which includes most of Fort Worth, went for Ronald
Reagan in 1980 and 1984 and George Bush in 1988.
   But Democrats say the district's traditional blue collar,
conservative, voters who first sent Wright to Washington in 1955
will continue to support their party. They are also counting on a
backlash against the Republicans for the ouster of Wright, the
third-most powerful politician on Capitol Hill.
   Geren has been blasting Georgia Republican U.S. Rep. Newt
Gingrich ``and his Washington gang,'' as the group responsible for
Wright's political demise. Gingrich initiated the probe against
Wright.
   But Steve Hollern, the Tarrant County GOP party leader has said,
``It was the Democrats who threw Jim Wright out of Congress. If
they had been willing to put their neck on the line to save him,
they could have kept him, but the Democratic Congress was not
willing to do that.''
   Lane, considered a distant second as a Democratic contender in
the race, calls himself a ``Jim Wright Democrat,'' and is appearing
with Wright's son on campaign stops.
   Petrovich is putting up billboards with the slogan ``To Protect
Us,'' aimed at a city that fears losing everything it gained under
Wright's considerable influence.
   Republican Chairman Meyer played down the possible effects of
Wright's resignation on Republican candidates.
   ``People are going to vote for the candidate that will represent
them the best in the future,'' Meyer said. ``The rest is history.''
   On the other hand, Republican Lanier has said in the campaign:
``If anyone did a good job, Jim Wright did ... We should all strive
to emulate him.''

   A hunter mauled and chewed by a wounded black bear managed to
walk out of a forest and drive to a town for help, and a man who
waded a river to safety after being attacked by a grizzly bear
asked rescuers if his ears were still on.
   ``I could just hear his teeth grinding against my skull,'' Steve
Nordness, 39, said at Everett General Hospital in Washington state.
He was released Sunday after being treated for wounds on his head,
hands and buttocks that required more than 100 stitches.
   In Alaska, Donald Covertson, 32, was in stable condition Tuesday
at Fairbanks Memorial Hospital with 1,000 stitches piecing together
his ripped scalp, face, neck and ankle. He underwent more than nine
hours of surgery.
   Both men were attacked Saturday.
   Covertson's family said he was attacked by a grizzly on his way
out from checking on land he owns and was not armed. He told a
paramedic that he did not hear the bear before it grabbed him.
   ``The bear had his head in its mouth and shook him,'' said Marge
Nord of the Cantwell Volunteer Ambulance. ``It left and came back
and shook him again. ... He said he could hear the bones
crunching.''
   Covertson, of Palmer, waded the icy, swift Chulitna River and
fought his way through woods to the Parks Highway between Anchorage
and Fairbanks. He collapsed in view of passing motorists, Steven
and Betty Ballek of North Pole, who took him to a gas station for
help.
   ``He asked them whether his ears were still on,'' said the
Balleks' daughter-in-law, Nena Ballek. They were still attached.
   Gordon Waterman, who helps operate the station, said Covertson
was conscious and coherent. He said the bear opened up Covertson's
scalp above his left eye and tore it around the back of his head,
in addition to several puncture wounds.
   ``I don't know how the guy made it, except he had to be in
exceptionally good condition and have exceptional intestinal
fortitude,'' Waterman said.
   Nordness, of Clearview, Wash., said he shot a black bear in the
Beckler River Valley near Skykomish, but the animal, which he
estimated at 400 pounds, ran off into trees and thick brush. The
state's bear season opened Aug. 1.
   Nordness, who was alone, went to a nearby campground to get help
before going after the wounded animal. A young man he remembered
only as Kelly agreed to go with him.
   About an hour later, Nordness, carrying a .30-06 caliber rifle,
spotted the bear charging only a few feet to his left. He fired
point-blank into the bear's chest, but it kept coming and knocked
him down.
   ``Oh God, make him stop, make him stop,'' Nordness said he
thought as the bear stood on his back, tearing into him.
   Then Kelly ran up, scaring the bear off. Despite his wounds,
Nordness walked with Kelly a quarter-mile to his car and drove
himself to Skykomish for help.
   ``I wish I could find the bear that got me. I'd like to have
that carcass for a rug,'' he said.
   ``It could be dead or it could be alive,'' said William Sarvey
of the state Department of Wildlife. He said hunters with dogs were
not immediately able to find the bear.
   Campers were notified of the wounded animal and some decided to
leave, Sarvey said. ``With the high brush, it would be foolish just
to walk in there,'' he said.

<HEAD>Minor Parties Say They'll Consider Walesa Offer to Join Coalition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two parties linked to the ruling
communists since the 1940s said Tuesday they will consider an
invitation from Solidarity leader Lech Walesa to join a coalition
government that would exclude the Communist Party.
   But communist leaders, in their first comment on the Walesa
proposal, said it could lead to destabilizing the country.
   Walesa, taking the political offensive Monday four days after
the election of a communist premier, expressed opposition to any
government formed by Prime Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak and said it
would extend the party's 45-year monopoly on power.
   Instead, Walesa said, he would work for a coalition of
Solidarity, the Democratic Party and the Peasant Party, putting the
Communist Party in the position of becoming a parliamentary
opposition.
   In separate statements Tuesday, the United Peasant Party and the
Democratic Party said their leaders would take the proposal under
advisement.
   The communist Politburo, discussing the offer at its weekly
meeting Tuesday, sharply criticized the proposal, according to
state TV.
   Politburo members said it was aimed at breaking the traditional
links between the communists and the Peasant and Democratic
parties, and could undo the agreements reached between authorities
and the opposition at talks in April, an announcer said on the main
evening news program.
   ``It's another impediment by the opposition,'' according to the
report of the Politburo discussion.
   ``The initiative showed by Lech Walesa creates the danger of
opening up a government crisis, which certainly does not serve the
stabilization of the situation in this country.''
   Politburo members also ``pointed out that it complicates the
quick formation'' of a government ``which the country needs so
badly,'' state TV said.
   Walesa press aides in Gdansk said behind-the-scenes negotiations
on forming a joint government have been going on since Thursday
between Solidarity lawmakers and members of the Peasant and
Democratic parties.
   The statement was an apparent rebuttal to Peasant Party leader
Roman Malinowski, who Monday had criticized Walesa as publicizing
his coalition proposal before presenting it to the involved parties.
   Kiszczak, candidate of the communist Polish United Workers
Party, was elected Aug. 3 by the Sejm, or parliament, to form the
next government. Members of the Democratic and Peasant parties
added their votes to the communists' to give him a 237-173 majority.
   Kiszczak, a general who was interior minister for eight years,
said it would take up to two weeks to assemble a Cabinet, which
must be approved by the Sejm.
   Walesa's proposal appears to have opened the road to an
alternative scenario.
   ``The proposal put forward by ... Walesa requires serious
examination and decisions by appropriate statutory bodies of the
Democratic Party. It will be taken into account if the good of the
national and the state requires this,'' the Democratic Party said
in a statement carried on the official PAP news agency.
   The statement, issued by party spokeswoman Elzbieta Otffinowska,
mildly criticized Walesa's offer, saying: ``It is a pity that the
proposal was not presented earlier.''
   The proposal will be taken up Wednesday at a meeting of the
party leadership and its 27 parliament deputies, it said.
   The Peasant Party said in a statement that it has stressed
``numerous times that only a grand coalition government can be an
effective government, gain social credibility and carry the burden
of leading the country out of the deep economic crisis.''
   The phrase ``grand coalition'' has come to mean a coalition of
Solidarity with the communists, something that Walesa has rejected.
   But the Peasant Party's statement said, ``Lech Walesa's
statement published in the mass media shall be considered by the
(party) presidium.''
   There has been no public response by Kiszczak or the Communist
Party so far to the Walesa proposition.
   Kiszczak has been rebuffed so far in trying to enlist Solidarity
members in his Cabinet, and there is fear among authorities that a
government formed with no Solidarity representation will lack
public support.
   The concern has grown because of sharp increases in food prices
last week and a series of wage disputes, mainly involving rail, bus
and postal workers.
   ``Prospects are uncertain for creating a government capable,
through its political and social influence, of effectively
counteracting the dissolution of the economy,'' said a commentary
Monday in the communist daily Trybuna Ludu.
   ``Neither a government only of Solidarity or only of the party
and the ruling coalition will fulful this requirement,'' it said.
   As a result of partially democratic elections in June, the
communists hold 173 seats in the 460-member Sejm, Solidarity 161,
the Peasants 76, the Democrats 27 and the remainder are held by
pro-communist Christian organizations. A 231-vote majority is
needed to form a government.
   The Peasant and Democratic parties used to be rubber stamps for
the Communist Party. In the changing political environment in
Poland, in which all parties expect to compete in four years in
promised fully free elections, the allied parties have started to
demonstrate greater independence.

<HEAD>Colleges Cut Intake of Students from Beijing; More Students Arrested</HEAD>

   Colleges nationwide are cutting the number of
high school graduates they will accept from Beijing, an official
newspaper said Tuesday in a report on another apparent effort to
prevent more student arrest.
   Also on Tuesday, more reports of arrests from the spring student
pro-democracy protests trickled into the capital.
   A report in the Hebei Daily said seven Beijing student leaders
and other alleged counterrevolutionaries were arrested last month
in Hebei. The province surrounds Beijing and many students fled
there after the military crackdown to crush their pro-democracy
movement.
   The China Daily said colleges have cut by 1,148 the number of
high school graduates they will accept from Beijing.
   It quoted Li Huangguo, deputy chief of Beijing's Higher
Education Bureau, as saying colleges had adjusted their admissions
to compensate for over-enrollment in some majors.
   Students do not select their majors, but are assigned to
departments regardless of personal preference. A more likely
explanation is that out-of-town colleges fear students from Beijing
may cause political unrest on their campuses.
   Many Beijing middle school students joined in the protests led
by college students that were crushed by the army June 3-4.
   The government already has said that the college freshman class
nationwide will be cut by 30,000 students, to 610,000. Beijing
colleges that led the student movement will have their freshman
classes cut in half or more in a move that school officials say is
a result of the protests.
   The China Daily also said admission of new students will take
place 24 days later than usual, in early October. All students
except freshmen are scheduled to return to most Beijing schools in
mid- or late August for several weeks of political education and to
finish classwork from the spring term, which was cut short by the
protests.
   The Hebei Daily carried the arrest report July 12, but it only
was seen in Beijing today.
   It identified those arrested as leaders of independent student
unions that organized the protests. Also detained, it said, were
two leaders of worker and citizen support groups, five people
accused of attacking soldiers who put down the protests and an
unspecified number of other protesters.
   Nearly 2,100 arrests have been reported nationwide, but most
such reports stopped in mid-July and thousands more people are
believed to have been arrested secretly.

<TEXT>
   An undercover police officer watched a group of
men rape a suspected prostitute but did not interfere because he
did not want to blow his cover, according to newspaper reports.
   Officer Tomas Echartea from the rural town of Groesbeck, who was
working on an undercover drug investigation for police in suburban
University Park, told reporters he pretended to be sick to avoid
participating in the attack by men he was investigating.
   ``You don't want to ruin your credibility'' with suspects, he
told The Dallas Morning News. ``If it had been a life-threatening
situation, I'd have blown my cover. I'd've had to. You just can't
let someone be killed.''
   Dallas police said they were unaware of the incident but would
investigate to find the woman to determine if she wants to press
charges.
   Detectives will also ask Echartea to give them a full account,
Deputy Chief Ray Hawkins said.
   ``I think he had some obligation as one human being to another
to help her as best he could,'' Hawkins said. ``All women, even
prostitutes, have a right not to be raped.''
   Echartea said the incident occurred in June while he was working
on a two-month investigation. The operation ended with the arrests
of four University Park employees on charges of selling drugs.
   In Groesbeck, a small town town about 60 miles south of Dallas,
Police Chief Chuck Walker defended Echartea's actions, saying he
could not have intervened without risking his life and the
investigation.
   ``He can't put himself in a life-threatening situation,'' Walker
said. ``If it were a life-threatening situation, his cover would
have been immaterial then.''
   Dallas County District Attorney John Vance said he did not know
if state law requires Texas officers to intervene in felonies they
observe. ``I think it would be good if he did, but I don't believe
the law requires it of him,'' Vance said.
   Dallas police spokesman Ed Spencer said the department does not
have a written policy requiring undercover officers to try to stop
felonies.

   Students enrolled in certain high school English
classes got credit for never picking up a book except to deliver or
store it, according to a teacher who blew the whistle Tuesday.
   The Daily News reported that ``ghost classes'' at Adlai E.
Stevenson High School in the borough of the Bronx had titles such
as ``Literature and Art,'' but consisted mainly of students running
errands for teachers.
   ``There was no classroom to go to,'' Jim Fairclough, a teacher
for 18 years, told News columnist Bob Herbert. ``The kids were used
as gofers.''
   Board of Education spokesman Frank Sobrino acknowledged Tuesday
that allegations of ghost classes at Stevenson were under
investigation and that Inspector General Michael Sofarelli had
completed a draft report.
   Until it has been reviewed by the board, he said, ``we're just
not going to be making any comment.''
   Herbert quoted from an affidavit that was part of the evidence
compiled by Sofarelli, in which a 1988 Stevenson graduate said she
took the ``Literature and Art'' honors course as a senior.
   ``This course consisted of delivering books to English teachers
and storing books in the book room. I also opened up the computer
room and delivered lessons to the substitute teachers. And
sometimes I delivered messages to the teachers themselves,'' she
said.
   The student, now in college, received a score of 90 for her work
in the course.
   Neill Rosenfeld, a teachers' union spokesman, said the
``Literature and Art'' class, intended to be an independent study
course, was eliminated last October after the United Federation of
Teachers filed a grievance.
   He said he did not know if the administration or individual
teachers were to blame for the abuses.
   UFT President Sandra Feldman said in a statement that the union
had been trying to stamp out phantom classes at Stevenson for years.
   The News said there were similarly phony classes for students
who needed remedial English.
   ``One of the transcripts shows that a kid who was a couple of
years behind in his reading got a 90 in both the reading tutor
class and the advanced Literature and Art class,'' Fairclough said.
``Why would a kid who was behind in his reading be in an advanced
literature class?''
   The school is holding summer school classes now and none of the
regular staff, including principal Michael Weber, will be back
until late August, school officials said.

   The Federal Communications Commission has
asked the Justice Department to investigate a New York professor
alleged to have applied for more than 100 broadcast licenses using
false names or forgeries.
   Outgoing FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick sent a letter last week
to the department asking for an investigation of Bernard Boozer, of
Central Square, N.Y., a professor at State University of New York
at Oswego.
   After a yearlong investigation, the FCC decided that Boozer may
have violated both commission regulations and federal law.
   ``It appears that on numerous occasions, Bernard Boozer signed
the names of attorneys and other persons without their knowledge,''
Patrick said in the letter, to Assistant Attorney General Edward
S.G. Dennis Jr.
   ``Accordingly, I am hereby referring to the Department of
Justice the report of the commission's investigation for
consideration of whether criminal prosecution of the responsible
individual or individuals is warranted.''
   Patrick, who was appointed by then-President Reagan in February
1987, left office Monday. His letter to Dennis was dated Aug. 4.
   Boozer could not be reached for comment Tuesday. There was no
telephone number listed under his name in Central Square.
   Michele Reed, a spokeswoman for Oswego State, said Boozer is an
assistant professor of health and physical education, and used to
be the school's basketball coach. He has been on sabbatical since
last September, she said, adding that she did not know where he was
or when he is slated to return.
   Reed said she had no comment on the allegations.
   Boozer first applied for a license for an FM radio station in
Ilion, N.Y., but was found in 1985 to be unqualified, according to
FCC spokeswoman Patricia Chew.
   He is accused of then beginning a series of false applications
for television and radio station construction permits that swamped
the FCC. The commission launched a formal investigation into
Boozer's actions Aug. 4, 1988.
   According to the Syracuse (N.Y.) Post-Standard, competing
applicants have agreed to pay Boozer and others about $130,000 in
out-of-court settlements to avoid expensive legal battles over
applications.

   Sen. Jesse Helms, trying to bolster his
campaign against the use of federal money for offensive art, has
sent fellow lawmakers four photographs that he considers obscene.
   ``I suggest you take a look at the enclosed materials,'' Helms
said in the one-paragraph letter accompanying photographs from a
current art exhibit in Washington. ``It's your call as to whether
the taxpayers' money should be used to fund this sort of thing.''
   The photos were taken by the late Robert Mapplethorpe, whose
work is on display at the Washington Project for the Arts, which
decided to show the exhibition after it was canceled by the
Corcoran Gallery of Art.
   The Corcoran wanted to avoid becoming involved in a political
battle over congressional financing of the National Endowment for
the Arts. The NEA provided one of the grants to underwrite a
national tour of ``Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment,'' which
included homoerotic and sadomasochistic pictures.
   The photographs mailed by Helms, from the Mapplethorpe exhibit,
include ``Man in a Polyester Suit, 1980'' and ``Mark Stevens, Mr.
10 1@2, 1976,'' which both show male genitals, one of a young girl
who is partially exposed and one of a young boy standing naked on a
chair.
   The direct object of Helms' wrath is the National Endowment,
which provided $30,000 to underwrite part of the Mapplethorpe
exhibition and tour.
   The Senate recently approved a Helms amendment that bans using
federal funds for material that is considered ``obscene or
indecent'' or ``denigrates, debases or reviles'' beliefs or people
on the basis of religion, race, creed, sex, handicap, age or
national origin.
   Members of the House and Senate Appropriations subcommittees on
the interior will meet in September on the $170 million NEA budget.
In advance of that conference, Helms sent the photographs and
letter.
   A random check with congressional staff found that although the
Washington offices had received the letter and photographs from
Helms, most of the senators and members of the House had not seen
them.
   The letter was marked ``for member's eyes only,'' and during the
monthlong August recess many lawmakers are in their home states.
Although personal and urgent mail is forwarded to members, most
congressional aides said the Helms package would likely remain on
their bosses' desks until they return.
   Helms' recent actions are not new. In April 1988, the North
Carolina senator introduced an amendment to the AIDS research and
education bill renewing an expiring 1987 ban on federal money for
educational materials that promote or encourage homosexual activity.
   Helms' amendment was prompted by a gay-oriented AIDS education
videotape that he screened for several senators.
   ``There's something wrong when federal tax dollars are used for
this garbage,'' Helms said at the time.
   The amendment passed 94-2, but later senators approved a measure
saying that nothing in the bill should prevent dissemination of
accurate information to people at risk. The later amendment
effectively superseded the Helms' measure.

   U.N. envoy Marrack Goulding appealed
Tuesday for Israel to free the Lebanese Shiite cleric it abducted,
but Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin rejected his release except as
part of a prisoner exchange.
   In separate news conferences following an hour-long meeting in
Rabin's office, Rabin and Goulding disagreed sharply over the
wisdom of the abuction of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid from his south
Lebanon home on July 28.
   ``I have to say that the kidnapping of Sheik Obeid does not
help,'' said Goulding, who reiterated U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar's earlier pleas that Israel free the clergyman.
   Rabin said that Obeid would be held until Israel was able to
swap him for 16 foreign hostages and three Israeli soldiers
captured in Lebanon in 1986.
   ``We believe that after three and a half years ... of trying to
bring about an exchange that failed, we had to have assets that
will convince them (Shiites) to bring about an exchange and
hopefully end the phenomenon of keeping hostage Israelis and
non-Israelis,'' Rabin said.
   Rabin said Israel has received no response through the
International Committee of the Red Cross to its offer to swap Obeid
for the missing Israeli soldiers and foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   He added: ``I will not relate myself to whatever comes on the
media in the name of fake names of Shiite organizations in
Lebanon.''
   Israel's swap offer has been rejected in statements issued in
Lebanon in the name of Hezbollah, or Party of God, militia and
various factions of the group.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Tuesday described Israel's
efforts to retrieve its missing soldiers as a national ``moral
commandment.''
   He told a graduation ceremony for army officers at the National
Defense College that Israel was committed ``to do everything
possible in order to bring back the soldiers imprisoned by the
bands of enemies.''
   Goulding is on the final part of a week-long tour of the region,
which also took him to Syria and Lebanon for talks with political
and militia leaders. He was sent to try to determine the fate of
U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins.
   Higgins was serving with the U.N. observer force in southern
Lebanon when he was kidnapped in February 1988. The
Hezbollah-affiliated faction holding Higgins released a videotape
July 31 purporting to show him hanged.
   The FBI said Monday it believes the body shown in the tape was
Higgins but that there can be no positive identification without
physical evidence. It offered no information about the time or
cause of death.
   Rabin told Goulding that Israel believed Higgins died last year
as a result of mistreatment, according to sources who demanded
anonymity.
   Goulding said that in his talks in Lebanon, ``I was unable to
establish exactly when he died. Opinions differ about that.''
   Asked if he was satisfied with findings showing Higgins was
dead, Goulding said, ``I have seen the findings of the FBI, who
have professional forensic scientists who examined the evidence and
reached that conclusion.''
   Goulding declined comment when asked if he had relayed a message
from Hezbollah spiritual leader Sheik Hussein Mohammed Fadlallah in
Beirut.
   After an earlier meeting with U.S. Ambassador William Brown,
Goulding was asked about reports in the Jerusalem Post that another
American hostage in Lebanon, Joseph Cicippio, might be released
soon as a ``goodwill gesture.'' Goulding said he had no information
that this was the case.
   Cicippio, who was threatened with death until the U.S.
intervened with an international diplomatic offensive, worked at
the American University of Beirut. He has been a captive since
Sept. 12, 1986.
   Goulding said he would meet with the U.N. secretary-general
Wednesday to report on his trip.
   Rabin said Tuesday's meeting took place at Goulding's request
and that he had given the U.N. official what information Israel had
on Higgins.
   He said he also described Israel's ``moral and practical
commitment'' to bringing home soldiers missing in action.
   ``We would like to turn our achievement _ having Sheik Obeid in
our hands _ to an end of the hostage episode for Israelis and
Westerners.
   Rabin said the next step in the process should be receiving a
report on the health of the three missing Israeli servicemen. They
are soldiers Yossi Fink and Rahamin Alsheikh, captured Feb. 17,
1986, in Israel's ``security zone'' in southern Lebanon, and Ron
Arad, a navigator whose plane went down over southern Lebanon on
Oct. 16, 1986.

<HEAD>Labor Decides to Stay in Cabinet, Adopts Land for Peace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>

   The governing body of the left-leaning
Labor Party on Tuesday decided to stay in Israel's ruling coalition
and adopted the principle of trading land for peace to guide peace
talks with Palestinians.
   The massive show of hands that concluded the meeting of the
party's 1,350-member Central Committee put an end to the government
crisis that erupted July 5 over hard-line conditions for peace
talks adopted by the rival right-wing Likud bloc.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's party decided on that day the
government's program for Palestinian elections in the occupied
territories could only be implemented on condition the 20-month
Palestinian uprising ends.
   The plan calls for negotiating an interim self-rule period with
elected representatives of the 1.7 million Palestinians in the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip.
   Likud also demanded continuation of Jewish settlement in the
occupied territories and said no land would be traded for peace. It
said 140,000 Arabs living in the annexed east Jerusalem would not
be allowed to vote, Likud decided.
   On July 10, Labor's leadership bureau voted in favor of leaving
the government. But on July 23, the Cabinet reaffirmed the Israeli
peace plan without the Likud-adopted principles, turning Tuesday's
pre-scheduled Labor meeting into a largely ceremonial event.
   Labor leader and Finance Minister Shimon Peres, however, told
the delegates the party would leave the governing coalition if the
peace process stops.
   ``I'm convinced that we are taking the right path to stay in the
government as long as the peace process continues and to leave it
if it ends,'' Peres said.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, an architect of the peace
initiative, said it was important to prove to the Palestinians the
Labor Party ``is not accepting silently'' Likud's conditions.
   But others, known as Labor doves, opposed the decision, urging
the hawks such as Rabin to reconsider it.
   ``The only thing (Labor) is doing is being a moderate mask for
the government,'' said legislator Chaim Ramon.
   In what appeared to be a compromise between the Labor hawks and
doves and a move to counter the Likud ``principles,'' the party
adopted 12 points to guide the peace process, including willingness
to trade territory for peace.
   The guiding points also said Israel will not annex the lands it
has occupied since the 1967 Middle East war but would not agree to
the establishment of a Palestinian state there either.
   ``We do not want to annex the territories. That would mean to
live with perpetual uprising, who knows for how many generations,''
Peres said.
   The Labor plan said east Jerusalem Arabs would be allowed to
vote, but outside Jerusalem, and stressed that Jerusalem would stay
``undivided and united under Israeli sovereignty.''
   Another point called for suspension of Jewish settlements once
talks aimed at elections start and said the issue would become part
of subsequent negotiations.
   Responding to another Likud demand, Labor said elections should
start ``without preconditions.'' Negotiations for elections would
run parallel with efforts to quell the uprising, which has claimed
at least 530 Palestinian and 38 Israeli lives.
   Labor also appeared to open a door for some PLO participation by
saying that ``Palestinians from outside'' can participate in the
talks on the final status of the occupied lands on condition their
candidacy is agreed upon by Israel, Egypt and local Palestinians.
   Other Labor points seemed aimed at answering some PLO demands.
They guaranteed free and democratic elections monitored by foreign
observers and said that after the balloting, Palestinians would
receive political rights.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization has rejected the Israeli
program, saying free elections were impossible under occupation and
demanding that elections lead to an independent Palestinian state
with Jerusalem as its capital.

   Here is a transcript of the statement
delivered at the Pentagon on Tuesday by Marine Maj. Robin Higgins,
wife of Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, believed executed by
terrorists in Lebanon:
   Yesterday afternoon the commandant of the Marine Corps, General
Gray, advised me of the virtual certainty that my husband, Colonel
Rich Higgins, is dead. Shortly thereafter, I received a telephone
call from the president, who graciously offered his support and his
sympathy.
   Rich went to Lebanon in the service of the United Nations
because he believed he could be useful, that he could help and that
he was needed. He always needed to fulfill a destiny, a need based
on a profound sense of duty. He wrote in his high school year book
his goal was to ``Always make my family proud of me.'' He suceeded.
   Those of us who have known Rich Higgins count ourselves lucky.
He taught us how to love and enjoy life. He taught us tolerance for
those whose ideas differed from ours. He taught us that words such
as honor, reputation, integrity and fidelity have real meaning.
   To those who would suggest that our concern for Rich should
somehow be mitigated because he was in a dangerous business or
because his act of volunteering was supposedly foolish, Rich
himself would have the appropriate reply, ``When you're out front,
people will shoot at you.''
   Now is not the time for anger or bitterness, for recriminations
and blame. Now is the time for calm reflection, for kind thoughts
of the man who brought us togther. Now is the time to tell Rich
Higgins that we love him and we miss him.
   Rich would be proud of the fact that our commandant had the
courage and the decency to inform me personally of the sad news. He
has been a pillar of support from the beginning. I am also mindful
of the fact that our president has agonized in a very profound and
personal manner over my husband's fate. He has my prayers and my
support as he tries to save the living and end the suffering.
   Thank you.

   A man pleaded innocent Tuesday to charges he
set fire to his pregnant 17-year-old daughter, who delivered a
healthy baby hours later despite having burns over most of her body.
   Joseph Richmond, 41, was indicted by a Summit County grand jury
last week on charges of felonious assault, child endangering and
aggravated arson. He remained in the county jail Tuesday in lieu of
a $10,000 cash bond.
   A pretrial hearing was scheduled Aug. 15.
   His attorney, Charles Houston, will not comment on pending
cases, a secretary in his office said. George Pappas, assistant
county prosecutor, did not return a telephone call Tuesday
afternoon.
   Richmond is accused of dousing his daughter with brake fluid
during an argument July 24 and then throwing a lighted match at
her. He told police he was only joking or trying to scare her.
   Witnesses told police the father and daughter had argued over
whether she should be allowed to go out with friends. Authorities
said Kimberly Richmond is single and lives with her parents.
   Ms. Richmond remained in serious condition in the regional burn
unit at Children's Hospital Medical Center of Akron. Her baby, born
a month prematurely, is in good condition, the hospital said.
   Doctors said Ms. Richmond has third-degree burns over 70 percent
of her body. Last week, she regained consciousness and was taken
off a respirator, said hospital spokeswoman Carol Wallace.

   The county supervisors have voted not
to replace courthouse water fountains labeled ``colored'' and
``white,'' but to give them a historical plaque.
   The decision Monday by the Jones County board of supervisors
rejected an offer by the state Department of Archives and History
to move the fountains to the state history museum in Jackson and
build replicas that would not remind visitors of past segregation
laws.
   ``The NAACP is not satisfied with the decision that the board of
supervisors made. It was just a sign to let the whole state of
Mississippi know that racism is alive in Laurel and Jones County,''
said Manuel Jones, president of the Laurel-Jones County branch of
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   ``It is a very strong possibility that we will be out marching
at the Ellisville Courthouse this week or the first of next week. I
am prepared to wear out three pairs of shoes,'' he said Tuesday.
   Under pressure from the NAACP, county officials in April daubed
plaster over the labels. But rain quickly rinsed the plaster away.
Vandals also sprayed the white fountain with black paint.
   County Supervisor Jerome Wyatt, the only black member of the
board, was the lone voice Monday for accepting the state's offer.
   ``This situation has apparently reached an unappropriate level
of racial overtones. It is the wording that makes the difference on
the fountains,'' Wyatt said.
   County Supervisor Calvin Holifield proposed instead that the
fountains be cleaned of the plaster and marked by a plaque
explaining their historical significance.
   The motion passed with only Wyatt objecting and County
Supervisor Thurmond Dykes abstaining.
   ``I don't think this is going to solve it,'' Dykes said.
   The state Department of Archives and History must approve any
alterations to the fountains because the 82-year-old courthouse is
a state historic landmark.

   A man held in jail for a year and two days
without a trial or hearing says he found the time enlightening.
   Clifford Bashlor, 54, was freed Monday when Wayne County Jail
officials learned of his illegal detention because jail personnel
raised questions about his long stay.
   Bashlor's jail time violated state laws requiring arraignment
within three days and trial within 180 days of arrest. District
Court Judge Daphne Means Curtis dismissed two misdemeanor charges
and released him.
   ``It appears there was some kind of breakdown in
communications,'' sheriff's spokeswoman Nancy Mouradian said. Ivie
Shelton, named Bashlor's lawyer, said his client ``just plain got
overlooked.''
   Bashlor said he had no plans to sue.
   ``I have no grudges against anybody,'' he said. ``They treated
me all right. I had a cell to myself and I read a lot.
   ``You know, some people say that everyone should spend a year in
jail. It takes about a year to really get a kind of enlightenment.''
   Bashlor was arrested Aug. 5, 1988, on misdemeanor warrants for
assault and trespass. He was arraigned in 36th District Court and
taken to the jail, but due to a mixup wasn't returned to court for
a scheduled pretrial appearance.
   The court thought he had jumped bond and issued an arrest
warrant. With no further hearings scheduled, the jail had no court
order to remove him from his cell. Without a court appearance, no
lawyer was appointed.
   Bashlor spent 367 days in the jail, never tried or convicted of
charges that would have carried a maximum penalty of 90 days.
   ``I tried to tell them I shouldn't be there, but that doesn't
really work in jail,'' he said.

   Iran would be willing to help free
American hostages if Washington released $2 billion in frozen
Iranian assets, a Tehran newspaper said Tuesday. Lebanese news
reports said Syria might try to help gain the release of the
captives.
   Hezbollah, the Iranian-sponsored group thought to be an umbrella
for hostage holders, said it would not trade three captured Israeli
soldiers for a kidnapped Shiite cleric Israel has refused to free
on other terms.
   In Tel Aviv, U.N. envoy Marrack Goulding appealed to Israel to
release the 33-year-old cleric, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, but
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin refused.
   Israeli commandos kidnapped Obeid, who is affiliated with
Hezbollah, from his home in southern Lebanon on July 28. Israel has
offered to exchange Obeid and Shiite prisoners it holds, estimated
at about 400, for the three soldiers and the 16 Western hostages in
Lebanon, eight of whom are Americans.
   Sheik Sobhi Tofaili, a senior Hezbollah leader, said in a
statement distributed Tuesday in Beirut: ``There shall be no
contacts and no negotiations as long as Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid
remains in captivity.
   ``This is the party's unshakeable conviction and this is what we
shall do. Hezbollah is not concerned with the question of the
hostages or the negotiations revolving around it.''
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, has insisted Obeid be freed without
conditions.
   The Tehran Times quoted a source close to President Hashemi
Rafsanjani as saying: ``The first step should be taken by the
United States, and if Tehran gets satisified that its assets will
certainly be unfrozen, then the second step will definitely come
from Iran.''
   In the newspaper report, carried by the official Islamic
Republic News Agency, the source said Iran's influence in Lebanon
was limited and there was no guarantee the hostages would be
released.
   The Iranian assets, including arms purchased by the late Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi but not delivered, were frozen when
Washington broke relations with Tehran over the seizure of the U.S.
Embassy in 1979, after the shah was overthrown. Some of the
Americans in the embassy were held hostage for 444 days.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said:
``There are a lot of ideas being floated, a lot of exchanges being
made. ... We see ideas coming out from Iran, from Syria, Algeria,
Israel, the United States, everybody.''
   Goulding repeated pleas by U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar that Israel free the Shiite cleric, and told reporters
after meeting Rabin: ``I have to say that the kidnapping of Sheik
Obeid does not help.''
   Rabin said at another news conference: ``We believe that after
3{ years ... of trying to bring about an exchange (for the
soldiers) we had to have assets ... to bring about an exchange and
hopefully end the phenomenon of keeping hostage Israelis and
non-Israelis.''
   Hezbollah's spiritual adviser, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,
said in a statement published by several Beirut newspapers Tuesday
that the abduction of Obeid left ``the region poised on a powder
keg.''
   ``That act of piracy led to the killing of American officer
Higgins,'' said Fadlallah, referring to the announcement by the
captors of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins that they hanged him July 31
in retaliation.
   A poor-quality videotapepe the kidnappers released showed the
body of a man that appeared to be the U.S. Marine hanging from a
gallows.
   Mrs. Higgins said Tuesday in Washington she considered her
husband dead, and offered President Bush her support as he ``tries
to save the living and end the suffering.''
   Robin Higgins, a Marine Corps major, said the time had come to
tell her husband ``we love him and miss him.''
   The FBI said Monday it believed the man on the gallows was
Higgins, but that when or and how he died could not be determined.
There have been reports that Higgins, who was on U.N. duty when he
was seized in February 1988, was killed months ago.
   Fadlallah said Israel's refusal to free Obeid, and U.S. naval
movements in the eastern Mediterranean, reminded him of tension
that preceded Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982.
   ``I do not rule out the possibility of a large-scale military
operation by Israel to get itself off the hook in this crisis which
it created,'' he declared.
   An-Nahar, an independent Beirut newspaper, said Tuesday there
were indications Syria and Iran would ``coordinate and intensify
efforts to resolve the hostage issue and defuse the crisis it
generated.''
   ``This is expected to take its final shape when Iranian Foreign
Minister Ali Akbar Velayati arrives in Syria soon for talks with
President Hafez Assad's government,'' said a dispatch from its
Damascus correspondent.
   Syria supported Iran during its 8-year war with Iraq, in which a
truce was reached in August 1988, but their interests in Lebanon
sometimes conflict. Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon and is the
country's main power broker.
   An-Nahar said Syria was among the countries President Bush asked
to intervene after kidnappers holding American hostage Joseph
Cicippio threatened to kill him, ``but Syria rejected the contents
of the (Bush) letter because they did not conform with the role it
had played, and is playing now, to secure the release of hostages.''
   ``This prompted Washington to send a flexible explanation of the
letter to Syrian officials after a major crisis was about to arise
between the two countries over the letter's contents,'' it said.
   Cicippio's kidnappers, who call themselves the Revolutionary
Justice Organization, said Thursday they had suspended the death
sentence against him. He was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986.
   The hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>U.N. Mission Inspects Major Evacuation Route</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A United Nations team studying the
feasibility of forming a body to monitor Vietnam's troop pullout
from Cambodia traveled Tuesday over what is expected to be one of
the major evacuation routes.
   After its drive, the team met with officials of Vietnam's
Foreign Ministry, even though it had been widely expected to work
only in Cambodia. Team members would not give details of the talks.
   The team, sent by an international peace conference in Paris,
drove six hours over Highway No. 1 from Cambodia's capital of Phnom
Penh to Vietnam's major southern city of Ho Chi Minh, where the
talks were held.
   Vietnam claims to have made annual partial troop pullouts since
1982, and many of the departing soldiers returned home on Highway
No. 1.
   The Paris conference, which opened July 30, is trying to find a
political settlement to the war that erupted with Vietnam's
invasion of Cambodia in 1978.
   Vietnam plans to withdraw its last troops in September, leaving
the government it installed in Phnom Penh to fight a coalition of
three guerrilla groups. The Paris conference agreed that this
pullout must be internationally verified.
   The pro-Vietnamese government previously had rejected any U.N.
role in the Cambodian peace process because the world body
recognizes the guerrillas' resistance coalition as the legitimate
government.
   The 15-member U.N. team, mostly military officers, gave few
details of its mission, saying it first has to report to the U.N.
secretary general.
   Lt. Gen. Martin O. Vadset of Norway, the leader of the team,
said it met with a vice minister of defense of the
Vietnamese-installed government Monday, when it arrived in Phnom
Penh to begin its mission.
   ``We were received extremely well and had short but good
discussions,'' he told reporters, who accompanied the team on the
flight back from Ho Chi Minh City to Phnom Penh.
   ``There was no politics involved. We merely addressed the
practical aspects,'' he said.
   The team was to meet Wednesday with Hun Sen, premier of the
Phnom Penh government, and four Cabinet ministers.
   The team, from 11 countries, includes experts in communications,
aviation and other technical fields.

<HEAD>Dole Praises President Bush for Handling of Hostage Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole said
Tuesday he thinks President Bush is doing a better job than his two
predecessors of dealing with a Mideast hostage crisis.
   But the Kansas Republican also warned that if terrorists carry
out their threat to murder hostage Joseph Cicippio, the United
States will use military retaliation.
   If Cicippio is murdered, ``All bets are off,'' Dole said. ``Then
you would see a military response.''
   Dole, at a news conference, praised Bush for using intensive
diplomatic pressures from at least 12 nations in an attempt to
resolve the situation that led to the apparent murder of hostage
Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins by Muslim extremists in Lebanon.
   The president ``is using every channel,'' said Dole, who said he
was briefed last week by the CIA. Among nations applying diplomatic
pressure are Algeria, the Soviet Union, Iran and Israel, he said.
   ``I really believe there is some optimism,'' Dole said. ``I've
talked to the president about this a number of times.''
   He attributed his optimism to Bush's steady approach and the
more moderate tone adopted by Iran's new president.
   Dole earlier had criticized Israel for not notifying the United
States that it planned to abduct a Shiite Muslim cleric from his
home in South Lebanon. He didn't repeat that criticism Tuesday,
saying instead he thinks ``the Israelis are under some pressure.''

   Female companionship and winks and nods were used
by a defunct savings and loan to curry favor with regulatory
officials, a federal prosecutor said Tuesday at the fraud trial of
a president of the association.
   Officials at Vernon Savings &amp; Loan Association made thousands of
dollars in political contributions and payments for prostitutes and
then were reimbursed with phony bonus checks and false business
vouchers, said U.S Attorney Robert Hauberg.
   Haugberg said Vernon President Patrick G. King took part in the
scheme by approving expenditures of more than $55,000 from thrift
funds.
   King is charged in a 37-count indictment with conspiring to
defraud the government and misapply Vernon funds. The indictment
alleges that he used thrift money to make illegal political
contributions to several congressmen, including former House
Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and U.S. Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y.
   As opening statements began Tuesday in King's trial, his
attorney, Emmett Colvin, said King was a victim of government
prosecutors and said they had harassed witnesses into implicating
King.
   Prosecutors said they will call several Vernon officials who
already have pleaded guilty to various charges. Colvin said he will
show during the trial that Vernon owner Don R. Dixon took pain to
ensure that King did not know about the illegal payments. No
criminal charges have been filed against Dixon.
   Vernon Savings was closed by federal regulators in November
1987, with losses totaling more than $1.3 billion.
   King was deputy commissioner with the state thrift regulatory
agency before joining Vernon.
   The witnesses will describe the ``nuts and bolts and also the
winks and nods, the tacit understandings'' of the transactions,
Haugberg said.

<HEAD>Justice Department Plans for International Affairs Office</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, responding
to the increasingly international nature of crime, announced plans
Tuesday to create an Office Of International Affairs in the Justice
Department.
   ``Often more than 50 percent of my day is devoted to some matter
related to our international involvement in fighting drug
trafficking, money laundering, international organized crime and
business fraud, environmental depredations, terrorism or
espionage,'' the attorney general said in remarks prepared for
delivery in Honolulu to the American Bar Association.
   Thornburgh said he would ask permission from Congress to create
the office to coordinate the department's dealings with foreign
governments on law enforcement issues.
   The attorney general said the plan was based on dramatic
increase in international law enforcement activities since he
headed the Justice Department's criminal division in during the
Ford administration.
   ``Upon my return to the department, the biggest single change
that I noticed was the vast increase in the amount of international
activiity in which we are now engaged,'' Thornburgh said.
   The office will report directly to the attorney general.
   Thornburgh has long said he wanted to make the Justice
Department more responsive to the increasing international nature
of crime.
   ``This is an area, I believe, where we have not kept up with the
times,'' Thornburgh said.
   ``Crime is no longer limited by the distance one pony can cover
in a day's time, and a businessman's primary market is no longer
that which is within a wagon's ride,'' Thornburgh said.

<HEAD>No `Greater Evil' Defense in Operation Rescue Trespassing Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Operation Rescue leader Randall Terry and
four other anti-abortionists cannot argue during their trespassing
trial that they were trying to prevent the greater evil of murder
when they blockaded a clinic, a judge ruled Tuesday.
   ``There cannot be any way in which it can be shown that the
abortions were stopped that day. This is going to be a case of
trespassing, conspiracy to trespass and obstruction of a
business,'' Municipal Judge Richard Paez said.
   Defense attorney Cyrus Zal had asked Paez to allow him to use
the ``necessity defense,'' arguing a law was broken during the
March 25 blockade in order to prevent greater harm.
   ``There are hearts that are still beating today because of the
actions my client took,'' Zal said Monday.
   But the judge said Tuesday he wouldn't allow expert testimony on
the viability of a fetus, saying that question was left to the
Legislature.
   ``I think the law at the time and now is that a woman has the
right to an abortion up to ... 24 weeks,'' Paez said.
   Terry, 29, and Michael McMonagle, 36, both from Pennsylvania;
Don Bennette, 35, of Mission Viejo; Andy Eppink, 41, of Lake Los
Angeles; and Jeff White, 31, of Santa Cruz are each charged with
two counts of conspiracy and one count each of resisting arrest,
blocking an entrance, failing to disperse and violating a court
order.
   Terry, McMonagle and White are acting as their own attorneys.
   ``Can any pro-lifer in this country get a fair trial? Our
defense is gutted right in the forefront. Our defense of why we
were there is that we were saving human lives,'' Terry said.
   The decision allows jury selection to go forward in what is
expected to be a month-long trial.
   The five defendants were among 771 demonstrators arrested last
spring for blocking the entrances of Los Angeles-area women's
clinics as part of a crusade against abortion.
   The city attorney's office says it is prepared to prosecute 539
other anti-abortion demonstrators, trying them in groups of 15 to
20. The remaining 232 originally arrested pleaded guilty and were
sentenced to probation.

<HEAD>Military Warns Pilots Not to Bomb Bird Sanctuary</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Military pilots across New England risk losing
their wings if they bomb a bird sanctuary during aerial target
practice over Noman's Land, a pristine island three miles off
Martha's Vineyard.
   The Navy has been using the deserted island as a bombing target
since World War II. Nowadays, pilots from the Air Force and
National Guard drop sand-filled dummy bombs and smoke markers on
the western tip of Noman's Land.
   They no longer use live explosives, but some have reportedly
violated an order to stay away from the rest of the island, where
grassy knolls, marshes and unspoiled beaches provide a haven for
wildlife.
   Peregrine falcons rest there during their annual migration from
Greenland to South America. Rare short-eared owls and snowy
eaglets, black crowned night herons and northern harriers, better
known as marsh hawks, all flourish where tourists are banned.
   And the clear ponds shelter an elusive species of spotted
turtle, said Thomas W. French, director of the state's endangered
species program.
   The F-111s and A-10s have been ordered to keep away from the
northeast corner of the island, where the birds like to nest on a
rocky point.
   But two weeks ago, a citizen in the Gay Head area of Martha's
Vineyard spotted a military jet over the sanctuary, said Augustus
Ben David, a biologist who runs the Felix Neck Wildlife Sanctuary
in Edgartown and has been inspecting Noman's Land since 1973.
   Based on the report and a visit to the island, Capt. John G.
Kuchinski Jr., the new commander of the Naval Air Station in South
Weymouth, has again put pilots on notice to stay clear of both the
sanctuary and the cliffs of Gay Head, which are dotted with
secluded million-dollar homes, Navy spokesmen said Tuesday.
   Kuchinski told The Patriot Ledger of Quincy Monday that any Navy
pilots found bombing over the sanctuary could be stripped of their
wings.
   ``These pilots are in combat aircraft and are pretty
proficient,'' he said. ``The island is big and the pilots know (the
target area.) I'm sending a message today to remind everyone we are
watching.''
   ``This is the only target site in the whole New England area,''
said Cmdr. Lewis H. Smalley, the second-in-charge at the South
Weymouth base.
   French, who accompanied Kuchinski and others on the island tour
last week, said he saw no signs that practice bombs had been
dropped in the sanctuary. The orange bombs, which range from 25
pounds to 500 pounds, are clearly visible in the grass around the
targets on the western side of the island, he said.
   ``That doesn't mean there weren't any (bombs inside the
sanctuary), but it does indicate to me that it's not common
practice,'' French said.
   Over the years, the military use of Noman's Land has drawn fire
from some naturalists and drawn anti-military protesters to fields
where none but sheep have lived for nearly 80 years.
   But French and Ben David said the military presence has in fact
been kinder to the creatures of Noman's Land than campers and
picnickers would be.
   ``Certainly it sounds bad when you talk about bombing the
island,'' French said. ``It has a nasty ring to it. ... But frankly
it's protected the island a lot more than the other ways we protect
open space. Even passive public use makes a lot of our sites
unattractive to wildlife.''
   ``As long as the pilots obey the rules and use the target areas
and use the proper approach pattern, then the island is alive and
well,'' Ben David said.

<HEAD>Official Meets Cardinal After His Offer to Mediate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The deputy premier met with
Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek, who offered to mediate between
communist authorities and activists seeking political reform, it
was reported Tuesday.
   The Communist Party daily Rude Pravo reported the meeting Monday
between Tomasek and Deputy Premier Matej Lucan. It did not,
however, mention Tomasek's open letter expressing support for a
petition for democratic reforms or his offer to mediate amid
increasing attacks by the authorities on the opposition.
   Prague officials lashed out again Tuesday at activists who
circulated a petition for democratic reform, alleging they are
trying to stir up unrest.
   Tomasek, 90, made his offer to mediate in an open letter Aug. 4,
in an apparent attempt to defuse tension over the forthcoming 21st
anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia, emigre
sources said Monday.
   ``Today, an increasing number of citizens are demanding a share
in the domestic responsibility for the state of society by signing
the petition `Several Sentences' and, to this end, are even
prepared to pay the price of personal sacrifice,'' the cardinal's
letter said.
   The petition has been signed by 15,000 people, including some
Communist Party members.
   Sources close to the cardinal who insisted on anonymity said the
meeting with Lucan ``took place in a very noble and smooth
atmosphere,'' but declined to say whether the meeting produced any
concrete agreements or give other details.
   Rude Pravo said only that Lucan ``appreciated the cardinal's
interest in current developments in our society and the solution of
open questions.''
   In a separate article, the daily quoted officials as criticizing
the petition and its authors. A co-sponsor of the petition,
Stanislav Devaty, was arrested Monday at his home in Gottwaldov,
Moravia. He was arrested twice earlier this year on charges of
anti-state activity, but released both times after staging hunger
strikes.
   Communist Party ideologist Jan Fojtik called the petition ``a
flop,'' Rude Pravo reported.
   The Prague leadership repeatedly has denounced the petition and
said those signing it face fines or imprisonment.
   The criticism is part of a barrage of propaganda against
opposition groups prior to the Aug. 21 anniversary of the 1968
invasion, when renewed anti-government protests are expected.
   Six of the activists who sponsored the petition have been told
they are under investigation and police have searched houses and
done repeated document checks on dissidents in recent days.
   In an interview with Rude Pravo and the official news agency
CTK, the chief investigator of the national security corps,
Jaroslav Spura, said he had proof the petition aimed ``to stir up
unrest, provoke acts of pressure and violate public order.''
   Spura said his investigation was not finished but it already was
clear the petition's supporters sought ``to overthrow the socialist
system in Czechoslovakia.''
   He quoted from a letter allegedly written by veteran activist
Petr Uhl to banned playwright Vaclav Havel. It was not clear how
authorities obtained the letter, and its authenticity could not be
confirmed.
   Uhl's telephone has been cut off by police and Havel has been
ordered by authorities to stay out of Prague.
   Havel was detained twice last week, once for three hours and the
second time for 11 hours.
   About 10,000 people took part in unofficial demonstrations last
year to mark the 20th anniversary of the invasion. Other
anti-government protests took place in October, January and May
when police used force to disperse crowds.
   Tomasek voiced his concern about further violence in his letter.
   ``As a herald of peace I have the duty to warn against
violence,'' he said. He also called on authorities and the
opposition to meet.

   The Bush administration congratulated Geoffrey
Palmer on becoming prime minister of New Zealand Tuesday as a
senior Republican congressman said the two countries now have an
opportunity to better relations soured by New Zealand's five-year
ban on visits by American warships.
   In a statement congratulating Palmer on succeeding resigned
Prime Minister David Lange, State Department spokesman Richard
Bouchard said, ``The United States looks forward to productive
dealings with New Zealand under his leadership.''
   Noting that the United States has said frequently that ``we

ANZUS (Australia-New Zealand-US) alliance,'' Boucher added he had
no ``specific announcement about expected changes at this point.''
   In Wellington, Palmer said that he wants to hold discussions
with the United States but that his nation's anti-nuclear policy
won't be changed.
   A U.S. lawmaker who knows Palmer, termed his accession to power
``a real breakthrough.''
   ``The change in leadership in New Zealand presents a unique
opportunity for breaking the icy government-to-government relations
that have characterized the Lange years,'' added Rep. Jim Leach,
R-Iowa, reached in his home district.

   An automobile left running in the basement
garage of an apartment house has been blamed for the deaths of
three elderly people, police said Tuesday.
   The body of Earle Zahm, 87, was found Monday after police were
called to investigate an odor coming from his first-floor apartment.
   Later in the day, the body of 79-year-old Mary Rose Liermann was
found in her apartment, prompting police to search the building.
The search turned up the body of 83-year-old Horace Moon in another
apartment. The fourth apartment in the building was vacant.
   Police said all three victims may have been dead for more than
48 hours when they were found. They were believed to have been
killed by carbon monoxide poisoning.
   Police Lt. James Scego said the ignition of Zahm's car in the
garage below the apartments was on when it was inspected and the
vehicle's battery was dead, leading investigators to believe the
engine had been left running.

<TEXT>
   In the quiet Pleasure Lake community, where
houses and mobile homes cluster around a fish pond crowded with
cypress, some neighbors had a feeling something was wrong at the
secondhand Jackson trailer.
   The 13-year-old girl who lived there with her mother, stepfather
and four brothers could sometimes be heard crying, ``Stop it,'' one
neighbor said. She was seldom allowed out, said another, except to
borrow food and cigarettes.
   Then, last month, ``the little girl walked across the street and
told my adopted granddaughter that she had to talk to someone,''
said neighbor Roy Pitts. ``I could tell she had been crying.''
   After she told her story, child welfare authorities came to pick
up the girl and a few hours later investigators arrested her
stepfather and four brothers on 46 counts, including child
molestation.
   ``We don't work a case every day where the victim's own siblings
are involved,'' Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent Paul Musick
told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ``This is the first time I
can remember when we've arrested every male in the family'' on
molestation charges.
   Arrested were Harold Jackson, 39, the girl's stepfather, and her
four brothers _ Jerry Medlin, 21; Wesley Medlin, 19; Edward Medlin,
17; and a 16-year-old whose name was withheld.
   When Pitts talked to the girl last month, ``she said her older
brother had kept her in bed all day and that he had laid out of
work because she would be home alone,'' he recalled.
   Neighbors said she did not have a key to the trailer, and
sometimes had to sit outside for hours until her parents came home
from work. Pitts said he saw her when her brothers made her ``bum
cigarettes for them.''
   ``They stayed shut up in the house,'' said 74-year-old Hazel
Tucker, who lives next door along the dusty dirt road around the
lake. ``She'd run out and one of her brothers would ... take her in
the house and slam the door.''
   Carol Tucker, Mrs. Tucker's daughter-in-law, told The
Journal-Constitution she sometimes heard cries of ``Stop it'' from
the Jackson trailer, but thought they were just typical family
squabbles.
   ``She'd come out of the door and say, `Leave me alone,''' she
recalled. ``When I heard about the arrests it upset me real bad.''
   The Tuckers, Pitts and other neighbors were interviewed a few
hours before a Superior Court judge issued a gag order barring
attorneys, law-enforcement personnel and potential witnesses from
discussing the case.
   Judge John D. Crosby approved the motion Friday at the request
of Assistant District Attorney Diane Perry, who said the gag order
was needed to protect the alleged victim and to ensure a fair trial
for the defendants.
   The girl's mother, Beth Jackson, told the judge that news
reports were causing her great emotional distress and problems at
work. Mrs. Jackson has told authorities she was unaware of any
sexual assaults on her daughter.
   Jackson and the three oldest brothers attended the hearing. They
are being held in the Irwin County Jail, and the juvenile is being
held in the Youth Detention Center in Eastman.
   Officials said the charges against the stepfather and the four
brothers are based on alleged assaults dating back to January 1988.
Pitts said the girl told him ``it had been happening since she was
8 years old.''
   He said he believed the girl sought help out of fears she might
be pregnant: ``She told my granddaughter, `I might be pregnant, and
I'm scared.'''
   She is in foster care pending the outcome of the case.
   People who report suspected child abuse are guaranteed
confidentiality, but Pitts said he wanted his name publicized so
people will ``know not to do it around me.''
   ``I feel protective about all kids,'' said the 56-year-old
disabled veteran, who has four adopted grandchildren.
   ``We had a gut feeling something was wrong, but couldn't prove
it,'' he said. ``The first time I knew ... I went to the
authorities.''
   ``We knowed something was going on, but you just don't do
anything unless you know for sure,'' said Hazel Tucker.

   The Soviet Union has accepted binding
international agreements partly aimed at increased protection of
civilians during internal armed conflicts, the International
Committee of the Red Cross said Tuesday.
   Other East bloc states are expected to follow Moscow's lead in
ratifying the two protocols, or additions, to the 1949 Geneva
Conventions on international humanitarian law, Red Cross officials
said. In April, Hungary became the first East European country to
ratify the protocols.
   The Red Cross said it was ``extremely gratified'' by the Soviet
decision. The private, all-Swiss humanitarian agency monitors
compliance with the Geneva conventions and the 1977 protocols.
   Soviet officials notified the Red Cross that the Supreme Soviet,
the nation's legislature, approved ratification of the two
protocols without reservations, a Red Cross statement said.
   The two texts were agreed by a Geneva diplomatic conference in
June 1977. Many countries signed, including the Soviet Union, but
not all ratified the agreements.
   The first protocol strengthens the protection of victims of
fighting between countries; the second applies to internal conflict.
   Eighty-six nations have ratified the first protocol and 76 are
party to the second.
   The United States signed both texts but ratified neither. The
second protocol was sent to the Senate for ratification, but the
first was not because Washington said it could give recognition and
protection to terrorist groups.
   The Geneva Conventions, drafted under the impression of World
War II, are designed to protect wounded and sick soldiers in the
field and at sea, prisoners of war and civilians in time of war.
   The 1977 protocols were added to cover modernized forms of
warfare.
   For civilians in internal conflict, the conventions offer
protection after they have been captured or arrested, a Red Cross
jurist noted. The second protocol expanded those safeguards to
cover the effects of internal fighting, such as bombings and
shootings, on the population at large.

   President Bush jokingly pronounced himself
furious Tuesday with senior White House aides for posing for a gag
photo, straight from the Doonesbury comic strip, depicting the
president as an invisible leader.
   The photo's inscription read: ``To President Skippy. From the
gang that sees through you.''
   Waving the picture round in mock anger, Bush said it should have
read, ``The gang that used to work here.''
   The picture showed Chief of Staff John Sununu, National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft, Deputy National Security Adviser Robert
Gates and a fourth, unidentified person sitting around Bush's desk
in the Oval Office, staring at an empty chair.
   ``I'm furious at him,'' Bush said of White House Press Secretary
Marlin Fitzwater, even though Fitzwater was not in the picture.
``Just take a look. Read the inscription.''
   He quipped, ``This is a vicious assault on my presidency.''
   Bush is a frequent target of criticism from Doonesbury's
creator, Garry Trudeau. Lampooning Bush, Trudeau pictures the
president as being invisible and portrays his imaginary, evil twin
brother known as ``Skippy.''
   Bush has made no secret that he's no fan of Trudeau. The artist
was excluded from the invitation list when Bush invited cartoonists
to lunch.
   Bush's brief appearance in the White House press room caused a
stampede of cameramen and photographers. The president retreated
from the room when reporters tried to turn it into a question and
answer session.

   Parents of lawbreaking minors could be
placed in a public stockade under an ordinance adopted by the City
Council.
   ``Until we introduce shame back in crime and punishment, we're
spinning our wheels,'' City Attorney Charles Sidney Gibson said.
   The ordinance also requires anyone under 18 must be off the
streets and away from public places and private businesses from 11
p.m. to 5:30 a.m. The ordinance was approved unanimously Saturday
following a street fight the night before and an increase in crime
during the summer.
   Parents unable to control their children may sign a statement
saying so and the minors will be considered delinquent and have
their fate decided by juvenile courts. Those parents will have to
pay the city $100 for each minor so designated or render 20 hours
of community service.
   The parents will also be required to place a placard at their
homes and display a bumper sticker on their vehicle saying: ``My
children are not my responsibility. They are yours.''
   Mayor Eugene Farrell said Monday he doubted that the city would
ever use a stockade because the city has none.
   The ordinance calls for:
   _Misdemeanor charges against parents or guardians of minors
``who fail to exercise control'' over their wards after being
warned that the minor is in violation of the ordinance.
   _Minors who violate the provisions to be taken into custody and
held by the police until they are turned over to their parents or
guardians.
   _Parents of children who violate the ordinance to be fined up to
$500, jailed for up to 30 days, and ``placed within stockaded
public display six hours a day'' but not more than two consecutive
days.
   Adults who fail to abide by the ordinance may also have their
photograph placed in the local weekly newspaper for two weeks. A
caption would read, ``Irresponsible Parent or Custodian,''
whichever applies.
   Gibson said he was not sure about the constitutionality of the
stockade but felt sure the other provisions were constitutional.
   Police Chief Jerry Melton said the fight that pushed the City
Council into action involved about six young people and adults and
drew 250 onlookers.
   Farrell said the ordinance could be lifted if youngsters'
conduct improves.
   ``Something's got to be done,'' the city attorney said. ``There
are people in this town afraid to go out of the house. (Youths)
curse them (and) steal their checks out of the mailboxes. The older
ones will initiate the younger ones by making them steal. If they
don't join the gang, they whip them.''

combed-back hair flopping on his forehead. A change of hair style?
Nope: Bush just needed a haircut, the White House said.
   Bush made the appearance shortly after he jogged for 30 minutes,
and his hair was not quite dry as he spoke to the civil rights
group.
   The final event on Bush's calendar, in fact, was a haircut.
   ``He isn't changing his hair style. Wait until you see him
tomorrow after his haircut before drawing any conclusions,'' said
deputy press secretary Stephen Hart.

   China's social and political turmoil will make
it more difficult for its communist government to deal with
galloping inflation, falling industrial output and other economic
woes, according to a report to Congress by the Central Intelligence
Agency.
   Economic reform has been put on hold by the central government
and economic problems could prompt renewed political unrest in the
1990's, said the report to the Joint Economic Committee released
Tuesday.
   ``The new leadership has endorsed a continuation of the
austerity program, but the social and political turmoil that has
gripped China since April will make it difficult for Beijing to
solve its pressing economic problems,'' the report said.
   The preoccupation of China's leaders with consolidating power,
ridding the government of supporters of deposed Premier Zhao Ziyang
and strengthening party and ideological control ``will prevent them
from formulating new solutions to China's economic problems,'' the
CIA analysts concluded.
   ``Pressures to increase government expenditures and expand the
money supply have probably grown because of the social unrest,''
the CIA report said. ``Beijing may attempt to increase income
subsidies and loans to state enterprises enough to ensure that
wages of most urban workers keep pace with inflation.''
   Inflation in 1989 hit 19 percent overall and 30 percent in urban
areas, the highest levels since the communists came to power in
1949.
   Inflation in large cities remained at the 30 percent rate early
this year and is likely to remain in double digits for the rest of
1989.
   The CIA authors also said China's military leaders probably will
play a larger political and economic role in return for the
military crackdown last May on democracy demonstrations in Beijing.
   ``Military leaders probably will petition civilian authorities
to reverse the decade-long decline in the share of the budget going
to defense,'' the CIA said.
   The CIA report was made public by Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.,
chairman of the panel's national security subcommittee.
   Bingaman said the report shows that ``the clock is turning
backward for the Chinese economy.''
   ``A decade of economic reform may have effectively come to a
standstill with the crackdown in Tiananmen Square,'' he said.
   ``China is in danger of being re-centralized,'' Bingaman said
``... The unfortunate lesson for Westerners is that economic reform
in socialist countries is not irreversible.''
   The report said that while China's gross national product grew
by more than 11 percent in 1988 and industrial output grew by 21
percent, those rates slumped in the first half of this year with
industrial growth falling to an annual rate of 11 percent.
   The government postponed price decontrol indefinitely and
reimposed price controls on such commodities as steel, copper,
aluminum and other materials. Controls over production, marketing
and distribution were recentralized.
   International financial institutions such as the World bank and
the Asian Development Bank have suspended billions of dollars in
low-interest development loans.
   China's trade deficit reached $7.7 billion in 1988 and exports
are slipping, the CIA reported, estimating that export revenues
fell by $100 million a day during the occupation of Beijing's
Tiananmen Square by pro-democracy forces.
   The CIA projected a drop in foreign exchange earned through
tourism from 1988's $2.2 billion to about $1.5 billion this year,
and said tourism could remain depressed into the 1990s.

   President Bush, sidestepping disputes with
civil rights advocates, pledged Tuesday to work with them to halt
the decline of inner cities and to remove barriers for minorities.
He vowed, ``We will make America open and equal to all.''
   ``My administration is committed to reaching out to minorities,
to striking down barriers to free and open access,'' Bush told
delegates to the 79th annual conference of the National Urban
League.
   ``We will not tolerate discrimination, bigotry or bias of any
kind _ period,'' he said.
   The president got a cordial reception, interrupted by applause
10 times from a mostly black audience of several thousand people.
   He did not unveil any initiatives. Nor did he address several
areas where his administration has alienated civil rights groups,
such accepting without complaint Supreme Court rulings limiting
affirmative action, vetoing minimum wage legislation and nominating
William Lucas to be the Justice Department's top civil rights
enforcer.
   The Detroit lawyer's nomination was rejected by a Senate
committee after criticism by black leaders that Lucas, who also is
black, lacked experience in discrimination cases.
   Bush told the Urban League that ``in many respects, urban
America offers a bleak picture, an inner city in crisis,'' with
problems of crime, drugs, school dropouts, and limited economic
opportunities.
   ``Your problems are my problems,'' Bush said. ``Today, I offer
you my hand, I offer you my word. Together we will make America
open and equal to all. Together, we will find a way to stop the
decline in our inner cities _ to restore hope, and make the '90s a
decade of urban renaissance.''
   Commenting afterward on the speech, Rep. William Gray, D-Pa.,
the majority whip of the House, said, ``I think what we've got here
is a president who's got the right tone. He's given us some
criteria to judge him by but we haven't seen the specifics, the
means for fighting that war on drugs, the means of investing in
education. Education is key but where is the money going to come
from?''
   Urban League President John E. Jacob said that in evaluating
Bush's administration, ``I am willing to concede that the first six
to eight months is the rhetoric period. We will use the next 12
months to determine how well he does in carrying that out.
   ``His rhetoric is right,'' Jacob said. ``He is saying the right
things. Now we have to find out whether he is going to do the right
things.''
   Bush told the audience, ``Now, I'm not afraid to say we've got
hard work ahead of us. We've got to wage war on poverty and wage
war on despair, wage war on the hopelessness that robs us of our
future.
   ``I want to tell all of you here, I'm not going to relax in this
job or rest until I know that I have done everything in my power to
assure that we succeed _ that every child in our inner cities has a
shot at a good job, that every kid stays in school and gets a
quality education, yes, lives in decent housing in a neighborhood
free of drugs, fear and violence.''
   Bush, accused by some civil rights leaders of failing to match
his words with actions, said that ``we've all spent a lot of time
over the past two decades debating the best means of ending unequal
treatment ... about affirmative action, about quotas, about goals
and timetables.''
   However, Bush said that with America's population growing older,
there will be an abundance of job opportunities in the 1990s. ``For
every child growing up today _ black or white, urban or rural _
there will be a job waiting.''
   Bush noted that he has proposed a $250 million dollar increase
in Head Start funds and had included in a $441 million education
package some money for grants to schools hit hardest by drugs.
   He called anew for approval of a program of enterprise zones
giving tax breaks to inner-city businesses, and said that a
six-year-old job training program has been helping disadvantaged
youths enter the workforce.
   There was no mention in the speech of a rumored trip by Bush to
central Africa later this year. White House aides said the
possibility of such a trip is not being widely discussed in the
administration.
   Meanwhile, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
Bush has not decided whether to resubmit Lucas' name during the
current congressional recess, which would temporarily avoid the
confirmation process.
   Likewise, Fitzwater indicated Bush was not about to change his
view that no new laws are needed to modify the Supreme Court
rulings. ``That's a decision that's already been made by the
Justice Department,'' Fitzwater said.

<HEAD>New Prime Minister Says No Policy Change</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Geoffrey Palmer was installed as
prime minister Tuesday and said policies will remain the same,
including one barring U.S. warships from New Zealand ports because
they might carry nuclear weapons.
   New Zealand became nuclear-free during the five-year tenure of
his predecessor, David Lange, who became involved in major disputes
with the United States and France over the issue.
   Lange, 47, resigned Monday, citing health reasons, and the
governing Labor Party chose Palmer to succeed him.
   Palmer, also 47, said of Lange: ``You have led with a vision and
humanity that will be hard for any of us to match.''
   The nuclear argument with France began because of that country's
nuclear tests in the Pacific and grew when French agents bombed a
Greenpeace ship docked in New Zealand, killing a photographer who
worked for the environmental organization.
   Two agents involved in the 1985 bombing are back in France,
despite an agreement with Lange's government that they would be
assigned to a French atoll in the Pacific.
   Prime Minister Rabbie Namaliu of Papua New Guinea said Tuesday
he would miss Lange's ``fearless diplomacy.''
   In a statement congratulating Palmer, State Department spokesman
Richard Bouchard said in Washington: ``the United States looks
forward to productive dealings with New Zealand under his
leadership.''
   Bob Hawke, prime minister of neighboring Australia, said he and
Palmer were close despite some policy differences. Palmer told a
news conference New Zealand's future well-being depended on
Australia.
   The economy deteriorated while Lange was in office, partly
because of tight regulation, and he appointed Roger Douglas to
reform it.
   Douglas deregulated industry, sold off state assets and wanted
to go farther, but Lange said the social cost of moving so fast was
too high.
   Early last year, Lange rejected Douglas's plans to take his
approach into social services and the labor market, sacred
territories to the Labor Party.
   They argued in public and Lange fired Douglas last December.
Douglas was re-elected to the Cabinet last week and Lange was
supposed to give him a portfolio Monday, but resigned instead.
   In a final swipe at Douglas during his farewell speech, Lange
said the ``juggernaut of the New Right'' had been beaten.
   An editorial Tuesday in the Sydney Morning Herald said: ``The
timing of the resignation suggests that health was not his only
consideration. By resigning now he makes it more difficult for Mr.
Douglas to become prime minister, something that might have happned
had he held on to the end of the year.''
   Lange suffered a heart attack a year ago.

   Jewish-American leaders, concerned about
possible strains in U.S.-Israeli relations over the hostage crisis,
said President Bush ``reaffirmed the close and strong
relationship'' in a meeting with them Tuesday.
   Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle and other administration
officials met with a half-dozen leaders from Jewish-American
organizations at the White House.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said afterwards the
Jewish leaders, who requested the meeting, were ``concerned about
Israel in this process and any general public attitudes that might
develop.''
   He said they expressed support ``for the president and for the
peace process in the Middle East (and indicated) they shared our
anguish over the hostage situation.''
   ``Essentially, it was a discussion of the peace process ... how
that could be helped,'' he said.
   Seymour D. Reich, chairman of the Conference of Presidents of
Major Jewish Organizations, issued a statement later saying: ``The
meeting was positive and productive. The president reaffirmed the
strong and close relationship that binds the United States and
Israel.''
   The terrorists who claim to have hanged Marine Lt. Col. William
R. Higgins in Lebanon on July 31 were demanding that Israel release
the Moslem cleric its commandos abducted on July 28.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., accused Israel last
week of acting irresponsibly, and Fitzwater said then that some
administration officials shared those sentiments.
   Other Jewish leaders at the meeting were: Edward Levy Jr.,
president of the American Israel Political Action Committee and a
Detroit businessman; Max M. Fisher of Detroit, honorary chairman of
the Republican National Jewish Coalition; Gerry Klein of New York
and Dick Fox of Philadelphia, co-chairman of that coalition; and
Malcolm Hoenleina, executive director of the Conference of
Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations. Reich is a New York
lawyer.

<HEAD>Administration Sees Contras Remaining if Unsatisfied by Peace Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ The Bush administration said Tuesday that the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels can remain together as a fighting force if
they don't like the plan by Central American presidents to disband
them.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the
administration is ``generally supportive'' of the pact agreed to by
the presidents of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and
Guatemala. But he said ``we're skeptical'' of Nicaragua's
commitment to democratic reforms.
   The agreement calls for the rebels to voluntarily disband by
Dec. 5 and be peacefully repatriated, so long as the Nicaraguan
government moves toward democratic elections.
   But the Bush administration said the pact is far from the
``death sentence'' for the Contras described by Nicaraguan Daniel
Ortega.
   ``We're clearly moving toward demobilization and repatriation
...,'' said Fitzwater. ``We're moving in that direction but I think
it's too early to say that the game's over.''
   ``Our policy is ... we would not like to see demobilization
before the election,'' set for Feb. 25, he told reporters.
   The 120-day plan set out in accords signed by the presidents
Monday set a 30-day deadline for a joint U.N.-Organization of
American States observer mission to be organized and another 90
days for the Contras to demobilize.
   The Contras, whose 10,000 troops are encamped in Honduras along
the Nicaraguan border, are to be part of negotiations with the
commission and the Sandinistas to work out details of the
demobilization, U.S. officials said.
   But Fitzwater emphasized that if the Contras don't like the
conditions developed by the commission, ``The issue then is,
they're still there. If they don't agree to it, they're not
demobilized.''
   U.S. officials would not discuss what stand the Bush
administration would then take on renewed funding for the rebels.
The current aid package calls for $49.8 million in food, clothes
and other non-lethal aid to last through Feb. 28 next year.
   State Department officials refused to confirm reports that the
administration had lobbied the Central American leaders to keep the
Contras intact until the election.
   ``The timetables and the issue of before and after the elections
... is not something that we focus on specifically,'' said Richard
Boucher, spokesman for the State Department. ``What we focus on is
the process and the steps needed to make the process work.''
   The Center for Democracy, a private, non-partisan U.S. group
picked to monitor the Nicaraguan election next February, said the
pact's success depend on how the provisions of a political accord
last week between the Sandinistas and opposition parties are
implemented.
   ``We are at the moment of truth with regard to Nicaragua,'' said
Allen Weinstein, the center's president, ``one that can lead toward
genuine democratization ... or away from those goals.''
   Weinstein, whose organization also monitored the 1986 Philippine
and the 1988 Panamanian elections for the Senate, said the OAS and
U.N. should also seek an immediate start to the promised amnesty
for political prisoners and a plan to let the Contras vote in the
election without having to return to Nicaragua.
   U.S. officials said they were pleased with the parts of the
Central American pact that call for an end to the nine-year-old
Salvadoran civil war being waged by Marxist rebels, the voluntary
nature of the demobilization, and the requirement for verifiable
conditions that will allow peaceful and secure repatriation of the
Contras.
   They also said Nicaragua's recent concessions, announced on the
eve of the Central American presidents' meeting, to ease
restrictions on the media coverage and allow voting by soldiers
were a positive sign.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the Foreign
Relations Western hemisphere affairs subcommittee, called for U.S.
cooperation with the accord.
   ``It is our role, as friends of democracy and as neighbors with
a profound interest in the stability of the region, to support this
process,'' Dodd said Tuesday.

   A federal grand jury is investigating former
House Speaker Jim Wright's book deal and has subpoenaed documents
from at least three groups that directly or indirectly bought bulk
copies of ``Reflections of a Public Man,'' for which Wright earned
royalties of 55 percent.
   The Justice Department refused Tuesday to disclose the nature of
its investigation. Attorneys for two organizations said it involved
Wright's book, and a spokesman for a third said it had also been
subpoenaed for documents related to the former congressional leader.
   The House ethics committee, after a year's investigation, said
it had reason to believe Wright, a Texas Democrat, had tried to
evade House limits on outside income through bulk sales of the
book. That investigation ended with Wright's resignation in June.
   Attorneys for Southwest Texas State University and the National
Association of Realtors said Tuesday they had received subpoenas
from a U.S. District Court grand jury here. A spokesman for Ocean
Spray, a cranberry and citrus growers cooperative in Massachusetts,
said documents from the group were also being sought by the grand
jury.
   Southwest Texas attorney Bill Fly said the university received a
subpoena, dated July 14, on Monday, and has until Friday to submit
documents surrouding Wright's speech to the school in the fall of
1984 and the subsequent purchase of $3,000 worth of the book.
   Laurene Janik, general counsel for the Realtors organization,
said the group is also responding to a grand jury subpoena relating
to Wright's book.
   Jack Pettit, managing partner of the Washington office of the
law firm of Hopkins, Sutter, Hamel and Park, said it had been asked
to ``supply some documents in connection with the grand jury
investigation of Wright and we're happy to comply.''
   Pettit, who testified before the ethics committee, said that
``as far as I can tell, what they are asking for is pretty much
what was asked for in the ethics committee investigation.''
   Larry Shannon, administrative assistant at Wright's office in
Fort Worth, said that the investigation appears ``very routine''
and that it resulted from the media attention focused on Wright
during the ethics investigation.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said the agency's
inquiry is continuing. ``I can't comment on any aspect of the
investigation, except I will confirm that is ongoing,'' he said.
   Southwest Texas State attorney Fly said the university had
agreed to pay Wright $3,000 for a speech. After Wright's
appearance, someone in the speaker's office called the university
to say Wright had reached his limit on outside income. Wright's
staff member then asked if the speaker could use the $3,000 to
instead purchase copies of his book for the university, Fly said.
   He said that Wright endorsed the check and gave it over to his
publisher.
   ``We received about 504 copies of that book,'' Fly said.
   Under an agreement with the publisher of his book, Wright was to
receive 55 percent royalties. While the House limits what a member
can keep in fees from speaking engagements to 30 percent of his or
her congressional salary, royalties are exempt.
   Ms. Janik said Wright spoke to the Realtors group in April 1985.
A $2,000 check was issued and voided, and the money was to be used
to purchase Wright's book, she said. But the Realtors have no
record of receiving copies of the book and no staff member has any
recollection of seeing the books, Ms. Janik said.
   Ocean Spray spokesman John Lawlor said Wright spoke to a group
of growers and management employees in November 1985, but Wright's
staff suggested that, instead of giving Wright a $2,000 honorarium,
Ocean Spray use the money to purchase $2,000 worth of Wright's
books for the congressman's use.
   ``As far as we were concerned, it was an honorarium in the form
of a book purchase in place of a cash honorarium,'' Lawlor said.
``How he was to use them (the books) was for him to determine.''
   Lawlor said Ocean Spray did not want to discuss details of the
subpoena, other than to confirm that ``they are limited to matters
relating to the former speaker.''

   Representatives of striking Bell Atlantic
telephone workers and the company resumed contract talks Tuesday as
telephone service continued with few interruptions.
   The meeting, which lasted just over two hours, ended without any
apparent agreement being reached. A union representative, who
declined to give her name, refused to comment about the proceedings
as the meeting ended. A Bell Atlantic representative would only say
that the two sides were clarifying and evaluating the issues in an
attempt to resolve the three-day contract dispute.
   Barred by court injunction from mass picketing, striking
telephone workers marched in limited numbers Tuesday outside Bell
Atlantic buildings in six states and the nation's capital.
   The strike at Bell Atlantic was part of a nationwide walkout
that involved two other regional Bell companies _ NYNEX Corp.,
which operates in New York and New England, and Pacific Telesis, in
California and Nevada.
   In all, about 157,000 union workers in 15 states and the
District of Columbia were on strike, forcing management to work
long hours in such jobs as answering directory assistance queries.
   The companies urged people to dial direct when possible and no
major delays were reported for those calling without operator
assistance.
   The Bell Atlantic strike has idled 52,000 workers, including
41,000 members of the Communications Workers of America in
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West
Virginia and the District of Columbia. Another 11,000 workers are
members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in
Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
   No talks have been scheduled with the IBEW, and no talks were
scheduled in the other two strikes.
   ``We're pleased the CWA accepted our offer to come back to the
table,'' Christopher Clouser, Bell Atlantic vice president for
corporate relations, said in a prepared statement. ``It
demonstrates the CWA's good faith in reaching an equitable, timely
agreement.''
   Bob Bickers, a CWA spokesman, said before the meeting that the
company had requested the session to informally discuss items that
were already on the table.
   Five IBEW pickets were arrested Monday in Philadelphia for
allegedly violating the mass picketing ban, but were discharged
after a brief hearing before Common Pleas Judge Samuel Lehrer.
   Joan Toth, president and business agent for Local 1944, said
there was confusion at the time of their arrest because their union
wasn't named in the injunction.
   Michael Kaine, a Bell of Pennsylvania spokesman, said the union
later agreed to abide by the order and not force the company to go
to court again.
   Meantime, the flow of telephone service _ most of it automated
and handled by computers _ continued at a near normal level.
   ``Management employees are doing their best to maintain service
levels as close to normal as they can,'' said Bell of Pennsylvania
spokesman Thomas Duddy. ``There is some slowness in getting
directory assistance and in operator assistance for toll calls in
our area of service.
   ``But everything else which is automated is working fine. The
strike is having no effect on basic services, like telephone calls
from homes to homes and business to business.''
   John Schaer, spokesman for Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Co
in Alexandria, Va., said Tuesday, ``Things are going pretty much as
expected. Directory assistance is a little slow, and we're not
doing installations as we would regularly. We're not at 100 percent
but that was not to be expected.''

<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police and farmers with flashlights
searched a remote mountain area Tuesday night for the missing plane
carrying Rep. Mickey Leland and 13 other people.
   John Guerra, political officer at the U.S. Embassy in Addis
Ababa, said the search was conducted on foot and with the aid of
jeeps, trucks and other vehicles. The aerial search was suspended
at dusk Tuesday.
   Embassy officials said several planes remained on dirt airstrips
in the desolate area of southwestern Ethiopia, ready to resume the
search at dawn.
   The twin-engine plane carrying Leland and the other disappeared
Monday on its way to the Fugnido refugee camp near the border with
Sudan, 480 miles southwest of Addis Ababa.
   The 44-year-old Texas Democrat is chairman of the House Select
Committee on Hunger and he has taken a keen interest in Africa's
refugee problem.
   Aboard the plane with him were eight other Americans and five
Ethiopians. His office in Washington said the Americans included
Patrice Johnson, Leland's chief of staff; Hugh Johnson of the
Hunger committee staff, and Joyce F. Williams from the staff of
Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif.
   President Bush said he telephoned Leland's wife, Alison, in
Houston to express his concern and promise his administration will
do ``all we can to learn'' what has happened.
   ``She's strong, has a lot of hope, and we all pray that he's
safe,'' But told a meeting of the National Urban League in
Washington, where delegates observed a moment of silent prayer for
Leland's survival.
   ``I think it says a lot about Mickey that he was on his sixth
humanitarian mission to help feed the hungry in that part of the
world,'' Bush told the meeting.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Ethiopia's
government has asked for a ``specialized search plane'' and that
the United States is trying to find one to accommodate them.
   ``We have offered to assist in every way we can,'' Boucher said.
   Heavy clouds and poor visibility hampered aerial sweeps Tuesday
as rescue planes criss-crossed the cold, windswept plateau in
Ethiopia until sunset.
   Robert Houdek, U.S. charge d'affaires in Addis Ababa, said
searchers were encouraged by reports that a small plane was sighted
Monday circling a field at Dembidola, 75 miles from the refugee
camp.
   ``If it was our plane, what we find encouraging is that it would
have transversed a lot of the more treacherous terrain to
Fugnido,'' said Houdek. He said Dembidola is in an inaccessible
region far from communications points, ``which could provide a
benign explanation for why we haven't heard anything.''
   ``They could be sitting in the bush with the plane not capable
of taking off but in good shape waiting for search and rescue,''
Houdek said.
   At a briefing in Washington, Leland press secretary Alma Newsom
also was hopeful.
   ``At this point no news is good news,'' she said, recalling
being on similar trips with the congressman where air travel and
communications were disrupted.
   ``The safest thing for them to do was land and just sit tight
and we think that is what the congressman did,'' she said.
   She was confident the sighted plane was Leland's, she said,
because Ethiopian air controllers keep close tabs on planes and no
others were supposed to be in the area.
   Also in Washington, Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., said Ethiopian
authorities in the past have used bad weather as an excuse to
prevent American congressmen from visiting refugee camps or other
controversial sites.
   Ackerman said in June that he and Leland were to visit northern
refugee camps in March but were told their charter from Addis Ababa
airport could not take off because of bad weather. The lawmaker
said the weather appeared fine.
   Leland's Twin Otter aircraft left Addis Ababa in heavy clouds
and poor visibility at about 10:30 a.m. Monday after a two-hour
delay caused by bad weather, said embassy political officer John
Guerra.
   The plane was last heard from about 15 minutes after it took off.
   ``It was about 25 miles outside of Addis at the time,'' Guerra
said.
   The Twin Otter, a plane commonly used for bush flying in Africa,
carried eight people who were members of Leland's staff, embassy
personnel or officers of the U.S. Agency for International
Development. The five Ethiopians aboard were three government
officials, the pilot and co-pilot.
   Guerra said the pilot was highly experienced and had flown all
over the treacherously mountainous country for international relief
agencies.
   Half a dozen small planes were being used in the hunt directed
by Ethiopia's Civil Aviation Authority. A C-130 Hercules cargo
plane also was standing by.
   Fugnido camp is run by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
and is one of four in the region that house more than 300,000
refugees who have fled civil war in neighboring Sudan.

<HEAD>Proposal: No Politics, Speeches, Picnics, Bikes at Viet Monument</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group that built a memorial to honor the
city's Vietnam War dead wants to ban political activity, pets,
bicycles and radios at the site to preserve a dignified atmosphere.
   The Philadelphia Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund also wants to
ban sports and picnics.
   ``It's not just here in Philly, but across the nation, these
memorials have taken on the sanctity of a burial ground,'' said
District Attorney Ron Castille, the group's vice president.
   The American Civil Liberties Union called the proposal
``blatantly unconstitutional.''
   ``The streets and parks belong to the people and are free and
open to them to communicate messages,'' said Stefan Presser, legal
director of the ACLU of Pennsylvania. ``If the Fairmount Park
Commission approves this, there is no doubt in my mind it will be
challenged out of this office.''
   The granite monument is inscribed with the names of 641 people
killed in Vietnam.
   The memorial group said the proposed regulations are not a
response to any specific activities, but are intended to dignify
the memorial.
   The veterans fund wants to allow only memorial services or
ceremonies honoring Philadelphians who died or were listed as
missing in action.
   City officials and the memorial fund officers are negotiating
for a ``deed of gift,'' a document transferring control of the
monument from the non-profit memorial fund to the city. It would
then come under the park commission's jurisdiction.
   Under the proposal, ``Partisan'' activities would be banned,
including demonstrations for or against federal, state or local
governments or their policies.
   Also banned would be any activity by a political party or a
group seeking publicity, speechmaking of a partisan nature and
picketing, sign-waving or leaflet distribution.
   The memorial fund further wants to ban non-political activities
like soliciting, sports, picnics, walking pets, bicycling, roller
skating, littering, spitting, and playing radios or other audio and
video equipment.
   William Mifflin, executive director of the park commission, said
the proposed regulations were unprecedented for his organization.
   ``To my knowledge, we've never had a regulation of this sort,''
he said.
   The commission will consider the fund's proposal in October,
Mifflin said.
   Lloyd Ziff, counsel to the memorial fund, said the proposal was
patterned after rules adopted by the National Park Service for the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., and Arlington
National Cemetery.
   The memorial was dedicated in October 1987 after the memorial
fund raised $1.2 million to build it.
   On Memorial Day, vandals splashed white paint on four parts of
the wall listing the names of the dead. Veterans believed the
desecration was the work of youths they had chased away about 3 a.m.
   Firefighters flushed water over the paint, washing most of it
away, and crews of veterans spent hours before and after a Memorial
Day ceremony scraping and cleaning away what was left.

<HEAD>Lawyer Tells Court that Quebec Woman Proceeded with Abortion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Quebec woman barred from an abortion by an
injunction obtained by her former boyfriend went ahead with the
procedure, her lawyer told the Supreme Court on Tuesday.
   The court's nine justices had convened in emergency session in
Ottawa to hear the case of Chantal Daigle, a Quebec secretary, who
was believed to have just entered her 23rd week of pregnancy.
   Her lawyer, Daniel Bedard, did not say when or where Ms. Daigle,
21, had the abortion. He apologized to the court but asked for
permission to proceed with the case because Ms. Daigle faces
contempt of court.
   With the urgency removed from the need to proceed before an
abortion would become increasing dangerous, any decision on the
injunction could now be days or weeks away.
   Ms. Daigle's case had focused attention nationwide on abortion
and the lack of a national abortion law. It was the latest in a
series of cases in provincial courts this summer.
   Canada has been without an abortion law since the Supreme Court
in January 1988 ruled that the existing law's stringent
requirements for approval infringed on a woman's rights. The House
of Commons failed to approve any of six proposals in July 1988.
   The outcome was that abortion was a matter between a woman and
her doctor until the provincial court cases emerged.
   The Quebec Court of Appeal last month upheld an injunction
obtained by former nightclub bouncer Jean-Guy Tremblay, 25, Ms.
Daigle's ex-boyfriend.
   She faced a two-year prison sentence and a $42,500 fine if she
proceeded with the abortion.
   But there has not been a warrant for her arrest, said John
Tymchyk, prosecutor in Val d'Or, Quebec, where the injunction was
granted.
   ``We're not the ones who would bring it,'' he said. ``It's a
civil injunction so it would have to be a private individual who
brings contempt charges against her.''
   Both Tremblay and his lawyer, Henri Kelada, said in Ottawa they
did not want to take action for contempt against Ms. Daigle.
   In Toronto, Robin Rowe, national co-ordinator for the Canadian
Abortion Rights Action League, said it was Ms. Daigle's personal
decision.
   ``It shows that women who want and need an abortion will get one
_ no matter what the courts say,'' Ms. Rowe said.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has said Parliament will consider
the abortion issue this fall on return from recess.
   The federal government has argued in the Supreme Court that
abortion is ``within the exclusive legislative authority of the
Parliament of Canada'' and should not be a matter for provincial
courts to decide.
   Quebec's Court of Appeal was divided 3-2 in upholding the
injunction, basing the decision on the provincial Charter of Human
Rights. Justice Yves Bernier wrote in the majority position that
``the child that has been conceived but not born is a reality that
must be taken into account.''

<HEAD>Sniper Fire Across Beirut; City Prepares For Offensive</HEAD>

   Occasional sniper fire echoed across
Beirut's dividing Green Line on Tuesday and reports said Christian
army commander Gen. Michel Aoun and his Syrian foes were preparing
for major battle.
   People streamed from the bomb-ravaged capital during a lull in
combat to avoid what Moslem bank employee Nabil Masri called ``the
worst, which is yet to come.''
   ``There is talk all over Lebanon that they are preparing for
either a long confrontation or a final battle. We don't want to be
here in either case,'' said Masri, who was interviewed in Moslem
west Beirut.
   He said he was taking his wife and three children to settle in a
rented apartment in Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut.
   A police spokesman said no casualties were reported in Tuesday's
firing along confrontation lines in Beirut and the nearby mountains.
   Five months of artillery duels between Aoun's 20,000
predominantly Christian troops and Syria's 40,000 soldiers deployed
in west Beirut and other mainly Moslem sectors of Lebanon have
killed 549 people and wounded 1,322.
   All but 200,000 of Beirut's 1.5 million residents have fled to
safer areas in south Lebanon, the eastern Bekaa Valley or
northeastern mountain resorts.
   The newspaper An-Nahar said Syria has ``decided to fight a war
of attrition in Lebanon to achieve its aim of taming the Christian
camp.''
   The independent daily said Syrian officials informed their
leftist and Lebanese Moslem allies that President Hafez Assad's
Damascus government ``will not accept any dialogue with Gen. Aoun
under any circumstances.''
   Aoun, 54, a Maronite Catholic, has declared a ``war of
liberation'' to drive Syrian forces from territories they have
controlled since 1976.
   An-Nahar said Syrian troops may try to ``storm through'' the
310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of Beirut to topple
Aoun.
   Sources from Druse chief Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist
Party militia, Syria's main ally against Aoun, said the Christians
could try to break into Syrian-controlled territory.
   One ranking source said Aoun has ``massed tanks and troops for
an operation across the traditional front line.''
   The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.
   More than a week ago, a three-member Arab League committee said
its two-month mediation effort here resulted in an impasse and
blamed Syria for blocking the initiative. Political deadlock
followed.
   The foreign ministers of Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Algeria said
they would report back to see if they should try to reactivate the
mission.
   An Arab summit last May 26 asked King Hassan II of Morocco, King
Fahd of Saudi Arabia and President Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria to
work out a Lebanon peace settlement by November.
   U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy told reporters after a meeting
with Aoun that the Bush administration has urged the Arab leaders
to pursue their efforts.
   Outgoing President Amin Gemayel in September appointed Aoun to
lead an interim Christian Cabinet that would rule pending election
of a new head of state.
   Moslems and leftists rejected this appointment and pledged
allegiance to acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads the
Moslem Cabinet vying for legitimacy with Aoun's.
   The latest round of fighting broke out in March after Aoun
blockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of
Beirut, trying to salvage about $100 million lost annually in
customs fees.
   Syrian and allied forces retaliated by shelling the Christian
enclave, home to about 1 million people.

   Columbia rejoined NASA's fleet of
active space shuttles Tuesday, blasting into orbit with five
astronauts to put a 10-ton spy satellite on a path over the Soviet
Union, China and the Middle East.
   Columbia, the oldest shuttle, had been grounded for 3{ years
while it was stripped and overhauled from its toilet system to its
outer skin. Its performance during the countdown and at liftoff was
as troublefree as any of the previous 29 shuttle flights.
   ``As good as new,'' said Bob Sieck, the launch director. ``It's
going to be a gem of a vehicle.''
   The Air Force, which booked the entire five-day flight from the
civilian space agency, said nothing about the cargo in the
shuttle's 60-foot-long hold. Neither did NASA, which shut down its
public announcement network, except for periodic ``all's well''
reports.
   By custom, shuttle crews launch satellites as early in the
flight as possible to have the mission accomplished should they
need to return home early. If that practice was followed on this
mission, the satellite would have been released about seven hours
after liftoff, or about 4 p.m. EDT.
   There was no word, however, from NASA or the Air Force.
   The mission is expected to end Sunday with a landing at Edwards
Air Force Base in California about 10:30 a.m. EDT.
   The shuttle's path, almost perpendicular from its seaside launch
pad, was a confirmation of pre-launch reports that it would travel
on a north-northeast course instead of heading eastward.
   The resulting high-latitude orbit takes it over Poland, the
Soviet Union, Mongolia, China, and parts of the Middle East not
normally covered by eastward-bound shuttles. The satellite is
designed to take highly detailed photographs of troop movements,
military installations and other targets of interest.
   Sources close to the program said the satellite can make small
adjustments to its orbit, a flexibility that would enable it to
respond to changing conditions on the ground.
   The cargo bay reportedly holds a package of scientific
instruments for military research, possibly for the ``Star Wars''
missile defense project.
   Columbia, a veteran of seven flights, ended its last mission in
January 1986, 10 days before the Challenger exploded with a loss of
seven lives.
   ``Any time a vehicle is down for a long period of time it's a
little worrisome,'' said J.R. Thompson, deputy administrator of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. ``There were really
no problems of any significance. The weather was good to us.''
   Columbia's return restored the shuttle fleet to three ships.
Atlantis is scheduled next for launch on Oct. 12, carrying the
Galileo probe to Jupiter, and Discovery is scheduled for another
military mission in November. A replacement for Challenger, the
Endeavour, is to join the fleet in 1992.
   Mission control said Columbia's trajectory was ``right down the
middle of the pike,'' _ a perfect path. The two booster rockets
floated down on parachutes into the Atlantic Ocean, within sight of
recovery ships. Launch was 8:37 a.m., delayed about 40 minutes by
ground fog.
   Not a word was heard publicly from the five astronauts, who are
commanded by Air Force Col. Brewster Shaw, a veteran of two earlier
shuttle flights, including a 1983 trip on Columbia. The other crew
members are Navy Cmdr. Richard Richards, Navy Cmdr. David Leestma,
Army Lt. Col. James Adamson and Air Force Maj. Mark Brown.
   ``We had a completely clean and smooth ascent. There are no
problems whatsoever to report,'' said launch commentator Brian
Welch. And then a news blackout began. Silence will be broken only
if there is a major problem, NASA said. Crew conversation will not
be broadcast.
   The mission is the fifth shuttle flight since launches resumed
last September after a 2{-year hiatus prompted by the Challenger
disaster.
   After the accident, NASA concentrated on modifying the newer
orbiters, Discovery and Atlantis, pirating parts from Columbia.
Discovery and Atlantis each have made two trips into space since
post-Challenger flights resumed.
   During the flight, the astronauts were to check out the safety
modifications made to Columbia, among the 258 changes that were
made.
   ``I think the recovery process is over,'' said Forrest
McCartney, director of the Kennedy Space Center. ``We've modified
all three birds, we've flown all three birds now, and that's
something we can be proud of.''

<DATELINE>KIBBUTZ LOTAN, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Jordanian soldier crossed the
border Tuesday, shot and wounded an American and held an off-duty
Israel soldier hostage for nearly four hours before a sharpshooter
killed him, officials said.
   His victims said the man told them he was avenging a brother or
sister killed by Jews. Military officials said he was deranged and
acted on his own.
   The siege ended when Israeli troops stormed a tool shed where
the attacker held the hostage in a date grove near the Kibbutz
Lotan, a collective farm 12 miles north of the Red Sea resort of
Eilat and a few miles from the rugged mountains of Jordan.
   ``A sniper very cleanly picked him off,'' said Wendy Maayan, the
kibbutz secretary, who immigrated from Minneapolis.
   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, armed forces chief of staff, told army
radio: ``I'm convinced that Jordan still continues to be
responsible so that terrorism would not infiltrate from its borders
into Israel, in spite of such insane soldiers.
   ``In spite of this being a quiet border, both the army and the
civilians are trained to respond quickly to an infiltration. ...
Jordan is doing its best to prevent infiltrations, but sometimes
it's not successful.''
   Israel television said Fatah Uprising claimed responsibility for
the attack, but it did not say where the claim was issued. The
Syrian-backed group is an offshoot of Yasser Arafat's mainstream
Fatah branch of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The wounded woman, Lauren Rosen of Englewood, N.J., said on army
radio she was walking with the soldier and another woman when
``this man in military uniform came out quickly from (behind) a
tree, about three trees ahead of us, with a gun, speaking in
English, something about a brother. He fired one shot and I went to
the ground.''
   Officials at Eilat's Yosef Tal Hospital said she was slightly
wounded by a bullet that passed through her neck.
   The attack occurred on her 25th birthday, she said, and ``I was
very, very lucky. I feel just fine.''
   She said it would not frighten her away from the kibbutz, an
assortment of brown stucco buildings that was founded by American
Reform Jews in 1983 and has about 80 residents, a third of them
U.S. immmigrants. It grows vegetables and dates.
   A Jordanian statement identified the attacker as Farid Ali
Mustafa and said he abandoned a border observation post.
   Armed with a U.S.-made M-16, the man attacked at 11:30 a.m. just
outside the fenced kibbutz.
   The army said hostage soldier Osnat Lev, who is in an army unit
that lives and works on collective farms, was rescued after 3 p.m.
by a special anti-terrorist unit.
   Ms. Maayan said an Israeli soldier fired one shot as other
troops shouted and the attacker came into view through a door of
the corrugated steel shed.
   Ms. Lev said on the radio her attacker kept mentioning a dead
sister and asked the location of Israeli army bases he could attack.
   ``He said all the time that his sister was killed, and why was
she killed, and why I killed her. So I said I did not kill her at
all. He said that the Jews killed her and now he comes to kill
everybody,'' the soldier said.
   The sharpshooter fired into the shed about 500 yards from the
kibbutz fence after soldiers attempted to negotiate with the
attacker for hours, radio reports said.
   Shlomo Tushinsky, a member of the kibbutz council, said the
gunman asked for a Koran, the Moslem holy book, and set a deadline.
   ``A copy of Koran was brought and several minutes after that the
story was over,'' he said. Other kibbutz residents said the Arab
was shot when he bent down to pick up the Koran, borrowed from some
Arab workers.
   Israel radio said there were unconfirmed reports the man asked
for the release of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, the Lebanese Shiite
clergyman whose kidnapping by Israel on July 27 has triggered a
crisis over foreign hostages in Lebanon. Deputy Army Spokesman Col.
Renaan Gissin said there was no connection.
   In Tel Aviv, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the incident
illustrates that Israel faces a more immediate threat from terror
than many other countries.
   ``For us fighting terrorism is a matter of ... life and death,''
he said.
   Two other border incidents this year involved Jordan.
   In May, a Jordanian soldier opened fire on an Israeli patrol,
wounding two Israeli soldiers before he was killed. Jordan later
said he acted on his own. In March, two gunmen crossed the border
and killed an Israeli soldier. A Palestinian guerrilla group
claimed the attack, and Jordan later announced that it had arrested
several men in connection with the incident.

   Leaping lizards were everywhere after a curious
employee at a Dallas museum opened a box of 130 chameleons.
   ``They went all over the place,'' said Amy Jumper, a spokeswoman
for The Science Place. ``Their little sticky feet went up the walls
and on people's arms.''
   The tiny, color-changing reptiles were being kept for children
taking a class on reptiles.
   The reptile roundup went on for days and was not without some
casualties.
   ``Unfortunately,'' Jumper said, ``if you pick them up by their
tails, their tails fall off.''
   The recaptured lizards are regrowing their tails, and some have
gone home to live with young museum patrons.

<HEAD>Two Palestinians Killed, Jewish Settler and Two Sons Mistakenly Shot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 20-year-old Palestinian was shot and killed
Tuesday after he threw a concrete building block at soldiers making
arrests in his village in the occupied West Bank, the army said.
   Also Tuesday, Israeli soldiers shot and wounded a Jewish settler
and his two sons during an accidental exchange of fire in the
occupied West Bank, the army said.
   In the Gaza Strip, soldiers found the body of a Palestinian. He
apparently was stabbed to death by fellow Arabs who suspected him
of collaborating with Israel, Arab reporters said.
   Four Palestinians were wounded in clashes with Israeli troops in
the occupied territories, according to hospital officials. They
said the victims included an 11-year-old in critical condition at a
Nablus hospital with a bullet wound in the chest.
   Meanwhile, an underground Palestinian group said in a leaflet
distributed in the West Bank that funds intended to support the
20-month uprising in the occupied territories were being
``plundered.''
   The leaflet named nine Palestinians who it claimed had misused
up to $5 million in uprising funds and urged the leadership of the
PLO's main Fatah faction to penalize them.
   The leaflet, and other pamphlets circulated recently, reflects
growing factional rivalry in the Arab community as the uprising
continues.
   The uprising's underground leadership called for a strike
Wednesday to mark the 20 months of revolt against Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The territories were
captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   The victim of Tuesday's clash with the army was identified as
Mohammed Mahmoud Jaber of the West Bank village of Burkin.
   Jaber's death raised to 530 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli soldiers and settlers since the uprising began.
Thirty-eight Israelis also have died in the violence.
   Ninety-one Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most
after they were accused of collaborating. The latest victim was
identified as Suleiman Brak Abu Hamad, 45, of Rafah.
   The shooting of the Jewish settler and his sons occurred when
the settler stopped his car near the West Bank village of Bidya and
fired several shots into a grove patrolled by an army unit.
According to military sources, he mistook the troops for
Palestinians about to attack his car.
   The unit responded with fire, wounding the settler who the army
identified as Daniel Hamtzani. The army said Hamtzani was in fair
condition, his 3-year-old son was in serious condition with a
gunshot wound to the head, and an older son suffered light injuries.

<HEAD>Crews Gain Ground As Strategists Brace For More Lightning</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Lightning started more fires Tuesday in the forests of the
Northwest, where nearly a quarter of a million acres have burned in
two weeks, but the humidity was rising and scattered showers aided
weary firefighters.
   ``We had 24,000 lightning strikes in one 24-hour period
throughout the West,'' said Ken Showalter, spokesman for the Boise
Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. ``But we didn't pick up a
lot of fires because there's some marine influence on the weather
and there's been scattered showers with it. The temperatures have
gone down and the humidity is up.''
   The Fire Center, national coordination center for fire
suppression, reported containment of fires that had been burning
over 22,000 acres in the West, mainly in Oregon and California, and
major gains were made against a number of Idaho blazes.
   More than 220,000 acres have been charred in a bout of mostly
lightning-caused fires that began July 26. Manpower throughout the
West still stood at 23,000. But acreage still aflame was cut back
to 160,000 acres Tuesday.
   Even without much rain, the latest weather system sweeping in
from the Pacific did bring higher humidity to the region.
   In hardest-hit Idaho, several dozen residents of the town of
Lowman 70 miles northeast of Boise were allowed back in their homes
Tuesday as firefighters had secured line around 60 percent of the
43,000-acre Lowman Fire that destroyed over $10 million in
structures 10 days ago.
   ``They're letting them back in on the condition they be prepared
to leave immediately again,'' Boise National Forest spokesman Rick
Perkins said. ``A big wind could change the picture real fast.''
   Fire managers on a half dozen other blazes also had secure line
along at least a third of their perimeters.
   ``Each day they get more strength in the lines,'' spokesman
Barry Gay said. ``In general, things are looking good considering.''
   Showers were reported on the Oregon-Idaho border over the
10,000-acre Emmett Complex of fires in the Hell's Canyon area, and
on Monday night light rain pelted Warren, Idaho, which had been
partially evacuated a week ago.
   ``The north side of that fire that was threatening Warren is
secure. The line's held now for five days,'' Payette National
Forest spokesman Brent Botts said.
   Lightning started new fires Tuesday in southwestern Oregon but
firefighters in eastern sections of the state wrapped up work on
two more lightning-caused fires.
   Crews were close to containing the largest of the Oregon fires,
the Canal Fire on the eastern boundary of the Eagle Cap Wilderness
near Enterprise. It had blackened 23,350 acres, most of it in the
Wallowa-Whitman National Forest.
   The Monument Rock Fire, which had burned 12,000 acres of timber
in the Malheur and Wallowa-Whitman national forests in Oregon's
northeastern corner, was contained Monday night, said Liz Rayno, a
Forest Service spokeswoman in Portland. It destroyed three
structures at a remote mine and forced evacuation of campgrounds
and a Forest Service lookout.
   The possibility of more lightning and wind led to posting of
``red flag'' warnings in eastern Washington, although the
thunderstorms did bring some rain. The state's biggest fire was
2,500 acres on the Colville Indian Reservation in the northeastern
corner.
   Crews contained two forest fires that had burned for more than a
week in central and southern California. Both the 15,300-acre Vail
fire in the Cleveland National Forest east of San Diego and the
7,500-acre Balch fire in Sierra National Forest east of Fresno were
declared 100 percent contained Monday evening.
   Crews in Utah had contained the 1,700-acre Chalk Creek blaze
about 45 miles east of Salt Lake City and expected to declared it
controlled by Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Two congressmen who are members of the
Helsinki Commission received official permission Tuesday to enter a
Soviet prison camp notorious for its treatment of dissidents, Perm
Camp 35 in the Ural Mountains.
   Reps. Chris Smith, R-N.J., and Frank Wolf, R-Va., said they got
approval to make the trip Wednesday after meeting with Soviet
Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin and the country's chief prosecutor,
Alexander Sukharev.
   ``Frank Wolf and I are the first two congressman to go to the
Perm camp,'' Smith said in a telephone interview from Moscow.
   ``This, like the other Perm camps, Perm 36 and Perm 36-1, are
notorious for their mistreatment, particularly of political
prisoners,'' Smith said. Perm 35 has housed such prominent
prisoners as Natan Sharansky, who now lives in Israel.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev contends all political
prisoners have been released during his tenure, although human
rights groups believe dissidents remain in harsh labor camps.
   Former prisoners have said confinement at Perm Camp 35, about
1,000 miles from Moscow and 80 miles outside the industrial town of
Perm, includes every-other-day rations of bread and gruel,
bone-chilling cold, isolation cells and new punishments tacked onto
their sentences.
   ``We're trying to make sure there are no prisoners of
conscience, make sure they're treated fairly and adequately,'' said
Wolf.
   Both congressmen think the visit could pressure the Soviets to
eliminate abuses before the Helsinki Conference on Human Rights
convenes in Moscow in 1991.
   ``We're here to promote the general human rights issue,'' said
Smith, who has arranged to meet with Jewish dissidents, members of
the Russian Orthodox church and evangelical Christians since
arriving in Moscow on Friday.
   ``According to people who are in Perm, just our visit helps to
improve things in the short term,'' Smith said. ``If the Soviets
are going to host a conference on human rights and have a very
restrictive and oppressive series of camps of forced labor, we're
going to raise the issue until we get meaningful reforms.''
   The first foreigner to observe Perm 35 conditions, A.M.
Rosenthal, a columnist and former executive editor of The New York
Times, said that despite claims that dissidents have been released,
the camp held ``people who were put in jail for expressing their
opinion or for trying to leave the country, or for doing something
that in a normal society would not be considered a crime.''
   Although Soviet authorities promised the journalist prisoners he
talked to would not be punished, Rosenthal said, ``I have reason to
believe they have retaliated against one quite severely.''
   Smith warned any retribution against Perm prisoners he
interviews would place the Soviets' human rights record ``in a very
bad light.''
   The two originally planned to tour Perm 35 with former White
House counsel Chuck Colson, a former aide to President Richard M.
Nixon who was convicted in the Watergate scandal, but the Soviets
restricted the visit to the lawmakers and a State Department
translator.

<HEAD>Hurricane Dean Downgraded; Causes Little Damage in Newfoundland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Dean moved across
largely unpopulated areas of Newfoundland Tuesday, causing little
damage, and was downgraded to a tropical storm.
   Jim Abraham of the Canadian Hurricane Center in Halifax said
there was concern when it appeared Dean might affect St. John's or
other populated areas but it ``tracked right across good moose
pasture.''
   The cold water of the North Atlantic knocked much of the
strength out of the storm and it lost even more crossing land.
Abraham said Dean would become just another low pressure system
overnight.
   Winds of up to 50 mph whipped up 30 foot waves along
Newfoundland's south coast and fairly heavy rain fell in some
areas, but Abraham said people in the area ``witness this type of
wind several times each winter. If you've ever been to
Newfoundland, the trees along the coast are nothing to write home
about.''
   Eileen Rose, a cook at a restaurant in Grand Falls, central
Newfoundland, said some people were worried when they heard Dean
was on the way, but when it arrived the storm ``didn't last very
long. It wasn't much for damage.''
   Abraham said the storm followed a path about 80 miles wide
across Newfoundland and passed 60 miles north of St. John's. It
came ashore at Harbour Breton on the south coast and returned to
open water at Bonavista on the northeast coast about four hours
later.

<TEXT>
   Panama's U.N. ambassador asked Tuesday for
an urgent meeting of the Security Council to consider ``the policy
of destabilization and coercion pursued by the United States
against Panama.''
   No date was set, but requests for a council meeting usually are
honored within a week or so.
   Ambassador Leonardo A. Kam said in his letter that he sought a
continuation of the council debate held April 28.
   He requested the meeting ``in view of the fact that the United
States troops in Panamanian territory have continued the dangerous
escalation of their acts of intimidation, provocation and
aggression against Panama.''
   Panama's government, controlled by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
the commander of the Defense Forces, accuses U.S. troops stationed
there of instigating civil unrest as a pretext for U.S. military
intervention.
   Noriega was indicted on federal drug charges in Florida in
February 1988. The United States has imposed economic and other
sanctions in an attempt to remove him.
   Panama claims the United States wants to retain control of the
Panama Canal, which is to be turned over to Panama in the year 2000
under treaties signed in 1977.
   In the April debate, Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter
claimed the United States was trying to provoke chaos and disorder
in his country to justify military intervention.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering replied that Panama was
concocting claims of U.S. interference to conceal ``its lack of
freedom and its apparent intention to conduct fraudulent
elections'' that were held May 7.
   Panama's opposition, the Roman Catholic Church and international
observers said the opposition apparently won the election. The
government voided the results.

   Rain was scattered over the West and parts of the South on
Tuesday, dampening some areas that have suffered forest fires, and
temperatures dropped to record lows across the eastern two-thirds
of the nation.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended from southwestern Washington
across northern California, northwestern Nevada and northwestern
Utah.
   Hail fell at higher elevations near Lake Tahoe on the
California-Nevada border, along with locally heavy rain.
   Southern Nevada also had thunderstorms, and 0.35 of an inch of
rain in a short time at Las Vegas caused some street flooding. The
rainfall raised the city's total for the year to 1.66 inches, about
0.8 of an inch below normal for Aug. 8.
   Lightning striking utility poles throughout the Las Vegas Valley
knocked out power for 40,000 customers. Nevada Power Co. spokesman
Murray Westgate said most areas were restored before dawn, but
hundreds of customers remained without power for several hours.
   Showers and thunderstorms also spread across southern Texas,
along the Gulf of Mexico coast and southern Alabama, and from
Florida across Georgia and the South Carolina coast.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
1.37 inches at Tallahassee, Fla.
   Elsewhere, showers were scattered over Lower Michigan and
western New York state.
   Temperatures plunged to record or record-tying lows, mostly in
the 40s and 50s, at more than 90 cities across the eastern
two-thirds of the nation, from Texas to the East Coast and from
North Dakota to Florida.
   The low at the top of Mount Mitchell, N.C., was 35.
   Tuesday's official low for the Lower 48 states was 38 at
Houghton Lake, Mich.
   But at the other extreme, Daytona Beach, Fla., hit a record 97
degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 52
degrees at Johnstown, Pa., to 102 at Gila Bend, Ariz.
   For Wednesday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
along the coast of North Carolina, from southern Georgia across
Florida and the Alabama coast, as well as over Nevada, Utah,
western Wyoming, Idaho, western Montana, eastern Washington and
eastern Oregon.
   High in the 70s were predicted along much of the Pacific Coast,
over south-central Colorado, the Great Lakes, New England, the
northern half of the Appalachians and the central Atlantic Coast;
in the 90s over southern Florida, southern and southwestern Texas,
eastern Montana, western Dakotas and eastern California; near 110
over the desert Southwest; and generally in the 80s over the
remainder of the nation.

   An agreement to disband U.S.-backed
Nicaraguan rebels was praised Tuesday throughout most of Central
America and both sides in El Salvador's civil war said the accords
might help bring peace there.
   But leaders of the rebels, known as Contras, said their fighters
wouldn't disarm until democracy is guaranteed in their homeland.
   ``We're ready to comply with the Tela accords, but it's too
early to talk about giving up our weapons,'' said rebel military
chief Enrique Bermudez in a telephone interview with The Associated
Press.
   The agreement reached Monday by five Central American presidents
in a summit at Tela, Honduras, was a triumph for Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega. He said the accord brought Nicaragua ``to
the gates of peace'' but the nation could not ``let down its guard
until the Contras are disbanded.''
   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
the Bush administration is ``generally supportive'' of the accord
but is skeptical of Nicaragua's commitment to democratic reforms.
He said it was up to the Contras to decide to remain a fighting
force if they don't like the plan to disband them.
   The pact signed by the presidents of Honduras, Nicaragua,
Guatemala, El Salvador and Costa Rica calls for disarming and
disbanding 11,000 Contra guerrillas and 12,000 dependents based in
Honduras within 120 days _ or Dec. 5.
   In return, Nicaragua promised to guarantee democracy, allow the
Contras to return home, and drop a suit in the world court against
Honduras over the Contra bases.
   In El Salvador, government officials and guerrillas praised the
accords Tuesday and said they could contribute to the quest to end
the 10-year-old war there.
   The rebels' Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front said over
its clandesdtine radio station it ``vigorously applauds'' the
agreement. It called the accord ``a victory for revolutionary,
progressive, independent and democratic forces of the region.''
   Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani said he was pleased with
the result of the summit and underscored what he said was Ortega's
commitment to halt Nicarguan support for the Salvadoran rebels..
   Sources close to the talks in Tela said U.S. Secretary of State
James A. Baker III had pressed for a delay until after Nicaragua's
leftist government holds elections scheduled for February.
   But Contra sources said the United States had already been
trying to force rebel leaders to give up the fight and join the
political process.
   Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros bitterly called the accord a
product of ``political confusion'' in Washington.
   The Contras began fighting in 1981, accusing the Sandinistas of
betraying the ideals of the revolution that overthrew President
Anastasio Somoza in July 1979. U.S. non-lethal aid continues to the
rebels, but military aid was suspended in February 1988.
   The scale of the fighting since then has declined so much that
the Sandinista government announced last week it was suspending the
draft.
   The agreement calls for a United Nations-organized observer
commission. U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said he
was studying the ``long and complex'' agreement.
   Bermudez said he would meet with the U.N. commission but no
repatriation could take place ``until the Sandinistas show they are
headed toward democracy.''
   Ortega has set an election for Feb. 25. Last week he got his
domestic political opponents to join in a call for disbandment of
the Contras.
   Members of the Nicaragua opposition on Tuesday attributed the
accord to the thaw between Washington and Moscow, saying reduced
Soviet support was forcing the Sandinistas to compromise.
   ``Neither side is interested in using Third World conflicts to
get at the other any more,'' conservative politician Emilio Alvarez
Montalvan said in Managua, the Nicaraguan capital.
   A source close to President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, who won
the Nobel Prize for starting the peace process two years ago, said
the five presidents went ahead with the agreement because they were
convinced that Nicaragua was serious about democratization.
   Arias noted, however, that previous Central American accords
fell apart and urged his fellow presidents to summon the
``political will'' needed for compliance.
   Honduran political will is a key factor because only the
Hondurans can cut off the Contras' U.S. supply lifeline to border
camps.
   Honduras has wanted to be rid of the Contra problem ever since
U.S. military aid was withdrawn but also insists Honduras can enjoy
peaceful borders only when Nicaragua becomes a democracy.
   Like most Central Americans, the Hondurans are weary of the
fighting that has occupied their minds and sapped their economies
for a decade.
   Most commentators in Honduras hailed President Jose Azcona Hoyo,
although the conservative newspaper La Prensa called the agreement
one-sided: ``It's clear what the Sandinistas got. It's not
absolutely clear what they gave up.''
   Bermudez said Contra fighters would face three choices if the
accord goes through: Exile, return to Nicaragua peacefully, or keep
fighting inside Nicaragua.
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, as did other sources, Contra
officials said they feared some fighters would not give up no
matter what and would return to Nicaragua in small bands that would
be massacred by the Sandinista army.
   ``In any case, we have to consult the fighting men and see what
they want to do,'' Bermudez said.
   A Contra official said U.S. funding for the group's Miami office
was cut from $262,000 a month to $24,000, with more than 100 people
laid off. He accused U.S. officials of trying to force Contra
leaders back into Nicaragua. ``We don't have more than five people
left,'' said Xavier Arguello, a Contra adviser in Miami.
   Staffing at offices in Costa Rica also has been severely cut,
Contra officials said.

   Firefighters Tuesday doused a rubbish fire
that had buckled a section of a major highway, while a judge
ordered the dump where the waste was found to remove garbage piled
beneath two busy roadways.
   A two-judge appeals panel ordered Hub Recycling and Scrap Metals
Co. to refuse any more construction waste until a lower court can
decide whether the facility poses a threat to the community.
   The judges also told Hub Recycling to clean out materials that
lie beneath the highways _ Interstate 78 and U.S. Route 22 _ and
not place new waste under the roads.
   Flames and heat from a pile of debris Monday buckled an elevated
portion of Interstate 78, a critical east-west link with New York
in one of the nation's busiest highway interchanges. State
officials say repairs could take a year.
   Gov. Thomas Kean lauded the decision by the Appellate Division
of Superior Court, saying it would pave the way for a cleanup at
the site, which state officials say is an illegal landfill.
   ``With our hands no longer tied, we can begin to clean up this
mess and make sure the disaster doesn't get worse,'' he said.
   Kean declared an emergency, allowing New Jersey to ask for
federal help in paying for the repairs to the highway.
   Fire officials, using bulldozers to reach buried pockets of
flame, said they had extinguished the blaze, which on Monday
threatened to spread toward Route 22, now the main alternate to
motorists using Interstate 78.
   ``Basically, the fire is out, but there's always the possibility
of something being buried that wasn't knocked out,'' said Larry
Krieger, a fire department spokesman.
   Fire officials are investigating arson, and the state attorney
general's office has opened a criminal investigation.
   State officials allege Hub was dumping materials illegally, and
said they have been trying for months to halt the piling up of
waste at the four-acre site.
   ``The events of the last 36 hours demonstrate that the existence
of this facility poses an imminent threat to the area,'' said
Assistant Attorney General Michael S. Caro. He added that piles of
garbage at the site hindered firefighters' and emergency workers'
access to the dump.

<HEAD>Fatah Congress Calls For More Military Action Against Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fifth congress of Fatah, the main
group in the Palestine Liberation Organization, closed Tuesday with
a call for increased military action to end Israeli occupation of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   More than 1,000 members of Fatah rejected Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's plan for elections in the occupied territories.
Fatah is led by PLO chairman Yasser Arafat.
   The delegates approved a resolution calling for
``intensification of the armed struggle and all other forms of
battle to put an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian
territories.''
   Hard-liners had pressed the congress to recommend extending the
armed struggle beyond the West Bank and Gaza. Arafat's recent
declaration that military action would be confined to the occupied
territories helped the PLO open a dialogue with the United States,
Israel's chief supporter.
   The Fatah resolution, distributed by the Palestinian news agency
WAFA, did not say what kind of military operations might be
conducted outside the occupied lands or define ``all other forms of
battle.''
   Under Shamir's election plan, Palestinian delegates would be
chosen to negotiate with Israel.
   Fatah said elections must be held in ``a democratic atmosphere
under international supervision after the withdrawal of Israeli
forces ... as part of a global plan for a definitive solution to
the Israeli-Arab conflict.''
   The congress repeated its call for an international conference
on Middle East peace, continuing dialogue with the United States
and talks with ``democratic Israeli forces'' who oppose the
occupation and ``support the inalienable rights of the Palestinian
people.''

<HEAD>Bill Baird Closes Pioneering Boston Abortion Referral Clinic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A longtime abortion rights activist said Tuesday
he has closed his abortion referral clinic because he can't afford
to keep it open, and claimed he has been pushed aside by some
feminist groups and Planned Parenthood.
   Bill Baird, 57, who has lobbied for abortion rights for almost
27 years, said he is bitter about the circumstances surrounding his
departure from Boston, where he established his clinic in 1967.
   He retains abortion referral clinics in Hempstead and Hauppage
on New York state's Long Island. Like Planned Parenthood, the
clinics perform pregnancy tests and refer patients to doctors who
perform abortions.
   ``I emptied everything out Saturday,'' said Baird. ``We wept and
hugged each other and I put a sign out front saying `We Shall
Return.' I think there's something immoral about the original
pioneer being forced out because he can't come up with the rent.''
   Baird said his main source of revenue, college campus lectures,
has been effectively cut off by anti-abortion activists.
   ``I've been very badly hurt by a successful campaign by
anti-abortion forces who threatened to picket or bomb colleges or
universities where I appeared,'' he said.
   Baird also said women's rights groups have resented his work on
their behalf.
   He recounted his appearance onstage at a women's rights rally
when he was asked to leave because he was a man.
   Baird also accused Planned Parenthood and its president, Faye
Wattleton, of attempting to freeze him out of the abortion rights
movement.
   Wattleton did not return calls by The Associated Press to her
New York office Tuesday.
   Baird said he was recently heartened when he was asked to be the
keynote speaker at the New England Collegiate Conference on Nov. 2.
He hopes to tour college campuses again this winter and revive his
crusade.
   He said he and his staff plan to work for a national right to
privacy amendment and want to pressure U.S. marshals into escorting
women to abortion clinics to prevent harassment by anti-abortion
activists.
   Baird began his crusade in the early 1960s, inspired, he said,
by a woman who died in his arms after a self-inflicted abortion
attempt with an coat hanger.
   Baird served three months in prison for distributing
contraceptives. His Hempstead clinic was firebombed in 1979. In
1971, he was arrested on a charge of corrupting a minor for giving
a lecture on birth control before an audience that included a woman
who had brought along her 14-month-old child.

<HEAD>N.J. Supreme Court: False Obituary Not Necessarily Libel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled Tuesday
that publication of a living woman's obituary did not necessarily
harm her reputation and thus does not constitute libel.
   The high court affirmed two lower court rulings against a family
that sued the Princeton Packet, which in 1985 published the
obituary of a woman who had not died.
   The publication is not defamatory because the reported death of
an individual does not impugn someone's reputation, the court said
in an unanimous opinion.
   ``Death is a natural state and demeans no one,'' the court said.
   One year after publication of the false obituary of Marcy
Decker, the woman, her son and her mother sued for defamation and
emotional distress.
   The onetime Princeton resident said the emotional effects
contributed to the loss of her job and aided her ex-husband's legal
battle to gain custody of the couple's child.
   Ms. Decker and her mother also claimed embarrassment and anxiety
due to the publication of the obituary in the bi-weekly paper.
   The court said the woman would not have legal redress unless the
newspaper falsely reported demeaning circumstances surrounding the
death. Moreover, the court noted, the Packet acted properly by
promptly publishing a retraction.
   ``The publication of the death notice did not impute to the
plaintiff any wrong and did not hold her up to ridicule,'' the
court said.
   The seventh member of the court, Chief Justice Robert Wilentz,
did not participate in the case.

   More than 3,000 people are preparing to leave a
small area of the Russian republic where increased radiation has
doubled the amount of illness since the 1986 nuclear disaster at
Chernobyl, Tass said Tuesday.
   ``One local manager reported that the gamma level at his home
was 10 times higher than permissible levels, despite
decontamination and special sanitary measures, hence a sick rate
which has doubled in the region over the past three years,'' the
official news agency said.
   It did not specify the illnesses. The dispatch came from
Bryansk, about 210 miles from Chernobyl, the regional center for an
area including the 12 villages to be evacuated.
   Tass said scientists assured the villagers in 1986 they could
stay if the area was properly decontaminated, but ``experience
proved them wrong, and now, more than three years after the
disaster, people are preparing to move.''
   Villagers are awaiting final approval from government officials,
Tass said.
   In the past three years, residents of the 12 villages have been
careful to step on asphalt rather than grass because the
concentration of radiation is higher in grass, and have had food
brought in, the agency reported.
   They no longer keep cattle for fear of contamination in the meat
and milk, it said.
   The report follows a dispute between the government and
scientists in neighboring Byelorussia about further evacuations
from the area around the nuclear power plant.
   Government officials in Byelorussia, north of Chernobyl, say
11,000 more people should be moved, but scientists say 106,000
should be evacuated based on radiation levels in the area.
   About 130,000 were evacuated from around the plant in the
northern Ukraine after an explosion and fire in its No. 4 reactor
on April 26, 1986, killed 31 people and released a cloud of
radioactive material that circled the globe.
   The 12 villages lie within a small part of the Russian republic
that borders Byelorussia and the Ukraine near Chernobyl. Most of
those evacuated so far have been from the Ukraine and Byelorussia.

   A suspect in eight bank robberies around the
country has told investigators he plotted to kill President Bush
and attended several of his appearances, including one in Michigan,
authorities said Tuesday.
   John Spencer Daughetee, 34, was arrested Friday in Oakland,
Calif., during a bank robbery. He told investigators he had robbed
at least seven other banks and plotted to assassinate Bush, said
Sgt. Sam Maddux, an Oakland robbery investigator.
   ``He admitted that at some point he started hearing voices and
that he has been following the president around the U.S. in an
effort to get close enough to kill him,'' Maddux said Tuesday. ``He
admits carrying guns on his person, a .22-caliber automatic handgun
and a .380-caliber automatic handgun.''
   Maddux said Daughetee, believed to be from Flora, Ind., said
during interviews with Oakland police and FBI agents that he was in
a crowd of about 4,000 people who attended Bush's speech in the
Detroit enclave of Hamtramck on April 17.
   ``I think there was some indication that he was close to the
president in Detroit,'' Maddux said. ``But security was very tight.
... Because of the need for some type of ID, he wasn't allowed in.''
   WXYZ-TV in Detroit reported that Daughetee had staked out a
position the night before Bush's speech, but couldn't get to it
because he would have had to pass through a metal detector.
   The station also said Daughetee found a spot in a house with a
line of sight but couldn't get positioned before the president
finished his speech.
   Maddux said Daughetee confessed to a bank robbery spree dating
back to November 1986, beginning with a bank in Sacramento, Calif.
Maddux said the other banks Daughetee admitted to robbing were in
Miami; Charlotte, N.C.; Baltimore; Portland, Ore.; San Francisco,
where he hit two on Friday, and Oakland.

<HEAD>Summit Accords Seen as Propitious for Salvador Peace</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Central America</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Both sides in El Salvador's
10-year-old civil war on Tuesday praised the peace accords signed
by five Central American presidents and said they could contribute
to the search for peace here.
   The high command of the rebel Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, or FMLN, said it ``vigorously applauds'' the
accords.
   The presidents of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica
and Nicaragua on Monday signed an agreement for demobilizing within
120 days the Nicaraguan rebels based in Honduras.
   The presidents also exhorted the Salvadoran government and FMLN
to negotiate a solution to the war, which has killed an estimated
70,000 people.
   In a communique over their clandestine radio station, the
Salvadoran rebels called the accords ``a victory for revolutionary,
progressive, independent and democratic forces of the region.''
   President Alfredo Cristiani, who took office June 1, said he was
pleased with the results of the three-day session in the Honduran
port of Tela.
   ``For the first time the Salvadoran problem has been given this
level of consideration by the presidents, who commit themselves to
contribute to peace in El Salvador,'' he said.
   He underscored what he said was a commitment by Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega to halt his leftist government's support
for the FMLN.
   However, unlike sections of the accords dealing with Nicaragua,
no procedure was specified for verifying or enforcing the
Salvadoran provisions.
   Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, chief of the joint chiefs of staff,
nevertheless called the accords ``a big political defeat for the
FMLN.''
   The accords ``vehemently urge'' the FMLN to agree to an
``immediate and effective cease-fire.'' The rebels, in Tuesday's
broadcast, did not respond to that demand.
   Guillermo Ungo, president of the Democratic Revolutionary Front,
said it was positive that El Salvador's conflict was recognized at
the summit.
   Cristiani had indicated he would try to link demobilization of
the Contras to demobilization of the FMLN during the summit. Ungo
and other leftist leaders applauded his decision not to do that.
   Eduardo Colindres, former chief of staff to Christian Democrat
Jose Napoleon Duarte, who preceded Cristiani as president, also
considered the Tela accords positive.
   ``They oblige Cristiani to fulfill commitments to strengthening
democracy,'' he said.
   Both Ungo and Colindres noted the opposition's recent efforts to
get negotiations going between the government and the FMLN.
   Cristiani, of the rightist Arena party, in his inaugural address
offered to talk with the FMLN, but proposed a non-governmental
commission for such talks. The rebels rejected that mechanism as
dilatory and doomed to failure.
   Upon his return from Honduras Monday night the president said he
now is willing to enter into a direct dialogue with the rebels.

<TEXT>
   The National Wildlife Federation on Tuesday
asked a federal judge to force the Commerce Department to require
Gulf Coast shrimpers to equip their nets with turtle excluder
devices.
   The department's temporary new regulations limiting trawl times
do not protect endangered sea turtles as the department claims, the
federation argued.
   The federation said it has learned that Commerce Secretary
Robert Mosbacher has data from National Marine Fisheries Service
scientists that demonstrates the mortality rate from a 105-minute
tow time is more than four times greater than what the secretary
has admitted.
   Mosbacher on Monday promulgated regulations requiring shrimpers
to lift their nets every 105 minutes to let any captured turtles
escape.
   ``A recent report from the team of scientists charged with
managing recovery efforts for the severely endangered Kemp's Ridley
sea turtle states unequivocally that the species is physiologically
unable to withstand tow times in lieu of of required (excluder)
use,'' the federation said in its petition to U.S. District Judge
Thomas Hogan.
   Hogan is overseeing the federation's legal attack on Mosbacher's
failure to require excluder devices.
   Commerce spokesman Reed Boatright said he did not want to
comment on the lawsuit now that Hogan has a new petition before him.
   Hogan last week ordered Mosbacher to adopt regulations of some
sort by Monday to protect sea turtles from drowning in shrimpers'
nets.
   A new federal law last year requires shrimpers to use excluder
devices _ big boxes attached to nets with hinged sides that turtles
can swim through _ unless the secretary of commerce has good reason
to require other protective measures.
   The trawling regulation is to last only until Sept. 7 while the
department solicits comment on what permanent regulations to adopt
``in light of conservation needs of sea turtle populations and the
economics of the shrimp fishing industry.''
   Mosbacher's decided July 24 to suspend requirements for excluder
devices after Texas and Louisiana shrimpers protested their use by
blockading Gulf Coast shipping channels. The shrimpers argue that
the devices reduce their catch by as much as a third.
   About 40 people organized by Greenpeace protested the trawling
rules in front of the Commerce Department Tuesday morning, chanting
``Mosbacher, Mosbacher, hear our plea, save the turtles in the
sea,'' and carrying posters with slogans like ``Shrimpers are
crying but turtles are dying.''
   Faced with Mosbacher's suspension, the state of Florida decided
to proceed on its own. Gov. Bob Martinez and his cabinet on Tuesday
unanimously approved new regulations requiring vessels more than 25
feet long using Florida waters to use excluder devices, and shorter
vessels to limit trawls to 90 minutes. The governor and cabinet
rejected requests for a delay to permit a court challenge.
   Atlantic Coast shrimpers largely have agreed to use the devices,
environmentalists say.

   The floating oil rig that capsized in
the Gulf of Mexico last week, killing as many as 10 men, had
toppled before, its owner said Tuesday.
   ``I learned after buying it that it turned over at sea trial,''
said Avis Bourg Jr., owner of the Avco 5 ``liftboat.'' The rig was
modified after that accident, he said.
   Bourg was the first witness at a hearing by the Coast Guard and
the National Transportation Safety Board into the July 31 accident,
in which the boat-like rig overturned as it headed for shore to
escape Hurricane Chantal.
   A fishing boat and helicopter rescued four people. Divers for
Chevron, which leased the rig from Bourg, later recovered four
bodies. The Coast Guard and Chevron abandoned the search with six
still missing.
   At the hearing, Capt. Jesse Morton gave the first public
description of the 15-foot seas that knocked the vessel over and
almost drowned him.
   ``The next thing I know, I was up to my neck in water in the
wheelhouse,'' Morton testified.
   ``I started calling maydays. A surge blew me out the top of the
wheelhouse, sucked me in and blew me out again.
   Morton, 30, of Franklinton, said he managed to swim to a
lifeboat that was tied to the barge-like rig. Then he tried to swim
to the capsized rig, but the waves kept knocking him back.
   He said he saw three others get out of the rig. By then the boat
was completely on its side.
   A shrimp boat picked up Morton and two others, and the Coast
Guard rescued a fourth.
   Bourg said he bought the Avco 5 two years ago. He later learned
it had capsized while being tested for seaworthiness eight years
ago. The man he bought the boat from claimed to have spent $700,000
repairing the rig after the accident, Bourg said.
   Chevron attorney Bob Reish asked Bourg if he was concerned about
the stability of the boat.
   ``No, I was not,'' Bourg answered.
   After the accident, the Coast Guard said liftboats have a record
of instability and a new inspection program began the day the Avco
5 overturned.
   The hearing is expected to last all week. Survivors of the
accident and rig owners are expected to testify.
   The rig is a floating platform with retractable legs. It can
move through Gulf waters on its own power or extend its legs 100
feet to the sea bottom when it reaches a drilling site.
   At the time of the accident, it had been on a job about 25 miles
off Morgan City to work on oil pipes on the sea bottom.

<TEXT>
   San Francisco Bay area residents were
jolted awake Tuesday by a sharp earthquake that broke windows,
toppled groceries and startled a man into falling to his death from
a fifth-story apartment window.
   The quake occurred as state and federal emergency services
officials prepared to conduct a two-day test of their response to a
catastrophic earthquake.
   The quake, which hit with a jolt and rolled for 10 seconds,
caused only minor structural damage, but was felt as far away as
San Luis Obispo, about 230 miles south of San Francisco and in
Sonoma County, 60 miles to the north.
   The temblor struck at 1:13 a.m. and measured 5.2 on the Richter
scale of ground motion. It was centered on the San Andreas fault
about 15 miles south of San Jose.
   A moderate aftershock measuring 4.2 on the Richter scale struck
at 1:44 a.m., followed by a second, stronger aftershock that
measured 4.5 at 8:53 a.m., according to the U.S. Geological Survey
in Menlo Park.
   ``I thought all my windows were going to break,'' said Margaret
Dunlap of San Francisco. ``My whole bed was shaking.''
   In Los Gatos, where the quake was centered, police reported that
Matthew James Bignall, 19, accidentally jumped from his bedroom
window after apparently being startled awake by the earthquake.
   Bignall died of multiple injuries, according to a spokeswoman
with the Santa Clara County coroner's office.
   Residents reported some broken windows and items falling off
shelves but no major problems, a Los Gatos police dispatcher said.
Damage was confined mostly to Santa Clara and northern Santa Cruz
counties, according to the state Office of Emergency Services in
Sacramento.
   Experts warned that the seismic activity signals an increased
chance that a severe earthquake will strike the area during the
next week.
   ``It certainly shows us the fault is becoming more active,''
said Andy Michael, a USGS geophysicist, who said the quake was the
largest in the area since 1969.
   ``The stress is building up in the earth and we're going to
start getting large earthquakes,'' said Michael. ``It should serve
as a reminder to prepare.''
   Dave Shea, 21, spent more than an hour cleaning up the paint
store he manages in Los Gatos, where about 20 cans fell off shelves
and four quarts of paint splattered on the floor.
   ``It made a nice little splotch mess,'' he said, estimating
damage at about $300.
   The false ceiling in a vacant Los Gatos business came down, and
about half a dozen businesses reported broken windows, police said.
One of the front windows of a grocery store blew out, according
Sharon Sieker, an assistant manager at the Safeway. She said she
found ``red wine all over the floor'' when she arrived about 2 a.m.
   Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. and Pacific Bell reported no major
problems as a result of the quake.
   The earthquake drill involved a mock temblor in the Bay area in
which 5,000 people die.
   Marilyn Quayle, wife of Vice President Dan Quayle, was in
Sacramento to attend the first day of the test. When she woke up at
5:30 a.m. and saw coverage of the actual earthquake on television,
she thought it was part of the exercise.
   ``I thought, `Gee, this is pretty interesting. They have the
(earthquake) simulation on television already,''' Mrs. Quayle said.
   The open-ended Richter scale is a measure of the energy released
by an earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a
seisomograph.
   San Francisco's Great Quake, which occurred in 1906 before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3. Recent
estimates say more than 2,000 people died in the quake and the fire
it touched off, which burned much of the city.
   Each increase of one number, as in a jump from magnitude 5.5 to
6.5, means that the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of
3.5 can cause slight damage in populated areas, while a quake of
6.0 can cause severe damage. In March 1964 an earthquake in Alaska
hit 8.5 on the Richter scale, killing 114 people.

<TEXT>
   U.S. soldiers detained 29 Panamanians
who entered a restricted military area Tuesday and released them
after confiscating their weapons, a spokeswoman for the U.S.
Southern Command reported.
   She said among those briefly detained were 10 officers and
troopers of the Panamanian Defense Forces, including Maj. Manuel
Sieiro. He is a brother in-law of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega who
is commander of the Defense Force and controls the government.
   The spokeswoman, Mercedes Morris, said five Panamanian
journalists were among the civilians in the group.
   She said in a telephone interview the Panamanians were detained
because ``they ventured without authorization into a military
zone'' reserved exclusively for American forces.
   Ms. Morris said about 40 U.S. Marines were conducting ``a
reconnaissance exercise on roads'' leading to the Panama Canal when
the Panamanians entered the area in 15 vehicles.
   A number of submachine guns, rifles and pistols were confiscated
and will be returned to the Defense Forces through a
U.S.-Panamanian coordinating commission in charge of handling
problems related to the security and defense of the canal, Ms.
Morris said.
   She said the Panamanians were detained for about 1 hour and 15
minutes.
   Ms. Morris was asked if the Panamanians were held at gunpoint
and she said, ``The necessary security measures required in this
case were taken.'' She refused to give further details.
   Mayor Alberto de Santis of the town of Arraijan, 9 miles west of
Panama City and near the site where the incident occurred, said the
Panamanians were ``stopped at gunpoint'' by the Marines and held
for 2 hours and 45 minutes.
   He told reporters about 100 people demonstrated against the
American troops as they passed through the town in six armored
vehicles. The Panamaninan vehicles then appeared and followed the
Americans, according to the mayor.
   He said that at a jungle area a few miles outside of town the
American vehicles turned around and the Marines surrounded the
Panamanians ``at gunpoint'' and detained them.
   Sieiro is Defense Forces commander for the Chorrera military
area, a few miles west of the capital and in the area where the
incident took place.
   A Defense Forces spokesman declined comment on the indicent.
   The Panamanian journalists asked that they not be identified by
name.
   The incident is the latest in a series of confrontations between
American and Panamanian troops in recent months.
   Noriega was indicted in February 1988 by two federal grand
juries in Florida on drug trafficking and money laundering charges.
The U.S. imposed economic sanctions against Panama last year when
Noriega refused to step down.
   Most of the incidents between Panamanian and U.S. troops
involved the exchange of a few shots at nighttime and the
occasional detention for a brief period of Americans by Panamanian
police for alleged traffic violations. No one has been reported
hurt.
   Noriega has accused the United States of trying to force him to
resign and replace him with a ``docile'' government to avoid
turning the canal over to Panama by the years 2000 as stipulated in
treaties signed in 1977.
   The American Southern Command insists it has the right to
conduct military exercises in defense of the canal under the
treaties.
   The pro-Noriega news media calls the exercises a provocation.

   A fire raged out of control for three hours
and gutted a dilapidated rooming house Tuesday, forcing tenants to
swing from ropes and leap to neighboring roofs because there were
no exterior fire escapes. Three people were killed, and at least
five remained unaccounted for.
   The city had previously filed a criminal complaint against the
owner of the Ben Crest rooming house for failing to install a
sprinkler system; a lawyer for the owner said installation of
sprinklers was to have begun next week.
   Rescuers aided by a crane brought in to clear rubble from the
four-story brick building recovered two bodies by Tuesday night but
neither had been identified, said police Lt. Richard Hogan.
   The search was suspended shortly before 7 p.m. and was not
expected to resume until late Wednesday morning, he said. The cause
of the blaze was still being investigated.
   Early estimates put the number of registered guests and visitors
at about 37, and initial reports indicated at least five people
were unaccounted for, Hogan said.
   Survivors said an alarm failed to sound.
   ``I pulled on the fire alarm, and it broke right off in my
hand,'' said Dwayne Rogers, 25, a fourth-floor resident who tried
to wake other tenants before escaping to an adjacent roof with Leo
McDonnell, 46.
   ``We saw a couple of people that couldn't reach the roof, and
they got torched,'' Rogers said.
   McDonnell and Rogers said they lost one elderly man they had
awakened on their way out.
   ``I turned around and Scottie wasn't there,'' McDonnell said.
``There wasn't anything more we could do.''
   Thirty-five of the 40 rooms were rented Monday night, officials
said.
   Deputy Fire Chief William Conway said the city encourages
exterior fire escapes, but they are not required. He said if there
is no fire escape outside the window of a room, ropes are an
acceptable alternative.
   Seven tenants and two police officers were injured, said police
Capt. Fred McGovern, and Conway said at least seven firefighters
were injured, three seriously.
   The most seriously injured was a firefighter who broke his hip
in a two-story fall while trying to rescue a woman who froze with
fear at her window.
   Fire Chief Curt Numberg said that when he arrived on the scene
about 12:30 a.m., ``people were jumping out of windows ... climbing
down on ropes that knotted up and never reached bottom.''
   Tenants said screams filled the night.
   ``It wasn't screams of help, it was more like screams of
burning,'' said Bobby Barrett, 19.
   One victim died at the feet of the first officer on the scene
after jumping from a second-story window to escape the flames,
McGovern said. The other two confirmed casualties were visible to
firefighters through upper-story windows.
   Al DiVirgilio, mayor of this decaying city of 80,000 on the
seacoast five miles north of Boston, said two criminal complaints
were pending against the rooming house. One citation involved an
illegal woodshop in the basement of the building, which housed
retail space on the first floor.
   The other, however, involved the owner's failure to install a
sprinkler system required under a 2-year-old city ordinance adopted
after a 1984 rooming house fire in Beverly that killed 15, the
mayor said.
   The Ben Crest's owner, Leo Allard of Nahant, has been battling
the ordinance in court. Allard refused to comment Tuesday on
anything relating to the ordinance or the fire.
   His attorney, James E. Smith, said his client and other rooming
house owners were only seeking reasonable time to install sprinkler
systems, and he said work on a system at the Ben Crest was due to
begin next week.
   Second-floor resident Richard Stokes, 53, nursed his right hand
which was raw and sore from sliding down a rope.
   ``I could only hold on about half-way, so I jumped the rest of
the way,'' Stokes said.

<HEAD>Newspapers Praise U.S.-Mexico Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexican newspapers said Tuesday a visit by
senior Bush administration officials marked a new cordiality in
relations with the United States, but some said it could be just a
honeymoon between new governments.
   Secretary of State James Baker III headed a delegation of 40
U.S. officials, including four Cabinet members, at talks with
Mexican officials Monday.
   Baker was quoted as saying no friendship was more important to
the United States than that with Mexico.
   The unusually large delegation followed the Bush
administration's support of Mexico in reaching an agreement with
foreign creditor banks on reduction of its $107 billion foreign
debt.
   ``A spirit of greater understanding toward Mexico was expressed.
... There is hope that this meeting is the beginning of a new
era,'' El Universal newspaper wrote.
   In a front-page editorial, the daily Uno mas Uno said,
``Evidently relations are on a very distinct level from the tension
that characterized relations with the government of Ronald Reagan.''
   Reagan administration officials frequently accused Mexico of
failing to take sufficient action to stop drug trafficking, of
official corruption and of failing to support U.S. policies in
Central America.
   But the left-leaning La Jornada, the newspaper most critical of
the Mexican government and the United States, said both
administrations were new and there hadn't been time to discover
more profound differences.
   Excelsior, one of Mexico's largest newspapers, questioned the
depth of the new harmony.
   ``Will all this be reality or just ... wishful thinking?'' asked
columnist Miguel Barbarena.
   He said that on Monday both sides skirted thorny issues such as
Central America and illegal Mexican aliens in the United States. He
said the talks produced nothing concrete in narcotics control or
financial questions.
   An editorial in the same paper said, ``The dangers persist that
bilateral relations will take a distinct turn from what is
anticipated.''
   In the weeks leading up to the debt settlement, Salinas took
numerous steps to assuage Washington's major complaints. Corrupt
union leaders were arrested, a drug kingpin was jailed and foreign
investment restrictions were relaxed.

<HEAD>First Woman Corps of Cadet Captain Picked at West Point</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST POINT, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A female cadet from Virginia has become
the first woman in the history of the U.S. Military Academy to be
selected as captain of the corps of cadets, a West Point spokesman
said Tuesday.
   Kristin Baker, 21, of Burke, Va., will be the commander of West
Point's brigade of 4,400 cadets for the academic year starting Aug.
17. She'll be responsible for the overall performance of the cadets
and serve as commander of the future military officers during
ceremonies.
   According to Maj. Ed Evans, chief of command information at the
military academy, Baker was selected by West Point Superintendent
Lt. Gen. Dave R. Palmer based on her academic achievements,
leadership qualities, athletic performance and extracurricular
activities.
   ``You are constantly being rated by your peers, by your
superiors here from the moment you arrive as a plebe,'' Evans said.
``It's the whole person that's looked at.''
   According to Evans, Baker has a 3.36 grade point average in her
major, human factors psychology. In her first three years at West
Point, Baker was on the cadet soccer and cross country ski teams
and was a member of the academy's Roman Catholic choir.
   Baker is the daughter of Col. Robert Baker, a 1966 West Point
graduate now stationed at the Army's Yuma Proving Grounds in
Arizona.
   She follows in some famous footsteps. Among the other captains
of West Point's corps of cadets were World War II hero Douglas
MacArthur in 1902; William Westmoreland, the Army's future chief
commander during Vietnam War, in 1936; and Pete Dawkins, a Heisman
Award-winning football player at West Point, in 1959.
   Women cadets were first admitted to West Point in 1976.

<HEAD>US Rejects Tying Frozen Assets to Hostages</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS grafs 17-19 bgng: ``Although the,'' to clarify that
Iran claims money outside the jurisdiction of the tribunal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States on Tuesday rejected any
suggestion tying the fate of American hostages in Lebanon to
billions of dollars of Iranian assets frozen in this country for
nearly a decade.
   ``The questions of the assets have no connection or linkage
whatsoever with the hostage issue,'' State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher said at a briefing for reporters.
   Boucher's comments came in response to a report in the
English-language Tehran Times, which quoted a source as saying Iran
would definitely intercede to gain the release of the hostages if
Washington gave assurances it would release frozen Iranian assets.
   U.S. assurances that the assets will be released ``should be
concrete and there should be convincing grounds that these
proposals will be translated into action,'' the unidentified source
told the newspaper.
   At the White House, meanwhile, presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said:
   ``There have been a good many messages back and forth between
the United States and Iran through various intermediaries over the
last many days. We won't comment on the specifics and wouldn't
comment on whether or not they mentioned the assets in particular.''
   But he added that Rafsanjani ``has mentioned that publicly
before, so it's not a secret matter and we've answered it publicly
before, and since then I would say that there's no change on either
side in that equation.''
   Boucher, repeating the long-held U.S. position, said the assets
were in no way related to eight American hostages who are believed
to be held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems in Lebanon.
   He said that U.S. officials continue with their ``intensive
diplomatic efforts'' to free the hostages.
   Boucher noted that claims against the assets are pending before
the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.
   The tribunal, set up in 1981 after Iran freed American hostages
held at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, has carried out its work in a
non-political environment, officials said.
   ``What is really unique is that it is resolving a whole host, a
class, of tough technical issues between all kinds of claimants,''
said one department official who, like others, asked that he not be
identified.
   Since it was established, the tribunal _ composed of nine
international judges _ has resolved billions of dollars worth of
claims stemming from the rupture in diplomatic relations between
the two nations in 1979.
   At the time, the United States froze Iranian assets, including
hundreds of millions of dollars worth of military equipment
purchased by Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi before his regime was
toppled. Iran also seized U.S. assets, many belonging to American
firms.
   When the tribunal was established in 1981, the United States
transferred $9.9 billion in frozen assets to its supervision. Some
$3.8 billion was transferred to Iran, with the rest going to
various escrow accounts under the tribunal, the State Department
said.
   Interest on the escrow accounts amounts to more than $1.3
billion, the department said.
   Although the United States has little control over assets
controlled by the tribunal, Iran has made claims against the
Washington for other money, specifically for military hardware it
says was paid for but not received.
   Iran now claims claims that money amounts to $12 billion. The
State Department said it could not determined the amount the shah
paid upfront for equipment. The shah had contracted for $20 billion
in equipment by 1979, the department said.
   In August 1979, the revolutionary government of Iran announced
that it was cancelling $9 billion worth of arms contracts with the
United States.
   Officials said the tribunal has settled scores of claims,
ranging from those made by individuals to those made by the
respective governments. U.S. nationals have been awarded about $1.2
billion through August 1989, and the tribunal has awarded about
$118 million in cases brought by Iranian nationals, the department
said.
   Iran has generally adhered to the tribunal's decisions, making
payments t claimants when ordered to do so, officials said. Some
American companies, however, have appealed the tribunal's decision
in U.S. courts, effectively delaying payments, they said.
   The report in the Tehran Times echoed earlier statements by
Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's president and formerly the country's
parliamentary speaker.
   In early 1987, Rafsanjani brought up the issue several times,
saying Iran would intercede on behalf of the hostages if Iran's
frozen assets were released.

   The race for mayor of this glittering,
crime-plagued Southern capital became a one-man show Tuesday when
former Mayor Maynard Jackson's only opponent quit the campaign.
   ``I have decided that my greatest service now is to ensure that
this campaign does not divide our city's families,'' said Michael
Lomax, the Fulton County Commission chairman.
   Lomax told reporters he believed he might have been able to win
by pounding on the crime issue that has been his major campaign
theme.
   But, he said, ``I felt that it would have been too costly a
victory, and that's why I stepped aside.''
   He stopped short of endorsing Jackson, but said he pledged to
work with him. ``I have extended the olive branch,'' he said. ``I
believe he will be generous enough of spirit to receive it.''
   The non-partisan election is Oct. 3 to succeed Mayor Andrew
Young, who cannot serve a third consecutive term.
   Lomax spokesman Jim Gray said earlier Tuesday that Lomax decided
to quit the race because of his poor showing in recent polls.
   ``The decision has been made that Michael just can't win. Even
though the gap has narrowed, it hasn't narrowed enough,'' Gray said.
   Jackson said he was not ready to assume the mayor's job was his.
   ``I don't want to take anything for granted. Never, ever do
that,'' Jackson said after a speech to a business group Tuesday.
   Both Lomax and Jackson are black Democrats, but the key to
Lomax's chances was the white, conservative business community that
is a powerful minority in predominantly black Atlanta.
   Jackson, who became the city's first black mayor in 1974 and
served two four-year terms, was often at odds with the business
establishment. But campaign aides say his support among whites this
year is better than in either of his previous two races.
   Lomax tried and failed to capitalize on Atlanta's crime rate,
ranked worst in the nation in the latest FBI survey. Jackson,
meanwhile, pledged not to let the city's ongoing construction and
business boom overrun neighborhoods.
   Lomax's withdrawal allows him to keep his job as chairman of the
county commission, which he would have been forced to give up next
Wednesday at the mayor's race qualifying deadline.
   Jackson was mayor during Atlanta's string of child slayings and
also endured a police department scandal over cheating on promotion
exams, but he was widely credited with adopting progressive race
relations policies that opened the doors of City Hall to blacks and
women.
   He refused to hold city functions at any organization that
discriminated against minorities and began the city's affirmative
action policies in contracts.

<HEAD>Democrat Apparent Winner in Virgin Islands Special Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat John Tutein
was the apparent winner of Tuesday's special election in St. Croix
called to fill the seat of ousted Republican Sen. Kenneth Mapp, an
election official said.
   The Virgin Islands Senate voted 9-6 in May to oust former
minority leader Mapp for voting both here and in Atlanta last year.
   Deputy Election Supervisor Lula Parris said Tuesday night that
with 21 of 23 polling stations having reported, 4,153 of the 16,595
registered voters, or 25 percent, had cast their ballots and 1,826
voted for Tutein.
   Independent Arnold Golden came in second with 1,113, she said.
Three other candidates trailed far behind.
   A victory by Tutein would increase the Democratic majority to
10-5. He would inherit the $55,000 a year salary and 16 months
remaining in Mapp's two-year term as a St. Croix senator.
   Mapp had appealed the Senate decision, claiming an absolute
majority of 10 votes was needed to unseat him, but a federal
appeals court last week upheld the ruling.
   The U.S. Virgin Islands, 40 miles east of Puerto Rico and just
west and south of the British Virgin Islands, were purchased by the
United States from Denmark in 1917 and are governed as an
unincorporated territory of the United States, administered under
the Department of the Interior. The inhabitants are U.S. citizens.

   Ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev, who defected from
the Soviet Union in 1961, is about to leap into musical theater, it
was announced Tuesday. Starting Aug. 18, Nureyev will tour
nationwide as the King of Siam in the Rodgers and Hammerstein
musical, ``The King and I.'' The tour is scheduled to run for 85
weeks over the next three years.
   ``The King and I'' opened on Broadway in 1951, starring Yul
Brynner and Gertrude Lawrence. Brynner and Deborah Kerr starred in
the film.
   Nureyev says he has never seen the show.
   The tour's Anna will be Liz Robertson, who played Eliza
Doolittle in ``My Fair Lady'' and later married the lyricist of
that show, Alan Jay Lerner, according to the announcement from
Joshua Ellis, a public relations firm.
   The ``King and I'' tour, which will visit 13 cities this year,
will be scheduled around Nureyev's commitments with the Paris Opera
Ballet, where he has been artistic director since 1983, and his
touring dance troupe, ``Nureyev and Friends.''
   Cities to be visited this year are Syracuse, N.Y.; Toronto and
Ottawa, Canada; Boston; Hartford and Stamford, Conn.; Tampa;
Wilmington, Del.; Seattle; Costa Mesa and Los Angeles, Calif., and
two to be announced.

<TEXT>
   A 9-year-old girl contracted AIDS by being
sexually abused by her mother and was reportedly injected with
drugs as punishment, state social workers said.
   The girl has been taken into custody by the state and placed in
foster care with a family who knows her, said David Reilly,
regional director of the Texas Department of Human Services.
   ``From everything we can determine from the circumstances, it
appears to be she got it (AIDS) from abuse,'' he said Monday.
   ``Everybody just wants to give her the best we can give her in
the time she has,'' Reilly said. ``She is with the person she wants
to be with and if that works out, there is no reason to move her.''
   The girl's mother, a drug abuser, died of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome. Social workers believe she is the person who
sexually abused the girl and gave her drug injections as a form of
punishment.
   Authorities held a closed-door hearing Monday concerning the
girl. District Judge Tom Rickhoff said the hearing was closed
because of a law requiring confidentiality in AIDS cases.
   After her mother's death, the girl was left to live with
relatives. Social workers were concerned those surroundings were
further endangering her life, so they obtained an emergency court
order to remove the girl and place her in foster care.

<TEXT>
   A group of striking teachers invaded the
Nicaraguan Embassy Tuesday, remaining there for about an hour, and
other teachers battled police near the National Palace.
   Police spokesman Guillermo Molliendo said the street clash
started when about 20 teachers, demonstrating outside the palace,
insulted police patrols.
   He said police moved in to disperse the strikers and one teacher
was arrested for smashing shop windows with a piece of metal. The
Red Cross reported three of the strikers were injured.
   Strike organizers said some 100 teachers entered the Nicaraguan
Embassy and asked embassy officials to intercede with President
Vinicio Cerezo to grant their demands.
   An estimaed 800 students supporting the teachers' strike blocked
traffic in a town 125 miles north of the capital and occupied a
court building.
   Other students threw nails on the highway between Huehuetenango
and La Mesita near the Mexican border, puncturing tires and
blocking traffic, according to police.
   The nation's 35,000 elementary and high school teachers left
their jobs Monday defying a labor court ruling that declared the
strike illegal.
   The public school teachers began job actions May 1, demanding a
monthly increase of $80 in their salaries.
   They currently make from $136 to $328 a month plus a flat bonus
of $70 monthly.
   The teachers have been joined occasionally by 15,000 other
government employees and there have been almost daily marches and
demonstrations in Guatemala City.

<HEAD>Wellington and Lyons Bid for 1990 World Chess Final</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MAYAGUEZ, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New Zealand capital of
Wellington and the French city of Lyons announced record bids
Tuesday to stage the 1990 World Chess Championship final.
   The host for the 10-week contest will be decided Wednesday by a
vote of the 89 delegates to the International Chess Federation's
annual meeting being held in this city on Puerto Rico's western
coast.
   In a potentially explosive move the federation decided Tuesday
to choose the venue for the final without consulting the players.
   Wellington offered prize money of 3 million Swiss francs, about
$1.8 million, plus $37,000 for the federation's fund to promote the
game in developing countries.
   Lyons offered the same prize fund and a trophy encrusted with
diamonds and gold valued at $93,000, for the winner.
   According to International Chess Federation rules, up to 20
percent of the total world championship prizes will go to its fund
for developing nations.
   ``This is a window of opportunity for chess in the Southern
Hemisphere,'' Gillian Houser, representing New Zealand's Organizing
Committee, told delegates.
   The French bid was supported by former Soviet world champion
Boris Spassky, who now lives in and plays for France.
   The 1987 title dual in Seville, Spain, between Garri Kasparov
and fellow Soviet Anatoly Karpov raised a record of 2.85 million
Swiss francs, then about $1.8 million.
   Delegates to the 124-member International Chess Federation
decided by a vote of 59-6 with 12 abstentions to change the rules
governing the choice of venue.
   In recent contests the title-holder and challenger have visited
the prospective venues before stating their preferences. In 1987,
Kasparov and Karpov chose different cities and the match was
awarded to the highest bidder, Seville.
   The rule change means the host city for the 1990 final will be
chosen without consulting the champion, Kasparov, or his
challenger, who will be known after the final qualifying match next
March.
   In a further attempt to impose its authority over the leading
grandmasters, the Federation also decided that each player must
accept match conditions within 28 days of the qualifying final. If
either the champion or challenger refuses his place will be taken
up by a reserve.

   A former Department of Housing and Urban
Development accountant was named Tuesday in a federal lawsuit
seeking to recover more than $1 million in funds allegedly diverted
from the beleaguered agency.
   The lawsuit contends Douglas R. Turner diverted to the bank
account of his company, Green View Developers Inc., $1,006,130 in
federal funds intended to assist low-income facilities in obtaining
housing. The company also is named as a defendant.
   U.S. Attorney Mike Norton and acting Assistant Attorney General
Stuart E. Schiffer said the complaint seeks damages arising from
false statements that Turner allegedly made and for alleged false
record keeping by Green View.
   Turner allegedly used the HUD money in Green View's account to
purchase land in the Denver suburb of Littleton, to pay a
contractor to build a house on the property and to buy a car.
   ``We'll move for a default judgment and seek damages, but we
want equitable transfer of the funds back to the federal
government,'' Norton said.
   The case against Turner began when a Denver-area HUD auditor
discovered the alleged diversions after finding payment requests
for Green View assigned to a project that was off the agency's
rolls.
   Turner was suspended without pay on June 4 and the unfinished
house caught the attention of federal agents. Agents said the house
is located in a neighborhood where lots run between $35,000 and
$45,000, and homes from $170,000 to $750,000.
   The lawsuit is the result of a detailed investigation performed
by the Office of the Inspector General, HUD, Denver and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.
   Sources said the alleged theft occurred in HUD's Section 8
rent-subsidy program, which gives developers subsidies to build
housing for low-income people.
   The inquiry overlaps a probe by auditor's from HUD's Office of
Finance and Accounting of fraud and embezzlement in the sale of HUD
foreclosed homes.
   Nationwide, about 80 branch offices are being examined.
   Mary Brunette, top aide to HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, reported in
June that the Denver accountant allegedly directed Section 8
payments through an automated cash transfer system, from the U.S.
Treasury into his bank account.

   Four people remained hospitalized Tuesday
after a hailstorm drenched a Lutheran youth prayer service at an
outdoor amphitheater, sending 130 people to hospitals for
hypothermia and other problems.
   The fast-moving storm unleashed a torrent of rain and hail on
Red Rocks Amphitheater about 10 p.m. Monday _ two hours into the
``Fire Power'' prayer service attended by 9,000 teen-agers from
across the United States, said Gary Lane, Denver's director of
parks and arenas.
   ``When you have youths dressed in T-shirts and shorts and a
storm can kick up and drop temperatures 20 degrees, you get some
borderline hypothermia cases,'' Lane said. Temperatures dropped
from 65 degrees to about 45 in minutes.
   Authorities said some youths also were hyperventilating, some
were hysterical and others may have suffered from altitude sickness
from overexertion. Red Rocks, part of the Denver parks system, is
at 6,400 feet elevation in the mountain foothills 14 miles west of
Denver.
   Four Flight for Life helicopters and 35 ambulances transported
the chilled teen-agers to eight Denver-area hospitals. All but four
of the 130 people who were transported were released after
treatment.
   Officials said David Jones, 40, of Franklin, N.C., was in stable
condition for treatment of chest pains; Phyllis Westerman, 32, of
Blue Springs, Mo., who also complained of chest pains, was in good
condition, and Tammy Dennison, 16, of Lancaster, Texas, and Cynthia
Jennings, 17, of Bonfield, Ill., both were listed in good condition
and were under observation for asthmatic conditions.
   About 17,000 teen-agers from across the country are attending
the five-day youth convocation by the Lutheran Church's Missouri
Synod. The gathering began Saturday.

<HEAD>Saks Fifth Avenue Settles Tailor Made Sex Discrimination Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Saks Fifth Avenue department
store chain said Tuesday it has agreed to change its policy of
charging customers for alterations on skirts and dresses but not
for fixing suits, blazers and slacks.
   The out-of-court action settles a class action discrimination
lawsuit filed by Muriel Mabry of Anaheim Hills and Lori Anderson of
Mission Viejo, who bought dresses and were charged $40 each for
alterations. At the same time, the ritzy department store was
tailoring suits, slacks and blazers for free.
   ``We are now adding several free alterations on dresses and
skirts, and we will continue to review the policy for similar
appropriate revisions,'' said Patricia Fox, spokeswoman for the
Saks Fifth Avenue store in Costa Mesa.
   Mabry and Anderson took their case to feminist attorney Gloria
Allred, who accused Saks of illegal discrimination and asked the
court to issue an injunction that would force the store to charge
equally for alterations.
   The suit also sought $250 for each woman hurt by Saks' bias over
the past three years. Allred said the suit, filed Sept. 8, 1988,
was resolved amicably.
   Bill Acton, a spokesman for Saks, maintained that there had not
been the issue of a double standard involved and that no damages
were paid.
   Saks, he said, ``has never had a double standard so it can't
agree to end one.'' He explained that the store previously charged
for work done on dresses and skirts because of the work involved.
However, he said there was no charge for clothing that was
considered ``unisex.'' Since 1980, he said there has been no charge
for ``courtesy'' work on slacks or blazers done for men or women.
   As a result of the settlement, however, the company decided to
``take a second look'' at its policy of charging for alterations
done on skirts and dresses, Acton said.
   Allred lauded Saks' change in policy at a news conference
Tuesday.
   ``Saks' response to the plaintiffs' suit could serve as a model
for the industry. As a major force in the American fashion
industry, Saks is sensitive to issues that affect women,'' Allred
said outside the Saks store in Beverly Hills.
   Many department stores charge women, but not men, for
alterations. Others sometimes charge men a small fee for major
alterations.
   ``Hopefully, other large retail chains will follow suit, and if
they do not, we expect that other women will file lawsuits as we
did,'' Mabry said, adding the victory ``is especially sweet in that
two women, size 2 and 4, could take such a big issue and prevail.''

<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu and other
anti-apartheid leaders demonstrated Tuesday in support of a
national defiance campaign. Police reported widespread student
unrest in townships near Cape Town.
   Tutu was among several opposition clergymen and academics who
addressed a church service held in solidarity with former detainees
who have begun defying restrictions imposed by police following
their release.
   The black Anglican archbishop, the 1984 Nobel Peace laureate,
joined about 60 people in a demonstration outside St. George's
Cathedral after the service. Outdoor protest demonstrations are
illegal, but police did not intervene.
   Hundreds of activists released from detention this year were
served with restriction orders requiring them to be at home each
night and to report daily to local police stations. Many were
banned from political activities.
   On Sunday, 21 Cape Town area activists said they would defy
their restrictions. Other former detainees are expected to join
them on Aug. 20 as part of a defiance campaign begun this month by
the anti-apartheid movement.
   In mixed-race townships near Cape Town, students supporting the
campaign have been staging protests and erecting street barricades.
Several large rallies were held Tuesday.
   Police headquarters said officers fired tear gas in three
incidents Monday to disperse crowds of students. One delivery van
was firebombed, and other vehicles were stoned, police said.
   Maj. Gen. Herman Stadler, a police spokesman, said, ``We can
expect the unrest will increase toward the elections.''
   Parliamentary elections are scheduled to be held Sept. 6.
   Residents of Oukasie, a ramshackle rural black township,
meanwhile won a potentially decisive court victory in their
long-running struggle against government efforts to relocate them,
their lawyer, Geoff Budlender, said Tuesday.
   Pretoria Supreme Court Justice Kees van Dijkhorst ruled Monday
that the government acted improperly last year when it declared the
55-year-old township an ``emergency camp.''
   Under terms of the declaration, rents in Oukasie were raised by
more than 50 percent, unauthorized visitors were barred, and
permits were required to renovate homes. Civil rights workers said
the declaration was imposed to make life so miserable Oukasie
residents would leave voluntarily.
   Government lawyers said Tuesday they would appeal.
   White authorities have tried for years to coax or coerce the
approximately 6,000 residents of Oukasie into moving to a newer
township 12 miles away.
   The official reason for Oukasie's intended demise is that the
government considers it an unhealthy slum.
   Residents believe the real reason is that Oukasie is a few
hundred yards from the white suburb of Brits. Brits, 30 miles west
of Pretoria, is a stronghold of the far-right Conservative Party

<HEAD>Engine Manufacturer Offers Parts Reward</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. is offering rewards
for pieces of the jet engine from United Airlines Flight 232 that
broke up over western Iowa.
   General Electric spokesman David Lane said Tuesday that
handbills have been distributed in an area of western Iowa where
parts of the engine may have landed to keep up interest in the
search.
   The engine parts are key in discovering why the DC-10
experienced engine trouble and lost almost all of its steering
control when hydraulic lines were cut. The planes crew managed to
guide the jumbo jet to Sioux Gateway Airport at Sioux City and
attempted an emergency landing. The fiery, tumbling crash killed
111 people of the 296 on board.
   Sweeps by military aircraft over the area to try to find engine
fragments ended Friday, said Ted Lopatkiewicz, a spokesman for the
National Transportation Safety Board in Washington D.C.
   Officials said they are not planning a ground search of pastures
and fields in Buena Vista County.
   ``It's a big area out there,'' said Buena Vista County Sheriff
Chuck Eddy. ``It's kind of a sit-and-wait situation right now.''
   GE, the manufacturer of the jet's engine, will offer rewards
through the end of August for rotating parts from the engine, Lane
said in a telephone interview from his office in Evendale, Ohio.
   ``A representative authorized by the NTSB will look at each of
the recovered parts,'' Lane said. ``A representative of GE Aircraft
will determine the level of reward.''
   Eddy said GE distributed the information last week to property
owners and farmers. He said the fliers specify the reward is for
engine parts and offer as much as $1,000 for some of the parts.
   The search has been concentrated 60 miles east of Sioux City.
   Parts have continued to turn up, officials said. On Thursday, a
farmer found fragments of a jet fan blade while working in a hay
field, Eddy said. One fragment measured 10 by 12 inches.
   Lopatkiewicz said a titanium fan disk and a shaft from the
engine have not been located. Investigators have said that finding
the disk and shaft would help them determine what caused the engine
to malfunction.
   Investigators hope harvests in late September will turn up more
engine parts.
   Lopatkiewicz said one NTSB investigator remains in Iowa to wrap
up the federal agency's crash-related work, but probably will
return to Washington in a week.

   The government has turned over 10
Vietnamese soldiers to Vietnam's embassy one week after a U.S.
aircraft carrier rescued them from a barge drifting in the South
China Sea, officials said Tuesday.
   Ruben Domingo, chief intelligence officer at the Commission on
Immigration and Deportation, said the 10 are to be flown home
Wednesday.
   The USS Ranger rescued the soldiers with 29 other Vietnamese on
Aug. 2 about 80 miles west of Subic Bay Naval Base. The U.S. base
is 50 miles northwest of Manila.
   Domingo said the soldiers were stationed in the Spratlys, a
chain of islands in the South China Sea claimed by China, Vietnam,
Taiwan, Malaysia and the Philippines.
   The soldiers apparently were on the a barge when it broke loose
from its moorings during a storm, he said, without specifying an
exact date.
   The U.S. 7th Fleet said in announcing the rescue last week that
while the barge drifted, those aboard the barge rescued 29
Vietnamese refugees from a foundering boat. The 39 drifted 10 more
days before a plane from the Ranger spotted the barge, the
statement said.

<HEAD>Former President Carter to Observe Nicaraguan Elections</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former President Jimmy Carter, who denounced the
May elections in Panama as a fraud, agreed Tuesday to lead a
delegation to observe next winter's elections in Nicaragua.
   Carter said Tuesday he would assemble a 20-member delegation
which will visit Nicaragua at least once before the Feb. 25
elections.
   ``I will make sure that the members of my delegation will not
interfere in the internal affairs of Nicaragua, and we will be
impartial with respect to the candidates and parties competing for
the election,'' Carter said in a statement.
   Carter and a group of Central and South American leaders had
received separate invitations to observe the elections from
President Daniel Ortega, Mariano Fiallos, president of Nicaragua's
Supreme Electoral Council, and from Gustavo Tablada Zelaya on
behalf of the National Opposition Union.
   Ortega, in a letter dated Aug. 3, invited Carter to ``observe
our electoral process from beginning to end'' and said Carter's
delegation ``will have unrestricted access to all aspects of the
process.''
   Fiallos' invitation promised free access to ``all the Electoral
Council's information.''
   The invitations, Carter said, ``are all positive indications
that Nicaraguans want a free and fair election and that the climate
for such an event is improving.''
   The invitations went to Carter and the Council of Freely Elected
Heads of Government, based at the Carter Center of Emory University
in Atlanta, a group of 15 current and former presidents and prime
ministers of the Americas.
   Robert Pastor, director of Emory's Latin American program,
visited Nicaragua in July to assess the electoral conditions and
concluded that ``the government in Nicaragua is serious about a
free election.''
   ``The fact that they have invited the person who judged the
Panamanian election a fraud is a demonstration of the seriousness
and also a recognition that they know Jimmy Carter will be fair and
impartial,'' Pastor said.
   Carter led a team of international observers monitoring the
Panama elections in early May. He accused the government there of
stealing the election and later briefed President Bush on his
findings.

   Search teams on Wednesday
recovered six bodies from the wreckage of a sightseeing plane that
crashed in the Southern Alps with nine American and Canadian
tourists aboard, police reported.
   They said there were no survivors.
   A New Zealander was piloting the twin-engine Britten Norman
Islander that went down Tuesday near Mount Aspiring on South Island.
   A police spokesman in Dunedin said the bodies had not been
identified and he gave no indication when identities of the victims
would be released.
   An uncomfired report said the Americans were from Wisconsin.
   New Zealand Press Association said the bodies were taken by a
helicopter from the crash site to a mountain base camp and would be
transferred to Glenorchy.
   Two rescue dogs were used to help a team of 27 police and rescue
personnel locate the bodies, according to the press agency.
   It said the wreckage was scattered at an elevation of about
4,000 feet on the mountainside and the dogs were brought because
some of the bodies were buried under snow.
   Police said when the plane crashed it triggered a small
avalanche.

   The governing Liberal Democrats today elected
Toshiki Kaifu party president and successor to Prime Minister

scandal and an unpopular sales tax.
   ``I ask for the understanding, and the strong, warm support of

   A two-time former education minister, Kaifu is the party's
second new leader in two months. Like Uno, he has little power base
of his own and hopes to recent problems that have loosened the
Liberal Democrats' grip on power for the first time since 1955.
   Kaifu received 279 votes. Yoshiro Hayashi, a former health and
welfare minister, received 120 votes, while Shintaro Ishihara, a

nationalist wing, received 48, with four invalid votes out of the

   The Bush administration is poised to begin
pumping money into the nation's failed savings and loan
institutions as soon as possible after the president signs the bill
on Wednesday.
   President Bush intends to enact the historic legislation in a
White House ceremony on Wednesday, said administration and
congressional sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. The
Treasury Department said it will borrow the first $5 billion
installment of the bailout on Thursday.
   The legislation, passed by Congress on Saturday, authorizes $50
billion in borrowing over the next 26 months to close or merge 500
insolvent S&amp;Ls. Of that, $20 billion must be borrowed in the next
eight weeks, before the end of the 1989 fiscal year.
   Treasury officials said $15 billion of this year's borrowing
will be used to replace high-rate certificates of deposit at some
of the 262 failed thrifts already under government control. The
goal is to reduce operating losses until regulators can rescue the
thrifts permanently.

<DATELINE>FUNAFUTI, Tuvalu (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When storms roll in the from the
Pacific, the people of Tuvalu look carefully at the waves in the
lagoon for signs of the greenhouse effect.
   One day it could be a matter of the survival of their island
nation.
   A slight rise in the sea level caused by man-made gases warming
the atmosphere and melting polar ice would send storm waves
crashing over this atoll where the highest point is only 12 feet
above sea level.
   At its narrowest this nation of eight inhabited coral atolls
with a population of 8,000 is only the width of a golf course
fairway.
   Already in stormy weather, wind-driven waves break over the
seawall, into the hotel and over the front lawns of houses.
   Tuvaluans remember the 1972 hurricane that flattened every
house, toppled coconut trees and sent waves smashing across the
island.
   ``People had to cling to coconut trees to stop being washed
away,'' said Prime Minister Tomasi Puapua. ``It was very
frightening. That's why we are so worried about the greenhouse
effect. Old men say that now the winds from the west are stronger
than they were in past days.''
   Puapua said his four-man government was doing its best to keep
up with the latest research on the greenhouse effect. But this is
difficult because Tuvalu, in the central Pacific midway between
Hawaii and Australia, has no newspapers, no television and only
four hours of local radio broadcasting a day.
   Scientists predict the emissions of man-made gases from the
world's industrial complexes and automobiles could warm the
atmosphere, melt the polar ice cap and raise sea levels six inches
to 4.5 feet by the year 2030.
   ``Our country would disappear,'' Puapua said. ``Other countries
would have flooding but we would be swamped. We would have to
leave.''
   Puapua said he welcomed an Australian offer to spend $4.8
million on a network of scientific stations around the Pacific to
monitor sea levels, tides, atmopsheric pressures, temperatures and
weather.
   Puapua holds some optimism about the future of Tuvalu, which
became independent from Britain in 1978.
   ``This greenhouse may not happen,'' he said. ``We don't know. We
hope the scientists are wrong. But we don't want to spend the next
50 years worrying about it. There's no need to panic.''
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia recently told Puapua and
President Ieremia Tabai of neighboring Kiribati that Australia
would consider resettling their populations if their islands had to
be evacuated.
   ``But I don't want to go,'' Puapua said.
   Meantime, Puapua and his government are moving ahead with
development of the country, formerly known as the Ellice Islands,
which occupies just 16 square miles of dry land and is so poor it
is likely to remain dependent on outside aid forever, according to
a recent Australian parliamentary inquiry on the Pacific.
   Tuvalu gets $688 per capita in aid, the highest in the Pacific.
It has a per capita gross national product of $570.
   Despite the absence of resources, the government is planning to
pave the airport's 1,200-foot grass runway in the hope of
attracting tourists.
   This would interfere with Tuvalu's soccer competititon because
games are played on the airstrip. A siren sounds 10 minutes before
the twice-weekly flights arrive to give the players time to take
down the goal posts and move their bicycles.
   Paving the runway, which takes up half the land area of
Funafuti, will mean the prison would have to be moved. But it
recently had only six prisoners, all serving time for being drunk
and disorderly. Police Comissioner Saloa Tauia said there have been
only two murders in his 33 years in the force.
   Although most of the population of Polynesian islanders live at
subsistence level, they make a little money from stamp sales,
handicrafts, copra sales and fishing.
   Most of their revenue comes from graduates of the marine academy
who work as seamen on British and German merchant ships. But to cut
costs the Germans recently reduced the salaries of Tuvaluan seamen
by two-thirds to $145 a month.
   The Tuvaluans recently turned down an offer of 500 bicycles from

   In any case, they don't like taking aid and rather than take
handouts each year, they established the Tuvalu Trust Fund with $30
million in contributions from Britain, Australia and New Zealand.
   The money is invested and managed by an indpedendent board. The
interest is used to pay the government's expenditures.
   ``We would like to be independent financially,'' Puapua said.
``But it is doubtful we can ever achieve that. So we would like to
live peacefully. We say, Don't worry. Be happy.''

<HEAD>Bochco Pursues `Dramedy' in First Series of 10-Show ABC Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The logo of Steven Bochco's new production
company, making its debut in the fall, will be an animated
50-year-old picture of his violinist father.
   Rudolph Bochco, who died in 1977, was in part the inspiration
for the first series from Steven Bochco Productions, ``Doogie
Howser, M.D.,'' a half-hour comedy-drama about a 16-year-old
doctor. The show will premiere this fall on ABC, the first
production from Bochco's 10-series deal with the network.
   ``I've sort of always been interested in prodigies,'' Bochco
told a meeting of the Television Critics Association. ``My dad was
a prodigy. And he was a violinist. It's just a fascinating kind of
freak of nature. They don't really understand why it happens.''
   Prodigies were on Bochco's mind when he hit upon ``the notion of
a kid who by virtue of very specific circumstances had all of those
prodigious abilities kind of laser-focused onto medicine. ...
   ``I think a show like this, assuming an audience accepts the
fundamental premise, can be very entertaining for years to come.
Whether other people find it as intrinsically interesting as I do _
gee, I don't know. I hope they do.''
   Bochco said he approached a doctor friend and asked, would it be
possible for a 16-year-old to practice medicine.
   ``He said, well, I don't know but let me look into this, and
I'll get back to you. He got back to me a day or two later. There
are absolutely no restrictions whatsoever on anybody of any age who
has completed the required educational training to practice
medicine.
   ``I said, you mean to tell me that a boy of 16, who can't go
into a grocery store and buy a six-pack of beer can write a
prescription for morphine?''
   It might be technically feasible for a 16-year-old genius to
work as a doctor, but it remains to be seen whether audiences will
buy the premise, packaged as it is as a half-hour ``dramedy.'' The
form has failed to win high Nielsen ratings in the past. Bochco's
own ``Hooperman'' lasted only two seasons, but that made it the
longest-running of the batch of dramedies that showed up a couple
of years ago. (Except for ``The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd,''
but that show had to move to cable to stay in production.)
   Bochco has not given up on the format.
   ``People have only been attempting these kinds of half-hours for
a short time, and it's not unexpected that the majority of them,
like the majority of everything else, will fail. I continue to
believe it's an extremely viable form,'' he said. ``... I mean, I
think `Wonder Years' is a real successful show, and I don't think
it falls into a typical half-hour sitcom format.''
   In the pilot, Doogie, played by newcomer Neil Patrick Harris,
kisses his first girl and suffers his first crisis as a physician,
ending the episode on a distinctly bittersweet note. His parents
are played by James B. Sikking (``Hill Street Blues'') and Belinda
Montgomery, who played Sonny Crockett's ex-wife in ``Miami Vice.''
   Bochco said subsequent episodes will not be as heavy on the
drama as the pilot, but he felt a serious approach was necessary at
the outset to establish the ``credibility'' of the premise, to
demonstrate that the show's aim was not simply ``giggle, giggle,
laugh, laugh about a 16-year-old doctor.''
   Bochco said his deal with ABC will progress slowly _ ``I'm going
to try very hard to do no more than one project per season.'' And
he is still somewhat involved with his NBC creation, ``L.A. Law,''
though not on a day-to-day basis.
   He wouldn't elaborate on any future projects except to say,
``There's one hour show that I desperately want to attempt to do.
Hopefully, in the next year and a half we'll manage to do it. Other
than that, I have no ideas for anything.''

<HEAD>One Shock After Another</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American economic history in recent years is
recorded in a series of shocks, but the encouraging lesson that
might be drawn from them is that somehow the country has survived
them all.
   More are coming, accompanied by alarming predictions about the
decline of America. There is, for instance, the coming of a united
Europe in 1992, viewed by alarmists as a fortress Europe that will
exclude American goods.
   Before that time arrives, however, we must contend with the
alarming report issued after the big stock market bust of 1987, in
which 33 economists from 13 countries said the world economy was in
the worst mess since the 1930s.
   The crash, the esteemed economists said, was attributable to the
existence of major and unsustainable imbalances in the world
economy, the most glaring of which was the growing indebtedness of
the United States.
   ``Unless more decisive action is taken to correct existing
imbalances at their roots, the next few years could be the most
troubled since the 1930s,'' they stated in their report, ``The
Global Economic Crisis: After Wall Street.''
   Theirs was not the first warning about imbalances.
   Throughout the 1980s publications flapped the storm flags about
ruinous inflation, soaring interest rates, energy shortages and
credit crunches. The common theme was America living beyond its
means. The forecast: Collapse.
   Before that, in 1979, President Carter delivered his malaise
speech. Americans suffered a crisis of confidence, he said. They
doubted the purpose and meaning of their own lives. They had lost
their sense of national unity.
   Delivered from the heights of the presidency itself, from a
leader expected to correct such defects of spirit, the speech was
demoralizing. Some who didn't feel dispirited before the speech
might have felt that way afterwards.
   It was a time of other crises too, especially that produced by
the high price of imported oil. Can anybody forget the grim
warnings of disaster, of an America unable to compete in the world
because it had been outfoxed by Arabs?
   If problems with oil wouldn't do America in, then the Japanese
would. Why it was demonstrated in showrooms all over America: The
Japanese produced better cars and lower prices and beat Detroit in
Detroit's own territory.
   Americans did everything wrong. They consumed instead of
produced, spent instead of saved, wasted time instead of putting
their noses to the grindstone, indulged themselves in the present
instead of planning for the future.
   Considering the pace at which this transition was occurring, it
was said, America would become a second-rate power by the turn of
the century. The future belonged to Japan, if not to the Soviet
Union, which would bury us economically if it didn't destroy us,
and probably the world, in an atomic battle.
   Edward Yardeni, never one to join in the ecofadish (economic
fad) thinking, which generally is pessimistic and always alarming,
declares that things are not nearly what they might seem.
   Yardeni, director of economics at Prudential-Bache Securities,
talks instead about the triumph of capitalism, the collapse of
communism, free-market spirit, global markets, cost-reducing
competition, free trade, economic reform, technological innovation,
communications, de-emphasis of military.
   The entire world, he indicates, may be reaching for another
level of achievement. It is a dynamic one in which problems are
more transitory than permanent, and become resolved eventually
rather than allowed to destroy.
   Americans haven't saved? Yes, he concedes. Americans were young
and in a consuming mood. Now that they are growing a bit older they
will save. Emerging economies in contrast will take to spending
like Americans used to.
   In a dynamic world problems aren't necessarily permanent or
reflective of national weaknesses. ``The pessimists aren't seeing
the big global picture,'' he says.
   ``Communism has failed. Capitalism has triumphed. By 1993, U.S.
government bonds should yield 5 percent and the Dow Jones
industrial average should be at 5000,'' which is a way of saying
America will prevail.

<TEXT>
   When Joe and Joyce Cruzan visit their
32-year-old daughter in her bright, private room at the Missouri
Rehabilitation Center, they can't help wonder what she would tell
them if she could speak.
   ``She would say, `Pull the plug, stop it. I don't want to live
like this. I have no dignity,''' Joe said during a visit to the
hospital where Nancy Cruzan has lain comatose for six years. ``I
think that probably would be the key word, no dignity.
   ``She used to come to me and say, `Dad, my car is not running
very well,' and I would fix it for her. Now, it's `Dad, I'm in a
situation that I can't help. Can you do something for me?'''
   So far, the answer has been no.
   The Cruzans hope that will change this fall when the U.S.
Supreme Court rules on their request to remove feeding tubes that
sustain Nancy's life. The case is the first time the court has
agreed to consider the troubling issue of when it is appropriate to
stop medical treatment _ to pull the plug on a life.
   The Cruzans' world changed forever on Jan. 11, 1983. Nancy,
driving home from work, lost control of her car and it overturned.
At first she was presumed dead; by the time paramedics revived her,
she had irreparable brain damage.
   Ever since, Nancy Cruzan has been in what doctors call a
``persistent vegetative state.''
   Lying in bed in a small, fourth-floor room, she breathes on her
own but by all accounts is unaware of her surroundings. Birthday
and greeting cards are taped to a window; a wide-brimmed straw hat
with ribbons hangs near the door.
   Nancy's body is stiff and her hands so contracted that her
fingernails cut into her wrist if not trimmed. Her eyes are
sometimes open, roaming aimlessly, but she does not respond to
voices or gestures.
   The Cruzans visit weekly. Joyce makes colorful gowns for her
daughter to wear instead of drab, hospital-issued clothing. She
used to talk to her daughter during those visits, but not so much
anymore.
   ``It's always been an exercise in futility. It's always been
more for me. I used to come in and tell her everything and now
sometimes I tell her stuff. Sometimes, I just brush her hair and
sit and touch her.''
   Medical experts say Nancy Cruzan could live another 30 or 40
years, as long as she is given food and water through a feeding
tube implanted in her stomach.
   The Cruzans, who live in Carterville in southwest Missouri, have
fought for approval to remove the tube.
   A state court judge said a year ago they could ask the hospital
to remove the feeding tube. But the Missouri Supreme Court
overturned that decision in a 5-4 ruling last fall. Acting as her
guardians, the Cruzans appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which is
expected to hear the case in November or December.
   No federal appellate court has ruled directly on the issue and
opinions are split at the state level. Arizona and Massachusetts
high courts have ruled that such patients retain a federal
constitutional right to refuse such treatment, including feeding,
while Missouri and Washington ruled to the contrary, said Bill
Colby of Kansas City, the Cruzans' attorney.
   In the most famous right-to-die case, the New Jersey Supreme
Court ruled in 1976 that Joseph and Julia Quinlan had a right to
take their comatose daughter, Karen Ann, off a respirator. The U.S.
Supreme Court declined to review the case and Karen died at age 31
in 1985, nine years after her respirator was removed.
   The Cruzans, like the Quinlans, want to remember their daughter
as she was before her accident _ an independent young woman who
enjoyed life.
   ``If she had her way, she'd like to come back like she was,''
said Cruzan, 55, a sheet metal worker. ``That's what I wish, but
it's not going to happen.''
   The crux of the Cruzan case is the lack of a state law allowing
removal of food and water in such cases. In fact, the Missouri high
court noted the state living will statute prohibits such removal
from terminaly ill patients.
   While the statute never was an issue in the case and Nancy
Cruzan is not terminally ill, it is important because it reflects
the state's policy of not including food and water as medical
treatment that can be withdrawn.
   Colby is optimistic the Supreme Court will rule in favor of the
Cruzans.
   ``It's an important part of our country's traditions that
recognizes the sanctity of the family,'' he said. ``I think the
U.S. Supreme Court will continue to recognize the importance of the
family in our case.''
   The state Supreme Court ``improperly discounted the rights of
the individual'' in the 14th Amendment, he said. That amendment
says no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property
without due process.
   ``Within this concept of individual liberty is the right for
that person to accept or reject invasive medical treatment,'' Colby
said.
   Missouri Attorney General William Webster, while sympathetic to
the family, disagreed with Colby's interpretation. ``We don't
believe the 14th Amendment extends the right to privacy to remove
food and water in this case.''
   The issue, he said, is ``whether the constitutional right of
privacy extends to the right of a third party, when the patient is
not terminally ill, to withdraw nutrition and hydration from an
incompetent ward of the state.''
   The Legislature could pass a statute allowing the removal of
food and water from patients like Ms. Cruzan, although lawmakers
this year refused to act on such a measure, he said. ``I can't
project how I would feel if I was in their circumstances. I don't
know if anybody can.
   ``But I'm not sure if the tragic nature of the circumstances
gives rise to argue a constitutional right of privacy where the
Supreme Court has been silent on the issue and the words don't
appear in the Constitution.''
   The ordeal has taken its toll on the family. Cruzan has trouble
sleeping and his wife has taken medication to fight depression.
   ``It's always there, just below the surface,'' Cruzan said.
``When you go to bed at night and the first thing usually when you
wake up in the morning.''

   On the first day without wakes or
funerals since the tragedy, children are running in the farmyard,
spraying each other with a garden hose while their mothers shout
for them to cut it out.
   It would be a normal day but for one thing. Elmbrook, the dairy
farm nurtured by five generations of Theuerkauf men over 108 years,
has no one to run it save for the widows and children.
   Inside the great, white farmhouse, Linda Theuerkauf and her
children gather in a circle, surrounded by memories, and say the
names:
   ``First Tom...''
   Tom Theuerkauf, 27, was the first one into the manure pit,
through a narrow hole and down the ladder to clear the drain 12
feet below.
   ``... then Danny ...''
   Dan Theuerkauf, 15, quiet and thoughtful like his uncle Tom, had
been cutting hay by himself for two years, already part of the
circle of Theuerkauf farmers. Dan saw Tom's head hit the ladder and
slip into the dark. He sent his 8-year-old brother Brian for help
and then went down.
   ``... and Brian got Bill first.''
   Bill Hofer, 63, was the third man down, a cousin who grew up
across the lane from the Theuerkaufs, went to school with them and
farmed with them.
   ``... and I got my Grandpa ...''
   Carl Theuerkauf Sr., 66 the day they buried him, a patriarch
with a love for farming surpassed only by his passion for his
family. He hated nothing more than when people wouldn't try, yet he
once stopped Carl Jr. from running into a burning barn to save the
cows, the farm equipment, the new tractor.
   Dorothy Theuerkauf remembers her son said, ```Spray me down Dad
and I'll go in.' ... Carl said, `No way, don't risk your life for
machines.'''
   Carl Sr. stepped into the hole to save his son, grandson and
cousin.
   ``... and then my Carl.'' Linda finishes the toll.
   Carl Theuerkauf Jr., 37, was the last man down.
   ``I don't know where he came from,'' Linda said. ``He wasn't
supposed to be on the farm that day.''
   At first no one knew what had happened. Men went into that pit
every week to clear the drain before the pump was turned on. But
methane from the decaying sewage had built up during a heat wave;
it took only seconds for each man to collapse, scant minutes to
suffocate in air that contained no oxygen.
   The automatic waste pit was one innovation cited in 1981 when
Michigan State University named Carl Sr. the state Farm Manager of
the Year.
   Over five generations, the Theuerkaufs (pronounced Turk'-off)
built Elmbrook into the largest and most respected dairy farm in
Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Gain the Theuerkaufs' trust and you had
the ear of every farmer for 50 miles. Lose it, as one state ag man
did, ``and your word is dirt,'' a county agent said.
   As their lives touched Menominee County, so did their July 26
deaths. Newspapers carrying stories of the family sold out and
people stood by the road in the rain when the funeral procession
passed. Not since more than 700 people celebrated Elmbrook's
centennial a year ago July was there such a gathering.
   Carl Sr. was so proud of that centennial he was near tears at
the county fair last year when they handed him the historical
marker. This year, the fair was deserted, what with the funerals
and the rain.
   The same gloom hung over Elmbrook. A cow was loose in the back
field. Two newborn calves lay untended in the mud of a holding pen.
Thick, wet muck coated the stall floors in the dairy barn.
   No longer is Elmbrook a tight ship farmed by committee, Carl Sr.
and sons Tom and Carl Jr. meeting in the yard every morning, hands
on hips, debating the day's work sometimes for an hour.
   Missing from those meetings was Carl Sr.'s third boy, Bill, a
woodworker, not a farmer. Carl once said he could handle anything,
so long as it wasn't a death, but he cried three years ago when he
learned Bill had lost his hands in a car crash.
   Elmbrook still needs running. The pit, still waiting to be
emptied, sits like a vault beneath the dairy barn and nobody will
go near it.
   Bill, just 23 but aged incredibly, it seems, these past weeks,
is taking a crash course in his family's occupation, scrambling
between the paid hands and neighbors who volunteered to help. What
are you doing? What must be done there?
   That doesn't stop one of those raucous water fights with wet,
laughing Theuerkauf children everywhere. They splash each other
like they did just the Sunday before, when their fathers and
brother were throwing water, too.
   That's the kind of thing the Theuerkaufs are keen to remember.
   There are the Sunday mornings, when Linda made waffles and Carl
Jr. would poke fun at her cooking. ``Tasteless, tasteless,'' he
would say.
   There are the Sunday afternoons, when Carl and Linda drove alone
to see the cornfields and Carl would talk of plans for the future,
the family, the farm.
   ``How Carl loved the farm. His dream was to make it the best
farm it could be, so we could be together,'' Linda said.
   After the ambulances and the television crews, Linda awoke in
the dark. It was the hour Carl would be getting up, and she walked
across the yard to the bright lights of the barn. ``I stood and
watched the man milk the last six cows. It was 3 a.m. and I felt
Carl there with me.''
   She smiled. ``Do I hate the farm because of what happened? No.''
   But that night after they died, Linda hated Elmbrook. ``I just
wanted to pack and move away and never come back.''
   In the trailer next door, 5-year-old Tommy promises Tom's widow,
Wendy, he will take care of her. Two-year-old Rachael cries. At
night, Tom's pet German shepherd whines softly. ``Even the dog is
lost,'' Wendy said.
   She doesn't know if she will stay. ``I have to see what my kids
say.'' What is the farm to them now? Pain? Love?
   Farming and Elmbrook remain life and love for Carl Jr.'s
children. The oldest, 16-year-old Becky, sees her father and her
brother Dan in the work of the farm hands.
   From a sandbox in the yard, Brian plotted how he and Dan would
run their own dairy operation. Brian tucked a toy tractor into
Dan's coffin, and the Saturday they buried his big brother, he
begged to go home in time to turn on the TV wrestling shows ``so I
can tell Danny about it.''
   Dan had wished for such a brother on the candles of a birthday
cake; a pregnant Linda guessed it. ``I said, `You wished for a baby
brother,' and he started crying. He said if somebody knows your
wish, it won't come true.''
   Linda and her children are crowded together on the couch,
passing a rose and a carnation, two flowers saved from the funeral
the day before. On the wall above hangs a portrait of Elmbrook,
painted long ago by a relative.
   For an afternoon, Brian, Becky, 12-year-old Tracy and
10-year-old Carrie sit with Linda and tell warm, funny stories.
   ... Dad's California vacation that turned out to be tours of
farms ...
   ... How Grandpa would drive around lost, never asking
directions, filling the car with cigar smoke until it seemed the
journey would never end ...
   ... Danny's favorite joke: Why did they outlaw round bales of
hay? Because cows couldn't get a square meal.
   ``What was your father's favorite song?'' Linda asks. They sing:
   ``Sugar in the morning, sugar in the evening, sugar at
suppertime. Be my little sugar and love me all the time.''
   Linda laughs, pulling dark hair back from her face to show not
tear-swollen misery but twinkling eyes. ``He sang that to me all of
the time ... and he had a rotten singing voice.''
   They laugh and laugh. Then Becky asks the question:
   ``Why, why did he have to go down?''

   President Bush intends to sign historic

the first $5 billion installment for the bailout a day later.
   Bush will sign the bill at a White House ceremony, almost

congressional and administration sources, who spoke on condition of

<HEAD>Survey: Executives Waste Many Hours on Unproductive Phone Calls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MORAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American executives spend too much time on
unproductive or unnecessary phone calls, according to a survey of
top corporate managers. Motivational Systems, a
management-development consultant that preaches time management and
efficiency, surveyed the phone habits of 200 top executives at the
largest 1,000 U.S. corporations.
   The results, according to company President Roger Flax, show an
undisciplined approach to the telephone that costs money and hurts
productivity.
   Flax said the 200 executives responding to the survey were chief
executive officers, chief financial officers and managing partners
of major companies. They were questioned about the amount of time
they spent on the phone, the results they achieved and the number
of follow-up calls needed.
   Overall, the executives said they spend about 28 percent of
their working days on the phone. Based on a nine-hour work day,
Flax said, that means 13 hours a week _ or 14.5 weeks a year _ are
spent on the phone.
   Flax estimates that about four of those weeks _ or hundreds of
hours a year _ are wasted calling people back, reaching the wrong
person or simply not being organized enough to get the job done
with one call.
   Flax said he tells clients of his West Orange-based company that
their servitude to the telephone is unneccesary. He said phone time
can be cut dramatically by making phone calls in clusters rather
than interrupting the day's routine, by never leaving vague
messages because they invite the same and by having a secretary
screen incoming calls.
   Larry Baker, president of Time Management Center Inc. of St.
Louis, said many executives are needlessly interrupted because
their secretaries have not been taught which calls to let through
and which can be better handled elsewhere.
   He suggests keeping track of a week's worth of incoming calls,
then going over the calls and classifying them so the secretary
sees the principles behind the decisions he or she has to make.
   Baker uses four basic classifications: calls that need to be put
through directly, those that should be referred elsewhere, those
the secretary can handle and calls that need returning. Each group
can be broken into efficient subgroups, he said.
   ``The key is basing the system on the real world experience of
calls that actually came in one week,'' he said.
   Flax also suggests writing an informal agenda before important
calls and learning the fine art of cutting the call short when the
conversation gets sidetracked.
   ``Let the caller know that you have a meeting to attend, a
letter to dictate or a project that needs your attention,'' he
said. ``Some people need a gentle reminder that others may be
pressed for time.''
   Baker agrees.
   ``When two people get on a telephone, they're really having a
two-person meeting,'' he said. ``The person who receives the call
usually doesn't know it's coming and so having an agenda gives the
other person a great advantage.''
   David Blake, dean of Rutgers University's graduate school of
management, warns against going too far for the sake of efficiency.
He said executives must keep in mind that business is essentially a
network of personal relationships.
   ``The development of inter-personal skills and the ability to
relate to people are both important components of a successful
businessman,'' he said. ``We all seek efficiency, but we're making
a mistake if we forsake social graces.''
   But Blake agreed that an organized, well-balanced phone strategy
produces superior results.
   At American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. _ where one would not
expect to find a passion for shorter telephone calls _ a range of
courses is available to counsel executives and other clients on
telephone technique.
   Jim Taylor, the district manager for client education training
at the company's divisional headquarters in Bridgewater, said time
management goes hand in hand with good communications.
   ``If you manage your time efficiently as an executive, for
instance, setting aside a time period to make most of your calls,
you get more done,'' he said.
   He stopped short of recommending brevity, however.

<HEAD>SEC Charges Three in Levine Spinoff Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has accused two ex-stockbrokers
and a lawyer of insider trading on information received indirectly
from Dennis Levine, the former investment banker who triggered the
ongoing crackdown on Wall Street crime.
   In a lawsuit, the Securities and Exchange Commission charges the
three men and an investment company formed by two of them with
unlawful trading in 15 stocks from March 1984 through June 1985 as
part of an international trading ring.
   The SEC seeks alleged illicit profits and penalties totaling in
the millions of dollars in the suit filed Monday in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan.
   The defendants allegedly received non-public information from
Bernhard Meier, who was Levine's account representative at Bank Leu
International, a Bahamian bank through which Levine ran his 1980-86
illegal trading operation.
   In some prior cases, people who received inside information
second-hand have not been charged. But the lawsuit claims that the
three men ``knew or should have known'' they were using non-public
information about pending mergers or takeovers.
   The complaint is the first against parties who allegedly
received information through Meier, who in 1986 settled charges
with the SEC and was barred for life from the securities industry.
   Levine, a former Wall Street banker, pleaded guilty to violating
securities laws and returned $11.6 million in illegal profits in
June 1986. His admissions spawned dozens of civil and criminals
charges in the continuing Wall Street insider trading investigation.
   Levine, 36, who made millions trading on inside information on
the stocks of companies targeted for takeovers, was paroled from a
federal prison last year. He has said he has formed a private
consulting firm in mergers and acquisitions.
   The defendants are Brian S. Campbell, 32, of New York, who
worked at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. from 1982 to February 1985, and then
at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. until June 1987; Kevin Barry,
33, a former New York corporate lawyer now practicing in upstate
New York; and Carlos Zubillaga, 39, a Venezuelan citizen who worked
in Merrill's New York and Caracas offices and resigned in April
1986.
   Also named is BCM Management Inc., a real estate investment
vehicle formed by Campbell and Barry in 1984.
   The complaint details five of the 15 deals, listing $452,175 in
alleged illegal profits made by the defendants, friends and family
members.
   Under federal securities laws, the SEC also is demanding three
times the total in penalties. SEC attorney Therese Pritchard said
unspecified profits were made in the 10 other deals but not listed
in the lawsuit.
   According to the lawsuit, Meier placed many of Levine's orders
through accounts managed by Campbell. It also states that Campbell
and Barry had separate stock dealings with Meier.
   Campbell also traded securities using inside information through
an account he shared with Zubillaga, the suit claims. The two had
an agreement to split profits and losses on the trades, it says.
   The lawsuit also claims that Campbell helped Meier and Levine
try to deceive the SEC after they learned of the government's
investigation, providing reports purported to be stock analyses
based on public information.
   It also says Meier destroyed documents showing that he had
provided money used by Campbell and Barry in some real estate
investments to further the alleged deception.
   Barry Fallick, Campbell's lawyer, said his client would ``fully
litigate the matters.'' An attorney for Barry, Michael Pelletiere,
declined to comment. SEC lawyers said they would attempt to serve
the suit on Zubillaga in Venezuela.
   The 15 stocks listed as involved in the alleged illegal trading
are: G.D. Searle &amp; Co., Textron Inc., McGraw Edison Co., Nabisco
Brands Inc., Houston Natural Gas Corp., Jewel Cos., Carter Hawley
Hale Stores Inc., Esmark Inc., Continental Group Inc., SFN Cos.,
ARA Services Inc., Holiday Corp., Crown Zellerbach Corp., Sperry
Corp. and Multimedia Inc.

<HEAD>Crude Prices Weaken, OPEC Production Rising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC's failure to rein in production could
continue to weaken oil prices this week, analysts say.
   On Monday, the September contract for West Texas Intermediate,
the benchmark U.S. grade of crude, tumbled to a five-month low,
closing at $17.91 a barrel, 12 cents lower than Friday's
settlement. The near-term contract last closed lower on Feb. 23,
when the price was $17.83.
   Volume was light as many investors were unwilling to make
commitments.
   ``Buyers don't want to buy this high and sellers don't want to
sell this low,'' said Linda Simard, energy broker at Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.
   Gasoline futures traded on the exchange also fell, with the
September contract finishing down 0.49 cent at 49.75 cents a
gallon. Heating oil for September delivery lost 0.63 cent to finish
at 48.55 cents a gallon.
   Crude prices have fallen more than $2.80 a barrel since July 5
as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries continued to
pump more oil than the market could absorb.
   Various estimates put OPEC production at 21.3 million to 21.8
million barrels a day in July _ nearly 3 million barrels higher
than this time last year and about 2 million barrels more than the
19.5 million-barrel ceiling set by OPEC when it met in June.
   ``One clear message seems to be that the system of proportional
quota increases applied in Vienna in June just doesn't work,''
Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, an industry publication, said in a
report released Monday.
   ``Revenue needs seem just as important as OPEC rivalries in
sparking increased production this summer,'' it said.
   The International Energy Agency estimates that world oil
consumption this year will average 52.1 million barrels a day, 2.4
percent more than in 1988, but demand appears to be easing.
   Too much oil last year led to a price drop of more than $5 in
WTI from $18.52 on April 18, 1988, to the year's low of $12.60 on
Oct. 5. While analysts don't expect anything that dramatic this
year they see prices continuing to weaken before they recover.
   Some predict prices could fall to $17.50 a barrel before OPEC's
next meeting, scheduled for Sept. 23 in Geneva, to discuss whether
to raise or lower the production cap in the final three months of
the year.
   ``Eventually people feel OPEC will get it together and prices
will get strong, but in the immediate situation, there's going to
be a little bit of pain,'' said James R. Fiedler, vice president in
charge of energy brokering for E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures
Inc.
   Dillard Spriggs, president of New York-based Petroleum Analysis
Ltd., believes prices could fall even further to around $16.50 a
barrel by the time OPEC meets.
   ``I see this continuing,'' Spriggs said. ``OPEC's productive
capacity is higher than people think and it's growing, particularly
because of Iraq.''
   Iraq said recently that a new export pipeline would add 1.5
million barrels a day to its current capacity by next year. The
repair of oil terminals damaged in its eight-year war with Iran
also is expected to expand its capacity.
   Weakness in the gasoline market also has pressured crude prices
in recent weeks.
   Exaggerated estimates of strong demand and concern about supply
problems due to the Exxon oil spill in Alaska, refinery maintenance
delays, accidents and production problems in the North Sea led
refiners to produce too much gasoline too quickly. As inventories
piled up because of slow demand, prices have eroded.
   U.S. refineries in recent days lowered the posted wellhead price
for WTI by 25 cents to $17.25 a barrel.

<HEAD>UAL Board To Consider Davis Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of UAL Corp. say they will give
``careful consideration'' to an unsolicited takeover offer from
investor Marvin Davis, which sent shares of United Airlines' parent
company soaring 28 percent.
   The offer from Davis, who unsuccessfully bid to acquire the
parent of Northwest Airlines earlier this year, reportedly values
UAL at $200 a share or $4.32 billion, although analysts say the
price could rise if others make offers.
   UAL shares jumped $46.25 to close at $210.75 a share Monday in
heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   UAL described the offer Monday as ``highly conditional'' but
declined to give further information. The UAL board will consider
it at a Wednesday meeting, officials said.
   ``While the board of directors has not decided whether a sale of
the company is in the best interest of the company's shareholders
and other constituencies, in keeping with its fiduciary duty, the
board will give careful consideration to Mr. Davis' proposal,''
Stephen M. Wolf, UAL chairman and president, said in a statement.
   Jim Fingeroth, a spokesman for Davis, said the Los Angeles
investor would not make any comment on his offer, which was
disclosed Monday.
   United is the nation's second-largest airline after American
Airlines in terms of paid passenger miles.
   The carrier owns 80 percent of its 408-jet fleet, the highest
percentage of ownership among the major carriers and a factor seen
as enhancing its value to suitors. Its other planes are leased, a
practice common with airlines.
   Earlier this year, United announced orders for as many as 370
new Boeing Co. aircraft valued at $15.74 billion.
   United also has a large route network in the Pacific, the
world's fastest-growing air-travel region. And last month _ one day
before the deadly crash of a United DC-10 near Sioux City, Iowa _
the carrier filed petitions with the Department of Transportation
for several new European routes.
   Louis Marckesano, an airline analyst for the Philadelphia-based
investment firm Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., said Davis' bid is
reasonable.
   ``What I expect is that it will trigger interest in the
airline,'' he said. ``The key is who will be new bidders, which
could include other airlines.''
   In 1987, members of the union representing United's pilots
proposed an employee takeover of UAL for $4.5 billion, which was
rejected as inadequate.
   Capt. Jim Damron of the Air Line Pilots Association said Monday
the union has not seen Davis' proposal, but that the union's
financial and legal advisers would study it.
   ``The pilots have a long-time interest in employee ownership in
whatever form that would take,'' Damron said.
   Davis, a former oil wildcatter who once owned moviemaker 20th
Century-Fox Film Corp., prompted a takeover battle for NWA Inc.
when he announced March 28 he had offered to purchase the Eagan,
Minn.-based parent of Northwest Airlines for $90 a share.
   The NWA board of directors rejected the offer, and Davis
appealed directly to shareholders with a tender offer. The board
then put the airline on the market, eventually selling it to a
group headed by Los Angeles investor Alfred Checchi for $3.65
billion, or $121 a share.
   UAL stock rose sharply as a result of the NWA bidding, going
from $117.50 in mid-June to $190 in late July amid speculation that
investors such as Robert Bass and Davis had purchased stakes in UAL.
   The stock settled in recent trading, closing Friday at $164.50.
But it soared Monday as word spread about the Davis bid, opening at
$196 and climbing to $210.75 at the close.
   The U.S. Transportation Department has indicated recently it
would no longer look kindly on leveraged takeovers of major U.S.
airlines, and Marckesano said a high-debt bid for United could draw
opposition.
   ``It would weaken the company to such an extent it would not be
a viable carrier,'' he said.
   But, he said, ``If someone with ample new equity like Checchi
makes an offer, I don't see that much room for Transportation
Department objection.''
   In reaction to Davis' bid, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. put United's
$215 million in BBB-rated industrial revenue bonds on review for
possible downgrading. Such a move would increase borrowing costs
for the airline.
   United reported a 14 percent increase in its second-quarter
profit from a year earlier. For the quarter ended June 30, the
airline reported net income of $141 million, or $6.52 per share, on
revenue of $2.5 billion. The company had revenue of $8.98 billion
in all of 1988.

<HEAD>HP Will Share Technology, Resell Samsung Workstations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. computer manufacturer
Hewlett-Packard Co. has signed a technology-sharing agreement with
Samsung Electronics Co. and intends to resell low-end workstations
built by the South Korean company.
   The move was seen as an effort by Hewlett-Packard to capture
more of the burgeoning worldwide market for workstations,
high-performance desktop computers priced from $5,000 to $100,000.
   By sharing technology on development of so-called reduced
instruction set computer semiconductor chips, Hewlett-Packard could
gain a competitive edge over rival manufacturers who are trying to
win acceptance for their own RISC-based chips.
   Hewlett-Packard is expected to devote it own manufacturing
resources to ``high-margin'' workstations and other products, said
Andrew Allison, a writer who follows the workstation market,
expected to reach $20 billion annually by 1992.
   ``Samsung is a very credible low-cost alternative for HP,'' he
said.
   Hewlett-Packard rarely has resold computers built for it by
others, and the move indicates how serious HP is in fighting for a
share of the workstation market, Allison said.
   Two weeks ago, Hewlett-Packard announced its first agreement to
share its computer technology in a deal with Hitachi Ltd. of Japan.
The two will develop super-fast computer chips to be used in
computers manufactured by both companies.
   Hewlett-Packard last year bought Apollo Computer, at the time
the second-largest maker of technical workstations.
   Samsung Electronics, a division of South Korea's Samsung Group,
manufacturers both semiconductor chips and computers. Samsung's
computers are expected to be in the $12,000 range.
   Sun Microsystems of Mountain View is among the major competitor
to Hewlett-Packard over the RISC chip and computer market.
   Hewlett-Packard plans to also share some advanced chip-making
techniques with Samsung, as well as a version of the its Unix
operating system. Samsung has the right to independently market
products based on the technologies.

<HEAD>Long John Silver's Parent Will Sell to Investment Groups</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A relatively low stock price and stable
cash flow has prompted directors of the parent company of the Long
John Silver's Seafood Shoppes chain to agree to be acquired for
$620 million.
   Warren W. Rosenthal, chairman of the Lexington-based Jerrico
Inc., said the stock price, recently about $20 a share, and cash
flow, $70 million a year, could attract unfriendly offers, a prime
factor in the decision to sell.
   ``Once in play, you're gone,'' Rosenthal said.
   Rather than leave the company open for that possibility,
Rosenthal said when he was approached with what seemed like a good
offer from the DJS-Inverness &amp; Co. and Castle Harlan Inc.
investment groups a couple of months ago, he decided to explore it.
   Jerrico's directors agreed to sell to the two New York-based
investment groups for $24.25 in cash per share of common stock.
   Rosenthal and David S. Weil, vice chairman, will retire when the
transaction is completed. Other executives are to receive an
ownership position in the company, which also operates Jerry's,
Florenz and Fazoli's restaurants.
   Jerrico got its start as the White Tavern Shoppes, a small chain
of hamburger stands begun by Jerome Lederer in Shelbyville, Ky., in
1929.
   It soon moved to Lexington and in 1946 started a Jerry's
restaurant. In 1957, under Rosenthal, it began franchising the
family-style restaurant.
   Its first Long John Silver's Seafood Shoppe opened in 1969. The
company, the nation's largest seafood chain, now employs about
18,000 people nationwide.
   But a mature restaurant business has slowed the company's growth
and price increases in fish in recent years cut profit below
anticipated levels. That prompted a slowdown in construction plans,
the layoff of about 60 employees earlier in the year and general
belt tightening.
   Such factors also have prompted speculation in recent months
that the company was a takeover candidate.
   In the past few months, though, Jerrico's fish prices have
declined, and cost cuts have improved its financial picture, said
Leonard Harlan, president of Castle Harlan.
   He and his fellow investors were attracted to Jerrico for those
reasons and because they believe that people, as they become more
health conscious, are eating more fish.
   Harlan's company owns the Peasant Restaurants, a medium- to
higher-priced chain based in Atlanta, and the high-priced Morton's
Restaurants of Chicago.
   DJS-Inverness recently has acquired the S&amp;A Restaurant Corp.,
which operates the Steak &amp; Ale and Bennigan's chains.
   The acquisition is contingent on the investment groups receiving
at least 51 percent of Jerrico's stock under their offer.

<HEAD>Reebok Decides to Buy Boston Whaler for $42 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reebok International Ltd., maker of
athletic shoes and clothing, is branching out in a new direction
with an agreement to buy boat maker Boston Whaler Inc. for about
$42 million.
   Paul Duncan, Reebok chief financial officer, said Monday, ``We
have stated that we were looking to diversify and particularly to
diversify out of footwear. Granted it's a long way from a boat to a
shoe, but we never wanted to be tied to a shoe.''
   Reebok's ambition tied in with plans of CML Group Inc. which
announced last week that it would sell off its Boston Whaler,
Carroll Reed and Sybervision divisions.
   Reebok said that under the agreement, to be completed in 60
days, it will also receive warrants to buy 400,000 shares, or 6
percent, of CML stock for $31.25 per share in the next eight years.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Monday, CML
stock closed at $26 a share, down $1. Reebok stock closed at
$14.37{ a share, down 25 cents.
   Boston Whaler, which will give Reebok a foot in the recreational
boating door, has about 500 employees at facilities in Rockland and
at Edgewater, Fla. It reported sales of $66 million in 1988.
   Reebok, a major force in sports and leisure wear, had sales last
year of about $1.8 billion.
   Duncan said Boston Whaler has an easily recognized name in the
boating industry with its ``unsinkable'' hulls, constructed with a
proprietary foam-core material.
   He said the boat company can do better than the 5 percent of the
power boat market it has now. Duncan declined to say what Reebok
plans for the acquisition, except to say there are no plans for
staff or management changes.
   Boston Whalers range in length from nine to 31 feet and sell for
$2,300 to $126,000. The company has had problems this year. It
announced plans to close a leased production plant and layoffs of
170 employees.

   The stock market inched higher this morning
toward new post-crash highs.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which surged Monday to
within 30 points of its record close reached nearly two years ago,
advanced 1.14 by 10 a.m. EDT to 2,696.13.
   Among broader market indicators, the New York Stock Exchange
Composite index of all listed issues rose 0.02 to 194.21. On the
American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 0.10 to 379.28.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5-to-4 on the
NYSE, with 534 up, 421 down and 555 unchanged. Volume on the Big
Board totaled 38.75 million shares after the first half hour of
trading.
   The Monday rally was incited by takeover-related buying and
waning anxiety over the possibility of recession. Many brokers said
that combination compelled many investors to shift more money into
stocks.
   Nonetheless, others question how long the rally will last. Much
of the strength in the market lately has been derived from takeover
speculation and computer-assisted buying strategies that aren't
based on stocks as a long-term investment.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 41.54 points
to 2,694.99, which is 27.43 points shy of the record closing high
of 2,722.42 reached on Aug. 25, 1987.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 1,056 up, 451 down and 472 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 197.58 million shares, against 169.75
million in the previous session.

<DATELINE>LOWELL, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frederick Wang, eldest son of Wang
Laboratories Inc. founder, An Wang, has resigned as president and
chief executive officer in a move the company called painful but
necessary in its recovery from major losses.
   The 11-member board of directors met at Wang headquarters Monday
night in a special meeting, where the younger Wang resigned.
   The board then named as acting president and CEO, Harry H.S.
Chou, who is currently a vice chairman and director of the
international computer maker.
   Frederick Wang, 38, will remain on the board and undertake
special projects, his father said in a news release today.
   A search committee for a new president was also formed.
   The younger Wang could not be reached for comment today. But in
a prepared statement, he said, ``I believe this action is in the
best interest of Wang Laboratories at this time. ...Employees and
customers will be best served by a speedy resolution to the
company's current situation.''
   An Wang called his son's resignation, ``in keeping with his
constant devotion to doing what he felt was in the best interest of
the company.''
   Last week, the company announced a $375 million quarterly loss
and suspended dividend payments. Its financial predicament put it
in violation of a bank-lending agreement, the company noted.
   Most of the loss resulted from a $237 million pre-tax charge to
cover the cost of a restructuring that involved closing factories,
cutting jobs in its worldwide work force of 28,000 people, and
lowering the book value of outdated assets.
   Wang stock has lost more than 80 percent of its value since
early 1984, when it traded at more than $35 a share.
   Wang closed Monday at $5.75 per share, up 12{ cents.
   Founded in 1951, the company made its reputation in the 1970s in
office word processors. But sales began to slip with the increasing
popularity of personal computers. Its minicomputer business fell
behind as well, eclipsed by workstations.
   In November 1986, the elder Wang stepped down as president and
was replaced by his son, a computer mathematician who had been with
the company since 1972. An Wang on Monday returned to work parttime
after recovering from surgery for cancer of the esophagus.
   Paul Henning, a Wang spokesman, said today of the action, ``We
wanted to give a consistent message that we are doing everything
and anything possible, even taking steps that are painful,'' he
said. ``We have a lot of work to do.''

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Las Vegas Review-Journal and Las Vegas Sun,
journalistic rivals for 39 years, have announced plans to merge
their business, circulation and production operations.
   The proposal is a move to save the Sun, which is losing about $3
million a year, has a debt of $10.7 million and has not been
profitable since 1981, according to the proposal for a joint
operating agreement.
   The Sun's founder and feisty editor, Hank Greenspun, who died
July 22, for years sought a JOA with the more powerful
Review-Journal. An agreement was signed by the two papers July 12,
and the plan was announced onday.
   If approved by the U.S. Justice Department, the plan will make
Las Vegas at least the 19th U.S. city to have a JOA.
   The agreement calls for both newspapers to maintain separate
newsrooms and separate weekday editions. The Review-Journal would
remain a morning paper and the Sun would become an afternoon
publication, but combined morning editions, labeled the Las Vegas
Review-Journal-Sun, would be published on Saturdays, Sundays and
holidays.
   ``Without this move we believe the Sun is in probable danger of
financial failure,'' Sun President Brian Greenspun said in a
statement. ``With this move, there will be no displacement of Sun
newsroom personnel and there will be the continuation of an
important newspaper.''
   The Review-Journal is Nevada's largest newspaper and the
flagship for Donrey Media Group, which owns 59 U.S. daily papers.
The Sun is the state's third-largest paper.
   Like many papers in a city with a dominant competitor, the Sun
has been losing circulation. It dropped 8 percent daily and 11
percent Sunday between 1980 and 1988, while the Review-Journal's
circulation increased 50 percent daily and 60 percent on Sunday.
   The Review-Journal's daily circulation at the end of 1988 was
121,321 compared with 50,515 for the Sun. Sunday circulation was
142,923 for the Review-Journal, 54,669 for the Sun.
   Under the JOA, the Sun would receive 10 percent of the operating
profits of the two newspapers and the Review-Journal would receive
90 percent, based on its stronger financial position.
   The Sun will give Donrey Media Group 10 percent of the
outstanding stock in Community Cable TV worth an estimated $20
million and an option to purchase an additional 35 percent of the
stock.

   Local pilots for Eastern Airlines voted by a
4-to-1 margin early today to continue their five-month-old strike,
and a spokesman recommended a national airline walkout on Labor Day.
   About 500 striking pilots and their spouses met for an
informational meeting late Monday with members of the national Air
Line Pilots Association, and voted 493-121 not to return to work.
   Pilots union leaders will take the results of the straw ballot
to Washington later this week where they will be discussed by the
group's 20-member master executive councl, which will plan future
strike action. Pilots were voting in other cities around the
country this week.
   ``There's no compromising,'' said Dan Klein, a pilot with
Eastern for 26 years. ``This has nothing to do about money. It's
just plain old dignity.''
   An ALPA spokesman said much of the sentiment in the closed
meeting was to urge a national suspension of airline service near
Labor Day weekend.
   ``It's easier to try to shut down the whole country than to
continue alone,'' said Jack Gray, a spokesman for pilots in
Atlanta. ``It would create political chaos and get presidential
intervention.''
   He said such a suspension was just a tentative plan.
   John Mazor, a spokesman at ALPA's Washington headquarters, said
the union's national leadership has not taken a position yet on
whether it would support a national walkout.
   He said the possibility of a national walkout was among the
topics that would be discussed in a meeting today between ALPA
President Henry Duffy and officials of the AFL-CIO. Mazor would not
say where that meeting was to take place.
   Pilots walked out on Eastern in March in solidarity with the
machinists union, which struck Eastern March 4. The airline a few
days later filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
   Eastern has said that under its reorganization it will need only
1,700 pilots. It said that by the end of last week 380 pilots had
crossed picket lines, 300 newly hired pilots had completed training
and 700 more were in training.
   ALPA has 3,600 members employed for Eastern.
   From the outset, Eastern management has said it doesn't need the
striking machinists union, whose 8,500 members include mechanics,
baggage handlers and other ground services workers.

<HEAD>Survey: Acura Buyers Most Satisfied</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Buyers of American cars may be getting happier
with their purchases, but the Japanese-made Acura once again
provides the most customer satisfaction, a new survey says.
   It was the third straight year that the luxury division of
Japan's Honda Motor Co. topped the survey by J.D. Power and
Associates.
   More than 24,000 owners of 1988 model cars were surveyed after
owning their vehicles for a year.
   Buyers of other Honda models and cars made by West Germany's
Mercedes-Benz and Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. followed Acura in
satisfaction. The top-ranked U.S.-produced nameplate was General
Motors Corp.'s Cadillac division, in fifth place.
   Owners of U.S.-made automobiles gave higher marks to their cars
and dealers this year than they had in the past, surpassing
European makes for the first time since the survey began in 1986
and closing the gap between domestics and Asian imports.
   Overall customer satisfaction increased this year as it had
during the three previous years, the survey said.
   The survey covered owners of 35 different nameplates. It
measured satisfaction in 23 areas, including courtesy and interest
of dealership personnel, convenience of service appointment times
and specific questions about vehicle performance.
   The survey was outlined in a news release from J.D. Power
headquarters in Agoura Hills, Calif. The full survey is published
in the August issue of the organization's newsletter.
   Acura, Mercedes-Benz and Honda were ranked Nos. 1-3 in this
year's and last year's surveys. Toyota and Cadillac swapped places
this year from last year's survey.
   The next five, in order of customer satisfaction, were Nissan,
Subaru, a tie between Mazda and BMW, and Buick, the survey said.
   According to the survey's point system, there was a smaller gap
between the top-ranked cars and the bottom-ranked ones, indicating
an increasing level of customer satisfaction among owners of all of
the cars surveyed.

   The Treasury Department announced today it is
resuming immediately the sale of special securities for state and
local governments.
   The sale of the securities had been suspended July 20 as a step
to avoid exceeding the national debt limit. Congress voted last
week to raise the limit temporarily by $70 billion to a record
$2.87 trillion.
   State and local governments buy the special Treasury securities
as a temporary investment vehicle for money they raise in the bond

   If the securities were not available for purchase, state and
local governments could be forced to cancel planned bond sales,
leading to turmoil in the municipal bond market.

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened mixed

   Callers dialing for operators reached recordings in 15 states
and the nation's capital as some 157,000 workers from three
regional telephone companies settled in for what many expect will
be a long strike.
   The companies urged people to dial direct when possible, because
such calls are handled by computer. No major delays were reported
Monday for those calling without operator assistance.
   ``We do have minor delays in directory assistance,'' said Bob
Chez, a spokesman for Nevada Bell, part of Pacific Telesis.
``People are having to wait a little longer. But other than that
things are going smoothly.''
   Operators, technicians, salespeople and clerical workers struck
NYNEX Corp., Bell Atlantic and Pacific Telesis, three of the
so-called Baby Bells, which were created by the 1984 breakup of
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
   About 157,000 union workers were on strike Monday, forcing
managers at the three companies to work long hours and learn the
strikers' tasks.
   The strikes by the Communications Workers union and the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers began over the
weekend over salary, companies' attempts to shift health care costs
to workers and local issues.
   Negotiators scheduled talks between one union and Bell Atlantic
today, but no formal talks were set elsewhere. Informal discussions
were being held, however.
   ``It seems like the sides are so far apart now, it could last
three weeks,'' said Tom Bonelli, a striking nine-year veteran of
Pacific Telesis.
   Arrests were reported in Boston, where 14 people were charged
with disorderly conduct for blocking a NYNEX building, police said.
   Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Co. brought a court complaint
against a union leader in Clarksburg, W.Va., because pickets kept a
supervisor and vehicles from entering and leaving the office. The
union called it a misunderstanding.
   AT&amp;T, whose employees are not on strike, filed a complaint with
the National Labor Relations Board before pickets withdrew from a
door reserved for AT&amp;T workers in a building shared with NYNEX in
Providence, R.I.
   In New York's Suffolk County, police said there were two
incidents of vandalism against New York Telephone company
equipment, but no indication that striking workers were involved. A
New York Telephone spokesman, Anthony Pappas, said a flammable
liquid was poured into locked phone line distribution boxes and set
afire, temporarily knocking out service to 1,900 customers.
   At NYNEX offices, 10,000 managers took the places of about
60,000 strikers.
   ``Things are going as expected. There are delays in directory
assistance and other operator types of services, such as people
needing help making collect or third-party calls,'' said NYNEX
spokesman John Bonomo.
   He said managers are working long hours, but ``it's a
morale-boosting kind of thing'' because people are ``working
together in a crisis.''
   The striking workers, however, yelled ``Scab!'' at those going
into the midtown headquarters of New York Telephone, a NYNEX
subsidiary.
   The workers also urged passers-by not to pay their telephone
bills.
   CWA has a national strike defense fund containing $17 million to
$18 million, and will pay strikers based on need after the second
week, CWA spokesman Stephen Early said.
   IBEW does not have a strike fund, and several workers Monday
said they were committed to the strike but worried about making
ends meet.
   ``The mortgage has got to be paid, and the state isn't in such
great shape to go look for other jobs,'' said Al Brown at a picket
line at a NYNEX special service center in Boston.
   NYNEX, with 60,000 strikers, serves most of New England and New
York state; Bell Atlantic's 52,500 striking workers were in
Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West
Virginia, and Washington, D.C.; and Pacific Telesis, with 44,500
workers off the job, serves northern Nevada and all of California.
   More states could be affected next week, as strike deadlines for
three other regional Bell telephone companies, with more than
130,000 union workers, are set for midnight Saturday. They are
Ameritech, US West and Southwestern Bell.
   A seventh phone company, Atlanta-based BellSouth, reached a
tentative agreement with unions representing 60,000 workers over
the weekend. That company serves nine Southeastern states.

   Stock prices were mixed today in active trading
but the Dow Jones industrial index broke through the 2,700 barrier
and inched closer to its all-time high.
   The widely watched index of 30 industrial stocks, which surged
more than 41 points Monday to move closer to its record high, was
up 6.38 to 2,701.82 at noon.
   The Dow Jones average last closed above 2,700 in August 1987.
   Advances outnumbered declines by three issues on the NYSE, with
679 up, 676 down and 518 unchanged.
   There was some early selling when the Dow index neared what
traders called a psychological barrier, but strong demand helped
prices crack 2,700.
   Airline stocks remained strong. UAL rose 6~ to 217| after

   Midway jumped 1{ to 20{ after Ampco-Pittsburgh Corp. disclosed
it had acquired a 6.6 percent stake in the company.
   Traders said the market derived strength from its technology and
industrial manufacturing sectors. Among most active stocks, IBM
rose 1{ to 118~, Digital was up 3~ at 101~, Dow Chemical gained 1{
to 97 and USX gained ] to 35{.
   Wang, the struggling computer firm, gained ~ at 6| on the
American Stock Exchange after Frederick Wang, son of the company's

   Monday's rally was incited by takeover-related buying and waning
anxiety over the possibility of recession. Many brokers said that

Aug. 26, 1987.
   Among broader market indicators, the New York Stock Exchange
Composite index of all listed issues was unchanged at 194.19. On

<HEAD>Korea's Samsung to Make Computers Based on H-P Chip Design</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. will
make chips and computers based on technology from Hewlett-Packard
Co., the companies said Tuesday.
   The alliance will heat up competition in the low-priced segment
of the market for workstations, which are souped-up personal
computers for scientists, engineers and other power users.
   Hewlett-Packard is hoping to use Samsung's manufacturing
expertise to expand sales of computers based on Hewlett-Packard's
design for streamlined, speedier computers. The design is known as
RISC, for reduced instruction set computing.
   Palo Alto, Calif.-based Hewlett-Packard also manufactures its
own computers but focuses on bigger machines with higher profit
margins. The new computers, which will be sold under the Samsung
and Hewlett-Packard labels, will be priced to compete with
top-of-the-line personal computers as well as low-end workstations
from companies such as Sun Microsystems Inc.
   Last month Hewlett-Packard announced a similar deal with Hitachi
Ltd. That one was for bigger, more expensive workstations.
   Hewlett-Packard became the world's biggest manufacturer of
workstations last year when it acquired Apollo Computer Inc.

<HEAD>First Traders to Appear in Court after Indictments Plead Guilty to
Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first two traders arraigned on charges
brought after a two-year federal investigation of fraudulent
trading at the world's largest futures exchanges pleaded guilty in
federal court today.
   The traders _ brothers Brian Sledz, 29, and James Sledz, 24 _
pleaded guilty to one count each of violating the Commodities
Exchange Act. The elder brother also pleaded guilty to one count of
wire fraud, and the younger to one count of mail fraud.
   The Sledz brothers, who traded in the Japanese yen pit at the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, appeared before U.S. District Judge
George M. Marovich.
   They are among 46 traders indicted Aug. 2 in the FBI probe of
the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade. Additional defendants are
scheduled for arraignment Wednesday.
   The charges in the indictments range from pre-arranged trading
to racketeering conspiracy and tax fraud. Most allege schemes in
which traders pocketed part of the profit from trades made for
customers while passing their own losses on to customers.
   The Sledz brothers were released on $4,500 bond each pending
sentencing.
   In his plea agreement, James Sledz named three other indicted
traders with whom he engaged in pre-arranged trades _ Joseph
O'Malley, Sam Cali and Michael Smith.
   His plea agreement said he executed pre-arranged trades to make
money for himself and his brother and mailed confirmation of the
trades to customers in violation of exchange rules, Pollack said.

   The U.S. dollar finished lower in quiet European
trading Tuesday. Gold prices were little changed.
   Currency dealers said the market's exaggerated reaction to
Friday's better-than-expected U.S. unemployment data left the
dollar ripe for profit-taking.
   However, many traders said they were prepared to move to the
sidelines until Friday when the July U.S. producer price index and
July retail sales data are released, shedding more light on the
state of the American economy and inflation level.
   ``There was a lot of speculation that people in the Far East
were selling a lot of dollars earlier,'' said Manfred Totzauer, a
vice president at Citibank in Frankfurt.
   Alfred Zapfel, chief trader at Bank of Boston in Frankfurt, said
the dollar remained stuck in a range between 1.8800 marks and
1.9200 marks and that he doesn't expect it to break out soon.
   ``I think the dollar wants to go down, but I'm really just not
sure any more,'' Zapfel said. ``There's just not a lot of desire or
ideas in Europe right now.''
   In London, the dollar fell nearly 2 cents against the British
pound. It cost $1.6250 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6075 late
Monday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.53 yen to a closing 139.25 yen. Later, in
London, it was down to 138.75 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid morning compared with late Monday:
1.8900 West German marks, down from 1.9055; 1.6270 Swiss francs,
down from 1.6380; 6.3995 French francs, down from 6.4470; 2.1398
Dutch guilders, down from 2.1502; 1,362.50 Italian lire, down from
1,373.50; and 1.1720 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1745.
   Gold traded in London at $365.45 a troy ounce late Tuesday, down
30 cents from late Monday's price. In Zurich the bid price was
$365.85 an ounce, up from $365.40 late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.18 to close at a bid $367.28
an ounce.
   Silver was quoted at a late bid price of $5.16 a troye, down
from Monday's $5.18.

<HEAD>GE Worker Sues Because Of Allegation of Homosexuality</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. fired an
engineer after a security investigation alleged he was homosexual,
then rehired him 17 days after he filed a federal lawsuit against
the company, the employee claims.
   James M. Wood claims in the lawsuit, which also names the
Department of Defense as a defendant, that his right to due process
was violated when he was laid off in June from his job as an
information systems engineer for GE Aerospace. The job required
government security clearance.
   On July 31, 17 days after he filed the suit, GE rehired him,
giving Wood a similar job in another laboratory and back pay,
Wood's attorney, Cletus Lyman, told The Philadelphia Inquirer.
   Wood called the new job ``a step in the right direction, toward
making decisions based only on my qualifications.''
   Wood and his attorney declined to say whether Wood is a
homosexual, contending that only the perception of homosexuality
caused his application to be derailed.
   In his suit, filed in U.S. District Court, Wood said one of his
bosses told him in May that GE had withdrawn the application for
security clearance. A spokeswoman for the Department of Defense
declined to comment on the lawsuit.
   GE spokesman Don Norton declined comment but said that the
security clearance ``is not a problem because this job does not
require the level of security clearance that was needed for the job
before.''
   In the suit, Wood, 26, of Philadelphia, said the defendants
violated government procedures by never giving him an acceptance or
denial of his clearance application or holding a hearing where he
could confront witnesses or examine the evidence against him.
   The suit, which does not ask for monetary damages, asks that his
application be processed without discrimination.

<DATELINE>NORWALK, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Technologies Corp. has taken its
Norden Systems subsidiary off the market after more than a year of
looking unsuccessfully for a buyer willing to pay what UTC thought
the radar-systems maker was worth, according to a letter to
employees made public today.
   The letter, from division President Edwin D. Decker, was
distributed to Norden's 3,500 employees Monday.
   Hartford-based UTC announced in April 1988 that it planned to
sell Norden because it didn't feel Norden fit into its overall
plans and would fare better as part of a large defense electronics
company.
   Norden, a $400 million-a-year company, makes radar systems for
aircraft and ships. It also has a contract to make radar systems
for the Federal Aviation Administration.
   UTC had discussions with several companies but ``had but unable
to conclude a sale on terms reflecting the true value of Norden,''
Decker said.
   Decker said Norden management had supported UTC's decision to
solicit bids for the Norwalk-based subsidiary.
   But he said the past year ``has been a frustrating and uncertain
period for all of us,'' noting the company had undergone many
changes, including an ongoing restructuring.
   Although Norden sales had fallen in recent years, the company is
now on the rebound and Decker predicted that Norden would
``complete its turnaround to again contribute to the success of the
corporation.''
   UTC's other divisions include Sikorsky helicopters and Pratt and
Whitney aircraft.
   Norden, founded 60 years ago by Carl Norden, developed the
Norden bombsite used in American bombers at the end of World War II.
   Norden spokesman Scott Brinckerhoff attributed the subsidiary's
recent problems on the fact that there are ``a lot of pitfalls in
building state of the art radar systems.''
   ``Ours is very high risk business,'' he said.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Tuesday said an
investigation was being conducted into the ordering by the former
Socialist administration of three Boeing 767 aircraft for Olympic
Airways, Greece's national carrier.
   Transport and Communications Minister Nikos Gelestathis said the
probe was being carried out by the new Olympic Airways board to
determine whether the contract was detrimental to the state and
whether its revision should be sought.
   The contract was signed last September by the Panhellenic
Socialist Movement (PASOK) of Andreas Papandreou. The party was
defeated in national elections in June amid allegations of senior
government members' involvement in a series of financial and arms
scandals.
   The government formed by the conservative New Democracy party
and the Communist-dominated Coalition of the Left and Progress has
pledged to perform a cleanup before holding elections in October.
   The 120- to 150-seat Boeing 767's were bought for $60.8 million
each and two installments have already been paid. Several press
reports have alleged that people close to former Premier Papandreou
took commissions from the sale, but no evidence has been presented
so far.
   Papandreou's new wife, former Olympic Airways stewardess Dimitra
Liani, sent a letter to newspapers on Monday denying a report which
claimed that she was involved in the purchase of the three Boeing
767's.

<TEXT>
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Tuesday reported a 22 percent gain in its
second-quarter profit, reflecting strong sales growth and inventory
control.
   Wal-Mart, a discounter that is the country's third biggest
retailer, said its income rose to $219 million, or 39 cents a
share, in the quarter ended July 31 from $179.6 million, or 32
cents a share, a year earlier. Sales grew 25 percent to $6.05
billion from $4.85 billion.
   Commenting on the performance, David Glass, Wal-Mart's president
and chief executive officer, said: ``Well-managed inventory levels,
better customer service, and solid sales momentum position us to
meet our sales and earnings objectives for the remaining six months
of this year.''
   In the first six months, Wal-Mart earned $417.3 million, or 74
cents a share, up 25 percent from $333.2 million, or 59 cents a
share, in the first half of 1988. Sales totaled $11.42 billion, up
25 percent from $9.13 bllion.
   Wal-Mart, which ranks after Sears, Roebuck and Co. and K mart
Corp., said it opened 28 new Wal-Mart stores and 3 Sam's Wholesale
clubs during the second quarter.
   The company, based in Bentonville, Ark., operates a total of
1,307 Wal-Mart stores, 109 Sam's Wholesale clubs, 14 Dot Discount
Drug stores and 3 Hypermart USA units.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain futures prices were moderately lower, but
soybeans suffered double-digit losses Tuesday on the Chicago Board
of Trade.
   A wave of selling by several large brokerage houses near the
close forced the November soybean contract to yet another low. One
analyst suggested the late selloff may have been triggered by the
leak of crop production figures from influential private forecaster
Conrad Leslie.
   Leslie's report estimated this year's soybean crop at 1.98
billion bushels and corn at 7.59 billion bushels. Leslie's figures,
above the averages of 1.95 billion for soybeans and 7.53 billion
for corn that had been widely anticipated by the trade, were
supposed to have been embargoed until after the close of trading
Tuesday.
   ``There wasn't any rhyme or reason to it,'' said Vic Lespinasse,
a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Chicago. ``The market was
on the defensive all day, but there wasn't any fresh news at the
close.''
   On the close, wheat was 3{ cents lower to unchanged, with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.91{ a bushel; corn was 1{
cents lower to { cent higher, with September at $2.24{ a bushel;
oats were 4 cents to 1{ cents lower, with September at $1.36 a
bushel; and soybeans were 9{ cents to 18{ cents lower, with August
at $5.92 a bushel.

   The dollar drifted lower Tuesday against all
major foreign currencies in listless summer trading.
   Gold prices firmed. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold
bullion for current delivery rose to $366.20 a troy ounce from
$365.90 late Monday. Republic National Bank of New York said the
late bid for gold was $365.70, up 50 cents.
   Currency dealers said profit-taking following a moderate advance
on Monday helped push the dollar lower, but trading was light in
the absence of any market-moving news and because many traders were
on vacation.
   ``There's really nothing happening. We're sort of in no-man's
land,'' said Robert Ryan, a senior trader with Irving Trust Co.
``The market is just moving on whatever customer orders come in.''
   The dollar moved sharply higher on Friday and continued to
advance at the start of this week on speculation that U.S. interest
rates aren't likely to decline soon. That sentiment followed the
release of better-than-expected employment figures for July, which
showed nonfarm payrolls risng by 169,000 and the jobless rate
falling to 5.2 percent from 5.3 percent in June.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.53 yen to a closing 139.25 yen. It fell
to 138.75 yen in London, and to 138.86 yen in New York, down from
140.05.
   In London, it cost $1.6250 to buy one British pound, compared
with $1.6075 late Monday. Sterling fetched $1.6255 in New York, up
from $1.5980.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8935 West German marks, down from 1.9160; 1.6288
Swiss francs, down from 1.6475; 1.17195 Canadian dollars, down from

   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.18 to close at a bid $367.28

   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery rose to $5.156 a troy ounce from $5.128. But
silver fell in London to $5.16 an ounce from $5.18.

<HEAD>Commodore Loses $8.9 Million In Fourth Fiscal Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST CHESTER, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commodore International Ltd. lost $8.9
million in its fourth fiscal quarter, blaming a strong dollar in
Europe and high interest rates in Australia for a 16 percent drop
in sales, the computer maker announced Tuesday.
   Commodore for months had been warning investors it would lose
money in the quarter that ended June 30. Its stock rose 50 cents a
share to $10.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   A strong U.S. dollar has cut into sales and decreased earnings
when exchanging foreign currency for U.S. dollars, the company said.
   The company plans to compensate for the strong dollar in Europe
by keeping price reductions to a minimum and warily increasing
prices on selected products in selected areas, Commodore treasurer
Carden Welsh said.
   High interest rates in Australia, another important market for
Commodore, hurt consumer spending there, Welsh said.
   The loss came on sales of $180.3 million. For the same period
last year, the company earned $12.2 million, or 38 cents per share,
on sales of $215.2 million.
   For the fiscal year, Commodore's earnings dropped 8 percent to
$51.3 million, or $1.59 per share, on sales of $939.7 million. In
the last fiscal year, the company earned $55.8 million, or $1.75
per share, on sales of $871.1 million.
   The company received a $1.2 million tax benefit in 1989 by
carrying forward losses from previous years. In 1988 the tax carry
forward was worth $7.6 million.

   Stock prices climbed again Tuesday to another
post-crash high as the Dow Jones industrial average finished just
under the 2,700 mark in active trading.
   The widely watched Dow average of 30 industrials rose 4.18
points to 2,699.17, just 23.25 points short of the record closing
high of 2,722.42 it reached on Aug. 25, 1987.
   The slight increase followed a 41-point surge Monday.
   After rising well above 2,700, the Dow average retreated broadly
in an afternoon selloff analysts termed a normal and measured
reaction to the runup a day earlier. The market regained some
ground in the last 30 minutes of trading.
   ``I think it was healthy we held yesterday's gains without a
backoff, particularly when you're near a psychological level,''
said Edward P. Nicoski, a technical analyst with Piper, Jaffray &amp;
Hopwood Inc. in Minneapolis.
   ``There's been no panic selling even though we've been near this
level,'' he said.
   The Dow average's flirtation with the 2,700 level has
resurrected fears from two years ago, when the market's historic
highs reached in August were shattered two months later in the
worst crash in history. The Black Monday panic of Oct. 19, 1987 has
made many investors cautious.
   ``The ability of the market to probe into the 2,700 level and
sustain itself has encouraged more and more people to become
bullish,'' said Charles Jensen, chief technical analyst with MKI
Securities Corp.
   Besides the Dow average, most other, broader market measures
already have reached new peaks, surpassing their 1987 tops.
   Good performances among select blue-chip stocks and
takeover-related news in the airline industry paced Tuesday's gains.
   UAL rose 8{ to 219\ after soaring 46{ Monday, when the company
disclosed it received a buyout offer from investor Marvin Davis.
   The strength trickled over to other airlines, with AMR up 2] to
73|, Delta 2\ to 76} and Pan Am \ to 4\ in heavy trading. Midway
jumped 1} to 20} after Ampco-Pittsburgh Corp. disclosed it had
acquired a 6.6 percent stake in the company.
   Among leading blue chips, International Business Machines rose ~
to 118\, Digital Equipment gained 3} to 101}, Eastman Kodak was up
1] to 49, Alcoa was 1\ higher at 74 and Boeing climbed 2{ to 53~.
   Wang, the struggling computer firm, gained 1[ at 6~ on the
American Stock Exchange after Frederick Wang, son of the company's
founder, resigned as president. The computer networking company
3Com tumbled 4] to 14[ in over-the-counter trading as its earnings
forecast was revised downward.
   Other losers included International Paper, down 1| to 55], and
Westinghouse Electric, off 2\ to 70.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
834 up, 688 down and 496 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 200.34 million shares, up from 169.75
million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in
NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional
exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 237.89
million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $3.21 billion, or 0.09
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.04 to 194.23.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 0.41 to 399.67, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index lost 0.06 to 349.35.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
1.57 to 463.30. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 380.96, up 1.78.

<HEAD>Ampco-Pittsburgh Announces 6.6 Percent Stake in Airline</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ampco-Pittsburgh Corp., a low-profile metal
manufacturer, announced Tuesday it has acquired a 6.6 percent
interest in Midway Airlines Inc. and may someday attempt to take
control of the mid-sized airline.
   Midway ``has no interest in being acquired'' and has not had
discussions with Ampco-Pittsburgh Corp., said David R. Hinson, the
airline chairman and chief executive.
   Midway is a 10-year-old airline that ranks 16th in size in the
United States, with 0.8 percent of the nation's air traffic. Its
hub at Midway Airport appeals to business travelers because it is
closer to downtown Chicago.
   Ampco-Pittsburgh and its subsidiaries _ which include Buffalo
Forge Co. and Union Electric Steel Corp. _ make and sell engineered
products such as fans and pumps.
   The company is a mystery to some airline analysts.
   ``They aren't a big player. I've never heard of them,'' said Bob
Joedicke, an analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in
Washington, Ampco-Pittsburgh said it had acquired 662,000 shares of
Midway common stock through a Delaware subsidiary, Ampco-Pittsburgh
Securities III Corp.
   In a statement issued in Chicago, Midway Airlines confirmed that
Ampco-Pittsburgh holds 6.6 percent of its outstanding stock.
   Ampco-Pittsburgh said it bought the Midway shares ``for
investment and to acquire a significant equity interest'' in the
Chicago-based airline.
   The SEC disclosure document also said Ampco and its subsidiaries
``may also consider seeking to acquire control'' of Midway ``in the
future, although they have no plans or proposals to do so at
present.''
   Midway was founded 10 years ago at the start of airline
deregulation, when it served three Midwest cities from Chicago _
Cleveland, Detroit and Kansas City, said spokeswoman Sandra Allen.
   The airline now serves 51 U.S. cities, from Los Angeles to
Boston, and from Chicago to Miami, she said.
   Midway recently announced it had ordered for 74 new jets from
McDonnell-Douglas Corp. worth about $2 billion.
   According to the filing, Ampco-Pittsburgh Securities III bought
the Midway shares at prices ranging from $14.75 to $18 between July
25 and last Thursday for a total of $10.3 million.
   Last week, Midway announced it had reached an agreement with
Miami-based Eastern Airlines to purchase routes, gates and aircraft
from the strike-plagued carrier for $210 million.
   The proposed sale covers gates at Philadelphia International
Airport and Eastern routes from Philadelphia to Montreal and
Toronto. It also includes operating slots at Washington's National
Airport and New York's LaGuardia Airport, 16 DC-9 jetliners and
spare engine and parts.
   The Canadian routes would represent Midway's first international
flights, Ms. Allen said.
   The agreement must be approved by a federal bankruptcy court
judge as part of Eastern's strike-recovery plan to restructure into
a smaller airline.

<HEAD>Oil Futures Prices Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices rose Tuesday in light
trading, pushed up by buyers hoping for a drop in oil inventories.
   The American Petroleum Institute's weekly statistics on oil
stocks were due out after the close of trading.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude for delivery in Septemer rose 21 cents to close at $18.12.
WTI, the benchmark grade of light U.S. crude, fell 12 cents on
Monday in another quiet session.
   Contracts for delivery later in the year also showed gains but
closed below $18 a barrel.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded gasoline
for September rose 0.69 cent to finish at 50.44 a gallon, while
September heating oil gained 0.12 cent to a settlement price of
48.56 cents a gallon.
   Except for a few upward blips, crude prices have been falling
since late July. The September contract has lost 42 cents since
July 25, when it traded at $18.54.
   Analysts said the latest gains came on expectations that last
week's hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico would reduce some of the
inventories that have been building lately. Sluggish demand and
excess production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries have increased the supplies of crude and gasoline in
storage.
   ``People were buying ahead of the APIs,'' said John Hill, energy
broker for Merrill Lynch Energy Futures. ``Because of the hurricane
last week people think there will be a drawdown in inventories.''
   The storm forced the shutdown of some refineries, delaying the
production of gasoline and other refined products.
   Despite the advance, some traders said the underlying weakness
in the market remains and prices could fall further.
   ``We expect prices to continue on a downtrend,'' said Randall
Rothenberg, trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``It might not be
tomorrow or the next day but we expect the market to go down before
it comes out of this doldrum.''

<HEAD>Cotton Futures Prices Rise Sharply; Soybeans Fall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cotton futures prices made an abrupt about-face Tuesday, surging
to the upper reaches of the daily trading limit after falling
nearly their daily limit in the previous session.
   On other markets, soybeans suffered big losses after a wave of
selling near the close, and crude oil futures broke back above the
$18-a-barrel plateau.
   The sharp price swings in cotton appeared to reflect uncertainty
over the size and quality of the crop in advance of a U.S.
Department of Agriculture crop production report due out Thursday.
   ``It seems the market at some point (Wednesday) discovered the
rains Tuesday in Texas weren't as beneficial as originally
thought,'' said Sandra Kaul of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., New
York.
   Traders speculated that extremely dry conditions in Texas may
have lowered the yield there, while unusually wet weather
throughout the growing areas of the Delta during the spring and
summer is believed to have adversely affected much of the crop
there.
   Many fields in both regions apparently have been so devastated
that growers with marginal crops are considering abandoning the
acreage or trying to plant another crop.
   Cotton settled 1.86 cents to the limit-up 2 cents higher on the
New York Cotton Exchange, with the contract for delivery in October
at 74.80 cents a pound.
   Grain futures prices eased slightly, but soybean prices absorbed
a more direct hit on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   ``There wasn't any rhyme or reason to it,'' said Vic Lespinasse,
a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Chicago. ``The market was
on the defensive all day, but there wasn't any fresh news at the
close.''
   The USDA's influential crop production report is set for release
Thursday.
   Wheat settled 3{ cents lower to unchanged, with September at
$3.91{ a bushel; corn was 1\ cents lower to { cent higher, with
September at $2.24\ a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 1{ cents lower,
with September at $1.36 a bushel; and soybeans were 9 cents to 18
cents lower, with August at $5.92{ a bushel.
   Crude oil futures, at $20 a barrel three weeks ago, had been
tending downward since. But the price climbed above $18 and held
the line Tuesday at the New York Mercantile Exchange, pulling the
products along.
   ``I'd call $18 more a psychological support level than anything
else, but the trade tends to rally on round numbers,'' said Jim
Ritterbusch of Carson Petroleum Co., Chicago.
   Crude oil climbed 3 cents to 21 cents higher, with September at
$18.12 a barrel; heating oil settled .12 cent to .49 cent higher,
with September at 48.56 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was
.20 cent to .85 cent higher, with September at 50.44 cents a gallon.
   Livestock futures were mixed, but pork futures mostly lower on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .60 cent lower to .48 cent higher, with August
at 74.30 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent lower to .15
cent higher, with August at 84.57 cents a pound; live hogs were .20
cent lower to .45 cent higher, with August at 47.10 cents a pound;
and frozen pork bellies were .98 cent lower to .02 cent higher,
with August at 25.37 cents a pound.
   Precious metal futures finished mostly higher in the wake of a
weakening U.S. dollar.
   Gold was 40 cents lower to 30 cents higher on the Comex, with
September at $366.20 a troy ounce; silver was 2.8 cents to 3.5
cents higher, with September at 515.6 cents a troy ounce. Platinum,
traded on the New York Merc, settled $4.10 to $5.50 higher, with
September at $485.70 a troy ounce.

   A year in corporate limbo ended for Norden
Systems Inc. with the announcement Tuesday that the subsidiary of
United Technologies Corp. is no longer for sale.
   The Norwalk-based manufacturer of radar systems and other
electronic military equipment was put up for sale in April 1988,
but UTC decided to keep it after receiving offers it said were
inadequate.
   Norden's 3,460 employees learned of the decision Monday in a
letter from division President Edwin D. Decker. The letter was made
public Tuesday.
   ``It wasn't a grudging kind of decision. It really wasn't. I'm
pleased to be able to say that, because if it was I'd really be
feeling bad and I'm not,'' Decker, who participated in the
decision, said during an interview at his office.
   ``They would be delighted to have us return to profitability,
and that's what we're going to do,'' Decker said, predicting Norden
would begin to improve its bottom line after 1990.
   Security analyst Michael Bunyaner, vice president of research
with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York, said Norden was pulled off the
auction block because ``the market is glutted with defense-related
businesses.''
   ``It's not as an attractive property as it was a year ago,'' he
said.
   Norden has been part of Hartford-based UTC since 1958.
   Decker said UTC came close to selling the company on more than
one occasion. But he said no offers were made that came close to
what UTC executives and Decker thought was a fair price for the
$400 million-a-year company. Decker declined to name the suitors.
   ``There was a lot of good interest by a couple of substantial
companies that were intrigued with our technological
capabilities,'' he said.
   Since 1988, Norden has eliminated nearly 700 jobs, including 400
that were announced in late May when a restructuring plan was
revealed. Decker said more jobs might be cut after this year.
   Norden has been posting losses since 1986. Those losses resulted
in part from cost overruns and demands for additional investments
in four new radar systems that were being developed simultaneously
by Norden for the military. Decker said the company spent
``hundreds of millions of dollars'' in development costs over the
past four years.
   In April Norden was eliminated in April as a subcontractor to
General Dynamics Corp. for the Navy's Advanced Tactical Aircraft,
or A-12. Norden had spent $114 million to design and develop the
radar system for the A-12.
   Norden has filed suit in Stamford Superior Court seeking
unspecified damages from General Dynamics. General Dynamics, which
canceled the contract because it was reportedly dissatisfied with
Norden's performance, has sought to have the suit dismissed because
of the top-secret nature of the project.
   Decker declined comment on the lawsuit, but said work on the two
remaining radar systems is progressing. He said Norden is in the
flight-test stage for both radar systems, the final step before
they are put in operation.
   Norden, founded 60 years ago by Carl Norden, developed the
Norden bombsite used in American bombers at the end of World War
II. Since that time, virtually all of Norden's business has been
for the military.
   Decker said the company has no plans to expand into
non-defense-related areas and soon will announce details of two
contracts signed in the past two weeks. He revealed that the
contracts are worth a total of $60 million.
   UTC's other divisions include Sikorsky helicopters, Pratt &amp;
Whitney aircraft, Otis elevators, and Carrier air conditioners.

<HEAD>Newmont Mining Reports Reduced Second-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newmont Mining Corp. on Tuesday reported reduced
second-quarter earnings of $7.2 million, or 11 cents per share,
down from $19.4 million during the same period in 1988.
   The Denver-based firm, which holds a 90 percent interest in
Newmont Gold Co. and 75 percent interest in Newmont Australia Ltd.,
reported that its quarter earnings came on sales of $174.4 million.
   During the comparable three-month period ending on June 30,
1988, when Newmont's per-share earnings were 29 cents, the company
reported $113 million in sales.
   Newmont said the most recent quarter earnings suffered from net
after-tax charges of $5 million for costs associated with a plan to
recapitalize Peabody Holding Co. Inc., and $3.6 million to revise a
gain recorded in 1988 on a discontinued operation.
   During the first six months of 1989, the company reported net
income of $16.6 million, or 25 cents per share, compared with
$133.8 million, or $1.99 per share, during the first two quarters
of 1988. Revenue rose to $306.7 million from $205.4 million.

<HEAD>Chinese Still Potential Customers for U.S. Grain; Timetable Unclear</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China still could be a big customer for U.S.
grain but recent internal turmoil could delay progress developing
that market, an official of the U.S. Feed Grains Council said
Tuesday.
   Wuu Hao, director of the council's operation in China, said the
country is short on cash to buy feed grain.
   But, with more than a billion people to feed, China needs to
have more grain _ both for feeding to livestock for meat production
and for making consumer products from corn flakes to beer.
   ``They have to improve the diets,'' said Hao. ``Without happy
citizens, nothing will work.''
   The Feed Grains Council will continue to focus on improving
livestock feed production in China and on teaching the Chinese
modern livestock production techniques, he said.
   The poultry industry holds the greatest potential for growth in
China because it offers faster profits and, as a relatively new
industry, faces fewer government restrictions, he said.
   But pork remains the main meat in the Chinese diet. Hao said 80
percent of the total meat consumption is pork, but production
techniques are very primitive _ usually a couple of pigs in the
yard eating crop waste.
   Only 10 percent of China's 300 million hogs are fed a modern,
blended feed ration, Hao said, adding that U.S. Feed Grains Council
representatives are working with the Chinese to change that.
   In addition, the Chinese have started buying better swine
breeding stock.
   Eventually, Hao said that will mean a demand for more feed
grain. But the Chinese currently can afford to import only ``wheat
flour to fill stomachs'' of the people, he said.
   ``The market right now is not very much because they just don't
have the foreign exchange,'' said Hao.
   ``It's still too early to assess'' the impact of this summer's
violence on trade with the United States, he said.
   Hao said he and the four people on his staff left China during
the fighting because they did not know what to expect, but have
since returned to resume work in China.
   Among their projects are sending 4,000 technical brochures on
livestock feeding quarterly to government officials, schools and
others who could spread the information; working with Chinese
producers on feed quality control to make sure animals are getting
the nutrition they need; and teaching feed management to producers.
   The U.S. Feed Grains Council, a private organization of farm and
agribusiness groups, was formed in 1960 to promote export markets
for U.S. corn, barley and sorghum.

<HEAD>Maxwell Confirms Interest in Buying Harcourt Units</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maxwell Communication Corp. PLC on Tuesday
confirmed that it is interested in buying some of the publishing
operations of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., the Florida-based
publishing concern.
   ``If and when the board of Harcourt decides to sell off assets
other than theme parks, we will be interested in acquiring them,''
Maxwell Communication said in a statement, confirming earlier
published reports.
   Maxwell Communication launched a hostile $1.7 billion offer for
Harcourt in 1987, but was thwarted when Harcourt recapitalized and
tripled the company's debt to $2.9 billion.
   In an effort to trim that debt, Harcourt sold its magazine and
school supply businesses, and in June announced plans to sell its
six theme parks businesses.
   Responding to a report Monday of Maxwell's interest in
Harcourt's publishing operations, Harcourt Chairman William
Jovanovich said Maxwell's comments were ``a footless attempt to
interfere'' in his company's business.
   He said plans to sell Harcourt's six theme parks and land were
``proceeding satisfactorily.''
   ``The company has no need and no intention to sell any other
part of its business,'' Jovanovich said in Monday's statement from
Orlando, Fla.
   Maxwell Communication last year acquired the U.S. publisher
Macmillan Inc. for $2.5 billion and Dun and Bradstreet Corp.'s
Official Airlines Guide for $750 million.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said Tuesday that
organized labor is at odds with the Bush administration on a number
of issues.
   But Kirkland, speaking at a news conference during the summer
meeting of the AFL-CIO Executive Council, the union federation's
governing board, said he didn't want to pass judgment on President
Bush after just seven months in office.
   He said the labor movement's disagreements with Bush are on
issues such as the minimum wage, child care and the Eastern
Airlines strike.
   ``That's not a very good beginning of a presidential term from
my point of view,'' Kirkland said.
   He said the federation supports the formation of a federal
emergency board that would resolve the dispute between Eastern, its
pilots, flight attendants and Machinists union members.
   Kirkland said the executive council will meet with leaders of
the Air Line Pilots Association about organized labor's efforts on
behalf of striking Eastern workers.
   Kirkland also said the labor movement remains viable despite the
defeat two weeks ago of efforts by the United Auto Workers union to
organize workers at a Japanese auto plant in Tennessee.
   Kirkland said the organizing efforts at the Nissan Motor Co.
plant in Smyrna, Tenn., have been deferred, not defeated.
   ``We have a long history of many years of efforts to organize
some of the firms we have succeeded in organizing in this country,
including the automobile industry, where our initial efforts were
defeated time and again,'' he said. ``But we persevered. We're not
defeated as long as we stay in the game.''
   In what was expected to be a close vote, Nissan workers on July
26 and 27 voted by more than 2-1 against unionizing the plant.
   Kirkland also said the federation is engaged in an experimental
effort to attract new members at plants that have yet to be
organized.
   He said the effort involves giving workers at plants targeted
for organization associate membership, with full membership granted
once a collective bargaining agreement is reached with the employer.
   The executive council passed resolutions Tuesday opposing
reductions in the capital gains tax, advocating the strengthening
of the Clean Air Act and criticizing recent U.S. Supreme Court

<HEAD>`Oracle of Omaha' Turns Sights on USAir</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Midway Offer, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nebraska investor Warren E. Buffett, often
perceived as a ``white squire'' riding to the aid of besieged
companies, has turned his sights on USAir Group Inc.
   Buffett has agreed to buy 12 percent to 14 percent of the
airline holding company's stock through a new issue valued at $358
million, a move that could block a hostile takeover.
   USAir stock closed Monday at $53 a share, up $1, on the New York
Stock Exchange. The announcement of Buffet's move Monday came after
the market's close. On Tuesday, the stock hit a high of $53 but
then slipped to end at $51.12{.
   The news of Buffett's purchase was both preceded and followed by
more takeover frenzy in the airline industry. Earlier Monday, an
unsolicited offer for UAL Corp. from investor Marvin Davis sent
shares of United Airlines' parent soaring.
   On Tuesday, a Pittsburgh-based manufacturing company said it has
acquired a 6.6 percent stake in Midway Airlines and indicated it
might seek to take over the carrier.
   The billionaire Buffett, known as the ``Oracle of Omaha'' for
his canny investments and forthright business advice, has a
reputation for taking sizable stakes in a limited number of
companies and holding them, sometimes for years.
   Buffett, who made a fortune buying little-known stocks, also
owns bi He owns the Buffalo News
newspaper.
   He played the role of friendly squire to razor maker Gillette,
the object of two hostile takeover bids in three years.
   Under the USAir deal, Buffet would agree not to sell the stock
to a bidder for 10 years without the approval of the airline's
board of directors, except under limited conditions.
   USAir, which has its headquarters in Arlington, Va., is
incorporated in Delaware. That state's laws make it difficult to
acquire a company without obtaining 85 percent of its shares.
   USAir stock has risen steadily in the past three weeks as
takeover speculation has swept the airline industry. Last month,
New York money manager Michael Steinhardt sent the stock soaring
when he told federal regulators he might try to take over the
airline.
   In a press release, Buffett said it was unusual for him to
invest in a capital- and labor-intensive industry. The USAir stock
purchase, he said, showed his ``high regard for (Chairman) Ed
Colodny's management.''
   Buffett is buying preferred shares that will yield a 9.25
percent annual dividend and can be converted to common shares at
$60 a share.

   Dart Drug Stores Inc., one of Washington's
best-known retailing names which now operates under the name of
Fantle's Drugstores, filed Tuesday for bankruptcy court protection
from creditors.
   ``We ... deeply regret having to take the step of filing for
bankruptcy relief,'' Sheldon Fantle, Dart's chairman, said in a
statement. ``Our board determined that it was far better to take
this step now, while our company has substantial resources to
implement a plan of reorganization.''
   Fantle led a group of investors that took over management of the
company in November 1987. At that time, Dart owed more than $164
million to bondholders and to its bank lenders. It has paid more
than $26 million in principal and interest payments on that debt.
   ``We came to the conclusion that the company simply could not
afford to continue to make payments on that amount of debt,'' said
Fantle.
   Dart operates 69 retail drug stores in the Washington, D.C.,
area, of which Landover is a suburb, and five Total-Plus discount
stores in the Richmond, Va., area. Dart has more than 2,000
employees.
   In the quarter ended April 29, it lost $7.3 million on revenue
of $39.2 million against a loss of $9.6 million on revenue of $54.1
million in the corresponding quarter a year earlier.
   In the nine months ended April 29, the company lost $16.6
million on sales of $128.8 million compared with a loss of $13.3
million on sales of $174.9 million in the corresponding
year-earlier period.
   Dart Drug Stores was founded in 1954 by Herbert Haft, who sold
the company to a management group in 1984 before going on to make a
series of unsuccessful corporate takeover attempts under the mantle
of his Dart Group Corp., which is unrelated to the drugstore chain.
   Fantle attempted to revamp the company by remodeling stores,
placing new emphasis on customer service, restructuring the
company's finances and starting an unusual plan to donate 5 percent
of the company's gross receipts to charity.
   The company filed its bankruptcy petition in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Rockville. Under Chapter 11, management may be permitted
to operate the company while developing a reorganization plan.

<HEAD>Dollar Opens Lower, Share Prices Edge Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   The U.S. dollar opened lower against the Japanese
yen Wednesday morning, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange edged up.
   The dollar opened at 138.72 yen, down 0.53 yen from Tuesday's
close of 139.25 yen. In New York, it ended at 138.88 yen overnight.
   Traders said the dollar's lower opening in Tokyo, following its
losses in New York, was mainly due to concern over the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board's monetary policy, which investors think might move
further toward relaxation.
   Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with the New Japan
Securities Co., said the dollar is in a downward trend.
   Market players were also reluctant to increase their dollar
positions ahead of the release of the U.S. wholesale price index
for July, scheduled for Friday.
   ``To see whether the U.S. economy is really slowing down or not,
market players are very much concerned about the figure as an
important indicator,'' Kanai said.
   ``The dollar edged up following last Friday's jobless rate
report, but the rate is going back to where it was before,'' he
said.
   Early last week, the dollar was trading in a range around 136
yen. But following the release of a lower-than-expected July U.S.
unemployment figure of 5.2 percent, indicating continuing strength
in the economy, the dollar moved up.
   He said trading Wednesday was light in the absence of
market-affecting incentives.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues gained 63.23 points to move to 34,822.71 within the first 15
minutes of trading. It had gained 129.10 points Wednesday, its
first gain in the last four trading days.
   Dealers said the Nikkei rose following the yen's strength
against the dollar, as well as overnight gains in the Dow Jones
industrial average of 30 major issues in New York. The Dow Jones
index rose by 4.18 points.
   Participants were mainly buying chemical, paper and finance
issues.

   Quaker Oats Co. said Tuesday that non-recurring
charges cut into the food giant's quarterly profit.
   For the quarter ended June 30, Chicago-based Quaker reported a
profit of $87.2 million, or 71 cents a share, compared with
earnings of $159.1 million, or $1.18 a share, in the same quarter
of 1988.
   Quaker reported revenues of $1.56 billion for the period, which
is the fourth quarter in the company's fiscal year, compared with
revenues of $1.49 billion for the same period in fiscal 1988.
   For the fiscal year ended June 30, Quaker reported a profit of
$328.7 million, or $2.56 a share, compared with a profit of $413.6
million, or $3.20 a share, in its fiscal 1988.
   Revenue for the 12 months totaled $5.72 billion, compared with
$5.33 billion in fiscal 1988.
   The fiscal 1989 results were offest by charges of $124 million
due to plant consolidations and overhead reduction, officials said.
In addition, a charge of about $26 million was taken for a change
in accounting proceedures.
   ``Excluding the various restructuring charges associated with
our steps to keep Quaker a low-cost producer of premier brands, our
overall performance was again at a record level,'' said William D.
Smithburg, chairman and chief operating officer.

   A call by Eastern Airlines pilots union leaders to
continue the 5-month-old strike has been swiftly backed by
rank-and-file members and should be reinforced in caucuses held
around the nation this week, union officials said Monday.
   Straw polls or voice votes in more than a dozen cities are
expected to underscore the pro-strike sentiments of Air Line Pilots
Association members, said ALPA spokesman Hank Weber.
   ``I think the union leaders were surprised at the resolve of the
membership to continue the strike,'' said Weber. ``It's plain we do
not want to go back.''
   About 500 Eastern pilots met in Atlanta Monday night and gave
the ALPA leadership a standing ovation when asked how they felt
about continuing the strike, union spokesman Joe Forrester said.
   The pilots were to vote later on continuing the strike. The
meeting was closed to reporters.
   E.J. Breen, national strike chairman, said Atlanta appears to be
a stronghold for the strike, ``as we'll see in the balloting.''
   But Jack Gray, spokesman for a group called Eastern Pilots in
Atlanta, said that pressure ``is building exponentially to cease
the strike'' because of the assessments of union pilots at other
airlines to pay strike benefits to the Eastern pilots.
   Votes on continuing the strike also are scheduled for Tuesday in
Washington and in Miami, headquarters of the carrier.
   Weber said ALPA members in other cities such as Boston, New York
and Chicago also have indicated strong support for the walkout.
   In Washington Monday, the Transportation Department warned
consumers who had purchased Eastern tickets before the strike they
must file claims with the bankruptcy court by Aug. 31 to be
eligible for refunds with interest.
   The same deadline applies to people with unresolved cargo or
baggage claims for flights scheduled before Eastern's March 9
bankruptcy filing.
   Consumers must file proof-of-claim forms with the court, even if
they have already sent a letter to Eastern or filled out a baggage
claim, the department said. The forms can be obtained at any
federal courthouse or by calling Eastern at 1-800-628-0010.
   Many of the 3,600 Eastern ALPA members were linked by a
nationwide conference call Sunday while the main meeting was held
in Miami. On Saturday, the union's 20-member Master Executive
Council, meeting in Washington, voted to continue the strike.
   Weber said members in all cities except Danbury, Conn., opposed
returning to work. In Danbury, members voted 40-22 in favor of
ending the strike.
   ``By a large margin, the guys are saying, `Don't give a damned
inch,''' said Lyn Williams, a pilots union spokesman in Herndon,
Va., outside Washington. ``They're pumped up.''
   In Miami Sunday, some pilots booed and stormed out of a
closed-door meeting after a return-to-work option was presented by
Jack Bavis, the head of Eastern's pilots union. One pilot pushed a
television cameraman who was outside the meeting room.
   Some pilots circulated petitions suggesting that ALPA's national
leadership was not giving full support to striking Eastern pilots
and advocated a nationwide pilot work stoppage on Labor Day.
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said a few pilots called
Sunday to indicate they wanted to return to work.
   ``The reason we walked out has not changed. There's every
indication that Eastern will be liquidated and merged into
Continental (Airlines),'' said Weber. ``If I wanted a job at
Continental I would have applied months ago.''
   Eastern pilots and flight attendants walked off the job March 4
in sympathy with striking Machinists.
   ALPA leaders still back an effort by Chicago businessman Joseph
Ritchie to purchase Eastern from Texas Air Corp., which also is the
parent of Houston-based Continental.
   Eastern, which has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization since March 9, has filed a plan to come out of
bankruptcy by year's end with an airline nearly two-thirds smaller
than its pre-strike levels.
   Eastern says it will need 1,700 pilots. The airline says about
380 ALPA pilots have crossed the picket line, more than 300 newly
hired pilots have completed training and 700 more are in training.
