   Park rangers and volunteers searched the
summit of Mount Rainier on Friday for a missing climber whose
partner was found dead just below the summit, Mount Rainier
National Park officials said.
   Park spokesman Cy Hentges said helicopters ferried four groups
of ground searchers to the mountain, but found no sign of the
missing man. A helicopter also was flying around the 14,410-foot
peak as part of the search.
   The two men were in a party of four men aged between 26 and 33,
all from the Lake Tahoe area, Hentges said. The other two men
notified authorities Thursday that one of their companions had died
and the other was missing.
   The names of the four have not been released. Hentges said not
all relatives of the dead and missing men had been notified as of
Friday afternoon.
   In all, about 21 people were involved in the search.
   A commercial helicopter was en route Friday to pick up the dead
man's body, which was found Thursday evening about 400 feet below
below Liberty Cap, Hentges said.
   Columbia Crest, at 14,410 feet, is the mountain's highest point,
while Liberty Cap, on the northwest side, is at 14,112 feet. The
third summit, Point Success, is at 14,158 feet.
   Hentges said the man probably died of hypothermia since he had
taken off his parka earlier and tied it to his skis. The parka was
still tied to the skis when he was found.
   The survivors searched the summit area and searched the eastern
side of the peak for the missing man before descending to the Ipsut
Creek campground to report the death Thursday.
   The four climbers, all of whom had skis to use on the descent
down the mountain's glaciers, started their ascent Sunday morning,
Hentges said.

<DATELINE>BASRA, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq is spending $6 billion to rebuild this
city at almost head-spinning speed, turning a town left virtually
demolished by the war with Iran into ``Iraq's most beautiful and
elegant city.''
   Workers have built bridges, replaced buildings, fixed roads,
added new water and electricity systems and have even begun
replacing palm trees decapitated by artillery fire.
   Officials plan to erect almost 100 statues of war heroes, with
their fingers pointing forbiddingly in the direction of neighboring
Iran.
   ``What we are doing cannot be compared with the sacrifices of
thousands of brave men who lost their lives in defending Basra,''
said engineer Nawaf Abdullah as he supervised a street repaving in
downtown Basra.
   President Saddam Hussein in February imposed a three-month
deadline for completing reconstruction of this strategic city
overlooking the Shatt al-Arab waterway, Iraq's main outlet to the
Persian Gulf.
   The deadline was to end May 12, but Gov. Anwar Sa'eed Hadithi
told The Associated Press on Friday that the renovation has been
extended to June 12 to cover more of the city and encompass new
projects.
   At least 90 percent of the buildings in Basra were destroyed or
damaged in fierce Iranian artillery barrages during the 8-year-old
war with Iran. Iranian troops reached within six miles of the city
last spring before being driven back, and Iraqis consider the city
a symbol of their defense.
   After the August cease-fire, the Iraqi government announced it
would rebuild Basra, and so far said it has committed $6 billion to
the project.
   Hadithi said six small rivers in Basra had been cleared of
debris, their banks resurfaced and 40 bridges constructed.
   A new electricity grid and new pipe network for drinking water
have been installed. Iraqi authorities have said they will build a
new drinking water processing plant in Basra that will tap water
from the Euphrates River near Nasrriya, 75 miles north.
   Residents consider the current water from the Shatt al-Arab too
brackish.
   Hadithi said the government offered unlimited money to finance
the development plans so Basra can be ``Iraq's most beautiful and
elegant city.''
   But the city still bears scars from the shelling, including
shrapnel holes in buildings.
   Hadithi said the city, Iraq's second-largest after Baghdad, is
back to its prewar population of 1.5 million. An estimated half the
population fled during the shelling.
   The government has encouraged people to return by offering plots
of land, cash gifts and loans or grants of up to $32,000 to build
new homes.
   The government also is offering similar incentives to get people
with no Basra roots to move into the city.
   Among the projects is the construction of 96 statues of senior
Iraqi officers killed while defending the city.
   The statues will be erected on the corniche of the Shatt al-Arab
with their arms pointing east, toward Iran, ``warning against the
dangers which have always come from Iran,'' the governor said.
   The government did not use independent contractors for the
reconstruction drive, relying its own men and machinery to do the
work.
   At least 100,000 workers and 40,000 machines from different
parts of the country were dispatched to take part in the project,
called ``The national drive for the reconstruction of the city of
cities.''
   Basra has as much strategic as symbolic importance to Iraq. Iran
insists a 1975 treaty that places the countries' southern border in
the middle of the Shaat al-Arab to still be valid.
   Iraq says the treaty is invalid and that the border is on Iran's
eastern bank.

<HEAD>Changes Planned in Indian Oil Rights Protection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new director of the Minerals Management
Service says the agency is developing a plan for doing a much
better job of protecting Indian oil rights.
   Barry Williamson, who took over April 3 as head of the agency
charged with protecting oil royalties to Indians, told a Senate
investigating committee Friday that he is working on a package of
changes from current policy.
   The special unit of the Senate Select Committee on Indian
Affairs spent the past week taking testimony from witnesses who
criticized the minerals service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and
the Bureau of Land Management for not fulfilling the federal
responsibility to protect Indian oil rights.
   ``The purpose of these hearings is to expose what has happened
in the past, but more importantly chart a new course,'' said Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz.
   When lawyers showed Williamson evidence the minerals service had
not acted in accordance with the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty
Management Act, he promised improvements.
   ``We can do better than we have done in the past'' was his
refrain throughout questioning.
   Earlier Friday, a homeless Cherokee-Arapahoe woman said she was
receiving only sporadic royalty payments on three wells in which
she has an interest.
   Mary Limpy, who lives in an abandoned house in Oklahoma City,
Okla., said the $30 to $60 payments she gets periodically keep her
on the oil royalty rolls and make her ineligible for public
assistance.
   Disabled by childhood polio, Mrs. Limpy cannot work and said the
state took away her two youngest children two years ago.
   She hasn't been able to get any of the federal agencies
responsible for Indian oil to tell her what has happened to her
payments, she told the panel.
   Mrs. Limpy said her wells originally were leased by the Tenneco
Oil Co. which sold the leases to Koch Oil. She said that at one
point, she heard the wells had been capped, but the farmer who
works the land where the wells are located said trucks kept going
on and off the oil field.
   Other witnesses told the committee that Koch, which is based in
Wichita, Kan., had been taking more oil than it had paid for from
Indian wells, a charge the company has denied.
   Mrs. Limpy is a participant in a federal class-action suit
charging the government has violated its trust responsibilities to
Indians with oil well interests, said attorney Steve Moore.
   Moore said the suit's plaintiffs include 7,000 allottees with
interest in 944 oil leases in western Oklahoma.
   That suit has been held under advisement by Judge Ralph Thompson
of the western district of Oklahoma for two and one-half years,
said Moore.
   A statement issued by Bob Dennis, court clerk for the western
district of Oklahoma, said counsel for both sides have reported to
the court that settlement offers have been ongoing while they
watched an ``almost identical'' case pending in New Mexico.
   The statement said the New Mexico case was settled by an entry
of consent decree in March, and that both parties in Mrs. Limpy's
case filed a status report last month that ``specific settlement
offers were forthcoming'' and that the parties would report on
their progress in July.
   The court said they waited on the New Mexico case to avoid a
potential conflict in rulings, to avoid delays in possible appeals
and to ``enhance the prospects of an agreed settlement in the
case.''

<TEXT>
   The attorney for former CIA agent Joseph
Fernandez says a classified documents law would force him to give
prosecutors ``a soup to nuts disclosure'' of the defense's case
before the Iran-Contra figure goes to trial.
   Defense lawyer Thomas Wilson told a court hearing Friday that
the Classified Information Procedures Act was unconstitutional and
would seriously harm Fernandez's case.
   Fernandez was the CIA station chief in Costa Rica when former
National Security Council aide Oliver North was helping supply
weapons to the Nicaraguan Contras during a congressional ban on
such assistance.
   A federal grand jury, under supervision of Iran-Contra
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, charged that Fernandez lied
about his role in the Contra arms network.
   The Classified Information Procedures Act would force the
defense to notify prosecutors in advance of the classified
documents Fernandez plans to use. Wilson told U.S. District Judge
Claude Hilton that ``100 percent of the domain of evidence is
classified'' and that Fernandez would have to ``reveal his defense
in a way that would be wholly unreciprocated by the government.''
   Iran-Contra prosecutor Geoffrey Stewart told the judge that much
of the information in the case no longer involves classified
matters and that the defense ``overstates what is required.''
   Hilton took the case under advisement.
   Fernandez, who used the code name of Tomas Castillo in Central
America, was charged with four criminal counts. He is accused of
obstructing inquiries by the CIA general counsel and the
presidentially appointed Tower commission that investigated the
Iran-Contra arms and money affair, and false swearing in connection
with those inquiries.
   The indictment said Fernandez falsely told the CIA that an
airstrip in Costa Rica, used to supply the Contras, was built by
the Costa Rican government to train pilots for a possible
Nicaraguan invasion of Costa Rica.
   Fernandez allegedly lied to the Tower commission by denying that
he knew the now-convicted North was involved in helping arm the
Contras.
   Each of four charges in the indictment carries a maximum
five-year sentence and a $250,000 fine upon conviction.
   Hilton noted that a hearing was scheduled May 26 on documents
that prosecutors might have to reveal to the defense. The judge
said that if he rules the government must give the defense
substantial information about the prosecution case, there would be
no harm to Fernandez.
   North's trial on Iran-Contra charges was conducted under the
classified procedures law, after surviving a similar challenge from
the defense.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After three years of court battles, a federal
appeals court ruled Friday to permit the Boston Police Department
to conduct random drug testing of police officers.
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of a police
department regulation issued in 1986 that requires random drug
testing of all police department employees.
   ``I am deeply concerned for the health and safety of our police
officers,'' said Boston Police Commissioner Francis M. Roache in a
statement prepared after the decision. ``They are human and engaged
in perhaps the most stressful profession in our society. Therefore
I believe that this drug testing policy is beneficial to the public
as well as to the police officers in this city and in the country.''
   The 1600-member Boston Police Patrolmen's Association, which
claims the law is unconstitutional, vowed Friday to take the case
to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Under agreement reached by both parties in the case, the
regulation will not be imposed until the appeals process has been
fully exhausted.
   ``These rules conjure up memories of George Orwell,'' said Frank
McGee, chief counsel for the Boston Patrolmen's Association.
``There are very major implications here. The broader question is
how far can the government go in searching the bodies of its
employees? Are blood tests and mandatory psychiatric tests next?''
   The two-page decision by the appeals court cited two U.S.
Supreme Court ruling in March that upheld the government's right to
require drug and alcohol tests for U.S. Customs Service workers
involved in drug interdiction and for railroad workers involved in
accidents.
   The Supreme Court ruled that public safety outweighs
constitutional guarantees against unreasonable searches.
   The decision reached in Boston was one of three suits filed by
police unions around the country against proposed drug detection
programs. Cases involving drug testing in the Detroit and
Chattanooga, Tenn., police departments are still under review.
   The appeals court decision stemmed from a suit brought in
federal court in October 1986 by Robert E. Guiney, president of the
Boston Patrolmen's Association. Earlier that year, Roache had
proposed mandatory random testing as part of efforts to ensure a
drug-free force.
   In May 1988, U.S. District Judge Robert E. Keeton upheld urine
tests of police officers as a result of suspicion of drug abuse but
ruled that a provision of the regulation imposing random tests
without suspicion was unconstitutional and was an unreasonable
search and seizure of an officer's body fluids.
   Drug testing of police officers has been a controversial issue
in police departments across the country. Most police departments
have attempted to test only those officers under suspicion or
involved with drug interdiction.
   In March, the Nassau County Police Department in New York began
random drug testing of certain narcotics squads. In New York City,
random testing for drugs was started last October among the
estimated 1,000 officers assigned to the Organized Crime Control
Bureau.
   In 1986, the Maryland State Police began a random mandatory
testing program for its members. The program was suspended after
eight months when the state attorney general advised it may be an
unconstitutional invasion of privacy.
   Miami police officers have asked that an annual mandatory drug
screening exam be written into their contracts.
   Approximately 5 million Americans are subject to drug testing
each year, usually as a condition of employment.

<DATELINE>HOT SPRINGS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. business leaders, saying they're
tired of warning about the ill effects of massive federal deficits,
expect a sharp slowdown in economic growth to result in
disappointing revenues for the Treasury and exacerbate the nation's
deficit woes.
   The Business Council, made up of 65 chief executives from the
nation's top corporations, predicted Friday that the government's
red ink next year will total $135 billion, well above the $100
billion maximum that is allowed under the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law.
   ``Every year I've been here I have to say the same thing,''
Edmund T. Pratt, chairman of Pfizer Inc., told business leaders at
this mountain resort. ``We in the business community are still very
concerned ... about the deficits.''
   Congress, after protracted negotiations with the Bush
administration, has drafted a fiscal 1990 budget that it says would
hold the deficit to just under the Gramm-Rudman limit.
   The business leaders were unconvinced of that projection, yet
somewhat encouraged that Congress and the Bush administration at
least were talking to one another.
   David T. Kearns, chairman of Xerox Corp., said the latest $1.2
trillion spending plan won't do much to reduce the deficit, ``but
the fact that they're not fighting, that they've come to step one,
is positive in my mind.''
   ``Step two will have to be for them to deal with it in real
terms, and it must be dealt with or we're going to have some
discontinuities that could be severe,'' he said.
   Roger Smith, chairman of General Motors Corp. and of the
Business Council, said the budget and trade deficits are being
closely watched because they ``have a direct bearing on our
industry and how people feel about the economy.''
   ``It's going to be a good year ... from what we can see,
providing nothing untoward happens in Washington,'' Smith said.
   Pratt said corporate officials are ``disappointed that a more
serious bite of the apple wasn't taken in the new budget.''
   ``On the other hand, we do have a feeling of encouragement that
at least ... Congress and the executive branch act like they're
more serious about trying to grab hold of the problem,'' he said.
   Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, ranking Republican on the
Senate Budget Committee, told the council in a private session
Friday that the 1990 budget would come in right around the
Gramm-Rudman target and was ``worth an awful lot'' because it set
the stage for further negotiations.
   ``I remain convinced that there is a very significant process
that has been set in motion that might address the deficit that
otherwise would go totally unattended and create grid lock and
chaos,'' Domenici said after the session.
   Rudolph Penner, senior fellow at the Urban Institute and former
head of the Congressional Budget Office, told the business leaders
the budget was disappointing because it again uses accounting
gimmicks to reduce the red ink.
   ``Every year we do a little bit; every year we claim we did more
than we do,'' he said.
   The Business Council is forecasting that economic growth, as
measured by the gross national product, will slow from last year's
healthy 3.9 percent pace to 1.4 percent by the end of the year.
   The council projected GNP growth of 2.9 percent for all of 1989
and 1.7 percent next year.
   Richard Breeden, a top aide to President Bush, told the council
that the recent slowing in economic activity was ``a pause and a
base for further expansion.''
   The administration is pinning its deficit-reduction plans on an
optimistic expectation for GNP growth of 3.2 percent this year.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American business community has
been able to operate successfully in Panama despite political
violence, government-fanned hostility toward the United States and
U.S. sanctions against the government.
   The community plans to stay open for business, but its greatest
threats come from long-range political instability and a continued
economic downturn, said a spokesman for the American Chamber of
Commerce and Industries of Panama.
   Companies gradually are relocating and will keep doing so as
long as Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega remains in power and U.S.
sanctions remain in place, he said.
   The spokesman, who also is a partner in a Panamanian business,
asked not to be named for fear of reprisal.
   ``I don't see any short-run solution,'' he said Friday.
``Members of the chamber don't feel our friend (Noriega) is showing
any willingness to move, and we have to make plans on that sort of
scenario.
   ``Companies that have plants here, such as Borden, probably will
continue as long as they can pay their payroll and so forth.
Others, like Kodak, which have regional offices here, may decide to
locate them elsewhere,'' he said.
   In the United States, Kodak spokesman Paul Allen said operations
have not been affected by the unrest.
   He said Kodak's fewer than 100 employees in Panama include a
handful of Americans, and they have not been advised to leave or
take unusual precautions.
   On Thursday, the U.S. State Department advised American
businessmen to make plans to get dependents out of Panama.
   However, one executive of a U.S. importing firm said he did not
plan to move his wife and children ``because we don't want to live
in an Army base.''
   Like most Americans contacted, he said he had encountered no
hostility from Panamanians or had any problems.
   ``The anti-Americanism just isn't out there,'' the Chamber of
Commerce official said. An anti-U.S. offensive by the government
found little support among Panamanians, he said.
   ``Panama has been a regional center for a lot of companies. In
the last two years this configuration is down at least 50 percent.
It will drop further if this thing continues much longer,'' the
spokesman said.
   A foreign business specialist, who also spoke on condition of
anonymity, said: ``In Panama, the key to Americans doing business
these days is, `let's make a deal.'''
   When economic sanctions aimed at getting rid of Noriega were
announced in 1988, there was widespread fear that Panama would
close businesses that did not pay required taxes to the government.
   That did not happen. The businesses, which hire thousands of
Panamanians and buy millions of dollars worth of goods from
Panamanian companies each year, stayed open.
   ``There certainly is some bartering of services to the
government in lieu of taxes paid,'' the specialist said, but added
that Panama also recognizes the economic impact that closing the
businesses would mean in a nation with a 20 percent unemployment
rate.
   Many executives of many multinational corporations, including
several leaders, have been replaced the past two years by
Panamanians, he said.
   ``The chairman of IBM here is a Panamanian, so is the chairman
of Colgate-Palmolive,'' he said. ``The banks in Panama are pretty
well locally managed now too.''
   The economic sanctions, he said, are more damaging to U.S.
business than to Panama's government.
   The sanctions prevent American companies and U.S. government
entities from paying taxes to the government.
   ``By Chamber of Commerce calculations all the taxes we should
pay and don't would keep the Panamanian government afloat for only
two days,'' he said.
   He added that many multinational businesses have been losing
money in Panama because of its economy, and some company officials
soon may decide to close operations there.
   ``Panama is a small country, and it would not be a major loss to
some of the biggest companies,'' he said.
   ``The tragedy is that once Panama loses those companies, it is
hard for it to get them back.''

   Donald Gregg, President Bush's
ambassador-designate to South Korea, faces further questioning by a
Senate panel about his knowledge in 1985 and 1986 of Oliver North's
secret network to arm the Nicaraguan rebels.
   On Friday, Sen. Alan Cranston accused Gregg, Bush's national
security adviser when he was vice president, of ``sponsoring a
free-lance, covert operation out of the vice president's office.''
   Cranston, D-Calif., said Gregg was making ``sweeping denials''
of his knowledge about the Nicaraguan Contra network ``apparently
in order to cover up the truth and to limit embarrassment to your
boss, then-presidential candidate George Bush.''
   Even though Congress at the time had banned U.S. military aid to
the Contras, Gregg said it didn't occur to him that there was
anything ``ipso facto illegal.'' He said former CIA operative Felix
Rodriguez had been focusing on alleged corruption by some of the
arms dealers involved in the network and didn't think that kind of
matter was sufficiently ``vice presidential'' to tell Bush.
   Gregg underwent a three-hour hearing before a Senate foreign
relations subcommittee chaired by Cranston, who said later through
an office spokesman that there will be further questioning on the
Iran-Contra affair.
   ``There's going to be another hearing,'' said the spokesman,
Murray Flander. ``The questions have not all been asked or
answered.''
   Gregg says he didn't find out until August 1986 from Rodriguez
that North might be involved with facilitating the supply of lethal
aid to the Contras.
   With support from Gregg, Rodriguez was sent to El Salvador to
help the air force there counter guerrilla insurgents. Gregg said
he didn't know until the August 1986 meeting that Rodriguez was
involved in helping the Contras.
   Gregg's training at the CIA and friendship with Rodriguez
``apparently led you to believe you could serve the national
interest by sponsoring a free-lance, covert operation out of the
vice president's office,'' Cranston said.
   The senator said a cover story about Rodriguez' sole mission in
Central America being to help the Salvadoran air force ``was
seemingly concocted.''
   ``I think it is a rather full-blown example of a conspiracy
theory,'' Gregg said of Cranston's comments. ``That's not what I
was doing. It is not what Felix was doing, to my knowledge. My job
was to keep the vice president informed. I did not have operational
responsibility for anything. ... To do that would have been the
quickest way for me to lose my job.''
   The ambassador-designate for the first time offered what he
called ``a speculative explanation'' of the fact that two April
1986 documents from his office said Bush was to be briefed on
``resupply of the Contras'' in a meeting with Rodriguez.
   ``I believe the agenda item was a garbled reference to resupply
of copters'' in El Salvador ``instead of resupply of the Contras,''
Gregg testified. He declined to specify whether he thought his
aide, Col. Sam Watson, or a secretary, had gotten the wording
garbled.
   Gregg recalled that at the time, Rodriguez was concerned that
helicopters being used by the Salvadoran military needed spare
parts. He said he came to the conclusion that the reference had
gotten garbled after seeing galleys of a book Rodriguez recently
completed.

<HEAD>OAS Foreign Ministers To Meet on Panama</HEAD>

   The Bush administration is preparing to lobby
hard for a tough resolution denouncing Panamanian leader Manuel
Antonio Noriega when Organization of American States foreign
ministers meet next week to discuss the Panama crisis.
   But Panamanian authorities are expected to blame the upheaval in
their country on what they regard as systematic U.S. intervention
in Panama's internal affairs.
   The OAS permanent council on Friday approved a Venezuelan
proposal for the OAS foreign ministers to meet next Wednesday to
discuss the ``serious crisis'' in Panama.
   While many delegates expressed concern about the interruption of
the election process and the violence directed against some
Panamanian opposition leaders, others argued against interfering in
Panama's internal affairs.
   Panama's representative, Carlos Russell, used the occasion to
blast U.S. actions, saying, ``We will not bow to the colossus of
the north.''
   He cited reports alleging that the Bush administration donated
$10 million to the opposition candidate's campaign. He also said
the U.S. government had funded a clandestine anti-government radio
operation, that preparations were being made to scuttle the Panama
Canal treaties and that U.S. military forces in Panama are engaged
in hostile military maneuvers.
   But the U.S. delegate, William Pryce, said that in the interest
of the people of Panama the OAS must raise its collective voice
``against the dictator Noriega and demand that he respect the will
of the courageous people of Panama.''
   On Thursday, the State Department began referring to the
opposition candidate, Guillermo Endara, as the president-elect of
Panama, based on exit polls showing he had a sizeable lead over the
pro-Noriega candidate, Carlos Duque.
   U.S. officials, who asked not to be identified, said there
seemed to be little likelihood that the OAS foreign ministers would
designate Endara as the winner. There also was some doubt that the
OAS would approve a resolution condemning Noriega, the officials
said.
   The United States was expected to fight hard for a toughly
worded resolution, but strong resistance was anticipated from a
number of countries, especially Mexico and Nicaragua, both of which
attach high priority to the principle of non-interference.
   Even Venezuela, which initiated the call for a foreign ministers
meeting, was restrained in outlining its reasons.
   Ambassador Edilberto Moreno made no direct reference to Noriega,
saying only that ``the popular will'' of hemispheric nations must
be respected and that a meeting of foreign ministers at this time
is appropriate given the ``grave crisis'' in Panama.
   The strongest anti-Noriega statement during the meeting was
delivered by Jamaican Ambassador Keith Johnson, who denounced
``this blatant rape of democracy'' in Panama.

<HEAD>Cape Cod Dune Shacks Win Historic Designation, Future Still In Doubt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seventeen rustic shacks on the outer dunes of
Cape Cod could still be ripped down even though the huts, which
provided soul-searching solitude to Eugene O'Neill, Jack Kerouac
and scores of other creative minds, have won national historic
designation.
   The National Park Service on Friday placed the primitive huts on
the National Register of Historic Places over the objections of
regional officials at the Cape Cod National Seashore.
   ``The dune shacks are an important part of the pattern of
artistic and cultural life on the outer Cape and merit the
protection and recognition of the National Register,'' said
Massachusetts Secretary of State Michael Connolly, chairman of the
Massachusetts Historical Commission that pushed for the designation.
   But Herbert Cables, regional director of the Park Service in
Boston, said earlier this year that a historic designation
``affords no guarantee of protection.''
   ``The National Park Service could raze these shacks. There's
still potential for that to happen,'' said Edie Shean-Hammond, a
regional Park Service spokeswoman in Boston.
   But she said regional officials vowed in December that all the
huts would be preserved until plans for the area are completed. She
said preservation of the dune shacks in those plans ``is under full
consideration.''
   ``For the next few years, we don't see anything happening at
all,'' Shean-Hammond said.
   Gail Cohen, a dune hut activist, remained skeptical.
   ``All I know is for 30 years they've been doing everything they
could to destroy these shacks,'' she said.
   Cohen called the historic designation ``a small victory, but it
really doesn't mean a lot. It's still up to the National Seashore
(officials) to decide what to do with them.''
   She said three of the shacks have been razed since 1984 and two
of the remaining 17 had been slated for destruction.
   The one- and two-room gray shingled beach huts lie between Truro
and Provincetown near the tip of Cape Cod.
   Built in the 1920s and 1930s by the Coast Guard as shelters, the
weather-beaten shacks offer none of the conveniences of modern
life, such as electricity and plumbing. But they provide peaceful
hideaways in a strikingly unspoiled setting reachable only by
four-wheel drive vehicles or walking.
   ``Yes, residence on the dunes ... is uniquely sheltering and
certainly stimulating to creative work,'' Kerouac wrote in a 1963
letter. ``It's true that I was working on `On the Road' there,
summer of 1950.''
   Preservationists say the shacks have been used by O'Neill,
Kerouac, poet e.e. cummings, author Norman Mailer and scores of
lesser-known painters, poets, playwrights and novelists, earning
them a place in American history and worthy of protection.
   The shacks came under Park Service control in 1961 when the
government purchased 27,000 acres of outer Cape land for the Cape
Cod National Seashore. A private group has been managing the rustic
huts, renting them for $150 a week.
   Park Service officials in Boston previously had maintained that
the dune shacks did not have the architectural or historic value to
warrant preservation. The service had indicated the shacks would be
demolished after leases with the current owners expire over the
next 16 years.

<HEAD>Space Council Seeks to Extend Landsat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA M. HAMM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Space Council is urging President
Bush to commit to funding the Landsat earth-sensing satellites,
which were almost shut down in March, through fiscal 1991.
   The council, under the leadership of Vice President Dan Quayle,
made the recommendation Friday.
   ``This signifies a real commitment of the Bush-Quayle
administration to be aggressive in space,'' said an administration
official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   The Landsat program, launched in 1978, has long been plagued by
funding uncertainty because the Reagan administration had hoped to
commercialize it. That proved not to be feasible, the source said.
   ``For the first time, the administration has stepped forward and
said it (Landsat) could not be fully commercialized well into the
21st century,'' the source said. ``The demand for the data has not
grown as rapidly as early forecasts had projected.''
   Indeed, the federal government is Landsat's biggest client,
although 13 countries have bought Landsat stations, he said.
   The Landsat satellites were due to be turned off March 31, when
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was to run out
of money to operate them.
   But Quayle announced on March 6 that he had gained a commitment
for funds to keep the program going until the space council, which
studies national space programs, completed a review.
   Two satellites currently are in operation, Landsat 4 and Landsat
5. They provide photos for mineral exploration, checking soil
conditions and vegetation, urban and rural planning, monitoring
volcanoes and tracing ocean currents. But both have been running
well beyond their expected lifetimes and are no longer fully
functional.
   An improved satellite, Landsat 6, is scheduled to be launched in
1991.
   The space council recommended money be made available to
continue operations of Landsat 4 and Landsat 5 through fiscal 1990.
That, combined with the $200 million already committed to launching
Landsat 6 in 1991, ``will give you data continuity until 1996,''
the source said.
   However, the source of funding after fiscal 1991 remained a
question. The space council directed the Office of Management and
Budget and council staff to focus on ways to keep the data flowing.
   The council's decision calls for user departments and agencies
such as the Interior, Agriculture, Commerce and Defense departments
and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to provide
the $5 million needed to continue the program through the remainder
of fiscal 1989.
   The space council hopes to obtain $19 million needed for the
1990 fiscal year through a supplemental request for the Commerce
Department's budget, the source said.
   ``We've already paid almost $200 million for Landsat 6,'' the
official said. ``This signals commitment in the long run, and the
United States' continued leadership in space and space technology.''
   The official said Quayle demonstrated during the meeting the
satellites' ability to highlight environmental concerns.
   ``The vice president had in the room images from April 7 from
the Valdez oil spill in Alaska, and you could clearly see where the
oil spill was,'' the administration official said. ``You could
clearly see that Landsat can have real use to environmental
matters.''

<HEAD>Railroad Administration Says It Wasn't To Blame for Iowa Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Railroad Administration was
unfairly blamed for contributing to a fiery train collision in Iowa
last summer that killed two people, an FRA official said today.
   The complaint was voiced by S. Mark Lindsey, chief counsel for
the agency, in a letter to the National Transportation Safety Board.
   The NTSB said last Tuesday that failures by the Iowa Interstate
Railroad and the FRA to enforce train operating rules were part of
what caused the July 30 head-on crash between two freight trains.
   Two crewmen on a westbound train were killed when it collided
with an eastbound train at Altoona. More than 2,000 people were
evacuated from their homes as two tank cars containing 20,000
gallons of denatured alcohol burned for more than two days.
   The NTSB blamed Iowa Interstate, which operated both trains, and
said the eastbound train had been operated by a fatigued crew.
   The panel also blamed the FRA for failing to act against Iowa
Interstate.
   Lindsey, in a letter to the NTSB, said the criticism of the FRA
``is not only unfounded; it demonstrates a basic lack of
understanding of the difference between a railroad's own rules and
federal regulations, and it evidences a remarkable ignorance of
FRA's rail safety program and rules.''
   The crash was caused by one train leaving too early in violation
of an internal railroad order, Lindsey said.
   ``To state the elementary, violation of a train order
constitutes a violation of railroad rules, not federal regulations;
responsibility for enforcing compliance with the railroad's own
rules is the railroad's, not FRA's,'' he wrote.
   ``FRA is not the guarantor of rail safety,'' he said. ``Instead,
its mission is to develop appropriate safety standards for the
industry, to monitor railroad compliance and to conduct an
enforcement effort that will have a deterrent effect overall.''
   ``FRA cannot prevent every instance of non-compliance, nor can
it control the propensity for human beings to make bad decisions or
to behave negligently,'' he said.

   Here is the prepared text of
President Bush's speech Friday to graduating seniors at Texas A&amp;M
University.
   My sincerest congratulations go to every graduate, and to your
parents.
   In this ceremony, we celebrate nothing less than the
commencement of the rest, and the best, of your life.
   When you look back to your days at Texas A&amp;M, you will have a
lot to be proud of _ a university that is first in baseball and
first in service to our nation.
   Many are the heroes whose names are called at Muster. Many are
those you remember in Silver Taps.
   We are reminded that no generation can escape history.
   Parents _ we share a fervent desire for our children, and their
children, to know a better world, a safer world.
   Students _ your parents and grandparents have lived through a
world war, and helped America to rebuild the world.
   They witnessed the drama of postwar nations divided by Soviet
subversion and force, but sustained by an allied response most
vividly seen in the Berlin Airlift.
   Wise men _ Truman and Eisenhower, Vandenberg and Rayburn _
Marshall, Acheson and Kennan _ crafted the strategy of containment.
   They believed that the Soviet Union, denied the easy course of
expansion, would turn inward and address the contradictions of its
inefficient, repressive and inhumane system.
   And they were right.
   The Soviet Union is now publicly facing this hard reality.
   Containment worked.
   Containment worked because our democratic principles,
institutions and values are sound, and always have been.
   It worked because our alliances were and are strong; and because
the superiority of free societies and free markets over stagnant
socialism is undeniable.
   We are approaching the conclusion of an historic postwar
struggle between two visions _ one of tyranny and conflict, and one
of democracy and freedom.
   The review of U.S.-Soviet relations that my administration has
just completed outlines a new path toward resolving this struggle.

<HEAD>COLLEGE STATION, Texas: this struggle.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Our goal is bold _ more ambitious than any of my predecessors
might have thought possible.
   Our review indicates that 40 years of perseverance have brought
us a precious opportunity.
   Now it is time to move beyond containment, to a new policy for
the 1990s _ one that recognizes the full scope of change taking
place around the world, and in the Soviet Union itself.
   In sum, the United States now has as its goal much more than
simply containing Soviet expansionism _ we seek the integration of
the Soviet Union into the community of nations.
   As the Soviet Union moves toward greater openness and
democratization _ as they meet the challenge of responsible
international behavior _ we will match their steps with steps of
our own.
   Ultimately, our objective is to welcome the Soviet Union back
into the world order.
   The Soviet Union says it seeks to make peace with the world, and
criticizes its own postwar policies.
   These are words we can only applaud.
   But a new relationship cannot be simply declared by Moscow, or
bestowed by others.
   It must be earned.
   It must be earned because promises are never enough.
   The Soviet Union has promised a more cooperative relationship
before, only to reverse course and return to militarism.
   Soviet foreign policy has been almost seasonal _ warmth before
cold, thaw before freeze.
   We seek a friendship that knows no season of suspicion, no chill
of distrust.
   We hope perestroika is pointing the Soviet Union to a break with
the cycles of the past _ a definitive break.
   Who would have thought we would see the deliberations of the
Central Committee on the front page of Pravda, or dissident Andrei
Sakharov seated near the councils of power?
   Who would have imagined a Soviet leader who canvasses the
sidewalks of Moscow and Washington, D.C.?
   These are hopeful _ indeed, remarkable _ signs.
   Let no one doubt our sincere desire to see perestroika continue
and succeed.
   But the national security of America and our allies is not
predicated on hope.
   It must be based on deeds.
   We look for enduring, ingrained economic and political change.

<TEXT>
   While we hope to move beyond containment, we are only at the
beginning of our new path.
   Many dangers and uncertainties are ahead.
   We must not forget that the Soviet Union has acquired awesome
military capabilities.
   That was a fact of life for my predecessors.
   That has always been a fact of life for our allies.
   And that is a fact of life for me.
   As we seek peace, we must also remain strong.
   The purpose of our military might is not to pressure a weak
Soviet economy, or to seek military superiority.
   It is to deter war.
   It is to defend ourselves and our allies, and to do something
more _ to convince the Soviet Union that there can be no reward in
pursuing expansionism _ to convince the Soviet Union that reward
lies in the pursuit of peace.
   Western policies must encourage the evolution of the Soviet
Union toward an open society.
   This task will test our strength.
   It will tax our patience.
   And it will require a sweeping vision _ let me share with you my
vision.
   I see a Western Hemisphere of democratic, prosperous nations, no
longer threatened by a Cuba or a Nicaragua armed by Moscow.
   I see a Soviet Union that pulls away from ties to terrorist
nations _ like Libya _ that threaten the legitimate security of
their neighbors.
   I see a Soviet Union which respects China's integrity, and
returns the Northern Territories of Japan; a prelude to the day
when all the great nations of Asia will live in harmony.
   But the fulfillment of this vision requires the Soviet Union to
take positive steps, including:
   First: Reduce Soviet forces. Although some small steps have
already been taken, the Warsaw Pact still possesses more than
30,000 tanks, more than twice as much artillery and hundreds of
thousands more troops in Europe than NATO. They should cut their
forces to less threatening levels, in proportion to their
legitimate security needs.
   Second: Adhere to the Soviet obligation _ promised in the final
days of World War II _ to support self-determination for all the
nations of Eastern and Central Europe. This requires specific
abandonment of the Brezhnev Doctrine. One day it should be possible
to drive from Moscow to Munich without seeing a single guard tower
or a strand of barbed wire. In short, tear down the Iron Curtain.

<TEXT>
   Third: Work with the West in positive, practical _ not merely
rhetorical _ steps toward diplomatic solutions to regional disputes
around the world. I welcome the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan
and the Angola agreement. But there is much more to be done around
the world. We're ready. Let's roll up our sleeves and get to work.
   Fourth: Achieve a lasting political pluralism and respect for
human rights. Dramatic events have already occurred in Moscow. We
are impressed by limited, but freely contested, elections. We are
impressed by a greater toleration of dissent. We are impressed by a
new frankness about the Stalin era. Mr. Gorbachev, don't stop now.
   Fifth: Join with us in addressing pressing global problems,
including the international drug menace, and dangers to the
environment. We can build a better world for our children.
   As the Soviet Union moves toward arms reduction and reform, it
will find willing partners in the West.
   We seek verifiable, stabilizing arms control and arms reduction
agreements with the Soviet Union and its allies.
   However, arms control is not an end in itself, but a means of
contributing to the security of America, and the peace of the world.
   I directed Secretary Baker to propose to the Soviets that we
resume negotiations on strategic forces in June.
   And, as you know, the Soviets have agreed.
   Our basic approach is clear.
   In the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks, we wish to reduce the
risk of nuclear war.
   In the companion Defense and Space Talks, our objective will be
to preserve our options to deploy advanced defenses when they are
ready.
   In nuclear testing we will continue to seek the necessary
verification improvements in existing treaties to permit them to be
brought into force.
   We will continue to seek a verifiable global ban on chemical
weapons.
   We support NATO efforts to reduce the Soviet offensive threat in
the negotiations on Conventional Forces in Europe.
   And, as I've said, fundamental to all of these objectives is
simple openness.

<TEXT>
   Make no mistake, a new breeze is blowing across the steppes and
cities of the Soviet Union.
   Why not, then, let this spirit of openness grow, let more
barriers come down.
   Open emigration, open debate, open airwaves _ let openness come
to mean the publication and sale of banned books and newspapers in
the Soviet Union.
   Let the 19,000 Soviet Jews who emigrated last year be followed
by any number who wish to emigrate this year.
   Let openness come to mean nothing less than the free exchange of
people, books and ideas between East and West.
   And let it come to mean one thing more.
   Thirty-four years ago, President Eisenhower met in Geneva with
Soviet leaders who, after the death of Stalin, promised a new
approach toward the West.
   He proposed a plan called ``Open Skies,'' which would allow
unarmed aircraft from the United States and the Soviet Union to fly
over the territory of the other country.
   This would open up military activities to regular scrutiny and,
as President Eisenhower put it, ``convince the world that we are
... lessening danger and relaxing tension.''
   President Eisenhower's suggestion tested Soviet readiness to
open their society.
   The Kremlin failed that test.
   Let us again explore that proposal, but on a broader, more
intrusive and radical basis _ one which I hope would include allies
on both sides.
   We suggest that those countries that wish to examine this
proposal meet soon to work out the necessary operational details,
separately from other arms control negotiations.
   Such surveillance flights, complementing satellites, would
provide regular scrutiny for both sides.
   Such unprecedented territorial access would show the world the
meaning of the concept of openness.
   The very Soviet willingness to embrace such a concept would
reveal their commitment to change.

   Where there is cooperation, there can be a broader economic
relationship.
   But economic relations have been stifled by Soviet internal
policies.
   They have been injured by Moscow's practice of using the cloak
of commerce to steal technology from the West.
   Ending discriminatory treatment of U.S. firms would be a helpful
step.
   Trade and financial transactions should take place on a normal
commercial basis.
   And should the Soviet Union codify its emigration laws in accord
with international standards and implement its new laws faithfully,
I am prepared to work with Congress for a temporary waiver of the
Jackson-Vanik Amendment, opening the way to extending Most Favored
Nation trade status to the Soviet Unon.
   The policy I have just described has everything to do with you.
   Today you graduate.
   You will start careers and families.
   And you will become the leaders of America in the next century.
   What kind of world will you know?
   Perhaps the world order of the future will truly be a family of
nations.
   It is a sad truth that nothing forces us to recognize our common
humanity more swiftly than a natural disaster.
   I am thinking of Soviet Armenia, just a few months ago _ a
tragedy without blame, warlike devastation without war.
   My son took our 12-year-old grandson to Yerevan.
   At the end of a day of comforting the injured and consoling the
bereaved, father and son sat down together amid the ruins and wept.
   How can our two countries magnify this simple expression of
caring?
   How can we each convey the goodwill of our people?
   Forty-three years ago, a young lieutenant by the name of Albert
Kotzebue, Class of 1945 at Texas A&amp;M, was the first American
soldier to shake hands with the Soviets at the banks of the Elbe
River.
   Once again, we are ready to extend our hand.
   Once again, we are ready for a hand in return.
   Once again, it is a time for peace.

   The space agency is juggling the
launch schedule for five space shuttle flights, including
postponement until 1990 of the Hubble Space Telescope mission long
awaited by scientists.
   The schedule changes, announced Friday, became necessary when
NASA decided last month that the shuttle Columbia could not be
readied in time for a July launch because of modifications that
must be made.
   Because of Columbia's lag, officials said they could not support
two missions in the July-August time period and still preserve an
October launch period for the high-priority Galileo flight to
Jupiter.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said in April
that it was moving the Columbia flight, a classified Defense
Department mission, to August, and was shifting a Discovery
military mission set for August until sometime after the Galileo
launch on Atlantis, which is set for Oct. 12.
   NASA announced this new sequence Friday for post-Galileo
missions:
   _Discovery on the military mission that had been scheduled in
August.
   _Columbia, to dispatch a communications satellite and retrieve a
science satellite orbiting since 1984. Officials want to recover
the 10.7-ton satellite before it can re-enter the atmosphere and
burn up late this year or in early 1990.
   _Atlantis on a Defense Department mission.
   _Discovery with the Hubble Space Telescope, which is to study
the universe far beyond the sun and its planets. Under a previous
schedule the telescope had been scheduled for launch in December.
The earliest now is February.
   _Columbia with the Astro-1 payload, a package of ultraviolet and
X-ray telescopes to observe deep space.
   NASA said it would announce dates for these flights within a few
weeks. It appears there will be three or four more launches this
year, with the others slated for 1990. Two missions have flown so
far in 1989.

   The American Association of Critical-Care Nurses
will honor the ABC-TV series ``China Beach'' for what it considers
the program's realistic depiction of Vietnam War nurses.
   Linda D. Searle, president of the nurses group, said ``China
Beach'' was chosen because of its sensitive portrayal of nurses in
an episode titled ``VETS,'' which cast actual Vietnam nurses.
   ``It is very encouraging to see a prime-time television show
communicate such intelligence and accuracy in their portrayal of
nurses without compromising the dramatic impact and entertainment
value of the show,'' she said Friday.
   Representatives from the show's cast and crew will accept the
award Monday during the AACN's 16th annual National Teaching
Institute in Atlanta.

   British rock star Sting brought his campaign to
save the Amazon rainforest to Toronto, urging Canadians to
contribute to the cause before the world ``enters a new dark age.''
   Accompanied by several Brazilian Indian leaders, Sting told
reporters Friday that the deforestation of Brazil by farmers,
miners, loggers and dam builders will rob the world of a major
oxygen source within 30 years.
   ``Then, we will be haunted by famine, drought, pestilence,
disease _ and haunted by our own self-inflicted ignorance,'' he
said.
   Sting's forecast of apocalypse was echoed by his Brazilian
companions, who said that their people are already experiencing
catastrophe and a forest preserve must be set up before it is too
late.
   Sting helped establish The Rainforest Foundation, which aims to
establish an Amazon conservation area the size of Great Britain. He
is on a 28-day publicity tour in which he will visit 14 countries.

   Actor David Carradine eluded high kicks and
strong forearms often as the half-Chinese priest in the television
show ``Kung Fu,'' but taking a blank pistol from his pants on a
movie set proved trouble.
   Carradine, 48, suffered a minor injury Friday when he
accidentally shot himself in the groin with a .45-caliber blank
pistol during the filming of the movie ``One For The Money.''
   Fire Department spokesman Mel Cosgrove said paramedics were
called to the scene after the incident at the Mobile docks, but the
actor's injury was superficial and he refused treatment.
   Carradine was removing the pistol from his pants when it fired,
officials said. Nobody on the film crew would discuss the incident,
and filming continued Friday afternoon.
   ``One For The Money'' is about one man's fight against
corruption in an era of privately controlled police. The director
is David Prior.

   ``Sesame Street'' has a new character, a baby
girl named Gabriela, thanks to help from the rarely cooperative
Oscar the Grouch.
   The birth of Luis' and Maria's child on Friday was eagerly
awaited. Muppet and human characters gathered around Maria's bed to
be introduced to the infant.
   ``Welcome to Sesame Street and the world!'' said Big Bird.
   But not everything went smoothly. When it was time to go to the
hospital for the delivery, Luis and Maria found that their car had
been towed. Oscar drove them to the hospital, occasioning much
hand-wringing on his part.
   ``I'm a grouch,'' he explained, and grouches are not supposed to
do nice things or be happy about events like the birth of a baby.
   The marriage of Maria and Luis was the finale for last season.
Sonia Manzano, who plays Maria, became a mother 13 months ago and
her real-life daughter will eventually play her television daughter.

   It's not exactly somewhere over the
rainbow, but this central New York village promises a resemblance
to the magical land of Oz.
   Organizers are expecting up to 20,000 people to travel today to
this community of 3,600 people, 15 miles east of Syracuse for its
annual Ozfest, which this year is celebrating the golden
anniversary of the movie, ``The Wizard of Oz.''
   It's the biggest day of the year for Chittenango, the birthplace
of Oz creator L. Frank Baum, said Ozfest Chairwoman Beverly
Brickner.
   The day will be marked by a parade and other entertainment,
people dressed up as characters from ``The Wizard of Oz,'' and an
appearance by the 73-year-old actor who played the Munchkinland
coroner, Meinhardt Raabe.
   The first celebration was in 1978. ``For seven or eight years
nobody here took it seriously, but now everybody realizes this is
all worthwhile,'' she said.
   The village now has visible signs of its Oz connections: a
yellow brick sidewalk in the business district; signs featuring Oz
characters on the edge of the village; and Oz-inspired business
names such as Aunt Em's Kitchen (which sells Oz cream), Emerald
City Bowling, Over the Rainbow Crafts and Tin Man Construction Co.
   Baum lived in Chittenango only a few years after his birth in
1856; his birthplace has burned down. Brickner would like officials
to put up a bronze plaque at the house and she has hopes of
building an Oz museum.
   ``I'd like to even see us build an Emerald City here,'' she said.

   Larry Gambino decided to give his home a name
after seeing many of his neighbors do the same. ``You have River
View this, and Mountain View, and Valley View,'' he said.
   Gambino looked out his window for an idea, and there it was.
   The name: ``Prison View Estate.''
   He said there was no use in ignoring the nearby 3,000-acre
Lorton Correctional Complex.
   Gambino, a postal worker, placed a decorative sign next to his
driveway and had Prison View Estate printed on his family checks.
   The name is so widely recognized that when he calls for a
delivery of heating oil, he doesn't have to give his name.
   ``I say I need a delivery at Prison View Estate, and the next
day it's there,'' said Gambino, 35.
   He hasn't had any problems with the prison, which is 20 miles
southwest of Washington, D.C., and run by the District of Columbia.
He said the prison keeps a neat lawn, and he doesn't worry about
escapees.
   ``They're good neighbors, as far as neighbors go,'' he said.

   A runaway freight train jumped its
tracks at 90 mph on a downhill grade and plowed into a row of
houses Friday, killing at least three people, two of them children.
   ``The train was all over the place. It looked like a toy in a
sandbox. It was just everywhere _ in people's yards. Pieces of the
axles were in people's yards,'' said witness Al Dorame.
   Late Friday evening, a 24-year-old man was found alive in the
wreckage of a home more than 14 hours after the accident, said
police Sgt. David Clark. He was found shortly before 9 p.m.
Tentatively identified as Chris Shaw, he had been asleep when the
69-car train derailed and plowed through his home.
   Earlier Friday, at least two people were reported missing and
firefighters and police combed the wreckage of the residential
neighborhood. Two specially trained dogs from the volunteer
California Rescue Dog Association were used to search the rubble of
the homes and the train.
   Southern Pacific said it would not begin moving the wrecked cars
until word was received that all homes had been searched.
   Hospitals reported treating at least eight people for varying
injuries, including the train's engineer Frank W. Holland, 34, a
14-year Southern Pacific employee who was pulled from the wreckage
by witnesses.
   Holland was listed in serious condition with broken ribs,
bruises and cuts, said Jo Coffey, a nursing supervisor at St.
Bernardine's Hospital.
   The Southern Pacific freight apparently lost its brakes toward
the top of treacherous, 4,190-foot Cajon Pass and came raging down
the grade at more than 90 mph before the derailment, said Southern
Pacific spokesman Doug Stephanson.
   It flew off an embankment and into a neighborhood of modest
two-and three-bedroom homes on the northwest outskirts of San
Bernardino, smashing houses and throwing out its load of sand-like
potash.
   Stephanson said one of the five crewmembers radioed to a
dispatcher in Los Angeles that the train was out of control.
   ``They said the speed was 90 mph a few miles up the track (from
the crash site),'' he said. ``They absolutely were out of control.
... It was a runaway train.''
   He said the train apparently lost its brakes near the top of the
pass in the mountains about 60 miles east of Los Angeles.
   The train had four engines in front and two ``helper engines''
in back, and had between 55 and 69 cars in all. The rear engines
had applied full brakes, Stephanson said.
   Police Sgt. Dan Hernandez said the train hit 11 homes. Six were
destroyed, one had major damage and four had minor damage inflicted
by the train, flying dirt and rocks from the roadbed and the
potash, a mineral used in making fertilizer and soap. Property
damage was estimated at $600,000.
   ``The engine came off the track and went through a house,'' said
Dane Maloney, who saw the crash on his way to work.
   ``It was terrible, there were train cars on top of houses, train
cars on top of cars. It sounded like a couple of bombs going off.''
   ``It was going down from Cajon real fast, didn't have no brakes.
I looked over, part of the train was in the air. It just fell back
on the ground and all the sand started flying up in the air and
stuff,'' said Kelly Michaels, a little boy who saw the wreck.
   The pass is the major road and rail conduit from the Los Angeles
basin to Las Vegas. Interstate 15 passes through it.
   The dead were identified as conductor Everett S. Crown, 36, a
member of the Bakersfield-based train crew and a Southern Pacific
worker since 1972, and stepbrothers Jason Thompson, 9, and Tyson
White, 7, whose home was smashed by the train.
   Another crew member, brakeman Alan R. Reiss, 44, who has been
with Southern Pacific since 1971, was still listed as missing, said
train master Terry Givens in Bakersfield.
   Southern Pacific spokesman Jim Loveland said the railroad will
help people left homeless by the crash. ``We feel terrible about
this,'' he said.
   Red Cross spokeswoman Kim Schwartz said a shelter had been set
up at the Inland Job Corps Center and 10 people had registered by
late afternoon.
   About 200 people were kept from their homes for a time for fear
that leaking diesel fuel could ignite, Garcia said. He said most of
the injuries were minor.
   Jim Kolstad, acting chairman of the National Transportation
Safety Board, was flying in from Washington, D.C., to direct the
investigation, said Gary Mucho, the regional director. He said
there was no indication of the cause.
   The train was carrying potash from the high-desert town of
Mojave to Long Beach, said Southern Pacific spokesman Jerry Pera.
   The tracks were expected to remain closed at least a day,
forcing detour of 15 freights and two passenger trains a day, Pera
said. The trains, including Amtrak's Los Angeles-to-New Orleans
service, would use a route through Saugus, he said.
   Elsewhere, a derailment near Meridian, Miss., spilled thousands
of gallons of antifreeze and diesel fuel into the Chunky River, and
residents were told Friday to keep away from the river.
   No injuries were reported in the Thursday night derailment of a
MidSouth Railroad train but more than 200 people were evacuated
from the area and told they may not be able to return home until
late Saturday or Sunday.
   Officials said those evacuated early Friday included 22
residents of a nursing home.
   ``We now estimate that 20,000 to 25,000 gallons of ethylene
glycol alcohol _ antifreeze _ got into the river along with 3,000
to 5,000 gallons of diesel fuel,'' said Eleana Turner, spokeswoman
for the Mississippi Bureau of Pollution Control.
   Twelve cars and three of the train's five engines left the
tracks, with two of the engines landing partly in the river.

   Cards honoring mom usually are stuck on
the refrigerator door about a week, but for a single mother of six
this Mother's Day will bring something more enduring _ a college
diploma.
   Anne Marie Liebhaber, whose children range in age from 3 to 17,
will receive a bachelor's degree in general studies, with an
emphasis on psychology and sociology, after completing her
undergraduate coursework at Gonzaga University with a 4.0 grade
point average.
   Federal grants and a tuition discount helped finance her
undergraduate studies. But for her next course of study, Ms.
Liebhaber was awarded a full merit scholarship. She'll attend the
Gonzaga law school come fall.
   She is one of a handful of law students selected as recipients
of Thomas More scholarships, based on outstanding promise for
intellectual achievement and community service.
   ``I'd like to go into public service, dealing with family and
domestic law as an advocate for women and children,'' Ms. Liebhaber
said.
   After an ``abusive'' marriage that ended in divorce, she
``stayed home and devoted my time and effort to raising my
children, because we were all wounded from the trauma of the
divorce.''
   ``For the first time I had to experience taking care of myself,
and it was quite difficult,'' Ms. Liebhaber said.
   She said she's never had a job outside the home, and makes ends
meet with child support and food stamps. Her ex-husband, who's in
the military, has paid regular child support, Ms. Liebhaber said,
and all her children except her youngest are covered under the
military's health care plan.
   The birth of her youngest child, Ben, provided the impetus for
her to enroll at Gonzaga two months later, and her struggle to get
child support influenced her decision to go on to law school, she
said.
   ``My youngest was my gift; he brought love and life back into
this family,'' Ms. Liebhaber said.
   She said her other children were ``surprised, but they were very
accepting, and Ben is very loved.''
   Raised in Chicago, Ms. Liebhaber attended the University of
Illinois for two years before she was married, and the credits she
earned were accepted at Gonzaga.
   The private, Jesuit-run university's general studies program is
designed to allow more flexibility in scheduling and curriculum
content for adult students.
   ``I enrolled in Gonzaga two years ago directly as a result of
their non-traditional program, which would allow me to raise my
children and achieve a quality education,'' she said.
   ``She's a hero,'' said her academic adviser, Jerry Cook, dean of
the college of professional studies. ``She's come from a difficult
personal situation, achieved a perfect academic record, and she's
headed for law school.
   ``It shows what a mature woman can do when she puts her mind to
it.''
   Ms. Liebhaber said her situation _ receiving regular child
support and health care for her children _ was atypical of many
single mothers who return to college.
   She didn't have to hold down a job while attending classes, and
her daughter, now 14, took care of her infant son and her other
four sons did their own laundry and helped with housework.
   ``I don't think my case is that extraordinary ... What I'm doing
is what millions of women do without any kind of fanfare or
acknowledgment,'' she said. ``Fortunately for me, I've been given a
good intellect so that I can succeed in school.''
   Although Ms. Liebhaber was apprehensive about having her
accomplishments publicized, she hopes her story inspires other
women.
   ``It's been a remarkable experience,'' she said. ``But I have a
lot yet to do with my life. I'm only 38.''

   A Montana sheriff rode a helicopter over
snowbound peaks of the Bitterroot Mountains to capture a California
man who allegedly confessed to killing his wife in a chilling
letter to a newspaper.
   Mineral County Sheriff Wade Van Gilder and a member of his
volunteer posse were waiting on the west side of Hoodoo Pass when
David Schoenecker, 48, of Anaheim, Calif., wandered across the
Montana border into Idaho.
   Schoenecker was cold but in good physical condition, despite
four days in which he apparently wandered the mountain range of
7,000-foot peaks still locked in winter snow with freezing
nighttime temperatures.
   The man abandoned his car Tuesday on a mountain road near
Superior, Mont., on the state's western border.
   That was a day after he allegedly mailed a letter from a
Missoula, Mont., motel to Orange County Register columnist Bob
Emmers.
   ``Last Friday night I shot and killed my wife,'' began the
five-page letter, received Thursday. ``There was no hatred _ I
loved her _ but the action was necessary because I have a purpose
and one that cannot have an interruption or interference.''
   Anaheim police Sgt. Chet Barry said Friday that police had
confirmed that the body they found Thursday afternoon in the
Schoenecker's Anaheim home was that of Mrs. Schoenecker, an
elementary school teacher.
   The letter said Schoenecker killed his wife because she didn't
understand the premonitions and ``images'' he had about people who
had ``done wrong or evil'' against him.
   ``Several times I tried to explain these `happenings' to Gail
(my wife) but she dismissed them. I was never understood. I knew
that as these feelings and `pictures' continued to occur and repeat
that I had to prepare a way, develop a plan, make arrangements. And
I have done so.
   ``Now, I had to eliminate my wife. She wouldn't believe me. She
wouldn't even listen. So in order to keep her from finding out, I
developed a separate plan or storyline that totally misled her, but
it did make her happy. She was very happy on Friday.''
   The letter suggested Schoenecker might try to kill other people.
   ``I've left a list _ a partial list. Not everyone on the list
will receive total punishment _ but they will be punished,'' the
letter said.
   Police searched the couple's home and found a list of 54 people,
the majority from the Milwaukee area.
   Van Gilder said his officers had been tracking Schoenecker, a
chemical engineer, since Thursday, when Anaheim police reported
finding his wife's body. A snowmobiler's tip on Friday provided the
final lead.
   ``Deputy Dan Foley and I went to the snowline in a patrol car,''
Van Gilder said. ``I radioed for the helicopter. ... I asked the
pilot to fly the road and see how far this individual was ahead of
us.''
   The helicopter then returned and took Van Gilder and a member of
his posse into Idaho, dropping them about a mile from the border on
the route Schoenecker was following.
   ``We waited for him and let him get within 20 or 30 feet,'' Van
Gilder said.
   Schoenecker was carrying a .357-caliber Magnum revolver, but did
not resist when confronted, the sheriff said. He was being held in
the Mineral County jail on a California warrant pending the arrival
of Anaheim police.

<TEXT>
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos urged
students to join his campaign for education reform by appearing in
person at a small Indian high school and, by satellite, at remote
schools across the West.
   ``I came here to learn. You can help teach me,'' he told the 30
students and dozen teachers and administrators at Pyramid Lake High
School on Friday.
   ``We have serious problems in the United States in terms of
education. If we work together, perhaps we can correct some of the
mistakes we have made in the past.''
   Cavazos joined four students to view and participate in a
sociology class beamed by satellite to the remote Paiute Indian
reservation school through the ``Star Schools'' program, which
offers advanced courses to classrooms in rural or isolated areas.
Nixon is 48 miles northeast of Reno along the shores of Pyramid
Lake.
   The satellite classes originate in San Antonio, Texas, and are
sent out over the TI-IN United Star Network. Students can ask their
TV teacher questions by telephone. Besides sociology, the network
offers such courses as advanced math, science and foreign languages.
   As the class' featured guest, the education secretary fielded
questions from students in Texas and Oregon.
   Sociology teacher Pat Riley opened the door to one of Cavazos'
favorite topics when she asked how his upbringing led him to the
cabinet.
   ``I started to school in a two-room schoolhouse on a ranch in
Texas,'' he said. ``My father always told me, `Education is the
most valuable thing you can have and nobody can take it away from
you.'''
   Cavazos said one of his goals is to convince parents that
learning begins at home, long before their youngsters are in
school. ``Education begins with the parents,'' he told Mrs. Riley.
   The secretary told the students he is concerned that 27 million
people in the United States remain illiterate and that 28 percent
of the nation's students drop out.
   Although budget deficits occupy much of the time on Capitol
Hill, ``until you solve the education deficit, you won't overcome
the other deficits,'' he said.
   ``We made a commitment that we'd go to the moon. We went to the
moon,'' he told the students. ``Our national commitment to
education must start right here in this room.''
   It was Cavazos' first experience with the ``Star Schools''
program since becoming education secretary Sept. 30. His department
financed the four regional partnerships in the program with a $19
million grant in October.
   ``I welcome the opportunity to meet and share some thoughts with
you,'' he told the students. ``Your questions show an interest in
education and a commitment to education.''
   Monika New Moon, a junior at the Nixon school, said the
satellite program allowed her to take courses her small school
couldn't provide.
   ``They're pretty limited in the classes they have to offer. It's
just the basics,'' she said.
   Cavazos met privately with school officials, tribal Chairman Joe
Ely and Eugene Paslov, state superintendent of public instruction,
before continuing his 11-day tour of schools across the country.
   ``We're here to learn about what's out there and what the issues
are,'' he said at a news conference at the school. ``I read the
data, but that can't tell me all I need to know. We have some
deficits in education, but we also have some strengths. We need to
work on those strengths and correct those deficits.''

copied Soviet models to produce drearily grand buildings with high
ceilings, huge chandeliers and stuffy halls.
   Western artistic influences now far exceed the Soviet
influences, and new buildings are modeled on Western highrises. But
the Soviet political stamp remains inbred in the structure of
China's government and Communist Party.
   ``You call a ministry in China and can never find the right
person. When you do find him, he can't make a decision'' _ just
like in the Soviet Union, complained a former Chinese diplomat to
Moscow who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   It's more than just shared inefficiency. China copied the
structure of Josef Stalin's government and Communist Party
``wholesale,'' said Zhu Ruizhen, a Soviet scholar at the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences.
   As in the Soviet Union, authority was tightly centralized, with
orders flowing down from a handful of men at the top.
   The party became a bureaucracy within a bureaucracy, stationing
officials in every government office with final say over decisions.
A weak legislature and oversized Cabinet posed little threat to the
party's power.
   Very little of this system has changed in China since its split
nearly three decades ago from Moscow. Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev, who visits Beijing next week in a bid to smooth the
breach, has done far more than Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping to
shake off the Stalinist political model.
   China's Cabinet still is unwieldy with 41 ministers, and
although the legislature has become more active in drafting
legislation in recent years, it cannot formulate policy.
   Deng has taken major steps away from Stalin's economic model,
allowing market forces to set some prices. But large sectors of the
economy remain centrally planned, with raw materials allocated by
the center. China still announces five-year economic plans, like
the Soviets.
   ``Generally speaking, we should cast off most of this,'' said
Xing Shugang, also a Soviet expert at the Academy of Social
Sciences. The Soviet system, he said, lacked a democratic
foundation and in applying Lenin's principle of ``democratic
centralism,'' too much emphasis was put on the centralism.
   ``Democratic centralism should mean that the minority submits to
the majority,'' Xing said. ``If three of you take a position and I
disagree, I should submit to you, but you should not gag me.''
   In the arts, Xing recalled, Soviet influence was powerful during
the 1950's alliance years.
   ``Many Soviet novels were translated into Chinese ... but few
Western novels,'' he said. The Soviet novels were filled with
``iron-man'' heros who threw themselves into production for the
motherland.
   ``The Soviets never wrote about love, only about revolution,''
said Xing. A generation of Chinese authors copied the example.
   As a result, over the decades since the revolution China
produced ``some good works of literature, but none that are
outstanding,'' Xing said.
   Gorbachev's policy of glasnost has dramatically relaxed the
controls on Soviet writers and led to a flurry of new literary
activity. But Xing said this shouldn't be copied blindly from the
Soviets.
   ``The Soviet model is not good enough for China to study,'' he
said. ``China should do better than the Soviet Union _ it should
study some things from the West.''

<HEAD>Anti-Arab Anger Sparked by Disappearance of Soldier</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ASHKELON, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anti-Arab anger has exploded in southern
Israel over the slaying of an Israeli army sergeant and the
disappearance of a second soldier, both blamed on Palestinians.
   In Ashkelon, just north of the occupied Gaza Strip, hundreds of
Israelis took to the streets last week, screaming ``Death to the
Arabs!'' and stoning Arab-owned cars.
   In nearby Ashdod, residents beat an Israeli shopkeeper who
employs Arabs and fractured the skull of a Palestinian motorist
with a rock as he was waiting at a traffic light.
   ``The Arabs should be locked inside the Gaza Strip so they can
destroy each other. The time has come to punish them severely,''
said Ruth, a 23-year-old Ashkelon secretary and neighbor of the
missing soldier, Ilan Saadon. She would not give her last name.
   Outbreaks of anti-Arab emotion often follow Palestinian attacks
on Israelis. But the anger in recent days has escalated beyond the
norm, apparently compounded by rising frustration over Israel's
inability to stop the 17-month Palestinian uprising.
   Hardline politicians, sensing the grumbling across the country,
have stepped up their rhetoric and called for tougher measures to
quell the rebellion against Israeli rule.
   Speaking after the fatal stabbing of two elderly Israelis in
Jerusalem on May 3, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir called on the
Israeli public to deal with terrorists.
   ``If the murderers succeed, they should not be allowed to escape
in one piece,'' said Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud bloc.
   His aides later denied he was urging vigilante justice.
   Transport Minister Moshe Katsav of Likud demanded the government
seal off the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip for three months,
starting in July, to crush the uprising.
   The proposal, expected to be discussed soon by the Cabinet,
would bar Palestinians from entering Israel and journalists from
covering the occupied lands.
   ``Their (the Palestinians) free movement in sovereign Israel has
become dangerous,'' Katsav said.
   During a three-month closure, he said, efforts would be made to
replace the 110,000 Palestinians from the occupied lands who now
work in Israel, most in menial jobs such as construction,
agriculture and santitation.
   Palestinian employment is already down.
   According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, Palestinians put
in about 25 percent fewer working hours each week than before the
uprising in 1987.
   The drop is attributed both to army-imposed curfews in the
occupied areas and to Palestinian general strikes called to protest
Israeli occupation.
   In Ashdod, a Mediterranean city of 80,000 and hometown of slain
soldier Avi Sassportaz, officials are focusing their anger on Arab
employment, trying to phase out most of the 1,250 Arab workers.
   High school students, for example, were mobilized to clean
streets during the Independence Day holiday when the Gaza Strip was
under curfew.
   Mayor Zvi Zilker of Likud wants to raise manual labor wages by
25 percent to make the jobs more attractive to Israelis and has
suggested offering army veterans a one-year university scholarship
in exchange for one year of manual labor. The city council will
vote on the ideas Sunday.
   The proposals were sparked by the May 7 discovery of Sassportaz'
body in a grave 15 miles south of Ashdod. Authorities said
Sassportaz was shot to death by Palestinians who gave a ride to the
hitchhiking soldier Feb. 16.
   The discovery unleashed several days of anti-Arab rioting in the
city, and city officials decided to escort Arab workers to the Gaza
Strip to prevent them from being attacked.
   During a visit to Ashkelon on Friday, anti-Arab sentiments still
ran high in Saadon's Shimson neighborhood, a run-down housing
project populated mostly by immigrants from Morocco and the Soviet
Union.
   ``The Arabs are walking around freely, and nobody is stopping
them. They should not be allowed to enter Israel,'' said Pinchas
Elka, 18, a neighbor and former classmate of Saadon, who was last
seen May 3 hitchhiking in southern Israel.
   Ruth said that since Saadon's disappearance, she has wanted to
avoid all contacts with Arabs. ``At work, we have Arabs who clean.
I can't look them in the eye. I hate them. They pretend they are
innocent. But they hate us, too,'' she said.
   Ashkelon Mayor Eli Dayan of the left-leaning Labor Party
downplayed the anti-Arab outbursts, saying they were incited by a
few extremists.
   However, he said in an interview that if attacks on Israelis
continue, authorities might no longer be able to contain the anger
in the city of 60,000.

<HEAD>U.S. Appeals Court Upholds Random Drug Testing of Boston Police</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court ruling that the Boston
Police Department can conduct random drug testing of all officers
raises ``memories of George Orwell,'' a lawyer for the patrolmen's
union said.
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday upheld a
department regulation issued in April 1986 requiring random drug
testing of all department employees.
   ``I am deeply concerned for the health and safety of our police
officers,'' Boston Police Commissioner Francis M. Roache said after
the decision. ``They are human and engaged in perhaps the most
stressful profession in our society. Therefore I believe that this
drug testing policy is beneficial to the public as well as to the
police officers in this city and in the country.''
   Robert E. Guiney, the president of the Boston Patrolmen's
Association who sued the department in October 1986 to stop the
testing plan, criticized the ruling.
   ``It's an invasion of the body and an illegal seizure of body
fluids without cause,'' Guiney said. ``We've always taken the
position that there's no room in police work for anyone taking
drugs, but we feel that police officers have the rights of every
other citizen.''
   Boston's 1,600-member patrolmen's union immediately vowed to
appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. Both parties have
agreed testing won't be imposed until all appeals are exhausted.
   The two-page decision cited two U.S. Supreme Court rulings in
March that upheld the government's right to require drug and
alcohol tests for U.S. Customs workers involved in drug
interdiction and for railroad workers involved in accidents.
   Those verdicts said public safety outweighs constitutional
guarantees against unreasonable searches.
   In response to Guiney's suit, U.S. District Judge Robert E.
Keeton upheld in May 1988 the department's right to test officers
suspected of drug abuse. But Keeton ruled that imposing random
tests without suspicion was unconstitutional and an unreasonable
search.
   ``These rules conjure up memories of George Orwell,'' said Frank
McGee, chief counsel for the Boston Patrolmen's Association. He
said no other major police departments in the country have random
testing of all employees.
   ``There are very major implications here,'' McGee said. ``The
broader question is how far can the government go in searching the
bodies of its employees? Are blood tests and mandatory psychiatric
tests next?''
   Lawsuits filed by police unions also are pending against
proposed drug testing in the Detroit and Chattanooga, Tenn., police
departments.
   In March, the Nassau County Police Department in New York began
random drug testing of certain narcotics squads. In New York City,
random testing for drugs was started last October among the
estimated 1,000 officers assigned to the Organized Crime Control
Bureau.
   The Maryland State Police began a random mandatory testing
program for all its members in 1986 but suspended the program after
eight months when the state attorney general advised it may be
unconstitutional.

   Singer Ricky Skaggs performed a medley
of Keith Whitley's favorite tunes in an emotional eulogy for the
performer, who died of an alcohol overdose at age 33.
   Skaggs fought back tears before more than 500 mourners who
packed St. Joseph Church on Friday to pay their last respects to
Whitley.
   Whitley, who had three No. 1 records in the past eight months,
died Tuesday. An autopsy showed his body contained a blood alcohol
level of 0.47. An 0.30 level is considered lethal. Traces of
cocaine and a tranquilizer also were found in the body.
   ``If any of you have a drinking problem or a drug problem or an
emotional problem, please go get help,'' Skaggs implored the
mourners. ``There's one person who can help: Jesus. Keith would say
the same thing.
   ``I've lost so many friends,'' Skaggs added as he looked down on
the closed casket.
   Skaggs sang a 10-minute medley of Whitley's favorite gospel and
bluegrass songs, including ``White Dove,'' ``The Fields Have Turned
Brown'' and ``Drifting Too Far From the Shore.''
   Among those at the 50-minute service were Duane Allen of the Oak
Ridge Boys, country music performers John Hartford, Paul Overstreet
and David Frizzell and Grand Ole Opry stars Jack Greene, Billy
Walker and Vic Willis.
   The body was carried in a white hearse to nearby Spring Hill
Cemetery. Three stretch limousines transported Whitley's closest
relatives and friends.
   Whitley, a native of Sandy Hook, Ky., had recorded for RCA
Records for the past three years after spending several years in
bluegrass music. His No. 1 hits included ``I'm No Stranger to the
Rain,'' ``Don't Close Your Eyes'' and ``When You Say Nothing at
All.''
   His widow, Lorrie Morgan, is a regular performer on the Grand
Ole Opry.

<TEXT>
   Joe Valdez Caballero, who helped adapt Mexican
food to American taste buds by creating a crisp taco shell and
smothering his enchiladas in sour cream, has died at age 81.
   Caballero, considered a pioneer of Tex-Mex cuisine, died Friday,
his family said.
   During a 37-year career at El Chico Restaurant in Dallas,
Caballero was apparently the first restaurateur to put sour cream
on chicken enchiladas, and thought up the idea of the hard taco
shell, said Fred Cavazos, who worked many years with Caballero.
   Cavazos said Caballero also perfected a praline recipe that kept
the candy from turning too sugary and developed recipes for chili,
meat taco filling and rice sauces that are standards of the Tex-Mex
food business.
   ``He was an extraordinary individual who is very much a part of
the history of Mexican food in our part of the world, and his loss
will be felt dearly,'' said John Cuellar, president of El Chico
Corp.
   Caballero helped the chain open more than 100 restaurants in 12
states, Cuellar said.
   He wrote several cookbooks, including ``The Art of Mexican
Cuisine,'' which provides recipes for institutional-sized kitchens.
   Caballero was born in Temple, Texas, where his father owned and
operated a chili parlor. The family moved to Dallas when Caballero
was 7.
   Services were scheduled for Monday.

   Children from each city school district were
among the 4,000 people who attended a memorial service for the head
of the nation's largest school system.
   Schools Chancellor Richard Green, who died after an asthma
attack Wednesday at 52, was remembered Friday as a man whose vision
reached into the classrooms and the hearts of the youths he led.
   ``If I could see beyond the shadows, he would be there,
surrounded by children _ laughing, talking, listening,'' said
Shauna Lewis, one of several student speakers at the Cathedral of
St. John the Divine.
   ``Today really belongs to the children of New York,'' said the
Rev. James Parks Morton, dean of the Episcopal cathedral, who
officiated along with the Bishop Paul Moore Jr.
   The 32 community school districts and five high school districts
each sent a delegation of five students.
   Green wasted no time after arriving in March 1988 from
Minneapolis to head New York City's school system, said Mayor
Edward I. Koch.
   At his first news conference, he instructed the
spotlight-stealing mayor to sit down while he talked.
   ``And I sat down,'' said Koch. ``I don't do that for everyone.
Clearly, he was in charge.''
   Green was to be buried today after a second service in
Minneapolis.

   Newly-arrived American
soldiers went into defensive positions today around U.S.
installations near the Panama Canal.
   Nearly 1,900 soldiers from Marine and Army units, ordered in by
President Bush following the aborting of Sunday's elections and the
beating of opposition candidates, are expected this weekend to join
the 10,000 U.S. troops already stationed at American bases.
   Fifty Marines from the 2nd Light Armored Infantry Company at
Camp Lejeune, N.C., were the first to land Friday afternoon at
Howard, on the outskirts of Panama City.
   They were followed by planeloads of Army soldiers from the 7th
Infantry Division, and the U.S. Army 5th Infantry Division from
Fort Polk, La.
   ``Most of them will be living in tents,'' a Southern Command
spokesman said.
   Tight security surrounded the landing area. Journalists were
kept about 200 yards from the planes, except for a few taken closer
under military escort.
   ``Walk in a group, don't try to break away or you will find out
what kind of security we have,'' the escort told reporters.
   No interviews were allowed, but some soldiers spoke to
journalists and waved. ``Glad to be here,'' a sergeant said as he
went by. ``It was a rough flight.''
   The C-141 Starlifter and C-5 Galaxy jets started landing at
Howard on a typical humid, sunny Panamanian afternoon.
   The Marines came through a side door while their ammunition and
other equipment rolled off the rear doors in large boxes.
   Friday's arrivals moved immediately into field positions at the
perimiter of Howard Air Force Base and other U.S. military
installations.
   ``We are here at the decision of the president to provide
support for the Southern Command,'' said Col. David Hale, a brigade
commander in the 7th Light Infantry Division at Fort Ord, Calif., a
contingent commander.
   There was no official reaction Friday from Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, whom the U. S. government and international obervers
accused of annulling Sunday's election to keep the opposition from
assuming power.
   Noriega is commander of the 15,000-strong Panamanian Defense
Forces and the country's de facto ruler.

   An Air Force F-4 fighter crashed in
rugged terrain during a U.S. Army Air Defense test, killing one of
the two crew members, officials at George Air Force Base said.
   Both crew members ejected from the aircraft before it crashed
Friday, but one crewman's parachute apparently failed to open, said
Monterey County sheriff's deputies who were at the scene.
   The victim's identity was withheld pending notification of
relatives, said Sgt. Richard Corral, a spokesman at the base. He
also declined to identify the survivor, who suffered only minor
injuries.
   A board of Air Force officers is investigating the crash, Corral
said.
   Military officials refused to release any details of the crash.
A radio station in San Luis Obispo reported the plane was based at
George Air Force Base, but said the fatal flight originated at
Lemoore Naval Air Station near Fresno.
   ``The Air Force, Navy and Army all use that area out there for
practice runs, free flights,'' said Warren Field, a spokesman for
the California Department of Forestry.
   Field said his department received an emergency call indicating
the crash happened about 12:20 p.m. The crash ignited a 15-acre
brush fire, but the blaze was extinguished shortly afterward, he
said.
   The plane went down some 27 miles southeast of King City outside
the Hunter Liggett Military Reservation, Field said.

   A Radcliffe undergraduate has charged
that a Harvard law student forced her to participate in
pornographic videos and raped her, but a lawyer for the accused
said the woman was a consenting partner.
   The second-year law student who is president of the 25-member
Society for Black Professional Entrepreneurs also is accused of
using that group for sex, forcing some members to undress in front
of cameras.
   Thomas Samoluk, spokesman for the Middlesex County district
attorney's office, said Friday that investigators had been in touch
with the alleged victim and were looking into the matter.
   Jill Richburg, 24, also a student at Harvard Law School and
member of the entrepreneurs society, said she was angered by the
depiction of the group as a ``sex ring.'' Richburg said she knew of
no one who was coerced into videotaped sexual activities.
   Harvard spokesman Peter Costa said internal hearings by the
Harvard Law School Administrative Board began Friday.
   The board takes testimony, collects evidence and can recommend
disciplinary measures, Costa said, but he wouldn't specify what
action might be taken against the student.
   The male student's lawyer, Martin Gideonse of Cambridge,
described the incident as the unfortunate outcome of a broken
relationship. He said his client was ``devastated'' by publicity
over the alleged incident.
   He said his client and the woman were involved from April 1988
until last fall and described the tapes as the result of ``private,
consensual activity.''
   ``The notion that there's a ring of some sort is garbage,'' said
Gideonse. ``It's not a lurid, widespread kind of thing. People do
things in the privacy of their own home and at some point somebody
changes their mind.''
   Gideonse said that in addition to his client and the female
student, there was only one other participant in the tapes, a male
Harvard Divinity School student who recently appeared on the Phil
Donahue talk show as part of a panel of ``professional virgins.''
   ``There was no rape and there was no extortion,'' Gideonse said.
   Harvard officials began investigating after the Radcliffe
student filed a report last December with campus police accusing
the law student of rape when she demanded that he erase videotapes
showing her and others involved in sexual acts, Gideonse said.
   The woman said she went to the law student's apartment Dec. 11
to persuade him to erase the videotapes. She claimed he reacted by
raping her, and demanded money or sexual favors in return for
destroying the tapes, officials said.

   Park rangers and volunteers searched the
summit of Mount Rainier for a missing climber whose partner was
found dead just below the 14,410-foot summit.
   Four search parties totaling 21 people were spending the night
on the mountain after having been flown in by helicopter, said Cy
Hentges, a Mount Rainier National Park ranger.
   Hentges identified the dead man as Richard Mooney, 33, of South
Lake Tahoe, Calif., who was one four people climbing the mountain
together.
   Peter Derdowski, 26, of Tahoe, Nev., was missing, he said.
   If Derdowski cannot be found today, Hentges said, ``I would say
it looks pretty grim.''
   Their companions, Larry Duin, 26, and Steve Newell, 27, both of
South Lake Tahoe, descended from the peak and notified authorities
Thursday.
   Mooney's body was found by Duin and Newell as they headed upward
about 400 feet below Liberty Cap, one of three summits around the
crater of the dormant volcano, Hentges said. The body was flown off
the mountain Friday, he said.
   The two survivors searched the summit area and the eastern side
of the peak for the missing man before descending to the Ipsut
Creek campground to report the death.
   Mooney had taken off his parka and tied it to his skis and
probably died of hypothermia. The parka was still tied to the skis
when he was found.
   Derdowski apparently climbed toward the summit, thinking the
other two climbers were ahead.
   ``He left his pack behind with the body,'' Hentges said.
   ``We don't know what he took out of it,'' the ranger added. ``He
didn't have a lot with him besides the clothes on his back.''
   The four climbers, all of whom had skis for the descent down
snow-covered glaciers, started their climb Sunday, Hentges said.
   ``It (the search) looks less fruitful as we continue, but you
never know,'' he said. ``He (Derdowski) was a strong climber.''

<TEXT>
   Exxon and the Coast Guard planned more
than a dozen flights over the site of the nation's worst oil spill
to chart routes for fishing boats and ensure a clean start to the
halibut season.
   The company and government officials also planned to test
oil-thinning chemicals on crude-caked beaches. Some
environmentalists criticized the move, but officials said it was
necessary because seven weeks of washing and scrubbing by thousands
of cleanup workers had proven ineffective.
   Authorities also reported that a Soviet skimmer ship that Exxon
dropped from the cleanup effort earlier this week had been rehired
for standby duty near the entrance of Prince William Sound.
   Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins, the Coast Guard's senior officer in the
spill zone, ordered eight flights Saturday and eight more on Sunday
over fishing grounds in and around the sound. The fishing industry
had sought the flights as a means of allaying consumers' concerns
of oil-tainted halibut.
   The halibut season begins Monday, and the area's annual harvest
has been estimated at $85 million.
   Since the Exxon Valdez ran aground on March 24 and spilled
almost 11 million gallons of crude, the herring season has been
cancelled in the sound.
   Robbins also ordered test-sprays of chemical dispersants on the
beaches of Ingot Island in the sound on Monday. The chemicals are
designed to thin the hardened oil.
   ``It creates more of a hazard than it's worth,'' said Cindy
Lowry, a spokeswoman for the environmental group Greenpeace.
``Right now, it seems a pretty risky thing to try. There are so
many important pupping areas for harbor seals. This is not the
right time to do it.''
   Earlier testing of dispersants proved inconclusive shortly after
the spill.
   In releasing the Soviet ship Vaidogubsky earlier this week,
Exxon had blamed hardened oil for jamming the skimmer's pumps and
rendering it ineffective.
   Nevertheless, Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. hired the 11,400-ton
vessel under a $15,000-a-day contract through the end of May,
executives for the company that operates the trans-Alaska pipeline
said.
   Alyeska hired the craft for ``standby backup'' at the entrance
to Prince William Sound, said spokesman Tom Brennan. He said the
vessel ``would provide extra protection'' in case of another spill.
   Meanwhile, Gov. Steve Cowper signed legislation to create a
state commission to investigate the Exxon Valdez spill and to
impose tougher spill fines. The law would increase fines for spills
caused by gross negligence to as much as $50 a gallon or a maximum
of $500 million from $10 a gallon or $100 million.
   Cowper also signed a bill that imposes stricter liability laws
on companies responsible for oil and hazardous material spills.
   The ``spill bills'' were the first to become law since the Exxon
Valdez ran aground.
   The National Transportation Safety Board has hearings scheduled
next week in Anchorage to investigate the cause of the accident.
The fired skipper of the tanker, Joseph Hazelwood, 42, of
Huntington, N.Y., faces trial June 20 in Valdez on charges that
include operating the vessel while intoxicated.
   An executive at Exxon Shipping Co. said Hazelwood may have felt
pressure from Alyeska and Exxon to sail late at night on March 23
despite the presence of icebergs in Prince William Sound, according
to a report in The Boston Globe. ``If Joe hadn't pulled out of
Valdez at 10, after he finished loading at 8, Alyeska would have
been on the phone to the West Coast office,'' said the manager,
whom the newspaper didn't identify. ``In a few minutes, the ship's
satellite phone would have rung, telling Joe to get his ship out of
there. He'd have to come up with a real good reason to stay.
   The Globe said Exxon spokesmen refused to comment on the report.

<HEAD>Crowd Rampages Through Second City in Turkmenia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 250 protesters with economic and ethnic
demands rampaged through streets of a city near the Iranian border,
setting fire to shops and pelting police with stones, a newspaper
reported.
   The May 9 riot in Nebit-Dag, a western city in the republic of
Turkmenia, followed a rampage in the republic's capital Ashkabad on
May 1 in which more than 100 young people were arrested.
   The newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda said in a report Friday that
about 50 people had been arrested in Nebit-Dag, and that two
policemen had been injured by the crowd.
   The crowd overwhelmed the city's small police force, which had
to call in reinforcements, said N.S. Radzhabov, head of the local
Interior Ministry office.
   ``All of two weeks ago you could boldly say about Turkmenia that
it was one of the quietest regions of our country,'' the newspaper
said. The Soviet Union has been hit by unrest in many of its 15
republics, homelands for some of its more than 100 ethnic groups.
   But Radzhabov told the paper that a crowd of mostly Turkmen aged
16-40 gathered in the center of Nebit-Dag, and rebuffed police who
tried to talk to them.
   ``We tried to quiet the people, but they started throwing
stones,'' he said. ``The crowd split into two, each of which moved
down streets of the city, demolishing and setting fire to
cooperative cafes and stalls.''
   The paper said that like the crowd in Ashkabad, they expressed
anger at cooperatives, the small private businesses that President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev has fostered to fill gaps in goods and
services provided by the state economy.
   But the crowd in the Nebit-Dag also turned some of its wrath on
Armenians, the paper said.
   Armenians are involved in a bitter dispute with Azerbaijanis
over control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Armenians are
traditionally Christian. Azerbaijan, and Turkmenia, both bordering
Iran, are on opposite sides of the Caspian Sea and are
traditionally Moslem.
   Many Soviets are suspicious that cooperatives are interested
only in quick profits and are havens for organized crime. Pravda,
the Communist Party daily, said May 3 that the Ashkabad crowd was
angered by high prices of cooperatives, and the low quality of
goods and services.
   Radzhabov said their main complaint was about cooperatives, and
that the crowd ``shouted slogans directed at people of Armenian
nationality.''
   The paper said that unhappiness with traders at Turkmenia's
markets might be the fault of local merchants who buy up goods from
Tadzhiks, Uzbeks, Armenians and others as soon as they arrive in
Turkmenia.

<HEAD>Government Tests U.S. Tankers for Tainted Fuel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is testing U.S. oil tankers at
border entry points for solvents, PCBs, waste oil and other
impurities used by traffickers to dilute shipments and boost
profits, officials and news reports said.
   Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard announced Friday that as
part of a plan to stem the alleged tide of contaminated fuel
shipped from the United States, only 50 of the 175 border crossings
will be open to oil tankers.
   Bouchard said the change will allow closer inspection of
imported fuels to ensure they are not tainted with PCBs or other
chemicals that can produce cancer-causing furans and dioxins when
burned.
   The minister said inspection teams have begun taking samples
from tanker trucks at major U.S.-Canada border crossings and that
no contaminants have been found in 12 samples analyzed so far.
   An Environment Canada official said consumers would not have to
stop driving their cars or turn off their furnaces because of fears
of tainted fuel. Bill Milliken said if the toxic wastes and
solvents were mixed with fuel, the levels would not be high enough
to have a health impact.
   PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, were used mainly as a
coolant in electrical transformers but have been banned in North
America because of health concerns.
   The political opposition however continued to insist the border
action by the Conservative government would do little good.
   Jim Conrad, executive vice-president of the Petroleum Marketers
Association, estimated the testing and closing of border crossings
to the shipments will cost Canadian consumers up to $500 million a
year.
   The Globe and Mail newspaper reported Monday that the solvents
were mixed secretly into fuels the past four years, sold to
customers in western New York, and taken across the border for sale
in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec.
   The report in the Globe and Mail quoted unidentifed law
enforcement sources and participants in what it said was lucrative
trafficking.
   It said the shipments of altered gasoline, diesel and industrial
heating fuel originated in New York state.
   The Globe and Mail reported Friday at least 2.6 million gallons
of toxic solvents were shipped to Texas from Sarnia, Ontario, and
blended into gasoline over a two-year period. Some of the tainted
gasoline came back to Sarnia and was sold in Ontario and Quebec.
   Bouchard also announced that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
will lead a task force investigating the report that millions of
gallons of imported fuel were contaminated by the toxic wastes.
   U.S. governors from the Great Lakes state visiting Canada on
Thursday and Friday were asked repeatedly at their public
appearances about the report.
   Michigan Gov. James Blanchard said the news was to be taken
seriously, but ``it's something that's basically news to us.''
   The governors said state environmental officials would discuss
the issue at a summer meeting.

<HEAD>Connecticut Governor's Office Hit With Fax Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Businessmen opposed to a bill banning
unsolicited facsimile advertising thought it natural to lobby the
governor by fax, but they may have sent the wrong message by
jamming his machine for hours.
   ``You could not have done a better job of bringing home the
problem adressed in the bill that you oppose,'' Charles Monagan, an
aide to Gov. William O'Neill, wrote Thursday in a letter to the
National Fax Users Committee.
   The committee opposes a bill awaiting O'Neill's signature that
would prohibit them from marketing their products by facsimile
machine without first obtaining the permission of the recipient.
Violators would face a $200 fine.
   In a campaign apparently organized by the committee, dozens of
Connecticut businesses sent O'Neill's office a form letter _ by fax
_ arguing against the fax ban beginning Thursday. The letter argued
it would cost the average company $6,000 a year to obtain
permission before sending facsimile messages.
   The stream of messages was so constant _ 40 came in before 10
a.m. _ that the governor's office turned off the fax machine
Thursday. When they turned it back on Friday, the messages still
were pouring in.
   O'Neill's press secretary, Jon L. Sandberg, said the governor
still hasn't decided whether he will sign the bill.
   But aides said the persistent lobbying campaign proved how
annoying unwanted messages can be. The inconvenience was compounded
because the governor's office was unable to use its facsimile
machine to receive information about spring flooding around the
state.
   In his letter, Monagan urged the California-based fax users
committee to come up with ``a different and more effective way of
getting your message across.''
   The committee doesn't have a listed telephone number, so Monagan
did the logical thing. He transmitted the letter to the committee's
fax line.
   A facsimile message sent by The Associated Press to the National
Fax Users Committee to a telephone number listed on the committee's
documents went unanswered Friday.

<HEAD>Sihanouk Warns Of Khmer Rouge `Blitzkrieg'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The communist Khmer Rouge will ``try to
launch a blitzkrieg against Phnom Penh'' after Vietnamese troops
withdraw from Cambodia, resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk
said today.
   Sihanouk, 67, told reporters he was ``sure'' civil war would
erupt in Cambodia after the pullout that Vietnam has pledged to
complete by Sept. 30. The Khmer Rouge would seek a quick victory,
before countries start recognizing the Vietnamese-installed
government as the nation's legitimate rulers, he said.
   The prince said the Khmer Rouge, with an estimated 40,000
guerrillas and enough weapons for 120,000 fighters, would go to
battle unless they are included in a provisional government.
   He said the provisional government should include the
Vietnamese-installed government and the guerrilla coalition
comprising the Khmer Rouge, Sihanouk's forces and the
anti-communist forces of former Premier Son Sann.
   He said Hun Sen, premier of the Phnom Penh government, was
``absolutely wrong'' to believe that an alliance between Hun Sen
and Sihanouk would bring peace to Cambodia.
   ``We have to acknowledge the Khmer Rouge ... are certainly very
bad people, very cruel. They are even criminals, but they are
there,'' he said.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978, ousted the radical
Khmer Rouge that had ruled the country since the spring of 1975 and
set up another communist government.
   The Khmer Rouge came to power by defeating the U.S.-backed
Cambodian government. During its brief rule up to 2 million
Cambodians were killed in purges or died of starvation.
   The Khmer Rouge on Friday dismissed calls for an immediate truce
as a trick it said the Vietnamese also used during the war with the
Americans to prepare for a military offensive. A text of the
broadcast was seen today in Bangkok.
   Thailand recently proposed a cease-fire before Vietnam's
pullout, and the Vietnamese-installed government and the
non-communist guerrilla groups have agreed.
   The Khmer Rouge rejected the proposal on Monday. In Friday's
broadcast it said that before a truce, there first must be:
   _ a Vietnamese pullout under international supervision
   _ supervision of the withdrawal in strategic areas of Cambodia
   _ supervision of the cease-fire
   _ supervision of the disarming of all sides, and
   _ reduction of all forces to a level to be agreed upon by all
sides.
   ``Otherwise, this cease-fire will be a deception and a lie and
would be most dangerous,'' it said.

<TEXT>
   Film producer Robert Evans has been warned he
could face contempt of court charges for refusing to testify in a
6-year-old murder case linked to the movie ``The Cotton Club.''
   At a preliminary hearing Friday, Evans repeatedly cited his
Fifth Amendment right in refusing to answer a prosecutor's
questions.
   Municipal Court Judge Patti Jo McKay ordered Evans and his
attorney to return to court Monday to resume a hearing into the
1983 murder of New York theatrical producer Roy Radin.
   The case encompasses Hollywood's inner circle, a Latin American
drug network and the security forces of ``Hustler'' magazine
publisher Larry Flynt.
   Evans' lawyer, Robert L. Shapiro, said his client would not
testify until the prosecution clears him of suspicion.
   Deputy District Attorney David Conn has refused to rule out
Evans as a suspect and has refused to offer him immunity from
prosecution for his testimony.
   Evans, the former head of production at Paramount Pictures who
produced ``Chinatown'' and ``The Godfather,'' gave only his name at
the hearing.
   After he refused to answer a string of unanswered questions,
McKay conferred with Evans and Shapiro in her chambers. She then
ruled that Evans must answer the prosecutor's questions when the
hearing resumes.
   A former Evans confidante and reputed drug dealer, Karen Delayne
``Laynie'' Greenberger, is charged with the Radin murder along with
three former Flynt bodyguards, Alex Lamota Marti, William Molony
Mentzer and Robert Ulmer Lowe.
   Prosecutors allege that Mrs. Greenberger, a reputed drug dealer
with ties to Colombian kingpin Carlos Lehder, hired killers to
murder Radin in a dispute over who would profit from the
multimillion-dollar deal to finance ``The Cotton Club.''
   Evans was working with Radin to finance the movie when, six
years ago today, on May 13, 1983, the 33-year-old producer
disappeared. The pudgy, cocaine-sniffing Radin was last seen
getting into a limousine with Mrs. Greenberger en route to dinner
at La Scala restaurant in Beverly Hills.
   A month later he was found shot to death in a dry riverbed 65
miles north of Los Angeles.
   Actor Demond Wilson, former star of ``Sanford and Son,'' was one
of the last to see Radin alive and is expected to be a key witness.
   Radin, a flamboyant impresario who made his money from rock and
vaudeville shows and lived in a 72-room mansion on New York's Long
Island, sought to become a movie mogul through ``The Cotton Club.''
   His murder remained a mystery until last year when Flynt's
former brother-in-law, William Ryder, came forward with
information. Ryder headed Flynt's private security army.
   The hearing is to determine whether there is enough evidence to
bring Mrs. Greenberger and her co-defendants to trial.

   A man shot his wife and two sons to death
in their beds and then spent several days locked in the house with
his 9-year-old daughter before turning a handgun on her and
himself, authorities said.
   David M. Fager, 34, apparently was distraught over being
unemployed several months, state police Sgt. Dallard Tackett said
Friday.
   Relatives and police broke into the house and found the bodies
Thursday after school authorities reported not seeing the children
since May 3.
   The bodies of Fager, his wife, Roxane, 31; and their children,
Bruce Allan, 16; Michael Edward, 11; and Melissa Lynn, 9; were
found in bed in the family's one-story home.
   All five had been shot in the head, Dekalb County Coroner
William Hathaway said.
   Autopsies showed Fager and his daughter died within 24 hours of
the discovery of the bodies, he said. Mrs. Fager and the two sons
had been dead three or four days.
   A handgun was found near Fager's body, police said. There were
no signs of forced entry or struggle, and Hathaway said there was
no evidence of molestation.
   Mrs. Fager's mother, Jeannette Waymire of Peru, Ind., said the
couple moved to Waterloo from Peru about four years ago.
   ``We didn't have any inkling that this would occur,'' Mrs.
Waymire said.
   She said the family was living on an inheritance from Fager's
father and her son-in-law was attending Indiana
Vocational-Technical College in Fort Wayne. She said he had been
employed at MCI Communications.
   A spokesman at MCI's Chicago office said Fager worked as a field
engineer in Fort Wayne for almost two years until Feb. 28, 1987,
when he quit.
   Mrs. Waymire said she and her husband, Walter, went to the
Fagers' home Thursday. When they could not get inside, her husband
took a shovel from the garage and smashed a bedroom window, parted
the curtains and saw the bodies. Moments later, police arrived and
broke down a door leading from the garage.
   ``They were the best, most beautiful family that ever lived,''
Mrs. Waymire said. ``It will be tough to go through this Mother's
Day.''
   A memorial service is scheduled at 5:30 p.m. Sunday in
Flowers-Leedy Funeral Home in Peru.
   Another memorial service will be conducted Monday in Waterloo,
said DeKalb School Superintendent James Watson. Counselors and
teachers, and other professionals if necessary, will be available
to talk with students at schools the Fager children attended.
   Virginia Moore, the family's next-door neighbor, said she used
to talk over the fence with Mrs. Fager.
   ``They were both very devoted to their kids,'' Ms. Moore said.

<TEXT>
   Soldiers aided by a former communist
rebel have found three mass graves where the remains of scores of
people killed by guerrillas are believed buried, a military
spokesman said today.
   On strife-torn Mindanao Island, New People's Army guerrillas
holding eight government militiamen said today they will release
their captives if the military would stop their operation against
them.
   Col. Tranquilino Aspiras said the graves, in two provinces just
south of Manila, are believed to contain about the bodies of about
100 people killed by the New People's Army in a purge of suspected
military spies in their ranks following a series of arrests of
ranking rebel leaders last year.
   ``We have discovered communist killing fields,'' Aspiras said.
``These atrocities have been left unreported because of the secrecy
of the killings. The murders must be unmasked.''
   Reporters who accompanied the soldiers said they counted 28
bodies, including six women, in the mass grave in the town of
Kavinti in Laguna province. Most of the remains were bones but some
still had flesh, indicating they were killed recently.
   Aspiras said digging was hampered by rough terrain, and soldiers
were still clearing the area of trees to allow helicopters to
deliver supplies and additional men.
   A former rebel who surrendered in January, Severino Ranoda,
disclosed the location of the graves, Aspiras said.
   The soldiers were preparing to move on to two other mass grave
sites in nearby Quezon province.
   Police said 10 government militiamen were captured Wednesday by
rebels posing as soldiers in Mandug district on the outskirts of
Davao city, about 610 miles southeast of Manila.
   The rebels released two who reported the incident to
authorities, said police Lt. Danilo Corral. Corral said the rebels
also took five M-14 rifles and a two-way radio from the militiamen.
   In a statement, the rebels they would release their captives if
the military stops its offensive in Davao and two nearby provinces
because the operation was forcing civilians to evacuate. It did not
say how many people were forced to flee their homes.
   The rebels also said military should allow relief agencies,
church groups and reporters into the ``militarized'' areas.
   The communists have been fighting the government for 20 years.

<HEAD>Antiques Dealer Found Innocent After Fourth Murder Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It took eight years and four murder trials,
but a jury finally agreed with what an antiques dealer had said all
along: he killed a 21-year-old man in self-defense, not in a
jealous rage.
   ``After eight years of mental, physical and financial torture,
it feels good that justice finally has been served,'' James
Williams said after his acquittal Friday.
   The 58-year-old Savannah dealer had been convicted twice in the
May 2, 1981, slaying of Danny Lewis Hansford, but those verdicts
were overturned on appeal. A third trial ended in a hung jury.
   The fourth trial was moved to Augusta at the defense's request,
and defense attorney Frank Seiler credited the change for the
verdict.
   ``I knew we had to get it out of Chatham County. That's the
key,'' he said.
   ``I'm not surprised. I'm delighted,'' Williams concurred.
``There's a difference. ... This jury up here was fair and square,
and so was the judge. These people knew how to read between the
lines.
   Prosecutors alleged Williams was having a homosexual affair with
Hansford and shot him in a jealous frenzy, then arranged the scene
to make it appear to be self-defense. Hansford was shot three times
in the study of Williams' home.
   Williams admitted the shooting but said he shot only after
Hansford fired at him first during an argument.
   District Attorney Spencer Lawton Jr. said he accepted the
verdict. ``It is not my practice to second-guess jurors,'' he said.
   Williams was prominent in Savannah society as an art expert,
restorer of old homes and historic preservationist. He had hired
Hansford to work around his home, a restored 1860s mansion.
   On Thursday, a former girlfriend of Hansford testified that he
drank too much, used drugs, didn't want to work and was hostile
toward Williams.
   Debbie Blivens told prosecutors Hansford had a room in Williams'
house and lived there. Williams had testified that Hansford was a
``house guest'' but did not live with him.
   In closing arguments Friday, Seiler contended the prosecution's
case was based on a ``ridiculous theory.''
   ```Murder, She Wrote' hasn't come up with the bizarre things
they've dreamed of,'' he said, referring to the CBS television
series.

<HEAD>Arafat Accuses U.S. of Blackmailing WHO to Keep PLO Out</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat left the capital
today after accusing Washington of using blackmail and threats
against the World Health Organization to prevent the PLO from
joining the U.N. body.
   Arafat, who arrived for talks with President Robert Mugabe on
prospects for Middle East peace, told a news conference late Friday
that U.S. threats resulted in the PLO's membership bid being
rejected earlier that day.
   Mugabe is chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement, a grouping of
Third World nations that is an alternative to the East and West
power blocs. The PLO, considered by Zimbabwe to be an independent
state, is a member of the movement.
   Arafat and Mugabe held talks behind closed doors on proposals
drafted by the 101-member Non-Aligned Movement for an end to the
17-month Palestinian uprising in Israel's occupied territories,
officials said.
   Mugabe was at Harare International Airport to see Arafat off
today. Officials did not immediately know his destination.
   Under U.S. prodding, the WHO deferred until next year a decision
on whether to admit the Palestine Liberation Organization's
self-proclaimed state of Palestine as its 167th member.
   After Friday's vote by the WHO annual assembly in Geneva, the
PLO vowed to continue its campaign for membership in U.N. agencies.
   The assembly voted 83-47 in a secret ballot Friday in favor of a
resolution co-sponsored by nine Western and Third World countries
to defer the bid.
   The United States, which threatens to withdraw funding to any
U.N. agency that admits Palestine state as a member, hailed the
assembly's decision. The State Department said the vote ``rejected
the PLO's efforts to politicize WHO's important work.''
   Without elaborating, Arafat accused Washington of using
``pressure, blackmail and threats'' against the WHO.
   In Harare, Arafat also accused the United States and Israel of
blocking efforts toward Middle East peace, saying all the
initiatives were being made by the PLO.
   But later, at a PLO dinner, Arafat said he was confident ongoing
efforts toward peace would succeed.
   ``The alternative would be total destruction,'' he said.
   Arafat was given a formal welcome usually reserved for visiting
heads of state when he arrived Friday from neighboring Zambia.
   It was Arafat's first visit to Zimbabwe since his organization's
declaration of independence in November. He had previously been in
Zimbabwe on three occasions.

   A fugitive captured here was a con man
who persuaded 6,000 people, including former test pilot Chuck
Yeager, to donate time or money for a Vietnam War memorial that was
never built, authorities said.
   Michael J. Crosby told supporters of the plan that receipts from
the sale of his $100 ``Forgotten Man'' medallions would help build
a memorial park, authorities said. He got Yeager to make a
videotape touting the project.
   Crosby, 42, was arrested Thursday by the FBI at his home in Boca
Raton.
   He was ordered held without bail until he can be returned to
Minneapolis, where he faces a 160-year prison sentence from a
November conviction on mail fraud charges.
   ``I think he exploited the feelings of people that Vietnam vets
were not given a fair shake,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Joan
Lancaster of Minneapolis. ``He is a cold-hearted fraud artist.''
   Crosby's company, ``Vets for Vets,'' solicited investors in a
plan to build a veterans memorial park near Mount Rushmore in the
Black Hills of South Dakota, Lancaster said. But Crosby reneged on
a $90,000 land contract and the park was never built.
   Likewise, only 400 of the 6,000 people throughout the United
States who bought Crosby's commemorative medallions ever received
the coins, Lancaster said.
   Yeager, the first man to fly faster than sound, has testified
that he never signed a contract permitting Crosby to use the
videotape. Yeager said he had hoped to check out Crosby's company
before granting the permission.

   Czech activist Stanislav Devaty, arrested
after demonstrating for democracy at the official May Day parade,
is in intensive care in a Prague clinic after a 12-day hunger
strike, a dissident said today.
   Anna Sabatova, like Devaty a prominent signatory of the Charter
77 human rights document, said by telephone from Prague that Devaty
was transferred Friday to the clinic from the hospital at the
city's Pankrac prison.
   Devaty, a 37-year-old former Charter 77 spokesman, has been held
at Pankrac since his arrest May 1 on charges of violating public
order. He faces up to five years in jail if convicted.
   The detention came only two weeks after he was released from
jail in Brno after staging a 28-day protest fast.
   Devaty is one of the most committed political activists in
Czechoslovakia, and Ms. Sabatova said he refused to take either
food or drink while in Pankrac.
   After consulting with doctors in the Prague civilian clinic, he
agreed to take a special liquid, but no solids, she said. She added
it appeared prison authorities want Devaty transferred back to
Pankrac soon because hospital rules forbid guards to stand in
Devaty's room at the clinic.
   Devaty was among 76 protesters detained on May Day when about
600 people demonstrated in Prague's Wenceslas Square for more
democracy and the release of political prisoners.

   Esteban DeJesus, a lightweight
boxer who fought in the shadow of Roberto Duran during the 1970s,
died Thursday of complications of AIDS at age 37.
   He contracted acquired immune deficiency syndrome during the
early 1980s while serving a life sentence in prison for the fatal
shooting of a teen-ager in 1981. He was released from prison on the
condition he remain in a clinic which specializes in treating AIDS
patients and drug rehabilitation.
   DeJesus fought Duran three times and was the first and only man
to beat the Panamanian boxer during the 1970s. After Duran was
stripped of championship recognition by the World Boxing Council,
he won the WBC title in 1976. He and Duran met for the undisputed
title, with Duran winning on a 12th-round knockout Jan. 21, 1978,
in Las Vegas.

   Riot police with truncheons and
shields held back thousands of protesters denouncing the death of a
student who dissidents claim was killed by police.
   Students and Kwangju residents pushed and shoved riot police
guarding a square in front the provincial government building as
speakers denounced the government of President Roh Tae-woo.
   Troopers rushed out with truncheons and shields, hitting and
kicking the protesters, to stop them from reaching the government
building.
   But police did not prevent about 10,000 people from holding a
rally in the square in front of the building in this provincial
capital 170 miles south of Seoul. There were no immediate reports
of injuries and arrests.
   Protesters cheered and applauded as their leaders called for a
nationwide movement to topple Roh and expel U.S. troops from South
Korea. Speakers accused Roh of attempting to impose authoritarian
rule and the crowd responded with chants of ``Down with Roh
Tae-woo!''
   Earlier, demonstrators shoved riot troopers blocking the way as
about 15,000 people tried to march to the city center to denounce
the death of radical student Lee Chul-kyu, whose body was found
Wednesday.
   In Seoul, the government said today it has protested to the U.S.
government for ``irresponsible remarks'' over Lee's death, which it
said were made publicly Friday by a U.S. State Department official
in Washington.
   Assistant Foreign Minister Lee Jung-bin said a U.S. official
termed Lee's death a ``deplorable event and atrocious act'' and
said ``we hope the murderers will be exposed and severly punished.''
   The Foreign Ministry said it told the U.S. Embassy in Seoul that
the remarks ``lack a sense of responsibility and could affect the
investigation.'' The U.S. Embassy did not return telephone calls
inquiring about the comments.
   The crowd cheered as dissident leaders claimed police
interrogators tortured Lee to death.
   ``This barbarous act was committed by the suppressive security
forces to suppress the national democratic movement,'' claimed
dissident leader Chang Ki-pyo.
   Dissidents claiming a government probe is trying to cover up the
incident are demanding a full and independent investigation into
his death and punishment of police officers allegedly involved.
   Police have denied any official involvement in Lee's death.
Doctors said an initial autopsy failed to determine the cause of
death.
   Lee was being hunted by police for pro-North Korean articles and
other political activities. He had spent almost two years in jail
for anti-government activities.
   Lee's death could provoke widespread protests in Kwangju,
especially since it came one week before the anniversary of a 1980
anti-government uprising in the city in which at least 192 people
died.
   South Korea has been rocked by violent anti-government protests
and strikes in recent months, but radical groups have little public
support because of their violent tactics and extreme views. Roh has
ordered a series of crackdowns to stop the dissident movement.

   A moderate earthquake measuring an estimated 5
on the Richter scale today shook the border region between the
Soviet Union and North Korea, the Hong Kong Royal Observatory
reported.
   There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.
   An observatory statement said the quake measured 5 on the
Richter scale. The statement said the epicenter was about 370 miles
northeast of the South Korean capital of Seoul.
   A spokesman said the quake was recorded at 11.41 a.m. but that
no other details were available.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   Every increase in one number means that the ground motion is 10
times greater. A magnitude 5 quake can cause considerable damage on
land.

   An elderly British citizen disappeared in
Syrian-controlled Moslem west Beirut and is feared kidnapped, his
wife said today. A previously unknown group issued a claim of
responsibility.
   Jack Mann, 83, a former pilot with Lebanon's national airline,
left his apartment on foot at 11 a.m. Friday and headed for the
British Bank of the Middle East about 12 blocks away, said his
wife, Sunny.
   Employees at the bank say he never got there.
   The Foreign Office in London confirmed in a statement that Mann,
a former Royal Air Force squadron leader, has disappeared in Beirut.
   A group calling itself The Cells of Armed Struggle issued a
claim of responsibility in a statement handwritten in Arabic and
delivered Friday to a Western news agency.
   The group did not mention the name of the Briton, but demanded
the release of comrades jailed in connection with the killing of a
Palestinian cartoonist in London in 1987.
   An editor at the news agency, requesting anonymity, said the
agency did not report the claim because there were no indications
then that a Briton was missing.
   The statement said: ``We declare our readiness to immediately
release the captive if the British government announces the
beginning of a fair trial for our comrades.
   ``We ask the British government to release our comrades detained
without evidence on charge of assassinating comrade Naji al-Ali,''
it said.
   Naji Ali, whose real name is Ali Naji Adhami, died Aug. 30,
1987, from wounds he suffered five weeks earlier when a lone
asassin shot him outside the London offices of the Kuwaiti
newspaper Al-Qabas. An investigation was launched into the killing,
but it was not known if any arrests have been made.
   The Cells of Armed Struggle claimed the Palestinian cartoonist
``died at the hands of the (Israeli secret service) Mossad in
cooperation with the British intelligence to drive a wedge and
deepen differences within Palestinian ranks.''
   Mann is a retired Royal Air Force pilot who later worked for
Middle East Airlines, Lebanon's national airliner.
   ``I don't know for sure if he's been kidnapped, but I presume
so,'' Mrs. Mann said.
   A friend of Mann's, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he
saw the missing Briton at about 11:15 a.m. Friday near the bank.
   ``I remember he had blue trousers and was walking slowly in the
direction of the bank,'' the friend said.
   An employee at the British Bank of the Middle East said he did
not arrive.
   After his retirement in the early 1960s, Mann worked for 10
years as a bartender at the Pickwick Pub in west Beirut.
   Mrs. Mann recently appeared in a program on foreigners living in
Lebanon screened by the state television.
   Asked why she and her husband continued to live in this
kidnap-plagued city, Mrs. Mann said: ``We've been living here for a
long, long time. We feel this is our home. We're not going to
leave.''
   The suspected abduction comes after Hashemi Rafsanjani, speaker
of Iran's Parliament, urged Palestinians on May 5 to launch a
worldwide campaign of terror against Britons, Americans and French.
Rafsanjani later said his remarks were misinterpreted.
   On May 4, three West German relief workers were captured in
Beirut and two were released 10 hours later. The third, Markus
Quint, is being held by unidentified kidnappers who are demanding
lenient sentences or freedom for prominent Palestinian terrorists,
the other two hostages said.
   No direct claim of responsibility is known to have been received
in that case.
   Fifteen other Western hostages are believed held by Moslem
fundamentalists, most of them loyal to Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's Islamic government in Iran. The hostages include four
Britons, nine Americans, a Belgian and an Italian.
   Longest held is Terry A. Anderson, 41, of Lorain, Ohio, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was
kidnapped in west Beirut March 16, 1985.
   Relations between Tehran and London were severed in February
after Khomeini issued an edict calling on Moslems to kill British
writer Salman Rushdie. Many Moslems believe Rushdie's novel ``The
Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam.

   About 1,000 Chinese students began a hunger
strike in Tiananmen Square today to press for democratic reforms,
and student leaders said the government agreed to discuss their
demands.
   Student leader Wang Dan of Beijing University said students
still may be in the square on Monday when Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev arrives for the first Sino-Soviet summit in three decades.
   ``As for whether we will disrupt Mr. Gorbachev's visit to China,
that depends on the government,'' Wang said.
   He said he hoped Gorbachev would tell Chinese leaders about his
``good experience'' in political reform. However, he said he didn't
expect the students to have a chance to talk to Gorbachev.
   He added, ``Mr. Gorbachev's visit to China is a state affair.
I'm sure he won't come to Tiananmen Square to get involved in
Chinese politics.''
   Student leaders also said that on Friday night, in a major
concession, the government agreed to hold talks with an independent
student group on the student demands for sweeping democratic
reforms and an end to official corruption.
   ``But they made certain conditions,'' said Wang Chaohua, a
graduate student at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
   ``They said the number of (student) delegates could not exceed
20'' and reporters would be allowed to issue only partial reports
on the talks. The students are demanding that the talks be
broadcast in full.
   Miss Wang said the students were not satisfied with the offer.
The offer nevetheless is a major concession because the government
previously had insisted that all talks be held through
government-sponsored student unions.
   Thousands of passers-by crowded the square for a look at the
protest, which marked the eighth time students have marched to
Tiananmen since they began a campaign for political change on April
15.
   Students from more than a dozen schools sat in neat rows on the
vast square, the symbolic center of power in China. Some had
canteens of water, others sat on blankets. Several read the works
of Indian leader Mohandas K. Gandhi, famed for his fasting and
non-violent opposition to British colonial rule.
   About three rows of student surrounded the strikers, protecting
them from onlookers.
   Meanwhile, another group of students went to the Soviet Embassy
and delivered an open letter in Russian inviting Gorbachev to speak
at Beijing University. Student leader Zhang Jun said students had
collected 6,000 signatures.
   Emerging from the embassy, Zhang said the Soviets told him they
would give the letter to Gorbachev but that his schedule was very
tight.
   Gorbachev's four-day visit, which begins Monday, will mark the
first time a Soviet leader has come to China in 30 years. Students
also are planning a demonstration to ``welcome'' the Soviet
president on Monday.
   In a related matter, the Foreign Ministry said today that U.S.
warships scheduled to make a port call at Shanghai on Friday, one
day after Gorbachev is to visit the city.
   Earlier, U.S. sources said the ships would arrive on Thursday.
Foreign diplomats in Beijing said the Soviet side was unhappy about
the naval visit, which the Soviets saw as a signal by China that
better Sino-Soviet relations would not influence China's strong
links with the United States.

<DATELINE>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state law that requires pregnant
teen-agers to have the consent of a parent or a judge before
getting an abortion has been called ``constitutionally infirm'' by
a Florida appeals court.
   The 5th District Court of Appeal in Daytona Beach agreed with
Lake Circuit Judge Jerry Lockett who ruled May 4 that the
abortion-consent law was unconstitutionally vague.
   The appeals court also said in its ruling Friday that the state
law failed to protect the privacy of minors guaranteed under Roe
vs. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court decision which made abortion legal.
   Rulings by district courts of appeal are binding statewide
unless _ as often happens in controversial cases _ another state
appeals court decides to take a similar case and reaches a
different decision, said Volusia Circuit Judge C. McFerrin Smith.
   Then, for the decision to apply statewide, it would have to be
appealed to the Florida Supreme Court.
   The court, in a 2-1 ruling, sent the case back to Lockett with
the order that he dismiss the petition filed by a 15-year-old
pregnant teen-ager who had sought his permission for an abortion.
   ``The decision to terminate the pregnancy is up to (the girl)
and her physician without state regulation,'' the court ruled.
   The state law was so vague, the ruling said, that there was ``a
clear danger that trial judges would render a decision on the basis
of their own moral, religious or political beliefs regarding
abortion.''
   Judge Warren Cobb, who issued a two-paragraph dissent, said the
court should send the issue to the Florida Supreme Court as
requested by Attorney General Bob Butterworth.
   The law approved by the Legislature last year requires single
girls under age 18 to get permission from a parent, guardian or
judge before obtaining an abortion.
   It says judges can grant approval if they decide the girl is
sufficiently mature to make the decision, if consent is being
unreasonably withheld by a parent or guardian, or if the girl fears
emotional or physical abuse if she tells her parents.

   Cordova's project was called ``Observation of Phase Front
Reversal from Laser Levitated Materials.''
   A third student, Shreyas S. Vasanawala, a 16-year-old junior
from Sidney Linier High School in Montgomery, Ala., was named
alternate winner. His exhibit was called ``Electroheological
Stress-Strain Behavior.''
   The Nobel Prize Visit Award was the final honor bestowed Friday
by the ISEF awards program, which sponsored a week of exhibitions
here by 750 high school students from 14 countries and territories.
   Science Service, the non-profit organization that oversees ISEF,
also presents cash awards to first- through fourth-place winners
selected from 13 categories, including the behavioral sciences,
physics and zoology.
   ``The ISEF participants represent the most promising student
scientists of the year,'' said Science Service Director Edward G.
Sherburne Jr. ``Their work here represents the future of science in
America and around the world.''
   The exhibits were judged by scientists, educators and
professionals from Pittsburgh universities, businesses and
professional associations.

   The Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting
Countries today voted to readmit Egypt, 10 years after Cairo's
membership was suspended for signing a peace treaty with Israel,
the Kuwaiti Oil Minister said.
   Sheik Ali Khalifa Sabah of Kuwait declined to say whether the
vote was unanimous, but sources said Libya cast a negative ballot.
   The vote, a step by Egypt back into the Arab fold, came at a
meeting of 10 OAPEC nations. Egypt is the 11th member of the
Kuwait-based organization.
   Before the meeting, Arab sources called Cairo's reinstatement a
``foregone conclusion.''
   Libya's oil minister, Fawzi Shakshouki, indicated Tripoli
opposed Egypt's return to OAPEC, but would abide by majority
decision.
   ``We will not pull out,'' Shakshouki said.
   He said, however, Libya would continue to oppose Egypt's return
to Arab organizations ``as long as the causes of its suspension do
not vanish.''
   Egypt lost its place in all Arab institutions after its
membership in the Arab League was suspended in 1979 for signing the
Camp David Accords with Israel. Egypt has still not been reinstated
by the Arab League, but that move is expected at a May 23-24 Arab
summit in Casablanca, Morocco.
   Libya and Syria have tried to block Egypt's return to Arab
organizations. But the Syrians have in recent months moderated
their stand against Egypt.
   Opening the meeting, OAPEC chairman Mana Saeed Otaiba, the
United Arab Emirates' oil minister, called for restoring Egypt to
OAPEC.
   ``The Arab family will remain incomplete as long as Egypt
remains outside,'' he declared. ``Egypt is a mother, sister and
daughter of the Arab nation ... we hope this meeting will handle
the question.''
   OAPEC sources said the organization's charter stipulates that
two-thirds of the members and two-thirds of the founders must vote
for membership to be restored.
   OAPEC, was founded in 1968 by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Libya as
a forum for coordinating Arab oil policies. The other members are
Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Algeria, Tunisia, Bahrain,
Syria and Egypt.
   Seven countries double as members of the 13-nation Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

   A lawyer handling a paternity suit
against Coleman Young says he's ready to start negotiating support
payments after releasing blood tests indicating the Detroit mayor
fathered a 6-year-old boy.
   ``Paternity is practically proved, with that one iota of
possibility that he's not (the father). And I think that in a court
of law, this would be acceptable evidence to prove that he is,''
Dearborn lawyer Noel Keane said Friday.
   Results from Edward W. Sparrow Hospital in Lansing show a
99.9999 percent likelihood that Young, 70, fathered Joel Loving.
The boy lives with his mother, Annivory Calvert, in Fontana, Calif.
   A second set of tests, analyzed at the Memorial Blood Center of
Minneapolis Inc. at the request of Young's attorneys, showed a
99.999 percent likelihood the mayor is the father.
   Calvert, 34, a former Detroit assistant director of public
works, took a job as public works director in Fontana shortly
before filing her suit in January. She was out of the office on
business Friday and unavailable for comment, her secretary said.
   Young was vacationing Friday and could not be reached.
   ``Until all institutions have reported, and particularly until
the DNA fingerprinting is reported, the attorneys for Mayor Young
will have no further comment,'' Young's attorney, Lawrence
Charfoos, said in a written statement.
   Keane said further action is unlikely pending results of similar
blood tests by Cellmark Diagnostics of Germantown, Md. Those tests
also were requested by Young's attorneys, he said.
   Tests to determine paternity included DNA analysis and at least
14 other comparisons of the blood samples.
   Calvert seeks unspecified child support, Keane said. She also
wants Young to exercise visitation rights, he said.
   Keane said he expects Young, who has been married and divorced
twice, to acknowledge paternity when all the results are in,
clearing the way to negotiate child-support payments.
   Calvert said she had a relationship with Young from 1980-87.
Keane has released snapshots of Young holding Calvert's baby. The
attorney said the child is aware that Young has been alleged to be
his father.
   ``He was asked here in my office who his dad was and he said
`Coleman Young,''' Keane said. ``But he kind of said it very
sheepishly because it was maybe something that he was told not to
go around saying.''
   Young is expected to seek his fifth term as mayor of the
nation's sixth-largest city later this year, and some supporters
have alleged the suit was filed for political reasons.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic Church, highly
influential in Panama, has condemned strongman leader Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega and called on his soldiers to quit terrorizing
residents.
   Police maintained roadblocks in sections of the capital early
today, and groups of U.S. servicemen attended discotheques despite
strong U.S. advice to remain on military bases.
   The church, in an unusually stern statement Friday, assailed
last Sunday's elections as fraud-ridden and appealed to the Noriega
supporters who beat the opposition candidates with pipes, sticks
and rubber whips to act with moral restraint.
   Latin American leaders also intensified efforts to negotiate an
end to the crisis as hundreds of U.S. troops soldiers in by
President Bush to protect Americans in Panama or working at the
Panama Canal arrived at U.S. bases. Nearly 1,900 U.S. soldiers are
expected to arrive over the next week.
   Japan also urged the government to ``respect the general will of
the people.'' The request came in a letter from Japan's ambassador
to Panama, Jumpei Kato, about election irregulaties.
   Meanwhile, Noriega and acting President Manuel Solis Palma
remain out of sight. Neither has been seen in public or made a
statement in a week.
   The government, blaming the United States in part for
interferring in internal affairs, nullified an election in which
international observers said opposition candidate Guillermo Endara
was beating Noriega's handpicked candidate, Carlos Duque, 3-to-1.
No new elections have been scheduled.
   Venezuela, a leader in the regional democratic effort and a
vocal opponent of Noriega, recalled its ambassador Friday,
following similar moves by the United States and Mexico.
   The Washington Post reported in today's editions that Venezuelan
President Carlos Andres Perez, during an interview, offered Noriega
asylum in Venezuela. The paper provided no further details on the
offer.
   The United States has sought to oust Noriega from power since he
was indicted on drug-trafficking charges last year in Miami and
Tampa, Fla. Noriega, head of the 15,000-member Defense Forces,
denies the charges.
   Noriega has successfully weathered political and economic
turmoil since Febrary 1988, when he engineered the ouster of
President Eric Arturo Delvalle. Delvalle tried to fire Noriega
after the general was indicted.
   The United States continues to recognize Delvalle despite the
installation of Solis Palma and has hit Panama with economic
sanctions that created cash shortages, caused capital flight and
contributed to a decline of its international banking business.
   On Friday, Panama postponed classes for its 600,000 school
children and 60,000 university students, citing actions by the
``deranged administration of President Bush.''
   Government television appealed for calm while a
government-controlled newspaper named Bush ``Bum of the Day.''
   In Washington, the Organization of American States accepted
Venezuela's proposal to discuss the Panamanian crisis on Wednesday.
Approval came after a stormy two-hour meeting.
   But Panama's representative, Carlos Russell, blasted U.S.
actions, saying, ``We will not bow to the colossus of the north.''
   In a sharp break from the government, the Church in this
predominately Catholic nation of 2.2 million assailed the electoral
process and civil unrest.
   ``What moral justification can there be for terrorizing the
population with gangs feeding on hate and a false nationalism?''
the statement said.
   The statement and the American decision to add reinforcements to
the 10,000-member U.S. force were inspired at least in part by a
Wednesday attack by thugs on Endara and his two vice presidential
running mates. Endara remained hospitalized Friday but was
described to be in good spirits.
   C-141 and C-5A jets, the largest in the American arsenal, landed
at Howard Air Force Base about every half hour with Marine and Army
troops, vehicles and other equipment.
   A Marine sergeant said, ``We're glad to be here.'' Arriving
troops were not permitted to be interviewed.
   About 3,000 dependents of American military and embassy
personnel and civilian military employees have moved onto military
bases as have an estimated 160 Panamanians seeking refuge.
   The Southern Command canceled all unofficial off-base activities
and urged military personnel to stay out of public areas.
   There has been no official Panamanian reaction to the increase
in troops, which is permitted under the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaty
that will give the Panama Canal to Panama at the end of the century.

<HEAD>Soviet Pullout from Czechoslovakia Begins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union today began a
partial withdrawal of soldiers and tanks stationed in
Czechoslovakia. It was the first pullout of permanent Soviet forces
since a 1968 invasion to crush Communist-led reform.
   A 6{-mile column of Soviet army vehicles headed home from the
north Moravian city of Olomouc, according to state-run media. A
brief ceremony sponsored by local Communist Party officials marked
the departure. The reports did not say how many soldiers and tanks
were in the procession.
   The partial withdrawal of Soviet soldiers was announced in
December by Mikhail S. Gorbachev as part of an overall plan to cut
the Red Army by half a million men by 1991.
   Gorbachev's promised withdrawal of 50,000 Soviet troops and
5,000 tanks from East Germany, Hungary and Czechoslovakia by 1991
began last month with the much publicized departure of 31 T-64
tanks from a base in southern Hungary. Soviet troops and tanks have
also begun to leave East Germany.
   Until Alexander Dubcek launched the short-lived ``Prague
Spring'' reforms in 1968, the Kremlin had no troops or tanks
permanently stationed in Czechoslovakia.
   Soviet and other Warsaw Pact troops and tanks first entered the
country for lengthy maneuvers in mid-1968 in a sign of increasing
nervousness among Czechoslovakia's Communist allies over Dubcek's
reforms.
   The Warsaw Pact forces withdrew to just over the Czechoslovak
border in July 1968, but returned Aug. 20. The invasion crushed
reforms and led to the expulsion of Dubcek and nearly 500,000
others from the Communist Party.
   According to Western estimates, the Soviets have about 80,000
soldiers in Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovak chief of staff, Gen.
Miroslav Vacek, said in February the Soviets will withdraw 5,300
soldiers, 708 tanks and 20 planes by the end of 1990. Four
battalions numbering some 1,500 men will be withdrawn this year.

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 24-year-old woman told a judge that she
tried to flee a drug cult after its leader, her ex-boyfriend,
admitted killing people on a ranch near the Texas border.
   Sara Aldrete Villarreal and two other cult members were
arraigned Friday on murder charges in the killing of their leader,
Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, and his closest associate.
   Constanzo, linked to the deaths of 15 people at a ranch near the
border city of Matamoros in April, died during a police manhunt
when he reputedly ordered his minions to kill him as they holed up
in Mexico City.
   Although Ms. Aldrete was one of the suspects in the 15 earlier
deaths, she has not been charged in those crimes. Five other people
were arrested in Matamoros last month in connection with the
earlier killings.
   Ms. Aldrete was arraigned on two counts of murder, criminal
association and resisting arrest. Also arraigned on murder and
other charges were Alvaro de Leon Valdez and Omar Francisco Orea.
   Dressed in a prison uniform and standing behind bars in a
chamber off the courtroom, Ms. Aldrete denied she was involved in
Constanzo's death.
   She shook her head ``No'' when an official of the 58th Federal
District Court, reading from a transcript of her statements during
interrogation, said she urged Alvaro de Leon Valdez to obey when
Constanzo, 26, ordered himself and Martin Quintana killed to avoid
capture.
   ``Everyone was yelling'' when police closed in, she said. ``I
was ... extremely nervous. What I yelled to Alvaro de Leon was that
they stop shooting, that they (the police) were going to kill all
of us,'' she told the court.
   ``I never gave orders to kill Adolfo,'' she said.
   At the end of the proceedings, Ms. Aldrete's lawyer, Horacio
Moyar Quintanilla, told the court there was no evidence to support
the first two charges. He did not comment on the third.
   She also testified that Florentino Ventura, a veteran police
officer who allegedly killed his wife and another woman before
shooting himself on Sept. 17, was described by Constanzo as his
``godson.''
   Ventura was Interpol chief in Mexico since early 1985. Interpol
is a Paris-based organization that coordinates police actions
against international criminals.
   Ms. Aldrete has specified that she practiced ``Christian
Santeria,'' which she said did not include human sacrifices.
   However, she described rituals involving sacrificial killings of
animals. ``The way I found out about the deaths and everything that
happened (at the ranch) was when the bodies were shown on
television,'' she said. She said it was then that Constanzo told
her how they were killed.
   She said four victims, including Texas college student Mark
Kilroy, were human sacrifices. The others, she said, were killed
over drugs, money or other disputes.
   She said she wanted to flee after group members fled to Mexico
City when the bodies were found, but said Constanzo told her: ``You
won't leave here any way but dead since you are a loose cannon.''
   She said she was Constanzo's girlfriend for about a month in
September 1987.
   Judge Bernardo Tirado Gutierrez has until Monday to rule there
is sufficient evidence to presume guilt or drop the charges. The
three are not eligible for bond. If he orders them held, he then
has a year in which to sentence them or find them innocent.

   Panama's would-be president-elect,
Guillermo Endara, spent his 53rd birthday in a hospital bed
recovering from an attack by thugs at a post-election political
rally.
   It was an unlikely spot for Endara, a portly, affable lawyer and
former law professor who headed the opposition ticket in Sunday's
presidential elections. Supporters on Friday gave him an impromptu
birthday party there.
   The government declared itself ahead when it stopped the vote
and nullified the election Wednesday, blaming, among other things,
American interference.
   Exit polls showed Endara and his two vice presidential
candidates with an edge of about 3-1.
   On Wednesday, men wearing T-shirts of Noriega's ``Dignity
Battalions'' battered Endara and his two presidential candidates in
a bloody street scene captured by foreign cameras, sending Endara
to the hospital.
   ``They were not battalions and they have no dignity,'' Endara
said earlier in a hospital interview as supporters held up his
bloodied guayabera, a short-sleeved smock-type shirt favored by
many Latins.
   Endara, a veteran member of the Panamanista Party, ran very much
in the shadow of Panama's grand old man of the opposition, Arnulfo
Arias Madrid, who died last summer in self-imposed exile in Miami.
   Endara was Arias' spokesman in Panama until Arias died and used
to speak, almost dreamily, of the day when Arias would return ``as
a sign of providence'' to lead the country.
   Endara lost control of the party in December to Hildebrando
Nicosia, who ran as a third-party candidate and finished third.
   The opposition Liberal Authentic Party adopted Endara and the
coalition Democratic Opposition Alliance ran him for president.
   Endara served twice in the National Assembly and was Arias'
minister of planning and economic policy in 1968 when Arias was
thrown out of office for the third time after only serving 11 days
as president.
   Endara went into hiding, was jailed for a time and eventually
fled to exile. When Arias reorganized his party as the Authentic
Panamanist Party in 1983 after a long ban on political activity in
Panama, Endara helped.
   Endara, who studied at the University of Panama, in Argentina
and in New York, lacked Arias' charisma and spent most of his time
behind the scenes of the opposition's seemingly endless attempts to
replace the de facto military power that has ruled Panama for 21
years.
   In a pre-election interview he put faith in the hope that the
democratic process in Panama would prevail, electoral fraud or not.
   He said if he won Noriega would be given a chance to leave
gracefully and be fired if he refused.
   Noriega has hired and fired presidents pretty much at will since
he took over the military in 1983. His last victim was Eric
Delvalle, who tried to fire Noriega after the general was indicted
on drug charges last year in the United States.
   Even so, Endara said he trusted the democratic process.
   ``Remember Delvalle was in very different circumstances,'' he
said. ``He was a puppet of the military by the fraud of 1984.
That's the price you pay for not being a democratically elected
person. You are subject to the decisions of the military.''
   He and his wife, Marcella, have one daughter, also named
Marcella.

<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze warned today that the Kremlin might have to consider
developing a new nuclear missile if NATO upgrades its short-range
rockets.
   After a meeting with Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher,
which Shevardnadze described as reflective of a ``new stage in our
relations,'' the Soviet diplomat berated U.S. resistance to talks
on short-range nuclear weapons.
   ``What is to be feared by talking?'' Shevardnadze said at a news
conference. ``No one can be forced in negotiations to do what he
does not want to do.''
   He described NATO plans to replace its current arsenal of Lance
missiles with new rockets of longer range as ``development of a new
weapons system,'' and said the Kremlin would not want to have to
take a similar step.
   ``This would have to be considered, but it would not be by our
own choice,'' Shevardnadze said.
   He likened the new missiles NATO plans to develop to the Soviet
SS-23s that are being removed and dismantled under the superpowers'
December 1987 treaty on the elimination of medium-range missiles.
   NATO plans to replace the Lance rockets, which have a range of
less than 75 miles, with missiles capable of reaching as far as 300
miles, or the upper limit of the short-range category.
   The Soviets contend the NATO plan, known as modernization,
violates the spirit of the INF agreement and would spoil the
atmosphere at other arms control talks.
   That view is shared to a large degree by West Germany, which has
called for U.S.-Soviet negotiations to remove the short-range
rockets. Most of NATO's arsenal is deployed in West Germany.
   Genscher is the driving force behind West Germany's recent
insistence that the negotiations be opened soon, in conflict with
NATO's position that such talks aimed at elimination of short-range
forces be made contingent on a balance of East-West conventional
arms.
   President Bush again rejected the Soviet call for short-range
negotiations after Secretary of State James A. Baker III, visited
Moscow on Wednesday.
   The question of how to proceed on the short-range missiles has
resulted in a situation where the Soviet and West German positions
are closer than those among the NATO allies.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, joining other alliance
leaders, said after his talks with Shevardnadze on Friday that
scrapping the weapons was out of the question as long as the Warsaw
Pact had superior numbers of conventional forces and tactical
nuclear weapons.
   But Kohl held firm on West Germany's position that negotiations
should be held promptly to reduce the short-range forces.
   Shevardnadze and Genscher also discussed plans for the June
12-15 visit to West Germany of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, although those details were not immediately disclosed.
   Bonn's insistence on short-range arms negotiations has split the
alliance before a crucial NATO summit scheduled at the end of May.
   Shevardnadze arrived in Bonn one day after Gorbachev announced a
new arms reduction initiative during a meeting with Baker.
   Gorbachev reiterated his call for negotiations on short-range
nuclear weapons, and also announced a proposal to withdraw 500
Soviet battlefield nuclear weapons from Europe unilaterally.
   Baker rejected the call for talks on short-range nuclear
arsenals, and said the other part of the initiative was a public
relations move.

   The warriors with painted
faces who flew south to reinforce U.S. troops in Panama said they
weren't looking for trouble but were ready if it came.
   One soldier in the 7th Infantry Division from Ford Ord, getting
aboard cargo jets Friday at this base in Fairfield, 35 miles
northeast of San Francisco, had been angered by what he knew of
recent events in the troubled Latin American nation.
   ``I watched the beating of that man (a Panamanian opposition
candidate) on television,'' said Greg Reith, a 24-year-old private
in the light infantry division's field artillery unit. ``It just
didn't seem right to me. I'd like to get my hand in there and see
if I couldn't do something about it.''
   Reith's personal message to Panamanian military leader Manuel
Noriega would be:
   ``Look out, because there's some light fighters coming to town.
He better keep his eyes open.''
   President George Bush ordered nearly 1,000 Fort Ord troops, and
about 1,000 from other bases, mobilized to help protect U.S.
citizens in Panama. The 7th Infantry Division is designed to travel
light so that it can be deployed swiftly anywhere in the world.
   In Louisiana, the first of more than 700 soldiers being sent to
Panama from the 5th Infantry Division at Fort Polk left today. Some
went by plane and the others headed by truck convoy to Beaumont,
Texas, where they were to board a cargo ship along with their
vehicles. The Louisiana contingent includes 20 women in non-combat
jobs such as mechanics or electronics repair.
   The Fort Ord troops, in combat gear and their faces splotched
with green camouflage paint, departed aboard C-5 and C-141 cargo
jets that screamed skyward throughout the day.
   Many of the division's soldiers refused to comment, saying they
had been instructed not to talk with the media.
   Among the handful who talked with reporters, most said they were
prepared to go, that this would be a good test of their training,
and that they were just doing their job.
   ``I'm not scared. I'm just curious what's going to happen. We
knew this was coming, we just didn't know when,'' said a
21-year-old soldier from southern California who declined to give
his name.
   Pfc. Daniel Grabowski, 20, of Cleveland, assigned to the field
artillery unit's operations center, leaned against a jeep as he
awaited his turn to load aboard a cargo jet.
   Grabowski, in the Army just a year, said this is his first
deployment outside the United States.
   ``The U.S. hasn't declared war. We're going down to protect
American citizens. There's not a whole lot to worry about,'' he
said.
   Brian Kimes, a 19-year-old artillery gunner from Denver, said
the deployment to Panama interrupted important personal plans.
   ``This means I won't be able to make my girlfriend's graduation
from high school,'' Kimes said. ``My leave was canceled by the
alert. I couldn't even call to let her know.''
   Cpl. Roger Little of Milwaukee echoed other soldiers' comments
that they knew little of the Panamanian situation.
   ``All I can do is what I'm told to do. The president says I've
got to go. There's got to be a good reason,'' he said.
   Little, 23, who is attached to the air defense artillery section
that operates the highly potent Stinger missile, acknowledged pride
in the weapon, adding: ``I hope we won't have to use it.''
   One soldier who refused to be interviewed was nevertheless in
good spirits. Mugging for television cameras, he smiled, waved and
said, ``Hi Mom!,'' then turned to his companions beaming and added,
``I've always wanted to do that.''

   North steps on the stage. It has been just seven days since a

   ``I never considered myself to be a hero,'' he says. ``I stand

   The words this evening, before a near-capacity audience of 3,000

Partners in Crime'' and ``Jail Ollie, Jail to the Chief,'' as well
as those who praise him as an American hero, a la Ronald Reagan and
George Bush.
   North speaks to mostly friendly audiences. In Kansas City, at a
feed industry association meeting, his talk on ``Commitment, Trust
and Family'' was part of a convention package. This evening's
audience paid $18.75 a ticket, this morning's $17.75.
   He speaks about the dangers to the young posed by drugs, about
meddling by Congress, about his faith in God and his absolute
belief that everything will turn out all right for him back ``at
that sad swamp along the Potomac.'' The harshest words are reserved
for the news media, especially CBS and Dan Rather.
   ``We have been told by the media, those great thinkers, that
Mickey Gorbachev's a good guy,'' he says at one point. ``The
American people are fairer and wiser than perhaps CBS and the
Washington Post would have us believe,'' he says at another.
   North is polished and impassioned, not much different from the
way he testified before Congress two years ago and at his trial,
which ended May 4 with guilty verdicts on three charges and
acquittals on nine.
   He has notes, but only glances at them and rambles from Thomas
Jefferson to Manuel Noriega to his belief in Family and God. The
speech is sprinkled with wit, some spontaneous, some manufactured.
   In Kansas City, when the introducer turned to the wrong side of
the stage to welcome him, North's first words were, ``I didn't mean
to sneak up behind you, but I have a reputation to uphold.''
   His podium here was in a theater-in-the-round and the stage made
one complete circuit every 13 minutes. ``I noticed I'm going to the
left,'' said North. ``It maybe the only time in my life I'm turning
left.''
   He said he would prefer being introduced simply as the husband
of one and the father of four. ``I got that backward a couple of
weeks ago,'' he said, and the audiences in Missouri laughed and so
did the Ohioans. ``But,'' he said, ``I was in San Francisco and
nobody noticed.''
   When a young questioner said the only news out of the White
House since George Bush moved in concerned the presidential
puppies, North replied: ``I didn't have anything to do with the
puppies. Nor did I have anything to do with Millie being pregnant.''
   Rex Runyon, a vice president at the American Feed Industries
Association, said North was booked last year for $25,000. He called
North ``the hottest property on the public-speaking circuit today.''
   Indeed, he said, after word got out about the North engagement
some people paid the $500 non-member convention fee just to hear
North.
   North himself says, ``I am reluctantly a man of great
visibility.'' And, ``I do not stand before you today and ask you to
endorse what I did or failed to do.''
   North says he has has been investigated more than any Mafia
figure and refers to himself as ``one who has been blamed for
everything from the greenhouse effect to the horrible rain showers
we had last week in Washington.''
   He makes no bones about his conservative views:
   _``The government has a responsibility to promote the general
welfare, not to provide welfare to the general public.''
   _``We have now an imperial Congress trying to usurp the
presidency.''
   _``I remain deeply skeptical about Gorbachev. Today in the
Soviet Union you can criticize former dictators but you can't
criticize the present one ... I am an unrepentant anti-communist. I
hope I'm not one of the last.''
   _``We have a Congress totally opposed to giving the Nicaraguan
freedom fighters anything but Band-Aids and doughnuts ... If we are
going to have a constitutional amendment that limits the term of
the president of the United States, we ought to have an amendment
that limits the terms of Congress.''
   That last line gets applause every time. North builds up to it
by deploring ``electoral gridlock'' because 98 percent of
congressmen seeking another term win it. ``More people are returned
on a regular basis than are returned to the Politburo in the Soviet
Union,'' he says.
   He sees drugs and voter apathy as America's greatest dangers.
And he urges greater support for police officers who are
``outgunned, outpaid and outraced.''
   North's evening appearance here lasted more than two hours, more
than half of the time spent answering questions.
   What constitutes leadership? ``The political leaders of this
nation ought to be people who don't simply wet their fingers in
their mouth and test the wind.''
   It is obvious that many in the audience think that North should
be one of those leaders.
   ``Mr. North, I salute you,'' said one man. ``You had a set of
something we all know about. You had the guts to stand up to
Congress. Your answers were better than the questions those stupid
congressmen asked. Please give us a chance to put an X behind your
name.''
   North fields that one. ``If I was so damn smart I wouldn't be in
so much trouble.''
   Later he returns to the theme. ``Someone who incurred the wrath
of Daniel Ortega, Moammar Gadhafi, Abu Nidal and Dan Rather must
have done something right.''
   He tells the audience his family has endured because of its
belief in God.
   ``I honestly believe the good Lord has a plan for all of us ...
it's all going to end well.''
   North speaks of the enormous legal expenses that have piled up _
his bills during the trial have been estimated at $380,000 a month
_ but he does not say whether his speaking fees go to lower that
debt.
   A woman asked where she can contribute money. North replied that
the North Defense Trust established by his former U.S. Naval
Academy classmates ``is the only one that has my endorsement and
not a penny goes to me personally.''
   He answers questions until the master of ceremonies calls a
halt. North says goodbye with the Marine motto: ``Semper Fidelis''
_ Always Faithful.
   Again there is a standing ovation. North's two bodyguards rush
down and lead him out of the theater. And North heads for his
chartered jet and back to the ``sad swamp.''

<HEAD>Quake Deaths Blamed on Building, Criminal Investigation Under Way</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Politburo commission blamed most of the 25,000
deaths in Armenia's earthquake on shoddy construction and turned
its findings over to prosecutors to file criminal charges, Tass
said Saturday.
   ``The catastrophic consequences of the earthquake in Armenia are
explained above all by the low quality of the building and assembly
work, by the inadmissible violation of design norms and the
strength of underground tremors,'' the official news agency
reported.
   ``There would have been no such huge number of human casualties
if the established standards and regulations at all stages of
construction, from design to assembly, were observed,'' it said.
   The report ended an investigation that began immediately after
the Dec. 7, 1988 earthquake, which measured 6.9 on the Richter
scale and destroyed Leninakan, Spitak, Kirovakan and other cities
of northern Armenia. The Politburo commission was headed by Premier
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov.
   The commission turned its findings and materials over to the
Procurator General's office ``to file criminal charges and bring
those responsible to account,'' Tass said.
   Many of the structures that fell in the earthquake were newly
constructed multistory apartment buildings, which are common
throughout the Soviet Union. They collapsed in heaps of rubble,
trapping their inhabitants. About 500,000 people were left homeless.
   Many older buildings with fewer stories remained standing.
   The Soviet Union is faced with an acute housing shortage and has
turned to construction of identical prefabricated blocks throughout
the country.
   Ryzhkov traveled to Armenia immediately after the earthquake. As
early as mid-December, he said that poor housing construction was a
likely cause of the high number of deaths. The commission report
confirmed that suspicion.
   It said the poor construction was aggravated by a lowering of
seismic standards in the quake-prone region in 1978.
   Tass gave no indication how widespread the criminal
investigation would be, nor how many people would be prosecuted.
   Officials have said it will cost billions of dollars to rebuild
the Armenian cities, but they have pledged to do it within two
years and under strict standards designed to prevent a repeat of
the disaster.
   The commission reported that $400 million of construction work
was done in the quake area through April.
   But it reported complacency and lack of coordination in supply
and construction. Workers are only able to unload 1,600 of the
2,000 rail cars that arrive daily in Armenia with building
supplies, it said.

<HEAD>Is Wright Losing Fight For Public Support? ^An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As House Speaker Jim Wright wages a
painstaking legal battle against ethics accusations, there is a
growing feeling among his colleagues that the larger war for public
opinion is slipping away.
   While Wright's eight-lawyer defense team filed a series of
motions contesting the formal case against Wright last week, the
speaker was battered by a series of reports and events _ including
the resignation of a top aide over the aide's criminal past _ that
kept him publicly on the defensive.
   The motions ``have the look of a formal, high-risk,
all-cards-on-the-table strategy,'' said one Wright supporter, Rep.
Pat Williams, D-Mont. But he noted a ``significant'' change in
perceptions of Wright's standing among colleagues: ``There's a new
gloomy, dark feeling among the speaker's supporters.''
   One participant in a recent strategy meeting in Wright's office
likened the atmosphere to what it must have been like inside the
Nixon White House during Watergate, according to two sources who
were there.
   Many _ and not just the speaker's supporters _ are bitter about
what they see as the unfairness of a process that holds Wright to a
new and tougher behavior standard than the one that prevailed when
many of the alleged rules violations occurred. But few deny the
reality of the political damage already done.
   ``The daily revelations are not helpful,'' said Rep. Jim
Slattery, D-Kan. ``There's a two-front war being waged here. One is
the technical legal war, and the other is the public relations war.
It would be a good idea to win both. It's absolutely essential that
you have a clear victory in one or the other.''
   Two other Midwestern Democrats from different states, who a few
weeks ago believed Wright might be able to survive as speaker, now
have changed their minds. ``He should step down. This hurts
everybody,'' said one, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
``He can survive the ethics question, but I don't think he can
survive the political question.''
   Those who have come to such a conclusion are not willing to be
quoted by name, fearing reprisals or being seen as disloyal.
   One reason for the changing mood is that lawmakers have grown
weary of the public's perception of Congress as preoccupied with
its own internal problems. Serious public policy problems, such as
the federal budget deficit, are not getting the attention they
deserve, they contend.
   Wright's potential problems have grown faster than his legal
team, which he bolstered last week with the addition of Houston
trial lawyer Stephen Susman, senior adviser Clark Clifford and
several associates.
   On Thursday, John Mack, one of the speaker's most able and
trusted senior aides, resigned amid new reports about his
conviction 16 years ago for a brutal attack on a woman.
   Mack said in a statement he did not want to become an additional
burden to Wright, but the resignation raised the profile of an
matter with greater emotional content than many of the ethics
charges surrounding the speaker. ``It tended to personalize the
speaker's problems,'' said Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan.
   Since the ethics committee formally charged Wright on April 17
with 69 instances of violating House rules, new problems have
surfaced each week:
   _ Former employees of the Pacific Institute, a Seattle, Wash.,
firm that markets motivational programs, have questioned whether
Wright's wife Betty did any work to earn the $36,000 salary she was
paid from 1984 until the ethics probe opened last June. Wright's
office issued a statement last week from company chairman Louis E.
Tice asserting that ``Mrs. Wright's performance of her assigned
duties was excellent.''
   _ The committee continues to look into a lucrative Texas gas
drilling venture that yielded a quick $170,000 profit for Wright
last year, and plans this week to question Fort Worth lawyer Tom
Law, the administrator of Wright's blind trust.
   _ News stories have raised questions about whether Wright
received preferential treatment in his unsuccessful $100,000
investment in a Texas nursing home venture, receiving dividends and
interest payments unavailable to other investors. Wright also is
reported to have taken unreimbursed plane rides on the company's
aircraft, but the speaker said he can recall no such rides.
   _ The Justice Department has expressed renewed interest in
Wright's dealings, and said this week it will review the evidence
for possible criminal violations once the House ethics case runs
its course.
   One member of Wright's team, Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.,
defended the speaker's emphasis on his legal defense. ``That has
always been the speaker's strongest position. The principle
struggle now is to prevail legally. The politics will follow.''
   The lawyers soon will make oral arguments on their crucial
motion to dismiss the most serious charges, probably the week of
May 22.
   In making his assessment, Torricelli conceded a point that only
underlines Wright's troubles: that House rules are out of date with
current public expectations. ``Time has passed, circumstances have
changed and ethical standards have appropriately risen,'' he said.
   Implicit in that statement is that Wright's dealings _ selling
his books in bulk to interest groups and accepting financial
benefits from a Fort Worth friend _ while meeting the letter of the
rules, are out of step with Washington's new, tougher ethical
climate.
   ``There's such a tremendous shifting sand of ethical standards
right now that nobody's really clear on what is ethical and what is
not,'' Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer specializing in ethics,
said in a recent speech to lobbyists. ``Ethical mores in Washington
change almost daily. You have to keep ahead of the curve.''

<TEXT>
   Moslem insurgents today claimed about
30,000 guerrillas are massing for an attack on communist-held
Kabul, the Afghan capital, in the near future.
   It lent credence to earlier predictions by guerrilla leaders and
foreign observers that an assault might occur in mid-May, following
the spring thaw and the end last weekend of Ramadan, the Moslem
holy month.
   ``About 30,000 (guerrilla) forces will launch a common attack on
Kabul city very soon,'' the insurgents' Afghan News Agency quoted a
guerrilla commander, Mohammad Nasir, as saying.
   Neither the agency nor other guerrilla sources would specify the
date of the assault.
   President Najib has insisted that his forces are strong enough
to withstand a guerrilla onslaught.
   Kabul, a city of about 2 million inhabitants 110 miles west of
the Pakistan border, is protected by at least three security rings
built by Soviet forces, who for nine years intervened on the
government side.
   Moscow continues to arm the Kabul government although the last
Red Army soldiers withdrew from Afghanistan on Feb. 15.
   The ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan seized power
in a 1978 military coup, sparking the Moslem insurgency whose aim
is to establish an Islamic republic.
   The guerrillas, backed mainly by Pakistan and the United States,
have tried since March to take the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad
without success.

<HEAD>Protesters March to Denounce Death of Radical Student</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Riot police wielding truncheons and
shields beat back thousands of protesters who gathered on Saturday
to protest the death of a radical student.
   About 4,000 police clashed with protesters who tried to march to
the provincial government headquarters.
   ``Down with murder and torture,'' protesters chanted. Some
troops were beaten to the ground by protesters armed with bamboo
sticks. The crowd burned helmets and shields seized from police.
   Police did not stop the estimated 10,000 people from holding a
rally in a square in front of the government building, even though
fighting broke out several times.
   Dissident leaders called for the overthrow of President Roh
Tae-woo's government as the protesters cheered and clapped,
shouting ``Down with Roh Tae-woo'' and ``End the military
dictatorship.''
   Dissident groups organized the march to denounce the death of
the radical student, Lee Chul-kyu, whose body was found Wednesday
in a reservoir near Kwangju, about 170 miles south of Seoul.
   Dissidents claimed at a rally at Chonnam University earlier
Saturday that Lee was tortured to death by police interrogators.
Police denied any involvement in the death. The government is
conducting an investigation.
   ``This barbarous act was committed by the suppressive security
forces to suppress the national democratic movement,'' a dissident
leader told the estimated 15,000 people at the university rally.
   Speakers called for nationwide protests to topple Roh and expel
the 43,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea under a mutual defense
pact. They claim Roh and the United States are scheming to impose
military rule on the country.
   ``Roh is the puppet of the U.S. imperialists,'' a student leader
said. ``Let's fight until we drive out Roh and the Yankees.''
   Thousands of people then marched out of the campus and were
blocked by riot police. Scuffles broke out as the protesters tried
to force their way through human barricades.
   Several elderly protesters beat troopers with walking sticks and
pounded their fists against police armored vans blocking the roads.
``Kill Roh Tae-woo!'' an old man screamed.
   Many marchers then broke away into side streets, reached the
city center and assembled outside the provincial government
headquarters for a second rally.
   Police reported many minor injuries but said there were no
arrests.
   South Korea has been hit by a wave of anti-government protests
and strikes in recent months. Dissident groups are calling for the
overthrow of Roh, a former general elected in late 1987.
   Dissidents pledged to end violent protests after six riot police
were killed May 3 in a clash with radical students. But the
dissidents have not renounced their campaign to topple Roh.
   Authorities fear Lee's death could provoke unrest in Kwangju,
since it occurred near Thursday's anniversary of the May 18, 1980,
Kwangju uprising in which at least 192 people were killed. Many
residents claim Roh is one of those responsible for the bloody
suppression of the uprising.
   The dissidents have little public support because of their
violent tactics and extremism. Roh ordered a major crackdown on
dissidents after the death of the six riot police.

   Authorites on Saturday arrested a
policeman who they said went berserk after a colleague kidded him
about losing a girlfriend, killing three co-workers and injuring
five during a gun-and-grenade spree.
   Cpl. Hung Yen-chin, 21, put up no resistance when he was
arrested shortly before dawn in the Taipei suburb of Hsintien, near
the police training center where the ramapage occurred, police said.
   Hung was working as a guard at the training center when Sgt.
Huang Teh-yi arrived to relieve him, then teased Hung about losing
his girlfriend, police said.
   Hung shot and killed Huang, then lobbed two hand grenades into a
barracks nearby and went on a shooting spree, police said, speaking
on condition of anonymity. Two other police officers were killed
and five were hurt.
   Hung fled with his M-16 rifle, three hand grenades and 200
rounds of ammunition. Police said 1,000 riot troops joined the
chase before Hung was finally arrested.
   Officials said Hung would be court-martialed and could be
sentenced to death if convicted.

   Seventeen women, all black and most of them crack
addicts and prostitutes, have died mysteriously in the same area
since 1986. There have been no signs of violence, no signs of
illness _ nothing to suggest who or what may have killed them.
   Was it a serial killer who knows how to hide signs of violence?
A deadly new form of drug abuse? Investigators don't know.
   Last week, after a new wave of publicity, Dade County Medical
Examiner Joseph Davis officially declared the cases homicides. But
Davis acknowledges that the cause of death remains unknown, and
investigators say they are as frustrated as before.
   ``If, in fact, there is a killer or killers out there, or if
it's caused by crack cocaine, we just don't know yet,'' says John
Farrell, chief of the headquarters division of detectives for
Metro-Dade police. ``We consider them open cases and we're
investigating them as if they were homicides.''
   FBI behavioral scientists and experts from the national Centers
for Disease Control in Atlanta have been called in by local
authorities to study the sparse data. Their reports are not
complete.
   Farrell notes that there is not even a proven link among the
deaths, which began in September 1986. However, there is a pattern.
   The bodies of all but one of the women were found in a narrow,
predominantly black section of Miami and an adjoining,
unincorporated area of Dade County. They were lying in overgrown
vacant lots, abandoned houses or back alleys. The victims' skirts
were up or pants down, indicating recent sexual activity. All but
two had traces of cocaine in their blood. Most were known as
willing to trade sex for crack money.
   None, however, showed any signs of trauma or violence, and the
cause of death is listed as unknown. The latest known victim, Peggy
Gooden, 27, was discovered April 2.
   ``The geographic distribution of these cases lends support to a
presumption of probable homicide based on ... the absence of other
proven alternatives at this time,'' Davis said.
   There are several theories on what is killing the women, but
there are problems with each.
   If a serial killer is at work, he has gone to great lengths to
hide his method of killing the women. The working assumption is
that the killer would somehow strangle or smother them _ a
difficult cause of death to establish.
   And police say it strains credulity that the women would quietly
suffocate without screaming, fighting or resisting enough to show
signs of trauma.
   The serial killer theory has a different problem. There are no
reports from other street people of suspects, and no close escapes
matching the circumstances of the deaths.
   Dr. Lee Hearn, chief toxicologist for the medical examiner's
office, says the bodies were even checked for cyanide, but no
traces were found. People who are poisoned generally show signs of
illness before their deaths, and none of the women did.
   That leaves the possibility of a previously unknown kind of
chemical reaction in which small amounts of cocaine _ perhaps
coupled with genetic factors, a rundown physical condition or
sexual stimulation _ resulted in sudden death.
   But that theory too has holes, Hearn notes. Why isn't the same
phenomenon occurring outside this narrow area, in New York, Los
Angeles or even neighboring Fort Lauderdale? And why is it
affecting only black women? There are plenty of white crack addicts
as well.
   Two of the women had no cocaine at all in their bloodstreams,
Hearn notes, although it is always possible that their cases are
unrelated to the rest.
   One possible explanation for the narrow geographical
distribution of the deaths could be a single dealer distributing
crack that is cut with a deadly chemical. But officers sent out
into the area to buy samples have found nothing unusual. Hearn says
tests didn't disclose any such toxic agent.
   ``We just don't know what's killing them,'' Farrell says. ``And
the people in the street are just as confused as we are. Some think
it's a killer, and some think it's the crack. But we'll keep on
investigating, and we'll find an answer.''

   When Soviet and Chinese leaders last met in
Beijing, Nikita Khrushchev hurried out of town with a dour look on
his face, and summitry between the communist giants was put on hold
for three decades.
   A new Kremlin chief is coming to town Monday, and better results
are expected.
   Chinese analysts believe President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will
find common ground with Deng Xiaoping, the 84-year-old leader who
has transformed China with market-oriented policies that
resurrected the crippled economy.
   ``The two are reformers,'' said Xing Shugang, an expert on
Soviet matters at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ``They
ought to have a common language.''
   Gorbachev also will meet Communist Party chairman Zhao Ziyang,
who is closely identified with the economic refoms, and Premier Li
Peng, who studied engineering in the Soviet Union.
   A Western diplomat said privately that Gorbachev's meeting with
Zhao might go particularly well because both ``are men of vision''
under pressure for pursuing risky reforms.
   Amicable meetings would go far to erase unpleasant memories of
the frosty summit of September 1959 between Khrushchev and Mao
Tse-tung, whose relationship was marked by vast ideological
differences and mutual distrust.
   By the end of that September meeting, the Chinese-Soviet rift
was out in the open. ``Khrushchev wasn't wearing a smile'' as he
left for Moscow, recalled Zhu Ruizhen, a Russian-language
interpreter for Mao.
   Personal friction aggravated the difficulties between the two
leaders.
   ``Khrushchev and Mao never got along,'' said a Foreign Ministry
official who spent several years in the Chinese Embassy in Moscow.
``Mao was introverted and Khrushchev was very flashy. That
contributed to the problem.''
   Other Chinese scholars said Mao, who avidly studied history and
wrote lengthy political essays and esoteric poetry, regarded
Khrushchev as uncultured.
   Gorbachev has shown an ability to impress and was able to
establish good working rapport with Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher of Britain and former President Ronald Reagan.
   ``We think Gorbachev will be more adept at handling our
leaders'' than Khrushchev, said the ministry official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``He has many advisers who were present
during the last summit. They know the problems and they understand
China's need for certain things.
   ``Our leaders want a certain measure of respect. Deng Xiaoping
is an old revolutionary, and we believe Gorbachev will treat him as
such.''
   Xing, the Sovietologist, said good personal chemistry is
important because Gorbachev and Deng ``play the most important
policy-making roles in the two countries.''

   Teen-age girls who are pregnant or have
children are not getting the support they need to complete their
educations and are likely to experience discrimination at their
schools, a new survey indicates.
   ``Few schools have clear policies about how to treat pregnant
and parenting students,'' authors Margaret Nash and Margaret Dunkle
of the Equality Center write in a report called ``The Need for a
Warming Trend.''
   ``Most schools fail the Title IX test,'' the authors add,
referring to the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in
schools that receive federal aid.
   The findings are based on a survey completed by administrators,
teachers or counselors at a dozen diverse schools in eight states.
They reflect the results of two earlier studies and, according to
experts in the field, the general school climate for students who
have or expect children.
   Pregnancy is far and away the leading cause of female dropouts.
At least 40,000 girls quit school each year because they are
pregnant, according to the Center for Population Options.
   The report by the Equality Center, a Washington-based nonprofit
research group, said these girls are often overlooked in
discussions of at-risk students and dropout prevention programs.
   ``Making the school environment more hospitable for these female
students _ and for teen-age fathers _ can make a significant dent
in dropout statistics, as well as provide these young parents with
the education they and their families need,'' the authors wrote.
   The survey responses revealed Title IX violations at nine of the
12 schools, with several having multiple violations.
   Among the violations were not allowing absences from school for
prenatal or postnatal care or problems associated with pregnancy,
requiring pregnant students but not students with other medical
conditions to have a doctor's certification to stay in school and
not permitting enough leave to recover from pregnancy and birth.
   All schools said pregnant and parenting students could be club
members, be on the ballot for ``Class Favorites'' and participate
in graduation ceremonies. But at one of the schools, they are not
always allowed to run for student government, be club or class
officers, or run for prom or homecoming queen or court.
   Other schools did not allow the students to be eligible for
scholarships, financial aid and prizes on the same basis as other
students and did not allow them to participate in sports or
athletics programs although there was no medical reason to exclude
them.
   The schools did comply with some important requirements, the
survey found. ``None of the schools use pregnancy or parenting as a
reason to expel or suspend students,'' the authors said. ``Further,
none required that these students enroll in a special program or
school, or have home instruction, rather than stay in regular
classes.''
   But the climate remains chilly, the authors said. Most dropout
prevention efforts do not focus on pregnancy and parenting; most
schools do not keep attendance, dropout or enrollment statistics on
pregnant or parenting teens; and many pregnant girls simply
disappear before graduation.
   All but one school in the survey reported that lack of adequate
child care makes it very hard for teen mothers to stay in school.
One school had an on-site toddler center but none of the schools
had on-site infant care _ the hardest kind of care to find and the
most critical in terms of getting a mother back into the classroom
before she drifts away permanently.
   The survey also found that two-thirds of the schools have
someone available to tell pregnant girls about health services and
half of them have someone who can tell the girls about social
services such as welfare, food stamps, nutrition programs and child
care. But only a minority routinely refer girls to community
agencies and some schools did not view coordination as their
responsibility.
   The neglect appears to stem from a feeling that ``they brought
this on themselves'' and the fact that girls who become pregnant
and parents usually are not the best students, experts say.
   ``They tend to be marginal students,'' said Karen Pittman,
director of adolescent pregnancy prevention at the Children's
Defense Fund. ``They are the kids who are not noticed. A lot are
left to just quietly slide.''
   She and others said the results of the Equality Center survey,
though based on a small sample, are representative of what is
happening at schools across the country.
   ``You can generalize from that sample,'' said Ann M. Wilson, a
social work professor at Rutgers University and a board member of
the National Organization on Adolescent Pregnancy and Parenting.
For example, she said, there are only three school-based day care
sites in New Jersey's 611 school districts.
   Wilson, Pittman and Rebecca Stone of the Center for Population
Options stressed that schools vary widely in what they offer to
pregnant and parenting students. But Pittman said of the survey:
``What they're reporting is generally true and probably true
roughly in the proportions that it's being reported.''
   Schools in the survey were Benito Juarez High School in Chicago;
Thibodaux High School in Thibodaux, La.; Natchitoches Parish in
Natchitoches, La.; Bladensburg High School in Bladensburg, Md.;
Gaithersburg Junior High School in Gaithersburg, Md.; Southern
Middle School in Lusby, Md.; North Caroline High School in Ridgely,
Md.; Minuteman Vocational Technical High School in Lexington,
Mass.; White Fish High School in White Fish, Mont.; Guiderland
Central High School in Guiderland Center, N.Y.; Cleveland High
School in Portland, Ore.; and Stevens Point High School in Stevens
Point, Wis.

   Rival fans at an soccer game today spilled onto
the field and began fighting, and an ambulance spokesman said 11
people were hospitalized.
   Officials said none of the injuries was serious. It was the
first significant incident of crowd violence in England since 95
fans died in the Sheffield stadium crush on April 15.
   Fans of Birmingham City spilled onto the field after Crystal
Palace took a 1-0 lead. They were confronted by Crystal Palace
supporters and fought on the field, officials said.
   The English Soccer League game was stopped immediately. Referee
Mike Bodenham ordered the players off the field as seven mounted
police came on to restore order.
   An ambulance spokesman said 11 people were taken to Mayday
Hospital in south London and said there had not been any report of
serious injuries. Four ambulances were sent to Selhurst Park to
take away injured fans.
   A reporter for the London Broadcasting Co. at the game said the
injuries included broken ribs and a gash on one person's head.
   A police spokeswoman said some people had been arrested but did
not give a specific number.
   The game was restarted after the incident.
   Officials said there were about 16,000 fans at the game.
   The police presence at many English soccer matches has been
increased since the stadium crush at a Football Association Cup
semifinal at Sheffield. Overcrowding in the stands led to the fatal
crush of fans.

<HEAD>Government Moves to Ban Chemical Alar from Apples and Other Foods</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency announced
Saturday steps to ban using the growth regulating chemical Alar on
apples and other foods but said final action is not likely for at
least 18 months.
   Alar is used by some apple growers and became the center of
controversy recently when a private study cited it as being
particularly harmful to children, who eat large amounts of apple
products.
   The uproar prompted some school districts to stop serving apples
and in some cases has has caused parents to stop using them,
despite assurances from the EPA and the growers themselves.
   The EPA until recently estimated that only about 4 percent of
the apples continue to be exposed to Alar, but the agency said
Saturday that recent findings have caused them to increase that
estimate. The EPA now estimates that as many as 15 percent of last
year's crop may have been sprayed with Alar.
   The EPA had said in February that it would begin regulatory
action aimed at Alar and has urged that the chemical, technically
called daminozide, be voluntarily taken off the market because it
has been found to cause cancer in test animals.
   Alar's manufacturer, Uniroyal Chemical Co., has disputed the
health claims and continued to sell the chemical, which keeps
apples on trees longer and provides longer shelf life.
   Earlier this week a trade group that represents processors of
apple products urged the EPA to announce a formal regulatory action
to ban the product in hopes of dissuading growers from using it.
   Many food processors claim that checks are made for Alar and
apples containing the chemical are not used in products such as
apple sauce and juice. Consumers have not been convinced, however,
and the recent concerns about the chemical have caused a drop in
apple product sales of as much as 20 percent, according to the
Processed Apples Institute.
   Jack Moore, acting deputy administrator, said the EPA has
proposed ordering Alar off the market because it ``over a lifetime
(it) poses unreasonable risks to the public.''
   Moore reiterated, as he did in February when announcing the
agency's intention to ban the chemical, that the health risk is not
great enough to warrant an emergency ban, which could go into
effect immediately.
   ``I want to emphasize that, based on our current estimates, the
short-term risks of eating food treated with daminozide are not
significant and do not pose an imminent or major public-health
threat,'' said Moore in a statement.
   The Agriculture Department and the Food and Drug Administration
also have pronounced apples safe for consumption even though some
may contain Alar.
   The EPA began a review of Alar in 1984 and two years later
proposed taking it off the market after it was found to have caused
cancer in test animals. Those findings were challenged, however,
and the agency directed additional studies.
   The studies have yet to be completed, but Moore said preliminary
evidence is clear enough to warrant rulemaking procedures that
eventually will direct Alar not be used. A final ban is not
expected for nearly 18 months and could take twice that long if the
action is challenged, EPA officials said.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union today began a
partial withdrawal of soldiers and tanks stationed in
Czechoslovakia. It was the first pullout of permanent Soviet forces
since a 1968 invasion to crush Communist-led reform.
   A 6{-mile column of Soviet army vehicles headed home from the
north Moravian city of Olomouc, according to state-run media. A
brief ceremony sponsored by local Communist Party officials marked
the departure. The reports did not say how many soldiers and tanks
were in the procession.
   The partial withdrawal of Soviet soldiers was announced in
December by Mikhail S. Gorbachev as part of an overall plan to cut
the Red Army by half a million men by 1991.
   Gorbachev's promised withdrawal of 50,000 Soviet troops and
5,000 tanks from East Germany, Hungary and Czechoslovakia by 1991
began last month with the much publicized departure of 31 T-64
tanks from a base in southern Hungary. Soviet troops and tanks have
also begun to leave East Germany.
   Until Alexander Dubcek launched the short-lived ``Prague
Spring'' reforms in 1968, the Kremlin had no troops or tanks
permanently stationed in Czechoslovakia.
   Soviet and other Warsaw Pact troops and tanks first entered the
country for lengthy maneuvers in mid-1968 in a sign of increasing
nervousness among Czechoslovakia's Communist allies over Dubcek's
reforms.
   The Warsaw Pact forces withdrew to just over the Czechoslovak
border in July 1968, but returned Aug. 20. The invasion crushed
reforms and led to the expulsion of Dubcek and nearly 500,000
others from the Communist Party.
   According to Western estimates, the Soviets have about 80,000
soldiers in Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovak chief of staff, Gen.
Miroslav Vacek, said in February the Soviets will withdraw 5,300
soldiers, 708 tanks and 20 planes by the end of 1990. Four
battalions numbering some 1,500 men will be withdrawn this year.

   Authorities searching through tons
of debris found a 24-year-old man alive more than 14 hours after a
runaway freight train jumped its tracks at 90 mph and slammed into
a row of houses, killing four.
   Chris Shaw was half-asleep in his home Friday when the
out-of-control train catapulted off a curve. Locomotives and
freight cars loaded with unprocessed potash were sent crashing into
11 houses, including his.
   He was found shortly before 9 p.m. and spoke to rescuers who fed
him oxygen through a tube and encouraged him throughout the 1{-hour
rescue operation.
   ``I would never have believed that this individual could have
survived where he was,'' said a rescue coordinator, whose name was
not immediately available. ``He had major train parts against his
body.''
   The body of the fourth victim of the crash, the brakeman, was
found early today.
   Shaw apparently was able to survive after metal debris formed a
cave, creating an air pocket with enough oxygen to sustain him,
said Gene Brooks, a rescue supervisor.
   ``I'm glad my son is out of the house,'' said his mother,
Maryann Shaw. ``I was so confused. I told him that his mama was
outside and I was out here for him.''
   He suffered a broken right leg, said Joy Flint, a nursing
supervisor at San Bernardino County hospital. Shaw was in serious
condition early today.
   ``Christopher is awake and alert and in good spirits,'' Mrs.
Flint added.
   The Southern Pacific freight apparently lost its brakes near the
top of the 4,190-foot Cajon Pass and careened down the flank of the
San Bernardino Mountains, said Southern Pacific spokesman Jim
Loveland.
   During their desperate plunge, the five-man crew radioed that
they were out of control. Then the train, two-thirds of a mile
long, plowed into a modest neighborhood of single-story homes about
7:40 a.m in San Bernardino, about 60 miles east of Los Angeles.
   Killed were conductor Everett S. Crown, 36; brakeman Allan
Reiss, 44; and Jason Thompson, 9, and Tyson White, 7, stepbrothers
whose home was flattened by cars of the 3,470-foot-long train.
   Nancy Fricks said her grandson, Daniel Sweeney, 9, who lives
with her, watched as the body of a little boy, a school chum of
Daniel's, was carried away. ``He saw them taking the body out under
a blanket and he started crying,'' Ms. Fricks said.
   Dogs used to search for victims of the 1985 Mexico City
earthquake were flown in from northern California to help find
Reiss, whose body was discovered about 2:30 a.m. today.
   Scores of rescuers worked to free Shaw. His house was shattered
and he was buried under debris and tons of the sandlike potash.
   Ms. Shaw said her son had been drowsy and was lying in bed in a
front bedroom. ``I knocked on the door and told him to remember to
shut everything off because he has a habit of leaving the iron
on,'' she said.
   After the crash, she stared at a 25-foot tower of wreckage
covering the house. Only the mailbox was still standing.
   Hospitals in the area reported treating at least eight people
for varying injuries, including engineer Frank W. Holland, 34, who
was in serious and stable condition late Friday suffering from
fractured ribs, bruises and cuts, said Jo Coffey, a nursing
supervisor at St. Bernardine's Hospital.
   The other crew members who suffered minor injuries were engineer
Larry Hill, 42, and brakeman Robert Waterbury, 57.
   One of the train's five crew members radioed to a dispatcher in
Los Angeles that the train was out of control, Loveland said. The
Mayday call was received by the dispatcher shortly before 7:30 a.m.
   The 69-car freight had four engines in front and two ``helper
engines'' in back. The rear engines had applied full brakes.
   The National Transportation Safety Board will coordinate
investigation of the crash.
   Police Sgt. Dan Hernandez said six houses were destroyed, one
had major damage and four had minor damage. Property damage was
estimated at $600,000.
   Red Cross spokeswoman Kim Schwartz said a shelter had been set
up at the Inland Job Corps Center and 237 people had been fed and
housed at area hotels Friday night.
   ``The train was all over the place. It looked like a toy in a
sandbox,'' said eyewitness Al Dorame. ``It was just everywhere _ in
people's yards. Pieces of the axles were in people's yards. Sand
covered a whole house. Some of the people thought it was an
earthquake.''
   Crews pumped 11,000 gallons of diesel fuel from overturned
engines to prevent an explosion.

<HEAD>Leningrad Reformers Try To Oust Politburo Member</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LENINGRAD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reformers in the nation's second-largest city
have begun a grass-roots campaign to oust Leningrad's Communist
Party chief from the ruling Politburo, a move that would have been
unthinkable a few years ago.
   The reformers defeated 12 local party leaders during March
elections for the new Soviet legislature and now are seeking to
remove those leaders from their regular Communist Party posts, the
reformers say.
   The prime target is Yuri F. Solovyov, Leningrad party chief and
a member of the Politburo.
   Pyotr Filippov, a leader of the recall movement, said his group
is working through small Communist Party groups to demand
Solovyov's replacement.
   ``What's important is that change is coming from below,'' said
Filippov.
   Solovyev is the highest ranking of the approximately three dozen
party officials nationwide who lost in the March 26 elections to
the Congress of People's deputies.
   The defeats in the nation's first multi-candidate elections were
an embarrassing blow to the Communist Party.
   Filippov said he believed there is support now among Leningrad
party members to hold a special conference on the removal of
Solovyov as party chief and the ouster of other old-line leaders.
One-third of the party members must agree before such a conference
can be held.
   Filippov said Solovyov's ouster as Leningrad party chief likely
would persuade the Politburo to remove him from that elite body.
   Membership on the Politburo is determined by the 20 members and
by the larger Central Committee of top-level Communists.
   Solovyov's loss in the Congress of People's Deputies was
particularly humiliating because he failed to to win 50 percent of
the vote, even though he had no opponent.
   After his defeat, Solovyov complained bitterly at the Communist
Party Central Committee plenary meeting in Moscow that the party
had lost its unity.
   That earned him sharp criticism from Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, who supports greater openness in Soviet affairs.
   Elections for the seat Solovyov sought and for 197 other
unfilled seats in Congress of People's Deputies seats are to be
held Sunday. The seats still open are those in which no candidate
received more than 50 percent of the vote during the March
balloting.
   Many of the reformers are running for Leningrad's four remaining
seats in the new legislature.
   Already, several Communist Party organizations in Leningrad have
passed resolutions demanding the special conference to replace the
Leningrad leadership, said Marina Salye, a party member and
candidate in Sunday's election.
   She said reformers will intensify the fight for a special party
conference as soon as the current election is completed.
   ``Moscow said it's an internal affair in Leningrad,'' Filippov
said. He said he considers that a green light for the sort of
grass-roots political action mentioned by Gorbachev.
   But speculation persists that Moscow plans to pre-empt the local
uprising by appointing an outsider to Solovyov's post, said a
Western diplomat who declined to be named.
   Most of the representatives to the Congress of People's Deputies
were elected from districts based on geography. Another 750 seats
were reserved for representatives from the Communist Party, trade
unions and social and professional groups.
   The new congress is to open on May 25.

   The zonies and zdonks are sure bets, but
the aoudads were nothing but trouble, says a man who wants to make
a business out of exotic livestock.
   ``Believe me, away from here it's a good business. I just hope
to make it a good business here,'' said farmer Glawson Gantt.
   Gantt makes his living selling ordinary horses, cattle and
donkeys on his north Louisiana farm. But he expects to expand his
line within the next year.
   The 57-year-old entrepreneur, who already had buffaloes, llamas,
buzzards, peacocks and pheasants on his farm, bought two zebra
stallions at an exotic animal auction and plans to breed them to
his donkeys and Shetland ponies. The resulting animals will be
zdonks and zonies, Gantt said.
   ``Don't just everybody want a zebra,'' Gantt said recently.
``They're mean as Satan and if you take out after them there isn't
a fence that can hold them. But you mix them with a donkey or
Shetland pony and what you get is as sweet as can be.''
   The half-Shetland pony hybrid will sell for $1,500, the
donkey-zebra cross will go for up to $3,500, Gantt said.
   Although you won't find these animals in the dictionary, the
crossbreeding of zebras to donkeys and horses has been done for
years, said David Anderson, curator at the Audubon Zoo in New
Orleans. Zoos consider the resulting animals nothing but
curiosities, he said.
   Gantt already has had success with his bobbydoes. The half
sheep, half goat can sell for up to $600. He had less luck when he
was given some aoudads, a type of African sheep with long, curved
horns.
   ``They're kind of goat-looking things and can jump 16-foot
fences,'' he said. ``We couldn't keep ours penned up. As far as I
know they're still running wild out in the woods.
   ``I keep waiting to hear about some hunter shooting a creature
that nobody can identify, but I guess they can't catch up with them
either.''

   Seven white men tarred and
feathered a white mayor on Saturday as he officiated at a
multiracial wheelchair race, police said.
   The attackers were arrested for endangering public order, said
police spokesman Capt. Reg Crewe. He said it was not known whether
they were affiliated with any paticular right-wing organization.
   He said Gus Gouws, mayor of Welkom in the Orange Free State
province, was attacked just after he had set off contestants in the
wheelchair race. The men poured a sticky fluid and feathers over
Gouws, said Crew.
   Crew said the men also roughed up Gouws' aide and a traffic
policeman who tried to protect the Nationalist Party mayor.
   The Conservative Party gained control of scores of rural towns
in the Orange Free State in October municipal elections and has
tried to reintroduce some racial restrictions that had been
abolished over the past few years.
   In some towns, Conservative majorities have banned multiracial
sports events and restricted public facilities such as parks,
stadiums and town halls to whites.
   The Conservatives won control of Welkom in October elections but
lost it to the Nationalists in a March by-election.
   Minister of Law and Order Adriaan Vlok condemned the attack.
``The time for this type of action in South Africa is long past,''
he said.
   Hannes Meyer, leader of the Conservative Party in the Welkom
city council, also denounced the attack, saying it was not in the
city's interest.

<TEXT>
   President Bush said today he welcomes
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's offer to cut 500 short-range
nuclear missiles in Europe.
   ``Let him do what he says unilaterally. It would be good,'' Bush
told reporters while flying here aboard Air Force One.
   He added that ``we've already removed 2,000 nuclear weapons, and
it would be nice to have him (Gorbachev) go ahead and make some
moves.''
   The president was asked whether he was going to win the ``public
relations war'' with Gorbachev.
   Bush replied: ``No such war. I want to win the peace war _
lasting peace _ that built on action, not on words.''
   Bush's comments came a day after he urged a new approach to the
Soviet Union, saying he wants to welcome that country ``back to the
world order.''
   At Alcorn State University's commencement here, Bush told the
black institution's graduating class that ``any definition of a
successful life must include serving others.''
   ``America needs your talent. And that's not idle talk,'' he said.
   Returning to a favorite domestic theme, community service, Bush
said he hoped some graduates would enter politics ``to fight for
what you believe in, to grapple not only with your own dreams, but
also those of your countrymen.''
   He urged others to enter business, ``where you can create jobs,
adding to the opportunity of other Americans,'' and the teaching
profession, where ``your touchstones should be excellence,
accountability, and choice.''
   ``Whatever you choose, it is within you to change the world _
and any definition of a successful life must include serving
others,'' the president said in the text that was released by his
staff in Houston, where he spent the night.
   Bush quoted the slain civil rights leader, Dr. Martin Luther
King, saying that ``intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus
character _ that is the goal of true education.''
   He also noted his own 41-year history of support for the United
Negro College Fund and said he hoped to help college students get
into government work through his new recruitment program for
part-time and summer positions.
   Later today, Bush was speaking at the Mississippi State
University commencement, the last in a trio of graduation addresses
over two days.
   On Friday, Bush chose Texas A&amp;M University to make a major
foreign policy speech in which he called for a new era of relations
with the the Soviet Union. He challenged Gorbachev to meet goals
that will establish a ``friendship that knows no season of
suspicion, no chill of distrust.''
   Signaling a willingness to shift from previous U.S. approaches,
Bush announced that he wants to move beyond the traditional
``containment'' policy toward Moscow, ``to welcome the Soviet Union
back to the world order.''
   ``Our goal is bold _ more ambitious than any of my predecessors
could have thought possible,'' the president said.
   But he warned that the Soviets would have to meet certain
expectations _ making good on its promises of openness and
democratization _ for the relationship to take off.
   Bush made the comments in a commencement address at Texas A&amp;M
University in College Station, Texas.
   Bush spent the night in his adopted hometown of Houston, where
he went for a jog and dined out with friends.
   His speech Friday staked out a forward-looking approach, geared
to making the most of what national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft called this ``unusual phase of history'' when the Soviets
are also taking a new approach.
   ``The United States now has as its goal much more than simply
containing Soviet expansionism _ we seek the integration of the
Soviet Union into the community of nations,'' Bush said.
   He offered the promise of improved economic and trade relations,
if the Soviets ``meet the challenge of responsible international
behavior'' by such steps as withdrawing troops around the world,
removing the Iron Curtain between East and West Europe, improving
human rights and cooperating in solving regional disputes.
   ``Ultimately, our objective is to welcome the Soviet Union back
into the world order,'' Bush said.
   Scowcroft told reporters Bush was not looking to make ``catchy
headlines'' with his foreign policy.
   ``None of our proposals are going to be that traumatic,''
Scowcroft said. ``You don't turn a great nation like the U.S.
around quickly. We're talking about modifications of direction.''
   Scowcroft had a dim view of an arms reduction proposal Gorbachev
made this week in Moscow following meetings with Secretary of State
James A. Baker III. Scowcroft said Gorbachev's announcement that
the Soviets would unilaterally cut 500 short-range nuclear weapons
in Eastern Europe was ``designed principally to create problems''
within the NATO alliance.
   Baker called Gorbachev's offer a public relations ploy.
   In his speech Friday, Bush proposed two specific policy changes:
an ``open skies'' policy under which each country would be
permitted to overfly the other's territory and monitor military
activities; and easing of the 17-year-old law, the Jackson-Vanik
measure, that ties trade with the Soviet Union to emigration policy.
   Bush said he would support a ``temporary waiver'' of the rule
and offer the Soviets favored trade status if the Soviets codify
new laws ensuring free emigration.
   ``Ending discriminatory treatment of U.S. firms would be a
helpful step. Trade and financial transactions should take place on
a normal commercial basis,'' the president said.
   Bush said the ``hopeful _ indeed remarkable _ signs'' of Soviet
openness should be viewed with an eye toward deeds to back up the
rhetoric, and ``enduring, ingrained economic and political change''
within the Soviet Union.
   ``Make no mistake, a new breeze is blowing across the steppes
and cities of the Soviet Union. Why not, then, let this spirit of
openness grow, let more barriers come down.''

   A cyclone whirled through the
drought-stricken Nilphamari district, killing two people and
destroying more than 5,000 mud-and-straw houses, officials said
Saturday.
   Friday's storm brought needed rains to Nilphamari and two other
districts in the northwestern corner of the country. But despite a
forecast of more rainfall in the next two days, the officials said
there was little hope of reversing the damage caused by three
months of drought.
   Contacted by telephone at Nilphamari, the officials said the
cyclone reached speeds of 60 mph. It injured 50 people, destroyed
66 tin-roofed schools and uprooted many trees, they said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   The weather office in Dhaka said more than a half-inch of rain
fell on Nilphamari, Dinajpur and Rangpur districts in a two-hour
period.
   Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries with a per
capita annual income of $160, alternates between too much and too
little water.
   Last summer's floods submerged four-fifths of the country and
killed at least 1,400 people. Cyclones in November claimed 1,100
more lives, and another 1,100 perished in tornadoes last month.
   The current drought threatens to destroy at least 50 percent of
the rice and wheat crop now in the ground, according to government
officials who had counted on the spring harvest to yield 5.6
millions tons of grain.
   That's about one-fourth the amount Bangladesh needs to feed its
110 million people each year.

   Kansas Republicans are holding their
collective breath, hoping they will hear good news when Sen. Nancy
Kassebaum reveals later this month whether she will seek a third
term in 1990.
   State Democrats are equally anxious, because of the chance an
open seat would give them to elect a U.S. senator for the first
time in 50 years.
   If Kassebaum shuns another six-year term, it would have the
biggest impact of any single event on Kansas politics in many
years. Not only would it portend a free-for-all for her Senate
seat, but it likely would put three U.S. House seats up for grabs,
as those incumbents bid to succeed her.
   Indications are Kassebaum will make her decision known this week.
   Contacted in Washington last week, she wouldn't say whether she
had made a decision, but said she would make a public announcement.
   Kassebaum said previously she will decide this month. Since she
is scheduled to travel to Yugoslavia the week of May 22-26, her
announcement could come within the next four or five days.
   Republicans have been urging Kassebaum to run again, imploring
her both publicly and privately.
   They see the woman who won re-election in 1984 with 76 percent
of the vote as a shoo-in. If she won't run, two GOP members of
Congress, Jan Meyers and Pat Roberts, are considered likely
contenders for the party's nomination. That would mean a costly and
possibly divisive primary.
   With Democratic Congressman Dan Glickman certain to try to
succeed Kassebaum if she doesn't run, Democrats see it as their
best chance to elect a senator since former U.S. Rep. Bill Roy
narrowly missed ousting Republican Sen. Bob Dole in 1974.
   There hasn't been a Democratic senator from Kansas since 1939.
   Kassebaum, 56, is the daughter of former Kansas governor Alf
Landon, who lost the 1936 presidential election to Franklin
Roosevelt. Her 1978 election made her the first female
representative from Kansas, and the first woman elected to the
Senate without having been preceded by her husband. At present,
she's one of only two women in the senate; Maryland Democrat
Barbara Mikulski is the other.
   There are good arguments supporting both sides in the
speculation over whether Kassebaum wants to stay in the Senate or
call it quits after 12 years.
   Kassebaum is known to have told friends and political associates
she was tired of Washington and longed for a more private life. And
she pledged in 1978 she would serve only two terms. She has also
said she needs to consider her elderly mother, Theo Landon.
   On the other hand, she is sensitive to her party's dilemma and
the fact many people want her to run again.
   Gov. Mike Hayden and state GOP Chairman Fred Logan Jr. are among
those in the dark.
   ``I have for some time encouraged her to stay in the Senate, but
I deeply respect the fact it is a decision that only she can
make,'' Hayden said. The governor said a key reason for Kassebaum
to take a third term is the seniority she would have.
   Logan said he thought until three weeks ago that Kassebaum would
not run, but has changed his thinking.
   ``I have no facts to base it on, it's just a feeling,'' the GOP
chairman said. ``I feel she is in a position to really have an
impact in the next six years, and that's why she should run.''
   Democratic State Chairman Jim Parrish also has ``an intuitive
feeling,'' but it's the just the opposite, that she will not run.
   ``It's just my feeling. I'm not necessarily hoping it,'' the
Democratic chairman said.
   ``I think she is a very honest and dedicated person who decided
to run for two terms and did so, and now wants to do something else
with her life.''

   The United States and the Soviet Union are
likely to reach agreement this week on expanding direct flights
between the two countries. Soviet refugees, coming out in rising
numbers, will get some of the prized future seats on Aeroflot.
   Next month, American and Soviet experts in counter-terrorism
techniques will meet in Moscow to consider exchanging information
on murderous groups and how to curb them.
   In September, several Soviet judges engaged in a liberalization
of the country's legal system will come to the United States to
study American procedures.
   Amid all this progress, the Soviets have not torn down the
Berlin Wall or renounced the Brezhnev Doctrine, which justifies
military intervention in East European countries to snuff out
rebellion against Communist rule.
   But the Cold War is receding.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, on his first trip to
Moscow last week, helped push the dark shadows back more. He and a
team drawn from all over the U.S. government, started working with
their Soviet counterparts on a framework for cooperation in Central
America, the Middle East and on nine specific global problems.
   These include terrorism, earthquakes and other natural
disasters, climate changes and narcotics traffic. Baker and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze agreed to meet three or
four times a year, with the next session here in September.
Specialists on the two sides will work out their own schedules for
meetings.
   As a result, the U.S.-Soviet dialogue is expanding, the
opportunity for cooperation enlarged even beyond the detente era of
U.S.-Soviet reconciliation in the 1970s.
   But these developments are getting slight attention. Despite a
strong effort by Baker to shift the focus away from arms control
and to regional problems on which the two sides could work in
concert, Mikhail S. Gorbachev rolled out two headline-making
initiatives at their meeting Thursday in Moscow for cutbacks in
nuclear and conventional forces in Europe.
   Knocked off-balance and cautious by nature, the Bush
administration responded slowly to the Soviet leader, whose
initiatives were having these results:
   1. Further strains within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
alliance, already divided by a dispute over whether th improve
short-range nuclear missiles targeted on Warsaw Pact installations.
   West Germany and other opponents of the missile modernization
plan are inclined to be more receptive to disarmament than the
hardline U.S. and British governments. All agreed at a NATO meeting
on Friday in Brussels that Gorbachev's decision to remove 500
nuclear warheads from Eastern Europe was modest in comparison to
the withdrawal of 2,400 U.S. warheads over the last decade.
   But Gorbachev's moves intensified the pressure for negotiated
reductions in short-range nuclear weapons on both sides that the
United States and Britain regard as threatening to the defense of
Western Europe.
   His proposal to sharply reduce troops, tanks, artillery and
other NATO and Warsaw Pact conventional forces lends support to the
argument that it is safe to negotiate nuclear missile reductions
because the Warsaw Pact's non-nuclear edge will disappear.
   Baker called the proposition hypothetical at a news conference
in Brussels on Friday. ``I'm reminded,'' he said, ``of the old
saying back home `if the dog hadn't stopped he would have caught
the rabbit.' I mean let's see it happen and then address that
question.''
   2. The NATO summit meeting May 29-30 in Brussels that was
supposed to celebrate 40 years of Western unity is now more likely
to be marked by division over missiles and how to cope with
Gorbachev. Both Baker and Sir Geoffrey Howe, the British foreign
secretary, failed in separate meetings this week to persuade West
German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher to back off demands
for missile negotiations.
   3. President Bush's long-awaited first foreign policy
declaration, delivered Friday to the graduating class at Texas A &amp;
M University, appeared pallid in comparison to Gorbachev's moves.
   Bush revived a 34-year-old ``open skies'' proposal first made by
President Dwight D. Eisenhower under which NATO and Warsaw Pact
countries would allow surveillance planes from the other side to
fly over their territory.
   His declaration that the Soviet Union still had to earn the
right to membership in ``the world order'' and to warmer relations
with Western nations seemed out of step with fast-moving events.
   ``Let him do what he says unilaterally, it would be good,'' Bush
told reporters traveling with him Saturday in Mississippi. Asked
whether he was going to win the ``public relations war'' with
Gorbachev, Bush said he wanted to ``win the peace war.''

   Less than two months ago, a criminal investigator
turned an anti-corruption crusade into political magic and won a
parliamentary seat with 86 percent of the vote.
   Today, Telman Gdlyan is in trouble with the Supreme Court for
jailing a scientist who died in prison. And the country's highest
executive power said Saturday he is interfering with an
investigation of alleged abuses of power.
   But Gdlyan's fellow investigator, Nikolai Ivanov, has charged
the two are running into trouble because their investigations are
making high-ranking officials squirm.
   The controversy gripping Gdlyan is a lesson both in rapidly
changing Soviet electoral politics and in President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's effort to make his country one ruled by law rather than
personal dictate.
   Gdlyan, a 49-year-old senior investigator with the prosecutor
general's office, last year exposed a corruption scandal in the
republic of Uzbekistan that brought him national attention.
   An article on the scandal, written by Gdlyan and Ivanov and
published in Ogonyok magazine, caused uproar at the Communist Party
conference in June and turned the two into national heroes.
   Several months later, a criminal investigation began and led to
the conviction of Yuri Churbanov, the son-in-law of former Soviet
leader Leonid I. Brezhnev, on charges of accepting bribes. He was
sentenced to 12 years in a labor camp.
   Gdlyan capitalized on his popularity in March congressional
elections _ the country's first multicandidate nationwide ballot in
70 years. Voters in Moscow's Tushinsky district swept him into
office with 86.6 percent of the vote.
   The balloting was marked by a strong anti-establishment streak.
Boris Yeltsin's reformist campaign garnered 89 percent of Moscow
ballots, and disgruntled voters in Leningrad and Kiev voted against
government and party leaders.
   But in a statement published Saturday, the Presidium of the
Supreme Soviet, the country's highest executive body, came down
hard on Ivanov and Gdlyan.
   The statement in the Communist Party daily Pravda accused the
prosecutors of making provocative statements in meetings and in the
media about alleged violations of law by Soviet leaders.
   It said the investigtors' statements were designed to
``disorient people and interfere in the work of a specially formed
commission ... to verify the numerous ... complaints of citizens
about abuses by Gdlyan and Ivanov in carrying out their
investigative work.''
   On May 7, the Supreme Court said it found systematic abuse in
Gdlyan's handling of an investigation into prominent Estonian
scientist, I.A. Hint. The 67-year-old scientist, who won the
prestigious Lenin Prize, was convicted in 1983 of bribery, theft,
and smuggling. He suffered from a cardiovascular illness and died
in jail.
   Gorbachev, a lawyer by training, has encouraged the Soviet
courts to take on controversial issues that in the past they rarely
touched. He has demanded the legal system be strengthened to
prevent a return to rule by personal dictate, characterized by the
leadership of Josef Stalin.
   The Supreme Court overturned Hint's conviction and questioned
whether Gdlyan should keep his job based upon charges he refused to
hear Hint's arguments and denied him access to a lawyer. When
Hint's wife died shortly after his arrest, the scientist was not
told.
   The court charged Gdlyan showed ``an anti-humanistic character
alien to Soviet criminal procedure and a cruel relation to the
accused.''
   In an April 29 issue of the popular weekly, Arguments and Facts,
Ivanov said high-ranking opponents were responsible for attacks on
them.
   ``Efforts to shield participants, compromise investigators,
endless `verifications' ... are links of the same chain, having
little to do with the idea of creating a a government based on
law,'' he said.

   Reformist leaders are getting the Soviet Union and
China together again after 30 years of estrangement, but mistrust
between the two huge neighbors is rooted in the centuries.
   When Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Deng Xiaoping meet in Beijing this
week, they may find old scars are still sensitive.
   Nikita S. Khrushchev was perplexed by his inability to deal with
Mao Tse-tung and blamed the Chinese leader for the collapse of
relations.
   Years later, he wrote in his memoirs: ``You might say that China
is both close to us and far from us. It's close in that it's our
next-door neighbor and shares a long border with our country. At
the same time, China is far away in that the Chinese have little in
common with our people.''
   In the 1950s, with the Nationalists driven from the Chinese
mainland and anti-communism at its height in the United States,
fear spread that the world's most populous nation would unite with
the strongest Communist power to overwhelm America. They have been
viewed as a triangle ever since.
   The marriage of neighbors survived less than a decade, and in
1972 the United States and China began a normalization process that
challenged the Kremlin to catch up.
   Mistrust goes back at least to the 13th century, when Mongol
hordes invaded Russia, burning towns and villages, slaughtering the
residents and enslaving those they left alive.
   Soviet children still are taught of the brutality visited on
their ancestors and of the historic victory of Ivan the Great, who
``threw off the Mongol yoke'' and established the Russian state in
1480.
   A more recent seed of suspicion was planted in the infancy of
the world Communist movement.
   In 1927, a decade after the Bolshevik revolution, Chiang
Kai-shek began a bloody purge of Chinese Communists with whom he
was ostensibly allied.
   Josef Stalin remained silent, apparently unwilling to alienate
Chiang and expecting him to prevail. During World War II, he aided
Chiang's Nationalists against Japan.
   Chiang fled to Taiwan in 1949. Stalin was the first to recognize
the Communist government on the Chinese mainland. Mao traveled to
Moscow but spent much of the 10 weeks he was there waiting to see
the Soviet dictator. They signed a 30-year Treaty of Friendship.
   Khruschev wrote that Stalin ignored China's special sensitivity
to foreign exploitation. The Soviets wanted access to Chinese
resources but Mao resisted, mindful of the unequal treaties and
trade concessions extracted by the English, Portuguese and others.
   Soviet suspicions arose after Khrushchev, in 1954, invited China
to send a million laborers to Siberia to help exploit the rich
resources. When Mao accepted, the Soviets convinced themselves he
was trying to take over the Siberian economy and absorb the vast,
sparsely populated territory.
   ``In short, they wanted to make Siberia Chinese rather than
Russian,'' Khrushchev recalled. ``It was a clever maneuver, but it
didn't work.''
   The Kremlin quickly ended the labor program.
   Relations had become touchy by that time and were exacerbated by
Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin in the so-called ``secret
speech'' at the 20th Soviet Party Congress in 1956.
   Mao initially joined in criticizing the late dictator,
Khrushchev wrote, but then reversed course and began praising
Stalin.
   ``I think that, secretly, he disapproved all along of our
censuring Stalin for his crimes,'' Khrushchev said. ``Why do I
think so? Because I believe Mao suffered from the same megalomania
Stalin had all his life. He had the same diseased outlook on other
people.''
   Mistrust became animosity when the Soviets reneged on an
agreement to provide China with nuclear weapons technology.
Khrushchev claimed Mao was eager to use the bomb on his enemies.
   Despite the decline in relations, Khrushchev made a secret trip
to Beijing in hopes of persuading Mao to let the Soviet navy build
a communications base and refueling facilities on Chinese
territory. Mao resisted.
   At the last summit, in September 1959 in Beijing, ``the warmth
had gone out of our relations with China, and it had been replaced
by a chill that I could sense as soon as I arrived,'' Khrushchev
recalled.
   Soviet advisers and engineers assigned to projects in China
became the butt of anti-Soviet feeling. The Kremlin, incensed and
suspecting Mao encouraged the behavior, withdrew all technical
personnel in the summer of 1960, leaving hundreds of projects
unfinished.
   Mao's rejection of what he considered Soviet revisionism brought
the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution intended to purify
Chinese communism, further widening the gulf. Soviet and Chinese
troops fought several border skirmishes in 1969.
   As recently as 1979, the year the United States and China
finally restored normal relations, the threat of war loomed along
the frontier.
   In a book seen as a not-so-subtle threat, Soviet author Victor
Louis predicted China's ethnic minorities would rise up and seek
unity with their cousins in pro-Soviet Mongolia and Soviet Central
Asia.
   Louis, widely believed to have ties to the KGB secret police,
said fighting could start ``at any moment'' and hundreds of
thousands of Soviet ``volunteers'' would rush to aid the oppressed
minorities.

announcement could come within the next four or five days.
   Republicans have been urging Kassebaum to run again, imploring
her both publicly and privately.
   They see the woman who won re-election in 1984 with 76 percent
of the vote as a shoo-in. If she won't run, two GOP members of
Congress, Jan Meyers and Pat Roberts, are considered likely
contenders for the party's nomination. That would mean a costly and
possibly divisive primary.
   With Democratic Congressman Dan Glickman certain to try to
succeed Kassebaum if she doesn't run, Democrats see it as their
best chance to elect a senator since former U.S. Rep. Bill Roy
narrowly missed ousting Republican Sen. Bob Dole in 1974.
   There hasn't been a Democratic senator from Kansas since 1939.
   Kassebaum, 56, is the daughter of former Kansas governor Alf
Landon, who lost the 1936 presidential election to Franklin
Roosevelt. Her 1978 election made her the first female
representative from Kansas, and the first woman elected to the
Senate without having been preceded by her husband. At present,
she's one of only two women in the senate; Maryland Democrat
Barbara Mikulski is the other.
   There are good arguments supporting both sides in the
speculation over whether Kassebaum wants to stay in the Senate or
call it quits after 12 years.
   Kassebaum is known to have told friends and political associates
she was tired of Washington and longed for a more private life. And
she pledged in 1978 she would serve only two terms. She has also
said she needs to consider her elderly mother, Theo Landon.
   On the other hand, she is sensitive to her party's dilemma and
the fact many people want her to run again.
   Gov. Mike Hayden and state GOP Chairman Fred Logan Jr. are among
those in the dark.
   ``I have for some time encouraged her to stay in the Senate, but
I deeply respect the fact it is a decision that only she can
make,'' Hayden said. The governor said a key reason for Kassebaum
to take a third term is the seniority she would have.
   Logan said he thought until three weeks ago that Kassebaum would
not run, but has changed his thinking.
   ``I have no facts to base it on, it's just a feeling,'' the GOP
chairman said. ``I feel she is in a position to really have an
impact in the next six years, and that's why she should run.''
   Democratic State Chairman Jim Parrish also has ``an intuitive
feeling,'' but it's the just the opposite, that she will not run.
   ``It's just my feeling. I'm not necessarily hoping it,'' the
Democratic chairman said.
   ``I think she is a very honest and dedicated person who decided
to run for two terms and did so, and now wants to do something else
with her life.''

<HEAD>Can Noriega Survive His Own Mistakes?</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD HERZFELDER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega has
survived U.S. sanctions, drug indictments and years of opposition
demonstrations. The question of the hour has become, can he survive
his own mistakes?
   Noriega permitted an election and lost it, and even worse,
showed weakness by failing to successfully steal it.
   He also gave strength and a sense of unity to his enemies by
ordering or allowing an attack on opposition candidates before the
eyes of the world.
   With all that, Noriega still has sources of support both in the
country and apparently in the Panamanian Defense Forces, command of
which has given him de facto control of the country.
   The general genuinely thought his forces would win the election,
or at least come close enough so that a little fraud wouldn't be
noticed. ``He didn't have a clue that his man might lose,'' said
former President Jimmy Carter, an international observer who talked
to the general before last Sunday's election.
   A win would have given Noriega's regime credibility, both
internationally and internally.
   ``It would have let him thumb his nose at the world,'' said one
Western analyst.
   One U.S. official said Carter served a particularly useful role
because he accepted the process as fair until the last moment.
   The spectacle of a former U.S. president known for rectitude
declaring that he personally had seen officials counting
counterfeit vote tallies destroyed the election's credibility.
   Clusters of Panamanians watched in fascination whenever the
press conference was replayed on U.S. armed forces television.
   Nevertheless, the official count proceeded, showing Noriega
candidate Carlos Duque leading 2-1 despite opposition counts and
respected exit polls that showed a 3-1 win for opposition candidate
Guillermo Endara.
   By Wednesday, apparently, the divide between fiction and reality
became too great to bear and the election was nullified.
   ``The opposition had a shocking majority,'' said Cesar Quintera,
an independent lawyer.
   The opposition demonstrated against the election Monday, but as
so often in the past, thousands of demonstrators scattered like
frightened quail before a few dozen police.
   Such scenes raised questions about the opposition's fortitude,
but there was no question about what happened Wednesday.
   The opposition candidates, including the pacific, bespectacled
and terrified Endara, were beaten bloody before television cameras
by pipe-wielding thugs.
   ``Noriega showed his desperation,'' said first vice presidential
candidate Ricardo Arias Calderon, one of the victims.
   The result was a hurricane of international disapproval,
isolating the Panamanian government at a moment when it most needed
help in a confrontation with the United States.
   President Bush sent additional American troops to U.S. bases
near the Panama Canal, but the Panamanian government's efforts to
rally opinion against them had little effect and probably won't
unless the United States actually intervenes.
   The opposition is discussing calling for a one-day work stoppage
Wednesday. They have offered to negotiate with Noriega, but only if
he agrees to depart.
   Still, one of the opposition's problems has been its tendency to
look north for a solution, a tendency it has not entirely lost.
   ``The PDF (soldiers) would throw down their guns the moment U.S.
helicopters flew over the barracks,'' said one opposition supporter.
   That's unlikely unless U.S. citizens are in danger.
   The government coalition has shown a tense outward unity, but
some of the nine parties got virtually no votes and feel they were
fatally damaged by their connection to Noriega.
   Noriega has never been one for making public speeches, but his
silence during a national crisis has been remarkable and has
encouraged speculation he is dealing with trouble in the officer
corps.
   Noriega's support always has been based on the lower side of
Panama's racial and class divide, a divide that some still feel
strongly.
   ``We kicked the oligarchy out in 1968 and we don't want them
back,'' said Eric Arce, a Noriega supporter.
   The Defense Forces have been recruited largely from the lower
class, and Noriega has remarked that if the ``rabi-blancos,'' which
translates loosely to ``white butts,'' paid more attention, ``there
would be a different commander today.''
   Nevertheless, the size of the opposition vote suggests support
at all levels. Regime opponents claim that at some polls where
hundreds of soldiers voted, the government received fewer than 100
votes.
   ``They couldn't even keep the votes they bought,'' said an
opposition statement.
   The only constitutional option is another election before Sept.
1, when acting President Manuel Solis Palma's term is up.
   Unconstitutional possibilities that Noriega might favor include
a provisional junta and extending Solis Palma's term.
   But on an elemental level, Noriega has lost his biggest
advantage.
   Whatever else he was, he was Panama's strong man, and the
opposition was seen as weak. He will have trouble getting what he
wants unless he can restore his position.

<HEAD>Los Angeles Teaches Poised To Strike After Lengthy Impasse</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Teachers in the nation's second-largest
school district, seeking more money and more control of the
curriculum, are threatening a strike Monday that could create chaos
for 594,000 students weeks before school's end.
   The United Teachers-Los Angeles, representing 22,000 of the
district's 32,000 teachers, nurses and counselors, said its members
would keep at home with them the attendance and grade records that
School Superintendent Leonard Britton demanded be handed in by
Monday.
   The records, said Telfair Avenue Elementary School teacher
Stanley Malin, ``are already gone. That's no decision.'' A Monday
strike would be the district's first since a 23-day walkout in 1970.
   Britton's demand to teachers to hand in their grades by Monday
caused UTLA to move up its strike deadline from May 30. Classes end
June 26 for most schools in the 700-square-mile district, and
Britton said putting the strike deadline so close to the end of
school was extortionate.
   The district has vowed to keep its 800 elementary and high
schools open with substitute teachers who were being mass-hired
into the weekend. Officials admitted they may function just a step
above baby-sitters.
   The past week was filled with news conferences and posturing,
but little in the way of progress between the sides, which have
been bargaining on and off for 16 months. Teachers have been
working without a contract for a year.
   No formal negotiations were scheduled over the weekend, but both
sides were meeting informally and talking on the telephone. Still,
there was little optimism.
   ``Doing all that doesn't erase a $200 million difference,'' said
chief district negotiator Dick Fisher on Friday. ``People of good
faith can talk and meet and do all those things and still not reach
an agreement.''
   Only late in the week was any move made by state legislators to
push for a settlement or find additional money to help the school
district meet salary demands.
   Bob Forsyth, a spokesman for Senate President Pro Tem David
Roberti, said the district would get at least $34 million in new
revenue that could be used for teacher salaries.
   Asked if students were being used as pawns, Fairfax High School
student body president Yasmina Porter said, ``We are, and we know
that this is the only bargaining tool teachers have, so we
understand.''
   But parents expressed concern.
   ``I'm not real thrilled about substitutes. I think it's going to
be utter chaos,'' said Christen Dingman, 40, of Chatsworth, who has
two sons in school. ``The teachers are being greedy.''
   Instructors want a two-year contract with a 21 percent wage
increase. They also want elimination of non-paid teaching duties
such as faculty meetings and after-school playground monitoring,
plus a say in how their schools are run, an issue called teacher
governance.
   The district has offered a 21.5 percent pay increase over a
three-year period, and has offered a teacher governance structure
which the UTLA has said is too tilted toward administrators.
   The teachers in March overwhelmingly rejected a district offer
for a 20 percent pay raise over three years and voted strike
authorization at that time. The issues went to a state fact-finder
whose report is due Wednesday.
   Currently, teachers annually earn from $23,440 to $43,319.
   Administrators' salaries start at $37,000 and go to $95,600 for
associate superintendents. Britton earns $141,000 as superintendent.
   Union President Wayne Johnson blamed Britton for the impasse,
saying the superintendent has not been flexible enough. But Johnson
admits that his union's derogatory references to Britton's salary
and administration style were aimed at ``pushing his buttons.''
   Johnson said in an interview that he has not been able to
establish the kind of informal contact with Britton that usually
keeps both sides talking.
   ``I tried that with him,'' he said. ``I gave him my home
telephone number, and the only time he called me was because he was
furious over some message we put out on our hotline. That made me
realize he was sensitive and takes things personally. ... You'd
better have a pretty thick hide for that job.''
   Several attempts were made by The Associated Press during the
past week to reach Britton or get his responses through a
representative, all without success.
   So far, the possibility of a teachers' strike has not aroused
parents and legislators as it usually does elsewhere, one observer
says.
   ``In other cities, there's usually a lot of pressure from the
parents and business community. You don't hear much here,'' said
Priscilla Wohlstetter, an assistant professor of education at the
University of Southern California.

<HEAD>Aging Americans Refilling the `Empty Nests' of Mothers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's mothers are finding more than ever
that the ``empty nest'' left by grown children is quickly refilled
by frail parents or other aging relatives in need of home care,
according to a private study.
   Most alarming, says the Mother's Day report issued by the Older
Women's League, is that while life expectancy increases, the ranks
of younger people who can care for the elderly are shrinking, since
the baby-boom generation has created a baby bust by having fewer
children.
   Already, Americans 85 and older, the group most in need of
long-term care, are the fastest growing segment of the population,
with their numbers projected to increase from 2.9 million to 5
million by the year 2,000, the study says. It estimated that the
over-65 population, meanwhile, will more than double to 52 million,
or one in six people, in the same period.
   ``On average, women today spend 17 years of their lives caring
for children and 18 years assisting aged parents. For the first
time ever, American couples have more parents than children. The
result will be a significant decline in the number of family
caregivers at the same time the need increases dramatically,'' the
report said.
   The study, titled ``Failing America's Caregivers: a Status
Report on Women Who Care,'' was partially funded by the Charles H.
Revson Foundation and the American Federation of Federal, State,
County and Municipal Employes, AFL-CIO. It was derived from census
data and a dozens of congressional, academic and other independent
studies concerning the elderly, as well as original research by the
staff of the Older Women's League, a non-profit advocacy group with
more than 120 chapters.
   OWL President Lou Glasse noted the findings indicate that ``In
1989, a woman whose children are grown has completed, on average,
less than half the caregiving she will provide during her life. Far
from being free of responsibility, in many cases her most difficult
years lie ahead.
   ``Already,'' she said, ``nearly two million women are part of
the `sandwich' generation, caring simultaneously for children and
parents. Millions more go very quickly from child care to elder
care.
   ``Over the next few decades,'' said Ms. Glasse, ``America will
have fewer caregivers, many more people who need care, and more
women in the paid work force with less time to give. If these
trends continue, we will face a crisis of enormous proportions.''
   The report said that ``while child care has been the work and
family conflict of the 1980s ... elder care will be the No. 1
workplace issue of the 1990s, as women struggle to hold paying jobs
while caring for elderly parents and spouses.''
   Other findings:
   _Among children who care for their parents, daughters outnumber
sons three to one. The average caregiver is 45 years old, female,
and married. But 35 percent of caregivers to the elderly are
themselves over 65 years old, and 10 percent are over 75. As women
outlive men and often marry older men, many become caregivers to
their spouses.
   _About 89 percent of women over age 18 will provide care to
children, parents, or both, and 31 percent will care for both
children and parents.
   _About 52 percent of the married mothers of infants and 55
percent of women caring for elderly relatives are in the work
force, and women working full-time are four times more likely to be
primary caregivers to the elderly as are working men.
   _Ninety-five percent of the elderly and 90 percent of the
disabled elderly live at home, with family members providing
virtually all their care. The cost of outside care for the elderly
is enormously more expensive than for children. Day care for
children averages $3,000 annually, compared to $25,000 for a
nursing home for the elderly.
   _During the 1990s, the number of elderly in the South and West
will increase about 20 percent, with the greatest increases in
Nevada, 70 percent; Arizona, 50 percent; and Florida, 39 percent.
   OWL said the report demonstrates the need for legislation to
protect the jobs of people caring for parents and spouses, as well
as children, and to provide more federal assistance for the
long-term care of the chronically ill.

   The party founded by dictator
Juan Domingo Peron is poised to return to power for only the second
time in three decades on Sunday when Argentines elect a new
president.
   Polls show that voters, upset with a collapsing economy, are
likely to favor Peronist Party candidate Carlos Menem over Eduardo
Angeloz of the governing Radical Civic Union.
   In 1987, the Peronists captured a majority of the congressional
and gubernatorial races.
   Voters on Sunday also will elect a vice president, half of the
Chamber of Deputies, one national senator, legislatures in 14 of
the nation's 22 provinces, and several thousand municipal officials.
   Voting is obligatory for Argentines between the ages of 18 and
70. About 20 million of the country's 31 million people are
eligible. The new president will be inaugurated Dec. 10.
   Menem has led public opinion polls since he was nominated by the
Peronists in July. But Angeloz has often reminded voters that
President Raul Alfonsin also had been expected to lose when he ran
in 1983.
   Alfonsin is prohibited by the constitution from seeking a second
six-year term.
   Menem, 58, and Angeloz, 57, both are provincial governors and
lawyers. Each is offering a different vision of how Argentina might
overcome a chronic budget deficit, triple-digit inflation, rising
unemployment and a $59 billion foreign debt.
   Angeloz, whose main support comes from the middle class, pledged
to sell inefficient state industries, reduce the role of the state
in the economy, maintain a free exchange rate, spur exports and
revamp organized labor.
   ``The hour of truth has arrived,'' the stocky, two-time governor
of Cordoba Province said in his final campaign ads. ``There are
many ways of voting for the past. There is only one way of voting
for the future.''
   Menem, whose main support comes from the working poor,
recognized the need to balance the national budget but voiced
lukewarm support for the privatization of state industries and said
he intended to significantly increase wages.
   The biggest of the approximately 300 companies controlled by the
government were nationalized by Gen. Peron when he was in power
between 1946 and 1955, the year he was ousted by a military coup.
Currently, about 2 million Argentines of a work force of about 11
million are employed by the state.
   To restart the economy, Menem pledged to implement a
``productive revolution,'' a concept he never fully explained.
   ``I am not promising miracles overnight ... I'm not a
superman,'' Menem told 100,000 cheering supporters at his closing
campaign rally on Thursday. ``The only thing I can promise is work,
work and more work.''
   The main issue in the October 1983 election, which followed
brutal military dictatorship, was democracy. At the end of
campaigns that were emotional and joyous, Argentines chose
Alfonsin, an attorney and noted human rights leader.
   But after five turbulent years marked by 13 general strikes, a
devalued currency and three military insurrections, the level of
enthusiasm this year has fallen considerably.
   Menem needs more than 50 percent of the electoral college votes
to win outright. Angeloz must keep Menem below that figure in order
to forge a coalition of other parties and form a majority.
   A side issue in the campaign this year is the military, which is
clamoring for a bigger budget, more political power and an end to
the trials of officers accused of anti-leftist human rights
violations during the 1976-1983 military dictatorships.
   Angeloz and Menem each has ruled out a pardon for officers
convicted of rights abuses.
   The Peronist Party claims 4 million members and has been the
country's biggest since it was put together by Peron. Following his
overthrow in September 1955, the party was banned and many of its
leaders jailed or exiled.
   The party was barred from competing in national elections until
March 1973, when Hector Campora was elected president and Menem the
governor of La Rioja, the poor, rural province where he was born.
   Campora stepped down in favor of Peron, who was elected by an
overwhelming margin that September.
   Following Peron's death on July 1, 1974, his third wife, Isabel,
took over as president. She was deposed by coup in March 1976 and
Menem was jailed during that time.

<HEAD>Pennsylvania Voters Asked to Trade Income Tax for Lower Property
Tax</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BLOOD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pennsylvanians vote Tuesday on a
controversial tax tradeoff that would allow counties to impose
local income taxes in exchange for lower property taxes.
   The measure is the cornerstone of a far-reaching tax overhaul
plan proposed by Gov. Robert P. Casey, but few state officials are
expressing confidence that it will pass.
   Supporters say the plan would produce overall tax cuts, while
opponents say most people would end up paying more. Non-partisan
experts say the argument is virtually meaningless because the
changes would differ from one county to the next.
   Despite extensive news coverage and advertising about the issue,
polls indicate that many voters remain undecided. Voter turnout is
expected to be low outside Pittsburgh, where the race for mayor has
been strongly contested.
   ``There's such a tremendous uncertainty out there, it's
difficult to say how they are going to go,'' said Mark Schreiber,
executive director of the Democratic State Committee. ``Who knows
the way this issue will play?''
   David Sanko, coordinator for Citizens Against Higher Taxes,
which opposes the plan, said he was guardedly optimistic about the
outcome of Tuesday's vote.
   ``We've been given plenty of reasons to be wary,'' he said.
``It's tough to say what will happen over the weekend. ... It's
hard to predict.''
   Although the campaign has featured some heated dialogue, the
final weekend appeared to be relatively quiet. Casey scheduled a
campaign stop in Johnstown and both sides planned a flurry of
last-minute advertising.
   The ballot issue would change the state constitution to allow
most counties to impose a 0.5 percent income tax, and Philadelphia
and Allegheny counties to impose a 1 percent tax. Allegheny County
encompasses Pittsburgh.
   It also would allow residential property taxes to be set lower
than business property taxes.
   While the tax plan is the major statewide issue on Tuesday's
ballot, there are local measures and mayoral races that also are
drawing attention.
   In Pittsburgh, Mayor Sophie Masloff is trying to retain the seat
she was appointed to when Mayor Richard S. Caliguiri died last
year. Polls have shown her to be running neck-and-neck with
Allegheny County controller Frank Lucchino in the Democratic
primary election.
   In Erie, the state's third-largest city, six Democrats and two
Republicans are jockeying to succeed Mayor Louis J. Tullio, who is
stepping aside to battle the same rare disease, amylodosis, that
killed Caliguiri.
   About 85 percent of the state's communities and three counties
also are voting on whether to allow non-profit groups to hold
raffles and other small games of chance.

   The Massachusetts Democrat, who is Mrs. Kennedy's youngest son,

   Mrs. Kennedy, who will be 99 in July, is expected to receive
numerous cards and calls from far-flung family members as well as

Schlossberg.
   ``Caroline is planning to send up pictures of her daughter,''
O'Connor said, referring to Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, the

   Of all the stars and starlets coming here
the 42nd Cannes Film Festival, none have been awaited with as much
anticipation as American actress Meryl Streep who arrived for the
Saturday showing of her film, ``A Cry in the Dark.''
   Her picture, on the covers of French Vogue and the film magazine
Premiere, stares from newsstands throughout France and her film, by
Australian director Fred Schepisi, is considered a major contender
for the Golden Palm, the festival's top prize.
   The house was packed for the morning press showing, and sniffles
from some of the hard-nosed critics attending the two-week festival
were audible.
   She told a crowded news conference that she came here to help
promote the film for European audiences, and ``I actually forgot it
was in the competition.''
   Ms. Streep was nominated for an Oscar for her performance in the
film.
   ``I'm almost more proud of it than anything I've done,'' she
said. The role is based on the true story of a mother, Londy
Chamberlain, who was convicted of killing her baby after she said
the child was snatched and devoured by a wild dog in the Australian
outback. She was eventually exonerated.
   She said being taken in by sensational news stories, like the
ones written about the Chamberlain case, is ``the sort of thing we
all do, not just in Australia. It's the way the news is packaged.
... It's very dangerous.''
   ``Truth,'' she said, ``walks in many disguises. Londy had the
truth and no one believed her.''

   The proceeds will go to National Public Radio affiliate KCHU of
Valdez, which was drained financially trying to provide news
coverage of the spill, according to Smith spokeswoman, Susan Nadler.
   Smith will be joined by Alaskan singer-songwriter Hobo Jim at
the concerts.

   Actor Kurt Russell says fish and game killed
during a second annual celebrity hunting and fishing tournament
this summer will be donated to Hawaii's hungry.
   Russell's first tournament in Colorado drew criticism from
animal rights activists.
   ``I think we can improve the image of hunting in a very positive
way along with taking care of a significant problem, and that is
hungry people in the United States,'' Russell said Friday. ``I
think we can do that without asking people for dollars.''
   Plans call for donating 50,000 meals of fish, foul, pork and
goat meat to the Salvation Army, which will distribute the food to
the poor, Russell said.
   Among those invited to participate in the week-long tournament
that begins Aug. 28 are sports greats Mickey Mantle and Walter
Payton and actor Don Johnson.
   Russell starred in ``Silkwood'' and ``Tequila Sunrise.''

   Two former Oakland police officers can
avoid going to prison for perjury following a judge's order to
serve a 120-day sentence of home detention and publicly apologize
for lying about their sick leave.
   Johnnie F. Clark and Theresa Jeffery received the unusual
sentence Friday from U.S. District Judge John Vukasin.
   The couple, now married and fired from the force in 1987, were
convicted of lying in a discrimination lawsuit they filed with
seven other black officers in 1985. The lawsuit, which accused the
city of racial bias in hiring and promotions, was later dismissed
for unrelated reasons.
   During the lawsuit, the two said they were harassed by other
officers. The two were disciplined when they called in sick in
1983, a day before they were to go on vacation. They told an
opposing lawyer in the lawsuit that the sick call was truthful.
   But records showed the two called in sick from Iowa and had been
stopped for speeding the previous day in Nebraska.
   Both were convicted of perjury. Clark was also convicted of
making a false statement to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission in a discrimination complaint. Each of the crimes was
punishable by five years in prison.
   Vukasin sentenced the pair to 120 days of home detention,
monitored by electronic bracelets, that will allow them to leave
only for work or necessities such as grocery shopping. He also
ordered 150 hours each of community service and placed them on
three years' probation. The apology must be published and be read
at police roll calls.
   Clark's lawyer said the defendants would appeal their
convictions, contending the statements about sick leave were
unrelated to the discrimination case and could not be the basis of
perjury charges.

<HEAD>Greenspan Says Buyout Wave Has Peaked But Business Leaders Unsure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HOT SPRINGS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
told business leaders Saturday he believes America has seen the
peak in a wave of leveraged buyouts, but the executives said that
assessment may be premature.
   ``We all hope Alan is correct,'' said David M. Roderick,
chairman of USX Corp. But he added there are still ``tremendous
amounts of cash out there to keep this LBO, highly leveraged
situation going for some period of time.''
   Greenspan addressed a private session of the Business Council,
made up of 65 chief executives of America's largest corporations.
   The Fed chairman declined to comment publicly, but Robert G.
Kirby, chairman of Capital Guardian Trust Co., said Greenspan had
expressed an opinion that debt-financed takeovers will subside
because ``the easiest, obvious ones'' already have been done.
   Kirby disagreed, saying there are plenty more corporate
``sitting ducks'' that are potential takeover targets.
   ``I wish Mr. Greenspan were right but I don't think he's going
to be,'' Kirby told a news conference after the session.
   Roderick gave a similar assessment: ``Hopefully Alan is right
but I think that when you look back you see that money markets do
not tend to act that rationally.''
   In a leveraged buyout, an investment group borrows heavily to
buy out stockholders and take over the target company. The new
owners often either cut costs or sell off parts of the company to
pay back the loans.
   Critics of the practice fear that high debt levels, particularly
in the event of an economic downturn, could endanger both the
bought-out company and the financiers of the transaction.
   Roderick said that while LBO's are likely to persist in the near
future, ``over a period of time that is an unsustainable trend.''
   ``You create ultimately so much debt that in any recession or
any downturn there would be tremendous negative potential
repercussions,'' he said.
   Roderick said that while companies and investment bankers can
make ``horrendous sums of money'' on takeovers, the overall effect
on the economy is negative because high debt levels force
corporations to cut back on investment, research and development.
   ``America long term is paying a horrible price,'' he said. ``We
get short-term gains at the expense of burdening the corporations
with tremendous debt.''
   Roderick said the negative effects of LBOs may have to become
more pronounced before the debt-financed takeovers subside.
   Rep. William Thomas, R-Calif., a member of the House Budget
Committee who also spoke to the council, said Congress has
considered legislation to cut down on LBOs but is hesitant to make
major changes.
   ``The more we hold hearings, the more we know, the less inclined
my colleagues are to determine who is and who is not a corporate
raider,'' Thomas said. ``The more we know, the more hesitant we are
to move in and make major fundamental changes in the law.''
   Greenspan has said on other occasions that LBOs may diminish
without congressional action and that restricting the tax deduction
for corporate debt could be dangerous to the economy.
   Roderick said even corporate leaders who are concerned about
debt-financed takeovers don't want legislative relief. ``We don't
want Congress ... getting into the middle to say that this company
cannot buy this company or this individual cannot buy that
company,'' Roderick said. ``The free market in the final analyses
is the best judge.''
   The Business Council was gathered this weekend for its
semiannual retreat at a Virginia resort. On Friday, the group
released an economic forecast the predicts a sharp slowdown in
growth later this year but an upturn by the end of 1991.

<HEAD>Avril Fires Two Cabinet Ministers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril has fired
two widely criticized Cabinet ministers in his first high-level
personnel move since rank-and-file soldiers brought him to power
eight months ago.
   The government decree, read Saturday on state radio, came less
than six weeks after the Haitian leader narrowly escaped an attempt
by some officers to oust him.
   The two Cabinet members, Foreign Affairs Minister Serge Charles
and Information Minister Anthony Saint-Pierre, caused a public
outcry for their role in granting a safe conduct pass out of Haiti
in December to former Mayor Franck Romain. Romain was indicted for
masterminding the massacre of at least 12 parishioners in a slum
church.
   The Sept. 11 massacre outraged soldiers and spurred the ouster
of former ruler Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy a week later. Both Namphy and
Romain now live in the neighboring Dominican Republic.
   Namphy ruled this impoverished Caribbean nation after dictator
Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to France in 1986. Namphy turned over
power to civilian Leslie Manigat in February 1988 but deposed
Manigat in June.
   Opposition leaders have persistently demanded the removal of
Saint-Pierre, considered one of Avril's most influential advisers.
   In a memorandum to Avril leaked to the press in January,
Saint-Pierre encouraged the government to repress ``perhaps with
bloodshed'' the Peasant Movement of Papaye in central Haiti, which
he accused of subversion.
   The decree announcing the Cabinet changes, dated Friday, was
read by state-run Radio Nationale, privately owned Radio Metropole
and Radio Soleil, run by the Roman Catholic Church.
   The decree said the new information minister was Ms. Rosemarie
Nazon, Avril's sister-in-law and previously a civil servant in the
ministry.
   It said the new foreign affairs minister was Yvon Perrier,
formerly the ministry's general director.
   Soldiers loyal to Avril blocked an attempted coup by
pro-Duvalierist army officers on April 2. The ringleaders were
exiled to the United States. The coup attempt came four days after
Avril fired four officers accused of drug-running.
   A crackdown on drug trafficking in the army is one of the
conditions for the resumption of U.S. aid.
   The United States suspended $60 million of a $90 million annual
aid package after thugs protected by soldiers massacred at least 34
voters at polling stations during elections on Nov. 29, 1987. Those
elections were canceled.
   Avril has pledged to allow free elections, though not for at
least two years, and has partially restored Haiti's 1987
constitution.

<HEAD>Baltic Activists Band Together To Criticize Moscow Meddling</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TALLINN, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of activists from throughout
the restive Baltic republics gathered for the first time on
Saturday to demand economic freedom and an end to Moscow's meddling
in their homelands.
   Leaders of the People's Fronts from Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania also drafted a resolution charging that President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's drive for perestroika, or restructuring, has failed
to curb economic decline.
   Another resolution claimed the tiny republics have the right to
choose any economic system that would meet material needs, protect
the environment, and break the stranglehold of Moscow-based
planners and officials.
   ``The only chance we have to get better is to get rid of this
vampire that is sucking our blood,'' Dainis Ivans, president of the
Latvian People's Front, told the assembly. ``But we can't do it
separately, we can only do it together _as three Baltic sisters.''
   Ivans was among more than 400 activists from the republics who
gathered at the House of Political Education in Tallinn, the
Estonian capital. After the meeting, the visitors and an estimated
5,000 Estonians rallied in the town square.
   Vytautas Landsbergis, chairman of the Lithuanian People's Front,
expressed hope during the meeting that the activists would agree on
the creation of a ``real commonwealth of the Baltic peoples.''
   Leaders of the People's Fronts have met several times since the
groups were founded last autumn in the liberalized political
climate fostered by Gorbachev. But this weekend's two-day session
in the Estonian capital was the first to bring together members of
their rank-and-file.
   The resolutions defy the ideas of a Kremlin commission on Baltic
problems. The Kremlin plan would give control of food and consumer
goods to the 15 Soviet republics but keep Moscow-based ministries
in charge of energy, defense production and at least half of heavy
industry.
   Baltic activists want complete economic autonomy. They contend
Soviet authorities have drained their tiny republics of consumer
goods and food to subsidize poorer regions of the country.
   Lawmakers in Estonia and Lithuania convene Friday in sessions
expected to reject the Kremlin plan and call for bolder steps.
Estonia's draft law gives the Tallinn government control over
virtually all industries except defense.
   Lithuania's law declares all its resources ``property of the
republic'' and proclaims the right to issue its own currency, said
mathematician Vytautas Statulevicius, a People's Front member and
deputy in Lithuania's Supreme Soviet legislature.
   Ceslovas Stankevicius, a Lithuanian militant from Kaunas, said
Lithuanians have been told Gorbachev had supported the republic's
Communist Party chief, Algirdas Brazauskas, when he explained the
law to a meeting Friday at the party's Central Committee
headquarters in Moscow. But others attending the meeting reportedly
opposed it.
   The law being considered by the Tallinn assembly calls for ``a
transition to economic independence'' in the Baltic republics by
early 1990.
   In separate caucusing, more than 80 newly elected members of the
new Soviet parliament from the Baltic fronts met to devise a common
platform.
   Another resolution demands that national leaders recognize the
``Stalinist genocide'' in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and convene
a trial of its perpetrators. Hundreds of thousands of Baltic
residents were deported or killed under dictator Josef Stalin,
including 80,000 in 1941 alone, the draft charges.
   The Baltic republics were forcibly absorbed by the Soviets in
1940 after the Nazis consigned them to Moscow's sphere of influence
in a secret deal with Stalin.
   The republics are among several ethnic regions in the Soviet
Union that are demanding more independence.

<TEXT>
   More than 150 couples who once might have
thought they'd never celebrate Mother's Day gathered for a party
Saturday with their children conceived through in-vitro
fertilization.
   The families brought about 175 children who were conceived at
the Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine at Eastern Virginia
Medical School. More than 500 children have been born through the
institute, the most successful in-vitro fertilization program in
the country.
   The families are among the lucky few; about 20 percent of the
couples who go through the program emerge with a baby. Under the
in-vitro process, eggs and sperm are mixed in a petri dish and the
fertilized eggs are placed in the uterus.
   ``I felt I couldn't miss this,'' said Rochelle Foster, 41, of
Matawan, N.J., as she held her 1-year-old son, Jonathan, at a
picnic on the medical school grounds. ``It's nice to see all the
successful people together because when you're actually down for a
cycle ... you don't know who's going to be the ones who are going
to be successful.''
   Mrs. Foster made five attempts to get pregnant in three in-vitro
programs before she succeeded on her second try at the Jones
Institute.
   ``I had been trying since 1976 to have a baby,'' she said. ``I
didn't think I was going to have a biological child.''
   Janet Adams of Chesapeake went through in-vitro fertilization
three times before she got pregnant with triplets, 3-year-old
Bradley, Travis and Ryan. ``I got my money's worth,'' she said.
   Robin and Danny Morris of Weston, Conn., showed up pushing two
double strollers that carried their 21-month-old quadruplets _
Sabrina, Tyler, Jesse and Paul.
   Mrs. Morris, who was the first to deliver quadruplets in the
Jones program, said she had always wanted a large family.
   ``I couldn't go through in vitro four times,'' she said. ``I got
it all at once. It was terrific.''
   Dr. Howard Jones, the institute's founder, introduced two
special guests to the crowd, 7-year-old Elizabeth Carr of
Westminster, Mass., the country's first ``test-tube'' baby, and
Sarah Smith, a Virginia Beach woman who was the program's first
patient. She delivered twins, Ashley and Heather Smith, in 1985
after eight in-vitro attempts.
   ``I've told them all along that they're very special to their
mommy and daddy, that they are miracle babies and that a doctor
helped them to be born,'' Mrs. Smith said.
   Nash Bilisoly, a Norfolk lawyer, cradled one of the youngest
partygoers, 3-month-old Anica Bilisoly.
   After four years of trying to have a baby, Bilisoly and his
wife, Vickie Bowdoin, succeeded on their first attempt at in-vitro
fertilization.
   ``I don't know if we would have done it again. It's expensive,''
Ms. Bowdoin said. The couple just paid the institute's $6,000 bill,
none of it covered by insurance.
   ``You just have to cross your fingers and hope for the best,''
Ms. Bowdoin said. ``I really think it's a roll of the dice.''
   Like other in-vitro parents, Bilisoly and Ms. Bowdoin said they
plan to tell their daughter that she was conceived in a laboratory.
   ``I think I'll have her first formal portrait taken holding her
petri dish,'' Ms. Bowdoin said.

<TEXT>
   Egypt regained its seat on a major Arab
institution Saturday, taking a firm step back into the Arab fold 10
years after it was ostracized for signing a peace treaty with
Israel.
   With dissension only from Libya, the 11-member Organization of
Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries voted to reinstate Egypt.
   The vote was the clearest signal to date that Egypt was likely
to be allowed into a May 23-24 Arab summit in Casablanca, Morocco.
Egypt's participation would be tantamount to regaining its place in
the Arab League, sources say.
   Egypt was forced out of the 22-member Arab League and most
affiliated institutions after it signed the 1979 Camp David accords
with Israel. The boycott gradually eroded with restoration of
bilateral ties by most Arab countries and reinstatement of Egypt in
several specialized affiliate bodies of the Arab League.
   Only Syria and Libya have taken a hard line against readmitting
Cairo to the Arab fold.
   At the opening session of the Kuwait-based OAPEC conference
Saturday, chairman Mana Saeed Otaiba, the oil minister of the
United Arab Emirates, called for reinstating Egypt.
   ``The Arab family will remain incomplete as long as Egypt
remains outside,'' Otaiba said.
   Syria recently has moderated its stance against Egypt.
   ``I think that no Arab will oppose Egypt's return to Arab
organizations because Egypt is a sister state,'' said Syrian oil
minister, Mutanius Habib shortly after arriving.
   The conference communique mentioned that Libyan oil minister
Fawzi Shakshouki expressed reservations about readmitting Egypt but
did not say what they were.
   Shakshouki said before the conference began that Libya still
opposed Egypt's reinstatement and said his country would continue
to do so ``as long as the causes of its suspension did not vanish.''
   OAPEC was founded in 1968 by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Libya as a
forum for promoting Arab oil policies. Other members are Iraq, the
United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Algeria, Tunisia, Bahrain, Syria and
Egypt. The first seven countries also sit on the 13-nation
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

   Hundreds of people on Saturday demonstrated for the
elimination of nuclear weapons to prevent another accident like the
recently disclosed loss of a U.S. nuclear bomb near Japan 24 years
ago.
   About 500 demonstrators marched through downtown Tokyo with a
dummy nuclear bomb and banners reading ``Remove nuclear arms'' and
``Let's repeal the U.S.-Japan security treaty.''
   The U.S. military said Monday that an A-4 Skyhawk jet carrying
the bomb fell off the U.S. aircraft carrier Ticonderoga in 1965
about 80 miles from a small island in southern Okinawa.
   Japan, the only nation ever attacked with nuclear weapons, is
especially sensitive about any kind of danger from nuclear arms,
and the disclosure has revived debate on the role of U.S. forces in
Japan.
   ``I got really angry when I heard about the U.S. accident,''
said demonstrator Hajime Takahashi, who was a victim of the U.S.
atomic bombing of Hiroshima near the end of World War II.
   ``No one can make accident-proof nuclear weapons,'' said
Takahashi, 62.
   Following the rally, sponsored by the Japan Council Against
Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, anti-nuclear protesters began a march
from Tokyo to Hiroshima, 430 miles southwest of Tokyo.
   Organizers said the marchers were scheduled to arrive in
Hiroshima on Aug. 4, shortly before the anniversary of the 1945
bombing.
   About 60,000 U.S. soldiers are based in Japan under the
U.S.-Japan mutual security treaty.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush has been drifting away from the
go-it-alone Latin American policies favored by the previous
administration and his cautious approach was underscored in
addressing the crisis in Panama.
   Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker appear to have
concluded that the Reagan administration failed to achieve its
goals in the region because it refused to take into account the
wishes of either the Congress or of hemispheric countries.
   So the emphasis has been on working with both in the hopes of
coming up with more effective policies. A bipartisan agreement with
the Congress already is in place on Nicaragua and Bush consulted
closely with lawmakers this past week after the situation in Panama
became tumultuous.
   Bush said the will of the Panamanian people was thwarted by
``massive fraud'' in the immediate aftermath of Sunday's election
and by the subsequent decision of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to
throw out the returns. He also condemned the violence directed at
opposition leaders on Wednesday.
   In support of the American ``commitment to democracy'' in
Panama, Bush announced a seven-step plan the following day which
won plaudits from both the Democratic and Republican leadership of
both houses of Congress.
   But little of what Bush did seemed to pose a threat to Noriega.
Some of the measures will have no effect at all, including the
president's recall of Ambassador Arthur Davis.
   A recall of an ambassador is often used in diplomacy to register
displeasure with the country in question but Davis has had no
contact at all with the Noriega-led government in more than 14
months.
   On Saturday, however, Bush seemed to be trying to turn up the
heat on Noriega by Noriega, saying, ``The Panamanian people should
do everything to get him out of office.''
   Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One, the president
declined to back away from his words when reporters raised
questions about the strength of his language.
   ``No, I would add no words of caution,'' Bush replied. ``The
will of the people should be implemented.''
   At another point, the president said: ``I would love to see him
out of there, we'd like to see him out. The will of the people
should not be thwarted by this man and his ... thugs.''
   He said he was making the statement to make clear to the
Panamanian people that they still had the affection of the United
States.
   He said sending additional U.S. military personnel into Panama
should not be viewed as outside intervention and said ``we would
have good relations with the Panamanian people and the PDF'' _ the
military _ if Noriega were thrown from office.
   The most controversial measure announced by Bush was the
dispatch of a brigade of American military personnel but he linked
that move to the need to protect American citizens in Panama, not
to promote democracy there.
   No new economic sanctions were announced against Panama. Bush
merely said existing sanctions will continue in force.
   Bush ruled out a more heavy-handed approach, realizing there are
few issues around which Latin Americans rally more quickly than
opposition to U.S. interventionism. Thus, Bush rejected use of
force against Noriega as well as the scrapping of the Panama Canal
treaties.
   There was little support in the administration for a total trade
embargo against Panama. That approach would set back Panama's
economy for years _ damaging U.S. investment in the process _ with
no guarantee Noriega would be forced out,
   Bush appeared to place his strongest hopes for a democratic
outcome in Panama on diplomacy but made it clear the United States
will leave it to other countries to take the lead.
   ``The United States strongly supports, and will cooperate with
initiatives taken by governments in this hemisphere to address the
crisis,'' Bush said.
   Less than 24 hours after Bush spoke, the Organization of
American States permanent council convened to take up a Venezuelan
proposal to hold an OAS foreign ministers meeting on the Panama
situation.
   At the conclusion of the two-hour session, the 31 delegates
unanimously approved a meeting for this coming Wednesday. This will
be perhaps the first major test for Bush and Baker's stated
preference for diplomatic approaches.
   In a speech two weeks ago, Baker alluded to the widespread
desire for the United States to forgo unilateral measures but
cautioned alternative approaches may have drawbacks as well.
   ``All those who advocate diplomacy and political solutions to
the region's conflicts now have a responsibility to prove this is
the best and the surest route to achieve our common goals,'' he
said.
   Privately, U.S. officials are skeptical that the OAS meeting
will conclude with an unambiguous condemnation of Noriega's rule in
Panama.
   Although the OAS charter calls representative democracy ``an
indispensable condition'' for peace in the hemisphere, it also
stresses that the principle of non-intervention must be respected
as well.
   This latter point was emphasized repeatedly during Friday's
permanent council meeting, with countries as diverse as Chile,
Mexico and Nicaragua alluding to it.
   In the days prior to the meeting, U.S. delegates will be
lobbying hard for a resolution which, at a minimum, denounces
Noriega, while other delegates will be attempting to promote as
bland a declaration as possible.
   It is generally agreed that failure by the OAS to confront
Noriega squarely on the events of this past week could lead to a
reassessment of the administration's goal of governing on the basis
of broad consensus rather than unilateral action.

<TEXT>
   Soviet soldiers, who first arrived
21 years ago to crush political reforms, began a partial pullout
Saturday that generated little apparent enthusiasm among the
country's communist leaders.
   State-run media noted tersely that a Soviet battalion stationed
in the north Moravian city of Olomouc, close to the border with
Poland, left for home early Saturday.
   Local Communist Party officials bade the departing 6.5-mile
column farewell in a short ceremony, the reports said. It was not
known how many troops left Saturday.
   The little attention given to the departure contrasted markedly
with the treatment given the Soviet pullout from neighboring
Hungary. In an opposition march through Budapest in March, some
100,000 people called for a complete withdrawal of Soviet troops
and greater independence from Moscow.
   The withdrawals come as part of a pullout of 50,000 Soviet
troops and 5,000 tanks from East Germany, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia announced by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
in December.
   Overall, the Red Army is to withdraw half a million men over the
next two years in a unilateral reduction seen by Western analysts
as directed at aiding new talks in Vienna on reducing conventional
forces in Europe.
   The estimated 80,000 Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia began
entering the country on Aug. 20, 1968 in a Warsaw Pact invasion
that crushed reforms ushered in by then-Communist Party leader
Alexander Dubcek.
   The invasion led eventually to Dubcek's ouster and the expulsion
of almost half a million communists from Czechoslovakia's ruling
party.
   Under the current withdrawal, 5,300 Soviet troops, 708 tanks and
20 planes are to leave for the Soviet Union. Only four battalions _
some 1,500 men _ will depart this year, according to figures given
in February by Czechoslovak chief of staff Gen. Miroslav Vacek.
   The partial Soviet pullout began in Hungary last month with the
departure of 31 T-64 tanks.

   Flatbed trucks laden with armored
personnel carriers rumbled down a central Louisiana highway
Saturday on the first stage of a trip to Panama.
   The equipment will be used by more than 700 soldiers from Fort
Polk who began leaving early Saturday for the troubled Central
American nation.
   The atmosphere was businesslike at a lot where 53 track-driven
personnel carriers were driven from a concrete loading dock onto
trucks and across Fort Polk. The trucks and Jeeps then headed out
in convoys for Texas.
   Some of the camouflage-clad soldiers admitted to a touch of
nerves at being part of what base historian David Bingham said was
the first potential combat assignment for the 5th Infantry Division
(Mechanized) since its activation at Fort Polk in the mid-1970s.
   ``My dad told me, `Don't be a hero,''' Spec. Casey Cooper of
Houma said as he loaded one of his unit's trucks for the 100-mile
trip to Beaumont, Texas, where the vehicles were to be loaded on
the Navy cargo ship Bellatrix.
   The Fort Polk contingent, which includes about 20 women, is
among nearly 2,000 soldiers whom President Bush ordered to Panama
to help protect U.S. citizens from post-election violence. The
largest single group, nearly 1,000, left Friday from Ford Ord,
Calif.
   ``I hope and pray that they are not going to get into a position
where there's actual combat. I hope that their presence is all that
is required down there to do whatever it is that we need to do,''
said Maj. Gen. James R. Taylor, the division commander.
   Sgt. Celso Diaz, 23, of New York City said he wasn't going and
envied those who were.
   ``Everybody would like to go. It's the chance of a lifetime,''
he said.
   Friday evening, 140 soldiers kissed spouses goodbye, held
children up in the fading light and made early Mother's Day
telephone calls. Some punched each others' arms and exchanged
``high fives.''
   Some of them had already flown to Panama on Saturday morning,
before the convoys of those going by ocean rolled out the gate at
Fort Polk, according to Maj. Terrance Hall, a spokesman for the
base.
   Only 12 of the soldiers driving to Beaumont were to get on the
Bellatrix with the trucks, armored personnel carriers and mortar
carriers, Hall said.
   The remaining roughly 575 will fly to Panama early in the week
so that they will arrive at the same time as their equipment, he
said.
   Soldiers strapping armored vehicles onto flatbeds or readying
the convoys said they had been told the assignment in Panama could
last anywhere from one to six months.
   Army Capt. Bill McKinney at the Beaumont port said he did not
know when the Bellatrix was scheduled to leave.

   A widower and his 11 children have sued
police because the man's wife collapsed and died of a heart attack
when officers chased a burglary suspect into the family's house.
   State Rep. Willie Singleton filed the lawsuit Friday on behalf
of Jeffrey Taylor and his children.
   Taylor's wife, 58-year-old Dorothy May Taylor, died March 29,
five days after she collapsed from a heart attack during
questioning about Dexter Samuels, who had run into her house during
a chase.
   The officers, armed with guns and sticks, went in after him
without Mrs. Taylor's permission, the suit alleges.
   The city attorney's office said in a statement Wednesday that
Mrs. Taylor told officers, ``Get him out of here, he does not
belong here.'' That gave the officers permission to enter, the
statement said.
   The lawsuit charges that the four officers had been asked to
enter quietly because Mrs. Taylor had heart problems, but that they
had ignored the warning and pushed Mrs. Taylor aside as they dashed
in.

<HEAD>Five Injured in Ethnic Brawl</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A brawl between 300 Armenians and Azerbaijanis
injured five people in continued ethnic strife in the region, the
official Tass news agency said Saturday.
   The fight on Wednesday night in Stepanakert, capital of
Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan, was
accompanied by continuing strikes, Tass said. It did not give more
details.
   More than 90 people died in ethnic clashes in the neighboring
republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan last year, stemming in part
from Armenian demands for annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh. On
Thursday, 300,000 Armenians demonstrated in their capital of
Yerevan to demand action on the dispute.
   Arkady Volsky, the Kremlin's hand-picked administrator for the
area, confronted ``700 extremely agitated people'' in Stepanakert's
central square Thursday night and calmed them before the crowd
turned violent, the news agency said.
   Volsky appeared on local television Friday night to appeal for
an end to the strikes that are hampering his attempts to ease
economic problems in the area. He said desperately needed housing
construction has been halted, and a water-well drilling team from
central Russia was unable to work because its equipment was held up
by the work stoppages.
   Tass accused the activists of trying to close a clinic and to
involve schoolchildren in the strikes.

   Jimmy Carter's role in the Panamanian election
crisis has thrust him back onto the international stage eight years
after leaving the presidency, and he says his relationship with
President Bush is ``infinitely better'' than his relationship with
President Reagan.
   Carter, a frequent and harsh critic of Reagan after losing to
him in the 1980 election, lead a team of international observers
monitoring the national elections in Panama last week and later
briefed Bush at the White House.
   Panama was one of the topics that most bitterly divided Carter
and Reagan, so Carter's role in helping to serve as Bush's eyes and
ears in the Central American nation vividly illustrates the change
in his relationship from one administration to the next.
   Carter said in an interview Friday that Bush was receptive to
what he had to say even though he wasn't part of the official team
of observers chosen by the president.
   ``It's infinitely better,'' he said. ``I had no relationship
with President Reagan at all.''
   Carter's statements in Panama, in which he accused the
government there of stealing the election, drew international
attention.
   Those who haven't followed Carter's activities may have thought
he was re-emerging from a somnolent retirement. But in fact, the
former president has been an active, if unofficial, player in world
affairs since he left Washington in 1981.
   Operating mainly out of the Carter Presidential Center in
Atlanta, he has pursued favorite causes and offered the resources
of his facility as an aid in mediating international disputes.
   ``I don't care for any official role,'' said Carter, speaking
from his hometown of Plains, Ga. ``I'm operating now in the same
way that I've been for the last six or seven years. I think if I
had an official role to play, it might hamper my freedom and limit
greatly what influence or access I do have.''
   In the past few years, Carter has maintained an active schedule
of speaking and traveling. In the past year alone, according to the
Carter Center, he has been to Africa, Japan, Sweden, Norway, the
Netherlands, Venezuela and Panama.
   The Panamanian situation has special importance to Carter. In
1977, Carter signed an agreement with the late Gen. Omar Torrijos
under which Panama is due to take control of the Panama Canal in
1999.
   ``Carter views the Panama Canal treaties as one of his most
significant achievements, and all this represents some threat to
his achievements,'' said Gary Fink, a history professor at Georgia
State University.
   Although some observers have questioned whether the United
States should still honor the treaty with Noriega's abuses of
power, Carter said in Panama last week that the United States would
alienate the Panamanian people and ``every other nation in this
hemisphere'' if it abrogated the pact.
   The Panama Canal Treaty was bitterly opposed by conservatives in
the United States, Reagan foremost among them, and Carter's return
to the limelight opened some old wounds for those who worked
against the pact.
   Kevin Phillips, a conservative political analyst in Bethesda,
Md., suggested that Carter's presence in Panama last week amounted
to his ``returning to the scene of a political crime.''
   ``A crumbling Panama is a fitting place for Carter to
re-emerge,'' he added. ``It will be difficult for him to be taken
seriously once we move along.''
   But Carter apparently is being taken seriously by the Bush
administration.
   In one sign of respect that would have been unthinkable in the
Reagan uears, Secretary of State James Baker III was a main speaker
last month at a Carter Center conference on Latin America.
   In recent speeches, Carter, a Democrat, has commented favorably
on the Republican Bush. And he has expressed agreement with Bush's
response to the situation in Panama, which included the dispatching
of additional U.S. troops.

<HEAD>Motion Filed to Halt Pupil Assignment Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys in the 1974 Boston school desegregation
case are seeking a court order to block a new student assignment
plan that they fear could lead to further exodus of white students
from inner-city schools.
   The lawyers, Thomas Atkins and Robert Pressman, filed a motion
Friday with U.S. District Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr., asking him
to intervene and stop the student assignment plan.
   ``As this plan is now drafted, it will result in rapid
resegregation of the schools in minority neighborhoods,'' Atkins
said. ``Whites will choose schools near their homes because they'll
have no basis to choose schools elsewhere.''
   City officials and the School Committee devised the plan in an
attempt to end 15 years of court-ordered busing. It would divide
the city into three zones and allow parents to choose a school
within their zone, as long as student populations remain within
racial balance.
   Busing was violently opposed in Boston when Garrity ordered it
in the mid-1970s. Supporters of the new plan say the competition
among schools would spur improvement, lure whites back to the
system and cut long bus rides.
   But opponents say it could be a back door to segregation and
won't work without more money to improve the overall system. Boston
schools now are struggling with a budget crunch.
   Boston School Committee President Thomas O'Reilly defended the
plan.
   ``The School Committee has been informed by our legal staff
there's nothing unconstitutional about what we've done,'' he said.
``We will defend it to every degree possible.''
   Mayor Raymond Flynn was active in creation of the plan and
pushed for its implementation this fall. He said parents want more
say in their children's education.
   ``It is unfortunate that, once again, Boston parents have to
deal with the uncertainties of a legal proceeding,'' he said.
   The plan was approved 9-4 by the School Committee, with all four
of the committee's black members voting against it.
   At that time, Atkins and Pressman agreed to take part in a
90-day review that ended last week. Atkins said Friday that the
plan was implemented too quickly and parents didn't get enough
information to make good choices.
   The plan is scheduled to begin for students entering elementary
schools this fall, and parents of those children already have
received applications for schools.
   Critics of the plan say more time is needed for parents to
understand how to choose their children's school.
   ``There's so much confusion out there now,'' said Hattie
McKinnis, head of the Citywide Parents Council, which has voted to
recommend a one-year delay of the plan.

<HEAD>Probe of Los Angeles Mayor Continues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Tom Bradley authorized a bank to handle
more than $1 million in transportation funds in 1984, five years
before the date he claimed he first learned the bank had any
business with the city, a federal document revealed.
   The document, obtained from the federal Urban Mass
Transportation Administration, was an authorization form signed by
Bradley in 1984 that allowed $1,339,230 in federal transportation
funds earmarked for Los Angeles to be deposited in Far East
National Bank.
   The document was obtained by the Los Angeles Herald Examiner and
passed on to City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores. The councilwoman
introduced it during hearings Friday on Bradley's financial
dealings.
   Bradley, who was paid $18,000 last year for his work as an
adviser to Far East National Bank, has said he didn't know until
earlier this year that the bank had any dealings with the city.
   Bradley's financial dealings with Far East and with Valley
Federal Savings &amp; Loan, which paid him $24,000 a year as a board
member until he resigned earlier this year, are being investigated
by City Attorney James Hahn.
   Also Friday, Hahn's office confirmed it has launched a second
investigation of Bradley, this one to determine whether the mayor
accepted illegal contributions during his re-election campaign
earlier this year. Bradley won in a landslide.
   ``I can say that we have asked the city clerk to provide us with
information regarding some campaign contributions from the recently
concluded mayoral campaign,'' said Mike Qualls, a spokesman for
Hahn.
   City Clerk Elias Martinez said Hahn ordered him to audit certain
contributions made to Bradley. He declined to elaborate.
   Bradley spokesman Bill Chandler said he was unaware of the city
attorney's latest probe. He said Bradley would not discuss it.
   ``The responsibility would seem to fall on the people who
contribute and not the mayor for accepting the money,'' he said.
   Friday's hearing by the City Council's Governmental Operations
committee, at which the transportation funds document was
discussed, was held to review the status of Hahn's probe into
Bradley's finances.
   Chandler said the mayor would not answer any questions about his
involvement with Far East until Hahn has completed that
investigation.

   ``Nimrod Dancer,'' the name of the operation
that dispatched 2,000 U.S. combat troops to Panama, is the latest
in a long list of fanciful, hokey and sometimes incongruous codes
used by the Pentagon to describe its missions.
   ``Nimrod Dancer _ didn't he come in seventh at the Kentucky
Derby?'' a Pentagon official was overheard to wonder when word of
the operation's code name was announced Thursday.
   Nimrod, the Bible tells us, was a mighty hunter. Was he a dancer
too?
   ``No,'' said Lt. Kathy Woods, a Pentagon spokeswoman. ``These
names aren't supposed to mean anything. They have absolutely no
significance on the face of it.''
   To make sure the names are totally random, a computer picks
them, Woods said.
   But once chosen, the combination of words, the number of their
syllables or some other pattern does have significance for ``those
who need to know,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Jim Kudla.
   Or, as explained in The Encyclopedia of Code Names of World War
II, codes serve ``as a type of mental shorthand for those in the
know and to obfuscate the issue for those not in the know.''
   Winston Churchill, the master tactician who led the Allies to
victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, may not have approved of
the way codes are selected nowadays. In instructions to Gen. Sir
Hastings Ismay in August 1943, Churchill wrote:
   ``Operations ought not to be described by code words which imply
a boastful and overconfident sentiment. ... They ought not to be
names of frivolous characters. They should not be ordinary words.
Names of living people should be avoided.''
   The Pentagon also avoids the names of living people for
operation names. But what would Churchill have made of Operation
``Urgent Fury,'' the code name for the U.S. invasion of the
Caribbean island of Grenada in 1983 to counter a Cuban-backed coup
and evacuate American medical students?
   While names like ``Urgent Fury'' may sound inspirational, their
aim is purely operational. ``You have to have a code name to use in
communications during an operation,'' said Barry Blechman, an
expert on defense issues at the School of Advance International
Studies of Johns Hopkins University.
   Major operations have different code names for each component,
he said. ``One must be precise. If you use the wrong name, you
could land a unit at the wrong place or bomb the wrong target.''
   Before computers got in on the act, some operation names
actually had meaning the public at large could understand.
   For instance, an operation mounted in 1968 by the 196th Light
Infantry Brigade in Vietnam was code named ``Attleboro,'' after the
town in Massachusetts where the unit had trained.
   In a more figurative although still understandable name,
Operation Niagara in January 1968 conducted an average of 300
bombings daily in support of a besieged Marine base at Khe Sanh,
Vietnam. The bombs rained down like a water fall, get it?
   Former President Nixon liked to keep his hand in on code name
selections during the Vietnam War. There was Linebacker One, for a
bombing operation, and then Linebacker Two for another one.
   In the old days, some names appeared to reflect the portentous
character of the operation, like a drumbeat roll. One of the most
famous World War II code names was ``Operation Overlord,'' the U.S.
landing on the coast of Normandy as part of the Allied
counteroffensive that rolled back Nazi forces from Western Europe.
   Animals seem to be a favorite for code names of recent years.
   Operation ``Golden Pheasant'' was the 1988 deployment of 3,200
U.S. troops in Honduras as a show of force against an alleged
Nicaraguan incursion into Honduras.
   ``Praying Mantis,'' the insect that eats other insects, was the
name used for the 1988 operation in which U.S. gunboats and
aircraft destroyed or sank six Iranian naval vessels and two oil
platforms in retaliation for a mine attack on a U.S. ship.
   And in the same waters, ``Earnest Will'' was the operation in
which U.S. Navy ships escorted Kuwaiti oil tankers in 1987 to
protect them against attacks by Iran which was at war with Iraq.
Some servicemen believed the name described the fortitude needed to
undertake the dangerous mission, said a Pentagon official.
   ``Eagle Claw'' was the disastrous 1980 operation to rescue
American hostages in Iran. The mission was aborted after a U.S.
helicopter collided with a C-130 transport aircraft and eight
servicemen were killed in the ensuing fire at a remote staging area
code-named Desert One.
   Then there was ``Eldorado Canyon'' _ the U.S. bombing of Libyan
targets in April 1986 in which an F-111 fighter was shot down and
its two crew members killed.

   An eight-member international team has reached
within a day's walk from the North Pole on a 620-mile trek to
underscore the dangers of global pollution, the mission's
headquarters said Saturday.
   The mission's co-ordinating office in this Canadian capital said
the team was expected to complete its trip and return Monday by
plane to Ellesmere Island in the Northwest Territories. It began
its journey there March 20.
   The current mission, known as Icewalk, was designed to be
different from previous expeditions by making use of only human
power. The group planned its mission with skies and sledges for
supplies, but without dogsleds or skimobiles.
   Along the way, the team has done tests for pollution in an
effort to publicize the dangers of global warming, known as the
greenhouse effect, and of Arctic pollution.
   The group includes members from the United States, Canada,
Australia, Japan, the Soviet Union, and West Germany.
   Its leader is Robert Swan, a British explorer who walked to the
South Pole with two other men in 1986. A successful completion of
the current trip would make him the first person on record to walk
to both poles.

   Powerful thunderstorms whipped across Texas and Louisiana on
Saturday and scattered showers dampened the Plains and Rockies.
Snow fell on both Yosemite and Yellowstone national parks.
   A tornado was reported near Knox City, Texas, and a tornado
watch was posted for a large part of central Texas, including the
Dallas-Fort Worth area. The severe thunderstorms that pummeled
central Texas were the result of daytime heat meeting cold weather
aloft.
   Thunderstorms also were scattered across the lower Mississippi
Valley, with an intense thunderstorm along the Louisiana coast late
in the morning.
   Widely scattered showers reached from the central Plains to the
northern and central Rockies. Snow fell at Yellowstone National
Park in northwest Wyoming and was forecast near the north rim of
Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona.
   Moderate to heavy snow closed the road leading to the east
entrance of Yosemite National Park in California.
   Scattered rain continued in the Northeast, prompting a flash
flood watch for most of Maine, where recent rains have totaled 6
inches in some areas.
   A low pressure system was blamed for cloudy, cool weather from
western Pennsylvania across Ohio, Indiana and southern Michigan.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 37
degrees at Butte, Mont., to 91 degrees at Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
   The low in the nation Saturday morning was 17 degrees at
Gunnison, Colo.
   Record low temperatures for the date were recorded in a few
cities, including 34 degrees in Asheville, N.C., 41 in Augusta,
Ga., 38 in Greer, S.C., 60 in Hollywood, Fla., and 38 in Knoxville,
Tenn.
   The forecast for Sunday called for rain across New England, the
Appalachians, the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes. Showers and
thunderstorms were expected from Florida across the Gulf Coast
states to the Tennessee and middle Mississippi valleys, and from
eastern Texas across the central Plains to the northern and central
Rockies. Widely scattered thunderstorms were forecast for the
intermountain region.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 50s over the
northern and central Rockies and the central Appalachians, and into
the 80s from coastal South Carolina to Florida and from Louisiana
across most of Texas to the desert Southwest. Elsewhere, highs were
expected in the 60s and 70s.

<HEAD>Find of Painting from Germany Highlights US Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pair of newly discovered 400-year-old German
paintings highlights a collection belonging to Sen. John Heinz,
R-Pa., that goes on display Sunday at the National Gallery of Art.
   The finding of the two paintings was reported by Ingvar
Bergstroem, a leading authority on northern European art who
teaches at the University of Goeteborg in Sweden.
   Bergstroem said Hana Seifertova of the Prague National Gallery
turned up the two paintings in poor condition at the little-known
Slovak National Gallery in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia.
   The paintings date from 1595, but generally are considered as
belonging to the 17th century because of their style.
   ``They are some of the most important paintings done in Germany
in their century,'' Bergstroem said in an interview.
   He explained that although an earlier period had been rich in
German painters, including Albrecht Duerer, artistic activity in
Germany was slow at the time because of intense religious war.
   The two newly found paintings are believed part of a set of
four, representing the seasons, done in Frankfurt, Germany. There
were two collaborating artists, Lucas van Valckenborch, from
Flanders in what is now Belgium, and Georg Flegel, who came from
Olomouc (Olmuetz) in what is now Czechoslovakia. Though called
still life paintings, they include large and colorful human figures
and are themselves unusually large _ about 47 by 75 inches.
   The paintings represent Summer and Autumn. Van Valckenborch
painted the figures and Flegel the still life parts.
   In the Heinz collection ``Still Lifes of the Golden Age,'' the
``Allegory of Summer'' is almost precisely like one of the two
newly discovered paintings. Bergstroem said he believes that
picture was part of a set painted earlier than the set containing
the two found in Bratislava.
   Autumn looks like a fat hunter with game birds hanging from his
belt and a handsome young woman in a starched ruff.
   ``It may be the same model as in Summer,'' said Bergstroem.
   There are also great baskets of fruit and vegetables, and two
highly detailed landscapes in the background. When first found it
was so covered with grime that only the woman's head and few
baskets of fruit could be easily made out. It has now been restored.
   Bergstroem hopes some day a complete set of four can be
assembled in a single exhibit.
   For now, visitors to the National Gallery's East Building can
see Summer and 43 other paintings from the Heinz collection _
mostly flowers and food _ by painters of the 17th century from the
Netherlands, Flanders and Germany. Heinz, who belongs to the
food-manufacturing family, started buying them when he was a
student.
   Bergstroem says it is the biggest of the world's four main
collections of its kind. The show will remain at the National
Gallery until Sept. 4, then will go to the Museum of Fine Arts in
Boston from Oct. 18 to Dec. 31.

<HEAD>Doctor, Fired for Praying With Patients, Claims Rights Violated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A doctor who says he was fired by a hospital
for praying at patients' bedsides has filed a civil rights
complaint accusing the institution of religious discrimination.
   Dr. Ju Woong Jung, 51, said in the complaint filed with the
state Civil Rights Commission this month that he had prayed with
patients for 10 years while on the staff of St. Luke's Hospital
with no problems.
   Jung was fired in February by hospital President Frank Bartell
III, who cited him for insubordination and willful neglect of duty.
Hospital officials said the dismissal followed repeated warnings
about praying with patients.
   In his complaint, the Korean-born Baptist said he fulfilled his
duties to his patients and that he discussed his beliefs and prayed
with patients only with their consent in order to comfort them.
   Bartell said Saturday that attorneys had advised him not to
comment on the matter. ``However, as you well know, there are two
sides to every story,'' he said.
   Bartell said the hospital, once affiliated with the Lutheran
church, is owned by a non-profit private organization ``with a
Christian commitment'' but not tied to any religious denomination.
   St. Luke's has no formal policy on staff members praying with
patients, he said.
   Jung said he began praying with patients in 1974. ``Everybody
knows I pray,'' he said.
   In 1981, the hospital gave Jung a Courtesy in Action award for
``reflecting Christ's love.''
   Six years later, Bartell told the doctor to seek patients'
permission to pray with them. Jung agreed to do so.
   The physician said his dismissal stemmed from an incident in
January and another in February.
   In the first case, Jung said he discussed Christ but did not
pray with a 14-year-old patient after noting the boy's religious
denomination on his medical form.
   In the second case, he said, he went to Dr. Marion Detrick's
room on Feb. 10 when Detrick complained of chest pains, ordered
pain medication and an electrocardiogram, then suggested prayer.
   ``I wanted to comfort him,'' Jung said. He said Detrick agreed.
   However, St. Luke's said Jung's Bible reading became prolonged
and distracting and distressed Detrick. Detrick said in a written
account of the incident that he asked Jung to stop and Jung did.
   In firing Jung, the hospital also cited a Feb. 6 incident in
which Jung treated a patient with acupuncture, which St. Luke's
does not permit. Jung has acknowledged he used acupuncture, but
said it only happened once and is not the central issue in his
dismissal.
   In 1986, another doctor complained that Jung upset a terminally
ill patient and the man's wife by asking him if he believed in
Jesus and wanted to pray.
   Jung was also suspended for three days in 1986 for incidents in
October and November of that year in which he discussed religious
beliefs with two patients. He prayed with only one.
   The Christian Medical and Dental Society, which represents
doctors who profess faith in Christ, believes spiritual issues are
a crucial part of health, said Hal Habecker, director of the
Richardson, Texas-based organization.
   ``You do need to be careful in this culture to ask permission,''
Habecker said. ``You don't have the right to run up and down
hospital corridors and force Jesus on other people in that sense.''

<HEAD>Jewish Group Cancels Meeting With Pope in Flap Over Convent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Jewish leaders canceled a meeting with
Pope John Paul II after the Vatican said it would not discuss a
Roman Catholic convent at Auschwitz that has offended many Jews, a
group official said Saturday.
   Jewish groups are upset about the presence of a dozen Carmelite
nuns on the site of the Nazi death camp in Poland, which has become
a memorial to the 6 million Jews murdered in the Holocaust.
   Rabbi David Rosen of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith
said group members from the United States and Israel were to meet
the pope Friday at the Vatican for three purposes: to compliment
his recent document on racism, to ask him to consider the situation
of Jews in upcoming documents, and to discuss the Auschwitz dispute.
   But Rosen said that in talks last week at the Vatican, Cardinal
Johannes Willebrands of the Pontifical Council for the Promotion of
Christian Unity said church leaders had not approved of the agenda.
   ``He indicated that things couldn't go ahead under those
terms,'' the Jerusalem-based representative said in a telephone
interview in Rome. ``We decided we're not going to hide our
agenda.''
   He said the Anti-Defamation League, which originally requested
the meeting, decided to put if off indefinitely.
   ``It was obvious if everyone was insistent, there was going to
be a clash,'' he said.
   He added, however, that his group remains ``completely committed
to the continuity of the dialogue'' between the faiths. He said the
disagreement would not hinder fruitful discussion of other issues.
   A Vatican spokesman could not be reached for comment Saturday.
   Jewish leaders have expressed outrage that the Carmelite convent
has remained at the Polish site of the death camp despite a 1987
pact with Roman Catholic leaders to move the convent by early this
year.
   Catholic leaders say the nuns' new quarters are not ready.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghan rebels said Saturday that
30,000 guerrillas are preparing to attack this capital city soon,
but the foreign minister of the Soviet-backed government scornfully
dismissed the claim.
   Officials in Kabul, however, said they wanted to extend a state
of emergency they had hoped not to renew. They cited a threat of
attack by neighboring Pakistan, where most of the rebels are based.
   The threat of an offensive against Kabul was reported by the
rebels' Afghan News Agency, which quoted guerrilla commander
Mohammad Nasir. Neither the news agency nor guerrilla sources in
Pakistan said exactly when the attack would be mounted.
   Nasir claimed that more than 1,000 ``employees'' of
Afghanistan's Marxist government had agreed to cooperate with the
U.S.-backed guerrillas.
   President Najib has insisted his forces are strong enough to
withstand a rebel onslaught.
   Moscow continues to arm the Kabul government, although the last
of more than 100,000 Red Army troops withdrew from Afghanistan on
Feb. 15 under a U.N.-brokered accord.
   The ruling communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan
seized power in a 1978 military coup, sparking the Moslem
insurgency which aims to establish an Islamic republic.
   The guerrillas have tried for the past nine weeks without
success to take the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad.
   In New Delhi, Afghan Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil dismissed the
threat of a similar attack on Kabul, which has been quiet in recent
weeks.
   ``They are welcome. We are looking forward (to this),'' Abdul
Wakil said in a mixture of English and Kabul's Dari Persian
language.
   Wakil met Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and other officials
during a 12-hour stop in New Delhi.
   The Afghan foreign minister said he expected India to increase
its shipments of food and medicine to Kabul, but he gave no dates
or figures. India is the only non-Soviet bloc country known to be
sending aid to Najib's Moscow-style government.
   The Afghan government also said Saturday the Council of Tribal
Elders will be convened this month and asked to extend the state of
emergency. It gave no date for the meeting, but the emergency rules
were to expire May 20.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said the
government had hoped to allow the emergency to expire. But he said
reports that Pakistan was planning to attack Jalalabad and the
southern city of Kandahar made an extension necessary.
   Najib declared the emergency Feb. 18, three days after the last
Soviet troops left Afghanistan. He said the government needed the
special authority because of the threat of foreign aggression and
subversive activities by the rebels.
   The elders, whose number varies from 1,200 to 3,000, include
regional officials, the mayor of Kabul, the prime minister, Supreme
Court members, the attorney general, and 50 people picked by the
president.
   In addition to adopting states of emergency, they are empowered
to amend the constiution, elect the president, and declare war.

   A British man was missing in Lebanon on
Saturday, hours after a group claimed to have taken a hostage to
win freedom for ``comrades'' jailed in the slaying of a Palestinian
cartoonist in London.
   Also Saturday, a German newspaper reported that a West German
man who disappeared in Lebanon on May 4 had signed a letter saying
he was abducted in connection with the case of TWA hijacker
Mohammed Ali Hamadi.
   There has been no claim of responsibility for the West German,
Markus Quint. The Bild am Sonntag newspaper said West German
security officials believe Quint was kidnapped by Hamadi associates.
   A Foreign Ministry official in Bonn said ``it would not be in
the interest of solving the case'' to comment on the newspaper
report.
   The missing Briton is 83-year-old Jack Mann, who disappeared in
Beirut on Friday.
   A previously unheard of group, The Cells of Armed Struggle, sent
a statement to a Western news agency a few hours after Mann was
last seen, claiming responsibility for an abduction but not
identifying the victim.
   In its Arabic statement, the group said: ``We declare our
readiness to immediately release the captive if the British
government announces the beginning of a fair trial for our comrades.
   ``We ask the British government to release our comrades detained
without evidence on charge of assassinating comrade Naji Al-Ali.''
   The Palestinian political cartoonist died Aug. 30, 1987, after
being shot outside the London offices of the Kuwaiti newspaper
Al-Qabas.
   The Cells of Armed Struggle claimed he ``died at the hands of
the (Israeli secret service) Mossad in cooperation with the British
intelligence to drive a wedge and deepen differences within
Palestinian ranks.''
   In London, Scotland Yard said no one has ever been arrested or
charged for the cartoonist's death and the murder remains unsolved.
The British Foreign Office said the Arabic statement is ``the only
indication we have so far that Mann may have been kidnapped.''
   Britain warned all its nationals out of Beirut after a string of
kidnappings, but the Manns said in a recent interview that after 40
years in the city they were too old to move and of little value as
hostages.
   Police said Mann was an air force pilot during World War II and
then worked as a pilot for Middle East Airlines, Lebanon's national
carrier. He also worked as a bartender at west Beirut's Pickwick
Pub after retiring from the airline, they said.
   Not counting Mann and Quint, there are 15 foreigners held
hostage in Lebanon, including nine Americans. The hostage held
longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press. He was seized March 16, 1985.
   Mann's wife, Sunny Mann, said her husband left their apartment
in the seaside Raouche area at 11 a.m. Friday to go to the British
Bank of the Middle East, a little over a mile away.
   An employee at the British Bank of the Middle East said Mann did
not enter the bank Friday.
   Sue Tucknott, vice consul at the British Embassy in east Beirut,
said the embassy had no information other than Mrs. Mann's report
that her husband had disappeared.
   Quint disappeared May 4 along with two other West German relief
workers in south Lebanon. The other two reappeared safely.
   Palestinian guerrilla leaders said unidentified kidnappers were
holding Quint in connection with the Hamadi case.
   Bild am Sonntag said the West German embassy in Lebanon received
a letter written in English and signed by Quint. It said a second
letter not signed by Quint was sent to West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
   ``In both letters it is indicated that the kidnapping is
connected to the trial of Hamadi,'' it said. ``The kidnappers are
demanding a mild sentence for Hamadi.''
   Hamadi faces life in prison if convicted of murder and air
piracy in the June 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner and the slaying
of an American sailor on board. He confessed to the hijacking but
denies taking part in the murder.
   He is on trial in Frankfurt, West Germany.

<HEAD>Polls Back Bush On Panama; Majority Support 1978 Treaty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two polls taken on the escalating Panama crisis
indicate a majority of Americans support President Bush's decision
to send troops to the Central American nation but are dubious about
using them.
   The polls also showed divided opinion on whether the U.S. should
honor a 1978 treaty that eventually turns over control of the
Panama Canal to Panama.
   A New York Times-CBS News poll taken over three days found that
on Tuesday and Wednesday, 39 percent of those surveyed supported
sending troops and 44 percent were opposed.
   But on Thursday, when three-fifths said they had heard about the
Panama crisis, 53 percent said they supported dispatching U.S.
troops while 34 percent were opposed.
   A Newsweek poll to be published Monday, however, found that 59
percent of those surveyed said they were against the use of
military force. Most Americans, 71 percent, trusted Bush to handle
the Panama crisis, the survey found.
   The Times-CBS poll also showed that 58 percent of those surveyed
said the United States should adhere to the Panama Canal treaty.
   The Newsweek poll, however, indicates that 51 percent said the
process of turning over control of the Panama Canal to Panama
should be stopped.
   In addition, the Newsweek poll indicated that 71 percent of
Americans think it is ``very important'' for the United States for
Noriega to give up power in Panama.
   Eighty-one percent said the best response would be to have other
nations in the region pressure Noriega into giving up power.
   The Newsweek poll of 750 adults nationwide has a margin of error
of plus or minus four percentage points. The Times-CBS News poll of
1,073 adults nationwide has a margin of error of plus or minus
three percentage points.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II embraced reform of the
Mass in an apostolic letter released Saturday but also warned of
``outlandish innovations'' and other excesses.
   The pope said the changes in church ceremonies mandated by the
Second Vatican Council of 1962-65 were intended to help renew the
Roman Catholic Church. He said the vast majority of pastors and
other Catholics have accepted the reforms with joy.
   ``The word of God is now better known in the Christian
communities,'' he wrote.
   However, the pontiff warned of ``outlandish innovations,
departing from the norms of the Apostolic See or the bishops.'' He
said such changes were ``disrupting the unity of the church and the
piety of the faithful and even on occasion contradicting matters of
faith.''
   The Second Vatican Council introduced the Mass in the language
of worshipers instead of Latin, and it called for the priest to
face the congregation rather than keep his back to it. Lay people
also were permitted to perform Bible readings.
   Some traditionalists resented the changes and fought to keep the
Latin, or Tridentine, Mass, which dates from Pope Pius V in 1570.
The Vatican has acknowledged their attachment to the old Mass but
has limited its use.
   Last year, Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre and a Swiss-based group of
traditionalists split with the church over the issue.
   In his letter, John Paul addressed the 25th anniversary of
``Sancrosanctum Concilium,'' the document on liturgical reform he
called the ``first fruit'' of Vatican II.
   The pope said the application of the reforms has been marked by
a ``tendency to see religious practice as something of a private
affair, by a certain rejection of institutions, by a decrease in
the visibility of the church in society, and by a calling into
question of personal faith.''
   He stressed that only the church hierarchy has the power to
alter the liturgy, not priests or other church groups. He said some
innovations could even affect the validity of the sacraments.
   ``On occasion, there have been noted illicit omissions or
additions, rites invented outside the framework of established
norms, postures or songs which are not conducive to faith or to a
sense of the sacred, abuses in the practice of general absolution
....'' he wrote.
   ``It cannot be tolerated that certain priests should take upon
themselves the right to compose eucharistic prayers or to
substitute profane readings for texts from sacred scripture.
   ``Initiatives of this sort, far from being linked with the
liturgical reform as such ... are in direct contradiction to it,
disfigure it and deprive the Christian people of the genuine
treasures of the liturgy of the church,'' he said.
   He called for bishops to root out such abuses.
   However, he encouraged continued adaptation of the liturgy to
different cultures and languages.
   He also appealed for church members ``to renew that spirit which
inspired the church'' during the early days of reform.

<TEXT>
   The image of a jet falling into the sea
off Japan while carrying a hydrogen bomb had become ``a dreamy
memory'' for a Navy veteran until the loss was disclosed more than
two decades later.
   Bud Dehnert said he watched in 1965 as the A-4E Skyhawk attack
jet slipped over the side of the aircraft carrier Ticonderoga after
a nuclear bomb 70 times more powerful than the one dropped on
Hiroshima had been loaded aboard the plane.
   Driving to work this week, the Boca Raton man heard a radio
report about newly released documents confirming the United States
lost the bomb in international waters about 70 or 80 miles from
Okinawa when he was a 21-year-old sailor on the carrier.
   ``There is a bomb at the bottom of the ocean with a plane
attached to it with a body in it,'' said Dehnert, the district
manager of a consumer electronics firm here.
   Pentagon officials have confirmed the accident but released few
details. The Japanese government requested an explanation and
Okinawans expressed anger over the secret handling of the loss in
nearby waters.
   Until the news reports, the accident had come to seem like ``a
dreamy memory,'' Dehnert said in an interview published Saturday in
the Sun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale.
   ``What I saw was real,'' said Dehnert, now 44. ``I saw it
happen.''
   Dehnert sat beside a stack of scrapbooks from his four years in
the Navy as he described the accident, pointing out his photo in a
yearbook on Ticonderoga cruises.
   ``It was 23 years ago. It was a beautiful day. The plane just
rolled backwards off the ship. There was no wind,'' he said.
   Stars and Stripes, the unofficial U.S. military newspaper,
reported Friday that brake failure or a distracted pilot may have
caused the jet to drop overboard as it was being prepared for
takeoff and being put on an elevator to the flight deck.
   The carrier was steaming toward Japan for a few days of rest
after combat in Vietnam, and Dehnert learned later that the pilot
was planning to meet his wife in Japan.
   ``The pilot was sitting there minding his own business, and the
ship took a slow roll into the ocean,'' he said. The plane
``trapped the pilot because it was a clamshell cockpit.''
   Dehnert said he and others on board knew the ship was carrying
nuclear wearpons, but the United States never admitted it publicly.
   Trying to reconstruct the events leading to the accident,
Dehnert said he thought a weapons-loading drill had just concluded,
and sailors were pushing the jet into place, about to chain it
down, when it flipped off the edge of the ship's port side. The
aircraft sank quickly and efforts to retrieve it failed.
   ``The plane hit the water. It was gone. It disappeared,''
Dehnert said.
   He said the accident was memorable for its unexpectedness.
   ``When people died, usually it was a hectic situation, a flight,
a landing,'' Dehnert said. ``But we were going to Japan, everyone
was relaxed. We were sunning ourselves.''

   The rear stairway door of a TWA jet
carrying 59 people opened in mid-flight Saturday, but the plane
flew the remaining 300 miles to its destination and landed safely,
an official said.
   The incident caused no pressure problems in the cabin of the
Boeing 727 en route from New York to Columbus because an inside
door separated the cabin from the outside air, said Paul Long, a
control tower supervisor at Port Columbus International Airport.
   The door that opened was attached to stairs and used as an
emergency exit or occasional alternate entrance to the plane, he
said.
   ``They (door and stairs) just dropped open,'' Long said. ``For
whatever reason, the latch did not hold it.''
   The plane was being repaired Saturday evening and was expected
to leave the Columbus airport for St. Louis at 6:50 p.m. _ an hour
late, said a TWA ticket agent who would not give his name.
   Long said Flight 402 had left New York's Kennedy Airport and was
flying over Pennsylvania about 4:30 p.m. with 51 passengers and
eight crew members aboard when the pilot radioed the tower to say
the stairway door had opened.
   The pilot indicated he would fly the remaining distance, Long
said.
   Firefighters were called to the Columbus airport runway and
crash equipment was brought out as a precaution, he said. The plane
landed safely about 5:15 p.m.
   ``The pilot wasn't excited, so I didn't get excited,'' Long said.

<HEAD>Panamanian Opposition Calls for General Strike, Isolation of Noriega</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with opposition calling for general
strike and diplomatic, political quarantine on Noriega regime. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition called Saturday for a
one-day general strike and asked the Organization of American
States to impose what amounts to a diplomatic and political
quarantine on Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``A general strike is a cry ... for democratic solidarity with
the people of Latin America and of the world,'' said first vice
presidential candidate Ricardo Arias Calderon.
   In a statement signed by Arias Calderon, presidential candidate
Guillermo Endara and second vice presidential candidate Guillermo
Ford, the opposition asked all Panamanians to back a strike on
Wednesday.
   ``We ask everyone at 12 noon of that day to go out on the
streets and protest in his own street or his own neighborhood,''
Arias Calderon said.
   The protest is to coincide with a meeting of the OAS in
Washington to discuss the Panamanian situation.
   Arias Calderon also asked people to protest the nullification of
May 7 election results after church services on Sunday.
   However, he did not say how they should protest, and he said
nothing of what opposition leaders would do Wednesday.
   President Bush, while flying to Columbus, Miss., urged
Panamanians and the nation's Defense Forces to ``do everything'' to
get rid of Noriega.
   ``The will of the people should not be thwarted by this man and
his ... thugs,'' Bush said. ``I would love to see them get him
out.''
   A Defense Forces spokesman refused immediate comment on Bush's
statement. A broadcast of the Bush interview on the U.S. armed
forces network was jammed. Bush, however, was audible.
   Meanwhile, newly arrived American troops increased security at
Howard Air Force Base and other installations under the roar of
giant C-5A jets bringing in more men and supplies.
   Planes bringing in about 1,900 troops ordered by Bush landed
throughout the day at the rate of about one every 30 minutes at
Howard, just outside the Panamanian capital. Medical supplies and
ambulances were among the equipment arriving.
   The estimated 10,000 American troops already stationed in Panama
have been ordered to avoid public areas except on official business
following post-election violence.
   Not everybody heeded the advice. Early Saturday, two U.S.
servicemen arrived at the apartment of their Panamanian girlfriends
intent on going to a disco.
   One, who has been in Panama two years, said he does it every
weekend.
   ``All that stuff you see on TV, I've never seen any of it,'' he
said.
   In its news conference Saturday, the opposition was careful to
say it would ``respect the integrity of the Defense Forces,'' a
suggestion that if the officer corps dumps Noriega, its positions
would be guaranteed.
   In answer to a question, Arias Calderon said the opposition
wanted three things from the OAS: condemnation of Noriega and an
appeal that he recognize the election results, diplomatic and
political sanctions that would amount to a quarantine, and a
mission of OAS foreign ministers to visit Panama and deliver the
resolutions to Noriega.
   The Democratic Opposition Alliance, a three-party coalition
challenging Noriega, said Endara had a 3-1 lead in election returns
over Noriega's hand-picked candidate, Carlos Duque.
   When the government nullified the vote, it claimed Duque was
leading Endara 2-1.
   Tensions increased Wednesday when thugs beat up Endara and his
two vice presidential candidates. Endara remained hospitalized
Saturday, but his injuries were not considered life-threatening.
   Arias Calderon said the opposition has names of 157 opposition
figures jailed since Wednesday in the Panama City area and that the
number may reach 300 nationwide.
   Ford said the opposition leaders will not go into hiding. ``We
will continue to lead, but not down the road that leads us to the
slaughterhouse,'' Ford said.
   The official Electoral Tribunal cited missing ballots and
alleged American interference in the campaign in justifying the
nullification.
   In a full-page advertisement in Saturday's La Estrella de
Panama, the Christian Democrats, the largest party in the
opposition, claimed that the Election Tribunal, as a partner in the
alleged vote fraud, lacks the moral authority to nullify the
elections.
   The newspaper is the only one left in Panama not screamingly
anti-American and pro-Noriega, and it is the only one that prints
opposition news or advertising.
   The United States recalled its ambassador, Arthur Davis, for
consultations after the vote was nullified. Davis is to leave for
Washington on Monday.
   Venezuela and Mexico also recalled their ambassadors and
countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America have called on Panama
to honor the election results.
   In Caracas, Venezuela, Foreign Minister Enrique Tejera Paris
denied a report Saturday in The Washington Post that President
Carlos Andres Perez had offered Noriega asylum.
   Noriega has not appeared in public since before the election. He
was indicted last year by federal grand juries in Miami and Tampa,
Fla., on drug charges. But he contends the charges are a U.S. ploy
to get rid of him in favor of someone who will help the United
States scrap the Panama Canal treaties.
   Those treaties turn the Panama Canal over to Panama at the end
of the century.

   President Bush on Saturday urged the
Panamanian people and defense forces to drive Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega ``and his doberman thugs'' from power and pledged support
for a successor government.
   Bush stopped short of directly urging violence or a coup but
told reporters aboard Air Force One, ``I would love'' to see
Noriega ``out of there right now.''
   Noriega is under indictment in this country on drug charges, but
Bush said he didn't care whether the Panamanian leader went to a
nation that has an extradition treaty with the United States.
   Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We know what countries
are willing'' to take Noriega. But an administration official who
spoke on condition of anonymity said there are no signs the leader
is getting ready to step down.
   The president made his comments to reporters as U.S. troops
continued flying into Panama on a mission of protection for
Americans and U.S. facilities in the wake of violence that followed
last week's election. Bush has accused the Noriega regime of
stealing the election from the opposition candidate, Guillermo
Endara.
   Asked by reporters if his words could be seen as a call to
revolution or violent overthrow, Bush chose not to temper the
remarks.
   ``No, I would add no words of caution. The will of the people
should be implemented,'' he said.
   Bush hedged a hypothetical question about the American military
responding to request for aid from the 15,000-strong Defense
Forces, saying: ``They wouldn't need support from the United States
to get rid of Noriega. He's one man and they have a well trained
force.''
   The president's made his remarks as he flew from one college
commencement address to another in Mississippi. His comments marked
the latest in a series of steps designed to raise the stakes in a
long-running U.S. effort _ dating to the Reagan administration _ to
bring about Noriega's downfall.
   Asked if he was calling for the Panamanian Defense Forces to
overthrow Noriega, Bush replied, ``We'd like to see him out of
there, not just the PDF, the will of the people of Panama ...''
   ``The will of the people should not be thwarted by this man and
a handful of his doberman thugs,'' the president said. Noriega's
riot police are referred to as ``dobermans.''
   Asked if he cared where Noriega went, he said, ``I care that he
does whatever it takes to get him out of there right now.''
   He said going to a country that would bar extradition ``could
well be the answer'' for Noriega.
   ``That could be a solution ... He ought to think about that,''
Bush said.
   The president said he was anxious to make sure that the
Panamanian Defense Forces headed by Noriega did not harbor the
misconception that the administration's drumbeat of anti-Noriega
statements were directed also at them.
   ``If I were speaking to the Panamanian people, I would tell them
that the affection by the American people for the people of Panama
is still very much intact, strong,'' Bush told reporters flying
with him to a graduation address at Mississsippi State University.
   ``And secondly I would say to the Panamanian Defense Forces, the
PDF, they have a useful role to play and they will in the future of
Panama. The problem is not the PDF per se. The problem is Noriega.''
   Bush again condemned what he called a fraudulent election last
Sunday in Panama. U.S. offcials and observers have said the
anti-Noriega opposition won overwhelmingly but that the election
was, as Bush put it, ``blatantly stolen'' by Noriega.
   Noriega's government said their candidate for president had won,
based on partially counted returns. But then Noriega invalidated
the whole election in the face of an outcry over fraudulent
balloting practices.
   ``The people should do everything they can to have the will of
the people respected,'' Bush said. ``They ought to just do
everything they can to get Mr. Noriega out of there.''
   Bush declined to say if he has talked to representatives of
other countries about accepting Noriega if he steps down. He would
say only, ``I'm confident they would receive him.'' He did not name
any countries or say how he had received such assurances.
   Bush said he is continuing to talk to U.S. allies, calling for
international condemnation of Noriega.
   Beyond that he did not state any additional actions the United
States might take beyond the sending of 2,000 troops this week to
help protect American citizens and bases in Panama and the
withdrawal of the U.S. ambassador.
   However, Bush said:
   ``We're still at the plate, and we'll stay at the plate until we
can help the people of Panama have the democracy for which they
spoke so articulately in an election. And we're not going to give
up on them.''
   ``No effort will be a success until he leaves,'' Bush said.
   Bush summoned reporters aboard Air Force One and made the
statement concerning Noriega and then answered questions.
   He said that if Noriega is ousted, the Panamanian people will
have ``an instant normalization of relations with the United States
and there will be a useful role for the Panamanian Defense Force.''
   He said his administration would recognize the government of
Endara if he were sworn in as president. The Catholic Church and
other observers said Endara won a 3-1 victory over Noriega's
candidate Carlos Duque last Sunday.
   Bush said further he would return the U.S. ambassador to Panama
and lift economic sanctions that have been in place for more than a
year.
   ``I think the election made so clear that the people want
democracy and made so clear that that democracy is being thwarted
by one man that that in itself could be the catalyst for removing
Noriega,'' Bush said.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. district judge has ruled that it's
possible for blacks to discriminate against other blacks based on
the color of their skin.
   Judge Charles A. Moye Jr. ruled that race and color are not the
same thing.
   ``It would take an ethnocentric and naive world view to suggest
that we can divide Caucasians into many subgroups, but somehow all
blacks are part of the same subgroup,'' Moye said. ``There are
sharp and distinctive contrasts amongst native black African
peoples both in color and in physical characteristics.''
   In his ruling Thursday, Moye certified for trial a lawsuit by
Tracy Walker of Union City, a clerk typist for the Internal Revenue
Service. She contended that her supervisor, Ruby Lewis, ``singled
her out for close scrutiny and reprimanded her for many things that
were false or insubstantial.''
   Ms. Walker's skin was lighter than Ms. Lewis'.
   Margaret Fernandez, a spokeswoman for the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission in Washington, said Moye's ruling may be a
first.
   ``If this issue had been raised, everyone here would have been
aware of it,'' she said. ``It is unique.''
   Ms. Walker's suit said Ms. Lewis considered her to be tardy,
lazy and incompetent, and recommended that she be fired. Ms.
Walker, who disputed Ms. Lewis' appraisal of her, eventually lost
her job.
   The defendants in the case _ including Ms. Lewis, the Internal
Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury secretary _ argued that
people of the same race can't discriminate against each other
because color has ``generally been interpreted to mean the same
thing as race.''
   Moye disagreed, citing a Supreme Court ruling that a white
employer had discriminated against a naturalized American from Iraq
because of his Arabian ancestry.
   He said ``there is evidence that Ms. Lewis might have harbored
resentful feelings towards white people, and therefore by
inference, possibly towards light-skinned black people.''
   Ms. Lewis could not be reached for comment Saturday.
   No trial date for the lawsuit has been set.

   Rutgers University students protested
tuition increases Saturday as incoming freshmen toured the campus,
but there was no repeat of the violence that resulted in 71 arrests
the day before.
   About 50 students demonstrated as six police officers on
horseback and at least a dozen on foot kept watch.
   The protest focused on police treatment of demonstrators Friday
as well as the 13 percent tuition hike for undergraduates and
increases of up to 18 percent for graduate students approved the
same day.
   Televisions were set up on the main green to show a homemade
videotape of police slapping students with nightsticks and carrying
others away by the hair when the students refused to leave the dean
of students' office.
   ``Rutgers University created a riot, and now they're trying to
play it down,'' said Jay Glick, a 20-year-old sophomore from East
Brunswick. ``We were just trying to be heard. If we can't speak up,
who's going to hear us?''
   Associate Dean of Students Dwight Smith blamed the violence on
the students, saying they broke the state university's regulations.
   Smith said he saw someone jump a detective Friday. ``That's the
only violence I saw,'' he said.
   Stu Heiser, a 22-year-old junior from Morristown and a member of
the student government, said the latest protest was aimed at the
incoming freshmen touring the campus and their parents.
   ``Had some of these students known of the tuition increase, they
may not have decided to come here,'' Heiser said.
   Under tuition increases approved Friday by the Rutgers Board of
Governors and going into effect this fall, undergraduate students
who are New Jersey residents will pay $2,576 a year and most
graduate students will pay $3,668.

   A NASA Boeing 747 bearing
the space shuttle Atlantis on its back took off Saturday on the
first leg of a flight to return the spaceship to Kennedy Space
Center in Florida.
   The jumbo jet was airborne at 3:40 p.m. and arrived at Biggs
Army Air Field at Fort Bliss, Texas, about two hours later,
officials said.
   After an overnight stop, the ferry flight will continue on to
Florida on Sunday, said Nancy Lovato, spokeswoman for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   Atlantis landed Monday after a four-day flight in which the crew
launched the unmanned Magellan space probe on an 800 million-mile
journey to Venus, where it will go into orbit and map the cloudy
planet with radar.
   NASA had hoped to start the ferry flight Saturday morning so
that the trip could be made in one day without the stopover.
   However, an overpressure problem developed in a hydraulic system
that had been sealed up on one of the shuttle's main engines and
the work had to be done over again, Lovato said.

<TEXT>
   Representatives of striking guards at
Los Alamos National Laboratory agreed to a contract with the
facility's security contractor on Saturday in an attempt to end a
two month-old walkout.
   ``It's a very good contract. We're very happy with it,'' said
Ben Huff, spokesman for the International Guards Union of America
Local 69.
   About 250 security inspectors went on strike March 13,
protesting Mason &amp; Hanger-Silas Mason Co.'s disciplinary policies
and other working conditions at the government complex where the
atomic bomb was developed during World War II and where military
research is still done.
   Leonard Carter, Mason &amp; Hanger's contract manager, said he was
satisfied with the pact, which was completed about 4 a.m. after an
18-hour negotiating session.
   ``There's nothing in there that I can't live with,'' he said.
   Union officials declined to discuss specifics of the contract
until it is ratified, but Huff said the proposal addressed most of
the guards' major concerns, including overtime, discipline and sick
leave.
   Carol Oppenheimer, a Santa Fe attorney who helped represent the
union, said a back-to-work pact still must be negotiated, and talks
on that would take place Monday and Tuesday.
   The union is slated to meet Wednesday for a ratification vote,
which requires a two-thirds majority. Huff said he expected about
245 of the 250 guards to return to work.
   On Thursday, Sens. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., and Jeff Bingaman,
D-N.M., asked the General Accounting Office to study whether the
security force should consist of federal employees rather than a
Department of Energy contractor.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House subcommittee
that oversees the DOE, also asked for a GAO investigation of
defense-installation security at the request of Rep. Bill
Richardson, D-N.M.
   The guards have been replaced by non-union workers and
supervisors during the strike.

   President Bush, in his first comments on
Soviet arms reductions, said Saturday he welcomed the move and said
he wanted to win the ``peace war'' with Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   The president, reacting to Gorbachev's announced cut of 500
short-range missiles in eastern Europe, challenged the Soviet
leader to make good on his promise to reduce the Soviet's nuclear
arsenal.
   ``Let him do what he says, unilaterally. It would be good,''
Bush said aboard Air Force One.
   His remarks indicated adherence to his opposition to
negotiations with the Soviets for cuts in NATO tactical nuclear
weapons in western Europe.
   ``We've already removed 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons, and it
would be nice to have him go ahead and make some moves,'' Bush said.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush was
referring to ``well over 2,000'' obsolete nuclear warheads that the
Army has taken out of service in western Europe over the past few
years.
   Bush commented a day after he called for a new openness in
U.S.-Soviet relations that would bring the Soviet Union``back into
the world order,'' including a call for mutual surveillance flights
over NATO and Warsaw Pact territories.
   But Bush, in Friday's speech to Texas A&amp;M University, mixed
optimism over recent political reforms in the Soviet Union with an
insistence that promises be met with deeds, a theme he repeated on
Saturday in his chat with reporters.
   Gorbachev's announcement on the cuts on Soviet weapons on
Thursday, made to U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III in
Moscow, caught U.S. officials by surprise.
   However, Bush on Saturday, when asked if he thought he would win
the public-relations war with his Soviet counterpart, declared:
``No such war. I want to win the peace war, lasting peace, that
built on action not on words.''
   ``Action is what I talked about yesterday,'' Bush said.
   ``I think we will prevail,'' he added.
   Bush's refusal to consider reductions in U.S. Lance missiles in
eastern Europe until the Soviet superiority in conventional weapons
is erased has split NATO.
   Meanwhile, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said
Saturday in West Germany that the Kremlin would consider a
rearmament step or a break with the intermediate-range nuclear arms
treaty if NATO upgrades its short-range nuclear missiles.
   Shevardnadze met with West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher in Bonn Saturday, and the talks focused on the contentious
missile issue.
   Fitzwater declined immediate comment on Shevardnadze's statement.
   Bush said he had not yet received any reaction from allies to
his call for mutual surveillance flights, a revival of an
Eisenhower-era ``open skies'' proposal.
   The president said he had talked by phone to Baker on Saturday
morning, when both of them were in Houston, to discuss briefly the
secretary of state's trip to Moscow.
   On other subjects, Bush declined to discuss the situation in
Panama, brushing aside reports that Venezuela might have offered
political asylum to Panamian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Bush indicated he would have something to say on the subject of
Panama over the next few days, although did not disclose the forum.
   Fitzwater suggested that the administration did not want to
elaborate upon the tense situation in Panama at this time because
``the stated policy is to protect American lives.''
   Bush earlier in the week dispatched 2,000 U.s. troops to
reinforce American bases and protect Americans living there.
   The president talked with reporters on Air Force One in Houston
before back-to-back commencement speeches in Mississippi _ speeches
that extolled virtues of education, family and work and did not
touch upon current events.
   In a speech to predominantly black Alcorn State University here
at Lorman, Bush said the ``economic transformation wrought by
historically black colleges such as Alcorn is nothing less than
astounding.''
   Noting that while 85-percent of graduates in such schools came
from blue-collar families, ``almost all go on to professional or
managerial positions.''
   ``It's an exciting tradition, and one of the most
under-appreciated success stories in America,'' he said.
   Deputy press secretary Stephen Hart said that a member of a
Mississippi SWAT team assigned to provide security at Alcorn State
accidentally fired his rifle.
   The episode occurred before the president's helicopter landed,
and no one was hurt, Hart said.
   Later, in remarks prepared for commencement at Mississippi State
University in Jackson, Miss., Bush spoke of the ``values of
America's good, quiet, decent people _ Americans who know that we
are not the sum of our possessions, but of how we conduct
ourselves.''
   ``These people form the heart of our society,'' Bush said.
   ``The postwar period has given way to a new world _ a world
still perilous, but alive with prospects for peace and with
certainty of change. Yet there are some things that haven't changed
since 1948. America's values haven't.''
   Bush quoted slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King in his
Alcorn State speech: ``intelligence is not enough. Intelligence
plus character _ that is the true goal of education.''And in the
speech to Mississippi State, Bush evoked the memory of Mississippi
novelist William Faulkner, who spent most of his life in the area.
``Let Faulkner's `verities and truths of the heart' be our
values,'' he said.
   Bush planned to outline his administration's emerging foreign
policy strategy in a series of five speeches. His Texas A&amp;M speech
was the first, and he is also to dwell on East-West relations in a
speech next weekend at Boston University.
   He was to travel to Lexington, Ky., later Saturday to attend a
fund-raising dinner for the re-election campaign of Republican Sen.
Mitch McConnell. It was Bush's first appearance at a political
fund-raising event as president.
   Bush was to spend the night in Kentucky at the home of a friend,
then return to Washington on Sunday.
   Bush spent Friday night in Houston, at the Houstonian Hotel,
which had been his official voting residence as vice president.
   He jogged both Friday night and Saturday morning on the hotel
grounds, and on Friday night took a group of friends to a local
Houston barbecue and spare ribs restaurant, walking around the
establishment shaking hands with patrons.

<TEXT>
   Exxon's plan to dispose of the wastes from
its oil spill cleanup won guarded state approval Saturday, but the
oil company was told it should not expect exemptions from
air-quality laws.
   Coast Guard and Exxon aircraft patrolled sections of Prince
William Sound in a hunt for spilled oil to keep Alaska's prized
halibut catch free of floating crude. The first round of flights
was canceled early Saturday because of bad weather.
   The state Department of Environmental Conservation announced its
general approval of Exxon's disposal plan, allowing the company to
process polluted water at the oil industry's jointly owned Alyeska
ballast treatment plant in Valdez.
   But the state, while also approving Exxon's proposal to burn
solid oil-fouled wastes, said the company must use special
incinerators in order to meet air quality standards. The state
suggested that the wastes be burned in barges off the coast. Exxon
said one barge would be sufficient; the state, however, said two.
   Exxon, which has spent about $100 million on the cleanup to
date, expects to pick up about 55,000 tons of waste by Sept. 15,
the completion target date.
   The waste includes oily water skimmed up by vessels, tar-covered
sea debris, oil-soaked absorbent pads and wipes, damaged clothing
and dead animals.
   The company has proposed cleaning 364 miles of Alaska coastline
by September, and burning, burying or discharging in water the oily
wastes it accumulates.
   With the opening of the halibut season only two days away, the
Coast Guard ordered pilots to locate oil blotches in the spill
zone, then use the information to produce maps that will be
distributed to fishermen.
   ``We got a couple of flights out despite the weather, and
fishermen are telling us conditions are pretty good,'' said Coast
Guard spokesman Dennis Hubbard. ``Weather in several areas around
the sound is clearing up and the water is getting smoother.''
   Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins, the ranking federal official in the
spill zone, scheduled eight flights each day on Saturday and Sunday
over hundreds of square miles, crisscrossing the zone where the
tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on March 24, leaking nearly 11
million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound.
   In other developments:
   _Authorities said two beached whales were discovered on Tugidak
Island, about 450 miles southwest of Valdez. Joe Bridgman, a
spokesman for Alaska's Department of Environmental Conservation,
said authorities had not determined whether the whales' deaths were
related to the oil spill.
   _Oil washed ashore at the fishing village of Homer on the Kenai
Peninsula, about 200 miles from Valdez. Local residents said small
tar balls and globs of tacky crude washed up on the beach. Exxon
workers and volunteers from Homer cleaned up the crude, said Exxon
representative Dan Jones.
   _Gov. Steve Cowper announced plans to tour the lower 48 states
to persuade tourists that Alaska's spectacular scenery is not awash
in oil. He plans news conferences in six cities; advertisements
touting Alaska will run in 14 major markets, financed by $4 million
from Exxon USA.
   _Coast Guard and Exxon officials said they were planning joint
tests of powerful chemicals to break down thick crude that has
washed up on beaches in Prince William Sound and elsewhere. The
tests are scheduled for the middle of the week on Ingot Island, a
small island fouled by the spill. The chemicals thin out the crude,
then allow it to be washed away into the water where it can be
collected by skimmer boats or decompose.

   Officials planned special anti-drug lectures for
kindergarteners after three 5-year-olds were found playing with a
bag of cocaine at school.
   One student apparently brought in the powder to Public School
153 in Harlem on Thursday, authorities said.
   ``Whether she found it or got it from somebody, we don't know,''
said Howard Lubkin, director of pupil personnel for school District
6.
   ``She showed it to her friends. The envelope was opened, some
spilled on the desk, some on the floor,'' Lubkin said.
   ``Out of the innocence of tots, the two friends, possibly
emulating adults, started to put it near their noses,'' Lubkin
said. ``They had powder on their faces _ whether they sniffed it or
not we don't know.''
   Tests at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center indicated the
three children did not have any drugs in their systems.
   Lubkin said the youngster who took the white powder to school
said she found it in her home ``but the stories changed several
times.''
   The girl who took the substance to school was released into the
custody of the Child Welfare Administration, Lubkin said. No
charges have been filed against her parents, police said.
   The other two girls were released to the their parents, Lubkin
said.
   Lubkin said a drug counselor was ordered to go to the
1,250-pupil school and speak to the pre-schoolers about drug abuse
and ``to re-emphasize anti-drug lessons.''
   Across the street from the school, narcotics officers have
repeatedly raided an apartment building where crack and other drugs
are dealt openly.

<HEAD>Likud Votes To Suuport Shamir's Election Plan, U.S. Envoy Meets Peres</HEAD>

   Ministers from the right-wing Likud bloc voted
Saturday to support Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's election plan
for the occupied territories, virtually assuring Cabinet approval,
Shamir's spokesman said.
   Also Saturday, U.S. envoy Dennis Ross met with leaders of
Shamir's Likud and the center-left Labor Party to discuss the
election proposal that would give Palestinians limited autonomy.
   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israeli troops shot
and wounded 19 Palestinians in scattered clashes, according to Arab
reports. Israel radio said a 60-year-old Arab was stabbed and
critically wounded by masked assailants who apparently suspected
him of collaborating with Israeli authorities.
   The 26-member government meets Sunday in a regular session to
consider Shamir's election plan. At least 17 ministers from the
26-member government have indicated support for Shamir's plan.
   ``We expect it to pass,'' said Yossi Achimier, a spokesman for
Shamir.
   At Saturday's meeting of Likud Cabinet ministers, the vote was
6-2 in favor of Shamir's plan. Party officials said three Likud
ministers are out of the country but two are expected to vote for
it by proxy.
   The Likud vote Saturday night was not binding, but gave an
indication of the Shamir plan's support. The only resistance has
come from hardline Likud elements. Labor Party ministers voted 9-2
last week _ also in a non-biding vote _ to support the plan.
   Likud's Ariel Sharon, now trade minister, has opposed the plan,
saying it would undermine Israeli security.
   The four-page plan submitted to the Likud ministers avoided
disputed issues, according to one party official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   ``Controversial issues were not mentioned in the proposal,'' the
official said. ``It's only a first proposal.''
   A Likud official at the meeting said Shamir emphasized the
necessity of adopting the plan, saying it would ease international
pressure on the party.
   Ross, an aide to Secretary of State James A. Baker III, met with
Finance Minister Shimon Peres Saturday and briefed him on Baker's
talks last week with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Ross and four other State Department officials who arrived
Saturday also will confer with Shamir and other government leaders.
   Baker and Shevardnadze discussed Shamir's election plan at their
Moscow meeting.
   Peres, head of Labor, said after meeting Ross that the U.S.
envoy told him the Soviets view Shamir's plan with ``an air of
development and optimism.''
   Moscow broke off diplomatic ties with Israel in 1967, when
Israel captured lands from Soviet-allied Arab states.
   Israel hopes Shamir's plan will help end the 17-month
Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories, in which at least
472 Arabs and 21 Israelis have been killed.
   Ross and his delegation are seeking further details on the peace
plan.
   Informed sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Americans want to know if the 140,000 Arabs living in Jerusalem
will be allowed to vote and also if there would be international
supervision of the balloting in the occupied territories.
   A Likud official said those two issues were not dealt with in
the proposal submitted to the Likud ministers Saturday.
   Israel captured Arab east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 war
and later annexed it.

   A young man held his former girlfriend hostage
at gunpoint for five hours Saturday in the casino kitchen where she
worked, threatened to kill himself after releasing her, then
finally surrendered to police.
   Gamblers were allowed to continue playing in the California
Hotel and Casino, but no one was allowed into the downtown complex
during the nearly 10{-hour drama.
   Darlene Cross, 21, suffered a gunshot wound to the arm and was
pistol-whipped about the head and face, said police Lt. Randy Oaks.
She was taken to University Medical Center, where she was in good
condition.
   Cross was released at 12:55 p.m., and walked to a waiting
ambulance.
   Her former boyfriend, Bobby Johnson, propped himself against a
kitchen wall and held SWAT team members at bay, pointing a gun to
his head or chest and threatening suicide. At 6:23 p.m., he
surrendered to police, Oaks said.
   Johnson, a 25-year-old kitchen worker in a hotel on the Strip,
fired shots at other workers and security guards at the casino, but
there were no other serious injuries, Oaks said.
   More than 40 police officers including a SWAT team and a crowd
in the hundreds surrounded the 12-story, downtown hotel after the
incident began at 7:55 a.m.
   Witnesses said Johnson, a worker at a Strip hotel, grabbed Cross
in the hotel coffee shop, then forced her into the kitchen.
   Norm Bullitt, a chef, said he stumbled on Johnson and Cross in
the kitchen.
   ``I heard this `girl' whimpering, pleading,'' Bullitt said. He
said he ran to break up the fight, but saw the man had a
.357-caliber Magnum handgun.
   ``I stopped and looked at the guy, and he looked at me,''
Bullitt said. ``He fired at me at point-blank range.'' Bullitt said
the shot went over his shoulder, shattering glass behind him which
cut another worker, and Bullitt managed to flee.
   Johnson fired shots at the first security guards to arrive, Oaks
said. One guard returned fire, but missed.
   The hostage's sister, Roma Brown, said Johnson had threatened
Cross at least four times.
   Brown said her sister obtained a restraining order against
Johnson late last year, but he continued to harass her at her job
and home.
   ``He said if he couldn't have her he didn't want anyone else to
have her and he didn't want to live,'' Brown said. ``She was always
afraid he'd shoot her.''

<HEAD>Solidarity Leaders Urge Workers to Avoid Strikes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leaders urged members of the
independent union Saturday to resist pressures to strike, and
accused the country's official unions of fomenting work stoppages.
   Solidarity, which has used strikes in the past to advance its
demands, has taken the new tack since reaching an agreement with
the government in April to take part in the political process as a
legal organization.
   Its leader, Lech Walesa, stopped short of telling copper miners
to end a six-day strike last week. However, he said the country
faced more pressing problems than pay demands and that economic
stability is needed for reforms to take root.
   Solidarity's National Executive Commission articulated the
union's current position on strikes Saturday, saying, ``The use of
strike pressure for this purpose (higher pay) only makes the
situation worse. It creates political tensions, leads to increasing
inflation, depreciates the currency.''
   It said union members should instead concentrate on making
Solidarity stronger.
   ``Organizing our union is now the most important task of all
structures and activists of Solidairty,'' it said. ``Only as a
strong and well-organized union will Solidarity be able to
effectively influence reforms.''
   The declaration was made at a commission meeting chaired by
Walesa in the Baltic port of Gdansk.
   Hundreds of strikes over pay have occurred this year. Most of
the work stoppages have been isolated and have ended quickly.
   But the 15,000 copper miners idled four mines for six days until
management agreed last Thursday to grant pay increases of 30
percent and a 30 percent bonus.
   The Solidarity leadership also charged the official trade union
alliance, known as OPZZ, of trying to provoke strikes.
   ``In many regions and branches, our union is provoked to strike
and a special role is played here by OPZZ activists, who try to
make impossible the agreements of the roundtable,'' it said.
   The ``roundtable'' is a reference to the broad-based talks
leading to the pact between the government and the Solidarity-led
opposition on April 5.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Saturday called on the
Panamanian people to oust Gen. Manuel Noriega from power and said,
``I would love to see them get him out.''
   But even as he showed a clenched fist to Noriega, Bush extended
a welcome to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's announced plans
to eliminate 500 short-range missiles from Eastern Europe. ``Let
him do what he says unilaterally. It would be good,'' the president
said.
   Articulating foreign policy literally on the fly, Bush spoke
with reporters aboard Air Force One in two separate sessions as he
made his way from Texas to a pair of college commencement speeches
in Mississippi. He was flying to Kentucky for the night.
   When a reporter suggested Bush's words about Noriega might be
interpreted as a call to revolution or violent overthrow, Bush did
not temper the remarks.
   ``No, I would add no words of caution,'' he said. ``The will of
the people should be implemented.''
   ``No effort will be successful until he leaves,'' Bush said of
the Panamanian leader, whom he again accused of stealing last
weekend's election.
   As for Gorbachev, Bush offered no reduction in U.S. missiles in
reply, saying the United States has already removed warheads from
Western Europe.
   Asked if he thought he would win a public-relations war with his
Soviet counterpart, Bush declared: ``No such war. I want to win the
peace war, lasting peace, that built on action not on words.''
   Bush used his strongest words to date in addressing Noriega, and
he did so as U.S. troops continued flowing into Panama to protect
American citizens and property there.
   The president went before television cameras to promise full
support for a successor to Noriega if the Panamanian people force
him from power.
   While stopping short of urging violence or a coup, the president
declared he would ``love'' to see the Panamanians get Noriega out
and pointedly declined to soften his language.
   Was he calling for a military coup?
   ``We'd like to see him out of there, not just the PDF, the will
of the people of Panama,'' said Bush. `` ... The will of the people
should not be thwarted by this man and a handful of his doberman
thugs.''
   The Panamanian Defense Force is Panama's military.
   Bush instigated the contact with reporters on the Panama issue,
making brief remarks, on camera, before submitting to a few
questions.
   Only a few hours earlier _ this time only in response to
questions _ Bush had said he had no desire to engage in a public
relations war with Gorbachev, but wanted to win the ``peace war.''
   In his first comments on Gorbachev's announced cut of 500
short-range missiles in eastern Europe, the president told
reporters he welcomed the move.
   ``Let him do what he says, unilaterally. It would be good,''
Bush said.
   His remarks indicated adherence to his opposition to
negotiations with the Soviets for cuts in NATO tactical nuclear
weapons in western Europe.
   ``We've already removed 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons, and it
would be nice to have him go ahead and make some moves,'' Bush said.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush was
referring to ``well over 2,000'' obsolete nuclear warheads that the
Army has taken out of service in eastern Europe over the past few
years.
   Bush commented a day after he called for a new openness in
U.S.-Soviet relations that would bring the Soviet Union ``back into
the world order,'' including a call for mutual surveillance flights
over NATO and Warsaw Pact territories.
   But Bush, in Friday's speech to Texas A&amp;M University, mixed
optimism over recent political reforms in the Soviet Union with an
insistence that promises be met with deeds, a theme he repeated on
Saturday in his chat with reporters.
   Gorbachev's announcement on the cuts on Soviet weapons on
Thursday, made to U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III in
Moscow, caught U.S. officials by surprise.
   Bush's refusal to consider reductions in U.S. Lance missiles in
eastern Europe until the Soviet superiority in conventional weapons
is erased has split NATO. However, Bush said Saturday, ``We'll work
it out. This alliance is strong.''
   Bush said he had not yet received any reaction from allies to
his call for mutual surveillance flights, a revival of an
Eisenhower-era ``open skies'' proposal.
   The president said he had talked by phone to Baker on Saturday
morning, when both of them were in Houston, to discuss briefly the
secretary of state's trip to Moscow.
   The president talked first with reporters on Air Force One in
Houston before back-to-back commencement speeches in Mississippi _
speeches that extolled virtues of education, family and work and
did not touch upon current events.
   He brought up the Panama matter en route from predominantly
black Alcorn State University at Lorman to Mississippi State
University near Starkville.
   Later, Bush raised the Panama issue again at a fundraising
dinner in Lexington, Ky., for the 1990 re-election effort of Sen.
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
   ``Let me just assure you of this: I will act prudently in
Central America... '' Bush said. ``We do not want to return to the
days of the imperial gringos of the North. But let everybody be
clear on one point, I will protect the lives of Americans in Panama
_ whether they're military or civilians.''
   ``We will not let American lives be put at risk by a dictator
down there,'' he declared.
   At Alcorn State, he said the ``economic transformation wrought
by historically black colleges such as Alcorn is nothing less than
astounding.''
   Noting that while 85 percent of graduates in such schools came
from blue-collar families, ``almost all go on to professional or
managerial positions.''
   ``It's an exciting tradition, and one of the most
under-appreciated success stories in America,'' he said.
   Departing from his prepared remarks, Bush told the audience at
Alcorn that ``as the Soviet Union moves toward greater openness and
democratization, and as they meet the challenge of responsible
behavior, we will match their steps with steps of our own.''
   He said over the past four decades, ``the Soviets have chosen to
stand apart from and opposed to, the world family of nations.''
   ``Yesterday, I announced a new policy for the 1990s, one that
moves beyond just trying to contain the Soviet Union...And if we
succeed, I can guarantee to you and your kids _ that the future you
know is going to be safer, and the world you know will be freer.''

<TEXT>
   Prince Charles, in his first television
interview in five years, says he has matured into his role as the
future king of England and finds that he is taken more seriously
than in the past.
   On the CBS News program ``West 57th,'' which was broadcast
Saturday night, the Prince of Wales said one area where he is taken
more seriously is his work in preserving the environment.
   He said people used to dismiss him ``as a crank'' because of his
outspokenness on environmental issues.
   Noting that ecology is now a prime worldwide concern, the prince
smiled and said, ``Now, I'm going to go on talking about it. ...
I'm not stopping just because it's become a political issue, I can
assure you. And I'm going to go on even more because now at last
there's an audience.''
   He told CBS News correspondent Selina Scott that he has
gradually gained more confidence in his personal judgment.
   ``I was never certain that the feelings I had were worth
expressing. But now, I feel much more determined about them, and I
think it's probably something that happens to you when you reach
40,'' he said.
   He said he has to maintain his sense of humor and is aware that
as many people come to gawk at him as to listen to his views when
he speaks.
   Asked by Scott if he laughed at himself, the prince replied, ``I
do try. God! Well, plenty of people laugh at me. That's why I often
try to, you know, to poke fun at myself because I actually think
... it's a way of helping people to realize that you're human.''

<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze on Saturday said the Kremlin might rearm or break the
intermediate-range nuclear arms treaty if NATO upgrades its
short-range missiles.
   The veiled threat to match a NATO proposal to increase the range
of European-based Lance nuclear missiles was the latest Soviet
effort to pressure the West into a new round of arms talks.
   Shevardnadze met with West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher for four hours Saturday. The talks focused on the
contentious missile issue, which has divided NATO.
   The United States wants NATO approval this month of a plan to
``modernize,'' or more than triple the range of the Lance rockets
by 1995. But West Germany has balked and is pressing for superpower
talks on reducing short-range weapons.
   Most of NATO's short-range missiles are based in West Germany,
and public opinion here is strongly against the modernization step
for fear it would jeopardize arms control efforts.
   Shevardnadze said the modernization project was tantamount to
``development of a new weapons system,'' and he said the Kremlin
would not want to have to take a similar step.
   ``This would have to be considered, but it would not be by our
own choice,'' Shevardnadze warned at a news conference before
returning to Moscow.
   He likened the new missiles NATO plans to develop to the Soviet
SS-23s being dismantled under the December 1987 superpower accord
eliminating medium-range missiles.
   ``Why should we liquidate the SS-23 if the other side is
creating and will deploy an analogous Lance-2 rocket?'' the foreign
minister said. ``It makes no sense to destroy these rockets then.''
   He said destruction of the SS-23 would have to be halted ``or we
would have to create a new system.'' Suspension of the SS-23
liquidation would violate the INF treaty.
   Asked about the possibility of the Soviets rearming, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Saturday, ``They've already
rearmed. That's easy for them to say.''
   NATO plans to replace the Lance missiles, which have a range of
less than 75 miles, with missiles capable of reaching up to 300
miles. That would keep them within the limits allowed under the
1987 accord.
   The United States has repeatedly said it wants a balance of
conventional arms in Europe before entering into talks aimed at
elimination of short-range missiles.
   Moscow and Washington are already embarked on efforts to get rid
of long-range and medium-range missiles, and NATO officials argue
that a short-range nuclear option is necessary to defend against an
attack by the Warsaw Pact's superior conventional forces.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced last week during
Secretary of State James A. Baker III's visit to Moscow that the
Kremlin would unilaterally cut its short-range strength by 500
warheads, and he called again for negotiations on the remaining
nuclear arms.
   The move has been met with only a lukewarm response by
Washington.
   Baker deemed the Kremlin gesture ``a good step, but a small
step.''
   President Bush on Saturday said, ``Let him do what he says
unilaterally. It would be good.''
   ``We've already removed 2,000 nuclear weapons, and it would be
nice to have him (Gorbachev) go ahead and make some moves,'' Bush
added.
   U.S. National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft accused Gorbachev
of a publicity ploy aimed at splitting the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   Asked about Scowcroft's view, Shevardnadze said it would be
``naive'' of the Kremlin to try to disrupt the Western alliance,
and he said the Soviet measure was aimed at balancing East-West
defenses.
   The Western alliance estimates that the short-range forces of
the Warsaw Pact nations outnumber NATO's by 12-to-1.
   Shevardnadze admitted there is an East bloc ``superiority'' in
some weapons but said Moscow has ``renounced'' that advantage and
taken steps to eliminate it.
   In his talks with Genscher and West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, the Soviet diplomat repeatedly pressed for superpower talks
to reduce the short-range forces and berated Washington for its
refusal.
   ``What is to be feared by talking?'' Shevardnadze said during
his news conference. ``No one can be forced in negotiations to do
what he does not want to do.''
   But when asked if he was frustrated by the Bush administration's
dismissal of the latest Kremlin offers, Shevardnadze responded:
``We have strong nerves. We will wait .... We believe that NATO
will find in the nearest time a new approach on this.''
   Shevardnadze's two-day visit was dominated by the superpower and
internal NATO disarmament dispute.
   West Germany's resistance on the missile modernization plan has
drawn some support from other NATO members, creating a rift within
the 16-nation Western alliance.
   Genscher, who has long advocated a more trusting relationship
between the superpowers in the wake of Soviet democratic reforms
and disarmament progress, is the driving force behind West
Germany's stand on modernization.
   Genscher sidestepped a question about Shevardnadze's threat of a
Kremlin rearmament move, declaring it ``improper to address
speculative considerations.''

   More than 220 anti-abortion demonstrators were
arrested here Saturday morning as throngs of protesters from both
sides of the issue converged to draw attention to their views on
Mother's Day weekend.
   Nearly 200 other anti-abortion protesters were arrested in
demonstrations in Pittsburgh and outside San Francisco.
   In St. Paul, Minn., more than 5,000 people held a rally at the
state Capitol to demand that abortion remain legal in the United
States and to denounce protests against clinics that perform
abortions. Demonstrators carried signs with slogans such as
``Mother's Day Not Mandatory.''
   Chicago police arrested 143 men and 80 women at the Park Medical
Center and charged them with resisting arrest and mob action, said
police spokeswoman Tina Vicini. The street was closed to traffic.
   Police broke up occasional sidewalk skirmishes between the
demonstrators and abortion rights protesters. Other anti-abortion
demonstrators were stationed at more than 25 clinics throughout the
city, organizers said.
   Park Medical Center continued seeing patients, and abortion
rights activists vowed to stay until the clinic had treated the
last of 21 patients. The clinic performs a range of gynecological
services besides abortions.
   Police earlier estimated more than 300 people had been arrested.
The confusion arose because the arrests so overtaxed the local
police district that protesters had to be sent to four other
stations to be processed, Ms. Vicini said. Detainees further
clogged the system by giving their names only as ``Baby John Doe''
and ``Baby Jane Doe,'' police said. Most carried no identification.
   In California, about 100 anti-abortion demonstrators were
arrested Saturday outside a clinic in Redwood City, about 10 miles
south of San Francisco, police said. Also arrested were five to 10
abortion rights demonstrators involved in a brief scuffle with the
activists representing Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion group,
said Police Chief Tony Guardino.
   All were arrested for investigation of blocking a public
sidewalk, an infraction, and were cited and released, Guardino said.
   In Pittsburgh, 84 demonstrators were arrested for refusing to
leave a women's clinic that performs abortions, and three of the
protesters were charged with assaulting police officers, said
Officer Tom Melick.
   A spokeswoman for Operation Rescue, which organized that
demonstration as well, charged that police repeatedly kicked one
protest leader, Keith Tucci of Pittsburgh.
   Tucci was listed in fair condition at Mercy Hospital, where he
was being treated for abdominal injuries, according to nursing
supervisor Dorothy McKendry.
   Tucci said as many as four officers kicked him after he
complained police were kicking demonstrators as they put them in a
paddy wagon and threw them on top of each other.
   ``I was pleading with them, saying, `Please don't do that,' ''
he said in an interview from the hospital.
   However, Assistant Police Chief Donald Aubrecht said Tucci was
one of several protesters who crawled under wooden police
barracades to block doors to the clinic.
   ``He grabbed a police officer by the leg and he wouldn't let
go,'' Aubrecht said. ``And she (the police officer) yelled, `Let go
of my leg! Let go of my leg! ''
   ``We are saying he (Tucci) was not kicked,'' Aubrecht said,
adding that Tucci will be charged with two separate assault charges.

   Hundreds of rival fans clashed at an English
soccer game on Saturday, and 16 people were hospitalized with
injuries, including a stabbing victim, police said.
   Authorities arrested 25 people. They later released one and
filed charges against the rest ranging from disorderly behavior and
drunkenness to assault and drug possession, police said.
   The incident came after 95 fans died during an April 15 stampede
at a soccer game at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield, England.
   The game Saturday was between Birmingham and host Crystal Palace
at London's Selhurst Park. Rival fans fought on the field early in
the game, and others vandalized parked buses near the stadium,
authorities said.
   At least 16 people were hospitalized, including one fan who was
stabbed, but authorities said none of the injuries appeared serious.
   Birmingham fans climbed over a low fence and rushed onto the
field about 12 minutes into the game as Crystal Palace went ahead
1-0. They were confronted by Crystal Palace supporters, and fights
broke out, officials said.
   The English Soccer League game was stopped immediately. Referee
Mike Bodenham ordered the players off the field as seven mounted
police arrived to restore order. Ambulances were summoned to carry
away injured fans.
   The game resumed 27 minutes later and ended in a 4-1 Crystal
Palace victory.
   ``The majority of Birmingham fans came down to have a good time,
some of them in fancy dress,'' said Sally Hubbard, chief
superintendent for stadium security. ``Unfortunately, there is
always a minority who spoil things.''
   Hubbard said several hundred fans were on the field at one
point, and she admitted that police did not expect so many
Birmingham supporters at the game. The official attendance was
16,000.
   About 100 additional police officers were called in because of
the violence, she said, supplementing the normal 150 officers on
duty.
   Sixteen people were taken to Mayday Hospital in south London,
said a hospital spokeswoman on condition of anonymity. She said the
most serious injury was the stab wound.

<HEAD>Reports Pope John Paul I Died After He Stopped Taking Medicine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new book on Pope John Paul I's death after a
33-day reign suggests he was so burdened by the task he stopped
taking vital medicines, according to a report in The Sunday Times.
   The London newspaper is publishing edited extracts of the book,
``A Thief in the Night'' by journalist John Cornwell.
   The author disputes theories that John Paul I might have been
killed by people in the Vatican involved in intrigues and power
struggles between conservatives and liberals in the Roman Catholic
Church hierarchy..
   John Paul I was elected pope on Aug. 26, 1978, and was found
dead in the bed of his Vatican apartment the morning of Sept. 29.
   The Vatican said the pontiff, nearly 66 years old, died of a
heart attack. No autopsy was performed.
   Theories of a conspiracy against John Paul I were fueled later
by a scandal involving the Vatican Bank, headed by American
Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, and its links to the 1982 collapse of
the huge Italian bank Banco Ambrosiano. Roberto Calvi, the head of
Banco Ambrosiano, was found hanged under London's Blackfriars
Bridge as Italian police investigated the scandal.
   In 1984, David Yallop claimed in his book ``In God's Name'' that
the pontiff was poisoned because he intended to crack down on
corruption in the Vatican. He mentioned Marcinkus as a conspirator.
   Cornwell writes in his book, ``The truth is much more shameful
even than if the pope had been murdered. That would have been the
work of several criminals or madmen, where in fact the whole of the
Vatican is responsible for the death of John Paul I.''
   ``Tormented by the conviction that he was unfit for the papal
throne _ a feeling shared by many in the Vatican _ John Paul I was
allowed to go to the solitary death he had prayed for, untended and
uncared for by those closest to him,'' according to the newspaper
excerpts.
   It said Cornwell found the pope had been taking medication for a
blood-clotting condition that he recognized as a ``matter of life
and death.''
   ``There is evidence that, not through forgetfulness, he
deliberately stopped taking this medication because he could no
longer continue as pope,'' Cornwell wrote.
   He said the Vatican encouraged his investigation, hoping it
would disprove the conspiracy theories.
   No one was available for comment Saturday night at the Vatican
press office and the telephone at the home of Vatican spokesman
Joaquin Navarro was not answered.
   The first segment of the excerpts dealt mainly with an interview
Cornwell said he had with Marcinkus at his office in the Vatican
Bank.
   According to the excerpts, Cornwell asked Marcinkus about
previous suggestions that the Chicago-born archbishop had conspired
against the pope and became involved with Banco Ambrosiano.
   Marcinkus is quoted as saying, ``Both of these things are
completely unfounded.... These guys are off their rockers.'' He
also was quoted as saying he had one audience with the new pope who
``couldn't have been nicer'' and asked Marcinkus to remain with the
Vatican Bank.

<TEXT>
   Dozens of Auburn and Lewiston residents
cleared their basements, turned off their electricity and bid their
homes goodbye Saturday as the Androscoggin River inched onto the
sidewalks of Maine's twin cities.
   By 10 p.m., the river was nearly 5 feet above flood level at
Auburn, and civil emergency staffers were watching anxiously.
   ``I'm just not comfortable,'' said Peter Van Gagnon, director of
the Androscoggin County Emergency Management Agency. ``I've seen it
quiet for hours and then suddenly take a jump of 2 or 3 feet.''
   Early in the weekend, state and county emergency response
officials advised residents to be ready to move quickly if the
river should suddenly rise.
   Although no sweeping evacuations were made, families living
closest to the river moved out as water filled their basements and
forced the shutdown of household utilities.
   Van Gagnon predicted the river in that area to crest ``just this
side of 20 feet'' late Saturday. The flood threshold ranges from 18
feet to 13 feet at Auburn.
   ``The difference in types of damage between 18 and 20 feet is
incredible,'' said Gagnon. ``We don't want anyone to think it's
over yet and go back home.''
   A flood watch is expected to remain in effect for the rest of
the weekend for all but the most northerly section of the state,
even though little rain is expected, according to the National
Weather Service in Portland.
   The watch applies to the Presumpscot, Kennebec, Saco and
Androcoggin as well as smaller rivers in the central and
southwestern parts of the state.
   The Kennebec was also expected to crest at North Sidney by early
evening Saturday at three feet above flood level, while in Augusta
the river was expected to crest at 1 foot below flood level, the
weather service said.
   The Saco crested early Saturday, but like most of the rivers
will take a few days to recede, said David Brown of the Maine
Emergency Management Agency. Friday's storm closed dozens of roads
and kept students out of school, but there were no serious
accidents or fatalities reported.
   The rain-swollen Presumpscott had been the quickest to rise,
overflowing its banks in Westbrook and forcing a paper mill to
close Friday.

   A strong earthquake hit the Kermadec Islands
in the South Pacfic on Saturday night, according to Don Finley of
the U.S. Geological survey.
   Finely said the quake centered near the islands, about 850 miles
north of Wellington, New Zealand, and registered 6.6 on the Richter
scale.
   There was no other information immediately available.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake measuring 6 can cause severe damage.

<HEAD>Two Formal Bids For Eastern Airlines Pending In Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group headed by a Chicago commodities trader
on Saturday submitted a proposal to buy Eastern Airlines in a bid
that would temporarily put former Secretary of Defense Frank
Carlucci in charge of the airline.
   The bid by Joseph Ritchie was the second submitted to a U.S.
Bankruptcy Court judge for the airline, which has been flying
limited schedules since its International Association of Machinists
employees began a strike March 4.
   Details of the Ritchie bid were unavailable, but the commodities
trader said in an interview with The New York Times that his offer
would give Eastern unions a larger stake in the airline than
offered by a group headed by Peter Ueberroth, the former
commissioner of professional baseball.
   The Ueberroth group had offered the unions 30 percent equity in
the airline in exchange for $210 million in concessions.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland had extended a Wednesday
bidding deadline to 11 a.m. Saturday to allow the Ritchie group to
study confidential financial data in making its bid.
   Miami-based Eastern has been under Chapter 11 protection from
creditors since March 9, five days after the start of a machinists
union strike supported by pilots and flight attendants that
virtually grounded the airline.
   The bankruptcy court must approve any sale of Eastern or any of
its businesses.
   Eastern, however, insists the airline is not for sale and is
proceeding with a plan to rebuild as a smaller carrier and raise
$1.8 billion by selling aircraft and other assets.
   In addition to Carlucci, Ritchie, who is head of the Chicago
Research and Trading Group, is being assisted by Joseph Wright, a
former director of the Office of Management and Budget.
   On Wednesday, an investor group led by William Howard, the
former chairman of Piedmont Airlines, submitted its bid before the
prior 5 p.m. Wednesday deadline. The investment firm
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. is a participant in the Howard
group.
   Billionaire hotel executive Jay Pritzker already has proposed
buying all of Eastern for around $500 million, although it is
unclear whether he has submitted a formal offer.
   Before submitting formal bids, Ritchie, Howard and their
associates had extensive talks with representatives of Eastern's
unions and creditors.
   Sources have told The Associated Press that both proposals
address the issue of a temporary trustee who would operate Eastern
in a way that should prevent the issue from sabotaging a potential
deal between a buyer and Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp. They
declined to specify.
   The issue of a trustee who would assume control of the airline
from Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo was at the heart of the
collapse of Ueberroth's $464 million deal to buy Eastern.
   The bankruptcy judge has scheduled a Monday meeting on developer
Donald Trump's deal with Lorenzo to buy Eastern's profitable
Northeast shuttle service for $365 million.

<HEAD>Laid Off Workers in Elizabeth March on Mayor's House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TODD RICHISSIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shouting and clapping, about 150
relatives and supporters of laid-off police, firefighters and
rescue workers in this city marched to the mayor's house Saturday
to demand his recall.
   Some marchers pushed babies in strollers or walked dogs dressed
in union T-shirts. Most demonstrators wore black T-shirts reading,
``R.I.P. Elizabeth. She was a Proud Lady. Shot in the Back by Mayor
Thomas G. Dunn.''
   ``This is to show him how many people this is affecting,'' said
Nancy Munnings, who helped organize the protest at Dunn's house and
whose husband, Robert, is to be laid off May 31.
   She said the layoffs in this New Jersey city near New York were
``affecting children and families and the officers who remain who
won't have their backups. That's what we're trying to show him
today. No husbands allowed.''
   Dunn did not appear to be home.
   Saturday's protest was made possible when Superior Court Judge
Edward W. Beglin on Friday refused to extend a restraining order
prohibiting protests at Dunn's home. The order was issued last
month after a crowd of police officers, firefighters and ambulance
workers vandalized Dunn's house during a protest.
   On April 14, Dunn laid off 67 police officers, 53 firefighters,
and 24 emergency medical technicians, citing a budget shortfall
brought on by cuts in state aid and rising garbage disposal costs.
   Thirty-four more police officers and another 29 firefighting
jobs are to be cut May 31, said Paul Partanza, president of the
Police Benevolent Association of Elizabeth.
   The police and the others contend Dunn's action has severely
compromised the city's ability to control crime and handle
emergencies.
   After the first wave of layoffs last month, laid-off workers and
supporters started a campaign to recall Dunn.

<HEAD>Coelho Reportedly Acknowledges Failure to Disclose Loan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., said he failed to
report a $50,000 loan used to finance a personal investment on his
financial disclosure form, The Washington Post reported in Sunday's
editions.
   The Post quoted Coelho as saying the failure was the result of
an oversight by his accountant, who the House majority whip said
also inaccurately reported several aspects of the transaction.
   Coelho told the paper he is amending his financial disclosure
form to reflect the loan. The paper said he acknowledged he knew
about the loan but did not disclose it publicly when questions were
raised in April about his $100,000 investment in a junk bond.
   His campaign committee was initially listed as the buyer of the
bond from the brokerage firm of Drexel, Burnham, Lambert. But
Coelho said it actually was a personal investment and the brokerage
firm erred in saying the bonds were bought by his campaign fund.
   The Post quoted Coelho as saying that Thomas Spiegel, a Beverly
Hills thrift official, bought the bonds for him in early May 1986
and held them for a month until he raised $100,000 in loans to pay
for them. Half of the money came from a loan through Spiegel's
thrift association.
   Coelho later sold the bonds at a profit of $6,882. He said he
put his financial holdings in a blind trust about a year ago.
   The congressman was not home Saturday night and could not be
reached for comment.

   Barry Manilow was rushed to a hospital Saturday

   Manilow was in the emergency room late Saturday and there was no
immediate word on his condition, said spokeswoman Susan Dubow.
   However, she said he did not appear to be seriously ill and she
did not expect he would be admitted to the hospital, which she
refused to identify.
   ``I think he'll be fine,'' she said.
   Manilow, 42, became ill during intermission and an ambulance was
called about 10 p.m. to the Gershwin Theater, where his concert
show was recently extended through June 3.
   Dubow said the second act of the show was canceled and it was
not yet known whether further shows would be affected.

   Ten communities, including two from North
Carolina, won top honors Saturday at the 40th annual All-America
City Awards.
   The 10 winners were Phoenix, Ariz., Inglewood, Cal.; Greeley,
Colo.; Peoria, Ill., Salina, Kan.; New Bedford, Mass.; Tupelo,
Miss.; Dunn, N.C.; New Bern. N.C.; and Roanoke County, Va.
   Gregg Petersmeyer, a White House staffer with the Office
National Service, said all 30 finalists should be proud.
   ``The 30 finalists represent communities that have chosen to
pour themselves into common problems,'' Petersmeyer said in a
speech to the awards dinner. ``This is very much the type of work
that must be developed if America is going to solve some very
important problems.''
   Officials from the finalist cities went before the 12 judges
Friday and Saturday and presented a 20-minute program on five
criteria: community leadership, citizen participation, government
performance, civic education and community volunteerism and
philanthropy.
   The 30 communities, drawn from a pool of 109 applicants, ranged
in size from Palmer, Alaska, with a population of 3,000, to
Phoenix, with more than 1 million residents.
   The other finalists were: Hot Springs, Ark.; Half Moon Bay,
Calif.; Pomona, Calif.; Yuba City-Marysville, Calif.; Hialeah,
Fla.; Decatur, Ill.; Oak Park, Ill.; Bluffton, Ind.; Anne Arundel
County, Md.; Gaithersburg, Md.; Lexington, Neb.; Chapel Hill, N.C.;
Cleveland, Ohio; Shaker Heights, Ohio; Florence, Ore.; Newport,
Ore.; Woonsocket, R.I.; Chesapeake, Va.; and Bellevue, Wash.
   More than 4,000 cities have applied for the award sponsored by
the National Civic League since the program began in 1949, and
nearly 400 awards have been given out.

   A man who had climbed 14,000 feet up Mount

   The two men were among four California men aged 26 to 33, who

park spokesman Cy Hentges. Hentges said the dead man, whose body
was found Thursday night, ``more than likely'' died of hypothermia.
   ``He was found alone with his frozen body face down in the snow
with his pack on. ... He probably became mentally fatigued and
disoriented,'' he said.
   The two surviving climbers found the body while they climbed
toward Liberty Cap, a 14,100-foot point on the 14,410-foot
mountain. They searched for the missing man before descending to
report the incident.
   Park rangers and an Army helicopter searched Thursday but found
no signs of the missing climber before darkness.
   The identities of the climbers were not released.

<DATELINE>HOWARD AIR BASE, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A vanguard of 2,000 additional
U.S. combat troops reached Panama Friday with the arrival of the
first 150 Marines dispatched by President Bush to protect U.S.
citizens and American interests.
   A C-141 cargo plane carrying 10 Marines, a cannon-equipped
armored Scout car and 90 crates of ammunition arrived at Howard Air
Base at 1:50 p.m. EDT after a nearly five-hour flight from the
Cherry Point, N.C., Marine Air Station.
   At least three other C-141s and three huge C-5 cargo planes
stuffed with 17 more armored vehicles, support trucks and Marines
were close behind.
   Col. Ronald Sconyers, a spokesman for the Southern Command said:
``The troops are needed, as the president stated yesterday, because
we feel it's a prudent decision to increase the security for our
installations and our personnel. Gen. (Manuel Antonio) Noriega's
heavy-handed tactics and his willingness to abuse human rights
prove there's a lack of control on the streets of Panama.''
   ``We feel like although no Americans have been directly
threatened, we felt like it's only prudent to move our people out
and increase security.''
   He said the Marines and additional Army troops will be used to
provide security at the 10 bases and one radar site in Panama.
   He said the Marines would guard the perimeter of Howard Air
Base, which is about five miles east of Panama City, and an
ammunition dump as well as assist with security at the U.S. Embassy.
   He declined to say whether the vehicles would patrol the
perimeters but said, ``You can assume the perimeters of our bases
will be protected.''
   Lt. Col. Jerry Humble, commander of the Second Light Armored
Infantry Battalion, told reporters on the flight to Panama: ``I
think we're going to be here until this is resolved.''
   ``With what's going on down there any prudent American would be
concerned...'' said Humble, 41, of Owensboro, Ky.
   He said the troops were bringing along ``enough so that if we
get into something,'' there is sufficient firepower.
   The Marine troops, who tried to catnap under ponchos on the long
flight to Panama, will be joined by more Army combat troops from
Fort Ord, Calif., and Fort Polk, La., shortly _ all directed by
President Bush to protect U.S. citizens, property and interests in
the tense nation.
   Humble, in response to questions, said that if necessary the
armored vehicles could be used to bring U.S. citizens safely back
to U.S. bases and said his force is trained for such missions.
   ``That's an evacuation operation and that is a routine thing we
train for,'' he said. But Col. Sconyers said there was no plan for
the Marine vehicles to go off U.S. bases.

<HEAD>Stocks Post Big Gain on Encouraging Inflation Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices posted their biggest gain in nearly
a year Friday, finishing at new post-crash highs following a
government wholesale price report which analysts said eased Wall
Street's fears about inflation.
   The market's best-known indicator, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrial stocks, surged 56.82 points to settle at a new
post-crash high of 2,439.70.
   Broader market indicators also rose in active trading, with more
than three issues gaining for every one that fell among issues
listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The Dow's previous high since its Oct. 19, 1987 crash was
2,418.99 set on April 27. The daily gain was the biggest since a
74.68-point jump on May 31, 1988.
   Analysts attributed Friday's gain to a smaller-than-expected
rise in the Labor Department's producer price index for April. The
index rose 0.4 percent in April, or about half as much as many
analysts had expected.
   The news sent long-term Treasury bond prices _ which move
inversely to interest rates _ soaring by $20 and more for every
$1,000 in face value.
   Investors apparently concluded the report meant inflationary
pressures were not building and the Federal Reserve might not
continue its recent policy of encouraging higher interest rates,
analysts said.
   ``The fear until now was not that the economy would overheat but
that inflation would rise rapidly and keep the Fed from making
moves to ease credit,'' said Michael Metz, technical analyst for
Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ``Now it looks like that has changed.''

   About 200 black students who say
Michigan State University isn't adequately addressing racial
problems maintained a sit-in for a fourth day Friday, blocking the
main entrance to the administration building.
   Although side and back doors to the building were open,
university spokesman Terry Denbow said administration officials
wouldn't negotiate with the students until the front door was
opened.
   Protest leader Jeffery Robinson countered that the students
wouldn't open the doors until negotiations had resumed.
   No formal negotiations were held Friday, Denbow said, adding
that negotiations were scheduled for Saturday morning. ``I hope
this is all over after Saturday's session,'' he said.
   One student who tried to get inside to join the protest was
arrested Thursday night on a charge of causing a public disturbance.
   During the standoff, the cashier's and registrar's offices
remained locked, prompting a backlash from some students who said
they were being discriminated against because they couldn't get
inside.
   ``I really do think they are right to protest, but I don't feel
they have the right to occupy the administration building,'' said
Kent Hohensee, a 22-year-old senior, who said he spoke for a group
called No Equality Through Inequality.
   ``I believe in what they're protesting, I just don't like how
they're going about it,'' said Patrick Ranes, a junior.
   ``That building doesn't belong to them. It belongs to everyone
on campus. I think they're alienating a lot of people.''
   The protesters are asking for more black faculty, more
recruitment of black students, creation of a minority adviser to
the provost and the hiring of more minority group members,
especially at upper levels.
   Their demands also include better treatment from Department of
Public Safety officers and the firing of any university employee
found guilty of racism.
   Michigan State has 42,695 students, and 2,703 of them, or 6.3
percent, are black, spokeswoman Cherryl Jensen said. Overall, 10
percent of the school's students are from minority groups.

   President Raul Alfonsin urged
Argentina on Friday to accept with ``prudence and responsibility''
the winner of elections, and the opposition Peronistas confidently
predicted victory.
   The nation's 20 million eligible voters cast ballots this Sunday
for president, vice president, one-half the Chamber of Deputies,
one national senator, 15 provincial or territorial legislatures and
thousands of local officials.
   ``Whatever is the result of the balloting, I ask people (to
conduct themselves) so that prudence and responsibility are with us
still,'' Alfonsin begged the sometimes volatile electorate in his
19-minute broadcast speech.
   ``I ask people (to behave) so no pretext can be used to alter
the mechanisms that the Constitution provides for the election of
representatives and the transfer of power.''
   Carlos Menem of the Peronist Party has led in virtually every
poll for months. The latest surveys give him a seven to 10 point
edge over Eduardo Angeloz of the governing Radical Civic Union.
   Voting actually is for 600 presidential electors. The winner
needs at least 301.
   Sen. Eduardo Menem, the candidate's brother and key adviser,
said Friday that Peronist polls and party projections ``are giving
us more than 320 electors.''
   Carlos Menem's campaign coordinator, Eduardo Kohan, said, ``I am
absolutely sure we will win in the Electoral College.'' Peronist
Party President Antonio Cafiero, governor of Buenos Aires Province,
predicted that Menem ``absolutely'' will carry the Electoral
College on Sunday.
   Campaigns that began in earnest four months ago officially ended
at 8 a.m. Friday, 48 hours before polls are scheduled to open.
Hundreds of thousands attended rallies held by all three main
parties on Thursday night.
   In central Cordoba Province, where he is governor, Angeloz
pledged before an estimated 300,000 supporters to ``unleash a
battle with no quarter'' against inflation, to promote women's
rights and to uphold civil liberties.
   ``Never again will a Montonero or a green Falcon take away
anyone's son because he thinks differently,'' he said.
   Argentina's repressive security forces drove green Ford Falcon
cars during the 1976-83 military regime's crackdown on leftist
subversion. The Montonero urban guerrillas were linked with the
Peronist Party.
   Angeloz, 57, his own campaign hurt by Argentina's economic
crisis, repeatedly sought to damage Menem by bringing up the
violence and chaos of the 1973-76 Peronist government, which was
overthrown by a coup. Menem has bitterly denounced the tactic.
   ``Angeloz says if Menem wins, democracy will lose,'' Menem, 58,
told about 100,000 supporters in Buenos Aires. ``They (the
Radicals) demonstrated themselves to be democrats when in power and
coupmongers'' when not.
   Menem, three times governor of rural La Rioja Province, arrived
at the plaza rally site outside Congress atop a bus that led a
noisy motorcade through the capital's streets.
   Alvaro Alsogaray of the conservative Central Alliance coalition
addressed a much smaller, less emotional crowd of about 30,000 in
the capital, where his party has its most support.
   ``The country can't last through a new Radical or Peronist
government,'' said Alsogaray, a 75-year-old engineer and former
economy minister.
   He says his priorities would be to balance the budget, sell off
state companies and encourage foreign investment.
   Alsogaray was projected to get about 10 percent of the vote _
enough to play a pivotal role in the Electoral College. If neither
Menem nor Angeloz wins outright, Alsogaray could negotiate to give
his electors to one of them.
   The main issue in 1983 elections was a return to democracy
following a brutal military dictatorship. Alfonsin, who was elected
president, cannot seek re-election under the constitution. His term
ends on Dec. 10.
   The main issue this year is the economy. Argentina is suffering
triple-digit inflation, a devalued currency, high unemployment, and
a 59 billion foreign debt.

   President Bush on Saturday called on the
Panamanian people to oust Gen. Manuel Noriega from power and said,
``I would love to see them get him out.''
   But even as he showed a clenched fist to Noriega, Bush extended
a welcome to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's announced plans
to eliminate 500 short-range missiles from Eastern Europe. ``Let
him do what he says unilaterally. It would be good,'' the president
said.
   Articulating foreign policy literally on the fly, Bush spoke
with reporters aboard Air Force One in two separate sessions as he
made his way from Texas to a pair of college commencement speeches
in Mississippi. He was flying to Kentucky for the night. When a
reporter suggested Bush's words about Noriega might be interpreted
as a call to revolution or violent overthrow, Bush did not temper
the remarks.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze on Saturday said the Kremlin would consider a
rearmament step or a break with the intermediate-range nuclear arms
treaty if NATO upgrades its short-range nuclear missiles.
   The veiled threat to match a NATO proposal to increase the range
of European-based Lance rockets was the latest Soviet effort to
pressure the West into a new round of arms talks. Shevardnadze met
with West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher for four
hours Saturday. The talks focused on the contentious missile issue,
which has divided NATO.
   The United States wants NATO approval this month on a plan to
``modernize,'' or more than triple the range of the Lance rockets
by 1995. But West Germany has balked and is pressing for superpower
talks on reducing short-range weapons.

   The party founded by dictator
Juan Domingo Peron is poised to return to power for only the second
time in three decades on Sunday when Argentines elect a new
president.
   Polls show that voters, upset with a collapsing economy, are
likely to favor Peronist Party candidate Carlos Menem over Eduardo
Angeloz of the governing Radical Civic Union. In 1987, the
Peronists captured a majority of the congressional and
gubernatorial races.
   Voters on Sunday also will elect a vice president, half of the

   Teachers in the nation's second-largest
school district, seeking more money and more control of the
curriculum, are threatening a strike Monday that could create chaos
for 594,000 students weeks before school's end.
   The United Teachers-Los Angeles, representing 22,000 of the
district's 32,000 teachers, nurses and counselors, said its members
would keep at home with them the attendance and grade records that
School Superintendent Leonard Britton demanded be handed in by
Monday.
   The records, said Telfair Avenue Elementary School teacher
Stanley Malin, ``are already gone. That's no decision.'' A Monday
strike would be the district's first since a 23-day walkout in
1970. Britton's demand to teachers to hand in their grades by
Monday caused UTLA to move up its strike deadline from May 30.
Classes end June 26 for most schools in the 700-square-mile
district, and Britton said putting the strike deadline so close to
the end of school was extortionate.

<HEAD>From Alar to Aflatoxin, Environmental Problems Affecting Business
Behavior</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From Alar apple ripener to animal feed-corn
toxin to the molasses-like oil sludge polluting Alaska's shore,
environmental hazards have been catalysts forcing industries to
reappraise the way they do business.
   The cost of these risks was clear this past week, when apple
processors changed policy and urged a ban on Alar; the largest U.S.
petroleum company capitulated to demands for more effective oil
spill prevention; and hog farmers expressed alarm about a
mysterious piglet die-off that some studies have linked to
drought-parched corn tainted with aflatoxin, a fungus-produced
poison.
   These developments were coincidental. But they all reflected the
increased sensitivity that businesses have been forced to acquire
in order to thrive in an economy where consumers are focusing more
on their health and surroundings.
   The pressure on companies to quickly respond when questions are
raised about their products or behavior is particularly acute among
vendors of food and other consumer items, as events earlier this
year demonstrated.
   When federal investigators found traces of cyanide in two
imported Chilean grapes in March and temporarily ordered all
Chilean fruit off the shelves, grocers nationwide took
extraordinary steps to assure shoppers their produce was safe.
Wholesalers and retailers absorbed $41 million in losses from
dumped Chilean fruit.
   When a woman in Rogers, Ark. reported that her mouth was burned
after gargling with Listerine antiseptic last month, manufacturer
Warner Lambert Inc. rushed the suspect bottle through laboratory
analysis and found nothing wrong.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. the nation's No. 3 retailer where the
bottle was purchased, temporarily ordered all Listerine off the
shelves in its 26-state chain.
   ``We stand by our decision and feel it was the thing to do,''
Wal-Mart spokesman Donald Shinkle said at the time. ``Our customers
would more than agree with that.''
   It was pressure from customers that provoked apple processors
into an about-face on Alar, Uniroyal Chemical Co.'s marketing name
for an organic acid that keeps apples on the tree until ripe and
prolongs their crispness in storage.
   The processors urged the Environmental Protection Administration
to dissuade growers from using the substance, basing their position
on what they called public hysteria about Alar and its effect on
their business.
   Reports by some consumer groups that Alar poses a health risk to
children have sent sales tumbling this year and devastated the
earnings of apple orchards. Industry figures reported Friday
suggested losses in Washington state, which produces most of the
nation's apples, will exceed $90 million.
   An even more dramatic policy change was announced by Exxon
Corp., the oil giant responsible for the oil spill March 24 in
Alaska's once-pristine Prince William Sound. The company has faced
blistering criticism not only from environmentalists, but
customers, federal regulators and large shareholders.
   A week before the company's annual meeting, Exxon executives
said this past Thursday they would support the appointment of an
environmentalist to the board of directors and consider spending
more money on pollution prevention.
   In other business and economic developments this past week:
   _Government reports that suggested a slowing economy rallied the
stock and bond markets, on the theory that inflation is no longer a
big threat. Wholesale prices and retail sales both rose only 0.4
percent in April, significantly lower than many economists
anticipated.
   _Two significant personalities in the financial world announced
their resignations. Gary Lynch, the Securities and Exchange
Commission's enforcement director who led an unprecedented
crackdown on Wall Street corruption, said he would step down in
August. American Stock Exchange Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr., who
presided over the market's expansion into innovative securities to
compete with bigger rivals, said he would leave when a successor is
named.
   _The targets of potentially hostile takeovers grew to include
the Avon lady and the Dunkin' Donuts man. Direct selling marketer
Amway Corp. announced a $2 billion takeover attempt of its much
larger competitor, Avon Products Inc. A Canadian investment
concern, Kingsbridge Capital Group, said it wanted to buy Dunkin'
Donuts Inc. for at least $300 million. Another target, Ogilvy Group
Inc. has begun talks with Britain's WPP Group PLC, which has
offered to buy the American advertising company for about $800
million but indicated it may increase its bid.

<HEAD>Negative Numbers, Economic Slowdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The outlook for business conditions and business
expansion ``took a dive'' in the latest small-business survey by
the National Federation of Independent Business.
   While the results indicate a definite slowing of the 77-month
expansion, economist William Dunkelberg, who designed the survey,
said it did not portend a recession. He expects growth to continue
at a 2 percent annual rate.
   ``The word is `cooling,''' he said.
   The April survey is one of a quarterly series that obtains
responses from nearly 2,000 smaller businesses _ a series that over
the past decade has had a high degree of accuracy in forecasting
the general economy six months ahead.
   In an overview of the survey results, Dunkelberg said the
outlook for business conditions and business expansion resulted in
the most negative set of figures since the second quarter of 1980.
   He said the findings indicate a slowdown in growth of the gross
national product, employment, inventories and capital spending, and
an upturn in unemployment and inflation.
   Dunkelberg, who is dean of Temple University's school of
business and management, said inflation reports from the responding
companies also added up to ``the most unfavorable set of inflation
figures in the expansion.''
   Only 9 percent of respondents reported lower selling prices in
the first quarter, while a ``stunning'' 36 percent said they raised
prices. Twenty-eight percent of respondents said they plan to raise
prices in the next six months.
   In spite of this, he emphasized that inflation isn't rampant. He
forecast a 5.6 percent annual rate for the second quarter, up from
5.3 percent in the first quarter and 4.7 percent in the second
quarter of 1988.
   While such percentages might seem modest when matched against
the double-digit rates of the 1970s, they are sharply higher than
the rates reported in 1986, when the quarterly percentages never
exceeded 2.6 percent.
   Summarizing the outlook in an interview, Dunkelberg said there
will be a slowdown in growth, but there will be growth. In fact, he
even saw a bright side to the slowdown, saying it will relieve a
lot of pent-up pressure.
   He likened it to an earth tremor that forestalls a destructive
earthquake, saying a slowdown relieves upward pressure on interest
rates, reduces the price stress of consumer demand and allows
needed slack to develop in plant capacity.
   At the same time, he said, the next few months represent a
ticklish time for economic policy. With the Federal Reserve
apparently using interest rates to deal with existing as well as
feared inflation, a downturn could occur.
   He views a slow-moving economy as being vulnerable to shocks and
surprises, pointing out that among other things a considerable
amount of credit has been extended to consumers in the expectation
of continued steady employment.
   ``In the event that this economy falters, fiscal policy is on
the ropes,'' he said, explaining that easy money, in contrast to
today's relatively tight money, may be the only solution.

<HEAD>Record $4 Billion In Junk Bonds Offered in RJR Takeover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The largest deal in history has spawned the
largest corporate bond offering: $4 billion in junk bonds to help
finance the $24.53 billion debt-financed takeover of RJR Nabisco
Inc.
   The huge high-yield bond issue has been the talk of Wall Street
for weeks, with market strategists and investors giving it great
importance because of a recent lapse in the junk bond business and
fears of an economic slowdown.
   It also throws the spotlight on lead underwriter Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. as it tackles the record deal without Michael Milken,
the junk bond industry's chief architect who is under indictment
and out of commission indefinitely.
   ``It's huge,'' said Warren Greene, president of the American
Investors Income Fund Inc. of Greenwich, Conn. ``Four billion
dollars is a lot of money to raise in this market.''
   The offer by RJR Holdings Capital Corp., which became effective
Friday, dwarfs other corporate debt issues. BCI Holdings in 1986
offered $2.5 billion in non-investment grade bonds and Occidental
Petroleum Corp. the same year offered $2.48 billion in
investment-grade bonds. No other offering has exceeded $2 billion.
   The RJR bonds are part of an $8 billion securities package to
raise money for the takeover of Atlanta-based RJR Nabisco by
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., the investment firm that specializes
in buying companies with borrowed money in deals known as leveraged
buyouts.
   The bonds have high yields, partly because of fears that the
sheer size of the offer would deter investment managers who don't
think the market can absorb the load. In fact, some major
institutions are tiptoeing around the non-investment grade bonds
despite universal acclaim for their quality.
   ``When you have such quantities of merchandise thrown on the
market, regardless of how the deep the market is, there is question
about the appetite of any investor,'' said an executive at a major
capital management group that is limiting its takings.
   Drexel priced some of the securities to yield 15 percent, more
than 1 percentage point above what was initially planned.
   The complexity of the deal also could scare off some investors.
Underwriters have structured the bond sales in several tiers, with
the same securities having different prices depending on the amount
purchased. Also, interest rates on some securities will be reset at
certain dates.
   ``It's a complicated transaction,'' said Gloria Vila, a senior
analyst with Moody's Investors Service Inc., a credit rating
agency. ``That's caused some difficulty with buyers.''
   There also is some skepticism about Drexel's ability to manage
the deal without Milken, who took a leave of absence after pleading
innocent to 98 counts of racketeering and securities fraud in March.
   Milken was working during Drexel's sale of $5 billion in
short-term RJR notes earlier this year, which was smoother than the
company's attempt to drum up support of institutional investors for
the current offer.
   ``The absence of Milken is apparent in the delays and the
difficulties as have been perceived in the marketplace,'' the
capital management executive said.
   But he added: ``They still have managed to do it. That's a
credit to Drexel's firepower.''
   The issue lifts Drexel back to the top of the junk bond market,
with 50.2 percent of the $10.96 billion in bonds issued this year,
its highest share since 1985 when it cornered 54.9 percent,
according to Securities Data Co.
   Drexel had stumbled to a 15.9 percent first-quarter share, which
analysts had attributed to the loss of Milken and the bad publicity
over the firm's securities fraud woes.
   The total financing for the RJR transaction will approach $20
billion, including $4 billion in other securities such as preferred
stock issued when the RJR-KKR takeover was completed in April.
   The RJR junk bonds are designed to replace the $5 billion in
short-term bridge notes sold earlier this year by Drexel. Some
variations in the sale are designed to induce investors to exchange
the short-term investment for long-term bonds.
   Despite its size and complexity, many traders believe the market
can absorb the RJR issue because of the stability of the companies
under the food and tobacco giant's umbrella.
   ``The credit strength is there,'' said Ted Reed, vice president
of Aetna Capital Management Inc., which is buying $7 million of the
bonds for its $130 million portfolio. ``In a downturn, that credit
is going to hold up better than a company that makes widgets to
compete with the Japanese. These are pretty high visibility
brand-name products.''
   ``You have to step back from all the trees and look at the
forest and say, `Does RJR have value?' I think the answer is yes,''
said Ed D'Alelio, co-chief investment officer for high-yield bonds
with the Putnam Cos., a financial services firm in Boston.
   Analysts believe the RJR sale will be a benchmark for the $180
billion a year junk bond market, which has been in a tailspin
because of recession talk and a Harvard University report that junk
bonds may have a higher default rate than previously believed.
   ``I always think the more liquidity we have in the market the
better we are,'' said John Moran, a junk bond trader with Advest
Inc. ``I think it's much easier when you have a visible name like
this rather than a company nobody's ever heard of.''

<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS weekly gain in Dow average in 6th graf and CORRECTS
to third-biggest gain of the year; CORRECTS weekly gain in NYSE index in
7th graf.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   There's a three-syllable word Wall Street
analysts are bandying around to describe the stock market's fickle
mood: ``conviction.''
   It's something they say the market _ or, rather, investors _
don't have a whole lot of lately.
   Take, for example, the April report on producer prices. The
market waited all week for Friday's data while traders talked of
higher inflation and gloomy predictions of a recession.
   In the first 30 minutes after the opening bell, the Dow Jones
industrial average zoomed over 40 points, and remained near that
level during most of the day. Traders had been expecting a number
higher than the 0.4 percent rise the Labor Department reported.
   The Dow average closed 56.82 points higher Friday at 2,439.70,
the highest level since the October 1987 stock market collapse and
the biggest daily gain since a 74.68-point rise on May 31, 1988.
   The previous post-crash high was 2,418.99 at the close on April
27. The 57.74-point gain for the week was the third-best this year.
   Among other barometers, the New York Stock Exchange composite
index rose 2.99 for the week to 175.13,; the NASDAQ composite index
for the over-the-counter market rose 4.12 to 434.83; and the
American Stock Exchange market value index edged up 1.46 to 348.30.
   It seems, as one analyst put it, that investors are living and
dying on each piece of economic data shoveled out by the government
_ old data at that.
   ``The biggest problem the market faces is confusion and lack of
conviction because of confusion,'' says Alfred E. Goldman, vice
president of the investment firm A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. ``It
shows this market has little long-term conviction. Otherwise people
wouldn't be so concerned with old news.''
   Traders and the investing public hoped the numbers would unravel
the previous week's confusion over the April employment report. The
report showed more people were out of work _ an indication the
economy might be slowing, while hourly earnings rose a substantial
7 cents _ hinting inflation's tentacles might be stretching.
   The jitters early in the week were reflected in the measly
volume. Despite 221.49 million shares traded on Friday, the week's
volume averaged just 160.87 million shares a day, down from 163.25
million the week before.
   No sooner had some of the excitement died down than traders were
talking about the upcoming consumer price data, another measure of
inflation that some said might not produce the same favorable
results.
   ``People want to keep the economy from overheating. But we keep
getting mixed signals,'' says Thomas Walsh, head of equity trading
at Nikko Securities International. ``It's a critical period in a
very fickle market _ a market with little conviction.''
   The critical period amounts to a turning point in the economy,
according to some economists.
   With no clear-cut, long-term direction, the market is relying on
short-term measurements to give it a jolt even though, as one
expert put it, gambling on the PPI doesn't determine the value of a
company.
   ``Even though there is no conviction with the market trend, it's
difficult (for traders) to explain to clients why they haven't
participated in the last 200 to 300 points,'' said Eugene Peroni,
technical analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott. ``It's a
self-fulfilling thing. The market begins to gain steam and it
pressures those underweighted in equities to come in and commit
funds.''
   Early in the week, the focus was on the Dow Jones industrial
average and an eight-day losing streak, even though the average
lost less over the eight sessions than it often has in one day.
   The explanation for the consecutive losses: ``It's no calamity,
just a lack of conviction,'' said Larry Wachtel, analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Despite the overall uncertainty, some Wall Street analysts
believe ingredients are accumulating for a strong upward move in
the next 12 months. Money managers and large institutional
investors are moving into the market in an orderly fashion, they
say.
   ``The economy is at a turning point,'' said James Solloway,
director of economic research at Argus Research Corp. ``That's why
investors and traders are keying on each statistic. They want to
catch the turning point.''

   You rarely see white-gloved Avon ladies toting
makeup samples door to door these days. And Tupperware parties have
moved from the home to the office.
   The business of direct sales _ long personified by the
salesperson grinning through the screen door and trying to get his
or her foot in it _ has changed dramatically.
   Sales pitches have been adjusted to suit the busy, two-career
times, and markets now stretch around the globe, not just around
the block.
   When Amway Corp. made a $2.1 billion takeover bid for Avon
Products Inc. last week, the deal focused attention on a business
that has quietly shifted from blind calls to target marketing.
   ``It's just not productive to knock on doors at 10 o'clock in
the morning anymore because no one's home,'' says George Hescock,
executive vice president of the Direct Selling Association.
   ``The random calling _ knocking on doors arbitrarily up one side
of the street and down the other _ is clearly less prevalent,''
Hescock says.
   Increasingly, representatives of Avon, Amway or other
direct-selling outfits rely on previous contact with potential
customers before seeking entry to their homes.
   ``The clear pattern is fewer and fewer calls that are made
unannounced at the doorstep,'' according to Hescock. ``There is
some degree of previous acquaintance, a vehicle creating an
entree.''
   Relationships with co-workers are being exploited. For instance,
Tupperware Home Parties, known over the years for presenting its
food storage containers to homemakers, now reaches out to customers
with tight schedules with demonstrations during coffee breaks at
work sites and rush hour parties at places convenient for people to
drop in on their way home from work.
   About a quarter of the company's worldwide annual sales now come
from such party alternatives.
   Direct sellers have had to alter their approaches because more
of their customers _ still predominantly female _ are working
outside the home.
   This shift also means a higher proportion of the women who
typically fill most of the positions in the direct-selling sales
force are employed in offices and other workplaces where they can
deliver their sales pitches to colleagues.
   About 3.6 million people are involved in direct selling in the
United States and about 88 percent of them work at it part time.
Eighty percent of the person-to-person sales force is female,
according to industry figures.
   Besides empty houses, direct sellers have been motivated to
modernize their methods by the personal safety concerns of their
customers. Perhaps now more than ever before, people in high-crime
pockets of the country might think opening their doors to strangers
a foolish thing to do.
   A key reason why direct sellers felt they needed to make some
changes was to preserve their profitability. After booming sales in
the 1960s, they started to see their revenue growth stall in the
early 1970s, partly due to an economic recession in the United
States.
   Much of the 1970s was a trying time for many direct sellers and
the early 1980s didn't bring much relief. Traditional retailers
were drawing away more customers who formerly favored direct
sellers' wares, while fewer women were at home to recruit as sales
agents and fewer were at home to buy.
   U.S. sales in the direct-selling business were essentially flat
from 1982 through 1986 but rebounded to a record $8.8 billion in
1987. The indications are that sales rose about 8 percent in 1988,
setting a new high, the Direct Selling Association says.
   Some of the sales rebound can be attributed to the changes the
direct sellers implemented. They clearly benefited from encouraging
representatives to make more workplace solicitations, from
enhancing the training of their sales reps and revamping their
sales literature.
   The evolution of new non-store retailing techniques also helped
by making consumers aware that there are ways to buy things without
having to venture out to the suburban shopping malls. Those
techniques include mail-order catalogs, home-shopping television
networks, videotex units and direct, person-to-person, contacts.
   A recent report by the New York-based market research firm
FIND-SVP says the development of non-store retailing is generating
billions of dollars of sales that might never have existed if
consumers only shopped at conventional retail establishments.
   The greatest growth opportunities for direct sellers lie outside
the United States. Japan is by far the biggest direct selling
market in the world, about twice the size of the U.S. market, by
conservative estimates.
   Cultural factors largely account for the Japanese preference for
buying things through direct-sales respresentatives. Even things
like automobiles are sold in this manner in Japan.
   Other Pacific Basin countries in which traditional retail
distribution channels are not well developed also are considered
high-growth areas by direct sellers. Indonesia, Malaysia and
Thailand, to name just three, have been identified as key countries
for direct-selling expansion.
   Developing countries in Latin America also appeal to direct
sellers. In fact, the presence Avon has in Central and South
America apparently was one of the things that convinced competitor
Amway to propose its takeover. The acquisition would fill a hole
for Amway, which already is peddling goods in more than 40
countries.

<HEAD>Stocks, Bonds Rally on News of Slower Inflation</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For Saturday PMs</HEAD>

   A report that wholesale prices rose moderately in April
triggered furious rallies in the stock and bond markets and sent
interest rates reeling lower.
   The stock market posted its biggest one-day gain in nearly a
year on Friday and bond prices recorded their largest advance since
last September.
   The Labor Department said that despite a steep 7.2 percent climb
in energy costs, wholesale prices rose only 0.4 percent in April or
about half as much as many market watchers had expected.
   The rise in energy prices largely was offset by a broad fall in
food prices and by a substantial decline in auto costs.
   The financial markets have been restrained in recent weeks by
concerns that inflation was accelerating even as economic growth
slowed. Those worries have deepened as oil prices have climbed,
threatening to boost the costs of producing a wide range of items,
including gasoline.
   But the price report appeared to reduce chances that the Federal
Reserve would be forced to push interest rates higher in a bid to
restrain inflation.
   Rising interest rates put stock yields at a competitive
disadvantage to those available on new issues of Treasury bills and
notes, drive up the costs of business borrowing and erode the
corporate earnings outlook.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
climbed 56.82 points to settle at a new post-crash high of 2,439.70.
   The Dow's previous high since its Oct. 19, 1987 crash was
2,418.99 set on April 27. Friday's gain was the biggest one-day
rise since a 74.68-point jump on May 31, 1988.
   Broader market indicators also rose in active trading, with more
than three issues gaining for every one that fell among issues
listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The indication of slowing inflation also helped the bond market,
whose investors dread inflation because it erodes the value of
fixed-income holdings such as Treasury notes and bonds.
   Prices of some 30-year Treasury bonds posted gains of more than
$23 for every $1,000 in face value, the biggest gain since a $26.62
advance last Sept. 2. Yields tumbled to 8.83 percent from 9.06
percent late Thursday.
   Yields on short-term Treasury issues also dropped as much as a
quarter of a percentage point.
   The April advance in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index
for finished goods, one stop short of retail, followed an identical
0.4 percent gain in March and 1 percent jumps in January and
February.
   In a separate report Friday, the Commerce Department said
business inventories in March rose 0.3 percent while sales were
flat, confirming earlier government statistics showing economic
growth slowing.
   In another economic report, fixed-rate home mortgages slipped to
an average of 10.93 percent this week compared with 10.97 percent
last week, according to a national survey released by the Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
