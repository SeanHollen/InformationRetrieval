<HEAD>U.N. Agrees To Resume Aid To Somalia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Nations agreed to resume food shipments
to Somalia after the government pledged to stop arming refugees and
resettle them away from areas affected by civil war, a U.N. official
said Wednesday.
   Somalia has been accused of arming refugees from neighboring
Ethiopia to fight rebels of the Somali National Movement in the
north. Somalia says Ethiopia's Marxist government is aiding the
rebels.
   The accord announced Wednesday paved the way for U.N. food
shipments via the Somalian port of Berbera to resume this week after
about a two-week suspension, said Arthur E. Dewey, a U.N. Deputy
High Commissioner for Refugees.
   The U.N. agency plans to have observers in a new resettlement
camp to guard against re-arming of refugees, Dewey told a news
conference after completing negotiations with Somali officials last
week.
   The pact sets a three-month deadline for continued U.N. food
shipments for six camps before all refugees there must be disarmed
and relocated to safe areas, Dewey said.
   U.S. officials said last month that reports of widespread human
rights violations in Somalia prompted a cutoff of U.S. military aid
last summer and that $55 million in economic assistance is being
withheld.
   Dewey said the Somali government has pledged its ``best efforts''
to stop the flow of weapons to refugees, but he warned that
detection of arms could trigger a U.N. aid cutoff in the future.
   The U.N. agency expects the resettlement of 70,000-80,000
refugees, mostly Ethiopians, to take six weeks once detailed plans
are set later this week, he said.
   Following government wishes, the most likely resettlement site
will be near the city of Boroma, near the Ethiopian border and about
90 miles northwest of the current camps along the road from Berbera
to Hargeisa inland, he said.
   Many Ethiopians began fleeing into neighboring Somalia in the
early 1980s following a border dispute between the two countries and
more arrived during the 1984-85 drought in Ethiopia.

   A federal appeals court on Wednesday upheld a
lower court ruling that vacated the 1977 convictions of former
Maryland Gov. Marvin Mandel and five others in a political
corruption case.
   The tie vote by the full 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in
Richmond, Va., could be the final stop for a political scandal that
turned into a prolonged legal battle for the ex-governor as he
sought vindication from charges that he misused his powers to help
his associates' horse racing business.
   However, U.S. Attorney for Maryland Breckinridge Willcox said he
would ask the Justice Department to authorize an appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   ``It encourages me to think that there's enough uncertainty over
this very issue that it needs Supreme Court review,'' Willcox said.
   The appeals court voted 5-5 on a prosecution request to re-hear
an appeal that had been denied by a three-judge panel of the court
in December, Willcox said. A tie vote means rejection of the request.
   ``We are gratified that after more than a decade, the Mandel case
now appears to be over,'' Mandel's Baltimore attorney, Arnold
Weiner, said in a statement.
   In 1975, while he was still governor, Mandel was charged with
helping five men obtain extra racing days for Marlboro Race Track.
He also was accused of accepting $350,000 in gifts and financial
help in a divorce settlement.
   Indicted on the mail fraud charges halfway through his second
four-year term, Mandel remained in office until the day he was
sentenced.
   He won a reversal on appeal, allowing him to regain the
governor's office for the last days of his term, which expired in
1979. But another appeals court reinstated the conviction, forcing
Mandel to serve 14 months at a federal prison camp.
   In November 1987, U.S. District Judge Frederic Smalkin set aside
the mail fraud convictions on grounds that Mandel's trial jury was
improperly allowed to consider a theory of mail fraud law that has
since been overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   The Supreme Court ruled in June 1987 that the federal mail fraud
statutes cannot be used to prosecute public officials for defrauding
citizens of their ``intangible rights'' to honest government.
   In December, three judges of the appeals court agreed with
Smalkin.

<HEAD>South Carolina Begins Enforcing Waste Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TRIP DuBARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Carolina on Wednesday barred
hazardous waste from 32 states and Puerto Rico, and put extra
inspectors at the state's only commercially operated landfill to
turn away trucks from the banned states.
   The federal Environmental Protection Agency expressed concern
about the ban and called for an ``equitable solution.'' Two of the
banned states, Florida and North Carolina, began efforts to regain
access to South Carolina's single, privately owned landfill.
   South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control
announced Tuesday that only 17 other states and the District of
Columbia would be allowed to continue disposing hazardous waste in
the state beginning Wednesday.
   The ban was the result of a Jan. 18 executive order by Gov.
Carroll Campbell, who said South Carolina would stop taking
hazardous waste from any state that prohibits hazardous waste
dumping within its own borders.
   Campbell said the ban was meant to encourage other states to
locate disposal sites within their own borders rather than relying
on South Carolina.
   Ten extra inspectors stood ready Wednesday at the GSX Services
landfill on the shore of Lake Marion, about 40 miles southeast of
the state capital of Columbia. But all loads that arrived on the
first day of the ban were from approved states, according to health
department spokesman Bill Culler.
   ``It looks like the word got around and there haven't been a
whole lot of problems,'' Culler said.
   The site accepts 135,000 tons of hazardous waste annually,
including solvents, acids and other chemical garbage. About 70
percent of the waste comes from out of state; about 45 percent from
the banned states.
   The GSX site is one of only two commercial hazardous waste
landfills in the Southeast. The other is in Emelle, Ala.
   South Carolina officials said they would consider dropping states
from the banned list if the states prove they're willing to dump
hazardous waste on their own soil.
   Officials from both Florida and North Carolina, the two largest
contributors to South Carolina's dump, said they hoped to take that
pledge.
   The head of Florida's Department of Environmental Regulation,
Dale Twachtmann, has written South Carolina officials asking them to
reconsider the decision, according to Raoul Clarke, an administrator
with the Florida agency.
   North Carolina Gov. Jim Martin said legislation has been proposed
to repeal North Carolina's ban on a hazardous waste landfill. He
added that he understood Campbell's irritation with other states'
inaction on hazardous waste.
   The federal EPA's Southeastern administrator, Greer Tidwell,
issued a statement saying the South Carolina ban ``underscores the
need for the states to work towards an equitable solution of the
problem.''

<HEAD>Woman Arrested At David Letterman's Home to Undergo Competency Hearing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A competency hearing was ordered
Wednesday for a woman who has been arrested three times after
illegally entering the home of late-night talk show host David
Letterman.
   The hearing for Margaret Ray, 36, has been scheduled for March 15.
   Ray was arraigned in Norwalk Superior Court and told to undergo a
psychiatric examination March 8. She was held in lieu of $5,000 bail.
   Ray was arrested Tuesday after being found inside Letterman's for
a third time and was charged with tresspassing, burglary, possession
of marijuana and larceny, police said.
   Police said the larceny charge was filed when police discovered
Ray wearing one of Letterman's watches.
   Ray was arrested Friday on a charge of criminal trespassing when
she was found wandering in the foyer of Letterman's home, police
said. She told police then that she had decided to pay Letterman ``a
surprise visit.''
   Last spring, she was involved in a series of trespassing
incidents at Letterman's home, and was arrested while driving his
Porsche near the Lincoln Tunnel in New York City. She identified
herself as Mrs. Letterman, authorities said.
   In September, Ray was ordered to undergo psychiatric treatment
and given two years' accelerated probation.
   During Wednesday's court appearance, Ray's attorney, Anita
Casson, said her client did not intend to steal the watch. Casson
said Ray was attempting to clean Letterman's house and wanted to see
how much time it took.
   New Canaan police said they received a complaint around 2 p.m.
Tuesday of an ``unwanted person'' in Letterman's home. The complaint
was not filed by Letterman, Lt. William Ferri said.
   Letterman is the host of ``Late Night with David Letterman'' on
NBC. Spokesmen for NBC and Letterman's manager, Jack Rollins,
referred all questions to New Canaan police.

   President George Vassiliou of Cyprus said Thursday
that the Greek majority in his country was willing to make
substantial concessions to the island's Turkish minority.
   Vassiliou met with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to discuss
his talks with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
   Vassiliou said the Greek Cypriot majority is willing to make
``very extensive concessions'' to unify the island.
   In a lecture to the Royal Institute of International Affairs, he
said the partition of a small island such as Cyprus ``made no sense
... It is not a solution economically.''
   Vassiliou and Denktash will hold an intensive series of meetings
between March 6 and March 28 in an attempt to find a formula to
reunify the island into a two-state federation.
   The U.N.-mediated talks so far have deadlocked on several issues,
including withdrawal of about 30,000 Turkish troops stationed in
Denktash's breakaway Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and the
authority of the two states in the federation.
   Vassiliou said Greek Cypriots were ``willing and ready to make
very extensive concessions in the field of power-sharing with the
Turkish Cypriot community.
   ``The idea of demilitarization envisages the total withdrawal of
all non-Cypriot forces from the Republic of Cyprus and the
disbanding of all Cypriot armed forces,'' he said.
   A united and stable Cyprus under a federal constitution ``would
pose much less of a threat to Turkey than a divided, embittered and
hostile Cyprus,'' he said.
   The island was unofficially partitioned in 1974 when the Turkish
army invaded after a Greek-inspired coup intended to unite the
island with Greece.

   J.Z. Knight, who says a 35,000-year-old
warrior uses her to speak to entertainers Shirley MacLaine, Linda
Evans and others, has filed for divorce from her husband of five
years.
   Mrs. Knight is known as the ``channeler'' for Ramtha, a wise man

followers who pay fees to attend the sessions.
   Knight's estranged husband, Jeffrey Knight, left the family home
near Yelm, about 25 miles south of Tacoma, in October. He is seeking
$10,000 a month in spousal maintenance.
   Through his lawyer, Grant Harken, he said he and his wife had a
premarital agreement to divide assets from their ventures, including
Ramtha Dialogues Inc. and an Arabian horse stud farm.
   He claims Ramtha brings in about $240,000 a month in income from
seminars, book royalties and tape sales. No estimate was available
on revenues from the horses.
   Calls to J.Z. Knight's listed phone numbers at the farm went
unanswered Wednesday night.
   The divorce trial is set for April 10 in Pierce County Superior
Court in Tacoma.

<DATELINE>SCHWALBACH AM TAUNUS, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Faced with a public
outcry, West Germany is about to tighten up its liberal asylum law
that has attracted refugees from as near as Czechoslovakia and as
far away as Sri Lanka.
   More than 27,600 asylum-seekers arrived last year at the
Schwalbach camp just outside Frankfurt, roughly one quarter of the
nationwide total.
   And they are still coming at a record pace, despite the
controversy surrounding them and charges that many come not in
search of freedom from political persecution but for their own
economic betterment.
   ``Germany is good and maybe they will grant me political
asylum,'' said a 28-year-old Nigerian standing in the crowded halls
of the tidy, modern camp here.
   He explained that fighting between Christians and Moslems in his
country led him to come.
   A 21-year-old Tamil said Indian troops sent to his native Sri
Lanka prompted his departure.
   Marem Taraky, a 40-year-old teacher from Kabul in Afghanistan
said she will stay out of her country ``until peace returns.''
   Most of the asylum-seekers arriving at the Frankfurt airport are
driven by bus to the camp, which is at the end of a mud-covered
road. But some, usually people who arrived with tourist visas, take
the subway in Frankfurt to the end of the line and walk the rest of
the way.
   West German officials say some people cross on foot over West
Germany's southern borders.
   ``Some Poles come here directly with their cars and say, `Here I
am,''' said Volker Moeser, the camp director.
   So far this year, the largest number of refugees arriving at the
state-run Schwalbach camp have come from Turkey, followed in order
by Sri Lanka, Poland, Iran, Afghanistan, India, Ghana, Yugoslavia,
Somalia and Lebanon.
   Moeser said some of the refugees _ mainly the ones who speak some
English or German _ are aware of the heated political debate
surrounding the political asylum issue.
   Asylum-seekers throughout the country occasionally are the
targets of violence.
   On Feb. 14, unknown assailants fire-bombed a home for
asylum-seekers in the northern Bavarian town of Memmelsdorf. Damage
was minor, and none of the 15 Poles and Hungarians inside were
injured.
   A similar attack took place at a home for asylum-seekers in
nearby Bamberg the following day. About the same time as that
attack, five so-called ``skinheads'' picked a fight with an Indian
asylum-seeker in the Hesse state town of Schluechtern, injuring the
refugee and two skinheads.
   While violence still is limited, general dissatisfaction among
Germans with the number of asylum-seekers continues to grow after
the number hit 103,076 last year.
   That was reflected by the surprisingly strong showing by the
right-wing extremist Republican Party in West Berlin elections in
January. The party ran on a platform calling for expulsion of
asylum-seekers as well as foreign workers, whom West Germany
welcomed in the early years of its postwar economic boom.
   The rising negative sentiment has led Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) to set up a committee to work out
measures for ``the prevention of massive abuse of the asylum laws.''
   Under the current system, anyone who claims that he or she faces
persecution back home generally is entitled to seek asylum along
with immediate family members.
   Kohl says his coalition government is most interested in
excluding ``economic asylum seekers,'' people who are mainly
interested in escaping poverty back home. Other reported abuses
include cases of East Europeans who come in search of asylum but
occasionally go back home for visits.
   The chancellor promised quick action but did not outline any
timetable.
   ``We're looking into steps that can be taken without a change in
the constitution,'' CDU member of parliament Michael Maiworm told
reporters in Bonn.
   The chairman of the group is Johannes Gerster, a Christian
Democratic member of parliament who already has called for hearings
on asylum requests within 48 hours of arrival in West Germany. A
shortening of the appeals process is also under review.
   The Free Democrats, the junior partner in Kohl's coalition, have
already signalled a willingness to tighten up the political asylum
procedures in this country of 61.3 million people.
   While generally less than 10 percent of the asylum-seekers are
granted such status, lengthy legal proceedings and other policies
often allow the refugees to stay in West Germany almost
indefinitely. That includes a ban on sending people back to regions
wracked by war or other widespread violence.
   As a general rule, the asylum-seekers are barred from working in
West Germany for either one year or five years, depending on their
status. That means they live at government expense, often lodged in
hotels or guest houses.
   The Bild am Sonntag newspaper published an article recently
claiming that asylum-seekers will cost West Germany $2.8 billion
this year.

<HEAD>Swiss Journalist Fired For Backing Rushdie Death Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Switzerland's biggest media company
says it has fired a reporter for publicly supporting Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini's death decree against Salman Rushdie, author of
``The Satanic Verses.''
   The Ringier concern said it gave three months' notice to Ahmed
Huber, a well-known Swiss journalist and convert to Islam.
   Huber's ``unconditional support of crazy Khomeini's death
sentence on Rushdie leaves only one solution,'' company president
Christoph Ringier wrote in reply to a reader's complaint.
   A copy of Ringier's reply was obtained by The Associated Press.
   The Berner Zeitung newspaper on Feb. 17 quoted Huber as saying he
supports the death ``sentence'' for Rushdie, a naturalized Briton
born to a Moslem family in India, ``because there can be no other
punishment for this blasphemy based on selfishness and
profiteering.''
   Huber made similar statements in a television interview. The
longtime reporter on government affairs for Ringier's Schweizer
Illustrierte magazine, says he was fired from two previous jobs for
his beliefs.
   Khomeini, Iran's fundamentalist patriarch, last month called on
Moslems to seek out and kill Rushdie for writing ``The Satanic
Verses,'' which many Moslems consider blasphemous.
   Khomeini's order created an international uproar, with the
governments of more than a dozen European countries recalling their
ambassadors from Tehran in response. The book has been banned in
countries including India, Pakistan, Lebanon and Kenya.

   Thieves raided a museum display case and
made off with two softball-sized shrunken heads worth at least
$15,000 each, the director of the plundered archeology museum said.
   ``The thief or thieves simply unscrewed one of the glass panes of
the case and walked away with the two heads,'' Orlando Marques de
Paiva, director of the ethnology and archeology Museum of Ipiranga,
said by telephone Wednesday.
   He said the heads were war trophies of the warlike Jivaro
Indians, who live in the jungles of Ecuador. The Jivaros decapitate
prisoners captured during tribal wars and use the victims' shrunken
heads as trophies.
   Paiva said the heads were stolen Thursday from an exhibit that
also contained animal heads shrunken by the Jivaros. One of the
heads was donated to the museum in 1932, the other nine years ago,
Paiva said.

   Guatemala's National Reconciliaton
Commission has begun meeting _ but without the rebels, the army or
the exiled political opposition it was designed to bring together to
end decades of civil war.
   The commission, which met Wednesday, was created under an
18-month-old Central American peace plan designed to end
insurgencies in El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala.
   Guatemalan rightists fiercely oppose talks with leftist
guerrillas. An abortive coup last year followed a meeting between
President Vinicio Cerezo and rebel representatives, the last meeting
he has held with them.
   The commission includes representatives of labor unions, the
media, educators, clergymen and most of the country's political
parties.
   The government is represented on the commission by Vice President
Roberto Carpio and 15 elected local delegates.
   But the panel does not include representatives of the rebels, the
military, the private sector and the exiled political opposition.
The group has no set meeting schedule and is expected to meet on and
off during the next few months, commission members said.
   The Christian Democratic government has so far refused to say if
it will try to implement any accord the commission might reach.

   Jazz trumpeter Woody Shaw, who began losing his
sight to degenerative eye disease three years ago, was in stable
condition Wednesday after his left arm was amputated following a
subway accident.
   Shaw, 44, also a composer and arranger, rose to prominence in the
early 1960s playing with jazz saxophonist Eric Dolphy. After Dolphy
died in 1964, Shaw played with bebop greats Bud Powell and Kenny
Clarke.
   He later played with McCoy Tyner, Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock,
Jackie McLean, Art Blakey and Dexter Gordon.
   Shaw's father, Woody Sr., told the Daily News that his son
suffers from retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative disease of the
eyes, and began going blind about three years ago.
   ``His blindness didn't affect his playing,'' Shaw said, noting
that his son had performed around Europe until his return in October
to the United States.
   Surgeons at Bellevue Hospital were forced to amputate the arm
Tuesday after Shaw tumbled down a flight of stairs at a Brooklyn
subway station and then rolled off the platform onto the tracks,
where he was struck by a train, said John Clark, a hospital
administrator.
   Clark said Shaw remained in stable condition Wednesday.
   Transit police officer Tim Griffin said Shaw had no recollection
of getting hit by the train.
   Jazz drummer Max Roach told the Daily News he sent a limousine to
Shaw's home in Newark, N.J., Sunday night to bring Shaw to hear him
perform at the Village Vanguard.
   He said Shaw left before the end of the show and asked a club
security guard to put him in a taxi.
   ``How he got to where he got in the subway is a big gap,'' Roach
said. ``I haven't been able to sleep since. I was really responsible
for getting him back home. I felt really bad.''

   Liu Guangyong squatted next to her
possessions outside the main Canton railway station, one of the 2.5
million peasants who have descended on this prosperous region in
search of good jobs at good wages.
   She and a group of 16 people from her village in central Sichuan
province arrived Monday in this capital of Guangdong province after
riding the rails for three days and three nights. By the following
day, however, it was clear they could not get the garment factory
jobs they thought were available.
   ``We got no jobs. So we just slept on the road outside the
factory,'' Liu, a mother of two, said as she guarded a meager pile
of clothing and toiletries.
   Her group was among legions of disappointed job seekers who
returned to the train station Tuesday to try to obtain tickets to go
back to their villages.
   ``Why don't they add more trains to take us home?'' the woman
asked.
   Peasants from the interior of China have long flocked to coastal
Guangdong province to work the textile, toy and other factories set
up largely with capital from the neighboring British colony of Hong
Kong, 90 miles to the southeast of Canton.
   China's official Statistics Bureau said the average annual wage
in Guangdong last year was $586 per worker, or about double the
national average.
   But the crush in February, in which an army of itinerant workers
roughly equal to the population of the city of Atlanta descended on
the province, clearly surprised authorities, who said Guangdong did
not have work for so many people.
   Guangdong officials claimed the onslaught, estimated by official
media at 2.5 million people, occurred when migrant laborers who
briefly returned home for the Chinese Lunar New Year that began Feb.
6 and convinced fellow villagers they could strike it rich in the
province.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said public security, transport
and hygiene in Guangdong were strained by the influx. Crime was up,
and begging was expected to rise, it said.
   The Guangdong government ordered factories not to hire new
employees from other provinces, issued an urgent appeal to the rest
of China to prevent people from coming, and threatened to kick out
the itinerants who did not leave on their own. As of Tuesday, 20,000
people reportedly were leaving the province daily, and Guangdong
officials said the situation was improving.
   Ma Shenwu, a 38-year-old peasant who arrived with five friends
from Hunan, a province on Guangdong's eastern border, was back at
the Canton station Tuesday after failing to find a job in four towns.
   ``We have to borrow money to go home,'' he said.
   Liu Qian, 18, also was at the station trying to return to her
village in neighboring Hunan province after she failed to get a job
at an electronics factory in Shenzhen, a special economic zone next
to Hong Kong.
   She said the factory boss refused to employ her and five friends
she had brought from home because they did not have the proper
permits.
   ``When I was in Hunan, the government office was off for the
festival so I could not renew my permit,'' she said.
   Rural peasants were not the only ones who rushed to Guangdong.
Sitting next to a group of peasants at the railway station were
several fashionably clothed women from Shanghai wearing makeup and
earrings.
   ``We were deceived. They told us we could earn 700 yuan ($188) a
month in Shenzhen, but we found it was less than 300 ($81), and 16
hours work a day. We were cheated,'' one of them said.
   ``We worked for two weeks and decided to leave,'' another added.
   Unlike the job-seekers from the countryside, the Shanghai women
kept smiling as they told their story because they had jobs waiting
for them in a clothing factory back home.
   ``When we left (Shanghai), our boss asked us not to leave and
said he would welcome us back. We can even charge this trip to him.
So we see this trip as a holiday,'' the first girl said.
   China's migrant labor force, estimated at 20 million, is a
byproduct of the nation's easing of travel restrictions and of
market-oriented reforms which have encouraged labor mobility.
   The influx of peasants to the cities has helped solve problems of
surplus labor in the farming areas and provided workers for
factories and the booming construction industry.
   Last fall, the government announced a cutback on investment
credit and a halt to thousands of construction projects to reduce
inflation and cool the overheated economy.

<TEXT>
   Inside the house where Ferdinand Marcos
grew up, an open casket containing the body of his mother is still
displayed nearly a year after her death.
   A slip of paper, resting on the glass that covers her face, marks
the number of days since her death.
   Although the paper does not mention President Corazon Aquino, its
message is clear: the body of Josefa Edralin-Marcos would have been
buried long ago if the president had allowed Marcos to return from
exile.
   But Mrs. Aquino, citing national security, has refused to permit
the ailing 71-year-old Marcos to return from Hawaii, where he fled
after being ousted as president in a popular-military uprising three
years ago.
   And so the house of Marcos has become more a mausoleum than a
museum.
   Gone are the large crowds that turned out to view ``Dona Josefa''
when the body was brought last year from Manila to this town in
Ilocos Norte province, 240 miles north of the capital.
   National newspapers in Manila as well as most of the country's 58
million people have all but forgotten the endless wake for Dona
Josefa, except for the occasional crude joke in the capital about
``Marcos' mummy.''
   But a curious mix of tourists, relatives, Marcos loyalists and
religious fanatics still gather daily to view the body and a display
of Marcos' furnishings, newspaper clippings and war medals.
   They offer prayers not only for the soul of the former school
teacher but for the return of Marcos from exile.
   Although Mrs. Edralin-Marcos died May 4 in Manila at age 95, her
family postponed burial indefinitely in the hope that Mrs. Aquino
would relent and allow Marcos to return home for the funeral.
   Relatives say a mortician visits the museum every two months to
inject Mrs. Edralin-Marcos with embalming fluid. The body is dressed
in a white embroidered gown that covers all but her face, which is
heavily made up.
   Masses were said in several churches in the area on Feb. 15, Mrs.
Edralin-Marcos' 96th birthday, residents said.
   ``She looks so fresh,'' said Marcos' niece, Cynthia Poblete-Chan,
as she gazed at her grandmother's body. ``We're just waiting for
their (Marcos') word,'' when to bury her in the family plot at the
eastern edge of this town.
   Banners with slogans such as ``The Whole Filipino Nation is
Condoling'' hang on the walls of the family home, along with
pictures of Marcos, his wife Imelda and other mementos of his life.
   Three times a day, a small group of Marcos supporters gathers
around the bier to pray the rosary.
   Residents have been joined recently by members of a religious
sect, the ``Alpha-Omega,'' who believe that the return of Marcos is
part of a divine plan for the Philippines. Cult members, dressed in
red and blue shirts printed with the words ``Alpha-Omega'' keep an
almost daily watch by the bier.
   When Mrs. Poblete-Chan appeared during a recent wake, cult
members knelt before her and kissed her hand reverently.
   Teresita Maglahus, a spokeswoman for the group, said the cultists
followed Mrs. Edralin-Marcos' body to Batac after their leader,
known only as ``Mama Rose,'' received a ``vision from God.''
   ``Lola (Mrs. Edralin-Marcos) needs prayers for her soul,'' Miss
Maglahus said. ``Nothing can stop God and the return of Marcos. If
people only knew who Marcos is, they would kneel down in front of
him.''
   In a town where Marcos is still revered, officials say the wake
could go on indefinitely until the former president himself gives
the word for burial.
   ``Personally, I want her to be buried so her soul can rest,''
said Vice Mayor Rodolfo Yadao, a member of Marcos' New Society
Movement party.
   Meanwhile, he said the number of visitors to the town and its
chief attraction, the Marcos museum, has doubled since the body was
brought here.

<HEAD>Sixth Body Identified in Serial Killings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ``street person'' with a history of
cocaine and heroin use was identified as the sixth female victim in
serial killings under investigation in southeastern Massachusetts,
investigators said Wednesday.
   The woman was identified as 25-year-old Deborah McConnell of
Newport, R.I. Her body was the last of six to be identified after
they were discovered from July to December 1988.
   All six victims were found in wooded areas along highways just
outside New Bedford. An extensive search for more bodies continued
weeks after the sixth body was discovered, but no more have been
found.
   Bristol County District Attorney Ronald Pina said as many as four
other missing females may also be victims.
   Like the other five victims, McConnell, who had a drug record,
had ties to New Bedford's seedy Weld Square district, an area known
for the availability of drugs and prostitutes, Pina said.
   ``She was known to be a street person in the Fall River area,''
Pina said. ``She had been a street person in the New Bedford area
for the last year.''
   McConnell's husband and 10-year-old daughter live in Newport,
said Pina.
   Deborah McConnell knew at least one of the other murder victims _
Nancy Paiva of New Bedford _ and also may have known two others,
Pina said.
   Forensics expert Dr. Douglas Uebelaker of the Smithsonian
Institution said weeks ago, before McConnell had been positively
identified, that the woman was killed sometime in March 1988.
   Identifying the body was delayed because no one reported
McConnell missing last year and investigators could not find her
dental records.
   Late last year, when the investigation was gaining wide
publicity, McConnell's father came forward and said he had not seen
her in months, Pina said. Eventually, X-ray records enabled
Uebelaker to identify the woman.
   Pina said he plans to go before a grand jury for the first of two
days of testimony on Thursday. And he said he was planning to use
the grand jury as an investigative tool and expected no indictments.
   Pina has said his list of suspects remains at three or four and
that not all of the suspects are from Massachusetts.

   British rock star Sting announced the
start of a worldwide campaign to raise funds for creation of South
America's largest native Indian reservation.
   Sting, along with Indian chiefs Raoni and Megaron of the
Txukahamae tribe, has created the Virgin Forest foundation that will
financially support a government Indian agency's efforts to expand a
reserve.
   The reserve, which covers 6.18 million acres inhabited by 2,700
Indians in 17 tribes, would be enlarged by nearly 29 million acres.
   The rock singer said Wednesday the foundation would be apolitical.
   ``We don't want to interfere in the country's internal affairs,''
Sting said.
   He said he would travel with Raoni and Megaron to France,
Belgium, West Germany, Italy, Spain, England, the United States,
Canada and Japan and make television appearances to raise funds for
the organization.
   ``We need to capture the imagination of the whole world,'' Sting
said.

   Actress Lynn Redgrave says film and
television producers continue denying her employment because she
sued MCA Inc. almost eight years ago.
   ``People don't very much like somebody like me who will actually
stand up and say, `There's been a wrong done and you've got to stop
it,' '' the 45-year-old actress said Wednesday at a news conference.
``It's absolutely amazing how lies and falsehoods can stick.''
   Miss Redgrave's $10 million lawsuit, which was dismissed, stemmed
from her ouster in 1981 from the CBS comedy ``House Calls.'' She
said she was fired for breast-feeding her newborn daughter on the
set. The studio said she left in a salary dispute.
   She said that while she has been unable to obtain steady work in
the United States, she did star in three British movies last year
and has made several commercials.

   Donald Trump says the fashion-model wife of a
tycoon whose publications have bashed his development projects asked
him out for a date.
   But Allison Stern, wife of Leonard Stern, dismissed Trump's claim
as the false ``product of ajuvenile mind.''
   The Trump-Mrs. Stern date-or-no-date exchange was triggered by a
profile of Trump in Sunday's New York Daily News, which quoted an
unidentified source about the alleged invitation. On Monday, Stern
accused Trump of planting the rumor.
   Trump, who is married, responded: ``Leonard Stern understands
exactly what's going on. He knows. He knows. ... Maybe he should
speak to his wife.'' He added later, ``Allison called for a date.
... and I wasn't interested.''
   Mrs. Stern fired back: ``This absurd charge ... is totally false
and designed by him to inhibit and intimidate my husband's
publications _ The Village Voice and 7 Days _ from covering Mr.
Trump's public activities. As in the past, his unethical tactics
will fail.''

   Author Chet Flippo, longtime friend of slain
Beatle John Lennon, said he's surprised by ``parasitic, would-be
tell-all books'' about Lennon.
   ``Because John was always pretty much an open book, there didn't
seem to be much call for any amplification of his life,'' Flippo
wrote in this week's TV Guide.
   Flippo, author of ``Yesterday,'' the unauthorized biography of
ex-Beatle Paul McCartney, was particularly critical of Albert
Goldman's ``The Lives of John Lennon.''
   He called Goldman's assessment of Lennon's life with Yoko Ono and
son Sean ``pure junk, as far as I know. ... John was certainly no
angel. Most of the time he was much worse. Which is to say, he was
perfectly human.''

and two old soldiers whose World War II exploits form part of the
movie.
   The movie tells, in part, the story of Wilfred Barnett, 67, and
William Stones, 68, who endured years building the notorious
Burma-Siam railway as prisoners of the Japanese. Later, while being
shipped to Japan, their convoy was bombed by the Allies and they
were cast adrift on a raft for five days.
   The former Sarah Ferguson, who is married to Prince Andrew, told
Barnett and Stones at Wednesday night's premiere that she had read

   Workshop topics include ``The Future of Food'' and
``Can Recipes Travel Through Time.''
   But before you get indigestion over the idea that the 11th annual
gathering of the International Association of Cooking Professionals
was a bit ethereal, they concentrated on what is yummy to the tummy,
too.
   Albert Kumin's ``Luxuriate in Chocolate'' was the most popular
workshop, according to convention spokeswoman Valerie Bergman.
Kumin, a renowned pastry chef and confectioner, designed menus for
the White House.
   To be sure, the convention could get a little technical. For
example, a workshop in ``High-Tech Tips for Fail-Safe Recipes'' was
clearly not for the kind of cook who relies on Hamburger Helper.
   But it wasn't all hard work.
   Participants sampled some of the goodies and will be allowed to
kick up their heels during ``Wine Tasting _ A Personal Sensory
Analysis,'' ``Ways With Walnuts,'' or the ``Fisherman's Feast,''
billed as the ``finale'' that includes a ``bounty of fish from the
North Atlantic.''
   ``I think the most exciting thing is that people who like to eat
are people who like life,'' said Janeen Sarlin, a cooking teacher
who is one of nearly 400 participants in the convention that ends
Saturday. ``If I learn just one thing, some new way of doing
something this week, it'll be worth it.''

   Sherry Wall wants to become the Jane

   Wall said she has received about 20 calls from prospective
customers since she started speaking on the radio and distributing
fliers last month, promoting her aerobic exercise course for dogs.
   ``Dogs are very social animals, and many of them are alone eight,
10, 12 hours a day,'' she said. ``They turn into real couch
potatoes.''
   Wall, a veterinary technician and dog groomer, plans to begin
teaching exercise classes for dogs and their owners at a shopping
center in this Milwuakee suburb in late March.
   The exercises, she said, are takeoffs on common calisthenics for
humans and should be easily mastered by any dog that has had basic
obedience training.
   ``A sit-up goes from a sit-down position to a jump,'' she said.
``And a push-up is sit to lie-down.''
   Her two Dobermans, Dobie and Dylan, do those exercises and
others, she said, adding that they also willingly offer their front
paws for some aerobic dance steps.

<HEAD>Art School Reopens Controversial Exhibit to Students, Staff Only</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A controversial exhibit using an American flag
spread on the floor at the School of the Art Institute will go back
on display, but not for public viewing, officials said Wednesday.
   The display will be only for students, faculty and staff of the
museum school, but the move drew immediate protest from veterans'
groups, which filed a lawsuit late Wednesday to remove the flag.
   ``What we're objecting to, of course ... is that it is the
American flag and the flag is being disgraced, walked on,'' said
John Mahoney of the American Legion.
   ``This is totally unacceptable to the veterans groups,'' said
Joseph A. Morris, general counsel for the Mid-America Legal
Foundation, which represents the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled
American Veterans and the Military Order of the Purple Heart, among
others.
   The work by student Scott Tyler, titled ``What Is the Proper Way
to Display A U.S. Flag?'' last week sparked demonstrations by angry
veterans and threats of violence, countered by student concerns
about freedom of expression.
   School officials canceled weekend classes and closed the gallery
where Tyler's work is displayed. After meetings with students,
faculty and veterans representatives, officials said the gallery
would reopen Thursday for in-house viewing only, and under
additional security.
   ``The school will continue to ensure that the First Amendment
rights and the safety of its students are protected,''
   ``To fulfill its responsibility to viewers, the school will post
a sign advising persons of the intent of the police and prosecutor's
offices should a viewer choose to step on the flag,'' officials said
in a written statement.
   Police have determined it is legal to display the work, but says
trampling or otherwise desecrating the flag is a felony, the school
has said previously.
   In the work, a flag is spread on the floor in front of a
photomontage of flag-draped coffins, South Koreans burning the U.S.
flag and other scenes. Visitors are invited to comment in a ledger
on a shelf in front of the exhibit.
   The veterans complain that in doing so, most will step on the
flag.
   ``It is NOT necessary for the viewer to walk on the flag to write
in the book,'' said the school's statement Wednesday. ``There is
sufficient room to stand on either side of the flag for those
viewers who choose to write comments in the book.''
   It's the second time in a year that an exhibit at the school has
stirred controversy. Black aldermen stormed its halls last year to
take down a portrait of the late Harold Washington, the city's first
black mayor, who was depicted by a student wearing frilly women's
underwear.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Army commander Gen. Michel Aoun is
whittling down the power of his main rival in a fight for control of
Lebanon's Christian enclave and has opened the door a crack for a
settlement with Moslems to end 14 years of civil war.
   Aoun heads the country's Christian government, which is vying for
legitimacy with a rival Moslem Cabinet.
   Last month, he scored a military victory over Samir Geagea,
leader of the right-wing Lebanese Forces militia, in the fiercest
street battles between Christian factions in four years.
   But Aoun has not completely crushed the messianic Geagea, a
Maronite Catholic like himself, and Christian political leaders
expect more bloodshed before the power struggle is finally resolved.
   ``You can't have two roosters in one yard,'' one former Christian
Cabinet minister warned. ``There may have to be more fighting.''
   Although Geagea's forces remain largely intact, Aoun has forced
him out of his strongholds in east Beirut, opening up the
possibility of reuniting the divided capital for the first time
since the civil war erupted in April 1975.
   The stumpy 53-year-old general has driven the Lebanese Forces,
the Christians' main militia, out of the so-called 5th Basin in
Beirut port.
   That robbed the militia of one of its main sources of revenue and
allowed the port to be reopened after a five-year closure, enhancing
hopes of reuniting the battle-scarred capital.
   The port straddles the city's Green Line, which divides Christian
east Beirut from Moslem west Beirut.
   By taking over control of the mid-city Museum Crossing, one of
the main Green Line gateways, and other customs posts on the borders
of the Christian sector controlled by the dominant Maronite sect,
Aoun has stripped Geagea of an estimated $400,000 a day in revenue.
   He also has ordered that no taxes be paid to the Lebanese Forces
in areas under army control, cutting Geagea's income by another 30
percent.
   Aoun's military success has made him the most likely next
candidate to succeed Amin Gemayel as president. Gemayel's term
expired Sept. 22 with no successor elected because the Lebanese
Forces opposed Syrian-backed candidates.
   The Lebanese Forces, however, remain largely intact because Aoun
reined in his troops after only two days of fighting in response to
appeals by Maronite religious leaders.
   Both sides are regrouping and fortifying their positions.
   ``He should have gone all the way,'' said a Moslem government
official who sympathizes with Aoun, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``Geagea's been left with a chance to hit back and he'll
be merciless if he does.''
   An Aoun aide said the cease-fire was ``a risk the general had to
take. He's perfectly aware of the consequences. He knows he'll
either be the next president or dead.''
   Electing Aoun would make possible an accomodation with Syria _
the main power broker in Lebanon _ and its Lebanese Moslem and
leftist allies and avert the threatened formalization of partition
into sectarian cantons.
   Aoun has taken a more moderate stand toward the Syrians since he
attended Arab League talks in Tunis aimed at defusing the political
crisis and has made it clear he is prepared to take Syrian security
interests into account if elected president.
   The Syrians have signalled they're ready to deal with him and
their state-run press has openly supported him.
   Removing the fiercely anti-Syrian, anti-Moslem Geagea has long
been a key demand of Syria and its Lebanese allies, who charge the
militia commander has close ties with Israel.
   Geagea says the 40,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab
League peacekeeping mandate are an occupation force. He demands
their unconditional withdrawal as a precondition for a
Christian-Moslem settlement based on a loose federal system.
   Aoun wants Geagea out of east Beirut and isolated north of the
city so the capital can be reunited and parliament convened to elect
him president on a reunification platform.
   For their part, the Syrians are understood to be willing to
withdraw their forces from west Beirut to the hills overlooking the
city and turn over security to Moslem units of the Lebanese army
under Maj. Gen. Sami Khatib.
   The Syrian scenario for a Lebanese settlement hinges largely on
eliminating the extremists on both sides of the sectarian divide to
give more moderate elements a chance to work out an agreement.
   Through their main surrogates, the Shiite Moslem Amal militia,
the Syrians have weakened the the Iranian-backed Shiite Hezbollah,
or Party of God, which seeks to create an Islamic republic in
Lebanon.
   However, like Geagea's fighters, Hezbollah has not been totally
crushed.
   No one in Lebanon believes that an end to Lebanon's agony, in
which some 150,000 people have been killed, is just around the
corner, given the deep-rooted divisions. But with Arab pressure
growing for a settlement, there may at last be a light, albeit
flickering and faint, at the end of the tunnel.

   Thirsty Icelanders are knocking back
real beer again after a 74-year drought, but the price of a brew is
staggering.
   Almost enough to drive someone to drink.
   Bars are charging $3.90 to $4.80 a glass, and on Wednesday the
folks were lining up to pay it.
   The state, which controls the liquor supply, is exacting fancy
levies on beer. A case containing 24 cans of imported beer costs
about $57.60.
   A referendum made alcoholic drinks illegal in Iceland in 1915.
Prohibition was repealed in 1933, but beer containing more than 2.25
percent alcohol still was banned.
   On Wednesday, that ban ended and it was legal to sell
full-strength beer, with an alcohol content of up to 5.6 percent.
   Residents of this island nation of 251,000 people formed lines
outside some of the 17 state liquor stores. Cheers and applause
broke out when Snorra Braut branch opened its doors in central
Reykjavik.
   Restaurants and bars reported their tables were booked up weeks

   You've heard of the bull in the china
shop. How about the cow in the bank?
   A half-dozen First National Bank of Louisville customers were
startled when a cow crashed through a window Tuesday after escaping
from a nearby downtown stockyard.
   ``I was writing the deposit ticket out and I looked up, and in
the window was a big black _ and I looked again _ a cow!'' said
Louis Cox. ``And then it came through the window and it ... sort of
brushed this one guy down on the floor.
   Cox said the animal was foaming at the mouth and his first
thought was that the animal was ``crazy or something.''
   ``She just got scared, that's all,'' said Bruce Pearce, general
manager of the stockyard.
   Except for the shattered window and a backstrain suffered by Cox,
the cow didn't cause any damage.

<HEAD>Dutch Partnership Wants To Acquire Infotech</HEAD>

   A Dutch investment partnership wants to acquire
Infotechnology Inc., the conglomerate that controls United Press
International.
   Avacus Partners LP told the Securities and Exchange Commission it
may seek control of New York-based Infotechnology through a tender
offer or merger.
   Infotechnology stock closed at $9.62{ Wednesday, up 25 cents from
Tuesday and $1.12{ since Monday. According to documents filed with
the SEC on Tuesday, Avacus holds 587,500 share of Infotechnology,
8.03 percent of the company, including 231,500 shares it purchased
between Feb. 16 and Feb. 23 for between $6.90 and $7.25 per share.
   Infotechnology has wide-ranging holdings of technology and
information companies, including two cable television channels,
Financial News Network and The Learning Channel.
   Infotechnology has managed UPI since February 1988, when it took
over the company from Mexican publisher Mario Vasquez Rana, who
relinquished control of his stock for 10 years. Its chairman, Earl
W. Brian, and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. are the major shareholders.
   Avacus was formed in March 1988 for the sole purpose of acquiring
Infotechnology, according to the documents filed with the SEC. Reiss
&amp; Co., a Dutch investment company, is the majority partner. Johannes
M.K. Nyks, former president and chief executive of the American
subsidiary of the Netherlands newspaper, VNU, also has an interest.
   Nyks, in a letter to Brian dated Feb. 27, said Avacus considers
Infotechnology's stock undervalued and sought a meeting to discuss
``opportunities to increase shareholder value through a mutually
agreeable transaction.''
   Dwight Geduldig, a spokesman for UPI, said Wednesday that Brian
has responded publicly, ``I look forward to meeting with any
shareholder who has suggestions about ways to increase shareholders'
values.''

<HEAD>Brady Blames News of S&amp;L Troubles for S&amp;L Withdrawals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady is blaming
newspaper headlines and television reports for causing billions of
dollars in withdrawals at savings and loan associations so far this
year.
   Federal savings and loan regulators on Wednesday revealed that
depositors withdrew at least $1 billion last month after publication
of a list of institutions targeted for government takeover.
   Brady, appearing before the Senate Budget Committee, said, ``It's
our conviction that the outflow is due to the stories on the nightly
news and the black headlines on the front of the business pages or
page 1 almost every day for the past two months.''
   He said S&amp;Ls have been forced to increase interest rates on
savings by an average of three-fourths of a percentage point to hold
deposits following the increase in public attention to the
industry's problems. He predicted that the rates would drop once
President Bush's plan to bail out the industry is approved and
public confidence is restored.
   ``We feel growth (in deposits) will be strong in the future,'' he
said.
   M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, said
the nation's 2,950 S&amp;Ls suffered net withdrawals of $4 billion to $5
billion in February, $1 billion to $2 billion of it at the 220
institutions earmarked for takeover by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp.
   Wall, in a separate appearance before the Senate Banking
Committee, said the bulk of the withdrawals were a normal response
to rising interest rates. Other investments offering a better
return, such as money market mutual funds, lure bank and S&amp;L
customers away, he said.
   Also, shaky and rescued S&amp;Ls, under orders from regulators to
scale back their operations, represented another substantial
portion, he said.
   Roger Martin, another member of the bank board, told reporters
that withdrawals throughout the thrift industry totaled $7 billion
in January.
   That represents a continuation of the so-called ``silent run''
that began gathering steam with a $7 billion outflow in November and
a record withdrawal of $8.1 billion in December.
   The withdrawals add up to $26 billion to $27 billion over the
four months. All S&amp;L deposits at the end of 1988 totaled $970
billion.
   In January, public attention to the industry's problem soared
after the administration revealed it was considering a controversial
proposal, since dropped, to charge depositors a fee. The industry's
problems received another dose of publicity in early February, when
the president proposed his rescue plan.
   The FDIC, which regulates commercial banks, has been assuming
control of the worst-off savings institutions as a preliminary step
before enactment of Bush's plan.
   So far, the agency has taken over only 36 of the targeted
institutions in a legal arrangement called a conservatorship. The
agency plans to have about half of the 220 under control by the end
of next week and the rest by the end of the month.
   The affected institutions, while still privately owned, are
controlled by the government. They remain open and all accounts
continue to be protected up to the $100,000 insurance limit.
   Martin said the high withdrawal rate at the 220 insolvent
institutions has since stabilized.
   ``We had a temporary aberration but that has subsided
tremendously,'' he said. ``I just think it was something that hit
the press. The word conservatorship, I think (people) thought about
it in terms of bankruptcy. But that's all stopped.''
   Last week, the bank board and the Federal Reserve Board announced
a joint lending agreement with the Treasury to pump cash, if
necessary, into any S&amp;L that needed it. Wall said, however, that he
expected little use of the agreement.
   ``You put a mechanism like that into place and the basic purpose
is you don't have to use it,'' Wall said. ``It's there. Everybody
knows it's there. They have the confidence that that's the case so
as to make no call on it.''

   Congressional budget writers say they are
edging closer to negotiations with the Bush administration, even as
the House Appropriations Committee warns it is unhappy with the
president's 1990 spending plan.
   The Democratic chairmen of the two congressional budget
committees, and the top-ranking Republicans, emerged from a session
with administration budget director Richard Darman to say their
series of informational meetings together seems to be nearing an end.
   House Budget Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., and Rep. Bill
Frenzel of Minnesota, the panel's ranking Republican, said talks
might be held next week between Darman and the four top members of
the budget panels about how negotiations among administration
officials and congressional leaders might proceed.
   ``We might sit down, without staff, and talk about where to go,''
Frenzel said.
   Panetta said the sessions would examine ``whether there are
approaches Congress and the White House could agree to'' on deficit
reduction.
   Panetta said that meanwhile, in a ``two-track approach,'' his
committee probably will begin writing a budget resolution in
mid-March with a goal of finishing its work by April 1.
   Darman and congressional budget writers have already met several
times recently. During these sessions, congressional leaders have
tried to learn more details about Bush's budget plan, which they say
is vague.
   The administration has been seeking high-level talks on its $1.16
trillion fiscal 1990 spending plan. Many Democrats have been leery,
however, arguing that it would be a better strategy for Democrats to
write their own plan or wait until Bush spells out where he would
make spending cuts necessary to meet his overall budget goals.
   Meanwhile, Democrats and Republican on the appropriations panel,
in a report to the House Budget Committee, said Bush's $1.16
trillion fiscal blueprint ``does not deal adequately with essential
national needs'' and said they will make changes in his spending mix.
   ``The committee will adjust priorities as it deems necessary to
provide for essential national needs,'' panel members wrote in a
required annual report.
   Republicans on the committee submitted a statement saying they
favored reducing the deficit by raising new revenues and by saving
money in so-called mandatory programs. These programs are usually
benefits for which people automatically qualify, such as Medicare
assistance for the elderly and handicapped.
   ``Clearly the first step is to see if we can find enough
mandatory program savings and new resources to pay for any new
initiatives,'' said the GOP statement, submitted by the panel's
ranking Republican, Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass., and supported by at
least 21 of the 22 GOP members.
   ``The best way to seek agreement on this fundamental issue is to
convene a leadership group to negotiate,'' the Republicans said.
   Asked if he was suggesting new revenues and mandatory spending
cuts beyond those recommended by Bush in his budget, Conte said,
``That has to be considered.''
   The views of the appropriations committee's members, though
important, are not surprising because the panel oversees all
spending programs except for the mandatory ones.
   The Gramm-Rudman law requires a deficit next year of no more than
$100 billion. Every dollar collected in taxes or saved by reducing
mandatory programs is another dollar the appropriations committee
can spend on the programs it controls.
   The committee expressed doubt over whether Congress will grant
the $303 billion in military spending or the $14.7 billion for
foreign affairs that Bush seeks.
   The committee also said it believes Bush has sought insufficient
spending for housing, environmental protection and medical care for
veterans.

<HEAD>Glass-nost: Soviets Hustle New Export Vodka Like True Capitalists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Under Lenin's dour gaze from a giant portrait,
Soviet officials uncorked their new export supervodka and hustled
American guests like born-again capitalists, with grins, backslaps
and heaping bowls of caviar.
   Glasnost was in full flower Wednesday night at the Soviet
Embassy, and warm feelings of ``openness'' were stoked by frequent
gulps of Stolichnaya Cristall, the ultra-premium Russian vodka that
will appear on liquor store shelves in 10 American cities this week.
   ``You might ask, what is the difference between Stolichnaya and
Stolichnaya Cristall,'' Soviet ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin smilingly
told the happy throng. ``I suspect the effect is just the same, but
Stolichnaya Cristall is better for your health.''
   If Dubinin and his marketing comrades get their way, Stolichnaya
Cristall will be good for the health of the Soviet economy, which
suffers from a shortage of hard Western currencies.
   The Commerce Department says United States imported a record $1.7
billion in Soviet goods last year, compared with U.S. exports of
nearly $2.8 billion to the Soviet Union. The U.S. export figure,
representing largely grain, was up 87 percent from the previous year
but below the record $3.6 billion in 1979 before the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan prompted a U.S. embargo.
   Stolichnaya Cristall, like the older Stolichnaya brand, is bought
by PepsiCo Inc. for resale in the United States under a 1972
agreement that allows the Soviets to produce Pepsi Cola at 21
bottling plants. Under a newly negotiated deal, 26 additional Pepsi
Cola plants will be opened within the next few years.
   ``It's an old-fashioned barter deal,'' said PepsiCo chairman
Donald M. Kendall, who received the first bottle of Stolichnaya
Cristall from Dubinin at the embassy reception.
   Stolichnaya Cristall is named for the Cristall distillery in
Moscow, one of the two plants that produces the prestige export
vodka. The latest version, developed in 1982, is made from the
finest winter wheat and the purest spring waters from the Moscow
region, said Suren S. Santurian, senior engineer of Amtorg Trading
Corp., the Soviet government's export marketing agency.
   Drawn from the finest 5 percent of the alcohol that trickles
through three sets of activated charcoal filters, Stolichnaya
Cristall is ``like taking the cream off the top of the milk,''
Kendall said.
   Retail U.S. prices will be ultra-premium as well. A bottle of
Stolichnaya Cristall will sell for $18 to $20 retail. That will be
about $5 more than regular Stolichnaya, which is billed as ``the
only authentic Russian vodka available in the United States.''
   The new vodka, served in brimming shot glasses from silver trays
by waiters in black ties, was a hit among the several hundred
American representatives of the wine and spirits trade, members of
Congress and journalists who attended the reception.
   The guests also feasted on iced bowls of Petrossian caviar,
Norwegian smoked salmon, grilled beef filets and chicken breasts,
lime bavarian cream charlotte and black Russian tea.
   One reporter observed after downing a shot glass of Cristall:
``It's real smooth, compared to the cheap rotgut I buy. It's like a
sipping whiskey. There's no burn. It just goes straight down.''
   Stolichnaya is extremely difficult to obtain in the Soviet Union,
where it is reserved for export, foreigners and the Soviet elite _
who have access to special consumer goods stores in Moscow.
   PepsiCo officials said only a few thousand cases will be
available in the United States this year for stores in Atlanta,
Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San
Francisco and Washington.

<TEXT>
   The State Department's annual report on
international drug trafficking is likely to spark controversy in
Congress over its praise for Mexico, which ranks as the single
largest source for heroin entering the United States.
   In a letter accompanying the report, Secretary of State James A.
Baker III acknowledged on Wednesday that the worldwide battle
against narcotics ``is clearly not being won'' and might even be
``slipping backwards.''
   The report serves as President Bush's annual update for Congress
on global drug trafficking.
   In contrast to last year's report, which said corruption in the
Mexican government was ``endemic,'' this year's lauded U.S.-Mexican
cooperation and points to increased drug seizures and arrests. It
also takes note of a new agreement on fighting drug trafficking.
   Last year, the Senate voted 63-27 to punish Mexico for its lack
of cooperation in the battle against drugs, but the attempt was
killed in the House. This year, Congress has 45 days to decide
whether it agrees with the president's findings.
   The report lists 17 countries or territories as major narcotics
producers or transit points, yet finds that their governments may
receive U.S. assistance to continue the effort against illicit drugs.
   Bush recommended that Burma and Laos be added to the list of
nations ineligible for U.S. aid because of their support for drug
trafficking, but the two nations don't receive any U.S. aid anyway.
   Nor do the other nations on the list _ Afghanistan, Iran, Syria
and Panama _ but the action does permit the government to impose
tariffs or tighten custom rules against certain imports.
   Some of the report's most striking language came in the dim view
taken by Baker on the international drug fight.
   ``Both here and abroad, the international war on narcotics is
clearly not being won. In fact, in some areas, we appear to be
slipping backwards,'' Baker said.
   Ann Wrobleski, assistant secretary of state for international
narcotics matters, said Baker's assessment was based on worldwide
increases in marijuana, opium and coca production, as well as a
worldwide increase in drug abuse.
   ``These twin increases fuel ... an increase in power of drug
trafficking cartels _ and that worries us,'' said Ms. Wrobleski.
   Baker noted that of the 17 countries found to be cooperating with
the United States, six of them ``can and must do more in the future
to end the drug trade.''
   They included:
   _The Bahamas, which was praised for a combined law enforcement
operation with the United States, but was cited for possible
government corruption and urged to make ``stronger unilateral
efforts to curb drug trafficking and consumption.''
   _Bolivia, which was lauded for a ``good effort'' with its coca
eradication program, but the report said more must be done.
   _Colombia, which was praised for ``strong action'' against
cocaine refining and resistance to violent drug traffickers, but the
report noted that the country's ``judiciary remains intimidated'' by
drug traffickers.
   _Mexico, which was cited for President Carlos Salinas' ``strong
public stance'' against drugs, as well as the efforts of his new
deputy attorney general's office. But corruption was seen as a
continuing problem, and the nation remains the United States' top
source for heroin and its No. 2 source for marijuana.
   _Paraguay, which was praised for a ``stronger commitment'' in
1988, but was still termed a ``significant drug transit point and
money laundering center.'' Former Gen. Alfredo Stroessner was ousted
by a military coup in February. Although reports have surfaced that
the new president, Andres Rodriguez, has links to the
drug-trafficking industry, the report says the department does ``not
yet know'' what type of actions will be taken by his government.
   _Peru, which was lauded for ``some real progress in anti-drug
programs'' but was urged to adopt an even stronger crop control
effort in the coming year.
   One country, Lebanon, was certified for U.S. aid under a special
waiver because the major drug-producing area of the country is
occupied by the Syrian military.
   The other nations that were certified included Belize, Brazil,
Ecuador, Hong Kong, India, Jamaica, Malaysia, Morocco, Nigeria,
Pakistan and Thailand.

<TEXT>
   Budget cuts have forced the National
Weather Service to eliminate a forecasting unit widely used by the
news media to supply public information, the director said.
   The public service unit of the National Severe Storms Forecast
Center will be eliminated by Sept. 30 as part of system-wide cuts
necessitated by a budget crunch, Fred Ostby, the center's director,
said Wednesday.
   One of the main duties of the five-member unit is writing four
daily summaries of the nation's weather conditions. It also answers
queries from reporters about weather developments, and provides the
nation's highest and lowest temperatures of the day and information
on any record temperatures for the date.
   ``It looks like we're going to have to bite the bullet here
ourselves,'' Ostby said. ``Fortunately, the center for a long time
has been relatively immune from this. The part of our service that
deals with lives and property will stay intact.''
   The Severe Storms Forecast Center has been based in Kansas City
since 1954. It has a staff of about 70 people whose prime mission is
to forecast severe weather developments and issue watches and
warnings.
   Ostby said that as now envisioned, the center would retain two of
the five jobs now assigned to the public service unit, but the
duties of the remaining positions would be expanded.
   The number of daily national weather summaries will be trimmed
from four to two, but no one will be available to take queries from
news reporters, provide the nation's highest and lowest readings or
any record temperatures, he said.

<TEXT>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan soon will have to come up with answers on some of the most
difficult issues facing his department, including fetal tissue
research and planned Medicare spending cuts.
   Sullivan goes into the job of secretary of a department that
spends a third of the federal budget with the confidence of the
Senate, which approved his nomination 98-1 on Wednesday.
   ``I think he's well equipped to meet these challenges,'' Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said during debate on the nomination.
   Sullivan, who stepped down as president of the Morehouse School
of Medicine in Atlanta to take the HHS job, has avoided taking
positions on some of the hot issues he faces, and one of those cost
him a vote in the Senate.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., cast the lone vote against the
55-year-old Atlanta doctor ``as a matter of conscience'' because
Sullivan had declined to support the anti-abortion position against
use of federal funds to back medical research using aborted fetuses.
   At his confirmation hearing last week before the Senate Finance
Committee, Sullivan said he would not do ``anything to encourage
abortion in order to get fetal tissue'' for research. However, he
said he wanted to review an advisory committee's recommendations
before stating a final position on what conditions, if any, such
research could be allowed.
   The advisory committee concluded that research on tissue from
intentionally aborted fetuses, now under a moratorium at the
National Institutes of Health, be resumed under guidelines that
assure women would not be encouraged to have abortions to produce
the tissue.
   Abortion-related questions have been the most controversial for
Sullivan. Indeed, the doctor's introduction to the Washington
political scene was rocky because of his comments in a newspaper
interview favoring individual choice on abortion. He later told Sen.
Bob Packwood, R-Ore., he favored retaining the Supreme Court
decision that legalized abortion.
   But at two committee hearings before his confirmation, Sullivan
declared that he, like the president, opposes abortion except in
cases of rape, incest and danger to the mother's life, and wants the
court decision reversed.
   Packwood, a pro-choice advocate, appeared to hold no grudge
against Sullivan either for his abortion views or his flip-flop on
the court issue, and the senator said abortion has received too much
attention already.
   ``Dr. Sullivan fully realizes that the major things his
department has to do relate to Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security
and the tremendous budget restraints,'' he said.
   Sullivan was asked in the confirmation process about President
Bush's proposal to trim Medicare spending by $5 billion in fiscal
1990, but he has deferred on the specifics of that question, saying
he was not involved in the administration's detailed budget
discussions.
   Generally, Sullivan has said the department must evaluate
utilization of medical procedures funded by the federal health
insurance program for the elderly and disabled _ which has grown at
more than twice the rate of general inflation for several years.
   As part of an overall strategy for cutting the increase in
soaring medical costs in the federal budget, Sullivan has said that
focusing more on preventive medicine ``is ultimately more humane and
economical than merely treating illnesses.''
   But one senator cautioned him against optimism on this front,
saying the burgeoning federal deficit has stalled previous efforts
to promote prevention.
   ``You've got to spend money to save money, and you can't do that
in this system,'' Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., said during
Sullivan's appearance before the Finance Committee last week.

   FBI agents who arrested accused hijacker Fawaz
Younis say they advised him of his rights but did not provide him
with a lawyer or allow him to make a telephone call.
   Two of the FBI agents involved in ``Operation Goldenrod,'' in
which Younis was captured on Sept. 13, 1987, said they read him his
rights twice in Arabic, and that he waived his right to an attorney.
   Francis D. Carter, Younis' court-appointed attorney, on Wednesday
sought to show that Younis did not have an adequate understanding of
the U.S. legal system to grasp what was happening, and that some
legal lines were blurred in an arrest that was carried out in the
Mediterranean Sea with help from the Navy.
   Four eyewitnesses have identified Younis as the leader of five
heavily armed men who stormed aboard Royal Jordanian Airlines flight
402 at Beirut Airport on June 11, 1985. No one was killed in the
incident, which ended 30 hours later with the release of the
passengers and crew.
   Younis, 30, has pleaded innocent. He is on trial under a 1984
statute which asserts ``long-arm'' jurisdiction for the United
States in cases involving American hostages taken abroad.
   In testimony Wednesday, FBI agents said Younis told them after
his arrest that he hijacked the plane on orders from a senior
official of Lebanon's Amal militia, two of the agents testified
Wednesday.
   Younis told the FBI that the military commander of Amal, Aql
Hamiyya, gave him the orders and that they were approved by Nabih
Berri, the head of Amal.
   Berri is Lebanon's minister of justice. Amal is a Shiite Moslem
party.
   FBI agents Thomas Hansen and Dmitri Droujinksi told the jury at
U.S. District Court that Younis recounted the hijacking in detail
during four days aboard the Navy ship USS Butte after his arrest.
   Younis was later transferred to the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga
and flown non-stop to Andrews Air Force Base near Washington,
arriving four days after his arrest, the agents said.
   Carter sought to show that the government took inordinately long
in transporting the suspect and interrogated him while he was
suffering from two broken wrists inflicted during his arrest.
   Carter asked Droujinski whether there was an attorney aboard the
Butte.
   ``I don't think so,'' said the agent.
   ``Did you give him a chance to use the radio to contact anybody
at home, the proverbial telephone call? Did you offer him that?''
Carter asked.
   ``No, sir,'' replied the agent.
   Droujinski, an Arabic speaker who acted as interpreter during the
interrogation, testified that Younis gave his confession orally and
signed a written Arabic language version of it, making two changes.
   Younis corrected the spelling of one word and rephrased one
sentence to say that Berri ``approved'' rather than ``ordered'' the
hijacking.
   Droujinski read the altered sentence aloud, translating it into
English:
   ``On the day before the hijacking of the plane, a highly placed
representative of Amal got in touch with me and informed me that the
head of Amal approved the hijacking of a plane from the airport of
Beirut.''
   Carter has said that he will attempt to prove that his client was
acting under the equivalent of military orders when he led the
hijacking.
   Two other FBI agents described how they arrested Younis aboard an
80-foot sailboat in international waters 13 miles off Cyprus.
   Six members of the FBI hostage rescue team, including two women
in two-piece bathing suits, were visible on board the boat as Younis
approached in a launch, testified David W. Johnson, head of the
group.
   Another agent, George Gast, testified that he and another male
agent led Younis to the back of the yacht, slammed him to the deck,
told him he was under arrest and handcuffed him.
   Johnson said he had planned the ``take-down'' as a precaution.
   ``I was concerned for the safety of my team,'' testified Johnson.
``I didn't know whether he might be a karate expert or a judo
expert. I didn't know whether at the time of the arrest we would
have a double-cross.
   ``I had a bad experience with an arrest on a boat several weeks
before, in which the subject jumped overboard. It caused a great
deal of trouble,'' he said. ``It could get tricky, and somebody
could drown.''

<HEAD>Coach: Sprinter On Steroids Was `Worth A Meter'</HEAD>

   Ben Johnson's coach says the sprinter, who was
stripped of Olympic gold last year for steroid use, had used the
performance-enhancing drugs since 1981 because it is virtually the
only way to stay competitive.
   Coach Charlie Francis told an inquiry Wednesday that he had
turned the Canadian sprinter on to steroids because Johnson's
competitors were taking them and it was thus necessary.
   He said sterioids had been ``worth a meter'' to Johnson, who won
the gold medal and set a world record in the 100 meters at the Seoul
Olympics only to be stripped of both the record and medal after
testing positive for steriod use.
   The 27-year-old Johnson has maintained that he never knowingly
used drugs.
   Francis, Johnson's coach since 1977, told the Canadian inquiry
board that he first approached Johnson about anabolic steroids and
other performance-enhancing drugs in the summer of 1981.
   He said Johnson ``was not sure of the advantages'' but had during
the fall ``decided he would go on.
   ``If he wanted to compete, it's pretty clear that steroids are
worth a meter at the highest level of sports,'' Francis said. ``I
think he understood that his competitors were on them.''
   Francis' only previous statement since the Olympics was that the
sprinter's urine test may have been sabotaged.
   In four hours of testimony, Francis said Johnson was among
several Canadian athletes who had received steroids from George
Astaphan, the St. Kitts doctor accused of administering the steroid
found in Johnson's urine sample taken after Johnson set the world
record in Seoul.
   Astaphan has denied the charge.
   Francis said top-level international competition is virtually
impossible without steroids _ which have harmful side-effects.
   He cautioned against believing any claims from top-level athletes
that they are clean and that their records are the result only of
hard work.
   ``It just isn't true, not at the highest level,'' Francis said.
He said repeatedly that steroids ``are not a short cut'' but the
reason top-level athletes are able to train as hard as they do.

<HEAD>Ag Secretary Says Carcinogenic Fungus Aflatoxin Being Kept out of
Food Supply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumers shouldn't be afraid that aflatoxin is
going to show up in their food, even though the recent drought
created conditions under which the carcinogen thrives, says
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter.
   ``Any time we have a drought, we are going to see more aflatoxin
problems,'' Yeutter said Wednesday before the House Appropriations
subcommittee on rural development, agriculture and related agencies.
``That doesn't mean we're going to have more in the food supply ...
or any that slips in is going to hurt anyone.''
   In answer to a question from Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., Yeutter
said a recent article in The Wall Street Journal reporting that
aflatoxin-tainted corn is moving through the nation's food chain
focuses on the ``worst case scenarios.''
   ``It articulates a viewpoint that has scare dimensions to it,''
he said.
   ``Everyone is going to do their best to minimize the risk of
letting aflatoxin into the food supply,'' he said. ``Nobody in the
food chain wants it.''
   He said the government cannot guarantee a risk-free world, but
``there aren't people trying to slip aflatoxin-laden products into
the food supply.''
   The heat and drought that year were ideal for the fungus that
produces aflatoxin, which researchers have linked to the development
of liver cancer in laboratory rats.
   On Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration said about 6 percent
_ 95 samples out of 1,650 _ of the field corn tested in recent
months had higher levels.
   That corn cannot be used for human consumption, but can be
diverted to feed non-dairy cattle, the FDA said.
   FDA tested about 263 samples of corn flour and corn meal and
found 2 percent, or six samples, to have more than 20 parts of
aflatoxin per billion. FDA policy requires that these products be
removed from the market.
   Yeutter also discussed international trade reform with the
committee, saying the climate for change is better than it has been
in a decade.
   He said that there are some hurdles the United States and
European Community must work out before talks in the Uruguay Round
resume next month in Geneva.
   ``I'm cautiously optimistic we'll get that worked out between now
and April,'' he told the committee.
   The United States has been seeking removal of government
subsidies on exports worldwide, but its position has been unpopular
with other nations.
   ``What happens in the Uruguay Round will determine what we should
have in farm legislation,'' Yeutter said.
   He said he doesn't anticipate any significant changes from the
1985 farm bill that is due to expire in 1990. He said Congress could
extend the 1985 law until the Uruguay talks are complete, or pass a
new bill and amend it as necessary after the negotiations.

   John Tower is challenging the Senate to live up
to the same standards by which it is judging him, saying senators
sometimes vote after drinking alcohol and that he doubts he is alone
in having broken his marriage vows.
   Nobody's perfect, the secretary of defense-designate seemed to be
saying in his speech Wednesday to the National Press Club.
   Even before Tower spoke, the leader of the Senate's Democratic
majority, George Mitchell of Maine, said in a speech that ``it is
not moral perfection or the qualifications of senators that are at
issue here.''
   The things that are at issue are far different than they used to
be, however.
   Tower devoted his press club speech to defense policy questions,
saying these are the subjects that ``normally occupy the mind of the
nominee of secretary of defense.''
   They are not the subjects that have dominated his confirmation
proceedings.
   Nor, for that matter, did these or similar dry subjects force
Gary Hart from the race for the Democratic presidential nomination
or sidetrack President Reagan's nomination of Douglas Ginsburg to be
a Supreme Court justice.
   Hart, who served on the Senate Armed Services Committee when
Tower was its chairman, withdrew from the White House contest in May
1987 after a newspaper story that he had spent a night with a
part-time actress while his wife was out of town.
   ``We're all going to have to seriously question the system for
selecting our national leaders that reduces the press of this nation
to hunters and presidential candidates to being hunted,'' Hart said
at the time.
   Ginsburg withdrew from contention for the Supreme Court seat in
November, 1987, saying his views on the law had ``been drowned out
in the clamor'' over his admission that he smoked marijuana as a
student in the 1960s and a Harvard Law School professor in the 1970s.
   In Tower's case, opponents have zeroed in on his drinking and
relations with women, as well as his activities as a consultant to
defense contractors. The nominee says he has cut out all drinking
except for wine with meals, and will eliminate that too if he is
confirmed.
   Tom Korologos, a lobbyist and former Nixon White House official
who has guided a number of Republican nominations through the
Senate, said he could remember no confirmation battle so dominated
by personal issues.
   ``This one has no constituency out there, nobody rising up and
down over a policy, over an environmental or a strategic issue,''
Korologos said. ``This is all personal, and it's unfortunate that
the Senate has come to this.''
   Mitchell, announcing his opposition to Tower, saw it differently.
   ``Public officials have a right to a private life,'' he said.
``They do not have a right to engage publicly in behavior which
could interfere with the discharge of their public duties.''
   ``A single lapse in judgment _ or perhaps even a few _ should not
disqualify an individual from public service,'' Mitchell continued.
   ``But when the lapses in judgment form a pattern of many
incidents spanning many years, and when there is insufficient
evidence to demonstrate that the pattern has been broken, then there
are reasonable grounds to question whether the individual possesses
the qualities necessary for the uniquely demanding job of the
secretary of defense.''
   Tower said he agreed that the nominee for the top Pentagon job
should be held to a high standard, but also asked whether it is
acceptable for members of the Senate ``who had a few drinks in
hideaways ... to come onto the floor late in the evening and vote on
vital issues of nuclear deterrence.''
   Then, when he was asked whether he had ever broken wedding vows,
the twice-divorced and now single ex-senator said, , ``As a matter
of fact, I have broken wedding vows. I think I am probably not alone
in that connection.''
   It was an extraordinary confession for an American political
figure. Hart, although he admitted poor judgment, said he did not do
anything immoral during his night with actress-model Donna Rice and
refused to answer questions about whether he had ever committed
adultery.

<HEAD>State GOP Officials Report Little Push for Tower</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Conservative activists are trying to generate
grassroots support for John Tower, but Republican Party officials
around the nation concede they haven't seen much of a groundswell of
support for President Bush's Pentagon nominee.
   ``Senator Tower is being victimized by a partisan power play on
the part of some Democrats in the United States Senate,'' said a
newspaper ad run Wednesday by Conservative Future PAC.
   ``An exercise in rumor-mongering and the most vile form of
partisan politics,'' was how L. Brent Bozell III, director of the
Conservative Victory Committee, described the opposition to the
former Texas senator.
   The conservative groups that are making the Tower confirmation a
partisan confrontation may be suffering from the early damage done
by one of their own. Paul Weyrich of the Free Congress Foundation
testified against Tower last month before the Senate Armed Services
Committee, raising allegations of drinking and womanizing.
   On the party level, Mark Goodin, communications director for the
Republican National Committee, said efforts were under way to
generate support for Tower. But local GOP officials said they hadn't
been contacted.
   ``No one has called me from the RNC to talk about the Tower
situation at all,'' said Dwight Adams, chairman of the South Dakota
Republican Party. Sen. Larry Pressler of South Dakota was among the
wavering Republicans.
   Another undecided Republican senator was Charles Grassley of
Iowa. His state party chairman, Rich Schwarm, said, ``I don't think
anyone would want to pressure Sen. Grassley by generating a
groundswell.''
   ``I haven't been asked to do anything,'' said Jean Sullivan, a
Republican National Committeewoman from Alabama. The state has two
Democratic senators. Richard Shelby has announced his opposition to
Tower and Howell Heflin is among the undecided.
   Mrs. Sullivan said she thought Republicans could generate some
pressure on Heflin, but ``I don't like pressure tactics. ... We
could beat him up pretty good.''
   But, she went on, national party officials ``better tell us what
they want us to start doing.''
   In North Carolina, Robert Jones, spokesman for the state
Republican Party, said he knew of no effort to generate a
groundswell for Tower.
   ``We personally haven't done anything,'' he said.
   That was in sharp contrast to the effort made last year on behalf
of the nomination of Robert H. Bork to the Supreme Court.
   ``We did quite a bit of work on that,'' said Jones. ``There was a
strong matter of principle involved.''
   Asked if the Tower nomination was a political issue in his state,
Fred Logan, the Kansas GOP chairman, repl;ied, ``I don't think so.''
   Senate GOP leader Bob Dole of Kansas has been leading the fight
for confirmation, but his Kansas colleague, Nancy Kassebaum is among
the undecided.
   Mary Alice Lair, a national committeewoman from Kansas, said,
``Certainly, our Sen. Dole is doing his part.''
   Asked if there was any effort to convince Kassebaum to support
Tower, Mrs. Lair said: ``We are trying. But, you know, she has a
mind of her own, which I respect.''
   ``I have not been asked by anyone to have any contact with her,''
said Fred Logan, the Kansas Republican Party chairman. ``Nancy
Kassebaum is going to make up her own mind and I trust her
judgment.''

   The California resort community of Palm Springs
sizzled into first place as the nation's warmest community in 1988
while the small town of Gunnison, Colo., held on as the coldest spot
for the fourth year in a row.
   Rankings based on the number of times a community was the hottest
or coldest in the 48 contiguous states gave Gunnison, nestled in the
Rockies, a wide lead over all competitors, with 93 daily lows during
1988.
   Palm Springs, Calif., won a narrower victory with 43 daily highs,
according to the report in ``Weatherwise'' magazine.
   Geography professor David H. Hickcox of Ohio Wesleyan University
in Delaware, Ohio, compiles the annual rankings. His study covers
inhabited cities and towns with National Weather Service stations.
Excluded are such extreme locations as Alaska, Death Valley, Calif.,
and Mount Washington, N.H.
   Hickcox reported the nation's mean temperature last year at 53
degrees Fahrenheit, calculated by averaging the highs and lows from
the reporting stations. That average was the same as the year before
and 1 degree colder than in 1986.
   Palm Springs topped the 1988 hotpoint list by moving up from
fourth place a year before, Hickcox reported.
   Second in both years was Bullhead City, Ariz. It was a close
competitor in 1988, recording the nation's warmest reading 41 times.
   McAllen, Texas _ which had been No. 1 in 1987 _ fell to third
place with 31 days as hottest in 1988.
   Placing fourth in 1988 was Laredo, Texas, which was the national
hotspot 29 times. Fort Myers, Fla., rounded out the top five with 27
appearances as the warmest community in America.
   Just five states accounted for 97 percent of the nation's daily
high temperatures last year _ California, Texas, Arizona, Florida
and Nevada.
   Gunnison's 93 days with the coldest readings cemented its
perennial top reading among the cold and put it far ahead of the
nearest rival, Truckee, Calif., with 28 lowest readings.
   Leadville, Colo., which had been No. 2 in 1987, fell to third
with 22 appearances as coldest place in the country. Rounding out
the coldest five were Jackson, Wyo., with 20 coldest days, and West
Yellowstone, Mont., at 17.
   The daily lows were slightly less concentrated than the highs,
with five states accounting for 72 percent. Those states, Hickcox
reported, are Colorado, Wyoming, Minnesota, Montana and California.
   Only one community, Glasgow, Mont., appeared on both the lists of
daily highs and lows. Glasgow was the nation's hotspot at 108
degrees June 5 and the coldest place twice, at -7 degrees Nov. 17
and -6 on Dec. 24.
   Hickcox noted in his report that the difference between the
nation's hottest and coldest place was greatest on Feb. 2 of last
year at 132 degrees. On that date Ely, Minn., was coldest at -45 for
the lowest reading of 1988, while the hotspot was Fort Myers with a
reading of 87.

<HEAD>Higher Prices Could Prompt Release of Wheat under Storage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dry soil and poor stands of winter wheat in
parts of the nation's breadbasket are pushing up prices and adding
to the jitters of farmers and grain traders who nervously watch the
Agriculture Department's daily price averages.
   If prices are pushed much higher, millions of bushels of wheat
that farmers have locked up in storage bins could be released for
sale on the market.
   The watchfulness involves the ``farmer-owned reserve'' of grain,
popularly called FOR, in which growers store their product and
collect 26.5 cents per bushel annually from the government as a
storage fee. The grain is technically stored under price support
loan arrangements.
   As part of the agreement, the wheat must remain in storage and
off the market until market prices rise enough to trigger release of
the grain.
   At that point, the FOR grain can be redeemed without penalty and
used or sold as farmers see fit. Or growers can leave it in the FOR
and continue collecting storage payments, subject to monthly review.
   The trigger level for release of FOR wheat is $4.23 per bushel.
As of Feb. 29, the average price was $4.12 per bushel, only 11 cents
below the trigger level. The price is a 5-day average.
   Carl Schwensen, executive vice president of the National
Association of Wheat Growers, said here Wednesday that the price
increases are welcomed by farmers but he had not heard any great
concern about the FOR being triggered imminently.
   One immediate factor, he said, is the USDA's monthly adjustment
of the formula used to determine the 5-day wheat price average. This
adjustment, which will reflect March 1 computations, is expected to
take as much as five cents off the $4.12 that was reported for Feb.
28.
   Even so, tight wheat supplies and uncertainties about the 1989
U.S. harvest are big factors in the price situation and will be for
many weeks.
   The department's Economic Research Service says in a new analysis
that the FOR wheat inventory as of Feb. 8 stood at 379 million
bushels.
   About 97 million bushels of that wheat is stored under loan
arrangements expected to mature through May. Farmers have the option
of paying off the loans or forfeiting the wheat to the department's
Commodity Credit Corp.
   Loan repayments can be made in cash or with certificates issued
by the department in partial payment under commodity programs. The
certificates are redeemable in CCC commodities.
   Another factor that could reduce inventories would be if wheat
market prices rose to the release level of $4.23 per bushel, the
report said. The 5-day average rose to $4.15 on Feb. 1, slipped to
$4.08 by Feb. 21 but then regained strength.
   ``If the FOR were triggered, farmers could either redeem their
loans without penalty or leave their grain in the reserve,'' the
report said. ``Storage payments would continue but we reviewed on
the first day of the second month following the initial trigger.''
   If the 5-day average farm price held at or above the $4.23 level,
storage payments would end and the loans would begin to bear
interest which the farmer would have to pay the government.
   The report said that if storage payments end, some farmers
``would have little incentive to leave their grain in the reserve,
particularly if they were accruing interest charges.''

   An Agriculture Department analysis says last
year's settlement of a trade dispute with South Korea cleared the
way for rapid growth in U.S. sales of cigarettes and leaf tobacco to
that country.
   ``Cigarette manufacturers have clearly won by gaining access to
this market which earned them $56.4 million in 1988 and holds
promise for even greater annual earnings in the future,'' the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service said.
   Shipments of ``unmanufactured'' leaf tobacco to South Korea last
year were valued at less than $10 million, but that was the most
since U.S. leaf exports were about $40 million in 1981. The $56.4
million in cigarette shipments was the most ever.
   ``U.S. cigarettes have historically faced stringent trade
restrictions in this market,'' the report said. ``Prior to 1986, it
was illegal for Korean citizens even to possess foreign cigarettes.
This prohibition was lifted in 1986, but U.S. cigarettes continued
to face tought trade restrictions.''
   The restrictions led the U.S. Cigarette Export Association to
file a complaint with the U.S. trade representative on Jan. 1, 1988,
charging that South Korea violated Section 301 of U.S. Trade Act.
   Under the 1974 law, the president can take action, including
retaliation, to obtain the removal of any foreign barrier in
violation of international agreement or deemed discriminatory.
   Negotiations produced a ``record of understanding'' signed with
South Korea on May 27, 1988, which eased restrictions on U.S.
cigarettes carried out by the Korean Monopoly Corp., or KOMOCO.
   ``Soon after the agreement was signed, U.S. manufacturers began
to sign sales agreements with Korean firms, and U.S. cigarette
exports began to explode,'' the report said.
   In June 1988, U.S. cigarette shipments to South Korea increased
30-fold from May. For the entire year, sales totaled 2.4 billion
cigarettes, or ``pieces,'' a 670 percent increase from 312 million
pieces in 1987.

<HEAD>Bush Ethics Panel Gets Mixed Review from Drafter of House Ethics
Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief Democratic architect of ethics
legislation in Congress is pleased that President Bush's commission
decided the basic conflict-of-interest law cannot be applied to
senators and representatives, but he describes another panel idea as
terrible.
   ``I welcomed the panel agreeing with us on the conflict
question,'' said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who drafted the House
version of ethics legislation that President Reagan vetoed last
year. Reagan based his veto in part on differences in the way the
bill treated Congress and the executive branch.
   But Frank did not approve of the way the Bush panel resolved its
most divisive issue: limits on moonlighting income for judges,
members of Congress, top federal officials and senior aides in all
three branches.
   Bush had launched his eight-member commission in January with
instructions to come up with standards ``equitable across all three
branches of the federal government.''
   Nevertheless, Bush's commission decided that the basic law which
prevents executive officials from taking government action affecting
their financial interests could not be applied to members of
Congress for constitutional and other reasons.
   ``They recognized the big difference between the executive and
Congress in saying that you can't apply the basic conflict statute
to Congress, because everybody up here works on everything when they
vote,'' Frank said in an interview Wednesday.
   Frank also hailed the panel's decision to call for officials in
all three branches to take a one-year cooling-off period before they
lobby or appear before their former colleagues on any issue. ``We
had the one-year cooling-off period in last year's legislation but
had to give up on it because of opposition,'' said Frank, who has
reintroduced a version of last year's bill.
   With a series of decisions at its fifth meeting Wednesday, the
commission wrapped up all but the final drafting of a report it
hopes to give Bush late next week. Most of the recommendations
require approval by him and Congress.
   The Bush panel was unable to agree Tuesday or Wednesday on what
types of outside work do not raise ethical issues or interfere with
the full performance of official duties. They wanted to exempt these
pursuits from any limits on moonlighting income.
   Former White House counsel Lloyd Cutler suggested listing
teaching by judges, among others. But former Attorney General
Griffin Bell, who wanted to exempt royalties from books or
inventions, objected to exempting teaching by judges.
   ``When you get above 15 percent of salary for teaching, you're
not a fulltime government worker,'' Bell said. ``You're not in your
office when you're teaching and you need to be there so other judges
can talk to you.''
   So they decided the president should be empowered by a new law to
designate categories of work that would be exempt from any limits on
outside earnings for all three branches.
   Frank rejected that notion out of hand.
   ``For the president to set rules for what outside work the
Congress can do, I don't understand that at all,'' Frank said.
``That's just a terrible idea. It would be better to have each
branch set the rules for the other branch.''
   Other conclusions of the Bush panel were:
   _Congress should set the overall limit on outside earnings at a
percentage of an official's salary. Most of the group favored a
figure closer to the 15 percent which now governs the executive
branch. The judiciary has no limit; the House limit is 30 percent of
salary; the Senate limit, 40 percent.
   _Lesser penalties should be introduced for violations of
conflict-of-interest laws, which now carry felony sentences. ``By
providing alternative prosecutorial tools that can be more carefully
tailored to the offense, these sanctions may expand the number of
enforcement actions,'' Bell said.

   A National Research Council report that said
vitamin pills and some other dietary supplements are useless and
perhaps harmful was denounced as ``a disservice to all Americans''
by a trade group.
   The group, called the Council for Responsible Nutrition, said
that the NRC report released Wednesday failed to acknowledge what it
called ``emerging research'' on benefits from supplements of
vitamins, fiber and calcium.
   ``The NRC report provides only a shallow review of the evidence
on the benefits of nutritional supplements and fails to reflect the
tide of research that supports those benefits,'' the trade
association said in a prepared statement.
   The NRC on Wednesday released a 1,300-page report that is a
compilation by 19 experts of research from many sources related to
diet and health. The three-year study concluded that health is best
maintained by a balanced diet of a variety of foods in a diet that
is reduced in fat and salt, and enriched with fruits, vegetables and
complex carbohydrates.
   The study said the NRC committee found no conclusive evidence
that taking doses of supplemental vitamins, fiber or calcium would
provide protection from cancer, heart disease, embrittlement of
bones or other ailments.
   Annette Dickinson, a nutrition expert and a spokeswoman for the
trade group, said the NRC finding is unrealistic because it did not
recognize that the food eaten by many Americans does not include all
the nutrients in the recommended dietary allowance developed by the
federal government.
   ``People simply are not getting those required amounts,'' said
Ms. Dickinson. ``We believe that it is better that they get them
(nutrients) somewhere'' than not at all.
   She said the NRC study is ``backing away'' from the use of a
number of supplements that have been shown to be ``quite
effective.'' She said that the report springs from a bias against
supplements in favor of a balanced diet.
   Ms. Dickinson acknowledged that research reports on the value of
supplements have had mixed results historically and admitted that
``there is a lot of bias on both sides'' about their use.
   The NRC study said that dietary supplements was a $3 billion
business in 1987, and that many doctors, nurses and nutritionists
take multivitamins and other supplements. It said many people
self-prescribe supplements containing nutrients far in excess of the
RDA set by the federal government.
   A daily dose of multiple vitamins with 100 percent of the RDA
``is not known to be harmful or beneficial,'' the report said.
``However, vitamin-mineral supplements that exceed the RDA and other
supplements (such as protein powders, single amino acids, fiber and
lecithin) not only have no known health benefits ... but their use
may be detrimental to health.''
   Though the study recommended foods high in calcium, it noted that
``the potential benefits of calcium intakes above the RDAs to
prevent osteoporosis or hypertension are not well documented and do
not justify the use of calcium supplements.''
   Fiber supplements by themselves, the report said, did not confer
any protection against disease, but fiber taken with fruits,
vegetables, grains and legumes are beneficial. The study recommended
five or more servings daily of fruit or vegetables, and six or more
servings of bread, cereals or legumes.

<HEAD>Murder Conviction Of Man Who Served 13 Years Overturned</HEAD>

   A man whose capital murder conviction has
been overturned after he spent 13 years behind bars says he won't be
satisfied until his innocence is proven through a new trial.
   ``If the case is dropped where does that leave me?'' Randall Dale
Adams told The Associated Press on Wednesday after a state appeals
court overturned his conviction. ``It leaves me on the courthouse
steps with nothing.''
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled that Adams, whose
conviction for the 1976 slaying of a Dallas police officer was
questioned in the film ``The Thin Blue Line,'' had been denied a
fair trial because witnesses lied and the prosecutor suppressed
evidence.
   It ordered the 40-year-old Adams transferred from the Eastham
Unit state prison to the custody of Dallas County, where he will be
entitled to release on bond, said his attorney, Randy Schaffer.
   ``This is what I've been asking for for 13 years. I'm happy to
have a second chance,'' Adams said.
   ``I felt from the beginning I would win this case,'' he added.
``It's taken 12{, 13 years. I have never had a doubt this would
come.''
   The case attracted attention last year with the release of Errol
Morris' documentary. Morris said from Los Angeles he was ``delighted
and relieved'' and hoped people realized that Adams was not getting
off on a technicality.
   ``Randall Adams is truly an innocent man,'' Morris said. ``And
there was a terrible miscarriage of justice 12 years ago.''
   The Dallas County District Attorney will decide soon whether to
pursue a retrial, said assistant prosecutor Norm Kinne.
   Although Adams said he does not believe the state will retry him,
Schaffer predicted prosecutors will insist on a new trial for
political reasons.
   ``I am certain the state does not have evidence to persuade a
jury beyond a reasonable doubt that Adams committed this crime,'' he
said. ``Every witness in the case has been totally and completely
discredited.''
   Asked whether he was bitter, Adams said. ``I've had 13 years
taken from my life. Can the state replace that?''
   Adams has worked as a clerk in the prison maintenance office and
earned an associate degree in general studies while imprisoned.
   ``Prison is not the life I would have wanted to live, but it is a
life and I think I have used it wisely,'' he said. ``I have a
college education and many more job skills than when I came here. I
like the person I am today.''
   In 1979, Adams was within three days of death when his execution
was stayed. The next year, his death sentence was commuted to life.
   ``You do not come three days from execution without changing,''
Adams said. ``I am a different man from the one who was locked up in
December 1976. I have grown in my own way ... as much as possible to
build my inner life, my family life.
   ``If I could change anything, I would never have been in Dallas,
in Texas.''
   The appellate judges said prosecutor Doug Mulder suppressed
evidence and knowingly allowed perjured testimony during Adams' 1977
trial.
   Mulder did not return phone calls for comment.
   ``It is the fundamental, constitutional purpose of this court to
insure that a convicted defendant received a fair trial,'' wrote
Judge M.P. Duncan. ``When deceit produces court rulings that have
the effect of denying one a fair trial then the conviction should be
vacated.''
   The court said the state knowingly suppressed evidence that
witness Emily Miller had failed to identify Adams in a police
lineup; that a police officer advised her she didn't identify Adams;
and that the officer told her the person she should have identified.
   It also said Ms. Miller committed perjury by testifying she had
identified Adams in the lineup.
   The film suggests that David Harris, who was the chief accuser in
the 1977 trial, committed the slaying.
   Harris recanted his testimony in the movie and again during a
December hearing before state District Judge Larry Baraka. Harris is
on Death Row for another slaying.
   ``We would have won this case without David Harris. But I
appreciate the fact that he was willing to talk,'' Adams said.
   ``I would like to say I forgive David Harris but that is very
hard to do. David Harris has to pay for his crimes,'' he said.
   On Nov. 28, 1976, Adams ran out of gas while driving home from
work. Harris, a 16-year-old at the time who had stolen a car, helped
Adams get gas and spent part of the day with him.
   Officer Robert Wood was fatally shot that night by a motorist he
had pulled over on a traffic violation. Harris testified in 1977
that Adams killed Wood. Adams said he and Harris, then 16, parted
company long before the shooting.
   Adams' mother, Mildred Adams of Columbus, Ohio, was overjoyed at
the news of the ruling.
   ``We had planned on going down to TDC over Easter break to see
him,'' she said. ``Now I just don't have the words to express
myself. We're just as happy as can be up here.''

   NASA plans to land robot probes on a comet and
on a moon of Saturn early next century in new programs that would
cost $1.6 billion over the next seven years.
   In testimony prepared for a budget hearing before the House
committee on science, space and technology, National Aeronautics and
Space Administration scientist Lennard A. Fisk said Wednesday that
the unmanned spacecraft would allow the United States to maintain
world leadership in exploration of the solar system.
   Fisk, the associate NASA administrator for space science and
applications, said a mission called Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby,
or CRAF, would be launched in 1995 and would streak through space
for five years before meeting in space with the comet Kopff and
dropping a probe to its surface.
   He said the probe from the spacecraft would penetrate to the core
of the comet and study the chemistry of material that may date from
the beginning of the solar system.
   A second mission, called Cassini, would be launched in 1996 and
arrive in an orbit of the planet Saturn in the year 2002.
   Once there, Fisk said, the craft would drop a robot lander to the
surface of Titan, one of Saturn's moons, and conduct a chemical
analysis.
   This study, said the scientist, could provide a fundamental
understanding about the origins of life.
   ``The chemistry that gave rise to life in the past is no longer
available for us to study (on Earth),'' he said. ``However, we
believe that a chemistry similar to that on the early Earth ...
exists today on Titan.''
   The two missions, said Fisk, will both study primordial, pristine
matter, ``the material from which the solar system formed, the
material from which life on Earth formed, and the chemistry which
gave rise to that life.''
   Fisk said that the missions will require an appropriation of $30
million in fiscal year 1990, with increases every year that follows
for a total of about $1.6 billion by the time the spacecraft are
launched.
   He said the opportunity to fly the missions may be lost if the
money is not approved this year because the planetary alignment will
change and make the missions impossible.

   Leaders of a second major education group have
gone on record opposing the idea of beaming commercials into the
classroom as part of a televised news program designed for
teen-agers.
   The National Parent-Teacher Association said Wednesday its
22-member executive committee took the position this weekend in
response to a venture called Channel One proposed by Whittle
Communciations LP, a Tennessee-based media concern.
   Whittle has proposed giving thousands of high schools about
$50,000 worth of television sets and other electronic equipment each
to beam to them a daily 12-minute news show that would include up to
two minutes of commercials.
   The show would be sent by satellite to participating schools,
which would be expected to show the program to the entire student
body each school day.
   ``We applaud the efforts to bring new technology and creative
means of instruction into our schools,'' National PTA President
Manya Ungar said.
   ``However, we are opposed to making the availability of that
technology and programming contingent upon subjecting a captive
student audience to the promotion of commecial products or
services.''
   The PTA has 6.4 million members in 26,000 local units across the
country.
   On Monday, leaders of the National Association of Secondary
School Principals voted, without specifically mentioning Channel
One, to urge schools against participating in ventures in which
commercials are inserted into educational programs.
   Whittle plans to begin testing its service in six schools
starting next week. Its chairman, Christopher Whittle, showed a
prototype of the program to PTA leaders last weekend before the vote.
   ``I'm sorry they feel that way,'' said William S. Rukeyser,
editor-in-chief of Whittle Communications. ``To say the commercials
are unacceptable while the program is acceptable is begging the
question.''
   He said educators have said for a decade that a televised news
program could benefit students, but have never found a way to pay
for it.
   ``We'd be delighted to produce all this and send it to the
schools, but that is a fantasy,'' he said.
   He said critics of the program should withhold judgment until the
pilot tests are completed. The test is expected to run through April.
   The $5 million test of the Channel One program starts Monday at
Eisenhower Middle School in Kansas City, Kan.; Mumford High School
in Detroit; Central High School in Knoxville, Tenn.; Billerica
Memorial High School in Billerica, Mass.; Withrow High School in
Cincinnati; and Gahr High School in Cerritos, Calif.
   Sponsors of the program have not been identified.

   The city is ``saturated'' with aliens denied
jobs because of the new immigration law, possibly leading to this
week's arrests of 175 suspected illegal immigrants smuggled east on
airlines, officials said.
   ``A year ago we'd average five men a night sleeping in our
church. We now have 90. We also have 40 women and children in our
convent,'' said the Rev. Gregory Boyle, pastor of Mission Dolores, a
Roman Catholic parish that has become a refuge to illegal immigrants
from Mexico and Central America.
   U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service agents on Wednesday
arrested 27 more suspected illegal aliens aboard a Piedmont Airlines
flight during a stop in Charlotte, N.C., between Phoenix and New
York.
   The journey of the Salvadorans, Ecuadorans, Mexicans and
Brazilians began with an America West flight from Los Angeles to
Phoenix, authorities said.
   On Monday, 79 suspected illegal aliens taking Eastern Airlines'
``red eye'' from Los Angeles to New York were arrested during a stop
in Atlanta. Late Monday, 69 were arrested while boarding the same
flight in Los Angeles.
   The 1986 Immigration Control and Reform Act hits employers with
sanctions if they hire illegal aliens. On Wednesday, a California
farm labor contractor accused of more than 330 violations of the law
became the first agricultural business in the nation to be fined
under the law.
   S&amp;A Farm Contractors of Madera was fined $153,250 for employing
27 illegal aliens who were arrested during Border Patrol sweeps in
January, said J. William Carter, chief of the Border Patrol office
in Livermore.
   Some officials say the law may be the reason why illegal
immigrants are turning away from their longtime destination, Los
Angeles and California farms.
   Neil Jacobs, the assistant INS director for investigations in
Atlanta, described Los Angeles as ``literally saturated with
aliens,'' and said word has gotten around that they can't get jobs.
   Boyle agreed, and said it stems from the immigration law reform.
   ``My feeling is there is a saturation here,'' he said, noting
that movement into the agricultural San Joaquin Valley evaporated
months ago.
   Smugglers' use of airlines is not new, although it is not
considered commonplace. The Charlotte arrests were the third for
that Piedmont flight since October.
   ``Apparently, they've been using the flight for the last three
months pretty regularly,'' said David Carmichael, INS supervisor in
Charlotte.
   In the case of Eastern's ``red eye,'' Flight 80, the INS believes
several smugglers were taking advantage of low fares to move the
aliens, who are subject to deportation if caught.
   ``This flight, we are hopeful, will be closed to smugglers of
aliens, but we expect there will be other flights in the future,''
said Donald H. Looney, acting district director of the INS in Los
Angeles.
   Airlines say they cooperate with the INS but do not have policies
of trying to determine if any passengers might be illegal immigrants.
   ``We don't engage in trying to detect these types of
passengers,'' said Eastern spokeswoman Virginia Sanchez in Miami.
``That's what the INS is there for. If they wish to enforce their
immigration regulations, that's part of their job.''
   America West reserves the right to ask any passenger for
identification, but that would not be operationally possible
considering the airline carried 13 million passengers last year,
said spokesman Dick Shimizu.
   ``I'm sure you would be able to see the enormous delays.''
   Delta, a major airline serving Los Angeles, also doesn't check
identification, said spokeswoman Glenda Hatchett Johnson in Atlanta.
   Boyle, the parish pastor, is not convinced that large numbers are
leaving Los Angeles, especially by the smuggling schemes that the
INS said cost aliens up to $4,000. ``The concept of $4,000 _ I can't
even wrap my mind about that one,'' he said.
   He is certain, however, that illegal immigrants will continue to
come.
   ``As hopeless as things are becoming here, it's even more so from
where they come,'' Boyle said.
   ``Nightly, now, there's not a single square foot of place left
where a person could lie down.''

   Firefighters nationwide need to be notified
when hazardous materials are present so they can avoid accidents
such as the one that killed six Kansas City, Mo., firemen last year,
a House panel was told.
   ``They had no warning that the fire they were trying to
extinguish was a time bomb waiting to take their lives,'' Terry
Conroy, president of the Kansas City chapter of the International
Association of Firefighters, said Wednesday.
   At a hearing before a House Government Operations subcommittee,
Conroy, other firefighting officials and several members of Congress
said that accident pointed to the need for tighter and more
coordinated regulation of hazardous materials as well as improved
training for firemen.
   The Kansas City firefighters were killed when a trailer loaded
with tons of blasting agent exploded at a highway construction site
Nov. 29. Lawmakers were told that a dispatcher warned the
firefighters that explosives might be in the area but was unable to
provide the specific location or the type of hazardous material
involved.

<NOTE>Expanded Methadone Program Proposed</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two federal agencies hope to fight AIDS among
heroin addicts by making methadone treatments available to more
addicts sooner and thus reducing exposure to AIDS through
needle-sharing.
   The plan, to be published in today's Federal Register, was
proposed by the Food and Drug Administration and the National
Institute on Drug Abuse. It would allow interim methadone treatment
in cities where comprehensive treatment programs have waiting lists.
   Intravenous heroin addicts often share needles and, in doing so,
become infected with the virus that causes the deadly disease.
   Methadone, which is used to help relieve an addict's craving for
heroin, is taken by mouth, which eliminates the risk from needles.
   Although methadone is best used as part of a comprehensive
treatment program that includes counseling and other vocational and
rehabilitative services, many clinics have waiting lists of six
months or more, the agencies said.

   Share prices rebounded after a setback in early
trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Thursday, while the dollar
inched up from the previous day's closing.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which lost 21.30 points
Wednesday, sharply rebounded and gained 109.43 points, or 0.34
percent, to end trading at 32,073.73. The index, which shed 83.74

afternoon.
   The dollar finished trading at 128.07 yen, up 0.39 yen from
Wednesday's 127.68-yen close. The currency opened at 127.93 yen and
fluctuated between 127.90 yen and 128.50 yen.
   Dealers said the dollar started higher in Tokyo following its
overnight strength in overseas trading where market players bought
the currency following diminishing concern of an interest-rate hike
in West Germany.
   They said foreign banks and securities firms were leading buyers
of the U.S currency in Tokyo. If West Germany did not raise its
interest rate, investors were likely to buy it in even larger
quantities, the dealers added.
   Stock dealers said the Nikkei started rebounding as investors
began buying real estate issues.

   A common domestic cat served as a surrogate
mother to give birth to a wildcat in a technique that researchers
say can help save endangered species.
   The embryo of an endangered Indian desert cat was implanted into
the house cat by in vitro fertilization, Cincinnati Zoo officials
said Wednesday. The offspring was born Feb. 7.
   ``There are millions of domestic cats, and so few of these exotic
cats,'' said Betsy Dresser, research director at the zoo's Center
for Reproduction of Endangered Wildlife.
   Zoo officials said they believed it was the first time a common
domestic cat was used as the surrogate mother.
   The University of Florida veterinary school has implanted embryos
from the endangered Florida panther in Texas mountain lions, and in
vitro fertilization involving a leopard cat has been used at the
National Zoo in Washington, D.C.
   The Cincinnati center has made breakthroughs during the past few
years with its work in embryo transplants from one species to
another. Researchers successfully have frozen embryos, thawed them
and transplanted them into other animals.
   The aim is to develop the technology and techniques for
transplanting embryos from endangered species into more common
animals, thus increasing the chances of the species' survival.
   The center has successfully transplanted the embryos of an exotic
species to a common one with different types of antelope and cows.
   Ms. Dresser's work was praised by an official at the San Diego
Zoo, which also has been researching how to help reproduction of
endangered animal species.
   ``We salute this type of work because there are so many species
in dire straits today. Any method devoted to the enhancement of
production of endangered species, our organization whole-heartedly
supports,'' said Tom Hanscom, spokesman for the San Diego Zoo Wild
Animal Park.
   Ms. Dresser said the center has been studying cats for several
years to learn more about their reproduction for such a transfer.
Eggs and sperm were gathered from desert cats, the eggs were
fertilized in a glass dish, and the embryos were implanted in the
domestic cat. Two embryos survived, but one of the kittens was born
dead.
   The desert cat is a close relative to the domestic cat, with
similar size and appearance.
   The mother is treating the kitten like a regular offspring, but
the kitten won't take on characteristics of the mother.
   ``She thinks she had the ugliest kid on the block,'' Dresser
joked. ``Every time you pick up the desert cat and put it back, she
gives it a bath.''
   The researchers decided to use two closely related types of cat
for the first transfer. They are not sure which other cat species
are close enough to permit such transfers.
   ``We don't know in the relationships how far away you can go,''
Ms. Dresser said.
   The next round of work at the center will involve transfers of
jungle cat and golden cat embryos. The work also will help them
understand the similiarities and differences between cat species.
   ``This is a new way to allow us to look at the physiological
side,'' Ms. Dresser said.

   Subway gunman Bernhard Goetz, who comes up for
parole Sunday, should remain jailed for his full one-year term
because early release would encourage recidivism, the prosecutor
said.
   Assistant District Attorney Gregory Waples, in a letter Wednesday
to the state parole board chairman, said Goetz had shown no remorse
for his Dec. 22, 1984, shooting of four youths on a subway train.
   ``Conditional release would ... increase the likelihood of
recidivism by signaling to Goetz, if only in some subtle and
unintended way, that the law ... does not truly mean what it says,''
wrote Waples.
   The prosecutor also cited Goetz's ``outspoken advocacy of arming
citizens with handguns.''
   One of the four youths remains paralyzed from the incident. Goetz
was sentenced Jan. 13 on a weapons conviction.

world's largest overindulgence of pork and beer is expanding its
menu this year to include such delights as alligator tail and
``swamp cabbage.''
   ``It's a real motley assortment,'' said Carolyn Gluckert, a
spokeswoman for the Memphis in May International Festival.
   The World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest, which is part of
the city's month-long May festival, is held on a downtown bluff
overlooking the Mississippi River and attracts cooking teams from
around the country, and occasionally from abroad.
   The May 11-13 affair includes a parade, costume contest and
outdoor musical shows. It draws thousands of spectators, beer
drinkers and barbecue eaters.
   Cooking teams for last year's 11th annual cookoff fired up 50,610
pounds of pork.
   The contest judging is in three categories, whole hog, shoulder
and ribs, but a new one is being added. It's called ``Anything
But,'' Ms. Gluckert said.
   The ``Anything But'' will be limited, on a first-come basis, to
60 of the 175 cooking teams taking part in the barbecue. Early
entries have indicated plans to cook venison, various crustaceans
and alligator tail, Ms. Gluckert said.
   The contestants can also add trimmings in trying to sway the
judges, and hush puppies and something mysterious called ``swamp
cabbage,'' have been mentioned so far, she said.

<HEAD>Blubber Helps Ward Off Cold For Whale Spending First Winter In Ohio</HEAD>

   When your roots are in Iceland, the first
winter in Ohio isn't as intimidating, even if you spent your first
13 in Florida and California.
   It also helps to eat about 75,000 calories a day.
   Shamu, a 16{-foot, 6,400-pound white and black killer whale, is
getting along just fine amid 39 inches of snow and 85 days of
freezing temperatures for the season.
   She spent her first 13 winters at Sea Worlds in Orlando, Fla.,
and in San Diego but comes from hardy stock: She was captured off
Iceland.
   ``This has perhaps been her coldest weather,'' said Stan W.
Searles, curator at the 90-acre Sea World marine park 30 miles
southeast of Cleveland.
   During past winters Shamu _ a stage name shared by killer whales
at other Sea Worlds _ has been transported to Orlando or San Diego
because of research or breeding needs.
   ``This has been a very mild winter for Ohio,'' Searles said in an
interview in his office tucked inside the back of Shamu's 4,000-seat
stadium. ``It is not a problem for her. She has a huge blubber
layer.''
   Six inches in all, according to Searles.
   He adjusts Shamu's winter diet to provide her with more calories
because she must expend more energy to keep warm amid the cold air,
even if the water in her open-air pool is kept at about 55 degrees
year-round.
   ``She's certainly aware that it's colder,'' he said, ``because
she's breathing colder air.''
   On a recent day when snow was swirling in the wind and the
temperature dipped to 14 degrees, Shamu was active and ready to play
when trainer Beth Riegelmayer appeared in a multicolored wet suit
with a bucket of fish.
   Searles, whose staff feeds Shamu 140 pounds of frozen fish daily,
sometimes cuts back the rations of herring, smelt and squid to 130
pounds if she's less interested.
   ``We can just tell she's not as hungry,'' said Seales, who
increases calorie-rich herring portions when Shamu requires more
food to stay warm on cold days.

<HEAD>Hahn Visits Charlotte For First Time Since Testifying In PTL Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jessica Hahn, whose sexual encounter with
Jim Bakker lead to his ouster from PTL, returned to the city where
the evangelical organization was founded and said she hopes to run
into Bakker.
   If she did, she told reporters Wednesday, ``I'd tell him, `What
did you hope to accomplish with all of this? Did you want to get
(wife) Tammy jealous or what?'''
   Hahn was last in Charlotte in 1987 to testify before a federal
grand jury investigating PTL. The former church secretary from New
York's Long Island returned for a radio station promotion today.
   The Bakkers, who live in Pineville, 10 miles south of Charlotte,
have started a television ministry that is shown on some cable
networks. PTL's properties are now owned by Canadian businessman
Stephen Mernick.
   Hahn admitted she felt somewhat awkward being in Charlotte. But
she said she would walk the grounds of Heritage USA, the Fort Mill,
S.C., religious retreat that was Bakker's citadel.
   ``I really want to go to PTL so I can understand what it's all
about,'' she said. ``It's like trying to find your real father.''
   She said she was saddened when the television ministry fell on
hard times following the revelation of the tryst.
   ``If people want to blame me, fine,'' she said. ``I had so little
to do with PTL falling, but it was that one day that led to it.''
   Hahn, who has appeared nude in two Playboy magazine issues and is
currently featured in a rock video version of ``Wild Thing'' by
comedian Sam Kinison, said she was enjoying her celebrity status.
   ``I am 29, I'm a girl and I'm having fun,'' she said.

<HEAD>Rebvels Reject Cease-Fire, Duarte Gains Support Of Legislature For
Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels have rejected the
army's unilateral cease-fire as ``a publicity maneuver'' and stepped
up attacks, saying they will only accept a negotiated truce in the
9-year-old civil war.
   Later Wednesday, prospects improved for arranging peace talks
with the guerrillas _ who are trying to negotiate participation in
national elections.
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte secured the support of Ricardo
Alvarenga, president of the opposition-controlled legislature, for
direct talks with the rebels and called on them to cease hostilities
as a sign of good will.
   The Legislative Assembly is controlled by the rightist Republican
Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, which has rejected guerrilla demands
that the March 19 presidential vote be postponed so they can
organize a campaign. Arena, of which Alvarenga is a leader, is
leading in the presidential polls.
   The rebels have offered to take part in national elections _
which they have previously boycotted _ and respect the outcome if
their demand for postponement until September and security-related
concerns are met.
   After a five-hour meeting Wednesday, Duarte and Alvarenga told
journalists they had agreed to form a government commission for
talks with guerrilla commanders.
   ``There must be a cessation of hostilities in order to begin
conversations,'' Alvarenga said.
   Duarte, whose government is backed by the United States, urged
the rebel Faribundo Marti National Liberation Front to take such a
step, but also said ``It is not a prerequisite.''
   The rebels on Wednesday ignored the army's three-month unilateral
cease-fire and attacked a garrison town in La Union, the easternmost
province. Just before the army truce began at midnight Tuesday,
rebels attacked a coffee-processing plant six miles north of San
Salvador.
   The rebels reported killing 67 soldiers and wounding 25 in the
attack on the garrison at Santa Rosa de Lima, 110 miles east of San
Salvador. The army said two soldiers, two rebels and a civilian were
killed and seven soldiers wounded in a two-hour attack.
   ``A cease-fire not negotiated between opposing forces is not
real,'' said a statement issued by the rebel general command. ``We
demand a serious response from the government to our communique
regarding negotiations in the capital.''
   On Sunday, Duarte proposed that direct negotiations with the
rebels begin in Guatemala City on Tuesday and that a cease-fire
first take effect.
   The rebels insist any talks be held in San Salvador ``among and
in full view of all Salvadorans'', beginning Saturday. Duarte
reiterated Guatemala as his personal preference on Wednesday.
   ``Once we agree on a date for a meeting in the capital, we will
declare a cessation of offensive operations,'' according to the
rebel command's Wednesday statement.
   ``We consider that the supposed unilateral cease-fire of the
armed forces does not halt repression in the cities, nor does it
withdraw troops from operations in the countryside. It is a
publicity maneuver to give the impression of flexibility.''
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Wednesday in
Washington: ``This decision by President Duarte and the Salvadoran
armed forces addresses the most critical issue, that of bringing
peace to El Salvador.
   ``President Duarte recognizes the crucial fact that violence and
democracy don't mix. We are now waiting for the guerrillas to
demonstrate that they are willing to do the same by ceasing their
ongoing campaign of terrorism and assassinations.''
   The war has claimed more than 70,000 lives.

<HEAD>Britain Curbs Some Emergency Powers In Northern Ireland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some emergency powers introduced by Britain in 1978
to curb guerrilla action in Northern Ireland are not being renewed
because they were found to cause widespread resentment, Northern
Ireland Secretary Tom King says.
   King on Wednesday asked WParliament to drop measures that compel
crowds to disperse, impose directions on the conduct of funerals and
close drinking places.
   Parliament must renew the emergency powers annually for them to
stay in effect.
   Lord Colville, a barrister who reviews the operation of
counter-terrorist laws in the British-ruled province, reported last
month that rudeness on the part of police and soliders was stoking
long-term resentment toward security forces.
   He gave as an example the case of an unidentified man in
Londonderry who had been stopped 33 times last summer under
emergency powers _ and detained each time for between 15 and 45
minutes.
   Colville said winning hearts and minds should be a ``paramount
preoccupation'' for the security forces.
   King said in a House of Commons written reply that he welcomed
the recommendations.

   The entire town of Bolan, Iowa, took the stage of
David Letterman's show knowing the joke was on them, but the 16
residents say the last laugh was theirs.
   They were wined and dined and eventually maligned during a
three-day all-expenses-paid adventure that saw them plucked from
quiet obscurity in the corn and soybean fields of the Midwest for a
sudden assault on their senses in the Big Apple.
   The moment in the sun for the entire population of Bolan's
metropolitan area _ six Bolanites and 10 from the ``suburbs'' _ came
on NBC-TV's ``Late Night with David Letterman.''
   They watched offstage on a monitor as comedian Jeff Altman, the
first guest, told Letterman and the audience that he walked past the
Bolanites to get on stage and one of them said, ``Who the hell is
that?''
   Larry Nydegger, 21, immediately defended himself.
   ``It was me but I didn't say, `hell.'''
   Letterman, whose show was taped late Wednesday and broadcast
early today, held nothing back.
   ``Do you have like a town slut?'' he asked 73-year-old Ruth
Hansen. ``And if so, when she comes up, point her out.''
   Mrs. Hansen, a 50-year resident, chuckled.
   Also put on the spot was Nydegger's 23-year-old sister, Lori, a
weekend resident who admitted that she spends most of her week away
from town.
   ``So, you're just here for the free trip?'' Letterman asked as
she blushed and shook her head. ``Let's string her up.''
   Lori Nydegger was the one who helped draw attention to Bolan
during a 1986 centennial celebration.
   She formed a standstill parade of floats, marching band members
on lawn chairs, and grand marshals on cars, all on the village's
single street. The spectators marched around it while the parade
stood still.
   The town is 130 miles north of Des Moines and consists of an
antique shop, a Methodist church and the Bolan Store Inc., a farm
equipment and supplies store that owns three-fourths of the town's
property and is for sale.
   A 16-acre property with a three-bedroom home, one of eight in
Bolan and its suburbs, is also on the market, for $42,000.
   The 103-year-old community at one time had 75 residents as well
as a general store, a blacksmith, a train depot, a post office,
lumber yards, stock yards and a creamery.
   But the automobile changed everything and Bolan's population has
remained relatively stable _ and small _ the last 20 years.
   While they were away, the Bolanites arranged for friends or
relatives to stay at each of their homes and hired additional
security officers to protect their belongings.
   Letterman, prompted by a staffer intrigued by Bolan, paid for the
Iowans' trip. They stayed at the Mayflower Hotel, where they held a
party after the taping _ and watched themselves on television.
   Earlier, they toured Manhattan, and every corner seemed to bring
something to turn their heads.
   A man cursing loudly for no obvious reason passed near Lori
Nydegger.
   ``Oh my,'' she said. ``They get kind of mad, don't they?''
   Her 17-year-old brother, Loren, said he was ``asked for money
twice in one block.''
   ``I'm glad I grew up where I did,'' he said.
   Comparing motorists in Bolan and Manhattan, 59-year-old Daryl
McCready said: ``We wave at everybody. They give each other the
bird.''
   But McCready said the town was enjoying the trip _ even if some
people were poking fun at them.
   ``We have to laugh at ourselves, too,'' he said. ``Main Street is
720 feet long and it ends in a dead end in a corn field. ...
   ``These people who might laugh at us would like to be in our
place, too,'' McCready said. ``We're in the enviable position of
being the only town that was flown for free to New York.''
   Says Mrs. Hansen: ``The town of Bolan got put back on the map,
especially after NBC and David Letterman.''

<HEAD>GOP Race Still Unsettled; Democratic Nominee Daley Vacations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A primary victory in his pocket, Democratic
mayoral nominee Richard M. Daley has taken a Florida vacation as one
foe hit the streets for the April 4 election and another wondered if
he'd make the ballot.
   Daley sought comfort in the sand, leaving behind a tumultuous
scene, especially with the Republican primary winner still
undetermined, and Jesse Jackson and his former presidential campaign
manager _ national Democratic Party chief Ron Brown _ backing
different candidates in the general election.
   ``Depending on how things shape up in the coming weeks,'' said
Tom Roesser, a veteran political observer active in Republican and
civic circles, ``there could be a lot of blood on the floor _ not to
mention political futures _ by the time this thing is over.''
   For openers, the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners planned
to announce late today the winner of Tuesday's Republican primary:
Edward Vrdolyak, who launched a last-minute write-in campaign, or
Herbert Sohn, the party's endorsed candidate.
   The GOP winner advances to next month's contest against Daley,
son of the legendary boss of Chicago politics, and Alderman Timothy
Evans, a black who is mounting a third-party bid.
   Jackson, who supported Mayor Eugene Sawyer in the primary, has
shifted his allegiance to Evans. Daley, however, received a pledge
of support Wednesday from Brown, although it was not known whether
the chairman, who like Jackson and Sawyer is black, would actively
campaign for Daley.
   Daley headed south after two morning campaign stops, surpising
sleepy-eyed commuters by showing up at a downtown train platform to
shake hands just hours after vanquishing Sawyer, then squeezing into
the front booth of a nearby deli for breakfast.
   Daley, whose victory made Chicago the first among the largest
U.S. cities to have a black incumbent mayor defeated by a white
challenger, appeared confident of getting a second victory next
month.
   He shrugged off predictions that Vrdolyak, who also is white,
would draw off many of the ethnic votes that form the core
constituencies of both men and said he planned to ask Sawyer for his
endorsement.
   He may have to do some arm-twisting. Sawyer suggested he would
not back Daley or Evans, who is accused by many Sawyer admirers of
keeping blacks at home Tuesday and sabotaging the primary.
   ``My general sense is that I will not endorse anyone,'' Sawyer
said. ``I am thinking it through and I've got a lot of people to
talk to before I decide.''
   Evans began his day shaking hands at a train station, then
stopped at restaurants in the Hispanic and white wards where Daley
rolled up impressive vote totals in the primary.
   Evans resumed his earlier criticism of the ``Daley machine,''
suggesting the younger Daley's election would shut minorities out of
city government and revive a closely controlled political and
patronage system his father used to govern during six terms as mayor.
   He campaigned in Daley's home ward Wednesday, a predominantly
white neighborhood called Bridgeport, and declared: ``Tim Evans came
and discovered people who are already committed to a progressive
vision right in the belly of the beast.''
   Evans said he would seek Sawyer's endorsement in a bid to reunite
the coalition of voters who made the late Harold Washington the
city's first black mayor in 1983, and four years later, the first
mayor to win re-election since the elder Daley.
   ``The war was fought hard and fought gallantly,'' he said of
Sawyer's supporters. ``We offer them an opportunity to fight again,
but successfully.''
   A fight was virtually guaranteed on the Republican side as well.
   With 98 percent of the 2,911 precincts reporting, unofficial
returns showed Vrdolyak with 10,711 votes, or 45 percent, to 10,234
votes, or 43 percent for Sohn. Two other candidates each had 5
percent.
   Both have indicated they may seek a recount.
   ``I've got a feeling this thing is far from over,'' said Tom
Leach, Election Board spokesman.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of students crowded the
corridors and stairwells of their university to cheer the son of the
last Hungarian king, who was giving his first public speech in
Communist Hungary.
   The unprecedented event occurred Wednesday in a hall of the Karl
Marx University of Economics, which proved too small to accommodate
all who wanted to hear Otto von Habsburg, the former Hungarian crown
prince.
   Von Habsburg, a 76-year-old West German citizen, arrived Tuesday
to join a visiting delegation of the European parliament.
   The multilingual intellectual, who is still addressed ``Your
Majesty'' by some of his friends in Austria and Germany, is a deputy
to the Strasbourg parliament from the Bavarian Christian Social
Union.
   His father, emperor Charles I of Austria, was crowned King
Charles IV in Budapest Dec. 30, 1916, two years before the
Austro-Hungarian monarchy collapsed.
   The visit, unthinkable only a few years ago, comes as Hungary's
Communist leaders are cautiously enacting a series of reforms under
pressure from independent political groups which are demanding
multiparty democracy.
   Von Habsburg, a symbol of nationalism for many Hungarians, was
fully aware of the uniqueness of the occasion.
   ``It marks a progress in the sense of a freer democracy that the
oldest son of the last crowned King of Hungary can deliver a lecture
as representative of Germany in the European parliament,'' he said.
   His lecture on ``Hungary's Place in Contemporary Europe,''
delivered in faultless Hungarian, was the highpoint of his four-day
visit and also a personal triumph.
   The one-time pretender to the Austrian and Hungarian thrones was
originally slated to speak to 50 or so members of a special
university college at Karl Marx in a hall with a capacity for about
250.
   Reporters covering the event estimated the crowd at about 700.
   After his lecture, von Habsburg, answered questions for at least
45 minutes. His busy schedule during his first official stay in
Hungary called for 20 different interviews, speeches and meetings.
   On Wednesday, he met with senior Communist Party and government
officials including Rezsoe Nyers, a leading economist and Politburo
member who is also a state minister in the government; Istvan
Huszar, the general secretary of the Hungarian People's Front, a
mass organization; and Laszlo Kovacs, a deputy foreign minister.
   In his lecture, von Habsburg said he felt that ``rapprochement
between the European Community and Hungary will become ever
stronger.''
   ``One thing I want to assure my Hungarian friends of: we hold the
door wide open for Hungary in the European Community,'' he declared
to applause.
   Von Habsburg also pleased the audience by noting that on several
occasions he had used Hungarian in the European Parliament to
underscore that the the Soviet bloc country ``has the right to be
present in Europe.''
   Earlier in the day, he attended part of a screening of a
Hungarian film that traces his life from his birth in 1912 to
Strasbourg and has been a box-office hit in Budapest theaters for
weeks.

   Donald Regan and Michael Deaver are targeted by
some gossipy barbs in Maureen Reagan's book, ``First Father, First
Daughter,'' in which she also gives some insights into her father,
the former president.
   She writes that Deaver, the former deputy chief of staff, ``came
to my father's administration not because he believed in Ronald
Reagan's conservative movement ... but because Reagan was a
political train that happened to be leaving the station, and Mike
Deaver wanted to be on board.''
   Her opinion of former White House chief of staff Regan is no
higher: ``He seemed to suffer from that rare snobbery of the greedy
rich.''
   She said Regan had his office remodeled to include an outdoor
patio like the president's, and kept referring to him as ``cousin''
until Reagan joked he would be accused of nepotism if Regan didn't
knock it off.
   The official publication date of ``First Father, First Daughter''
is April 3 but copies of the book will be in some stores near the
end of next week, Jennifer Kittredge, a spokeswoman for publisher
Little, Brown &amp; Co., said Wednesday.
   Excerpts were reported Wednesday in USA Today.
   Ms. Reagan says her father was afraid to fly but overcame his
fear during his first bid for governor of California. She also said
the president joked that would-be assassin John Hinckley ruined a
good suit.

<TEXT>
   A flight attendant who said she was nearly
dragged through a gaping hole in a jumbo jet and a passenger who
suffered ear injuries filed the first lawsuits stemming from the
tragedy aboard United Airlines Flight 811.
   Melvin Belli, the flamboyant San Francisco attorney, is
co-counsel in one of the lawsuits filed against United Airlines and
Boeing Co. on Wednesday, five days after the accident.
   Nine people were hurled to their deaths when the Boeing 747 bound
for New Zealand blew open shortly after takeoff from Honolulu.
Twenty-seven others were treated for injuries in what one crew
member said was ``unbelievable horror.''
   ``I felt like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz when her house gets
picked up and everything gets blown away,'' purser Sarah Shanahan
said in an interview published Wednesday in The Honolulu
Star-Bulletin.
   Shanahan said it was ``truly a miracle that there were not more
injuries to people from things flying around in the cabin. There
were ice buckets, racks of glasses, cartons of juice and bins of
things around.''
   During the ordeal, she said, she instructed the passengers to
tighten their seat belts, grab their ankles and ``stay down until
you know we're back on Earth and we've stopped.''
   When the captain announced that the plane was two minutes from
the end of the runway, ``people kept unfastening their seat belts
and standing up to look out the windows,'' she said. ``I'm sure that
they wanted the reassurance. They wanted to see those Honolulu city
lights.
   ``That's why I'm hoarse. I screamed for two minutes: `Grab your
ankles! Stay down! Stay down! Stay down!''' Shanahan said.
   The lawsuits were filed by passenger Edwin Geoffrey Tudor of New
South Wales, Australia, and Mae S. Sapolu, a United flight attendant
from Honolulu.
   Tudor's lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court here, asks
unspecified damages from United Airlines and Boeing and alleges
negligence in maintaining the airplane.
   Tudor suffered ear injuries and emotional distress, according to
Belli's co-counsel, John S. Carroll. He declined to elaborate on
Tudor's claim of neglect.
   Ms. Sapolu is suing in state court, asking unspecified damages
from Boeing.
   She was serving drinks when the hole opened, according to her
attorney, L. Richard Fried Jr. She was thrown to the floor two rows
behind the hole and had to cling to a seat to keep from being swept
out of the plane, Fried said.
   Sapolu said she suffered physical and emotional injuries.
   Fried said he believes Boeing has failed to fully inform airlines
about problems with its jets: ``It's our feeling that Boeing knew
things about aging problems with these aircraft that they're not
passing along to carriers.''
   His firm has been designated lead counsel in suits stemming from
last year's accident aboard an Aloha Airlines Boeing 737, when a
hole ripped open in the fuselage, killing a flight attendant.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators suspect a
forward cargo door on the United jet popped open at 22,000 feet,
tearing away with a large section of fuselage.
   Jack Gamble, a spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said
the company would not comment on the lawsuits. A United spokesman
did not immediately return a phone call.
   The damaged jetliner will be repaired, although there was no
estimate on when it will be returned to service, Jim Guyette,
United's executive vice president for operations, said earlier.

<HEAD>Baby Dies As Mom Wins Custody</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mother who wanted to bring her
terminally ill 3-year-old daughter home to die got a judge's order
granting her custody and read it aloud in the child's hospital room.
   But little Candice Dutchak never made it home. She died five
minutes later.
   ``It was almost like she was waiting for me to hand that order to
her parents,'' said Sara Rahdert, an attorney who helped Cheryl
Dutchak win back her daughter from state custody. ``I know that
sounds strange, but that was what it was like,''
   Mrs. Dutchak spent nearly a year fighting to bring Candice home
to die. A judge signed the order Monday in Clearwater and Ms.
Rahdert rushed it to All Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg,
about 25 miles away.
   Candice suffered health problems caused by a loss of amniotic
fluid during her mother's pregnancy. Doctors had recommended an
abortion.
   Complications kept the newborn in the hospital for two months.
She lost her right leg at the knee because of circulation problems.
And later, her kidneys began to fail.
   Last March, Candice suffered brain damage after a seizure, which
doctors said occurred when Mrs. Dutchak withheld medication. Mrs.
Dutchak said an emergency room doctor told her to withhold the
medicine.
   In April, the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative
Services charged Mrs. Dutchak with child abuse and took the baby
away.
   The charge was dropped, but the state retained custody and agreed
to work out a compromise, stating that the mother could take the
baby home if she proved she was fit.
   The baby's condition worsened and on Monday, doctors called Mrs.
Dutchak and said Candice was close to death.
   Ms. Rahdert sought an emergency custody order, and a hearing was
scheduled. But Department of Health and Rehabilitative Sservices
District Administrator Michael Becker agreed ``for humanitarian
reasons'' to release the girl to her mother.
   Circuit Judge Jack Page signed the order transferring custody
about 12:45 p.m., the attorney said.
   ``I dashed from the courthouse ... to the hospital ... Cheryl
read the order out loud stating that they did get custody back,''
Ms. Rahdert said. `About five minutes after mom read this order out
loud to everyone in the room, including the child, the child died.
...
   ``It was a very hollow victory.''

   State foresters who battled a four-day fire that
scorched 17,000 acres of the drought-parched Everglades have offered
$1,000 for information leading to the arrests of those who sparked
the blaze.
   The wildfire was finally doused Wednesday afternoon as heavy
rains moved into the area, but firefighters planned to fly over the
burned area today to check on any new fires, said state Forestry
Division duty officer Phil DeAngelis in Fort Lauderdale.
   ``We don't expect any problems with (the fire restarting), but it
was an arson, so you never know what's going to happen,'' said
DeAngelis.
   Investigators today still tried to pinpoint the origin of the
massive fire, which threatened power lines and forced some road
closings because of thick smoke, DeAngelis said.
   Another wildfire in southeast Florida burned 4,100 acres of
cypress and palmetto trees and engulfed six camp buildings used by
hunters in Collier County before a brief shower helped firefighters
contain it Wednesday morning, said duty officer Roberta Smith in
Fort Myers.
   ``It seemed like it rained right over the fire,'' Ms. Smith said.
``That helped us out an awful lot.''
   The two blazes were the largest of more than 50 brush fires the
forestry division has fought since Monday with about 400
firefighters, said Charles Maynard, the agency's spokesman in
Tallahassee.
   ``We're probably in better shape than we have been all week,''
state forestry division spokesman Jim Whitson said Wednesday. ``It
looks like we've got some moisture coming into the state right now.''
   The Everglades fire finally stalled at a canal near the
Broward-Palm Beach county line after firefighters set backfires with
incendiary bombs dropped from a helicopter.
   Their strategy managed to keep a 10-mile-long wall of flame away
from power lines serving more than 3 million South Florida
residents. In 1985, an Everglades fire that burned more than 100,000
acres engulfed power lines and caused massive blackouts in South
Florida.
   ``We got it out with a little help from Mother Nature,''
DeAngelis said. ``Some of our boys suffered exhaustion from working
the fire so long, but there were no serious injuries.''
   In central Florida, however, two volunteer firefighters
responding to a wildfire Monday were killed when a tractor-trailer
slammed into their smoke-shrouded fire truck.
   The extent of last month's hot, dry weather became clear
Wednesday when the weather service released temperature and rainfall
data.
   In Miami, the average high temperature in February was 79.6
degrees, or 3.8 degrees above normal, and measurable rain was
reported only three times. Only 0.71 inch of rain fell at Miami
International Airport, or 1.31 inches below normal.
   In Fort Myers on the Gulf Coast, the average high temperature was
79.7 degrees, or 4.6 degrees above normal. Measurable rain fell only
twice for a total of 0.36 inch, or 1.7 inches below normal.

   An undercover federal drug agent was shot out of
``cold-bloodedness'' by a man who probably was unaware he was
dealing with a law enforcement officer, authorities said.
   The slaying of Special Agent Everette Hatcher on Tuesday was the
first killing of a Drug Enforcement Administration officer in the
New York area since 1972, said DEA spokesman Robert Strang.
   Investigators do not believe Hatcher's cover had been blown, said
William Y. Doran, special agent in charge of the FBI's Criminal
Division.
   ``This was not a `buy and bust' situation. There were no drugs
present. There was no money present,'' Doran said. ``The killing was
out of cold-bloodedness as far as we can determine.''
   The DEA, FBI and police issued a nationwide bulletin for the man
Hatcher went to meet, Constabile ``Gus'' Farace, 28, of Staten
Island.
   Drug agency officials said Hatcher, 46, who had been an Army
captain in the Vietnam War, chose to go to the meeting at a diner
unarmed. He was wearing a radio transmitter and had five backup men,
but they lost contact as he drove through heavy traffic.
   Doran said Hatcher's wire had not been disturbed when he was
found slumped over the wheel of an unmarked car on a dead-end
street, shot four times in the head and upper body.
   Farace was released from the Elmira Correction Facility in June
after serving eight years for the 1979 kidnapping and murder of a
New Jersey teen-ager who was killed on Staten Island, said police
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Hatcher had worked at the New York office since joining the DEA
in 1972. At the time of his death, he was part of a joint DEA-FBI
Task Force engaged in a long-term drug investigation, officials said.

<HEAD>280 To Be Freed Following Protest, But Detentions To Continue</HEAD>

   Law and Order Minister Adriaan
Vlok said today that 280 detainees, more than a quarter of those
being held without charge, will be free by this weekend.
   However, Vlok, who arranged the releases over a two-week period
as part of an effort to end a widespread hunger strike, said the
government had no plans to lift the 32-month state of emergency that
allows indefinite detention without trial.
   An anti-apartheid newspaper, New Nation, said today that more
than 50 people had been detained in the two weeks since Vlok's
pledge of large-scale releases prompted most of the hunger strikers
to suspend their fast.
   Hunger strikes continue at prisons in Natal Province. The exact
number of participants is not known, but laywers say at least 18
have been hospitalized.
   Vlok, in a statement, said: ``Although the release of detainees
is an ongoing process, I will not hesitate to take whatever steps
necessary to prevent renewed violence and unrest.''
   ``The revolutionary climate is still very high,'' he said. ``The
present state of emergency is still very necessary.''
   He cited continuing black-on-black factional violence in Natal
Province, instability at schools in the township of Soweto, and a
persistent rent boycott by blacks in several townships.
   Vlok's statement came a day after he conferred with Anglican
Archbiship Desmond Tutu and other anti-apartheid church leaders.
Most of the clergymen had met with Vlok on Feb. 16, at the height of
the hunger strike, and emerged to call for suspension of the protest
because Vlok had promised to free a ``substantial number'' of
detainees.
   Anti-apartheid leaders have praised Vlok's willingness to meet
with clergymen and lawyers concerning detainees but have criticized
severe restrictions placed on many of those freed.
   Many of the released activists have been barred from political
activity and ordered to be in their homes each night.
   In a separate development, a pro-government newspaper criticized
the leader of the Dutch Reformed Church for questioning the
government's refusal to negotiate with the banned African National
Congress until the guerrilla movement renounces violence.
   Johan Heyns, leader of the denomination to which most government
officials and other Afrikaners belong, said in a debate Monday that
he had ``ethical problems'' with the government's stance.
   He said a renunciation of violence by the ANC would be a result
of negotiations and should not be a precondition.
   The Citizen, a Johannesburg daily, said it hoped Heyns' comments
had no effect.
   ``Why give credibility to an organization that uses violence to
achieve its political aims?'' it asked in an editorial. ``Why turn
the men with guns and limpet mines into ordinary, acceptable
participants in the efforts to establish a new order?''
   Under apartheid, the country's 28 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   Soviet authorities allowed 2,226 Jews to leave in
February, the second straight monthly drop in emigration but sharply
above last year's monthly average, a resettlement agency said today.
   Only 119 of the 2,226 Soviet Jews arriving at a Vienna transit
center chose to resettle in Israel, said Regina Boucault, a
spokeswoman for the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration.
   Jewish emigration hit an eight-year high of 3,510 in December,
then dipped to 2,616 in January. Last year's exodus totaled 20,082,
the largest since 1980.
   The largest official outflow, about 51,000, was in 1979 before
the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan chilled East-West relations.

   They made headlines when they broke the
law, but now they write headlines in prison publications across the
country.
   ``We consider ourselves professionals,'' said 33-year-old Robert
Taliaferro, who edits The Prison Mirror at the Minnesota
Correctional Facility in Stillwater as he serves a life sentence for
murder.
   The Prison Mirror recently was named ``Best Newspaper'' for 1988
in the 25th annual American Penal Press contest, sponsored by
Southern Illinois University-Carbondale. Taliaferro's paper won the
title for the third consecutive year.
   ``There is so much passion and intensity in corrections'
journalism,'' said Walter Jaehnig, journalism school director at
SIU. He said the school's competition is the only penal press
contest in the nation.
   ``You can see it in their work. I've been real impressed with
what I've seen,'' he said. ``We feel it's important to encourage
journalism wherever you find it _ in high schools or prison, or
anywhere else.''
   Vienna in Progress, the newspaper at the Vienna Correctional
Center in Southern Illinois, captured second place in the prison
press contest, and the Echo of the Texas Department of Corrections
in Huntsville came in third.
   ``I think it shows the world that certain inmates are capable of
extracting the good from themselves,'' said David Patin, editor of
Vienna in Progress since October.
   ``It's an outlet here that lets them express themselves on a
different level,'' added Patin, 35, of Chicago, who is serving a
five-year sentence for robbery.
   ``Here, there's not much opportunity for intellectual exchange,''
he said Wednesday.
   ``I would be very happy,'' Taliaferro told a reporter, ``to send
my guys out there and compete with any one of you guys.''
   Both editors said their publications focus on the positive side
of prison life, including educational and vocational programs, as
well as on problems and issues in prison, like AIDS. Neither editor
has had formal journalistic training.
   Taliaferro said he looks for good, aggressive writers for his
five-member staff, people who can get information in a place known
for its reticent residents.
   He also said prison newspaper work has its perks, like freedom to
roam the institution.
   John Levesque, publisher of the Edwardsville Intelligencer and
judge of the ``Best Newspaper'' category, said he reviewed about 30
entries that ranged from good to ``dreadful.''
   ``There are some good writers in prison,'' said Levesque. ``I was
encouraged that these people are getting some worthwhile experience
in prison.''
   The contest offers 10 other categories in addition to ``Best
Newspaper,'' including best magazine, picture, sports, poetry,
editorial, feature, cartoon, fiction, art and news story.
   But most importantly, Taliaferro and Patin said, prison
publications give inmates an opportunity to learn a trade, bettering
their chances of getting a job after prison.
   ``What it comes down to is a sense of pride,'' said Taliaferro,
speaking about the newspaper's first-place award. ``Some of these
guys have not won anything in their lives. ``It's something
progressive, for once.''

<HEAD>Study Recommends TB Treatment for AIDS-Infected Addicts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug abusers who are infected with the AIDS virus
and tuberculosis bacteria should be treated with medicine to prevent
full-blown TB, says a study published today.
   Doctors have noticed a growing prevalence of tuberculosis in
recent years among people at high risk of AIDS, especially drug
addicts.
   In the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine,
the TB usually resulted from activation of lingering tuberculosis
infections, not new exposures to the bacteria, in people who also
are infected with the AIDS virus.
   The doctors warned that besides being at risk of getting
tuberculosis themselves, AIDS-infected addicts who carry the TB
bacteria also may pass the germs to people they live with, to health
care workers and other people.
   ``The aggressive identification and treatment of HIV-infected
intravenous drug users with latent tuberculous infection is
therefore of both clinical and public health importance,'' wrote Dr.
Peter A. Selwyn of Montefiore Medical Center in New York.
   People may carry either the AIDS virus or tuberculosis bacteria
for many years without getting sick. While most people with the AIDS
virus eventually go on to get acquired immune deficiency syndrome,
people who carry the tuberculosis bacteria ordinarily have only
about a 10 percent life-long risk of getting TB.
   HIV _ the AIDS viurus _ weakens the body's defenses against
disease. The study suggests that it lowers resistance to the
tuberculosis bacteria, putting people at much higher risk of TB.
   The study was conducted on 520 drug users who were in a methadone
program. When the study began, 42 percent already were infected with
HIV. Twenty-three percent of those with HIV also carried TB bacteria
as did 20 percent of those who were free of the AIDS virus.
   During almost two years of followup, active tuberculosis
developed in eight of the AIDS-infected people, but in none of those
who did not have HIV. Seven of the eight TB cases occurred in people
who were already infected with tuberculosis bacteria before the
study began.
   The doctors noted that 13 people who carried HIV and TB bacteria
were treated with the drug isoniazid, and none of them went on to
get active tuberculosis. However, seven of 36 people with both
infections who did not take the medicine got TB.
   The doctors said that the drug is now administered along with
daily methadone doses at the clinic where the study was conducted.

<HEAD>Report: Mental Health Care Severely Lacking In Cambodian Camps</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT W. TROTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lack of mental health care in the largest
Cambodian refugee camp in Thailand is leading to violence and
depression among its residents, according to a report released today.
   ``Mental health needs are neglected ... and there is a total lack
of capacity in the community to provide for their own members,''
said Dr. Richard Mollica, chairman of the World Federation for
Mental Health and co-author of the report.
   Mollica, the director of the Indochinese Psychiatry Clinic at
Boston's St. Elizabeth's Hospital, said levels of domestic violence
and suicide are escalating.
   The federation filed its report with the United Nations.
   Representatives of the group's Committee on Refugees and Migrants
conducted a field survey from Sept. 26 to Oct. 6, 1988, at a camp
said to be representative of conditions in all refugee camps on the
Thailand-Cambodia border.
   About 300,000 people have lived in the camps since 350,000
Cambodians fled their country during Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge regime.
The camp studied is the largest with about 170,000 people.
   Although medical and educational services at the camp have
improved in recent years, ``cultural norms have broken down to
dangerous levels _ with the ultimate outcome a major disintegration
of the Khmer (Cambodian) culture,'' the report said.
   The report said the residents have been subject to psychiatric
disorders not only because of the refugee flight and subsequent
arrival in the camps, but because of the trauma of the Vietnam War.
Approximately 60,000 people died in the U.S bombing of Cambodia, and
about 1 million were killed during the Khmer Rouge regime from 1975
to 1979.
   The rate of suicide increased last year at the camp, the report
said. More than 90 percent of attempts were by women ages 15 to 30,
usually using an overdose of medication.
   One factor characteristic of the mentally ill is the Tiing Moong,
or ``dummy'' personality, a state of psychological withdrawal
fashioned by refugees from the brutal Pol Pot regime in order to
survive.
   Refugees acted as if they were deaf, dumb, confused or stupid,
since many of those who had behaved intelligently or asked many
questions in Cambodia were usually tortured or executed.
   While originally an act to appear submissive, the mental health
federation found that many Khmer people, especially children, would
maintain this attitude to mask depression.
   ``Unless their problems are adequately addressed, they will
become dysfunctional adults and eventually enormous economic and
social burdens on their future communities,'' the report said.
   The report calls on the Thai government, internal organizations
in the camp, and the United Nations to help deal with the mental
health problem.
   The federation recommended that technical assistance and training
be provided by Khmer mental health professionals and religious
leaders to promote Khmer self-management. But the intervention of
administrators would probably diminish the effectiveness of the
self-help initiatives, the report said.
   Other recommendatons included an all-encompassing mental health
system.
   ``Our ultimate hope is that the environment in the camp will
improve so that the Khmer will be able to make a contribution to
their own society,'' Mollica said, ``now and when they are finally
repatriated.''

<TEXT>
   The launch of Discovery and its five
astronauts has been delayed at least two days until March 11 because
of a crushed electrical part on a main engine, officials said.
   The delay apparently will resolve a conflict that had been
brewing when a classified military launching threatened to bump the
shuttle from its March 9 target date.
   The National Aeronatics and Space Administration said Wednesday
that during a readiness test of Discovery's three main engines, a
control mechanism on engine No. 1 shut down prematurely. The problem
was traced to a crushed solenoid on a valve, but its cause was not
known immediately.
   A replacement part was flown here and installed late Wednesday.
Officials said the installation and checkout of the new unit will
mean a slip of at least two days in the launch.
   Shuttle managers scheduled the start of a two-day flight
readiness review today. It is to end Friday with the selection of a
firm launch date.
   During five days in orbit, Discovery's astronauts are to deploy a
large communications satellite and conduct scientific experiments.
   On Monday, the Air Force informed NASA it had scheduled a
critical military launch next week and that it would not be able to
support a Discovery liftoff until March 11. The space agency relies
heavily on Air Force tracking facilities for a shuttle launch.
   The military mission has launch priority for national security
reasons, but NASA said before the solenoid problem it was ready to
negotiate the launch date with military officials.
   The Air Force launch is believed to involve a satellite to test
sensors for the Strategic Defense Initiative, the Star Wars missile
defense shield. Another mission scheduled soon that also would have
priority over the shuttle is the first firing of a Trident 2
intercontinental range missile from a submerged submarine.

<HEAD>Lawyers Sign Settlement in Little Rock Desegregation Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state has agreed to settle the
largest desegregation case in its history by paying out $118
million, including NAACP attorneys' fees dating back to the landmark
court-ordered integration of 1957.
   The proposed settlement, which ends six years of litigation
involving the state and the three school districts in Pulaski
County, was signed by attorneys for all the parties before U.S.
District Judge Henry Woods on Wednesday.
   ``We knew that we were going to have to pay a sizable amount of
money, and I think all things considered, this is the best possible
deal the state could have gotten,'' state Education Director Ruth
Steele said.
   The Little Rock School District, which is mostly black, had sued
the state and the neighboring, mostly white North Little Rock and
Pulaski County school districts in federal court, alleging the
defendants caused illegal segregation in Little Rock schools.
   Woods found North Little Rock and Pulaski County liable and
ordered the districts merged. But the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, while affirming Woods' liability ruling, said his proposed
countywide consolidation was too severe.
   Instead, the appeals court ordered the boundary line between the
Little Rock and Pulaski County districts redrawn, moving large,
mostly white sections of the city of Little Rock, which were in the
county district, into the city district. North Little Rock was not
affected.
   The appeals court then asked the district judge to consider how
much the state would have to pay for compensatory education programs
in the three districts, including magnet schools in Little Rock.
   The agreement calls for the payment of $59 million to the Little
Rock district, $19.7 million to the Pulaski County district and $2.7
million to the North Little Rock district for compensatory programs.
   Among other payments the state would make is $3.1 million in
attorneys' fees for the Legal Defense Fund of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, for work going
back to 1956 involving the original Little Rock desegregation case
and the 1957 school crisis.
   In 1957, enforcing a landmark Supreme Court decision, President
Eisenhower sent federal troops into Little Rock to protect the
court-ordered rights of nine black students to attend the otherwise
all-white Central High School.
   If Wednesday's agreement is approved by Woods, the state would be
released as a defendant in the case. Final approval is needed from
Woods, all three school boards, the Legislature and the state Board
of Education. No hearing was set.
   The Little Rock School Board quickly became the first public
group to approve the settlement.
   ``The settlement is more than just dollars. It's many concepts
and successful programs that will work when implemented correctly,''
school board President Robin Armstrong said.
   The payments would total $118 million over the next decade, the
most in a desegregation case in the state's history.
   A bill filed in the Legislature Wednesday would add a 5 percent
surcharge on the income taxes of residents of Pulaski County to
defray the desegregation costs.

<TEXT>
   The federal Environmental Protection Agency
intends to monitor South Carolina's ban on hazardous wastes from 32
states and Puerto Rico to determine its effects on the state's own
hazardous waste program.
   Greer Tidwell, the EPA's southeastern administrator, said the
agency is ``concerned'' about the state's action and urged eight
other states in the region to look at cooperative efforts in
handling hazardous waste.
   The EPA can take away any state's authority to handle its own
hazardous waste program. If it is removed, all related permits for
that state would have to be issued by the regional office and
accompanying federal money could be reduced, EPA spokesman Carl
Terry said.
   Terry's comments came as South Carolina began its ban on
hazardous wastes and two of the most affected states _ Florida and
North Carolina _ tried to regain access to the state's privately
owned landfill.
   Ten extra inspectors stood ready at the landfill to turn back
loads from banned states Wednesday, but all of the 25 trucks came
from approved states, state Health Department spokesman Bill Culler
said.
   ``It looks like the word got around and there haven't been a
whole lot of problems,'' Culler said.
   State Department of Health and Environmental Control officials
announced Tuesday that only 17 states plus South Carolina and the
District of Columbia would be allowed to continue disposing
hazardous waste in the state as a result of Gov. Carroll Campbell's
executive order of Jan. 18.
   Campbell announced that South Carolina would prohibit, beginning
Wednesday, the disposal of waste from any state that refused to
dispose of the waste itself. He said it was meant to encourage other
states to locate disposal sites within their own borders rather than
relying on South Carolina.
   In a statement Wednesday, the EPA's Tidwell said the agency
``will monitor the situation closely to determine what effect the
state's action, as a result of that executive order, may or may not
have on its authorized hazardous waste program.''
   The ban affects the GSX Services landfill on the shore of Lake
Marion in Sumter County near Pinewood. The site annually accepts
135,000 tons of hazardous waste, such as solvents, acids and other
chemical garbage. About 70 percent of the waste comes from out of
state.
   The GSX site is one of only two commercial hazardous waste
landfills in the Southeast. The other is in Emelle, Ala.
   The head of Florida's Department of Environmental Regulation,
Dale Twachtmann, has written South Carolina officials asking them to
reconsider the decision, according to Raoul Clarke, a department
administrator.
   ``We do recognize that we generate hazardous wastes and we can't
rely on the other states,'' Clarke said.
   North Carolina Gov. Jim Martin said he also sent Campbell a
letter Wednesday advising him of pending state legislation that
would repeal North Carolina's ban on a hazardous waste landfill
until a hazardous waste treatment plant could be built.
   Martin said he could understand Campbell's irritation with other
states' inaction on hazardous wastes.
   ``Would we have been that tolerant had other states been shipping
their hazardous wastes here?'' Martin asked. ``I doubt it. We
probably would have run out of patience sooner.''

   Police said a man who snatched purses from
two women tried to give them back because his conscience got the
best of him.
   But the women had their doubts.
   So instead, Anthony R. Jackson contacted a bail bondsman, who
told the victims their purses could be picked up at the Oklahoma
City police station, according to authorities. He surrendered a
short time later.
   ``He did call both victims at their homes offering to give them
their property back,'' police Lt. Charles Owen said Wednesday. ``He
told them his conscience was hurting him, but they were both
skeptical of it.''
   Jackson, who told police he snatched the purses Monday, was
booked Wednesday on two complaints of robbery by force and fear.
   Owen said Jackson told police he forged a check belonging to one
of the women and was in the process of forging another when he
decided not to.
   ``That's when he decided to give everything back,'' Owen said.

<TEXT>
   Nine people were sentenced for their roles
in an international cocaine ring that authorities said included
shipments of the drug from Panama on U.S. military planes.
   The sentences, handed down Wednesday, ranged from two years'
probation to 24 years in prison. Seven of the nine people were
sentenced to jail.
   The operation was responsible for bringing 600 pounds of cocaine
into the United States over a 13-month period, according to trial
testimony.
   Oscar Smith of New York City, called by authorities the ``New
York connection'' in the smuggling ring, received the 24-year term.
His wife, Regina Smith, got a 12-year, seven-month sentence.
   Julia Thom, a New York friend of the Smiths, was given three
years for helping Mrs. Smith take a delivery of cocaine from
Moultrie, Ga., to New York.
   Jackie Lee Bigelow, a former serviceman whose arrest in Moultrie
last May set off the investigation, received a five-year term. He
pleaded guilty and testified against some of the defendants in the
federal drug trial last fall.
   John W. Turner III, an Army reserve sergeant from Nashville,
Tenn., also was sentenced to five years.
   Others sentenced by U.S. District Judge J. Robert Elliott were
Gary King, 27, of Doerun, Ga., 15 years, eight months, and a $20,000
fine; Herberto Lynton, a Panamanian citizen who was on duty with the
U.S. Army when he was arrested, 15 years, eight months; Brenda
McGee, of Doerun, two years' probation; and Maxine Williams of
Doerun, also a witness at the trial, two years' probation.
   During the trial, the jury was told that the cocaine-stuffed
duffle bags were usually brought into the country from Panama aboard
military transport planes and carried on to New York by soldiers or
impostors in uniform.
   The uniformed couriers sometimes wrote out their own travel
orders so they could fly at government expense.
   The cocaine was brought into the United States through Dobbins
Air Force Base in Marietta, Ga., and airfields in Texas and South
Carolina, according to testimony.

<HEAD>Report: Romania Sells Western Aid For Hard Currency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romania's embassy declined comment today
on a newspaper report suggesting the East bloc country is secretly
trying to sell off Western shipments of humanitarian food aid for
hard currency.
   Neue Zuercher Zeitung, a conservative Zurich newspaper, reported
it received a letter and copies of documents ``from Romania''
indicating the state foreign trade agency in Bucharest offered ally
North Korea a discounted shipment of 18 staple goods under false
pretenses for payment in U.S. dollars.
   ``The sender accuses Romanian authorities of seizing Western aid
shipments for the starving, freezing population and bartering them
away for hard currency,'' the newspaper said Tuesday in a
correspondent's report from Copenhagen, Denmark. The sender was not
identified.
   An official at the Romanian embassy in Bern said he had not seen
the story and could not comment.
   ``I'm not aware of a problem,'' said the official, who declined
to give his name. ``The embassy concerns itself with other
questions.''
   The newspaper said one document was a fake bill from a Danish
mail order company to the Romanian embassy in Bonn, West Germany,
for an alleged shipment worth about $66,000.
   The fake, dated Dec. 21, listed 18 items including cooking oil,
spaghetti, rice, flour, yeast, sugar, honey, milk powder, butter and
margarine.
   In the second document, dated Jan. 19, the Romanian state foreign
trade company refers to the purported Danish bill and offers the
same goods to North Korea at a 40 percent discount.
   It says a hard currency shortage forced the embassy to resell its
order at a loss, according to the paper.
   The two documents ``raise the suspicion that the Ceausescu regime
is depriving its suffering population of aid shipments from Western
humanitarian organizations and tries to sell them to friendly
foreign countries at deep discounts, but for hard currency,'' Neue
Zuercher Zeitung said.
   President Nicolae Ceausescu's is the most repressive government
in the Soviet bloc and his attempt to rid Romania of foreign debt
has left the country financially strapped. Food and power shortages
are commonplace.

<TEXT>
   A member of a group called the Toilet Rockers
was charged with disorderly conduct for a performance in which he
allegedly cut himself with glass, exposed himself to the crowd and
defecated on stage.
   ``I acted out my lyrics, nothing more, nothing less,'' said Kevin
M. ``G.G.'' Allin, 32, of Midlothian, Ill. ``I'm just showing people
reality is there. It's there on my stage.''
   Allin was charged Wednesday after a performance the night before
at the Odd Rock Cafe.
   ``If people are going to come to our shows, they've got to have a
strong mind and stomach. If people are sensitive, they'll take one
look at me and leave. I'm sure most people hate me,'' he said.
   He described his performance as theater. ``I've done it before,
but I don't do it at every show,'' he said. ``I don't want to be
predictable.
   ``Sometimes I go off. I go over the edge.''
   Allin said scabs on his forehead were from hitting himself with
the microphone, bruises on his face were from beating himself while
the audience of about 50 looked on and bite marks on his arms were
his own doing.
   John M. Baker, the attorney for nightclub owner John Koshick,
said Koshick had no idea Allin was going to perform the acts that
led to the disorderly conduct charges. ``If he would, he never would
have booked him,'' Baker said.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses Mistrial In `Night Stalker' Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge in the ``Night Stalker'' murder case
has refused to call a mistrial despite a defense attorney's
complaints of nervous exhaustion.
   Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan told Daniel Hernandez on
Wednesday that stress is ``part and parcel of a death penalty
case,'' and he ordered the trial to proceed.
   Hernandez represents Richard Ramirez, a 29-year-old drifter from
El Paso charged with 13 slayings and 30 other felonies in a series
of attacks that terrorized California in 1985. The killer was dubbed
the Night Stalker.
   Testimony in the trial began Jan. 30, but the case has been in
recess since Feb. 21 when Hernandez, 44, complained of chest pains
and sent a doctor's letter saying he needed up to six weeks to
recuperate from nervous exhaustion.
   The judge noted a long history of requests for postponements by
Hernandez in Ramirez's nearly 4-year-old case. In at least two
previous criminal cases, the courts fined Hernandez for delaying
cases by not showing up and citing stress.
   Tynan said Hernandez failed to present sufficient medical
evidence that his health was threatened by the trial.
   ``Some of us have chest pains. Some have bellyaches,'' said the
judge, a former public defender. ``One of my friends lost part of
his vision, but it came back. Stress is part and parcel of a death
penalty case.
   ``Some of us deal with it better than others,'' he added. The
judge ordered Hernandez's co-counsel, Arturo Hernandez, who no
relation, to assist in the trial. The second lawyer left the
courtroom in July without explanation.
   Outside court, Hernandez said: ``I'm exhausted. I'm tired.'' He
said he would return to court Monday to represent Ramirez.
   But he added, ``I'm not going to kill myself.''
   At Wednesday's hearing, the lawyer had asked for two weeks off to
start a diet and exercise program.
   ``I'd like a month on the Riviera myself,'' said Deputy District
Attorney P. Philip Halpin. ``But the bottom line is, what are we
going to do?''

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and his
senior advisers met a government team led by Interior Minister Gen.
Czeslaw Kiszczak today in an apparent bid to overcome obstacles
after nearly a month of talks.
   Government spokesman Pawel Byra said the meeting at the secluded
Magdalenka residence in a forest south of the capital, was ``of a
working character. It is no extraordinary meeting.''
   State radio said a communique would be issued after the meeting.
   Walesa smiled at reporters but declined to answer questions as he
left for the meeting. He has over the past few weeks been traveling
the country pleading with people to hold back protests and give the
talks more time to succeed.
   The unprecedented ``round-table'' talks on seeking a way out of
political and economic turmoil began Feb. 6, with the banned
Solidarity free trade union movement seeking first and foremost to
have its legal status restored.
   The government said it is willing to legalize Solidarity if a
broad agreement is reached on economic and political reforms and on
opposition participation in parliament.
   But several sticking points have arisen, including the form of
elections to parliament.
   Solidarity has accepted the principle that a majority of seats
would be reserved for the ruling Communist Party and its allies, but
wants the rest freely contested.
   Another sore point is the banned Independent Students Association.
   Students have become increasingly restive about the fate of the
organization, known by the Polish initials NZS, especially after
signs that Solidarity and the farmers' Rural Solidarity would be
legalized.
   Communist authorities apparently regard the Independent Students
Association as more of a threat, but Walesa has defended the
organization.
   ``No table can stand on less than three legs. And those three
legs are: Solidarity of workers, NZS and Rural Solidarity,'' he has
said.
   The Independent Students Association was banned along with
Solidarity and other independent groups after the Dec. 13, 1981,
martial-law crackdown.
   The government and opposition also remain far apart on creating a
state presidency that would help guarantee continuation of a
communist system in Poland, on the degree of opposition's access to
the mass media and on the framework for an economic reform program.
   The meetings have occurred as economic unrest continues over
workers' declining wages, high inflation and the $39 billion foreign
debt.
   Walesa was accompanied to the meeting by a platoon of advisers
including historian Bronislaw Geremek, journalist Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, union organizers Zbigniew Bujak and Wladyslaw Frasyniuk,
Roman Catholic church spokesman the Rev. Alojzy Orszulik and Gdansk
bishop Tadeusz Goclowski.

<HEAD>Survivors Of Deceased Veterans Receive First Agent Orange Checks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first of thousands of payments from the $170
million Agent Orange settlement fund have been mailed to the
families of deceased Vietnam veterans who were exposed to the
defoliant in Southeast Asia.
   The 172 checks sent out Wednesday, totaling about $500,000, were
approved by U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein, who oversees the
Agent Orange litigation. The payments averaged about $3,000.
   The payments to survivor families come from a fund that also will
provide money to disabled veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange.
Those payments begin going out at the end of the month.
   About 75,000 applications for payments have been sent out by the
Aetna Life Insurance Co., the fund administrator.
   Families getting checks from Wednesday's mailing may get an
additional check later, afer the total number of eligible applicants
is known and the final distribution of the fund is calculated.
   The money stems from the settlement in 1984 of a class-action
suit against seven manufacturers of Agent Orange, an herbicide
sprayed in Southeast Asia during the 1960s by the U.S. military to
deprive opposing troops of crops and cover.
   Many veterans claimed that exposure to the chemical caused
cancer, birth defects in their children and other illnesses.
   Although the settlement was reached in 1984, payments were not
made until now because of legal challenges and a complex
distribution plan.
   The deadline to request applications for veterans currently
eligible was Wednesday. Veterans who are not disabled now, but
become disabled in the next few years because of illnesses linked to
Agent Orange, can file claims through 1994.
   To be eligible for payment, veterans must be considered totally
disabled under Social Security guidelines.

<HEAD>Ban On Jailhouse Smoking Has Inmates Fuming</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One year after smoking was outlawed in
the Josephine County Jail, the inmates are fuming, but the jailers
are smiling.
   Jail Commander Mark Dickson said inmates are fighting less and
are much healthier since cigarettes _ jailhouse currency for
generations _ were taken away.
   ``In fact, I have had far more inmates come up to me since this
was issued and thank us for the policy, because it forced them to
quit smoking,'' Dickson said Tuesday.
   Inmate Ron Wise wasn't one of them.
   ``It's unconstitutional deprivation, in my way of thinking,'' he
said. ``The sheriff has taken it upon himself to decide what's good
for us.''
   Dickson said the jail was the first in Oregon to outlaw tobacco,
but others have followed suit. He estimated 95 percent of the
inmates smoked when they entered jail.
   Inmates found smuggling in tobacco aren't punished; the goods are
merely confiscated, Dickson said.
   Blackened electrical outlets are evidence that some cigarettes
are getting in. Inmates who can find something to smoke but don't
have matches put a paper clip in the outlet, then draw a spark with
another paper clip, Dickson said.
   One inmate was so desparate for a smoke he rolled herbal tea in
toilet paper and lit up, the commander said.
   With cigarettes out of the way, the jail is cutting back on
caffeine. Coffee with caffeine is no longer available at lunch and
will soon be gone from the dinner table.
   ``I think we have an obligation to maintain the healthiest
environment possible,'' Dickson said.

<TEXT>
   Some of the Miami area's biggest employers are
making the fight against drugs their business.
   Fifty-five corporations and public employers accounting for 16
percent of metropolitan Miami's work force have joined in a campaign
to administer urine tests to job applicants and to current workers
suspected of drug use.
   ``This campaign will tell those entering the work force that if
you use illegal drugs, don't bother applying for a job here,'' Ted
Hoepner, chairman of SunBank-Miami, said Wednesday. ``At the same
time, it offers help to those who may have a problem.''
   Business Against Drugs could be the biggest program of its kind
in the country, Hoepner said. The companies involved represent
137,000 employees.
   The program, sponsored by the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce,
calls for drug screening as a prerequisite for employment, testing
of employees suspected of drug use and assistance to workers found
to have substance-abuse problems.
   Workers who fail to respond to the assistance programs would face
probable loss of their jobs, Hoepner said.
   Among the employers involved are Burger King Corp. Knight-Ridder
Inc., the University of Miami and Dade County Public Schools.
   Charter members of the chamber can take part in an employee
assistance plan for $18.50 per worker annually and receive a reduced
group rate for the urine tests.
   ``The most effective means of controlling something bad is a
forceful move, something that will create fear in the person,'' said
Dade County Medical Examiner Dr. Joe Davis.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A late-winter storm brought heavy snow to the Pacific Northwest
early this morning, and rain and thunderstorms were scattered across
much of the South.
   Up to half a foot of snow fell Wednesday evening in the Seattle
area, closing the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, canceling
school today and snarling traffic. At least one traffic fatality was
blamed on the storm.
   ``Right now we have a half-inch of slush over ice in some areas
and up to an inch or more of snow over ice, no braking at all,''
said Rick Smith, airport fire chief. ``We're continuing to plow the
runways and working to try and get them cleared.''
   The airport remained closed near daybreak today, but officials
hoped to open it later in the day.
   Seattle and Tacoma public schools closed.
   It was the second severe snowstorm of the season for western
Washington and Oregon, where any snow is noteworthy and even a few
inches can paralyze urban traffic.
   ``It's not supposed to do this anymore,'' said Susan Thornton,
spokeswoman for the Snohomish County Public Works Department in
Everett.
   The snow also reduced visibility and hampered traffic in northern
Oregon, where up to a foot was expected to fall.
   Winter storm warnings were in effect for much of Idaho, Oregon,
northwest Washington and higher elevations of central and northern
California and west central Nevada. Snow advisories were posted for
the remainder of Washington, north central Oregon and the Idaho
Panhandle.
   Snow also was falling across the country's northern tier from the
Pacific Northwest to the Great Lakes, but accumulations outside of
Oregon and Washington were mostly no more than an inch.
   Rain fell in much of California, southern Oregon and southwest
Idaho.
   Thunderstorms continued across the Florida Peninsula while rain
stretched from South Carolina to northern Florida, across the
central Gulf Coast and eastern Texas.
   Today's forecast called for snow in the upper Great Lakes,
central Minnesota, Iowa, South Dakota, northern Wyoming, Montana,
northern Idaho and western Washington. Rain was expected in the rest
of the Pacific Northwest, Nevada and all but southeast California.
Rain and thunderstorms were predicted for much of the South from
southern portions of Virginia and West Virginia to much of Florida,
and across to the lower Mississippi Valley and eastern Texas.
   Highs were forecast to be in the single digits from Montana to
Minnesota; in the teens and 20s from the northern Rockies across the
remainder of the northern Plains and upper Mississippi Valley to the
Great Lakes, northern New York state and northern New England; the
30s and 40s from central New England to North Carolina, the Ohio
Valley, Missouri, northern Kansas, southern Wyoming and the Pacific
Northwest; the 50s and 60s from South Carolina to northern Florida,
the Tennessee Valley, the southern Plains, southern Rockies,
southern Plateau and all but southeast California; and the 80s in
central and southern Florida and the lower Texas Gulf Coast. Highs
elsewhere were expected to be in the 70s.
   Temperatures at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 24 degrees below zero at
Hibbing, Minn., to 74 degrees at Key West, Fla.
   Other reports:
   _East: Atlanta 44 cloudy; Boston 24 windy; Buffalo 13 partly

   South Korea's first lady today sent
money to a grief-stricken family whose four girls took rat poison so
their parents would have enough money to send their brother to
school.
   The girls, aged 6 to 13, were found unconscious Monday. The
youngest girl died immediately. Police said the others were in
critical condition today.
   Korean newspapers gave the story prominent display, and
editorials on the children's plight criticized public policies that
some said do too little for the young or the poor. Editorials also
blamed a male-dominated social structure that often leads to
discrimination against girls and women.
   ``The sad story touched the man in the street,'' wrote the Korea
Times.
   Police said the eldest of the four girls, Soon-mi, told
authorities the children made a suicide pact to ease their parent's
financial burden and leave enough money for the education of their
3-year-old brother.
   Money for schooling has traditionally been provided first to boys.
   The father, Yang Tae-bun, 44, is a factory worker who supports
the family on the equivalent of $362 a month, police said.
   The story led to an outpouring of sympathy led by first lady Kim
Ok-sook, wife of President Roh Tae-woo. She sent the family
condolences and an undisclosed amount of money, officials said.
   Opposition politician Kim Dae-jung visited the girls' parents at
the hospital. ``I am grief-stricken. I feel a great burden as a
politician and I will focus on ways to promote the livelilhood of
alienated people,'' he said.
   Kim Jong-pil, head of the New Democratic Republican Party
attributed the suicide attempt to the faults of politicians ``who
have failed to hammer out appropriate steps for a balanced income
distribution.''
   Seoul newspapers quoted the girls' teachers as saying they
studied hard and were quiet, model students.
   A neighborhood shopkeeper said Soon-mi told him she could not
afford $5.80 worth of notebooks and pencils for school and asked to
pay later.
   The Korea Times quoted a composition written by Soon-mi that said:
   ``On Christmas Eve, they rang the bell _ the helping neighbor
campaign. I searched my pocket and found a 500 won coin (worth 74
cents). I was supposed to buy school things with this money. But I
put it into the charity pot, hoping that the money would be used for
helping the needy.''

<HEAD>Government Rejects Invitation to Speak to Iranian Officials</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with British government turning down proposal
for talks, developments from Iran. No pickup.</HEAD>

   The government today rejected an Iranian proposal
to discuss the controversy over ``The Satanic Verses,'' saying there
is nothing to talk about until Iran renounces violence.
   News reports said a television newsman was being guarded after
threats from an anonymous caller who accused him of insulting
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   An Iranian newspaper called for a worldwide ``day of disgust'' so
Moslems can demonstrate their ``hatred against the enemies of
Islam.''
   An Arab writer who last year won the Nobel Prize for literature
urged Moslem countries to condemn Khomeini's death sentence against
author Salman Rushdie but also proposed publishers of ``The Satanic
Verses'' be boycotted.
   The Soviet news agency Tass suggested Khomeini may have had no
choice under the law of Islam but to denounce Rushdie.
   A spokesman for Britain's Foreign Office said there were
telephone calls ``at an official level'' Wednesday and again today
proposing a meeting in Geneva.
   The Foreign Office did not identify its Iranian contact, but BBC
television said it understood the contact was Mohammad Mehdi Akhoond
Zadeh Basti, who until this week was Iran's top-ranking diplomat in
London.
   ``We saw no merit to a meeting at this stage,'' said the Foreign
Office spokesman, who demanded anonymity. ``The first step must be
for Iran to renounce violence.''
   Khomeini sentenced Rushdie to death Feb. 14 for his novel, which
some say insults Islam. Rushdie, a Briton who was born into a Moslem
family in India, apologized for distress the book caused, but
Khomeini rejected the apology.
   Iranian leaders have offered a $5.2 million bounty for Rushdie,
who since Feb. 14 has been in hiding and reportedly under police
guard.
   News reports said Channel Four newsman Peter Sissons was also
under guard after a man claiming to represent a pro-Iranian group,
Guardians of the Islamic Revolution, threatened him.
   The anonymous caller telephoned news agencies in London last week
claiming Sissons insulted Khomeini in a program Friday. ``Peter
Sissons of Channel Four will pay the price of insulting the Imam
Khomeini,'' the caller said.
   During the program, Sissons interviewed Basti and asked, ``Do you
understand that we don't regard it as civilized to kill people for
their opinions? Do you understand that people in this country fought
a world war to protect themselves and others from being murdered for
their beliefs?''
   More than a dozen European countries have recalled ambassadors
from Tehran in response to Khomeini's threat, and some, including
West Germany, have cut back on their commercial dealings with Iran.
   Tass suggested such treatment was too harsh.
   ``Any acts of violence or calls for it, obviously, arouse
indignation. At the same time, one cannot fail to notice that the
world press has been presenting the conflict in black and white
terms, as Iran having thrown down a gauntlet to the West,''
Wednesday's commentary said.
   ``But perhaps Imam Khomeini, the supreme religious authority in
Iran, had no choice proceeding from Koran teachings, other than
denouncing a man who has insulted Islam?''
   Last week, Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze met with Khomeini
in Tehran in a bid to improve relations with Iran. In addition, the
Soviet Union has a large population of Moslems.
   The Iranian newspaper Jomhuri Islam today said it is important
that Moslems keep the initiative in the dispute over ``The Satanic
Verses.'' It described Khomeini's death order has a ``a brave and
timely blow'' that had disturbed the balance of the West.
   In Cairo, Nobel laureate Naguib Mahfouz said he believed Khomeini
had harmed Islam and Moslems with the death order.
   But he also said he supports boycott or confiscation of the book
``for the sake of social peace and on condition this not be used as
a pretext to suppress thought.'' His commentary appeared in the
state-owned newspaper Al-Ahram.
   In another development, Switzerland's Ringier media concern said
it gave three months' notice to Ahmed Huber, a well-known Swiss
journalist and convert to Islam. The Berner Zeitung newspaper on
Feb. 17 quoted Huber as saying he supports the death ``sentence''
for Rushdie ``because there can be no other punishment for this
blasphemy based on selfishness and profiteering.''
   Huber made similar statements in a television interview.

   The Soviet Union has formed another
commission to determine whether thousands of bodies found in a mass
grave outside this Ukrainian village were killed by the Nazis or
Josef Stalin's secret police.
   Three previous Soviet investigations have blamed German forces
who occupied the area from 1941-43, but elderly residents of this
village near Kiev recently broke 50 years of silence on the matter.
They blamed their government for the bodies _ up to 300,000 by one
unofficial estimate _ buried in the forest.
   One witness, Petro Z. Kukovenko, says he summoned the courage to
speak after a Soviet commission reburied the bones and erected a
memorial in May blaming the Nazis for the killing.
   ``When they put up this monument, I became ashamed that they were
blaming this on the wrong people,'' said Kukovenko, 74.
   ``My father may be buried there,'' said Kukovenko's wife, Halyna.
``My father was a collective farmer, and they killed him for
nothing,'' she sobbed.
   Western historians estimate 20 million Soviets were killed under
Stalin, particularly during the Great Purge of the late 1930s.
   But it was only in 1987 the Soviet government, as part of the
reforms instituted under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, began to
admit that Stalin was responsible for even thousands of deaths.
   Mikola G. Lysenko, a retired economist, is crusading to end what
he considers a conspiracy of lies. In December, he succeeded in
forcing the government to form a fourth commission to find the
murderers.
   Lysenko said that 50 villagers say the bodies were killed before
the German occupation.
   All four commissions have involved officials with connections to
the secret police, Lysenko said.
   Kukovenko lived through that terrible time from 1936 to 1941,
when canvas-covered trucks hauled their mysterious cargo to the
green-fenced compound in the Darnitsia Forest.
   He first saw the horror when a German officer forced him and four
other men to exhume one of the graves just four days after Nazi
troops occupied the area in September 1941.
   ``I know that this pit we dug up was a fresh grave _ maybe the
people had been buried there a week earlier,'' just before the Red
Army retreated, Kukovenko said. Since that time, further excavation
has found the remains of thousands of Soviets in the pits, stacked
like canned sardines.
   Government estimates range from 6,000 to 68,000 bodies, but
Lysenko said there are five to eight victims in every two square
yards of the 80,000-square-yard site. That amounts to 200,000 to
300,000 people.
   The first government investigation of Bykovnia was conducted by a
war crimes commission in 1944, Lysenko said. ``Stalin was alive
then, and any talk that these were crimes of Stalin's men was out of
the question,'' he said.
   In 1971, a second government commission was named to investgate
the deaths, but Kukovenko said he was ``afraid to go there and tell
them.''
   Lysenko discovered Bykovnia in May 1987. By autumn, he had
gathered 10 witnesses to the massacre. With support from the
Ukrainian Writers Union, he wrote to the city of Kiev and the
Communist Party. Within days, a third commission was formed.
   ``The KGB went to the witnesses I mentioned in my letter. People
became afraid and said, `No, I didn't see it,''' Lysenko says.
   On May 6, 1988, the government erected a monument to 6,329
Soviets ``killed by the Fascist occupiers in 1941-43.''
   ``I thought, did I make a mistake?'' said Lysenko. ``So I went
back, and found 20 other people, and they all said it happened
before the war.''
   In December, he took witnesses to testify before the writers
union. The next day, the fourth commission was formed.
   But Col. Gen. Ivan Hladush, the Ukrainian Minister of Interior,
is still the chairman. Oles Shevchenko, head of the Helsinki Watch
group in the Ukraine, believes Hladush has covered up the crimes of
his predecessors.
   Attempts to reach the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs were
unsuccessful.
   Kukovenko says he's offended by constant references to the
``myth'' that Stalin's secret police killed the victims at Bykovnia.
   ``Am I a myth? Are my friends a myth?'' he asks.

   A moderate offshore
earthquake shook parts of the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico
today, geologists reported. There were no reports of damages or
injuries.
   The U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., recorded the quake
at 5.5 on the Richter scale, spokeswoman Pat Jorgenson reported from
Washington.
   The quake, which was centered 80 miles southeast of Santo
Domingo, occurred at 3:14 a.m. (2:14 a.m. EST), she said.
   Light tremors were felt in Santo Domingo and at the resort town
of La Romana, 80 miles to the east.
   The Civil Defense said as of midmorning there were no reports of
damages or injuries in the Dominican Republic.
   William McCann, director of the University of Puerto Rico's
Seismic Network, said there was some movement felt on Puerto Rico's
west coast.
   ``We don't expect damage due to the depth of the temblor,''
McCann said.
   The Puerto Rico Geophysical Observatory estimated the epicenter
was 80 miles below the surface of the Caribbean.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A magnitude 5 quake can cause considerable damage. A
magnitude 6 quake can cause severe damage.

<HEAD>Staggered United and American Flights Take Effect At O'Hare</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two busiest airlines at O'Hare International
Airport began an experiment today in staggering their flight
arrivals in hopes of reducing delays and congestion at the nation's
busiest airfield.
   The Federal Aviation Administration had prodded United Airlines,
which runs the most flights out of O'Hare, and American Airlines,
into working out a solution.
   Under the agreement, neither airline will schedule more than
three arrivals during a two-minute period, and more than seven
arrivals in a five-minute period, said United spokeswoman Sara
Dornacker.
   Ms. Dornacker said she did not know how many flights had
previously been crammed into those time periods.
   In most cases, schedule changes of five minutes or less are
involved in the experiment.
   United will still have 396 arrivals and departures daily at
O'Hare; 240 United flights will be affected by the agreement,
Dornacker said.
   Nearly 37 percent of United arrivals at O'Hare were delayed in
December, the latest month for which figures were available, said
Dornacker.
   Figures from American were not immediately available. American
officials did not return telephone calls.
   The agreement, worked out in December as a two-year experiment,
also forbids either airline from increasing daily arrivals between
7:15 a.m and 10:44 a.m. and between 4:15 p.m. and 8:44 p.m, the
United spokeswoman said.
   ``The purpose of these actions is to reduce the delays now
occuring at O'Hare,'' she said. ``It's one step in a program and we
feel as a company that more work is needed to solve the Chicago
area's congestion problem.''

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four of the five original members of the
Jefferson Airplane are reuniting 17 years after it disbanded, a
publicist says.
   Grace Slick, Paul Kantner, Jorma Kaukonen and Jack Casady are
``in the process of signing a major record contract,'' said Mitchell
Schneider.
   Marty Balin, who left the band after the ``Volunteers'' album was
released in 1969, is not part of the agreement, according to a
statement. But, it added, ``No doors are closed.''
   The Jefferson Airplane was formed by Balin and Kantner, who added
Slick as the vocalist after original lead singer Signe Anderson left
because of pregnancy. The group's second album, ``Surrealistic
Pillow,'' was the first to feature Slick.
   She brought with her two songs from her former band _ ``White
Rabbit'' and ``Somebody To Love'' _ that became the quintessential
Haight-Ashbury sound during San Francisco's Summer of Love in 1967.
   Other albums included ``After Bathing At Baxter's,'' ``Crown of
Creation,'' ``Bless Its Pointed Little Head,'' ``Volunteers,''
``Bark'' and ``Long John Silver.''
   In the early 1970s, Kaukonen and Casady formed the acoustic blues
band Hot Tuna, a side job that eventually removed them from the
Airplane. Slick and Kantner did several projects together and in
1974 formed Jefferson Starship.
   ``It was loose, it wasn't planned,'' Slick said about the
reformation. She said Kantner recently had been doing some shows
with Hot Tuna, and she was asked to sing a few songs at the Fillmore
in San Francisco.
   ``The reaction was more striking than we planned. So we thought
we'd make a record,'' she said. The band will begin recording an
album of new material in the coming weeks, produced by Ron Nevison.
   Kantner's departure from the Jefferson Starship in 1984 led to a
bitter legal battle with Slick over money and the band's name. A
settlement in 1987 gave the band the right to use only the latter
part of the name, Starship, and gave Kantner $250,000.
   Kantner and Slick once lived together and the two have a daughter.

   Immigration agents will not single out
Hispanic-looking people to see if they are illegal aliens, under a
settlement reached in federal court.
   The settlement Tuesday ended part of a lawsuit brought by
Hispanics who accused agents of routinely stopping them on the basis
of their appearance.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service also agreed to make
payments of $1,000 to about $3,000 to six people who were stopped by
agents. The largest amount will go to Robert Mireles of Eau Claire,
who was stopped three times.
   In settling the suit, the government admitted no wrongdoing, said
Edwin W. Earl, chief patrol agent for the INS in Michigan.
   The settlement applies only to the federal court district
covering the western half of Michigan's Lower Peninsula and all of
the Upper Peninsula.
   The class-action suit filed in 1981 alleged that immigration
workers unfairly targeted the 50,000 to 100,000 Hispanics in
southwestern Michigan with traffic stops, interrogations, handcuffs
and nighttime household searches.
   ``You're driving to the store or to get a haircut and you're
stopped by marked cars,'' said Philip Riley, an attorney the
plaintiffs. ``For migrant workers, it's embarrassing.''
   Many of the migrant workers stopped were residents of California
and Texas who were in the state for seasonal work, Riley said.
   U.S. District Judge Richard Enslen said the INS appeared to be
violating a constitutional ban on unlawful search and seizure.
   Earl said today that the government promised not to stop cars of
suspected aliens based on appearance alone, ``but that was never
done anyway. We always have other reasons for stopping vehicles that
we stop.'' He declined to be specific.
   The government agreed to a settlement to prevent the suit from
dragging out and to save the cost of defending it, he said.
   The settlement requires the INS to keep detailed written records
of any traffic stops. Earl said INS agents would begin doing that
across Michigan, but he didn't know if it would be done in other
states.
   The agreement bars border agents from stopping vehicles
containing people of Hispanic origin or appearance at places other
than border checkpoints, or more than 25 miles from the border,
without a search warrant or without reason to suspect that a person
in the vehicle is an illegal alien.
   Another part of the suit, in which several plaintiffs allege they
were roused from their beds and illegally searched at migrant camps,
may go to trial in July when the plaintiffs return to Michigan to
work.

   An Israeli soldier fatally shot a Palestinian
man who tried to stab another soldier with a knife during house
searches in the occupied Gaza Strip, the army spokesman said today.
   A Palestinian teen-ager was shot and wounded in the leg during a
clash with troops in the seaside strip today, Arab news reports said.
   An Israeli officer, Uri Peles, 26, was injured in the cheek
Wednesday night by a rock thrown by Palestinians as he drove through
Gaza, the army said.
   Soldiers maintained a curfew on the occupied West Bank city of
Nablus, confining nearly all its 120,000 residents indoors for a
seventh straight day.
   The restrictions were imposed Friday after a soldier was killed
by a cement block dropped on his head from a third-story window in
Nablus' marketplace.
   Also today, Israeli paratroopers shot and killed four Palestinian
guerrillas in southern Lebanon who were en route to attack targets
in Israel, the army said. The clash occurred about three miles north
of the Israeli-Lebanese border in the western sector of Israel's
self-proclaimed security zone, said an army source, who cannot be
identified under military regulations.
   Marwan Hussein Khawaz, 24, of Tufah in Gaza, shot Wednesday
night, was the 388th Palestinian to die in the 15-month uprising.
Seventeen Israelis, including six soldiers, have also died in the
unrest.
   The army said Khawaz was shot by a soldier ``after he was
identified as trying to attack a soldier with a knife.'' The
incident occurred while troops arrested people in Tufah, the army
said. It said the soldier was not hurt.
   Tufah was also placed under curfew after the shooting, the army
said.
   Troops today opened fire on stone-throwing protesters in Gaza
City's Rimalt quarter, injuring a 17-year-old Palestinian, Arab
reports said.
   The Israeli officer injured by rock-throwing Palestinians in Khan
Yunis was identified by Maariv daily identified as Uri Peles, 26.

   A threatened strike by Eastern Airlines' Machinists
this weekend has sent travelers scrambling for other carriers, and
Eastern warned a sympathy walkout by pilots could bury the company
``in the corporate graveyard.''
   Ticket agents reported a surge in sales at Eastern competitors as
a strike appeared increasingly likely at the Miami-based airline,
which carries an average of 100,000 passengers a day and says it is
losing $1 million daily.
   Eastern wants to cut salaries to save $150 million. The
Machinists union, representing 8,500 Eastern baggage handlers and
other ground services workers, wants $50 million in salary increases.
   Company Chairman Frank Lorenzo, in a videotape sent Wednesday to
the pilots union, warned that ``if the pilots and other employees
support the (machinists') picket line and don't show up for work,
Eastern cannot survive.''
   ``I'm afraid Eastern is going to go through this juncture and
perhaps end up in the corporate graveyard,'' said Lorenzo, the
chairman of Texas Air, Eastern's parent company.
   Eastern's rivals also have been mapping strategy to keep
operating in the event of a secondary boycott by the Machinists
union, which has asked a federal court judge in Washington to allow
its members to picket other airlines, ships and other modes of
transportation.
   While most airlines aren't commenting on contingency plans in the
event of an industry-wide strike, some of Eastern's fiercest
competitors are moving to cash in on the passenger spillover.
   Pan American Corp., which vies with Eastern in the lucrative East
Coast shuttle routes, already has said it would double its flights
linking New York to Boston and Washington during a strike.
   And Delta said it can handle Eastern's surplus to Florida and
Puerto Rico without putting more planes in the air.
   Non-union Continental Airlines, also owned by Texas Air, has
downplayed the effect of a strike at Eastern despite vows by
Machinists union members to close it down as well.
   ``We are two totally separate carriers,'' said Continental
spokesman Ned Walker in Houston. ``We do not expect any impact at
Continental from the Eastern situation. ... There will be no service
disruption whatsoever.''
   Eastern says it is doomed unless its pilots continue flying
during a strike, set to begin at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday unless an
agreement is reached in the machinists' 17-month-old contract
dispute.
   Lorenzo's videotaped message offered pilots sweeter pay raises
and job security, but leaders of the pilots and flight attendants
unions have urged members to honor picket lines.
   Lorenzo, who bought Eastern in 1986, earned a union-busting
reputation when he broke labor contracts with Continental's workers
after taking that airline into bankruptcy reorganization in 1983.
   The 3,500-member pilots union said the new offer does not
guarantee job security, contains $64 million in pilot concessions
and would require the union to drop lawsuits and grievances worth
$250 million.
   ``In his videotape, Mr. Lorenzo made a fine theatrical
performance,'' the pilots executive council said in a statement to
its members. ``Don't be misled. Much work still needs to be done.''
   The Machinists also appealed for solidarity in the days before
the strike.
   ``We would hope the pilots would remember that Lorenzo has made
agreements before and contracts mean nothing to him. He's not to be
trusted,'' said Frank Ortis, vice president of the Machinists Miami
local.
   The White House, meanwhile, is giving no hint of whether
President Bush will meet the request of federal mediators and stop a
strike. White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush will
make his decision on whether to step in before the midnight Friday
deadline.
   As to a proposal to stop the strike for 60 days, ``No decision
has been made,'' Fitzwater said today.
   Eastern ran full-page advertisements in some newspapers today,
quoting editorials across the country that urge Bush not to call in
federal mediators.
   Eastern has promised passengers full refunds or seats on other
airlines at no extra cost if flights are canceled, but several
competitors remain wary of accepting tickets a bankrupt Eastern
might not be able to pay for.

<TEXT>
   An egg laid in captivity by an endangered
California condor last week is probably infertile, the San Diego
Wild Animal Park says.
   The egg was examined Wednesday under a high-intensity lamp by the
park's lead condor keeper, Don Sterner, said park spokesman Tom
Hanscom.
   ``He will leave the egg in the incubator for two more days in the
off-chance that it is simply slow to develop,'' Hanscom said, ``but
at this point we don't believe the egg to be fertile.''
   The egg was among three laid at two Southern California zoos
since Feb. 20 in a program to save the endangered species. One of
the eggs was previously declared infertile; a second egg is expected
to hatch between April 17 and 21.
   All 28 of the California condors known to be alive are in
captivity, half at the Los Angeles Zoo and half at the San Diego
park.
   Scientists hope to breed enough of the condors, North America's
largest land birds, to reintroduce the vulture-like species to the
wild.
   The fertile egg was produced by the same breeding couple that
gave birth last April to the first condor conceived and hatched in
captivity, Molloko.

<HEAD>Denver Zoo Gorilla Undergoes Hernia Surgery</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Surgeons put a 20-year-old female gorilla under the
knife to repair a grapefruit-sized hernia that could have been life
threatening.
   ``It went better than anybody could have hoped for,'' zoo
veterinarian Richard Cambre said after the two-hour operation
Wednesday. ``Surgeons are confident this will heal well, and she
won't have any recurrence of the hernia.''
   A team of doctors led by veterinary surgeon Robert Taylor
performed the operation on the anesthetized, 214-pound lowland
gorilla, Bibi. Surgeons stitched Goretex _ the material that keeps
skiers warm _ around the herniated area.
   ``The Goretex will act as a latticework for new fibrous tissue to
grow through and will give a lot of strength to the area,'' Cambre
said.
   By early Wednesday afternoon, Bibi was awake and hungry, but it
will be a month before the animal gets to rejoin her fellow
gorillas; veterinarians don't want to take the chance that some
rough gorilla-play will rip out her stitches.
   The hernia was discovered during an operation for colon disease
in 1986. Doctors removed part of the gorilla's intestines at the
time but feared the risk of infection was too high to repair the
hernia.

   Israeli paratroopers patrolling southern Lebanon
shot and killed four Palestinian guerrillas today who were en route
to attack targets in Israel, the army said.
   A fifth guerrilla escaped, and troops were searching the area,
said a military source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   No Israeli troops were injured, an army spokesman said.
   The clash occurred about three miles north of the
Israeli-Lebanese border in the western sector of Israel's
self-proclaimed security zone, said the spokesman, who cannot be
identified under military regulations.
   ``This was definitely an infiltration attempt,'' he said.
   The spokesman said documents found on the bodies of the
guerrillas identified them as members of the Democratic Front for
the Liberation of Palestine, a radical Marxist faction of the PLO.
   A security source in Lebanon said the clash occurred in the
Israeli-controlled security zone near the Lebanese village of Al
Jibbayn.
   It was the second infiltration attempt attributed to the
Democratic Front since Feb. 23, when Israeli soldiers killed three
Palestinian guerrillas in the six to 10-mile-wide buffer zone.
Israel created the security zone in 1985 when it pulled the bulk of
its forces out of Lebanon after a three-year occupation.
   Israel radio said the guerrillas killed today were armed with
Soviet-made Kalashnikov assault guns, grenades and missiles.
   Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled, head of the army's Northern Command, said
leaflets were also found in the possession of the guerrillas.
   ``The leaflet speaks of carrying out a hostage-taking mission in
Israel,'' Peled said on Israel radio. ``It speaks of military action
to support the political activities of the PLO leadership.''
   Earlier today, the Foreign Ministry gave reporters photocopies of
two Democratic Front identification cards it said belonged to two of
the three guerrillas killed Feb. 23. A ministry spokesman, who is by
tradition not identified, noted that the Democratic Front is a full
member of the PLO.
   Israel has tried to persuade the United States to end a dialogue
it began with the PLO after its chief, Yasser Arafat, said in
December that he recognized Israel's right to exist and renounced
terrorism.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who maintains the PLO will never
give up terrorism, said in an interview published Wednesday that the
U.S. talks with the PLO are ``useless.''
   On Tuesday, U.S. officials met with PLO representatives in Tunis,
where the organization has its headquarters, and asked them to put
an end to all attempts by its guerrillas to infiltrate Israel.
   But the State Department also criticized an Israeli retaliatory
air raid on Tuesday against a Democratic Front post in Lebanon
southeast of Beirut.
   On Wednesday, a State Department spokesman, Charles Redman, said
the U.S. talks with the PLO will continue despite Israel's pleas.

<TEXT>
   Seventy-five Vietnamese who fled their communist
homeland in search of a better life returned to Vietnam in a
chartered jet today in the first large-scale repatriation of boat
people.
   The boat people were among about 11,000 Vietnamese who have
sailed into this British colony since it adopted a tough new policy
last year that for most of them rules out resettlement.
   Many of the boat people waved and smiled as they boarded the Hong
Kong Dragon Airlines' Boeing 737 jet, but some appeared
apprehensive. A few carried cassette tape recorders; others were
empty-handed.
   The 46 men, 19 women and 10 children were accompanied by two U.N.
officials and an interpreter on the 2{-hour flight to Hanoi.
   When they touched down in Hanoi, they were met by Vietnamese,
U.N. and British officials, Hong Kong radio reported.
   The boat people were to be briefed and taken to a transit camp
about six miles from Hanoi airport, the radio said.
   ``This is an important start,'' Security Branch official Michael
Hanson told reporters in Hong Kong.
   The Hong Kong government hopes the successful repatriation of the
first group will convince other boat people to return home from the
colony's crowded camps, now bulging with nearly 26,000 Vietnamese.
   The repatriation was arranged under an agreement reached by
Vietnam and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Hanoi promised
not to prosecute its returning citizens and to allow the
international organization to monitor their treatment back home.
   The UNHCR agreed to provide assistance to the repatriated
Vietnamese. Returning adults received $50 and their children $25,
according to U.N. officials, and other unspecified assistance will
be offered.
   The U.N. agency, which has offices in Vietnam, has vowed to
closely monitor the fate of boat people who return home.
   ``I would tend to say if too many of them get into trouble, it
will be known,'' Alexander Casella, one of the two U.N. officials on
the flight, said Wednesday. He was expected to remain in Vietnam one
week and accompany the boat people to home villages after their
brief stay in Hanoi.
   Vietnamese have sailed by the tens of thousands to ports of
asylum in non-Communist southeast Asia since the Vietnam War ended
in 1975, but only a handful had previously asked to go back.
   This British colony, about 500 miles north of Vietnam, long
classified all arriving Vietnamese as refugees who could stay in the
colony until resettled elsewhere. Less than two dozen of the more
than 120,000 Vietnamese who have come to Hong Kong returned home
between 1979 and 1988.
   But to stem the growing influx of boat people, the colony adopted
a new policy effective last June under which Vietnamese are
considered refugees only if they can prove they fled their homeland
because of persecution.
   The vast majority do not meet that standard under a government
screening program and are classified as illegal immigrants. Hong
Kong wants to forcibly send them home, but Hanoi insists it will
only accept those who want to return.
   Vietnam originally approved repatriation applications from 145
boat people in Hong Kong, but when Hanoi officials arrived in the
colony to issue travel documents last month only 81 still wanted to
go home.
   Six backed out at the last minute.
   Despite the harsh new policy, boat people continue to sail to the
colony, with 356 arriving last month, up from 114 for January and 91
in February 1988.
   Meanwhile, resettlement of the approximately 15,000 Vietnamese in
Hong Kong camps granted refugee status received a recent boost with
several countries, including the United States, agreeing to increase
the number they accept.
   Officials believe 4,000 refugees may be resettled this year from
Hong Kong, up from 2,772 last year and 2,212 in 1987.

<DATELINE>PUNTA ARENAS, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chilean navy today floated a ring
of booms around a grounded Peruvian ship in an effort to contain an
oil spill that has created a slick more than a half-mile long in the
Antarctic, a spokesman said.
   The navy spokesman, Lt. Cristian Carbone, said in a telephone
interview that ``our priority task at this point is to contain the
spill.''
   ``Floating the Humboldt comes next,'' said Carbone, who was in
Punta Arenas, 1,500 miles south of Santiago.
   He said divers plunged into the frigid waters to evaluate the
damage to the Humboldt's oil tanks and begin sealing them.
   Frogmen from nearby Uruguayan and South Korean antarctic stations
also are participating in the operation, according to a navy
communique.
   The 1,980-ton Humboldt ran aground shortly before midnight Sunday
at the entrance of Marion Cove, on King George Island. All 64
scientists and sailors aboard were rescued by the British Royal
Navy's ice patrol ship Endurance.
   On Wednesday, however, a group of sailors were back on the ship
to start planning the operation to float it and await for the
arrival of the Chilian cutter Yelcho to coordinate the cleanup. The
Yelcho arrived today.
   Carbone said the barrier installed around the Humboldt is the
same type used successfully a month ago to contain a mayor oil spill
caused by the Bahia Paraiso, an Argentine navy vessel that run
aground off the Antarctic peninsula.
   The oil slick created by the Humboldt had grown to more than a
half-mile long and 150 feet wide by Wednesday afternoon, more than
double its size of a day earlier, according to the Chilean navy.
   Peruvian officials, however, claimed the spill is minimal.
   Carbone stressed that the priority was to clean up the spill, and
then try to float the ship.
   ``The floating operation will be undertaken earlier only if
experts consider it is necessary to contain the oil spill,'' he said.
   The navy said the damage sustained by the Humboldt, which is
stable sitting on rocks and sand, does not seem serious and
officials are confident they will be able to float it soon.
   Winds up to 80 mph on Wednesday prevented efforts to right the
Humboldt and clean up the diesel oil leaking from two fuel tanks,
the navy said.

   A B-52 bomber flew over northern Canada
today in a test of the first U.S. cruise missile containing the new
stealth technology.
   The missile was to remain attached to the B-52, in what is called
a captive-carry test. Flights where the missile remains attached to
the aircraft are used to check guidance systems.
   ``As far as we know everything is proceeding well,'' said Maj.
Jan Martinsen at the Cold Lake base in northeastern Alberta, near
the test's target site. The aircraft was to return to the United
States later today.
   The B-52 headed north from Edwards Air Force Base in California
late Wednesday. The test had been scheduled for Wednesday morning
but was delayed for 24 hours because of weather problems.
   The decision to allow testing of the advanced cruise in Canada
drew protests from peace groups.
   They said the missile, equipped with stealth technology so it can
better avoid detection, is an offensive weapon that will fuel the
arms race and ultimately create a need for a costly and complex
Canadian air defence system.
   The Canadian and U.S. governments have said the weapon is too
slow to be a first-strike, offensive weapon.
   The stealth cruise is an improved version of the air-launched
missiles that have been tested over northern Canada for several
years. In addition to stealth technology it also has increased range
and better accuracy.
   Cruise testing in Canada is carried out under an agreement first
signed with the United States in 1983 and renewed last year.

<TEXT>
   A Spanish air force helicopter burst into
flames over the capital and plunged into a densely populated
neighborhood today, killing its three crew members but causing no
injuries on the ground, police said.
   The explosion that occurred upon impact sent the front end of the
helicopter hurtling into the empty recess area outside Blas de Otero
high school, said a municipal police official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   He said the tail landed 180 feet away in a private courtyard.
   ``The students were apparently inside the building, in class,''
when the plane crashed at 1 p.m., he said.
   The police official said firefighters quickly extinguished the
burning wreckage, which was also near a shopping center in the
heavily populated southeast Aluche neighborhood.
   ``There was an explosion, then (the helicopter) started doing
somersaults and the rotor broke loose and then the tail
disintegrated,'' a witness to the accident told Spanish National
Radio.
   An air force spokesman, Cmdr. Julian Fernandez Torregrosa, said
the accident killed the helicoper's pilot, co-pilot and mechanic,
whom he identified as Capt. Alfredo Vidal Montero, 33, Capt. Ramon
Garrido de la Parra, 30, and 2nd Lt. Jose Rodriguez Montero,
respectively.
   Fernandez said the French-built Puma helicopter, which was on a
routine training mission, regularly took part in search and rescue
operations.
   An investigation was launched into the cause of the crash.
   The accident was the second this year involving a military
helicopter.
   On Jan. 18, one crewman died when an army helicopter crashed into
a reservoir near the capital.

   U.S. military officials are
investigating the disappearance near the East German border of a
U.S. soldier who had access to secret information. It was not known
if he defected.
   U.S. Navy Cmdr. Joe Wilkinson, from the U.S. European Command
headquarters in Stuttgart, identified the missing soldier Wednesday
as Spec. 4 Michael A. Peri, 21, of Laguna Niguel, Calif.
   He said Peri had access to classified information, was assigned
to the intelligence section of his unit and worked as an
``electronics warfare signal specialist.''
   Asked if Peri had defected to East Germany or if the possibility
existed he had gone into the communist country, Wilkinson said: ``It
would be inappropriate to speculate on that at this time.''
   Wilkinson said in a telephone interview that Peri was reported
missing when he failed to appear at his army unit's 6 a.m. formation
Feb. 21.
   He said Peri was assigned to Headquarters and Headquarters Troop,
11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in Fulda. The 11th Armored Cavalry is
stationed along West Germany's frontier with East Germany.
   Fulda is 65 miles northeast of Frankfurt.
   Wilkinson said Peri was last seen at 9 p.m. on Feb. 20.
   A search revealed that a jeep was missing from the unit's parking
area, Wilkinson said.
   He said the jeep was later discovered abandoned about 35 miles
northeast of Fulda, along the border near the town of Obersuhl.
   Wilkinson said Peri ``was responsible for operating equipment
that identifies and locates non-communications signals such as
radar. Additionally, he performed routine administrative duties
within the (intelligence) section.'' Wilkinson said Peri had been
assigned to West Germany since March 4, 1988.

   A Costa Rican airline treated a shipment of 30
monkeys ``like boxes of shoes,'' leading to the deaths of eight of
the primates, authorities said.
   The monkeys, which were shipped from Central America and
apparently were destined for the illegal pet trade, were found dead
Wednesday in cramped boxes left overnight at Kennedy International
Airport, authorities said.
   ``This has got to be the worst shipment that I've seen in my
three years'' at the airport, said Kathi Travers, director of an
American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals shelter
for animals in transit.
   She said some of the 2-by-2-foot boxes held as many as four
monkeys.
   ``They were treated like something that didn't have any life.
They were treated like boxes of shoes,'' Ms. Travers said.
   The 17 Capuchin monkeys and five spider monkeys that survived
``were stressed out and cold and very, very hungry,'' she said.
   The monkeys had been left unattended by LACSA Airline, the Costa
Rican airline, and were shipped by a South American importer, said
Jeffrey Hon, an ASPCA spokesman.
   The ASPCA issued summonses to the airline charging cruelty to
animals, failure to provide food, water and air, and inhumane
transporting, Hon said.
   ``This is a problem that has been going on too long,'' Ms.
Travers said. ``We're not putting up with this anymore. We're going
to catch the people doing this and we're going to nail them.''
   LACSA regional manager Jose Rodriguez today had no immediate
comment.

<TEXT>
   Congress celebrated the 200th anniversary of
its first session today with a joint meeting of the House and Senate
and a look back at two centuries of achievement and high hopes.
   The antique gavel of the Senate and the historic mace of the
House were carried into the floor of the House and the designs of
bicentennial postage stamps and coins were unveiled.
   Howard Nemerov, the poet laureate of the United States, read a
poem about Congress at the beginning of its third century:,
   ``Here the million varying wills get melted down, get hammered
out until the movie's reduced to stills that tell us what the law's
about,'' he read.
   ``... So it's a republic, as Franklin said, if you can keep it;
and we did this far, and hope to keep our quarrel funny and just,
though with this moral:
   ``Praise without end for the go-ahead zeal of whoever it was
invented the wheel; but never a word for the poor soul's sake that
thought ahead, and invented the brake.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Miitchell, D-Maine, recalling the
11,200 men and women who have served in Congress since the first
session in 1789, told the assembly: ``We stretch out our hands
across two centuries and we say to them, if we have not matched your
record of accomplishment, we hope at least we have been worthy of
your trust.''
   Today's celebration commemorated a date on which a process was
begun, but nothing of importance really happened.
   When Congress convened in New York City in March 1789 it took a
month and more to achieve the House and Senate quorums that enabled
both chambers to get down to actual work.
   As a matter of convenience, Congress is celebrating the day of
its birth on the wrong date.
   The first session took place on March 4, 1789, not March 2.
   But the actual 200th anniversary falls on Saturday. The Congress
of 1989 _ the 101st Congress _ will not be in session that day.
   March 4, 1789 was a day of celebration in New York City, complete
with waving flags, the ringing of church bells and the firing of
cannon salutes.
   But the Senate journal for that first day was less joyful.
   Only 13 of the 59 representatives and eight of the 22 senators
showed up.
   The journal entry read: ``The number not being suffience to
establish a quorum, they adjourned ....''
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., in his new collection of speeches
on the history of Congress, notes that the continued lack of a
quorum, which continued day after day, led to nervousness that the
new Congress established under the Constitution would continue the
pattern of absenteeism and paralysis set by the defunct Congress
which operated under the Articles of Confederation.
   Appeals went out for members to attend.
   Rep. Fusher Ames of Massachusetts was worried as late winter
turned into early spring.
   ``We lose credit, spirit, everything,'' he recorded in his
journal. ``The public will forget the government before it is born.''
   But finally the appeals were heeded.
   ``On April 1, Thomas Scott came over the Alleghenies from western
Pennsylvania to give the House its first quorum. But it was not
until April 6, when Richard Henry Lee arrived from Virginia, that
the first quorum of 12 senators was secured,'' Byrd wrote.
   Once that quorum was established, the Senate and House
accomplished work and set precedents that have stood the test of two
centuries.
   That first Congress adopted the Bill of Rights _ the first 10
amendments to the Constitution _ established the Supreme Court and
other divisions of the federal court system; counted the first
electoral ballots that seated George Washington as the first
president; passed the first tariff legislation to provide an income
for the federal government; and created the structure and committees
of both houses.
   But Dr. Raymond Smock, the historian of the House, says a certain
unfortunate aspect of it all lingers on.
   ``I wish the House had begun its official work on March 31, or
April 2, or on any day other than April 1,'' he says.
   ``I can already see the jokes and media madness during this
bicentennial year that will focus on how the House finally got down
to business on April Fool's Day _ and how nothing has changed
since.''

<TEXT>
   The Bhopal compensation case became
entangled in legalities today when the Supreme Court agreed to hear
a petition challenging the government's authority to reach a
settlement with the Union Carbide Corp.
   The court also agreed to hear four other petitions that called
for either an increase in compensation or asked for court guidance
on how relief should be distributed among victims of the world's
deadliest industrial disaster.
   The decision came two weeks after the Supreme Court announced a
settlement with Union Carbide.
   In February, the U.S.-based company agreed to pay damages of $470
million to victims of the Dec. 3, 1984 leak of methyl isocyanate
from the pesticide plant operated by Union Carbide's indian
subsidiary in Bhopal.
   Union Carbide, whose headquarters are in Danbury, Conn., has
already deposited the money with the court.
   The key petition filed today challenged the Indian government's
authority to represent the 3,300 people who died in the tragedy or
the estimated 20,000 others injured by the deadly gas.
   Under a 1985 act, the Indian government was given sole authority
to represent all victims of the tragedy after hundreds of indian and
U.S. lawyers said they would represent victims in separate cases.
   ``I have a very strong case,'' said Charanlal Sahu, a Bhopal
attorney who said he and his family were affected by exposure to the
gas. ``The act goes against the Indian Constitution. The victims
have no confidence in the ability of the Union of India.''
   ``You can't snatch away an individual's fundamental right to be
heard in a court of law,'' he said. ``But the Indian government, by
a stroke of a pen, became the sole representative of all the
victims.''
   Chief Justice R.S. Pathak said he would hear Sahu's case.
   ``There is urgency in the matter... It is a case involving the
country's constitution,'' Pathak said.
   A court official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said four
other petitions from two gas victims' associations and two human
rights lawyers may come up for hearings Friday.
   ``We do not want to delay the matter any more,'' the official
said.
   But Sahu said if the court agrees to give the petitions a full
hearing, it will take at least six months to reach any decisions.
   One petition suggested the Indian government pay the difference
between the $3 billion, for which the Indian government originally
sued, and the $470 million settlement. Other petitions asked for an
increase in compensation as well as jobs for victims and their
families.

   A former Communist Party chief in the
province of Kosovo has been arrested in connection with recent
ethnic unrest there, the state-run Tanjug news agency said today.
   Police also arrested two directors of the Trepca lead and zinc
mine, the site of a recent eight-day sit-in by ethnic Albanian
miners pressing for political change, Tanjug reported.
   Tanjug said the three ``would be handed over to judicial organs
for further investigation and a possible trial.''
   The former party chief is Azem Vlasi. The mine directors are Aziz
Abrasi and Burhan Kavaja. Vlasi is an ethnic Albanian who headed
Kosovo's party until last year, when he was forced to resign because
of the ethnic tensions.
   Kosovo is a province in the republic of Serbia. Ethnic Albanians
make up about 90 percent of Kosovo's population, and the minority
Serbs say they are persecuted by the Albanians.
   The secretary of Kosovo's communist leadership, Tomislav Sekulic,
today announced widespread arrests of alleged organizers of recent
ethnic Albanian protests, but he did not give names.
   Sekulic also refused to comment on reports that Fadilj Hoxha, a
former vice president of Yugoslavia of Albanian descent, had
defected to neighboring Albania. Hoxha was kicked out of the
Communist Party in 1987 for his alleged support of ethnic Albanian
nationalists. Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said Hoxha
had defected.
   Huge demonstrations by Serbs, which began Tuesday in front of
Yugoslavia's federal Parliament, petered out during a heavy
overnight rain. About 4,000 protesters who had been in front of
Parliament dispersed.
   The arrests came after Lazar Mojsov, a former Yugoslav president,
announced that officials had a document from an ``illegal (ethnic
Albanian) group'' that allegedly detailed plans to destabilize the
province of Kosovo by an armed uprising of ethnic Albanians. Mojsov
warned in an address to Parliament on Wednesday that the unrest
seriously threatens Yugoslavia's unity.
   The session was called to discuss the deteriorating security
situation in the country in the wake of the protests in Kosovo and
counter-demonstrations by Serbs in Belgrade and other parts of
Serbia.
   An Associated Press photographer and a reporter and photographer
from the French news agency, Agence France-Presse, were detained by
Kosovo police this week while covering the unrest.
   Dieter Endlicher, a Frankfurt-based AP photographer, was detained
five hours Wednesday in the provincial capital of Pristina for
taking pictures of military vehicles deployed in the province.
   Endlicher, a West German citizen, was released after his film was
developed and no incriminating shots were found to be on it, he said.
   Helene Popovich, an AFP correspondent from Belgrade and a French
citizen, and Srdjan Ilic, the bureau's photographer, were taken in
for questioning after Ilic photographed a group of Yugoslav army
vehicles near Pristina, the French news agency said.
   Popovich was released after three hours at state security
headquarters, but the whereabouts of Ilic, a Yugoslav national whose
cameras were said to have been badly damaged by a Yugoslav army
officer, were not known.
   Popovich was told by an official of the state security police
that ``some of the foreign journalists in Kosovo would be kicked out
of the province.''

   President Bush today thanked acting Defense

   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that
Taft was present at a meeting at which Bush was given an updated

management and strategic policy.
   Fitzwater said the president held the meeting because, among
other things, he wanted to ``emphasize his overall confidence with

   Taft is a holdover from the Reagan administration, where he was
deputy defense secretary.

   Two rats believed to be loose aboard a Japan Air

transfer nearly 300 New York-bound passengers to another plane, a
spokesman said Thursday.
   Airline employees discovered 25 rats, being imported for
laboratory use, had escaped from their cage after the jet arrived
from New York on Wednesday night. Although they managed to capture
23, two remained unaccounted for by noon Thursday, when the Boeing
747 was to return to New York from Tokyo.
   ``We had to ground the flight because of safety precautions,''
said JAL spokesman Keiichi Sakamoto. He said the rats could have
chewed through cables during the night.
   A different jet was readied for the 294 passengers, who finally
left the Tokyo six hours late.
   The two white rats remained at large, and the jet won't fly until
they are captured, Sakamoto said. Traps have been set aboard the
plane.

<HEAD>Tower's Defense Of Thomas Dodd 22 Years Ago Weighs on Son</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Tower Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans and Democrats alike lined up in
near unison on the Senate floor on June 23, 1967, to take the
extraordinary step of censuring one of their own.
   On a day that would spell the eventual end of his political
career and leave deep scars on his family, Thomas Dodd, the veteran
Connecticut Democrat accused of misusing campaign funds, could count
his advocates on a single hand. One of the few: a young Republican
senator from Texas named John Tower.
   Now, Dodd's son, who followed in his late father's political
footsteps, is faced with a personally agonizing decision: whether to
vote with his Democratic colleagues against Tower's nomination for
defense secretary or support a man who backed his father even when
long-time friends and political allies wouldn't.
   The two Senate dramas, separated by 22 years, have become
inseparably linked for Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, a potential swing
vote on the Tower nomination.
   Dodd, who according to aides remains undecided, has said Tower's
support of his father will not be the deciding factor in his
decision on the nomination. But Tower's actions, which included
several last-minute attempts to water down the elder Dodd's
punishment, weigh on the mind of the son.
   ``Of course I haven't forgotten how John Tower voted. What kind
of son would I be if I did?'' Dodd said.
   Dodd spokesman Jason Isaacson called the past Tower connection a
``minor consideration.'' More important to Dodd, according to
Isaacson, is deciding for himself about the propriety of Tower's
activities as a defense consultant after leaving the Senate.
   ``He will cast a vote as a United States senator and not simply
as Tom Dodd's son,'' the aide said.
   But others familiar with the senator's thinking believe the
painful memory of his father's political demise could be a powerful
factor.
   ``He definitely feels his dad got railroaded and feels a loyalty
to those'' who defended his father, said one Democrat who requested
anonymity.
   It is easy to remember those who were in Tom Dodd's corner in
June of 1967 because there were so few.
   Voting against censure were Dodd, Sen. Russell B. Long, D-La.;
fellow Connecticut Democrat Abraham Ribicoff; Sen. Strom Thurmond,
R-S.C., and Tower.
   Long spearheaded Dodd's defense on the Senate floor and gave a
six-hour speech defending his longtime friend, but Tower also played
a key role.
   A week into the emotional floor debate, Tower offered a
compromise amendment that would have changed the censure to a
reprimand, removed the word ``dishonor'' and rephrased ``contrary to
accepted morals'' to ``contrary to accepted standards of conduct.''
That was defeated 87-9.
   The next day, another Tower proposal that would have modified the
language to a lesser degree was defeated 78-18 before the Senate
voted 92-5 for a censure resolution that said Dodd had engaged in
conduct ``which is contrary to accepted morals, derogates from the
public trust expected of a senator and tends to bring the Senate
into dishonor and disrepute.''
   The vote was based on evidence that Dodd took $116,083 from
testimonial dinners for his personal use. He argued that the funds
were not intended for his campaign but were personal gifts and he
should have been allowed to use the money any way he pleased.
   Tower said he felt censure was unfair since at the time there was
no code of ethics.
   In a floor speech during the nine days of debate, Tower recalled
a story about Prescott Bush, the one-time Connecticut senator and
late father of President Bush.
   ``It has been said that we have a pretty clubby atmosphere around
here,'' Tower said. ``A young lady rushed up to (Prescott Bush) and
said: `Senator Bush, is it true that the Senate is a very exclusive
club, that the members are very courteous and deferential to each
other, regardless of differences of political belief?'
   ``He replied, `Yes young lady, it is true. ... But when one of us
breaks a leg, we eat him.'''

<HEAD>Funeral Held For Girl Whose Death Is Linked To Mandela Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOWETO, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A priest called for reconciliation
between anti-apartheid groups and Winnie Mandela today at the
funeral of a 13-year-old girl killed in an attack police suspect was
linked to Mrs. Mandela's bodyguards.
   The teen-ager, Finkie Msomi, was killed Feb. 22 at a house in
Soweto when gunmen opened fire on the dwelling and set it alight
with a firebomb. Police have said the attackers may have been
seeking to avenge the slaying of Maxwell Madondo, who worked as a
bodyguard for Mrs. Mandela.
   Anti-apartheid groups have renounced Mrs. Mandela, accusing the
black leader's unofficial bodyguards _ known as the Mandela United
soccer club _ of waging a ``reign of terror'' in Johannesburg's
black township of Soweto.
   The funeral for the slain girl was the second in five days for a
teen-ager whose death has been linked to the Mandela controversy.
Stompie Seipei, a 14-year-old activist from the township of
Tumahole, was buried Saturday. Two members of the soccer club have
been charged in his death.
   News reports have asserted that Mrs. Mandela joined in whipping
Stompie, and three young men allegedly abducted along with him from
a Methodist Church. Mrs. Mandela has denied any wrongdoing.
   About 800 people, many of them schoolchildren, attended a
two-hour funeral service for Finkie Nsomi at St. Margaret's Church
in Soweto, the township of 2.5 million blacks.
   ``We gather here for reconciliation in the eyes of the Lord, not
for revenge,'' said a priest, the Rev. Reimi Makubane. ``We pray for
reconciliation for our own people, for justice and peace for all.''
   Some of the students at the service sang freedom songs, and 200
jogged along a street afterward.
   Mrs. Mandela formed the soccer club in 1986, saying she wanted to
organize activities for black youths living on the streets. But the
group, which grew to as many as 30, became an unofficial force of
bodyguards who seldom played soccer and antagonized members of the
community.
   After speaking about the controvery with her husband, jailed
black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela, Mrs. Mandela said she would
disband the club and move team members from her house. Mandela, the
leader of the outlawed African National Congress, has been jailed
since 1962, sentenced to life on charges of sedition and sabotage.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 28 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   A man who said he swallowed seven grams of
cocaine to avoid arrest by approaching police officers died of an
overdose two hours later, police reported today.
   Samuel M. McBeth, 36, of Fostoria, ate the drug in a parking lot
Wednesday as two officers investigating suspicious activity
approached the car in which he was sitting, said Capt. Ken Koperski.
   The officers struggled briefly with McBeth and a woman also in
the car and said they noticed McBeth trying to swallow something,
Koperski said.
   ``He (McBeth) told the officers that he had swallowed cocaine so
they couldn't arrest him for possession,'' Koperski said.
   McBeth was taken to Mercy Hospital, where he told doctors he had
consumed about seven grams of the drug, some of it crack. Doctors
said he died in the emergency room of cardiac arrest caused by an
overdose, Koperski said.
   An autopsy was ordered.

<HEAD>New-Home Sales Surge 4.9 Percent in January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of new, single-family homes posted their
biggest gain in seven months during January, the government reported
Thursday, but analysts said the 4.9 percent increase was due in part
to unusually mild winter weather.
   Sales reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 704,000 in
January, following a 2 percent increase in December, the Commerce
Department said. New sales were bolstered by strong activity in the
Midwest.
   Dave Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of
Home Builders, said much of January's increase probably occurred
because warm weather brought more people out to shop for homes,
borrowing sales from future months.
   The increase also may reflect a temporary dip in mortgage
interest rates during the month, which gave home buyers a ``window
of opportunity to move into the market,'' Seiders said.
   January's strong showing aside, analysts still are forecasting a
decline in construction of single-family homes this year based on
expectations that mortgage rates will rise during the first half of
1989 and the economy will slow.
   New home sales had edged up a slim 0.9 percent during 1988 after
plunging 10.5 percent in 1987, when the drop was blamed on increased
interest rates and a slowdown in demand after five strong sales
years.
   After temporarily sliding during January, fixed-rate home
mortgages resumed their climb in February and last week were
averaging 10.78 percent, up from 9.87 percent a year earlier,
according to a national survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp.
   Economists predict rates could reach 12 percent this year,
although the increasing popularity of adjustable-rate mortgages that
offer lower initial interest rates could mitigate damage to the
single-family housing market.
   As the Federal Reserve Board continues to push up interest rates
in an effort to slow economic growth and restrain inflation, higher
rates ``are really going to bite into the housing market,'' said
economist Richard Peach of the Mortgage Bankers Association.
   ``We are going to start to see some modest declines in housing
market activity once we get the numbers for March, April and May,''
Peach predicted.
   Seiders said that with financial troubles plaguing the nation's
savings and loans, which are the largest lenders of adjustable-rate
mortgages, ``we're kind of worried about the funds situation as we
go out through 1989.''
   January's increase in home sales was the biggest monthly jump
since a 5.4 percent increase last June.
   The strength was concentrated in the Midwest, where sales rose
22.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 110,000.
   Seiders said the increase was largely due to mild weather in that
region, although the Midwest's housing market also has been aided by
the strength of manufacturing industries experiencing rising export
sales.
   Sales last month were up 8 percent in the West and rose 0.9
percent in the Northeast, but declined 1.9 percent in the South.
   The median price for a new home, meanwhile, declined 6.9 percent
in January to $113,000, meaning half the homes sold for more and
half for less. The average price, which is pulled up by sales of
very expensive homes, also was down, falling 8.2 percent to $137,100.
   Peach said the drop in price probably was linked to the shift of
sales toward the less-expensive Midwest rather than any trend toward
declining prices nationally.

   President Bush voiced doubts in talks today
with Guatemala's president about the recent Central American peace
agreement that would disband the Contra forces as he mulls keeping
them alive with U.S. aid, Bush's spokesman said.
   Bush told President Vinicio Cerezo the United States is concerned
about the commitment of the ruling Sandinistas to live up to their
promises of democratic reform in Nicaragua in exchange for
demobilizing the 11,000-strong Contra army, said White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater said no decison has been made on what the
administration will propose to Congress when the current $27 million
Contra aid package runs out at the end of this month.
   But he indicated some new humanitarian aid likely will be sought.
In the meantime the Central American presidents still must work out
details of their new peace agreement.
   In the general agreement last month, they said they would come up
with specifics on how to disband the Contras and impose the
accompanying conditions in Nicaragua within 90 days, a deadline that
falls after the Congra aid package expires.
   ``We're reviewing the matter now with a view toward the
humanitarian aid,'' Fitzwater said in his daily press briefing. He
did not mention military aid, saying, ``We would like a diplomatic
solution.''
   Cerezo, speaking to reporters after the session, said, ``We have
talked in the Central American countries about humanitarian aid at
least in this moment'' to keep the Contras organized while Nicaragua
works out conditions to repatriate them.
   U.S. officials have expressed concerns about likely timetables
and enforcement mechanisms by which the Sandinistas will be kept to
their promises.
   Bush, joined by Secretary of State James A. Baker and numerous
aides in his Oval Office session with Cerezo, declined to answer a
question on whether he feels the Contras should be kept together for
a year or so, as has been proposed in some quarters.
   Baker is considering proposing aid to keep the rebel forces
intact while waiting to see if the Sandinistas keep their word,
according to sources quoted in today's Washington Post.
   Cerezo met Wednesday with Vice President Dan Quayle on the same
topics, aides said.
   Cerezo told reporters that Nicaragua should make democratic
reforms _ such as freeing of political prisoners _ before and at the
time of a final agreement to demobilize the Contra forces that have
battled the Sandinistas for more than seven years. But Cerezo was
not specific on what reforms should be made when.
   Cerezo said administration officials ``still have reservations''
about the peace agreement reached two weeks ago by the presidents of
the five Central American nations: Costa Rica, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua.
   U.S. officials have said that the diplomatic approach should be
given a chance, but that they are skeptical of the Sandinistas'
commitment to live up to their promises unless there are adequate
enforcement mechanisms.
   In the past, the U.S.-funded Contras were said to constitute such
a mechanism.
   Previous peace talks have collapsed in disagreement over what
should occur first _ disarmament of the rebels or internal
democractic reforms in Nicaragua.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega pledged in the agreement last
month to free political prisoners, hold early elections with United
Nations observers, allow opposition parties access to the media and
repatriate the Contras.
   The agreement contained no timetable for such actions, and the
presidents said such details would be in a plan they would work out
by the end of 90 days.
   Cerezo, during a photo session with Quayle, said the Sandinistas
should implement the reforms ``before and at the same time when we
affirm the plans for the Contras' demobilization.''
   Cerezo said he assured Quayle the Contras would disarm ``in an
orderly manner.''
   The vice president also brought up Guatemalan human rights with
Cerezo, said an official, speaking on condition of anonymity and
revealing no further details.
   State Department sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that Guatemala has a continuing pattern of human rights abuses,
and that the government must bring those responsible for politically
motivated crimes to justice.
   Americas Watch, a private human rights group, has said that
Guatemala's record on the rights issue is far worse than the
administration is willing to concede.
   Juan Mendez, the group's executive director, told Congress last
month that Guatemala ``continues to have one of the worst human
rights records in the Western Hemisphere.''
   One State Department official said U.S. officials do not share
that dismal assessment, and that it was unlikely the Americans would
``hit Cerezo very hard on human rights.''

<HEAD>McDonnell Douglas Increased Military Business Last Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The McDonnell Douglas Corp. increased its
military business last year despite an overall decline in Pentagon
spending, retaining the title of America's largest defense
contractor.
   Releasing today its annual rating of the top 100 military
contractors, the Pentagon said McDonnell Douglas substantially
widened its lead over General Dynamics Corp. and General Electric
Co. in fiscal 1988 because contract totals declined for the the
second- and third-ranked contractors.
   St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas received military contracts
worth $8 billion in fiscal 1988, up from $7.7 billion in fiscal 1987
and far ahead of the $6.5 won by No. 2 General Dynamics.
   GE received military contracts worth $5.7 billion in fiscal 1988.
   General Dynamics Pentagon business declined from $7 billion in
fiscal 1987 to $6.5 billion last year, while GE's business declined
from $5.8 billion to $5.7 billion.
   The remainder of the Top 10 in fiscal 1988 included Tenneco Inc.,
with $5.1 billion; Raytheon Co. with $4.1 billion; Martin Marietta
Corp. with $3.7 billion; General Motors Corp. with $3.6 billion;
Lockheed Corp. with $3.54 billion; United Technologies Corp. with
$3.51 billion, and the Boeing Co. with $3 billion.
   The report, entitled ``100 Companies Receiving the Largest Dollar
Volume of Prime Contract Awards,'' covers the fiscal year ending
last Sept. 30, and is considered the most definitive gauge of how
major military contractors are faring each year.
   The report discloses the Pentagon's contractors were fighting
over a smaller pie in fiscal 1988, with prime contracts totaling
$137 billion being parceled out. That is $5.5 billion less than the
total awarded in fiscal 1987.
   The top 100 companies, as a group, saw their share of those
contracts decline last year. The 100 firms received $90.1 billion of
the contracts, or 65.8 percent of the total, compared to $95.4
billion and 66.9 percent in fiscal 1987.
   ``The smallest total amount received by a company in the fiscal
1988 list was $129 million, compared to $122 million in fiscal
1987,'' the Pentagon added.
   The biggest change in the fiscal 1988 rankings was the rise of
Tenneco, a company that ranked 13th in fiscal 1987. Tenneco's jump
to fourth in the rankings was based on orders from the Navy for two
nuclear-powered aircraft carriers received by the Newport News
Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Co., a wholly owned subsidiary.
   This was the second consecutive year that McDonnell Douglas
ranked first. McDonnell Douglas reclaimed the No. 1 ranking in
fiscal 1987 after being shouldered aside the year earlier by General
Dynamics.
   Some of McDonnell's larger contracts include the F-A-18 Hornet
fighter for the Navy; the F-15 Eagle for the Air Force; the AH-64
Apache helicopter gunship for the Army, and the AV-8B Harrier jump
jet for the Marine Corps. The company also builds Tomahawk and
Harpoon missile systems.

   William J. Bennett assured senators today he
would defend the civil liberties of Americans as coordinator of the
government's anti-drug fight, although ``this war is not for
delicate sensibilities.''
   In his second day of confirmation hearings as director of
national drug control policy, the former education secretary
defended his support of school officials who set up metal detectors
and take other measures to control violence and drug abuse in the
schools.
   ``This war is not for delicate sensibilities,'' he told the
Senate Judiciary Committee. ``This is tough stuff.''
   However, during a philosophical discussion with committee
Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., Bennett said, ``I can't
imagine circumstances in the near future ... that would require us''
to suspend civil liberties in the cause of fighting drugs.
   ``They are the base. They are the cement. They are the anchor.
They sometimes cause us difficulties in this war ... but these are
the ends ... You can't destroy the fabric of the country in order to
defend the country,'' Bennett said.
   He said he opposed ``some who were arguing for universal (drug)
testing of students.''
   When Biden asked his reason for that resistance, Bennett replied,
``Because I'm sensitive to the Constitution, the Fourth Amendment,''
which prohibits unreasonable search and seizure.
   The hearing concluded today after representatives of the League
of United Latin American Citizens and the Association for
Supervision and Curriculum Development offered testimony critical of
Bennett's nomination.
   Biden, who said Wednesday that, ``My intent ... is to move this
nomination as quickly as possible,'' scheduled a committee vote for
next Thursday.
   Among the committee members, only Sens. Howard Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio, and Paul Simon, D-Ill. indicated they might vote against
Bennett.
   The senators praised Bennett's assertions that he would handle
the job aggressively, tackling all the nitty-gritty details of
coordinating the anti-drug efforts, ending turf battles between
agencies and focusing on treatment and prevention as well as law
enforcement.
   But Sen. Edward M. Kennedy drew Bennett out on whether he would
support a ban on semiautomatic combat-style weapons used by drug
traffickers.
   A host of drug-related shootings and the killing of five
California schoolchildren have prompted calls for a ban on
military-style semiautomatic weapons with high-capacity ammunition
clips. President Bush has said he opposed such regulation, while
Mrs. Bush supports a ban.
   At Wednesday's hearing, Kennedy pulled out a memo Bennett had
written March 14, 1988, to then Attorney General Edwin Meese III in
which he asked Meese to considering support of legislation ``to
better manage the production, importation and sale of automatic
weapons and other firearms.''
   When Kennedy asked him whether he now would support legislation
limiting access to such weapons as AK-47s and Uzis, Bennett said,
``It depends on what it is,'' and added that it would be part of the
national drug control strategy that he will be called upon to put
together within 180 days of taking office.
   The weapons in question are semiautomatic adaptations of AK-47s
and Uzis. The tightly regulated military versions can switch back
and forth from semiautomatic to automatic.
   ``I will admit a personal reservation about private ownership of
AK-47s,'' Bennett said. ``I'm not a gun owner. ... The president
knows I have my concerns.''
   Metzenbaum questioned Bennett about how many minority group
members he had hired to the new office and how many he planned to
hire, and Simon criticized Bennett's failure to file a minority
hiring plan with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission when he
headed the education department.
   Bennett said he would stand on his record on employment of
minorities when he headed the education department and the National
Endowment for the Humanities, saying, ``I have a record as good as
anybody.''
   ``We will make every effort to fill the positions with the best
people we can find,'' Bennett said. ``Will I hire someone to a job
just because he's a minority? No. That's an insult to that person.''
   Bennett told the committee that he felt he could do the drug czar
job well, although there will be no quick victories in the war
against drugs.
   ``It will take more than 180 days to turn the tide around,'' he
said.
   Bennett said he would use the job both as as bully pulpit and as
a way to coordinate and direct the drug-fighting activities of
government agencies, and he said he has been getting cooperation
from the heads of agencies he'll be dealing with as drug czar.
   ``I've been getting my calls returned,'' he said. ``I'm even
getting some calls returned that I didn't make.''

   Hermann Burger, a Swiss writer known
mostly to German-language readers for his brooding novels, has died
of an overdose of pills in an apparent suicide at the age of 46, a
district attorney said Thursday.
   Burger had been dead for several days when worried relatives and
friends found his body at his home Wednesday night, said Walter
Sandmeier, the district attorney for Aargau canton.
   Burger, a friend of recently elected Swiss defense minister
Kaspar Villiger, received several literary prizes during his
two-decade career, which also included a stint as a journalist.
   In recent days, he got mixed reviews for his latest novel,
intended as start of a three-book series.
   His 1982 novel ``The Artificial Mother'' was considered his best.
Like most of his works, it tells of the protagonist's fight against
a psychosomatic ailment.
   Burger was the first German-language author to employ a
professional public relations adviser.

   A Miami man today described how Oliver North
ran a 1985 meeting that focused on the Contra rebels opening a southern
front in their war against the leftist government of
Nicaragua.
   Rafael Quintero, a Cuban-American who helped coordinate the
Contra arms supply effort, testified at the trial oc`whe former
White House aide that ``basically Mr. North'' was in charge of the
June 28, 1985 meeting at Miami International Airport.
   Also attending the meeting, he said, were Contra leaders Adolfo
Calero and Enrique Bermudez as well as retired Air Force Maj. Gen.
Richard Secord and his associate Thomas Clines, an ex-CIA official,
who were involved in obtaininb`brms and shipping them to the Contras.
   At the meeting, it was North's suggestion ``to open a southern
front,'' Quintero told a jury in U.S. District Court.
   He added that North also discussed the possibility of sinking a
barge to obstruct the Rama River in order to cut off a military supply
line that Nickrfgua's Sandinista government was using. Eighty
percent of the supplies passed across the river, Quintero said.
   Quintero also testified he once heard North say that President
Reagan backed the clandestine effort to resupply the Contras.
   This, Quintero said, at a 1986 meeting in El Salvador when a
high El Savadoran official tried to get a commitment for continued
aid. ``This high official was not going to stick his neck out and
have it cut off,'' said Quintero.
   ``Mr. North pointed out the president was very much aware of the
efforts this high Salvadoran official was doing, that the president
wanted these efforts to continue'' he added in broken English.
   Further, Quintero testified, North told the Salvadoran that when
aid resumed legally _ as it did in 1986 _ that the
Salvadoran's position would become ``much easier than now.''
   Quintero said that in 1985 he returned from an inspection tour of
Contra operations in Central America. While in the Vienna, Va.,
offices of Secord, the retired general telephoned North, telling him
``the little man from the South just came by'' with a report,
Quintero testified.
   Quintero, a veteran of the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba who
did work for the CIA, said Secord had enlisted his help in assisting
the Contras and that he was paid some $228,000 over two years for
his efforts, including expenses.
   Quintero also described an incident in 1986 in El Salvador when
North settled a dispute bettween factions over which should receive
air drops of supplies. Douth decreed that Col. James Steele, former
commander of U.S. Forces in El Salvador and Joe Fernandez, CIA
station chief in Costa Rica, should have the final word, said
Quintero. He said he made 16 trips to Central America from January
to June 1986 to oversee construction of an airstrip designed to
bolster a southern military front for the Contras.
   The prosecution team in the North trial put Quintero on the
witness stand after defense attorney Brendan Sullivan said he had no
questions on cross-examination for the previous witness, retired
Army Maj. Gen. John Singlaub.
   On Wednesday, Singlaub testified about a series of contacts with
North from 1984 to 1986 when Congress had banned U.S. military aid
to the Contras.
   The government is trying to prove that North lied to Congress
about his efforts to help the Contras during the aid ban.
   Prosecutors introduced a letter that Singlaub sent to then-CIA
Director William Casey a few days before North _ then a National
Security Council aide _ told a House panel he hadn't had any contact
with Singlaub for 20 months.
   Singlaub's letter to the CIA suggested otherwise, and Singlaub
testified that he in fact met with North ``maybe six times'' from
the summer of 1985 to August 1986.
   In addition, Singlaub said he had contacts ``perhaps one or two
times a month'' with North through Robert Owen, North's courier to
the Contras during the period, and said he spoke to North on the
telephone on ``four to six'' occasions.
   The letter to Casey included a list of weapons available for
shipment to the Contras. The letter said the list was developed ``in
conjunction with a member'' of the National Security Council ``who
is knowledgeable of the urgentness of the United Nicaraguan
Opposition with which the U.S. has a continuing interest.'' Singlaub
testified that he was referring to North.

   Four people were given short, suspended

showing the film ``The Last Temptation of Christ.''
   The four were convicted of throwing tear gas bombs and pouring
acid on seats in September and October at a movie theater in Angers,
about 180 miles southwest of Paris.
   Etienne Morcille, 25, was given a three-month suspended sentence
for tossing a tear gas bomb and for giving acid to another
unidentified man and two unidentified women, each of whom were given
two-month suspended sentences.
   All were fined $7,500 by the Angers court.
   Theaters throughout France were attacked while showing the film
by director Martin Scorsese. French fundamentalist Roman Catholics
condemned the film as sacrilegious and disrespectful in its
depiction of Jesus Christ.

<HEAD>Cranston Says Two Past Secretaries Decided Presidents Had Too Much

<TEXT>
   Sen. Alan Cranston said Thursday that there
have been two instances in the past in which defense secretaries
decided not to carry out a presidential order because they ``felt
that the president had had a bit too much to drink.''
   The California Democrat did not identify the occasions, except to
say they had occurred under different secretaries and different
presidents.
   The Senate Democratic whip made his comments at a breakfast
meeting with reporters in which he discussed John Tower's troubled
nomination to become defense secretary. A spokesman later said
Cranston will oppose the nomination, which is is jeopardy of being
rejected by the Democratic-controlled Senate.
   Cranston mentioned the two incidents to reporters, saying they
were indications that the nation cannot afford to have a secretary
of defense who might be under the influence of alcohol and ``unable
to make a thoughtful and wise, quick decision on a matter of life
and death for our country.''
   Tower has been buffeted by questions about his drinking habits.
   Cranston's office issued a partial transcript of the breakfast
session, and the senator said his information on the two incidents
came from ``what I consider an unimpeachable source that's familiar
as anyone is with military matters.''
   He said there have been two instances since the position of
defense secretary was created in which the Pentagon chief decided
not to carry out presidential orders because he ``felt that the
president had had a bit too much to drink at that time and decided
to wait until the president was sober before seeing if that was
still what the president wanted to do.''
   Cranston was later asked whether the orders were renewed when the
unknown president woke up. ``No I do not,'' he said. ``I believe but
I do not know that the order was not repeated in wiser moments.''
   Cranston said neither of the incidents he was referring to
involved a widely rumored incident in 1974 when Defense Secretary
James Schlesinger issued an order to the armed forces not to execute
any orders he had not personally approved. Richard Nixon was
president at the time and in the throes of an impeachment crisis
spawned by Watergate.

   An art exhibit that appears to invite people to
step on the American flag reopened on a limited basis today, and a
judge later dismissed a lawsuit by veterans demanding that the
banner be removed from the floor.
   The School of the Art Institute closed the gallery Friday
following protests by veterans but announced Wednesday the show
would reopen for students, faculty and staff only. The exhibit was
closed to the press and public.
   The school cited the students' right of free expression in
reopening the exhibit.
   ``A majority of students intensely dislike the way the flag is
displayed, but they take a strong stand on First Amendment rights,''
said Peter Brown, the school's vice president. ``They want their
rights protected, because someday it may be them.''
   Students at the institute today immediately demanded that the
exhibit be opened to the public.
   ``Only in a space open to the public does freedom of expression
truly exist,'' said Luis Browne, a student spokesman. ``Restricted
viewing is censorship.''
   The decision to reopen the exhibit drew protests from veterans'
groups, who filed a lawsuit Wednesday seeking to remove the flag
from the floor, but the suit was dismissed today by Cook County
Judge Kenneth Gillis after a 90-minute hearing.
   ``What we're objecting to, of course ... is that it is the
American flag and the flag is being disgraced, walked on,'' John
Mahoney of the American Legion said Wednesday.
   ``This is totally unacceptable to the veterans' groups,'' said
Joseph A. Morris, general counsel for the Mid-America Legal
Foundation, which represents the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled
American Veterans and the Military Order of the Purple Heart, among
others.
   The flag placement ``invites people to participate in flag
desecration in violation of federal and state statutes,'' Morris
said. ``There are some things you can't do using art as an excuse.''
   The work by student Scott Tyler _ titled ``What Is the Proper Way
to Display a U.S. Flag?'' _ features a flag spread on the floor in
front of a montage. Depicted in the photographs are flag-draped
coffins, South Koreans burning the U.S. flag and other scenes.
Visitors are invited to comment in a ledger on a shelf in front of
the exhibit.
   The veterans complain that in doing so, most will step on the
flag. Morris said a viewer ``would have to be an acrobat or an
extremely tall person to write comments ... without trampling on the
flag.''
   But in a statement Wednesday, school officials said: ``It is not
necessary for the viewer to walk on the flag to write in the book.
   ``There is sufficient room to stand on either side of the flag
for those viewers who choose to write comments in the book.''
   Tyler has said that although the U.S. flag symbolizes freedom to
some people, it represents domination and oppression to others.
   It's the second time in a year that an exhibit at the school has
stirred controversy. Black aldermen stormed its halls last year to
take down a portrait of the late Harold Washington, the city's first
black mayor, who was depicted by a student wearing frilly women's
underwear.

   A researcher who maintains 1,000 venomous
snakes for scientific purposes was in serious but stable condition
Thursday after being bitten by a deadly Pakistan pit viper, his
148th snake bite.
   William E. Haast, 78, director of the Miami Serpentarium
Laboratories, was extracting venom from the viper Wednesday when it
bit his thumb, said John Dwan, spokesman for the University of Utah
Health Sciences Center.
   Haast drove himself to the hospital, but doctors were not
immediately able to administer anti-venin because Haast was allergic
to the stock on hand. Another type was flown in from the San Diego
Zoo.
   Dwan said Haast told him it was the 148th time he'd been bitten
by a snake.
   The 40-year-old Miami Serpentarium originated the concept of
importing snakes from around the world to collect their venom. Its
customers include the National Institutes of Health and hundreds of
research and medical laboratories, which use the venom to
manufacture anti-venins.

   A small colored drawing by Vincent van
Gogh of a woman with a folded umbrella fetched $311,284 at an
auction Thursday, more than three times the amount paid for it at an
auction in 1986.
   The sale at the Bernaerts auction house and art gallery ended
early Thursday after more than four hours of bidding.
   ``Sien With Umbrella,'' a crayon-and-pencil drawing van Gogh made
in 1883, went to an unidentified Belgian acting as an intermediary,
said Mon Bernaerts, the gallery's owner. It was bought for the art
trade, not for private ownership, he added.
   The drawing was sold for about $93,385 at an auction in 1986.
   In 1987, the van Gogh painting ``Irises,'' sold for $53.9 million
and ``Sunflowers'' went for $41.3 million.
   ``Sien With Umbrella'' measures only 18{-by-9.2 inches, and is a
drawing of a young woman, a folded umbrella under her right arm.

   When Melvin Kelly's dog went after
Anthony Barrera's miniature pig, Barrera brandished a pistol at the
dog, showing ``bad judgment'' but committing no crime, a judge has
ruled.
   District Justice William Ivill on Wednesday dismissed charges
against Barrera, 36, who was charged with recklessly endangering
another person, simple assault and disorderly conduct in the Jan. 31
incident.
   Kelly said he and his wife were caring for a stray dog, a
Siberian husky weighing 40 pounds, when the dog ``got away from me''
and went after Barrera's pig next door.
   Barrera ``started waving'' a pistol at the dog but ``did not
point the gun directly at me,'' Kelly said. But, he said, ``I felt
like I was being intimidated.''
   Neither animal was injured and no shots were fired.
   Ivill said Barrera was on his own property and licensed to carry
a gun. He ruled Barrera was ``preparing to defend his pet from a

   A Palestinian youth, his chest wrapped in a
bloody bandage, dies of a plastic bullet wound. His relatives scream
and bang their fists on hospital doors to express their grief.
   The dramatic scenes in the occupied Gaza Strip are part of a new
Israeli army instruction film, shown to foreign journalists
Thursday, that commanders say is intended to counter a tendency by
soldiers to use too much force when quelling Arab rioters.
   ``This death oils the wheels of the uprising,'' the narrator
says, summing up one key message of the film at a time when Israel
is coming under increasing criticism for harsh treatment of
Palestinian stone-throwers.
   At least 388 Palestinians have been killed during the nearly
15-month-old rebellion against Israeli rule, most by army gunfire
and several from beatings. Seventeen Israelis, including six
soldiers, also have died.
   Brig. Gen. Ehud Gross, the army's chief education officer, said
the 40-minute movie reflects concern in the military about soldiers
using excessive force against protesters.
   ``You know about the use of excessive power. We have some
problems with it. You have a small unit with a mission in the Gaza
Strip, someone loses his temper and uses too much power,'' Gross
said.
   ``We try to reduce the feeling of trying to use excessive power
when you get into a situation where you are humiliated or hurt. To
teach them to cope with it, bury it, put it behind you,'' he added.
   Disciplinary action for these breaches have been taken against
several hundred troops during the uprising. About 50 have been put
on trial.
   Gross indicated that illegal use of force was even more
widespread because troops hesitated to report on their colleagues
``because they don't want to violate the value of solidarity.''
   Excessive beating has raised particular concern among officials
after scenes of soldiers clubbing Palestinians began appearing on
foreign TV newscasts.
   This problem was dramatized this week at the trial of four troops
accused of beating a man in Jebalya refugee camp to death last
summer while conducting an arrest in the occupied Gaza Strip.
   Israel's chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, who testified at
the trial Wednesday, said the policy of beating was intended to
subdue rioters, not inflict punishment. But he noted there is a
``gray area'' where the soldiers must use their own discretion.
   Gross said the film was made partly to address this issue. ``We
understand there is some confusion. So we don't want to leave so
much open to interpretation.''
   The movie shows scenes of soldiers using clubs against rioters,
and a narrator points out which beatings were illegal.
   Shomron is also shown saying ``it must be clear that at the
moment when your goal is completed, there is no use of force for
punishment or revenge.''
   The film also shows tank battles in an attempt to point out the
difference between regular combat and confronting civilian violence.
   ``We are trained to destroy our enemy. But today we are fighting
on a different kind of front. What kind of a battleground is this?''
the narrator says, as a jeep is shown cruising through a dusty
refugee camp.
   Another segment shows a soldier firing his rifle repeatedly at
about a 45 degree angle on a street after being stoned by protesters.
   ``This is wrong. It is indiscriminate shooting. It causes many
casualties, sometimes innocent people,'' the narrator says.
   ``We need to maintain our self-control,'' the narrator adds,
after a scene in which a soldier says, ``I felt this incredible
anger. They were cursing at us, throwing stones, and we couldn't do
anything to stop it. I just wanted to grab someone and do
I-don't-know-what to him.''
   Gross said the film has been shown to all reservists sent to
patrol in Gaza since December and that a second film was being
produced about the West Bank.
   Soldiers also undergo two- or three-day sessions in which they
are taught how to deal with rioters, Gross said.
   Although the main goal is to reduce casualties, the troops also
are urged not to shy away from confrontations with protesters, he
added.
   ``We are trying to help soldiers cope with the dilemmas they
face, how to deal with morals and fulfill their mission best,''
Gross said. ``We also don't want to avoid contact or they (the
protesters) will gain ground and you find youselves pushed out to
main roads.''

   The Senate began its formal debate on John
Tower's troubled nomination as defense secretary today as two
additional Democrats joined the ranks of the opposition and a key
Republican insisted that confirmation is still ``winnable.''
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater conceded that
despite two days of personal lobbying, President Bush had ``not
yet'' been able to persuade any Democrats to line up in favor of
confirmation.
   Sen. Sam Nunn led off the long-awaited floor debate on the
nomination, and the Georgia Democrat who chairs the Armed Services
Committee said he was acting with a ``sense of sorrow'' in leading
the opposition to his former Senate colleague.
   Nunn said that when the committee began its hearings into Tower's
nomination he expected that he would in ``good faith support the
nominee. My mind was changed by the facts presented to the
committee,'' he said, adding he was concerned over Tower's drinking
habits, his work for the defense consulting industry and his
behavior toward women.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., in rebuttal for the Republicans,
extolled Tower for ``incalculable contributions'' to the United
States in 24 years in the Senate and later service on an arms
negotiationg team.
   He said 70 current senators served with Tower, and not one ``has
come forward to challenge in any way the discharge of his duties as
a United States senator. Not one.''
   Nunn predicted some ``vigorous debate'' over the next several
days _ a forecast almost certainly to be accurate with Republicans
trying to spend time marshaling public support on behalf of the
nomination.
   No Senate vote is expected until next week.
   Tower has been battling questions of drinking habits, allegations
of womanizing and questions over possible conflicts of interest
stemming from his work as a defense industry consultant.
   The debate began as aides to Sens. Alan Cranston of California
and Terry Sanford of North Carolina said both men would vote against
the nomination _ bringing the number of Democrats in opposition to
38.
   Appearing on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' several hours
earlier, Warner said, ``I think it's winnable in the sense that we
get the American public involved in this.
   ``And as soon as this debate starts I'm confident that they'll
communicate with the members of the Senate. It's important that we
not have a soap opera or a civil war in the Senate but a fair and
factual debate,'' said Warner, the ranking Republican on the Armed
Services Committee.
   Cranston, the Senate Democratic whip, said through an aide that
he would vote against the nomination.
   An aide to Sanford, Rafe Greenlee, said his boss had come to the
same conclusion after ``closely following the hearings and reading
the FBI report'' on Tower's background check.
   An Associated Press tally at midday showed 43 Democrats and
Republican Larry Pressler of South Dakota either solidly opposed or
leaning in opposition, and 40 Republicans either solidly or leaning
in favor.
   Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate.
   At the White House, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
President Bush still believes all allegations against Tower are
unfounded.
   He praised the nominee's combatative appearance on Wednesday at a
question-and-answer session at the National Press Club.
   ``We thought Senator Tower's performance yesterday was excellent.
It showed that he's a fighter and a scrappy guy and just the man to
take over the Defense Department,'' the spokesman said.
   Fitzwater said the White House is in full accord with Senate
Republican Leader Bob Dole's plans to delay a final vote on Tower.
   ``We think everybody should have a chance to register their vote.
And you never know, you might change (some) at the last minute,'' ''
Fitzwater said. But, when asked if the White House could name one
Democrat who had been won over, he said: ``Not yet.''
   Tower, meanwhile, attended a meeting this morning at the White
House with Bush, Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff; and acting Defense Secretary William H. Taft IV.
   Fitzwater said the meeting dealt with Pentagon management reforms
and an ongoing review of strategic issues, and not specifically with
Tower's confirmation battle.
   The developments came against a backdrop of the Republicans'
determination to wage a lengthy and vigorous Senate debate over
Tower, while the man at the center of the storm said he has no
intention of giving up.
   `Never surrender or retreat,'' the former Texas senator said at
his press club appearance Wednesday, quoting the commander of the
Texas forces at the Alamo.
   Tower renewed his vow to abstain from drinking if he is
confirmed. Asked if he had ever broken any previous pledges,
including wedding vows, the twice-divorced Tower said he had broken
marital vows.
   ``I think I probably am not alone in that connection,'' he added.
   Tower also said he would not return to the defense consulting
industry even if his confirmation fails.
   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, said there would be a ``vigorous''
debate on the Senate floor, adding that the issue involved is more
important than a single nomination.
   Bush met at the White House on Wednesday with additional senators
in his effort to win Democrats over to support the nomination. He
summarized his appeal this way:
   ``Do what you've got to do, but remember fair play, remember
decency and honor and then remember also historically the concept of
advice and consent where reasonable doubt is given historically to
the president of the United States who after all is responsible for
the executive branch of this government.''
   But if Bush's lobbying was paying dividends, there was no public
evidence of it.
   Sen. William Armstrong, R-Colo., complained in a speech that
information about Tower should be made public, rather than kept
hidden in a confidential FBI report. One senior administration
official, C. Boyden Gray, traveled to the Capitol during the day to
meet with key senators to discuss whether any of the information
could be made public.
   Some of the specific allegations against Tower have surfaced in
news reports. The Washington Post today quoted a retired Air Force
sergeant as saying Tower appeared drunk and fondled women on two
visits to Bergstrom Air Force Base in Texas, in 1976 and 1978.
   Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, dismissed those allegations
as ``more innuendo and rumor.''

   A Senate committee voted 10-0 today to confirm
Edward J. Derwinski as the first secretary of veterans affairs,
although the chairman criticized Derwinski for tipping off South
Koreans 12 years ago that one of their agents was about to defect.
   ``I conclude that what he did in 1977 was wrong and that the
entire record demonstrates that he has often not been candid or
forthcoming about it,'' said Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., chairman
of the Veterans Affairs Committee.
   However, when weighed against 30 years of service in Congress and
the State Department, ``I do not find his indiscretions as to this
one incident to be disqualifying,'' Cranston said.
   ``I am optimistic about Mr. Derwinski's potential to rise above
this unattractive episode, to put it behind him once and for all,''
Cranston said.
   Derwinski was questioned at length about his remarks on the
Korean defection in a private session of the committee on Tuesday
and again in public Wednesday.
   Derwinski, 62, a former congressman and State Department
official, was the ranking Republican member of a House committee
investigating the ``Koreagate'' scandal in September 1977 when he
was told by the committee staff that a Korean official was going to
defect.
   Derwinski said he encountered a Korean embassy official that day
on the steps of or near the Longworth House Office Building.
   ``In the process of the conversation, and without giving the
matter any serious thought, I casually observed something to the
effect that the next problem they would have with our committee was
one of their officials as a witness,'' he said.
   Derwinski said ``there was nothing malicious or intentional to
what I did,'' and contended, ``I honestly do not believe I ever
endangered anyone.''
   ``I also acknowledge it wasn't a very wise thing to do _ in fact
a rather stupid thing to do,'' Derwinski said.
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has examined the Korean
agent question twice before in Derwinski's 1983 and 1987
confirmations for State Department posts. Then the incident
attracted little attention.
   The veterans committee was unable to obtain information from a
grand jury that investigated the incident. Derwinski, under
questioning by Cranston, said that on the advice of his attorney he
had declined to answer questions from the grand jury, citing ``the
speech and debate clause'' of the Constitution on grounds of
``possible interference'' by another branch into his duties as a
congressman.
   Cranston said subsequent court rulings have narrowed the
interpretation of that clause so that it would no longer be
available as grounds to avoid answering questions in such a case.
   Derwinski had also faced allegations about links to alleged
former Nazi collaborators through his service on the National
Republican Heritage Groups Council, a GOP group aimed at attracting
ethnic voters. Cranston said that after reading a special FBI report
he was ``satisfied that the nominee has done nothing wrong.''
   Derwinski said he was unaware of the backgrounds of his
associates on the heritage committee.
   Derwinski, a 12-term Republican congressional veteran from
Illinois, was appointed counselor to the State Department in 1983
and later became under secretary for security assistance, science
and technology.
   Though the Korean affair attracted most attention, money problems
with veterans' programs were also a key topic for Derwinski and the
committee. VA officials have testified that they will be $600
million to $1 billion short in their medical care budget this year,
and Derwinski pledged to be an advocate for the VA budget before the
White House's office of management and budget.

<HEAD>Actor Continues To Oppose Mandatory Helmet Law Despite Crash</HEAD>

   Gary Busey, his head scarred from a
near-fatal motorcycle crash, says he still opposes mandatory helmet
laws _ a position ridiculed today by a government physician.
   The 44-year-old actor, in his first public appearance since the
crash Dec. 4, said Wednesday he ``could be a vegetable'' if he had
been wearing a helmet.
   Dr. Jeffrey Saks of the Centers for Disease Control's injury
control division said 4,000 motorcycle riders are killed each year
and 360,000 injured. ``Most of the deaths and serious disabilities
are due to head injuries, and ... helmets significantly reduce the
chances of a head injury,'' he said.
   About Busey's continued opposition to helmets, Sacks said, ``I'm
assuming he doesn't have residual brain damage that led to what he
said.''
   Busey said he plans to help raise money to fight helmet laws, as
he did before his accident. During a news conference Wednesday,
Busey's publicists distributed a pamphlet extolling helmetless
riding.
   In the crash, Busey's unprotected head struck a curb, and he
underwent brain surgery to remove two blood clots. He was
hospitalized for two months.
   A scar, starting near the top of Busey's right ear and continuing
to the top of his scalp, was visible underneath his short hair.
   Busey, who won an Oscar nomination as best actor for the title
role in the 1978 film ``The Buddy Holly Story,'' said he favored a
law mandating helmets only for motorcyclists ages 16 to 21. ``I felt
that way before the accident,'' he said.
   In fact, Busey insisted, ``I could have been more seriously
injured'' with a helmet. ``I could have broken my neck if I'd had on
a helmet.''
   Helmets ``cut down your peripheral vision, they cut off your
hearing and they stop your neck from rotating,'' he said.
   Busey looked fit and walked without any visible problems.
Although he said he was suffering some ``post-traumatic amnesia,''
Busey reported that his recovery was nearly 100 percent complete.
   He blamed his accident on excessive speed and an oil puddle. He
has yet to resume riding his motorcycle, which he said has been
repaired.
   Busey had just completed ``Hider in the House'' at the time of
the crash. Another film, ``Howling at the Moon,'' has been put on
hold pending his recovery.

<HEAD>Conference Called on Threat to Ozone Layer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists, industrialists and government officials
from around the world gather Sunday to discuss how to eliminate
synthetic chemicals that are destroying the Earth's ozone shield.
   More than 110 countries have accepted Britain's invitation to
attend the three-day conference ``Saving the Ozone Layer,'' said
Environment Secretary Nicholas Ridley.
   Scientists say compounds known as chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs,
are destroying the layer of ozone that shields the planet from the
sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays.
   They also trap heat and reflect it back to Earth, which gradually
warms the planet's surface and changes global weather patterns in a
phenomenon known as the ``Greenhouse Effect.''
   ``If you could stop the use of CFCs, you stop two major evils,''
Ridley said this week.
   The compounds, invented in 1930, are widely used in refrigerator
coolants, foam insulation, fast-food packaging, solvents and
propellants for aerosol spray cans.
   Thirty-one countries have agreed to reduce chlorofluorocarbon
emissions by 50 percent by the end of the century.
   On Thursday, ministers of the European Economic Community decided
to empower the 12-nation bloc to seek a complete ban by 1999.
   Britain has already vowed to halve its emissions by the end of
this year and to reduce total emissions by 85 percent by 1999.
   Several countries, including the United States, have banned the
use of the compounds in aerosol propellants, and Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher said Thursday that Britain will soon require all
new refrigerators to contain substances that would not harm the
ozone layer.
   Britain will lobby other nations to follow suit, Ridley said.
Emphasis will be placed on developing countries such as India and
China, which are gearing up for mass production of refrigerators and
other consumer goods containing the compounds, he said.
   The conference, to be opened by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi,
will hear first from scientists studying ozone depletion, then from
industrialists developing safe alternatives for some compounds.
   ``The big race now is on in industry, because the first industry
that can produce CFC-free products has the world as its oyster,''
said Lord Caithness, a junior environment minister.
   Government officials and ministers will conclude the conference
by discussing proposals to reduce the compounds, Ridley said. Mrs.
Thatcher, an Oxford University-educated chemist, will address the
conference, and William Reilly, designated head of the Environmental
Protection Agency, will represent the United States.
   The compounds and related chemicals known as halons, which are
used in firefighting equipment, can last more than 100 years. They
are stable and non-toxic at lower levels, but when they reach the
stratosphere, 15-25 miles up, they are broken up by ultraviolet
radiation and their chlorine atoms destroy the ozone.
   Over the Antarctic, an ozone hole _ an area where ozone has been
seriously depleted _ is worsening, according to the British
government's Stratospheric Ozone Review Group. The group reported
that ozone concentration was reduced by more than 95 percent in some
parts.
   An international expedition warned in February that the
atmosphere over the Arctic region is also primed for a large
destruction of ozone.
   The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration reported
last year that annual ozone depletion over the Northern Hemisphere's
mid-latitudes is also much higher than thought. The protective
shield appears to have shrunk by about 2.3 percent since 1969 over
the area, which includes most of the United States and Canada, NASA
said.
   Scientists have also warned that a thinning of the ozone layer
would increase the numbers of skin cancers. According to the
Greenpeace environmental group, each 1 percent depletion is
estimated to increase the incidence of skin cancers by around 4
percent.
   Ridley said the London conference will end without a formal
agreement or signed declaration, but ``we want them to accept the
political urgency of cooperating worldwide.
   ``We are trying to get everybody to sign up to the concept that
we should get rid of them as soon as possible.''

   Legendary surf rocker Dick Dale's
first electric guitar, plucked from the International Surfing Museum
six weeks ago, was returned this week by a woman who wanted her
identity kept secret.
   ``Some good vibes are happening,'' Dale said.
   ``Boy, what a great feeling,'' added the man known as the king of
the surf guitar. ``It all started off that guitar.''
   The ivory-colored guitar was taken last month in a burglary of
the museum's former site here, leaving members of the fledgling
museum board heartbroken over the loss of their most valuable
artifact.
   News of the theft spread, and the Stroh Brewery Co. in Detroit
offered a $1,000 reward for its return.
   Natalie Kotsch of the museum board said a woman called Tuesday
claiming to know the guitar's whereabouts, and on Wednesday showed
up at Ms. Kotsch's real-estate office lugging an old brown guitar
case that held the instrument.
   Except for a few new nicks, the guitar appeared to be in good
shape.
   The woman, a Huntington Beach resident in her 20s who was afraid
to give her name, found the guitar by ``tracking down rumors she
heard on the street,'' Ms. Kotsch said.
   ``She got it from the guy who bought it from the guy who stole
it,'' Ms. Kotsch said. ``She is going to split the $1,000 reward
with the guy who bought it (for $100).''
   The guitar and the museum's other artifacts are in storage
awaiting a late April opening of a new museum to replace the old
building, which was demolished to make way for a downtown
development.
   ``We're going to ensure its safety, you can believe me,'' Ms.
Kotsch said.

   Former church secretary Jessica Hahn went
on the air Thursday in the city where Jim Bakker built his PTL
television ministry, and the first thing she did was send a message
to his wife.
   ``Tammy, if you're listening, happy birthday,'' Hahn said.
   Hahn, whose 1980 sexual encounter with Bakker led to his ouster
from PTL, fielded questions from WRFX radio listeners and scheduled
a lunch date with the winners of a contest.
   She had kind words for the evangelist and his wife.
   ``Just because Jim and Tammy screwed up, that doesn't mean God
won't have a place for them,'' she said. ``Their hearts were in the
right place. They won't be forgotten.''
   Hahn, who is featured in a rock video version of ``Wild Thing''
by comedian Sam Kinison, said she enjoys her celebrity status.
   ``I am 29, I'm a girl and I'm having fun,'' she said.

   Televangelists Jim and Tammy Bakker
are trying to sell their desert condominium for $260,000 to raise
money to support their new ``Jim and Tammy'' show, a real estate
agent said.
   Agent Emma Howard, a friend of the Bakkers, said the
1,800-square-foot condominium with two master bedrooms and an office
will be featured Monday on a real estate showcase program broadcast
on local cable channels.
   The Bakkers ``are trying to raise money to stay on the air'' and
have been too busy with the show to return to the Desert Falls
Country Club condo they bought in March 1988, Ms. Howard said.
   The new ``Jim and Tammy'' show from Pineville, N.C., started in
January, about two years after Bakker resigned as president of the
PTL ministry amid allegations of financial misdealings and an affair
with church secretary Jessica Hahn.
   A woman answering the phone at the North Carolina offices of Jim
and Tammy Ministries would not confirm the property is for sale.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev turned 58
Thursday, but there were no cakes and candles for the Kremlin chief.
   Birthdays, generally celebrated with cakes and parties for
Americans, go all but unnoticed in the Soviet Union.
   Most Soviets do not know the date of Gorbachev's birth, and the
press does not make official note of birthdays or other personal
holidays of high-ranking officials.
   But Tass, the Soviet news agency, mentioned Gorbachev's birthday
in a daily almanac. Gorbachev marks the fourth anniversary of being
named Communist Party general secretary on March 11.

   Lead singer J.P. Pennington has left the
popular country band Exile to spend more time with his family and
write music.
   Pennington, the last original member of the group, officially
left Dec. 31, according to band members. Exile started as a rock
band in the mid-1960s.
   ``He said, `I want to be at home with my family,''' Exile drummer
Steve Goetzman said, adding that there had been no attempt to keep
Pennington's departure ``under wraps.''
   ``It took some some time to figure how we were going to deal with
the situation,'' he added. ``As soon as it happened, we decided to
continue.''
   When Exile's publicists recently released new photos and profiles
of the band members, Pennington didn't appear in any of the material.
   Exile will continue with its four remaining members: Goetzman,
rhythm guitarist Paul Martin, keyboardist Lee Carroll and bassist
Sonny Lemaire.

   The Soviet Union's ambassador, casting his
country in a mediator's role, said Thursday that the furor over
Salman Rushdie's novel, ``The Satanic Verses,'' was extremely
dangerous and depended for a solution on respect for everyone's
religious feelings.
   ``These are general human rights, and they should be respected,''
Yuri V. Dubinin, the Soviet ambassador, said at a news conference in
which he steered clear of the widespread condemnation of Iranian
death threats against the author.
   But he stressed that the Soviets ``feel the whole situation is
very, very dangerous'' and that in trying to defuse it ``the skill,
the science, the art, is to be balanced and to avoid all kind of
conflicts.''
   Dubinin acknowledged there was widespread condemnation of the
threats by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and other Iranian clerics
who consider the novel to be heretical to Islam. But, he said,
``actions and reactions are very, very dangerous, and we think also
that if we continue not to be active it would be very harmful to the
whole atmosphere.''
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze paid a recent
visit to Tehran. Relations with Moscow, which Iran had denounced in
the past _ along with the United States _ as ``the Great Satan,''
are improving.
   Dubinin, fielding questions for more than an hour, also said
Secretary of State James A. Baker III probably would visit the
Soviet Union in late April or early May.
   The Soviet ambassador said he hoped arrangements would be made
next week in Vienna at a meeting between Baker and Shevardnadze
prior to the opening of new arms control negotiations between the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact.
   It will be their first meeting, and Dubinin said ``we hope it
will serve to establish a good personal contact and pave the way to
a visit to the Soviet Union.''
   The Soviet diplomat said U.S.-Soviet relations had improved and
``we shall not be found wanting'' in further moves to reduce
tensions. ``There is a strong realization that military solutions
are not possible,'' Dubinin said.
   On another subject, Dubinin renewed a Soviet offer to restore
diplomatic ties with Israel after a 22-year break if Israel agreed
to negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   He urged U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to
appoint a special mediator to spur talks on the Arab-Israeli
conflict. And Dubinin said the Middle East should be declared a zone
free of nuclear and chemical weapons as well as terrorism.
   In the two-week furor over the Rushdie book, Baker has publicly
denounced the threats as ``regrettable'' while Charles E. Redman,
the State Department spokesman, called them ``abhorrent.''
   On Wednesday, Redman said the State Department had asked
Shevardnadze before he went to Tehran ``to raise concerns with the
Iranians.'' Referring to the public outcry, Redman said ``we believe
it's high time the Soviets speak up.''
   At the same time, the U.S. spokesman seemed to question the
Soviets' diplomatic intercession. ``As far as one can see, there is
nothing here that involves mediation,'' Redman said. ``What is
required is a condemnation of a death threat. It's clearly
unacceptable and shouldn't exist.''
   Dubinin said Shevardnadze would discuss the situation in Moscow
with Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez-Ordonez, who will
meet with him in behalf of the 12-nation European Community, and
then in Vienna with Baker and other foreign ministers.
   ``Our position is that the situation is viewed in the Soviet
Union with concern,'' Dubinin said. ``Unless a reasonable solution
is found, the consequences could be unpredictable.''

<HEAD>Ruling Prohibits Utility From Randomly Drug Testing Electrical Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An arbitrator's ruling barred Georgia Power Co.
from randomly testing 6,400 electrical workers for drug use but said
the company may be allowed to randomly test employees with
particularly dangerous jobs.
   Arbitrator Richard Bloch said the decision Tuesday is the first
such ruling to affect a utility company's employees other than those
working in nuclear power plants.
   The ruling was in response to a complaint last fall by the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. The complaint, made
to the National Labor Relations Board, was referred to binding
arbitration.
   Howard Winkler, Georgia Power's coordinator of labor relations,
said the company would evaluate all jobs and decide which jobs are
dangerous enough to justify drug screening.
   However, union attorney J. Michael Walls said any new policy
would likely be challenged again.
   The company began random urinalysis tests of its 2,600
supervisors in December and was to start screening the rest of its
workers Wednesday. But the company will now postpone the program for
the 6,400 unionized workers covered by the decision and the 6,000
other employees who were not, Winkler said.

<HEAD>General Says Moslem Army Units Will Confront Israel in South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The commander of Moslem units in the
Lebanese army, which like the country is divided on sectarian lines,
says he will send a mechanized infantry battalion to fight Israel in
the south.
   Maj. Gen. Sami Khatib's intention to dispatch the 500 soldiers
Friday represented a policy shift by the military, which has kept
out of Israel's battle with Palestinian and Moslem guerrillas in
south Lebanon, where Israel occupies a strip of land just north of
its frontier.
   ``Israel is much stronger than we are. We don't have the weapons
Israel has; we don't have their technology and their army outnumbers
us. ... But we should confront Israel,'' he said in an interview
Wednesday at his home in Moslem west Beirut.
   Khatib commands about 22,000 soldiers based in Moslem territory
south of Beirut and along the coast, and Gen. Michel Aoun has 20,000
Christian troopers in Christian territory north and east of the
capital.
   The army divided when Moslem militias drove Christian units from
west Beirut in February 1984, nine years into Lebanon's sectarian
civil war. Aoun technically commanded the entire army, however,
until a dispute over the presidential succession created two
governments last fall.
   Khatib, 55, did not say whether his troops would initiate action
against the Israelis, but indicated they would have a greater part
in defensive operations when the Israelis and their predominantly
Christian surrogate militia penetrated beyond the border ``security
zone.''
   Although army units have been caught in crossfire several times,
the Lebanese military has not fought a major engagement with Israel
for more than 16 years.
   ``We have our strong belief in our homeland,'' Khatib said. ``We
have our dignity and we should honor our belonging to the Arab
nation. ... We should confront Israel.
   ``This doesn't mean that we have to commit suicide, but we can't
be indifferent toward Israel. We'll fight and try to hamper the
enemy's advance as much as we can.''
   He declared, with a shake of his fist for emphasis: ``This is our
destiny as we see it.''
   Khatib said he was moving the reinforcement battalion to south
Lebanon to support the approximately 3,000 soldiers deployed in the
area.
   ``I expect an Israeli operation at any time,'' said the general,
a former inteligence officer who trained in the United States in
1967. ``The Lebanese army can only regain its confidence and justify
its existence by confronting our traditional enemy, Israel.''
   Lebanon's military split became complete when President Amin
Gemayel's six-year term ended with no successor elected because
right-wing Christians opposed candidates chosen by Syria, the
country's main power broker.
   Christian and Moslem governments emerged from the crisis, with
the Christian cabinet led by Aoun, a Maronite Catholic chosen by
Gemayel as caretaker prime minister when his term expired.
   Moslems refused to accept Aoun's authority and acting Prime
Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni who heads the Moslem cabinet, appointed
Khatib commander of Moslem army units.
   By longstanding agreement, Lebanon's president is Christian, the
prime minister Sunni Moslem and the Parliament speaker Shiite.
   Syria, which has 40,000 soldiers stationed in Lebanon, supports
Khatib's command.
   In the interview, Khatib said his troops would coordinate with
the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, the peacekeepers sent to south
Lebanon to implement Security Council Resolution 425.
   The resolution was passed after Israeli forces withdrew from
Lebanon in 1978 after an invasion intended to crush Palestinian
guerrillas. It calls for unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces
and deployment of the 5,800 peacekeepers along the border.
   The U.N. forces, whose operational area overlaps the Israeli
buffer zone, have not been able to patrol the border because Israel
refuses to pull back.
   Israel invaded again in June 1982 and established the ``security
zone,'' which ranges in depth from six to 10 miles, when its army
withdrew three years later.
   Moslem army units are based in the southern coastal towns of
Sidon, Zahrani and Tyre. Their closest positions to the Israelis are
around Zaghdraya, about 12 miles north of the zone.
   The Lebanese army did not resist the invasions. Its last major
clash with Israel was in September 1972, when it faced tank columns
chasing Palestinian guerrillas in south Lebanon. Thirteen Lebanese
soldiers were killed.

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Army said Thursday it is
baffled by the disappearance of a ``good, clean-cut'' American
soldier who had access to classified information and vanished near
the East German border.
   An Army spokesman, Lt. Col. Jake Dye, said there was not enough
information to say if Spec. 4 Michael A. Peri had defected. Dye
acknowledged a portable computer was missing from an intelligence
office where Peri worked.
   Peri, of Laguna Niguel, Calif., has been listed as ``absent
without leave'' since he failed to show up for work Feb. 21 at the
11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in Fulda, 65 miles northeast of
Frankfurt.
   Two days later, officials searching for Peri found his U.S. Army
vehicle undamaged near the border town of Obersuhl, about 35 miles
northeast of Fulda.
   ``Peri was authorized to drive the vehicle and had logged it out
properly,'' Dye said.
   Stars and Stripes, the Army's unofficial newspaper, quoted Dye as
saying ``the circumstances of that vehicle being found so close to
the border are definitely suspicious.''
   Dye told The Associated Press later the newspaper was putting it
``a little too strongly,'' but he didn't deny making the statement.
   Peri worked as an electronics warfare signal specialist and was
responsible for operating equipment that identifies and locates
non-communications signals, such as radar. He has been stationed in
West Germany since March 4, 1988.
   Asked about the possibility Peri defected, Dye said, ``We
certainly have no reason to believe that. There were no signs of
distress according to his colleagues and family. We just don't have
any indications.''
   Peri had an ``active normal social life'' and a ``perfect record
as a good clean-cut soldier,'' Dye said.
   ``In fact, he had been promoted and nominated for `Soldier of the
Month' twice in the year he has been here,'' Dye added. ``That's
what makes it so baffling. From all indications, everybody in his
unit has the same feelings. They're all very surprised.''
   Dye confirmed the Stars and Stripes report that a portable
computer was missing from the office where Peri had worked. But Dye
said Peri ``had not progressed very far in computers except for
basic word processing.''
   A search of Peri's living quarters showed he had left his
personal belongings behind, Dye said.
   The spokesman said investigators are looking into all
possibilites, including foul play.
   In March 1987, former U.S. Pvt. Wade E. Roberts defected with his
West German girlfriend to the Soviet Union from a U.S. Army unit in
Giessen, about 40 miles north of Frankfurt. Roberts returned to the
United States in November 1987 and was court-martialed as a deserter.

<HEAD>Official English Remains Controversial Months after Passage in 3
States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four months after voters passed ``official
English'' amendments in Colorado, Arizona and Florida, the effect is
far from clear, with supporters and opponents remain split over the
measures' legal meaning.
   In Arizona, a state employee's lawsuit challenging the
constitutionality of the amendment is pending in U.S. District Court.
   The author of the Colorado amendment has criticized the governor
and Denver's mayor for issuing executive orders directing that
bilingual government information still be provided. There's also a
lawsuit filed by opponents pending, seeking to get the measure
thrown out on technical grounds.
   In Florida, the furor has subsided somewhat since a Miami-area
grocery clerk was fired for speaking Spanish in front of customers.
The store agreed to rehire the clerk. And the Legislature has taken
no steps to pass laws to put the ballot measure into effect.
   ``All this law has done is take support away from other issues
that really need it,'' said Dorothy J. Porter, director of the
Colorado Civil Rights Division. ``We should be spending money to
improve relations between the races and I don't think this has done
that.''
   The Colorado measure, which won the approval of 64 percent of
voters, asked simply: ``Shall there be an amendment to the Colorado
constitution to delare that the English language is the official
language of the state of Colorado?''
   Supporters believe that means official government business should
be conducted in English, and say the amendment could be be used as
ammunition in lawsuits aimed at changing private conduct, such as
employers who require Spanish language facility for some jobs. They
say the law is necessary because of complaints from some people that
their rights were being violated because they could not speak a
foreign language.
   Opponents say the law is unclear and unnecessary. They see it as
an attack on their heritage and fear it will force them to renounce
their language and learn English.
   Colorado Attorney General Duane Woodard said, ``I have no idea
what that law means.''
   ``The amendment is very short. It says English is the official
language of Colorado. If that's the case, what about federal laws
that override it?'' he asked. Federal laws limit discrimination
against minorities in such areas as housing and jobs, and
requirement some government documents, such as ballots, to be
multilingual.
   Opponents say there have already been several incidents in which
citizens took the law into their own hands and tried to enforce it.
Porter said there was the public school bus driver in Grand Junction
who ordered children to stop speaking Spanish and the fast-food
restaurant worker who was fired for translating a menu into Spanish.
   But state Rep. Barbara Phillips, who led the campaign to pass the
amendment in Colorado, says those were ``regrettable''
misunderstandings that had nothing to do with official English.
   ``Those things happened before the amendment was passed, and they
will continue to happen,'' she said. ``Our concern is with
government actions. Our amendment was designed to prevent
discrimination, not cause it.''
   Phillips says the measure has been a success because there have
been no major complaints of discrimination since it was passed.
   But she has accused Colorado Gov. Roy Romer and Denver Mayor
Federico Pena, the city's first Hispanic mayor, of violating their
responsibilities by issuing executive orders that bilingual
government information still be provided.
   ``That was the whole purpose of the amendment in the first
place,'' she said. ``Sixty-four percent of the people in this state
said they don't want that. We want to make sure the governor
complies with the constitution.''
   Pena, who issued an executive order warning city officials that
the issue is potentially dangerous, said the purpose of the
executive order was to make sure no one was the victim of
discrimination.
   ``If the sponsors of the English-only initiative find that
troubling, then that means the commitment and promises they made
during their campaign were not correct,'' Pena said. ``During their
campaign, they said the amendment was not to discriminate against
anyone or deprive them of their rights, but only to ensure that some
other language would not be made the official one.''
   Florida's measure passed by an overwhelming majority, even though
it was opposed by most state officials from the governor on down.
The measure empowers the Legislature to implement it, but so far
there has been no enacting legislation. Without such a measure, the
amendment has no legal effect.
   However, the Florida amendment also has caused problems. A
Miami-area grocery store clerk lost his job for speaking Spanish in
front of customers. The store eventually agreed to rehire him
because of negative publicity.
   In Arizona, the official English measure is more specific, but
also contains broad exceptions. It calls for state and local
government actions and documents to be in English, except for
certain cases such as to comply with federal laws, to protect rights
of criminal defendants and victims of crime, and to protect public
safety.
   Within days of passage, a state employee challenged the Arizona
measure's constitutionality in a lawsuit, claiming she feared she
could be disciplined if she spoke Spanish while working. A state
legislator later joined the suit, saying the law could prevent him
from communicating with his constituents in Spanish. The lawsuit is
pending, although the state has asked a judge to dismiss it.
   Phillips said the purpose of official English is not to divide
the community, but to unite it behind a common language.
   ``That's not divisive, that's unity. ... It's the law,'' she
said. ``After all, we won.''

<TEXT>
   Roman Catholic church leaders say 20,000
people displaced from their homes by fighting in northern Uganda
face death from starvation and disease unless emergency food and
medicine are provided soon.
   ``The displaced people are faced with a difficult situation
because they have no food, clothes and medical care,'' the Rev.
Francis Exavi Ocaya was quoted as saying by the newspaper Munno on
Thursday.
   Munno said Ocaya, who works in northern Uganda, was speaking at
Wednesday's opening session of church information officials from
Uganda's 14 dioceses in Entebbe, about 17 miles south of Kampala.
   Bishop Joseph Mukwaya, speaking at the same meeting, appealed to
all Ugandans, regardless of their faith, to send food to the
displaced people, whom he described as ``brothers and sisters in
need.''
   Ocaya said some people had started returning to their villages
after peace had been restored, only to find their homes, crops and
granaries had been destroyed in fighting between President Yoweri
Museveni's troops and the rebels.
   Government troops launched an offensive against remnants of the
rebel Holy Spirit Movement in November. Officials have acknowledged
at least 100,000 people fled the countryside and camped around the
district capital of Gulu, 210 miles north of Kampala.
   Self-proclaimed warrior priestess Alice Lakwena started the Holy
Spirit Movement in 1986. Government troops halted her poorly
equipped warriors' southward march a year later. She fled to Kenya,
but her followers regrouped in northern Uganda.
   During the current campaign, both the government troops and the
rebels have accused each other of committing atrocities against
civilians.
   In December, however, Amnesty International, the London-based
human rights organization, accussed Museveni's soldiers of
indiscriminately killing unarmed civilians, destroying their homes
and setting farms and granaries afire.
   The Holy Spirit Movement is one of 10 groups that have fought
Museveni's 3-year-old government.

<HEAD>EPA Again Seeks Legal Power to Act Faster on Pesticides</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency again asked
Congress Thursday for authority to act faster in ordering dangerous
pesticides off the market.
   John Moore, acting deputy EPA administrator, told the House
Agriculture Committee's government operations subcommittee that he
frequently hears remarks, made in a tone of incredulity, about EPA
pesticide decisions such as, ``You want to cancel its use but can't
get around to it for four years?''
   ``We've got to find a process that can be done in real time. The
current process doesn't comport with real time,'' Moore said,
repeating a complaint by the agency that current law permits
excessive delays in regulatory actions.
   Currently, the agency proposes pesticide actions for public
comment, receives comment for a month or two, studies the comments
and comes to a final decision. This can take 15 to 18 months.
   The license-holder _ typically the manufacturer _ may appeal to
an administrative hearing, and then to the federal courts. Though
use restrictions are frequently accepted by manufacturers, orders to
end use are almost always appealed.
   During those hearings, which may last years, the pesticide stays
on the market _ and the hearing officer ``does not build upon what
has gone before,'' Moore said, forcing EPA and all other parties to
start over from square one.
   EPA could declare an emergency and force an immediate end to use,
but the data rarely show a large enough danger to justify it, he
said.
   ``Excuse the pun, but the registrant gets three bites at the
apple,'' the comment period, the agency hearings and the courts,
Moore said.
   The subcommittee and its parent committee included a streamlined
hearing process in a proposed overhaul of pesticide law two years
ago, but set the topic aside as too controversial in last year's
package of changes.
   That package did eliminate one bar to emergency action by
dropping the requirement that EPA buy up inventories when its rare
emergency bans are imposed.
   Rep. George E. Brown Jr., D-Calif., who heads the subcommittee,
and Rep. Pat Roberts of Kansas, the senior Republican member, were
sympathetic to Moore's complaints. Roberts said he soon would
introduce legislation.
   Moore took the opportunity of his testimony to denounce again a
study by the Natural Resources Defense Council released Monday that
said pesticide residues on food pose a significant risk of cancer
for young children. At the time, the agency said it was taking into
account the facts of young diets that the group said it was ignoring.
   Some calls to the agency from parents ``border on hysteria,''
Moore said.
   ``In my opinion the public is being misled by the ominous
rhetoric of these reports. ... It's way out of proportion to
reality.''
   He said a detailed examination of the NRDC work showed that the
group had used in its calculations out-of-date residue and other
data for one pesticide that EPA's independent scientific advisers
judged useless for estimating risk. EPA estimates the risk of this
pesticide, the apple growth regulator daminozide, at only 1 percent
of what NRDC estimates, and half the difference in estimates is
accounted for by the out-of-date data.
   The agency has said it expects in 18 months or so to order a ban
on daminozide, which it has been studying since 1979, because of its
cancer-causing potential.

<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha, still
recovering from a stroke suffered six weeks ago, said Thursday he
plans to return to work at the end of March.
   Botha, 73, gave no indication of possible retirement plans
despite the widespread speculation that he may soon step down.
   He returned to his Cape Town office Thursday and met with several
Cabinet members, including acting president Chris Heunis and F.W. de
Klerk, Botha's successor as leader of the National Party and the
heir apparent to the presidency.
   Botha's office visit was the first indication he has resumed
working since he suffered a stroke Jan. 18. Officials have said
Botha has not participating in the day-to-day activities of the
government while he has been recuperating at his home in Wilderness,
210 miles east of Cape Town.
   ``I intend to return from my private residence ... the week after
the Easter weekend (March 25-26),'' Botha said in a statement. ``I
will then resume my task as state president.''
   Botha's only public appearance since his stroke was television
footage two weeks ago that showed his left arm shaking noticeably.
   Some observers have questioned whether Botha's health will hamper
his ability to function as president and even some members of the
National Party have suggested he retire.
   ``South Africa wants F.W. de Klerk as president,'' Hendrik
Schoeman, a former Cabinet minister and member of Parliament said
Wednesday night when introducing de Klerk at a National Party rally.
``For the sake of the National Party, President Botha should now
give F.W. de Klerk a chance,'' Schoeman said.
   Botha's policies of gradual race reform have stalled in recent
years, and some National Party members have hinted a new leader is
needed even though de Klerk appears to endorse most of Botha's
agenda.
   Both men call for limited reforms that will increase the rights
of blacks, but preserve segregated white neighborhoods and schools
and keep political power in the hands of the white minority.
   Botha was chosen as prime minister in 1978 and became president
in 1984 when South Africa adopted a new constitution.

<HEAD>Monument to be Closed at Solstice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stonehenge, the ancient monument that is thronged
with latter-day Druids every summer, will be closed to the public
for the summer solstice, it was announced Thursday.
   English Heritage said it was taking the action reluctantly on the
advice of police, who have had to cope with thousands of rowdy
celebrants each June.
   ``It is like closing Westminster Abbey at Christmas,'' protested
Rollo Maughfling, Arch Druid of the Glastonbury Order.
   Francis Golding, head of English Heritage properties, said
Stonehenge would probably be closed for 24 hours.
   In the last 10 years, the problems associated with convoys of
travelers have disrupted the Salisbury plain. Last year 1,300 police
were involved in a $700,000 operation to escort and restrain the
celebrants, who call themselves hippies. There were 67 arrests and
10 injuries on the day of the solstice.
   Wiltshire Chief Constable Walter Girven said any convoys of
travelers entering the county would be warned there was nowhere for
them to go. If they persisted in gathering near Stonehenge they
would be arrested, he said.
   ``Unfortunately over the last 10 years there has been an
increasing amount of violence occuring at the occasion of the
solstice,'' Girven said.
   ``The solstice has been used as an excuse for moving into the
county, camping illegally, committing offenses and creating a
considerable amount of disturbance to the inhabitants of Wiltshire.''
   Maughfling called the decision ``a gross violation of religious
freedom.''
   He said his group intended to seek a judicial review and take the
issue to the European Commission of Human Rights.
   They were also taking legal advice on whether a private action
against the authorities would be possible.
   ``We and other members of the Druid Orders of Great Britain feel
that a great mistake may well be made here and leading to much worse
consequences than keeping the monument open,'' Maughfling said.
   ``Closing Stonehenge, we feel, will only add fuel to the fire,
inciting further unnecessary violence at even greater cost to both
tax and ratepayer.''

<HEAD>USDA to Review Proposal for Tests of Genetically Altered Carp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposal by Auburn University to field test
genetically altered carp will be reviewed later this month, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   The proposal will be taken up March 22-23 at a meeting of the
department's Agricultural Biotechnology Research Advisory Committee,
along with other business on the panel's agenda.
   Alvin Young, director of the department's Office of Biotechnology
and executive secretary of the committee, said the experimental carp
have already received a growth hormone gene from trout and will soon
be ready for testing in an outdoor pond.
   The purpose of the gene is to help the fish reach full market
size in less time with less feed. Such experiments could help fish
farmers, satisfy consumer demand for more fish, and shed new light
on transferring genes into fish, he said.

<TEXT>
   A newspaper said today that State Department
officials have held secret talks with guerrillas in El Salvador in
an attempt to resolve the conflict in that country. U.S. officials
denied the report.
   Spain's leading daily El Pais also said State Department
officials and representatives of the leftist Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front, or the FMLN, will meet again this week in
Washington. The paper based its report on unidentified sources in El
Salvador and Mexico.
   ``The United States does not have talks or negotiations with the
FMLN,'' State Department spokesman Charles Redman said in
Washington. The United States supports El Salvador's government in
its 9-year-old war with the front.
   El Pais correspondent Antonio Cano quoted the sources as saying
the talks began in January and were the first between U.S. officials
and the guerrilla leaders since the war began. It said the talks had
substantially influenced recent developments in El Salvador.
   But the report said the talks did not solve the conflict, in part
because of President Bush's lack of a clear foreign policy in
Central America.
   Redman said the United States maintains contacts with all
political parties in El Salvador. He noted that a leftist
presidential candidate, Guillermo Ungo, has been in Washington this
week for talks with administration officials and congressional
leaders.
   The paper said the first contacts took place in Washington from
Jan. 20-23 between middle-level guerrilla leaders and members of the
Bush administration and Congress. The paper said the guerrillas
promised they would no longer consider U.S. interests in El Salvador
military targets.
   State Department officials said the El Pais report apparently
referred to an appearance by FMLN representatives at the department
six weeks ago when they dropped off a peace proposal. The department
officials read the document, asked for some clarifications, then
told the visitors they should discus it with the Salvadoran
government, said the officials, who asked not to be identified.
   They said there have been no contacts with the FMLN since then.

<HEAD>Navy Makes Significant Changes Since Recruit's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Significant changes have been made at the
Navy Rescue Swimmer School since a 19-year-old recruit drowned a
year ago Thursday, Navy officials say.
   Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki of Appleton, Wis., died when
instructors forced him back into a training pool at Pensacola Naval
Air Station and held his head under water after he had panicked
during a rescue drill and climbed out of the water.
   Other students were ordered to face away during the episode and
sing the national anthem.
   A stressful exercise that was being conducted at the time has
been banned, and instructors now are prohibited from touching
students. Strickter safety monitoring also was ordered.
   ``To some extent, they must have learned their lesson,'' said
Mirecki's sister, Lynn Johansen of Appleton.
   She and other relatives have filed a $20 million claim against
the Navy, accusing officials of intentionally inflicting emotional
distress by first reporting the drowning as an accident and of
negligence in letting Mirecki continue the class even though he had
been diagnosed as having a phobia about being held under water.
   The claim is intended to make the Navy more responsive, Ms.
Johansen said. ``We're just trying to make sure that it doesn't
happen again.''
   Criminal charges were filed against six Navy men. One instructor
was convicted of negligent homicide and sentenced to 90 days in the
brig, while four other people were given administrative punishments
of fines or rank reductions.
   The officer in charge of the school was acquitted of dereliction
of duty in a separate court-martial, but his commanding officer was
given a letter of reprimand just prior to retiring.
   Since the changes were made last June, 187 students have
graduated with 18 more scheduled to complete the course Friday, said
Capt. J.W. Dickson, who became commanding officer of the Naval
Aviation Schools Command after Mirecki's death.
   ``We think the quality of the students is every bit as good,''
Dickson said.
   But attorneys at the court-martials had argued that now-banned
practices, including physically forcing scared or tired students to
participate in drills, was necessary for realistic training to make
students ready for emergencies. Navy rescuers must be prepared to
jump from hovering helicopters to rescue pilots downed at sea.
   No real assessment can be made until new graduates are required
to make rescues, Dickson said.
   But most have only recently reached their duty stations, and
statistics show only about half of the Navy's 1,200 rescue swimmers
make a single rescue every three years, Dickson said. The rest of
the time they do other work while awaiting an emergency call.

<HEAD>Poll Says Most People Have More Trouble with Cable TV than with Phones</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most people have more trouble with their cable
television service than with their telephones and they think the
situation would improve if competitors were allowed into the cable
TV market, according to a telephone industry poll released Thursday.
   The United States Telephone Association said the poll of 6,435
people backed its contention that local phone companies should be
allowed to compete with cable television operators. Congress this
year may consider allowing phone companies into the cable TV arena.
   Sixty-eight percent of those contacted believed their cable
service would improve if competitors were allowed to enter the cable
market. Typically, local governments only allow one cable franchise.
   Fifty-seven percent of the respondents said local telephone
companies should be able to provide cable services.
   ``Findings indicated that phone service is much more reliable
than cable service, with interruptions in cable service occurring
twice as often as interruptions in phone service,'' said Kennan
Research &amp; Consulting Inc., which conducted the poll by telephone
during the week of Oct. 31. ``Survey data indicates consumers view
their local telephone company as more responsive and accessible to
their service needs.''
   It said four out of every five households reported problem-free
phone service during the previous year, while nearly half the cable
households had their cable service interrupted during the same
period.
   The poll said that while 30 percent of the respondents said that
being able to choose between cable providers would not affect them
at all, 53 percent felt it would be to their advantage. Only 4
percent predicted negative effects from the competition.
   The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 1.2 percentage
points.
   Forty-nine percent said their cable service was out during the
previous year, while 48 percent said it wasn't. Seventy-one percent
said their service was restored promptly, and 7 percent said it was
not restored promptly.
   Nineteen percent said their phone service was out of order during
the same period, while 80 percent said it wasn't. Eighty-seven
percent said their phone service was restored promptly, while 13
percent said it wasn't.
   Sixty-eight percent said they believed their cable company would
provide better service if it had competition, while 17 percent said
they believed it would not.
   Fifty-seven percent said their local telephone company should be
permitted to offer cable TV service in competition with the local
cable TV company. Twenty-eight percent said the phone company should
not be allowed to compete.

   Former Sen. Barry Goldwater accused John
Tower's Senate critics of hypocrisy Thursday, claiming ``there'd be
no government'' if everyone guilty of drinking or womanizing was run
out of town.
   ``People who live in glass houses should never throw rocks,'' the
always outspoken Goldwater told reporters after he met with
President Bush and discussed the troubled Tower nomination.
   ``There are some strange things going on down in that old
Senate,'' said the former Arizona senator, who retired in 1986 after
a career spanning more than three decades.
   Goldwater, who served with Tower on the Armed Services Committee
and chaired the panel in 1985 and 1986, said that no one had yet
come forth with proof that Tower had ever been incapacitated with
alcohol.
   ``Yeah, he drank. I had a few with him,'' Goldwater said. ``That
he chased a few women? Hearsay. I don't give a damn whether he did
or not. But I don't like the Senate working on innuendo, on facts
that have never been proven.''
   ``I've been around this town a long, long time. If they chased
every man or woman out of this town who shacked up with somebody
else, or gotten drunk, there'd be no government. So I think that the
Senate better start looking at facts.''
   The 1964 Republican presidential candidate voiced particular
displeasure with Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee and a leading opponent of Tower's nomination.
   ``I'm amazed at Sam Nunn. I'm one of those Republicans who had
been hoping he'd run for president. But to come out as he has,
against Tower, and only on the basis of drinking, I can't believe
it.''
   ``I'm frankly shocked that they could allow partisan politics
creep into this thing,'' he added.
   ``I would say there's a lot of hypocrisy in it,'' Goldwater said.
   ``If they start investigating 100 members of that Senate as
they've investigated John Tower, you people are going to have a
ball,'' Goldwater told reporters outside the White House.

   Audrey Hepburn, who says she has rejected
hundreds of scripts since making ``They All Laughed'' eight years
ago, is looking for a mature film role.
   ``It would be fun to do another part before I roll over,'' Ms.
Hepburn, 59, said in Sunday's issue of Parade magazine.
   ``People are inclined to send scripts to me for which the parts
are too young,'' said Ms. Hepburn. ``I'd love to do a picture with
Michael Caine or Michael Douglas _ actors who have style but aren't
pompous about it.''
   She said she still remembers how her introverted personality made
performing difficult. ``Oh, I liked it beforehand _ all the
preparation _ and I liked it afterward, if it went well. But the
thing itself is scary.''
   ``I remember, many years ago, my mother said to me, `Considering
you have no talent, it's really extraordinary where you've got.' And
that's what I really believe to this day,'' she said. ``I've always
been self-conscious about interviews, about my thinness, my
tallness, my unattractiveness. My success _ it still bewilders me.''

<HEAD>Supplements No Substitute for Good Food, Experts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans cannot make up for poor dietary
habits by loading up on megavitamins and other food supplements from
the drug store, experts said Thursday at a National Research Council
conference.
   ``All of the money that people are spending on these dietary
supplements would be far better spent on making better food choices.
That's the bottom line,'' said Anthony B. Miller, a University of
Toronto nutrition scientist who headed an NRC committee that studied
the issue.
   ``There's little indication that they (dietary supplements) are
doing harm, but there's no proof that they are doing the good that
people hope they will,'' he said. ``Vitamins are not an adequate
substitute.''
   Miller said though some people are comforted by their belief that
vitamin pills, fiber powders or calcium tablets correct any
nutrition deficit in their diet, ``this may be a false sense of
security.''
   He was elaborating on a study released Wednesday by the National
Research Council soundly rejecting the concept of taking food
supplements, such as vitamins, fiber or calcium, to make up for
deficits in the diet. Manufacture and sale of such supplements is a
$3 billion business, the study said, and up to 60 percent of
Americans take such supplements.
   In the council's 1,300-page report, a 19-member committee of
experts said they found no proof that such supplements actually
provided a health benefit for people on the average American diet.
   Instead, said Miller, the diet itself is the problem.
   The committee called for Americans to cut their fat consumption
to 30 percent of all calories consumed, reduce cholesterol intake to
300 milligrams and eat more complex carbohydrates, vegetables and
fruits.
   ``If you change your diet in the direction that we recommend, you
will not need these vitamins,'' said Miller.
   Dr. DeWitt S. Goodman of Columbia University, a member of the NRC
committee, said he was particularly concerned about people taking
vitamins in huge doses.
   ``Under no circumstances should Americans take megadoses of
anything,'' he said. ``That is highly undesirable. That we strongly
recommend against.''
   Large doses of some vitamins can be poisonous, said Goodman.
   Goodman conceded that vitamin pills do have uses for some people,
but he said they are not needed by the general population, and
certainly not 60 percent of all Americans.
   ``Individuals who for some reason have diets that do not meet
their individual needs, then multivitamins might be appropriate, but
that should be dealt with through a health professional,'' said
Goodman.
   Even days when a person's only food is just a quick sandwich,
said Goodman, are not a reason to take vitamin pills or other
supplements.
   ``There is an enormous cushion in these RDA (recommended dietary
allowances) to allow for not meeting the requirement for one day, or
two days or three days,'' he said.
   Goodman, Miller and other members of the NRC committee said what
is important is the pattern of foods that a person eats. The
studies, they said, show that healthful and disease-combatting
effects come from diets that include a variety of foods, not from
concentrating on certain elements such as vitamins, fiber or calcium.
   The comments came during a conference of nutrition experts
assembled to discuss the NRC report.
   Elaine Lanza, a scientist in the cancer prevention branch of the
National Cancer Institute, praised the position taken by the
committee.
   ``People need fruits, vegetables and whole grains in their diets,
not supplements,'' she said.

   Elizabeth Taylor, the subject of much speculation
regarding her health the past few months, confirmed Thursday she had
spent time in the Betty Ford Clinic after suffering a back injury.
   ``It has taken a long time to heal and even longer to learn to
live with it,'' Taylor said in a two-paragraph statement issued by
her publicist. ``During this time I was in the Betty Ford Clinic for
a brief time ... and I am fine now!''
   Taylor said she suffered a compression fracture of the first
lumbar vertebra. But neither the 57-year-old actress nor her
publicist would say if prescription drugs for that injury put Taylor
into the drug and alcohol rehabilitation clinic.
   Tabloids had reported that Taylor had gone to the California
center last year, but this was the actress' first public statement
about her stay, said publicist Lucinda Marshall.
   The statement concluded: ``I must be true to myself and live my
life according to my standards. If they don't meet everyone's
approval, that's life. It's my approval and the approval of those
closest to me that matters most.''

<HEAD>Space Shuttle Managers Meet To Set Launch Date</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Space shuttle managers met Thursday
for two days of discussions to select a launch date for space
shuttle Discovery.
   An announcement is expected Friday afternoon.
   NASA officials said Wednesday the launch of Discovery and its
five astronauts would be delayed until at least March 11 because of
a crushed electrical part on one of the shuttle's three main engines.
   Until then, the space agency had been targeting March 9 for
liftoff but that date became questionable Monday when the Air Force
announced that it planned to launch a high-priority military rocket
on that date and could not support a shuttle flight with its
tracking facilities until the 11th.
   The electrical part problem apparently resolved that potential
conflict. However, a delay in the military flight could affect the
shuttle launch on a day-by-day basis.
   The Air Force mission, believed to be a satellite launch for the
Strategic Defense Initiative, has priority for national security
reasons.
   During a readiness test of Discovery's three main engines, a
control mechanism on engine No. 1 shut down prematurely, NASA said.
The problem was traced to a crushed solenoid, a coil of wire that
acts like a bar magnet when carrying an electrical current.
   Officials believe the solenoid was damaged when hit by equipment
being used to install a new turbopump in the engine.
   A replacement part was flown here and installed late Wednesday.
The installation and checkout meant a slip of at least two days in
the shuttle launch, NASA said.
   During five days in orbit, Discovery's astronauts are to deploy a
large communications satellite and conduct scientific experiments.

   Soviet Jews staged their first protest in half a
year Thursday, gathering within sight of the Kremlin to accuse their
government of violating international human rights agreements by
barring their emigration.
   A police major repeatedly told about 20 protesters they were
breaking the law by holding a demonstration without a permit, but
uniformed and plainclothes officers who swarmed around the steps of
Lenin Library made no move to halt the half-hour protest.
   ``We're hearing many words about how we are observing the Vienna
human rights agreements, but they are not being fulfilled in
deeds,'' said protest organizer Yuri Semenovsky, who has sought for
three years to obtain a Soviet exit visa. ``We have been deceived.''
   Semenovsky and other refuseniks who unfurled signs and banners at
6 p.m. on the library steps within sight of the Kremlin's towers
said Soviet Jews had not demonstrated for six months because of
hopes raised by increased emigration figures and the Vienna
negotiations that resulted in a 35-nation agreement on human rights
in January.
   ``But for us, nothing has changed,'' Semenovsky said.
   Although more than 20,000 Soviet Jews were allowed permission to
emigrate in 1988, Semenovksy said 80,000 others had their
applications refused.
   He and the other demonstrators are members of a Jewish refusenik
group called the ``Poor Relatives,'' who say their departure is
prevented because of a Soviet requirement that family members
certify that they have no financial claims on a would-be emigrant.
He said 700 people were members of the ``Poor Relatives.''
   The group says such a requirement violates the Vienna agreement
adopted by the Soviet Union, which mandates that ``acts or omissions
by members of the applicant's family do not adversely effect the
rights of the applicant (to emigrate).''
   The document was adopted in January at a meeting attended by
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and envoys from 34
other nations, including the United States. It is not legally
binding, but the 35 nations who adopted it undertook to abide by it.
   The uniformed police major, who gave his name as Lebedev, walked
up to the demonstrators seconds after they displayed their banners
and signs, one of which called for a world ``without missiles and
refuseniks.''
   Lebedev said authorities in Moscow's Kiev district had refused to
grant the protesters' request for a demonstration permit, and that
the city had outlawed all demonstrations at the library and nearby
Kalinin Prospekt, once the frequent site of protests by dissidents.
   ``I call on you to end this illegal demonstration,'' Lebedev said.
   But Semenovsky replied he had never received an answer to his
request from city authorities for a demonstration permit, which he
said he sent by registered mail 12 days ago.
   He told Lebedev that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ``has said
that everything that's not forbidden is to be allowed.''
   Lebedev repeated his demand at least 10 times that the refuseniks
end the protest, then he walked away.
   That treatment was in sharp contrast to the way police dealt with
a refusenik demonstration in August, which was broken up in two
minutes. Seven Jews who were denied permission to emigrate were
sentenced to up to 10 days in jail or fined for holding an
unauthorized protest.
   Semenovsky said two other protests, held in September, also ended
with the arrest of participants.
   Semenovsky said the refuseniks decided it was time to protest
again because a new law easing emigration requirements has not
appeared. He said refuseniks were promised such a law would be
enacted last month by Yuri Reshetov, a Foreign Ministry official who
received a group of Jews in January.
   In February, Soviet authorities allowed 2,236 Jews to leave,
according to the Geneva-based agency that helps resettle them. That
figure marked the second straight monthly drop in emigration, but
was still sharply above the monthly average in 1988, according to
the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration.
   The number of Jews allowed to emigrate soared to an eight-year
high of 3,510 in December, and dipped to 2,616 in January. Last
year's exodus of Soviet Jews totaled 20,082, the most since 1980.

   A child rapist who hoped to win re-election
to his job as town constable after being released from prison
withdrew his candidacy Thursday.
   August Barros' candidacy had created a furor in Carver and
prompted two other candidates to run for the post, which does not
come with police powers or a town salary and consists mostly of
delivering legal documents.
   Barros, 66, had filed nomination papers signed by 50 people on
Feb. 9. Thursday morning he submitted a letter requesting that his
nomination be withdrawn, said town clerk Bernadette Hemingway.
   A woman answering the telephone at Barros' home confirmed Barros
had withdrawn from the race, but referred questions to the town
clerk.
   Barros was constable from 1982 until his conviction in September
1987.
   Massachusetts law forces elected officials to resign when
convicted of felonies, but nothing prevents them from seeking office
when they get out of prison.
   Barros pleaded guilty in 1987 to two counts of raping a child. He
was sentenced to 20 years at the state prison in Concord on the
first count, with one year to be served and the remainder of the
time suspended. On the second count, he was given a three- to
five-year suspended sentence.

<HEAD>Partial Eclipse Next Wednesday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The sun will be partly obscured for millions of
Americans next Wednesday morning, the U.S. Naval Observatory
reported Thursday.
   Residents of Hawaii and about the western two-thirds of the
United States and Canada will be able to see the eclipse, which will
be at its maximum at about 10 a.m. PST, according to the
Observatory's calculations.
   For residents of Alaska, about 70 percent of the sun will be
covered during the eclipse, while less of the sun will be obscured
for viewers in other areas, according to astronomers at McDonald
Observatory of the University of Texas at Austin.
   The eclipse will occur as the new moon passes between the sun and
the Earth.
   The amount of sun covered will vary widely, the Texas astronomers
reported. From the 70 percent obscured in Alaska it will diminish to
about half in the Pacific Northwest, with 30 percent covered along a
line from San Diego in southern California to Winnipeg in Canada.
   At the easternmost limit of the eclipse, along a line from
central Texas through Missouri, Illinois and Michigan, only a small
dent will appear in the sun.
   Even though a portion of the sun is obscured during the eclipse,
astronomers and eye doctors warn against looking directly at the
phenomenon. Staring at the sun for more than a couple of seconds can
burn and scar the retina, potentially leading to distorted vision or
blindness.
   For groups of people who want to watch, astronomers recommend
using a pinhole mirror system to cast an image of the sun on an
indoor wall.
   This can be done by cutting a one-quarter inch hole in a piece of
black paper and taping the paper over a small mirror.
   Open a south-facing window and use the mirror to reflect the
sun's image on the opposite wall of the room. Modeling clay can help
hold the mirror in place. The room should be as dark as possible.
   The spot reflected on the wall is am image of the sun and it will
show every aspect of the eclipse.
   It is a good idea to experiment with the paper and mirror ahead
of time, trying out different sizes of holes in the paper. A large
hole makes for a fuzzy but bright image, while a smaller hole makes
it sharp but dim.

<HEAD>Noted Violinist Says Lessons of Nazi Atrocities Apply Today</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Violinist Yehudi Menuhin, in Bonn to be
honored for promoting German-Jewish reconcialition, urged the world
Thursday to condemn current atrocities as well as Hitler's slaughter
of European Jews.
   ``We will not draw the lesson so long as we condemn only the
Nazis, who should be condemned,'' he said. ``If we condemn them, we
must condemn by the same token many of the acts which are happening
now in many other countries.''
   As examples, the 72-year-old musician mentioned ``torture and
slaughter'' in parts of Africa, Central America and South America,
and events in the Middle East.
   Menuhin, dressed in a gray cardigan, well-worn trousers and a
fading paisley tie, spoke to The Associated Press in a cramped
lounge during a break in rehearsals for a concert he will conduct
Saturday.
   Soon after World War II, Menuhin came to Germany on a benefit
concert tour that included a heart-wrenching performance for fellow
Jews and other survivors of the Bergen-Belsen death camp.
   He also played for Germans, Americans and concentration camp
survivors in Berlin in 1947, two years after the war ended.
   On Sunday, West Germany's Societies for Christian-Jewish
Cooperation will give him the Buber-Rosenzweig medal for those
performances and his efforts to bring about dialague between Jews
and Christians. The award, established in 1968, commemorates the
Jewish philosophers Martin Buber and Franz Rosenzweig.
   Menuhin, who was born in New York City and became a British
citizen in 1985, spoke at length of the relationships among crimes
against humanity from various historical epochs.
   ``I think that, however tragic, terrifying, unspeakably horrible
the Third Reich was, that a nation that feels guilty, a nation that
knows it has committed a crime is a nation better for that,'' he
said.
   ``The only sad, sad thing today is that the crimes are going on,
not in Germany, but in many other parts of the world. And until we
can look upon them as crimes of mankind collectively, until we can
rise above the condemning of one people, we will never overcome
these crimes.''
   ``Unless we can ... join our neighbors in the act of sharing and
of protecting our children's future, we will all be destroyed,'' he
said.
   ``I feel we are living now in the last epoch of the caveman,
although I sometimes feel the caveman couldn't have been as horrible
as the modern man because he probably only killed to survive like
the animals do.''
   In his book ``Unfinished Journey,'' published in 1977, Menuhin
recalled the performances he gave at Bergen-Belsen.
   ``The inmates of the camp had been liberated some weeks earlier,
the prison huts burned down and the ex-prisoners transferred to the
adjoining SS barracks, which had, among other comforts, a theater,''
he wrote.
   ``Men and women alike, our audience was dressed in army blankets
fashioned by clever tailors among them into skirts and suits. No
doubt the few weeks since their rescue had put a little flesh on
their bones, but to our unaccustomed eye they seemed desperately
haggard, and many were still in hospital.''
   He wrote of facing ``boos, hisses and imprecations'' when he went
to the Deuttel Center, a Berlin camp for displaced persons in 1947,
but of winning over the audience with the declaration:
   ``We Jews don't beg; we work! We are the best cobblers, the best
tailors, the best doctors, the best musicians. That's what it means
to be a Jew! I have come to Germany to restore that image, to show
how false was Hitler's caricature.''
   Menuhin's benefit tours also took him to Italy, Austria, Hungary,
Britain and the Netherlands in 1946 and 1947. During the war, he
played more than 500 benefit for Allied soldiers and the Red Cross.

<HEAD>Humphrey Son-in-Law Claims He's Broke, Seeks Delay in Prison Term

<TEXT>
   The son-in-law of the late Vice President
Hubert H. Humphrey has asked for a 30-day delay in beginning his
four-year prison sentence for fraud, claiming he can't afford to
appeal without assistance.
   C. Bruce Solomonson told U.S. District Judge Edward J. Devitt on
Wednesday that he owes his attorneys more than $250,000 and does not
have the $10,000 to buy a transcript of his December trial.
   He is seeking formal pauper status so the court will pay for an
appeal, including transcripts and future attorney's fees.
   Solomonson was convicted Dec. 7 on eight counts of mail fraud and
one count of bank fraud. The charges involved the diversion of more
than $1.5 million from his two Edina insurance businesses for
personal use.
   He is scheduled to report Monday to the federal prison in Duluth.
   Devitt requested additional written briefs from attorneys before
he rules on the matter.
   In court documents, Solomonson claims that he has a negative net
worth of $273,000. The net worth of his wife, Nancy, is set at
$99,400. In early 1987 the Solomonsons showed a combined net worth
of $861,700.
   Under questioning by Assistant U.S. Attorney Hank Shea,
Solomonson said he has been selling some of his property and
financial holdings to pay bills and debts.

<TEXT>
   Dr. Marvin A. Block, a pioneer in persuading
physicians to treat alcoholism as a disease, has died. He was 86.
   Block, a retired professor at the State University of New York at
Buffalo, lectured and wrote widely on alcohol abuse and addressed
medical groups in Europe, Africa and Australia as well as throughout
the United States.
   He died Tuesday at Buffalo General Hospital.
   Block was on the board and was vice president of the National
Council on Alcoholism and also formed the New York State Council of
Committees on Alcoholism.
   His 1952 article ``Alcoholism _ the Physician's Duty'' was
acclaimed as one of the two most significant scientific articles
published during that year by the American Academy of General
Practice. In November 1953, he was appointed chairman of the
American Medical Association's Subcommittee on Alcoholism, designed
to educate physicians about the disease and to convince them that
alcoholism is an illness they were obliged to treat.
   After three years of intensive effort, the AMA House of Delegates
voted to declare alcoholism ``an illness which properly falls within
the purview of medical practice'' and urged all doctors and
hospitals to treat its ``victims.''
   Block's 1967 book, ``Alcoholism _ Its Facets and Phases,''
explained in non-technical language why people drink excessively and
helped guide family members of alcoholics.
   He retired from SUNY-Buffalo in 1973 as a clinical assistant
professor of medicine, but continued his private internal medicine
practice until a few months before his death.
   He is survived by three sisters. Funeral services were set for
Friday in Buffalo.

<HEAD>Businessman Plans Something Different for Mansion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bachelor who bought one of England's great
mansions has unusual plans for the 300-room estate on 83 acres:
he'll live in it.
   Most owners of stately homes turn them into inns or tourist
attractions. Wensley Haydon-Baillie said Thursday he has saved
Wentworth Woodhouse ``for posterity'' and will make it his private
residence.
   He bought the 18th-century mansion in south Yorkshire from his
distant cousins, the Fitzwilliam family, for an undisclosed price.
   The Fitzwilliams nearly sold the lease last year to a developer,
but when they learned of his plans to put a golf course on the deer
park and turn the building into a hotel, the deal fell through.
   ``I am delighted to be able to secure the future of Wentworth
Woodhouse,'' Haydon-Baillie said in a joint statement with the
Fitzwilliam Estate, which represents the family.
   Haydon-Baillie, 45, is an economist and chairman of two
companies, Optical and Medical International PLC, and Porton
International PLC.
   To provide for the restoration and maintenance of the house,
Haydon-Baillie has created an endowment trust, said the statement.
   Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, chairman of English Heritage, the
state-funded body for preserving historic houses and monuments,
described Wentworth Woodhouse as ``one of the greatest historic
houses in England.''
   ``The securing of its permanent future as part of Britain's
future will be welcomed by all as of outstanding importance,'' said
Montagu, who acted as an adviser to the deal.
   The statement said WentWorth Woodhouse, with its 660-foot-long
facade, is the largest classical house in England. The building near
Rotherham in central England is unique in that the back facade is in
the Baroque style.
   Haydon-Baillie told The Daily Telegraph he was unsure how many
rooms his new home had, saying ``it depends what you count as a
room.'' The estate official said there were about 300 rooms.
   In calling it home, Haydon-Baillie will follow in the footsteps
of the Earl of Strafford, minister to King Charles I, and the
Marquess of Rockingham, prime minister at the time of America's
Revolutionary War.
   The statement hinted Haydon-Baillie won't keep the mansion
entirely to himself, saying he intends to allow ``appropriate access
... when and where possible'' after restoration.
   The public will also be allowed to walk through the estate's 83
acres of parkland, which is owned by a Fitzwilliam family trust.
   Following post-World War II legislation enacting heavy taxes on
inherited wealth, many owners of stately homes have been forced to
open them to the public. Some turned over houses to the National
Trust charity while others turned them into museums, with commercial
attractions on the side, and lived in one corner.
   The Historic Houses Association, Britain's largest group of
private owners, doesn't criticize the commercial ventures.
   ``Using houses in this way is a way that collections can stay
together and be viable under private ownership,'' said Victoria
Merrill, executive secretary of the group. ``The great thing is to
have them used.''

   The average snowman is naked, once you
stop to think about it, except for maybe an old hat and scarf.
   But a naked snowman that appeared Monday on a Long Island lawn
was also more anatomically correct than usual.
   Someone complained to the North Haven Village Hall, but by the
time Building Inspector Albert Daniels went out Tuesday and got to
the specified address _ which was not made public _ the offending
body part was gone.
   ``It either melted or was knocked off,'' Village Clerk Janice
Hines said Thursday. ``We didn't see it with our own little eyes.''
   Ms. Hines said she doesn't believe the snowman violated any

   Pokora said the fire Sunday apparently was started by an

   There was, of course, a better mouse
trap. But also featured were a gnat-combating hat, a parent alarm
and a special set of chopsticks for those who find it tough to get a
grip.
   The creations were among 199 entries Wednesday at a fair of the
Minnesota Student Inventors Congress as finalists were picked for
this summer's statewide competition.
   Fourth-grader Kyle Parsons, 10, designed a parent alarm for his
cousin, Eric, and other friends who get in trouble watching
television or playing home video games. The alarm is tripped when
unsuspecting parents step on air tubes placed underneath a rug
outside the door.
   ``You can hide and fake like you're asleep until they leave so
you don't get in trouble,'' Kyle said.
   Gnats irritate fifth-grader Leslie Northam. ``They just bug me a
lot,'' she said.
   So Leslie, 10, invented a ``gnat hat'' _ a baseball cap featuring
a glove attached vertically to its top. According to Leslie, this
will draw the pesky insects out of her hair because gnats hover
around the highest point.
   Sixth-grader Steph Anderson's ``Easy Chopsticks'' invention was
one of 12 picked to advance to the statewide Minnesota Inventors
Congress.
   ``Me and my brother can't use chopsticks,'' said Steph, 12, who
attached chopsticks to a clothespin to hold them together tightly.
This allows people to eat without getting mad, she said.

<HEAD>Bennett Says Casual Users Must Be Included in War on Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William J. Bennett indicated Thursday that he
envisions a war on drugs against casual users as well as drug
dealers, but he assured senators that he would defend the civil
liberties of Americans.
   ``The so-called casual user ... has to realize he's an accessory
to everything that's going on in this country,'' Bennett, nominated
to become the first director of National Drug Control Policy, told
the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   During the second and final day of his relatively uncontentious
confirmation hearings, Bennett said he intends to enlist the help of
such people as television writers and commissioners of sports
leagues to change the country's attitude on drug use.
   He said he's bothered by sports announcers introducing a player
on the field who has just returned from his third round of treatment
for drug abuse.
   ``How many shots do you get to still continue to appear as a role
model to children?'' Bennett said.
   Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., scheduled a
committee vote on the nomination next Thursday. Only two senators _
Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Paul Simon, D-Ill. _ have indicated
they might vote against Bennett.
   The former education secretary called for a hard line against
drug traffickers and defended his support of school officials who
set up metal detectors and take other measures to control violence
and drug abuse in the schools.
   ``This war is not for delicate sensibilities,'' he said. ``This
is tough stuff.''
   However, he assured Biden that he is concerned about civil
liberties.
   ``They are the base. They are the cement. They are the anchor.
They sometimes cause us difficulties in this war ... but these are
the ends. ... You can't destroy the fabric of the country in order
to defend the country,'' Bennett said.
   As education secretary, he said, ``I resisted some who were
arguing for universal (drug) testing of the students'' because ``I'm
sensitive to the Constitution, the Fourth Amendment,'' which
prohibits unreasonable search and seizure.
   Biden raised anew the issue of whether there should be a ban on
semiautomatic, combat-style weapons used by drug traffickers. The
subject was debated extensively Wednesday when Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., pulled out a memo Bennett wrote a year ago urging
consideration of legislation limiting access to such weapons.
   Bennett told Biden on Thursday that he believes there's a
correlation between easy access to weapons and the violence of drug
dealing.
   ``I don't think there's any doubt about it,'' Bennett said, but
added, ``You still have to take the people's right to bear arms
seriously.''
   A host of drug-related shootings and the killing of five
California schoolchildren earlier this year have prompted calls for
a ban on semiautomatic assault weapons with high-capacity ammunition
clips. President Bush has said he opposed such regulation, while
Mrs. Bush supports a ban.
   Bennett resisted taking a position on any specific legislation
pending completion of a comprehensive national drug control strategy
_ due six months after his confirmation. But he left open the
possibility that he ultimately may disagree with Bush's position.
   ``The fact that it's been spoken about by the president does not
mean it's off the table,'' he said, adding that Bush agrees with
that view.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., urged Bennett to examine closely the
State Department's method of certifying countries overseas for
foreign aid. That department determines whether those countries have
done all they can to battle illegal drugs, and the list of certified
countries issued Wednesday included Colombia, the base of several
notorious drug traffickers.
   Specter said the certification of Colombia is ``a shock to me
because Colombia has refused to negotiate with us an extradition
treaty, in effect saying the drug cartels have taken over the
country.''
   Bennett said he would look into the certification procedures, but
defended the inclusion of Colombia on the list.
   ``The government (in Colombia) has made some efforts,'' he said.
``We know what happened to the supporters of the extradition treaty.
They got most of the members of the Supreme Court blown away by
machine-gun fire.''
   Specter said continuing foreign aid to Colombia probably would
encourage its anti-drug efforts, ``but I think we have to expect
some results. ... Colombia is really in a state of anarchy. How they
can qualify for foreign aid is a mystery to me.''
   The hearing concluded after representatives of the League of
United Latin American Citizens and the Association for Supervision
and Curriculum Development offered testimony critical of Bennett's
nomination, although a LULAC spokesman said he believed committee
approval of Bennett was inevitable.

   The Commerce Department said Thursday it has
lifted export restrictions on a variety of goods and technology that
had been controlled for national security reasons for more than 25
years.
   The technology and materials, many of them commonly available,
now can be shipped out of the country without prior approval by the
Commerce Department. They include general industrial equipment such
as lathes and presses, photographic equipment, servo-control units,
synchronous motors and a broad range of industrial chemicals.
   ``This brings our export controls more closely in line with those
of our allies and improves the competitive position of U.S.
exporters,'' said Michael Zacharia, assistant secretary of commerce
for export administration.
   ``These changes focus controls on equipment with real potential
for military use by our adversaries, while at the same time reducing
unnecessary burdens on American businesses that export technology
products,'' he said.
   The action was required under the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act, which
directed the Commerce Department to remove restrictions on items
upon which only the United States imposed national security
controls, unless the United States was the only source or was
seeking similar controls from its allies.
   Some items will continue to be controlled because of regulations
related to nuclear non-proliferation and foreign policy concerns.

   An man convicted of drunken driving for the
eighth time says he is glad he has been sentenced to prison.
   ``I deserve it. ... I would have killed somebody sooner or

would not appeal the conviction and 1{-year sentence.
   Court authorities said Rogers, of Annapolis, had two prior
convictions in Anne Arundel County, four in Florida and two in
Washington state.
   The latest charge stemmed from an accident Nov. 26.
   In an interview at the county Detention Center, Rogers said he
has been drinking since he was 16 and looks forward to alcoholism
counseling offered in prison.
   ``I'd like to live a normal life when I get out.'' But he
admitted he did not benefit from court-ordered treatment two months
before the accident.
   Rogers' trial had been scheduled for Feb. 17, but was postponed
because he came to court intoxicated, said assistant State's
Attorney John LeCornu.

<HEAD>Walesa Optimistic After Meeting With Interior Minister</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said Thursday
he is ``a bigger optimist'' after a meeting with the interior
minister to iron out problems that have arisen during three weeks of
negotiations.
   The meeting came at a key moment in the unprecedented talks that
began Feb. 6 between the government and the opposition aimed at
reaching national accord and legalizing the banned Solidarity union
after more than seven years.
   Participants agreed the talks' various committees and
subcommittees should speed up their work, allowing the final plenary
meeting to be held in late March, a joint statement said afterward.
   Then, ``the process of implementing key decisions ... could start
as soon as possible,'' the statement carried by the official PAP
news agency said.
   The two sides have brought their positions closer together in
many areas although ``controversies and difficulties'' remain, the
statement said.
   The meeting of Walesa and Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak
began at 9:30 a.m. at the Magdalenka governement villa in a forest
south of Warsaw and ended after 6 p.m. Walesa appeared weary but
satisfied on his return to Warsaw.
   ``We were successful with some things and less successful with
others,'' he said. ``But I hope that we are moving forward.''
   He said the session left him, ``a bigger optimist than before I
went to it.''
   According to the Solidarity leader, the meeting with Kiszczak was
``to remove some barriers ... some political obstacles.'' He
declined to elaborate.
   Walesa was accompanied by advisers including historian Bronislaw
Geremek, journalist Tadeusz Mazowiecki, union organizers Zbigniew
Bujak and Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, the Rev. Alojzy Orszulik and Gdansk
bishop Tadeusz Goclowski.
   Among those on the government side with Kiszczak were Deputy
Prime Minister Ireneusz Sekula, Sports Minister Aleksander
Kwasniewski and Communist Party Politburo member Janusz Reykowski.
   After three weeks of talking, both sides appear eager for
agreement.
   Walesa, faced with a rising tide of worker and student
discontent, has been traveling the country pleading with people to
hold back protests and give the talks three more weeks to succeed.
   Although the talks have yielded progress in some areas, including
agreement in principle to legalize Solidarity and the farmers'
independent union Rural Solidarity, several sticking points have
arisen, including the form of upcoming elections to the Sejm, or
parliament, this year.
   Solidarity has accepted the notion that a majority of seats would
be reserved for the party and its allies _ as a temporary step on
the road to full democracy _ but it wants the rest to be freely
contested. The party would like to see the remaining seats assigned
to opposition-independent candidates.
   Another sore point is legalization of the banned Independent
Students Association. Students are increasingly agitated about the
fate of the group, known by the Polish initials NZS.
   Authorities seem to regard NZS as a greater threat than
Solidarity or Rural Solidarity, especially in light of the Communist
Party's weak support among youth, and have mounted a strong
propaganda campaign against the group in the past week based on
protests in Krakow.
   A group of Krakow students met with local Solidarity activist
Mieczyslaw Gil on Wednesday and asked him to speak up for NZS at the
meeting with Kiszczak.
   At a meeting with students Wednesday at Warsaw University, Walesa
said he would defend NZS. ``No table can stand on less than three
legs. And those three legs are: Solidarity of workers, NZS and Rural
Solidarity,'' he said.
   NZS was banned along with Solidarity and other independent groups
after the Dec. 13, 1981, martial-law crackdown in Poland.
   The two sides also remain apart on creating a state presidency
that would help guarantee continuation of a communist system in
Poland; on the degree of opposition's access to the mass media; and
on the framework for an economic reform program.

   A college president who resigned after two male
students accused him of sexual assault continues to draw a $63,000
salary while on extended salary, despite being certified capable of
returning to work.
   Former Westfield State College President Francis J. Pilecki plans
to appeal the doctor's ruling, according to officials at Fitchburg
State College, where Pilecki worked after leaving Westfield.
   Pilecki, 55, was examined by a doctor at the request of the
school's faculty union and was judged fit to return to work,
Fitchburg spokesman Michael Shanley said.
   Pilecki went on sick leave in 1987 and has exhausted the benefits
he was entitled to as a professor. Faculty members complain that now
his pay is depleting a college ``sick bank,'' which was created by
deducting days from each employee's unused sick time and pooling
them for the use of colleagues suffering from extraordinary ailments.
   Under the appeal process, Pilecki will be examined by three
doctors, one of his choice, one selected by the college and another
agreed upon by the school and Pilecki.
   A grand jury indicted Pilecki in 1986 and at trial he was found
innocent of the sexual assault charge leveled by one student. The
remaining charges were dropped after a settlement was reached in a
civil lawsuit brought by the other student.

   An electronics industry group said Thursday it
was urging large-scale re-entry by U.S. companies into the global
market for computer memory chips.
   The initiative, which could involve outlays of billions of
dollars to regain a significant share of a market that up to now has
been largely conceded to the Japanese, was announced by the board of
the Semiconductor Industry Association
   ``A stable and reliable source of DRAMs (dynamic random-access
memory chips) is essential to meet the critical technology needs of
the U.S. electronics and defense industries,'' the group said in a
statement.
   It added that ``re-entry of the U.S. semiconductor industry into
large-scale DRAM production is important to the nation's economic
and security interests.''
   Gordon Moore of Intel, the board's chairman, told a news
conference that the initiative represented ``a significant and
important change from the level of rhetoric we've had previously.''
   The action called for developing ``a plan and structure for
recommended collective efforts'' by the U.S. semiconductor industry.
   Asked whether that could mean formation of a consortium on the
model of Sematech, Moore said ``collective efforts could well
involve something like consortia.''
   The board of the association, which is based in Cupertino,
Calif., also approved a resolution saying ``we request that access
to the Japanese semiconductor market be among the highest
administration trade priorities.''
   It complained that the Japanese are still failing to comply with
market-access provisions of the September 1986 U.S.-Japanese
Semiconductor Agreement, under which Tokyo agreed to boost American
companies' share of the Japanese semiconductor market.
   ``We express deep concern that foreign participation in the
Japanese market may be declining from already depressed levels,''
the U.S. electronics group said.
   In April 1987 the U.S. government imposed $300 million in tariff
sanctions against Japanese computers, power tools and televisions.
Seven months later, $135 million of the sanctions were lifted after
the Japanese stopped dumping low-priced computer chips in the United
States and third countries.
   In addition to Intel, other companies represented on the
Semiconductor Industry Association board are Advanced Micro Devices,
AT&amp;T, Digital Equipment, Harris, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, LSI Logic,
Micron Technologies, Motorola, National Semiconductor, Rockwell,
Texas Instruments and VLSI Technology.

<HEAD>McDonnell Douglas, California Get Most Military Dollars</HEAD>

   The McDonnell Douglas Corp. cemented its
position as America's largest military contractor last year, and
California easily retained first place as the state receiving the
most defense payroll and pension dollars, Pentagon officials said
Thursday.
   Releasing two annual reports that chart the flow of military
dollars, the officials said the St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas
widened its lead over No. 2 General Dynamics Corp. and No. 3 General
Electric Co. by bucking a national trend and increasing its military
business in fiscal 1988.
   General Dynamics and GE both saw their defense business drop last
year, the Pentagon reported.
   On the geographic front, California easily maintained its top
ranking, receiving almost $13 billion in Defense Department payrolls
and pensions. That figure does not include the $23.5 billion in
contracts won by California companies in fiscal 1988 for future
business.
   Nationally, the Pentagon paid out $85.4 billion in payroll and
pensions during the year to people working or retired inside the
United States, up $1 billion from the previous year.
   Of that total, $27.3 billion went to pay civilian employees,
$34.5 billion went to active-duty personnel, $5 billion went to pay
reservists and National Guard members and $18.6 billion went to
retirees.
   The new figures are contained in two statistical reports _ ``100
Companies Receiving the Largest Dollar Volume of Prime Contract
Awards'' and the ``Department of Defense Atlas.'' Both cover the
fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30.
   Last month, the Pentagon released a report that provided a
breakdown of military contracts by state. The list of rankings
released Thursday, however, is the first to show how individual
companies fared during the year.
   The atlas, meantime, shows how the Pentagon's payroll and
military pensions are being dispersed around the nation.
   According to the corporate rankings, McDonnell Douglas received
contracts worth $8 billion in fiscal 1988, up from $7.7 billion in
fiscal 1987 and far ahead of General Dynamics.
   General Dynamics saw its business decline from $7 billion in
fiscal 1987 to $6.5 billion last year, while GE's business declined
from $5.8 billion to $5.7 billion.
   The remainder of the top 10 included Tenneco Inc., with $5.1
billion, Raytheon Co. with $4.1 billion, Martin Marietta Corp. with
$3.7 billion, General Motors Corp. with $3.6 billion, the Lockheed
Corp. with $3.54 billion, the United Technologies Corp. with $3.51
billion, and the Boeing Co. with $3 billion.
   The report shows the Pentagon's contractors were fighting over a
smaller pie in fiscal 1988, with prime contracts totaling $137
billion being parceled out. That is $5.5 billion less than the total
awarded in fiscal 1987.
   Moreover, the top 100 companies, as a group, saw their share of
those contracts decline last year. The 100 firms received $90.1
billion of the contracts, or 65.8 percent of the total, compared to
$95.4 billion and 66.9 percent in fiscal 1987.
   The biggest change in the fiscal 1988 rankings was the rise of
Tenneco, a company that ranked 13th in fiscal 1987. Tenneco's jump
to fourth place was based on a Navy order for two nuclear-powered
aircraft carriers received by the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp;
Drydock Co., a wholly owned subsidiary.
   As for the Pentagon's payroll and pension payments, California
was followed in the rankings by Virginia with $9.2 billion in total
compensation, Texas with $6.5 billion, Florida with $5 billion and
North Carolina with $3.2 billion.
   The remainder of the top 10 included Georgia with $3.1 billion,
Washington state with $2.9 billion, Maryland with $2.7 billion,
Pennsylvania with $2.5 billion and South Carolina with $2.4 billion.
   Breaking down those figures to focus on pension payments,
military retirees most favor California, Florida, Texas, Virginia
and Washington state, in that order.

<TEXT>
   Actor Gary Busey was sharply criticized by an
injury control authority Thursday for continuing to oppose
motorcycle helmets even after receiving a serious head injury in a
motorcycle crash.
   ``Mr. Busey is darn lucky to even be alive to make the statements
he makes,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Sacks, a medical epidemiologist at the
injury control division of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta.
   ``I'm assuming that he doesn't have residual brain damage that
led to what he said,'' Sacks said.
   Each year, 4,000 people are killed in motorcycle accidents and
360,000 injured seriously enough to require medical care, Sacks said
in a telephone interview.
   Busey, who said he plans to help raise money to fight mandatory
helmet laws, met reporters Wednesday for the first time since
receiving a serious injury Dec. 4 that required brain surgery to
remove two blood clots.
   Busey said that if he had been wearing a helmet he could have
broken his neck.
   Sacks said, ``I'm reminded of how people say wearing a seat belt
may be dangerous because maybe I'll get thrown clear of a car that
gets crushed if I don't wear it.
   ``I think the same kind of logic applies here. There may be rare
instances where wearing a helmet or wearing a seat belt may do harm,
but in the vast majority of situations they're going to save lives.''
   Sacks said ``the case is clear, compelling and overwhelming that
helmets reduce head injuries not only in motorcycling but also for
many sports and even for bicycling.''
   In July, Dr. Frederick Rivara of the University of Washington in
Seattle reported that it costs an average of $25,764 to care for a
motorcyclist hospitalized for injuries sustained on a motorcycle.
   Rivara studied 105 hospitalized motorcyclists and found that
public funds covered more than 63 percent of their $2.7 million in
medical costs.
   ``Several studies have shown that a very high proportion of
motorcyclists lack insurance to pay for their medical care, which
means taxpayers pay for it,'' said Sacks.
   Busey ``may well be able to afford his medical care and see that
he gets the best, but such is not the case for many of those who
will suffer a serious head injury for which we, the public, will
have to pay,'' Sacks said.

   South Korea and North Korea failed
Thursday to set terms for an unprcedented meeting between their
prime ministers, but both sides agreed to try again in April,
officials said.
   The five-member delegations exchanged hostile statements after
North Korea refused to withdraw demands for an immediate halt to
annual joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises.
   They agreed to meet again on April 12.
   ``Korea showed no sincerity at all in considering our just
proposal for an end to the exercises,'' North Korea's chief
delegate, Paik Nam Jun, said after the meeting.
   The Seoul delegation canceled a scheduled news conference and
chief delegate Song Han-ho, said he had ``nothing to add'' to the
meeeting, which he described as ``self-explanatory.''
   The meeting held at this border village, 35 miles north of Seoul,
was a repeat of the Feb. 8 talks, which collapsed after the
communist delegation made the same demands.
   Paik said there would be no progress toward a meeting between
presidents of the two nations unless Seoul agreed to cancel the
maneuvers. Paik said the military exercises were preparation for a
nuclear attack on the communist nation.
   He said South Korea could hold reduced exercises, but without
U.S. participation, and he said any American military units en route
to South Korea for this year's maneuvers should turn back
immediately.
   Song has said the exercises, known as ``Team Spirit,'' are
defensive and no threat to North Korea.
   ``I urge that your side discuss procedural matters in a sincere
manner for the sake of the early realization of a South-North
high-level officials' meeting,'' he said.
   The ``Team Spirit'' exercises have been conducted annually since
1976 to test joint military preparedness in the event of a North
Korean attack. North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950, starting a
three-year war.
   The two nations, archrivals since the division of their land,
have made efforts recently to improve relations, although neither
side so far has been willing to make substantial concessions.

<HEAD>Demonstrators in Hungary Nominate Havel For Nobel Peace Prize</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 2,000 demonstrators rallying in
downtown Budapest on Thursday demanded the release of jailed
Czechoslovak playwright Vaclav Havel and said they would nominate
him for the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize.
   The protesters in Voeroesmarty Square denounced human rights
abuses in neighboring Czechoslovakia.
   Police did not interfere in the peaceful rally, which has only
recently become permitted in Hungary.
   Writer Gyoergy Konrad compared the banning of Havel's books and
his jail sentence to Iran's death threat against Salman Rushdie for
his book ``The Satanic Verses.''
   ``The Czech government must free Vaclav Havel from prison, and
the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize should be given to him!'' one speaker
said to the cheers of the assembled crowd. He said organizers of the
rally would send the nomination to the Nobel committee in Norway.
   Havel was convicted last month on charges of incitement and
obstructing police for his role in a January rally in Prague, and he
was sentenced to nine months in jail. The January rally honored Jan
Palach, a student who set himself afire to protest the Soviet-led
invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.
   Organizers read a letter addressed to the Czechoslovak Embassy in
Budapest calling on the government in Prague to adopt political
reforms similar to those under way in Hungary and Poland.
   ``A government that imprisoned a man who was taking flowers to
the place where Jan Palach died cannot have a future in present-day
Europe,'' the speaker said.
   Pictures of Havel were pinned to loudspeaker cables throughout
the square.
   Speakers also read letters sent to demonstration organizers by a
Czechoslovakian human rights group and by Havel's wife, Olga.
   She thanked the protesters for their ``show of solidarity'' with
her husband and with others who ``have been imprisoned or are
persecuted for their views.''

   Congress celebrated its bicentennial on
Thursday with trumpets, with poetry and, reflecting the nature of
the place, with speeches galore.
   The House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States
gathered for a joint meeting in the House chamber for a ceremony
calling attention to that late-winter day in 1789 when Congress
assembled for the first time in New York City, eventually to breathe
life into the newly ratified Constitution.
   Actually, Thursday's session took place two days before the
anniversary. The 1st Congress met on March 4, 1789. But the actual
anniversary falls on a Saturday, and the 101st Congress will not be
in session that day.
   At the bicentennial celebration, the mood was both serious and
irreverent.
   ``Since reverence has never been America's thing, this verse in
your honor will not begin, `O Thou,''' said Howard Nemerov, poet
laureate of the United States, reading a poem dedicated to Congress
as it begins its third century.
   Even some of the words about Congress quoted in the printed
program had an irreverent air:
   _``Congress is so strange. A man gets up to speak and says
nothing. Nobody listens _ and then everbody disagrees.'' _ Boris
Marshalov, a Soviet visitor in 1946.
   _``We cuss Congress, and we joke about 'em, but they are all good
fellows at heart _ and if they wasn't in Congress, why, they would
be doing something else against us that might be even worse.'' _
Will Rogers.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said that in the
age of television, the presidency is perceived by most Americans as
the primary branch of government.
   ``I do not claim that Congress is the primary branch of
government,'' Mitchell said. ``I do remind all it is a coequal
branch.''
   David McCullough, a prize-winning historian, gave the principal
address, and sounded the same theme.
   In contrast to the presidency, he said, ``Congress seems to roll
on like a river. Someone said you can never cross the same river
twice. Congress is like that _ always there and always changing.
   ``Individuals come and go. The stage is constantly crowded. The
talk and the rumpus go on. And there has been a lot of humbug and so
much that is overwhelmingly boring.''
   McCollough added: ``Congress for all its faults has not been the
unbroken parade of clowns and thieves and posturing windbags so
often portrayed. ... What should be spoken of more often are the
great victories that have been won here, the decisions of courage
and vision achieved, the men and women of purpose and integrity,
and, yes, at time genius, who have served here.''
   The first Congress adopted the Bill of Rights _ the first 10
amendments to the Constitution; established the Supreme Court and
other divisions of the federal court system; counted the first
electoral ballots that seated George Washington as the first
president; passed the first tariff legislation to provide an income
for the federal government; and created the structure and committees
of both houses.
   Although that first Congress convened on March 4, it took weeks
for each chamber to gain a quorum: April 1 for the House and April 6
for the Senate.
   Thursday's ceremony was a bit reminiscent of the initial
difficulty Congress had in assembling a quorum. Neither the 435-seat
House nor the Senate had a quorum of its members present _ only 20
of the 100 members of the Senate were to be seen.

   The head of Amtrak said Thursday that the
commuter railroad would continue limited operations for only a few
days if picketed by workers supporting any strike against Eastern
Airlines.
   W. Graham Claytor Jr., president of Amtrak, also said that if
Eastern is struck and sympathetic workers do not picket the
railroad, Amtrak would add trains between New York and Washington
and possibly between New York and Boston.
   Claytor told the Senate transportation appropriations
subcommittee that based on public statements by union leaders, he
considered it likely that a strike against Eastern would result in
picketing against the railroad by union members seeking to disrupt
transportation.
   Outside the hearing room, he told reporters that management
personnel would operate the trains, and that Amtrak would be able to
provide limited service on its routes ``for at least a day or two,
and then shut down altogether.''
   He said the railroad could not function for much longer because
of rules regulating the number of hours railway employees can work.
   Asked which Amtrak workers could be expected to cross a picket
line, he said, ``Nobody.''

<HEAD>Common Market Nations Agree To Seek Chlorfluorocarbon Ban</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Ozone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmental officials from the 12
European Economic Community nations agreed Thursday to sharply
reduce their use of chlorofluorocarbons, the compounds that are
destroying the Earth's ozone layer.
   The ministers agreed to cut chlorofluorocarbon production by 85
percent as soon as possible and to seek a total ban on the synthetic
substances by the end of the century.
   Chlorofluorocarbons are used in aerosal sprays, refrigeration
coolants and a variety of other products. The compounds are blamed
for depletion of the ozone layer that protects the Earth from the
sun's harmful ultraviolet rays.
   The ministers agreed to give the EEC Commission a mandate to
completely phase out the manufacture and use of chlorofluorocarbons
by the year 2000.
   The commission will represent the 12 nations at the international
conferences being held this year to discuss the ozone issue and
monitor application of an international accord called the Montreal
Protocol.
   This protocol, signed by 40 countries and ratified by 32, took
effect on Jan. 1 and is intended to reduce the production and use of
chlorofluorocarbons by 50 percent from current levels by 1998.
   The EEC ministers also gave a mandate to the commission to
encourage other countries to sign and ratify the protocol.
   The EEC member states are responsible for about half the world's
annual chlorofluorocarbon production of 1 million tons, with Britain
leading in both production and exports, according to the
London-based environmental group Greenpeace.
   Greenpeace says Britain exported chlorofluorocarbons to 117
countries in 1988, 81 of which had not signed the Montreal Protocol.
   Greenpeace said that ``between 1979 and 1986 the ozone layer over
the EEC has already been depleted by an average of 3 percent. This
rises to nearly 7 percent in the winter.''
   Ministers from countries which have ratified the Montreal
Protocol are to meet in London March 5-7 and a further conference is
scheduled in Helskinki, Finland, on May 2-5 to monitor the
application of the protocol.

   The celebrity status of Grammy
Award-winning jazz saxophonist Stan Getz is worth little because of
his ill health, and his ex-wife is not entitled to any payment for
it, a judge has ruled.
   In a decision rendered last month and made public Thursday, state
Supreme Court Justice Nicholas Colabella denied a motion by Getz's
ex-wife, Monica, that his celebrity status constituted marital
property.
   Getz gained gold record status with his 1966 hit ``The Girl from
Ipanema.''
   According to the court papers, Getz, 60, suffers from liver
cancer, lymphoma and cirrhosis of the liver.
   Getz's physician, Avram Cooperman, testified that Getz probably
has two years to live and ``it is unlikely plaintiff will be able to
pursue his livelihood as a performer in any substantial way.''
   Colabella's ruling came more than a year after Getz was granted a
divorce from his wife of 31 years in a trial in which the couple
traded allegations of adultery and abuse.
   Getz, an admitted alcoholic, testified that his wife put
Antabuse, a drug used in treating alcoholics, into his food without
telling him, causing him to become violently ill. A person consuming
alcohol with the drug can suffer nausea and headaches.
   Mrs. Getz, 54, testified she administered the drug because she
loved him.
   Colabella ruled that Mrs. Getz did not sacrifice a medical career
to help her husband, as she testified, and that she was entitled
only to equal distribution of marital property, including the sale
of their $1.8 million Tarrytown estate, property in Spain and
royalties due for records made 1956, when the couple wed, to 1981,
when Getz filed for divorce.
   Getz is currently an artist in residence at Stanford University,
receiving $45,000 a year.

   The Air Force said Thursday it had imposed
flight restrictions on 20 of its 50 new C-5B Galaxy cargo planes
until a problem with the engine pylons is corrected.
   The service said it had ``just recently identified a potential
problem with some inboard engine pylons on some of the C-5B fleet.''
   ``Only 20 C-5B's may be affected,'' the service said. ``We have
found 31 pylons with this potential defect.''
   The issue had surfaced in public in a report by the Delaware
State News in Dover, Del.
   The pylon is the assembly that holds a jet engine to an
airplane's wing. In the case of the four-engine C-5B, the Air Force
said the problem prompting the flight restrictions involved the
pylons closest to the fuselage on each wing.
   The service said in a statement the affected pylons had been
manufactured differently than originally specified, with the result
that the overall ``useful life'' of the pylon had been reduced.
   The problem pylons have metal sleeves, or bushings, at the point
where the engine mounts to the pylon, in order to ensure a tight
fit. The original design calls for directly attaching the engine to
the pylon under such tight tolerances that a bushing is not needed.
   Because of the tolerances required, ``these bushings may reduce
the pylon's useful life,'' the service said. ``For example, instead
of lasting 30,000 flying hours, the mount would only last
15,000-to-20,000 hours.''
   The service described the flight restrictions as minor because
they affect maximum performance standards that are rarely touched
during peace-time training.
   The restrictions include a reduction in maximum air speed from
350 knots (400 mph) to 300 knots (345 mph), a taxi speed restriction
of 25 knots (29 mph), and orders to avoid side-slipping of the
aircraft in flight and severe turbulence.
   The prime contractor for the C-5B is the Lockheed Corp., and the
Air Force said Thursday it was ``working closely with the aircraft's
manufacturer to resolve the problem.''
   Dick Martin, a spokesman for Lockheed-Georgia, the subsidiary
that makes the C-5B in Marietta, Ga., said Thursday the company was
``well aware of the situation and we will correct the problem.''
   Martin said the bushings had been made for Lockheed by a
subcontractor, Rohr Industries of Chula Vista, Calif., and that
Lockheed and Rohr would work together to resolve the matter at no
cost to the Air Force.
   ``My understanding is that the suggested fix will be to install a
different style of bushing,'' Martin said, adding the repairs might
be completed in less than two months.
   Maj. Fran Tunstall, an Air Force spokesman in Washington, said
the service did not have an estimate of the cost of fixing the
pylons nor any timetable for the repairs.
   ``But we do expect Lockheed and Rohr to make the repairs,''
Tunstall said.
   Dick Dalton, a spokesman for Rohr, agreed his company would be
working with Lockheed to correct the problem. Dalton also noted,
however, that Rohr Industries ``does not have design responsibility
for the C-5 pylon.''

   Senators fired their opening volleys Thursday
in a party-line floor battle on John Tower's faltering nomination,
while the White House conceded that President Bush has failed to
convince a single Democrat to support his chosen defense secretary.
   ``Not yet,'' responded White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater when asked to provide the name of one Democrat the
administration had won over after two days of intensive lobbying.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, began the long-awaited debate, saying he was acting with
a ``sense of sorrow'' in leading the opposition against his former
colleague whom he had expected to support when the hearings began.
   But the Georgia Democrat said Tower's ``record of alcohol abuse
cannot be ignored.''
   ``We're not talking about the secretary of interior, we're
talking about someone next to the president at the very top of the
nuclear chain of command,'' Nunn said.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., in rebuttal for the Republicans,
extolled Tower for ``incalculable contributions'' to the United
States in 24 years in the Senate and later service on an arms
negotiating team.
   He said 70 current senators served with Tower, and not one ``has
come forward to challenge in any way the discharge of his duties as
a United States senator. Not one.''
   In defense of the nomination, Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, urged
his colleagues to ``weigh personal experience against the evidence
presented to the Senate Armed Services Committee.''
   Cohen described the evidence included in the FBI report on Tower
as so weak, ``no prosecutor would even bring a case like this before
a court of law.''
   The Maine Republican recalled allegations that surfaced about the
personal lives of Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson
after their deaths, and stressed that they failed to stop the two
leaders from successfully guiding the nation.
   ``Did these character flaws prevent LBJ from successfully pushing
through some of the most important domestic legislation in the
history of our country? Did they prevent JFK from forcing the
missiles from out of Cuba or negotiating a nuclear test ban
treaty?'' Cohen said. ``There's a double standard at work here.''
   Meanwhile, the ranks of opposition Democrats continued to grow as
Sen. Terry Sanford of North Carolina, a Southern Democrat the
administration hoped to see in its corner, said he would vote
against the nomination. Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., and Sen. Paul
Sarbanes, D-Md., also said they would oppose the nomination _
raising the number of opposition Democrats to 39.
   Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate. An Associated
Press tally at showed 43 Democrats and Republican Larry Pressler of
South Dakota either solidly opposed or leaning in opposition, and 40
Republicans either solidly for Tower or leaning in favor of the
nomination.
   No Senate vote is expected until next week.
   Despite the obvious numbers, Bush is ``still pleased with the
candidate and still believes he's the best man for the job,'' said
Fitzwater.
   Tower, meanwhile, met at the White House with Bush, Adm. William
Crowe and Deputy Defense Secretary William H. Taft IV, who is
serving as acting defense secretary.
   The nominee has been dogged by allegations of excessive drinking,
womanizing and questions about his ties to defense contractors. Over
a 2{ year period, Tower received more than $1 million in consulting
fees from such defense industry giants as Rockwell and Martin
Marietta.
   Tower has said he has no intention of giving up the fight for
confirmation and has vowed to give up drinking if he becomes defense
secretary.
   Two well-known Republicans _ former Sen. Barry Goldwater and
former President Nixon _ weighed in with their support of the
embattled nominee, with the 80-year-old Goldwater issuing a
blistering attack of his former colleagues.
   The Arizona Republican, who served in the Senate for 29 years,
accused Tower's Senate critics of hypocrisy and said that if
everyone who was guilty of excessive drinking or womanizing was
forced out, the nation would have no government.
   ``If they chased every man or woman out of this town who shacked
up with somebody else, or gotten drunk, there'd be no government. So
I think that the Senate better start looking at the facts,''
Goldwater said following a White House meeting with President Bush.
   Goldwater chided the Senate for ``working on innuendo, on facts
that have never been proven.''
   ``Yeah, he drank. I had a few with him,'' Goldwater said of
Tower. ``That he chased a few women? Hearsay. I don't give a damn
whether he did or not.''
   Nixon, in a statement issued by his spokesman John Taylor, said:
``Unless there is conclusive evidence against the nominee, the
Senate should respect the right of a new president to choose the men
and women he believes are best qualified to serve in his Cabinet.''
   Some of the specific allegations against Tower have surfaced in
news reports. The Washington Post on Thursday quoted a retired Air
Force sergeant as saying Tower appeared drunk and fondled women on
two visits to Bergstrom Air Force Base in Texas, in 1976 and 1978.
   Fitzwater conceded that the incident was not part of the FBI
report on Tower seen by Bush, but rejected it as ``more innuendo and
rumor.''

federal payments this month, the Agriculture Department said
Thursday.
   Milton Hertz, executive vice president of the department's
Commodity Credit Corp., said the payments will be in the form of
generic certificates, which are redeemable in surplus commodities
held by the CCC.
   About $85 million will be paid to eligible corn farmers and $40

   Most corn farmers, upon request, were paid about $2.6 billion at
the time they signed up in the 1988 program, and sorghum farmers
collected about $288 million in advance payments, Hertz said.

   At least 25 people were killed in
disputes between Tamil guerrillas and Sinhalese extremists as Sri
Lankan and Indian forces prepared an offensive against the
separatists, military officials said Thursday.
   Military forces were preparing to flush out Tamil guerrillas
hidden in jungle caves after Monday night's massacre of 38 Sinhalese
civilians, the government announced Thursday.
   Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne said the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam, the largest Tamil separatist group, were responsible
for the mass murder of men, women and children in Welikande, located
100 miles northeast of Colombo.
   The Tigers have denied they were responsible for Monday's
massacre or two others that occurred over a 16-day period last
month. A total of 81 Sinhalese villagers, including 29 children,
were shot, stabbed or hacked to death in the three attacks.
   Wijeratne said the Tigers, pushed out of the northern Jaffna
peninsula by Indian peacekeeping troops, had moved south and were
hiding in rock caves in the dense jungles near areas the massacres
occurred.
   He declined to give details of the joint Indian-Sri Lankan
offensive against the Tigers, which he said would be ``one of the
biggest flushing-out operations'' ever seen in the country.
   ``The military strategies are being worked out by the commanders
of both armies,'' he said.
   Tamil guerrillas were blamed for 12 of the 25 killings in the
past 24 hours, while Sinhalese extremists were responsible for six
deaths, officials said Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Indian troops shot and killed one Tamil militant and it was not
known who was responsible for the deaths of six others, suspected to
be Sinhalese extremists.
   More than 8,500 people have been killed since the Tamil
insurrection for an independent Tamil state started in 1983. Most of
the victims have been Sinhalese civilians.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million people. They say they are discriminated against in jobs,
education and culture by the mostly-Buddhist Sinhalese, who comprise
75 percent of the population, and hold most top government and
military jobs.
   Indian peacekeeping troops have been deployed in Sri Lanka since
July 1987 to help mediate an end to the Tamil insurgency, provoking
a Sinhalese-militant backlash.
   Sinhalese militants have killed more than 1,500 people, mostly
government supporters, in their campaign against government efforts
to end the Tamil insurgency. They claim the government makes too
many concessions to Tamil separatists.

<TEXT>
   Police have arrested three local
officials and several other people accused of inciting unrest by
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo province, authorities and news reports
said Thursday.
   The arrests followed widespread protests against planned
constitutional changes that ethnic Albanians fear will limit their
autonomy in the southern province, which borders Albania.
   The official Tanjug news agency said authorities arrested Azem
Vlasi, one of the most popular Communist Party leaders among ethnic
Albanians in the province, and two directors of a mine whose
workers' strike helped set off the wave of protests. The report did
not say when they were detained.
   Tomislav Sekulic, the secretary of Kosovo's Communist leadership,
announced Thursday that police began arresting an unspecified number
of ethnic Albanians who allegedly organized the recent protests
there.
   Officials in the republic of Serbia, of which Kosovo is an
adminstrative part, have claimed that the protests were orchestrated
by alleged Albanian separatists whose ultimate aim, they say, is for
the region to secede from Yugoslavia in order to join neighboring
communist Albania.
   Serbia claims it needs closer control over Kosovo in order to
protect the Slav minority there which alleges constant persecution
and harassment by ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the
region's population.
   The situation in Kosovo, where emergency measures were introduced
Monday in an attempt to prevent possible intercommunal clashes
between ethnic Albanians and Slavs, appeared to have returned to
normal on Thursday.
   The strikes that have plagued the region for the past two weeks
ceased as authorities ordered about 23,500 employees in essential
services back to work.
   Serbia's ambitious Communist party boss, Slobodan Milosevic,
vowed on Tuesday at a counterdemonstration by over 500,000 Serbs in
Belgrade that organizers of the recent ethnic Albanian protest and
strikes in Kosovo would be ``punished and arrested.''
   Vlasi, 41, an ethnic Albanian who headed the provincial party's
ruling Politburo from 1986 to 1988, was the chief opponent of
Milosevic's push for more centralized government.
   For his consistent opposition to Serbia's policies towards Kosovo
he was voted out of the country's 165-member policy-setting Central
Committee. He is still a member of Kosovo's Central Committee.
   Also detained were two directors of the Trepca lead and zinc
mine, Aziz Abrasi and Burhan Kavaja, the state Tanjug news agency
reported.
   The mine was the scene of an eight-day sit-in last week by over
1,300 ethnic Albanian miners who protested planned changes in the
constitution which would bring Kosovo under tighter control of
Serbia.
   The miners agreed to come out of their pits only after three
leading Kosovo officials, including the current provincial party
boss Rahman Morina, resigned.
   The trio, although ethnic Albanians, are considered supporters of
Milosevic's policy of seeking tighter Serbian control of the
province.
   A brief Tanjug dispatch said that Vlasi, Abrasi and Kavaja had
been arrested ``on the basis of data indicating that by their
activities in November 1988 and February 1989 they have committed
crimes punishable under Yugoslav laws.''
   The three ``would be handed over to judicial organs for further
investigation and possible trial,'' Tanjug said.
   In November, up to 100,000 ethnic Albanians demonstrated in the
provincial capital of Pristina, protesting Vlasi's ouster from the
Kosovo Politburo as demanded by Serbian leaders.
   The direct reason for Vlasi's arrest was believed to be his
secret visit to the Trepca mine protesters.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has conveyed a U.S. request
that Ethiopia press Sudanese rebels to allow free passage for
international food convoys to avoid mass starvation, a senior
American diplomat said Thursday.
   Kenneth Brown, deputy assistant secretary of state for Africa,
also urged the embattled Sudanese government to sign a cease-fire
with the rebels so food supplies can get to as many as 2 million
needy people in government-controlled areas.
   Brown spoke to a joint session of the House Select Committee on
Hunger and the subcommittee on Africa, which adopted a resolution
calling on the administration to enlist Soviet help in resolving the
Sudan crisis.
   The resolution, and a similar one adopted by the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, also urged the administration to reassess its
aid to Sudan unless the government facilitates food deliveries and
negotiates peace with the rebels.
   Brown told the hearing Secretary of State James Baker III is
aware of demands by members of Congress that the State Department
appoint a special envoy to mediate between the Ethiopian-backed
rebels and the U.S.-backed government.
   ``That may well be the way to go,'' Brown said, ``but right now
it would not have the effect we want.''
   The State Department will not take any action until the
government crisis is resolved in Sudan, he indicated. The Sudanese
military has given Prime Minister Sadiq Mahdi an ultimatum to sign a
proposed cease-fire agreement with the rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army.
   The military did not say what it would do if Mahdi failed to
comply, but Mahdi threatened to resign next week unless the army
promises not to overthrow him and leaders of trade and professional
unions pledge not to strike.
   The SPLA, predominantly Christian, has been fighting for six
years for economic and social concessions from the Moslem-dominated
northern government.
   Critics have accused the government of a plan to starve the
southerners to death, whether in rebel-held areas or in refugee
encampments in the central sector and around Khartoum.
   The State Department, which officially attributes the problem to
government inefficiency, has privately expressed increasing
frustration with the government's neglect of southern refugees in
areas it controls.

   The State Department said Thursday it is
reviewing its immigration policy in order to accommodate the large
number of Jewish and other applicants from the Soviet Union.
   Department spokesman Charles Redman said 13,000 Soviets arrived
in Vienna during the four-month period starting on Oct. 1 and the
vast majority have requested resettlement in the United States.
   Many of these individuals have already proceeded to Rome where
they may make formal refugee applications, he said, adding that no
one is being denied entry to the United States.
   ``As of Jan. 31, some 3,400 individuals were awaiting their
refugee interviews in Rome,'' he said. ``An additional 1,850 were
approved and pending departure to the United States.''
   He said the overall backlog at the end of January was less than
7,000.
   The administration is reviewing its refugee policy and examining
several options to address the increase in Soviet emigration as well
as other refugee issues, he said.
   ``We will consult with the Congress when we have specific actions
to propose,'' he added.

   The Health Insurance Association of America
said Thursday the private sector can meet the demands of the
country's long-term health care needs with a minimum of government
involvement.
   The association released two surveys it says show the insurance
industry can meet long-term care needs at a cost that most Americans
are willing to pay.
   Long-term care services, which cost about $50 billion annually in
1987, are expected to grow to $120 billion in 2018 as the U.S.
population ages, the association estimated.
   In one of the surveys, the association determined that the number
of companies offering coverage for long-term care has grown sixfold
over four years, from 16 in 1984 to 105 last year.
   Since 1986, the number of policies sold has risen from 150,000 to
more than 1.1 million as of the end of 1988, the association said.
   Another survey, conducted by the University of Maryland's Center
on Aging, found that 60 percent of those polled said
government-funded long-term care programs should be restricted to
the most needy. However, three-quarters said they would favor the
government helping people buy private long-term care coverage, the
survey said.
   The survey polled 1,003 adults living in residential households
in the continental United States. They were questioned by telephone
last year between Oct. 13 and Nov. 28.

   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
485,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said the wheat was part of an
authorization on Jan. 25 of more than 2 million tons under the
Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Sims said the wheat is for shipment for April. Counting some left
over from a previous arrangement and the Jan. 25 authorization, the
Soviets have 525,200 tons still available under the program.
   With the latest sale, the Soviet Union has bought almost 3.5
million tons of wheat for delivery in the sixth year of a long-term
supply agreement, which was extended last fall to run through Dec.
31, 1990.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 485,000 tons are equal to about 17.8 million bushels
worth around $73 million at recent U.S. farm prices.
   The arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and other
designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in
order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or
subsidies.
   Sales for delivery in the sixth year of the agreement also
included about 10.2 million tons of corn, along with 450,000 tons of
soybeans, 1.4 million tons of soybean meal and 507,400 tons of grain
sorghum.
   Sims said the 485,000 tons of wheat were sold by: the Peavey Co.,
110,000 tons; Continental Grain Co., 100,000; Bunge Corp., 100,000;
Ferruzzi USA Inc., 150,000, and Mitsubishi International, 25,000.
   The companies will get subsidies of $22.46 per ton, or about 61
cents per bushel.

   Beijing TV bowed to popular demand and will
continue showing the American cartoon program ``The Transformers,''
even though legislators criticized it as too violent and commercial,
a newspaper said Thursday.
   The People's Daily said the station decided to keep ``The
Transformers'' on the air after conducting a survey of viewers.
   Last month 20 members of the National People's Congress, China's
legislature, urged a ban on the cartoon, saying ``the absurd
ideological content of `The Transformers,' especially its promotion
of war as something good, will poison the next generation.''
   The lawmakers also said the program contains ``disguised
advertising,'' and called for a ban on ``transformer'' toys, robots
that can be altered into cars, planes and other shapes.
   Toy robots modeled after characters in the cartoon are now hot
items in stores despite prices ranging up to $270 per set _
equivalent to a Chinese worker's annual wage.
   The cartoon is shown in translation in Beijing and Shanghai, and
several publishing houses have issued picture books of characters
from the program, which features good robots in battle against their
evil counterparts.
   The newspaper quoted a TV station official as saying the station
attaches importance to the advice of the legislators, but that they
found the cartoon is popular amoung young viewers and many people
consider it helpful for developing a child's intelligence and
imagination.
   Shanghai's Xinmin Evening News said the cartoon was full of
``wisdom, enthusiasm and advice'' to young viewers ``about the
distinction between justice and hegemony, kindness and bellicosity.''

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court was asked Thursday to delay
the partial merger of The Detroit News and Detroit Free Press to
give opponents of the business agreement time for further appeal.
   Attorneys for Public Citizen, a Washington advocacy group founded
by Ralph Nader, said in their motion a delay is justified because
they have ``a strong chance of success in their petition'' asking
the Supreme Court to consider the case, which would be filed within
30 days.
   The motion was filed with Chief Justice William Rehnquist on
behalf of Michigan Citizens for an Independent Press, a coalition of
newspaper readers and advertisers who have been battling the
proposed agreement.
   Bill Schultz, an attorney for Public Citizen, said the court
likely would decide in June whether to hear the case. If the court
accepts the appeal, a final decision on the newspapers' joint
operating agreement could come as late as next spring, Schultz said.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
last week rejected opponents' request for a rehearing. The court
ruled the newspapers' joint operating agreement could go into effect
late Monday or afterward.
   Under the proposed agreement, an exemption to anti-trust laws
under the Newspaper Preservation Act, the News and the Free Press
would combine their business and production departments while
maintaining separate news and editorial operations.
   The profits from the combined newspapers would be split 50-50 for
most of the 100-year life of the agreement.
   Attorneys for the newspapers said they would file an early
response to the motion.
   The owner of the News, Gannett Co. Inc. of Arlington, Va.,
declined comment on the opponents' motion. A spokesman for the Free
Press' owner, Knight-Ridder Inc. of Miami, was unavailable for
comment.
   In their motion, the opponents argued the case was important
because the precedent it sets ``will determine the fate of
newspapers in the 25 American cities that have competing daily
newspapers.''
   They also argued the case would have an impact on the extent to
which a court can review administrative actions by federal agencies.
   The newspapers proposed the agreement in 1986 shortly after
Gannett purchased the News.
   Then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III approved the anti-trust
exemption last year, and it has since survived a federal district
court challenge and an appeal.
   Knight-Ridder has said lack of a joint operating agreement would
force it to close the Free Press.

<TEXT>
   It cost at least $6 million and took
almost 10 years to convict and execute Ted Bundy, but Attorney
General Bob Butterworth says it was worth the time and money.
   ``I personally believe Ted Bundy was the type of person, that if
he had escaped or could have been let loose at some point in time,
would have killed again,'' Butterworth said Wednesday.
   Bundy was executed Jan. 24, for murdering a 12-year-old Lake City
girl, ending nearly a decade of appeals of that conviction and a
second convicition and death sentence for murdering two Florida
State University students.
   ``Ted Bundy in his last days admitted killing about 36,''
Butterworth said. ``I don't believe society had any other choice but
to make sure that he was convicted, that he was incarcerated and
that he was executed.''
   Death penalty opponents say it would have been cheaper to lock
him up for life. Although Butterworth disagrees, no one has precise
costs.
   State prison officials say it now costs almost $36 a day _ or
about $13,000 a year _ to hold each inmate, but costs for inmates
requiring extra security or other extras would be higher. On death
row, with the state-paid legal help that is usually provided, the
costs are yet higher.
   ``I'd personally be surprised if it's less than $100,000 a year
for a person on death row,'' Butterworth said.
   Some officials estimate overall costs, including investigations
in other states, at up to $10 million in the Bundy case. Butterworth
spokesman Tom Hillstrom said estimates in the range of $6 million to
$7 million ``are credible figures'' for total costs including prison
housing, legal aid, investigation and prosecution.
   A Washington law firm donated almost $1 million worth of lawyers'
time and $100,000 in expenses representing Bundy on appeal.
   ``In terms of time and dollars, the Bundy case would have
absolutely overwhelmed us,'' said Larry Spalding, director of the
state office that usually handles such appeals.

   Doctors say they will know within a month whether the hourlong
surgery endured by Valerie Pida succeeded in restoring blood flood
into bone in both her legs.
   She hobbled home from the City of Hope Hospital in Los Angeles on
crutches Wednesday night and was back in class Thursday at
University of Nevada-Las Vegas.
   ``How she does it, Lord knows,'' said her father, Bob Pida. ``She
hopes that her courage will inspire others.''
   Ms. Pida, now 21, was diagnosed as having Hodgkin's disease at
age 13.
   She underwent a life-saving but painful bone marrow transplant at
City of Hope in early 1987. Doctors told her she had no chance of
living without the transplant and a 20 percent to 30 percent chance
of survival with it.
   Las Vegans contributed more than $150,000 to help defray costs
and her brother was the donor.
   Wednesday's surgery was needed because eight years of radiation
and other therapy had blocked the blood flow into certain areas of
the femur or thigh bone, in both legs, effectively killing the head
of the bone. Doctors drilled holes in the bones in an effort to
restore blood flow.
   Pida said his daughter refused general anesthesia or spinal tap
to block the pain, opting for local anesthetic.
   ``She has bad feelings about being put to sleep,'' Pida said.
``She said it was the worst pain she's ever felt.
   ``But she's been through so much pain in her life, she probably
doesn't realize how much she went through. She said later she must
have broken the nurse's hand she was holding.''
   Pida said doctors told Valerie that if she continues to have pain
in a month, they will know the surgery failed. The next step would
be to replace the bone with plastic parts.
   The second anniversary of the marrow transplant _ considered a
significant date in the success of the procedure _ is a few weeks
away.

<HEAD>Rock's Jefferson Airplane To Fly Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Jefferson Airplane, whose soaring vocals
and political lyrics helped define the psychedelic rock of San
Francisco's flower power era, will fly again.
   Grace Slick, Paul Kantner, Jorma Kaukonen and Jack Casady are
planning to reunite for the first time in 17 years and are
reportedly close to signing a recording contract.
   Marty Balin, who left the group after the ``Volunteers'' album in
1969, hasn't come aboard yet, but Kantner is still hoping the singer
will become part of the ``born-again Airplane.''
   ``I think we had all thought about reorganizing the Airplane in
the last few years,' Kantner said after the reunion was announced
Wednesday. He said the idea ``really came together'' after his own
group played at the new Fillmore auditorium in March 1988.
   ``Grace came out to sing at that show and we all felt very good _
Jorma and Jack seemed to like the idea of us all working together
again, and we'd all written new songs and wanted to perform them,''
Kantner said.
   Slick, whose powerful vocals made ``White Rabbit'' and ``Somebody
To Love'' rock'n'roll classics, also sang with Kantner earlier in
1988 at San Francisco's Great American Music Hall.
   The two once lived together and have a daughter, China.
   The Airplane's albums included ``Surrealistic Pillow,'' ``After
Bathing At Baxter's,'' ``Crown of Creation,'' ``Bless Its Pointed
Little Head,'' ``Volunteers,'' ``Bark'' and ``Long John Silver.''
   Casady and Kaukonen formed ``Hot Tuna,'' an acoustic blues band,
in the early 1970s and eventually left the Airplane. Slick and
Kantner worked on several projects together and formed the Jefferson
Starship in 1974.
   Kantner left the Jefferson Starship in 1984, and his departure
led to a legal battle with Slick over money and use of the band's
name. A settlement in 1987 gave the group the right to use the name
Starship; Kantner got $250,000. Slick set out on a solo career early
last year.
   ``Grace seems `reborn' after leaving the Starship group _ she's
become involved in the World Wildlife Fund organization and one of
her new songs is dedicated to pandas,'' Kantner said.
   ``The four of us _ myself, Grace, Jorma and Jack _ are planning
to record, with Ron Nevison producing ... later this spring,'' he
said. Nevison ``was on our road production crew years ago, and now
he's a big record producer.''
   ``We haven't signed a contract, yet; and yes, RCA _ our original
label _ is interested.''
   ``With the record finished and on the market by midsummer, we
hope to go on tour, and we hope, along the way, that Marty will
rejoin us,'' Kantner said. ``Marty has been involved in his own
thing for quite a while and we don't know, now, how he feels about
joining the born-again Airplane. He's very much his own man, you
know.''
   Kantner said each group member will probably have three songs on
the new album. ``Mine will be poetical-political statements like
`Falling in Love with Nicaragua.'''
   Slick said the reunion ``was loose, it wasn't planned.'' She said
the reaction to last year's Fillmore show ``was more striking than
we planned. So we thought we'd make a record.''

   A guerrilla's confession and a captured
rebel communique showed that insurgents were responsible for killing
an emerald dealer and 18 other people at a ranch this week, police
said Thursday.
   The emerald dealer, Gilberto Molina, was reputedly a vehement
anti-communist who allegedly organized death squads to kill peasants
who sympathized with guerrillas.
   Authorities say Molina was the target of two previous rebel
assassination attempts.
   National police said they captured one of the approximately 50
guerrillas who were disguised as national policemen when they showed
up at Molina's ranch on Monday.
   The police have not allowed reporters to see a rebel communique
that they say points to insurgent involvement in the slaying, or to
interview the alleged guerrilla said to belong to the Colombian
Revolutionary Armed Forces.
   Killed along with Molina were 14 of his bodyguards, his chief of
security, a business partner of Molina's, a musician and Molina's
chauffeur, national police said in the communique issued Thursday.
   The attackers showed up at Molina's ranch at 2 a.m. Monday saying
they were searching for a reputed drug trafficker, Gonzalo Rodriguez
Gacha.
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says Rodriguez is one of
the country's biggest drug traffickers. Leftist guerrilla groups
have said Rodriguez helped Molina organize right-wing death squads.
   Within 24 hours of the massacre two communist leaders were slain
in Bogota in what newspapers in the capital said was revenge for the
massacre. The two were Teofilo Forero, the secretary of Colombia's
communist party, and Antonio Stelo Pineda, a member of the party's
central committee.

   Jose Luis Hernandez put three ``cousins' on
Eastern Airlines Flight 80, a red-eye bound for New York via
Atlanta. A little later he boarded six more.
   ``Oh, they're my cousins, too,'' he told a Los Angeles Times
reporter. But he also admitted shuttling illegal aliens.
   In all Tuesday night, Hernandez boarded 12 ``cousins,'' young men
arriving in twos and threes, most carrying no luggage. Some held
grocery bags filled with belongings. All spoke Spanish.
   They were bound for a better life in New York, using Eastern
Airlines as what immigration officials call an unknowing conduit in
a transcontinental smuggling operation.
   Those 12 apparently made it to their destination. They were
luckier than 69 suspected illegal immigrants from Central and South
America who boarded the same flight just 24 hours before only to be
apprehended by Immigration and Naturalization agents.
   Earlier that same day, 79 others who had taken Flight 80 were
picked up when the plane stopped for refueling in Atlanta.
   And on Wednesday, agents arrested 27 allegedly illegal aliens
aboard a Piedmont Airlines flight during a morning stop in
Charlotte, N.C., between Phoenix and New York.
   By Thursday, 206 suspected illegal immigrants being smuggled east
on airlines had been taken into custody at airports in Los Angeles,
Atlanta and Charlotte, federal authorities said.
   Some of those arrested in the Eastern raids said they paid as
much as $4,000 for a package deal that included transportation from
home, housing, the plane ticket and a job in New York.
   Hernandez, a Salvadoran who says he lives in Orange County, meets
illegals who have crossed the border at Tijuana. He says he escorts
them to Los Angeles International Airport and makes sure they board
Eastern Flight 80.
   ``Yes, I'm a smuggler,'' Hernandez told the newspaper.
   Six of the men admitted they were illegal immigrants headed for
New York, the newspaper said.
   ``I don't have a job there yet, but I hope to,'' said one alien,
who said he was from the Mexican state of Zacatecas. ``We're not
looking for trouble,'' one of the others interjected. ``We just want
to feed our families.''
   Hernandez said the recent INS attention to the flight caused no
alarm.
   ``What are they going to do to me?'' he said. ``Send me home? I
could be back in no time.''

   Larger supplies of most citrus fruit are
keeping grower prices down from a year ago, although the possible
effects of recent freeze damage in some areas have not been
determined, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   The department's Economic Research Service said that ``U.S.
season-average grower prices for oranges and grapefruit are expected
to be lower than last season, while the average lemon price may be
slightly higher.''
   Total citrus output in 1988-89 ``will likely show a modest
increase from 1987-88, primarily reflecting the recovery from the
freeze damage Florida and Texas suffered in the early 1980s,'' the
report said.
   ``However, the forecast, which is based on conditions around Feb.
1, did not reflect the subfreezing temperatures'' reported in
Arizona and California.

<HEAD>Ultra-right Parliament Members Snubbed On Opening Day</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Members of the ultra-right Republican Party walked
into the West Berlin parliament on opening day Thursday to take the
first seats they had ever won. Most of the other members walked out.
   Protesters in the gallery shouted ``Nazis out!'' and ``We don't
want Nazi pigs!'' Guards removed them.
   When party leader Bernhard Andres rose to speak, the chamber was
nearly deserted.
   Andres and the Republicans, who advocate ridding the city of
foreign workers and foreigners seeking asylum, surprised the pundits
by winning 11 seats in the Jan. 29 elections.
   The Christian Democrats and Social Democrats have 55 seats each
and the remaining 17 places in the 138-member parliament are held by
the Alternative List, the West Berlin branch of West Germany's
environmentalist Greens Party.
   At the beginning of Thursday's session, several members of the
Alternative List refused to sit near the Republicans. They and the
left-of-center Social Democrats left the chamber and some members of
the conservative Christian Democrats walked out when Andres rose to
speak.
   Before the elections, West Berlin was governed by a coalition of
the Christian and Social Democrats, but the next government may be a
Social Democrat-Alternative List coalition.
   Andres said in his maiden speech that such an administration
would ``lead to street terror and would be a threat to honest
citizens.
   ``When you take off their Red-Green jackets, you might find brown
shirts underneath,'' he said in reference to the two parties.
   The Brown Shirts were thugs who roamed the streets committing
violence in the early Nazi years.
   Heinz Galinski, head of the German Jewish Council, said he was
saddened to see ``an extreme right-wing party once again using
parliament as a stage to preach its ideology.''

<TEXT>
   Congressional Democrats named economist Robert
D. Reischauer on Thursday to head the Congressional Budget Office,
placing him in the middle of this year's budget jousting between
Congress and the Bush administration.
   Reischauer, a former CBO official who is currently senior fellow
at the Brookings Institution in Washington, is considered moderate
and pragmatic by Democrats and Republicans. His selection ended a
search that pitted House and Senate Democrats against each other,
resulting in a stalemate that left the position unfilled for two
years.
   CBO is expected to perform as a non-partisan advisor to Congress,
even though in this case its director is being appointed by the
leaders of a House and Senate that are both controlled by Democrats.
   Reischauer will begin work in the $82,500-a-year job on Monday.
   The 48-year-old Reischauer advised Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis during his presidential campaign last year. He is credited
with the Democrat's proposal to create special savings accounts for
families wishing to accumulate money for college expenses.
   Reischauer joined CBO when it was created in 1975. By the time he
left the agency in 1981, he had become deputy director. He worked
for the Urban Institute from 1981 to 1986, when he joined Brookings.
   He has a Ph.D. in economics from Columbia University, and has
written about the federal budget, state and local fiscal problems,
the economics of education, revenue sharing, and welfare policy.
   CBO has been without a director since March 1987, when Rudolph
Penner left. Edward M. Gramlich became acting director and was
succeeded by James L. Blum, who will now return to his job as an
assistant director of the office.
   During the two years, the former chairmen of Congress' two budget
committees, Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., and Rep. William H. Gray
III, D-Pa., championed their own candidates for the director's job
but failed to agree on a single individual.
   Chiles left Congress and Gray is no longer chairman. Sen. Jim
Sasser, D-Tenn., and Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., became the new
chairmen in January, and quickly agreed to Reischauer's appointment.

<HEAD>Dinosaur Bones Found In Antarctica</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fossil bones of a plant-eating dinosaur found in
the Antarctic prove there was a mild climate there 70 million years
ago, a British scientist said Thursday.
   ``We discovered jawbones, much of the vertebral column and the
fore limbs, which identify the animal as a bird-hipped dinosaur
similar to hypsilophodon, which has been found in Australia, North
Amerca, Europe and possibly North Africa,'' said Michael Thomson, a
scientist who led an expedition to the area.
   ``There could not have been much ice or snow in the region in
those days because the dinosaur was a land animal and it wouldn't
have liked frosty nights.''
   He said the dinosaur was about 10 feet long and walked on its
hind legs.
   Thomson, 46, spoke in a telephone interview from Cambridge, where
he is head of geology at the British Antarctic Survey.
   He said the expedition also found shells, especially ammonites;
fossilized leaves from conifers and broad-leaved trees, as well as
tree trunks and ferns, proving there was a food source for the
dinosaur.
   Thomson said the fossils were found during a six-week geological
research cruise this year around the north and east of James Ross
Island in British Antarctic Territory, 700 miles from the tip of
South America.
   He said the dinosaur bones were picked up and given to him by
Peter Bengtson, a Swedish paleontologist who joined scientists from
Britain, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand for the voyage on the
survey ship John Biscoe.
   ``Three years ago, we found some bones of a marine reptile, the
plesiosaur, and as Argentine geologists had found fragments of an
armored dinosaur in Antarctica, I knew it was a likely place for
other finds,'' Thomson said.
   The bones were in shallow-water marine rocks and Thomson said the
beast probably died on land and floated out to sea before becoming
buried and fossilized.
   ``There were active volcanoes nearby in those times and the area
would have been something like Indonesia is today,'' he added.
   Thomson described the area as several square miles of bare rock
with only mosses and lichens _ ``and not many of those'' _ growing
there now.
   The continents in the Southern Hemisphere were once a single land
mass that has been named Gondwanaland. About 150 million years ago,
it began to split apart, eventually to form South America, Africa,
Australia and Antarctica.
   The newly found dinosaur would have been one of the last of its
kind because the animals were starting to die out about that time,
when Antarctica was still close to South America and Australia was
only starting to break away, Thomson said.
   The bones are now under study at the Natural History Museum in
London, where they may eventually be put on display.

<HEAD>Oil Leak Is Stopped from Ship Grounded In Antarctica</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Chilean navy frogmen plunged into icy
Antarctic waters on Thursday and sealed the tanks of a grounded
Peruvian scientific ship to stop an oil leak that caused a
half-mile-long slick, the navy reported.
   The leak ceased entirely by midafternoon, and Chilean sailors set
out floating booms around the vessel, the Humdoldt, to stop further
spread of the oil, the navy said in a communique issued in Punta
Arenas, 1,550 miles south of Santiago.
   A navy spokesman in Punta Arenas, Lt. Cristian Carbone, told The
Associated Press by telephone that ``our priority task at this point
is to contain the spill. Floating the Humboldt comes next.''
   He said the crews are operating out of the cutter Yelcho, which
arrived at the site at dawn Thursday, and that the frogmen are
working with colleagues from nearby Uruguayan and South Korean
Antarctic stations.
   The frogmen confirmed after completing their inspection that the
Humboldt sustained no serious damage and refloating the vessel
should not be difficult, Carbone said.
   The Humboldt run aground shortly before midnight Sunday at the
entrance of Marion Cove, on King George Island. All 64 scientists
and sailors aboard were rescued unharmed by the British navy's ice
patrol ship Endurance. On Wednesday, some of the sailors returned to
the ship to help with the operations.
   Carbone said the barrier set up around the Humboldt is the same
type used a month ago to contain an oil spill caused by the Bahia
Paraiso (Paradise Bay), an Argentine navy vessel that run aground
off the Antarctic peninsula.

   A House subcommittee chairman said Thursday he
won't try to block the Pentagon's request for a Trident nuclear
submarine this year, but warned the Navy must slow its one-a-year
purchase rate of the missile-firing sub if it wants to create a
600-ship Navy.
   ``I'm in no way running down the Trident,'' Rep. Charles E.
Bennett, D-Fla., told Navy officials. ``I'm just trying to get the
Navy to reach its 600-ship goal. ... We're very short in other
ships.''
   An 18,500-ton Trident, at $1.3 billion, is much more expensive
than most Navy ships. Delaying a Trident for a year could free money
for several surface ships.
   Bennett, chairman of the House Armed Services seapower
subcommittee, last year successfully had the Trident scratched from
the budget and added two Aegis destroyers with the extra money, but
Trident money was eventually restored.
   Last month, Bennett said he would look at eliminating money for
the nation's 17th Trident from the fiscal 1990 budget, but he said
Thursday that the timing of an elimination was wrong and he said he
will support the program. The pledge virtually eliminated any threat
to the Trident this year.
   Vice Adm. Daniel Cooper, assistant chief of naval operations for
undersea warfare, told the subcommittee a one-year delay in the
Trident would result in $150 million to $170 million in added costs
in fiscal 1991.
   Cooper attributed the projected increase to the added cost of
breaking the ``learning curve'' and halting the government's
contractual agreements with the Electric Boat Division of General
Dynamics Corp. Electric Boat is the sole builder of Tridents.
   Bennett said the Navy should avoid long-term contract options so
the government can skip a Trident purchase without suffering
financially.
   Rep. John G. Rowland, R-Conn., estimated that striking the sub
funding would result in the loss of 3,000 jobs at Electric Boat's
plants in Groton, Conn., and North Kingstown, R.I.
   Cooper assured lawmakers that despite technological gains by the
Soviets, the U.S. submarine force remains ``the best ... in the
world today.''
   The Navy official defended the Pentagon's newest submarine, the
SSN-21 Seawolf attack submarine, against critics who say it may not
be able to compete against advanced Soviet subs.
   The Navy ordered the first Seawolf from Electric Boat in January.
   Cooper said Navy officials scrapped plans to order two more
SSN-688 Los Angeles class attack submarines in 1991 and a final
SSN-688 in 1992 in part to show their commitment to the Seawolf. The
Navy's plan now calls for the final two SSN-688 subs to be purchased
in the fiscal 1990 budget now under consideration by Congress.
   The Seawolf will be faster, quieter, have the ability to dive
deeper and have more fire power than the Los Angeles class sub, plus
it will be big enough for future improvements, Cooper said. The Los
Angeles class sub is so packed now that any added improvements would
entail removal of systems already in the sub, he said.

   A witness in Oliver North's criminal trial
testified Thursday he heard North suggest at a meeting of Nicaraguan
rebels that they open a new military front and block a government
supply route by sinking a barge in a river.
   ``Basically,'' said Rafael Quintero, ``North ran the meeting.''
   North, who was an aide to then-President Reagan's National
Security Council, is on trial on 12 criminal charges. One accusation
is that he drafted letters to Congress saying he had no involvement
in the Contra effort to overthrow the leftist Nicaraguan government
at a time when U.S. law prohibited official aid to the rebels.
   The meeting, in a Miami Airport hotel room, was in June 1985,
Quintero testified. North is accused of lying to Congress in 1985
and 1986 by denying involvement.
   The defense, in its questions, brought out testimony from
Quintero about many contacts he said he had with CIA people
stationed in Central America and with military officials in
countries in the area _ questioning intended to convey to the jury
that there was widespread involvement by the U.S. government in the
Contra supply effort.
   For example, Quintero said whenever he entered El Salvador he had
to clear with the U.S. military commander there ``every step of the
operation'' and ``basically everything that was to be done in
Salvador had to be done through him.''
   The sixth witness in the trial, following Quintero, was Richard
B. Gadd, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who said he arranged
for aircraft to carry military goods covertly to the Contras at the
request of a North colleague, retired Maj. Gen. Richard Secord.
   He was still being questioned by prosecutor Michael Bromwich when
U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell dismissed the jury until
Monday. Friday will be devoted to legal arguments on whether new
rules are required for handling classified documents.
   Also on Friday, U.S. District Judge Aubrey Robinson will sentence
North's one-time boss, former National Security Adviser Robert
McFarlane, who pleaded guilty to four misdemeanors involving
withholding information from Congress. McFarlane, who is scheduled
as a witness at the North trial, asked to be sentenced before he
testified.
   Quintero said participants at the meeting in Miami discussed
opening a southern front as a way of getting the Sandinistas to draw
away some of the 60,000 Sandinista troops from the Honduran border
in the north. And the possibility was raised of obstructing the Rama
River where, the witness said, 80 percent of the Sandinistas'
supplies crossed.
   He used a map and pointer while he spoke and North, who had never
before moved from the defense table during testimony, crossed the
room so that he could follow the demonstration.
   ``Who suggested obstructing the river?'' asked prosecution lawyer
Michael Bromwich.
   ``Mr. North did,'' said Quintero.
   Also attending the meeting, he said, were Contra leaders Adolfo
Calero and Enrique Bermudez as well as Secord and an associate
Thomas Clines, an ex-CIA official. Both Secord and his associate
were involved in obtaining arms and shipping them to the Contras.
   Quintero, testifying under immunity from prosecution, said he got
involved in the covert Contra activities through a call from Secord.
   He described himself as ``a combination soldier and logistics
expert'' who fought in the revolution that overthrew Fulgencio
Batista in Cuba. He said he became disenchanted when Fidel Castro
allied himself with the Soviet Union. Quintero said he came to the
United States, was trained by the CIA and was back in Cuba to work
with the resistance in the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion that failed.
   His mission in the North operation, he said, ``was to help the
Contras stay alive for the priod of time until Congress resumed aid
to the Nicaraguan Contras.'' He was hired, at $4,000 a month, plus a
bonus for each shipment of arms he got to the Contras. He made 16
trips to Central America from January to June 1986 to oversee
construction of an airstrip to be used for the southern military
front.
   Quintero also testified he once heard North say that President
Reagan backed clandestine efforts to resupply the Contras.
   This was, Quintero said, at a 1986 meeting in El Salvador when a
high Salvadoran official declared he ``was not going to stick his
neck out and have it cut off.''
   ``Mr. North pointed out the president was very much aware of the
efforts this high Salvadoran official was doing, that the president
wanted these efforts to continue'' he added.
   Speaking in heavily accented English, Quintero also told of
another time _ early 1986 in El Salvador _ when North helped settle
a dispute between Contra factions over which should receive air
drops of supplies.
   North decreed that Col. James Steele, former commander of U.S.
forces in El Salvador, and Joe Fernandez, CIA station chief in Costa
Rica, should have the final word, Quintero said.
   The testimony was elicited from Quintero by the prosecution in an
effort to show North exercised much control in the Contra fight from
his post in the White House complex. North has said everything he
did was with approval from superiors.

<HEAD>Nuclear-Powered Ship Stirs Alarm, Concerns in Soviet Far East</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nuclear-powered merchant ship bound for the
eastern Soviet Union is spreading alarm and opposition in the region
where it is heading, a newspaper said Thursday.
   The 850-foot-long ship Sevmorput is on its way to the port of
Vladivostok, the government daily Izvestia said. It said people
there ``do not conceal their alarm, linked first of all to the
(ship's) type of propulsion.''
   Government authorities in another port city in the eastern Soviet
Union, Nakhodka, supported residents' calls to close the harbor to
the vessel, which cost $260 million to build and ``has no parallel
in the world,'' Izvestia said.
   It said port authorities in Nakhodka had not yet been told what
plans exist to counter possible accidents aboard the vessel.
   Izvestia quoted the government official in the Magadan region of
the far eastern Soviet Union, located to the north of Vladivostok
and Nakhodka, as opposing the decision of the Ministry of Merchant
Marine to dispatch the newly built ship to the area.
   ``It seems to me the ministry has allowed a mistake by deciding
to send the Sevmorput without asking the advice of the territory,''
G. Dorofeyev was quoted as saying. Local coastal zones, he said,
``are practically not ready to receive it.''
   ``Anything can happen,'' Dorofeyev said. ``In our land, the
extreme north, natural cataclysms are not rare.''
   The Soviet Union has other atomic-powered merchant ships,
including a fleet of icebreakers based in the port of Murmansk 1,000
miles north of Moscow.
   The icebreakers have functioned safely for decades, authorities
say, but in Murmansk some residents now are calling for the vessels
to be moved to a port further away from the city of 440,000 people.
   Opposition to nuclear power has swelled in the Soviet Union since
the April 1986 accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the
Ukraine. In Armenia, for example, the government has begun shutting
down the republic's nuclear power plant because of the danger it
might be damaged in an earthquake.
   Izvestia quoted a Soviet nuclear power official, A. Zhuravkov, as
saying the power plant aboard the Sevmorput was of a different
design, and less liable to operator error, than the reactor that was
ruptured by a fire and explosion at Chernobyl.
   ``Sevmorput'' is a Russian-language phrase standing for
``northern sea route,'' the sea lane followed by some Soviet ships
along the northern Siberia coast between Europe and Asia. Izvestia
did not give details of the giant ship's envisioned role, but said
it was a lighter carrier, meaning it was designed to transport
smaller vessels.

<HEAD>Animal-Rights Group Urging Avon to Stop Using Animals in Tests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals
announced Thursday it plans to distribute material in the United
States, England, Italy, West Germany, Mexico and Canada in a
campaign urging Avon, the cosmetics products company, to stop using
animals for tests.
   ``Images from my 1986 visit to Avon's laboratories still haunt
me,'' said Susan Rich of the animal-rights group. She said annual
reports and letters to consumers say Avon puts out 90 percent of its
formulas without testing on animals. ``But, in 1989, no animals
should suffer to test yet another shampoo, perfume or mascara,'' she
said.
   Jim Preston, Avon's chairman and chief executive officer, said
that ``no company in the beauty industry has done more to reduce
animal testing than Avon.'' He added that Avon hopes to eliminate
all animal testing within three months.
   A company statement said Ms. Rich was told by Preston last week
of the progress the company has made. ``The company can only assume
that PETA called this boycott in a self-serving attempt to take
credit for Avon's plans to eliminate testing,'' the statement said.
   Preston said the safety of the company's consumers is its
paramount responsibility. ``PETA values human lives on a par with
the lives of rats, mice, guinea pigs and rabbits,'' Preston said.
``We do not.''

<HEAD>Studies: Classroom Sex Ed Alone Has Little Impact on Teen Sex Behavior</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For release at 6 p.m. EST.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Classroom sex education alone appears to have
little or no effect on altering sexual activity, promoting the use
of birth control or lowering teen-age pregnancy, according to a
review of five studies.
   ``There's nothing unique about sex education as opposed to other
information transmitted in school,'' said Dr. James W. Stout, a
resident at Children's Hospital and Medical Center in Seattle and a
co-author of the review.
   ``A person can have the information regarding their health, but
it doesn't automatically translate into their behavior,'' he said in
a telephone interview Thursday.
   ``A good example would be the ill health effects of cigarette
smoking, which it's probably safe to say most smokers are aware of,
and yet they still smoke.''
   Five studies from 1980 to 1987 examined the effect of classroom
sex-education programs at the junior- and senior-high school level
on teen-agers from a variety of geographical areas and racial and
socioeconomic groups, the researchers said.
   The sex-ed programs had no measurable impact on pregnancy rates,
negligible effect on the use of birth-control methods and
insignificant influence on teen-agers' decisions about when to
engage in their first sexual intercourse, the researchers reported
in the March issue of the journal Pediatrics.
   ``Existing data suggest that a classroom course alone cannot be
expected to change sexual behavior in a direction that is in
opposition to the adolescent's sexual world as it is molded by the
television, motion picture, music and advertising industries, as
well as peer group and adult role models,'' the researchers said.
   ``To place the burden of counteracting the prevailing forces in
our society toward premarital sex on our schools alone is both naive
and inappropriate,'' they said.
   Nancy Watzman, a spokeswoman for the Center for Population
Options, a non-profit organization that works to reduce teen
pregnancy, agreed with the review's conclusion.
   ``We believe in a very integrated approach,'' she said Thursday
in a telephone interview from Washington.
   The center developed a school curriculum designed to help teens
learn the consequences of sexual behavior, but it also works to
support school-based clinics that provide sexual counseling and
contraceptives, and to get the cooperation of the entertainment
industry in supporting positive images of sexuality, she said.
   Stout and his co-author, Dr. Frederick P. Rivara of Harborview
Medical Center in Seattle, pointed to 1987 findings from a
comprehensive community-wide sex-education program that was much
more successful than classroom education alone.
   The program involved parents, teachers, ministers, community
leaders and the media in a joint effort to postpone the age of
teens' first sexual experience, promote the use of consistent
contraception and lower the teen pregnancy rate.
   Two and three years after the program was initiated, the teen
pregnancy rate declined by an estimated 35 percent.
   ``I am a believer in sex education as a foundation for a
multifaceted approach to the problem,'' Stout said. ``But it's a
multifaceted problem, and it requires a multifaceted solution.''

   Large-scale, long-term detention of Central
Americans seeking asylum in the United States will not solve the
refugee problem in Texas, the chairman of the House immigration
panel said Thursday.
   Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, D-Conn., said he will search for
solutions to problems posed by a flow of Central American refugees
into Texas at Brownsville. He plans to spend two days in the Rio
Grande Valley next week.
   Morrison, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's
subcommittee on immigration, refugees and international law, said he
has no ``preconceived notions'' on the eve of his trip.
   However, he said he is concerned about whether it is humane to
detain Central American refugees pending adjudication of their
petitions for political asylum. He also wants to determine how many
will be held and how long, and whether word that refugee-seekers are
being detained is prompting many to go underground.
   The number of refugees slowed last week after the Immigration and
Naturalization Service announced refugee-seekers would be detained
while their applications are processed.
   ``Large-scale detention for any significant period of time is
never going to be a very good answer for people whose only crime is
to cross the border illegally in search of sanctuary from either
political persecution or economic deprivation,'' Morrison said in an
interview.
   ``These people are doing what has been done for a long time in
this country _ people coming looking for opportunity. We cannot be a
refuge for every person in Central America who would like a better
life ... but putting those people in detention for significant
periods of time is not going to solve the problem either.''
   Morrison said he also wants to assess the impact refugees have
had on local communities, and what can be done about illegal
trafficking in aliens _ the smuggling of asylum-seekers along the
route from Central America.

<TEXT>
   Sudan's major political parties met on
Thursday in an effort to end a political and economic crisis that
threatens to topple the nearly 3-year-old regime of Prime Minister
Sadek Mahdi.
   Mahdi has given the the military one week to endorse his
government or face the consequences of his resignation. He has
announced a news conference for Sunday, when the week ends.
   Foreign Minister Hassan Turabi told the Sudan News Agency that
talks were going on between his Moslem fundamentalist National
Islamic Front, Mahdi's centrist Umma party and the Democratic
Unionist Party on the formation of a new government.
   But he said the positions of the rival parties remained far apart.
   The Democratic Unionists quit the three-party coalition
government in December to protest Mahdi's economic policies and his
refusal to approve a tentative peace treaty signed by the Democratic
Unionists and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army.
   Mahdi formed a new government with the National Islamic Front.
But last month, Defense Minister Abdel-Magid Khalil resigned and the
army presented Mahdi with a one-week ultimatum to form a new
broad-based government and take active steps to resolve the
6-year-old rebellion in the south.
   The army's ultimatum passed with no action, but the armed forces
remain on full alert and military leaders have insisted their
demands be carried out.
   Mahdi countered the army's demands with a threat to resign unless
the military gives him a mandate to continue leading the government.
   Both the armed forces and the Democratic Unionists want a
government that will include all political parties as well as
powerful trade and professional unions. The Democratic Unionist
Party already has urged Mahdi to step down.
   But Turabi on Thursday reiterated that his party rejected such a
government, and would accept only the Democratic Unionists in a
coalition.
   Turabi predicted that the political crisis will continue as long
as the armed forces refuse to heed Mahdi's requests.
   Mahdi was elected prime minister following general elections
April 25, 1986, exactly a year after the military overthrew
President Gaafar Nimeiri and then handed over the rule to civilians.
   He took over a government saddled with a $13 billion foreign debt
and a civil war that cost $1 million a day. His inability to take
decisive steps either in the economic or military fields has
prompted criticism both internally and externally.
   In Washington Thursday, a senior diplomat said the Soviet Union
had conveyed a U.S. request that Ethiopia press Sudanese rebels to
allow free passage for international food convoys to avoid mass
starvation.
   Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Kenneth Brown also
urged the Sudanese government to sign a cease-fire with the rebels
so food supplies could get to as many as 2 million needy people in
government-controlled areas.
   Brown spoke to a joint session of the House Select Committee on
Hunger and the subcommittee on Africa, which adopted a resolution
calling on the administration to enlist Soviet help in resolving the
Sudan crisis.
   The United States has given Sudan, the largest country in Africa,
about $1.7 billion over the past 10 years, but aid levels have
dropped sharply since the 1985 peak of $350 million after the ouster
of Gaafar Nimeiri, a strong pro-Western leader who was a personal
friend of President Bush.

   About 2 million workers demanding higher
wages went on strike Thursday, shutting down public transportation
and paralyzing scores of other services.
   Airports, sea ports, banks, hospitals and private schools were
closed during the 24-hour walkout. Skeleton crews were working at
the state-owned public telephone, power and water corporations.
   Although most employee groups said the strike would last one day,
bank employees announced they would extend their walkout through
Friday.
   On Thursday, more than 10,000 demonstrators marched through
central Athens shouting ``No to austerity ... We want substantial
raises!''
   The General Confederation of Greek Workers, which represents most
of the country's 3.7 million workers, said the strike was
successful, ``especially in the state-owned corporations and in
industries.''
   It called the strike to protest the Socialist government's tight
income policies and to demand that wages be linked to inflation,
which ran at a 14 percent rate in 1988, the highest in the 12-member
European Economic Community.
   The confederation said industry and government offered a 2.5
percent wage increase this year and that the wage increase in 1988
was to 1.4 percent.
   The average monthly take-home pay for Greek workers is about
70,000 drachmas, or $450, it reported.
   The Socialist government has been plagued by strikes since the
year began.
   A Feb. 22 walkout by more than 6,000 municipal sanitation workers
continued on Thursday. The strike has left tons of garbage rotting
on city streets. The workers also are demanding wage increases to
keep up with inflation.

   The Bush administration is weighing trade and
economic incentives to encourage democratic reforms in Nicaragua as
the current Contra aid package nears expiration, administration and
congressional sources said Thursday.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who huddled with members
of Congress on options for approval of new Contra aid, was said to
be open to a combination of new incentives and traditional economic
sanctions.
   The United States currently has a trade embargo with Nicaragua.
   Baker, in a series of Capitol Hill meetings, circulated a 10-page
document marked ``Secret.'' It contained general objectives for the
administration's Central American policy, and outlined political
objectives for a bipartisan policy, according to participants who
saw it.
   The administration is deciding how much aid to propose for the
U.S.-backed rebels when the current $27 million humanitarian aid
package runs out at the end of this month, and how long to maintain
funding in light of the recent Central American presidents' peace
agreement.
   That Feb. 14 pact calls for disbanding the Contra forces as
Nicaragua arranges to repatriate them and makes internal democratic
reforms, such as speeding up elections and freeing political
prisoners.
   President Bush met Thursday with Guatemalan President Vinicio
Cerezo and reiterated U.S. doubts about Nicaragua's commitment, said
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Officially the administration has not decided whether to seek a
new Contra aid package, Fitzwater said.
   But privately officials say the State Department's efforts are
geared toward putting together a new aid package that will be
acceptable to the Democratic-controlled Congress.
   Among U.S. actions sources said Baker was considering are trade
and economic incentives to help Nicaragua's failing economy if
Nicaragua lives up to its democratization pledges.
   Baker is also considering a range of possible U.S. actions that
could include such things as resumption of normalized relations on
visas, trade, foreign aid and exchange of diplomats, said one
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Fitzwater said that the president's Contra policy is still in the
formative stages.
   ``We're reviewing the matter now with a view toward the
humanitarian aid,'' Fitzwater said.
   Congressional and administration sources have said there has been
no substantive talk of renewing military aid at this point to the
11,000-member Contra force. The current humanitarian aid package
runs out before the 90-day deadline for the Central American plan to
be completed.
   ``We are looking at all aspects of this situation,'' said
Fitzwater, adding, ``We would like a diplomatic solution in terms of
some kind of proposal or agreement that all the countries in the
region can find acceptable and reasonable. And so we'll be looking
at a lot of different angles.''
   Baker's discussions on Capitol Hill were seen in part as an
effort to get moving on Central America amid accusations that Bush
is not moving in foreign affairs.
   In the case of Central America, the lack of clear direction has
sparked complaints by those interested in the region, from lobbyists
to Congress to Latin Americans themselves. Such people have grumbled
about the time Bush and Baker have taken to name middle level
officials to coordinate the policy.
   It has also intensified the spotlight on the peace talks among
the presidents of Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and
Honduras.
   The Bush administration wants its concerns addressed in the final
plan to disband the Contras.
   ``Part of what's driving them (the Central American presidents)
is our own policy vacuum,'' said an administration source who spoke
on condition of anonymity. ``They had no idea what our policy was
when they met.''
   Baker's discussions with Congress were ``to get us out of this
vacuum,'' the source said.
   Key to the administration approach is building a bipartisan basis
for a policy based on giving diplomacy a chance, said State
Department spokesman Charles Redman.
   ``We are now at a stage where we are engaging in talks in even
greater detail on that particular policy. The focus of the policy
will be democratization,'' Redman said.
   Bush and Baker continue to stress the need for mechanisms to
ensure that the Sandinistas follow through on their promises, and
for timetables tying the realization of their reforms to the
disarmament of the Contras.
   Cerezo told reporters that the Central Americans have discussed
humanitarian aid to keep the Contra force alive while Nicaragua
arranges to repatriate them.

<TEXT>
   An Iranian diplomat met Thursday with U.N.
officials to begin preparing for a joint meeting of Iran and Iraq's
foreign ministers aimed at breaking the deadlock in their peace
talks.
   Iraq's Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz and his Iranian counterpart,
Ali Akbar Velayati, agreed Feb. 10 to meet for U.N.-mediated talks
in late March or early April at an undisclosed site in New York.
   Iran's deputy foreign minister, Mohammed Hussain Lavasani, opened
two days of meetings Thursday with the secretary-general's special
representative to the talks, Swedish Ambassador Jan K. Eliasson, and
other U.N. officials.
   Next week, Iraqi representatives will meet with Eliasson and the
U.N. experts to present their views.
   Aziz, meanwhile, accused Iran of ``perverse behavior'' for
refusing to allow its military officers to meet with their Iraqi
counterparts in an effort to reduce tensions on the 740-mile front
line of the conflict, where a tenuous cease-fire has been in force
since Aug. 20.
   In late January, Iran and Iraq agreed to a variety of
confidence-building measures, including establishing a joint
military committee to discuss allegations of truce violations,
despite their failure to compromise on the fundamental issues of the
war.
   In a letter sent to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
this week, Aziz said Iran and Iraq had agreed to hold the first
meeting of the Iran-Iraq Mixed Military Working Group on Feb. 22.
   ``The Iranian side, however, broke that agreement and refused to
hold the meeting as agreed,'' Aziz said in his letter.
   Iran has not offered any official response.
   In Baghdad, a senior U.N. official said Thursday that the meeting
between Iraqi and Iranian officers can take place as soon as the
problem over its location is solved.
   Salim Fahmawi, chief spokesman for the 350-strong U.N. observer
group monitoring the gulf war cease-fire, said that both sides are
willing to hold the meeting soon.
   Both Iran and Iraq have issued bellicose pronouncements prior to
each round of their peace talks, which began in Geneva last Aug. 25
but immediately deadlocked on the key issues.
   Iran insists that the next step must be the withdrawal of troops
to the border. Iraq still holds about 260 square miles of Iranian
territory.
   Iraq, however, maintains that Iran must relinquish its right to
search ships in international waters of the gulf for Iraq-bound war
cargo. Iran has not actually stopped any ships since the beginning
of the cease-fire, but reserves its right to do so.
   Baghdad also wants the Shatt al-Arab waterway, its only outlet to
the gulf, cleared of sunken ships and silt. Iran refuses to
cooperate with any plans to open the waterway unless Baghdad
recognizes a 1975 treaty that sets the border in the middle, giving
each nation control of one bank.

<HEAD>Denver Program Reduces Carbon Monoxide in Battle Against Brown Cloud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city's Better Air Campaign couldn't induce
motorists to drive any less, but it cut carbon monoxide emissions
through its mandatory wood-burning and oxygenated fuels programs,
Denver's mayor said Thursday.
   Spurred by the success, clean air drive organizers announced
plans to expand the program next winter to include Fort Collins,
Greeley and Colorado Springs. Until now, the five-year-old Better
Air Campaign has affected only metropolitan Denver and Boulder.
   Denver Mayor Federico Pena reported the findings at a news
conference at which final Department of Health figures for this year
were released.
   Colorado began the program because of health concerns and because
officials worried that the region's infamous ``brown cloud'' was
making it less attractive to new business.
   The Better Air Campaign had no effect on driving this year, but
its mandatory oxygenated fuels program, introduced last year,
reduced carbon monoxide emissions by 12 percent and its wood-burning
program cut emissions by 6-8 percent, figures showed.
   Voluntary driving restrictions on high pollution days are in
effect from November to January, and the oxygenated fuels
requirement from October to January. The Better Air Campaign is held
during the winter, when temperature inversions typically cause air
quality to decline.
   ``Without the Better Air Campaign, public acceptance of the
wood-burning and oxygenated-fuels programs would have been more
difficult to achieve,'' Pena said.
   The federal carbon monoxide standard was violated only nine days
during the past year in downtown Denver, the figures showed,
compared with 110 days in 1971, when the health department began
keeping records of violations.
   Pena said the figures for the drive-reduction part of the program
were revised after an error was discovered in January in the 1983
base year data. Officials found the number of miles reported driven
in 1983 was 10 percent too high. Partly as a result, Better Air
Campaign figures until this year often showed reductions in miles
driven ranging up to 10 percent.
   The 1988-89 mileage figures, which showed no decrease from the
base year, were compiled after a month-long re-evaluation of the
base year figure, the mayor said.
   Brad Beckham, director of the Colorado Air Pollution Control
Division, said that besides expanding the Better Air Campaign to
other Front Range cities, the program will be revised to target all
types of air pollution on a year-round basis. The new program will
also narrow its focus to target only schools, government and
businesses instead of being a broad-based effort, he said.
   He said the program would include having employers provide ways
for employees to ride the bus more often, introduce incentives for
car-pooling and modify existing vehicles to pollute less.
   Dr. Tom Vernon, executive director of the Colorado Department of
Health, said traffic is projected to double by the year 2010 and
even though a reduction cannot be attributed to driving,
driving-reduction measures must still be included in future
campaigns.
   The Better Air Campaign was begun after studies showed vehicles
account for 75 percent of the Denver area's carbon-monoxide
pollution, while wood-burning stoves and fireplaces were blamed for
15 percent.

   CBS declared Thursday that it has shaken off the
worst effects of last summer's strike by the Writers Guild of
America, but ABC says it is suffering something of a delayed
reaction.
   NBC, thanks to the Summer Olympics and the World Series, was not
seriously affected by the 4{-month strike last summer and remains
ahead of the competition in the 1988-89 prime-time television season.
   By the end of the February sweep, one of four months a year when
local TV ratings are measured for purposes of determining
advertising rates, NBC led with an average A.C. Nielsen Co. rating
of 16.3. CBS had a 14.7 and ABC a 12.4. The rating is a percentage
of 90.4 million U.S. homes with televisions.
   The writers' strike ended in August, and the sporting events
allowed NBC to delay production of new series episodes the other two
networks had counted on.
   CBS started the season late in a weak position, having finished
third the previous season. ABC started late, too, but was soon flush
with the top-10 success of its new ``Roseanne.''
   ABC then suffered a 28 percent decline in February compared to
February 1988, when it had the Winter Olympics. NBC and CBS showed
increases this February over last.
   The four-night hit miniseries ``Lonesome Dove'' boosted CBS above
ABC in the February sweep and helped put it in a virtual tie with
its rival for second place this season.
   ``This is the first time in about six of these (sweeps) where we
can say we're closer to the first-place network than the third-place
network,'' said CBS Vice President for Marketing David Poltrack.
   ``We were the most negatively impacted by the strike. We got off
last,'' Poltrack said. ``We made some changes, made some adjustments
and we think we've turned things around and are going in the right
direction.''
   ABC got through the November sweep with help from the first 18
hours of the 32-hour miniseries ``War and Remembrance.'' It was
hardly a ratings blockbuster, but it did better than ABC's regular
programming would have. The decision to program ``War and
Remembrance'' as a November fill-in came back to haunt the network
in February when ``War and Remembrance'' was to have run.
   ``Clearly we had a disappointing sweeps,'' said Alan Wurtzel,
ABC's senior vice president for marketing and research.
   ``We did not have an enormous inventory, because we had to play
`War and Remembrance' early, and we had planned to play it in
February,'' he said. ``The other two networks knew that and planned
accordingly.''
   ``Lonesome Dove'' and the competition it attracted kept the
networks' aggregate rating in February from looking like yet another
example of audience erosion. This sweep was about four rating points
lower than last year's, but last February there were 16 nights of
Winter Olympics.
   CBS got a big push, both in ratings and morale, from ``Lonesome
Dove,'' the highest-rated network miniseries in more than four
years. But the Western miniseries' success pleased ABC and NBC, too.
   ``I think `Lonesome Dove' was beneficial to everybody,'' Wurtzel
said. ``Network television needs to have exciting, well-made
programming.''
   ABC and CBS are looking ahead to a spring when they and their
viewers can expect to reap one benefit from the effects of last
summer's strike _ fewer reruns.
   Then the networks can begin to worry anew. The Screen Actors
Guild contract is up at the end of June and there is talk of a
possible strike.

<HEAD>Government To Ethiopians: Prepare For War</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam's
government made its first public response to recent rebel victories
by telling citizens Thursday to prepare for all-out war against the
insurgents.
   ``No nation can tolerate violence and there is no alternative now
except to join hands and defuse the aggression launched against the
Ethiopian people,'' the Council of State said in a statement carried
by the official Ethiopian News Agency.
   It said people should ``be ready for an active involvement in
every area of the armed struggle,'' the official news agency
reported.
   The council is the executive committee of the Shengo, or
parliament. Its statement made no reference to claims by the rebel
Tigre People's Liberation Front that the army had evacuated the city
of Mekele ``fearing humiliating and shaking defeat ...''
   Diplomats in Addis Ababa said the soldiers left Mekele, capital
of Tigre province, on Monday without firing a shot. Mekele is about
475 miles northwest of Addis Ababa.
   Yemane Kidane, the Tigre rebel spokesman in Khartoum, Sudan, said
Tuesday ``the whole of Tigre now is liberated.'' He named the towns
taken by rebels in an offensive that began Dec. 28 as Adigrat,
Humera, Axum and Enda Sellasie, all north and northeast of Mekele.
   Thursday's council statement said: ``The seccessionist TPLF and
the Eritrean People's Liberation Front had coordinated attacks
against the Ethiopian army along the Adwa, Akswum and Enda Sellasie
route with the view to cut off the Ethiopian Red Sea area from the
rest of the country.''
   Rebels in Tigre province have fought the government for 14 years
and the Eritreans began fighting for independence nearly 30 years
ago.

<HEAD>West Germany Urges Talks on Reducing Short-Range Missiles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany carried its dispute with the United
States over short-range nuclear arms to an international forum on
Thursday, urging that East-West negotiations on reducing them begin
immediately.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany told the
40-nation Conference on Disarmament: ``We consider negotiations on
short-range nuclear systems, as agreed in the Western alliance at
Reykjavik in 1987, to be a top priority.''
   They should begin ``without delay,'' he said, and ``there are no
reasonable grounds for not initiating such negotiations.''
   The United States wants to modernize the existing NATO stockpile
of short-range nuclear arms and has opposed early negotiations,
which several other European allies join the West Germans in
supporting.
   Genscher cited the Soviet Union's ``great superiority'' in
short-range systems, which have a maximum range of 300 miles, and
said the Kremlin should offer to make unilateral cuts.
   ``We are open as far as the framework and the participants are
concerned,'' he told a news conference later. ``Our goal is simply
to open negotiations.''
   ``Short-range missiles are certainly not the central means of
European security. What concerns us is a political concept that
embodies all aspects of the East-West relationship'' so the West can
respond positively to changes occurring in Eastern Europe, he said.
   He welcomed the Soviet Union's ``readiness for negotiations'' and
declared to the conference: ``What we need are not firebreaks
against new disarmament negotiations, but firebreaks to prevent an
unbridled arms race.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said after touring NATO
capitals last month the answer might be to couple modernization with
negotiations and he expected the disagreement to be resolved before
the alliance summit in May.

<TEXT>
   Investigators have cracked a major spy
ring in which West German ``hackers'' allegedly acquired sensitive
military computer passwords and codes and sold them to the Soviets,
an official said Thursday.
   A West German television network said the passwords and other
information came from key military and research computers in the
United States, Western Europe and Japan.
   Three West Germans have been detained on suspicion of ``obtaining
information about access to databanks, and to have passed that on to
Soviet intelligence agents,'' said Roland Bachmeier, spokesman for
the federal Interior Ministry.
   He refused to confirm other details of a report by the
Norddeutsche Rundfunk broadcasting network.
   The Pentagon issued a one-sentence statement Thursday saying:
``Until possibly affected components of the Department of Defense
have had a chance to analyze the report, we have no reaction.''
   William Caldwell, a Pentagon spokesman, said the department would
have no further comment before Friday at the earliest.
   One security source in West Germany, speaking in an interview
with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said the
``hackers'' tried to break into a large U.S. military computer
network in West Germany but failed to gain access to secret material.
   Police in Hanover arrested two computer hackers on ``suspicion of
espionage activities for an Eastern European intelligence agency,''
said Alexander Prechtel, spokesman for the Federal Prosecutor's
Office in Karlsruhe. Another suspect was arrested in West Berlin, he
said.
   ``They are suspected of breaking into foreign computer systems''
and selling information to communist agents, Prechtel said.
   He said investigators still are trying to determine how much
damage the suspected espionage had caused to Western security
interests.
   Norddeutsche Rundfunk reported the hackers gained access to a key
U.S. Defense Department computer and to important research computers
elsewhere.
   They obtained sensitive information that would allow the Soviets
to gain access to the computers, the network said.
   Among the computers was the U.S. Defense Department's general
databank known as Optimus, a NASA computer, as well as computers
tied to nuclear weapons and energy research in New Mexico and
Illinois, the network said.
   Those facilities are the Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los
Alamos, N.M., and the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory near
Chicago.
   The information also would give the Kremlin access to U.S.
military supply depot statistics and to computers belonging to
several European institutes that deal with atomic and aerospace
research, the network statement said.
   ``Thousands of computer codes, passwords and programs were
delivered to the Soviets,'' the network said. ``They opened the door
for the KGB to gain access to some of the most important computer
centers of the Western world.''
   Norddeutsche Rundfunk said three suspects had been detained
following searches of at least six apartments in West Berlin and
Hanover. The network also said investigators had seized ``extensive
evidence'' in the searches.
   According to the network, authorities believe three West Germans
were recruited by the Soviet KGB in 1985 and ``were paid with cash
and drugs ... and were later forced to provide the codes and
passwords to the Soviets.''
   The network also said the three handed over ``highly sensitive
information from the United States, Japan, Great Britain, France,
Italy, Switzerland and West Germany'' at a 1985 meeting with two KGB
agents in East Berlin.
   Bachmeier said the arrests followed an investigation by the
federal Constitution Protection Office _ the country's main
counterespionage bureau _ as well as criminal investigators and the
Federal Prosecutor's Office.

   A former postal worker was convicted Thursday
of holding his former girlfriend hostage and shooting at his
co-workers during a 13-hour siege at a post office in December.
   The federal jury found Warren Murphy, 39, guilty of one count of
kidnapping and three counts of assault with intent to kill fellow
post office employees and FBI agents who tried to end the standoff.
Four people were injured during the incident.
   U.S. District Judge Veronica Wicker said sentencing would be
scheduled later. The kidnapping charge carries a maximum sentence of
life in prison, with a maximum of 20 years on each of the three
assault charges.
   One postal worker lost an eye from a shotgun blast during
Murphy's Dec. 14 rampage at the downtown New Orleans post office.
Two other postal workers were hit by the same blast of birdshot.
   An FBI agent was hit by a round fired through a door during the
standoff that followed after Murphy barricaded himself inside the
building. Another round was fired under a door at another agent, but
it was not clear whether he was hit.
   In a tape played to jurors, Murphy said he sawed off the shotgun
and stuck it down a leg of his pants to get it into the building. He
wore a work apron over his pants to further conceal the gun.
   The siege ended when New Orleans Police Superintendent Warren
Woodfork talked Murphy into giving up.
   Woodfork and federal authorities said Murphy was upset over
problems at work and his relationship with his girlfriend. He also
was concerned about the welfare of his children in the custody of
his estranged wife, the police chief said.

<UNK>Accused Man Goes To Paraguay</UNK>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Philadelphia man who was ordered deported
following claims that he killed Jews during World War II has fled to
Paraguay, the Justice Department said Thursday.
   George Theodorovich, 66, withdrew his appeal of a deportation
order with immigration authorities after obtaining a visa to travel
to Paraguay, the department said.
   The retired meat cutter, who went to Paraguay two months ago, was
ordered deported in 1987 by an immigration judge after the Justice
Department produced reports that he had written to account for
bullets he used to shoot Jews.
   The Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations charged
that Theodorovich, a member of the Ukrainian police during Nazi
occupation in the city of Lvov, had concealed his activities when he
entered this country after the war.
   The immigration judge had found that Theodorovich ``did assist
and otherwise participate in the persecution of Jews in Lvov during
1942-1944.''
   ``He was a Ukrainian policeman for two years when Lvov went from
a city of 160,000 Jews to a mere handful,'' U.S. Immigration Judge
John F. Gossart Jr. said in his order.
   Theodorovich was ordered deported to Argentina but the case was
before the Board of Immigration Appeals when Theodorovich fled to
Paraguay on Dec. 18, 1988.
   The Justice Department was not notified that Theodorovich had
fled the country until this week when it received papers filed by
his attorney with the immigration appeals board.
   ``The evidence in this case, particularly the important documents
keeping track of the bullets expended by Theodorovich in killing
Jews, showed his direct role in the destruction of one of the
largest Jewish communities in Europe,'' Neal Sher, the Justice
Department's chief Nazi hunter, said in a statement.
   Theodorovich is the second former member of the Ukrainian police
to flee from this country to Paraguay following Justice Department
efforts to obtain deportation, according to department records.
   Sergei Kowalchuk fled to Paraguay in 1987 after the Justice
Department initiated deportation proceedings, alleging he served
with the Ukrainian police in Poland during Nazi occupation.

<HEAD>Retirees Miffed Over Immigrant Shelter Next Door</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN BENITO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retirees who spend their winters at a
trailer park here are angry over a plan to convert a nearby
warehouse into a detention center for hundreds of Central Americans
trying to enter the United States.
   The Justice Department's Community Relations Service is turning a
metal building next to the Snowbird Court trailer park into a
shelter because space is running out at a center 20 miles away in
the border city of Brownsville, said American Red Cross spokeswoman
Patty Garner.
   The Red Cross, under a contract with the government, is caring
for the immigrants. But the residents of the Snowbird Court RV park,
primarily retirees from Canada and the Midwest, do not welcome the
prospect of the new shelter.
   ``You save all summer to come down here and relax and have a good
time, and they pull this kind of number on you,'' said Hilda Lee, a
Snowbird resident from East Dubuque, Ill. ``We're being robbed of
our vacation.''
   She and other park residents said they were worried the often
destitute Central Americans might bring an increase in thefts to the
area.
   ``You know as well as I know if people are hungry they may go
ahead and take something that's not theirs,'' said Tom Wright of
Ontario, Canada.
   The Red Cross shelter in Brownsville is nearing its capacity of
800 people, Ms. Garner said.
   ``If we reach capacity here (in Brownsville), we will be able to
begin housing people there (in San Benito) also,'' Ms. Garner said.
Officials are not sure how soon they can open the new facility.
   The San Benito building, a 31,000-square-foot structure
resembling a large airplane hangar, will be equipped to house up to
600 people, she said.
   Increased Border Patrol activity and new Immigration and
Naturalization Service policies have put the INS in a bind for space
recently.
   The INS on Feb. 21 started holding applicants seeking political
asylum whose cases were denied in a new one-day adjudication
procedure. It also has stopped releasing those apprehended by the
Border Patrol on their own recognizance.
   The Brownsville shelter and the new one being prepared at San
Benito are for family groups who must report for daily roll calls
but are not locked up.
   Pat Thompson, owner of Snowbird Court, said she fears the new
neighbors will scare her business away.
   ``This (Lower Rio Grande) Valley's crawling with (mobile home)
parks,'' Ms. Thompson said. ``They don't have to stay here.''
   Others are concerned about sanitation problems that prompted the
city of Harlingen to evict the INS from a building last month.
   Jeffrey Weiss, associate director for immigration and refugee
affairs with the Justice Department, said the government will have
to satisfy county health authorities before moving into the San
Benito building.

   A man attacked by a swarm of bees while
fishing in Panama drowned when, his eyes swollen shut by bee stings,
he could not find his life jacket and jumped into a lake to escape
the insects, his father said.
   Gary E. Hauser, 42, was fishing with two friends in Gatun Lake in
Panama, on Sunday when the swarm descended on them, according to his
father, Donald Hauser. Panama has been overrun by so-called ``killer
bees'' for several years.
   The three men jumped into the water and hung on to the boat, but
the bees still swarmed over them. They got back into the boat to try
to flee but couldn't get the motor started, Hauser said.
   The men then went back into the water. Two swam to shore, but
Hauser drowned, his father said.
   One of the men was in critical condition in a Panama hospital,
the elder Hauser said, and the second survivor was in shock.
   Gary Hauser, formerly of North St. Paul, headed the athletic and

<HEAD>Former Stroessner Aide Denies Corruption Charge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former private secretary of ousted
President Alfredo Stroessner declared himself innocent on Thursday
of corruption charges.
   Mario Abdo Benitez appeared in court to face accusations he
committed ``offenses against public administration'' including
embezzlement, bribery and fraud.
   Prosecuting Attorney Pedro Abilio Rolon said that on a salary
reported by the Treasury Ministry to be $665 a month, Abdo Benitez
reportedly owns 15 pieces of property, luxurious homes and a
twin-engine airplane.
   ``That's totally untrue. He only has savings accounts in
different banks amounting to some $10,000,'' said Abdo Benitez's
lawyer, Oscar Cuevas.
   In his lawsuit, Rolon accused Abdo Benitez of using his position
to extort money and favors in the name of Stroessner.
   Cuevas called the allegations ``totally false'' and said his
client ``didn't use his influence to receive gifts, money or other
things.''
   Abdo Benitez proclaimed his innocence to reporters and vowed to
prove it ``with documents I have at hand.''
   A lawsuit filed by Rolon was combined with one filed by the
attorney general against former Stroessner Cabinet ministers.
   The accused former ministers are Jose Eugenio Jacquet, labor and
justice; Adan Godoy Jimenez, health; Carlos Ortiz Ramirez,
education; Delfin Ugarte Centurion, commerce, and Sabino Augusto
Montanaro, interior.
   Except for Montanaro, who has taken shelter at the Honduran
Embassy, the former ministers are in custody at the Central Police
Station. Court hearings for them are due to start next week.
   Abdo Benitez became Stroessner's private secretary in 1963 and
continued in that post through last Feb. 3, the day Stroessner was
toppled in a coup by Gen. Andres Rodriguez, now Paraguay's
provisional president.
   Elections are set for May 1. Rodriguez is the presidential
candidate of the governing Colorado Party.

   Israeli forces in south Lebanon killed four
guerrillas Thursday before they could raid northern Israel, the army
said, and a soldier in the Gaza Strip killed a Palestinian who tried
to stab a fellow trooper.
   A fifth member of the Palestinian guerrilla band escaped and
soldiers were searching for him in an area about three miles north
of the border, a military source said on condition of anonymity.
   An army spokesman said the guerrillas belonged to the radical PLO
faction Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and were
caught near Al Jibbayn village in Israel's self-proclaimed
``security zone.'' Lebanese police said the encounter occurred
outside the zone.
   Israel established the buffer, which ranges from six to 10 miles
deep north of the border, in June 1985 after withdrawing most of its
troops to end a three-year invasion and occupation of Lebanon. The
zone is patrolled by Israeli soldiers and a surrogate Lebanese
militia.
   ``From documents and papers, it was established that the
terrorists (intended) to carry out an attack in one of the
settlements in the north'' of Israel, the army said in a statement.
   Democratic Front statements issued in Lebanon and Syria claimed
its men attacked Israeli troops in retaliation for an Israeli air
raid Tuesday on one of its bases in the Chouf Mountains southeast of
Beirut.
   It pledged increased attacks on Israel despite PLO chief Yasser
Arafat's renunciation of terrorism, which the statement said did not
apply to the Front.
   Lebanese police said the four guerrillas were killed in a battle
with Israeli soldiers and their South Lebanon Army militia allies
near Majdel Zoun village, 14 miles southeast of Tyre and just north
of the security zone.
   This was the second infiltration attempt in a week Israel has
blamed on the Democratic Front. The army reported Feb. 23 that
soldiers had killed three of the organization's guerrillas in the
security zone.
   Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled, chief of the army's Northern Command, told
Israel radio leaflets found on the men killed Thursday referred to
``carrying out a hostage-taking mission in Israel.''
   Foreign Ministry officials gave reporters copies of Democratic
Front identification cards they said belonged to two of the three
guerrillas killed Feb. 23 and also provided a copy of an
Arabic-language leaflet one of the men allegedly carried.
   Anti-Israeli statements were in the leaflet, but no clues to the
group's mission.
   Marwan Hussein Khawaz, 24, was the Palestinian shot and killed
Thursday in the Gaza Strip. The army said he tried to stab a soldier
during house searches overnight.
   At least 388 Palestinians have been killed in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip since an uprising began nearly 15 months ago.
Seventeen Israelis also have been slain.
   Arab reports said six Palestinians were wounded in Gaza and the
West Bank during stone-throwing confrontations with soldiers.
Hospital officials in Gaza City said a seventh Palestinian,
50-year-old Fatima Kdaih of the Jabaliya refugee camp, lost her
right eye when she was hit by a rubber bullet.
   Soldiers kept a curfew on Nablus, the West Bank's largest city,
for the seventh conecutive day, confining nearly all its 120,000
residents to their homes. The curfew was imposed last Friday after a
soldier was killed by a concrete block dropped from a third-story
window.
   In the West Bank, the army destroyed five houses and sealed
another that belonged to members of an Arab group accused of killing
a Palestinian who cooperated with Israeli authorities, the military
spokesman said.
   The army said two other houses were destroyed that belonged to a
second Palestinian group suspected of throwing firebombs at Israeli
military patrols and the houses of Palestinian collaborators.
   Israel's desire to end U.S. talks with the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which it considers a terrorist organization, is likely
to be reinforced by the latest infiltration attempt.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said in a television interview
Thursday that he would try to convince the United States to end its
talks with the PLO when he visits New York and Washington next week.
   The United States opened the dialogue in Tunis, where the PLO has
its headquarters, after Arafat publicly renounced terrorism in
December and recognized Israel's right to exist.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Wednesday the
United States had told the PLO ``attacks against Israeli civilian
and military targets inside or outside Israel are contrary to the
objectives of the dialogue.''

   Egyptian author Naguib Mahfouz on Thursday
urged Moslem countries to condemn Iran's call for the assassination
of Salman Rushdie but proposed a boycott against publishers of
Rushdie's book ``The Satanic Verses.'' Mahfouz, who last year became
the first Arab to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, summed up his
views on the controversial book in an article in the state-owned
newspaper Al-Ahram.
   Mahfouz said he wrote the article because some of his remarks to
foreign reporters had been misinterpreted. He said he still has not
read Rushdie's book and only recently learned of its contents from
others.
   Iran's leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, sparked a global
uproar last month by offering a reward for the death of Rushdie, 41,
an Indian-born British author, on grounds his book blasphemes Islam.
   Interviewed by The Associated Press on Feb. 18, a few days after
Khomeini's statement, Mahfouz said he considered the Iranian cleric
guilty of terrorism and that his action had damaged the image of
Islam.
   In Thursday's newspaper article, the 77-year-old author said: ``I
believe Khomeini inflicted harm on Islam and Moslems that is not
less, if not more, than what the author of the book intended.
   ``I also have said previously that freedom of opinion should be
sacred and that thought can be rectified only with thought,'' he
said. ``Islam's mission is not terrorism and incitement to murder.''
   Nevertheless, he said he is proposing a three-point plan: the
book's publisher's should be boycotted; Moslem nations should reject
Khomeini's call to violence; and all nations ``should be called upon
to respect religions and sacred beliefs of peoples without prejudice
to the freedom of research based on scientific standards and subject
to discussion.''
   ``I see now that if Rushdie bolted with his imagination, the
Moslems misbehaved by staging demonstrations, burning the book and
calling for murder, thus turning the situation upside down and
making the culprit a victim,'' he said.
   Mahfouz said that if reported accounts of the book's contents
were true, ``then the book is not worthy of discussion and its
authorship, like any action overstepping the bounds of law and
ethics, should be fought in the courts or through deterrent measures
at the international level.''
   Moslems have complained that ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes
their religion by portraying the prophet Mohammed's wives as
prostitutes and suggesting that he wrote the Koran, Islam's holy
book, rather than receiving it from God through the angel Gabriel.
   Rushdie contends his book is fictional and not blasphemous. He
has apologized for the distress it caused to Moslems but not for its
substance.

   The Senate voted 94-0 confirmation Thursday
night of Edward J. Derwinski as the first secretary of veterans
affairs, despite a statement by one key senator that ``significant
ethical questions'' were raised by Derwinski's 1977 tip to South
Korea that one of its agents was about to defect.
   ``Mr. Derwinski made significant mistakes in 1977 in making the
disclosure and since then on a number of occasions in dissembling as
to what he had done,'' said Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., chairman
of the Veterans Affairs Committee.
   ``I find that these actions and statements raise significant
ethical questions,'' Cranston said at a committee session on the
nomination a few hours before the floor vote. The dissembling, he
told reporters later, continued ``into 1989.''
   Despite Cranston's comments, the panel voted 10-0 to recommend
confirmation by the full Senate. Hours later, the Senate went along.
   In the final tally, those not voting were Sens. David Boren,
D-Okla.; David Durenberger, R-Minn.; Al Gore, Jr., D-Tenn.; Bob
Packwood, R-Ore.; Paul Simon, D-Ill.; and Timothy Wirth, D-Colo.,
   Derwinski in 1977 was the senior Republican on a House committee
investigating bribery of members of Congress by the Korean
government.
   He told the Veterans Affairs Committee on Wednesday he
inadvertently mentioned in a conversation with a Korean diplomat on
or near the steps of a House office building that a Korean official
was going to testify before the committee.
   Derwinski, 62, denied being the source of the tip until
confirmation hearings for a State Department post in 1983 after 12
terms in the House as an Illinois Republican. The hearings and his
admission attracted practically no public attention at the time.
   Cranston said he was unable to lay out the reasons for his
conclusions because they were based on secret information, in some
cases information the White House declined to release to Derwinski
but did allow senators to inspect.
   When weighed against Derwinski's 30 years of service in Congress
and the State Department, ``I do not find his indiscretions as to
this one incident to be disqualifying,'' Cranston said. ``I am
optimistic about Mr. Derwinski's potential to rise above this
unattractive episode, to put it behind him once and for all.''
   Derwinski himself did not attend the session and in a statement
read by aide Don Smith ignored Cranston's criticisms: ``I appreciate
the unanimous endorsement of the committee and will now focus my
efforts to work for America's veterans.''
   Senators of both parties praised Cranston for thoroughness and
fairness. The senior Republican, Frank Murkowski of Alaska, said he
found that Derwinski had answered all questions ``adequately to the
issue'' even though hampered by lack of access to secret information.
   Asked if he agreed with Cranston's comments, Murkowski said, ``I
stand on my statement.''
   Cranston scheduled a Monday committee appearance on the budget by
Derwinski as expected head of the Veterans Administration _ a job he
will hold only until March 15, when the VA becomes a Cabinet
department and Derwinski its secretary.
   Some accounts of the 1977 Korean incident have said Derwinski
passed the information to the Koreans in a telephone call. However,
on Wednesday he said the open-air conversation was the only such
discussion, which he called ``inadvertent,'' ``without giving the
matter any serious thought'' and ``stupid.''
   ``We do not know for an absolute fact one way or another''
whether there was also a telephone call, Cranston said after the
vote.
   Refusing to say what he was talking about, Cranston said, ``There
was a statement made by a very responsible person five years after
events where that person's memory was faulty. That led us to believe
that perhaps something had happened that apparently did not happen.
When that was cleared up I took the position I stated.''
   Cranston said the Bush administration made available to the
committee everything it wanted, but Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
declined to petition the courts for the records of a grand jury that
investigated the leak to the Koreans. Counsel to the Senate said a
suit or petition by senators for access to those records would fail.
   Derwinski declined to answer questions of the grand jury. The
House ethics committee looked into the matter but declined to pursue
it on the grounds it might jeopardize intelligence sources and
methods.
   Asked if the grand jury records might have made a difference to
the vote, Cranston said, ``It depends on what's in it _ I really
can't say.''

<HEAD>Malaysian Rulers Elect New King</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rulers of nine Malaysian states
chose a new leader on Thursday in what government officials say is
the world's only election for king.
   The nine state rulers went one-by-one behind a screen and marked
a ``yes'' or ``no'' on a ballot with the name of the deputy king,
Sultan Azlan Shah, 60, ruler of Perak state.
   Sultan Azlan was chosen but a breakdown of the votes was not
given.
   The present king, Sultan Mahmood Iskandar, 57, will return to his
duties as ruler of Johore state when his five-year term ends in
April.
   Royalty remained popular in Malaysia after the country gained
independence from Britain in 1957. Political power, however, is
vested in an elected parliament, both at the national and state
levels.
   The state rulers are all Malays and are the heads of the Islamic
religion in their states.
   Islam is the official religion in this nation of 16 million,
where 55 percent are Malays, 37 percent Chinese and most of the rest
Indians.
   The rulers on Thursday also elected Sultan Tuanku Jaafar Abdul
Rahman, 67, ruler of Negri Sembilan state, as the new deputy king, a
statement from the Prime Minister's Department said.
   The new terms start April 26.
   Elections for king take place every five years, or if a king
dies. The usual pattern in Malaysia has been to elect the deputy
king as king. In at least three previous elections, however, the
senior ruler has declined to run and his name was not on the ballot.
   In practice, the post of king has rotated among the nine states.
   The king also can be removed by the nine rulers at a special
meeting if they feel the king cannot perform his duties.
   The king's monthly salary is about $23,443.
   Sultan Azlan graduated with a law degree from Britain's
Nottingham University in 1954 and became the country's
highest-ranking judge, lord president of the Supreme Court, in
November 1982.
   He became Sultan of Perak in February 1984 when Sultan Idris Shah
died.
   News reports have said he had some differences with Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad, especially when his successor as Supreme
Court chief, Salleh Abas, was fired last year. But government
officials said the two have reconciled.
   The new deputy king is the son of Malaysia's first national king,
Tuanku Abdul Rahman. He also graduated in law from Nottingham
University in 1953.
   Nine of Malaysia's 13 states have constitutional monarchs. The
other four have governors, normally political appointees. In seven
states, the eldest son succeeds to the throne, while in the other
two, the monarchy is decided by election or rotated among royal
families. Women cannot become monarchs.

<HEAD>Europe Wants United States To Amend Computer Reservations System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European aviation officials on Thursday
accused the United States of using a computerized airline
reservation system that discriminates against European airlines.
   The officials said the system favors U.S. carriers even though
European airlines fly the same routes to Europe in less time.
   ``Consumers suffer from not always being given ready access to
the best (flight) information,'' by the U.S. systems, Edward Hudson,
secretary of the 22-nation European Civil Aviation Conference, told
reporters.
   He said he will raise the issue this month in a meeting with U.S.
Department of Transportation officials.
   ``There has been a marked reluctance from the U.S. government to
open its ears to what has been said by the Europeans,'' Hudson
complained.
   He said reservations made through U.S. computerized reservation
systems often involve ``unnecessarily lengthy journey times with
long overlays at connecting points'' because the computers favor
U.S. carriers.
   He said they list U.S. carriers on the first screen while flights
of European carriers are tucked away on remote screens that booking
agents do not switch to unless travelers specify what hour they want
to leave.
   ``It is a well-known fact that the great majority of bookings are
made from the first screen,'' Hudson said.
   The five U.S. systems are known as APOLLO, SABRE, PARS, DATAS-2
and SYSEM-1. Hudson said none give priority to flights to Europe
where warranted.
   As an example, he cited a direct, non-stop San Francisco-to-Paris
flight on France's UTA airline that is up to 5{ hours faster than
flights on major U.S. carriers which make stopovers.
   Yet SABRE puts the UTA flight on screen No. 9 rather than on the
first screen.
   Flights of Air France, British Airways, Lufthansa, Alitalia and
SAS get similar treatment though they get travelers from California
to Europe hours faster than U.S. carriers, he said.
   Hudson said the U.S. systems also list ``a service involving a
change of aircraft or change of carrier ... as a direct flight'' or
list connecting flights on U.S. carriers to Europe ``ahead of faster
and more direct'' services by European carriers.
   He called that ``misleading'' passengers.
   ``International services deserve better treatment'' in the United
States, the conference's deputy secretary, Kevin Kealy, said.
   Hudson said the 22 conference nations will issue next week the
organization's rules of conduct for West Europe's two main computer
reservation systems, known as Amadeus and Galileo. These rules, he
said, give non-European carriers first-screen priority if their
flights are more convenient.
   He asked the U.S. government to do likewise. ``The rules of the
game should be set at the government level,'' Hudson added.

<TEXT>
   A man divorcing his wife has gone to
court to keep her from becoming pregnant with fertilized eggs they
had placed in frozen storage.
   Junior Lewis Davis, 30, said in a divorce complaint last week
that he does not want his wife, Mary Sue Davis, 28, to have the
embryos he fertilized implanted in her.
   The embryos are ``property jointly owned by the parties'' Davis
said, adding that Mrs. Davis ``has no legal right to make any
disposition (of them) without (his) express consent.''
   Blount Circuit Judge W. Dale Young signed an order last Thursday
temporarily keeping Mrs. Davis from having any of her in vitro
fertilized eggs implanted.He also barred her from removing them from
frozen storage, pending further hearings on the matter.
   In the complaint, Davis said he and his wife, both of Maryville
about 20 miles south of Knoxville, participated in an in vitro
fertilization program at a Knoxville hospital during the past
several years.
   He said his wife's eggs were fertilized outside the womb in a
laboratory with his sperm and then frozen so that she could have
them implanted inside her and possibly become pregnant at a later
time.
   Despite Davis' divorce petition and his objection to becoming a
father, Mrs. Davis said she eventually plans to have the eggs
implanted, according to the complaint.
   Davis said he had no comment on Thursday. Mary Sue Davis did not
return a telephone call made to the Knoxville company where she
works.
   Charles M. Clifford, Davis' attorney, said he would not comment
on the case.
   In vitro fertilization involves removing the woman's eggs and
fertilizing them with sperm outside the womb and then replacing them
inside the woman's body.
   The practice was pioneered in Great Britain, where in 1978 the
world's first so-called test-tube baby was born using the method.
   Since then, other infertile couples have used to the method,
which costs between $4,000 and $10,000 and has an approximately 15
percent success rate for each implant.

   A 97-year-old woman, imploring Congress for a
boost in aid for the elderly and infirm, cut short lawmakers'
questions Thursday by shouting from her wheelchair, ``I'm asking
you, are you going to increase my payments?''
   Blanche Brown-Bey of Indianapolis told a House panel that she
lives on $13 a day while ``everything is going up. ... Everything is
so high, it almost takes my breath.''
   Her testimony, sometimes whispered and other times feisty and
loud, came at a hearing by two congressional panels on the
Supplemental Security Income program, a government ``safety net''
for the aged, the blind and disabled children.
   She was joined on a panel that included the director of the SSI
program and several social workers before a joint hearing of the
House Select Committee on Aging and the Ways and Means human
resources subcommittee. SSI is operated within the Social Security
Administration.
   Rep. Edward Roybal, D-Calif., chairman of the Aging Committee,
said SSI's top beneficiaries live on just $368 a month, which is
about 75 percent of the government's poverty level.
   The program, he said, ``is in fact characterized by inadequate
benefit levels, large gaps in service, insufficient outreach
activities and overly rigid requirements.''
   He cited testimony from witnesses who said many elderly people
were getting far less than the maximum payment and families with
severely disabled children were being routinely rejected because of
rigid standards.
   Michael Carozza, deputy commissioner of the Social Security
Administration, defended the ``successful, effective program. ...
SSI is an effective safety net, providing the aged, blind, and
disabled with a floor of income, the value of which is enhanced when
combined with Medicaid, food stamps and other assistance.''
   The poorest SSI recipients have income between 75 percent and 90
percent of the poverty level, he said.
   ``I believe this is appropriate when you consider that SSI tends
to be an income of last resort,'' he added.
   But Mrs. Brown-Bey, her frail frame sunk deep in her wheelchair
in the middle of the cavernous committee room, detailed in a
near-whisper how SSI benefits leave her barely able to cover her
monthly expenses.
   ``I pays $2.10 for my gas and pays $50 for my electricity,'' she
said, holding a magnifying glass to a handwritten paper.
   ``I have life insurance. My life insurance is 35 cents a week.
And my house insurance is $2.86. I pay that in November.''
   Frustrated finally by trying to read the paper, she dropped her
clipboard to the table and said, ``I'm telling you my experience.
... But I can't remember everything.''
   ``I'm telling you the truth so's you can know about me,'' she
continued.
   She paused before quietly concluding her testimony: ``I have my
plot paid for in Crown Hill. That's all.''
   Roybal, who has introduced one of three bills now in the House to
strengthen the SSI program, tried to assure her that he and others
on the two committees want to boost the benefits. But Mrs. Brown-Bey
cut him off.
   ``Are you going to increase it? That's what I'm asking you.''
   ``If it were up to me ...'' Roybal tried to assure her.
   ``I'm asking you, are you going to increase my payments,'' she
interrupted.
   SSI provides benefits to about 4.5 million elderly, blind and
disabled adults and blind and disabled children. Carozzi said the
average monthly SSI payments to recipients was about $188 as of last
December.
   One of the three bills the House is considering would raise the
SSI benefit level to the poverty level over three years and loosen
some eligibility standards. Another bill would change the way SSI
considers elibility for disabled children, and the third would
change the way such income as unemployment compensation is
considered under the program.

<HEAD>Smith Pleads Guilty, Sentencing Delayed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man accused of bilking 700 people and three
banks out of $125 million by falsely claiming they were investing in
oil and gas drilling projects pleaded guilty Thursday to 98 counts
of fraud and state securities violations.
   During a half-hour hearing, Stephen L. Smith, owner of the
defunct SH Oil and Gas Exploration, switched his plea to guilty and
Polk Circuit Judge J. Tim Strickland ordered a pre-sentence
investigation. No sentencing date was set.
   Smith, 38, remains free on $225,000 bond. He had no comment after
the hearing, but his attorney, Richard D. Mars, said: ``It was a
fair disposition of the case.''
   State sentencing guidelines call for a sentence of 12 to 17 years
in prison for the charges to which Smith pleaded guilty: two counts
of organized fraud, 48 counts of unregistered securities sales and
48 counts of securities sales by an unregistered dealer.
   Each of the 98 charges carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in
prison and a fine of $10,000.
   At sentencing, prosecutors are expected to seek dismissal of the
remainder of 262 state criminal charges brought last year, which
include racketeering, grand theft and other securities violations,
Mars said. He could have faced up to 99 years in prison.
   Investigators claimed that Smith, over a nine-year period, used
money from new investors in SH Oil and Gas to pay dividends to
previous investors. They said Smith never owned any significant
interest in oil wells and had no legitimate business to operate.
   Investors included many prominent people in Winter Haven, such as
a former mayor, top businessmen, bankers, attorneys and doctors as
well as retirees.
   Smith's attorneys said they expect federal prosecutors to charge
Smith with grand theft and fraud in connection with about $2 million
owed Barnett Bank, which has offices across the state.
   More than 170 investors have sued Barnett Bank, claiming it
failed to scrutinize Smith before advising that his company was a
sound investment. No trial dates have been set.
   On Monday, Polk Circuit Judge Dennis P. Maloney ruled in a civil
case filed by the state against Smith that SH Oil and Gas was a
fraud. The action, which Smith's lawyers had sought to block because
of the criminal charges pending, was intended to pave the way for
the controller to seek a court order to distribute assets that are
in receivership.
   Authorities closed down Smith's 9-year-old business Dec. 30,
1987, and asked for appointment of a receiver to manage the assets
of the company and Smith. Attorney William H. McBride, the acting
receiver, said he has so far located about $5.5 million in assets
from the defunct company.
   ``This case will not be concluded until we have recovered every
possible penny for the victims,'' said state Comptroller Gerald
Lewis.

<TEXT>
   Retired Navy Capt. Charles Gillespie Jr., who
was shot down over Vietnam and spent 5{ years in the ``Hanoi
Hilton'' POW prison, was identified Thursday as the pilot killed in
a civilian plane crash, officials said.
   Gillespie, 60, was flying a turboprop plane for Flight
International Inc., a defense contractor, at the time of Tuesday's
accident. He had retired from active duty in June 1983.
   The crash occurred minutes after Gillespie finished maneuvers
intended to simulate hostile aircraft during war games involving
Navy air traffic control students tracking planes from ships, Navy
officials said.
   ``He was doing what he loved,'' his wife, Helen, said from the
couple's San Marcos home, 35 miles north of San Diego. ``I used to
tease him about always having to flag him out of a plane, get him to
land, just so I could see him. He was always flying.''
   Wreckage and the pilot's remains were found just before dusk
Tuesday, seven hours after the plane plunged into the ocean 80 miles
northwest of San Diego.
   ``We really know very little. It went into a dive and just never
came out,'' Gordon James, a Flight International executive vice
president, said from the company's headquarters in Newport News, Va.
   A native of Meridian, Miss., Gillespie won his wings a year after
graduating from the Naval Academy in 1951. He was a pilot assigned
to the aircraft carrier USS Coral Sea when his F-4 Phantom jet was
shot down over North Vietnam on Oct. 24, 1967. He bailed out and was
captured.
   Gillespie endured 5{ years in the North Vietnamese prison before
being released March 17, 1973. In the years after, he sometimes
talked about the harsh prison existence in appearances before church
and civic groups and about how his religious faith sustained him.
   During his military career, Gillespie won a Silver Star, the
Legion of Merit and two Purple Hearts.
   In addition to his wife, Gillespie is survived by a daughter and
son.

   A major winter storm brought strong winds, heavy rain and snow
Thursday to parts of the Pacific Coast, with heavy snow forecast for
much of the western states through Friday.
   Heavy snow in the Seattle area shut down the Seattle-Tacoma
airport for about 15 hours, but it reopened by mid-morning Thursday.
Snowfall ranged from 8 inches to 16 inches in the Auburn area, just
south of Seattle.
   Heavy rainfall fell on parts of Northern California, with more
than 3{ inches recorded at Ross, just north of San Francisco, and
more than 2{ inches at Redding.
   More than a foot of snow fell in the Sierra Nevada, where winds
gusted to 50 to 70 mph, and the higher elevations of extreme western
Nevada.
   Heavy snow also fell on portions of the northern Rockies, where
about 12 inches fell overnight in the ski areas near Jackson Hole,
Wyo.
   Winter storm warnings were in effect for southern and eastern
Oregon, central Idaho, northwest Wyoming, much of the Sierra Nevada
in California and higher elevations of northern and central Nevada.
   Winter storm warnings for heavy snow were expected by Friday
across most of the mountains of Idaho and western Wyoming. Winter
storm watches were posted for south central Montana, northern and
central Wyoming and the mountains of Colorado.
   High wind warnings for wind gusts to over 60 miles an hour cover
all of Nevada.
   Frigid weather covered the northern Plains, where temperatures
were below zero Thursday in parts of Montana, North Dakota and
Minnesota, for wind chills ranging as low as 40 below zero.
   Freezing drizzle was mixed with snow over southern Nebraska.
   In western New York, snow continued to be locally heavy east of
Lake Ontario, with 22 inches of snowfall recorded at Barnes Corners,
N.Y., since snow began wednesday,
   Rain covered the South Atlantic and Gulf coastal states.
Thunderstorms over the Gulf of Mexico dumped marble-size hail near
Gulf Shores, Ala.
   Partly cloudy skies and dry weather prevailed from New England
and the mid-Atlantic states across the Ohio Valley to the southern
half of the Great Plains.
   Dense fog was reported this morning from western texas across
western kansas and eastern colorado to southeast wyoming.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 6
degrees below zero at Warroad, Minn., to 84 degrees at Fort Myers,
Fla.
   The national weather forecast for Friday predicted snow
widespread from the northern and central Plateau across the northern
and central Rockies, the northern half of the Great Plains, upper
Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes to much of New England. Snow
will be mixed with freezing rain for Iowa and eastern Nebraska. Rain
will occur over much of California, Arizona and northern New Mexico,
and from Kansas and Oklahoma to the middle Mississippi and Ohio
valleys. Rainshowers will be scattered across the Carolinas, with
thunder storms over Florida. Widely scattered thunderstorms will
occur over the lower Mississippi Valley.
   High temperatures will be in the teens and 20s from eastern
Washington state across Montana, the northern half of the Great

<HEAD>Authorities Warn Against Bogus U.S. Dollars Flooding Mexico</HEAD>

   A man arrested during a raid on a printing
plant may be responsible for the millions of dollars in counterfeit
U.S. currency now flooding Mexico, the attorney general's office
said Thursday.
   The Bank of Mexico told Mexicans on Wednesday not to buy U.S.
dollars from strangers and advised currency dealers to be on the
lookout for bogus bills.
   ``We're still investigating. But the evidence we have up to now
is that the whole thing appears to be connected to the Chihuahua
case,'' spokesman Fernando Arias of the attorney general's office
said in a telephone interview.
   Federal police seized about $11 million in bogus U.S. dollars in
northern Chihuahua state last week and arrested a foreigner who said
he sent counterfeit money to Colombia, home of the notorious
Medellin drug cartel, to buy cocaine for eventual export and sale.
   Law enforcement agents have been confiscating fake bills almost
weekly since December, authorities said Thursday.
   They said the latest case arose Tuesday in the Pacific coast
resort of Acapulco, where agents arrested a peasant named Jesus
Gomez Hernandez as he allegedly tried to change 20 fake $100 bills
for pesos at a foreign currency exchange house.
   Gomez said he bought the bills in Morelos state from a stranger,
the Guerrero state attorney general's office said.
   On Saturday, agents confiscated $5 million in bogus bills and
arrested at least four people in raids in Tijuana, across the border
from San Ysidro, Calif.
   Authorities suspect the source of the counterfeit may be a
foreigner arrested during a printing plant raid in Chihuahua. He and
eight Mexicans were arrested Saturday in Ciudad Juarez, across the
border from El Paso, Texas.
   Federal agents seized at least $11 million in fake $10, $20 and
$50 bills which Deputy Attorney General Javier Coello Trejo
described as ``almost perfect.''
   Coello told reporters the man passed about $100,000 worth of
phony bills to an El Paso bank. He also told authorities of his
counterfeit-for-cocaine efforts.
   Authorities say the man had documents in several names, including
Newton Peter von Gramm and Newton Peter von Shultz. They believe he
is either a U.S. citizen, a German or a Canadian.

   A radio station executive has been cleared of
making bomb threats to two airlines, a newspaper and a police
station, and the charge against him will be dropped, a prosecutor
said Thursday.
   Robert A. Costello, 54, was cleared after the FBI said it
suspected an inmate at the state prison in Concord of committing the
crime, said Suffolk County District Attorney Newman Flanagan.
   Witnesses said they heard Costello placing the calls, Flanagan
said. But the FBI's chief suspect is the inmate, who allegedly
billed the calls to the station, WCAP-AM, in Costello's name, he
said.
   The witnesses, whom authorities have not identified, were being
questioned Thursday, Flanagan said. He added that Costello deserved
no apology.
   ``He should be very grateful,'' he said. ``We're not embarrassed.
In fact, we feel very proud of the fact that we took steps (toward
his vindication).''
   Costello, a sales manager at WCAP, was arrested last Friday,
about 24 hours after the bomb threats were made to Continental
Airlines, American Airlines, the state police station at Logan
International Airport and the Boston Herald.
   The threats reportedly were in protest of Salman Rushdie's
controversial novel, ``The Satanic Verses.'' But Flanagan refused to
comment on whether the threats were related to the book.
   The charge against Costello would have been dropped Thursday but
his attorney, Joseph Tosney, was not available to appear in East
Boston District Court for the formal dismissal until Friday,
Flanagan said.
   Costello could not be reached for comment at his home, his office
or his attorney's office. ``My client's not making a statement
today,'' Tosney said.
   ``How does he express his gratitude for being handcuffed and
dragged from his place of work Friday evening?'' Tosney asked. ``How
does he express his gratitude at hearing an assistant district
attorney ask for $100,000 bail on Monday morning? How does he
express gratitude for being told the state police have an iron-clad
case against him?''
   The attorney said his client was distraught and didn't go to work
this week.
   Flanagan said Costello would be within his rights to sue for
wrongful prosecution.
   Costello, of Lowell, is a Marine veteran who serves in the
Massachusetts National Guard and is chairman of the Downtown Lowell
Business Association.

<TEXT>
   A B-52 bomber carried a cigar-shaped
missile across northern Canada on Thursday in the first test of a
U.S. cruise missile designed with stealth technology, officials said.
   Maj. Jan Martinsen of the Canadian Forces Cold Lake air base in
northeastern Alberta said the bomber crossed an imaginary target at
the nearby Primrose Lake evaluation range at 11:15 a.m. and then
returned Edwards Air Force Base in California.
   ``As far as we know everything proceeded smoothly,'' she said.
``The Americans will obviously be analyzing the data they've
collected from this test.''
   The test had initially been set for Wednesday, but was delayed
because of severe blizzard conditions in the Northwest Territories.
   The missile remained attached to the bomber in what is called a
captive-carry test. Such flights are used to check guidance systems.
   The stealth cruise is an improved version of the air-launched
missiles that have been tested over northern Canada for years. It
has stealth technology so it can better avoid detection and also has
increased range and better accuracy.
   ``It's standard procedure prior to doing any free-flight rest to
do a captive-carry mission where the unarmed missile remains
attached to the B-52,'' Martinsen said.
   Canada's decision to allow testing of the advanced cruise drew
protests from peace groups. They said the missile is an offensive
weapon that will fuel the arms race between the superpowers and
ultimately create a need for a costly and complex Canadian air
defense system.
   The Canadian and U.S. governments say the weapon is too slow to
be a first-strike, offensive weapon.
   Cruise testing here is carried out under an agreement signed with
the United States in 1983 and renewed last year.

<TEXT>
   Police opened fire on rock-throwing
mobs in Caracas slums on Thursday, and witnesses said soldiers shot
and killed at least 20 people in one area after snipers ambushed and
killed an army major.
   President Carlos Andres Perez blamed leftists for continuing
Venezuela's worst unrest in 31 years of democratic rule.
   El Nacional, an independent daily, said in its Friday edition
that 300 people had been killed and 1,500 injured in four days of
rioting sparked by bus fare hikes. The newspaper said the dead
included at least four children, ranging in age from 3 to 14.
   That raised the toll from unofficial estimates Thursday of 200
dead and 800 injured in the rioting in the capital and at least 11
cities nationwide.
   Perez said after a helicopter tour of capital Thursday that the
city of 4 million people was returning to normal.
   Witnesses said troops killed at least 20 people overnight in the
El Valle neighborhood south of Caracas in response to the slaying of
an army major by snipers.
   Maj. Felipe Acosta Carles was leading a group of soldiers in El
Valle Wednesday when he followed snipers to a secluded hut next to a
highway and was shot in a burst of gunfire, according to press
reports.
   Fransisco Solorza, a journalist who lives in the neighborhood,
said he saw at least 20 bodies being carried through the winding
streets of the neighborhood Thursday morning following nightlong
gunbattles.
   Photographers for El Nacional also said they saw at least 20
bodies from that clash at the central Caracas morgue.
   About 100 people ran down hills in western Caracas to shout
taunts and throw stones at the police and national guard units. The
authorities opened fire, dispersing the protesters.
   No report of casualties was given from the clash, which briefly
closed two stations of the capital's subway system.
   Perez declared martial law and an overnight curfew beginning
Tuesday, a day after increases in gasoline prices and transit fares
touched off the violence.
   An estimated 15,000 troops and 7,000 police maintained order in
the capital Thursday, and the president pronounced the emergency
``practically over.''
   But Perez said he was ``preoccupied and ashamed'' of the
``absurdity'' of lost lives.
   He said looters were only hurting themselves by destroying small
businesses that served poor neighborhoods, and blamed ``remnants''
of leftist revolutionaries for continued gun battles in the capital.
   ``These phantasmagorical remnants of subversives are still not
convinced this is a democratic country,'' said Perez, who has been
in office only a month.
   He said some acts ``were induced, and this has to be punished
severely.''
   On Wednesday, Gabriel Puerta, a former guerrilla leader, accused
the government of inventing political motives for the disturbances,
which he blamed on the failure of the government's economic policies.
   Mourners, some with black eyes and cuts from street violence,
waited outside the central Caracas morgue Thursday for the bodies of
loved ones to be released.
   Armando Rodriguez waited for the body of his 28-year-old brother,
Francisco, who was killed by a stray bullet Tuesday while watching
looters battle the army from the roof of his building west of
Caracas.
   ``We were up on the roof, about 20 of us, when the army arrived
and started firing in the air to scare the mob,'' Rodriguez said.
``I don't bear any grudges, but I would like to see an investigation
into my brother's death.''
   The unrest is the country's worst since January 1958, when 100
people were killed during the uprising that ousted dictator Gen.
Marcos Perez Jimenez.
   Venezuela, affluent during the 1970s thanks to its rich oil
reserves, saw its fortunes slide along with petroleum prices in 1981.
   Real wages have since fallen by one-third, inflation is expected
to hit 70 percent this year _ double the 1988 figure _ and the
foreign debt is $33 billion, fourth largest in Latin America after
Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.
   Bus fare increases of 30 percent to 50 percent and price gouging
by drivers were the immediate cause of the riots and looting.
   Two weeks ago, Perez announced a sweeping reform package under
pressure from international creditors that includes lifting ceilings
on interest rates, doubling gas prices and letting the currency
float, which means higher prices for imports.
   Also Thursday, Perez announced plans for emergency credits for
storekeepers who lost millions from the damage and looting.

<HEAD>Commission Co-Chairmen Defend Base-Closing Selections</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Congress should quit complaining about plans to
close 86 U.S. military installations and provide the money to
dismantle them, the co-chairmen of a commission which came up with
the plan said Thursday.
   In testimony before House and Senate defense appropriations
subcommittees, former Sen. Abraham Ribicoff, D-Conn., and former
Rep. Jack Edwards, R-Ala., urged lawmakers to accept the
base-closing package even if it does have shortcomings.
   ``Once you start chipping away, this thing goes down the tubes,''
Ribicoff told the House subcommittee. ``If you stop the momentum,
from my political experience, you're on the way to defeat.''
   Critics of the commission's recommendations, particularly
lawmakers facing closings in their areas, have complained that the
findings are flawed.
   For example, Rep. Edward Madigan, R-Ill., has said the commission
erred in its assessment of Chanute Air Force Base, one of the
facilities recommended for shutdown.
   ``The commission report suggests that the base has a shortage of
recreational, medical, housing and warehousing facilities,'' he
said. ``But base officials tell me that Chanute's recreational
facilities are among the best in the Air Force, that the commission
mistakenly underassessed the base's medical and dental capacity and
that the base actually has a surplus of housing.''
   But Edwards defended the commission's efforts.
   ``We collected a vast amount of data describing conditions at
thousands of installations we were asked to review,'' he said. ``We
did not just pluck this list out of thin air.''
   The panel appointed last year by former Defense Secretary Frank
C. Carlucci recommended that the Pentagon close 86 installations and
partially shut five others. Estimated savings are $5.6 billion over
20 years.
   Congress is scheduled to vote within weeks whether to accept or
reject the plan. It cannot pick or choose among bases to be closed,
and the closings can be blocked only if both the House and Senate
pass disapproval resolutions.
   Ribicoff acknowledged complaints such as those leveled by Sen.
Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill., who said U.S. overseas bases should have been
reviewed with an eye toward closing before any domestic bases were
considered.
   ``My personal thinking is that bases overseas ought to be closed
first,'' Ribicoff said. ``But we were forbidden to undertake it.''
   He and Edwards were making their second day of appearances in
support of the commission's efforts to solve the politically
sensitive issue of closing outmoded bases.
   They appeared Thursday before panels considering a Defense
Department request to appropriate $500 million in fiscal 1990 for
base-closing expenses.

   Seventy-five Vietnamese returned by charter jet
Thursday to the communist homeland they fled, and a report from
Hanoi said they were reprimanded upon arrival and told they faced
prison if they left again.
   The returnees were beginning the first repatriation program for
boat people no longer willing to languish in crowded detention
centers.
   The English-language South China Morning Post, in a report from
Hanoi published Friday, Vietnam's director of immigration upbraided
the boat people for leaving the country illegally.
   Officials told the group during a meeting at the airport's
immigration hall they could face 30 years in jail if they tried to
flee again, the paper said.
   The boat people, who were met by about 30 friends and relatives,
spent the night at a makeshift reception center near the Vietnamese
capital's airport, the report said.
   They were among about 11,000 Vietnamese who sailed into Hong Kong
after this British colony adopted a tough new policy last year that
for most of them rules out resettlement.
   The 2{-hour flight marked the first large-scale repatriation of
boat people, who have sailed by the tens of thousands to seek asylum
in non-communist Southeast Asia.
   Many of the returning 46 men, 19 women and 10 children boarded
the U.N.-chartered Boeing 737 jet smiling, waving and shaking hands
with local officials. Several wore new clothes; a few carried
cassette tape players.
   When their plane touched down in Hanoi on Thursday evening, they
were met by Vietnamese, British and U.N. officials, Hong Kong radio
reported. Relief officials aboard the airplane said there was no
tension during the flight, it said.
   ``I'm happy to be back,'' Lan Bun See told reporters as he
stepped off the plane. ``This is my homeland. I feel ... very
happy.'' The group was whisked to the passenger terminal by coach
where they were rushed through immigration, reports from Hanoi said.
   ``This is an important start,'' said Security Branch official
Michael Hanson, who watched the group leave Hong Kong. ``We hope
more people will take this route back to Vietnam'' and relieve the
crowded camps that are home to about 26,000 boat people in Hong Kong.
   The repatriation was arranged under an agreement reached by
Vietnam and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Hanoi promised
not to prosecute its returning citizens and to allow the
international organization to monitor their treatment back home.
   The U.N. commission agreed to provide assistance to the
repatriated Vietnamese. Returning adults received $50 and their
children $25, according to U.N. officials, and other unspecified
assistance will be offered.
   Two U.N. officials flew back with the group and were expected to
accompany the Vietnamese to their hometowns.
   Hong Kong, about 500 miles north of Vietnam, long classified all
arriving Vietnamese as refugees who could stay in the colony until
resettled elsewhere. Fewer than two dozen of the more than 120,000
Vietnamese who have come to Hong Kong returned home between 1979 and
1988.
   But to stem a growing influx of boat people, the colony adopted a
new policy in June under which Vietnamese are considered refugees
only if they can prove they fled their homeland because of
persecution.
   The vast majority of the 11,000 boat people who have arrived
under the new policy do not meet that standard under a Hong Kong
government screening program and are classified as illegal
immigrants who fled their impoverished homeland for economic reasons.
   Hong Kong wants to send them home forcibly, but Hanoi insists it
will only accept boat people who want to return.
   Despite the new policy, boat people continue to sail to the
colony, with 356 arriving last month, up from 114 in January and 91
in February 1988.
   Resettlement of the 15,000 Vietnamese in Hong Kong camps who have
been granted refugee status have received a boost with several
countries, including the United States, agreeing to increase the
number they accept.

   President Daniel Ortega said Thursday
the violence shaking Venezuela this week could happen at any time in
Latin America and urged the Third World to deal jointly with the
foreign debt problem.
   Ortega wrote Venezuela's President Carlos Andres Perez that the
bloody riots in his country are the result of ``rigid policies and
unjust economic relations'' by industrialized nations toward the
Third World.
   ``Today it's Venezuela; tomorrow it could be Brazil, Mexico,
Argentina or any of the nations of Latin America and the
Caribbean,'' Ortega said in his letter. ``All of them are exposed to
this jolt.''
   The letter to Perez, dated Thursday, was made available to news
media.
   Rioting and looting in Venezuelan cities have reportedly left at
least 200 people dead and 1,000 wounded. Violence hit after Perez's
government announced increases in the price of gasoline and public
transport, as part of measures demanded by the International
Monetary Fund to restructure the economy.
   ``It is time the governments unite to forge a common policy in
the face of an onerous and unpayable foreign debt, which limits our
chances of development and the available resouces to satisfy the
basic needs of our people,'' Ortega wrote.
   He told Perez he was ``deeply worried'' about the violence in
Venezuela.
   ``We know this is the result of rigid policies and unjust
economic relations that the industrialized nations and bodies such
as the International Monetary Fund have been imposing on developing
nations and particularly on the nations of Latin America and the
Caribbean,'' Ortega said in his letter.
   The leftist Sandinista government's economic plan for 1989
includes measures similar to those being put in place by Venezuela
to fight hyperinflation. Nicaraguan measures call for budget cuts of
more than 40 percent, laying off more than 30,000 public employees,
and tightly restricting credit.
   Nicaragua's currency, the cordoba, has been devalued six times so
far this year. Each time, the price of gasoline, and consequently
food prices also rose.
   No public protests have emerged because of the economic measures.
Ortega on Wednesday warned right-wing business executives in
Nicaragua and the ``Yankee empire'' not to incite the Nicaraguan
people to insurrection, saying they would be ``the first victims''
of an uprising.

   Terry Rakolta expected family television on the
top-rated, prime-time series ``Married ... With Children,'' but was
so offended by the off-color humor in a recent episode that she sent
her children out of the room.
   Although she thought she would be ignored, Rakolta was angry
enough to stay up that night until 4 a.m., writing to complain to
advertisers about sexual innuendos and the treatment of women on the
Fox Broadcasting Co. show.
   Now Procter &amp; Gamble Co., McDonalds Corp., Kimberly-Clark Corp.
and Tambrands Inc. have told their advertising agencies not to buy
time on the program, which began in 1987 and is the most successful
show on the fledgling Fox network.
   The president of Coca-Cola USA, Ira Herbert, told Rakolta in a
letter that his company would screen the show more closely in the
future.
   ``I must tell you that I am corporately, professionally, and
personally embarrassed that one of our commercials appeared in this
particularly unsuitable program episode,'' Herbert wrote.
   The results surprised Rakolta, 40, a resident of the affluent
Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills, with daughters 18, 10 and 9, and
a son, 8. Her husband, John, is president of a construction company.
   ``I am not an activist. ... I've been involved in civic groups,
but nothing cause-oriented,'' she said in a telephone interview
Thursday.
   That may change, she said, because she wants to start or join
groups to organize national boycotts of advertisers with commercials
on network television shows that have sexually oriented or violent
scenes.
   Rakolta said the show she watched one Sunday night in January
with her son and younger daughters depicted a man visiting a
lingerie store. The show included references to vibrators, an older
man walking around in a garter belt and a woman in the store
removing her bra for strangers, she said.
   ``I was thinking it was a family program because it was prime
time, 8:30 p.m. I was horrified,'' she said.
   Fox, which tries to attract young adult audiences in its effort
to build a fourth television network, has no trouble selling
advertising time on the show which airs Sunday evenings, said Fox
spokesman Brad Turell in Los Angeles.
   ``The show is completely sold out,'' he said, adding that reports
of Mrs. Rakolta's campaign have rallied support behind the show.
   ``We have received literally hundreds of telephone calls today
from across the country from viewers saying that this one woman's
opinion is getting too much attention and hoping that we won't
change the show,'' Turell said.
   Rakolta says the key issue at stake is viewer choice _ not
morality _ amid what she feels is a proliferation of such shows that
restrict her family's viewing choices.
   ``One person can really make a difference if they push the right
buttons. And the right buttons are not the producers in Hollywood,
they're the people that pay the money for the show,'' she said.
   ``Married ... With Children'' is a broadly played blue-collar
comedy about a hapless shoe salesman, his vain wife and their two
borderline, juvenile delinquent kids. Critics have favorably
compared it to ``The Honeymooners.''
   Other Fox officials defend the show. Don R. Bay, a Fox vice
president, wrote that the Bundy family is ``a comedic counterpoint
to other fictional television families who enjoy above average
incomes, greater opportunities and have more refined tastes.''
   Gary Lieberthal, chairman of Columbia Pictures Television,
producer of the series, called it ``a parody of American life in a
lower socioeconomic family.''
   An occasional episode may offend some people, he wrote Rakolta,
but ``Hopefully, many people (though we know not all) will be
entertained by the outrageously absurd lives and off-center values
of the Bundy family.''
   The American Civil Liberties Union said Thursday that those who
seek to influence television content through pressure on advertisers
are attempting censorship.
   ``If you don't want to watch it then don't watch it,'' said Carol
Sobel, an ACLU attorney who has dealt with free speech issues. ``I
think what is inappropriate is to force your views on anyone else.''

   Britain said Thursday it would not accept new
Iranian offers of negotiations until the Islamic government
renounces violence in the dispute over the novel ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   Iran, however, said it was Britain that was making the overtures
and that author Salman Rushdie remains subject to ``divine justice.''
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe, meanwhile, said he
understood the book was ``deeply offensive'' to Moslems, and that it
also offends Britons by likening their country to Nazi Germany.
   The Foreign Office said it had been contacted Wednesday and
Thursday by the Iranian Foreign Ministry proposing a meeting in
Geneva this week.
   The Iranians, according to a Foreign Office spokesman, said they
wished to discuss a resolution passed Tuesday by the Majlis that
gave Britain a week to back away from its defense of Rushdie.
Otherwise, diplomatic relations would be severed.
   ``We saw no merit to a meeting at this stage,'' said the
spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``They would have to
renounce violence, or the threat of it. That is absolutely
cardinal.''
   That apparently means Britain would expect Iran to renounce the
death sentence pronounced against Rushdie by Iran's spiritual leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on Feb. 14. Iranian clergymen have
offered bounties up to $5.2 million for Rushdie's death.
   Following the Foreign Office statements, the Iranian news agency
IRNA quoted a Foreign Ministry source as saying Britain proposed
talks and was rebuffed.
   Howe said in an interview on BBC radio that he could empathize
with Moslems feeling offended by book, which he said is ``offensive
in many other ways as well.
   ``We are not upholding the right of freedom to speak because we
like the book, because we agree with the book,'' he said.
   ``The British government, the British people, do not have any
affection for the book. The book is extremely critical, rude about
us. It compares Britain with Hitler's Germany.
   ``So we are not sponsoring the book. What we are sponsoring is
the right of people to speak freely, to publish freely,'' he said.
   Rushdie is also critical in his book of Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and her conservative policies.
   Howe plans to meet in Vienna on Monday with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who has indicated a willingness to
mediate.
   Since Khomeini condemned Rushdie, Britain and its 11 European
Economic Community partners have withdrawn their envoys from Tehran
and Iran's top diplomat left London.
   The Soviets' official Tass news agency, in a commentary
Wednesday, acknowledged the concern of Western countries about death
threats but defended Khomeini.
   ``Perhaps Imam Khomeini, the supreme religious authority in Iran,
had no choice proceeding from Koran teachings, other than denouncing
a man who has insulted Islam?'' Tass diplomatic correspondent Vadim
Biryukov wrote.
   ``The denunciation was nothing more, by the way, than the
position of a religious leader,'' he wrote. ``The Iranian government
has not condemned Rushdie to death.''
   A similar line had been taken by Iran's charge d'affaires in
Britain, Mohammad Basti, shortly before Khomeini quashed diplomatic
efforts by reaffirming the death sentence.
   At one point, Iranian President Ali Khamenei had said that
Rushdie might save himself by apologizing, and Iranian diplomats
reacted positively to statements by their British counterparts that
Thatcher's government had no role in publishing ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   The latest overtures from Tehran apparently reflect continuing
divisions within the Iranian government between Shiite Moslem
hard-liners and more moderate elements, who seek warmer ties with
the West.
   Rushdie, a native of India who is now a British citizen, is
reportedly in hiding in Britain with his American wife. The Zurich
weekly Zuri-Woche, quoting sources identified only as ``literary
circles,'' said in its society column that Rushdie has fled to
Switzerland.
   In Cairo, Egypt's Nobel Prize-winning author Naguib Mahfouz, in a
newspaper interview published Thursday, urged Moslem countries to
condemn Iran's death sentence but proposed a boycott of Viking
Penguin, which published ``The Satanic Verses.''
   In Stockholm Thursday, Sweden's Nobel prize-awarding literary
academy defended free speech but did not explicitly support Rushdie.
The academy had been under pressure from literary and other
organizations to take a clear stand for Rushdie.
   Most of its members however have individually expressed strong
indignation at the campaign against Rushdie.
   Moslem demonstrators blocked roads and burned effigies of Rushdie
on Thursday in India's Bengal state, and the United News of India
said 50 people were arrested.
   The book has been banned in Iran, Senegal, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia,
Jordan, Syria, Egypt, South Africa, Brunei, Pakistan, Bangladesh and
Kenya, and 18 people have died in protests in India and Pakistan.
   Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' is blasphemous because it
portrays the prophet Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and suggests
that Mohammed, not God, was the source for the Koran, Islam's holy
book.
   At the United Nations, a Security Council diplomat said the world
body would not stand up for Rushdie for fear of offending Iran and
jeopardizing forthcoming Iran-Iraq peace talks.

   Former Alderman Edward R. Vrdolyak, who launched a
write-in campaign less than a week before the Republican mayoral
primary, apparently defeated the GOP-enorsed candidate, a city
election official said Thursday.
   Vrdolyak totaled 11,621 votes, or 52.5 percent, to 10,478 votes,
or 47.4 percent for Dr. Herbert Sohn, who had the party's backing,
said Ray Jagielski, one of three members of the Chicago Board of
Election Commissioners.
   ``It's a great victory for all of the people that voted for me,''
Vrdolyak said at the elections board. ``It's not a personal victory
for me.
   ``When you're going over uncharted waters, a write-in campaign,
you know it's going to be hard and you don't know what to expect.
But if the people can spell Vrdolyak or close to it ... it was just
wonderful.''
   Four of the city's 2,911 precincts remained uncounted and all
ballots must be reviewed before the winner is certified by the board
on Tuesday.
   Vrdolyak also apparently had a large enough lead to prevent Sohn
from finishing within 5 percentage points, which would entitle him
to a so-called ``discovery recount,'' an automatic recount of 25
percent of the precincts.
   Sohn will ask a judge to order a discovery recount, said Sohn's
campaign manager, Chris Robling. By law, the results of such a
recount may be used only to seek a court-ordered recount of all
ballots.
   ``If we don't get the discovery recount, we will look for other
ways to show a judge the count was improper,'' said Burton Odleson,
Sohn's attorney. ``We'll find and interview election judges,
precinct workers ... and others if need be.''
   The GOP winner named by the commissioners will face two other
candidates in the April 4 general election in this traditionally
Democratic city.
   Richard M. Daley, son of the late, legendary boss of Chicago
politics, defeated Mayor Eugene Sawyer in the Democratic primary
Tuesday. Sawyer's chief black rival, Alderman Timothy Evans, is
running a third-party challenge on the Harold Washington Party
ticket, named for the city's first black mayor, who died in 1987
during his second term.
   Daley was vacationing in Florida, but his press secretary, Avis
LaVelle, dismissed Vrdolyak's influence on the general election.
``We don't view him as any particular threat,'' LaVelle said. ``I
don't think he will hurt anybody very much.''
   Evans agreed. ``It doesn't mean anything to me, frankly,'' he
said.
   Both Vrdolyak, 51, and Sohn, 61, had said they expected to
challenge the results in court and had retained seasoned election
attorneys. A court fight conceivably could delay the general
election.
   Though both Vrdolyak and Sohn, like Daley, are white, political
observers said only Vrdolyak had the potential to draw off a
significant number of voters from Daley's core constituency of
ethnic whites.
   ``Sohn, like most real Republicans in Chicago, has only a small
following and would barely cause a ripple. Eddie can't win, but he
could cause some real mischief,'' said Tom Roesser, a veteran
political analyst active in Republican and civic circles.
   Nearly 25,000 Republican ballots were cast in the city's 2,911
precincts Tuesday, about 10,000 more than in 1987.
   Vrdolyak, a former county Democratic party chairman and alderman,
has lost his last two tries for elected office. He ran an
unsuccessful third-party bid for mayor in 1987 and lost last fall as
the GOP candidate for clerk of the Cook County Circuit Court.
   But he did receive about 80 percent of the white vote in 1987
against Washington.
   One political observer said that Vrdolyak's campaign would not
make much difference to either Evans or Daley.
   ``Daley will win it anyway. Vrdolyak will only draw white votes
away (from Daley) if people are sure they're not endangering the
chance of a white candidate winning,'' said Paul Kleppner, a
Northern Illinois University professor and author of ``Chicago
Divided: The Making of a Black Mayor.''

   Leftist guerrillas late Thursday
attacked a military post in a residential neighborhood outside the
capital, killing at least three soldiers and two civilians.
   The attack comes just one day after the armed forces said it was
beginning a three-month cease-fire in the conflict with the rebels.
   Guerrillas attacked just before sunset, firing four anti-tank
rockets at the state-owned ANTEL telephone switching station in San
Ramon, on the northwestern edge of the city.
   The attack on the telephone facility, which caused no casualties
and slight damage to a brick wall, appeared to be diversonary.
   Minutes later, about 10 blocks away, a firefight erupted at the
San Ramon Civil Defense post, where about 20 soldiers were stationed.
   Several dozen soldiers from the 1st ArmyBbrigade on duty nearby
advanced toward the post and the exchange escalated into a fierce
battle that lasted for nearly an hour.
   Panicked residents threw themselves on the ground behind walls,
parked vehicles and piles of bricks and cinderblock at a masonry
supply business along the route of the soldiers' advance.
   ``Commie dogs! Show yourselves, cowards!'' shouted some of the
soldiers as they advanced, running crouched and pausing every few
yards to survey the scene, aim and fire.
   An air force helicopter flew over the battle, but did not open
fire.
   Journalists saw at least three dead soldiers being loaded onto a
truck. Two civilians, one of them an adolescent boy, also were
killed.
   ``There are lots of dead,'' said one young soldier to a
journalist.
   Several soldiers were wounded, but there was no official count as
of Thursday night.
   There was no immediate indication of guerrilla casualties.
   Earlier Thursday, leftist rebels said the army is violating its
own cease-fire by moving into territory controlled by the guerrillas.
   ``That demonstrates the falsehood of the supposed cease-fire,''
said the insurgents' clandestine Radio Venceremos.
   A top colonel said the army has ``the legal and moral
obligation'' to defend against guerrilla attacks despite the
cease-fire.
   Radio Venceremos did not mention fighting as a result of army
troop movements in the northern zones of Morazan, San Miguel and
Chalatenango provinces. It only said the army had physically entered
rebel territory.
   The northern sectors of the three provinces are dominated by
leftist rebels waging a 9-year-old revolution against the
U.S.-backed government.
   The armed forces on Wednesday began what they said was a
three-month cessation of offensive operations designed to provide
conditions for peace talks. The government of President Jose
Napoleon Duarte has called on the rebels to respond in kind.
   The rebels said Wednesday they were willing to declare a
cease-fire once a time, place and agenda for peace talks is agreed
upon.
   The guerrillas have said they will participate in and respect the
outcome of this year's presidential election if it is postponed from
March 19 until September.
   The guerrillas have accused the government of procrastinating in
response to their peace overture.
   ``The government and armed forces have lacked seriousness in the
way they have dealt with our proposal and the expectations it has
created. That could harm prospects for a good outcome of the search
for peace,'' the rebel broadcast said Thursday.
   The U.S. State Department said the rebels' refusal to declare a
unilateral cease-fire called into question the sincerity of their
stated desire for peace.
   The rebels have continued attacks. They wounded three National
Guardsmen Wednesday night in an assault in Tejutepeque, in the
northern province of Cabanas.
   ``A cease-fire does not mean the armed forces relinquishes its
constitutional duty of defending sovereignty and ensuring security,
tranquility and stability,'' Col. Mauricio Vargas, commander of the
eastern region, said in a televised interview Wednesday night.
   ``If people are up in arms in any part of the nation's territory,
we have the legal and moral obligation to fight them,'' he said.

   A 5-month-old boy, kidnapped Thursday after his
parents crashed through a window to escape robbers, was recovered
unhurt 16 hours later at a subway station and his two abductors were
arrested, police said.
   ``The baby is safe,'' said police spokesman Sgt. Maurice Howard
after the infant, Mikhail Grant, was swapped for ransom at a subway
station in the tough Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn shortly
before 5 p.m.
   Mikhail's ordeal began shortly after 12:30 a.m. Thursday, when
his father, Fynlass Grant, 27, returned home from his job as a
livery driver.
   Grant said he was pushed into his second-floor apartment in
Queens by two men with automatic weapons, said Inspector Richard
Mayronne.
   When the men burst in, baby's mother, Yvonne Grant, 26, who is
pregnant, jumped out the second-story window. ``She didn't stop to
open the blinds or the window,'' said a police source speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Mrs. Grant was treated for a broken ankle at Mary Immaculate
Hospital.
   The two men tried to force Grant to open a safe that was in the
house but he was too nervous, the police sources said. The safe
contained about $4,000 and some jewelry, the sources said.
   The sources said the gunmen knew Grant as a low-level drug dealer
and believed he had money.
   Grant leaped out the same window as his wife as one of the gunmen
scooped up the baby, said Mayronne.
   The abductors called the family home three times, demanding the
money and jewelry in the safe. A ransom drop at the subway station
was set up but the kidnapers fled around 7:30 a.m., minutes before
police could close in,
   ``They're obviously not professional kidnappers,'' said Mayronne.
``I consider them very low on the food chain, someone who would take
a 5-month-old baby.''
   Another drop was negotiated, and at 4:45 p.m. Grant, accompanied
by a plainclothes police officer, exchanged the baby for a bag of
ranson.
   The officer arrested a 17-year-old man who gave his identity as
Josiah Robinson, who will be charged with kidnapping, Mayronne said.
   The other suspect, Wayne Johnson, who was at the opposite end of
the platform where the swap took place, jumped onto the subway
tracks and fled by was arrested a short time later. He faces the
same charges, Howard said.
   Mrs. Grant has three other children, ages 6, 7, and 8, but police
said it was not clear whether they were at home at the time of the
incident.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of opposition members
marched through the capital on Thursday demanding free elections and
an end to human rights abuses.
   Protesters waved placards demanding ``justice, peace, liberty and
democracy'' as human rights monitors from the Organization of
American States looked on.
   Marco Tulio Bruni Celli of Venezuela, head of the delegation from
the Inter-American Human Rights Commission, said the panel has heard
charges that opposition candidates in the May 7 elections have been
threatened, tortured and muzzled.
   The elections for president, legislators and local
representatives cannot be ``completely free'' as long as the media
is muzzled and the opposition cannot participate fully in the
campaign, he said.
   The commission members, who arrived Monday, viewed the four-hour
march through the capital and called upon the government to restore
freedom of the press.
   The human rights investigators were to meet Friday with Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, leader of the defense forces and de factor
ruler of the country.
   The marchers walked several miles, shouting slogans of ``for the
love of Panama, we will not be overcome!' and ``The people are in
the streets asking for liberty!''
   The protesters also demanded the reopening of three newspapers,
three radio stations and a television station shut down by the
government during the past year for their alleged acts against
national security. All were owned by deposed President Eric Arturo
Delvalle.
   Noriega engineered Delvalle's ouster after Delvalle tried to fire
the general in the wake of his indictment by a federal court in
Florida on drug trafficking charges. Solis Palma was then named
acting president.
   The human rights delegation, which is preparing a report for the
OAS General Assembly on the human rights situation in Panama,
planned to leave Panama on Friday.
   The protest was organized by the Democratic Alliance of the
Civilian Opposition, made up of several opposition parties and
organizations.
   In another development, Panama on Thursday denied U.S. charges
that it is interfering with Panama Canal operations by refusing to
issue vehicle license plates to canal employees.
   Dennis McAuliffe, the U.S. administrator of the canal said
Tuesday that many of the commission's 6,500 employees had been
unable to obtain their 1989 license plates.

   A judge suspended the
corruption trial of former President Salvador Jorge Blanco on
Wednesday after prison authorities failed to bring the defendant to
court on time for opening session.
   Judge Juan Maria Severino halted the trial after allowing the
authorities 50 minutes to escort Jorge Blanco to the court from La
Fe prison less than two miles away in Santo Domingo, the capital.
   He set no date for resuming the trial.
   Jorge Blanco was brought into the courtroom about 10 minutes
after the proceedings broke up. There was no explanation for the
failure to get him to court earlier. The drive ordinarily takes
about 10 minutes.
   Jorge Blanco, 62, president from 1982-86, was taken back to
prison, where he has been held since returning to the Dominican
Republic on Nov. 30.
   Jorge Blanco returned home three days after he was convicted in
his absence of embezzling $5 million from the government by
inflating the price of equipment bought by the military and national
police in the last two years of his administration.
   Jorge Blanco had been living in Atlanta, where he had been
undergoing treatment for a heart ailment since May 1987.
   Severino presided over that earlier trial and sentenced Jorge
Blanco to 20 years in prison and fined him $16.4 million.
   Under Dominican law, the former president Blanco had the right to
a new trial upon returning to this Caribbean nation.
   Two businessmen convicted with Jorge Blanco in November, Leonel
Almonte and Juan Tomas Pena Valentin, are serving 20-year prison
terms.

<TEXT>
   A record 46.5 percent of the drivers on U.S.
roads use safety belts, a federal report said Wednesday.
   Based on a survey of more than 50,000 drivers in 19 cities, the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said seat belt use
increased for the 12th consecutive time since it began making
semiannual surveys.
   The agency estimates that safety belts saved 4,300 lives in 1988
and 15,200 lives since a national campaign began in 1982.
   Before the campaign and enactment of state laws requiring belts,
only 11 percent of drivers used them, the report said.
   The survey, conducted in October and November 1988, showed that
in 13 surveyed cities where safety belt laws were in effect, usage
averaged 51.1 percent, compared to 36.3 percent in six cities
without belt laws.
   The government estimates 10,000 more lives could be saved if all
motorists used safety belts.
   Cities in the survey where seat belts are required showed the
following percentage of use by drivers: New York, 28.4; Baltimore,
50.7; Pittsburgh, 43.9; Chicago 29.8; Minneapolis, 61.5; Miami,
51.6; New Orleans, 40.7; Seattle, 61.4; San Francisco, 55; San
Diego, 59.1; Los Angeles, 52.7; Houston, 61.4, and Dallas, 67.7.
   Cities with no belt requirement had the following percentages:
Boston, 37.8; Providence, 19.9; Fargo and Moorhead, 35.7; Atlanta,
31.7; Birmingham, 35.2, and Phoenix, 52.7.
   The safety administration, in a news release giving the results,
did not say how the survey was conducted or how many drivers were
checked in each city.

<TEXT>
   Yasser Arafat said
Wednesday that his Palestine Liberation Organization invited Syria,
Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon to meet to coordinate policy on a Middle
East peace conference.
   The five parties are directly concerned with the Arab-Israel
problem, the PLO chairman said.
   The proposed international peace conference under U.N. auspices
would include participation by Israel and the five permanent
Security Council members _ the United States, the Soviet Union,
China, Britain and France.
   Arafat made his announcement through WAM, the official news
agency of the United Arab Emirates, soon after arriving in Abu Dhabi.
   WAM quoted Arafat as saying the invitation was for a policy
coordination meeting to take place ``within two to three weeks, to
coordinate stances on preparations for the international conference
on peace in the Middle East.''
   The Cairo representative of the PLO, Saeed Kamal, was quoted this
week as saying Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze proposed
reactivation of the five-member panel which was first set up after
the pan-Arab summit of 1974 when the PLO was named the sole
legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.
   Arafat said Shevardnadze told Egyptian officials during his
recent Middle East swing that Syrian President Hafez Assad ``agreed
that Syria should participate fully in the meetings of that
committee.''
   The United Arab Emirates is among Arab states trying to heal
rifts between Syria and Egypt and between Syria and the PLO.
   Rifts in the Arab ranks after the late Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat visited Jerusalem in 1977 froze the five-member group's
activities. Syria has refused to patch up differences with Egypt
unless it officially revokes the 1978 Camp David peace framework
that Sadat signed with Israel.
   In 1983, Syria also broke off with Arafat, saying he was moving
in line with ``surrenderist'' settlements with Israel.
   Arafat said the venue of the proposed meeting has not yet been
fixed but that it could be held in Damascus, Cairo, Amman or Tunis,
where the Arab League and the PLO are headquartered, WAM said.

into a Western-style welfare state that is both independent and
neutral.
   Demands for a multi-party system, greater human rights and
sweeping reform of the penal code were made at a meeting to recruit
new members to the party re-established itself in January after a
40-year pause.
   The party was dissolved when the communists came to power in 1948.
   The ruling Communist Party endorsed a multi-party system for the
first time early last month but stressed the transition to more
pluralism should be gradual and orderly.
   
   About 600 people listened to speeches by members of a provisional
six-member presidium in an engineering company meeting hall. None of
the presidium members is well known except the president, Andras
Revesz, 79.
   A party program distributed at Wednesday's meeting advocates
parliamentary democracy, full human rights, elimination of military
blocs and an independent, neutral Hungary.
   Speakers challenged the Communist Party monopoly in every aspect
of life, particularly its control of the judiciary and media.
   Presidium member Tibor Baranyai said the group wants to join the
Socialist International. He and others called for trade union
pluralism and praised Social Democratic policies developed by Willy
Brandt, former chancellor of West Germany, and former Chancellor
Bruno Kreisky of Austria.
   Several speakers, including Baranyai, warned of Communist
infiltration and influence in the new party.
   Perhaps because of those fears, the leadership has decided that,
until the first party congress late this year or early next, the
presidium will include only people who belonged to the Social
Democratic Party abolished during Communist takeover in 1948-49.
   The Hungarian Parliament, which is increasingly outspoken, is to
pass a bill legalizing alternative political parties by Aug. 1. If
Hungary implements genuine power-sharing, it would be the first East
bloc country to have a bona fide multiparty system.
   
   Dozens of independent groups have formed in Hungary over the past
year, several of which are likely to become political parties. In
addition to the Social Democratic Party, the Smallholders Party also
announced its return after 40 years.

   A judge hearing the case of a
terrorist attack on a military base said Wednesday he will
investigate allegations that soldiers killed some attackers after
arresting them.
   The accusation was made by human rights organizations and the
previously unknown group that claimed responsibility for the attack,
the Popular Resistance Front.
   Eduardo Barcesat, lawyer for some of the 13 civilians arrested
Jan. 24 at La Tablada infantry base on the outskirts on Buenos
Aires, said Carlos Samojedny, Francisco Provenzano and Berta Calvo
surrendered after the attack.
   Provenzano, a leader of a group called Everyone for the Country,
later was found dead, his body apparently run over by a truck,
Barcesat said.
   Samojedny has not been found, though forensic experts still have
not identified six of the 28 commandos killed by soldiers during the
battle. Ms. Calvo's body was found among the dead.
   Federal Judge Gerardo Larrambeberre said he would investigate the
allegation that the three who surrendered were killed. But he had no
comment on the charge or allegations that civilians tried to
surrender twice before soldiers, hours later, finally allowed them
to do so.
   Thirty-nine people died during the attack and counterattack,
including nine soldiers and two policemen. More than 60 were wounded.
   The Front, in two declarations made from neighboring Uruguay,
said it acted to forestall an imminent military coup. No evidence
was presented to support that claim, and the government of President
Raul Alfonsin has dismissed it as baseless.
   A total of 20 people currently are in jail awaiting prosecution,
including a Roman Catholic priest and six others arrested in the
aftermath of the incident. Charges have not formally been presented,
and no trial date has been set.

   Assault troops brought in by
helicopter raided a Communist rebel training camp Wednesday near
this northern Philippine town named for the family of ousted
President Ferdinand Marcos.
   Brig. Gen. Bayani Fabic reported one arrest, but said the
14.8-acre camp was abandoned by the time about 30 troops arrived
aboard four helicopters.
   Elsewhere, the military reported that Moslem rebels killed five
troops and that about 75 communist rebels burned three buses on
Tuesday in Banay-Banay village in Davao Oriental province, about 630
miles southeast of Manila.
   The government-run Philippines News Agency said New People's Army
rebels also set fire to three trucks there and made off with food
and other cargo.
   The agency said the incident disrupted transportation in Davao
Oriental for the rest of the day when other public buses refused to
use the route.
   No explanation was given for the attacks, but rebels often
targeted transport companies which refuse to pay ``revolutionary
taxes.''
   The military said Moslem fighters killed three militiamen in an
ambush Sunday on the outskirts of Isabela town in the southern
island province of Basilan. It added that a breakaway Moslem group
ambushed a marine patrol Tuesday on Jolo Island, killing two
troopers.
   Three Moslem groups are fighting to establish an independent
nation in Islamic areas of the southern Philippines. Their rebellion
runs parallel with the 20-year-old communist insurgency, which began
when Marcos was president.
   Marcos was driven into Hawaiian exile by a popular
military-civilian uprising three years ago.
   Fabic said raiders found 50 dummy rifles used to train guerrillas
as well as first-aid kits. He said the camp included four wooden
huts, a field hospital and obstacle courses.
   The general said the raid blocked rebel plans for attacks on
municipal halls in several towns in this area, 240 miles north of
Manila.
   The camp was about four miles outside the Ferdinand municipal
district, part of the town of Marcos.
   Fabic said the rebels had begun a big recruiting campaign in the
province, which is considered a Marcos stronghold.

<TEXT>
   A Northwest Orient DC-10 bound from Frankfurt, West
Germany to Boston with 232 aboard made an emergency landing in
London Wednesday after an engine stalled, then continued on when
mechanics gave it a clean bill of health.
   The plane landed at Gatwick Airport on two of its three engines,
said an airport spokesman, who spoke anonymously.
   Northwest Orient spokesman Andy Plews said the No. 2 engine
stalled on takeoff from Frankfurt, West Germany ``and instead of
trying to restart the engine in flight the captain decided to divert
to London Gatwick.''
   The 222 passengers and 10 crew aboard Flight 47 disembarked
normally after the landing, an airline statement said.
   Mechanics checked out the engine on the tarmac, running it up to
full power in a test ``and discovered that there was no problem with
it,'' Plews said.
   The plane continued on its flight 5{ hours after landing in
London.
   He said Northwest Orient doesn't know why the engine failed ``but
it is possible for engines to do this occasionally. It could be a
lack of air flow through the engine which can be caused by an
atmospheric condition.''
   In a separate development on Wednesday, Brian Lavers, an aircraft
surveyor for Britain's Civil Aviation Authority, criticized airlines
for paying too little attention to corrosion.
   Lavers told a conference of about 100 experts at Gleneagles in
Scotland that airlines and others responsible for aircraft
maintenance showed a continuing apparent reluctance to make the
small extra investment in tackling the problem.
   Lavers reported that the belly areas of transport planes were
allowed to remain wet and dirty, retaining a mixture which acted
like wet blotting paper and defeated anti-corrosion coatings.
   The U.S. Air Transport Association said Monday that hundreds of
repairs were needed on certain aging airliners if more than 1,000
airplanes are to keep flying. The repairs would cost hundreds of
millions of dollars.

   Colombia's national police raided two
jungle laboratories, seizing 3,740 pounds of cocaine and arresting
32 people, the country's top police official said Wednesday.
   The raids were part of a month-long campaign in which police have
confiscated 7,700 pounds of cocaine. The campaign, called Operation
Springtime, is the longest-running series of strikes against cocaine
traffickers ever seen in Colombia.
   The latest raids were conducted Tuesday near the town of Zarzal,
about 145 miles southwest of the capital of Bogota, and near the
town of Mani, 125 miles east of Bogota, police Gen. Miguel Antonio
Gomez Padilla said in a communique.
   In addition to the almost four tons of cocaine seized in the last
month, police have confiscated 135 tons of marijuana and have
destroyed 65 cocaine labs and 16 runways used by planes hauling
cocaine to the United States, the general said.
   Police also have destroyed 540,000 gallons of chemicals used for
processing cocaine and have burned 85 acres of coca plants.

<TEXT>
   Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said
Wednesday he was forced to cancel a speaking tour in the United
States because of links to a widening stock scandal.
   Nakasone, prime minister from 1982-1987, was invited to speak at
the Massachussetts Institute of Technology, Yale University and Duke
University this week. He also was to meet with President Bush and
former President Reagan during the 14-day trip.
   ``It is very regretful and I must apologize for causing trouble
to the people who invited me,'' Nakasone said in a nationally
televised interview. ``But I guess a politician has to expect
something like this to happen.''
   Nakasone has been linked to the scandal in which Hiromasa Ezoe,
founder of Recruit Co., an information and publishing conglomerate,
sold unlisted shares in a subsidiary to more than 150 people at
bargain prices. Share prices shot up once they were listed publicly,
netting the buyers large profits.
   On Mondaym Nakasone acknowledged that his aides purchased and
reaped profits from the Recruit shares. Nakasone said the money was
used to purchase year-end and summer greetings gifts.
   Nakasone's link to the affair was brought to light after it was
revealed three of his aides earned more than $640,000 in profits by
selling their shares.
   Opposition parties, claiming Nakasone played a key role in the
affair, have demanded the government call the former two-term prime
minister to Parliament for questioning.
   ``It is not an appropriate time for him to travel abroad, while
opposition parties are demanding he be summoned to Parliament and be
questioned,'' said Osamu Yatabe, a parliamentarian from the largest
opposition group, the Japan Socialist Party.
   Eight people, including Ezoe, have been arrested and accused of
bribery and violating the securities law.
   The scandal, which has already forced the resignations of three
Cabinet ministers, has caused a public uproar and severely damaged
the credibility of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's administration.

<HEAD>Proposed Settlement In School Case Is Signed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state agreed Wednesday to encourage
desegregation throughout Arkansas and pay more than $100 million to
settle a 6-year-old federal desegregation case brought by the Little
Rock School District.
   The proposed settlement involving the state and all three school
districts in Pulaski County was signed by attorneys for all the
parties before U.S. District Judge Henry Woods.
   The mostly black Little Rock School District sued the state and
the neighboring, mostly white North Little Rock and Pulaski County
Special school districts in federal court six years ago, alleging
the defendants caused illegal segregation in Little Rock schools.
   Woods found North Little Rock and Pulaski County liable and
ordered the districts merged, but the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, affirming Woods' liability ruling, said his proposed
countywide consolidation was too severe.
   Instead, the appeals court ordered the boundary line between the
Little Rock and Pulaski County districts redrawn, moving large,
mostly white sections of the city of Little Rock, which were in the
county district, into the city district. North Little Rock was not
affected.
   The appeals court then asked the district judge to consider how
much the state would have to pay to fund compensatory programs in
the three districts, especially Little Rock. This led to the
settlement.
   If the agreement is approved by Woods, the state would be
released as a defendant in the case. Final approval would need to
come from Woods, all three school boards involved, the Legislature,
and the state Board of Education. No hearing was set.
   Robin Armstrong, Little Rock School Board president, said she was
pleased with the settlement, and Sheryl Dunn, a member of the
Pulaski County School Board, called it a momentous occasion.
   The terms of the settlement, under which the state will pay out
more than $100 million, include:
   _The state must pay the Little Rock district $59.1 million over
10 years for compensatory education programs and other desegregation
expenses, and the North Little Rock district $2.7 million in seven
annual payments, also for compensatory education.
   _The state must pay $7 million to the Pulaski County district by
July 1, plus an additional $6.7 million by July 1, 1990, if the
Legislature raises state revenues during the current session; if no
additional revenues are raised, the district would get $16 million
over five years.
   _The state must block construction of any school in a county
bordering Pulaski County if the new school would hurt desegregation
of schools in Pulaski County.
   _State officials must recommend to the Legislature repeal of all
laws impeding desegregation, and not to propose any new ones that
would have that effect.
   _The state must recruit black teachers for all three districts
and push for legislation to help minority students enroll in
teacher-education programs at college.

<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burma announced a proposed election law
Wednesday that would bar military officers currently governing the
country from running in next year's elections.
   State-run Radio Rangoon said the Election Commission, which
drafted the law, would make the document available to the public and
political parties Thursday for suggestions.
   Citing key points of the law, the broadcast said government
employees, including members of the armed forces and police, could
not run for election. That would prevent Gen. Saw Maung and other
members of the ruling military council from running unless they
resign from the armed forces.
   Saw Maung seized power in September. His troops brutally put down
a pro-democracy uprising that for months had clamored for the end of
26 years of authoritarian, one-party rule.
   Saw Maung allowed the formation of political parties and has
promised general elections in 1990 and a freer economy.
   The radio said the proposed law sets the voting age at 18 and
reduces the earlier minimum age of candidates from 24 to 21. Banned
from participation are people with allegiance to foreign powers,
members of parties who receive financial support from foreign groups
and people with links to Burma's numerous rebel groups.
   The Election Commission has asked the general public and
political parties to submit suggestions by March 31. It also has
asked the parties, which currently number 233, to choose between
different voting systems.

   Less than 30 percent of taxpayers have filed
their returns halfway into the filing season, but the pace is still
ahead of last year's.
   The Internal Revenue Service said Wednesday that through Feb. 24,
it had received 30.8 million returns, up 2 percent over the
comparable period of 1988, when 30.2 million were received.
   The number of taxpayers filing the long Form 1040 _ most of whom
itemize deductions _ dropped 4.2 percent, the IRS said. But the
number filing the ``short'' Form 1040A and the one-page 1040EZ rose
7.5 percent and 6.8 percent. This year's figures include 13.1
million long forms, 8.5 million Form 1040A and 9.1 million Form
1040EZ.
   The IRS read the figures as suggesting ``that many taxpayers who
filed Form 1040 in the past may be switching to the simpler, shorter
forms.''

   A National Research Council report that said
vitamin pills and some other dietary supplements are useless and
perhaps harmful was denounced as ``a disservice to all Americans''
by a trade group.
   The group, called the Council for Responsible Nutrition, said
that the NRC report released Wednesday failed to acknowledge what it
called ``emerging research'' on benefits from supplements of
vitamins, fiber and calcium.
   ``The NRC report provides only a shallow review of the evidence
on the benefits of nutritional supplements and fails to reflect the
tide of research that supports those benefits,'' the trade
association said in a prepared statement.
   The NRC on Wednesday released a 1,300-page report that is a
compilation by 19 experts of research from many sources related to
diet and health. The three-year study concluded that health is best
maintained by a balanced diet of a variety of foods in a diet that
is reduced in fat and salt, and enriched with fruits, vegetables and
complex carbohydrates.
   The study said the NRC committee found no conclusive evidence
that taking doses of supplemental vitamins, fiber or calcium would
provide protection from cancer, heart disease, embrittlement of
bones or other ailments.

   A man whose capital murder conviction has
been overturned after he spent 13 years behind bars says he won't be
satisfied until his innocence is proven through a new trial.
   ``If the case is dropped where does that leave me?'' Randall Dale
Adams told The Associated Press on Wednesday after a state appeals

steps with nothing.''
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled that Adams, whose
conviction for the 1976 slaying of a Dallas police officer was
questioned in the film ``The Thin Blue Line,'' had been denied a
fair trial because witnesses lied and the prosecutor suppressed
evidence.
   It ordered the 40-year-old Adams transferred from the Eastham

   The city is ``saturated'' with aliens denied
jobs because of the new immigration law, possibly leading to this
week's arrests of 175 suspected illegal immigrants smuggled east on
airlines, officials said.
   ``A year ago we'd average five men a night sleeping in our

Roman Catholic parish that has become a refuge to illegal immigrants
from Mexico and Central America.
   U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service agents on Wednesday
arrested 27 more suspected illegal aliens aboard a Piedmont Airlines
flight during a stop in Charlotte, N.C., between Phoenix and New
York.
   The journey of the Salvadorans, Ecuadorans, Mexicans and
Brazilians began with an America West flight from Los Angeles to
Phoenix, authorities said.
   On Monday, 79 suspected illegal aliens taking Eastern Airlines'
``red eye'' from Los Angeles to New York were arrested during a stop
in Atlanta. Late Monday, 69 were arrested while boarding the same

   Mayor Tom Bradley proudly calls Los Angeles
``the new Ellis Island,'' where waves of immigrants have produced
amazing cultural diversity.
   But increasingly schools, courts and businesses throughout
Southern California are struggling to cope with scores of languages
that threaten to create a metropolitan Babel.
   Examples abound:
   _The Los Angeles Unified School District tries to teach most
courses in the students' native languages until they develop fluency
in English. The task is monumental: 160,000 students have as their
primary tongues more than 80 languages, from Afghan, Afrikaans and
Amharic to Urdu, Yoruba and Yiddish.
   _During last year's fire in the city's tallest skyscraper,
emergency announcements were in English and largely useless. Nearly
all the 50 people in the building that night were janitors who spoke
only Spanish.
   _In Orange County, commonly associated with surfers and
Disneyland, minorities make up more than 40 percent of public school
students, and a recent poll found the 100,000 Vietnamese residents
felt their top need was English-language classes.
   Police in the Orange County cities of Westminster and Garden
Grove have recruited Vietnamese speakers to investigate tight-knit
Asian gangs. The Santa Ana school district had to turn away about
half the 800 Spanish-speakers who waited in line, some overnight, to
sign up for English courses.
   _Tens of thousands of Soviet Armenians and Jews have poured into
the area in recent years as the Soviet Union relaxed emigration
policies. Overwhelmed social workers say the refugees must be
educated quickly or risk becoming permanently dependent on the
government.
   The number of refugees streaming into Los Angeles County from
around the world has tripled since 1985, reaching a high of 19,011
in 1988. But federal funds to help the newcomers dropped from $7.1
million in 1985 to $2.8 million last year.
   _In Glendale, for decades another white suburban bastion, a
survey last spring found that 54.5 percent of the students in city
schools came from homes where English was not the primary language;
more than 60 languages were spoken.
   On rare occasions, the problems can be comical. Glendale teacher
Matilda Mardirossian was glad that Michael Dukakis lost the
election, not because of politics but because of his name, which is
pronounced the same as an off-color phrase in Armenian, the first
language spoken by many of her students.
   ``They were giggling over his name,'' she said. ``I definitely
didn't want to hear it for the next four years.''
   Most skirmishes in the war of words are more serious.
   Last month, Executive Life Insurance Co. dropped an English-only
rule for employees rather than fight a civil rights suit filed by
the local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and the
Asian Pacific American Legal Center of Southern California.
   ``Los Angeles, and California as a state, are at a turning point,
as far as being a global center of many cultures,'' said Stewart
Kwoh, the founder of the legal center. ``And while English is the
principal language through which we converse, it is not going to be
possible for us to play a leadership role if we cannot accept other
languages and cultures.''
   But acceptance can come slowly in cities like Monterey Park, 10
miles east of downtown Los Angeles. The city of 62,000 became known
as the ``first suburban Chinatown'' or the ``Chinese Beverly Hills''
as Asians, many of them affluent, supplanted Anglos and Hispanics as
the majority group.
   Most signs along the Atlantic Boulevard business strip are now in
Chinese as well as English, with Ai Hoa Supermarket and Bank of
Canton of California competing for attention with Security Pacific
Bank and Pic 'n' Save. Chinese-language newspapers outnumber English
papers in sidewalk news racks.
   Monterey Park Mayor Barry L. Hatch has loudly called for a ban on
immigration into the United States, supports a law making English
the official U.S. language, and crusades against non-English books
at the library.
   ``Monterey Park is a beautiful little suburban town, almost rural
in some parts. And now we drive through our little commercial area
and feel like we're in Hong Kong,'' he said. ``When you're an Anglo
or Hispanic and you can't read the signs, it makes you feel like a
second-class citizen.''
   Other nearby cities have reacted with laws dictating how much
English must appear on signs: Temple City (100 percent in English
downtown, 50 percent in outlying areas), Arcadia (70 percent),
Pomona and Rosemead (50 percent).
   ``Historically, immigrants have come to America with the
understanding they're going to have to give up their primary
language,'' Hatch said. ``Now we're looking at floods of immigrants
who say to hell with the process _ we'll do it our way.''
   Inevitably, disputes wind up in court.
   One lawsuit that failed in state court in 1987 wanted the Los
Angeles school district to immediately provide English classes to
40,000 foreign language speakers, despite the fact that 200,000
people already were enrolled in such classes and the district said
state funds for them had run out.
   A suit pending in federal court contends aliens are deprived of
their rights in Southern California immigration courts by inept
interpreters and a practice of translating only parts of deportation
hearings.
   Seven people worked as translators for Los Angeles County courts
in 1962. Today 453 do, interpreting 70 languages and dialects, with
257 Spanish translators by far the most numerous.
   Ed Johnson, director of interpreter-translator services, said
about 300 interpreters work in the county's municipal and superior
courts on a typical day. The 1962 translation budget was about
$30,000, he said; this year's is about $6 million.
   Sophia Zahler, who heads the federal court translation service
here, says Spanish speakers account for 95 percent of interpreters
used in federal courts nationwide. But in California, the ``other''
category jumps to 20 percent, with demand for Korean, Tagalog, Thai,
Armenian, Cantonese, Mandarin, Farsi, Hebrew and even Tongan.
   Some profit by the linguistic gridlock, such as accent-reduction
teachers who charge $60 to $85 a session for a dozen individual
sessions. There are hundreds of takers.
   Others see benefits in language differences.
   At Edison Elementary School in a Hispanic section of Santa
Monica, kindergarten and first grade pupils are taught in Spanish
except for one oral English class, regardless of whether students'
parents speak English or Spanish. English-language classes are
gradually added, working up to a 50-50 language mix in sixth grade.
   ``The Edison School project assumes that both Hispanics and
Anglos will emerge competent in both languages,'' said Russell N.
Campbell, a UCLA linguistics professor.
   Similar programs may be set up in Koreatown, Little Tokyo or
Chinatown, but Campbell acknowledged they will remain special.
   ``It just isn't possible in a class where a teacher is facing 15
kids who speak different languages,'' he said. ``And what do we do
about those classes with the single kid who speaks Lao or Hmong?''

<HEAD>`Day One' Trudges Through History of A-Bomb</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This reviewer was under the impression, during
the interminable hours it took to slog through ``Day One,'' that it
must be a three-part miniseries.
   What a surprise to realize it's only three hours long. ``Day
One'' airs on one day, Sunday, on CBS.
   Certainly, a movie about the development of the A-bomb, the
Manhattan Project as it was called, sounded like it had a lot of
potential _ the race against time, the dangerous testing, and most
importantly, the deep moral questions about developing so
destructive a weapon.
   Unfortunately, the script by producer David Rintels, based on
Peter Wyden's book, ``Day One: Before Hiroshima and After,'' is
deadly dull.
   To his credit, Rintels avoids pat answers and explores complex
questions _ was it really necessary to bomb Japan to end World War
II, or did Congress just want to see the bang that $2 billion worth
of taxpayers' bucks had bought?
   And Rintels refuses to junk up an inherently dramatic true story
with a lot of phony made-for-TV love interests and subplots.
   It's just that it takes extremely good writing to turn historical
accuracy into drama, especially when the story is mostly talk and
little action.
   It's also difficult following all the characters. Much of the
story winds through the Washington bureaucracy. A narration might
have helped, eliminating the need for awkward, unlikely dialogue to
explain identities, such as, ``You're the supreme commander of the
Allied forces that won the war. Of course, he'll care what you
think.''
   The movie does boast an impressive cast, including Hume Cronyn
and Barnard Hughes in supporting roles. Brian Dennehy and David
Strathairn do their level best with the two leads.
   Dennehy plays Gen. Leslie Groves, a military disciplinarian in
charge of the Manhattan Project, who had little use for scientists
standing around all day kibbitzing about fission and implosion.
   There is an interesting relationship between Groves and his
seeming opposite, the intellectual Dr. Robert Oppenheimer
(Strathairn), who impresses the general with his bluntness. Michael
Tucker is admirably sympathetic as Leo Szilard, the German scientist
who turned against the bomb that he was instrumental in creating.
   But pair Rintels' script with Joseph Sargent's unimaginative
direction, and no acting can save scene after plodding scene of
talking heads spouting platitudes.
   ``It's about our responsibility for the development of this most
terrible weapon by which modern civilization could be completely
wiped out,'' Secretary of War Henry Stimson (Hughes) explains to
President Harry Truman (Richard Dysart). ``But on the other hand, if
the problem of proper use of this weapon can be solved, we'll have
the opportunity to save world peace and our civilization.''
   Groves talks to Oppenheimer. Szilard talks to the secretary of
state. Oppenheimer talks to Szilard. Oppenheimer and Groves talk to
the Cabinet.
   This wordiness is relieved only occasionally when the scientists
at the research center in Los Alamos stand on a sand dune and blow
up an iron pipe, then run over to examine it.
   Rintels tries to build suspense leading up to the first test
detonation _ a potentially riveting moment _ with endless discussion
of the weather, which is about as suspenseful as endless discussion
of the weather.
   When the first mushroom cloud ever ignites the desert sky, one of
the scientists exclaims, ``It's brighter than a star!'' ``It's
brighter than two stars!'' Groves adds.
   The dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima is portrayed through use of
archival footage. Then there is an almost-powerful scene when the
scientists who developed the bomb and cheered its success see slides
of the devastation it has wrought. But by then, unfortunately,
viewers will be too bored to be moved.

<HEAD>Writer of `Day One' Digs Under the History of The Bomb</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David Rintels, the producer and writer of CBS'
``Day One,'' was 7 years old in 1945, the year the first atomic bomb
tumbled out of the Enola Gay and plummeted toward Hiroshima.
   ``What I remember was that the war was ending and that people's
fathers _ including mine _ were coming home. It was wonderful,''
Rintels recalled. ``And I don't think a lot of people immediately
thought much beyond that. So it's kind of startling to realize, as
you go back through the record, that a lot of the people who were
involved in the decision had a very different point of view.''
   Drawn to history with the dirt-under-the-fingernails
determination of an archaeologist, Rintels uses the past not to
propel steamy chronicles of passion and greed, but, as ``Day One''
demonstrates, to explore what interesting people do when placed in
difficult circumstances.
   ``Day One,'' a three-hour CBS movie airing Sunday, is about the
building and dropping of the bomb on Japan.
   Rintels focuses on those individuals who both triumphed in and
agonized over the creation of Fat Man and Little Boy, the names of
the A-bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. ``We didn't muck it
up with love stories and red herrings and false drama,'' Rintels
said. ``God knows it's an important and dramatic enough story
without trickery.''
   For Rintels, as both an Emmy-winning writer (``Fear on Trial,''
``Clarence Darrow'') and television producer, it is a familiar
approach.
   In ``Gideon's Trumpet,'' he examined the criminal justice system
through a semiliterate suspect's eyes.
   With ``Choices of the Heart,'' Rintels sifted through the life of
Jean Donovan, an American lay missionary raped and killed in El
Salvador.
   And in ``Sakharov,'' he presented a non-ideological look at the
Soviet system and its effect on the country's leading dissident.
   If his projects are united by one theme, Rintels said, it is one
which embraces historical integrity and rejects bias.
   ``The argument over docudrama that is fought so vociferously
always has to do with accuracy,'' Rintels said. ``But that is far
less important in my way of thinking than is fairness to all sides.
You could be absolutely accurate and be loaded so much on one side
or another that you've distorted the real truth.
   ``Yet you can't know the truth of everything. It's not known to
anybody, least of all a guy like me who's trying to dramatize things
where there are frequently conflicting accounts or no accounts.
   ``I don't believe in some kinds of what-if drama, like what if
Ruby hadn't killed Oswald and there was a trial? Or what if George
Custer had been court-martialed? I don't like those kinds of shows.
That's make-believe. But here's a show in which there was conflict
and ambiguity, and they came out with a clear decision. Some people
think that it was not only the right decision, but it was also
absolutely inevitable.
   ``But it wasn't absolutely inevitable. A different president, a
different adviser ... I think the decision (to drop the bomb) could
have come out differently.''
   ``Day One'' presents both sides of the atomic bomb dilemma with
equal fervor.
   ``A lot of people say, `If you'd been there, what would you have
done?' And I don't know,'' Rintels said. ``If I was there in what
capacity? If I was a general? or a scientist? or a politician? One
of the most interesting things about this show that I found was that
nobody has a corner on either wisdom or patriotism.
   ``It's not the conventional good guy-bad guy, white hat-black hat
drama. It doesn't reduce it to that kind of simplicity, at least I
feel it doesn't. Ambiguity, or complexity, is better drama.''
   In ``Day One,'' Gen. Leslie Groves (Brian Dennehy), is asked to
organize a team of scientists to build an atomic weapon. J. Robert
Oppenheimer (David Strathairn) is willing to lead the effort, but
fellow physicist Leo Szilard (Michael Tucker) is haunted by the
Manhattan Project's moral implications. Szilard lobbies to stop the
weapon he helped start.
   ``What was most surprising to me, I guess, was that the debate
about whether to drop the bomb was as dramatic and interesting and
relevant and human as it really was,'' Rintels said. ``It feels like
a contemporary, immediate debate. I think most people have the idea
that there was not a lot of discussion _ that the bomb was dropped
to end the war: bang!
   ``The definition of drama I love best is to take people you
really care about and put them in situations that are hard to
handle. Because history can be dry. But if you get people _ flesh
and blood, with real emotions, with a lot at stake _ and you can get
other people involved in that, that's a lot better than blackboard
teaching.''

   In contrast to the conservative,
produced-to-a-polish and totally predictable managers who occupy the
executive suite in many mature companies, the founder was probably
simple, direct and unpredictable.
   That was J.B. Fuqua, founder of Fuqua Industries and, until he
eased himself out of the positions recently, its chairman and chief
executive officer.
   J.B., now 70, is an original, which makes his legacy especially
vital and meaningful today, when so many corporate messages are
crafted by publicists to impress a particular audience or create a
public image.
   This is part of his message, distilled from a commencement
address at Oglethorpe University in 1986, and perhaps a rare and
old-fashioned model for other corporate chairmen now preparing to
address the 1989 graduating classes.
   The subject was success and leadership.
   ``Attaining one's goals, however modest they may be, is success
for that individual,'' according to Fuqua. ``There is no more
successful a person than one who becomes a good teacher and is
dedicated to conveying knowledge.''
   Ambition and leadership are much the same, although one must
first be ambitious to become a leader, he said. He added, ``it
occurs to me that we have fewer people today than at any time in my
memory who are actually ambitious.''
   Leaders, he said, always want to be at the head of the line.
``They think big thoughts; they avoid a lot of trivia; and they just
don't waste precious time.'' They are curious. They learn how to use
books.
   ``The best way to be a success and a leader is to act like one.
Choose those people who are successful and imitate them. Getting
ahead of the crowd can be almost that simple.''
   One thing you will notice about successful people, he said, is
that they have better personal habits than the crowd. ``They dress
better. They don't smoke. They don't abuse drugs or alcohol. They
are careful of health.''
   When Fuqua started out he had little money. Moreover, he was very
young (he was a radio engineer at 19, part owner of a radio station
at 21). He learned to dress well.
   ``I dressed better than my peers because I knew I didn't have any
experience and had a limited education; but by dressing better I was
confident I could make a good first impression,'' he said.
   ``If you don't remember anything else I say today,'' he told the
students, ``I hope you will remember this: You'll never have a
second chance to make a first impression.''
   Leaders work longer hours. By working just 10 hours a week more
than average you gain three months more experience in just one year,
``and in only four years you've picked up an additional whole year.''
   Manners count. ``Learn to say `thank you' sincerely every time
there is any excuse for doing it.'' Be punctual. Be courageous.
``One of the great opportunities we have in this country is the
opportunity to make a mistake.''
   Leaders are accessible. ``I've always said I'm going to talk to
everyone who phones me because Santa Claus might call one day and I
don't want to miss him.''
   Leaders learn early that we all have two ears and two eyes, but
only one mouth. ``We don't learn anything while we are talking. The
only help your mouth can give you in learning may be in asking the
right questions.''
   Finally, never succumb to the weakness of saying you are just one
person and don't amount to very much.
   ``Individuals are the only important people there are. The world
only recognizes individuals. ... Nowhere in Atlanta will you find a
single monument erected to a committee.''
   But, he added, being an individual doesn't mean you need to be
just a common individual, an ordinary person.
   Fuqua, personally involved in every operation of his consumer
products and service business from its beginning in 1968 to is
present eminence on the New York Stock Exchange, was famous for
unique leadership.
   At one point he faced criticism for shrinking the company when
growth was in vogue. His individuality and courage were vindicated,
however, when the profits went up.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the bustling markets that line the
narrow, winding alleys and the muddy Kabul River, war always seems
just around the corner.
   Tanks with their guns fixed and armored personnel carriers block
intersections.
   Young soldiers clutching Kalashnikov rifles in one hand and
plastic prayer beads in the other patrol the streets and stand guard
on rooftops.
   Helicopter gunships chug along the snow-covered mountains lined
with radar installations.
   The Moslem guerrillas battling the forces of Afghanistan's
Soviet-style government are hiding beyond the ridges that form a
bowl around Kabul, the capital city of 2.25 million. They
periodically launch a few rockets into the capital.
   There's little feeling of imminent danger in the marketplaces,
where merchants wrapped in tattered brown shawls and dingy white
turbans sit cross-legged on the ground in front of huge piles of
fruits and vegetables.
   But rumor and speculation are as plentiful now as Russian caviar
and vodka were before the Soviet army pulled out last month.
   ``It's the weather. They (the guerrillas) are waiting for
spring,'' said one vendor, Zahir.
   ``It's the shura,'' added another, Ibrahim, referring to a
guerrilla meeting in Pakistan and suggesting the fighters are too
preoccupied setting up a government-in-exile to launch major
assaults.
   Moscow pulled out the last of its 115,000 troops and ended its
nine-year military involvement in Afghanistan on Feb. 15, leaving
the Afghan forces alone to battle the U.S.-backed guerrillas.
   The departure of the last Soviet soldier passed without much
notice in Afghanistan. Most people seemed more concerned about food
shortages and the lack of fuel to heat their mud brick homes on the
freezing winter nights.
   There were no official ceremonies and only the barest
acknowledgment by the Kabul government of the Kremlin's involvement
in a war that killed 13,000 Soviet soldiers.
   The Soviets have worked tenaciously to ensure that a friendly
government remains in power in Kabul, and they have backed several
ineffective measures aimed at drawing the rebels into a coalition
government.
   President Najib outlined what he called a government of national
reconciliation, urging unity with the guerrillas who have battled
the Kabul regime since a few party members engineered an April 1978
coup and began trying to radically alter the economic, social,
political and religious life of Afghanistan.
   The guerrillas rejected Najib's peace overtures and vowed to
destroy his government.
   The president has in turn tightened his grip on power.
   He declared a state of emergency and suspended many individual
rights. He purged his Cabinet of some members who were not from his
People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, replacing them with his
most trusted advisers. And he placed the fate of the country in the
hands of a 21-member military council.
   The government said the actions did not close the door to
negotiations with the guerrillas.
   ``We have to move more cautiously now than ever. But we still
want negotiations. We want a rainbow coalition that represents all
segments of Afghan society,'' said Abdul Fatah Weidi, the Foreign
Ministry's information chief.
   Some diplomats and observers believe the guerrillas may be on the
threshold of power.
   But bitter divisions among the guerrilla factions are evident,
with some supporting establishment of a strict Islamic republic and
others supporting a more broadbased government.
   Many observers believe a power struggle similar to that which has
plagued Najib's party could break out among the guerrillas.
   Pressure has been increasing for policymakers from Western
countries to help mold the guerrillas into a more responsible,
coherent group. But observers in Kabul doubt it will happen.
   ``Outside interference in Afghanistan has historically been a
disaster _ both for the Afghans and for the outside powers. The
Russians ignored this reality,'' said one U.N. official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Afghanistan was one of the world's poorest countries before civil
war erupted 10 years ago. Relief officials say it will take years
and billions of dollars just to restore it to its prewar state.
   They estimate they will need $1.6 billion for the first 18 months.
   The country has the world's lowest average life expectancy _ 42
years _ and the highest child mortality rate _ 30 percent of all
children die before the age of 5, according to UNICEF.
   Late last year, a U.N. convoy carrying wheat seeds and fertilizer
took off from Kabul for the guerrilla-controlled Panjsher Valley,
where thousands of farmers hoped to begin planting for the first
time in 10 years.
   It was the first such international effort and was a major test
of whether the country was stable enough to begin rehabilitation
work.
   Several hours outside Kabul, the convoy was hijacked by a rival
guerrilla group. Several U.N. staff members were taken hostage.
   Afghan and Soviet troops responded with tanks, artillery and air
bombardments.
   No was was injured, and the workers were released after four
days. But any illusions relief workers might have had about a quick
and easy end to the suffering were shattered.
   ``We were anxious to do some real rehabilitation work,'' said
Ross Mountain, deputy director of the U.N. Development Program.
   ``But we learned the hard way that there are many, many different
groups out there. It looks like things will have to shake down some
more,'' he said.

<HEAD>With Elections Near, Many Argentines Still Undecided</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As national elections move closer,
the biggest bloc of voters remains undecided, despite months of
feverish campaigning by the main presidential contenders.
   Analysts say the undecided voters are mainly supporters of
President Raul Alfonsin's Radical Civil Union angry at five years of
economic stagnation and social unrest; Peronists unhappy with their
party's candidate, the center-right Carlos Menem; and center-left
voters who feel none of the candidates speak for them.
   ``I don't feel represented by any of them,'' said Virginia
Dardalla Rute, 33, the owner of a small public relations company.
``None of them will make a good president.''
   Real estate agent Sandra Reymann, 25, voted for Alfonsin in 1983
but has been disappointed and would rather not vote for a Radical in
these elections, set for May 14. But at the same time, she would
never vote Peronist or socialist and doesn't think a conservative
could win.
   ``I'm not uninformed,'' Miss Reymann said. ``I read the papers. I
listen to the radio.'' But no candidate stands out, she said, and
the ballot she casts _ voting is mandatory in Argentina _ may be
blank.
   At state in the elections are the presidency, some Senate seats,
half the House of Deputies, and provincial legislatures.
   Three surveys conducted over the past two months have put
undecided voters at 39 percent, 32 percent and 32.5 percent.
   Menem is 7 to 10 points ahead of the Radicals' Eduardo Angeloz in
those polls and others, but the gap has narrowed considerably.
Alvaro Alsogaray of the rightist Democratic Center Union trails a
distant third, followed by Nestor Vicente of the United Left.
   Under the constitution, Alfonsin cannot seek a second consecutive
term.
   Menem and Angeloz, both provincial governors and lawyers, have
traversed the country and made the requisite swing through Europe to
demonstrate their statesmenship abilities.
   Positions have been staked out on how to restart the economy,
balance the budget, curtail urban crime, provide housing, pay the
foreign debt, and ease relations between the military and human
rights groups.
   Menem, 53, and Angeloz, 57, are both center-right, but their
parties are movements that defy political labeling. Their parties,
along with the armed forces, have provided Argentina's presidents
for most of this century.
   Menem has tried to play down the Peronists' ``black legend'' of
violence and administrative incompetence, which preceded military
coups in 1955 and 1976. The latter has tried to distance himself
from an unpopular government without losing the support of Alfonsin,
a veteran campaigner, and resources like access to state media.
   Now and again, the two snipe at one another. Angelos says Menem's
proposals are ``simplistic.'' Menem says Angelos represents a
government ``that fulfilled only 5 percent of what it promised.''
   But each for the moment seems more interested in polishing his
own public image _ Menem as the charismatic champion of organized
labor and the downtrodden, and Angeloz as the honest administrator
and family man _ than in demolishing the other.
   ``I won't let you down'' is the slogan on Menem posters, which
show the candidate with his hair to his shoulders and sideburns
covering most of his cheeks.
   ``It can be done!'' is Angeloz's slogan. He usually appears on
posters and in person in a blue blazer and open-necked shirt,
wearing thick-framed black glasses and a broad smile.
   Vicente, a lawyer and several times a losing candidate for the
House of Deputies, lacks a nationwide constituency and is little
known outside the capital. What he really is aiming to do is
increase the number of leftist legislators in Congress.
   Alsogaray, for the same reasons, has little chance of winning.
But the 75-year-old military engineer and former economy minister
and ambassador to the United States is a potential kingmaker.
   In a scenario that frustrates Menem and makes Angeloz credible
despite any poll, no candidate will win enough votes to guarantee
victory in the Electoral College, and the 600 electors pick a
president, or failing to do that, pass the decision onto Congress.
   In either case, the conservative Alsogaray may trade his electors
for political concessions, and his party has much more in common
with the Radicals than the Peronists.
   In 1983, Alsogaray supported Alfonsin, reluctantly, to prevent a
Peronist victory.
   Angeloz and Alsogaray insist their electors will vote for them.
More importantly, both have rejected Peronist suggestions that the
runners-up support the candidate who gets the most votes.
   Maria Julia Alsogaray, a national deputy and key adviser to her
father, in an interview published in the Buenos Aires Herald
acknowledged that in the end, either in the Electoral College or
Congress, her party might provide the winning margin.
   She set no specific concessions the party would demand but
insisted that ``any candidate wishing to get our votes would have to
adhere'' to the party's platform, which calls for the privatization
of state industries and minimal government, among other things.

   Next fall's college freshmen face some of the
worst tuition news in years.
   The first trickle of announcements from public and private
universities show tuitions and other fixed fees heading 7-15 percent
higher, the ninth consecutive year such charges will exceed the
nation's overall inflation rate.
   Tuitions at both public and private institutions had shot up in
double digits from 1981 to '84, but had moderated somewhat in the
last three years. In 1988-89, they were up an average of 5 percent
at publics, and 9 percent at privates, according to the College
Board.
   But signs are that next fall will bring that moderating trend to
a halt at many colleges _ and some students are already protesting.
   
   One, George Washington University, said freshman fees will rise
by 20.1 percent, or $2,000, to $11,500, while returning students
will be hit with a smaller, 10 percent increase.
   By far the worst news is that higher education economists see no
letup in the cost pressures that have been pushing tuitions up
throughout the 1980s.
   ``I see trends that have been going on for a decade that are not
moderating: the need for financial aid, the rising cost of library
acquisitions, the need to improve salaries,'' said Richard Rosser,
president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and
Universities in Washington.
   Kent Halstead, an expert on college finance and director of
Research Associates of Washington, calculates that faculty salaries,
which averaged $37,000 in 1988, are still $4,000 below 1973 levels
in terms of purchasing power, allowing for inflation. He figures
that even with the huge tuition increases marking most of the 1980s,
faculty salaries have still only recouped half the losses suffered
due to the inflationary '70s.
   ``Catchup is still the rule with faculty salaries,'' said
Halstead.
   Library costs have likewise soared this past year, according to
several college officials who blame the weak U.S. dollar for
increasing the cost of acquiring foreign-printed books and research
journals.
   At George Washington, library acquisition costs rose 30-50
percent last year, said Robert A. Chernak, vice president for
student and academic support services. Such costs, along with a 6
percent rise in faculty salaries, were key factors behind the $2
million operating deficit that led to next fall's mammoth tuition
increase.
   Princeton University projects a $1.5 million deficit and recently
announced a higher-than-anticipated 6.9 percent tuition increase,
partly because of soaring library costs, said spokeswoman Jacquelyn
Savani.
   Savani added that the 1987 stock market crash had an apparent
psychological impact on college donors, turning them more cautious
even though the market has since made up the ground it lost. Changes
in federal tax law making charitable giving less advantageous have
put a further damper on college fund-raising, and are adding to the
upward pressure on tuitions, she said.
   ``One has to scale back one's assumptions about the kind of
income you can get from (fund-raising) campaigns,'' she said.
   Among other private institutions, rates will rise 12.5 percent at
Syracuse University, 7.5 percent each at Brown University and
Stanford University, 8.3 percent at Lehigh University, and 8.5
percent at Lafayette College.
   Several other schools besides George Washington are starting
two-tier tuition systems of whopping increases for freshmen and
lesser ones for returning students. Seton Hall University will
charge freshmen 19.6 percent more next fall, while upperclass
tuition will go up 10.8 percent.
   Johns Hopkins University, citing a projected $3-6 million deficit
in its school of arts and sciences, set increases of 16.6 percent
for freshmen and 8.3 percent for returning students. Duke University
and the University of Chicago have established similar two-tiered
structures.
   Financial aid costs have also soared at private institutions. At
Cornell University, which will announce a roughly 7 percent tuition
increase later this month, aid costs will reach $17.8 million next
fall, compared with just $5.1 million in 1981, according to
spokesman Sam Segal.
   Overall, the nation's private colleges are spending $3.5 billion
on financial aid, compared with $900 million in 1979, a fact Rosser
blamed on cuts in federal aid programs.
   The first signs aren't much better in the public sector, which is
generally slower in announcing its fall tuitions.
   During the last three years, public universities had moderated
their average tuition hikes to 5-6 percent, compared with increases
that reached a high of 20 percent in 1982-3. But higher education
officials note growing sentiment in many states, especially those
with budgetary problems, to boost students' share of the cost of
public college.
   ``Public universities are now such a tremendous deal,'' said
Halstead. ``There is a genuine shift in philosophy in many states
that there ought to be more of a `user tax' to support public
education.''
   On average, tuition and fees cover just 25-33 percent of the cost
of an education at public universities, compared to about 80 percent
at private schools, said Robert Aaron, a spokesman for the National
Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges.
   ``It is fair to say that states in fiscal stress are looking for
ways to diminish their higher education burden and are looking for
students and parents to pay a larger share,'' Aaron said.
   Texas public colleges are raising tuitions for residents by 12.5
percent. And students have protested an Oklahoma state regents'
proposal, which still awaits legislative approval, to raise freshmen
tuition at the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University
by 19.7 percent.
   New Jersey state colleges will charge students about 7 percent
more next fall, about $150-200 per student, according to Darryl
Greer, executive director of the state's College Governing Boards
Association.
   Former U.S. Secretary of Education William J. Bennett used to
mince no words in regularly lambasting higher education for raising
tuitions while doing little to curb what he considered waste and
mismanagement.
   By contrast, the current education secretary, former Texas Tech
University President Lauro F. Cavazos, pulled his punches in a
statement released by his office.
   ``Most certainly, the projected rise in college tuition costs is
a concern to me,'' he said, acknowledging the challenge for college
administrators ``in meeting rising costs while at the same time
keeping tuition within potential students' reach.''
   At the University of Oklahoma, about 40 students chained
themselves in protest to the administration building last November
when tuition plans were announced.
   ``There's a chance that we may be locked out of an education,''
said protest organizer J.P. Blackwood, a senior from Bartlesville.
``It (tuition) is on the verge of having doubled since I've been
here.''

<HEAD>Airlines Planning Response To Looming Strike, Threatened Boycott</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Major U.S. airlines, bracing for the twin threats
of a strike against Eastern Airlines and a disruption of
transportation nationwide, are making two kinds of contingency plans.
   Several of Eastern's competitors said Wednesday they are
assembling plans to respond to a possible walkout Saturday by the
Machinists union, which could send passengers booked on Eastern
scurrying to other airlines. Eastern carries an average of 100,000
passengers a day.
   In addition, some carriers are mapping strategy to keep operating
in the event of a secondary boycott by the Machinists, who have
threatened to picket other airlines over the Eastern dispute.
   To absorb the passenger spillover from a strike against
Miami-based Eastern, some competitors plan to roll out extra
sections _ an extra plane for existing flights.
   Pan Am Corp., for example, plans to operate a ``double shuttle''
on its service linking New York with Boston and Washington if a
strike occurs. Pan Am and Eastern compete fiercely with their
profitable hourly shuttle services.
   Starting Monday morning during peak travel hours, the Pan Am
shuttle would have flights every half-hour instead of the current
hourly take-offs, said Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon. At
``prime'' peak hours, even more flights could be added as needed,
she said.
   Pan Am, which also vies with Eastern in the lucrative Florida
market, also plans to put extra sections on some flights and switch
to larger aircraft on others.
   Airlines admit, though, that it's difficult to actually add new
flights to their schedules in a pinch.
   ``We don't have a lot of extra aircraft sitting on the ground
that we can throw into the schedule,'' said Delta Air Lines
spokesman Jim Lundy, adding that Delta might add one or two flights
at the most.
   Atlanta-based Delta, one of Eastern's closest competitors, vies
with the besieged carrier in the Florida and Puerto Rican markets.
Like many of the airline spokesmen polled, Lundy said Delta believes
it can handle most of the surplus with its current seat capacity,
even if the strike spills into the busy Easter-spring vacation
travel time.
   Several Eastern rivals said Wednesday they still hadn't decided
whether they will honor Eastern tickets in the event of a walkout.
   As a strike deadline of midnight EST Friday set by the militant
Eastern Machinists looms, hope is fading for a last-minute
settlement of the 16-month contract dispute. The National Mediation
Board has recommended that President Bush declare a presidential
emergency, a move that would delay any work stoppage for at least 60
days.
   AFL-CIO officials, meanwhile, said Tuesday they would urge their
14 million members to picket, boycott and otherwise rally against
Eastern nationwide if the Machinists strike.
   Machinists said they too would picket Eastern's sister carrier,
Continental Airlines, plus other airlines, ships, railroads and
other transportation services covered by the federal Railway Labor
Act.
   ``We do not expect any impact at Continental from the Eastern
situation,'' said Ned Walker, a spokesman for non-union Continental
in Houston, which like Eastern is a subsidiary of Texas Air Corp.
``There will be no service disruption whatsoever.''
   Just in case of a sympathy action, Walker said, Continental is
making contingency operating plans. He declined to give details.
   So are industry leader United Airlines and USAir Group Inc.,
according to their press representatives, who also declined to
elaborate.
   ``Unequivocally, United Airlines has a plan,'' said spokeswoman
Sara Dornacker at the Chicago heaquarters of United.

<HEAD>Pepsi Expects 250 Million Worldwide Will See New Ad With Madonna</HEAD>

   Pepsi-Cola Co. hopes to reach a worldwide
television audience of 250 million today as its two-minute
commercial with pop singer Madonna makes its debut in 40 countries
from Turkey to Thailand.
   The commercial, which will be aired in the United States on NBC
during the top-rated ``The Cosby Show,'' also marks the first public
airing of Madonna's new song ``Like a Prayer,'' an unusual forum for
a song's debut.
   Pepsi officials, who previewed the commercial for reporters
Wednesday, said they tried to place the ad on the top-rated evening
show in each country.
   They refused, however, to disclose how much it cost to produce
the ad, to hire Madonna or to buy the advertising time.
   The commercial will appear first in Japan and follow the time
zones around the world before finishing on the West Coast of the
United States.
   The commercial opens with Madonna watching a grainy home movie of
her eighth birthday party, where she gets a new doll and sips on a
bottle of Pepsi.
   As the spot unfolds, the little girl in the movie and the
grown-up pop singer trade places.
   As she sings her new song, Madonna finds herself dancing with a
group of teens on the street, with uniformed school children at a
grade school and finally in a church where a gospel choir sings with
her.
   Those shots are mixed with glimpses of the little girl, played by
8-year-old actress Heidi Marshall, exploring Madonna's apartment,
finding clues to what her life will be like when she gets older.
   When the little girl finds her alter ego still has the doll she
was given on her eighth birthday, she looks back at the screen and
trades places with the singer once again.
   Madonna, back in her chair watching the movie, raises a Pepsi can
and offers a toast to the birthday girl: ``Go ahead, make a wish.''
   Bill Katz, an account executive for Pepsi's advertising agency,
BBDO, said the ad will be edited into 60-second and 30-second
versions for subsequent showings.
   It was directed by Joe Pytka, whose work for Pepsi has included
commercials featuring singer Michael Jackson and actor Michael J.
Fox.
   Pepsi long has used pop singers in trying to create a youthful,
energetic image for the soft drink, which trails only Coca-Cola in
the soft drink market.
   It is breaking ground by launching a singer's new release in its
commercial. With Michael Jackson, Pepsi waited until his songs were
at the peak of their popularity before launching commericals
featuring them.
   Madonna's single of ``Like a Prayer'' is scheduled to be released
Tuesday, followed two weeks later by her new album. A music video
that differs from the ad is slated to debut Friday on MTV: Music
Television, the cable TV music channel.
   Katz said Pepsi is confident that the song will be a hit and said
other performers may decide to launch songs on commercials after
seeing the Pepsi ad.

<HEAD>Shoppers Jam Stores For Sears New Low Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bargain hunters, loyalists and skeptics alike were among the
shoppers who jammed Sears stores nationwide to get their first taste
of the retailer's ``everyday low pricing'' policy.
   ``The customers are filling their shopping bags,'' said Dick
Warner, a Sears, Roebuck and Co. regional merchandise manager who
was at a store in Traverse City, Mich., on Wednesday. ``The store
managers have indicated the traffic they had was better than
Christmas traffic.''
   The nation's largest retailer has switched to more name-brand
merchandise and discount prices to lure shoppers away from cut-rate
competitors like K mart and Wal-Mart, which have grown rapidly.
   The 103-year-old Chicago-based Sears closed its 824 stores for 42
hours Monday through mid-day Wednesday to slap new prices on the
50,000 items of merchandise.
   Eva Mae Dyer of Forest Park, Ga., wasn't sure how significant the
price changes were, but she said her shopping patterns probably
wouldn't change.
   ``I really care a lot for Sears,'' she said. ``We've been trading
with them for 41 years, and I expect to keep shopping here even if
the prices aren't cut that much.''
   Some politicians joined in celebrations. Minnesota Lt. Gov.
Marlene Johnson called Sears a ``good corporate citizen'' as she
helped greet 500 shoppers at a store in St. Paul. In Peoria, Ill.,
Mayor Jim Maloof took part in a ribbon-cutting and told about 100
people who waited in the cold that ``Sears hung in with Peoria
through the bad times'' earlier this decade.
   ``We have shopped at Sears for 57 years,'' said Bruce Boswell of
East Peoria. ``If they come down on their prices, they'll get all
their old customers back.''
   Some people thought the quality of merchandise would go down
along with the price.
   ``I think it might cheapen them a little bit, but they're a grade
higher than K mart,'' said Pam Cage, 31, one of about 3,000 shoppers
who crowded a Sears store in Miami.
   Barbara Palazzolo, spokeswoman for the 2,265-store K mart Corp.,
based in Troy, Mich., said the nation's No. 2 retailer planned no
immediate response to the Sears move. ``We've had everyday low
prices for the past 27 years,'' she said.
   Prices under the new Sears policy may vary among the retailer's
24 regions, but Sears officials were convinced they will win
approval from customers.
   Sears' switch to more uniform pricing, a strategy pioneered by
discount chains and adapted successfully last year by Montgomery
Ward &amp; Co., makes Sears comparable to the discounters in price but
not in looks. Most goods are still shown in decorative displays,
making Sears stores resemble a department store rather than a
stripped-down discount operation.
   A spot check at Chicago outlets of Sears, K mart, Montgomery Ward
and Toys R Us, and a J.C. Penney Co. store in Schaumburg, Ill.,
found Sears with the lowest prices on many items Wednesday.
   A 48-pack of Huggies diapers costs $9.69 at Sears, $9.89 at Toys
R Us and $11.57 at K mart. A pair of men's Levi's 505 blue jeans
cost $17.96 at Sears, $19.99 at K mart and $22.99 at J.C. Penney. A
3-pack of men's Fruit of the Loom underwear cost $4.49 at Montgomery
Ward, $4.96 at Sears and $8.99 at K mart.
   The strategy marks a departure from the traditional retailing
technique of hyping goods with periodic sales. Sears said it will
still have sales, but less than in the past.
   Not all customers were pleased.
   ``Prices seem to be a little lower, but I don't see a heck of a
lot of difference,'' said one woman at the Holyoke, Mass., Sears who
declined to give her name but described herself as a regular Sears
shopper.
   Lynn Carver of Barkhamsted, Conn., said she drove to a West
Hartford Sears store to exchange some sheets and found the price was
about 20 percent higher than the week before.
   Operating Manager Larry Glowa said the sheets had been on sale
last week and were not among the items reduced in price Wednesday.

<HEAD>Government Facing Big Problem At Key Wall Street Trial: Convincing
Jurors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense lawyers have packed a federal courtroom
looking for signs of the future in the GAF Corp. stock manipulation
case, the first jury trial to develop indirectly from the
confessions of insider trader Ivan Boesky.
   They say that conflicting testimony, a discredited witness and
stock-trading complexity has cast doubt on a case, which is seen as
a test of the government's ability to convince juries of Wall Street
crimes.
   ``This is a government stretch,'' said Gerald Lefcourt, a
prominent securities fraud defense attorney. ``It's a case that
probably wouldn't have been brought a few years ago.''
   So far, few signs of government strength in the case have
emerged. A mistrial was declared in January after a prosecutor
withheld evidence, albeit unintentionally. The defense has
challenged the integrity of the star witness. Testimony hasn't
exactly captivated jurors, who often appear confused or bored.
   GAF and its vice chairman, James Sherwin, are charged with
illegally trying to manipulate the stock of Union Carbide Corp. in
October 1986 to maximize profits from the planned sale of a large
block of shares. The indictment also charges securities fraud,
conspiracy and wire fraud.
   The government closed its case Tuesday with a witness
contradicting testimony of brokerage firm founder Boyd L. Jefferies,
an admitted felon who is the government's main source of evidence.
He is expected to testify in other fraud trials as part of a plea
deal with the government.
   ``It clearly cannot help the government's case that its two major
witnesses are testifying inconsistently on what appear to be
important points,'' said Robert Morvillo, another securities fraud
defense attorney.
   The GAF trial is one of the few criminal stock manipulation cases
to reach a jury involving a company traded on the New York Stock
Exchange; the last was the trial of Edward Gilbert, convicted in
1981. He was known as the ``boy wonder'' of Wall Street before
running into trouble in the early 1960s.
   Earlier manipulation cases, prevalent during boom market years in
the 1960s, typically involved lightly traded stock of small
companies. It is far more difficult to alter the price of a stock
that trades in large volume.
   The GAF case is thorny, lawyers said, because it involves just a
few days of trading in Union Carbide rather than a long-term pattern
of manipulation. Also, the stock price was only marginally affected
in the alleged deal and the accused didn't profit.
   Lefcourt said he believes criminal charges in such a case would
be logical ``if somebody is trying to manipulate a stock and makes a
fortune and clearly is doing something to hurt the public investor.
You don't see that here.''
   The prosecution also must show that the defendants conspired to
intentionally manipulate the stock. The combined factors have made
some lawyers wonder why the government made GAF its test case.
   ``The difficult part of this one is you've got one trade and a
swearing match between the different interested parties on what the
purpose was,'' said Peter Romatowski, a former head of the
securities fraud section in the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office.
   ``The purpose is everything _ what was in the people's minds when
the trade was conducted,'' said Romatowski, now a private attorney.
   After the defense moved for dismissal Tuesday, U.S. District
Judge Mary Johnson Lowe said the case posed the problem of
distinguishing between a manipulative trade and one that
legitimately causes a stock price change. But she refused to throw
it out.
   The GAF case also is important because it tests information
supplied by Boesky, the former arbitrager who paid the government
$100 million to settle insider trading charges in late 1986.
   Boesky fingered, among others, Jefferies, who agreed to plead
guilty to two securities law violations, quit his Los Angeles firm
and testify against other alleged criminals. His testimony is
considered critical to separate cases against speculator Salim B.
Lewis and takeover investor Paul Bilzerian.
   The GAF defense, led by attorney Arthur Liman, widely known from
the 1987 Iran-contra hearings, has sought to paint Jefferies as a
felon whose word can't be trusted. James Melton, chief broker at
Jefferies &amp; Co., contradicted Jefferies on several key points,
including whether Sherwin ordered stock manipulation.
   Some lawyers in Boesky-derived cases claim the government is
abusing its discretion by bringing criminal charges instead of civil
ones.
   ``I think you've got a new set of rules by virtue of the deals
the government has made with Boesky, Jefferies and (investment
banker Martin) Siegel, and the government needs to justify those
deals,'' Morvillo said.

   The U.S. dollar was stable in European trading
early today, while the market waited to see whether West Germany's
central bank would raise interest rates.
   Gold was down.
   The market appeared split over the chances that West Germany
would raise its discount rate. ``I see the market 50-50 divided over
the change they will move,'' said a trader in Milan, Italy.
   The pound fell in London to $1.7200 from $1.7243 late Wednesday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.39 Japanese yen to a closing 128.07 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 128.12 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Wednesday's
rates, included: 1.8370 West German marks, down from 1.8390; 1.5700
Swiss francs, down from 1.5705; 6.2550 French francs, down from
6.2575; 2.0725 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0755; 1,355.00 Italian

   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $384.05 a troy ounce,
down from $384.25 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning Wednesday, the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$384.10.
   In Zurich, gold was trading at $384.10 at noon, matching late
Wednesday's price.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.37 an ounce to close at a bid
$385.89.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a bid price of $5.76 a troy
ounce, down from $5.79 late Wednesday.

<HEAD>More Filing Early this Year, But Number Still Low</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Less than 30 percent of taxpayers have filed
their returns halfway into the filing season, but the pace is still
ahead of last year's.
   The Internal Revenue Service said Wednesday that through Feb. 24,
it had received 30.8 million returns, up 2 percent over the
comparable period of 1988, when 30.2 million were received.
   The number of taxpayers filing the long Form 1040 _ most of whom
itemize deductions _ dropped 4.2 percent, the IRS said. But the
number filing the ``short'' Form 1040A and the one-page 1040EZ rose
7.5 percent and 6.8 percent. This year's figures include 13.1
million long forms, 8.5 million Form 1040A and 9.1 million Form
1040EZ.
   The IRS read the figures as suggesting ``that many taxpayers who
filed Form 1040 in the past may be switching to the simpler, shorter
forms.''
   The reason is that the 1986 tax overhaul raised the standard
deductions and took away or reduced several important deductions,
making it no longer profitable for these taxpayers to itemize.
   Deductions for two-earner couples and for state sales taxes were
wiped out by the new law, which watered down the deductions for
consumer interest and for medical expenses. The law eliminated the
Individual Retirement Account deduction for millions of taxpayers
and reduced it for many others.
   At this time last year, 45.4 percent of returns were on the long
form. This year, the long form accounts for 42 percent.
   However, those taxpayers with simpler tax situations normally
file earlier in the season, while those with more complicated
returns procrastinate. It is not clear whether a long-range result
of the 1986 tax changes will be to sharply reduce the number filing
long forms.
   Through last weekend, the IRS had processed almost half the
returns it had received and and had approved refund checks for
almost 8.3 million taxpayers, up 9 percent from last year. The
refunds totaled $6.8 billion, an increase of almost 14 percent, and
averaged $825, up from $793 at this time last year.
   Taxpayers are expected to file 109 million individual returns
this year, up from 107 million last year. The filing deadline is
April 17.
   Despite widespread publicity about the IRS's giving wrong replies
one-third of the time, the agency had received 14.3 million calls to
its toll-free answer line through last week. Still, that is down
from 15.7 million for the comparable period a year ago.
   The agency reported a big increase in the number of taxpayers
using the toll-free ``Tele-Tax'' system. The system recorded 5.4
million calls through last week, up from 2 million a year ago.
   Tele-Tax offers tape-recorded generalized advice on more than 140
tax topics. Telephone numbers to reach the system are printed in the
tax packages mailed to most taxpayers by the IRS.

<HEAD>Americans Want More Control Over Water, Survey Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of the Northeast and Midwest are more
confident of their drinking water's quality than Southerners and
Westerners, a survey shows.
   Seventy percent of Northeastern residents and 71 percent of
Midwestern residents felt their drinking water was free of harmful
contamination, according to a survey released Wednesday by the Water
Quality Association.
   Sixty-one percent of Southerners and 66 percent of Westerners
felt that way, the survey showed.
   Maribeth Robb, the association's director of communications, said
one reason for less concern over drinking water in the Northeast and
Midwest may be because of ``an abundance of water'' in those areas.
   ``We would probably tend to think less about conservation and
water problems,'' she said.
   The group, based in Lisle, Ill., said 1,000 people were polled in
the random telephone survey conducted by an independent research
firm in late January and early February. Ms. Robb said she did not
know the margin of error.
   Nationally, 79 percent of those questioned thought drinking water
in their homes was acceptable, and 20 percent said it was
unacceptable. One percent said they didn't know.
   Eighty-seven percent of those questioned said taste was the key
factor in the way they judge water quality. Appearance and odor also
counted heavily.
   The survey also indicated most Americans want more personal
control over the water quality in their homes.
   Of those questioned, 51 percent said they had little or no
control over the quality, and more than 90 percent said they want to
have more control.
   Although the survey indicated most people are confident about the
quality of their home drinking water, 61 percent said they would
feel more confident if they had a water treatment system.
   The trade association provides research, educational support and
representation to more than 2,400 manufacturers and dealers of water
quality improvement technology.
   The survey was released at the opening of an association
convention in Atlanta.

   Share prices rebounded sharply in Tokyo today after
a three-day plunge, and the U.S. dollar gained against the Japanese
yen for the third consecutive day.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selcted issues, which had lost
more than 480 points over three days, gained 109.43 points, or 0.34
percent, and closed at 32,073.73. The Nikkei closed higher despite a
decline in morning trading.
   Kenji Ishizuka of Daiwa Securities said the index started upward
when investors started buying construction issues.
   ``The market seemed to have recovered from its nervousness ahead
of the West German banks' meeting later Thursday,'' he said.
   Securities and currency markets have been cautious, watching to
see whether West German banks would raise interest rates following
the U.S. discount rate hike last week. The U.S. Federal Reserve
Board raised its discount rate, its charge for loans to private
banks, from 6.5 percent to 7.0 percent.
   Trading was moderate, with first section volume estimated at 800
million shares.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 128.07 yen, up 0.39
yen from Wednesday's 127.68-yen close. It opened at 127.93 yen and
ranged between 127.90 and 128.50 yen.
   The dollar now has gained 2.07 yen in the last three days.
   The U.S. currency's higher opening in Tokyo followed its upward
trend on overseas markets overnight, dealers said.
   Japanese investors were more interested in buying the West German
mark because of speculation that West German banks might raise their
interest rates, said a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   ``If West Germany does not raise rates, the dollar will probably
rise because those who were reluctant to hold many dollars today
will go back to the U.S. money,'' he added.

<HEAD>Arizona Company Allegedly Bilked Bay Staters Out of $100,000</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts residents were allegedly bilked out
of $100,000 by an Arizona company promoting a billion dollar
``Sunplex'' amusement park that never saw as much as a building
permit.
   The state Securities Division filed an administrative complaint
Wednesday against International Diversified Investment Corp. of
Arizona and two of its principals, James and Denise Tiberio, for
selling unregistered stocks and investments to people in
Massachusetts.
   In 1985, the Tiberios contacted about a dozen Massachusetts
residents through a mutual friend and sought investments for ``The
Sunplex,'' a proposed amusement park, Secretary of State Michael
Connolly said.
   The complex was proposed for Eloy, Ariz., but the Tiberios never
got so much as a building permit, officials said.
   The investment company and the Tiberios also are under
investigation by securities officials in Arizona.
   The case took years to get under way because the couple had
disappeared for an extended period, after living lavishly in a
mansion with a Rolls Royce and guard dogs in Phoenix. They now live
in a residence without a telephone in Fountain Hills, Ariz.,
according to Pamela Merchant, an enforcement attorney with the
Massachusetts securities division.
   Investors in the amusement park were promised profits as big as
the proposed park. For every dollar invested, the Tiberios allegedly
promised, investors would receive $50 in profit.
   The couple estimated that one of three tourists visiting Arizona
would come to the park, enabling it to turn a billion dollar profit
within three years.
   ``They flew these people down to Arizona to wine them and dine
them,'' Merchant said. ``Apparently it was very fancy wining and
dining.''
   Investors who lose in such scams have a chance of getting some of
their money back, but in this case it's a slim chance, she said.
   ``They don't seem to have any money so it's unlikely,'' Merchant
said.
   Among other things, the amusement park was to boast the world's
largest sun dial, which the Tiberios promised would land Sunplex in
the Guinness Book of World Records.
   It also was to have a bullet train called the ``Sun Streak''
linking the desert park to California and Nevada. Visitors would
stay in air-conditioned comfort at a ``Palace of the Sun'' hotel.
   According to Merchant, the Tiberios had no particular occupation
before getting involved with the investment deal. After gathering
possibly as much as a half million dollars from investors in
Massachusetts, Arizona and Texas, Merchant said the Tiberios
traveled to Europe in January 1986, where an associate promised to
invest the money in foreign currencies.
   The investor promptly lost the Tiberios' money, Merchant said.
   When the couple called some of their investors and asked for more
money, at least one Massachusetts investor came up with $30,000,
Merchant said.

<HEAD>Coke and Pepsi Taste Tests Are All Fizz, Regulator Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While the heated advertising war between Diet Coke
and Diet Pepsi is being fought with celebrities such as Madonna,
Michael Jackson and Don Johnson, Massachusetts regulators say the
companies' claims last summer to win consumer taste tests were made
without substantiation.
   In the ads last summer, Pepsi said it was ``undisputed champion''
and ``decisively beat Diet Coke'' in taste tests, while Diet Coke
said it was ``winner and still champion'' after beating Pepsi four
times in four years.
   Paula W. Gold, state secretary of consumer affairs and business
regulation, said Wednesday that both companies' tests were skewed by
improper sampling techniques and ``did not fairly represent a random
sample of cities across the nation.''
   Coke and Pepsi have been competing intensely for the lucrative
diet soft drink market, which is growing at an annual rate of 8.4
percent, more than twice as fast as sales of soda as a whole.
   During 1988, Diet Coke had 8.2 percent of the $43 billion soft
drink market, while Diet Pepsi had 5.2 percent, according to Jesse
Meyers, publisher of Beverage Digest in Greenwich, Conn.
   Gold, an aggressive regulator who has previously ordered
investigations into auto salesmen and bank fees, said she decided to
check on Coke and Pepsi because of the obvious contradiction between
their high-profile ads. Both companies discontinued the ads at the
end of the summer.
   Although Coca-Cola is based in Atlanta, and Pepsi's headquarters
are in Purchase, N.Y., Gold said they have operations in
Massachusetts and their advertising has an effect here.
   ``I think if suspect advertising practices are allowed to go
unchecked, then advertisers come down to the lowest common
denominator,'' she said. ``You've got to look at and enforce the big
players as well as the little ones.''
   Spokesmen for both Coke and Pepsi disputed the Massachusetts
regulator's findings.
   ``This type of test has been upheld in the past by the courts,
certainly by the television networks, and also by the National
Advertisers Bureau,'' said Tod MacKenzie, a spokesman at Pepsi's
headquarters. ``This quite frankly seems to be a case in which the
state has stepped into an area that's new to it, and I think that
shows in their report.''
   Gold said she requested detailed information from the soft drink
companies in July and gave it to an independent evaluator, Frederick
Wiseman, a professor of marketing and statistics at Northeastern
University in Boston.
   Wiseman said Wednesday that Coke gave taste tests to 999 people
in 10 Eastern cities. Pepsi's test sample was 1,000 people in four
cities _ Seattle, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Indianapolis.
   ``Taste test research does not have to be as exact as a political
poll, where you're really aiming for a national projection,''
Wiseman said.
   ``But this is a case where the samples were just too far off. You
had Coke basically ignoring one half of the country, and Pepsi
picking just four cities, all within 100 miles of a processing
plant.''
   Wiseman said he found no evidence that either company
deliberately rigged its samples to achieve a certain result. Rather,
he said, ``it appears they were just trying to get it done quickly.''
   Gold said that after the ads had aired, Coke expanded its sample
to 27 cities across the country. If Coke had done the broader
testing before the ads ran, she said, it would have been adequate
substantiation.
   ``But doing it after the fact still doesn't make it right,'' she
said.

<HEAD>London Shares Slightly Higher At Midday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices were slightly higher on London's Stock
Exchange at midday Thursday after trading in a narrow range
throughout the morning on continuing nervousness about future rises
in British and world interest rates.
   The West German Bundesbank left its key rates unchanged after its
fortnightly council meeting Thursday, easing earlier fears that
British rates would have to rise simply to keep pace with a West
German rate hike.
   But more signs of sterling weakness and the generally pessimistic
analysis of Wednesday's British trade figures combined to create
some nervousness about the long-term outlook for British interest
rates.
   Players were still considering the conflicting signals on the
likely trend in British rates, dealers said. Institutional investors
are likely to remain on the sidelines until the picture becomes
clear, they added.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 1
point, or 0.05 percent, at 2,022.3 at about 1:15 p.m., about halfway
between the day's high of 2,025.2 and the low of 2,017.6.
   Volume was a moderate 285.7 million shares compared with 341.6
million shares at the same time Wednesday.

<HEAD>EPA Sues Brewery For Polluting Sewers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELLEVILLE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
has filed a lawsuit against the G. Heileman Brewing Co. for
allegedly polluting sewers in this Southern Illinois city for nine
years.
   The lawsuit accused Heileman's Stag Brewery plant of repeatedly
discharging wastes without adequate treatment into Belleville's
wastewater treatment system.
   The lawsuit, filed Feb. 9 in U.S. District Court in Alton,
charges that ``the brewery repeatedly discharged wastes containing
high concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand and total suspended
solids.''
   The Wisconsin-based company faces up to $37 million in fines if
found guilty, said Anne Weinert, an EPA environmental engineer.
Heileman officials could not be reached for comment.
   The EPA filed a lawsuit Nov. 22 in federal court alleging
Belleville had violated pollution discharge limits since April 1985.
EPA and city officials have been negotiating a fine but have not
reached a settlement.
   Ms. Weinert said Wednesday the agency now believes pollutants
discharged from the brewery are what caused the city to violate the
Federal Clean Water Act.
   ``We believe that Stag Brewery is one of the major reasons for
the (city's) violations,'' Ms. Weinert said.
   Mayor Richard Brauer said he believed the lawsuit against the
brewery could cause the EPA to lower the city's fine, which could
have been as much as $125,000.
   ``This would be part of our negotiations,'' Brauer said.
   Since Stag closed last August, the city has been in compliance
with the Clean Water Act, Brauer said.
   From the time Stag began operating in 1979, city officials worked
to help the brewery comply with EPA regulations, Brauer said.
   ``We were aware of the problem and we were working with the
brewery,'' he said. ``We proposed a couple of plans to the Illinois
EPA and one was accepted, but by the time (IEPA) accepted the plan,
Heileman decided not to go through with it.''
   The city offered to build a $2.9 million pretreatment plant for
the brewery, which would have brought it into compliance with EPA
regulations, Brauer said. Heileman would have had to repay the city.
   Heileman rejected the offer and decided to close the brewery
instead. The plant officially closed its doors in August, causing
the loss of about 230 jobs.
   Despite the sewage problems and lawsuits, Brauer said he would
prefer to see the brewery open again.
   Brewery officials have said the only thing that could keep the
Stag Brewery open was to sell 10 million more barrels of beer each
year. The brewery, which had the capacity to brew 25.3 million
barrels each year, shipped only 16.25 million barrels in 1987.

<HEAD>NLRB Issues Complaint Against Morrell For Plant Reopenings: Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A National Labor Relations Board complaint against
meatpacker John Morrell &amp; Co. recommends reinstatement and back pay
for workers at plants which were closed, then re-opened with lower
wage scales, a union says.
   The NLRB office here issued a complaint Wednesday saying Morrell
``fraudulently concealed'' an ``unlawful scheme'' to circumvent its
master agreement with the union, the United Food &amp; Commercial
Workers said.
   The union said the NLRB complaint also cites discrimination
against workers because of their union activities.
   Back pay and job reinstatement for affected employees from the
plants in Kansas and Tennessee are among the ``sweeping and
breathtaking'' recommendations of the NLRB complaint, said Phillip
L. Immesote, director of the union's 85,000-member packinghouse
division.
   The union said the company could be responsible for $100 million
or more in back pay.
   Officials of the union in Washington and the NLRB office in
Chicago were not available late Wednesday.
   In June 1982, Morrell closed the former Rodeo Meats Inc. plant in
Arkansas City, Kan., where nearly 750 UFCW members worked at a base
wage of $11.07 an hour, the union said.
   The plant reopened in March 1983 under the name Ark City Packing
Co., with 200 workers paid $5 an hour, the union said. The plant now
employs more than 500 workers, represented by Local 340 of the
union, at a base rate of $7.60 an hour, according to the union.
   Morrell also closed a plant in Memphis, Tenn., in July 1982,
which had employed about 400 members of the union's Local 242 at a
base wage of $10.69 an hour, according to the union.
   When the plant reopened under the name Memphis Packing Co. in
September 1983, it employed 250 workers at a base wage of $5.50 an
hour. When it closed again in June 1986, it employed 300 workers at
a base wage of $8.50 an hour, the UFCW said. The plant has not
reopened.
   The NLRB says a majority of the rehired workers were former
employees, but the company refused to rehire certain workers because
of their union activities, the union said.
   David Parker, an NLRB spokesman in Washington, was not familiar
with details of the Morrell case, but said such complaints are often
a first step in cases that can be appealed to an administrative law
judge, the five-member NLRB or federal courts.
   A message left with an operator at Morrell's Cincinnati
headquarters after business hours Wednesday was not immediately
returned.
   ``This process can take a long time unless the parties reach a
settlement,'' Parker said. ``It can take several years.''
   The union claims to have a company document which spells out
strategy to break the master agreement and the union.
   If the company, a subsidiary of United Brands Co., does not fight
the complaint, it must reinstate all employees laid off in 1982 at
the Arkansas City and Memphis plants or find them ``substantially
equivalent positions,'' the union said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush still is weighing whether to
step in and avert an impending strike against Eastern Airlines, the
White House said today.
   Presidential Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater suggested the
decision may not come before Friday, when Bush plans to meet with
top advisers on the situation.
   The International Association of Machinists is set to strike
Eastern at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday.
   A federal judge was considering a motion today to allow the
machinists union to picket five other major airlines _ Northwest,
USAir, United, Piedmont, and Trans World _ in the event of a strike.
   The union also has said it plans pickets at rail, sea and other
transportation companies, along with sister airline Continental and
Texas Air Corp., parent firm of Eastern and Continental.
   Federal mediators have urged Bush to stop the strike, which the
machinists say could disrupt air, rail and sea transportation
nationwide.
   Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and labor leaders have also
urged the president to use his presidential powers to declare a
national transportation emergency, postponing any strike for 60 days
while a special panel investigates.
   Jackson, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination last
year, met with Bush at the White House on Wednesday night,
presumably to discuss the Eastern situation. However, Fitzwater said
he did not know what the two discussed in the private session.
   As to stopping the strike for 60 days, ``No decision has been
made,'' Fitzwater said today.
   Earlier, he said Bush would make his decision on whether to step
in before the midnight Friday deadline, which marks the end of a
30-day cooling-off period after failure of the National Mediation
Board's yearlong efforts to resolve the dispute.
   Eastern, which says it is losing about $1 million a day, wants to
cut salaries to save $150 million. The International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents 8,500 Eastern
baggage handlers and other ground services workers, wants $50
million in salary increases.
   Eastern opposes presidential intervention, which would also delay
for 60 days the airline's power to make salary cuts. The union wants
Bush to act.
   The recommendation last week from the two-member board that Bush
call an emergency panel had been received by the White House, but
the president had not yet gotten the benefit of a staff
recommendation, spokesman Stephen Hart said Wednesday.
   Bush was in Asia when the board, which mediates labor disputes
involving railways and airlines, proposed presidential action.
   The mediation board has the power to call for a presidential
emergency panel when it believes ``a sector of the country could be
or is being deprived of essential transportation services.''
   Under the law, Bush would appoint three members to the panel to
examine the matter and make a report within 30 days.
   The board has made several requests for emergency panels in
railway labor disputes in recent years but none involving an airline
since one that averted a threatened Pan American World Airways
strike in 1966. Congress ordered a special panel in a Wein-Alaskan
Air dispute in 1978, however.
   Joseph Guerrieri, union attorney, filed the motion in federal
court Wednesday to get a ruling allowing the union to picket other
airlines with which it has contracts.
   The airlines argue that ``no strike'' language in their contracts
forbids such action. The union, said Guerrieri, maintains that a
1987 Supreme Court ruling allowing secondary picketing under the
Railway Labor Act precludes the no-strike provision.
   AFL-CIO leaders have vowed to do everything legally possible to
help the union ground Eastern, Continental and Texas Air in the
event of a strike.
   Eastern's pilots have said they would decide after a strike is
called whether to cross picket lines. Texas Air chairman Frank
Lorenzo made a personal appeal to the pilots Wednesday to sign a new
contract and continue working. The pilots have separate negotiations
with the airline.
   Eastern says it cannot afford further delay before cutting costs.
   The union accuses the airline of planning to transfer its
operations to non-union Continental. Texas Air is awaiting final
government approval to sell off Eastern's money-making East Coast
shuttle operations to New York real estate magnate Donald Trump.

   A judge has approved a $29.9 million settlement of
27 lawsuits tied to a 1984 oil refinery explosion that killed 17
people and injured 10 others.
   Unocal Oil Co., owner of the Romeoville refinery south of
Chicago, and nine other companies were sued for negligence by the
families of those killed and injured in the explosion, attorney
Bruce R. Pfaff said.
   Pfaff, who represents six plaintiffs, said the case was about two
years from trial, prompting all sides to reach an agreement.
   Cook County Judge Donald P. O'Connell on Wednesday approved the
settlement after months of pre-trial conferences and negotiations
that at one time involved more than 50 law firms representing the
plaintiffs, Unocal and other companies.
   Lloyd Williams, who represented Unocal and the other companies in
negotiations, said the companies' individual contributions to the
settlement were confidential.
   The explosion occurred July 23, 1984, in a 55-foot vessel
containing liquid hydrocarbons, byproducts of the refining process,
Pfaff said.
   An investigation later determined that the vessel exploded when
internal cracks in the inch-thick steel broke through the outer
skin, Pfaff said.
   The lawsuits against Unocal and companies involved in the
vessel's design, construction and maintenance contended that Unocal
inspectors failed to properly test the vessel's walls for stress.
The lawsuits also said repairs made to the vessel by welders made it
too brittle to withstand inside pressure.
   Pfaff said the settlement did not require Unocal or the other
companies to admit fault.
   After about $100 million in repairs, the refinery reopened 16
months after the explosion.

<HEAD>Edelman Lifts Storehouse Stake To 7 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Storehouse PLC said Thursday that American takeover
strategist Asher B. Edelman has raised his stake in the British
retailing group to 7 percent from 6.1 percent.
   Edelman notified Storehouse that he increased his holdings Friday
to 28.8 million shares, continuing the slow stakebuilding begun late
last year, the company said.
   Storehouse first discovered Edelman on its share register Dec. 6,
when it believed the holding amounted to 20 million shares, or 4.9
percent.
   Edelman later wrote the company saying he would like Storehouse
to undergo a restructuring or management buyout as a means of
improving shareholder value. His request to meet with the company to
discuss his plans was turned down.
   A Storehouse spokesman, who wasn't identified, in accordance with
British custom, said Thursday the company's contact with Edelman has
been limited to the formal notifications concerning his minority
stake.
   The company last month announced a string of measures to contain
costs, generate cash and improve operating efficiency to combat poor
trading prospects in the British retail sector.
   Storehouse, which is chaired by Sir Terence Conran, operates
about 980 stores in Britain, Europe and the United States under a
variety of names including Conran's, Habitat and Mothercare.

<HEAD>Jaguar Workers Reject Company's Latest Pay Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers at Jaguar PLC, the British luxury car
maker, narrowly rejected the company's final pay offer and have
scheduled an overtime ban starting this weekend and weekly one-day
strikes after Monday.
   The final tally showed 3,700 workers rejecting the offer and
3,682 accepting it, a Jaguar spokesman, who wasn't identified, in
accordance with British custom, said Thursday.
   The result was decided by the votes cast late Wednesday by 800
night-shift workers.
   The spokesman said Jaguar would appeal the outcome, which was
based on votes cast at open meetings, and would ask the union to
stage a secret ballot.
   Those voting against the contract offer represented only 42
percent of eligible voters, and the company hopes a secret vote
would increase the voter turnout.
   ``We would like a secret ballot to sort this out,'' the Jaguar
spokesman said. ``This vote is not a sufficient mandate for damaging
industrial action.''
   In negotiations last weekend Jaguar made what it said was its
final offer, a two-year deal including raises of 4.7 percent in the
first year and 4.4 percent in the second, plus bonuses.
   Jaguar said its workers earn an average 210 pounds, or the
equivalent of $361, per week.

   A threatened strike by Eastern Airlines' Machinists
this weekend has sent travelers scrambling for other carriers, and
Eastern warned a sympathy walkout by pilots could bury the company
``in the corporate graveyard.''
   Ticket agents reported a surge in sales at Eastern competitors as
a strike appeared increasingly likely at the Miami-based airline,
which carries an average of 100,000 passengers a day and says it is
losing $1 million daily.
   Eastern wants to cut salaries to save $150 million. The
Machinists union, representing 8,500 Eastern baggage handlers and
other ground services workers, wants $50 million in salary increases.
   Company Chairman Frank Lorenzo, in a videotape sent Wednesday to
the pilots union, warned that ``if the pilots and other employees
support the (machinists') picket line and don't show up for work,
Eastern cannot survive.''
   ``I'm afraid Eastern is going to go through this juncture and
perhaps end up in the corporate graveyard,'' said Lorenzo, the
chairman of Texas Air, Eastern's parent company.
   Eastern's rivals also have been mapping strategy to keep
operating in the event of a secondary boycott by the Machinists
union, which has asked a federal court judge in Washington to allow
its members to picket other airlines, ships and other modes of
transportation.
   While most airlines aren't commenting on contingency plans in the
event of an industry-wide strike, some of Eastern's fiercest
competitors are moving to cash in on the passenger spillover.
   Pan American Corp., which vies with Eastern in the lucrative East
Coast shuttle routes, already has said it would double its flights
linking New York to Boston and Washington during a strike.
   And Delta said it can handle Eastern's surplus to Florida and
Puerto Rico without putting more planes in the air.
   Non-union Continental Airlines, also owned by Texas Air, has
downplayed the effect of a strike at Eastern despite vows by
Machinists union members to close it down as well.
   ``We are two totally separate carriers,'' said Continental
spokesman Ned Walker in Houston. ``We do not expect any impact at
Continental from the Eastern situation. ... There will be no service
disruption whatsoever.''
   Eastern says it is doomed unless its pilots continue flying
during a strike, set to begin at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday unless an
agreement is reached in the machinists' 17-month-old contract
dispute.
   Lorenzo's videotaped message offered pilots sweeter pay raises
and job security, but leaders of the pilots and flight attendants
unions have urged members to honor picket lines.
   Lorenzo, who bought Eastern in 1986, earned a union-busting
reputation when he broke labor contracts with Continental's workers
after taking that airline into bankruptcy reorganization in 1983.
   The 3,500-member pilots union said the new offer does not
guarantee job security, contains $64 million in pilot concessions
and would require the union to drop lawsuits and grievances worth
$250 million.
   ``In his videotape, Mr. Lorenzo made a fine theatrical
performance,'' the pilots executive council said in a statement to
its members. ``Don't be misled. Much work still needs to be done.''
   The Machinists also appealed for solidarity in the days before
the strike.
   ``We would hope the pilots would remember that Lorenzo has made
agreements before and contracts mean nothing to him. He's not to be
trusted,'' said Frank Ortis, vice president of the Machinists Miami
local.
   The White House, meanwhile, is giving no hint of whether
President Bush will meet the request of federal mediators and stop a
strike. White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush will
make his decision on whether to step in before the midnight Friday
deadline.
   As to a proposal to stop the strike for 60 days, ``No decision
has been made,'' Fitzwater said today.
   Eastern ran full-page advertisements in some newspapers today,
quoting editorials across the country that urge Bush not to call in
federal mediators.
   Eastern has promised passengers full refunds or seats on other
airlines at no extra cost if flights are canceled, but several
competitors remain wary of accepting tickets a bankrupt Eastern
might not be able to pay for.

   Allegheny International Inc. said today that
Thomas J. Albani, chief operating officer and executive vice
president, resigned Wednesday following an agreement to be acquired
by investors led by Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc.
   ``It's only proper that the prospective new owners should be able
to select their managers,'' said Albani, 46, who joined the company
in 1984 as president of its Sunbeam North American Appliance Group.
   ``Mr. Albani has served AI with distinction,'' said Chairman
Oliver S. Travers.
   The takeover, for which a definitive agreement was signed
Wednesday, calls for the executive committee of the board to operate
the company until the acquisition is completed. James D. Milligan, a
long-time associate of DLJ, will serve as special adviser to the
committee.
   An acquisition company formed by DLJ plans to acquire 62 percent
of the financially troubled Pittsburgh company for an investment of
$60 million. Shareholders would be left with 38 percent of the
company, if a bankruptcy judge approves the plan.

   Grain and soybean futures prices turned mixed
after opening slightly lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
possibly indicating the markets' attention was turning from weather
concerns to export activity.
   The opening decline extended the sharp sell-off that ended
Wednesday's session. Analysts said the selling was prompted in part
by reports of beneficial rain in the soybean fields of Argentina,
the world's third-largest soybean producer.
   But the selling eased shortly after the opening on reports of
higher cash prices for soybeans and talk of Soviet interest in
purchasing U.S. corn.
   Export activity has been on the rise lately, with the Agriculture
Department targeting both China and Iraq for large sales of U.S.
wheat at subsidized prices.
   The wave of early buying may also reflect attitudes that
Wednesday's sharp decline in soybean prices was unwarranted.
   In early trading, wheat was 1\ cents to 1{ cents lower with the

<TEXT>
   Six U.S. Shoe Corp. shareholders have sued the
company in an effort to block the planned sale of its footwear
division to an investor group for $422.5 million.
   The shareholders filed the lawsuit Wednesday in Hamilton County
Common Pleas Court alleging U.S. Shoe Chairman Philip Barach and the
company's directors breached their fiduciary duty to shareholders by
agreeing to sell the division.
   The shareholders claim U.S. Shoe officials should have done more
to increase the company's value for its shareholders.
   A U.S. Shoe representative declined comment on the suit.
   U.S. Shoe announced this week it was selling its footwear unit to
a group led by Merrill Lynch Capital Partners.
   The planned sale stemmed from a six-month search by another
Merrill Lynch affiliate to find a buyer for all or part of U.S.
Shoe, a $2.2 billion Cincinnai-based company which includes women's
clothing stores such as Casual Corner and the LensCrafters optical
stores.
   Wall Street had expected the entire company to be sold and was
disappointed in the announcement. Some analysts had predicted sale
of U.S. Shoe's individual businesses could be worth more than $30 a
share.
   Jerry Fuss, a New York stockbroker, was one of the six
shareholders filing the suit. It accuses U.S. Shoe directors of
trying to perpetuate their control of the company, rather than
carrying out their duties to shareholders to get maximum value for
the company.
   Fuss said he bought 200 shares of U.S. Shoe on Friday at $25.12{
expecting the entire company to be sold.
   Wednesday the stock closed in New York Stock Exchange trading at
$18.87{, representing a paper loss of $1,250. In early trading
today, U.S. Shoe was was up slightly at $19.37{ a share.
   Fuss said he bought the shares on expectations the company would
announce the sale of the whole business.

   Credit-card processor Visa U.S.A. has agreed to an
electronic link-up with Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s Discover card that
could lead to greater acceptance of Discover by merchants, a Sears
spokesman said today.
   The arrangement will enable merchants to run Discover cards
through their existing Visa processing machines, sparing them the
hassle of installing separate Discover authorization and computer
terminals, a Sears division spokesman said.
   ``Now a merchant who accepts Visa can just take Discover card
(sign) and stick it in his window and clear the Discover card
through the equipment he already has there,'' said James Flynn, a
spokesman for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., the Sears division with
responsibility for Discover.
   Sears said the electronic link will be established later this
year.
   Flynn said Visa, the nation's largest credit-card organization,
already has such an arrangement with No. 2 MasterCard.
   The 3-year-old Discover card posted a fourth-quarter profit of
$6.7 million. Sears said it had not expected the card to show a
profit until its fourth year.
   The Discover card is accepted by 900,000 merchants. Visa and
MasterCard both say their cards are accepted by more than 6 million
merchants.
   Discover claims to have 27 million cardholders compared with more
than 108 million for Visa and more than 81 million for MasterCard.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Federico Pena says he will consider yet
another referendum on Denver's proposed $3 billion airport.
   ``There are arguments pro and con, and I'm trying to weigh those
arguments,'' he told the City Council and Chamber of Commerce on
Wednesday.
   The airport, which would be the first such major project in the
nation since the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport opened in 1974, survived
an election in May when Adams County voters agreed to annexation of
land outside Denver for the project.
   Pena and others contend the airport, scheduled for a July
groundbreaking, will ease a projected air transportation crush and
boost Colorado's economy. Stapleton International Airport is flawed
in design and too small, they say.
   But opponents have called the project a waste of money engineered
by ``fat cats'' and would rather see Stapleton expanded. City
Councilmen Ted Hackworth and Bob Crider are seeking to put an
airport question on the ballot.
   ``I just think we've got to make a decision _ pick a course we're
going to commit ourselves to, and then just stick to it,'' Pena said
Wednesday.
   On Sunday, the mayor had said a referendum isn't needed because
the airport won't be financed with local tax dollars.
   The city is asking for $500 million from the federal government,
with the rest of the money coming from revenue bonds, the sale of
land at Stapleton and revenue from the old airport, such as
concessions, fuel taxes and landing fees.

<HEAD>MCorp Creditors Form Committee To Work On Restructuring Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of MCorp creditors, including New York
investment banker Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., has formed a
committee and started work on its own restructuring plan for the
troubled Dallas holding company, The Dallas Morning News reported
today.
   The newspaper cited sources as saying the committee has met with
MCorp managers and federal regulators with a goal of submitting a
plan to rescue the company.
   The group also includes another investment firm based in New
York, Kleinwort Benson Inc., the newspaper said.
   Shearson confirmed Wednesday the investment firm had joined with
other MCorp creditors in an informal group.
   Shearson has much to lose if MCorp cannot successfully
reorganize. The investment firm holds $147 million of MCorp
securities and suffered losses of more than $110 million in 1988
from recognizing the plummeting value of those holdings.
   Any recovery of those losses likely depends on MCorp's ability to
emerge as a going concern, The Morning News said.
   Shearson is said to have also taken a leading role in helping to
convince other MCorp creditors to not force the company _ which has
skipped bond payments _ into bankruptcy.
   A group holding bonds from National Bancshares Corp. of San
Antonio has threatened to force the company into bankruptcy if it
does not resume interest payments this week.
   And the trustee for bondholders of Texas American Bancshares Inc.
of Fort Worth has filed suit against that company _ also demanding
overdue bond payments. The federal suit was filed in December in
Fort Worth by the Bank of New York on behalf of bondholders, Texas
American said Wednesday.
   Texas American said it is contesting the suit, charging that the
bondholders want preferential treatment in the company's
restructuring effort.
   Federal regulators continue to negotiate with Minnesota banker
Carl Pohlad, who has tentatively agreed to buy both Texas American
and National Bancshares.
   Meanwhile, hope has faded that MCorp can win government approval
for the company's own proposal to bail out its 25 subsidiary banks.
Last fall, MCorp chairman Gene H. Bishop said the firm could raise
$400 million in new capital, which it wanted to combine with Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. assistance.
   Analysts have estimated MCorp would need at least $1 billion in
government aid.
   Soon after Bishop's announcement last October, Shearson publicly
supported the company's effort.
   But Bishop has made little apparent progress gaining FDIC
approval for his plan. The FDIC last week said it would continue to
solicit bids for MCorp from other parties until April 3.

   Cadbury Schweppes PLC, the British soft drinks and
confectionery group, said Thursday its 1988 after-tax profit jumped
28.5 percent over a year ago, helped by strong growth in Britain as
well as Australia and neighboring countries.
   The company said after-tax profit in the 12 months ended Dec. 31
totaled 140.5 million pounds, the equivalent of $242 million,
compared with 109.3 million pounds the year before.
   Earnings per share rose to 23.47 pence, or 40 cents, from 19.05
pence, helped by a change in the company's tax accounting.
   Sales rose 17.2 percent to 2.38 billion pounds, or $4.1 billion,
from 2.03 billion pounds.
   The company reported an extraordinary gain of 28.4 million
pounds, chiefly because it sold half of its 34.4 percent stake in Dr
Pepper for $108 million in cash and securities. The sale came when
the U.S. soft-drink concern merged with Seven-Up last year.
   Cadbury Schweppes retains an 18.4 percent stake in what is now
called Dr Pepper-Seven-Up Companies Inc.
   The company didn't break out quarterly results. It isn't required
to under British law.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson, blaming ``buccaneer bankers''
for the savings and loan crisis, backed a liberal coalition's
proposal Thursday to require institutions to commit money for
low-and moderate-income housing as a concession for an S&amp;L bailout.
   The plan also would include an increase in the top federal income
tax rate and fees charged to financial institutions to pay for the
multibillion-dollar shoring up of the savings and loan industry.
   ``We applaud President Bush for addressing the crisis rather than
simply ignoring it as his predecessor did,'' Jackson said. ``But we
believe his plan to bail out buccaneer bankers is not adequate.''
   Jackson's Rainbow Coalition organization was one of about 100
groups, including unions, citizens' groups, churches and political
groups who are supporting an effort called the Financial Democracy
Campaign to promote an alternative to the administration's plan.
   The coalition's plan would establish a national housing finance
administration, financed by banks, savings and loans and other
financial institutions, providing below-market interest rates on
loans to first-time homebuyers and to developers of low- and
moderate-income housing.
   The plan would pay for the bailout of the troubled thrift
industry through contributions assessed on the financial industry,
including on money market funds and brokerage firms. It would raise
the maximum marginal income tax rate to 38 percent from 33 percent,
with part of the money going to the bailout.
   At a news conference, Jackson said the Bush plan would require
all taxpayers to pay for the industry bailout, and would unfairly
put the cost of the industry's excesses on poor people and
minorities who already had been hurt by industry discrimination in
lending.
   ``Let those who had the party pay for the party,'' Jackson said.
``It does not make sense that those who never were invited to the
party should be asked to pay to clean up the mess. ... Only the
wealthy were invited to the party.''
   ``The financial service companies and the wealthiest individual
Americans who benefited the most from soaring interest rates and
buccaneer banking should bear the burden of cleaning up the mess,''
Jackson said.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzales, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, appeared at the news conference and supported the plan.
   Jackson blamed deregulation under the Reagan administration for
allowing savings and loans to end their ``historic commitment'' to
small savers and home buyers, while leaving ``buccaneer bankers free
to gamble without risk, facing neither the discipline of a free
market, the risk of bankruptcy, nor the discipline of regulation,
the risk of prosecution.''

<HEAD>Murdoch Might Form New Company To Make Media Acquisitions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   News Corp. Ltd., the Australia-based international
conglomerate controlled by Rupert Murdoch, said Thursday it was
considering forming a separate company to acquire and develop media
and communications businesses.
   News Corp. would own at least 20 percent of the new company,
Murdoch said in a statement.
   In addition, News Corp. would transfer to the new company its
existing book publishing businesses. A substantial portion of the
proceeds from that transfer would be used to reduce outstanding
indebtedness of News Corp., Murdoch said.
   A spokeswoman at News International PLC, News Corp.'s British
subsidiary, speaking on condition she not be identified, would not
elaborate on Murdoch's statement.
   Among the company's major book publishing interests are William
Collins PLC, which agreed to be acquired by News International for
about $693 million in January, and Harper and Row Publishers Inc. of
the United States, acquired by News Corp. in 1987 for $300 million.
   Murdoch, who serves as his company's chief executive, said the
price of News Corp.'s book publishing assets to be transferred to
the new company would be determined by independent appraisal.
   News Corp. has run up substantial debt through the $2.85 billion
acquisition of Triangle Publications Inc. of the United States, the
publishers of TV Guide and other magazines, in October.
   Since then, the Australian company said it planned to reduce
borrowings by selling more than $1 billion worth of assets by June
30.
   News Corp. recently sold the Fox Plaza building in Los Angeles
and its interests in the U.S. and British editions of Elle magazine.
Market speculation about what else Murdoch might sell has centered
on his Australian television interests and various newspapers around
the world.
   The new company would raise capital globally through subsidiaries
of the CS First Boston Group, Murdoch said. Besides being a major
shareholder in the new company, News Corp. also would act as adviser
and provide management services.
   ``Although News Corp. would continue to pursue its own internal
expansion, it is intended that the primary vehicle for acquisitions
above a certain size would be the new company,'' Murdoch said.
   News Corp. Chairman Richard Searby indicated in the statement
that Europe would be the geographic focus for expansion by the new
company.
   ``The imminent integration of the European market is creating
vast investment opportunities for well-financed media organizations,
and the new company would be an active participant in an industry
that will witness a decade of rapid change and growth,'' he said.
   The 12-nation Common Market is to become one trade barrier-free
market place by the end of 1992.

<HEAD>Oil Giant Posts 14.3 Percent Decline in Quarterly Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Companies, the
Anglo-Dutch oil giant, said Thursday its fourth-quarter profit fell
14.3 percent, due mainly to a special charge and weak world crude
oil prices.
   The company, based in The Hague, the Netherlands, and London,
said net income for the three months ended Dec. 31 totaled 702
million pounds, or $1.2 billion, on an historical cost basis,
compared with 819 million pounds in the same period a year earlier.
   Royal Dutch-Shell said it took a special charge of 67 million
pounds during the quarter for an environmental cleanup of a former
chemicals manufacturing site at Rocky Mountain Arsenal property in
Colorado.
   On a current cost basis, which values the company's oil
inventories at current market prices and is more comparable to the
American accounting method of last in first out, or LIFO, net income
fell 19 percent to 765 million pounds, or $1.3 billion, from 943
million pounds.
   The per-share conversions into dollars were provided by the
company.
   Sales in the fourth quarter fell 7.2 percent to 14.2 billion
pounds, or $24.4 billion, from 15.3 billion pounds.
   For the year, net income rose 3.9 percent to 2.94 billion pounds,
or $5.1 billion, on an historical cost basis from 2.83 billion
pounds a year earlier.
   On a current cost basis net income rose 12.8 percent to 3.17
billion pounds, or $5.5 billion, from 2.81 billion pounds.
   Sales in 1988 fell 6.7 percent to 55.8 billion pounds, or $96
billion, from 59.8 billion pounds a year ago.
   The company said the annual profit improvement was curtailed by
depressed exploration and production activities, principally because
of the decline in world crude oil prices and lower natural gas sales
due to mild weather in Europe.
   However, manufacturing, marine and marketing earnings increased
substantially, the company said, because of higher volumes and
margins.
   The company also reported that chemicals had an excellent year,
with buoyant demand for petrochemicals and high capacity utilization.

<HEAD>Government Giving Much-Maligned Economic Report a Facelift</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government on Friday will issue a new
version of its much-maligned chief economic forecasting gauge, but
skeptical private analysts expect little improvement in the monthly
report's track record.
   The Index of Leading Economic Indicators _ sometimes derided by
its critics as the index of misleading indicators _ is designed to
foretell future economic activity by evaluating forward-pointing
business statistics.
   Government policy makers and private investors watch the index
closely for indications of strength or weakness in the U.S. economy
as much as six months in the future.
   Using data stretching back to 1948, the composite index has
correctly predicted all eight recessions by dropping for at least
three months in a row, but it also forecast four recessions that
never materialized.
   January's report, to be issued Friday, will drop two of 11
components from the index, revise two others, and feature two new
indicators of economic activity.
   Larry Moran, a spokesman for the government's Bureau of Economic
Analysis, said Thursday the changes will make the index less prone
to after-the-fact revision, less apt to make false predictions of
future downturns and more precise at predicting when downturns will
occur.
   ``This (old) index is so good that it has predicted 12 of the
last eight recessions,'' he quipped. ``The new index will be less
inclined to give us false signals. We hope it will be better at
telling us when they (downturns) are going to occur.''
   Private analysts said the changes are a step in the right
direction, but expectations aren't running high.
   Economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in New York says
the revised index will be an improvement because it will produce
fewer revisions, but ``in terms of giving false signals, it's
absolutely as prone as the old index to do that.''
   A bureau study of how the new index would have done if had been
in the past, in fact, showed that its performance would have been
similar to that of the old index.
   Marie Hertzberg, a bureau employee who worked on the revision,
said that while the index is not infallible, ``it has been a leader.
It's just another piece of information that can be used to analyze
the economy.''
   ``Is there anything that you put 100 percent reliance into on the
economy?'' she asked.
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington consulting firm, said his
opinion of the leading index in the past has been ``minus 1, on a
scale of 1 to 10.''
   With the revisions, Evans said, his rating could rise ``maybe as
high as zero. ... It can't get any worse.''
   He said a major problem with the index is its failure to take
into account future foreign demand for U.S. goods.
   ``You really can't predict the direction of the economy unless
you have some idea of net exports,'' Evans said.
   The Bureau of Economic Analysis says it is continuing to review
the index and is looking for ways to add a measure of future
international activity, but it has not yet found a reliable monthly
indicator.
   The two new indicators to be included starting Friday are a
University of Michigan survey of consumer optimism and a measure of
the change in manufacturers' unfilled orders.
   The two components that are being dropped _ changes in
outstanding credit and the change in inventories on hand and on
order _ were scrapped because up-to-date data has not been available
when the index first was compiled for a particular month. The index
for that month was later revised to include the updated information.
   Other factors in the index include average weekly initial claims
for unemployment benefits, an index of stock prices, building
permits, and orders for new plants and equipment.
   Robert Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago, said that while the index's value is limited, ``It's
something useful to have in the tool kit.''
   ``You just can't take it literally,'' Dederick said. ``You have
to apply a heavy dose of judgment to it. And you have to do that
just as much with the new one as with the old one.''
   Economist Robert Defina of Security Pacific National Bank in Los
Angeles said his firm has given little credence to the index in the
past.
   ``We're not going to look at the new index any more closely ...
until it comes up with a proven track record,'' Defina added.

<HEAD>Newsletter Writer-Celebrity James Grant: Debt is Devil in Disguise</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's borrowing binge is both a curse and a
blessing to James Grant, author of an irreverent financial market
newsletter who's made himself famous by expounding on the evils of
debt.
   His antipathy for deficits, buyouts and bad lending practices has
earned Grant a reputation in the business world as a miserly party
pooper in an era of unbridled excess.
   But even people who disagree with him say Grant is
thought-provoking, entertaining and may one day prove correct in his
warnings that the system cannot live on borrowed money indefinitely.
   ``I am out of step with the times,'' the writer of the
twice-monthly ``Grant's Interest Rate Observer'' said in a speech
last month to the Conference of Business Economists in Washington.
   Today, he said, ``it is possible to get a 40-year mortgage loan;
a bullet-style, floating-rate home-equity loan; a six-year auto
loan; a Sotheby's art-equity loan; a $50 billion, zero-coupon
secured savings-and-loan bailout loan, and a high-yield, payment in
kind LBO loan.
   ``It is hard, in fact, not to get one or more of those loans, if
you have a functioning mailbox into which credit cards can be
dropped.''
   Little known six years ago when he started the newsletter, Grant
now has 3,000 subscribers who pay $375 a year to absorb his wit,
wisdom and statistics. Readers range from billionaire entrepreneurs
Malcolm Forbes and Laurence Tisch to LBO strategist Theodore
Forstmann and PaineWebber Inc. chief executive Donald Marron.
   ``It's always a pleasure to read that letter,'' said Leon Levy, a
partner at Odyssey Partners, a New York investment firm that pursues
the kind of debt-financed dealmaking Grant routinely rails against.
   ``It is witty, lively, anecdotal and to the point, and I think
the stories he tells are always quotable,'' Levy said. ``And who can
tell, one of these days, he may be right.''
   In recent issues, Grant has satirized the lousy credit rating of
Duff &amp; Phelps Corp., a debt-rating agency that tripled its own debt
in a management buyout. He termed Citicorp's new 15-minute mortgage
idea, aimed at wooing customers with promises of quick approval for
their loans, the ``McMortgage.''
   When a $20 billion-plus bidding war broke out last year for RJR
Nabisco Inc., with rival suitors promising to finance a takeover
almost entirely with borrowed money, Grant's newsletter responded by
printing a mock proposal for a $115 billion debt-financed purchase
of International Business Machines Corp.
   ``With these GNP-sized deals, parody seems more appropriate than
commentary,'' he said.
   Grant routinely admonishes against the purchase of junk bonds,
the high-yield, high-risk securities that evolved into the fuel for
the 1980s debt-financed takeover era.
   He is equally suspicious of Michael Milken, the Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. financier who helped transform junk bonds into a $175
billion business and has been the target of a federal fraud
investigation for more than two years.
   Grant once said he considers himself ``cast in the role of Billy
Graham opposite a Hugh Hefner played by Michael Milken.''
   Tall, lanky, with Clark Kent eyeglasses and self-effacing smile,
the 42-year-old writer works out of a rented office on the 40th
floor of the Woolworth building in southern Manhattan, an ornate
skyscraper purchased by the retailing giant's founder F. W.
Woolworth in 1913 for $13.5 million in cash.
   It's one of the few prime properties on the world's most
expensive piece of real estate that has no mortgage or lien on it,
Grant tells visitors, adding: ``I wouldn't rent anywhere else.''
   A native Long Islander, Grant got into writing after graduating
Indiana University and the Columbia School of International Affairs.
He was a credit-markets columnist at Barron's financial weekly for
eight years before quitting to start the newsletter in 1983.
   Grant has said he never intended for ``Interest Rate Observer''
to evolve into a critique of credit, but the relentless pace of
borrowing in the economy increasingly alarmed him and reshaped the
newsletter's focus.
   It was the 1984 debt-refinancing of Metromedia Inc. five years
ago _ largely though the sale of what then was the largest junk-bond
offering in history _ that helped convince Grant of the dangers
lurking in such deals.
   Grant doesn't oppose the concept of debt. But he says the greater
the level of borrowed money greasing the economy, the greater the
chance the debt won't be repaid, inciting a chain reaction of events
that inevitably will mean sharply higher interest rates,
unemployment and recession.
   ``Debt magnifies results,'' he said in an interview. ``It's
magnified the business expansion of the past six years, bringing in
marginal consumers and helping employ marginal workers. But when
debt becomes available on more onerous terms, we'll see the
amplification on the downside.''
   As for his own financial health, Grant said, the newsletter is
supporting him and wife Patricia Kavanagh, who quit her job as a
Wall Street investment banker to help him publish it. They have four
children aged 1 to 8.
   Grant and his family aren't totally immune from the enticements
of borrowing. The credit cards in his wallet attest to that.
   ``We have a lot of them,'' he said. ``We try not to use too many
at once.''

<HEAD>London Shares Close Near Highs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices closed higher, near their session
peaks on Thursday, encouraged by the pound's recovery and a strong
early trend on Wall Street.
   The market recovered its poise after a nervous morning session,
with players trying to assess conflicting signals on the outlook for
British interest rates.
   The West German central bank's decision to leave its key interest
rate unchanged after its regular council meeting helped ease earlier
fears that British rates would have to rise simply to keep pace with
a West German rate hike.
   The unchanged West German rates helped the pound recover from an
early slide, which had reportedly prompted the Bank of England to
intervene several times to prop up sterling.
   Some players still feared another bout of sterling weakness could
force the Britsh government to signal an increase in the British
commercial banks' base lending rate from its current 13 percent
level.
   But many analysts said they believed the government is reluctant
for political reasons to raise rates ahead of Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson's March 14 budget statement, despite the
release Wednesday of another set of poor British trade figures.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 18.4
points, or 0.9 percent, higher at 2,039.7.
   Volume was a moderate 483.9 million shares, down from 535.4
million shares a day earlier.

   Federal mediators said Thursday that one side
in the dispute between Eastern Airlines and the Machinists' union
had made a new contract offer and negotiators were hopeful ``it
might be the kind of breakthrough we are looking for'' to avert a
strike.
   Walter C. Wallace, chairman of the Naional Mediation Board, said
representatives of the airline and the 8,500-member union had met in
Washington in the 17-month labor dispute.
   He declined to say which side had made the offer or what it
contained.
   ``We are assured by both sides that they want to reach a
settlement,'' Wallace told a news conference.
   The board asked President Bush last week to call a special panel
that would delay the strike 60 days beyond a midnight Friday
deadline.
   Wallace said the parties were evaluating the offer and would meet
later separately with board mediators in hopes of reaching a
settlement.
   ``There has been action that hopefully might be the kind of
breakthrough we are looking for. There's been some movement,''
Wallace said.
   Harry Bickford, chief mediator in the dispute, said, ``There is
an amended proposal made from one party to the other and it's under
consideration.'' He said it was the first change in the negotiations
in several weeks.

<TEXT>
   A snapshot of Silicon Valley, and a look
at the books of the computer chip makers that dot the landscape,
reveal few signs of the impending trouble suggested by recent
forecasts.
   Trade war cries against Japan, heard so often during the
mid-1980s, have mellowed, and there is a feeling that the Bush
administration will push Japan to open its markets more to U.S.
companies.
   ``There are indications the Bush administration will be more
forceful (than the Reagan administration) and not just reactive to
Congress,'' said Wilfred J. Corrigan, chairman and chief executive
officer of LSI Logic Corp. ``I don't think the Bush administration
is just going to lay down and let Japan violate the trade agreement.
I think they're going to force Japan to open up.''
   Doomsayers were prominent in the aftermath of a fourth-quarter
earnings decline at valley leader Intel Corp., and losses and
layoffs at National Semiconductor Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices
Inc.
   The layoffs of 2,000 workers at National Semiconductor in January
and 2,400 at AMD last year were interpreted by some people as
evidence that American chip makers are in full-fledged retreat
against their Japanese rivals.
   Yet Intel remains strong and the other two companies could bounce
back quickly with a pickup in demand from the computer industry. The
big three in the valley together account for more than $5.5 billion
in annual revenue.
   Meanwhile, the good times are rolling elsewhere in America's
electronic heartland.
   Unemployment is low _ barely above 3 percent _ with 192,500 of
the 813,700 workers in Santa Clara County holding jobs in the
electronics industry at year's end, industry figures show.
   Housing prices _ up to $600,000 for a three-bedroom home _ are
among the highest in the country. Posh restaurants are busy and the
streets are lined with expensive cars.
   Inside the companies, researchers are keeping ahead of the
Japanese in the high end of the microprocessor market with fast,
powerful products, such as a new chip from Intel capable of
executing 150 million operations per second.
   U.S. and Japanese chip makers are spending roughly equal amounts
of money on research-and-development and capial improvements as a
percentage of revenue in each industry.
   But Japan's dominance of the giant memory business, including the
dynamic random access memory chips (DRAMs) that were in short supply
last year, is giving it the edge in semiconductor manufacturing
techniques. The Japanese also are adding capacity faster than their
American counterparts.
   For the moment, though, Japanese companies seeking advanced,
high-performance components have to go to U.S. rivals to license the
technology, at least in the critical area of microprocessors.
   Intel plans to introduce another speed demon later this year _
the 80486 microprocessor, an upgrade of the 80386 that is the
central component of the most advanced personal computers made by
International Business Machines Corp. and many other manufacturers.
   Intel's earnings dipped 10 percent in the fourth quarter, but it
still had a superb year with revenues up 51 percent to $2.9 billion
and net income soaring 83 percent to $453 million.
   More than a dozen other local chip companies, ranging from tiny
startups to middle tier veterans like LSI Logic and Cypress
Semiconductor Corp., also are turning profits in niches of the
industry.
   LSI Logic, which grew 45 percent last year to $379 million in
revenues, is riding atop the burgeoning field of custom chips.
Gazelle Microcircuits Inc. is leaping ahead with high-performance
gallium arsenide chips.
   Growth in chip sales overall this year is slow as computer
companies burn off some inventory and cut back purchases. But
several segments of the industry, especially the custom chips and
high-performance microprocessors, are expected to do well.
   ``World to be flat in '89!'' warned a yearend report from In-Stat
Inc., a market research firm in Scottsdale, Ariz. Analyst forecasts
for 1989 ranged from minus 12 percent chip sales for the year to
plus 10 percent, quite a comedown from the 35 percent growth in 1988
and 21 percent in 1987.
   Forecasting growth patterns is difficult. ``It's all black magic
when you come right down to it,'' said Michael Boss of Dataquest
Inc., a market research firm in San Jose.
   Boss, who is sticking with Dataquest's 10 percent growth
forecast, was cheered a little when the January book-to-bill ratio,
a key gauge of industry health, edged up for the first time in four
months.
   Yet, whether the industry grows or shrinks a little this year,
the superficial picture of health misses a pervasive problem: The
United States is losing worldwide market share, and the trend
suggests that will continue. It is not necessarily a doomsday
scenario, but it is worrisome for the valley and the nation.
   America's share of the economically and strategically important
chip industry it invented will drop to about 35 percent worldwide
within four years, says Dataquest.
   The chip makers, whose tiny circuits run electronic products from
microwave ovens to corporate computers and Defense Department
satellites, still will have plenty of opportunities to cash in as
the overall market expands. But the bigger problem facing the valley
and the United States, analysts say, is the effect of not
participating at all in key segments of the electronics industry.
   High definition television is the latest area of consumer
technology that has been largely ignored by American companies while
Japan has been making advances.
   Loss of the spinoff business from a new generation of television
would be even more disastrous than losses from America's abandonment
of video cassette recorders and compact disk players, according to a
study by the American Electronics Association.
   In both cases, segments of the U.S. semiconductor industry simply
disappeared because there was no incentive for chip companies to
invest in those areas if the only buyers were Japanese manufacturers.
   ``American chip companies are not going to spend millions of
dollars developing a product that is uniquely suited for a Japanese
market unless their success in that market is better than in the
past,'' said Boss.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Surge On New Demand Talk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices closed with a powerful
surge Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade as talk of Soviet
buying interest triggered some of the most active trading so far
this year.
   Corn and oat futures also advanced but wheat futures retreated in
reaction to needed precipitation in major U.S. winter wheat areas.
   Unconfirmed rumors of Soviet plans to purchase U.S. corn and
possibly some soybean meal touched off the late rally in those
markets, analysts said.
   The reaction was especially pronounced in the soybean market,
which has become increasingly sensitive to demand factors as soybean
supplies have tightened _ a function of last summer's drought.
   ``In the face of no current supplies and users all being
hand-to-mouth, the market can blow up on you,'' said Cathy Leow, a
grain market analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New
York. ``Whenever you get a little demand at all, it explodes.''
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents to 4 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.36 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to
3{ cents higher with March at $2.75\ a bushel; oats were 2 cents to
6\ cents higher with March at $2.09 a bushel; soybeans were 9 cents
to 20 cents higher with March at $7.68 a bushel.

   Late in the afternoon prices of long-term government bonds, which
move in the opposite direction from interest rates, showed gains of

   That, in turn, seemed to encourage steady buying in the stock

<HEAD>Money Funds Rose $1.63 Billion in Latest Week</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund Report
are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the week ended Wednesday.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Assets of the nation's 455 money market mutual
funds rose $1.63 billion in the latest week to a record $294.06
billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   It was the eighth straight week that the funds assets hit an
all-time high and reflected the growing attraction of money market
investments because of rising interest rates.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 224 general purpose funds rose $2.39 billion to $95.19
billion, assets of 93 broker-dealer funds rose $938.6 million to
$126.14 billion, and assets of 138 institutional funds declined
$1.70 billion to $72.73 billion.
   ``Virtually all short-term rates rose sharply in the last week of
February. This increase caused a further substantial widening of the
yield spread favoring money market funds over competing investment
vehicles,'' said Jacob Dreyer, the institute's chief economist.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.65 percent from 8.52 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 8.49 percent from 8.43 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 31
days, unchanged from the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
6.42 percent as of Wednesday from 6.36 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, were unchanged at 5.14 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.76
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 8.57 percent
the previous week. Yields were 8.93 percent on 1-year CDs, up from
8.80 percent; 8.96 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.85 percent; and
8.99 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.90 percent.

<TEXT>
   Energy futures headed higher Thursday, paced by
rising prices for crude oil and wholesale home heating oil.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the April contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, settled 44 cents
higher at $18.72 a barrel, adding to Wednesday's gain of 13 cents.
Contracts for more distant months posted slightly smaller increases.
   Heating oil for April delivery settled at 51.87 cents a gallon,
up 1.38 cents from Wednesday's settlement.
   Among other refined petroleum products traded on the exchange,
April unleaded gasoline, which fell 0.01 cent on Wednesday, rose to
52.21 cents a gallon from 51.56.
   Chris Gohler, in the energy group of Elders Futures Inc., said a
combination of fundamental and technical factors pushed up crude
prices.
   Reports circulating in the markets that certain oil-exporting
countries will cut back crude production by about 400,000 barrels a
day boosted oil buying in the futures market.
   The exporters mentioned _ which were not members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries _ included the Soviet
Union and China, Gohler said.
   The buying built momentum as trading progressed and the April
crude contract ended the day at its highest levels of the session.
   Continuing speculation about temporary shortages due to low
inventories of heating oil encouraged buying as it has previously in
recent weeks.

   The dollar strengthened Thursday against most
major currencies in thin trading after turning mixed overseas.
   Gold prices declined. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
bid of $383.50 a troy ounce of gold at 4 p.m. EST, down 50 cents
from late Wednesday.
   Traders attributed the dollar's rise largely to technical
factors, although they said the currency got some support from the
West German central bank's decision Thursday to keep interest rates
unchanged.
   European traders said the dollar came under pressure against the
British pound after the Bank of England intervened to support the
weak currency by selling dollars for sterling. The pound had fallen
due to unexpectedly bad figures on Britain's trade performance
during January and persistent doubts about Britain's overall
economic health.
   The pound closed in London at $1.7270, more expensive for buyers
than Wednesday's late $1.7243. Later, in New York, sterling fetched
$1.7125, down from $1.72325.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar closed at 128.07 Japanese yen, up from 127.68 yen. The
dollar traded at 127.90 yen in London, and at 128.435 yen in New
York, up from 128.225 yen late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's
levels, included: 1.8474 West German marks, up from 1.83675; 1.5824
Swiss francs, up from 1.5690; 1.19485 Canadian dollars, down from
1.19875; 6.2880 French francs, up from 6.2495; and 1,361.33 Italian
lire, up from 1,354.25.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Wednesday's rates:
1.8405 West German marks, up from 1.8390; 1.5710 Swiss francs, up
from 1.5705; 6.2575 French francs, unchanged; 2.0735 Dutch guilders,
down from 2.0755; 1.1945 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1985; and
1,360.50 Italian lire, up from 1,354.75.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $383.80 a troy ounce, down 50 cents from late
Wednesday.
   Gold closed in London at a bid of $383.75 an ounce, down from
$384.25 Wednesday. The late bid price in Zurich was $383.25 an
ounce, down from $384.10.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $384.35 an ounce, down from
$386.45.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery closed at $5.753 a troy ounce, up from $5.744.
Silver fell in London to $5.76 an ounce from $5.79.

<HEAD>Dutch Investors Moving To Take Over UPI</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND DE LIGNY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Dutch investment company that is
seeking to take over the conglomerate that controls United Press
International said Thursday it is strongly interested in the
U.S.-based news agency.
   Avacus, a newly formed investment partnership, has so far bought
8 percent of the outstanding shares of the company that controls
UPI, Infotechnology Inc., a New York-based technology and
communications company, said spokesman Joop de Jong.
   ``Avacus is aware of UPI's far-from-ideal track record, but the
fact that the news agency is part of Infotechnology has been an
important consideration in the decision to prepare a bid for the
company,'' De Jong said.
   ``Avacus's principals see opportunities to improve
Infotechnology's performance on the stock exchange, as well as
possibilities to improve the company's management,'' De Jong said in
a telephone interview.
   Avacus's move was heralded in a banner headline Thursday on the
front page of the Dutch national daily, De Volkskrant. No bid for
Infotechnology has yet been made, said De Jong.
   Infotechnology has managed UPI since February 1988, when it took
over the company from Mexican publisher Mario Vasquez Rana, who
relinquished control of his stock for 10 years. Its chairman, Earl
W. Brian, and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. are the major shareholders.
   Avacus was formed in March 1988 for the sole purpose of acquiring
Infotechnology, according to the documents filed with the SEC. Reiss
&amp; Co., a Dutch investment company, is the majority partner.
   Johannes M.K. Nyks, former president and chief executive of the
American subsidiary of the Netherlands newspaper, VNU, also has an
interest. Nyks, who is based in Washington, left VNU in 1987.
   Nyks, in a letter to Brian dated Feb. 27, said Avacus considers
Infotechnology's stock undervalued and sought a meeting to discuss
``opportunities to increase shareholder value through a mutually
agreeable transaction.''
   Dwight Geduldig, a spokesman for UPI, said Wednesday that Brian
has responded publicly, ``I look forward to meeting with any
shareholder who has suggestions about ways to increase shareholders'
values.''
   In the cable television field, Infotechnology owns The Learning
Channel and Financial News Network, which brings business news to 33
million customers throughout the United States.
   Avacus ``has not yet conceived a fully developed business plan on
how to improve Infotechnology's performance,'' said De Jong. But he
added that there were no plans to curtail UPI's operational
independence.
   UPI reported a $16 million loss for 1988, and announced it was to
lay off 40 employees worldwide. The news agency's 1987 loss amounted
to $25 million. It employs about 1,000 people.
   Reiss and Co., the dominant partner in Avacus, is based in the
central Dutch town of Almere. It is involved in the computer
business, the funding of management buyouts and other investment
activities, De Jong said. It has not been previously involved in the
media world.
   Its majority shareholder is Jan Kuijten, a controversial Dutch
investor who has been named in the press here in connection with
irregularities in share transactions on the Amsterdam stock
exchange. No charges have ever been filed against Kuijten, who was
not available for comment.

   A drop in interest rates helped the stock market
stage a broad advance Thursday, recouping Wednesday's losses.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 15.35 on Wednesday,
climbed 22.67 to 2,265.71.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
982 up, 471 down and 506 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 161.98 million
shares, down from 177.21 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 191.87 million shares.
   A steady showing by the dollar against leading foreign currencies
helped push bond prices higher in the credit markets.
   Late in the afternoon prices of long-term government bonds, which
move in the opposite direction from interest rates, showed gains of
more than $5 for each $1,000 in face value.
   That, in turn, seemed to encourage buying in the stock market.
   Analysts said the worries about increasing inflation and Federal
Reserve credit-tightening that swept through the markets last week
apparently were easing.
   Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, said he expects the increase
in the consumer price index for February, which will be announced
later this month, to be smaller than the 0.6 percent gain reported
for January.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Union Carbide, up 1[ at
30|; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up \ at 30\; International
Business Machines, up | at 120{, and Exxon, up | at 44[.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet fell 2] to 50. The Wall Street Journal reported
that the company faces a controversy over sales practices involving
the credit data it compiles.
   Storage Technology led the active list, up ] at 2[. The company
reported fourth-quarter earnings of 10 cents a share, up from 3
cents in the comparable period a year earlier.
   SSMC rose 1[ to 34[. On Wednesday Semi-Tech Electronics (Far
East) raised its bid for SSMC to $34 a share, topping a $33-a-share
offer from Vincent Tan, a Malaysian investor.
   National Education, which was added to Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock composite index, gained ~ to 25|.
   Minnetonka, the most active issue in the over-the-counter market,
jumped 8 to 21~. The company retained an investment banking firm to
advise it on a possible sale or other transaction.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $25.64 billion, or 0.90
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
1.47 to 163.21.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 3.34 to 334.82, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up 2.84 at 289.95.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
2.73 to 402.53. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 324.95, up 2.77.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Surge On Hint Of New Demand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A mere hint of Soviet buying interest sent the jittery soybean
futures market into a powerful rally Thursday on the Chicago Board
of Trade and sparked some of the most active trading so far this
year.
   Corn and oat futures also advanced but wheat futures retreated
following Wednesday's runup on rumors, which were confirmed
Thursday, that the Soviet Union had purchased 485,000 metric tons of
U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   On other markets Thursday, energy futures surged; livestock and
meat advanced; copper futures gained; and precious metals were
narrowly mixed.
   Soybeans settled 11{ cents to 20{ cents higher with the contract
for delivery in March at $7.67{ a bushel; wheat was 2 cents to 3}
cents lower with March at $4.36\ a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 3}
cents higher with March at $2.75{ a bushel; oats were 2\ cents to 6
cents higher with March at $2.08} a bushel.
   Unconfirmed rumors of Soviet plans to purchase U.S. corn and
possibly some soybean meal touched off the late rally on the Board
of Trade, analysts said.
   The reaction was especially pronounced in the soybean market,
which has become increasingly sensitive to demand factors as soybean
supplies have tightened _ a function of last summer's drought.
   ``In the face of no current supplies and users all being
hand-to-mouth, the market can blow up on you,'' said Cathy Leow, a
grain market analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New
York. ``Whenever you get a little demand at all, it explodes.''
   Traders said the rally accelerated after the May soybean contract
surpassed $7.75 a bushel, triggering waves of computer-driven
speculative fund buying.
   The supply tightness is expected to ease in mid-April when the
South American soybean harvest begins.
   But U.S. weather concerns may have taken precedence by then as
the market weighs the prospects for a second year of drought.
   ``If the weather is good we'll have trouble going much higher; if
the weather's bad, we'll go a lot higher,'' said Victor Lespinasse,
a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Energy futures rose sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange
following reports that non-OPEC countries, including the Soviet
Union and China, may cut their crude-oil exports by about 400,000
barrels per day in the second quarter.
   The market had been expecting a cutback by those producers of
less than 200,000 barrels per day.
   The cutbacks, which have not been officially announced, would
support the efforts of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to bolster oil prices.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 20 cents to 44 cents
higher with April at $18.72 a barrel; heating oil was .84 cent to
1.38 cent higher with April at 51.87 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .45 cent to .65 cent higher with April at 52.21 cents a
gallon.
   Cattle futures surged on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as
continued strong cash prices defied expectations for a decline. Live
cattle fetched as much as $79 per hundredweight in Kansas.
   Pork futures also rose, reflecting light sales to packers at
higher prices.
   Live cattle futures settled .05 cent to 1.08 cents higher with
April at 78.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .50
cent higher with March at 82.75 cents a pound; live hogs were .10
cent lower to .32 cent higher with April at 44.55 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .40 cent to 1.18 cents higher with March at
39.25 cents a pound.
   Copper futures advanced for the fourth straight day on New York's
Commodity Exchange amid supply fears linked to a planned, 3-day
miners' strike in Peru.
   Gold and silver futures were nearly unchanged.
   Copper settled 1.6 cents to 2.7 cents higher with March at $1.474
a pound; gold was 50 cents to 80 cents lower with April at $386.60 a
troy ounce; silver was unchanged to 0.9 cent higher with March at
$5.753 a troy ounce.

   As Eastern Airlines careens toward what could be
its final conflict, the besieged carrier's managers face bitter
choices like bankruptcy, asset auctions or a takeover at a fire-sale
price.
   The economic impact of those scenarios would be felt deeply in
Florida and across the gamut of 118 cities where Eastern operates in
the United States, the Caribbean and Latin America.
   Eastern employs around 31,200 people, including 10,200 at its
Miami headquarters, 6,700 in Atlanta and 3,200 in New York. In South
Florida alone, the airline spent $541.2 million last year on
salaries and other employee benefits, and $11.1 million on fees at
three airports.
   As a strike deadline against Eastern of 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday
loomed, federal mediators expressed some hope for a settlement of
the contract dispute between the money-losing airline and its
militant Machinists union.
   President Bush still was weighing whether to step in and avert
the impending strike, as the National Mediation Board has
recommended.
   If there is a strike of more than a few days, ``That will be the
end of Eastern as we know it,'' said Louis Marckesano, an airline
analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia.
   His warning reflects the assessment of many analysts and other
observers.
   Eastern recently reported a record net loss of $335.4 million in
1988, nearly double its $181.7 million loss the year before. Revenue
dropped to $3.8 billion from $4.4 billion in 1987.
   The airline has a crushing $2.5 billion or so in debt.
   ``It's obviously a situation that's heading fast for the edge of
the cliff ... I see the prospect of bankruptcy as a real potential
outcome here,'' Farrell Kupersmith, a financial consultant to the
Air Line Pilots Association, recently told a gathering of analysts.
   Kupersmith, an associate managing partner of the Touche Ross &amp;
Co. accounting firm, represented creditors of Continental Airlines
after that carrier was put into bankruptcy in September 1983 by
Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo. Texas Air, Lorenzo's
Houston-based holding company, owns Eastern and Continental.
   After the bankruptcy filing, the steely-tough Lorenzo
restructured Continental and slashed the number of employees to
around 4,000 from 12,500.
   Several observers believe an Eastern bankruptcy could follow a
series of events, notably sales of assets such as planes, airport
gates and landing rights. After the assets had been stripped off,
they suggest, Lorenzo could then put the remaining ``shell'' company
under protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy
laws.
   Lorenzo would have a tougher time putting Eastern into Chapter 11
and sacking employees than he did with Continental _ but he could
still do it. As a result of amendments to the bankruptcy laws passed
in 1985, the Texas Air chief would first have to negotiate further
with the Eastern unions and demonstrate that he had no other
alternative.
   ``I don't see bankruptcy as being an immediate possibility,''
said Paul Karos, who follows the industry for First Boston Corp.
``It's a very last resort.''
   Another possible scenario is a takeover by outsiders, something
the Eastern unions have been trying to engineer for some time.
   Takeover strategist Carl Icahn, head of Trans World Airlines
Inc., has been lurking in the wings for months as a potential
acquirer of Eastern and is still there, according to observers and
union sources. Icahn may be hoping to pick up what remains of
Eastern at a fire-sale price, analysts suggest.
   Icahn has said publicly that Eastern, with its domestic routes,
would fit nicely as a feeder into TWA's international network.
   Other investor groups remain interested in Eastern, the sources
say, although neither they nor Icahn has made a formal offer.
   Selling Eastern as an integral unit is Lorenzo's ``ace in the
hole,'' analyst Marckesano said.

<HEAD>EEC Environment Ministers Agree To Seek Chemical Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Common Market environment ministers
Thursday agreed to try to outlaw production and use of chemicals
that have been blamed for jeopardizing the earth's ozone layer.
   The ministers from the 12-nation European Economic Community
agreed that they would try to obtain a total ban by the end of this
century on the production and use of chlorofluorocarbon, or CFC
compounds.
   They also decided to seek an 85 percent cutback in production as
soon as possible.
   These compounds, practically indestructible, are found in
refrigeration fluids, foam-blowing agents, cleaning solvents and,
outside North America and Scandinavia, aerosol propellants. They
have found wide use because they are non-toxic and do not burn.
   CFCs are widely blamed for depleting the ozone, a problem which
Greenpeace, the international environmental organization, claimed is
``out of control.''
   The ozone layer deflects much of the sun's harmful ultraviolet
rays and protects human health, crops, sea life and certain
industrial materials, according to Greenpeace.
   The ministers agreed to give the EEC Commission a mandate to
obtain a complete phase out of the manufacture and use of CFCs by
the year 2000. The Commission will represent the 12 nations at the
international conferences being held this year to discuss the ozone
issue and monitor application of the Montreal Protocol.
   This protocol, signed by 40 countries and ratified by 32, which
took effect Jan. 1, is aimed at reducing output and use of CFCs by
50 percent from current levels by 1998.
   The EEC ban would only affect CFCs covered by the Montreal
Protocol.
   The EEC ministers also gave a mandate to the Commission to
encourage other countries to sign, and ratify the protocol.
   The EEC member states are responsible for about half the world's
annual CFC production of a million tons, with Britain leading in
both production and exports. According to Greenpeace, Britain
exported CFCs to 117 countries in 1988, 81 of which had not signed
the Montreal Protocol.
   Greenpeace said that ``between 1979 and 1986 the ozone layer over
the EEC has already been depleted by an average of 3 percent. This
rises to nearly 7 percent in the winter.''
   Scientists have warned that further depletion of the ozone layer
would warm the earth, lead to increasing desertification, melt part
of the polar ice-caps, raise the sea level and flood parts of
low-lying countries.
   They have also warned that a thinning of the ozone layer, which
lies in the earth's stratosphere, would increase the numbers of skin
cancers. According to Greenpeace ``each 1 percent depletion is
estimated to increase the incidence of skin cancers by around 4
percent.''
   Ministers from countries which have ratified the Montreal
Protocol are due to meet in London from March 5 to 7 and a further
conference is scheduled in Helskinki, Finland, from May 2 to 5 to
monitor the application of the protocol.

   Cooper Industries Inc.'s buyout of Champion
Spark Plug Co. may cost more than the $707 million in cash the
Houston-based company is offering because of Wall Street activity,
an auto industry analyst said Thursday.
   Cooper offered on Feb. 6 to buy Champion for $21 a share. The
merger agreement approved by the boards of directors of Cooper and
Champion on Feb 22.
   Since Cooper announced it would buy Champion, Gabelli Group Inc.,
a New York investment company, has reduced its 17.6 percent stake in
Champion to about 14 percent.
   The Gabelli Group sold off 376,650 shares of Champion common
stock at between $22.50 to $23 a share between Feb. 13 and Feb. 24,
according to Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Wednesday.
The group had been managing about 6 million shares of Champion stock
for investors.
   In addition, Champion stock has steadily been trading above $21 a
share on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Cooper may have to increase its $21-a-share offer to buy 50.1
percent of Champion stock, said William Prebe, an auto analyst and
former vice president for Dana Corp., an automotive giant that had
made a bid to buy Champion.
   ``Gabelli could be creating market activity to get the price
up,'' Prebe said. ``Cooper might not be able to get 50 percent of
the shares. And if Cooper cannot get 50 percent, they are going to
have to increase their tender offer.
   ``If he (Gabelli) is selling at $22 a share, someone has got to
be buying. He might be convincing a buyer that the price will even
go higher,'' he said.
   Several telephone messages left Thursday for Mario Gabelli,
manager of the Gabelli Group, were not returned.
   Prebe and other auto industry analysts have said it was unlikely
that another company would make a bid for Champion.
   Under the terms of the deal, Cooper is making a $21-a-share cash
tender offer for all of Champion's 33.6 million shares of
outstanding common stock.
   The deal, including debt reduction, legal fees and other
considerations, brings the total purchase price to about $800
million.
   The tender offer, which began Feb. 24, is scheduled to March 22,
with the merger taking place after May 1. Cooper spokeswoman Ellen
Meyers said the company won't reveal how many shares have been
tendered until after March 22.
   She also declined comment on speculation that the company may
have to increase its tender offer.
   ``I don't think we want to speculate on what the merger will cost
the company or the stock's activity,'' she said.
   Auto analysts say the key to the deal is whether Chinook Partners
L.P. will tender its shares, a move that could lock up the deal for
Cooper.
   Chinook was established in 1986 by the founding Stranahan family
to maintain a dominant voice in Champion's affairs. It controls 35
percent of Champion's common stock.
   ``I think the Chinook group will wait to the last minute before
tendering their shares because they want to get the best price,''
Prebe said.
   Champion is the world's leading manufacturer of spark plugs for
all types of internal combustion engines. It has annual revenue of
about $720 million and employs about 9,200 people worldwide.
   Cooper, with 1988 revenue of $4.3 billion, is a diversified
worldwide, manufacturer of products from the electrical, electronic,
commercial, industrial, compression and drilling markets.

<HEAD>Farm Credit System Reports Quarterly, Annual Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Farm Credit System reported Wednesday that
its fourth-quarter net income jumped 51 percent over the previous
year and that it earned a profit for all of 1988.
   The system said it netted $270 million in the three months ended
Dec. 31, compared with earnings of $179 million in the 1987 period.
   For the year, it earned $704 million, vs. a $17 million loss in
the previous year.
   Alan Fass, president and chief executive officer of the Federal
Farm Credit Banks Funding Corp., the financing arm of the farm
credit system, attributed the improvements largely to fewer loan
losses. Also contributing to the positive results were increased net
interest income and a gain on the sales of certain properties, he
said.
   ``Positive trends in the farm economy and the system's own
efforts to reduce non-earning assets, deliver credit more
efficiently and increase net interest income are making a difference
in the bottom line,'' Fass said in a statement.
   Net interest income rose to $216 million from $156 million during
the fourth quarter, and to $787 million from $509 million for the
year.
   The system said that net interest income increased throughout
1988 as a result of higher cash payments on nonaccrual loans and
reinstatements of nonaccrual loans to accrual status.
   When loans are placed on nonaccrual status they are accounted for
only as they come in rather than when they are due.
   Offsetting last year's positive factors, though, were
extraordinary charges of $174 million related to the debt
restructuring of three Farm Credit banks.
   The 1988 net income also included the recognition of $255 million
in losses relating to the Federal Land Bank of Jackson, which was
placed into receivership on May 20.
   The Farm Credit System is a nationwide system of federally
chartered agricultural lending institutions serving the rural
economy and cooperatively owned by their borrowers.
   The system took several steps last year to streamline its
structure following 1987 legislation that included the issuance of
up to $4 billion in government-backed, low-interest loans.

   The Federal Trade Commission said Thursday that
Detroit-area auto dealers broke federal antitrust laws by agreeing
among themselves to close showrooms on Saturdays and most weekday
evenings.
   The dealers were ordered to remain open 64 hours each week for a
year. The dealers' association said an appeal would be filed.
   The FTC's action overturned a 1987 decision by a federal
administrative law judge that declared the dealers justified in
limiting hours because they were seeking peace with their unions
rather than higher profits.
   But FTC Chairman Daniel Oliver said the agreement on showroom
hours was improper because it ``was not part of a labor negotiation
process.''
   On the contrary, he wrote in the FTC opinion, the dealers ``admit
that, to the extent the agreement was motivated by labor concerns,
it was designed to prevent collective bargaining.''
   An agreement to limit shopping hours is the same as an agreement
to raise prices, Oliver wrote. ``The evidence indicates that
respondents expected the hours restriction to benefit them by
limiting comparison shopping,'' he wrote.
   The FTC complaint charged that the dealers had conspired to limit
their hours of business since 1960.
   Most car dealers in the Detroit area are open past 6 p.m. only on
Monday and Thursday nights. They are closed on Saturdays, and blue
laws bar Sunday hours.
   Dealerships elsewhere in the nation typically are open on
weekends.
   Evidence heard by the FTC said the Saturday closings were
enforced against recalcitrant dealerships with picket lines,
threats, violence and vandalism, including gunshots through windows
at one dealership.
   Last April, six shotgun blasts peppered the large front windows
of the Key Motor Mall showroom in Warren. Owner Leo Jerome believed
the shots were linked to him keeping his business open on Saturday.
There have been no arrests, despite his offer of a $25,000 reward.
   Jones said Thursday he had mixed feelings about the FTC ruling.
He said he was happy because his position was upheld, but concerned
because the government was telling him how many hours he had to be
open. Normally, his showroom is open 61 hours a week.
   ``Now, by federal mandate, I have to be open another night or
another three hours on Saturday,'' he said. ``Already my people are
stretched out timewise.''
   Under the FTC opinion, which named 53 dealerships, 78
individuals, the Detroit Auto Dealers Association and 16 other
automotive associations, each Detroit-area dealer can set its own
hours as long as the 64-hour-a-week minimum is met.
   The hours of operation must be conspicuously posted at each
dealership.
   Moreover, the Detroit Auto Dealers Association will be required
to place at least four newspaper advertisements a week for at least
four weeks explaining that the FTC order prompted the extended
shopping hours.
   The dealers have 20 days in which to ask the FTC to reconsider
its decision, a rarely used procedure, or within 30 days could
appeal directly to a federal appellate court.

   A $4 million management and finance agreement

   The agreement, approved Wednesday by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge

Yugo operating at least for another four months.
   Yugo and parent Global Motors Inc. filed for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law on Jan. 30.
   Commisa said he may rule next week on whether to allow a
Columbus, Ohio, liquidator, Norauto Ltd., to sell 4,700 Yugos, which
Norauto says it acquired in a purchase agreement.
   Yugo contends the agreement represented an extension of credit,
and says the cars' sale could lead to its collapse.

   We believe that the following reforms would help resolve these
problems and improve the congressional budget process:
   _There is no reason why the Congress should adopt a completely
new budget plan every year. A two-year budget would ease that burden
and would give the executive branch a better opportunity to achieve
real savings.
   _We recommend using current year outlays rather than the current
services budget as the benchmark for the following year's budget.
   _Much of the delay under current procedures can be attributed to
differences between the two houses of Congress. Replacing the two
budget committees with a joint committee on the budget would force
the Congress to confront these differences earlier in the year. Some
method should be found to reduce the duplication inherent in the
present system of separate authorization and appropriations
committees.
   _At present, the president is not a party to the budget
resolution. It is simply an agreement between the two houses.
Requiring the president's signature on the budget resolution, if he
approves, would ensure that he was part of the process from the
beginning.
   _Failure to adopt a budget resolution greatly delays the
enactment of appropriations bills. We support the idea of an
automatic budget resolution, at the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings sequester
level, to become effective on May 15 if Congress has failed to agree
on a budget resolution.
   _The use of omnibus, full-year appropriation bills has been
roundly and justifiably condemned. An automatic continuing
resolution, with appropriations at the previous year's level with no
adjustment for inflation, would eliminate the use of these omnibus
bills. ...
   _In addition to these measures, we believe that steps should be
taken to enhance the president's power to rescind appropriations or
to veto line items. The balance of power on budget issues has swung
too far from the executive and toward the legislative branch.
   _We also support a constitutional amendment to require a balanced
budget with limits in revenues that can be collected.
   _Until the process is improved, it is evident that budget
decisions will have to be confirmed through an agreement between the
president and Congress, like the agreement reached at the end of
1987. Such an agreement will only be effective if the public and
financial markets are confident that it will be observed. ...
   We share the growing concern about the treatment of Social
Security in the calculation of the deficit. We support the principle
of a unified budget, as laid out by the 1968 President's Commission
on Budget Concepts. However, we also recognize that the Social
Security surpluses accumulated to pay future liabilities must be
protected.
   Toward that end, we support the enactment of legislation to
establish deficit or surplus targets whose purpose would be to
eliminate gradually the non-Social Security deficit so long as our
defense and national security interests are not harmed. ...

<TEXT>
   The World Bank on Thursday held up $350 million
worth of installments on two loans to Argentina on grounds that the
country had failed to meet all conditions in making economic
reforms, bank officials said.
   Argentina's government has done much to implement its reform
programs, said the officials, who briefed a reporter on condition
they not be indentified. However, they said, specific conditions for
release of the installments have not yet been met.''
   The officials declined to specify the unmet conditions, but they
said the loans involved were to improve trade policy and to make
banks more effective.
   Recognizing efforts made by the government in the past six
months, the World Bank continues to support Argentina's efforts to
restructure its economy, the officials said.
   Last Oct. 27 the bank approved four loans worth $1.25 billion for
Argentina, one of the most heavily indebted countries in Latin
America. Argentine foreign debt is about $55 billion.
   Bank officials said that so far the bank had given $254 million
of the package to Argentina.
   The action taken Thursday was to defer the authorization for
disbursement of ``tranches'' or installments of the $300 million
trade loan and the $400 million banking loan.
   The bank had already extended the first half of the trade loan
and was planning to hand over the second half of that loan plus the
first half of the banking-sector loan for a total of $350 million.
   The package approved last October also included two investment
loans _ $300 million for the housing sector and $252 million for the
electric power sector.
   Besides the trade installment, the bank had also extended $104
million of the electric-power loan.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Feb. 20, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 increased to a seasonally
adjusted $3,076.7 billion from $3,069.5 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted
$3,945.9 billion from $3,926.6 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $789.5 billion from $784.3 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The Fed last month reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of 3
percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent
growth in M3. The Fed has not set a target for M1 growth since early
1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,069.8 billion, a 3.8
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13
weeks. M3 averaged $3,922.4 billion, up 5.1 percent, while M1 rose
1.8 perent percent to an average of $788.1 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $2.03 billion,
compared with a decline of $75 million a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window averaged $308 million a day,
down from $534 million.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves totaled $593 million,
down from $670 million a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $287.4 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, unchanged
from two weeks earlier.

<TEXT>
   Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc., the world's largest
maker of contact lenses, will begin selling its new disposable
contact lenses nationally, company officials said Thursday.
   The SeeQuence disposable lens is intended for one to two weeks of
continuous wear, with no cleaning required, before being discarded.
The company began selling the lenses last year in Boston, Florida
and California.
   The lenses will be available through selected eye care
practitioners, said company spokesman Rick Kase.
   Disposable contact lenses are becoming the latest hot product in
the eye care industry.
   Earlier this week, the Atlanta-based CIBA Vision announced plans
to begin selling its own brand of disposable lenses called NewVue.
Johnson &amp; Johnson was the first company to introduce the throw-away
lenses two years ago.
   The three companies and eye doctors tout the disposable trend as
healthier for the wearer's eyes, but some industry analysts wonder
if people are ready to pay the price to have contact lenses they can
discard.
   A pair of soft contact lenses may cost about $100 and last for at
least a year, but a package of disposable lenses may cost between
$300 and $500 and last a year.
   ``There are more than 250,000 patients currently wearing
disposable contact lenses,'' said Hal Johnson, president of Bausch &amp;
Lomb's professional products division.
   He said that sales of SeeQuence in the three markets have
increased 25 percent each month among the 1,000 optometrists and
ophthalmologists dispensing the product. By year-end, more than
3,000 practitioners will be selling the disposable lenses.

   The government Thursday selected a group
headed by Finish firm Neste Oy to run the nationalized Portuguese
petrochemical giant, CNP, and buy government shares in a second
chemical firm.
   Neste Oy, together with two Portuguese firms, Cotesi and Quintas
e Quintas, will sign a 10-year contract to manage the money-losing
state-owned petrochemical company CNP _ Companhia Nacional
Petroquimica.
   As part of the deal, the companies will pay $670 million to buy
the government's 86.8 percent share in the second firm, the
profitable Empresa de Polimeros Sines (EPSI).
   The center-right, Social Democrat government of Prime Minister
Anibal Cavaco Silva linked EPSI and CNP hoping the sale of the
profitable polymer producer would tempt firms into taking on the
management of CNP, a major loss-maker with some $1.5 billion of
debts.
   Thursday's government statement said Neste Oy's was the only bid
that directly included Portuguese firms in the project and offered
the best financial conditions.
   The government statement also revealed steps towards the eventual
privatization of other state-owned firms.
   Telefones de Lisboa e Porto (TLP), a state telecommunications
company, and the oil company, Petrogal, are to be transformed into a
limited companies (Sociedades Anonimas) with majority holdings for
the state.
   Under the terms of Portugal's socialist-inspired constitution,
the government cannot yet sell more than 49 percent of nationalized
industries.
   However they are free to rent out the company, as will be the
case with CNP.

<HEAD>Shamrock Files Suit Against Polaroid Stock Buyback</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shamrock Holdings Inc. filed suit
Thursday in U.S. District Court in Delaware against Polaroid Corp.'s
plan to buy back $1.1 billion of stock.
   The complaint alleges Polaroid has given its shareholders
misleading information about its future earnings and possible damage
payments arising from patent infringements by Eastman Kodak Co.
   Polaroid denied the allegation. The companies agreed to argue the
case on March 15 before Judge Caleb Wright so that a decision can be
rendered before the buyback offer expires March 20.
   Shamrock, a radio and television concern based in Burbank,
Calif., has made a $45-a-share hostile tender offer, valued at $3.2
billion, for Polaroid. Shamrock is also waging a proxy battle for
control of Polaroid's board of directors at the May 9 annual meeting.
   Polaroid, the instant camera and film company based here, will
significantly strengthen its position in the proxy battle if its
stock buyback plan is upheld by the court.
   Polaroid is offering $50 a share for 16 million shares, or 22
percent of its outstanding common stock.
   Shamrock, controlled by the Roy E. Disney family, asked the court
to enjoin Polaroid from repurchasing any shares.
   In describing its buyback plan, Polaroid projected growth rates
of 12 percent to 16 percent for both sales and profits from 1990 to
1995. It also said it could receive several billion dollars in
damages from Kodak. But it inserted cautionary language telling
stockholders not to rely on those figures.
   Shamrock contends the figures are unduly optimistic and that the
``boilerplate disclaimers'' are not sufficient. It contends Polaroid
is unfairly trying to improve incumbent management's chances of
winning the proxy battle.
   Polaroid, in response, said Shamrock's lawsuit is ``without merit
and is merely another self-serving attempt by Shamrock to further
its objective of acquiring Polaroid at a price the Board has
determined to be inadequate.''

<HEAD>Racy TV Show Loses Several Major Advertisers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two big advertisers have quit buying time on
the racy television comedy ``Married ... With Children'' and others
have spurned selected episodes for fear of offending consumers,
executives said Thursday.
   Some advertising insiders expect such decisions to become more
common as TV entertainment shows carry more raunchy humor and
profanity and so-called tabloid TV programs delve into kinky sex,
devil worship and similarly salacious subjects.
   Others say controversy over content is as old as television, and
that recent advertiser defections from ``Married ... With Children''
are no more likely to have a lasting effect than did controversy
over ``All in the Family'' a decade ago.
   Some defectors from ``Married,'' which is the fledgling Fox
Broadcasting Co.'s top-rated show, were influenced by an energetic
letter-writing campaign by a Detroit-area mother, Terry Rakolta,
spokesmen said.
   The show, a situation comedy about a blue-collar family named
Bundy, includes references to sex and bathroom humor, and frequently
portrays the husband berating his wife.
   Two advertisers, Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and American Home Products
Corp., bought some ads on the show but have decided against further
sponsorship, spokesmen said Thursday. Johnson &amp; Johnson and
McDonald's Corp. officials said they decided against running
national advertising on the show, though individual, locally
purchased ads had run.
   Coca-Cola USA, whose president, Ira Herbert, wrote an apology to
Mrs. Rakolta, continues to screen ``Married'' episodes for content,
but hasn't found one suitable for advertising since her complaint
Jan. 15, said spokesman Tony Tortorici.
   Advertisers' concerns were summed up by Procter &amp; Gamble
spokeswoman Kelly Gillespie: ``We felt that the whole theme of the
show is basically one we do not want to be associated with. We were
concerned about the negative portrayal of American family life.''
   Fox, which purposefully appeals to the young adult audiences
sought by advertisers in its effort to build a fourth television
network, hasn't had any trouble selling ads on the show, which airs
Sunday evenings, said spokesman Brad Turell.
   ``The show is completely sold out,'' he said, adding that news
reports of Mrs. Rakolta's campaign prompted calls of support from
viewers.
   ``We have received literally hundreds of telephone calls today
from across the country from viewers saying that this one woman's
opinion is getting too much attention and hoping that we won't
change the show,'' Turell said.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, which makes hundreds of household products and
is the nation's second-largest advertiser, bought ads on several
``Married'' episodes last year, stopped from October through
December and then sponsored two shows in January, Ms. Gillespie
said. After receiving Mrs. Rakolta's letter, officials reviewed the
show and decided against further ads, she said.
   American Home Products, which makes goods as diverse as Jiffy Pop
and Woolite, had already decided to disassociate itself from the
show before receiving Mrs. Rakolta's letter, said spokeswoman Carol
Emerling in New York.
   Tambrands Inc., which produces feminine hygiene products such as
Tampax tampons, planned to advertise on two ``Married'' episodes but
canceled the second after a review prompted by Mrs. Rakolta's
letters, said Paul Konney, a spokesman at the company's New York
headquarters.
   Advertisers face a dilemma in deciding whether to sponsor racy
shows, which often attract big audiences but may offend some vocal
consumers.
   ``Tabloid TV'' shows such as ``Geraldo'' and Fox's ``A Current
Affair'' have difficulty attracting advertisers because of what many
see as their exploitation of the weaker side of humanity.
   A recent survey of advertisers and ad buyers found resistance to
such shows, topped by the often outrageous ``The Morton Downey Jr.''
talk show, said Dean McCarthy, vice president of Harrington, Righter
&amp; Parsons, a New York firm that helps television stations sell air
time.
   Virtually all big companies have guidelines for what kind of
shows are acceptable for their ads, and most hire screening
companies to check shows in advance for problems.
   As television presses the outer limits of conventional taste _
sparked in part by looser federal regulations and increased
competition among the various media for ads _ finding an appropriate
spot for an ad can get difficult, said McDonald's spokeswoman
Stephanie Skurdy.
   ``Ours is a children's and family business,'' Ms. Skurdy said
from the company's Oak Brook, Ill., headquarters. ``It has become
increasingly difficult to find family programming on prime-time
television.''
   ``I think the amount of sexuality portrayed on television today
is increasing dramatically,'' said Hal Katz, executive vice
president of Vitt Media International Inc., a New York ad buyer.
``As it increases, advertisers become more sensitive to it.''
   But Paul Isaacson, vice president of Young &amp; Rubicam, a New York
advertising agency, said complaints about shows' content don't
appear any more frequent now than they ever have.
   Those who seek to influence television content through pressure
on advertisers are attempting censorship, said Carol Sobel, an
American Civil Liberties Union attorney who has dealt with free
speech issues.
   ``If you don't want to watch it then don't watch it,'' Ms. Sobel
said.

   Eastern Airlines offered a new contract
proposal to its Machinists union Thursday, and federal mediators
expressed hope of averting a Friday midnight strike that could
disrupt travel nationwide.
   The union said the company offer was an improvement but still
called for pay cuts rather than pay hikes, and strike preparations
were continuing. Further talks also were expected, mediators said.
   Eastern pilots, meanwhile, rejected a separate company offer
designed to keep them from staging a sympathy strike with the
Machinists. Both the pilots and flight attendants said they would
refuse to cross picket lines if a strike is called after the end of
a federally imposed cooling-off Friday night.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said all union workers should
honor Machinist picket lines, which other union officials have said
could be put up at other airlines and transportation companies in
addition to Eastern.
   Kirkland accused Frank Lorenzo, owner of Texas Air Corp. which is
Eastern's parent company, of ``finding it worth his while to
purchase a good company and strip its assets, rather than operate it
fairly and decently.''
   Kirkland asked President Bush to follow a National Mediation
Board request and call a special panel that would delay a strike for
60 days.
   Bush plans to meet with top advisers on the situation on Friday.
   Eastern opposes presidential action, saying it is losing $1
million a day and can't afford delay in making salary cuts it has
proposed. It had originally asked $150 million in cuts, but union
official Wally Haber in Miami said the new offer was less stringent.
   ``The company is still looking for major concessions, but it's
not $150 million,'' Haber said.
   The union has been asking for $50 million in raises.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said a letter to Bush signed by a
third of the Senate urged him to step in, noting that Eastern serves
102 cities throughout North and South America, with 60 U.S. cities
in 27 states dependent on the airline for passenger and freight
service.
   ``Any interruption in this service will result in a major
disruptin of interstate commerce,'' the letter said.
   Kennedy noted that no president has ever refused to act on a
mediation board recommendation to call a special panel.
   Eastern said its new offer would give mechanics a pay reduction
that still keeps their salaries 13 percent higher than all other
employees who took a 20 percent pay cut when Lorenzo took over the
company in 1986. It said baggage handlers would receive no greater
cuts than other employees.
   The company said the offer would give 8,500 mechanics, baggage
handlers and other ground workers five years of job security and
``provides a strong financial incentive for Eastern to grow and
avoid further downsizing to cope with its financial difficulties.''
   ``We've been seeking a negotiated settlement all along and
anything that moves us in that direction is welcome and we remain
hopeful we can work out a negotiated agreement prior to the midnight
deadline,'' said airline spokesman Robin Matell in Miami.
   Union president William Winpisinger, who was not participating in
the talks, said he had not heard of any new offer, but added, ``If
there's movement indicated, maybe there's a possibility we'll get it
settled.''
   Walter C. Wallace, National Mediation Board chairman, announced
that a new offer was made in talks Thursday but declined to say
which side made it.
   ``There has been action that hopefully might be the kind of
breakthrough we are looking for. There's been some movement,''
Wallace said.
   He said the parties were evaluating the offer and would meet
separately later with board mediators in hopes of reaching a
settlement in the 17-month dispute.
   ``We are assured by both sides that they want to reach a
settlement,'' Wallace told a news conference.
   Wallace said it would be possible for the union and the airline
to ``stop the clock'' if negotiations continued past Friday midnight.
   Eastern's 3,500 pilots, meanwhile, who were wooed ardently by
management hoping they will not cross Machinists' picket lines,
rejected an Eastern proposal the company said included sweetened pay
and other promises.
   ``The company's proposal, and the manner in which they have sent
it forth proves to us that management is not interested in any
earnest efforts to resolve the current labor situation at Eastern,''
said John J. Bavis, chairman of the Eastern Air Lines Pilots' master
executive council. Bavis called the offer ``a public relations
gimmick.''
   The threatened strike has sent travelers scrambling for other
carriers, and Lorenzo warned a sympathy walkout by pilots could bury
the 60-year-old company ``in the corporate graveyard.''
   Mechanics have been taking home personal equipment boxes and
tools, fearing they might be locked out before the strike. Wearing
red union T-shirts, Machinists were handing leaflets to travelers at
Miami International Airport.
   The union contends its members can picket any transportation
company covered by the Railway Labor Act, which includes airlines,
railroads and some shipping concerns. The parent union, the
International Association of Machinists, has been seeking an order
from a federal judge in Washington clarifying the union's strike
rights under that law.
   Other airlines contend their Machinists and fellow airline
workers would be violating no-strike clauses in their contracts if
they honored picket lines set up by Eastern strikers.
   Northwest, United Airlines, USAir and Piedmont Airlines all have
sued to block potential job actions by their Machinists.
   Eastern said it will continue flying during a strike, although
company officials refused to disclose contingency plans. The company
promised passengers would be re-routed or given refunds on any
canceled flights, but ticket agents reported a surge in sales at
Eastern competitors.
   Some carriers have stopped short of promising to honor all
Eastern tickets, fearing the company could declare bankruptcy.

<HEAD>Chrysler Vice Chair: March A Test For Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>

   The automobile industry and its reliance on
incentives is being tested this month, as car and truck sales
nationwide show signs of softening compared with last year, Chrysler
Corp.'s vice chairman said Thursday.
   Gerald Greenwald said incentives, which have become entrenched in
automobile selling during the last few years, aren't as common as
they were last year.
   Meantime, ``we've seen some slackening of traffic in dealerships
throughout the country,'' he said.
   Some people speculate that normal winter patterns are causing the
downturn in sales, ``but we're about to be put to a test.''
   ``Here we are in the month of March that is usually a very strong
selling month,'' he said at a news conference.
   February sales figures are due out Friday. Through Feb. 20, sales
of cars and trucks had fallen 3.2 percent compared with last year
when, as Greenwald said, ``blockbuster incentives'' were in effect.
   ``If the overall question is do I expect to see incentives
continuing, yeah, I do,'' he told reporters.
   Greenwald's comments came before he addressed a banquet at the
annual meeting of the Society of Automotive Engineers.
   Separately, Ford Motor Co. said Thursday it had extended for two
months a sales incentive program scheduled to expire Thursday and
will add to it, including a rebate of up to $4,000 on the imported
Merkur XR4Ti.
   The nation's No. 2 automaker offered cash-back incentives through
May 2 ranging from $400 to $4,000 for the XR4Ti, which carries a
base price of $19,929. The highest rebate, boosted from $3,000,
equals more than 20 percent of the German car's price.
   The company also extended low-financing offers ranging from 4.9
percent interest for two-year loans to 9.9 percent for five-year
loans on various models. Buyers of some of the models covered in the
offers had the option of taking cash incentives or the low financing
program.
   Also Thursday, Chrysler Corp. said it raised its stock dividend
from 25 cents to 30 cents a share, following the leads of General
Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
   The 20 percent dividend increase is the first for Chrysler since
April 1987, the company said.
   The dividend is payable April 17 to shareholders of record on
March 15. At the end of 1988, there were about 233 million shares of
Chrysler common stock outstanding, the nation's No. 3 automaker said.
   On Feb. 7, GM said it was boosting its dividend to $1.50 from
$1.25 and splitting its common stock 2-for-1. Ford boosted its
dividend Jan. 12 to 75 cents a share from 60 cents.

   Twenty years ago, a delta-winged wonder known as the
Concorde 001 took off on its maiden flight, lifting off gracefully
from an airstrip in southern France and becoming the fastest
commercial jet in the sky.
   About 3,000 people gathered in a hangar on Thursday to toast the
event and to promote plans for a second-generation Concorde to carry
passengers into the 21st century at twice the speed of sound.
   Plans for the new jet were unveiled Wednesday at Aerospatiale
offices in the southern French city of Toulouse. The state-owned
company built the Concorde with British Aerospace.
   Sir Raymond Lygo, chief executive of British Aerospace, and Henri
Martre, president of Aerospatiale, said $555 million in government
backing is being sought for developing the new jet, designed to
carry 280 passengers and travel at 1,550 mph.
   British Airways and Air France each owns seven Concordes, which
can travel up to 1,367 mph and carry 100 to 144 people.
   The new design retains the shape of a sleek bird with a
downturned beak, which many aircraft aficionados call the world's
most beautiful high-flying silhouette.
   Rolls Royce, which provides the engines for the present Concorde
fleet, announced this week it could design a new engine that would
be considerably lighter and greatly increase the range and
efficiency of the jets.
   Those celebrating Thursday included Andre Turcat, the test pilot
who flew the Concorde 001 for 29 minutes over dozens of reporters
and thousands of people who had jammed roads around the airfield to
watch.
   Turcat, later elected mayor of Toulouse, said when he landed,
``And so, at last, the big bird flies, and as you can see, it flies
very well.''
   The British Concorde 002 made its first flight, guided by pilot
Brian Trubshaw, on April 9, 1969.
   Six months later, the plane broke the sound barrier.
   Breaking the profit barrier was another matter.
   Between the first commercial flights in 1976 and 1984, the
jetliner flew in the red.
   The plane was expensive to operate, and Air France lost $24
million between 1976 and 1980. Annual subsidies from Britain to keep
their Concordes aloft were estimated at $30 million yearly.
   Passenger traffic gradually increased. Operations were
streamlined and the Concorde showed its first profit in 1986.
   In 1987, Air France showed a net profit of more than $14.2
million from the Concorde's regular Paris-New York run and from
charter flights. Figures for 1988 are not yet available.
   Last year, 42,379 passengers took the three-hour Paris-New York
flight, which got them to New York two hours before they left.
   The flight is $4,856 round-trip, compared to $3,986 for a
regular, round-trip first-class seat.
   Faced with the early unprofitablity of the jet, the high cost of
fueling it and opposition from environmental groups opposed to the
noise, the United States and other countries chose to stay out of
the supersonic marketplace.
   But if U.S. airlines don't fly the planes, U.S. passengers do.
Air France and British Airways say more than half their clients last
year were Americans.
