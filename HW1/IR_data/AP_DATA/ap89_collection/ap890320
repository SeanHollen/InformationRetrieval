<HEAD>Denver Minister Threatens To Drop Boy Scouts Over Homosexual Stance</HEAD>

   A Denver minister said Monday that he would drop
his church's sponsorship of a Boy Scout troop unless the
organization reverses itself and allows a homosexual man to serve on
the troop's parents committee.
   ``I believe the Boy Scout law is a correct one _ to serve God and
country,'' said the Rev. Edward Ostertag, rector of St. Barnabas
Episcopal Church.
   ``But I don't think God or my country trashes people. If the Boy
Scouts have departed from that, they should let the sponsoring
agencies know they have departed from that old law.''
   Ostertag said the homosexual man, who has a son in Troop 13, was
one of 16 people appointed to the parents committee, which
supervises the activities of the 35 scouts in the troop.
   He said the Boy Scout organization revoked the man's registration
after learning that he was an admitted homosexual. Ostertag would
not name the father.
   The Boy Scouts of America has upheld the decision at the district
and regional levels. The case now is before the National Council of
the Boy Scouts, Ostertag said.
   Barclay Bollas, a spokesman at the organization's national
headquarters in Irving, Texas, said Monday that the Boy Scouts of
America has a policy barring membership to homosexuals and has
invoked that policy before.
   ``We do not believe homosexuals make appropriate leaders for a
youth organization like the Boy Scouts,'' Bollas said.
   Both the troop committee and the parents of the scouts have voted
to support Ostertag's campaign on behalf of the man.
   Ostertag said it is not easy finding volunteers who will take
scouts on camping trips and oversee their work on merit badges,
especially in Denver's Capitol Hill neighborhood, where many
residents are single.
   ``This is Holy Week, and I feel uncomfortable celebrating Good
Friday and then having to turn around to this man and say, `You're
trash, and we don't want you around,''' the minister said. ``I don't
go for that.''

   President Bush on Monday defended his lifelong
membership in the National Rifle Association while voicing support
for a ``constitutionally sound'' further crackdown on semiautomatic
weapons.
   ``We are in different times now and I am convinced that
reasonable men and women can work together to find an answer to the
problem,'' he told a group of women state legislators at the White
House.
   Meanwhile, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater called
for a cooling down of emotions in the gun-control dispute, saying
``the president feels we don't need to be threatening each other.''
   He was referring to news reports that NRA officials had
indirectly threatened drug czar Bill Bennett with political
retaliation if he pursues a course toward more firearms restrictions
_ allegations that the gun owner's lobby denied anew Monday.
   ``This is not a time to be threatening people, but rather a time
to try to work together to solve a problem that clearly needs to be
solved,'' Fitzwater said.
   While considering gun measures, Bush is also looking at moves to
fight the drug problem in the nation's capital, including the
possible use of federal troops, the New York Times reported.
   Bush is willing to consider bringing in the National Guard under
federal command, or using regular military forces, if the District
of Columbia police force is unable to curb Washington's mounting
murder rate, the newspaper reported in its Tuesday editions.
   The administration has not detailed how the Guard might be used,
the newspaper said.
   The administration last week announced it was banning the import
of semiautomatic weapons. Bush had said the move reflected a ``pulse
change'' on his part on the subject of gun control, which in the
past he has steadfastly opposed.
   ``Clearly there's been some evolution of his (Bush's) thinking''
on gun control, Fitzwater said Monday.
   Bush has directed Bennett to review the entire subject of
semiautomatic weapons. Fitzwater said that neither an expansion of
the ban nor other new restrictions on guns would be proposed during
the overall review that Bennett is overseeing.
   The president told his audience: ``On the NRA, of which I'm a
member _ a proud member, I might add _ I believe that we can find
accommodation between the legitimate interests of the sportsman and
the interest of the police chiefs in protecting their people who put
their lives on the line every single day.''
   ``The country needs to know that there is some answer to this. I
don't yet know what it is,'' he said.
   While much of the answer rests with the states, ``we have a
responsibility'' at the federal level as well, Bush said.
   ``We have got to give the police proper support when they lay
their lives on the line for us. And so we'll find some answer that
is constitutionally sound and that also protects the lives, as best
one can from Washington, of police officers.''
   Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity told The Associated
Press last week that Bennett had been receiving warnings from the
rifle association through third parties hinting that NRA's campaign
fund-raising abilities might be used against him if he ever sought
political office.
   Bennett said through a spokesman, Don Hamilton, that ``there have
been a lot of phone calls, a lot of pressure. Let's cool off.''
   Wayne LaPierre, legislative director for the NRA, insisted Monday
that ``we never made a threat in the first place. It's not the way
we operate, it's not the way the NRA functions. I don't know how to
be any clearer than that.''
   He said that the NRA shares the nation's ``heightened outrage
about violent crime'' on the nation's streets. ``We want to be a
part of the solution, we're going to be in there in a constructive
way.''
   But, he said in an interview, ``we don't believe we should be
pushed into a cosmetic solution that won't address the real issues
and won't solve the real problems.''
   ``There's nothing new about semiautomatic firearms. They've been
around for a century,'' he said. He claimed the problem was failure
to use existing laws to prosecute drug dealers who use guns
illegally. ``It's not that we don't know who these people are: they
glow in the dark.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle, meanwhile, said he had not heard about
alleged NRA threats against Bennett but ``if they're saying that
they shouldn't.''
   ``Bill Bennett's doing a good job. The president is very serious
about what he has had to say,'' Quayle said.

   The right-wing Republican
Nationalist Alliance claimed victory in Sunday's presidential
election scarred by clashes between rebels and troops that left at
least 29 dead. Three journalists also were killed.
   The alliance, known as Arena, said its candidate gained more than
50 percent of the vote.
   That would be enough to avoid a runoff election next month
against the incumbent Christian Democrats.
   ``We are sure and we proclaim oursevles the victors,'' Roberto
D'Aubuisson, founder of Arena, told a news conference.
   Arena presidential candidate Alfredo Cristiani said the party had
results from 75 percent of the polling places and he was assured of
victory.
   Election authorities said preliminary officials results were
expected Monday.
   A boycott by leftist rebels and scattered gun battles between
guerrillas and troops trimmed the voter turnout.
   Six soldiers and 23 guerrillas were killed in battles as the
rebels tried to disrupt the voting, according to Col. Emilio Ponce,
chief of the joint chiefs of staff.
   Two Salvadoran journalists and a Dutch television cameraman also
were killed _ one during clash at a rebel-held town and the others
at military checkpoints.
   Christian Democratic candidate Fidel Chavez Mena had said he
expected to do better in the countryside than in the capital, but
San Salvador's Channel 12 television station said Cristiani was
running strongly enough to win a clear majority.
   The Christian Democrat headquarters was virtually deserted Sunday
night and the party provided no results.
   ``We have the 50 percent that is needed to win and I can assure
you there will be no second round,'' said D'Aubuisson. ``I am proud
to have been able to carry such a good and capable man as Freddy
Cristiani to the presidency.''
   Critics claim Arena is still controlled by D'Aubuisson, a retired
army major who has been accused of having links with rightist death
squads. D'Aubuisson has repeatedly denied the allegations.
   Polls closed at 5 p.m. (6 p.m. EST). There was no official word
on turnout, but a spot check by The Associated Press at several
polling places in San Salvador showed between 55 and 65 percent of
those registered had cast ballots.
   Ana Guadalupe Martinez, a rebel spokeswoman in Mexico City, said
enough people had stayed away from the polls to prove that no
election could be held without participation by the guerrillas'
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
   She said no polling places or voters had been attacked, as the
guerrillas had pledged, but rebel assaults on government
installations prevented the army from taking voters to the polls.
   The guerrillas had imposed a transport ban and sabotaged
telephone lines and electricity, which cut or restricted power to 80
percent of the country.
   Roman Catholic churches were crowded with Palm Sunday worshipers
and by midday there were long lines of voters at polling stations in
San Salvador. Turnout was light in many smaller towns.
   ``With these problems it's better to stay home,'' said Jose
Carlos Ortiz, 23. He spoke in front of his home in the capital as
guerrillas retreated from an assault on a military post three blocks
away.
   Sporadic rifle fire echoed from the slope of the Guazapa volcano,
a guerrilla stronghold north of San Salvador, as troops fought
insurgents in the 9-year-old war that has claimed an estimated
70,000 lives.
   There were seven presidential candidates and the three major ones
were Cristiani, Chavez Mena and Guillermo Ungo of the leftist
Democratic Convergence.
   Christiani and Chavez Mena were the only contenders with a chance
to win.
   Christian Democrat President Jose Napoleon Duarte's five-year
term ends June 1. Duarte, barred by law from running for
re-election, is Washington's staunchest ally in Central America. He
is dying of liver cancer.
   Cristiani has vowed to follow free-market policies and reduce
state intervention in the eonomy. His party promised to step up the
war if the guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front do not agree to lay down their arms.
   Cristiani voted Sunday morning in San Salvador and told a group
of his supporters, ``I hope the United States realizes that
(Salvadorans) want democracy, with this effort they're making to
vote. We don't want any more bombs.''
   Chavez Mena is a lawyer and heads the Christian Democrats'
conservative wing. He struggled against opposition charges of
corruption in the government and inability of the Christian
Democrats to deal with the economy and the civil war.
   Leaders of the Democratic Convergence maintain formal links with
the guerrillas. This is the first election since 1977 in which
socialist candidates have competed.
   About 1.83 million people out of a population of 5 million were
eligible to vote. Polls opened at 7 a.m. in 243 of the country's 262
municipalities and closed at 5 p.m.
   Nineteen towns in the north did not set up voting stations
because election officials deemed those rebel-held zones too
dangerous.
   In San Sebastian, 30 miles east of the capital, turnout was light.
   ``The people are frightened,'' said William Doherty of the
American AFL-CIO. ``There is no question that the intimidation by
the (guerrillas) is working.''
   Doherty is one of 21 congressmen, state politicians and private
citizens named by the White House to be official election observers.
He said turnout Sunday was ``far less'' than during three previous
elections he attended this decade.
   Cornel Lagrouw, a cameraman for Dutch national television, was
killed as army troops moved to oust guerrillas occupying the eastern
town of San Francisco Javier, said Bill Gentile, a U.S. photographer
for Newsweek.
   Lagrouw was part of a group of six journalists and two drivers
who were in the town. The others dragged him away and fled in two
cars, but they came under repeated helicopter fire despite press
markings and white flags on the vehicles, Gentile said.
   The military said it had no immediate information on the report.
   Two Salvadoran journalists were killed and another seriously
wounded when security forces fired on their vehicles. The armed
forces said the vehicles failed to heed orders to stop at roadblocks.
   In the March 1988 elections for the National Assembly, Arena won
32 seats, the Christian Democrats 23 and the National Conciliation
Party six. But a group called the Authentic Christian Movement split
from the Christian Democrats, taking 16 seats from Duarte's faction.
The next legislative elections are set for March 1991.

   A 2-year-old boy plunged 15 floors
down a rubbish chute inside a Penang city apartment building but
suffered only bruises when he landed on a pile of garbage, a
newspaper reported today.
   The daily New Straits Times said that Firdaus Zainal Abidin was
playing other children Monday when the youngster's sister told their
father the boy was missing.
   The boy's father, Army Cpl. Zainal Abidin Saad, said he looked
everywhere for the boy before noticing the rubbish chute was open,
the newspaper reported.
   Zainal rushed down to the ground floor and found his son face
down and crying on top of the rubbish, the newspaper said.
   He rushed his son to the hospital, where doctors examined him and
sent him home, saying he had no injury other than bruises on his
forehead and elbow, the New Straits Times said.

   Laura Goldin wants to substitute five words
in the state civil code with two words that supporters say would
undo years of anti-gay discrimination and opponents say would
undermine society's structure.
   The change Goldin wrote in a proposed code revision, unanimously
endorsed by the Bar Association of San Francisco's directors, would
define marriage as a ``personal relation arising out of a civil
contract between two people.''
   Under the law now, it's between ``a man and a woman.''
   The change would have let Larry Brinkin take a three-day leave
after the death of his lover of 11 years. His employer wouldn't let
him off, though a co-worker got time off for the death of a
stepmother he had never met.
   It would have made it easier for Donna Hitchens and her partner
to adopt. Hitchens, an attorney, had to become the child's guardian,
leaving her partner with no legal parental authority until they
successfully challenged the law; ultimately, they legally adopted
two children.
   It also would force hospitals to allow a gay AIDS patient's lover
into intensive care. Many only let in relatives.
   Gay couples live in a ``limbo-like state outside of the law,''
said Peter Keane, president of the local association. ``It's a
pariah-type class that's set up within the law. To me, it's an
unfairness issue.''
   Redefining marriage to include homosexuals would grant all the
rights, privileges _ and burdens _ of marriage to gay couples. Among
the areas affected if the proposal is made into law are tax
exemptions, inheritance laws, pensions and health plans, as well as
parenting privileges and adoption rights.
   ``We're not for it,'' said Deacon Norman D. Phillips, spokesman
for Catholic Archbishop John Quinn. ``To us, marriage is a sacrament
with deeply religious overtones. Our church believes marriage can
only be entered into by a male and a female.'' Quinn believes some
inequities may warrant compensation, but calls for use of contracts
``that don't establish a quasi-marriage.''
   The resolution must survive two local reviews to be considered by
the State Bar Conference of Delegates in September, when about 500
representatives of the state's 117,000 lawyers will consider and
propose new laws and and plan repeal efforts. If it passes, Bar
lobbyists will seek a legislative sponsor.
   The specification of ``a man and a woman'' became law in 1977
after a spate of gay marriages, which weren't prohibited then. Under
the amendment signed by Gov. Jerry Brown, homosexuals have little
say regarding partners' medical care and cannot share insurance
coverage or health benefits.
   In West Hollywood, the first U.S. city governed by a majority of
gay city officials, unmarried city employees may add their partners
to health benefit and pension plans. Berkeley and Santa Cruz offer
similar benefits.
   In San Francisco, where an estimated 10 percent of residents are
gay, Board of Supervisors President Harry Britt, the panel's only
gay member, has spent years trying to provide sweeping rights to
``alternative families.''
   Goldin, who is not gay, is a member of the bar association. She
said her proposal also would include child custody, community
property and spousal support obligations.
   Supporters don't anticipate throngs of gay couples flocking to
the altar, but they insist that everyone should have the opportunity
_ and equal rights.
   Auto insurance companies that offer family reductions exclude
homosexuals and unmarried heterosexual couples, and income tax laws
favor married couples in some ways, according to Karen Strauss of
the Lesbian Rights Project.
   ``So long as benefits are given or taken away based on
relationship status, then we want access to them as well,'' said
Cynthia Goldstein, an attorney with National Gay Rights Advocates.
   Like many lesbians, Hitchens says she would marry if she could.
After 12 years with her partner and two adopted children, she said
economics _ not emotion _ would prompt her to tie the legal knot.
   Brinkin, who lost a court battle against his employer over
bereavement leave for the death of Richard Reich, isn't sure whether
he would marry. ``My commitment comes from my heart and I don't need
a piece of paper to do that.''
   Advocates of the change say the issue is purely a question of
law, that the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment of the
Constitution prohibits discrimination against classes of people and
should cover homosexuals.
   ``My guess is that the debate is going to be much more
sociological than legal,'' said Colin Wied, president of the State
Bar. ``Society would recoil at this idea. My guess is that lawyers
will follow suit.''

   Miguel Braschi and Leslie Blanchard were
regarded by friends as a loving couple, their Manhattan apartment
the home of ``any happily married couple.'' But Braschi faces
eviction because their landlord disagrees.
   When Blanchard died in Braschi's arms in 186, Blanchard's name
was on the lease to the rent-controlled apartment the two men had
shared for a decade.
   Leases pass from parent to child or spouse to spouse under the
rent control laws in New York City's tight and pricy real estate
market. Braschi says that as a ``family member'' he should have
succession rights even though his name wasn't on the lease.
   The landlord, Stahl Associates Co., maintains Braschi had no
right to the desirable apartment because he was not a member of
Blanchard's ``traditional family unit ... those related by blood,
marriage or adoption.''
   According to Thomas Stoddard, executive director of the Lambda
Legal Defense Fund, a gay rights group, ``The case is about
individuals who live in families that vary from the Ozzie and
Harriet mold.''
   State court Judge Harold Baer ruled that the men were a family
under the rent-control law because of ``the time, love and
commitment given by Braschi to Blanchard.'' Baer halted the
eviction, but was overturned on appeal. The Court of Appeals, New
York's highest court, will hear arguments April 26.
   Braschi is allowed to stay in the apartment while the case is in
court.
   ``It's not just a question for gay people,'' Stoddard said.
``It's an issue about the right of each individual to enter into a
non-traditional, non-orthodox relationship and be protected by the
law.''
   The Court of Appeals must decide whether people in
non-traditional living arrangements _ homosexuals, unmarried
heterosexuals, even elderly couples _ have the same protection as
married couples and blood relatives.
   The court ruled in 1984 that one member of a homosexual couple
couldn't adopt the other to keep from being evicted from an
apartment that only allowed family members to live together.
   ``This is the most important case in the country dealing with
non-traditional family arrangements,'' said Stoddard. The court's
decision could affect insurance, hospital visiting rights,
inheritance and other areas in which the definition of ``family'' is
crucial.
   Blanchard had hired Braschi to manage his exclusive Manhattan
beauty salon and made him sole beneficiary, leaving him $5 million.
   Braschi and Blanchard exchanged bracelets in 1977 as a symbol of
their commitment. Braschi, 33, now wears both.
   He cared for Blanchard during the final months of his life and
was holding Blanchard in his arms when he died in September 1986.
Braschi, 33, says he and Blanchard ``regarded one another ... as
spouses.''
   ``Their friends regarded them as a `married couple' and their
apartment as `the home of any happily married couple,''' according
to court papers.
   Stahl Associates has argued that the Legislature never extended
succession rights to ``members of a non-traditional family unit,''
and has accused Braschi of trying to turn the case into a
``referendum on homosexual rights.''
   Braschi's lawyers say Stahl is trying to create that impression
``to prejudice the atmosphere,'' and that the case is simply about
family rights.
   ``What this case is about is people's relationships, whether they
will be protected, based on the strength of the relationship,'' said
Nan Hunter, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which
represents Braschi.
   ``It (speaks) in terms of family relationships. Family would be
not just spouses. You're protected under this law if it's your
uncle.''

   A wing of the International Arrivals Building at
John F. Kennedy International Airport was evacuated Sunday night
after an airline received a bomb threat and a suspicious bag was
found, authorities said.
   The threat turned out to be false and police from the bomb squad
determined that the bag did not contain a bomb, said Port Authority
Police Officer Phillip Montuori.
   Shortly after the bag was found sitting in the departure level of
Aer Lingus airline with no apparent owner, a telephone bomb threat
was received by Egyptair airline, said Port Authority Police Officer
Robert Ebert. The anonymous caller told Egyptair that a bomb was set
to explode at 10:05 p.m. in the arrivals building, Ebert said.
   Some 300 to 400 people were evacuated from the east wing of the
building at about 8:20 p.m., Ebert said. They were permitted to
return at about 10 p.m., he said.
   Ebert said the scare ``delayed whatever flights were there for
several hours, whatever flights would have been going out of the
east wing. The Egyptair flight that was going to take off didn't
until the whole thing was over.''
   No information was available on the bag's contents and police
could not immediately determine its owner, Ebert said.

   Those who doubted opera is for
high-brows got a sharp reminder at a casting call for a production
of Verdi's ``Aida.''
   About 2,000 people hoping to play soldiers, slaves and other
extra roles in the extravaganza planned for next month began lining
up in the rain at 6 a.m. Saturday for auditions at B.C. Place
Stadium. Ads seeking extras had said the minimum height requirement
for women was 5-feet-2 and 5-feet-8 for men.
   But when the stadium doors opened four hours later, the women
were told anyone under 5-foot-6 was out of luck.
   ``We started a mass rebellion,'' said student June Derlachter,
who is 5-feet-4{.
   After haggling, folks 5-foot-4 and above were told they could
stay.
   ``A lot of short people cheated by wearing high heels,''
complained Ms. Derlachter, who made it inside but was not among the
503 people selected.
   Production manager Serge Bilodeau said he could not explain how
the mixup on heights occurred.
   The two-day production of the opera about Aida's romance during a
war between Egypt and Ethiopia is scheduled for April 27 and 29.

   This town's one-man police force says
officials have idled his squad car because he won't turn the town
into a speed trap.
   ``Out of gas: mayor and city council refuse to buy gas'' reads a
plywood sign on top of the car parked at Melvin Villemarette's house.
   ``They're wishing that I'd quit. But I'm too old in this game to
quit that easy,'' said Villemarette, police chief and only officer
in this central Louisiana village of about 800.
   Villemarette claims Mayor Nathan Jeansonne and the Board of
Aldermen want him out of office and have heated up a long-running
feud over speeding tickets since he won re-election in October to a
third term. He says he encouraged two part-time patrolmen to quit by
giving them bad working hours after the board urged the officers to
set traps.
   ``They'd park on the edge of town near the speed zone signs. A
person from Marksville comes cruising in ... and they would stop
that person, no questions asked. To me, that's a big ripoff.
   ``Or they would be hiding in the brush waiting for a nice little
family to come down. I don't go for all that malarkey,'' the police
chief said.
   But Jeansonne said the board decided to allocate $50 a month for
gasoline instead of reimbursing the chief an average of $275 a month
because the squad car is driven much less.
   ``Most times, his car is parked at City Hall or the Baptist
church,'' Alderman James Gauthier complained.
   While the dispute simmers, Villemarette said, he will use his own
car to answer police calls. And Gauthier said Avoyelles Parish
Sheriff Bill Belt has agreed to patrol the town.

<TEXT>
   The selection of a shrewd,
affable pragmatist as President P.W. Botha's successor is
contributing to a surge of hope for a peaceful breakthrough in South
Africa's political stalemate.
   So far, however, the optimistic musings are coming almost
exclusively from whites.
   Black leaders make clear they will be relieved when Botha steps
down. But they suspect his heir apparent, F.W. de Klerk, will
preside over changes more cosmetic than substantive.
   Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Zulu political leader denounced by many
black activists as too conservative, says he will oppose de Klerk
until the government gives blacks full voting rights. There is no
sign de Klerk contemplates such action.
   At the other end of the black political spectrum, the African
National Congress guerrilla movement says changes under de Klerk
will be in personal style, not National Party policy.
   De Klerk and Botha ``are pieces of the same carcass,'' spokesman
Tom Sebina said from the outlawed movement's exile headquarters in
Lusaka, Zambia. ``If the meat is bad, the meat is bad.''
   Botha, 73, resumed his presidential duties last week after an
eight-week convalescence from a stroke. In the interim, he resigned
as National Party leader and was replaced by de Klerk, the minister
of national education.
   In a dramatic chain of events, Nationalist newspapers and
politicians began suggesting that Botha should retire, Botha
responded by declaring he would stay in office until next year, and
the party's parliamentary caucus resolved that it wanted de Klerk to
be president.
   However, the party has neither the constitutional power nor the
appetite to force Botha from office. De Klerk said Friday he will
seek cordial coexistence with the president while urging his party
to ``break new ground'' in pursuing political reform.
   De Klerk, who turned 53 Saturday, has never been viewed as
liberal. But supporters and skeptics alike depict him as more
open-minded and less imperious than Botha, who has headed the
government since 1978.
   After becoming party leader, de Klerk called for a South Africa
``free of domination and oppression.'' Other party officials say at
least some remaining apartheid laws _ those segregating residential
areas and public facilities _ may be modified.
   Helen Suzman, long-serving legislator for the anti-apartheid
Progressive Federal Party, said of de Klerk: ``People are being too
optimistic if they think he is going to throw fundamental policy
overboard.''
   ``But I think he's pragmatic and intelligent,'' she said. ``He
realizes that change is absolutely inevitable, that the sooner we
get on with it, the more chance there is that change and reform will
be accomplished peacefully.''
   De Klerk does not have the same close ties to the military and
police that Botha nurtured. But he is committed firmly to
segregating neighborhoods and schools for whites who want them, and
his proposal for ``genuine power sharing'' with blacks as yet has no
substance.
   His ascendency coincides with other developments that have
induced the broadest optimism about South Africa since black unrest
broke out in 1984. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said
last week ``encouraging changes'' were unfolding in South Africa.
   These include major foreign policy initiatives, such as
independence for Namibia and rapprochement with Mozambique after
prolonged hostility. But anti-apartheid leaders view seemingly
notable domestic developments with skepticism. For example, a
government-appointed law commission attracted international
publicity this month by calling for a bill of rights, abolition of
apartheid laws and full voting rights for blacks. Human rights
activists doubted the proposals would be implemented, and the
government reacted with silence.
   Similarly, black clergymen were unimpressed when delegates from
the white Dutch Reformed Church, to which most National Party
officials belong, issued a statement describing apartheid as a sin.
Last week the full policy-making body of the Afrikaner church balked
at endorsing the delegates' stance.
   The government spurned recent suggestions by Dutch Reformed
Church leader Johan Heyns and Beeld, a major Afrikaans-language
newspaper, that it drop its demand the ANC renounce violence before
negotiations are held. There is no indication jailed ANC leader
Nelson Mandela will be freed soon.
   One of the most informed assessments of de Klerk came in a recent
magazine article by his brother, Willem, a former newspaper editor
who quit the National Party out of disenchantment with apartheid.
   Willem de Klerk described his brother as ``fair, friendly and
humble,'' but committed to the ideology of separating racial groups.
   ``If F.W can give the National Party a new credibility among all
population groups, and in international politics, he will herald a
breakthrough toward a new future. But if he continues along the old
path, he will merely be a transitional figure who will let us keep
treading water,'' he said.

<HEAD>Mayor's Security Staff Babysit, Run Errands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Washington Mayor Marion Barry's security force
often erforms duties such as babysitting, running personal errands
and soliciting home telephone numbers from new female acquaintances,
The Washington Post reports.
   The Post, in its Monday editions, said two city-paid security
officials babysat the mayor's son and a playmate while the mayor was
in a hotel 20 minutes away during a trip to the Virgin Islands last
year.
   The paper quoted a model identified as Grace T. Shell as saying
that one of the mayor's security officers approached her for her
telephone number in 1987.
   About two dozen security officers make up the $1 million-a-year
detail.
   The paper said police officials have voiced concern that the
mayor often requires the officers to station themselves a few blocks
away or at the police garage where the security detail is based.
   ``The security detail should not be leaving the mayor anywhere,''
the paper quoted one high-ranking police official as saying.
   Mayoral spokesman John White said he had received no official
notification of any practice of using security officers for
babysitting or personal errands while Barry is left unprotected.
   White said it is important for the mayor to be adequately
protected, adding, ``From time to time, the mayor has had threats
against his life and his family.
   Barry has been dogged by recent allegations that he has used
drugs and by charges of drug-selling lodged in the Virgin Islands
against a former associate, Charles Lewis, whom Barry had visited
several times at a Washington hotel in December. The mayor has
repeatedly denied using drugs or having any knowledge of any
possible drug connection involving Lewis.

   By day, she was a lowly House of Commons
researcher. By night, she dated a government minister and newspaper
editors, and mingled with the upper crust.
   With the allegation that she's also a call girl, it all adds up
to the kind of yarn on which Britain's tabloid newspapers thrive.
And if the headlines are to be believed, this one even has a Libyan
connection.
   According to the stories dominating front pages in recent days,
the striking former Miss India worked as a part-time researcher for
Conservative Party lawmaker David Shaw from late December to late
February.
   The job, apparently involving research for legislation Shaw
sponsored to end price-fixing in the book trade, entitled the
27-year-old aide to a security pass that gave her access to much of
the House of Commons.
   On Sunday, the News of the World alleged the woman _ identified
variously as Pamella Bordes, Pamella Bardes and Pamela Singh _ also
works as a call girl, charging at least $860 a night. The newspaper
attributed its information to an ``investigator'' who spoke with her
in a hotel bedroom.
   Other newspapers rushed into print with an array of pictures of
dark-maned Miss Bordes hobnobbing with the London glitterati.
   They reprinted pictures of her as Sports Minister Colin
Moynihan's date at the Conservative Party Winter Ball. There were
photos of her out and about with Andrew Neil, editor of The Sunday
Times and at a party with Donald Trelford, editor of the rival
Observer.
   No one has suggested there is anything wrong with Miss Bordes
seeing the high and mighty after hours. But on Friday, the tabloid
Evening Standard introduced a new element: Libya.
   Quoting a close, unidentified friend of Miss Bordes, the Standard
said she ``is believed to have close social links with one of
revolutionary Libyan leader Colonel (Moammar) Gadhafi's closest
aides.''
   It said she made regular trips to Paris to meet Ahmed Gadaff al
Daim, whom the paper identified as a cousin of Gadhafi and a major
in the Libyan security service.
   The paper quoted a security source as confirming that al Daim's
movements are monitored in the West and claimed Miss Bordes made
several visits to Tripoli by private jet.
   ``The news will have grave security implications for the British
government,'' opined the Standard, and some lawmakers were quick to
agree.
   Ted Leadbitter of the opposition Labor Party, an expert on
espionage, said: ``The persistent reports linking Pamella Bordes
with people in prominent positions _ and more recently actually
touching upon areas of possible security risk _ suggest, if true,
the urgency of the government undertaking the fullest possible
pressing and penetrating inquiry.''
   The Today newspaper has already dubbed Miss Bordes ``the new
Keeler,'' referring to the former call girl whose simultaneous
affairs with War Minister John Profumo and a Soviet diplomat rocked
a British government 26 years ago.
   On Thursday, The Sun, Britain's largest circulation newspaper,
quoted an acquaintance, David Sullivan, as saying Miss Bardes told
him: ``My secrets could bring down the government, just like
Christine Keeler did.''
   What these ``secrets'' might be, nobody knows. Miss Bordes has
not publicly commented on her newfound notoriety and has not
surfaced in public.
   But if she was correctly quoted, said Labor's Dale
Campbell-Savors, ``then I'm sure many members of Parliament will
wonder, to put it bluntly, what the hell is going on.''
   Her security pass was yanked as soon as her name hit the
headlines, and House of Commons security rules are to be tightened
next month.

<HEAD>Lacroix's Byzantine Luxury</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian-in-Wonderland did it again.
   After the patchwork blaze of color in his winter ready-to-wear
collection last week, Christian Lacroix topped his own act Sunday
with a second show, the more expensive and sublime ``luxe''
collection.
   Often capping the outfits with his favorite ``Mad Hatter'' hat,
he showed rich clothes in the line he nicknamed ``jogging to
Byzantium.''
   Lacroix led off with a bronze taffeta belted trench coat with a
grand fox collar, followed up by a tangerine long wraparound skirt
topped with a beaver-collared raspberry jacket.
   Soft imitation leopard added more deluxe touches to jacket
linings, big stoles and an occasional turban cap.
   Little short fitted suits with flared bell skirts came out in
stained-glass shades of Persian Killim rug patterns.
   His favorite trapeze-shaped topper looked great with deep mink
cuffs on hot orange-red bouclette wool over a mildly flared skirt.
   A fabulous, egg-shaped, carnation pink, iridescent taffeta coat
over a salmon satin suit was breathtaking.
   For evening wear, rich women might choose the strapless dresses
in ``Fortuny'' panne velvets with strapless bosoms draped in lame.
   The gold of Byzantium was shot through the collection, even for
evening blazers with paisley patterns in the brocade. And Goldfinger
himself couldn't have faulted the shimmering lame trouser outfit
with flared pants.
   Never one to shy away from color and opulence, Lacroix laid on
both in plenty, especially for evening. But he did it with such a
light touch that the audience was dazzled.
   The grand finale was a group of Oriental ``odalisque'' outfits
with harem pants in turquoise, red and gold iridescent panne velvets.
   Meanwhile, this versatile designer is already well into his next
project: designing 350 costumes for a spectacular production of
``Carmen'' to take place in early July in the ancient arena at
Nimes, near Lacroix's native Arles in Provence.
   This time, he's putting all his inventiveness into costumes for
the American stars of the opera, Grace Bumbry and Neil Shicoff,
singing ``Carmen'' and ``Don Jose.''
   ``I grew up with Carmen, a very sexy lady and the first woman in
my life,'' Lacroix said in an interview. ``Her outfits will be in
gold and white, coral shades and earth colors, depending on the
act.''
   One sure thing: with Lacroix dressing her, Miss Bumbry won't look
like the down-and-out cigarette girl she will play.
   Japanese designer Hanae Mori showed a gently demure collection
under the rotunda of the old commodities market.
   The most ``French'' of Oriental designers and the only one to
show haute couture as well went in strongly for feminine shapes and
soft fabrics.
   Her navy pinstriped coat-dresses, suits with skirts and pants
couldn't have been more classic.
   Diagonally-striped black and turquoise knit outfits were lively
but never out of line, lengths just around knee level.
   Like designers all over town, Miss Mori is seeing spots for next
winter, and imitation leopard surged up here in flyaway trapeze
shortie coats over narrow black skirts and animal-spotted stockings.
   For a touch of hot jazz, she showed puffy Tibetan lamb coats dyed
in amethyst, royal blue and shocking pink.
   Iridescent taffeta dresses with cloche-shaped skirts over mounds
of crinolines harked back to tea-dances for debutantes in the 1950s.
   More interesting were the evening outfits in Hanae Mori's forte,
flower-printed silks. This time they were beautiful and bold, in
turquoise, peacock, flame with gold, borrowed from the best of
Japanese kimono fabrics.
   On Easter Sunday, Miss Mori will celebrate the opening of her new
shop in Monte Carlo, by presenting the collection at a charity gala
for ``Les Oeuvres de Soeur Marie,'' which benefits underprivileged
and elderly people. Princess Caroline will host the event for about
700 guests.
   Maryll Lanvin's collection was eclectic, bright and attractive,
aimed at women who frequent the best shops, clubs and restaurants.
As usual, the clothes were young and well-cut, mainstream rather
than trend-setting.
   Navy and big bands of violet piping were combined happily in a
daytime group that had short flannel skirts, pants, shetland blazers
and boleros.
   Worth noting were her big, bold diagonal plaids, in shades of
yellow, red, emerald, purple. Fuzzy plaid mohair coats and flyaway
short trapeze coats looked outstanding over suits with long shetland
jackets and lean dark skirts.
   Another new plaid was multicolored windowpane style on a dark
boucle fabric. It was striking in suits with both pants and short or
longer skirts - the easy alternatives here.
   The shimmering dresses with hip-bloused tops and leg o'mutton
sleeves or shifts were looked pleasingly different in their outsized
paisley patterns.
   Sleekly fitted moire dresses in gem colors with short skirts
flaring at the hem are made to order for little dinners or big
cocktail parties.
   And Lanvin's late-day wear was best in fitted quilted silk
jackets with splatter motifs on very bright colors over dark silk
jersey skirts or flowing pajamas.

<HEAD>A Mammoth Second Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OXFORD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 5,000 ``new'' words in the second
edition of the Oxford English Dictionary say more about the glacial
pace of lexicography than about the age of the words.
   There are freshly minted terms such as AIDS-related, antiquark,
fax, Filofax and ghetto-blaster; words or word senses redolent of
the 1960s such as acid, downer, grok and chopper, and jazz-age
coinages such as Big Apple.
   There's even one new word from Anglo-Saxon: ``ash,'' the symbol
that combines the letters A and E.
   The second edition, to be published March 29, reflects more than
a century of scholarly labor.
   It pulls together the 400,000 entries in the first edition,
completed between 1879 and 1928; the first supplement of 1933; the
four-volume second supplement of 1972-1986; and the 5,000 new
entries.
   That chronology explains why the OED took so long to catch up
with ``Big Apple,'' New York City's nickname.
   The first use of the term recorded by the dictionary is in 1927,
though ``we've since heard there was record of it in 1906,'' said
John Simpson, the co-editor responsible for new words in the second
edition.
   ``Now, in the first edition of OED the letter B came out in 1885,
1886, so (Big Apple) wasn't available for inclusion then.
   ``I think it was a pity it wasn't included in the supplement.
Perhaps it wasn't really widely well known. I don't know.''
   Simpson also doesn't know why his entry for ``Pythonesque,''
inspired by the satirical lunacies of comedy troupe called Monty
Python's Flying Circus, was ultimately rejected by Robert
Burchfield, editor of the second supplement.
   ``So I thought, I've had enough of that, so I put it back in
again for the second edition,'' Simpson said. ``Nobody objected so
it's gone in.''
   Also inducted: acid rain, acupressure, barf, bleeper, creation
science, detox, Diner's Club, dingbat, duty-free, endangered, est,
fast track, foxy, Great Leap Forward, greenmail, lap-top, nose job,
passive smoking, plastic money and Visa.
   From now on, the 20-volume dictionary will be subject to rapid
updating because this edition was prepared on a computer. Oxford
University Press hopes to offer it on computer discs by 1991.
   The computer version will solve the age-old problem of looking up
a word you can't remember. The computer can look for definitions,
and much more.
   The basic work of lexicography, however, is still done on index
cards, now numbering in excess of 3 million, each containing a
quotation found by a paid or volunteer reader to illustrate the use
of a word.
   The method is the same used by James A.H. Murray, the first
editor of the OED, who took on what was supposed to be a 10-year
task in 1879 and had completed the letter T at his death in 1915.
   Murray, who appears in photos looking like an Old Testament
figure in mortarboard and long white beard, instructed his
researchers to ``make a quotation for every word that strikes you as
rare, obsolete, old-fashioned, new, peculiar, or used in a peculiar
way.'' They were also asked to produce as many quotations as
possible for ordinary words.
   The OED surveys English from the middle of the 12th century, and
the research net covered the United States, Australasia, India and
the English-speaking parts of Africa and the Caribbean.
   ``We regard the OED as an international dictionary now,'' said
co-editor Edmund Weiner.
   That's reflected in its production. The dictionary was edited in
Oxford, the computer program was developed by the University of
Waterloo in Ontario, the text was keyboarded in Fort Washington,
Pa., and the 10,000 sets, each weighing 137.7 pounds, were printed
in Taunton, Mass.
   It's hard to explain exactly when a word becomes so widely used
that it qualifies for the OED, Weiner said, but in practice words
are almost always added by consensus, based on citations from
printed sources.
   ``It is not our job to lay down what standard English is,'' said
Weiner, but to produce a photograph of English as it is used.
   ``The dictionary records the language, warts and all,'' Simpson
said. ``I would say we don't prescribe ourselves, but we try to make
it obvious in the entries if you are dealing with a particular use
that a group of people dislike.''
   If a word is misused enough, it may rate an entry. Thus,
contractural, a common misspelling of contractual, earned a citation
in the OED, Simpson said.
   Some day, it may be the standard spelling.
   `Over history, over and over again, you see what was originally a
non-standard variation becoming standard, and the standard one
becoming old-fashioned and falling out of use,'' Weiner said.
   ``These days, `disinterested' is condemned when being used in the
sense of not interested, but actually it's older in that sense. ...
   ``We can only report that people, grammarians or whatever, said
that a usage was wrong,'' Weiner said. ``But very often you will
find in the quotations that Shakespeare or Dryden or whoever
actually did use this supposedly wrong usage, and that rather
confounds the extreme prescriptivist point of view.''

<HEAD>U.S. Agencies Apparently In Conflict Over Rocket Fuel Bound For Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Customs officials are trying to block a
shipment of a rocket fuel component allegedly headed for Iran, but a
lack of cooperation between federal agencies could help free the
chemical soon, it was reported.
   A shipment large enough to fuel 300 military missiles was seized
in Europe in February 1988 when Customs Service agents said it was
being loaded onto an Iranian freighter, according to Sunday's Los
Angeles Times.
   But the State Department issued a special export license to the
chemical's owner, blocking Customs' court fight to forbid the
shipment, the newspaper said.
   A federal judge in Houston issued a temporary injunction
requiring the government to release the 1,144 drums of ammonium
perchlorate last week. Another hearing is scheduled for today.
   U.S. District Court Judge Sim Lake ruled the rocket fuel
ingredient was not among munitions restricted for shipment to Iran
by the State Department and that Customs failed to prove the
shipment was bound for Iran.
   The 286,000 pounds of the rocket fuel component shipped from
Houston in January 1988 by Grindius Corp. of Tampa, Fla., was seized
the following month as it was being loaded onto an Iranian freighter
in the Dutch port of Rotterdam.
   The shipment was being sent during the Iran-Iraq war, when those
countries were using surface-to-surface missiles.
   Grindius contends it never intended to sell the chemical to Iran.
The shipping bill of lading shows it was bound for a buyer in Basel,
Switzerland.
   Following the seizure, the State Department issued a special
export license covering the shipment.
   The Customs Service has urged the State Department to revoke the
license. The department has declined to do so and wouldn't comment
on the case pending its court outcome.
   Customs officials also said the Justice Department is not sure
whether it will pursue the agency's case because of Lake's initial
ruling.
   Lake blamed a lack of cooperation and communication between the
various governmental agencies for the apparent conflict.
   The United States exports between 1 million and 2 million pounds
of ammonium perchlorate every year, mostly to friendly nations.
   The compound has been in short supply since May when an explosion
in Henderson, Nev., destroyed a plant operated by Pacific
Engineering and Production Co., the primary manufacturer of ammonium
perchlorate.

<HEAD>Documentary Shows Troubles of Elderly Poor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   ``That's my problem, I'm a survivor,'' said the
old woman.
   As she said it, she raised her blue eyes so they made contact
with the social worker sitting across the table and, coincidentally,
with the camera.
   There was a smile on her face as she talked about how strong she
was, how strong she had been all her life, how she had always taken
care of herself _ and of her husband before he died.
   But now, she was alone and sick and poor and beyond finding much
to look forward to on Earth.
   The more she talked the sadder she became until she concluded
that ``68 is long enough to live.'' And then she wept.
   It is but one of several such scenes from a television
documentary _ ``On the Other Side of Easy Street'' _ airing this
week on Public Broadcasting System stations across the nation.
   Without exception, the old people put on faces of strength, even
humor for the camera. But they are not actors and, also without
exception, their eyes reflect despair and, in some cases, a
bewildered sense that they thought it wasn't supposed to turn out
this way.
   Indeed, that is the central point to the film: that despite the
Social Security program that has helped keep an increasing
proportion of elderly Americans from the poverty that afflicted
their own elders, those who remain poor _ well over 3 million _ do
so with little hope.
   ``The film shatters the stereotype that elderly persons are well
off and none are poor,'' said Horace Deets, executive director of
the American Association of Retired Persons. ``... So many people
struggle every day to retain some dignity in the face of extreme
poverty.''
   Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of the Villers Foundation,
which financed the film along with AARP, said after a preview
screening that the problems portrayed in the film ``are not
insoluble.''
   ``Frankly, it's a question of political will,'' said Pollack, who
made the point that _ unlike younger and healthier people _ the
elderly have little prospect of working their way out of poverty.
   While not a pleasant viewing experience, the film drives home the
point that even the best laid plans don't always turn out.
   And it shows that cutting through government red tape to get
available benefits is not the easiest thing to do, especially for a
new widow reeling from the death of her husband from a long illness
that wiped out what they thought would be a financial cushion.
   AARP issued a study in conjunction with release of the film that
showed fewer than half the elderly people eligible for the
Supplemental Security Income program, which is supposed to provide a
safety net for the poorest of the poor, actually get their benefits.
   The reasons vary widely from state to state and individual to
individual but, in most cases, result from failure of the
bureaucracy make the program easily available for those too
unsophisticated or too proud to seek it out.
   For those who do, the maximum benefit is $368 per month for an
individual and $553 per month for a couple.

   In the aftermath of the brutal Senate battle
over former Sen. John Tower's attempt to run the Pentagon, the tenor
of a confirmation hearing seems to be getting, as one senator says,
a little bizarre.
   As evidence, here are a few questions put by Sen. Gordon
Humphrey, R-N.H., to Lawrence Eagleburger during his confirmation
hearing last week to be deputy secretary of state:
   Humphrey: Well, let's get to the important questions, Mr.
Eagleburger. ... First of all, have you ever drunk anything stronger
than warm milk?
   Eagleburger: Yes, sir. (Laughter)
   Humphrey: Strike one. I notice you smoke, too. Strike two. ...
Have you ever in public or private pinched a woman's behind?
   Eagleburger: Can I divide that into two questions? (Laughter) ...
No, sir.
   The nominee, a man to whom laughter came as easily as diplomatic
analysis during the drawn-out hearings, apparently took no offense
at Humphrey's questions and went on to discuss with him the tragedy
of hunger that is gripping the African nation, Sudan.
   The 30-year veteran of government service, who'd accumulated a
massive store of goodwill among senators, was swiftly confirmed a
day later by the full Senate.
   But all kidding aside, Eagleburger's two days of confirmation
hearings served to point out that much confusion remains about what
is required of a nominee for high public office, whether in personal
standards of conduct, or in attempting to deal with questions of
real or apparent conflict of interest.
   It was clear that the shadow of Tower's ruined quest for
confirmation, which foundered on allegations of alcohol abuse,
``womanizing'' and the nominee's $1 million in fees as a consultant
for defense contractors, haunted Eagleburger's nomination, and may
well haunt others in the future.
   Some of the most tense questioning during the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee hearings came from Sen. Jesse Helms, R.-N.C.. He
prodded Eagleburger about the more than $900,000 in income, bonuses
and severance the nominee received during his last of four years
with the international consulting firm headed by former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger.
   ``You know the big deal that was made about John Tower,'' Helms
told Eagleburger. ``He was a piker compared to your income.''
   Helms, an arch-conservative who had been a vocal critic of
Kissinger's policy of pursuing detente, said he was worried about
possible influence by the firm's foreign clients.
   ``There are a lot of people who wonder whether the advice you
might give to the president or the secretary of state might be
colored by the ongoing interest of firms, foreign firms ... who have
been paying you substantial fees,'' Helms told Eagleburger.
   Eagleburger said he had provided analyses of political, economic
and societal developments for his clients, many of them
multinational corporations, but that he never lobbied the U.S.
government on their behalf or engaged in any political activity for
them.
   To return to government and avoid ``even the appearance of a
conflict of interest,'' Eagleburger said he cut all ties with
Kissinger Associates, sold all his investment stocks, and
volunteered to disqualify himself for a year from any dealings with
the 15 clients he'd worked for while at Kissinger's firm and been
paid more than $5,000.
   This, his attorney William Rogers argued, went ``far beyond''
what has customarily been required from government appointees, such
as cutting all ties with their former business associates and then
being recused on a case-by-case basis on the advice of government
ethics attorneys.
   But Eagleburger's actions did not satisfy Helms, who said he
wanted the names of all of the Kissinger clients made public,
whether Eagleburger had worked for them or not.
   Helms argued that since Eagleburger had been paid out of a
company pot of funds, and not just by the clients he served, it was
necessary for the Senate panel to have such information.
   Eagleburger said that was difficult for him, since the list was
considered confidential by the company.
   Helms' request proved too much for Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., who
argued that ``it's bizarre'' to require a nominee to disqualify
himself from all dealings with any client that paid part of his
income, even though he'd had no business dealings with them.
   He said such a requirement would have disqualified former
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, former deputy secretary of state
John Whitehead, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, OMB Director
Richard Darman, Secretary of State George Shultz and Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter, many of whom had extensive business
contacts with huge investment or law firms.
   ``I think we're getting a little daffy. ... We'll be assured that
the only person who'll we'll ever have as a secretary of state will
be someone who has a career that is distinguished by doing
nothing,'' Biden argued.
   Eagleburger sought to defuse the problem by offering to
disqualify himself from any possible future dealings with any client
of the Kissinger firm from the past two years, even those he didn't
work with.
   As well, an ``informal'' arrangement was worked out, Biden said,
that did not require the nominee to meet a higher standard than what
is required under the law.
   Eagleburger agreed to disclose the names of the clients to the
State Department legal adviser, who is obligated to keep them
private under an attorney-client relationship, and provide the list
to the committee chairman, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., and Helms,
who agreed to treat it as a classified document.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Film, Book Focus Attention on History of Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Congress goes into its third century, the
history of the first two is coming in for some increased attention.
   It has been a neglected subject, with much more scrutiny focused
on the White House at the other end of the central stretch of
Pennsylvania Avenue.
   Now, however, there is a 724-page book on the history of the
Senate, made up of speeches by former Majority Leader Robert C.
Byrd, D-W.Va.
   And tonight, most public television stations are carrying a
90-minute special called ``The Congress,'' using paintings,
photographs, newsreels, sound recordings and narration to depict the
200 years since the first Congress met in New York on March 4, 1789.
   Historian William E. Leuchtenburg of the University of North
Carolina, speaking at a recent gathering at the Capitol to launch
Byrd's book, lamented that members of his profession have paid
relatively scant attention to congressional history.
   Others whose business it is to get a balanced view of Washington
agree with him.
   ``Few good books have been written about Congress despite the
richness of the subject matter,'' Don Phillips, who covers the House
for The Washington Post, wrote recently.
   In tonight's television program, writer David McCullough, the
narrator and co-author, stands before a backdrop of the Capitol and
says, ``We are so accustomed to seeing our history measured by the
presidency that we forget the extent to which the real story of our
country takes place right there.''
   And it is in fact the building that is in many ways the star of
the film, whose producer, Ken Burns, won Academy Award nominations
and other honors with previous documentaries about the Brooklyn
Bridge and Statue of Liberty.
   Roaming around the Capitol, the camera fixes lovingly on the
glowing rotunda, presents speeded-up images of tourists passing the
building's monumental statues, focuses on the hands of Henry Clay in
a 19th-century portrait.
   It picks out the bust of Richard Nixon, tucked away in an alcove
off the Senate floor along with those of others who presided over
the Senate as vice president.
   There is also the voice of Douglas MacArthur, interrupted by
applause as he tells a joint session of Congress, ``Old soldiers
never die; they just fade away.''
   There is even a shot of Jimmy Stewart, awed by his first sight of
the Capitol dome as he arrives in Washington to take up his Senate
duties in the movie classic, ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.''
   The film deals with the silliness and the back-room deals on
Capitol Hill as well as such high drama as the civil rights debates
of the late 1950s and early 1960s. On the whole it is, as Burns told
a preview audience at the National Press Club, ``a very uncynical,
though not entirely uncritical, view of the Congress.''
   If all of this sounds to you like a Valentine to an institution
that is so often a whipping boy, surely we can count on the
Washington reporters, those hard-bitten men and women who cover the
Congress, to provide a more realistic and perhaps cynical view.
   Well, Burns and his colleagues interviewed some of them, so
listen:
   Charles McDowell, Richmond Times-Dispatch and Media General News
Service, speaking of the Capitol dome. ``It's a hat. It's a very
majestic nice hat, but a little bit ludicrous, on something that we
all care very much about. ... The people are being represented under
that thing; and I can live with that corny thought.''
   Cokie Roberts, National Public Radio and ABC News: ``It would be
a true disaster if the modern demands of security keep American
children from the ability to just sort of roam the Capitol
Building.''
   David Broder, the Washington Post: ``It's also a kind of a
wonderful place, if you just let yourself have the freedom to do it,
to stand still for a moment and look at the people who are coming
there to see their Congress at work. It's marvelous to see their
expressions as the dignity and the beauty of that building reach
them for the first time.''
   Ms. Roberts again, on how the lawmakers go about their work: ``I
think quite frankly, by the time the whole messy business is over
with, Congress after Congress, that they've done a pretty good job
of it.''
   So much for cynicism.
   The film was underwritten by the information industry giant
Ameritech and co-produced by WETA of Washington and Florentine Films.
   Byrd's book, ``The Senate, 1789-1989,'' is available from the
Government Printing Office in Washington and its depositories around
the country for $55.

<HEAD>EPA Can't Detect Superfund Conflicts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citing a report that found the Superfund
program ripe for a contracting scandal, a House panel chairman says
the Environmental Protection Agency must avoid the ``morass of
abuses'' that have plagued Pentagon purchasing.
   The General Accounting Office concluded in a new report that the
EPA is letting the growing number of contractors in the Superfund
program police themselves on potential conflicts of interest.
   Procedures are so lax that the agency might not discover a
company it hired to investigate a hazardous waste dump also was
working for the polluter of the site, the GAO said in a report
obtained over the weekend by The Associated Press.
   Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., who requested the study, wrote EPA
Administrator William K. Reilly on Friday, ``The Superfund contract
program must avoid at all costs the morass of abuses and conflict of
interest problems that plague the defense procurement system.
   ``While it is important ... for contractors to have effective
internal procedures in place, it is also important that EPA
personnel have the independent capability to police the Superfund
contract system.''
   Dingell is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee
and the panel's investigations subcommittee, which has been
investigating the Superfund program.
   The report concluded, ``This system is currently dependent on
contractors' identifying and informing appropriate EPA officials
about conflicts.''
   It warned that a company working for both sides could feed the
EPA biased data, thereby weakening legal efforts to recover cleanup
costs from a polluter.
   The report said the EPA ``relies heavily on contractors to avoid
conflicts, but does not review contractors' performance to ensure
compliance with EPA's conflict of interest requirements.''
   The investigators said few conflicts have been found so far, but
cautioned, ``This risk is a growing possibility in light of EPA's
continuing efforts to expand the number of contractors used to
perform remedial and technical enforcement activities.''
   In the 1988 fiscal year, more than $600 million in contracts were
approved by the agency for Superfund projects, compared to $97.3
million in fiscal 1982.
   Superfund, an $8.5 billion program to clean up hazardous waste
sites, relies increasingly on private companies for the preliminary
investigations of polluted sites, because the government has neither
the manpower nor the expertise to do the work.
   David O'Connor, director of EPA's procurement and contracts
management division, said, ``We're not in a position to police every
situation with every firm out there. The amount of effort required
to do that would just be overwhelming.''
   He said a company caught working for both the agency and
polluters at the same site could face a ban on EPA work or
termination of the contract.
   ``We could take the position of being purists,'' he said, by
prohibiting even ``the appearance'' of a conflict. But he asked,
``How strict can we get in appearance situations and still have
companies that will work for us? There is a limited industry. We
don't want to set up private sector contractors vs. public sector
contractors.''
   The GAO investigators looked at seven contracts valued at $745
million and involving work at sites all across the country.
   Five of the contracts were for studies that led to
recommendations on how to clean up the sites. Two contracts were for
investigating the parties responsible for pollution, so legal cases
could be developed for recovery of cleanup costs.

   Don Ameche, who is returning to Broadway this
week for the first time in 22 years, says he initially turned down
the lead role in ``Our Town,'' but changed his mind because ``it
would be fun to be back on stage.''
   The 80-year-old Academy Award-winning actor on Tuesday takes over
the role of Stage Manager in the play based on Thornton Wilder's
drama of a New England town.
   ``We don't have many American classics like this,'' Ameche told
The Associated Press.
   Ameche said he at first turned down the role but changed his mind.
   ``I thought it would be fun to be back on stage,'' said Ameche,
who is replacing Spalding Gray.
   Ameche said he doesn't expect to feel any jitters about returning
to Broadway, where he first appeared nearly 60 years ago in ``Jerry
for Short.''
   ``After more than two or three minutes, all that is gone,'' said
Ameche, whose recent films include ``Trading Places,'' and
``Cocoon,'' for which he received an Oscar.

   This week's broadcast of ``Peter Pan,'' which
hasn't been televised in more than 15 years, should bring back
painful memories to Mary Martin, who broke her elbow teaching
co-stars how to fly in the production.
   ``I started really fast and suddenly I'm out of sight, and I
don't feel anything pulling me back,'' Miss Martin, who portrayed
Peter in the 1960 movie, said in this week's People magazine. ``I'm
heading for the wall, and like a shot, I hit it.''
   Martin, now 75, broke her elbow in two places.
   She said the crewman who was supposed to pull her back was new
and ``so excited he forgot.''
   The story of the little boy who never wanted to grow up will be
broadcast on NBC-TV on Friday. It was last televised in 1973. After
that, the rights to the movie were held up for years by the 1979
Broadway revival with Sandy Duncan.

   You wouldn't know Donna Rice these days,
and that's exactly what she was hoping for when she bought the false
buck teeth and sunglasses she now wears in public.
   ``It's just been real hard,'' the model said Saturday in a speech
at the 15th annual Institute on the Ethics of Journalism at
Washington and Lee University. ``I do live in a state of having to
watch my every move. ... Imagine the kind of person you most dislike
and think of people thinking of you as that kind of person.''
   Ms. Rice's liaison with former Sen. Gary Hart destroyed the
Colordao Democrat's bid for the 1988 presidential nomination. Hart
withdrew from the race in May 1987.
   ``I basically lost everything I had worked for all of my life,''
she said _ her reputation and credibility as well as her livelihood.
   Ms. Rice said she frequently is recognized in public and has
tried to hide her appearance by pulling her hair back.
   In addition, she added. ``I have a disguise. I have buck teeth
that I put on. They cost me 80 bucks. You guys want to see?''
   When the audience said yes, Ms. Rice donned a pair of glasses,
bent over and inserted the false teeth. She stood upright, looking
like quite a different person.
   ``I hope,'' she said, ``time will eventually take care of all of
this.''

   First Dog Millie and her litter of six pups
were reported to be doing fine after a weekend delivery at the White
House, and the Bushes even got congratulated on the new arrivals at
a Palm Sunday church service.
   The First Family _ with the six new canine arrivals _ spent a
quiet Sunday close to home after the 2-year-old brown and white
English springer spaniel gave birth to one male and five female
puppies on Friday night and early Saturday.
   The Bushes have said they will give away the puppies, with some
of them to go to grandchildren. White House aide Bruce Zanca said
Sunday that the pups were expected to remain at the White House with
Millie for about six weeks.
   President and Mrs. Bush attended an early morning worship service
at St. John's Episcopal Church on Sunday, a block from the White
House, then spent the rest of the day at home.
   ``Congratulations on the puppies,'' the Rev. Mark K. J. Robinson,
a rector at the church, said as he greeted them.
   Millie lost neither her appetite nor her energy from the ordeal
and was eating ``several times as much as usual'' and bounding
around the White House grounds, according to Mrs. Bush.
   The president, who joined his wife to watch one of the six
puppies delivered, described the experience on Saturday as ``really
beautiful, it was unbelievable.''
   ``The president and I cried when we saw one of them being born.
... We had a tear. It was really sweet,'' Mrs. Bush said. ``It was
so beautiful to see her.''
   She added that the puppies are ``really cute.'' She said it had
been an easy delivery and that, while she played midwife, Millie
``did all the work.''
   ``Millie is apparently a very good mother,'' said Anna Perez,
Mrs. Bush's press secretary. ``The puppies started nursing
immediately. Mom and babies and midwife are doing fine.''

<HEAD>Minimum Wage Up For Floor Debate; GOP Reshuffles House Leadership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The action in Congress this week is in the
House, which has a minimum wage debate on its agenda as well as
items that could reshape the leadership of both parties in the
chamber.
   Little legislation has moved through the Congress so far this
year, with most of the time spent on the failed plan to raise
congressional pay and the Senate battle over the nomination of John
Tower for defense secretary.
   President Bush lost that one, but his nomination of Rep. Dick
Cheney to the Pentagon post sailed to confirmation last week before
the Senate shut down for a two-week recess.
   In the House, another fight between majority Democrats and the
White House looms.
   Bush has been adamant in saying he will agree to raise the
minimum wage to no more than $4.25 an hour by 1992 and only if an
accompanying ``training wage'' provision is approved allowing
employers to pay new workers $3.35 _ the present minimum _ for up to
six months.
   Democrats, mindful of former President Reagan's success in
blocking any increase, are moving toward accepting some form of
training wage but are refusing to scale back their bill, which would
boost the minimum to $4.65 in three years.
   Debate in the House is scheduled to begin Wednesday or Thursday,
when Republicans will try again to substitute Bush's proposal for
the Democrats' bill and Democrats tack on their own version of a
training wage, one unlikely to meet White House standards.
   ``I think they want to play hardball with this bill and test the
president's mettle,'' said Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, a member of the
House Education and Labor Committee.
   Jay Butler, an aide to Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., the
sponsor of the bill and chairman of the labor panel, said Hawkins
was reviewing a handful of Democratic proposals for a training wage
and, despite his longstanding opposition to such provisions, will
choose one to add to his bill. That is a tacit admission Democrats
do not believe they could override a threatened veto.
   The provision would require certification of training and have a
life span considerably shorter than the six months espoused by Bush,
Butler said. Bush's proposal requires no skills training;
Republicans argue that would discourage hiring in low-skills,
entry-level jobs.
   Democrats argue that those paid the minimum wage _ frozen at
$3.35 for eight years _ have seen their buying power erode by nearly
40 percent and that even an increase to $4.65 will lag behind
inflation.
   Republicans counter by saying that raising the minimum wage will
result in dramatic job losses, cost the federal government millions
if not billions and fail to help the working poor.
   Democrats have played down the employment implications of their
bill, which the Bush administration says would cost 650,000 jobs. A
Congressional Budget Office analysis released Friday put the number
at 125,000 to 250,000.
   Backers of Hawkins bill also have dismissed talk about the
potential budget cost, but Republicans last week asserted that
Hawkins' bill would result in the loss of more than 430,000 jobs in
four popular government programs alone unless another $570 million
is spent on them.
   The programs are College Work Study, Head Start, Community
Service Employers for Older Americans and the federal summer jobs
program for youths.
   ``The Democrats are trying to represent the minimum wage as
having no cost to the government,'' Armey said. ``My point is if you
believe in these programs, do you want to cut thousands of people
from them?''
   Armey failed in an attempt to amend the legislation to exempt
those programs from having to pay any increase in the minimum wage.
   Another bill due for floor debate this week would expand the
rights of federal employees who blow the whistle on fraud.
   The measure sailed through the Senate and Bush supports it.
Similar legislation was the subject of a controversial Reagan veto.
   The week also should bring changes to the House Republican
leadership and include debate that ultimately could reshape the
Democratic leadership as well.
   GOP lawmakers are expected to choose Wednesday between two
candidates vying to replace Cheney in the No. 2 leadership post,
pragmatist Edward Madigan of Illinois and flamboyant conservative
Newt Gingrich of Georgia.
   The balloting in that race will come as the chamber's ethics
committee deliberates whether Speaker Jim Wright violated House
rules through his financial dealings, which have been the subject of
a nine-month panel investigation.
   Budget negotiations also are expected to continue this week and
the House banking subcommittee will hold a final hearing on the
savings and loan crisis before writing a $100 billion bailout plan
likely to be drawn heavily from Bush's recent proposal.

   Now that NASA has completed its third
straight successful post-Challenger shuttle flight, Atlantis will be
rolled to the launch pad Wednesday for a mission that will include a
planetary probe.
   Packed in Atlantis' cargo bay for the scheduled April 28 liftoff
will be the Magellan Venus spacecraft, the first planetary probe to
be carried by a space shuttle and America's first planned planet
flight since 1978.
   Magellan is to be released from the cargo bay. After 466 days, it
is to orbit Venus and map its cloud-shrouded surface with high
resolution radar.
   Discovery's return to Earth on Saturday following a successful
five-day mission buoyed the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's ambitious plan to launch seven shuttles this year
as it continues its recovery from the 1986 Challenger explosion and
builds toward a launch rate of 12 a year by 1992.
   ``Our goal is to fly again and again,'' with safety always a
prime consideration, said Richard Truly, shuttle program director.
   He said Discovery returned in better condition than any other
shuttle and that bodes well for maintaining a vigorous launch
schedule.
   Truly said one stumbling block may be the extensive modifications
being made to Columbia, the oldest shuttle. That shuttle's July 1
target launch date with a classified military payload already has
slipped about two weeks.
   Any additional holdup could push back another military shuttle
flight planned in August, and that could begin affecting the high
priority October launch of Atlantis with the Galileo probe to
Jupiter.
   ``We want very much to launch Columbia in July,'' Truly said.
``If not, we'll delay it to meet the Galileo window.''
   ``This is the third successful flight of the space shuttle since
we have returned to flight,'' Truly said after Discovery landed
Saturday. ``It shows again what a marvelous and capable vehicle this
is.''
   It also demonstrates, he said, that NASA has the capability of
flying a busy and safe launch rate.
   Magellan and Galileo are high-priority missions because there is
only a month or so every two years when their planetary targets are
in the proper alignment for a launch.
   Here's the launch schedule for the remainder of the year:
   April 28 _ Atlantis, with the Magellan-Venus spacecraft.
   Mid-July _ Columbia, with a Defense Department payload.
   Mid-August _ Discovery with a Defense Department payload.
   Oct. 12 _ Atlantis, with the Galileo-Jupiter spacecraft.
   Nov. 13 _ Columbia, whose crew is to deploy a communications
satellite and retrieve for return to Earth a scientific satellite
orbiting since 1984.
   Dec. 11 _ Discovery, with the Hubble Space Telescope.
   Ten flights are scheduled in 1990.

   Don't look for the super-heated exports of the
1970s to return soon, but an Agriculture Department economist says
rising global demand for U.S. agricultural products could bring at
least a miniboom in the 1990s.
   Ron Trostle of the department's Economic Research Service says
the growing demand isn't expected to match the fast pace of the
1970s when the volume of farm exports rose an average of 9 percent a
year. The world's economic growth rate in the 1990s simply is not
expected to support that kind of growth.
   But incomes in other countries are likely to rise faster in the
next decade than they have in the 1980s, Trostle said. And higher
incomes should translate into greater demand for agricultural
products.
   ``The best markets for the United States will be the developing
countries,'' Trostle said in an article prepared for the April issue
of Farmline magazine.
   ``More of the world's population will seek higher quality
diets,'' he said. ``We will see a continuing gradual change toward
higher valued and processed products, such as meats, fruits and
vegetables, and dairy products.''
   People with rising incomes will want more protein, and that will
generate a growing demand for livestock feed, such as U.S. corn, so
the countries can produce more meat, Trostle said. Foreign use of
feed grains is expected to climb faster than food grains, which
include wheat and rice.
   Trostle and his agency colleagues say they can't make a flat
prediction about the '90s being the start of a golden era because
``the future demand for American farm products could be either
stifled or stimulated'' by any number of factors:
   _Last year's crop-depleting drought in the United States could
trigger larger production by some export competitors wanting to cash
in on the higher commodity prices.
   _Developing countries could let domestic food prices rise, thus
encouraging farmers to produce more food for their own people. In
general, that would tend to boost import demand by raising incomes _
and when incomes rise, demand usually outruns a country's ability to
produce.
   _The Soviet Union's import needs, particularly for soybean meal
and other high-protein feeds, are unknown at this time.
   _The outcome of current negotiations under GATT, the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and the future of trade barriers and
export subsidies.
   Trostle said the years 1981-88, when U.S. shipments abroad
tumbled, showed that exports are critical to American agriculture,
and when they suffer, so do farmers.
   ``The production from about one of every three acres harvested in
the United States is marketed to consumers in other countries,''
Trostle said. ``In recent years, the value of total U.S.
agricultural exports averaged more than $16,000 a farm.''
   Trostle said foreign demand for agricultural products will
probably grow more slowly in the 1990s than it did in the 1970s _
but faster than it did in the first half of the 1980s. He cited
several forces that help shape this outlook:
   _World population growth has slowed from a peak of 2 percent
annually in the 1960s to about 1.7 percent now, and the trend is
expected to continue. Even so, the slower growth will add about 80
million more mouths to feed each year.
   _Many countries will have slower income growth than in the 1970s,
but the increases in the '80s are projected to be faster than in the
early 1980s, particularly in the developing countries.
   _Surpluses will continue to be more common than shortages in
world markets, so most commodities will be priced competitively,
often with favorable credit terms.
   _Debt problems will continue to hold back both income and import
demand in debtor countries, but to a lesser degree over time as debt
is gradually retired, restructured, forgiven or otherwise resolved.

   Congress is trying to move the issues of
affordable housing and homelessness to the forefront of the national
agenda, after eight years of cutbacks under the Reagan
administration.
   More than a quarter of the Senate last week co-sponsored a bill
that seeks to address the housing concerns of everyone from
first-time home buyers to the homeless.
   The bill, called the National Affordable Housing Act, seeks ``to
set the framework for a new national housing strategy'' said Sen.
Alan Cranston, D-Calif., chairman of the Banking, Housing and Urban
Affairs subcommittee on housing.
   ``It is imperative that we reverse a decade of neglect in
housing. ... I sense a growing impatience to raise housing back to
the place it deserves in the nation's priorities,'' said Cranston,
the bill's primary sponsor.
   The act would require states and local governments to submit
five-year housing plans to the Department of Housing and Urban
Development and update the plans annually. It also would create a
single institution within HUD with the authority to provide direct
assistance to government agencies.
   It would establish an assistant housing secretary post to
administer programs for the elderly, handicapped and homeless.
   For individuals the bill would seek to reduce the size of down
payments and allow first-time home buyers to use funds from
individual retirement accounts or 401K retirement plans for the
investment, reduce FHA mortgage rates while increasing the ceiling
of loan amounts in many cases and set limits on the percentage of
income paid by tenants receiving rental assistance.
   Low-income tax credits for developers set to expire next year
would be made permanent through provisions set forth in an earlier
bill co-sponsored by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine
and Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.
   There have been ``no specific commitments'' from the Bush
administration but housing secretary Jack Kemp likes many of the
bill's elements is ``very interested in the measure,'' according to
Cranston, who has met with Kemp several times.
   ``We're going to enact housing legislation this session,''
declared Mitchell.
   The subcommittee will begin hearings on the proposal next month.
   As the Cranston bill came out of the Senate, Rep. Henry Gonzalez,
D-Texas, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Housing and Community
Development, held the second in a series of all-day hearings on the
need for permanent housing for the homeless.
   Earlier in the month, Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., challenged Bush ``to
show the leadership this issue demands'' and called for a White
House conference on homelessness.
   In addition, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., is set to challenge
the Bush administration if it intends to replace rental assistance
certificates with vouchers as proposed in former President Reagan's
budget.
   Mikulski has released a study by the General Accounting Office,
the research arm of Congress, which ``presents compelling evidence
that the administration's housing voucher program will cost as much
as $9.6 billion more over the next 12 years than the rental
assistance certificate program it was designed to replace.''
   And Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said Kemp has agreed to appear
before the Government Operations subcommittee on employment and
housing which Lantos chairs. Kemp's appearance would follow his
expected selection as chairman of the Interagency Council for the
Homeless.
   The council, the government's chief coordinating agency for
homelessness programs, was roundly criticized by lawmakers last week
as a do-nothing panel under Reagan.

<HEAD>Baker Nearing Decision on Envoy to Afghan Rebels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III appears
close to making a decision on sending a special ambassador to the
U.S.-backed rebels fighting the Soviet-supported regime in
Afghanistan, administration officials say.
   The move is aimed at broadening U.S. influence among the
long-feuding Moslem rebel factions, the officials said over the
weekend.
   A White House official said the envoy's role could be seen as
attempting to limit Pakistan's influence among the Afghan
guerrillas, in particular its backing of radical Moslem
fundamentalist rebels over more moderate factions.
   He said Baker has the matter ``under consideration'' and that he
``may be close to a decision point.''
   The official, who spoke on condition his name not be used, said
the proposal ``is still on Baker's desk'' and has not yet reached
President Bush.
   A State Department official, who also spoke privately, said the
proposal has been ``under consideration for a long time,'' but said
he was uncertain of the timing of the decision or its possible
announcement.
   The first official emphasized that the move would not imply U.S.
recognition of any interim government established by the rebels,
also known as mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors.
   Civil war has ravaged Afghanistan for more than 11 years and
divisions among the rebel units could prolong the fighting. The
seven main guerrilla groups are members of an alliance based in
Pakistan, but have been deeply divided as their leaders struggle for
power and attempt to form a transitional regime leading to a postwar
Islamic republic of Afghanistan.
   Throughout the war, the United States has funneled aid to the
rebels through Pakistan. That nation has directed the lion's share
of support to one of the most successful rebel groups, the radical
fundamentalist unit headed by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.
   He not only has sought domination over the other groups, but also
advocates restructuring Afghan society along strict fundamentalist
Islamic lines.
   The Soviets, who entered Afghanistan in 1979, withdrew in
February under an agreement mediated by the United Nations.
   Last week the Soviets renewed arms shipments to the communist
regime in Kabul, saying they will continue to supply equipment to
President Najib's troops as long as Pakistan and the United States
supply the guerrillas.
   Last year, Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., pushed a law through
Congress that required the appointment of a special ambassador.
   On Friday, senators renewed the call for the appointment in a
resolution.
   The resolution, which was referred to the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, also said the United States should not cut the
amount of military equipment it gives the Afghan guerrillas until it
is ``absolutely clear'' that the Soviet Union has ended assistance
to its proxies.
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., authored the resolution, which was
signed by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., among others.

   The right-wing Republican
Nationalist Alliance claimed victory in the presidential vote
Sunday, a day of fierce clashes between leftist rebels and troops
that left at least 29 people dead.
   Three journalists were among those killed.
   The alliance, known as Arena, said its candidate gained more than
50 percent of the vote _ enough to avoid a runoff election next
month against the incumbent Christian Democrats.
   ``We are sure and we proclaim ourselves the victors,'' Roberto
D'Aubuisson, founder of Arena, told a news conference.
   Arena presidential candidate Alfredo Cristiani said the party had
results from 75 percent of the polling places and he was assured of
victory.
   The U.S. Embassy, which surveyed 21 polling places in San
Salvador that it considered would predict results for the entire
city, found Arena getting 60.5 percent, the Christian Democrats 31.7
percent, and the leftist Democratic Convergence 5.7 percent.
   ``Is it now quite possible that Arena is headed for a first-round
victory,'' the embassy said in a cable addressed to Secretary of
State James A. Baker III that was obtained by The Associated Press.
The document, which cited no raw vote figures, predicted turnout
would be 58 percent.
   Election authorities said preliminary official results were
expected Monday.
   A rebel boycott and scattered firefights between guerrillas and
troops trimmed the voter turnout.
   Six soldiers and 23 guerrillas were killed in battles as the
rebels tried to disrupt the voting, according to Col. Emilio Ponce,
chief of the joint chiefs of staff.
   Two Salvadoran journalists and a Dutch television cameraman also
were killed _ one during clash at a rebel-held town and the others
at military checkpoints.
   Christian Democratic candidate Fidel Chavez Mena had said he
expected to do better in the countryside than in the capital, but
his party's headquarters was virtually deserted Sunday night and the
party provided no results.
   ``We have the 50 percent that is needed to win and I can assure
you there will be no second round,'' said D'Aubuisson. ``I am proud
to have been able to carry such a good and capable man as Freddy
Cristiani to the presidency.''
   Critics claim Arena is still controlled by D'Aubuisson, a former
army major who has been accused of having links with rightist death
squads. D'Aubuisson has repeatedly denied the allegations.
   There was no official word on turnout, but a spot check of
several polling places in San Salvador showed about 60 percent of
registered voters cast ballots.
   Ana Guadalupe Martinez, a rebel spokeswoman in Mexico City, said
enough people had stayed away from the polls to prove that no
election could be held without participation by the rebel Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front.
   She said no polling places or voters had been attacked, as the
guerrillas had pledged, but rebel assaults on government
installations prevented the army from taking voters to the polls.
   The guerrillas had imposed a transport ban and sabotaged
telephone lines and electricity, which cut or restricted power to 80
percent of the country.
   Roman Catholic churches were crowded with Palm Sunday worshipers
and by midday there were long lines of voters at polling stations in
San Salvador. Turnout was light in many smaller towns.
   ``With these problems it's better to stay home,'' said Jose
Carlos Ortiz, 23. He spoke in front of his home in the capital as
guerrillas retreated from an assault on a military post three blocks
away.
   Sporadic rifle fire echoed from the slope of the Guazapa volcano,
a guerrilla stronghold north of San Salvador, as troops fought
insurgents in the 9-year-old war that has claimed an estimated
70,000 lives.
   There were seven presidential candidates and the three major ones
were Cristiani, Chavez Mena and Guillermo Ungo of the Democratic
Convergence.
   Christian Democrat President Jose Napoleon Duarte's five-year
term ends June 1. Duarte, barred by law from running for
re-election, is dying of liver cancer.
   Cristiani has vowed to follow free-market policies and reduce
state intervention in the economy. His party promised to step up the
war if the guerrillas do not agree to lay down their arms.
   Chavez Mena, a lawyer, heads the Christian Democrats'
conservative wing. He struggled against opposition charges of
corruption in the U.S.-backed government and inability of his party
to deal with the economy and the civil war.
   Leaders of the Democratic Convergence maintain formal links with
the guerrillas. This is the first election since 1977 in which
socialist candidates have competed.
   About 1.83 million people out of a population of 5 million were
eligible to vote and polls were open in 243 of the country's 262
municipalities. Nineteen towns in the north did not set up voting
stations because election officials deemed those rebel-held zones
too dangerous.
   In San Sebastian, 30 miles east of the capital, turnout was light.
   ``The people are frightened,'' said William Doherty of the
American AFL-CIO. ``There is no question that the intimidation by
the (guerrillas) is working.''
   Doherty is one of 21 congressmen, state politicians and private
citizens named by the White House to be official election observers.
He said turnout was ``far less'' than during three previous
elections he attended this decade.
   Cornel Lagrouw, a cameraman for Dutch national television, was
killed as army troops moved to oust guerrillas occupying the eastern
town of San Francisco Javier, said Bill Gentile, a U.S. photographer
for Newsweek.
   Lagrouw was part of a group of six journalists and two drivers
who were in the town. The others dragged him away and fled in two
cars, but they came under repeated helicopter fire despite press
markings and white flags on the vehicles, Gentile said.
   Two Salvadoran journalists were killed and another seriously
wounded when security forces fired on their vehicles. The armed
forces said the vehicles failed to heed orders to stop at roadblocks.
   In the March 1988 elections for the National Assembly, Arena won
32 seats, the Christian Democrats 23 and the National Conciliation
Party six. But a group called the Authentic Christian Movement split
from the Christian Democrats, taking 16 seats from Duarte's faction.
The next legislative elections are set for March 1991.

   They're at it again _ those bickering states who
share the Hudson River and a hearty animosity. They've battled over
Westway, the Statue of Liberty and the New York Giants.
   The latest provocation in the New York-New Jersey border war: a
New York tax law, passed in 1987 and discovered just recently, which
will tax Jerseyans' New York income at a rate based on their total
income.
   Translation: If you make $25,000 a year in New York, and your
spouse makes $75,000 annually west of the Hudson, you're taxed on
the $25,000 as if you're in the $100,000 bracket.
   Adding insult to usury (or so say the Jerseyans), New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo invited irate New Jerseyans to sue and suggested any
commuter who didn't like the law could quit ``and leave those jobs
for New Yorkers.''
   After pulling his foot from his mouth, Cuomo called New Jersey
Gov. Thomas Kean and apologized. But it was too late to stop angry
residents of the Garden State from some nasty Cuomo-bashing.
   ``His arrogance has infuriated New Jerseyans,'' said New Jersey
Republican Assemblyman Charles Hardwick, who has filed suit on
behalf of his state. ``He's supposed to be the compassionate
governor? He's made it clear his compassion ends at the Hudson
River.''
   Agreed Carl Golden, Kean's press secretary: ``To people on this
side o the Hudson _ commuters, legislators, whoever _ this is seen
as another attempt to step on the people of New Jersey.''
   The level of bile gets even higher among those who will be
actually hit by the tax.
   ``Can you believe this guy? We don't get education, don't get
welfare. What do we get for our tax dollars?'' asked commuter Thomas
Stokes of Middletown, N.J. ``We get sewer service _ and that winds
up on the Jersey shore anyway!''
   Stokes heads up the Taxpayers' Revolt, an ad hoc committee that
has encouraged New Jersey commuters to stop spending money in New
York until the law is rescinded.
   ``They did a real Pearl Harbor job on us. They passed this in '87
to take effect in '88 and told us about it in '89,'' said Stokes.
   But this dispute is just the latest round in a seemingly endless
struggle between the two neighbors. Connecticut commuters affected
by the tax aren't screaming for Cuomo's head _ but then, they've
been able to stand by and enjoy these NY-NJ spats:
   _New Jersey's courting of New York businesses and the city's
subsequent battle to keep the companies home. A highlight of this
continuing competition: a newspaper ad depicting Mayor Edward Koch,
hammer in hand, boarding up the Holland Tunnel to prevent defections.
   _The moves to the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, N.J., by the
New York Giants (from Yankee Stadium) and the New York Jets (from
Shea Stadium). A split decision in this fight: New Jersey got the
teams, but both still use New York in their names.
   _Both sides claimed the Statue of Liberty, which stands in New
York Harbor between the states. The courts finally ruled in New
York's favor. Another slap at the Garden State: the statue stands
with its back to Jersey City.
   _New York complains New Jersey factories are poisoning its air;
New Jersey claims New York's Staten Island landfill _ known as
``Mount Koch'' in the Garden State _ is polluting waterways.
   _A delegation of Jersey congressmen helped sink Westway, the $2
billion highway development planned for Manhattan's West Side. One
of the controversial project's biggest boosters: Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   After that defeat, the governor pointed directly at New Jersey
and affixed the blame: ``The people from Jersey did it in response
to a war with New York City.'' Obviously, that war continues.
   But Cuomo doesn't have only bad things to say about New Jersey;
just last month, he told an interviewer, ``I love New Jersey. My
father's first job was as a ditch digger in New Jersey.''
   Which, of course, would have made the elder Cuomo eligible to
join Stokes in the Taxpayers' Revolt.

   Fires and explosions hit two off-shore
oil-producing platforms Sunday night, injuring at least 13 workers
and forcing the evacuations of 25 to 30, the Coast Guard said.
   There were no immediate reports of fatalities, said Lt. Bob
Carson, a Coast Guard spokesman at New Orleans.
   At least 13 crewmembers from one of the two rigs were injured,
said Coast Guard Cmdr. Gerry Donohoe, pilot of one of the
helicopters that evacuated some of the injured to a New Orleans area
hospital. The injuries included second- or third-degree burns, he
said.
   Coast Guard and civilian helicopters joined in evacuating the
crewmen, Carson said.
   Firefighters extinguished the blaze on one rig late Sunday but
were still battling the fire on the second platform, authorities
said. The two rigs are connected by a catwalk.
   Both rigs are operated by Atlantic Richfield Co. in the Gulf of
Mexico four miles south of the mouth of the Mississippi River, or
about 100 miles southeast of New Orleans.

<HEAD>Thousands Rally To Support Maverick Reformer's Election Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of people rallied in Moscow to vent anger
at the Communist Party elite's alleged campaign to discredit ousted
city party boss Boris N. Yeltsin, a maverick reformer who is running
for national office.
   In a rare display of political passion, about 3,000 people
marched on city hall Sunday to drum up support for the popular
candidate. Police made no move to break up the unauthorized
gathering.
   Yeltsin is seeking a seat in the new national parliament, the
Congress of People's Deputies, in elections next Sunday that will
represent the country's first experiment with contested elections.
   ``He's against the party mafia, and that's why the party mafia is
against him,'' declared marcher Taras Osipov, a 65-year-old retired
engineer. ``Yeltsin is with the people, and for the people.''
   Yeltsin, 58, is running to represent the Soviet capital, where he
headed the local party apparatus for almost two years before
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev fired him for criticizing the slow
pace of reform.
   Yeltsin has charged that the party machine is conspiring to
derail his candidacy and restricting voters' access to his campaign.
Yeltsin's opponent in the election is Yevgeny Brakov, director of
the Zil automobile factory.
   As the Soviet Union lurches toward Sunday's vote, it is clear
that Gorbachev's reforms have brought amazing latitude in public
debate to a country that only recently punished unorthodox ideas
with harsh prison terms.
   Pravda reported on Sunday that even Gorbachev and other members
of the party's ruling Politburo failed to win unanimous support in
their bids for seats on the new legislature.
   Providing unusual insight into divisions in the policy-making
Central Committee, the Communist Party newspaper said that of 641
Central Committee members and alternates who voted Thursday, 12
opposed Gorbachev's candidacy.
   Yegor K. Ligachev, reputedly a conservative force on the
Politburo, recieved the most ``no'' votes of any Politburo member _
78, Pravda said.
   The Communist Party and some other organizations are entitled to
directly choose 750 of the 2,250 members of the legislature. The
other 1,500 will be chosen March 26 in nationwide elections.
   Although party members proposed 31,000 candidates for its 100
seats in the legislature, the Central Committee chose to nominate
all 100 people suggested by the Politburo, then elected all their
nominees.
   The Central Committee vote showed there is considerable
opposition not only to Ligachev, but also to Politburo members
closely linked to Gorbachev. Prior to Gorbachev, such votes were
customarily unanimous.
   Thousands of Yeltsin supporters had planned to rally Sunday at
Moscow's Gorky Park. When they were told permission for the meeting
had been refused, they set off for the city center.
   Their anger was kindled by a Central Committee decision last week
to form a special commission to investigate charges that Yeltsin,
who is still a Central Committee member, opposes some party policies.
   Yeltsin won support from many Muscovites with a campaign against
corruption and spirited attacks on the privileges available to the
government and party elite.
   At one point during the march, scores of police officers barred
the crowd from getting near the Kremlin, the seat of Soviet power.
   Police and KGB agents along the route directed the marchers but
made no attempt to halt them, even though their protest violated
city regulations that require seven days' notice of any
demonstration.
   The street resounded with the chant of ``Hands off Yeltsin!'' as
the marchers approached city hall. There, a cordon of police barred
their way.
   In unison, the protesters shook their fists and chanted their
demand to meet with Lev N. Zaikov, a Politburo member and the
current Moscow party boss.
   Zaikov leads the party machine Yeltsin claims is working for his
defeat.
   One pro-Yeltsin speaker near the building's doorway shouted,
``Shame on our Soviet democracy. Shame on our leaders.''
   When the elderly man called for a one-day strike across Moscow if
Yeltsin is defeated, the crowd roared and raised its hands in
approval.
   Yeltsin told the Central Committee on Oct. 21, 1987, that faith
in Gorbachev's reforms was waning and Gorbachev was becoming the
subject of ``intolerable'' glorification.
   Yeltsin, who had been named Moscow party boss in December 1985
and a non-voting member of the Politburo two months later, lost both
posts as a result of his remarks.
   He was later named to a ministerial-rank job in the State
Construction Committee.

   Americans widely expect the federal government to
fail in its search for a lasting solution to the savings and loan
crisis, a national survey by Media General and The Associated Press
has found.
   The poll of 1,108 adults also revealed a considerable lack of
confidence in the beleaguered S&amp;L industry: Only half the
respondents called thrifts safe and a third of those with S&amp;L
deposits feared losing their money.
   Half those surveyed favored greater government regulation of the
industry, and a majority preferred bailing out failing thrifts to
closing them. But most opposed having the public bear the brunt of
the costs.
   Federal insurance is insufficient to cover accounts at the
estimated 350 savings and loans that are failing, and the government
so far has taken over 166 of them while Congress and the White House
devise a rescue plan. The nation has 2,955 savings and loan
associations in all.
   President Bush has proposed using $50 billion in
government-backed bonds to help cover the accounts, in addition to
$40 billion pledged last year to sell or prop up failed thrifts. But
in the poll just 27 percent said the government should pay most of
the costs of salvaging the industry.
   Instead, a 42 percent plurality said the S&amp;L industry should bear
most of the costs by paying higher insurance premiums on its
accounts, a lesser feature of Bush's plan. Just 14 percent supported
a fee on S&amp;L depositors, an idea the administration considered and
dropped.
   Whatever the eventual plan, only 31 percent believed the
government will find a long-term solution to the crisis. Thirty-nine
percent expected ``only a temporary solution'' and 19 percent
predicted no solution. The rest expressed no opinion.
   The survey did find support for the government program of giving
S&amp;Ls financial assistance to attract buyers. Of those who had an
opinion, 51 percent favored such bailouts while 29 percent preferred
closing down failing thrifts and paying off their depositors.
   Of the 35 percent of respondents who had S&amp;L accounts, only 9
percent said they were withdrawing money because of the industry's
problems. But a fifth said they were considering that step and as
many said they were holding off on new deposits.
   S&amp;Ls have sustained record withdrawals lately, but federal
analysts have chiefly blamed the higher interest rates that are
available elsewhere rather than concern about the industry's
financial problems.
   But while the poll found that the S&amp;L crisis had not yet prompted
many depositors to reduce their accounts, others said they were
staying away. Of those who have not had money in S&amp;Ls during the
past year, 18 percent said they were keeping their money out because
of the thrifts' woes.
   The industry problems were widely recognized: Only 53 percent
overall regarded S&amp;Ls as a safe place to keep their money, compared
with 93 percent who saw banks as safe. Thirty-six percent called
S&amp;Ls unsafe and 11 percent weren't sure.
   A 48 percent plurality blamed the S&amp;L crisis on bad management by
the thrifts; among other respondents with an opinion, 21 percent
blamed general economic problems and 11 percent blamed fraud by S&amp;L
managers.
   Only 10 percent blamed a lack of government regulation. But 53
percent nonetheless favored bolstering goverment regulation, twice
the number who said current regulation was ``about right.''
   The survey, conducted March 6-15, found relatively little
variation in opinion across the demographic spectrum. In the South,
where thrifts have fared worst, 49 percent rated them safe; in the
Northeast, 56 percent called them safe. That gap slightly exceeded
the margin of error plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   The poll was conducted by the AP and Media General Inc., a
communications company based in Richmond, Va., that publishes the
Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the Tampa (Fla.)
Tribune and the Winston-Salem (N.C.) Journal, and operates TV
stations WXFL in Tampa, WCBD in Charleston, S.C., and WJKS in
Jacksonville, Fla.

   Comic Relief III, which featured the talents
of Billy Crystal, Whoppi Goldberg, Robin Williams and other
comedians, collected $3.6 million in pledges of money to help the
homeless.
   The amount was nearly $1 million more than last year's donations,
said Comic Relief vice president Dennis Albaugh.
   The four-hour telethon was televised Saturday night on the HBO
cable network with Joe Piscopo, Garry Shandling, Shelley Long,
Bobcat Goldthwait and John Larroquette joining hosts Crystal,
Goldberg and Williams.
   The two previous Comic Relief shows amassed more than $5 million
to fund homeless relief efforts in nearly two dozen U.S. cities,
officials said.
   Entertainers donated their time and HBO assumed all production
costs, allowing all viewer donations to go directly to the
non-profit Comic Relief organization.
   More than 150,000 homeless people receive aid from programs the
donations, said Bob Zmuda, president of Comic Relief.
   The money has paid for a dental clinic in Albuquerque, N.M., a
mental-health care center in Nashville, Tenn., a mobile medical
clinic in Kansas City and intensive outreach programs in New York,
San Diego and Milwaukee, he said.

   Discovery's astronauts, fresh after
a day of ``R&amp;R,'' today were briefing NASA on their mission, which
the shuttle apparently weathered better than its predecessors.
   Discovery remained at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., where high
winds hampered crews working Sunday to get the craft ready for its
ride atop a jumbo jet to Florida. Officials, however, expected it to
leave on time Friday.
   After their desert landing at Edwards early Saturday, the five
astronauts spent the rest of the weekend with their families.
   They were going back to work today, briefing the space agency on
the shuttle's performance and the experiments conducted during the
nearly flawless five-day mission, said Steve Nesbitt, a Johnson
Space Center spokesman.
   A preliminary examination indicated only 10 thermal protection
tiles will need to be replaced, in contrast to the last shuttle
flight, in December, when nearly 200 tiles were severely damaged.
   ``This is one of the best yet,'' said Cindy Lodge, who works on
the shuttle's tile system. ``We've had no major damages, there's a
few dings ... around the nose cap, nothing severe at all.''
   The tiles shield orbiters during the fiery re-entry into Earth's
atmosphere.
   Five tiles were damaged when wires connected to a tire pressure
monitor snapped as the right main landing gear dropped, Ms. Lodge
said. Only one of those five tiles will need to be replaced, she
said.
   The brakes, which have caused problems during previous shuttle
landings, also performed well, engineers said.
   ``The brakes looked the best ever. No signs of any heat; there
was no damage whatsoever,'' said NASA's Tip Talone, who coordinates
processing of the orbiter for each flight.
   The mission ended with a picture-perfect landing that was watched
by a near-record crowd of 460,000.
   Five hundred people cheered the astronauts' return to Houston
later in the afternoon.
   ``We've had one fun time and we really enjoyed this flight,''
said mission specialist James F. Buchli, who had been on two
previous Discovery missions.
   The flight was commanded by Michael L. Coats, who had flown one
previous shuttle mission. The other crew members _ pilot John E.
Blaha and mission specialists Robert C. Springer and James P. Bagian
_ made their first voyages.
   Discovery's flight, the 28th shuttle mission, was the third since
Challenger exploded shortly after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986. Seven
astronauts died in the explosion, which brought shuttle flights to a
halt for nearly three years.
   Discovery blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., a week ago
today. Six hours into the mission, the crew accomplished its primary
mission _ the deployment of a $100 million communications satellite.
   The satellite completes a network that will enable the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration to have nearly constant contact
with space shuttles and other satellites.
   The astronauts also photographed the Earth. Their film will be
edited into a movie that will document environmental damage by man
and nature.
   Four rats that were aboard as one of the experiments, were killed
shortly after touchdown so researchers can study how their
intentionally cut legs healed in microgravity. Many of the 32
fertilized chicken eggs that were aboard will be allowed to hatch to
see how space affected embryo development.
   Other experiments included growing protein crystals as part of a
project to develop new drugs and seeing how plants grow in
microgravity. The results will be studied by the researchers who
designed the experiments.
   The only problem during the flight concerned an erratic pressure
reading from a hydrogen tank that helps supply electricity to the
orbiter. The astronauts conserved electricity for a day until ground
controllers corrected the difficulty.
   The next shuttle to fly _ Atlantis _ is expected to be rolled out
to a Cape Canaveral launch pad Wednesday for its scheduled April 28
liftoff. The Atlantis astronauts will deploy a probe that will map
the surface of Venus.

<HEAD>AP Photographer Pyle Dies of Heart Ailment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Steven J. Pyle, an Associated Press photographer
whose assignments took him from papal travels in Latin America to
Super Bowls and Olympic Games, has died. He was 45.
   Pyle, Wisconsin photo editor, died Saturday after surviving more
than a month on an artificial heart-assist device. He suffered a
heart attack Feb. 12 and underwent multiple bypass surgery.
   Doctors determined Pyle's heart still was too damaged to resume
normal pumping and he was connected to devices that helped his heart
pump blood.
   Doctors had hoped Pyle would become a candidate for a heart
transplant.
   Pyle, a 16-year AP veteran, headed Wisconsin photo operations for
the news cooperative the past 13 years and frequently handled
out-of-state assignments.
   He covered five trips by popes; the U.S.-Soviet summit in
Iceland; political conventions; and the shuttle Challenger disaster.
His sports assignments included Super Bowls, World Series, the
Kentucky Derby and Olympics at Calgary and Los Angeles.
   ``Steve was one of the very good people who possessed the rare
talent to operate as effectively with newspaper publishers and
general managers as with fellow photographers, covering everything
from street violence to major international events,'' said Harold G.
Buell, the AP's assistant general manager for news photos.
   ``He was one of the early enthusiasts who helped lead the AP into
its present all-color photography. He was widely sought as a
lecturer and seminar leader at the university and professional
levels.''
   His 1973 shot of a returning prisoner-of-war being reunited with
his family won Headliner and Associated Press Managing Editors
citations.
   Pyle, a Cincinnati native, graduated from Ohio University and
worked at WCPO-TV and WKRC-TV in Cincinnati before moving to The
Advocate newspaper in Newark, Ohio, in 1967.
   He joined the AP at Columbus, Ohio, in 1972 and served as the
news cooperative's Los Angeles photo editor before taking over AP
Wisconsin photo operations in 1976.
   Pyle is survived by his wife, Sharon, and sons, David and Ted.
   Funeral services were scheduled Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   The devastating drought of 1988 is still
fresh on farmers' minds, and insurers say they're getting a bumper
crop of business this year _ a lot earlier than usual.
   More than 100 million acres of farm land are expected to be
insured this year, compared with about 75 million acres in 1988,
says Gene Gantz, executive director of the American Association of
Crop Insurers.
   ``It is a gigantic record,'' he said, adding that up to 150
million acres could be covered if conditions remain dry through the
April 15 deadline for signing up for federally subsidized
multi-peril crop insurance.
   Rainfall has been in short supply so far this year, scaring many
farmers who watched their fields and pocketbooks shrivel during last
year's long, hot and dry summer across the Farm Belt.
   The drought resulted in a $3.9 billion federal bailout.
   ``When the house burns down down the street, most people get out
their homeowners policy to check and see if they're covered,'' Gantz
said in a telephone interview from the Washington, D.C., office of
the trade group. ``And if you don't have a policy, you get one.''
   Gantz said some insurers already are reporting two to three times
their normal farm business.
   Joy Tegels, general manager of Agri-Business Insurance
Consultants Ltd. in the central Iowa community of Nevada, said crop
insurance business already is up 25 percent.
   She said that in Iowa, where 44 percent of the crop land was
covered by federal crop insurance last year, an estimated 60 percent
of crops would be covered this year if there's no substantial
rainfall soon.
   ``We have not (yet) seen the deluge we're going to see if the
weather pattern stays the same,'' she said. ``Our office will be
like Sears, you'll have to take a number'' to be served.
   The selling point this year, said Tegels, is that people
collected on federal crop insurance policies.
   The Federal Crop Insurance Corp. reported paying claims of nearly
$1.2 billion on $435 million in premiums collected last year, said
Michael Forgash, a spokesman in Washington for the
government-supported program. The program insures against drought
losses and protects against insect infestation, plant disease, and
damage from hail, winds and flooding.
   The biggest payout to any state went to North Dakota, where $550
in claims were paid for every $100 in premiums collected, covering a
total of $187.1 million in damages.
   Iowa ranked second, with $127.7 million, or $320 in claims for
every $100 in premiums collected.
   Congress has warned that it won't be so willing to stage a rescue
this year for those who failed to insure themselves against losses
last year.
   ``I wouldn't count on it in 1989,'' said Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa.
   Tauke said Congress was able to help drought-plagued farmers last
year because there were ``a couple of billion dollars to play with''
after a miscalculation of the cost of the farm program, ``and it was
an election year.''
   Fueling the pressure to buy coverage was a requirement that those
who received federal emergency assistance last year be insured this
year.
   Bankers, too, are demanding borrowers to carry drought policies
as collateral on crop loans.
   Federal crop insurance plans allow farmers to choose coverage
that will pay the equivalent of 50 percent, 65 percent or 75 percent
of the 10-year average yields on production.
   Forgash said premium rates won't change this year as a result of
last year's heavy claims. He said the system is not geared to
reacting quickly to such payouts.
   ``It would be patently unfair to recover an entire catastrophic
loss in one insurance year,'' he said.
   The rush to insure apparently has not been affected by
allegations last year that an insurance company had reneged on
drought-insurance policies.
   The Chubb Corp. of New Jersey wound up agreeing to pay $48
million to settle a class-action lawsuit on behalf of about 8,000
farmers in 10 states.

<HEAD>Dream Fuels Native Runner's Quest For Sacred Object</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONALD POWERS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Cree Indian driven by a vision has led a
2,700-mile run to meet with museum officials and request that a
cloth-wrapped bundle sacred to the tribe be returned to his people
in western Canada.
   ``We've been running every mile of the way. ... It's Indian
custom to send foot messengers,'' Jim Thunder, 38, said Friday as he
and two companions neared the American Museum of Natural History.
   At stake is a bundle assembled by Chief Big Bear more than 150
years ago to give his people spiritual guidance and protection.
Complicating the quest is a competing claim for the relic and
museum's reluctance to part with it.
   ``In 1979, I had a dream in which Chief Big Bear appeared to me
and offered a ceremonial pipe with the request that I bring the
bundle home from New York City,'' Thunder said. ``I made a vow that
I would do it.''
   The calico-wrapped bundle _ about the size of two opened hands
and containing a bear claw, a clump of sweet grass and a plug of
tobacco _ was acquired by the museum in 1934 when a son of Big Bear
gave it to an anthropologist for safe keeping, said museum spokesman
Herb Kurz.
   The bundle, never put on display, has remained in storage as part
of a collection studied by scholars, Kurz said. It's also made
available to Indians who occasionally want to see it.
   Thunder, saying the sacred object is ``homesick,'' maintains it
should be returned to the Native Americans who would use it in their
religious ceremonies.
   Kurz said staff anthropologists would meet with Thunder on
Wednesday, but the spokesman held out little hope the museum would
surrender the bundle.
   ``This object was given to the museum by a son of the Chief Big
Bear. He asked the museum to keep it,'' Kurz said. ``The museum
doesn't usually give away objects that were acquired legitimately.''
   Thunder views himself as Big Bear's great-great grandson but
admits he's not a blood relative. ``In 1985 I was adopted by an old
Indian woman who was a great granddaughter of Big Bear,'' he said.
   Indians who oppose Thunder have asked the museum not to give him
the bundle.
   ``We want it. We're the descendants of this great man,'' Russell
Standing Rock, 36, said in a telephone interview from his home on
the Rocky Boy Indian reservation in Montana. ``He is my great-great
grandfather.''
   ``We don't even know Jim Thunder,'' he said.
   Standing Rock said his family and other Indians in Montana have
asked the museum to reject Thunder's claims and give the object to
them instead.
   But Thunder said: ``I'm not doing this because I'm a descendant
of Chief Big Bear. I'm doing it because Big Bear requested of me to
bring this bundle home. This is not something I chose for myself.''
   Big Bear, who created the bundle when he was 13, wore it into
battle in 1885, when the Cree joined Canadian rebel Louis Riel and
the Metis Indians of central Saskatchewan to fight white settlers.
Legend has it that the bundle helped Big Bear and his people escape
after the revolt failed.
   In the more than 50 years the museum has had the bundle, no one
made any attempt to return it to the Indian people before Thunder
began his run from Edmonton on Sept. 1.
   Thunder, a two-pack a day cigarette smoker, and companions
Lindsay Cote and Henry Basil, set out with a pace car, some money
and words of discouragement from critics who said they had little
chance of success.
   ``We were a determined little bunch. We left on faith and $135,''
Thunder said.
   Throughout, they depended on people they met for money, food and
shelter. At the Mohawk reservation near Montreal, Indian leaders
raised nearly $5,000 for the effort, he said.
   They occasionally had to wait out blizzards, but on the days they
could travel they averaged 20 miles a day, taking turns running
across southern Canada in a series of relays.
   If the object is surrendered by the museum, a council of three
chiefs, three elders and descendants of Big Bear will meet to decide
who will be named the keeper of the bundle, Thunder said.
   ``To us, it's not just a historical artifact. It has a lot of
ceremonial value, what you call spiritual significance,'' Thunder
said.
   And, if the museum refuses?
   ``We're going to honor that,'' Thunder said. ``We're not here to
have a protest rally, go on a hunger strike or do anything drastic.
It's just a simple request and all we want is an answer.''

<HEAD>Roh Cancels Referendum On His Performance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo announced today
that he is postponing a national referendum on his performance _ a
campaign promise _ and claimed leftist forces are trying to
overthrow the government.
   In a nationally televised address, Roh said the nation faces a
major threat from radical groups and that going ahead with the
referendum now would risk plunging South Korea into new chaos.
   ``Violent leftist forces are trying to overthrow the
government,'' he said.
   The former general said the referendum would be held sometime in
the future, but gave no indication of when or how. Roh had been
expected to announce this week that the referendum would be held
about April 12.
   It was not clear if Roh was backing away from the referendum
because of concern about potential unrest or because he feared the
government could not win the vote and might be forced into new
elections. Some government officials had expressed concern about
Roh's ability to win a referendum.
   The government had said earlier that Roh would not resign if he
was defeated, but some administration officials conceded a defeat
would put pressure on Roh to call elections.
   Critics said Roh could not win a referendum. Roh said on
television that ``it would not be of help to the country to hold a
national referendum for my performance in office at this juncture.''
   The main opposition parties said they accepted Roh's decision,
but would watch to ensure the government does not attempt to retreat
on any other promises to bring in full democracy.
   ``We feel sorry for the people to have such a president who has
unilaterally postponed the referendum without presenting a concrete
alternative,'' said the Reunification Democratic Party, one of the
two main opposition groups.
   Dissidents groups denounced Roh's decision, saying it proved the
government never intended to hold a referendum and proved that the
administration knew it could not win a popular vote.
   The United National Democratic Movement, the nation's main
dissident alliance, said it would proceed with plans to campaign for
Roh's ouster.
   ``Roh's postponement of the referendum is an act deceiving the
people,'' the alliance said.
   Several hundred radical students shouting ``Punish Roh Tae-woo''
attacked two police stations with firebombs today in the southern
city of Kwangju, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported. No
arrests or injuries were reported.
   Radicals have organized a series of violent anti-government
protests, but they lack broad public support.
   ``Leftist forces are trying to use the mid-term appraisal as a
foothold for overthrowing the free democratic system,'' Roh said.
   Roh has introduced broad democratic reforms since winning office
in late 1987, but many South Koreans distrust the government because
of its ties to the authoritarian regime of former President Chun
Doo-hwan.
   The Party of Peace and Democracy of Kim Dae-jung welcomed the
referendum delay. The Reunification Democratic Party of Kim
Young-sam said it would accept only a temporary delay.
   Kim Young-sam had been pushing for a referendum after predicting
Roh would lose. Kim Dae-jung opposed a referendum, apparently
because Kim Young-sam's party had overtaken his party in opinion
polls and could win presidential elections.
   The Kims are bitter rivals who split the opposition vote in the
December 1987 elections, allowing Roh to win with 36 percent of the
vote. Roh promised during the election campaign to hold a referendum
after his first year in office to give voters a chance to evaluate
his performance.

<HEAD>FBI Says Mafia Families Argued Over Proposed Film About Crime Figure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A film proposal to depict the story of the
late mob leader Meyer Lansky reportedly triggered a struggle between
two powerful Mafia families, according to federal court documents.
   Recently unsealed FBI affidavits revealed evidence that New
York's Genovese crime family wanted to win the lead role for actor
James Caan, the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday.
   A prominent Hollywood executive backing a different script about
Lansky turned for help to the rival Gambino crime family, according
to the affidavits.
   The present status of the rival concepts weren't reported.
   The involvement of the Genovese and Gambino crime families
demonstrated the fascination mobsters have with their image, as well
as with potential profits from box-office successes, the Times said.
   The bickering over the Lansky film began in 1987 when ``The
Untouchables,'' a film about Treasury Agent Elliot Ness' campaign
against Al Capone, already had grossed nearly $75 million, the
newspaper said.
   Lansky died in 1983 at age 81 as what investigators called the
undisputed patriarch of an organized crime syndicate founded on
drugs, loan sharking, gambling and prostitution.
   Martin Bacow, a writer, producer and labor negotiator, claimed to
have known Lansky personally and said in 1987 he already had a
Lansky script in hand.
   Eugene F. Giaquinto, then president of MCA Inc.'s Home Video
Division, tentatively offered to pay Bacow $4.5 million for the
video and pay-television rights to the film if it was made, the
newspaper said.
   But Bacow said Caan was proposing his own Lansky project and
allegedly told several reputed members of the Los Angeles Mafia
family during a dinner party that the rival movie would ``never be
distributed,'' according to the newspaper.
   Caan's attorney, Donald E. Santarelli, said the actor dined with
Mafia figures but neither made nor was aware of any attempt to
interfere with Bacow's project.
   He called the dinners actor's research, saying Caan has had a
fascination with organized crime figures since his Oscar-nominated
performance in ``The Godfather.''
   There is no evidence he knew that the mob tried to intercede on
his behalf, the newspaper said.
   But the FBI is investigating whether Genovese family members
tried to pressure Bacow and Giaquinto.
   Federal agents also contend Giaquinto said in a telephone call
that he had thwarted Genovese pressure tactics by getting help from
the Gambino crime family.
   Giaquinto was unavailable for comment Sunday. He was put on
forced leave of absence from MCA, and his attorney, Richard P. Crain
Jr., does not have a local telephone listing. A call to MCA was not
answered.

   U.S. observers called El

election was free and fair,'' the 21-member delegation said in a

and was to leave today. They visited about 50 of the nation's 262
precincts.
   ``I think I'll call it a successful election. It wasn't peaceful,
but it was successful,'' Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the delegation
chariman, told a news conference Sunday evening after the polls
closed.
   Florida Gov. Robert Martinez praised the voting as a victory over
leftist rebels who have been at war with the U.S.-backed government
for nine years.
   ``This nation wants to govern itself with the most powerful
ammunition there is: the vote,'' the Republican governor said.
   Despite widespread fighting between government troops and the
guerrillas, the observers were never exposed to combat or attack,
officials said.
   The observers said they talked to voters, election workers and
soldiers.
   ``What we have observed in El Salvador is a passionate commitment
of a people to participate in the democratic process despite being
faced with: intimidation, threats, violence and death from persons
outside the political process,'' the report said.
   Still, observer William Doherty of the AFL-CIO said rebel
intimidation hindered the voting. ``We have still got a long way to
go until we call this a democracy,'' he said.
   The White House named the official delegation of congress
members, state politicans and private citizens. The U.S. Embassy
selected the precincts the observers visited by motorcade and
helicopter.
   Earlier in the day, delegation members said the balloting
appeared to be conducted under conditions designed to prevent fraud.
   U.S. Ambassador William Walker said the rebels ``didn't stop a
lot of people voting today. We saw nothing but essentially a civic
fiesta.''
   Delegation member Rep. Robert K. Dornan, R-Calif., said he
welcomed a victory by the right-wing Nationalist Republican
Alliance, or Arena, over the incumbent Christian Democrats.
   ``Now I see that the momentum has changed to the Arena party,''
Dornan said. ``I'm a conservative. It's time for my guys to win.''
   Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., said Arena supporters apparently
turned out strongly, lining up at polling stations in the capital
and countryside. ``It looks like they (the voters) were chosen by
the Arena party,'' he said.
   Coelho said disputes may arise in Washington after the election
because current policies have not brought an end to the war and
Congress will need to debate whether military and economic aid to El
Salvador should continue at present levels.

   Here is a chronology of events
in El Salvador's history over the past 10 years:
   _Oct. 15, 1979: A group of reformist military officers overthrows
the rightist government of President Gen. Carlos Humberto Romero.
Cols. Adolfo Arnoldo Mejano and Jaime Abdul Gutierrez install a
junta of themselves and three civilians.
   _Jan. 1, 1980: Civilian junta members resign, including Social
Democrat Guillermo Ungo, who claims the government is moving too
slowly to improve social conditions. Ungo later becomes a political
leader of the guerrillas.
   _March 1980: Jose Napoleon Duarte, a Christian Democrat, joins
the junta.
   _March 24, 1980: Roman Catholic Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero
is assassinated as he celebrates Mass. Linked to the killing is
Roberto d'Aubuisson, who the following year founds the rightist
Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena. D'Aubuisson denies the
charge.
   _March 30, 1980: Scores die when gunmen fire on a crowd attending
Romero's funeral.
   _April 1980: Leftist organizations form the Democratic
Revolutionary Front to become the political wing of the rebel
movement.
   _Oct. 5, 1980: Five rebel groups form the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front.
   _Dec. 2, 1980: Four American women _ three Roman Catholic nuns
and a lay worker _ are kidnapped. Their bodies are found in a
shallow grave Dec. 4.
   _Dec. 5, 1980: The United States suspends military and economic
aid to El Salvador pending determination of those responsible for
the killings. Four National Guardsmen ultimately are sentenced to 30
years in prison for the murders.
   _Dec. 12, 1980: Duarte is named the first civilian president of
El Salvador in 30 years.
   _Jan. 3, 1981: The president of the Salvadoran Institute of
Agrarian Reform and two U.S. labor advisers are killed.
   _March 28, 1982: First elections for a National Assembly. Of 60
seats at stake, 24 go to Christian Democrats, 19 to Arena and the
remainder to smaller political groups.
   _March 25, 1984: Duarte and d'Aubuisson finish ahead of four
other candidates in the first round of presidential elections.
Guerrillas boycott and threaten violence.
   _May 6, 1984: Duarte defeats d'Aubuisson in runoff elections and
becomes first civilian president chosen by popular vote in 50 years.
   _March 31, 1985: Congressional and municipal elections. Christian
Democrats win 33 of 60 assembly seats.
   _March 1988: Congressional and municipal elections. Arena takes
32 of 60 congressional seats.
   _June 1988: Duarte is found to have terminal liver cancer.
   _Jan. 24, 1989: The guerrillas offer to participate in the
presidential election and abide by the results if it is postponed
from March 19 until September and security and anti-fraud conditions
are adopted. The rebels withdraw the proposal after discussions with
the political parties fail to achieve progress.

   Here is a look at El Salvador,
where voters have elected a new president.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GEOGRAPHY _ The country covers 8,260 square miles, about the size
of Massachusetts. It is rugged, a land of volcanoes and lakes and
rich soil. It is about 950 miles southwest of Miami, 950 miles
southeast of Brownsville, Texas.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   POPULATION _ Its more than 5 million people are mainly Roman
Catholic and mestizo _ people of both Indian and Spanish heritage.
More than 500,000 of its residents have fled its 9-year-old civil
war, most of them to the United States.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ It was conquered in 1525 by the Spanish. It became
independent on Sept. 15, 1821 and joined the Central American
Federation, which later split into the nations that now make up
Central America.
   It was ruled for most of this century by a land-owning oligarchy
in alliance with the military.
   In 1932 a peasant rebellion organized by Farabundo Marti was
crushed by a military regime that killed 30,000 people; the leader
of that rebellion inspired the present guerrillas, the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ECONOMY _ It is mostly agricultural, with coffee the main cash
crop. In the 1960s and 1970s it became a manufacturing center for
the Central American market. Its largest input is U.S. military and
civil aid, which comes to $1.5 million a day.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE WAR _ The conflict began in 1979 when a group of young
officers overthrew former president Gen. Carlos Humberto Romero. A
junta tried to impose agrarian and social reforms, but dissatisfied
leftists began a rebellion in late 1979.
   The conflict has led to more than 70,000 deaths, most of them
civilian, and many suspected leftists killed by right-wing death
squads in the early 1980s.
   In 1984, Jose Napoleon Duarte, a Christian Democrat, became the
first popularly elected president in 50 years. Sunday's election
marks the first time Salvadorans have had a chance to replace an
incumbent civilian government with a different party.

   Nineteen Marines were killed and 16
injured today when a helicopter crashed in remote mountains,
officials said. It was the second Marine chopper disaster in South
Korea in four days.
   The troop-carrying CH53-D Sea Stallion helicopter crashed near
the port of Pohang on the southeast coast while taking part in
exercises with South Korean forces, a Marine Corps. spokesman said.
   All 34 Marines aboard the aircraft were killed or injured, the
spokesman said on condition of anonymity. Those hurt included 15
Marines aboard the helicopter and one hurt on the ground during
rescue operations.
   Nine of the injured were listed in very serious condition with
burns, four were in serious condition, and the status of three was
undetermined, hospital officials said.
   Marine officials initially said 22 Marines were killed in the
crash, but later lowered the figure to 19 because of confusion in
early reports from the crash site.
   The helicopter was carrying four crewmen and 30 infantrymen when
it crashed, the spokesman said. The infantrymen were from the 1st
Battalion, 5th Marines of the 1st Marine Division based at Camp
Pendleton, Calif., he said.
   Marine officials said they had no immediate word on what caused
the crash. Little of the helicopter was left but charred pieces of
wreckage.
   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, cited South Korean military
officials as saying the helicopter exploded in the air and burst
into flames before slamming into the ground. The report said the
helicopter appeared to have a problem in its engines.
   A Seoul newspaper, the Kookmin Ilbo, quoted a farmer who saw the
crash as saying two helicopters were hovering about 250 feet above
the ground when one suddenly turned upside down and plunged into a
creek. About 10 soldiers leaped out of the helicopter as it hit the
ground, the report said.
   Investigators were sent to the crash site to try to determine
what happened, but no quick results were expected, the Marine
spokesman said.
   It was the second fatal crash involving a Marine helicopter in
South Korea in four days. All four Marines aboard a CH-46 helicopter
were killed Friday when their craft crashed in a rice paddy on the
east coast.
   Marine investigators are still trying to determine the cause of
Friday's crash.
   Both helicopters were taking part in annual ``Team Spirit''
exercises involving about 200,000 South Korean and U.S. troops. The
exercises practice bringing in U.S. reinforcements in the event of a
communist North Korean attack.
   Both aircraft were operating temporarily from the USS Belleau
Wood, a Marine assault ship located off the South Korean coast
during the joint maneuvers, which began Tuesday.
   Marine officials withheld the identity of the victims in today's
crash pending notification of relatives. Some of the injured were
taken to the Belleau Wood, and others were evacuated to a U.S.
hospital in Seoul.
   The helicopter itself was assigned to the 1st Marine Air Wing
based at Futenma Marine Corps Air Station in Okinawa, Japan, the
officials said.
   The helicopter involved in the crash Friday was assigned to the
13th Marine Expeditionary Unit, also based at Camp Pendleton.
   The United States has about 43,000 troops based in South Korea
under a mutual defense treaty. About 30,000 U.S. troops from the
United States and other parts of Asia are in South Korea to take
part in the maneuvers.

<HEAD>Women At The Top Of Connecticut's Judiciary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK SEAVY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top judges in Connecticut's federal
district, state Supreme Court and state Appellate Court are women,
but the members of this unique judicial troika say women still have
ground to make up.
   Ellen Bree Burns is chief judge for the U.S. District Court in
Connecticut, Ellen Ash Peters is chief justice of the state Supreme
Court and Antoinette L. Dupont is chief judge of the Appellate Court.
   The state attorney general also is a woman. Clarine Nardi Riddle
was promoted to acting attorney general when her former boss, Joseph
Lieberman, won a U.S. Senate seat in November.
   No other state has a similar combination of top female jurists,
and the judges say the distinction underscores not how far women
have come, but how far they have to go.
   ``Overall, one can't be overjoyed by the fact that a few of us do
have positions that are conspicuous,'' said Peters, 58, who was
appointed to the Supreme Court in 1978 and became chief justice in
1984.
   ``There's more to be done and the fact that I'm the chief
justice, Antoinette Dupont is the chief judge in the Appellate
Court, Ellen Bree Burns is the chief judge in the federal district
and Clarine Nardi Riddle is attorney general, doesn't mean it's
over.''
   The country's only other female state Supreme Court chief justice
is Dorothy Comstock Riley in Michigan.
   In the federal system, Judith W. Rogers serves as chief judge for
the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
   Of the state appellate courts, only Dupont serves as a chief
judge, said Philip A. Lattimore, staff director for the National
Association of Women Judges in Williamsburg, Va.
   Nationally, 1,200 of 25,000 state judges are women. These include
30 women supreme court justices and 66 appellate judges, Lattimore
said.
   ``We are at a point in our history where women are entering the
state courts of last resort (supreme courts),'' he said.
   The ranks of female jurists is bound to increase because about
half of the students in law schools now are women, Lattimore said.
   Elaine Martin, an assistant political science professor at
Eastern Michigan State University, said women are bringing a fresh
perspective to courtrooms.
   ``Some say they are more compassionate and others say they are
more attuned to gender bias,'' said Martin, who has a $10,000 grant
from the American Center for Women in Politics to study the
influence of women in the nation's state supreme courts.
   A state task force is preparing a report on gender bias in
Connecticut courts based on testimony gathered during public
hearings last year.
   The report is expected to cite examples of bias including male
attorneys frequently addressing female witnesses by their first
names while being more formal with male witnesses.
   Members of the General Assembly's Judiciary Committee have asked
female judicial candidates whether their family life would interfere
with judicial affairs. One candidate was asked if she would be able
to meet mortgage payments on a judge's salary.
   The three judges say signs of continuing gender bias don't
suprise them. They saw plenty while breaking into the legal
profession in the 1950s.
   ``You were often told: `We don't hire women because our clients
don't like women lawyers,''' said 60-year-old Dupont, recalling her
days as an attorney in New York City.
   Burns, 65, recalled the cold reception she got at lawyers'
function years ago.
   ``I went to a New Haven County Bar Association meeting and they
told me I was in the wrong place,'' she said. ``I assured them that
if this was a bar association meeting, then I was in the right
place.''

<DATELINE>SHEFFIELD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rioters broke windows and spray-painted
buildings in a Moslem neighborhood of this northern city with
slogans of support for Salman Rushdie, whose novel ``The Satanic
Verses'' has enraged many Moslems.
   Reporters saw windows smashed, small trees pulled up, paint
sprayed on cars, homes and religious centers, and painted slogans
demanding Rushdie be left in peace. No injuries were reported after
the rampage Sunday night.
   Many Moslems believe Rushdie's novel blasphemes their religion.
After protests in India, Pakistan, and other countries against the
book, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on Feb. 14 called on Moslems to
seek out and kill Rushdie.
   The novelist, a naturalized Briton born to a Moslem family in
India, has since gone into hiding.
   The Sheffield neighborhood where the rioting occurred is mainly
inhabited by Pakistanis. The words, ``Pakis die,'' were scrawled on
a mosque.
   Police said they made no immediate arrests.
   ``Community relations in this area are good. We cannot say what
is behind the incidents at this stage,'' said a police spokesman who
would not give his name.
   ``So many cars and homes were attacked it seems like the work of
an organized gang,'' said city councilman Choudry Walayat.
   Local lawmaker Pat Duffy said: ``In the context of the Rushdie
affair, it is very alarming.''
   At least 19 people have been killed in India and Pakistan in
riots protesting the novel.

<HEAD>Socialist Party Gains in Several Large Cities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Socialists wrested control of several large
cities from conservative and center-right parties in municipal
elections that party leaders said represented a vote of confidence
in President Francois Mitterand.
   ``It's a very beautiful and very ample victory for the president,
the government and the presidential majority,'' Socialist Premier
Michel Rocard said of the results in Sunday's vote.
   ``It is the first time that we have seen a government receive a
powerful, popular encouragement during the municipal elections,''
said Socialist Interior Minister Pierre Joxe.
   The first round of the municipal elections was held last week. In
communities where no slate won 50 percent of the vote then, all
slates that won at least 10 percent were eligible to participate in
the second round.
   Turnout in this ninth trip to the polls for the French in less
than a year was estimated at between 72 and 73.5 percent.
   Conservative bastions such as Strasbourg, Mulhouse, Brest,
Dunkirk, Orleans, Blois, Avignon and Quimper fell into Socialist
hands on Sunday. The right made some inroads into leftist territory,
but in general won fewer, smaller cities.
   Many of the conservatives' problems were caused by the extreme
right National Front, which siphoned votes from the traditional
rightist parties in the runoffs. The conservative Rally for the
Republic (RPR) and the center-right Union for French Democracy (UDF)
refused to deal with the National Front for second-round support.
   ``It would be an exaggeration to believe that we are seeing a
grassroots wave for the presidential majority,'' said RPR Secretary
General Alain Juppe. ``It's true that the Socialist Party is
retaking a part of the terrain that it had lost in 1983, but only a
part.''
   The overall number of municipalities with a population of more
than 30,000 lost by the right was small, but the right lost
important cities while taking smaller, less important ones from the
left.
   The right had made serious gains in the country's city councils
in 1983, two years after the Socialists came to power nationally.
   Said former conservative Premier Jacques Chirac, mayor of Paris
who turned in one of the few smashing victories of the night: ``On
the national level, we have seen the Socialists win back cities they
lost six years ago. And it is a victory for them. On the other hand,
the number of abstentionists, the large number of votes for the
Ecologist and National Front slates, expresses a malaise.''
   Perhaps the Socialists' most satisfying victory came in
Strasbourg, where they ousted an incumbent center-right mayor in an
election in which the Ecologist slate also won 12 percent.
   The results confirmed the leftist trend that re-elected
Mitterrand last spring and gave him a leftist majority in the
National Assembly. Frequently, local elections are used as a means
of protesting government policy, but that was not the case this
year. Races largely were fought on local issues.
   There was a little good news on the right, however. Chirac, who
won a ``grand slam'' in 1983 by taking all 20 of Paris' districts,
repeated the feat, despite a cliffhanger in the 20th district where
National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen's slate drew away a lot of
votes.
   It was satisfying for Chirac, who took a battering from
Mitterrand in presidential elections last May.
   Another ``grand slam'' was registered by Michel Noir, a
conservative deputy in the National Assembly and former foreign
trade minister. Noir, a dynamic, 45-year-old politician, won all
nine of the districts in the southeastern city of Lyon, France's
third-largest municipality, defeating a center-right incumbent.
   Le Pen said the traditional right's strategy of refusing to deal
with the National Front had failed yet again. ``The National Front
has shown by its sucess that it (accepting the National Front) is
unavoidable.''
   The Front's campaign focusings largely on anti-immigration and
law and order issues.

<TEXT>
   A 43-hour hostage siege ended in tragedy
when a ``mentally deranged'' gunman killed his girlfriend,
critically wounded her sister and then fatally shot himself,
authorities said.
   The bodies were discovered Sunday evening after police fired tear
gas into the heavily barricaded house.
   ``We thought that it got to the point after 40 hours of
negotiating that we had done all that we could and we were concerned
about the lives of the two remaining hostages,'' said Police Chief
Mike Walton.
   Police fired the first of two tear gas volleys into the house
about 20 minutes after the gunman, Douglas ``Dougie'' Thomas, had
discarded the phone he had been using to talk with police, Walton
said.
   ``The negotiations got to the point where it wasn't
negotiating,'' Walton said. ``He never had any demands. He never had
anything. He was mentally deranged.''
   Police rushed the house after they heard Thomas singing, Walton
said. Two wounded hostages were found by the front door under
several quilts, the chief said.
   Thomas and his girlfriend, Karen Lambert, both 20, were dead of
gunshot wounds when they arrived at St. John's Hospital, said
Sangamon County Coroner Norman Richter.
   Ms. Lambert's 14-year-old sister, Nicole, was in critical
condition today after surgery for a gunshot wound to the head,
hospital spokeswoman Agnes Hayner said.
   During the standoff, Thomas released unharmed his girlfriend's
4-year-old daughter, Katrina Lambert, after police cut off
electricity and gas to the house, said police Cmdr. Dave Searcy.
   Another hostage, Kelisa Lambert, the 2{-month-old daughter of
Thomas and his girlfriend, was released Saturday, police said.
   Police did not know what led Thomas to take the hostages, Walton
said.
   Heavily armed police had surrounded the house, which Searcy said
is the home of the Lambert sisters and their mother. More than 30
families were evacuated Saturday from neighboring houses.
   Police were called to the house late Friday in response to a
report of a domestic disturbance.
   Police spokesman Neil Williamson said Thomas was hospitalized
recently for depression, and police believe he had been taking
medication that might have affected his moods.
   Thomas spent a year in prison for shooting two men at a dance in
1985. A judge reduced charges of attempted murder to two counts of
aggravated battery, because a question existed about whether Thomas
intended to kill the men.

<TEXT>
   A political game of musical chairs has
some Republicans fearing they could be left standing in the cold
while the Democrats plop into a GOP congressional seat.
   On March 28, for the second time in less than five months, voters
will elect a U.S. House representative from northeast Indiana's 4th
District.
   Last November, the seat was again a Republican shoo-in,
little-watched as political interests focused on closer races.
   The good fortune of two Indiana Republicans, however, may have
changed that.
   With the election of Dan Quayle to the vice presidency and the
appointment of incumbent Rep. Dan Coats to fill Quayle's vacated
Senate seat, Republicans were forced to pick a special election
candidate from a field of relative unknowns.
   Against the GOP choice, the Democrats already had decided to run
Jill Long, a candidate with a mixed resume. Long already had lost
two races for federal office, both by wide margins: Quayle defeated
her in 1986 to win a second Senate term and Coats repeated the
drubbing in 1988 for his fifth House term.
   The Republicans picked Dan Heath, a 36-year-old aide to Fort
Wayne Mayor Paul Helmke. Heath, an attorney with Washington
experience as a member of Coats' staff, had never sought elective
office.
   He began the campaign largely unrecognized outside Fort Wayne,
where he had served Helmke's administration as public safety
director, Republicans concede. Long, on the other hand, despite her
defeats, was better known among voters when the campaign began in
mid-January.
   With both parties predicting an extremely low voter turnout,
Republicans fear a Democratic candidate could slip through the lines.
   ``There's nothing we'll need to do that we won't do,'' said Rich
Galen, director of the National Republican Congressional Committee.
``We're not going to lose this seat.''
   The committee has given Heath's campaign access to active
contributors, help with voter turnout programs and phone banks. The
GOP committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee
may spend an estimated $50,000 in cash and even more with in-kind
contributions on the campaign.
   Democrats concede the circumstances of a special election mean
problems for their candidate as well. A low voter turnout in a
district that has voted 2-1 Republican in past congressional races
may still favor the GOP. And Long, as well as Heath, has had trouble
igniting enthusiasm among party stalwarts during the relatively
brief period between nomination and election, both sides say.
   Neither candidate has a lengthy public record to run on, or to
attack.
   Long has attempted to play on a perceived resentment of
attorneys, frequently pointing out that Heath holds a law degree and
contending that Washington doesn't need another lawyer.
   Heath reaches back more than a decade to critize Long for
supporting a local tax increase while a member of the Valparaiso
City Council in the 1970s. He has attempted to tag Long as a
liberal, with one advertisement combining photos of Long and Michael
Dukakis, the 1988 Democratic presidential candidate whose
unsuccessful campaign was wounded by the same label.

<HEAD>Chrysler and Sears Won't Advertise On NBC Show</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chrysler Corp. and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. have
decided not to advertise any more on NBC-TV's ``Nightingales,''
which has provoked criticism from women because it has shown
scantily clad nurses.
   Chrysler advertised on one episode of the Wednesday night series
about student nurses because NBC owed it time, said Chrysler
spokesman Thomas Houston.
   But, ``based on the response we got from viewers, which was
obviously negative,'' the company reviewed the show and decided not
to continue, Houston said.
   Sears ran a few commercials about its new pricing strategy, but
``we pulled the one more that we had because we decided that the
program did not meet our guidelines as suitable for family
viewing,'' said a spokeswoman, Kathy Gucfa.
   The Kansas City-based American Nursing Association said last week
it has circulated lists of ``Nightingales'' advertisers to its
189,000 members, urging them to ``communicate their concerns'' about
the series, which began Jan. 25.
   ``Nightingales'' exploits women, said association spokeswoman
Carol Grimaldi.
   ``It uses nurses to show these very pretty girls in their
underwear and in the shower,'' Grimaldi said. ``It shows very lax
educational standards _ when it does say anything about nursing
education.''
   NBC responded that ```Nightingales' is a continuing drama about
the personal lives of fictional people who happen to be nurses.''
The network noted that a registered nurse reviews every script and
consults with the production company on nursing procedures and other
medical aspects.
   ``It's a drama about young women coming of age in Los Angeles
today,'' added NBC publicist Merry Aronson. ``It's very focused on
their personal lives. The hospital setting is almost an aside.''

   An angry crowd chanting ``Devil!''
drove away family members from their house, where authorities said
the body of a neighborhood teen-ager had been found two weeks
earlier.
   The dead girl's uncle, Robert Player, said Sunday that neighbors
will ``never allow these people to ever live here again.''
   More than 40 people taunted the Golub family outside the Long
Island residence where the body of Kelly Tinyes, 13, was found March
4.
   The Golub family returned to the house Saturday night for the
first time since investigators ordered them out.
   ``Monsters! Seed of the devil! Get out,'' jeered members of the
crowd, which included the dead girl's father, Richard Tinyes.
   Ms. Tinyes was seen entering the Golub home March 3, but was
never seen leaving. Her body was found in the basement, authorities
said. Investigators had ordered the Golubs to vacate their house
because it was the scene of the crime.
   Police have said the only two suspects in the case were the two
Golub brothers, Robert, 21, and John, 14, but no arrests have been
made. The Nassau County district attorney plans to present evidence
to a grand jury on Wednesday.
   The two-hour verbal assault on the family began when Robert Golub
left the house on foot and was followed by Richard Tinyes and an
angry crowd.
   A Nassau County police spokesman, Officer Charles Koller, said a
patrolling officer saw Golub being followed and called for
assistance.
   When Golub reached a grocery store about six blocks from his
home, some of those following repeatedly called him a ``devil.''
   Eight police cars arrived, and officers protected Golub as he
left the store with his older sister, Adele, who had come to pick
him up in a car.
   The shouting continued, with one member of the crowd calling out
to Ms. Golub, ``You are a devil for being with him.''
   Ms. Golub yelled back, ``My brothers were innocent,'' then broke
into sobs.
   As neighbors continued to shout outside the home, Robert, Adele
and John and their mother, Elizabeth, left the house and drove away.
   About 10 minutes later, their father, John Sr., left in a
separate car, to the applause of the crowd.
   The Golubs' destination was not known, said Koller.
   The family's lawyer, John O'Grady, said: ``They pay taxes on the
house there, so why shouldn't the Golubs go back home? Where else
are they supposed to go? ... Should they be deprived of going home?''
   He said the family had not requested police protection.
   One neighbor, Jack DeLuca, told reporters: ``We're not
vigilantes; we would not have killed them. We are aware they have
due process of law. But based on the circumstantial evidence, how
could you just come back?''

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed, Gold Little Changed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed in thin European trading
today. Gold prices were little changed.
   Foreign currency dealers said interest in dollar-buying was
dampened by fears of central bank intervention. Central banks in
several European countries reportedly intervened in the currency
markets on Thursday and Friday.
   ``It's very quiet,'' said a trader at a large West German bank in
Frankfurt. ``I don't think the dollar is going to do much today. I
think, if anything, we're at the top of the range now.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.85 yen to a closing 131.92. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 131.80 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday:
   _1.8749 West German marks, down from 1.8770
   _1.6155 Swiss francs, up from 1.6140
   _6.3465 French francs, up from 6.3450
   _2.1146 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1145
   _1,375.00 Italian lire, down from 1,376.25
   _1.1953 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1965
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7137, slightly more
expensive for buyers than $1.7135 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $395 a troy ounce, up
from $393.25 bid late Friday. At midmorning today, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $395.30.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $393, unchanged from late Friday's
bid price.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.94 to close at a bid $396.81.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.17 a troy ounce,
up from Friday's $6.14.

<HEAD>PLO Wants Talks Upgraded So Arafat Can Take Part</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Palestine Liberation Organization
wants to upgrade the level of its talks with the United States so
PLO chairman Yasser Arafat can take part, the Palestinian ambassador
to Riyadh said today.
   Ambassador Rafik Natsheh reiterated the PLO position while
denying a published report that said Arafat would participate at the
next round of the PLO-U.S. talks on Wednesday in Tunisia.
   ``Yasser Arafat will not take part in the talks with the
Americans at the level of ambassadors,'' said Natsheh. ``We are
demanding that the United States upgrade the level of the talks so
that Abu Ammar can take part.'' Abu Ammar is an Arafat nickname.
   To upgrade the talks would be place them on a level
``commensurate with the developments in the region,'' said Natsheh,
who also expressed ``strong displeasure ... at the slow pace'' of
the dialogue to date.
   He added: ``We look forward to serious American-Palestinian talks
through which we can reach a just settlement that guarantees the
Palestinian people's rights.''
   The dialogue began formally on Dec. 16 when Washington lifted a
13-year ban on official dealings with the PLO after Arafat and the
Palestine National Council, which acts as a parliament-in-exile,
made clear their acceptance of the state of Israel and renounced
terrorism.
   The PLO is seeking to create a Palestinian state in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, where Palestinians have been demonstrating for 15
months against Israel's 21-year military occupation.
   The U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, Robert Pelletreau, is the highest
ranking American diplomat authorized to handle discussions with the
PLO.
   The session in Tunisia on Wednesday will only be the second
formal session, but there have been informal contacts between
Pelletreau and the Palestinians.
   His PLO counterpart in the talks has been Yasser Abed-Rabbo, a
member of the PLO executive committee.
   A weekend report in the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Rai Al-Aam said
Arafat would sit opposite Pelletreau at the Wednesday session.
Arafat is presently in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, where the PLO
has military headquarters.
   Meanwhile, Salah Khalaf, Arafat's second-in-command in the
mainstream PLO group Fatah, was quoted as saying that no particular
agenda has been fixed for the Wednesday session.
   Khalaf, in statements published in the Saudi Arabian newspaper
Okaz, said the talks will be open to deal with ``all issues and
measures related to developments of the Palestinian case and the
practical American steps to solve the problem.''
   Khalaf also disclosed that Arafat will be holding a summit
session with President Francois Mitterrand of France in Egypt in
April.
   Under the PLO umbrella are several organizations which sometimes
battle among themselves.
   In Damscus, Syria, the dissident Palestinian Fatah-Uprising
guerrilla group threatened Sunday to assassinate Palestinians who
make direct contact with Israeli leaders.
   In a statement sent to The Associated Press, Fatah-Uprising
particularly mentioned people ``considered by the enemy close to the
Palestine Liberation Organization.'' It gave no names in the threat,
which apparently was designed to jeopardize Arafat's peace
initiatives.
   On Friday, Arafat spokesman Bassam Abu Sharif said several
Palestinians have been meeting with the Israelis.
   Fatah-Uprising, a Syrian-backed group led by Col. Saeed Mousa,
broke away from Arafat's mainstream Fatah movement in 1983.

   Two children were rescued unharmed
when police stormed a townhouse, shot a blind escaped murderer to
death and captured his partner to end a 34-hour standoff.
   Larry Hill was holding a knife at the throat of 6-year-old Cameo
Platt when officers stormed the house early Sunday and an officer
fired a single shot that struck Hill in the face, said police Capt.
Bruce Erickson.
   The girl's 8-year-old brother, Dominic, was nearby when the
shooting occurred. Police had detonated two ``flash-bang'' grenades
before bursting into the home.
   Such grenades are designed for shock value rather than to cause
injury.
   Hill, an inmate at Stillwater State Prison east of St. Paul,
escaped from a medical office Friday morning while he was being
escorted by two guards to an appointment for a replacement of his
glass eye.
   His accomplice, Willie Johnson, armed with a handgun and wearing
a Halloween mask, appeared at the downtown office and helped him
overpower the guards and escape, police said.
   The men then went to Lois Platt's house in this town south of
Minneapolis-St. Paul and initially held her and her children.
   Police grabbed Platt when she left the house Saturday morning to
start a car. She struggled with officers when they refused to let
her return to her children, said Police Capt. Terry Cook.
   Police decided to move into the house early Sunday after the men
threatened to kill one of the children if they weren't allowed to
leave.
   ``They said they had to be allowed to leave. If they didn't, they
were going to throw a dead child out,'' said Cook.
   ``We basically had a hard decision to make as to when the best
opportunity would present itself and we had to be ready to go when
it did.''
   The special weapons and tactics team moved in when the door
opened for soft drinks to be delivered.
   ``The children seemed perfectly fine when we found them. They
cried and said they missed their mother,'' Cook said.
   Platt had corresponded with Hill in prison, but her
sister-in-law, Peggy Platt, said she broke off the relationship more
than 18 months ago when she discovered Hill had been convicted of
strangling his girlfriend.
   Hill, 49, was sentenced to 27 years in prison on a charge of
second-degree murder in 1982 and was serving his fifth prison stint,
said Tom Dowdle, associate warden at the Stillwater prison. He also
had convictions for rape, robbery, criminal sexual assault, burglary
and illegal handgun possession.
   Johnson, a former inmate at the Stillwater prison, sustained a
minor injury and was treated at a hospital before being jailed, said
Police Chief Lloyd Rivers.

   Voters have cleared the way for this
tiny principality to seek membership in the United Nations.
   Residents voted 4,787-3,644 on Sunday against a proposed
constitutional amendment that would have required a vote of the
people before Liechtenstein could join an international body.
   The nation's regent, Prince Hans Adam, has been the leading
advocate of a U.N. role for the principality of 26,000 people.
   Addressing the opening session of the new Parliament, elected two
weeks ago, the prince on Saturday urged legislators to act soon on
the issue, saying U.N. membership was vital for the country.
   He said only by joining the world body could Liechtenstein obtain
worldwide recognition as a sovereign state.
   Liechtenstein is bounded by Austria and Switzerland.

   Thousands of people welcomed
the return of the swallows to Mission San Juan Capistrano, but they
were a little late: The birds arrived in February.
   Tourists came from as far away as New York City to witness the
traditional St. Joseph's Day arrival.
   There may have been few swallows, but 94-year-old Paul Arbiso
began his annual rite of ringing the mission courtyard bells on
schedule on Sunday, which also marked the 50th anniversary of Leon
Rene's 1939 song, ``When the Swallows Come Back to Capistrano.''
   ``For the air fare that I paid from New York, I wanted swarms,''
said Colleen Dunn-Holzworth, 21, of New York City, a Rutgers
University student spending spring break in Southern California.
   Television camera crews eager for the proper dramatic effect
resorted to throwing pebbles at the mission walls to get the already
nesting birds to take flight.
   Although bird watchers say the swallows now roost throughout the
sprawling Orange County community, tourists swarmed to the mission
area and to nearby gift shops.
   This year, the first of the birds reached Southern California in
February, said Sandy Wohlgemuth of the Audubon Society Los Angeles.
   First accounts of the swallows coming from South America to San
Juan Capistrano date to 1776, the year Father Junipero Serra founded
the picturesque mission as part of Spain's effort to colonize the
New World.
   Mission museum director Nick Magalousis said the birds' numbers
at the mission have dwindled in recent years as they choose new
sites to roost.
   ``The main place that's most obvious is the Mission Viejo Mall,''
he said, referring to a nearby shopping center. ``There's hundreds
of nests over there.''

   Yolonda's first lesson about guns was almost her
last.
   It happened two years ago while she was taking a nap, the
third-grader said.
   ``I felt something very, very hard under the mattress,'' she
said. ``I picked up the mattress and I saw a big old gun and it
almost went off.''
   In the Dade County public schools, children are no strangers to
guns. Thirty-eight students died of gunshot wounds in the first 11
months of 1988.
   The public school system has gotten into the business of gun
education, launching a ``Say No to Guns'' program modeled after the
``Just Say No To Drugs'' campaign.
   ``It's just another `no,''' said Bill Harris, safety and driver
education supervisor with the Dade County Public Schools.
   Superintendent Joseph Fernandez issued a memo alerting staff that
gun safety would be a priority. Last Dec. 9 was proclaimed ``Gun
Safety Awareness Day.''
   Principals in all the county's schools delivered messages on
firearm safety to kick off the program, which was supported by
posters.
   At Yolonda's elementary school in Miami's Overtown, notorious as
the scene of civil disturbances, high crime rates have given the
neighborhood an atmosphere reminiscent of frontier days in the last
century.
   ``It's very scary sometimes,'' first grade teacher Sandra Banky
said. ``Some of the parents come in and they're actually carrying
guns.''
   One of her students, a 6-year-old, has been instructed in how to
use a gun by a guardian, who told the teacher, ``If they're left
alone they have to know how to protect themselves.''
   Harris said the typical gun casualty is ``a 10- to 12-year-old
male playing with a gun with a friend at one of their houses.''
   When the county decided to address the issue of gun safety,
school board members wanted to investigate existing programs. They
checked with other school systems and learned there were none.
   The National Rifle Association offered its program, which
features a coloring book and a poster. The poster instructs children
not to touch a gun if they find one. Instead, it tells them to leave
the area and tell an adult.
   But the art work shows a gun lying on a table. ``Some of the
senior staff believed the message was subliminal,'' telling children
it's OK to have guns left out, Harris said.
   The gun lobby is concerned that the Dade County program teaches
children to fear guns.
   ``Some of it may instill fear among children,'' Harris said. ``We
don't have any problem with that.
   ``We want to teach them to have respect for guns _ so much that
they don't touch them.''

<HEAD>As Spring Arrives, Snow Still Widespread Across Parts of Rockies,
Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Spring began today as snow fell in the Rockies and heavy rain was
widespread across the Midwest.
   The official start of Spring was this morning at 10:28 a.m. EST,
and it meant springlike storms for parts of southern and western
Texas as moist air surged north from the Gulf of Mexico and strong
thunderstorms developed in the unstable air mass.
   Showers and thunderstorms also broke out northeast of a low
centered over the Texas Panhandle, stretching from Kansas across
central Missouri into southern Illinois.
   Elsewhere, winter held on. The Texas Panhandle low sent snow
across the central and southern Rockies. Snow was expected to
accumulate up to 8 inches today along the front range of the Rockies
in Colorado.
   Snow also was falling from eastern Iowa across much of Wisconsin
into upper Michigan. A mixture of snow and rain fell in northern
Illinois.
   Winter storm watches were posted for tonight for the south
central mountains and central highlands of New Mexico and portions
of northwest Texas.
   A cold front dipped into the central Rockies and the central
Plains this morning and continued to head south toward the southern
Plains.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
southern Plains across the middle Mississippi and Ohio valleys to
Pennsylvania and across to the Gulf Coast and South Carolina;
widespread rain in the Ohio Valley; and snow in northern New
England, the Great Lakes region, the central High Plains and
southern Rockies.
   Highs will be in the teens to 20s in the northern Plains and
northern Great Lakes region; 30s and 40s across the northern and
central Rockies, central Plains and the southern Great Lakes region
to the north Atlantic Coast states; 70s and 80s in interior and
southern sections of California, the desert Southwest, southern New
Mexico, a large part of Texas and the Gulf Coast to Florida; and 50s
to 60s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 8
degrees below zero at Houlton, Maine, to 74 at St. Petersburg, Fla.

   West German authorities showed British
experts a bomb disguised as a radio-cassette player five weeks
before a similar device blew up Pan Am Flight 103 and killed 270
people, an official said today.
   The statement by Interior Ministry spokesman Roland Bachmeier
came amid criticism that British authorities knew such a bombing was
possible but failed to warn airlines prior to the Dec. 21 disaster.
   British authorities acknowledged Sunday that a warning about such
a disguised bomb was not mailed to airlines until after the tragedy.
   Also today, West German authorities denied a report by London's
Sunday Express that said a Libyan terrorism mastermind known as
``The Professor'' was believed to have plotted the tragedy.
   Bachmeier said British authorities attended a briefing by the
West German Federal Crime Bureau on Nov. 15 at which an explosive
device hidden in a radio-cassette player was demonstrated.
   The radio-cassette player contained a plastic explosive and a
timing device that authorities have said are the same as those used
in the bomb that destroyed the Boeing 747 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   The bomb shown to British authorities had been seized by West
German police during an Oct. 26 raid on a hideout of the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command in the city of
Neuss.
   ``They were in possession of all the information,'' Bachmeier
said, adding that the British security experts took photographs and
made detailed notes on the disguised bomb.
   Both Bachmeier and Alexander Prechtel, a spokesman for the West
German Federal Prosecutor's Office, denied that authorities had
identified the perpetrator.
   The Sunday Express, quoting unidentified West German detectives,
said authorities believe the bombing was plotted by a Libyan
nicknamed ``The Professor'' by international security agencies.
   The weekly said Lebanese student Khalid Jaafar, 20, of Dearborn,
Mich., probably unwittingly carried the bomb on board hidden in a
radio-cassette player which the Libyan had given him. He was killed
in the crash.
   Earlier news reports in the United States and London have quoted
unidentified sources as saying Jaafar may have carried the bomb when
he boarded Flight 103 in Frankfurt, West Germany. The FBI has
questioned his father, Nazir, who has denied those reports.
   The flight originated in Frankfurt, then changed planes in London
for a flight to New York.
   The Sunday Express said the Libyan _ whom it did not name _ flew
to Bonn from Greece on Dec. 13 and met an Iranian diplomat who let
him work from the Iranian Embassy.
   It said he stayed in Germany at least until Jan. 6. He was seen
three weeks ago driving a car with German license plates in Lisbon,
Portugal, the report said.
   The report said ``The Professor'' trained as a member of an elite
squad in the Libyan army in the 1960s and called him a master of
electronics, explosives and forgery.
   The Sunday Express said the Libyan trained recruits for a
Libya-backed group headed by Abu Nidal, who has been blamed for
attacks on the Rome and Vienna airports in 1985 and other terrorist
incidents.
   The paper said the FBI has confirmed the man was being hunted in
connection with the bombing.
   In Washington, FBI spokesman Steve Gladis on Sunday declined to
comment on the report.
   Meanwhile, British Transport Secretary Paul Channon was under
pressure to explain or resign over his department's handling of
warnings received before the bombing.
   ``Unless he comes to the House of Commons at the earliest
opportunity next week and is competely candid in every detail, the
demand for an official inquiry on both sides of the Atlantic will
become irresistible,'' said Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Social and
Liberal Democratic Party.
   Channon said Sunday he told Parliament ``as much as it is in my
power to tell.'' Government ministers ``should not go around
revealing things that might be against the national interest,'' he
told the British Broadcasting Corp.
   The Transport Department confirmed last week it prepared a
warning dated Dec. 19 that included photographs of a bomb hidden in
a radio-cassette player but did not mail it until after Christmas.
   A department spokesman said the warning was not sent until the
New Year because the accompanying photos had to be prepared. The
spokesman, who demanded anonymity, did not give the exact date of
the mailing.
   Pan Am has said it received the letter Jan. 17.

<TEXT>
   A small circulation Soviet magazine has printed an
essay Alexander Solzhenitsyn wrote shortly before he was forced into
exile in which he appeals to his countrymen to cast off
officially-sanctioned lies.
   The magazine also carried a commentary crediting the Nobel
laureate for helping prepare the way for President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reforms.
   The publication represents another step in the gradual
rehabilitation of an author whose major works remain banned in his
homeland.
   However, the magazine did not publish Solzhenitsyn's most
trenchent criticisms of Soviet politics, including his charge that
repression has been a key element of Kremlin policy since the days
of Vladimir I. Lenin.
   Moreover, the essay was printed in a magazine destined in part
for foreign markets, selling 50,000 copies abroad in Russian,
English, French, Spanish and German, and with only a 100,000-copy
circulation at home.
   The 2{-page essay ``Live Not by Lies!'' was published in the
February bulletin of the officially sanctioned Soviet Peace
Committee's monthly, Twentieth Century and Peace.
   It was written shortly before Solzhenitsyn was arrested and
expelled from the Soviet Union for his writings.
   In the essay, which was circulated at the time in thousands of
illegal self-published copies, Solzhenitsyn called on his countrymen
to display courage and resist pressure from the country's rulers.
   An honest man, wrote Solzhenitsyn, ``does not raise his hand to
vote for a proposal that he does not sincerely sympathize with, does
not vote either openly or in secret for a person he believes is
unworthy or doubtful.''
   That sort of language, considered anti-Soviet and seditious under
President Leonid I. Brezhnev's rule in the 1970s, is now fully in
line with Gorbachev's calls for greater openness, civic
responsibility and democracy.
   Author Igor Vinogradov, in the commentary appended to
Solzhenitsyn's essay, called the arrest and banishment of the 1970
Nobel Prize winner ``a shameful act'' and lauded the writer's ``high
spiritual and civic courage.''
   Without such brave people who spoke out against abuses of the
Soviet rulers of their time, Gorbachev's drive for ``perestroika,''
social and economic reforms, may never have come about, Vinogradov
said.
   ``Those changes which started in our country three years ago _
could they be possible if in our society, in all its strata,
contempt and loathing had not ripened among nearly everyone for
those who personified the ruling evil and violence, and for their
miserable servants, flooding the country with lies and
demagoguery?'' he wrote.
   In an interview published today by The New York Times,
Solzhenitsyn's wife, Natalia, who often speaks for him, said she was
disappointed that the essay was published in such a
small-circulation journal because the piece was written as a broad,
national appeal.
   ``Given that this was meant as an address to the people, this is
not the place it should be published,'' Mrs. Solzhenitsyn was quoted
as saying in a telephone interview from her home in Cavendish, Vt.
   Vadim A. Medvedev, the Communist Party's ideology chief, said
late last year he favored a continued ban on publishing works by
Solzhenitsyn because they would undermine Soviet society.
   ``I am against the publication of a number of works by
Solzhenitsyn and in the first place such works as `Lenin in Zurich'
and `The Gulag Archipelago,'' the Politburo member told a Nov. 29
news conference.
   ``To publish Solzhenitsyn's works would mean to, in effect,
undermine the foundations on which today's life rests,'' Medvedev
said.
   His remarks indicated there are still limits on the amount of
openness allowed under Gorbachev's reforms.
   Solzhenitsyn's ``One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,'' a
chronicle of life in Soviet labor camps under dictator Josef V.
Stalin, was published in 1962 during the thaw allowed by Nikita S.
Khrushchev following Stalin's death.
   Some Soviet writers, artists and activists have clamored for the
publication of Solzhenitsyn's works and his return to the Soviet
Union. In October, the filmmakers' union asked for a review of his
1974 expulsion.

   The farm chemical Alar has for four years been
a symbol of industrial arrogance and regulatory foot-dragging to
followers of the consumer movement.
   But despite activists' efforts, it's a safe bet most Americans
knew little or nothing about Alar, which is used to grow crisper,
more colorful apples, and which has been linked to cancer in animal
tests.
   That's changed dramatically in the last two weeks.
   The Alar-apple debate quickly gained public-policy star status
through a ``60 Minutes'' television report, the involvement of
actress Meryl Streep and surprise moves by educators in New York and
Los Angeles to yank apples from school lunchrooms.
   Despite reassurances from the government and health establishment
that Alar isn't all that unsafe, signs of alarm have mounted:
   _By the end of last week, the heads of the Environmental
Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration both felt
compelled to defend the nation's apple supply. They were joined by
Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, who released a statement Saturday
saying: ``I wish to send a message to mothers across the country:
It's OK, Mom, apples are good for your kids!'''
   _Apple growers in Washington state blamed the controversy for a
drop of nearly 10 percent in shipments of apples out of state in two
weeks.
   _Grocers and apple processing companies across the country
reiterated policies against accepting apples sprayed with Alar.
Meanwhile, the manufacturer of the chemical, Uniroyal Chemical Co.
of Middlebury, Conn., has repeatedly cited research showing Alar in
the concentrations found in apples doesn't pose a cancer threat.
   The Alar debate has been around with varying degrees of fervor
since August 1985, when the EPA considered but rejected a ban on the
chemical, used to control ripening and improve quality, consistency
and shelf life of apples.
   In early February, the EPA finally did propose a phaseout of use
of the chemical, which would take it off the market starting
probably next year. But the EPA said the threat of Alar was not so
severe that the ban had to start right away.
   Consumer groups, including Ralph Nader's Public Citizens Health
Research Group and the National Resources Defense Council, have
campaigned for an immediate ban instead.
   The periodic consumer campaigns have prompted many big
supermarket chains and apple processors across the country to quit
accepting Alar-treated apples. As a result, use of the chemical fell
to an estimated 5 percent to 10 percent of the crop from a high
around 50 percent. Many growers hoped controversy was behind them.
   But on Feb. 26, the dormant controversy erupted anew.
   The CBS television show ``60 Minutes'' reported a study by the
Natural Resources group suggesting children, because of low body
weight and proportionately high consumption of apples, had a
heightened risk of cancer from Alar.
   Then Miss Streep appeared on TV talk shows and gave interviews
about her fears for her three children's health.
   The resulting blast of publicity prompted officials in the
nation's two biggest school districts, New York and Los Angeles, to
temporarily pull apples and apple products from their cafeterias.
Reports of the apple bans quickly spread.
   ``In our democratic process, an angry mob will be listened to no
matter what the facts are,'' said Mark Helmke, a Washington, D.C.,
consultant with the Robinson, Lake, Lerer and Montgomery public
relations firm.
   ``That's what's happened in this case _ this story has struck a
nerve,'' Helmke said.
   Studies show Alar, a trade name for the chemical daminozide,
could be linked to cancer in laboratory animals. A breakdown product
of Alar called UDMH also was shown to cause cancer when give to test
animals in large amounts.
   The American Academy of Pediatrics adopted a position paper March
11 calling for an end to Alar use but said parents shouldn't worry
about farm chemicals applied in legal amounts.

   Premier Li Peng opened the annual session of
China's legislature today by calling on Chinese to work harder and
make more financial sacrifices to collectively overcome worsening
economic woes.
   ``Both government and people should be mentally prepared for a
few years of austerity,'' Li told more than 2,000 delegates at the
Great Hall of the People in central Beijing.
   He urged officials to give up their ``vested interests in favor
of the interests of the whole.
   ``If we set a good example and explain clearly to the people the
need for tightening our belts, they will surely understand and
support it,'' he said.
   The only exceptions Li made to the tight-money policy were
agriculture and education. Li said the education budget would be
increased and more loans would be made to farmers.
   Sitting behind Li on the rostrum were other government and
Communist Party leaders. Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, 84, was
absent, but there was no official explanation. Deng attended last
year's opening session.
   The chair normally filled by Deng, next to Communist Party chief
Zhao Ziyang, was filled by President Yang Shangkun. Next to Yang sat
Li and next to him sat Vice Premier Wang Zheng. Two chairs were
empty.
   The tone of Li's speech contrasted with last year's, when he
called for bold new efforts to move the economy away from rigid
central planning that long stifled growth. Since then, however,
inflation has climbed to a post-war record annual rate of 36
percent, and overheated demand has caused shortages, hoarding and
several bank runs.
   Li blamed the economic problems on ``a tendency to be too
impatient for quick results.
   ``More often than not we tended to ignore the fact that China has
a huge population, is relatively short of resources and has an
unevenly developed economy,'' Li said in a criticism of policies
that he helped shape.
   ``We ... did not pay sufficient attention to taking comprehensive
and coordinated measures and failed to tighten control and
supervision at the right moment,'' he said. ``We were too
optimistic.''
   Li was interrupted by applause when he reaffirmed China's claim
to sovereignty over Tibet and denounced foreign support of Tibetan
separatism as ``outrageous interference in China's internal
affairs.''
   He also reiterated China's position that it was justified in
imposing martial law in Tibet on March 8 after three days of
anti-Chinese violence in which at least 12 people died. Tibetan
activists claim the region was independent before the Communist
takeover in 1950.
   Li did not mention letters sent to the congress by more than 100
intellectuals appealing for an amnesty for political prisoners, or
the growing public clamor for greater freedom of speech.
   Most of Li's speech was devoted to economic problems and
austerity measures, including strengthening control over price
increases, loans and new construction.
   However, he said the state would increase its grain purchase
price by 18 percent beginning April 1 in an effort to end a
four-year slump in production. Banks will increase agricultural
loans, he said.
   ``Agriculture stands out as the weakest link in the national
economy at present,'' he said.
   Li also announced a 15 percent increase in the education budget,
to $10 billion.
   ``This figure is the best the government can do under the present
tight budget, although it still falls far short of actual needs,''
he said. He said alternate sources of funding would have to be found.
   The congress meets through April 4 to hear more government
reports and discuss proposed laws.
   Congress delegates are elected by provincial congresses, which in
turn are chosen by municipal and county congresses in each area.
Citizens actually vote only for representatives in the lowest-level
local congress.

   Israeli warplanes today bombed Palestinian
guerrilla bases in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley, and police
said six people died and nine were wounded.
   It was the fourth Israeli air raid in Lebanon this year.
   The positions attacked today belong to the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command, a pro-Syrian faction of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, the Israeli army said.
   Police in Beirut said six Israeli planes took part in the attack
on Bar Elias, about six miles west of the Syrian-Lebanese border.
   The Israelis said all their planes returned safely to base.
   The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command
has claimed responsibility for several recent infiltration attempts
into Israel, including a Feb. 12 attack in which two of its members
were killed in Israel's self-proclaimed security zone in south
Lebanon.
   On Feb. 28, Israeli warplanes attacked the headquarters of the
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine in the village of
Ainab, 10 miles south of Beirut. Two members of the guerrilla group
were killed and 33 people were injured in that attack, including 26
children.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican political activists and business
people from across the country contributed $105,000 to an unusual
limited partnership that then paid to promote a book co-authored by
Rep. Newt Gingrich, according to a published report today.
   Gingrich, R-Ga., has been a chief accuser of House Speaker Jim
Wright in an ethics investigation focusing on issues including a
book deal for the speaker. Gingrich also is a candidate in this
week's Republican race to become House minority whip.
   The Washington Post reported today that Gingrich and his
co-authors of a 1984 book set up the limited partnership that raised
money for a promotion budget.
   The Post said Gingrich asked the newspaper if he could delay his
responses to its queries because a story that described his book
deal as ``equally as weird as Jim Wright's'' would be to his
``disadvantage'' before the vote for minority whip, the No. 2
Republican leadership post in the House.
   Wright has been accused of using a congressional aide to edit his
book and of using bulk sales of the volume to interest groups as a
way to make money while skirting limits on outside income.
   Gingrich had acknowledged last summer, even as he raised
questions about Wright's ethics, that he once had a congressional
aide work on ``Window of Opportunity,'' which he co-authored with
his wife, Marianne, and David Drake. But Gingrich said his aide did
much less work than Wright's staffer did on the respective volumes.
   House Democrats last year also attacked Gingrich for a 1977 deal
in which he allegedly was paid $13,000 for a book he never produced.
   Questioned on Friday about the limited partnership, Gingrich told
the Post that it was set up with the idea that a large promotion
budget could ``force a best-seller. I was real naive.'' Publishers
normally pay promotion costs.
   The 21 investors each put up $5,000 and were to split half of the
publisher's profits. However, the publisher lost money and the
investors thus were able to take a tax writeoff, the paper said.
   Mrs. Gingrich told the paper she had a share of the partnership
and was paid almost $10,000 by it for her work as general partner.
   The congressman said the partnership was his idea. It spent
$70,000 for promotion, while most of the rest of the money went for
expenses, including the payment to Mrs. Gingrich.
   The book sold about 12,000 hardcover copies and another 17,000 in
paperback.
   Gingrich is running against Rep. Edward R. Madigan, R-Ill., for
the minority whip post vacated by former Rep. Dick Cheney, R-Wyo.,
who was sworn in Friday as secretary of defense.

   Four black activists escaped
from South African custody today and requested refuge at the West
German Embassy in Pretoria, an embassy official said.
   Embassy Counselor Klaus Bonnemann said the men, all detainees who
had been on hunger strikes, arrived at the embassy this afternoon
and said they belong to the banned United Democratic Front, the
country's largest anti-apartheid coalition.
   The men said they escaped from Hillbrow Hospital in Johannesburg,
where they were being treated for fasting to protest their detention
without trial, Bonnemann said. Hundreds of detainees have taken part
in hunger strikes since January, demanding they be released or put
on trial.
   Bonnemann declined to say exactly what the men want from the West
German Embassy and added no decision had been made concerning them.
   South African police confirmed four detainees escaped from
Hillbrow Hospital today, but declined to give any additional details.
   In Bonn, the West German Foreign Ministry said the four men were
in ``administrative custody.'' Spokesman Hans Schumacher indicated
he did not know precisely what the men were seeking.
   The West German Embassy did not release the names of the men, but
human rights lawyer Azhar Cachalia identified them as Job Sithole,
Ephraim Nkoe, Mpho Legoro and Clive Radebe.
   Cachalia declined to say how the men left the hospital and
traveled to the West German Embassy. Pretoria is about 40 miles from
Johannesburg.
   Journalists were not allowed inside the embassy this afternoon,
but from the street, the four black men could be seen standing in
the foyer of the building, clad in T-shirts and jeans.
   People have escaped from South African custody and taken refuge
in foreign diplomatic missions several times in recent years.
   Most recently, three detainees escaped from a hospital in
September and holed up in the U.S. Consulate in Johannesburg for
more than 40 days before deciding to leave.
   The South African government promised that the three men, all
United Democratic Front members, would not be detained or restricted
once they left the consulate. The three have regularly spoken on
behalf of the front in recent months.
   In another incident, Klaas de Jonge, a Dutch citizen accused of
smuggling weapons for the African National Congress guerrilla
movement, took refuge in the Dutch Consulate in Pretoria for more
than two years before he was returned to the Netherlands in
September 1987 in an exchange involving in four countries.

   Journalists were harassed by
gunfire from an army helicopter as they rushed a fatally wounded
Dutch television cameraman to the hospital after a firefight, the
reporters said.
   It seemed as if soldiers in the helicopter were ``playing a
game'' by firing ahead of and behind the journalists' car, said
producer Peter Elenbaas, who was among those trying to save his
co-worker, Cornel Lagrouw.
   The military said it regretted the deaths of Lagrouw and of two
Salvadoran journalists killed in separate incidents while covering
the presidential vote. It said a soldier was arrested in one of the
slayings.
   The deaths brought to 15 the number of foreign and Salvadoran
journalists killed covering the nine-year civil war.
   Lagrouw, 30, of the Dutch television church network IKON, was
shot Sunday during a clash between army troops and leftist
guerrillas in San Francisco Javier, a town about 70 miles east of
San Salvador.
   He was standing next to guerrillas when he was struck in the
chest by a bullet fired from an army position as troops moved in to
take back the town, said journalists who were with him.
   ``He was pale but still alive,'' said photographer Bill Gentile
of Newsweek who, with Arturo Robles of JB Photos and free-lance
newsman Scott Wallace, pulled Lagrouw out of the area and into a car
to rush him to a hospital.
   ``I was cradling him. He was dying in my arms,'' Gentile said.
``We're not sure when Cornel died _ on the ground or in the car.''
   Two cars rushing Lagrouw to the hospital in Usulutan came under
repeated fire from a helicopter, Gentile and Robles said.
   Elenbaas told a news conference: ``The moment we were out of the
village, the helicopter started pursuing us. It's probable they were
playing a game with us. If they had wanted to hit the car, they
probably could have hit it.''
   Robles, who was in a jeep ahead of the car carrying Lagrouw,
said, ``We had signs, and we had four white flags.''
   Under established protocol generally respected by both army and
guerrillas, reporters and photographers in El Salvador travel in
vehicles marked ``Press'' or ``TV'' with white flags affixed to car
doors.
   Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek today called Lagrouw's
death an ``extremely regrettable incident.'' However, he told
reporters in Belgium that it was an apparent accident and his
government was not considering diplomatic steps against El Salvador.
   The dead Salvadoran journalists were identified as Roberto Navas,
30, a photographer who worked for the Reuters news agency; and
Mauricio Pineda, 26, of Channel 12 television in El Salvador.
   Luis Galdamez, another Reuters photographer, was with Navas on a
motorcycle when the two were fired on by soldiers at a checkpoint
Saturday night on the outskirts of San Salvador.
   Galdamez, who was wounded, told doctors at the Rosales Hospital
before emergency surgery that he and Navas were shot without warning.
   Pineda was with a mobile TV unit traveling to the coastal city of
La Union, 115 miles from the capital, when a soldier shot at the
pickup truck, according to station spokesman William Figueroa.
   The van was identified as a television vehicle and carried a
white flag, Figueroa said. It passed through a checkpoint early
Sunday to get to a regional airport and deliver film.
   On the way back, as it passed the checkpoint in daylight, a
soldier fired three shots from behind the vehicle, killing Pineda.
   Responding to the three killings, the Salvadoran Correspondents'
Association said in a statement: ``In these three incidents, we note
with alarm a tendency on the part of the armed forces that appears
aimed at intimidating and frightening the press corps in order to
make their work more difficult.''
   Col. Emilio Ponce, head of the joint chiefs of staff, said the
armed forces ``genuinely laments'' the deaths and promised to
investigate the slayings and said the corporal who shot Pineda was
under arrest.
   ``Though they happened in a brief lapse, this kind of incident is
isolated. It does not represent any policy or desire on the part of
the armed forces to intimidate journalists or keep them from doing
their job,'' Ponce said.
   Defense Minister Gen. Eugenio Vides Casanova said Navas and
Galdamez did not heed orders to stop at checkpoints. He offered
``condolences and most sincere apologies to their families.''
   Four Dutch TV journalists were killed on March 17, 1982, in the
northern province of Chalatenango. The government said they were
slain during a gunbattle between rebels and army troops, but the
Dutch government said it had evidence security forces were
responsible.

<HEAD>Ten People Convicted for Philadelphia Abortion Demonstration Lose
Appeal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ten people criminally convicted for their
participation in a 1985 protest demonstration at a Philadelphia
abortion clinic lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments that the
defendants wrongly were barred from asserting medical justification
as a defense for their crimes.
   The appeal also urged that the Philadelphia case be used to
reverse the high court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion.
   The justices already have under study an abortion-regulation
dispute from Missouri in which they are being asked to reverse or
limit the 16-year-old ruling in a case called Roe vs. Wade.
   In the Philadelphia case, the 10 were convicted of ``defiant
trespass'' and acquitted of all other charges stemming from an Aug.
10, 1985, anti-abortion demonstration at the Northeast Women's
Center.
   A state appeals court said the 10 ``pushed their way'' into the
clinic and occupied several rooms. ``Once inside, they damaged two
aspirator machines and other medical instruments, threw equipment
out of a third-floor window and placed `pro-life' stickers on the
doors, walls and ceilings,'' the state court said.
   After refusing to leave, the 10 protesters were carried away by
police officers.
   Each drew a sentence of one day to three months in jail.
   A state appeals court upheld the convictions and sentences last
May 2, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court refused to hear their
appeal last Oct. 20.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the 10 protesters said
their clients are among ``thousands of law-abiding citizens ... now
engaging in heightened demonstrations or `rescues' at abortion
clinics throughout the United States.''
   The appeal said that each of the protesters ``knew that his or
her conduct would otherwise be criminal except for the defense of
justification sought to be interposed in this case.''
   The appeal was filed in behalf of Roland Markum, John O'Brien,
Howard Walton, Susan Silcox, Kathy Long, Ellen Jones, Anne Marie
Breen, Henry Tenagolio, Joseph Wall and Walter Gies.
   The case is Markum vs. Pennsylvania, 88-1218.

<TEXT>
   A Florida-based company wanting to require all
its employees to attend weekly Christian devotional services lost a
Supreme Court appeal today.
   The justices, without comment, left intact rulings that the
requirement violated the rights of an atheist who worked at the
company's plant in Eloy, Ariz.
   Lawyers for the company argued that its owners' constitutionally
protected religious freedoms were violated.
   ``Unless ... employers (may) operate their businesses in
accordance with their sincerely held religious beliefs, the private
workplace will increasingly become void of religion,'' the appeal
contended.
   J.O. (Jake) and Helen Townley control and manage the Townley
Manufacturing Co., based in Candler, Fla.
   The couple are born-again Christians who said they promised God
their mining-equipment manufacturing company ``would be a Christian,
faith-operated business.''
   The company, founded in Florida in 1963, since has opened other
plants, including one in Eloy, Ariz.
   Employees at Townley plants for years were required to attend
weekly devotional services.
   Louis Pelvas, identified in court documents as an atheist, began
working as a machinist at the Townley plant in Eloy in 1979.
Mandatory attendance at devotional services was not required there
until 1984.
   Pelvas attended several and then asked to be excused because he
was an atheist. His supervisor told Pelvas that he had to attend but
that he could sleep, read a newspaper or otherwise engage himself
durng the services.
   Pelvas continued to attend the services, which usually lasted 30
to 45 minutes during the work day, but in October 1984 he filed a
religious-discrimination complaint with the federal Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission. Pelvas left the company two months later,
saying he was offered a transfer that amounted to a firing.
   The commission in 1986 ruled that Townley violated a part of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 barring on-the-job religious discrimination.
   A federal trial judge in Arizona barred Townley in May 1987 from
continuing mandatory devotional services at the Eloy plant.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the judge's
injunction last Oct. 20.
   The appeals court noted that the federal law imposes a duty on
employers to accommodate an employee's religious practices unless
doing so would cause undue hardship.
   The appeals court said Townley had failed to prove any undue
hardship in Pelvas' case, and rejected the company's argument that
it is a ``religious corporation'' Congress intended to exempt from
the law.
   ``The EEOC does not seek to enjoin the services altogether;
rather it only objects to their mandatory nature,'' the appeals
court said.
   The Bush administration urged the court to rule against Townley
and its owners.
   ``Any minor burden on the Townleys' religious practices is
justified in this case,'' government lawyers said.
   The case is Townley Manufacturing Co. vs. EEOC, 88-988.

<HEAD>Court Overrules Botha's Decision To Halt Murder Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today overruled South
African President P.W. Botha's order to halt the murder trial of six
soldiers charged in the stabbing death of a black activist.
   It marks the second time in four months that Namibia's highest
court has overturned a decision by Botha to grant immunity to
soldiers accused of murder in Namibia, also known as South-West
Africa.
   A three-judge panel said the soldiers of Namibia's South
African-led army will have to stand trial for the Nov. 30, 1986,
killing of Immanuel Shifidi.
   Those accused are four white officers _ two colonels, a
commandant and a lieutenant _ and two black enlisted men, a corporal
and a private.
   Shifidi, 56, was stabbed fatally at a rally outside Windhoek
staged by the legal political wing of the South-West African
People's Organization.
   Shifidi was a founding member of the organization, which has
fought a 23-year bush war for independence from South African
administration. The organization's military wing is outlawed.
   Namibia's attorney general has said the soldiers arranged for 54
black soldiers to dress in civilian clothes and disrupt the rally in
Katutura, a black township outside Windhoek, the capital.
   The six pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and public
violence. But before the trial could begin, Botha last March invoked
a section of South Africa's Defense Act that empowers him to grant
immunity to any soldier for any action committed ``in good faith ...
in connection with the prevention or suppression of terrorism in any
operational area.''
   Harmut Ruppel, a lawyer representing the Shifidi family, has said
there is no evidence Shifidi was a pre-selected target for
assassination. He said it appears the soldiers sought to discredit
the guerrilla organization and intimidate its supporters by
provoking violence at its rally.
   The Supreme Court ruled Botha's order was invalid, but did not
disclose its reasons.
   On Dec. 15, it ruled against Botha in a similar case, arguing the
president did not present important evidence. Botha had granted
immunity to four soldiers accused of beating to death a black man in
northern Namibia.
   South Africa has agreed to begin implementing independence in
Namibia on April 1, leading to elections in November.
   In other developments:
   _South African and Namibian officials set up checkpoints Monday
to monitor cross-border movements. Previously, no identity documents
were required when traveling between South Africa and Namibia.
   _Namibia's South African-led army Sunday demobilized a battalion
made up mostly of troops from the Bushman tribe known for its
extraordinary tracking skills. The Bushmen, part of 201 Battalion,
were used to track guerrillas in the rugged bush of northern
Namibia, where most of the fighting took place.

<HEAD>Oregon Case to be Used to Test Enforcement of Environmental Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide a
narrow, but potentially significant, point of environmental law that
may affect the effectiveness of enforcement by private citizens.
   The justices said they will consider reinstating a lawsuit
against a Tillamook County, Ore., landfill by the couple who own an
adjacent dairy farm.
   A federal appeals court threw out the 1982 suit because the farm
couple failed to notify everyone they were required to under the
environmental law they used to sue the county.
   Olaf and Mary Hallstrom live on a dairy farm near the landfill.
   Their 1982 suit alleged that contaminated liquid called leachate
discharged from the landfill caused or contributed to bacterial and
chemical pollution of the surface and ground water on their farm.
   They contended that the county was violating the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, one of at least a dozen federal
environmental laws that gives private citizens the right to sue for
enforcement.
   The Hallstroms notified the county of their intent to sue well
before the 60-day period required by the federal law. But they did
not, as required by the law, give the same notification to the
federal Environmental Protection Agency or the Oregon Department of
Environmental Quality.
   A federal trial judge treated the failure to comply with the
notification requirements as a procedural flaw remedied by merely
delaying the suit for 60 days.
   The judge ruled in 1985 that the county had violated the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, and ordered the county to remedy the
violation within two years.
   The judge refused to award the Hallstroms $95,000 in attorney
fees and legal costs. The couple appealed, and the county filed a
cross-appeal.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 1987 that the
Hallstroms' lawsuit should have been dismissed because of their
failure to notify the EPA and the state agency.
   The appeals court said the failure represented a jurisdictional
flaw, not a procedural one. Other federal appeals courts have
reached the opposite conclusion.
   The Bush administration urged the justices to use the Hallstroms'
appeal to resolve the conflicting appellate court rulings.
   ``The different approaches ... can cause significantly different
results,'' government lawyers said.
   They noted that the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act allows
private enforcement lawsuits only if a defendant is allegedly
violating the law at that time.
   ``If a plaintiff's action is dismissed for lack of proper notice,
and the defendant promptly comes into compliance with the RCRA, the
plaintiff may not file his action again,'' the government lawyers
said. ``By contrast, if the plaintiff's case were stayed ... the
same defendant would remain liable for civil penalties and possibly
attorneys' fees.''
   The government said the 9th Circuit court ruling was correct.
   The case is Hallstrom vs. Tillamook County, 88-42.

   The Supreme Court today turned away a
still-pending, big-money antitrust dispute over the sale of raw milk.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court
ruling that could cost millions for two cooperative associations of
dairy farmers and a marketing agent for dairy cooperatives.
   The case is nearly 18 years old, dating back to a 1971 lawsuit
filed by one of the dairy cooperatives who ended up an unsuccessful
defendant in a counter-suit.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1982 ruled against
Mid-America Dairymen of Springfield, Mo., Associated Milk Producers
Inc. of San Antonio, Texas, and the Central Milk Producers
Cooperative, based in Chicago.
   The appeals court said they had engaged in a broad, illegal
conspiracy to eliminate competitive sellers of Grade A raw milk in
the Midwest. The appeals court ruled that the conspiracy hurt the
National Farmers Organization Inc., a nationwide farm bargaining
organization.
   The 8th Circuit court's 1982 ruling instructed U.S. District
Judge John W. Oliver in Kansas City, Mo., to determine what monetary
damages NFO should collect.
   In ensuing proceedings before Judge Oliver, NFO advanced
alternative damage measurement theories. It claimed tripled damages
of $55.4 million under one theory, and tripled damages of $22.2
million under the other.
   The trial judge refused to award any damages.
   Ruling in the case a second time last July 6, the 8th Circuit
court reaffirmed its holding that NFO ``incurred substantial
damages'' as a result of illegal acts.
   The appeals court again sent the case back to Oliver, with ``more
specific directions ... with respect to the computation of damages.''
   The appeals court also said the trial judge should ``determine
and award appropriate attorneys fees and costs'' to NFO.
   It said Oliver was right in rejecting the theory under which NFO
said it was entitled to $55.4 million. But it said the theory under
which NFO claimed $22.2 million in damages ``is a proper basis for a
substantial damage award.''
   The cases are Central Milk Producers Cooperative vs. National
Farmers Organization, 88-1247, and Associated Milk Producers vs.
National Farmers Organization, 88-1248.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today again refused to let
states and state agencies be sued for allegedly violating federal
copyright laws.
   The justices, without comment, refused to revive allegations that
UCLA, a California state-run university, illegally copied a
company's computer programs and instruction manuals.
   The justices on Feb. 21 turned away a similar appeal by a
photographer who accused a state university in Virginia of
unauthorized use of his photographs.
   In the case acted on today, BV Engineering's appeal was supported
by numerous members of the artistic, entertainment and literary
community.
   Nine major motion picture studios urged the court to hear BV
Engineering's appeal to broaden protection against what they said is
widespread copyright infringement.
   The movie producers said, for example, that prisons in Kansas,
West Virginia, Idaho, Utah, Delaware, North Carolina and Rhode
Island are refusing to pay for films shown to inmates.
   BV Engineering sued UCLA in 1986, accusing the university of
illegally copying seven computer programs and the accompanying user
manuals.
   The suit was thrown out by a federal judge, and the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last October that states and state
agencies are immune from copyright-infringement suits.
   The appeals court said states are protected by the Constitution's
11th Amendment, which shields them from a variety of lawsuits.
   The appeals court, citing previous Supreme Court rulings, said
the federal Copyright Act of 1976 does not explicitly remove _ or
abrogate _ the 11th Amendment protection.
   ``We are constrained by the Supreme Court's mandate that we find
an abrogation of 11th Amendment immunity only when Congress has
included in the statute unequivocal and specific language indicating
an intent to subject states to suit in federal court,'' the 9th
Circuit court said.
   ``We recognize that our holding will allow states to violate the
federal copyright laws with virtual impunity,'' the appeals court
continued. ``It is for Congress, however, to remedy this problem.''
   BV Engineering said it was left without a remedy since federal
copyright law bars the company from suing UCLA in state court in
California.
   The case is BV Engineering vs. UCLA, 88-1099.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An IRS employee who, under a cloak of
anonymity, accused the agency of not telling people who neglect to
subtract withholding when figuring their taxes went public on
network television today and was promised protection by Sen. Albert
Gore Jr.
   ``If they try any kind of reprisal, they better watch out'' Gore,
D-Tenn., said of Internal Revenue Service officials.
   The IRS employee, Linda Johnson, a return examiner in the
agency's service center in Memphis, appeared with Gore on NBC's
``Today'' show. She had planned to appear in silhouette and with her
voice disguised, but dropped those precautions because ``I found out
that it's probabaly known out there ... who has actually reported
it,'' she said.
   Ms. Johnson originally told her story during a private meeting
with Gore. She repeated it in an interview with The Associated Press
last week, but insisted that she not be identifed at the time
because of fear of retaliation.
   She is involved in the IRS's program to detect taxpayers who fail
to report some or all their taxable income.
   About 15 months after tax returns are filed, computers match
returns with Form 1099s, W-2s and other source-of-income reports and
if some income does not show up on a return, examiners such as Ms.
Johnson decide whether the taxpayer should be sent a letter
demanding an explanation.
   In 1987, while checking 1985 returns, Ms. Johnson said, she and
colleagues found numerous returns on which filers had failed to
subtract withheld taxes from taxes owed. That meant the taxpayers
were overpaying.
   When she went to supervisors, she said, they told her IRS policy
required taxpayers to find their own mistakes. After protests, she
added, her superiors checked with IRS headquarters in Washington and
were told to abide by the policy.
   ``It was stealing from the taxpayers,'' Ms. Johnson said.
   She said the disputed policy was changed last year to allow IRS
employees to notify taxpayers when they fail to subtract taxes that
have been withheld from wages or periodic pension payments. But the
old policy still stands for taxpayers who neglect to subtract taxes
withheld from lump-sum pension payments.
   The IRS has steadfastly refused to comment directly on Ms.
Johnson's assertions, saying it is reviewing its employee manual and
policies.
   However, in an appearance before the House Ways and Means
oversight subcommittee last week, acting IRS Commissioner Michael
Murphy said ``it is possible that taxpayers did not get the refund
they were entitled to.''
   Even after changes were made last December, Murphy said, ``I
still am not completely satisfied with that program.''

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Bar Oklahoma Prosecutors From Forcing Removal of
Bullet</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to bar Oklahoma
prosecutors who seek incriminating evidence from forcing the
surgical removal of a bullet from a murder suspect's arm.
   The court, without comment, turned down Harold Allan Andrews'
arguments that removing the bullet would violate his constitutional
protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.
   The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, by a 2-1 vote last Oct.
27, ruled that the surgery could be peformed against Andrews' will.
   The operation has not yet taken place.
   Andrews is charged with first-degree murder in the March 3, 1988,
shooting death of Hatten Lee Ledford in rural McClain County.
   Before he died, Ledford told someone he thought he had wounded
the man who shot him, whom he identified as John D. Miser.
   Andrews was found, suffering from a gunshot wound, about 750 feet
from Ledford's home.
   A state judge approved county prosecutors' request to compel
surgical removal of the bullet lodged in Andrews' upper arm.
   The state appeals court, in upholding that ruling, noted a
doctor's testimony for prosecutors that removal of the bullet would
not be life-threatening, and would require only a local anesthetic.
   ``The extent of the surgical intrusion upon the defendant's
protective interests, privacy ... personal dignity and body
integrity is not impermissibly significant,'' the state appeals
court ruled.
   In the appeal acted on today, Andrews argued that the Oklahoma
court's decision conflicts with what the justices ruled in a
Virginia case four years ago.
   In the 1985 decision, the high court refused to let Virginia law
enforcement officials force the surgical removal of a bullet from a
criminal suspect's chest.
   ``A compelled surgical intrusion into an individual's body for
evidence ... implicates expectations of privacy and security of such
magnitude that the intrusion may be unreasonable even if likely to
produce evidence of a crime,'' the court said in the 1985 case.
   The justices in that decision drew a distinction between the
surgical removal of a bullet and the taking, over a suspect's
protest, of a blood sample to establish intoxication.
   The court allowed such takings of blood samples in a 1966 ruling.
   The Oklahoma court, distinguishing Andrews' case from the 1985
decision, said the surgery required in the Virginia case was riskier.
   The case is Andrews vs. Love, 88-1296.

<TEXT>
   A newspaper photographer convicted for pursuing
a police chase and photographing a suspect's arrest in Troy, Mich.,
three years ago lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The court, without comment, left intact Mark Robert Hoffman's
conviction on charges of obstructing police work.
   Hoffman, also convicted of reckless driving in connection with
the May 6, 1986, incident, was sentenced to five days in jail and
fined $400.
   His appeal did not challenge the reckless-driving conviction.
   But the appeal attacked a Troy city ordinance that states no one
``shall obstruct, resist, hinder or oppose'' any police officer's
duties.
   Hoffman's lawyers said the ordinance, when invoked against him,
violated free-press rights. They also argued that the ordinance
should be struck down because ``it places unfettered enforcement
discretion in the hands of the police.''
   Hoffman, then working as an intern photographer for The Detroit
News, was driving along Interstate 75 when he heard on his radio
that a nearby police car was pursuing a car that had rammed it.
   Hoffman pulled onto the highway shoulder and waited until he saw
a state police car chasing another car. He then followed, driving up
to 80 miles an hour to stay right behind the state trooper's car.
   When the suspect's car came to a stop, the state trooper stopped
his patrol car right behind it, jumped out and drew his gun.
   Troy police also had guns drawn and pointed at the suspect.
   Hoffman photographed the tense scene, from what his lawyers said
was about 10 feet away. But lawyers for the city told the justices
that Hoffman was as close at 18 inches to the suspect, and that he
refused to get out of the way when ordered to do so by police.
   Hoffman no longer lives in Michigan, his lawyer said, but still
works as a newspaper photographer.
   He has not yet completed the 5-day sentence, or paid the $400
fine.
   The case is Hoffman vs. Troy, 88-1212.

   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by
workers at a California nuclear power plant who are challenging
their employer's random drug tests.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that threw out,
at least temporarily, a lawsuit attacking the tests.
   The justices already are studying the validity of drug tests in
three other cases, one involving a private employer and two
concerning federal workers or federal regulations.
   The case acted on today stems from tests initiated by Southern
California Edison Co. at its San Onofre nuclear plant.
   The tests, modified in December 1986, require randomly selected
workers to produce urine samples for laboratory analysis. The
workers are told the day before they are tested.
   The plan was challenged by Local 246 of the Utility Workers Union
of America.
   The union said the tests violate the collective bargaining
agreement between the workers and the utility, and also violate
provisions of the California Constitution protecting privacy and
freedom from unreasonable searches and seizure.
   The union's lawsuit was filed in state court and transferred to a
federal court at the request of Southern California Edison.
   A federal judge in 1987 temporarily blocked the tests pending
resolution of a grievance filed by the union.
   But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the judge's
injunction, and also ruled that the lawsuit was preempted by federal
labor law.
   The appeals court said the federal Labor Management Relations Act
governing worker-employer disputes bars the nuclear plant workers
from filing a suit now claiming their rights guaranteed by the
California Constitution were violated.
   ``Drug testing does not implicate the sort of non-negotiable
state-law rights'' that would allow the suit to be decided in court
before it is determined whether the tests violate the workers'
collective bargaining agreement, the appeals court said.
   The appeals court said the next step for the union is to submit
the case to arbitration to decide whether the contract was violated
because the utility unilaterally adopted the tests.
   The appeals court did not rule out the possibility that Local 246
could return to the courts if it loses in arbitration.
   The union said it should be entitled now to a ruling on whether
the California Constitution protects workers against random drug
tests.
   The case is Utility Workers Union vs. Southern California Edison,
88-1180.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Hear Appeal by Judge in Pittsburgh in Bankruptcy
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to hear an
appeal by a federal judge in Pittsburgh who issued orders in a
bankruptcy case after he disqualified himself from presiding over
the matter.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that set aside
the judge's orders.
   U.S. District Judge Paul A. Simmons announced in his courtroom on
Jan 29, 1988, that he was disqualifying himself from a case
involving the Jeannette Corp. glass company because of the
appearance of a conflict of interest.
   Simmons disclosed that his daughter worked for Mellon Bank, a
creditor of Jeannette Corp.
   The judge then continued to preside over a hearing that lasted
more than six hours.
   On March 16, 1988, Simmons granted a request to convert
Jeannette's bankruptcy petition from one aimed at reorganizing the
corporation to one dissolving it.
   Simmons also sharply criticized two lawyers involved in the case,
Robert A. Cindrich and Douglas A. Campbell. He accused them of
``trying to rip off this estate in millions of dollars.''
   The lawyers said Simmons' announcement of his orders in the case
were a ```press conference'' to which reporters had been summoned by
the judge's secretary. The attorneys also said there was no basis to
Simmons' accusations against them.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last September that
Simmons should have stepped aside immediately after announcing there
was a potential conflict of interest.
   ``Once a judge has disqualified himself, he or she may enter no
further orders in the case,'' the appeals court said in ordering the
bankruptcy matter assigned to a different judge.
   The appeals court also urged Simmons, ``in light of the animosity
that appears to have arisen'' between himself and the two lawyers,
to consider never again presiding over any matter involving their
firms.
   The appeals court also said the way Simmons announced his orders
at the March 16 proceeding appeared to ``highly inappropriate.''
   The case is Simmons vs. Moody, 88-1174.

   Two women active in fighting pornography today
lost Supreme Court attempts to revive libel lawsuits against Hustler
magazine and its publisher, Larry Flynt.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that 1985 articles
villifying each woman in pornographic terms are constitutionally
protected expressions of opinion.
   Peggy Ault, who founded an anti-pornography group in Milwaukie,
Ore., and Dorchen Leidholdt, a New Yorker who helped found Women
Against Pornography, were the targets of a column published each
month in Hustler.
   The column, which frequently elicits libel suits from its
subjects, singles out people who oppose the sexually explicit
magazine's views. Carrying an epithet as its title, the column
usually engages in personal attacks as well as criticizing its
targets' views.
   Ms. Ault was the column's target in the magazine's April 1985
issue; Ms. Leidholdt in the June 1985 edition.
   Some of the gentler terms used to describe Ms. Ault included
``fanatic,'' ``crackpot,'' ``threatened by sex'' and ``deluded
busybody.''
   Ms. Leidholdt's lawsuit charged that the June 1985 column falsely
described her as ``sexually repressed,'' a person who hates men and
herself and suffers from ``bizarre paranoia,'' ``vengeful
hysteria,'' and ``demented thinking.''
   Ms. Ault sued in federal court in Oregon; Ms. Leidholdt in
federal court in Wyoming.
   Both suits were dismissed by a trial judge before they reached a
jury, and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the
dismissals last October.
   In Ms. Ault's case, the appeals court said, ``We think it clear
that there is a heated and spirited debate on pornography of which
this article is a part, in which epithets, fiery rhetoric and
hyperbole are expected.''
   The appeals court added, ``It is unfortunate that the legal
category of opinion must be used to describe a statement that is no
more than a vicious slur but base and malignant speech is not
necessarily actionable (libel).''
   In the appeals acted on today, lawyers for both women argued that
the 9th Circuit court rulings unduly expanded the concept of legally
protected expressions of opinion.
   ``What public debate is furthered by this type of assault on
personal dignity?'' one appeal asked. ``Elevation of such conduct to
the pedestal of protected speech should not be tolerated.''
   But lawyers for Flynt and his magazine, in urging that the
appeals be rejected, argued that the Constitution protects even
``vituperative, pejorative or pernicious opinion.''
   The cases are Leidholdt vs. L.F.P. Inc., 88-1214, and Ault v.
Hustler Magazine Inc., 88-1215.

   The Supreme Court today refused to revive a
libel lawsuit against the Los Angeles Times by a Naval commander
court-martialed in 1984 after his ship ran aground in Hawaii.
   The justices, citing a lack of jurisdiction, left intact
California court decisions dismissing Cmdr. Willard G. (Bud)
Chrisman's suit that alleged seven Times articles ruined his Naval
career.
   The state courts cited Chrisman's failure to request a correction
or retraction, a requirement under state libel law, and the legal
protection given to fair and accurate reports of governmental
proceedings.
   The first sued-over article reported allegations that Chrisman
had been intoxicated when his ship, the San Diego-based USS
Thomaston, ran aground in Port Allen, Kauai, on Jan. 24, 1984.
   The second article reported that the Navy had decided to
court-martial Chrisman on charges stemming from the grounding.
   The last five articles reported on each day of the court-martial,
concluding with a report that Chrisman had been convicted of
negligently hazarding his ship but acquitted of charges that he was
drunk at the time.
   A state trial judge refused to dismiss Chrisman's suit against
the Times, but an appeals court later ordered that the case be
thrown out.
   The California Supreme Court refused to hear Chrisman's appeal
last July 28.
   In the appeal acted on today, Chrisman argued that the California
retraction law should not have been invoked in his case because the
Times articles had been published with ``actual malice.''
   The appeal also contended that the articles reporting his
court-martial ``were neither true or fair because the testimony was
incorrectly or falsely summarized.''
   Chrisman said the state court rulings ``unconstitutionally extend
the scope of the `neutral reportage' privilege, and literary license
doctrine ... so as to deprive (him) of the right to protect his
reputation from defamatory statements.''
   Lawyers for the newspaper urged the justices to reject Chrisman's
appeal.
   The case is Chrisman vs. Times Mirror Co., 88-844.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Let Idaho Officials Tax Income of Some Railway Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to let Idaho
officials tax the income of railway workers who live elsewhere but
pass through the state as crew members on non-stop freight trains.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that such a tax
would violate the Constitution and be unfair to the workers.
   The Idaho Supreme Court ruled last May that Burlington Northern
Railroad crews working on trains traveling between Spokane, Wash.,
and Whitefish or Missoula, Mont., may not be forced to pay the tax.
   The trains cross Idaho's panhandle without making any scheduled
stops in the state.
   Idaho officials in 1983 ordered the railway workers to pay taxes
on income received from 1978 through 1982. The state sought to
impose the tax on a portion of the workers' income state officials
said was earned while in Idaho.
   The state Supreme Court said, ``Idaho is not the source of this
income since there is no contribution by Idaho to the production of
this income. It would be unfair to allow the state to impose a tax
on the income of the train crews earned while they are merely
passing through Idaho.''
   The state court said the tax violates the Constitution by
interfering with interstate commerce and by denying the workers due
process protection.
   The state court added that the workers' wages while passing
through Idaho ``are not attributable to any economic activity within
Idaho, and Idaho markets and commerce do not affect their income in
any degree.''
   The state court relied largely on U.S. Supreme Court rulings
holding that the test for the constitutionality of a state tax
affecting out-of-state residents is ``whether the state has given
anything for which it can ask return.''
   The state Court said while the state has given something of value
to Burlington Northern, it ``has not given anything to the train
crews for which it can ask return.''
   In the appeal acted on today, Idaho officials said the state
court ruling ``sets a dangerous and disruptive precedent'' and
conflicts with decisions by other courts giving states sweeping
power to tax non-residents who work within those states.
   ``Taxpayers in other jurisdictions are now lining up to challenge
taxation of non-residents based on Idaho's decision,'' the state's
appeal said.
   The case is Idaho Tax Commission vs. Blangers, 88-1266.

<HEAD>GOP Choice: Quiet Team Leader or Flamboyant Scrapper?</HEAD>

   Republicans in the House of Representatives are
like a losing team in search of a new manager _ do they want someone
who'll stress fundamentals and building for the future, or a
scrapper who promises an all-out assault with the weapons at hand?
   That's the issue as House Republicans try to decide on a
successor to Dick Cheney, the new secretary of defense who vacated
the job of minority whip, the GOP's second highest post in the
chamber.
   Rep. Edward Madigan, 53, of Illinois is the solid, steady
lawmaker who makes few headlines but has climbed to stature within
the hallways of Capitol Hill.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, 45, of Georgia is the ideological
rabble-rouser who brashly describes himself as ``a national leader
who serves in the House.''
   The clear choice between two styles and directions is being
presented this week to a Republican group that is itself torn. The
GOP's usual posture of working with the ruling Democrats to win what
it can has lost favor with some Republicans who want to lash out in
frustration after more than three decades as the minority party.
   The decision could color the proceedings of the House for some
time to come. The winner of the race will become the heir apparent
to House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., who is expected to
retire in the next few years.
   ``It is a kind of a watershed,'' said Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn.
   Outside of Washington, Gingrich is by far the better known of the
two candidates. The leader of the Conservative Opportunity Society
can't keep away from the television cameras and, like his nemesis,
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, has a penchant for hyperbole that
leaps into print.
   ``I bring to the office of whip a national network, national
issues, national resources, personal ties to (Republican Chairman
Lee) Atwater, personal ties to the Bush presidential campaign,
personal ties to the executive branch...'' he said, touting his
qualifications at a news conference last Friday.
   Madigan is what the party wants if ``it would prefer to remain in
the minority,'' Gingrich said. ``I am deeply committed to ending the
36-year Democratic monopoly of power in the House,'' he said.
   It was Gingrich who made the official complaint that launched the
current House ethics committee probe of the Democratic Speaker, Jim
Wright of Texas, a move that many on both sides of the aisle at
first considered too daring, too much rocking the boat.
   Part of that complaint involved an favorable deal under which the
speaker published and sold a compilation of personal reflections. A
published report today showed that Gingrich also had an unusual book
arrangement, with political allies forming a limited partnership to
pay for promoting a book Gingrich co-wrote.
   Gingrich argues he is cut out for being the minority whip, a job
of head counting, head bashing and organization. He cites his fight
in the House Administration Committee to get Republicans more staff
slots in the House.
   He says his election as whip also would mean ``integrating ...
the process of legislation and the process of national opinion.
That's a totally different race than the normal whip race.''
   It would be a handy cliche to say that Madigan ``bristles'' at
Gingrich's suggestion that he's the choice of the status quo,
Republican minority, but he doesn't. He calls no press conferences.
In an interview, he calmly tries to refute Gingrich's portrayal of
the race and makes clear that he's talking only about a different
kind of hardball.
   ``There are no content Republicans. All Republicans want to be in
the majority,'' he said. ``And we are an odds-on bet to do that in
1992 without respect to who is elected whip,'' because of
reapportionment and party strength, he said.
   Madigan, the current deputy whip and a senior member of the
Agriculture and Energy and Commerce committees, has been conducting
a low-key campaign ``based on my demeanor, and experience, and
legislative accomplishments.''
   ``I love this institution. I want it to be occupied by a
Republican majority. I do not want it destroyed.'' The last is a
clear reference to Gingrich's willingness to employ radical tactics,
but Madigan denies it. ``I'm not saying anything about Mr. Gingrich,
his campaign, or anything that he says,'' he said.
   To Gingrich, the Democratic majority is a corrupt dictatorship.
He's even compared his feelings toward Speaker Wright to his
feelings toward convicted murderers.
   Madigan is more sympathetic.
   ``The Democrats are as frustrated as the Republicans and are no
more effective as a majority than we are as a minority,'' he said.
``I think they relieve their frustrations by crapping on Republicans
and think that that's some kind of accomplishment, when it's no
accomplishment at all.
   ``I just feel that somebody needs to challenge them to a higher
standard of behavior and productivity,'' he said.
   The Republican election is expected to take place at a party
conference next Wednesday.
   There are just 174 qualified voters, and it's hard to predict
who'll come out on top.
   And there's a potential wild card _ Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois,
a popular conservative who declined to run but has left himself open
for a draft movement announced by Rep. Jerry Solomon, R-N.Y.
   On Friday, both Gingrich and Madigan said they were about to go
over the top in commitments _ predictions close watchers of the race
took with a grain of salt.
   ``With those numbers, we're now a majority party,'' quipped a top
House GOP aide.

<TEXT>
   President Bush said today that he's pleased by
management reforms at the United Nations and said he believes it is
``on the right track'' toward securing greater influence in world
affairs.
   Speaking at a swearing-in ceremony for Thomas Pickering, the new
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Bush said ``I take the United
Nations very seriously and I am pleased with the changes that have
been taking place there.''
   In the first days of his presidency, Bush invited U.N. Secretary
General Javier Perez de Cuellar to a private White House dinner in a
meeting that Bush aides said was aimed at conveying the new
administration's support for the world body.
   The Reagan administration late last year agreed to begin repaying
to the United Nations more than $474 million in payments that the
United States had withheld in protest over what it said were
inadequate management controls and insufficient attention on
peace-making initiatives.
   In his remarks today, Bush, who served as U.N. ambassador during
the Nixon administration, said he wants Pickering to put the
spotlight on the human rights situation in communist Cuba as he
takes up his post.
   ``The United Nations is on the right track toward reform and is
not a more effective organization,'' the president said. He praised
Pickering, 67, as a ``skilled diplomat, a veteran of high-priority,
tough assignments.''
   Bush also said that ``there was a time when a lot of us got a
little pessimistic about the U.N.'s peacekeeping role,'' but said
that the body's performance has improved vastly in recent times,
including its mediating role in Afghanistan, the Iran-Iraq war and
the Angola-Namibia conflict.
   Pickering, after taking the oath of office from Secretary of
State James A. Baker III, joked that he and James Lilly, the new
ambassador to China, might find themselves working under close
scrutiny by Bush, who he said ``knows more about our jobs than we
do.'' Bush headed the U.S. Liaison Office in Beijing in 1974-75.
   ``I will be on my toes in New York,'' said Pickering, who
previously held ambassadorial posts in Israel, Jordan, Nigeria and
El Salvador.
   Pickering succeeds Vernon Walters in the U.N. post.

   Government troops clashed with
communist rebels on the southern island of Mindanao, killing at
least 16 people and wounding scores of others in two separate
incidents, the military said today.
   A military report said government troops killed at least 10
guerrillas and wounded an undetermined number of others during a
battle Sunday in a remote, hilly area north of Davao City, 610 miles
southeast of Manila.
   The report said army troops patrolling the area stumbled into a
100-strong group of communist New People's Army guerrillas near
Paquibato village.
   The report said the rebel casualty figure was based on an actual
body count and gave no further details.
   Also Sunday, five soldiers died and 17 were wounded when their
vehicle struck a rebel landmine near Lakewood in Zamboanga del Sur
province, about 550 miles south of Manila.
   One rebel died when survivors opened fire on guerrillas who had
triggered the mine, the military report said.
   Three soldiers died instantly and the others died before reaching
a hospital in Pagadian, the report said.
   The New People's Army is the armed wing of the Philippine
Communist Party and has waged a 20-year insurgency to establish a
Marxist state.

<HEAD>Pay Telephones on Federal Property Will Remain Under License to Phone
Companies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 3,500 public pay telephones located
on federal government property controlled by the General Services
Administration will remain under license to local Bell companies and
the American Telephone and Telegraph Co., the GSA said today.
   Richard G. Austin, acting GSA administrator, said the decision
was preliminary until GSA conducts a further analysis about
licensing a pay phone company.
   He said the GSA's decision would not prevent the agency from
selecting a long-distance carrier other than AT&amp;T or pay phone
companies other than the Bell companies at a future date.
   GSA's decision was in response to an order in October by U.S.
District Judge Harold Greene under which the owners of premises
where Bell pay phones are located must decide by April 1 which
long-distance carriers to use. If they don't make a choice, they
will be assigned to a long-distance carrier by lottery.
   Greene's order was part of his supervision of the breakup of AT&amp;T
in 1984. AT&amp;T now has a monopoly on long-distance calls from Bell
pay telephones, and Greene said other companies should get a chance
to compete for the $2 billion in long-distance revenues generated
each year from the nation's 1.5 million pay phones.
   The calls in question are those made by dialing ``0'' plus the
long-distance number and either using an operator to charge the call
to a home phone, to make it a collect call or use a credit card.
   Long-distance carriers pay commissions to the businesses where
the pay phones are located. GSA said it received $399,156 in such
commissions in 1988. It said it expects to receive about $663,000
for the federal treasury this year because of increases in the
commission rate.

<HEAD>Court Will Use New Jersey Case to Decide Age Discrimination Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to use a New
Jersey case to decide whether federal courts may make it easier to
broaden age discrimination lawsuits against employers.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.,
which is accused of bias against older workers in laying off some
1,200 employees at New Jersey plants.
   The company dismissed the employees on Feb. 4, 1985. A group of
older workers, who called the day ``Black Monday'' for many veteran
Hoffmann-La Roche workers, said a disproportionately high number of
those laid off was over age 40.
   The group filed a federal lawsuit, charging the company with
violating the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act.
   The group's leaders then sought to contact all fired Hoffmann-La
Roche employees over 40 eligible to join the so-called class-action
lawsuit.
   Some 400 employees agreed to join. But the leaders of the court
battle against the company said they believed there may be 200
additional fired workers who are members of the class allegedly
victimized by age discrimination.
   The leaders sought to contact the potentially missing workers by
direct-mail and notices posted at Hoffmann-La Roche plants.
   U.S. District Judge Harold A. Ackerman authorized the employees'
group, once the missing workers are found, to provide them with an
explanation of the suit and a form that would allow them to join the
suit.
   Hoffmann-La Roche officials appealed the ruling, arguing that
Ackerman exceeded his authority. But the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals upheld the judge's decision.
   ``There is no legal impediment to court-authorized notice in an
appropriate case'' where those who have filed a class-action suit
are seeking other potential plaintiffs, the appeals court said. ``We
assume that the district courts will exercise caution that notices
approved by the courts will not give the erroneous impression that
maintenance of the action has a judicial imprimatur of approval.''
   An increased number of plaintiffs in such suits can be a big
advantage because it spreads out the court costs. In seeking workers
to join the suit, the leaders of the court fight asked for _ but did
not require _ a $200 contribution to help defray the costs.
   In appealing to the Supreme Court, Hoffman-La Roche officials
noted that federal appeals courts elsewhere have disagreed with the
3rd Circuit court decision. The officials urged the high court to
clear up the confusion.
   The case is Hoffmann-La Roche vs. Sperling, 88-1203.

   Two Americans were among eight
winners of this year's King Faisal awards for excellence in science,
medicine, Arabic literature, Islamic studies and service to Islam.
   At a ceremony attended by about 500 people Sunday, Crown Prince
Abdullah presented the awards. Each award carries a $93,000 cash
prize.
   The American winners were Luigi Mastroianni, director of human
reproduction at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine
and Ahmed H. Zewail, a physicist at the California Institute of
Technology.
   Mastroianni, who runs an in vitro fertilization program, shared
the prize in medicine with Professor Robert Edwards of Great
Britain. Edwards helped pioneer the technique that led to the birth
of the world's first test-tube baby in 1978.
   Zewail, an Egyptian-born American, shared the science award for
his research in spectroscopy with Theodore W. Hansch, a professor at
the University of Munich in West Germany. Hansch was honored for his
work in laser physics.
   The prize for service to Islam went to 72-year-old Egyptian
Mohammed Ghazalli, author of 40 books on the faith.
   The Arabic literature prize was shared by Shakir M.K. Saham of
Syria and Yousef A. Khlais of Egypt for studies of Islamic poets and
writers.
   The Islamic studies award went to Iraq's Salah Ahmed Ali for a
study on the emergence of the Iraqi city of Basra under Islam.
   The Faisal Foundation was started in 1976 to honor the late King
Faisal and promotes projects that benefit developing nations.

<HEAD>Iran Approves $140 Billion Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANWAR FARUQI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's parliament ratified a $140 billion
budget today after 12 days of debate, Tehran radio reported.
   It said the budget also was approved by the Guardian Council,
which vets all parliamentary bills to determine whether they comply
with the fundamentalist state's Islamic religion and constitution.
   The council made some amendments and dropped unidentified items
from the budget, according to the radio report monitored in Nicosia.
It did not detail changes.
   Earlier this month, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported
parliament had approved in principle a $123.7 billion budget.
Neither IRNA nor the radio explained the higher figure announced
today.
   Since the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, Tehran has
said its priority is rehabilitating sectors of the economy destroyed
by the eight-year war.
   On Saturday, parliament gave the state's Central Bank permission
to borrow up to $1 billion for electricity generation, provided
repayment of the loan does not exceed $150 million a year, Tehran
radio reported. It did not say where the bank might borrow the money.
   Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh has said Iran would resume
borrowing abroad, reversing its longstanding policy of eschewing
foreign loans.
   But the new policy was rejected by hard-liners such as Ayatollah
Ali Montazeri, designated successor of Iranian leader Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini.
   ``If we start thinking about foreign borrowing, it would mean
selling the country to foreigners,'' Montazeri said.
   Parliament's decision to approve borrowing was seen as indicating
concern about the size of the budget deficit.

<HEAD>Investigator Says Plane Crashed At Steep Angle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A cargo door has become the focus of an
investigation into the crash of a civilian plane that crashed while
carrying military cargo, killing both crew members.
   The DC-9 crashed shortly after takeoff Saturday seven miles
northwest of Fort Worth's Carswell Air Force Base.
   The plane's wreckage was concentrated in a small area and parts
were buried deep in the ground, indicating that it fell at a steep
angle, said Robert Benzen, National Transportation Safety Board
investigator.
   Benzen said the crew reported an emergency and a problem with a
cargo door shortly before the crash.
   ``That is a focus of the investigation, but we're still keeping
our eyes wide open,'' Benzen told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
``Structural engineers are looking at parts of that door now and at
this juncture, it's not telling us what we want. It needs more
study.''
   The jet's flight data recorder was recovered Saturday. The
cockpit voice recorder was sent to Washington for analysis Sunday.
   ``The flight data recorder was battered and very damaged, but we
are very sure the magnetic tape inside was intact,'' Benzen said.
``The cockpit voice recorder was very burned, with components melted
out of it, but the magnetic recording tape is shielded against such
heat, we hope, and hopefully it will tell us something.''
   The plane, built in 1968, was owned by Oregon-based Evergreen
International Aviation and was en route from Carswell to Tinker Air
Force Base near Midwest City, Okla., on a routine cargo flight for
the military, a company spokeswoman said.
   The investigation at the crash site could last several days,
Benzen said. About 30 investigators from the Federal Aviation
Administration, Evergreen International, manufacturer
McDonnell-Douglass, engine maker Pratt &amp; Whitney and the Air Force
examined the wreckage Sunday.

<HEAD>Bomb Removed From Reputed Mob Leader's Club</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police discovered a bomb at the front door of a
mob hangout early today after an anonymous caller said there was a
``gift'' there for John Gotti, reputed head of the Gambino organized
crime family.
   Investigators have said that Gotti and Vincent Gigante, reputed
boss of another Mafia crime family, are locked in a power struggle.
FBI agents have told Gotti they uncovered evidence of a plot to kill
him.
   Officers moved the small bomb from the steps of the Ravenite
social club in the Little Italy section of Manhattan to a bomb squad
range in the Bronx, where it was defused. The club was empty when
the bomb was found.
   The club was the hangout of Gotti's Mafia patron, the late
Aniello Dellacroce, and is one of Gotti's haunts.
   Inspector Richard Mayronne said the device contained a pound of
explosive powder.
   A bomb squad detective, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said it could have ``seriously injured anyone passing by,'' in
addition to damaging the front of the club.
   A man who did not give his name telephoned the Police
Department's Organized Crime Control Bureau and said, ```There is a
gift for John Gotti at the social club,''' according to police Sgt.
Raymond O'Donnell.
   Police described the bomb as a plastic box that contained
batteries wired to a circuit board with an electric timer. It was
not clear when the timer was set to go off, police said. The powder
was contained in an aluminum bottle.

<TEXT>
   Actor Carroll O'Connor, recovering from heart
bypass surgery at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital, developed an
unrelated gall bladder problem and was scheduled for more surgery
today, the hospital said.
   Doctors discovered Saturday that the 64-year-old O'Connor was
suffering from an inflamed gall bladder, hospital spokeswoman Judy
Smith said today.
   ``Studies performed during the weekend revealed a non-functioning
gall bladder,'' she said. When the problem continued, doctors
decided it should be removed.
   The surgery was scheduled for this afternoon.
   O'Connor, best known as Archie Bunker in television's ``All in
the Family,'' was filming his current series, ``In the Heat of the
Night,'' in nearby Covington, Ga., when he was hospitalized for
heart problems March 10. The bypass was performed March 11, and
O'Connor had been scheduled for release from the hospital this week.
   Ms. Smith said doctors do not believe the gall bladder problem is
related to the heart bypass.
   In fact, she said, ``having had his coronary obstructions
corrected, Mr. O'Connor will be able to more safely tolerate this
surgery.''

<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 2 grafs with more from Peres, background. EDITS to TRIM</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today opened a
conference of 1,100 visiting Jews by saying Israel needs peace but
rejected talks with the PLO or creation of a Palestinian state.
   As Shamir's conference on solidarity with Israel began, an aide
to Finance Minister Shimon Peres broke ranks with Shamir and called
for talks with the PLO.
   Deputy Finance Minister Yossi Beilin, who spoke on Israel radio,
urged the left-of-center Labor Party led by Peres to open talks with
the PLO even if Shamir and his right-wing Likud bloc disagree. ``I
think it's time to say, dear friends, the emperor is naked,'' Beilin
said.
   In the occupied territories, Israeli soldiers shot and wounded a
20-year-old Palestinian protester in the thigh, Arab reports said.
   About 330,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip were kept indoors by
curfew restrictions imposed as merchants launched a three-day
general strike to protest seven Palestinian fatalities in clashes
with the Israelis over the weekend.
   Four of the deaths were Sunday, bringing the death toll in the
15-month Palestinian uprising to 403 Arabs. Seventeen Israelis have
also died, including six soldiers.
   Israeli news reports said some leading Jewish personalities
declined to attend Shamir's conference, attended by Jews from 30
countries.
   The Haaretz daily listed among the absentees Hollywood stars
including Kirk Douglas and Barbara Streisand, who reportedly gave
non-political reasons for staying away.
   Critics complain the three-day conference aims to boost support
for Shamir's hard-line policies before his U.S. visit next month.
   However, Jewish leaders at the conference were cautious about
endorsing Israel's policies. ``We are not here to support specific
peace proposals,'' Seymour Reich, president of the U.S.-based
Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations,
told reporters.
   In his keynote speech, Shamir restated positions he is expected
to bring to Washington, offering the Palestinians ``a maximum degree
of self-rule that is consistent with our security.''
   ``We fully recognize that the status quo is not in our interest,
because it means absence of peace, and peace is our paramount
goal,'' Shamir said in the speech closed to the press but later
distributed to reporters.
   Shamir reiterated his reasons for refusing to talk to the
Palestine Liberation Organization or withdraw from the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, which it seized from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle
East War.
   ``We are opposed to negotiations with the PLO because it will
inevitably lead to a demand for a (Palestinian) state west of the
Jordan River,'' he said.
   He referred to ``the strategic dangers and vulnerability of our
eastern borders.''
   The Israeli leader also voiced veiled criticism of Jewish leaders
abroad who have met with PLO leaders.
   Peres suggested today he is willing to talk to PLO supporters in
the occupied territories if they prove they are non-violent. Asked
his conditions for negotiating with the PLO, he said: ``We want to
negotiate with people who reside in the territories. ... We will not
censor their minds.''
   The U.S. government agreed to talk directly with the PLO after
leader Yasser Arafat renounced terrorism in December.

political-military affairs for the State Department.
   Busey has been nominated to head the Federal Aviation
Administration.
   The southern Europe command, based in Naples, Italy, is the
largest of the four military regions that fall under the European
umbrella of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   The command spans an area of 1.5 million square miles, covering
Italy, Greece, Turkey and the Mediterranean and Black seas.

   A trial has begun for four men who
participated in last year's attempt to overthrow Maldivian President
Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, an official in the Indian Ocean archipelago
said Monday.
   The trial of the four Maldivians began Thursday in Male, the
Maldivian capital, and the defendants included Abdul Lutfi, the
alleged leader of the November coup attempt, said Ibrahim Hussain
Zaki, the Maldivian foreign secretary.
   He said the trial of 45 Sri Lankans who also took part in the
coup attempt would begin soon.
   Gayoom has said participants in the coup attempt could face the
death sentence.
   Sri Lankan Tamil militants led by Lutfi raided the Maldives on
Nov. 3, but they fled when 1,600 Indian paratroopers landed in
response to a call for help from Gayoom.
   At least 18 Maldivian civilians were killed in the raid. Most of
the attackers were pursued by Indian naval ships, arrested and
brought to Male.
   The Maldives, about 500 miles south of Sri Lanka, are made up of
about 2,000 islands, of which only 200 are inhabited.

   Jewish militants who claimed to support
anti-Arab leader Rabbi Meir Kahane set fire Monday to the front door
of an outgoing mayor's home, Israel radio reported.
   No one was injured in the attack, which was the third of its kind
in the last five days.
   Dov Tavori, the outgoing mayor of Petah Tikva, a small town about
10 miles from Tel Aviv, said his door was burned before dawn. Tavori
said he had clashed with members of the U.S.-born Kahane's Kach
Party over opening movie theaters in his town on Friday nights, the
eve of the Jewish Sabbath.
   The radio said an anonymous caller told the Yediot Ahronot
newspaper: ``We have set fire to Dov Tavori's house and car. We
identify with Kahane.''
   Police said Tavori's door was destroyed but the rest of the house
did not catch fire. They said traces of flammable liquid were found
around his car.
   Two other attacks occurred Thursday on homes belonging to a
left-wing legislator and a television host who interviewed a
pro-Palestine Liberation Organization figure.

   An offshore oil drilling platform burned early
today after explosions on it and an adjacent rig injured at least 10
crewmen and left seven missing, the Coast Guard said.
   A helicopter and more than a dozen boats searched the Gulf of
Mexico for the missing men. About 30 people were rescued from the
burning rigs and surrounding water, according to the Coast Guard and
the Atlantic Richfield Co.
   Flames on the second rig, connected to the burning one by a
catwalk, were extinguished a few hours after they started Sunday
evening, said Coast Guard Chief Mike Robling.
   The rigs were in an area just off the southeast tip of Louisiana
and near the mouth of the Mississippi River, about 70 miles from New
Orleans, known as the ARCO South Pass Block 60, said company
spokesman Earl Sims in Dallas.
   Five of the missing men work for Atlantic Richfield, which
operated the rigs, and two are contractors, said Sims.
   Coast Guard Petty Officer Bob Morehead said an oil slick two
miles long and about 100 yards wide extended from the rigs. He said
at least four oil crew boats were reportedly attempting to
extinguish the blaze.
   Sims said determining exactly how many people were on the rigs at
the time of the fires would be difficult because there are about 10
rigs within several miles of each other in the area and workers
sometimes move from rig to rig during an assignment.
   ``It would be like trying to tell how many people are in a
building at one time,'' he said.
   The cause of the explosions has not been determined but will be
investigated by the Marine Safety Office, the Coast Guard said.
   ``I just don't know of any specific operations at the time of the
explosion that would have caused this,'' Sims said. ``The damage is
extensive.''
   Ten of the injured were taken to West Jefferson Hospital in
Marrero, a New Orleans suburb. Eight of them were burned, including
two who were in critical condition; and the other two suffered
multiple injuries, said spokeswoman Beth Dutcher.
   Coast Guard Petty Officer Bob Morehead said 13 injuries were
confirmed but he did not know where the other three men were taken
for treatment. Sims said he knew of only 10 injured crewmen, the
ones at West Jefferson Hospital.
   Cmdr. Gerry Donohoe, pilot of one of the helicopters which took
some of the injured to the hospital, said when he left the area
flames were still shooting high from one rig.
   ``It looked like the entire rig would be down to the waterline by
tomorrow,'' he said Sunday.
   ``One crewboat was shooting water, trying to put the fire out,
but it probably won't help much,'' he said. ``It couldn't get very
close.''
   He said he landed on one of the other oil platforms in the
immediate area, where crewboats were taking the injured and others,
including some who apparently jumped into the water.

   Christian and Moslem forces battled today
with heavy artillery and tanks in the capital and the surrounding
hills. Police said five people were killed and 15 wounded.
   The casualties increased the toll to 54 people killed and 179
wounded on the 13th day of the latest round of fighting in Lebanon's
14-year-old civil war.
   Also today, Israeli warplanes bombed what Israel said were Bekaa
Valley bases of the pro-Syrian Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command, a faction of the Palestine Liberation
Organization. Police said six fighter bombers carried out the raid
on the town of Bar Elias, killing six people and wounding nine.
   The Israeli attack came amid continuing artillery clashes between
Christian and Moslem gunners who pounded residential districts on
both sides of Beirut's dividing Green Line.
   A police spokesman said five people, including an army officer,
were killed and 15 wounded, four of them soldiers.
   The spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing
regulations, said the Christian and Moslem forces battled with tanks
and heavy artillery around Souk el-Gharb, an army garrison town 15
miles southeast of the capital.
   Shells fell on at least 10 residential neighborhoods on both
sides of the frontline in Souk el-Gharb, the spokesman said. He said
shells also hit the Christian ports of Beirut and Jounieh and the
airport highway in Moslem west Beirut. The airport has been closed
since March 11.
   The clashes pitted predominantly Christian units of army
commander Gen. Michel Aoun against Syrian-backed fighters of Druse
warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party militia.
   Aoun also leads a Christian Cabinet that rivals a Moslem Cabinet
in this divided nation.
   Mediation efforts to broker a settlement in the new flare-up of
fighting have been deadlocked.

   Designer Karl Lagerfeld gave a leggy, saucy look to
Chanel's ready-to-wear winter collection in his Monday show.
   It looked a bit dated, somehow, like a black-and-white photograph
of the 1960s, or from his previous show for the Lagerfeld label.
   As the Beatles' song ``Help'' played on, the Chanel models in
miniskirts or cat-suits with very long jackets smacked of Twiggy and
Co.
   Lagerfeld is a talented designer, but perhaps too much is
expected of him. His Chanel show repeated many of his themes from
earlier in the week, such as ribbed tights with tiny tunic skirts,
or skirts that were short in front, dipped in back.
   Less leggy but newer and niftier were the straight shirtwaists in
navy and taupe pleated satin with enormous mother-of-pearl buttons.
   The fitted redingote jacket used as a coat-dress paraded through
the collection. For daytime, it was best with a wide band of velvet
down the front edged in gold buttons. For those who haven't the
greatest legs, it would look fine with a skirt as well.
   This jacket-dress also came out for evening in a fitted military
jacket blazed with swirling gold braid. It also appeared as a long
blazer in colorful satin, either on its own with tights, or
unveiling an eyeful of leg between an open, long chiffon skirt.

   The award was presented March 16 by the Oklahoma State University
School of Journalism and Broadcasting in honor of Miller, 82, who
served as chairman of The Associated Press and president of Gannett
Co. Inc. before his retirement in 1978.
   Boccardi joined AP in 1967 and was named president and general
manager in 1985.
   Boccardi has twice served as a Pulitzer Prize juror and has been
elected a Distinguished Service member of the American Society of
Newspaper Editors.
   He also is a member of advisory boards for the Media and Society
Seminars, Gannett Center for Media Studies, Center for International
Journalism at the University of Southern California and the Center
for Communications.
   Miller graduated from Oklahoma State in 1931 and joined AP in
1932. He spent 15 years with the AP before joining Gannett in 1947
as executive assistant to Frank E. Gannett. Miller was with Gannett
for 31 years, the last 16 as president and chief executive officer.

   Sporting a shamrock on his lapel, Vladimir
Orekhovsky chuckled when he told of singing an Irish lullaby during
the annual St. Patrick's Day parade down Main Street.
   He and 10 other members of a Soviet inspection team in Utah under
provisions of a 1987 nuclear arms reduction treaty were invited to
the parade's reviewing stand in one of many appearances sponsored by
Utahans eager to foster international goodwill.
   ``I sang `Danny Boy,''' he said in an interview at the apartment
complex that is home to the 26-member contingent maintaining a
round-the-clock vigil at Hercules Aerospace's missile manufacturing
plant.
   Orekhovsky was public relations officer for the team, whose
members serve six-week tours before rotating back to the Soviet
Union.
   But until he left for home Monday, his movements, like those of
all the Soviet inspectors who will be in Utah for the next 13 years,
were under the strict supervision of the U.S. On-Site Inspection
Agency.
   It's a control many Utah peace activists want relaxed.
   Since the original team arrived last July, the Soviets have been
warmly received in classrooms and at sporting and cultural events.
   Team commander Nickolay Shabalin, speaking through an
interpreter, recalled the ``special satisfaction'' of seeing Ballet
West, a regional professional ballet company, perform ``Anna
Karenina,'' and a local exhibit of paintings by Soviet children.
   But Shabalin emphasized the Soviets' principal duty is to ensure
that no Pershing II missile motors banned under the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty leave Hercules. The company
stopped producing the motors in 1986 and none are stockpiled here.
   ``One should not get the wrong impression that the Soviet
inspectors came here as tourists,'' said Orekhovsky. ``The most
important reason that we arrive here is the verification of the
treaty.''
   Eight-man squads serve 24-hour shifts at a checkpoint by an
entrance to the Hercules complex in western Salt Lake Valley,
inspecting outgoing vehicles and patrolling a road surrounding the
former Pershing building. They work one day, then have two days off.
   ``The work of monitoring is not very complicated, but it is very
responsible,'' Shabalin said.
   Under terms of the treaty, the visitors may not travel without an
American escort or or go more than 31 miles from Hercules. The same
conditions apply to U.S. inspectors at a similar plant in the Soviet
city of Votkinsk.
   The inspectors have been tireless in accepting invitations to
public forums. They say they don't chafe under the rigid rules
governing their excursions, but the same can't be said for some of
their hosts.
   Edwin Firmage, a University of Utah law professor and
anti-nuclear activist, and Rosemary Holt, president of Women
Concerned About Nuclear War, are trying to persuade the inspection
agency to allow the inspectors to accept dinner invitations at
private homes.
   Both believe the agency's denial of private visits, for security
reasons, is without merit, especially since the Soviets have
appeared so often in public.
   When the first group of Soviets arrived, some were permitted to
attend barbecues at a couple of private homes before the policy was
changed, Holt said.
   ``We saw that not only as an opportunity lost for the citizens of
Utah, but for the Soviets to know us in a personal way,'' she said.
``There's a difference between sitting down with a cup of coffee, as
opposed to speeches _ a world of difference.''
   ``We must see each other fundamentally in our common humanness,''
Firmage said. ``The overwhelming, transcending reality is that we
are human beings.''
   Inspection agency spokeswoman Mary Wilson, declined to discuss
details but said security is paramount.
   There are other considerations, she said. ``If you get to where
you're accepting some, but not others, you get into a discrimination
problem,'' she said.
   Shabalin, vice director of the National Nuclear Risk Reduction
Center in Moscow, avoids any appearance of taking sides.
   ``The solution of this question rests with the proper American
authorities,'' he said. ``Its positive or negative solution doesn't
affect in any way the accomplishment of the mission we have.''

<HEAD>Researcher Says Higher Crop Yields Could Be Followed by Pests and
Diseases</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Climate warming could mean higher crop
yields in the Northern states and Canada but agricultural pests and
diseases could well follow, a Columbia University researcher said
Monday.
   Cynthia Rosenzweig told the Association of American Geographers
that the effects of threatened global warming must be studied in
combination, not one at a time.
   For example, she said, scientists have tended to look at such
things as temperature and rainfall and how those affect crops.
Instead, she said, an overall study must be done not only of how
each change affects life but of how the changes interact.
   Rosenzweig spoke at a session on global change, which focused on
the greenhouse warming of the atmosphere many scientists say could
have serious effects on mankind.
   The greenhouse theory is that carbon dioxide and other gases
released into the atmosphere by industrial and other processes will
trap heat from the sun, warming the planet in somewhat the same way
that a greenhouse is warmed.
   Scientists speculate this could have an impact on crop growth and
rainfall patterns and even could melt some of the polar ice caps and
produce a disastrous rise in sea levels.
   There is disagreement over whether such a warming has already
begun. Most meteorologists contend that last year's hot, dry summer
was part of normal weather variability and not a result of the
greenhouse effect.
   Nonetheless, scientists tend to agree that warming is likely in
coming years, although the amount depends on factors not fully
understood.
   Rosenzweig reported that she has looked at two models of
potential climate change and found that the likely result would be
smaller crop yields in the Southeast and Midwest, but increases in
production in the Northern states and parts of Canada, largely due
to the longer growing season as the climate warms.
   This warming led to increased need for irrigation in some areas,
she added, and irrigation could become more cost-effective as
smaller crop yields drove up prices.
   In addition to better crops in the Northern areas, however, the
warmth will also allow survival of crop pests during the winter in
more northerly areas, as well as the mosquitoes and other factors
that can spread livestock diseases, she said.
   These findings illustrate the need to look at economic, medical
and other results of climate change, she said.
   William E. Easterling, of the research firm Resources for the
Future Inc., told the same meeting that his company has begun a
study focusing on the gradual response to change.
   Global warming will come gradually and people will seek ways to
adjust to it, he said. It is necessary to start thinking about the
technology, crop varieties and economic system that will exist 50 or
75 years in the future, said Easterling, in order to plan for
climate change.
   Since the 1920s, he said, the growing of hard, red winter wheat
has expanded from a region focused on Kansas and Nebraska to areas
extending all the way from Canada to Texas.
   This happened because of improvements in the varieties of wheat
available and in farming methods, he said.
   Both Easterling and Rosenzweig stressed the need for increased
research on drought and on crops that can resist heat.
   Rosenzweig, however, added that adjusting the type of crop grown
helps cope with change in some areas, but isn't effective in all
regions.
   At the same time, she said, climate change will be affecting the
whole world, not just the United States, so farmers need to keep in
mind the needs of other nations and the export demand for their
products.

<HEAD>Bush Says Compromise Necessary on Automated Weapons</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 12 grafs new with Bush comments; picks up 3rd graf pvs,
I thought. Editing throughout to shorten.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush today called himself a proud
member of the National Rifle Association but said a compromise must
be struck on automated weapons because ``we're in a very different
time now.''
   ``The country needs to know that there is some answer to this. I
don't yet know what it is,'' he told a group of women state
legislators.
   Later, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater told
reporters ``clearly there's been some evolution of his (Bush's)
thinking'' on gun control.
   Fitzwater also voiced White House concerns over reports that NRA
officials had hinted at political repercussions to national drug
control Director William Bennett if he cracks down too hard on gun
sales.
   ``This is not a time for threatening people, but time to work
together,'' Fitzwater said.
   Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Associated
Press last week that Bennett had been receiving warnings from the
rifle association through third parties hinting that NRA's campaign
fundraising abilities might be used against him if he ever sought
political office.
   Bennett said through a spokesman, Don Hamilton, that ``there have
been a lot of phone calls, a lot of pressure. Let's cool off.'' At
the time, NRA official Wayne LaPierre called the allegations
``absolutely ridiculous.''
   Bush directed Bennett to review the entire issue of
semi-automatic weapons. Fitzwater said today that the administration
would take no further action until that review is complete beyond
last week's banning of the import of semiautomatic weapons.
   In his talk to women legislators, Bush said: ``On the NRA, of
which I am a member, a proud member, I believe we can find an
accommodation between the legitimate interest of sportsmen and the
interests of police chiefs, whose men put their lives on the line
every day.''
   ``We're in very different time now. I am convinced that
reasonable men and women can work together to find an answer to the
problem of these automated weapons,'' Bush said.
   Bush's comments came against a backdrop of disagreement among
senior federal officials over how fast and far the government should
go in urging gun manufacturers to follow the example of Colt
Industries Inc. and stop non-military sales of semiautomatic assault
rifles.
   The head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, John Lawn, on
Sunday urged an end to such sales, but drug czar Bennett and
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh advised caution.
   ``I thought that was a very courageous action on the part of
Colt. Guns are dangerous; law enforcement is suffering because of
these guns,'' Lawn said on the CBS-TV program, ``Face the Nation.''
   ``I am asking them to (take this action), on behalf of the
officers who are in danger every single day, because a police
officer dies every 57 hours in this country,'' he said.
   Colt announced that it was suspending sales of its AR-15
semiautomatic rifle starting last Thursday, the day after President
Bush decided to ban temporarily the import of foreign-made assault
rifles.
   Bennett and Thornburgh urged a broader approach to combating
illegal narcotics and said there are limits on what the government
can tell private manufacturers of semiautomatic weapons.
   ``This is not a dictatorship,'' Bennett said on CBS. ``We do not
tell people how to do their business.''
   But in a separate appearance on the NBC-TV program, ``Meet the
Press,'' Bennett said: ``I think we can make the case that we don't
need a whole lot more assault rifles on our streets right now.''
   Bennett also said ``we have to get ... the person who is
sometimes called the casual user. One expert in this field has told
me that 70 percent of the cocaine that's used in this country is
used by the so-called recreational user, the yuppie user.''
   That person, Bennett said, ``needs to realize ... the kinds of
things he's responsible for _ the murder and mayhem that's going on
in Washington, the fact that we have babies now being born addicted
to cocaine, the murder of DEA agents in other countries.
   ``These people are accessories to all those things, and they need
to start paying a price for that. .. If you're using cocaine and
driving around in your BMW, when you get stopped you lose your BMW.
There are ways we can make people pay the price and help them
recognize what they're doing to the nation's children.''
   Thornburgh cautioned against believing that ``gimmicks'' could
stop drug abuse.
   ``If we think that the only way to deal with the drug problem is
to ban a particular type of weapon, we're dead wrong,'' Thornburgh
said on the ABC-TV program, ``This Week with David Brinkley.''
   Addressing the issue of drug use in nation's capital, Bennett
said he had not yet decided whether to declare the federal district
a ``high intensity drug trafficking area,'' enabling him to assemble
a government strike force to fight drug dealing in Washington.
   As of Sunday, 118 murders had been reported in Washington in
1989, a record rate, and police say that nearly all are drug-related.
   The Washington Post, quoting unidentified Bennett aides, said
Sunday that the strike force would target repeat drug offenders, try
to shut down the city's 90 open-air drug markets, and use abandoned
military facilities as temporary prisons for drug offenders.
   ``We are looking at whether we should do that or not,'' Bennett
said.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In reactors, radiology departments and research
labs, workers at the end of the day cast off gloves and other
discards whose radioactivity, though relatively mild, requires
careful disposal. Now, with federal prodding, states are acting to
find new ways of getting rid of mountains of low-level nuclear
waste. Associated Press reporters have looked at the leaky legacy
and uncertain future of the disposal process. Here, they examine the
complexities of dealing with potentially lethal leftovers and how
rural Nebraskans reacted to the possibility of a dump site in their

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   NEWSPAPER MERGER
   
   The court cleared the way for the partial merger of Detroit's two
daily newspapers.
   The court, over two dissenting votes, set aside an earlier
postponement that had been granted by Justice William J. Brennan.
   A federal appeals court panel here voted 2-1 last Jan. 27 to
uphold then-Attorney General Edwin Meese's decision to allow the
newspapers to form a joint operating agreement under the federal
Newspaper Preservation Act.
   The 1970 law empowers the attorney general to give financially
failing newspapers an exemption from antitrust laws.
   Under the joint operating agreement, the Detroit Free Press and
The Detroit News would combine their business, advertising and
production departments but maintain separate news and editorial
staffs.
   The case is Michigan Citizens for an Independent Press vs.
Thornburgh, A-695.
   
   PEYOTE
   
   The court agreed to decide whether there is a constitutional
right to take the hullocinogenic drug peyote as a religious practice.
   The court agreed to review a ruling that Oregon officials
violated religious freedom by denying unemployment compensation to
two men fired for using peyote at religious ceremonies.
   The case is Employment Division vs. Smith, 88-1213.
   
   AGE BIAS
   
   The court agreed to use a New Jersey case to decide whether
federal courts may make it easier to broaden age discrimination
lawsuits against employers.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.,
which is accused of bias against older workers in laying off some
1,200 employees at New Jersey plants.
   The case is Hoffmann-LaRoche vs. Sperling, 88-1203.
   
   ABORTION DEMONSTRATION
   
   The court turned away an appeal by 10 people criminally convicted
for their participation in a 1985 protest demonstration at a
Philadelphia abortion clinic.
   The justices, refused to hear arguments that the defendants
wrongly were barred from asserting medical justification as a
defense for their crimes.
   The case is Markum vs. Pennsylvania, 88-1218.
   
   HUSTLER
   
   The court let stand rulings that 1985 articles in Hustler
magazine villifying two women active in fighting pornography are
constiutionally protected expressions of opinion.
   The two women lost their attempts to revive libel lawsuits
against Hustler magazine and its publisher, Larry Flynt.
   The cases are Leidholdt vs. L.F.P. Inc., 88-1214, and Ault v.
Hustler Magazine Inc., 88-1215.
   
   RELIGIOUS SERVICES
   
   Left intact rulings that the requirement of a Florida-based
company that all its employees attend weekly Christian devotional
services violated the rights of an atheist who worked there.
   The Townley Manufacturing Co., based in Chandler, Fla., lost its
appeal, in which its lawyers argued that the owner's
constitutionally protected religious freedoms were violated.
   The case is Townley Manufacturing Co. vs. EEOC, 88-988.
   
   ENVIRONMENTAL SUITS
   
   The court agreed to decide a narrow, but potentially significant,
point of environmental law _ one that may affect the effectiveness
of private citizen enforcement.
   The justices said they will consider reinstating a lawsuit
against a Tillamook County, Ore., landfill by the couple who own an
adjacent dairy farm.
   The case is Hallstrom vs. Tillamook County, 88-42.
   
   MILK
   
   The court turned away a still-pending, big-money antitrust
dispute over the sale of raw milk.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court
ruling that could cost millions for two cooperative associations of
dairy farmers and a marketing agent for dairy cooperatives.
   The cases are Central Milk Producers Cooperative vs. National
Farmers Organization, 88-1247, and Associated Milk Producers vs.
National Farmers Organization, 88-1248.

<HEAD>Judge Stops City From Enforcing Teen Curfew</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge today stopped the District of
Columbia from enforcing the city's new emergency curfew law for
teen-agers.
   After a hearing on a suit brought by the American Civil Liberties
Union, U.S. District Judge Charles Richey issued a 10-day temporary
restraining order blocking enforcement of the statute. In issuing
his ruling, the judge said the law was too broad.
   He noted that Mayor Marion Barry Jr. has said alternative
legislation will be proposed to narrow the law.
   Richey said he would extend the restraining order if Barry's
legislation does not differ from the emergency bill reviewed today.
Barry's revised measure is expected to go to the City Council on
Tuesday or next week.
   The law went into effect last Thursday but Barry delayed
enforcement of the measure until Monday night to give police time to
become familiar with its provisions and to inform the public.
   ACLU attorney Arthur Spitzer said the law would penalize youths
and also could give them a permanent legal record.
   City attorneys, however, argued that parents would be penalized.
But, Richey noted that the students' names would be entered into a
permanent police record which might affect their ability to get jobs.
   The ACLU filed suit on Friday to declare the temporary, 90-day
law unconstitutional.
   The class-action suit was filed on behalf of the parents of five
teen-agers, a 12-year-old boy and three other individuals.
   Barry criticized the ACLU suit last week, saying ``the ACLU
lawyers don't sleep in these neighborhood where you can't sleep at
night because gunshots, killings are going on.''
   The curfew law requires persons under age 18 to be off the
streets at 11 p.m. during the week, and by midnight on weekends. The
curfew ends daily at 6 a.m.

   The late CIA Director William Casey tried to
discredit a congressional staffer who had met with an official of
Nicaragua's leftist government, a former House member said today.
   Former Rep. Michael Barnes, D-Md., gave the testimony at Oliver
North's Iran-Contra trial while answering defense questions about
Victor Johnson, staff director of the Foreign Affairs subcommittee
on Western Hemisphere affairs that Barnes chaired.
   Johnson at the time was assisting Barnes in pressing the Reagan
administration to respond to press reports that North was soliciting
contributions and providing tactical advice to the Contra rebels in
Nicaragua.
   Under cross-examination by North lawyer Brendan Sullivan, Barnes
said Casey requested a meeting in the fall of 1985 in which the CIA
director said the spy agency had intercepted a conversation of a
Nicaraguan official.
   The other party in the conversation was Johnson. Casey died in
1987.
   Barnes said Casey quoted Johnson as telling the Nicaraguan
official that if Nicaragua improved human rights and took other
steps, those actions would help members of Congress who were trying
to reject aid to the Contras.
   ``I found the allegations he made to be basically frivolous,''
said Barnes. ``He didn't allege that members of my staff'' were
passing classified information to the Nicaraguan government.
   ``I told him in my judgment, based on what he told me,'' that
what Johnson had done ``was perfectly appropriate,'' said Barnes.
   Earlier today, Barnes testified that then-national security
adviser Robert McFarlane seemed ``very nervous'' about congressional
inquries over North's activities.
   Barnes described how McFarlane in a 1985 meeting offered to let
him examine National Security Council documents pertaining to the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels, but that McFarlane refused to let
congressional staffers see them.
   The meeting in McFarlane's office occurred after he had denied in
a Sept. 12, 1985 letter to Barnes that National Security Council
staffers were engaged in fund-raising assistance and offering
tactical advice to the Contras.
   North now is accused of obstructing Congress and making false
statements in connection with that letter and two others written in
1985.
   ``Were you aware that North collaborated with Mr. McFarlane on
writing that letter,'' prosecutor Michael Bromwich asked. ``No,''
responded Barnes.
   The ex-congressman said that in a subsequent letter with
McFarlane and face-to-face meeting, he requested all documents
relating to communications between the United States government and
the Contras.
   ``I felt that Mr. McFarlane was very concerned about our
investigation, very nervous about it,'' Barnes said. He emphasized
that ``I felt he was very nervous'' in the meeting.
   Barnes said he rejected McFarlane's offer to examine the
documents, saying it was always necessary in such cases to have
knowledgeable congressional staffers examine them.
   ``I wasn't prepared to accept the restrictions'' that only he be
permitted to look at the documents, said Barnes.
   On cross-examination, Sullivan referred to a memo by
congressional staffer Johnson five days after the Sept. 12 written
denial of Contra assistance.
   The memo said that if Congress puts the executive branch in the
position of non-disclosure on the Contra issue, that refusal
``embarrasses'' the administration ``and helps us.''
   Sullivan sought to show that the Contra issue had become highly
politicized. He brought out in questioning Barnes that all members
serving on a House task force that was dealing with the issue were
opposed to starting up aid to the rebels.
   During the period of Barnes' inquiries, the Boland Amendment
enacted by Congress specified that no federal agency engaged in
intelligence activities could spend money to assist the Contras.

<HEAD>Court to Rule Whether Taking Drug as Religious Practice Can Be a
Crime</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide
whether taking a hallucinogenic drug as a religious practice can be
made a crime.
   The justices voted to review a ruling that Oregon officials
violated religious freedom by denying unemployment compensation to
two men fired for using peyote at religious ceremonies.
   In their decision, expected sometime next year, the justices
necessarily must resolve whether any state may criminally prosecute
someone for the religious use of peyote.
   In other matters, the court:
   _Cleared the way for the partial merger of Detroit's two daily
newspapers.
   _Agreed to let the Bush administration, through the solicitor
general's office, participate in the April 26 oral argument
scheduled for an abortion-regulation case from Missouri.
   State officials are asking the justices to use the case to
reverse or limit the court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion.
   _Let stand the criminal convictions of 10 people who participated
in a 1985 protest demonstration at a Philadelphia abortion clinic.
   _Refused to revive libel lawsuits, one in Oregon and one in
Wyoming, against Hustler magazine and its publisher, Larry Flynt, by
two women active in fighting pornography.
   _Turned down the appeal of California death row inmate William
George Bonin, the ``Freeway Killer'' of four teen-age boys in Orange
County.
   _Refused to bar Oklahoma prosecutors who seek incriminating
evidence from forcing the surgical removal of a bullet from a murder
suspect's arm.
   _Left intact decisions thwarting a Florida-based company's
requirement that all its employees attend weekly Christian
devotional services. Lower courts said the mandatory services
violated an atheist's rights.
   In the peyote case, the Oregon Supreme Court last year ruled that
its state's criminal law makes no exception for the religious use of
peyote, a cactus ``button'' containing the hallucinogen mescaline.
   But the state court ruled that the federal Constitution's First
Amendment, which protects religious freedom, bars state officials
from denying unemployment compensation to two members of the Native
American Church.
   In effect, the state court said Oregon criminal law must make an
exception for ``good faith religious use of peyote by adult members
of the Native American Church.''
   The two men, Galen Black and Alfred Smith, had been fired from
their Douglas County, Ore., jobs counseling people who suffer from
drug or alcohol addiction.
   There is no dispute that both men are members of the Native
American Church and sincerely believe that peyote is part of the
church's religious practices.
   Lawyers for the two men said using small quantities of the drug
in that church is comparable to sacramental use of small quantities
of wine in Christian religious ceremonies.
   The case was before the nation's highest court last year, and the
justices voted last April to send it back to the Oregon Supreme
Court.
   The April decision held out the possibility that states in which
peyote is outlawed may deny unemployment benefits to workers fired
for using it during religious ceremonies.
   But Justice John Paul Stevens, in writing for the court then,
noted that the federal government and some states exempt the
religious use of peyote from criminal prosecution.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Push For Water Efficiency Standards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are flushing too much of a precious
resource down the toilet, say two lawmakers who are pushing for
strict water-flow standards on household plumbing fixtures.
   Manufacturers are fighting the congressional attempt to impose
first-ever federal efficiency standards on toilets, shower heads and
other fixtures.
   The average American uses more than 18,000 gallons of water a
year in the home _ about 50 gallons a day. Of that, 40 percent goes
down the drain from toilets, said Rep. Chester G. Atkins, D-Mass.
   ``The amount that is used unnecessarily is staggering, especially
in light of the fact that new technology to improve performance of
water-saving products is commercially available,'' he said.
   Atkins and Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., have drafted legislation
that would mandate national water efficiency standards for household
plumbing fixtures such as faucets, washing machines, dishwashers,
shower heads and toilets.
   The largest savings would come from better toilets.
   Only one state, Massachusetts, has imposed toilet efficiency
standards.
   Amy Vickers, project manager at the Massachusetts Water Resource
Authority, estimates that the new 1.6 gallons-per-flush state
standard, which took effect earlier this month, will save the
typical Boston household $70 a year.
   Older toilets typically use 5 gallons of water per flush; newer
models, 3.5 gallons.
   Massachusetts' standard will save the state about 70 million
gallons of water daily by early in the 21st century, Ms. Vickers
projected.
   On a national scale, that would mean a savings of 2 billion to 3
billion gallons of water a day from the most efficient toilets, she
said.
   Proponents of low-flow standards say they could eliminate the
need for building expensive water supplies and water-treatment
facilities, especially in big cities such as Boston and New York
where officials already are worrying about balancing limited water
supplies against ever-increasing demand.
   Toilet manufacturers oppose the legislation, saying it would
create an unnecessary bureaucracy and amount to an improper
intrusion by Washington into an area that has been traditionally
handled by local governments.
   ``It puts the federal government for the first time directly into
the process of writing building codes and standards. And the federal
government, for the last 200 and some-odd years, has tried very hard
to stay out of that process and leave it to the states and local
communities,'' said Richard Church, president of the Plumbing
Manufacturers Institute.
   Church said it would be dangerous to ``force manufacturers to
bring that technology out before it's completely tested,''
especially for installing the more efficient ``water closets'' _ as
the industry still calls toilets _ in older houses.
   ``We're quite concerned that in specific localities there's apt
to be severe problems if 1.6 (gallons-per-flush toilets) are the
only ones available,'' said Church. ``You're asking for problems.''
   ``Water closets are flushed with gravity. At 1.6 gallons, we're
right on the edge of what gravity can actually do,'' he said.
   But proponents of the legislation scoff at the suggestion that
the bill's 1992 deadline for more efficient toilets would be
difficult for the industry to meet.
   ``This isn't like trying to go to the moon,'' said Ms. Vickers.
   The two leading U.S. toilet manufacturers, American Standard and
Kohler Co., are fighting the legislation.
   Although the toilet provision has drawn the most controversy, the
legislation is, as an Atkins aide, Rob Henken, says, ``by no means
just a toilet bill.''
   The proposal would set a 2.5 gallons-per-minute standard for
shower heads and kitchen faucets, a 2 gallons-per-minute standard
for bathroom faucets and a 1 gallon-per-flush standard for urinals,
Henken said.
   Those requirements would take effect in January 1991, a year
before the standard for toilets, he said.
   The bill also would require the Energy Department, within three
years of enactment, to set water efficiency standards for washing
machines and dishwashers.

   Real-estate magnate Donald Trump said today he is
no longer willing to pay $365 million for the Eastern Airlines
shuttle, citing the labor problems that have largely grounded the
financially troubled air carrier.
   He said he wants to cut the price by more than one-third. There
was no immedite response from Texas Air Corp., Eastern's
Houston-based parent company.
   In a letter to Frank Lorenzo, head of Eastern's parent company
Texas Air, Trump said, ``The shuttle has become an entirely
different business in that its market share and customer base may be
lost for some time to come, if not forever.''
   ``Today the business is worth considerably less than the price
negotiated last fall,'' Trump said.
   Asked in an interview today how much he wants to cut the price,
he said: ``I'm looking for a reduction in excess of $125 million.''
   The New York billionaire financier announced last October that he
would purchase the moneymaking operation for $365 million in cash
and name it after himself.
   However, the strike by Eastern's Machinists union members,
chiefly mechanics and baggage handlers, and the unwillingness of
most of the airlines' pilots to cross their picket lines has forced
Eastern to file for bankruptcy.
   Only about 200 of the 3,600 Eastern pilots have been working
since the strike by the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers began March 4.
   Eastern has been operating only slightly more than 100 daily
fights, about one-10th its normal level.
   The airline, which has begun advertising for new pilots, has
acknowledged there are no near-term prospects for expanding its
operations.
   Shuttle flights are among those still taking off. The airline has
been struggling to keep the shuttle between Boston, New York and
Washington in the air by offering a number of passenger incentives,
including promotional fares as low as $12. Fares returned to normal
Saturday.
   Trump said he remained interested in buying the shuttle and would
like to close a deal ``before the shuttle operations become worse.''
   In his letter, he asked Lorenzo to call him later today to
discuss the sale.
   Asked about the Trump report, Eastern spokesman Jim Ashlock said,
``We don't have any comment at all. We know absolutely nothing about
it here.'' In Houston, Texas Air spokesman Art Kent did not
immediately return a telephone call seeking comment.

   A trial ended Monday for two dozen
Britons accused in the deaths of 39 fans during a riot at the 1985
European soccer championship final, and the three-judge panel will
issue a verdict April 28.
   The defendants, charged with involuntary manslaughter in Europe's
worst soccer riot, face up to 10 years in prison if convicted.
   Two Belgian police officials and a former chairman of the Belgian
Soccer Federation face lesser charges of poor security organization
at the match.
   Monday's closing arguments ended more than five months of
hearings to establish blame in the riots at Heysel Stadium prior to
the May 29, 1985 final between Liverpool and Juventus Turin of Italy.
   ``All the cards are on the table'' for the judges to make their
final decision, said public prosecutor Pierre Erauw.
   Belgian authorities requested the extradition of 26 Britons based
on videotapes and pictures showing British fans tearing down the
flimsy fence separating them from Italian supporters. The invasion
of the stands caused panic during which victims were trampled to
death as they tried to flee.
   Britain complied with the extradition request in September 1987
and the trial began in a year later. The defendants had been allowed
to wait at home for the trial to begin.
   More than 500 fans also suffered injuries in the riot.

   A federal judge today declared a mistrial in
the racketeering trial of six former narcotics officers accused of
shaking down drug dealers as members of an elite police team known
as Five Squad.
   U.S. District Judge John Hannum made the ruling after the jury,
which deliberated more than 30 hours over six days, reported it was
hopelessly deadlocked.
   Charges against the ex-officers included conspiracy, racketeering
and filing false tax returns. Prosecutors contended the defendants
stole drugs and more than $400,000 seized from drug dealers.
   Defense attorneys attacked credibility of government testimony
from three dozen drug dealers and two former members of Five Squad,
which disbanded in 1985.

   Pan American World Airways is still failing to
heed many anti-terrorism measures an Israeli security firm suggested
to the carrier more than two years ago, a congresswoman said today.
   The security consultant concluded that Pan Am conducted
insufficient checks of baggage, did a poor job of questioning
passengers boarding planes, and was slow to react to warnings of
possible terrorist activity, Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., said in a
letter to the Federal Aviation Administration.
   She quoted passages from two reports KPI Inc. presented to Pan Am
in September and November of 1986.
   The firm had reviewed Pan Am security at nine airports, including
Frankfurt and London's Heathrow Airport. Pan Am's Flight 103, on
which a bomb exploded last Dec. 21 over Scotland, killing 270
people, originated in Frankfurt and stopped at Heathrow.
   ``Pan Am is highly vulnerable to most forms of terrorist
attack,'' the September report said. ``The fact that no major
disaster has occurred to date is merely providential.''
   That report was written ``within days'' of a Sept. 6, 1986 attack
on a Pan Am plane in Karachi, Pakistan, in which 18 passengers and
crew members were slain, Mrs. Collins said.
   She quoted the KPI report as saying: ``In conclusion, there are
no adequate safeguards under the presently operating security system
that would prevent a passenger from boarding a plane with explosives
on his person or in his baggage, whether or not he is aware of the
fact.''
   In her letter to acting FAA Administrator Robert E. Whittington,
Mrs. Collins, chairwoman of the House Government Operations
transportation subcommittee, wrote: ``Based on its own
investigation, the subcommittee has determined that many of the gaps
in Pan Am's security system that were identified in the 1986 KPI
reports have not yet been corrected.''
   She added that Pan Am ``insists that the security breaches
identified in the KIP reports have been addressed.''
   Louise Kuzma, a secretary at Pan Am's New York headquarters, said
spokesmen for the airline were at lunch and could not immediately
comment on the letter.

   The second million comes easy, the adage
goes, but for Dixie Elementary students the problem is getting rid
of the first million.
   The first million aluminum can pulltabs, that is.
   The tabs fill a large wooden bin on the second floor, spill down
the stairways and litter the yard of the 1920s red brick schoolhouse
in this town northeast of Walla Walla.
   The collection began 2{ years ago in Cynthia Geddes' third- and
fourth-grade classroom as a math project to learn the concept of a
million.
   ``You don't often get the opportunity to see a million of
anything,'' Geddes said. ``The kids love to look at them.''
   Senior citizens, tavern owners, foreign students and a railroad
sent the tabs in response to letters written by pupils.
   At a celebration Jan. 31, contributors wore buttons that read:
``I Helped Dixie Save A Million.''
   The math lesson has expanded to geography and world affairs, said
Geddes. Dixie pupils pinned tabs from Finland, Japan, Australia,
South Africa and Israel to a world map, and sent each contributor a
hand-written thank you note.
   The school plans to donate the tabs to a charity _ at 50 cents a
pound, the tabs would be worth about $600 _ but is having trouble
finding the right one, said Ray Yoder, the school superintendent.
   School officials were told the tabs could be traded for time on
kidney dialysis machines, but found out later this was not true.

   Episcopalians and Catholics have parted ways
again, but this time it was an amicable separation.
   Trinity Episcopal Church shared its facilities with St. Francis
for 10 months while the Roman Catholic church underwent restoration.
   On Sunday, after a joint service, Trinity members escorted the
parishioners back to their house of worship.
   The Rev. John Lane of Trinity said he was ``kind of sorry to see
them go, in a way.''
   ``I can think of nothing but that which was beneficial by meeting
there,'' said the Rev. H.G.D. Dodge of St. Francis. ``It was a
spiritual atmosphere and it gave us a chance to share with another
congregation.''
   Dodge said he had been trying to rent a movie theater or
auditorium during the renovation when Trinity unexpectedly offered
to share its space for free.
   ``We were deeply touched and impressed,'' Dodge said.
   During the renovation, Episcopalians held their services each
Sunday at 8 a.m. and 10 a.m., and the Catholics followed at 11:30
a.m.

   Joseph Ross was a teen-ager when he dove into the
murky Charles River to rescue Maura Handren, 7, after she tumbled in
while accompanying him and a friend on a fishing outing.
   Ross, now 29, took the plunge again Sunday, when he and Maura,
now 22, were married.
   ``That's when Maura fell for Joey,'' said the bride's brother,
Stephen, of the incident 15 years ago.
   ``It was destiny,'' said the maid of honor, Karen Brady.
   Stephen was caring for Maura in 1974 when he and Ross, his best
friend, decided to go fishing and took her along. They handed her a
fishing pole to try her luck.
   When they looked again, her white sandals were floating on the
water, which was about 10 feet deep.
   ``There were bubbles coming up and all I could see was her
feet,'' said Ross, now a plumber at Babson College. He jumped in and
pulled her out.
   Ten years went by. When Handren was about to graduate from high
school, her brother suggested she ask Ross to the prom.
   ``It was her first date and they've been together ever since,''
said Brady. ``She has always had a crush on him.''
   ``When they fight, Joey'll tell her he should have left her in
the Charles,'' said Stephen.

   The United States has withdrawn a second AWACS
radar-surveillance plane from Saudi Arabia because of the cease-fire
in the Iran-Iraq war, the Pentagon said Monday.
   The withdrawal of the huge early-warning plane earlier this month
leaves two other such aircraft still in Saudi Arabia. The Saudis
have purchased five of the planes themselves, but the United States
deployed additional AWACS during the height of fighting in the
Persian Gulf two years ago.
   The U.S. planes, in cooperation with the Saudi aircraft, flew
surveillance missions over the gulf 24 hours a day while U.S. Navy
ships were escorting oil tankers.
   The Iran-Iraq cease-fire took effect in August and, while little
progress has been made on a peace treaty, both sides continue to
respect the truce. As a result, the United States also has begun
withdrawing some of its naval force in the region.
   The Pentagon withdrew its first AWACS plane in January. Officials
declined to estimate when the remaining two might be pulled out.

<HEAD>Iran Asks Return of 700 POWs; Calls Iraqi Proposal `Propaganda'</HEAD>

   Iran on Monday said an Iraqi proposal to
exchange all prisoners of war is a propaganda ploy and insisted on
the return of more than 700 Iranians that Tehran says were captured
since an August truce.
   On March 5, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein proposed the exchange
of all 100,000 prisoners held by both sides outside the framework of
the peace talks, which have been deadlocked since they opened in
Geneva on Aug. 25.
   In a letter to the International Committee of the Red Cross,
released Monday at U.N. headquarters, Iran noted that it had
informed the Red Cross that Iraq seized over 700 Iranians, mostly
soldiers, in the first weeks after the truce in the Iran-Iraq war
began Aug. 20.
   The eight years of fighting came to an end after both sides
agreed to negotiations that use U.N. Resolution 598 as a blueprint
for a permanent peace settlement. Among other things, the resolution
calls for withdrawal of occupying forces and prisoner exchanges.
   Tehran said the detention of the Iranians violates the Third
Geneva Convention regulating the treatment of POWs, and it called on
the Red Cross to pressure Iraq to release them.
   ``It is worth noting that during the first round of negotiations
in Geneva for the implementation of Resolution 598, the foreign
minister of Iraq announced the said prisoners would be released
soon,'' Iran's letter said, referring to the U.N. Security Council's
peace plan.
   ``It is now clear that the Iraqi foreign minister's promise was
made only for propaganda purposes at the time, which, like all other
Iraqi statements of repatriation of prisoners of war are void of any
humanitarian substance,'' said the Iranian letter.
   The Red Cross has registered 50,182 prisoners held by Iran and
19,284 held by Iraq, but U.N. officials and diplomats estimate the
total number of POWs is about 100,000.
   An agreement to exchange sick and injured prisoners of war in
November broke down over mutual recriminations of bad faith,
including the numbers of prisoners requesting asylum on both sides.

   Show biz folks are on the move. Actress Carol
Burnett is scrapping her ocean-view for inland digs, and actor Mel
Gibson has bought a Malibu hideaway to use when he's away from his
native Australia.
   Miss Burnett takes a profit of nearly $1.5 million in her move
from the gated Cape Cod-style home in Pacific Palisades to a luxury
condominium in Century City, near Beverly Hills.
   The 5,500-square-foot condo cost about $2 million. She reportedly
sold the two-story ocean-view home for slightly more than its $2.45
million asking price after paying about $1.1 million for the
five-bedroom, five-bath home in 1985.
   Gibson, star of the ``Mad Max'' movie series and the recent
``Tequila Sunrise,'' reportedly paid almost $3 million for his new
three-bedroom, four-bath Malibu home, previously owned by soap
star-pop singer Rick Springfield.
   Gibson and wife Barbara are said to have already moved into the
Mediterranean-style home featuring two fireplaces and a pool.

   Former Oak Ridge Boys baritone William
Lee Golden, known for his long beard and buckskins, plans to try his
hand at acting.
   ``I've had a couple of opportunities to go out to California for
some readings with casting directors,'' Golden said. ``So I talked
with my management company. They said, `There are opportunities
coming up, take some acting classes.'''
   The 49-year-old singer, who was with the Oak Ridge Boys for 22
years before being ousted two years ago because members were having
trouble getting along, dropped a $40 million lawsuit against the
group in September.
   ``I love to sing, and when I'm not doing it, it's hard,'' said
Golden. ``Music has a certain healing power and helps release a lot
of emotions. It takes you to another place.''
   Golden now works with his sons, Rusty and Chris, who perform as
the Goldens.
   The Oak Ridge Boys' latest album, ``Manongahela'' is at the top
of the country music charts.

   Bob Hope, who has been zinging presidents and
other political elite for nearly half a century, got first dog
Millie into the act during an appearance here.
   Hope said the delivery of ``three pups at the White House would
give (Vice President) Dan Quayle something to play with.''
   ``Actually she delivered five but the Senate rejected two of
them,'' Hope said, referring to President Bush's family dog.
   Actually, Millie delivered six healthy puppies.
   Hope also made note of Bush's recent trip to Japan.
   ``Since he is president of the U.S., he wanted to meet the
owners,'' Hope said in his appearance Saturday at the Tropicana
Hotel.
   Hope, 85, also had a quip about errant golf drives by former
president Gerald Ford.
   ``My favorite foursome is Jerry Ford, myself, a paramedic and a
faith healer,'' Hope said.

   Whoopi Goldberg, Robin Williams and Billy
Crystal lead the team of funny people who raised more than $3.6
million in pledges for the homeless through Comic Relief III.
   The four-hour telethon was broadcast Saturday night on the HBO
cable network with a cast that also included Joe Piscopo, Garry
Shandling, Shelley Long, Bobcat Goldthwait and John Larroquette.
   Entertainers donated their time and HBO assumed all production
costs, allowing viewer donations to go directly to the non-profit
Comic Relief organization, officials said.
   The amount was nearly $1 million more than last year's donations,
said Comic Relief vice president Dennis Albaugh.
   The two previous Comic Relief shows amassed more than $5 million
to fund homeless relief efforts in nearly two dozen U.S. cities,
officials said.
   More than 150,000 homeless people receive aid from programs
funded by the donations, said Bob Zmuda, president of Comic Relief.
   The money has paid for a dental clinic in Albuquerque, N.M., a
mental-health care center in Nashville, Tenn., a mobile medical
clinic in Kansas City, Mo., and intensive outreach programs in New
York, San Diego and Milwaukee, he said.

   Margo Adams, who accused Wade Boggs of
breaking faith with her and sued the Boston Red Sox star for $12
million, has herself been accused of walking off with a coat that
wasn't hers.
   Ms. Adams was cited for petty theft, a misdeameanor, and released
on her own recognizance, said police Lt. Alan Kent.
   She was accused of shoplifting a $258 coat from Nordstrom
department store Sunday, Kent said.
   In January, Ms. Adams, 33, pleaded guilty to eight counts of
using a bank charge card that wasn't hers to run up $4,871 in
charges at the same department store and at other businesses. She
was ordered to make restitution and was placed on three years'
informal probation.
   Ms. Adams, a mortgage broker, is doing a nationwide tour to
promote a two-part article in Penthouse magazine telling of her
affair with Boggs.
   Ms. Adams claimed Boggs broke an oral contract to pay her for
lost wages and for financial services rendered during their
four-year relationship, which ended last spring. The accusations are
laid out in a lawsuit filed in Orange Count Superior Court last May.
   The 4th District Court of Appeal ruled last month that Ms. Adams
could not seek $11.5 million in punitive damages. She alleged Boggs
inflicted intentional emotional distress on her.
   That means Ms. Adams could sue Boggs only for $500,000 _ the
amount she claims he owes her for lost income and for her
professional services during road trips she took with him over four
baseball seasons.

<HEAD>Army to Evaluate its Night-Vision Goggles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army said Monday it will conduct a special
one-time evaluation of every night-vision goggle in its inventory to
ensure the devices are safe for use by aviators.
   The service, in a brief statement, said the evaluation would
involve about 12,700 of the devices and would require at least two
weeks and possibly more to complete.
   The evaluation will include not only the two models of night
vision goggles that are being used now, but also two other models
that were suspended from flight use a year ago when safety questions
began arising.
   Critics have questioned whether the goggles function properly
when used if there is no moon or in cloudy weather. According to
recent published reports, 37 of 41 Army helicopter crashes since
1978 in which night goggles were used occurred when there was not
enough moonlight for the devices to amplify.
   The most recent incident in which the use of night vision goggles
has been questioned occurred just a week ago on the night of March
12. A CH-3E helicopter assigned to the Air Force Reserve crashed
near Tucson, Ariz., while ferrying some soldiers to a training
range. Fifteen servicemen died in the accident.
   According to Capt. Carlos Roque, a spokesman at the Davis-Monthan
Air Force Base, where the helicopter was based, the crewmen on that
chopper were wearing goggles that night. But investigators have
determined the goggles were not a factor in the accident, Roque said.
   The evaluations will be conducted by experienced Army pilots and
will take about 20 minutes each, said Lt. Col. Greg Rixon, an Army
spokesman. They can be performed on the ground in a specially
lighted room.
   Rixon said the Army inspections are aimed at eliminating from the
stockpile any goggles that suffer from a distortion problem that was
identified some time ago. Inside the light-amplifying tubes of each
goggle, there is a built-in twist to an optical fiber line that can
produce distortion in the lens if not made properly, he explained.
   ``Every goggle that can be used for flight is going to be
evaluated,'' Rixon said. ``If there are no problems, the goggle is
cleared for use. If there is a problem, it takes about 45 minutes to
change the tube.''
   The spokesman said the cost of replacing the goggle tubes ranged
from $1,100 to $5,000, depending upon the model.

   An American military helicopter crashed
Monday during joint maneuvers with South Korean forces, killing 19
Marines and injuring 16, U.S. military authorities said.
   It was the second fatal American helicopter crash in South Korea
in four days. On Friday, all four Marines aboard were killed when a
CH-46 assigned to the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit based at Camp
Pendleton, Calif., crashed in a rice paddy on the east coast.
   On Monday, a CH53-D Sea Stallion carrying four crewmen and 30
other Marines crashed near the southeastern port of Pohang during
the joint exercises, a Marine Corps spokesman reported. He said the
injured included a Marine on the ground.
   Marine officials said investigators were at the site to determine
the cause of the crash, but no quick result was expected because
only charred pieces of the helicopter remained.
   The Marines were from the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines of the 1st
Marine Division based at Camp Pendleton. The helicopter was assigned
to the 1st Marine Air Wing based at Futenma Marine Corps Air Station
in Okinawa, Japan.
   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, quoted government officials
as saying the helicopter appeared to have engine trouble and
exploded in the air.
   A Seoul newspaper, Kookmin, quoted a witness as saying one of two
choppers hovering at about 250 feet suddenly turned upside down and
plunged into a creek. About 10 men jumped out as it struck the
ground, the report said.
   Both helicopters that crashed operated from the USS Belleau Wood,
a Marine assault ship participating in the annual ``Team Spirit''
exercises, which began Tuesday.
   Some of those injured Monday were taken to the Belleau Wood and
others were evacuated to a U.S. military hospital in Seoul. Marine
officials withheld the identities of the dead and wounded pending
notification of relatives.
   About 43,000 American soldiers are based in South Korea under a
mutual defense agreement and 30,000 have been brought in for the
maneuvers from the United States and elsewhere in Asia.
   This year's exercises involve about 200,000 military personnel
from both countries.
   Dissidents demand an end to the joint maneuvers on grounds they
increase tension on the divided peninsula and hamper talks with
communist North Korea on peace and reunification.
   Four people were injured Monday in a confrontation between police
and about 700 villagers demanding an end to U.S. bombing practice at
the Koon-Ni range near a coastal village about 70 miles southwest of
Seoul.
   Villagers have held several violent protests around Koon-Ni, the
only bombing range in South Korea for U.S. aircraft, demanding it be
closed. They complain of noise and of danger from the bombing.
   At one point, Yonhap reported, 72 villagers briefly occupied a
small island inside the range and burned targets. There were no
reports of arrests.

   Okinawa's worst water shortage in seven years has
forced officials to cut water supplies throughout the southern
Japanese prefecture for 24 hours every other day, officials said
Monday.
   Water in two reservoirs averaged only 11.5 percent of capacity,
while five reservoirs were averaging 44.6 percent of capacity, a
local government official said.
   An Okinawa weather bureau official said only 0.78 inches of rain
fell in the prefecture in February, or 17 percent of normal.
   U.S. military spokesman Jake Rodrigues declined to comment on
U.S. armed forces radio reports saying all non-official travel by
American troops to Okinawa was suspended until further notice
because of the water shortage.
   Of the 64,000 U.S. troops in Japan, about 35,000 are stationed in
Okinawa, which has a population of 1.2 million.
   A water shortage in 1981-82 forced a similar 24-hour water supply
cutoff for about six months.

   A Vermont town showed a markedly reduced drunken
driving rate after residents were taught to use an inexpensive
gadget to estimate their blood-alcohol levels, according to a study
that experts called promising.
   The town's rate of driving with hazardous blood-alcohol levels
was only about half that of a similar community that gave no
training, the study found.
   Although the small study could provide only preliminary evidence
that the program works, the results look encouraging, said co-author
John K. Worden of the University of Vermont College of Medicine.
   He and colleagues from the university and state government
present the work in this month's issue of the American Journal of
Public Health.
   Experts said the results were promising, but that some questions
about effectiveness remain to be answered. They also said such a
program should be considered only in combination with other
strategies to reduce drunken driving.
   The study involved three Vermont communities which Worden
declined to identify, two with populations of about 5,000 and the
third approaching 12,000. They were similar in terms of education
level, household income and the proportion of males among residents
aged 16 to 29.
   In one community, an education program featured wallet-sized
cards and small cardboard dials for estimating one's own
blood-alcohol concentration according to body weight and the number
of drinks consumed. About 3,000 dials were handed out in bars,
stores, restaurants and filling stations.
   Customers were trained to use the dials at those outlets and in
television announcements broadcast about 20 times a week. Worden
stressed that training at the outlets was important because it
ensured ``a lot of conversation about the program.''
   A second town was exposed only to the television announcements,
which mentioned a couple of local outlets for the dials. No training
was provided at those outlets.
   The third town received no portion of the program.
   Six months after the program began, police stopped all traffic on
six weekend nights in the three communities. Blood-alcohol
concentrations were measured in 333 drivers from the community that
had no part of the program, 405 from the town with only the
television announcements, and 154 from the community with the full
program.
   Analysis found that 11.1 percent of drivers from the town with no
intervention had concentrations of at least 0.05 percent, the level
at which the dial warned that driving becomes impaired.
   In the television-only community, 10.1 percent of drivers also
reached that level. But only 5.8 percent of drivers from the
full-program community scored that high.
   The legal driving limit of 0.1 percent blood alcohol was reached
by 3 percent of drivers from the no-program community and 4.7
percent from the television-only community, but only 0.6 percent
from the full-program community.
   Philip Graitcer, of the federal Centers for Disease Control's
division of injury epidemiology and control, cautioned that
questions remain about how effective such a program would be over a
longer period, whether it would work in other settings, and whether
it would in fact reduce accidents.
   Still, the relatively inexpensive program offers ``a strategy
that may work,'' he said.
   James F. Mosher, program director at the Marin Institute for the
Prevention of Alcohol and Other Drug Problems in San Rafael, Calif.,
said the program would be best used in combination with other
efforts, such as training bartenders and waiters to regulate
drinking among patrons.
   Such a package of strategies could also include increasing the
excise tax on alcoholic beverages and using local laws to decrease
risk of drunken driving, said Alex Wagenaar, head of the injury
analysis and prevention group at the University of Michigan
Transportation Research Institute in Ann Arbor.

<HEAD>Roh Puts Off Referendum, Dissidents Vow Fight</HEAD>

   Dissidents said Monday they will fight
on to oust President Roh Tae-woo, who indefinitely postponed a
promised national referendum on his performance.
   Hundreds of students threw dozens of firebombs into two police
stations in the southern city of Kwangj, shouting ``Punish Roh
Tae-woo!'' according to the South Korean news agency Yonhap.
   The attack destroyed a police motorcycle and caused other
extensive damage, Yonhap said. There were no immediate reports of
injuries and arrests.
   Yonhap said the students also shouted slogans demanding an end to
annual ``Team Sprit'' exercises involving 200,000 South Korean and
U.S. soldiers.
   The attack came after police sneaked into Chosun University in
Kwangju and removed wall posters denouncing the exercises, Yonhap
said. Dissidents have accused the exercises of heightening tension
on the divided Korean peninsula and hampering unification with
communist North Korea.
   Roh has introduced broad democratic reforms since winning office
in late 1987, but many South Koreans distrust the government because
of its ties to the authoritarian regime of former President Chun
Doo-hwan.
   South Korea's main dissident alliance, the United National
Democratic Movement, urged Roh to stop ``fooling the people'' with
the referendum issue and said the alliance will push for Roh's
resignation.
   Roh postponed the midterm referendum he had promised during the
1987 election campaign, accusing anti-government forces of trying to
use the vote to organize violent protests and topple the government.
   The vote was expected to be scheduled for mid-April.
   ``Violent leftist forces are trying to overthrow the
government,'' Roh said in a nationally televised address Monday.
``Leftist forces are trying to use the midterm appraisal as a
foothold for overthrowing the free democratic system.''
   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
Roh was not legally required to call the vote.
   ``His decision is outside the normal constitutional requirements,
in the sense that this is a referendum that he proposed himself. We
certainly want to see a democratic process followed but at this
point we don't have any comment'' on the postponing of the
referendum, Fitzwater said.
   The dissident alliance charged Roh wants to delay the referendum
by recognizing his unpopularity. Some opposition and dissident
forces have demanded Roh stake his presidency on the referendum and
step down if defeated.
   It was not clear if Roh was backing away from the referendum
because of concern about potential unrest or because he feared the
government could not win the vote and might be forced into new
elections. Some government officials had expressed concern about
Roh's ability to win a referendum.
   The government had said earlier that Roh would not resign if he
was defeated, but some administration officials conceded a defeat
would put pressure on Roh to call elections.
   The main opposition parties said they accepted Roh's decision but
would watch to ensure the government does not attempt to retreat on
any other promises to bring in full democracy.
   The Party of Peace and Democracy of Kim Dae-jung welcomed the
referendum delay. The Reunification Democratic Party of Kim
Young-sam said it would accept only a temporary delay.
   Kim Young-sam had been pushing for a referendum after predicting
Roh would lose. Kim Dae-jung opposed a referendum, apparently
because Kim Young-sam's party had overtaken his in opinion polls.
   The Kims are bitter rivals who split the opposition vote in the
December 1987 elections, allowing Roh to win with 36 percent of the
vote. Roh promised during the election campaign to hold a referendum
after his first year in office to give voters a chance to evaluate
his performance.

<HEAD>Urban Folk Traditions Saved by New York's City Lore</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At first glance, Puerto Rican mountain music,
break dancing, and the house under the roller coaster at Coney
Island don't have a lot in common.
   But to Steven Zeitlin, director of City Lore, all three pieces of
the city's folk culture are worth preserving.
   City Lore documents and promotes ethnic traditions and
neighborhood pastimes _ what Zeitlin calls ``the artistic genius of
the average person.''
   ``New York has always been regarded as the cultural capital
because of the opera and the ballet and things like that,'' he said.
``We say, it's also the cultural capital because of the enormous
diversity of the population.''
   Artists showcased by City Lore range from Afghan immigrants
making rugs to women from Senegal braiding hair in traditional,
elaborate designs. The Afghans live in Brooklyn; the Senegalese, in
Harlem.
   ``By presenting these art forms at our annual summer festival in
Central Park, in museums, at concerts, in the schools, we give these
people a reason to keep their art form going,'' said Zeitlin.
   ``It's not something they have to give up to become American.''
   Other artists featured by City Lore have included Papa Manteo, a
Staten Island puppeteer whose Sicilian marionettes enact the legend
of the ninth-century Roman Emperor Charlemagne, and Shenaz Hooda,
who uses crushed henna leaves to paint lacelike designs on the hands
of Muslim brides. If the dye left on the hands fades too quickly
during the first weeks of marriage, the husband is said to have
forced his wife to wash too many dishes. Hooda brought the tradition
from her native Bombay.
   City Lore tries to preserve the best of pop culture before it
gets repackaged by Madison Avenue and the media.
   ``There's so much pressure in New York for things to be
commercialized that something like rap music gets picked up
immediately and becomes a national phenomenon,'' said Zeitlin.
Neighborhood break dancers and rappers were featured at City Lore
events long before these genres became staples on the rock video
channel MTV.
   Musicians with roots in Puerto Rico, Cuba and other Latin
countries are given a forum in City Lore's Musica Tradicional
concert series, held each summer.
   City Lore, which started out 10 years ago, has a $300,000 annual
budget funded by private and government grants. Students, writers
and artists use the group's archives; folk artists come looking for
a place to perform and for help with grant applications.
Neighborhood storytellers are featured on City Lore's monthly radio
show on a public station.
   City Lore also is concerned with preserving the city's past. A
project is under way to compile an oral history of the men who built
the subway. And the organization is mounting an effort to save what
it calls ``Endangered Spaces'' _ sites like the old-fashioned
merchant stalls in the Essex Street Market and the house under the
roller coaster at Coney Island.
   Immortalized in Woody Allen's movie ``Annie Hall,'' the house is
in danger of being demolished. City Lore wants to save it, although
the woman who lives there, the widow of the man who ran the roller
coaster, ``was just as happy to move out,'' said Zeitlin.
   City Lore is hoping the house can be preserved in a form that
will please developers as well as Coney Island-lovers: a restaurant.

<TEXT>
   Six Israeli warplanes attacked a
Palestinian base near the Syrian border Monday, killing six
guerrillas and wounding nine people, including four civilians,
police reported.
   Artillery duels continued between Christian army units and Walid
Jumblatt's Druse militia, with many of the shells falling in
residential areas.
   Police spokesman said five people were killed, including an army
officer, and 15 wounded, four of them soldiers. That brought total
casualties since the artillery and tank battles began March 8 to 54
killed and 179 wounded, most of them civilians.
   The Israeli fighter-bombers struck a base of the pro-Syrian
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command in
Dalhamiyyeh, a neighborhood of Bar Elias town in the Bekaa Valley,
six miles west of the Syrian border.
   Most of the 40,000 Syrian troops stationed in Lebanon are based
in the Bekaa Valley.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing
rules, said the raiders destroyed the base and 10 nearby houses, and
Syrian soldiers cordoned off the area.
   Guerrillas of the radical Marxist Palestinian faction have
claimed responsibility for several recent guerrilla attempts to
infiltrate Israel. Soldiers killed two of the group's fighters March
12 in the ``security zone'' Israel maintains just inside south
Lebanon.
   Monday's raid was the fourth on Lebanon by Israeli planes this
year. Police say two people were killed and 34 wounded in the three
previous attacks.
   Police said the Druse and the forces of Gen. Michel Aoun, who
commands Lebanon's Christian army units, battled with tanks and
heavy artillery around Souk el-Gharb, an army garrison town 15 miles
southeast of Beirut.
   The spokesman said shells hit residential areas, the Christian
ports of Beirut and Jounieh and the airport highway in Moslem west
Beirut. Beirut's airport, the only one in Lebanon, has been closed
since March 11.
   Battles between Druse and army gunners began two days after Aoun,
who heads a Christian government vying for power with a Moslem
Cabinet, declared a blockade March 6 of private ports Lebanese
militias run to finance their operations.
   Christian gunners aimed barrages of 155mm howitzer fire at the
Shiite Moslem slums of south Beirut, where most of the 15 Western
hostages in Lebanon are believed held, and at the seaside suburbs
Khalde and Doha, the police spokesman said.
   He said Druse gunners bombarded Jounieh, 12 miles north of
Beirut; the Christian residential districts Hazmieh and Mekalless in
Beirut; and Metn province.
   An Arab League mediation committee resumed efforts Monday to
resolve the constitutional crisis, which has left Lebanon without a
president for six months.
   Kuwait's ambassador to Syria, Ahmed Jassem, drove to Beirut and
met with several Moslem leaders, including Premier Salim Hoss, who
leads the Moslem cabinet, and Hussein Husseini, the parliament
speaker.
   Jassem planned to meet with Christian leaders Tuesday. He said he
would invite former Lebanese presidents and prime ministers to meet
with the six-member committee March 25 at the league's headquarters
in Tunis.
   That would be the third stage in negotiations on the crisis
caused by Parliament's failure to elect a successor to President
Amin Gemayel, whose six-year term ended Sept. 22.
   Before stepping down, Gemayel appointed Aoun, a Maronite
Catholic, to lead an interim military Cabinet. Moslems refused to
accept the appointment and remained loyal to Hoss, who was premier
during the Gemayel presidency.
   By tradition, Lebanon's president is Christian, the premier Sunni
Moslem and the parliament speaker Shiite.
   The Arab League mediation effort has been complicated by the
fighting between Christian army units and the Druse. It is the most
serious sectarian warfare since 1985 in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil
war.
   Aoun demands that Syria, which has become Lebanon's main power
broker, withdraw all its troops, but Jumblatt and other Moslem
leaders reject the demand.

session Monday with a somber speech on China's economic crisis that
stressed centralized control and the need to halt political reforms.
   China's senior leader, 84-year-old Deng Xiaoping, did not attend
the session of the National People's Congress as he did last year. A
Foreign Affairs Ministry official said only that Deng ``asked for
leave.''
   Li's speech to the 2,768 legislators in the cavernous Great Hall
of the People marked the consolidation of a policy of economic and
political retrenchment that began in September.
   Whereas Congress last year called for democracy and bold attempts
to free China's economy from rigid central planning, Li's speech
called for control.
   ``Experience has proved time and again that without the necessary
centralization and unity, without strict organization and
discipline, it would be absolutely impossible to readjust the
economy and overcome difficulties,'' he said.
   Li also appeared to level veiled but pointed criticism at
Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, who as premier in 1987 launched
China on an ambitious reform program.
   Silent for most of the 130-minute speech, the delegates erupted
in applause six times near its end when Li turned from the troubled
economy to issues at the heart of Chinese nationalism: Tibet and
foreign affairs.
   Any support for the independence of Tibet, Li said in reference
to recent bloody riots in Lhasa, ``constitutes an outrageous
interference in China's internal affairs and will absolutely not be
tolerated.''
   He also warned the United States to ``refrain from interfering
with China's internal affairs ... lest the existing friendly
relations between the two countries be impaired.''
   The U.S. Senate and State Department have expressed concern over
the violent suppression of Lhasa riots in which at least 16 people
were killed this month.
   Most of the speech, however, focused on China's troubled domestic
situation. Li read slowly, in a low monotone, pausing often to clear
his throat.
   China faces a record 36 percent inflation that has sparked panic
buying and bank runs. Rising crime affects its cities and corruption
sullies the halls of government.
   Much of the troubles have been blamed on inflation. In
September,China began a program to tackle price rises by slowing
reforms designed to introduce elements of a market economy to the
state-run system.
   ``Both government and people should be mentally prepared for a
few years of austerity,'' Li warned.
   Price reform, construction projects, loans, industrial growth and
consumer demand all should be cut, he said.
   Even some productive projects ``should be stopped or suspended''
and necessary construction projects ``follow an order of importance
and urgency.''
   Only education and agriculture would be spared, Li said.
   To halt a four-year slide in grain production, the state will
raise its grain purchase price by 18 percent on April 1, he said.
And banks will increase agricultural loans.
   He also announced a 15 percent increase in the education budget,
to $10 billion.
   Both sectors are considered key to development and critics say
they have been overlooked in recent budgets.
   Li appeared to blame party leader Zhao for inflation _ the root
of China's trouble.
   Zhao backed a full-steam-ahead approach to reforms when he was
premier in 1987, while Li was more cautious. At one point, Zhao said
the only criterion for whether reforms were successful was whether
they raised production.
   Li's speech roundly criticized this.
   ``We were too optimistic in our assessment of the economic
situation in 1987,'' he said. ``Instead of taking effective measures
... we relaxed control over and readjusted the prices of more
commodities only to intensify the panic of the masses over the price
hikes and evoke a buying spree.''
   The premier ignored a growing public clamor among intellectuals
for greater freedom of speech, evidenced by a recent call for an
amnesty for political prisoners.
   Instead, he said, all dialogue must take place ``under the
leadership of the Communist Party.''
   Li also said the economic troubles made it necessary to postpone
temporarily political reforms that would give more decision-making
power to businesses previously run by the state. Also, overstaffed
governments were to be cut back and a civil service system
introduced.
   The congress is meeting through April 4.
   Two important laws are expected to pass. One will give citizens
the right to sue the government. The other outlines the powers of
the congress, which does little but routinely endorse policy
directed by the Communist Party.

<HEAD>Judge Temporarily Bars DC Curfew as Unfair to Teen-agers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge, turning aside a plea for
``desperate measures'' against drug-related violence in the nation's
capital, on Monday temporarily barred the city from enforcing a
curfew aimed at keeping most teen-agers away from open-air drug
markets late at night.
   U.S. District Judge Charles B. Richey, in issuing a 10-day
temporary restraining order, ruled that the overnight curfew law
could unfairly penalize thousands of youths and result in
``permanent and irreparable injury'' to those detained unfairly
under the anti-drug trafficking statute.
   His ruling came despite an argument by district officials that
the city's record murder rate required immediate action.
   ``These are desperate times, and they require what may well be
considered desperate measures,'' argued Robin Alexander-Smith,
assistant corporation counsel. ``You see it on TV every night _ the
criminal element has taken over the streets ... and is seducing the
children.''
   The district has recorded 119 homicides this year, up from 73 for
the same period last year. For all of 1988, there were 372
homicides, an all-time high.
   The District of Columbia Council last week passed an emergency
law banning teen-agers under the age of 18 from gathering on city
streets after 11 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and after midnight
Friday and Saturday. The curfew would have ended at 6 a.m. each day.
It was designed to keep young people from buying or selling drugs on
city street corners or open-air drug markets.
   Enforcement was scheduled to begin Monday night, even though
Mayor Marion Barry Jr. and Corporation Counsel Fred Cooke
acknowledged that the plan might violate constitutional guarantees
of freedom of assembly and privacy rights.
   ``To enact a law that raises serious constitutional questions
when (city officials) know themselves it will not work ... gives me
chills,'' the judge said.
   Cooke also had said the bill might not slow the pace of
drug-related shootings, since police statistics indicate that the
average ages of murder victims and perpetrators in the nation's
capital are both over 30.
   The American Civil Liberties Union asked that the curfew be ruled
unconstitutional, claiming that it unfairly prevented thousands of
city teens from attending church, school or other legitimate
functions late at night.
   ``This curfew was a reaction to this problem, not a solution,''
said Arthur Spitzer, legal director for the ACLU's National Capital
chapter. ``It will hardly deter a teen-ager bent on committing a
crime. It will deter law-abiding teen-agers from going about their
business.''
   Richey said he was also worried that those detained while waiting
for a bus or coming home from a school play would have what amounted
to a police record that could harm their future employment or
educational prospects.
   A police enforcement order indicated that those detained would
not formally be charged, but still would have their fingerprints
taken and their names entered into a permanent police data bank.
   ``Once those names get in there, how do you get them out?''
Richey asked.
   Barry, anticipating legal opposition to the plan, last week
drafted an alternative bill. Richey ruled that he might extend the
restraining order indefinitely if Barry's alternative bill is not
satisfactory.
   Barry's bill includes a broad range of exemptions from the
curfew, including starting the curfew at 11:45 p.m. to allow
teen-agers time to return home from social events.
   In addition, it includes a blanket exemption for those returning
from school or church functions and those traveling with parents or
guardians.
   Barry's bill also attempts to resolve a conflict with
constitutional freedom of assembly guarantees by allowing for
teen-agers to gather on city streets during curfew hours for
protests or forums, provided that police officials have been
notified first.
   Both bills penalize parents, not the teen-agers. Starting with
the second offense, parents would be forced to pay a series of
graduated fines ranging from $200 to $500.

   Astronaut Robert C. Springer had hoped
something might go wrong on the five-day voyage of Discovery so he
could leave the space shuttle to fix it, his mother says.
   ``Bob was hoping for just some little problem so he could take a
space walk,'' Betty Springer said Sunday from her son's home in
Seabrook, Texas.
   Instead, the flight was almost perfect, which suited Mrs. Spring
fine.
   The only problem concerned an erratic pressure reading from a
hydrogen tank that helps supply electricity to the orbiter. The
astronauts conserved electricity for a day until ground controllers
corrected the difficulty.
   Mrs. Springer and her husband, Walter, watched the shuttle take
off in Cape Canaveral, then went to Houston and watched on TV the
landing Saturday.
   Springer, a 46-year-old mission specialist aboard the shuttle,
returned to his home in the Houston suburbs after the landing.
   ``It still seems like a dream, but he really liked his trip up
into space,'' his mother said.
   Springer was born in Ashland, Ohio, where his parents still live.

<TEXT>
   The latest polls show voters favor a
left-of-center coalition over Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative
government, and a Cabinet shakeup is in the works to arrest his
party's tumble in popularity.
   Kohl is on his annual slimming down cure at a spa in Austria, but
he announced before his departure from the capital on Friday that he
would spend his two-week Easter break considering changes in his
coalition government.
   In his absence, West German media and prominent politicians have
been speculating on the impending reorganization and some want the
embattled chancellor to cut down his own portfolio by resigning as
party leader.
   An atmosphere of political crisis has marred Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union for more than a week and called into question
whether the CDU can stay in power after the next federal balloting
in December 1990.
   The prospect of a liberal coalition governing in Bonn portends a
major policy shift in West Germany, an important U.S. ally, where a
leftist and pacifist trend has been gaining ground for more than a
year.
   Major newspapers on Monday continued to give the political
turmoil top priority, as they did over the weekend when new opinion
polls were released showing a further slide in support for Kohl's
CDU and the centrist Free Democratic Party with which it is aligned.
   A survey conducted by the respected Emnid Institute indicates
more interest among West Germans for an alliance between the liberal
Social Democrats and the environmentalist Greens party. The
Hamburg-based weekly Welt am Sonntag reported the poll shows a
majority of voters would back a liberal alliance, but it did not
provide specific figures.

   A poll of 1,018 West Germans conducted by the Voter Research
Group of Mannheim showed only 30 percent support Kohl's policies.
When the same questions were put to respondents a year ago, 83
percent supported Kohl, according to the ZDF television network that
commissioned the poll.
   Both opinion surveys showed the CDU trailing the Social
Democrats, as have similar polls over the past month.

   Kohl's popularity and that of the CDU have suffered from a
scandal over West German companies' involvement with a Libyan
chemical weapons plant and Bonn's foot-dragging over whether to
support NATO plans to replace some aging Lance missiles with
longer-range rockets.
   Domestic issues, such as the unpopular reform that made health
care more expensive, have also contributed to CDU troubles.
   The CDU's problems have rubbed off on its coalition partner, the
Free Democrats, who have also been losing ground in recent elections
and opinion polls.
   The Christian Democrats have been losing ground in state
elections since Kohl was re-elected in 1987, most recently in Hesse
state balloting where the party lost control of the Frankfurt city
government and other important industrial centers.
   The Hesse setbacks followed a surprising loss Jan. 29 in
elections to the Berlin legislature in which the left and far right
posted gains. The city-state that had been controlled by the CDU for
more than a decade is now being governed by a coalition of Social
Democrats and an umbrella group of leftists known as the Alternative
List.
   In an effort to invigorate the CDU and boost its appeal to
voters, Kohl is weighing calls from his party and the Free Democrats
to cast off unpopular Cabinet members like Defense Minister Rupert
Scholz and Health Minister Ursula Lehr.

<HEAD>Commerce Department Says China Dumps Imports of Headwear</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department said Monday it has made
a final determination that hats, caps and visors from China are
being sold in the United States at less than fair-market value.
   As a result of the finding, cash deposits or bonds will be
imposed on the imported headwear, which include items made from
certain natural and man-made fibers but not hats made of straw, felt
or wool.
   If the U.S. International Trade Commission finds that the
low-priced imports harm U.S. industry, Commerce will instruct the
Customs Service to collect the final anti-dumping duties. The ITC
has 45 days to make a ruling.
   The Commerce Department began its investigation after the
Headwear Institute of America filed a petition on behalf of the U.S.
industry. Imports of headwear from China in 1987 were valued at
about $40 million.

<TEXT>
   A judge Monday ordered the release of Randall Dale
Adams, who was imprisoned for 12 years for the slaying of a police
officer but whose guilt was questioned in the film ``The Thin Blue
Line.''
   Adams was ordered released on a $50,000 personal recognizance
bond, and he was expected to be freed later in the day.
   Adams served 12 years in a Texas prison for the 1976 slaying of
Dallas police Officer Robert Wood. Originally sentenced to death,
Adams' sentence was commuted to life in 1980.
   His conviction was unanimously overturned by the Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals March 1.
   The appeals court reviewed the case on the recommendation of
state District Judge Larry Baraka of Dallas, who said after a
hearing in December that Adams did not receive a fair trial.
   Baraka ordered Adams released on bond, but he refused a motion by
Adams' attorney, Randy Schaffer of Houston, to dismiss the
indictment.
   Prosecutors did not appear for the bond hearing Monday afternoon.
The Dallas County District Attorney has not made a decision whether
to retry Adams.
   Adams' case was resurrected with the help of New York filmmaker
Errol Morris, whose documentary ``The Thin Blue Line'' strongly
suggested the slaying was committed by the prosecution's chief
witness, David Harris. Harris, who is on death row for another
slaying, was not charged in the shooting of Wood.

<HEAD>Court Urged to Overturn Award Against Ohio Paper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court was urged Monday to overturn
a $200,000 libel award against a Hamilton, Ohio, newspaper.
   A federal appeals court ruling that upheld the award makes ``a
mirage'' of the required appellate court review of libel lawsuits
won by public figures, the justices were told.
   ``The central difficulty of the court of appeals ruling is that
it eviscerates the rule of independent review,'' argued Lee Levine,
a Washington lawyer for The Hamilton Journal-News.
   The award was won by Daniel Connaughton, a Hamilton lawyer who
unsuccessfully ran for the office of municipal judge in a 1983
election against incumbent James H. Dolan.
   John A. Lloyd of Cincinnati, a lawyer representing Connaughton,
urged the justices to uphold his client's legal victory.
   ``His evidence was massive, his cause was just,'' Lloyd contended
after accusing the newspaper of writing falsehoods about Connaughton
with ``perverse, premeditated ignorance.''
   The court's decision, expected by July, could supply important
new guidelines about how closely appeals courts must scrutinize jury
findings of ``actual malice'' when a public figure sues for libel.
   About five weeks before the municipal judge election, Connaughton
filed a private criminal complaint with Hamilton police based on
corruption allegations against Billy New, then the municipal court's
chief administrative officer.
   Connaughton told police that two women claimed to have paid
bribes to New to ``fix'' cases, and that one of the women said some
of the transactions had occurred in Dolan's presence.
   New eventually was convicted of bribery. Dolan was not indicted.
   Connaughton's campaign contended that Dolan bore the ultimate
responsibility for ``any failure to manage the court or its
employees.''
   A Nov. 1, 1983, article in the Journal-News said one of the women
who offered grand jury testimony against New ``claims Dan
Connaughton offered her and her sister jobs and a trip to Florida
`in appreciation' for their help.''
   The article quoted the woman as saying she thought Connaughton
used ``dirty tricks'' in obtaining her cooperation with his
investigation of New.
   Connaughton sued Harte-Hanks Communications, the newspaper's
publisher, for libel. A federal jury awarded him $5,000 in
compensatory damages and $195,000 in punitive damages.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the award last year,
rejecting the newspaper's arguments that a 1984 Supreme Court
decision required a reversal of the verdict.
   In a case called Bose vs. Consumers Union, the nation's highest
court in 1984 said appeals courts have broad authority _ and a
constitutionally required obligation _ to second-guess trial courts
in libel cases filed by public figures.
   To win a libel suit, a public figure must prove the allegedly
libelous statement was false and was made with ``actual malice'' _
knowledge or reckless disregard of its falsity.
   In the 1984 ruling, the justices said appeals court judges ``must
independently decide whether the evidence in the record is
sufficient to cross a constitutional threshold that bars the entry
of any (libel) judgment that is not supported by clear and
convincing proof of actual malice.''
   In Connaughton's case, the 6th Circuit court said the 1984 call
for independent review does not apply to a case's facts but instead
``was limited to a review of the ultimate conclusion of clear and
convincing proof of actual malice.''
   Attacking that ruling Monday, Levine argued for the Hamilton
paper that the 6th Circuit ``erected a presumption of actual malice
in every case.''
   But Lloyd contended that if the justices reverse Connaughton's
victory they would be erecting ``a rule of absolute immunity'' for
the news media against libel suits by public figures.
   He said a decision favoring the Hamilton Journal-News would
``send a signal'' to other defamed public figures ``to give up.''
   The case is Harte-Hanks vs. Connaughton, 88-10.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fidel Chavez Mena, the Christian
Democratic presidential candidate, today acknowledged the victory of
right-wing Arena candidate Alfredo Cristiani in the presidential
election.
   ``As a democratic party, we recognize the victory of Alfredo
Cristiani with more than 50 percent of the vote,'' Chavez Mena told
a news conference. ``I have called him personally to congratulate
him and express my desire that God illuminate him in governing the
country.''
   Cristiani, a wealthy coffee grower, said Sunday night his party's
unofficial tally showed him leading with 54 percent of the vote with
about 75 percent of the ballots counted.
   Leftists rebels tried to thwart the voting with nationwide
attacks, and the military said six soldiers and 23 guerrillas died
in clashes during the balloting. Security forces killed three
journalists _ two Salvadorans and a Dutchman.
   The guerrillas today lifted the road transport ban that paralyzed
traffic for four days, but rebels sabotaged communications and power
lines, slowing the vote count.
   ``We are sure and we proclaim ourselves the victors,'' said
Roberto D'Aubuisson, founder of the party known as Arena.
   Jorge Alberto Diaz, an Arena delegate to the Central Elections
Council, said that unofficially, Cristiani received 54.96 percent of
131,832 votes counted by early today.
   Chavez Mena, a 49-year-old lawyer, was running second with 34.48
percent of votes counted, with Moran Castaneda of the conservative
National Conciliation Party third at 4.68 percent, said Diaz. He
told reporters he was speaking as the Arena delegate and not for the
Elections Council.
   Diaz did not say how many people voted or explain how the figures
were obtained. Earlier today, he said the results were delayed
because local officials had trouble reporting results by telephone.
   A Cristiani victory would leave Washington supporting a
government run by a party long associated with extremism. In
elections last March, Arena wrested control of the National Assembly
from the Christian Democrats.
   The rebels claimed a low voter turnout rendered the results
meaningless.
   Their Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front had called for a
boycott and mounted widespread attacks to keep voters at home,
although they promised not to attack those who went to the polls.
   Unofficial reports by a television station, the U.S. Embassy and
the leftist Democratic Convergence party indicated Arena gained the
majority needed to avoid a runoff.
   A team of 21 U.S. observers said the vote appeared to have been
fair, but one observer said violence frightened many people away.
   ``There is no question that the intimidation of the (rebels) is
working,'' said William Doherty, an AFL-CIO official on the team.
   Cristiani, 41, campaigned as a moderate. However, at his side
throughout the campaign was D'Aubuisson, a former army major accused
of links to right-wing death squads.
   The United States has sent $3.5 billion in military and economic
aid to the government during its 9-year-old war with the rebels that
has left 70,000 dead, mostly civilians.
   U.S. policy in El Salvador has been aimed at shoring up a
centrist government represented by the Christian Democrats and
President Jose Napoleon Duarte, who is dying of liver cancer and
leaves office June 1.
   Some U.S. lawmakers have said that if Arena wins, the United
States should re-evaluate its policy. Among the election observers
was Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., who said Congress will need to
debate whether to continue current levels of military and economic
aid.
   ``The United States must recognize the will of Salvadorans,''
Cristiani said in a television interview Sunday night. He said he
saw no reason ``we can't have a relationship of mutual
understanding.''
   U.S. Ambassador William Walker said a victory for Arena would not
signify a defeat for American policy.
   ``U.S. policy here was not to project an image of being in
support of a party or a candidate,'' he told ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' from San Salvador. ``Whatever party wins ... as long as
they're a democratic force, as long as they observe human rights in
this country, we don't care really whether they're right of center,
center or left of center.''
   Government forces and leftist guerrillas battled in 12 of the
country's 14 provinces on Sunday and combat prevented voting in four
of the nation's 262 municipalities. No voting had been planned in 19
others that were under rebel control.
   Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff,
said the armed forces ``repelled what was in reality a nationwide
offensive by the (rebels).''
   The Salvadoran Correspondents' Association, citing the deaths of
the three journalists covering the vote, accused the military of
intimidation.
   Ponce said a soldier was arrested in one of the killings and the
others were being investigated.
   Arena's campaign blamed the Christian Democrats for failing to
end the war and for a steady economic slide.
   Cristiani has said Arena will negotiate peace once the rebels put
down their arms. Otherwise, he has said, they can expect an
intensification of the stalemated war.
   Cristiani describes his economic policy as ``capitalism for the
masses.'' He is expected to return the national coffee company,
Incafe, to private hands and allow the return of private banks.
Incafe and the banks were nationalized as part of U.S.-backed Duarte
economic reforms.
   About 1.83 million people out of a population of 5 million were
eligible to vote.

   Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker is
in Cuba for talks on implementing the agreement under which Cuba
agreed to withdraw its forces from Angola, the State Department said
Monday.
   Crocker, who heads the State Department's Africa bureau, is
believed to be the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Cuba since
Ambassador Vernon Walters went there in March 1982.
   But State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Crocker's
talks there are limited strictly to the southwest African issue.
Crocker and a Soviet official are attending the talks as observers.
   The discussions are centered on resolving disputes relating to
the agreement signed last December by Cuba, South Africa and Angola.
   In addition to the phased withdrawal of the more than 50,000
Cuban troops in stages from Angola, the agreement calls for South
Africa to relinquish colonial control over Namibia.

ex-waiter leading an opposition onslaught.
   For Transport Secretary Paul Channon, son of a British brewing
heiress and an American social high-flyer, the Dec. 21 crash in
Scotland was the low point in an unprecedented string of rail, air
and sea disasters in the past two years.
   And from his departure for a vacation at his private villa in the
Caribbean on Dec. 23 through mounting charges the past five days
that he bungled bomb warnings, Channon has been under concerted
attack by John Prescott, a railman's son who is the opposition Labor
Party's transport spokesman.
   ``My response is one of contempt,'' Channon said over the
weekend. ``His behavior has been both callous and cynical. ... He is
exploiting the grief of the bereaved.''
   The latest furor began after a newspaper revealed last week that
Channon's department warned British airlines Nov. 22 of a
radio-cassette bomb, four days after the Federal Aviation Department
sent the same warning to U.S. airlines, including Pan Am.
   A detailed description and picture of the bomb dated Dec. 19 was
mailed ``in the new year'' by the Transport Department to British
airlines and U.S. airlines _ well after a bomb hidden in a
radio-cassette player brought down Flight 103 over the Scottish
village of Lockerbie, killing 270 people.
   Despite unattributable briefings from Conservative Party Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's aides that she still supports him,
Channon looks increasingly defensive as Prescott hammers home
charges of cavalier and secretive behavior.
   Channon has said the Dec. 19 warning was ``unimportant'' and that
he didn't tell Parliament about either warning because of the
continuing inquiry and because the FAA dealt with Pan Am.
   Said Prescott: ``This has all the signs of a cover-up once they
realized the bungle they had made of it all.''
   Channon and Prescott come from the extremes of mainstream British
political life.
   Prescott, 50, left school at age 15 to become a ship's waiter and
got to Parliament after battling through the ranks of the National
Union of Seamen.
   Channon, 54, is reputedly the richest member of the Thatcher
Cabinet. He was born to privilege and politics and an inherited
fortune as a member of the Guinness brewing family.
   His father, Sir Henry Channon, came from a rich Chicago family,
married into the Guinness family and became a member of Parliament.
   After Eton, an elite Guards regiment and Oxford, Channon was
elected to Parliament at the age of 23. He was then its then
youngest member, representing a safe Conservative Party district,
Southend West, that had been held by his father, and before that by
two other family members.
   However, it took Channon 27 years to get into the Cabinet.
   Mrs. Thatcher named him Trade and Industry Secretary in 1986 and,
in what was widely seen as a demotion, moved him to transport after
Britain's June 1987 general election.
   Channon's 22-year-old daughter, Olivia, an Oxford University
student, died of a drug overdose in 1986 after an around-the-clock
party at the university to celebrate final examinations.
   Three fellow undergraduates, including a cousin and another
Guinness heir, were charged with drug offenses _ raising a public
outcry over a drugs scandal among the children of privilege.
   Since then, Channon has been one of the most publicized members
of the 22-member Cabinet: announcing in slightly tentative, upper
class tones another inquiry into yet another disaster, his face
anxious and solemn at another scene of carnage.
   He took over transport during an inquiry into the March 1987
British ferry disaster off the Belgian port of Zeebrugge that killed
193 people and revealed lax safety procedures.
   Then followed a fire at London's King's Cross subway station that
killed 31 people in November 1987; the Pan Am disaster; a British
Midland jet crash onto a highway on Jan. 8, killing 37 people; and
three major rail accidents since December that killed 42 people.

   The $50,000 Bristol-Myers cancer research award
has gone to Peter K. Vogt of the University of Southern California
School of Medicine for his discovery of a cancer-causing gene that
regulates other growth-related genes, it was announced Monday.
   The identification of the gene is ``one of the most significant
discoveries in the last several years,'' said Philip Sharp, director
of the Center for Cancer Research at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
   Sharp chaired the selection committee that chose Vogt for the
annual award.
   Vogt has also discovered several other cancer genes and has made
important contributions to the study of virology, Bristol-Myers said.
   ``His is an astonishing record of sustained productivity,
unrelenting in its importance and impact,'' wrote J. Michael Bishop,
a noted cancer researcher, in support of Vogt's selection, the
company said.
   Vogt discovered the so-called jun cancer gene, which is partly
responsible for switching other genes on and off inside living cells.
   When the gene is altered, it may send defective signals to the
genes it governs, producing the abnormalities seen in cancer.
   Vogt is the author of more than 210 scientific papers and was
elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1980, the company
said.
   He was selected by a 14-member independent group of researchers
chaired by Sharp.

   Poison specialists on Monday demonstrated a new
child-resistant medicine cap they hope will solve the problem of
caps that are too difficult for the elderly to open.
   In ceremonies marking the opening of National Poison Prevention
Week, Anne Graham, the acting chairman of the Consumer Product
Safety Commission, noted that roughly half the accidental medical
poisonings of children under age 5 were from child-resistant
packages that had not been properly resecured or from non-child
resistance containers holding medicines originally packed in
child-resistant containers.
   Child poisonings have declined greatly with the advent of the
child-resistant caps, from 216 deaths of children under 5 in 1972 to
59 in 1986.
   Nonethess, Ms. Graham noted, studies show that 35 percent of the
medicines ingested in child-poisoning cases come from people not in
the immediate family, most frequently grandparents.
   Like the present mechanism, the new cap device has an inner and
outer cap that lock together when the outer cap is pressed down on
the inner cap.
   Unlike the present design, the inner and outer caps of the new
mechanism each has a small slot across part of a diameter. When the
slots are aligned, a spoon handle may be inserted into both to make
the two caps turn together, using the spoon as a lever, without
downward pressure on the outer cap.
   ``This is our first effort,'' said Robert Wygant, professor of
industrial engineering at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo,
at the news conference at the National Capital Poison Control Center
at Georgetown University Hospital. ``We have many other tests to
do.''
   Wygant developed the prototype cap from a design by Professor
Hugh Lockhart of Michigan State University.
   The design emerged from earlier work by Western Michigan
University, Michigan State University and the University of
Wisconsin.
   Wygant, who estimated that more than a billion caps are made for
medicine alone every year, said that among other problems to be
solved was the production of clear instructions and making the caps
easy to manufacture.
   Commission spokesmen said the commission plans to require use of
the caps, or something similar, once all the bugs are worked out.

   A British Airways Concorde jet with some
well-heeled passengers will make the first all-supersonic flight
around the world beginning April 1, the airline announced Monday.
   The three-week trip, covering 38,215 miles in a planned total
flying time of 35 hours and 1 minute, could set more than a dozen
world speed records, British Airways said. The average speed of the
supersonic jet will be 1,091.3 miles per hour.
   The trip will start April 1 in London and finish there April 23.
   The Concorde aircraft, part of British Airways' fleet, has been
chartered by Lorraine Travel Bureau Inc., a tour operator based in
Miami. The fare is $39,000 per person based on double occupancy or
$40,500 for a single passenger.
   The round-trip fare on normal Concorde flights, between New York
and London for example, is around $6,400.
   The fare for the special trip includes luxury hotels, meals and
sightseeing in most of the cities where the Concorde will stop on
its way around the world.
   Among some of the hotels that will be used on the trip are Las
Brisas Hotel in Acapulco, the Westin Mauna Kea Hotel in Hawaii, the
Tahiti Beachcomber Hotel on the South Pacific island and the Savoy
Hotel in London.
   The planned activities include a visit to a Hawaiian volcano and
a safari in Kenya. They will sample wines at a vineyard near Cape
Town, South Africa.
   ``It's super-luxurious all the way,'' company spokesman John
Lampl said. Most of the 100 passengers are Americans, he said.

<HEAD>Experts Studying Bones From Site Bundy Said Was Victim's Grave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPITOL REEF NATIONAL PARK, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bones found at a site
identified by serial killer Ted Bundy as the grave of one of his
victims have been sent to state forensic experts to determine if
they are human, police said Monday.
   The Wayne County Sheriff's Department said the bones, which
investigators believe may be those of 17-year-old Nancy Wilcox of
Holladay, were delivered by Highway Patrol troopers to the state
medical examiner's office in Salt Lake City.
   Testing of the bones, found Friday, should be finished Thursday
or Friday, Sheriff Kerry Ekker said.
   Bundy was executed Jan. 24 in Florida's electric chair. Before he
died, he told detectives he had killed more than 20 women, including
eight in Utah. Of the Utah victims, he identified only three, among
them Wilcox, who he said was buried near Capitol Reef National Park,
200 miles south of Salt Lake City.
   The bones were among remains found at three sites a mile east of
the park. Also found at one of the sites was a fragment of what
appeared to be a tan blouse.
   Bones at two of the sites were believed to be those of animals.
   Ekker noted that the bones sent to the crime lab were found
partially exposed, and that the site would not be further excavated
until the medical examiner's office completes testing.
   The other two women Bundy identified among his early has,
up to now, has been the choice of filmmakers. That seems kind of
ludicrous, since there's only two movies in 10 years where product
placement fees were paid,'' she said.
   Before the current James Bond arrangement, Philip Morris paid to
get one of its brand names on screen just once: $42,500 to get its
Marlboro cigarettes included in the movie ``Superman II,'' the
company told the subcommittee Luken heads.
   Liggett Group Inc. said it paid $30,000 to get its Eve brand in
the movie ``Supergirl.''
   In letters to Luken's subcommittee, the companies said their
Japanese advertising agency arranged the $350,000 deal to promote
the Lark brand. The agreement calls for the movie to include a scene
in which Agent 007 pulls out an explosive device disguised as a
package of Larks.
   The letters were in response to a request to all American tobacco
companies seeking a 10-year inventory of motion pictures in which
the companies paid to have their product or brand name featured.
   Luken heads the transportation and hazardous materials
subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The panel
has jurisdiction over the Federal Trade Commission, and therefore
advertising issues.

<HEAD>Thousands Living on Radiation-Contaminated Land</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Almost a quarter-million Soviets are living on land
so contaminated by the Chernobyl disaster that they must receive
special food supplies to avoid overexposure to radiation, the
newspaper Pravda said Monday.
   The Communist Party daily printed maps showing contaminated areas
of Byelorussia, the Ukraine and the Russian republic in response to
readers' complaints they still didn't have full information about
the level of contamination nearly three years after the accident.
   It was accompanied by a commentary by Pravda science editor V.
Gubarev, who criticized officials for trying to duck public concern
about the safety of nuclear power.
   ``Yes, it is impossible to get around using nuclear power
stations. However, why then are they proposed for heavily populated
or seismic zones?'' Gubarev asked. ``Why is the quality of
construction so low, and why does so much defective equipment arrive
at nuclear plants? And, finally, what is the source of this fear
before a public which rightly demands a wide debate of every
proposed nuclear power station?''
   Yuri Izrael, chairman of the State Committee for
Hydrometeorology, said with decontamination efforts and food brought
into the area, those on the lands contaminated by Cesium 137 can
live safely without exceeding radiation limits set by the government.
   Soviet officials began bringing food supplies into areas
surrounding the Chernobyl plant shortly after the accident, but they
had not previously said how many people were living in those areas.
   The publication came as Soviet officials again started to move
villagers who have continued to live in areas surrounding the plant
since the accident in April 1986 that killed at least 31 people.
   In February, scientists decided that 20 Byelorussian villages
must be evacuated because over a lifetime their residents would
receive an unacceptably high dose of radiation. Earlier this month,
officials announced that five villages in the Ukraine also would be
evacuated.
   In November, the Soviet government set a maxium lifetime dose of
35 rem (roetgen equivalent, man) for exposure to radiation. That
figure has a comfortable margin of safety built into it, Izrael said.
   Izrael said the area of the three republics where the current
level of radiation from both the environment and existing food
supplies would expose residents to more than 35 rem includes 4,000
square miles including about 640 settlements with 230,000 people.
   That includes 800 square miles in the Russian republic, 600
square miles in the Ukraine and 2,800 square miles in Byelorussia,
including 1,200 square miles in areas that have been evacuated.
   ``So far they have gone the route here of trying to guarantee
this population clean food and extra income,'' Izrael said.
   Izrael said studies showed that residents could remain safely as
long as they did not eat the food, especially meat and milk produced
in the area, which sharply increased the amount of radiation to
which they were exposed.
   He quoted the newspaper Sovietskaya Byelorussia as saying in a
study of the Gomel, Mogilev and Brest regions of the republic less
than 0.1 percent of the population had received an unacceptably high
level of radiation. As of last fall, there had been no cases of
radiation sickness, he said.
   Scientists are debating how many more cancer deaths might be
expected in the Soviet Union and Europe as a result of the Chernobyl
accident. In Poland, they have estimated there may be up to 200,000
deaths in the next 20 to 25 years from Chernobyl radiation.
   But Izrael said that long years of work were ahead to
decontaminate the region. ``Insufficiencies in this work must be
compensated by replacement with clean food (especially by bringing
in milk). In this case life and work is possible within the
framework of the acceptable levels established by the Soviet
Ministry of Health,'' he said.
   Izrael said that within the first days after the explosion and
fire at the Chernobyl plant's No. 4 reactor, the direction of the
wind made a complete circle and dropped radiation all around the
plant.
   The entire population living within 18{ miles of the plant, or
about 135,000 people, were evacuated and resettled.
   Since then, many Soviets have begun to speak out against nuclear
power. Citizens' protests or tougher standards imposed after the
Chernobyl accident have stopped several nuclear power plants. A
plant near Yerevan, Armenia, not far from the site of the Dec. 7
earthquake, was shut down Saturday.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Detectives whose partner was killed during a drug
raid lied so many times to try to bring the alleged murderer to
trial that they blew the case, defense lawyers argued Monday.
   Other lawyers say the admitted misconduct by police could also
call into question dozens of convictions in which the officers
participated.
   Defense attorneys and the prosecutor agreed during the Superior
Court hearing Monday that there was serious police misconduct in the
case against Albert Lewin, 33, accused of shooting the detective
Feb. 17, 1987.
   But the prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney Francis O'Meara,
argued that Lewin should stand trial because there is strong
evidence against him and because the police have ``come clean'' by
admitting they lied to obtain a search warrant and hid the identity
of potential witnesses.
   The three detectives, Carlos A. Luna, 32, Hugo Amate, 31, and
Paul Schroeder, 33, were suspended with pay while the attorney
general investigates possible perjury.
   Judge Charles M. Grabau dismissed the murder charge against Lewin
last month, but agreed to consider reinstating it after the
detectives filed affidavits last week admitting they previously lied.
   Grabau said he would rule next week whether Lewin can be tried
for the murder of Detective Sherman Griffiths.
   Defense attorney Max Stern argued that the case against Lewin is
weak and depends heavily on testimony from other potential suspects
who may be lying to protect themselves.
   Griffiths, 36, was killed by a bullet shot through a door that he
was trying to break down to execute a drug search warrant.
   By the time his partners got through the steel-reinforced door,
the third-floor apartment was empty. They rushed down a back
staircase and found Lewin and six other people in an apartment on
the first floor.
   Charges were later dropped against the others in return for
damaging testimony against Lewin.
   A weakness in the prosecution's case from the outset was that
Lewin did not match the search warrant's description of the cocaine
dealer police said occupied the apartment and presumably fired the
fatal shot.
   An informant named John tipped detectives that drugs were being
sold from the apartment by a 5-foot-6 inch Hispanic man, according
to the police application for the warrant. Lewin is 6-foot-2 and
Jamaican.
   After the judge ordered the detectives last year to bring the
informant into court, they said they couldn't find him.
   In throwing out the case last month, Grabau said he believed the
police had intentionally disobeyed his orders to produce the witness.
   But in a stunning turnaround last week, the detectives admitted
John did not exist.
   According to the affidavits, the information attributed to John
actually came from two other informants, identified in court only as
``Y'' and ``Z.''
   O'Meara said Monday the detectives created John to protect their
real informants.
   ``When the playing field is not level, when it's skewed, when
it's fixed, then the (court) system can't work,'' Stern said.
``That's what you have here.''
   Stern also said the detectives obtained at least 30 other
warrants and conducted drug raids using information attributed to
``John.''
   Martin Rosenthal, a staff member for the Massachusetts Committee
for Public Counsel Services, said Sunday that defense lawyers are
now examining many of those cases and are likely to file motions for
new trials.
   Where faulty warrants led to arrests and convictions, he said,
convicted dealers could go free under a rule that bars evidence
obtained through police misconduct.
   Harvey Silverglate, co-chairman of the 320-member Massachusetts
Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said the Lewin case has
revealed what many lawyers suspected all along.
   ``Anybody who practices criminal law here can tell you that we
have great skepticism about these warrants,'' Silverglate said.

   An ammonia tank exploded at a factory in Lithuania
on Monday, killing at least two people and injuring 41, state media
said.
   The blast released a cloud of gas into the air that was being
pushed eastward by the wind, but officials said it was unlikely that
any populated areas would have to be evacuated.
   A government commission was formed to investigate the cause of
the blast at the Azot factory in Ionava, about 45 miles northwest of
the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, the official Tass news agency
said. The tank contained about 7,000 cubic meters of ammonia.
   It took firefighters several hours to put out blazes that broke
out, and an unspecified number of people were evacuated near the
plant, Lithuania's Deputy Premier Y.L. Rusenko told Soviet
television.
   ``I think that the concentration will not be increased because
all the ammonium has practially been evaporated above Ionava,'' he
said.
   ``If it is necessary people will be evacuated in other regions,
if a cloud approaches and the concentration is high. But I think the
danger has passed,'' Rusenko said.
   Residents were warned about the explosion and the release of
ammonia by official radio after the late morning explosion, he said.
Without being specific, Tass said that security had been tightened.
   Residents of Lithuania and the other Soviet Baltic republics of
Latvia and Estonia are concerned about environmental damage caused
by the heavy concentration of industry in the almost 50 years since
they were absorbed into the Soviet Union.
   Many people blame the central government in Moscow for ordering
the heavy industrialization without showing concern for
environmental damage.

   Actor Carroll O'Connor underwent successful gall
bladder surgery Monday at Emory University Hospital, where he has
been recovering from a heart bypass performed March 11.
   Doctors discovered Saturday that the 64-year-old O'Connor was
suffering from an inflamed gall bladder, hospital spokeswoman Judy
Smith said Monday. She said the heart surgery was unrelated to the
gall bladder problem.
   ``He came through the surgery well,'' Ms. Smith said of Monday's
two-hour operation. She said the condition of his heart is excellent
and after a day in intensive care he will be transferred to a
private room.
   He should be released within 10 days, she said.
   O'Connor, best known as Archie Bunker in television's ``All in
the Family,'' was filming his current series, ``In the Heat of the
Night,'' in nearby Covington when he was hospitalized for heart
problems March 10. The bypass was performed the next day.

<TEXT>
   U.S. sales of farm products to Japan will reach
$8.2 billion to $8.3 billion this year, topping sales to Western
Europe for the first time, a federal official told Congress Monday.
   U.S. exports to the 12 countries of the European Economic
Community are expected to drop to $7.3 billion for the year ending
Sept. 30, said Administrator Thomas O. Kay of the Foreign
Agricultural Service. For all of Western Europe, which includes such
non-members of the community as Switzerland and Sweden, total U.S.
sales are expected to reach $7.8 billion.
   In the year that ended last Sept. 30, exports to the 12 EEC
countries reached $7.5 billion, against $7.3 billion to Japan.
   Kay, testifying at a hearing of the House Agriculture
subcommittee on Rural Development, said he agreed with the panel's
acting chairman, Rep. Daniel K. Akaka, D-Hawaii, that the biggest
gains for U.S. farm sales are coming from the Pacific countries.
   He noted that China is now the biggest importer of U.S. wheat,
and he predicted big increases in exports to South Korea, which are
rising to $2.5 billion this year from $2.3 billion.
   ``We are transferring our resources to that area _ that's where
the future lies,'' Kay said.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager at the Agriculture
Department, said this will be the last year in which South Korea
will get loans supported by the U.S. government to encourage its
purchases.
   Sims reported that in less than six months since Oct. 1, the
Agriculture Department has announced nearly $4.8 billion worth of
guaranteed loans to 23 countries, almost as much as in the 12
previous months.
   Kay said U.S. farmers ``love'' subsidies for sales abroad. The
program has increased their prices and reduced the surplus of farm
products, he explained.
   In testimony submitted to the subcommittee, Kay said total U.S.
exports this year are due to rise to $38 billion, up $2.7 billion
from 1988. He attributed the increase to higher prices because of
last summer's s drought. The volume of farm exports is due to drop
by 2 percent.

   Deng Xiaoping, China's 84-year-old leader, was
conspicuous by his absence from Friday's opening of the nation's
annual legislative session.
   As the National People's Congress opened, Western reporters
sitting in the balcony of the huge Great Hall of the People clutched
their binoculars and scanned the dais for the country's senior
statesman. They came up empty.
   An official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would say only
that Deng had ``asked for leave'' from the conference. Chen Yun,
another elderly leader who heads the Communist Party's Advisory
Committee, had done the same, she said.
   Deng attended the opening last year's opening session as a
delegate from Sichuan province. He sat between Communist Party chief
Zhao Ziyang and Premier Li Peng.
   This year, President Yang Shangkun took Deng's seat.
   No empty seats appeared to have been set aside for the man who
fathered China's current economic reforms in 1978. Two seats were
empty on the left side of the dais, not traditionally the places for
high-ranking officials.
   Although he remains the power behind party and state in China,
Deng officially only has charge of the military.
   As the People's Liberation Army does not report directly to the
National People's Congress, his presence at the meeting is not
mandatory.
   Still, Deng's absence and the reaction it created among members
of the Western press illustrates one of the difficulties of
understanding Chinese politics. Much here is done for effect, but
often it is difficult to tell what the desired effect is.
   Deng last was seen Friday when he greeted Thai Prime Minister
Chatichai Choonhavan in Beijing.
   He appeared spry and remarked that Chatichai had played golf with
Zhao the day before.
   ``I'm also a sportsman,'' Deng said. ``I play bridge.''

   It's easier to buy and register a handgun in
Illinois than to apply for a driver's license, two lawmakers said
Monday in proposing a package of laws to keep better track of
weapons and their owners.
   Residents now can obtain a Firearm Owner's Identification Card by
mail. The card is valid for five years and allows its possessor to
keep as many weapons of any kind as desired without reporting the
total number or serial numbers.
   Under the legislation proposed by Democratic state Sens. William
Marovitz and Phil Rock, owners would have to get separate ID cards
for each handgun, and fill out the applications at a local law
enforcement agency.
   The card would be good for three years, and applicants would have
to furnish more detailed personal history than currently required.
   Chicago police Supterintendent LeRoy Martin said Chicago's crime
rate dipped last year and said his force's confiscation of 14,000
weapons had a significant effect.
   ``Over 50 percent of the 14,000 can't be identified,'' he said.
``If we could trace them, it would make a big difference. We know
people are buying the guns and selling them or renting them to
gangs, and this would enable us to follow some of the weapons back
to the source.''
   James Zangrilli, a member of the National Rifle Association's
board of directors, objected to the legislation.
   Many states and localities have taken steps limiting gun sales or
possession in recent weeks. President Bush last week ordered a
temporary ban on imports of assault rifles.

   West German authorities Monday
warned businesses and public institutions that Soviet intelligence
has obtained passwords and codes to gain access into their computers.
   A statement by the Federal Criminal Office said the codes
apparently were passed to the Soviet KGB by three West German
``hackers'' arrested this month.
   The three are suspected of selling thousands of codes and
passwords from Western military and research computers to Soviet
intelligence agents.
   Police authorities investigating the case have determined that
the hackers allegedly planned to break into or succeeded in breaking
into many other computers, the statement said.
   ``The KGB is capable of gaining full access to computer data of
businesses and public institutions,'' it added.
   It said obtaining computer codes and passwords has become a ``new
type of espionage by the East.''
   When the three were arrested, authorities said they had cracked a
major spy ring and warned of a new dimension in Soviet-bloc
espionage.

<HEAD>Former Rep. Barnes Says Casey Tried to Discredit House Staffer</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds 6 grafs at end with North-congressmen meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Rep. Michael Barnes testified Monday
that former CIA Director William Casey tried to discredit a
congressional committee staff member at a time the panel was
investigating Oliver North's efforts on behalf of Nicaraguan rebels.
   ``He indicated that a member of my staff had met with a
representative of the Nicaraguan government,'' said Barnes, a
Maryland Democrat. The CIA, Barnes said, found out about the meeting
by intercepting a conversation between the Nicaraguan ambassador and
that country's foreign minister.
   Barnes identified the staff member as Victor Johnson, who was
staff director of the subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs. At
the time, in late 1985 when official aid to the Nicaraguan rebels
was forbidden by U.S. law, Barnes' subcommittee was trying to pry
information from the National Security Council on its activities.
   His voice rising, the former congressman strongly denied there
was anything wrong with Johnson's contact with the Nicaraguan
government.
   ``My memory of what Casey said is that a member of my staff had
met with a representative of the Nicaraguan government,'' said
Barnes. ``He told them if they were to improve the human rights
situation in their country, lifting martial law, restoring freedom
of the press ... such steps could be of help to members of Congress
trying to reject aid to the Contras.''
   ``Did he indicate to you the staff member gave classified
information?'' asked Brendan Sullivan, North's lawyer.
   ``No sir,'' Barnes said. ``I found the allegation he made
basically to be frivolous. He didn't allege a member of my staff was
passing classified information to the Nicaraguan government. On the
contrary, from what he told me, my staff was doing what it had
routinely done.
   ``I told him in my judgment, based on what he told me, that what
this individual had done was perfectly appropriate.''
   Casey died in early 1987.
   Barnes, who left his House seat to make an unsuccessful try for
the Senate in 1986, said after meeting with Casey he told the
chairman of the full Foreign Affairs committee about the
conversation and ``he agreed the meeting was appropriate.''
   The former Democratic congressman told Sullivan heatedly: ``There
was never any allegation that Victor Johnson or any other member of
my staff had provided classified information in any form to the
Nicaraguan government or any other government.''
   Barnes, one of the leaders against aid to the Contras, also
testified Monday that then-National Security Adviser Robert
McFarlane had seemed ``very nervous'' about the questions being
raised about North's activities.
   Barnes said he was dissatisfied with a Sept. 12, 1985, letter
from McFarlane denying that NSC staffers were raising money and
offering tactical advice to the guerrillas fighting the leftist
Nicaraguan government.
   They met in McFarlane's White House office and McFarlane offered
to let Barnes _ but no congressional staffers _ examine documents
relating to the Contras.
   North, who was on McFarlane's staff, is being tried on charges
that he obstructed Congress and made false statements in connection
with the Sept. 12 letter and two others written in 1985.
   ``Were you aware that North collaborated with Mr. McFarlane on
writing that letter?'' prosecutor Michael Bromwich asked. ``No,''
Barnes said.
   He said that in a later letter to McFarlane and in the
face-to-face meeting, he requested all documents relating to
communications between the United States government and the Contras.
   ``I felt that Mr. McFarlane was very concerned about our
investigation, very nervous about it,'' Barnes said.
   Barnes said he rejected McFarlane's offer to let him alone look
at the documents, saying it was always necessary in such cases to
have knowledgeable congressional staffers examine them.
   The next witness after Barnes, Thomas Latimer, staff director of
the House Intelligence Committee, testified about attempts by his
committee chairman in September 1986 to follow continuing reports
that the NSC was violating the prohibition against helping the
Contras.
   Latimer set up an Aug. 6 meeting between North and the committee
in the White House. North spoke for 40-45 minutes, he said, denying
again that he had violated the law.
   ``He was asked specifically if he had given any miitary advice to
the Contras,'' Latimer said. ``He said he had not. He was asked if
he was involved in any fund-raising. He said he had not.''
   One of the obstruction-of-Congress charges against North is based
on his answers at that meeting. Under the ground rules set by the
National Security Council, no transcript was made but the
prosecution introduced the notes that Latimer made at the time.
   They reflected that North said he had explained the Boland
amendment restrictions to the Contra but ``never violated
stricture'' and merely``gave advice on human rights, civic action
programs.''
   Testimony at the trial has indicated that North made many
speeches to potential donors to the Contra cause, although he left
the pitches for money to others, and that he gave extensive advice
to the Nicaraguan rebels.

<TEXT>
   Diplomats and ministers from 111
nations met Monday for a U.N.-sponsored toxic waste conference to
culminate in a treaty regulating international trafficking of
dangerous products.
   But African delegations demanded alterations in the 51-page draft
document and threatened to stall the three-day meeting.
   If approved, the treaty formally gives all signing countries the
right to refuse imports of hazardous wastes and requires exporters
to provide prospective recipients details of shipments.
   Signatories will pledge to dispose of dangerous waste in an
environmentally sound way and also will commit to keep international
toxic waste traffic to a minimum.
   Mostafa Tolba, executive director of the United Nations
Environment Program, said international hazardous waste trade is
threatening public health and the environment.
   At least 100,000 shipments of toxic waste crosses international
borders annually in a ``commerce of poison'' worth billions of
dollars, Tolba told delegates at the opening session.
   Tolba said the Basel treaty would signal the end of uncontrolled
hazardous waste transport.
   But Mali's environment minister, Morifing Kone, speaking for the
Organization of African Unity, said the treaty contains gaps. He
said some African nations want a guarantee that industrialized
countries won't use developing areas as a dumping ground for
poisonous wastes.
   Greenpeace, the international environmental group, on Monday
criticized the treaty for not covering radioactive waste and
allowing member countries to sign waste trade pacts with non-member
nations.
   The problem of international trafficking in dangerous wastes was
dramatized last year when several waste shipments from
industrialized countries were found dumped in African nations,
including Nigeria and Guinea. Waste-laden ships traveled from port
to port looking for a place to dispose of their cargo.
   Environmentalists said they were concerned that importing toxic
waste had become a source of income for poor countries with no safe
disposal plans.
   Europe's attention was drawn to the problem earlier when barrels
of toxic waste from Italy's Seveso chemical plant spill vanished in
1982 before turning up months later in France. The incident led to
the adoption of European Community rules on cross-border dangerous
waste transport.

<HEAD>Two Police Officers Found Dead near Border</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bodies of two high-ranking
police officers were found Monday in a car near the border with the
Irish Republic, authorities said. Unconfirmed reports said both were
shot.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the deaths, which
follow a series of retaliatory slayings by Protestant and Roman
Catholic extremists.
   On Sunday, gunmen stormed a Belfast home and killed a man while
he said his prayers with his wife.
   Eamonn Mallie, a reporter for Downtown Radio in Belfast, said the
slain officers were a constabulary divisional commander and his
deputy. The constabulary said only that both victims were
high-ranking officers, and there was no immediate report on the
cause of death.
   The constabulary said the car was found near Jonesborough, just
inside the British province of Northern Ireland. The area was sealed
off and the area was searched by helicopter before police and troops
moved in.
   Seamus Mallon, an opposition member of Parliament from Northern
Ireland, said the deaths of the two officers were ``a calculated and
brutal act of slaughter carried out by people for whom murder has
become a way of life.''
   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King pledged that the security
forces would take ``every possible step'' to combat the wave of
retaliatory murders.
   King, the British Cabinet minister responsible for Northern
Ireland, discussed the violence Monday with deputy police chief
Michael McAtamney of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
   ``What the RUC and all the security forces need at this time is
the full support of the whole community in a total rejection of
violence and a maximum public alertness and vigilance against these
evil groups,'' he said afterwards.
   David Braniff, 63 and a father of 13, was shot dead in his north
Belfast home Sunday night. Neighbors said two gunmen burst into
Braniff's house and shot him at point-blank range. They said he died
with his rosary in his hands.
   Police appealed to the public to help find Braniff's killers. No
group immediately claimed responsibility.
   Braniff, a Catholic, was a bricklayer who had been a Protestant
before he married. He had British flags tattooed on his arms and
worked in Protestant areas of Belfast.
   On Friday, Catholic civil servant Niall Davies, 42, was shot in
his home, apparently in retaliation for the IRA killing the previous
night of Jackie Irvine, 49, a former commander of the Protestant
paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force.
   The latest round of killings began Feb. 12 when Catholic attorney
Patrick Finucane was shot in his home. The Protestant underground
Ulster Freedom Fighters said they killed him because he was an IRA
officer. His widow denied it.
   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland and unite the province with the Catholic Irish
Republic to the south, while the Protestant majority wants to remain
under the British flag.

<TEXT>
   A massive stockpile of government-owned grain
and other commodities has been reduced to about half what it was a
year ago, the Agriculture Department reported Monday.
   The department's Commodity Credit Corp., which handles price
support operations, said the value of products under its control as
of Dec. 31 totaled $15.8 billion, down from $29.6 billion a year
earlier.
   Under CCC programs, when a crop is placed by farmers under price
support loan, the commodity cannot be sold or used by producers
until the loan is settled. In many cases, when market prices fail to
rise enough to make it worthwhile to pay off the loans, farmers
forfeit the commodity to the CCC, which then holds it as
``inventory'' or surplus.
   As of Dec. 31, the CCC had loans outstanding on $11 billion worth
of commodities and held $4.8 billion in its inventories. A year
earlier, CCC holdings were $17.3 billion and $12.3 billion,
respectively.
   Last year's drought, which cut production sharply, helped force
up market prices and ease the CCC load. Overseas demand also has
been a factor. Domestic use and also higher market prices or changes
in program policies have been other reasons.
   In the case of corn and other feed grains, for example, the Dec.
31 total held by CCC was about 2.36 billion bushels valued at $7.77
billion, including both loans and inventory. A year earlier feed
grains totaled 7.52 billion bushels worth $16.7 billion.
   The Dec. 31 wheat total was less than 768 million bushels valued
at $2.69 billion, down from 1.77 billion bushels worth $5.99 billion
a year earlier.
   Holdings of dairy products bought by CCC to support the price of
milk paid to farmers totaled 454.7 million pounds valued at $602.2
million, compared with 1.16 billion pounds and $1.43 billion a year
earlier.

<HEAD>Opposition Wants Takeshita Out; Government Counting on Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHIL BROWN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition parties said Monday that local elections
show voters want Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's government to
quit, but the ruling party said political reform would win back the
people's confidence.
   Chief government spokesman Keizo Obuchi dismissed opposition
calls for general elections, saying Sunday's ballot ``was a
gubernatorial election to select the governor and not a referendum.''
   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party candidate narrowly defeated a
communist contender to win the governorship of Chiba province
neighboring Tokyo.
   Newspapers said Monday the result showed waning support for the
party, which is embroiled in an insider trading scandal. Its bruised
image suffered more when it pushed an unwelcome 3 percent sales tax
through parliament in December. Together, they have driven
Takeshita's popularity to a record 15 percent low, according to
Asahi Shimbun, Japan's second largest newspaper.
   Three Cabinet ministers have resigned and 12 bureaucrats and
businessman have been arrested in the stock-profiteering scandal
involving Recruit Co.
   Takeshita has refused to call new elections. But elections are
scheduled in July for half of the bicameral Parliament's House of
Councilors, where Liberal Democrats hold 143 of the 251 seats.
   Large losses there would endanger Takeshita's chances in October
to win another two-year term as party president and prime minister.
   ``From now on, our party will promote political reform and strive
to revive the confidence of the people in government,'' said
Shintaro Abe, secretary-general of the ruling party, following
Sunday's vote.
   He called Takeshi Numata's narrow victory a positive sign
residents were prepared to support the party despite the scandal.
   But the opposition noted Numata defeated communist Shoji Ishii by
only 971,687 votes to 786,238 votes, compared with a 1985 victory of
781,000 votes to 271,000 votes over another communist candidate.
   In a second gubernatorial race Sunday, for Miyagi prefecture,
Socialist Shuntaro Honma easily won with 502,372 votes. His nearest
rival was conservative independent Seiki Suzuki, with 140,979 votes.
   Liberal Democratic candidate Kazuo Aichi had withdrawn earlier
after admitting he received more than $60,000 from Recruit, the
information conglomerate also accused of bribing legislators in a
bid to bury the scandal.
   Recruit offered bargain-priced unlisted stock in a subsidiary to
more than 150 influential politicians and businessmen in 1986.
Recipients made handsome profits once public trading in the shares
began later that year.
   Calling for new national elections, Socialist Party opposition
leader Tsuruo Yamaguchi said, ``The election results are
substantiated by the latest public polls by the media and clearly
show that the Takeshita Cabinet has lost its ability to govern.''
   The Communist Party said: ``The people are united ... in calling
for the early dissolution of the Takeshita Cabinet and the holding
of a general election.''
   Japan's biggest newspaper, the conservative Yomiuri Shimbun,
commented, ``In Chiba in particular, where the number of votes
obtained by the communists grew substantially, voters distinctly
showed their irritation and rage regarding the Recruit problem.''
   The ruling party also was stung last month when it lost a
parliamentary by-election in Fukuoka prefecture to a candidate
supported by its biggest rival, the Socialists.
   The Liberal Democrats have ruled Japan since World War II with
the exception of 10 months of Socialist government in 1947-48.

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo told a college audience
Monday that New York state must show leadership in this ``hour of
fright'' and then vetoed the latest legislation that would restore
the death penalty.
   Before issuing his seventh consecutive veto, Cuomo defended his
opposition to the death penalty before a rally of about 400 people
at Albany's Roman Catholic College of St. Rose. He again urged
lawmakers to approve his alternative of life without parole for some
murderers.
   ``The people of New York ought now in this hour of fright to show
the way,'' Cuomo said. ``We should refuse to allow this time to be
marked forever in the pages of history as a time that we were driven
back to one of the vestiges of our primitive condition because we
were not strong enough ... to find a better end to the violence.''
   It was the opening salvo of what is expected to be an intense
legislative battle. New York is one of 13 states without an operable
death penalty law. New York, which introduced the electric chair to
the world in 1890, has not executed anyone since 1963.
   With a crack epidemic and its accompanying violence sweeping
through New York City, supporters of the death penalty in the
Legislature claim they'll have enough votes to override Cuomo's
veto. An override attempt is expected in June.
   ``I know that this society should strive for something better
than we are in our worst moments,'' Cuomo said. ``It isn't easy for
people to hold back their anger ... but that is the only rational
course.''
   Cuomo said there's no persuasive evidence the death penalty
deters murderers. He said most would be more frightened by the
thought of spending the rest of their lives in prison.
   Both houses of New York's Legislature have already approved the
latest death penalty bill, for the 13th consecutive year. Cuomo has
vetoed the legislation every year he's been in office, as did former
Gov. Hugh Carey in the six years before that.

   President Bush exhorted newly installed
Ambassador Thomas Pickering on Monday to push for continued changes
at the United Nations, saying he's pleased with what he considers
improvements so far.
   During a White House swearing-in ceremony for the veteran foreign
service officer, Bush said the awarding of the Nobel Prize last year
to the U.N.'s peacekeeping team in Lebanon was a sign of a
turn-around for the organization.
   ``The U.N. can be a force for peace, a forum for resolving
conflict,'' he said. ``And as proof of this, consider its
instrumental role in the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, in the
Iran-Iraq war.''
   With Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Pickering at his
side, Bush used the occasion to applaud changes in U.N. management
practices under the leadership of Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar, saying he ``is doing a good job and he deserves our
support.''
   The Reagan administration late last year agreed to begin repaying
to the United Nations more than $474 million the United States had
withheld in protest of what it said were inadequate management
controls and insufficient attention to peacemaking initiatives.
   In his remarks Monday, Bush, who served as U.N. ambassador during
the Nixon administration, said he wants Pickering to make a special
effort in the world body to focus attention on ``the question of
human rights in Cuba.''
   ``The United Nations is on the right track toward reform and is
now a more effective organization,'' the president said. He praised
Pickering, 67, as a ``skilled diplomat, a veteran of high-priority,
tough assignments.''

<TEXT>
   Gunmen killed 17 Sinhalese men in a
shooting spree in north-central Sri Lanka, and Indian troops shot
and killed 12 Tamil rebels in separate weekend clashes, witnesses
and the military said Monday.
   Residents of Tirappane village said on condition of anonymity
that the Sinhalese victims were shot and then hacked to death Sunday
by unidentified assailants.
   Also on Sunday, Sinhalese rebels were blamed for seven other
deaths, military officials said.
   The motive behind the Tirappane killings was not immediately
known, but residents said the murders may be linked to the
assassination of three policemen by Sinhalese radicals in a nearby
village earlier Sunday.
   The policemen were killed when Sinhalese rebels detonated
explosives by remote control and blew up a jeep at Epawalla village,
about 15 miles southeast of Anuradhapura town.
   Police said an organization known as the ``Black Cats'' may be
responsible for the Tirappane murders. The group's aim is to
eliminate supporters of the radical Sinhalese group known as the
People's Liberation Front, police said.
   The Sinhalese Front is opposed to the government's peace offers
to Tamil rebels.
   Sinhalese radicals also killed four people on Sunday in Kaduwela,
a Colombo suburb.
   Elsewhere, six Tamil rebels were killed when they tried to ambush
an Indian patrol in northern Jaffna, 185 miles northeast of Colombo.
   Six more rebels were killed in a second clash with Indian
soldiers in Mullaitivu district, about 170 miles northeast of
Colombo.
   India has an estimated 40,000 troops in Sri Lanka to enforce a
peace accord aimed at ending the Tamil guerrilla war for an
independent homeland in the north and east, where they predominate.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindu, make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million people. They say they are discriminated against by the
Buddhist Sinhalese majority.

<HEAD>U.S. Settles with Indian Fisherman's Family</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. government agreed to pay $18,000
to the family of an Indian fisherman killed in a 1987 shooting
incident involving an American warship in the gulf, U.S. diplomatic
sources said Monday.
   The sources said on condition of anonytmity that the settlement
was reached with relatives of Jagdish Baghwan, 22, of Gujarat, India.
   Baghwan was a crew member on a fishing craft that was fired on by
the missile frigate USS Carr off the United Arab Emirates on Nov. 1,
1987.
   At that time, U.S. military officials said the Dubai-based
fishing boat had ignored signal lights and alarms warning it not to
approach a Navy oiler being escorted by the Carr. Two other
fishermen were wounded.
   American warships were operating at high alert against possible
attacks by Iranian armed speedboats in the southern Gulf, where the
nighttime incident occurred.
   The diplomatic sources said the settlement, equivalent to about
$18,000, was the maximum allowed under Emirates law in such cases.
The Indian government had asked for a $25,000 compensation,
according to the U.A.E. newspaper Khaleej Times.

   Andrei D. Sakharov urged members of the Academy of
Sciences on Monday to reject the leadership's list of candidates for
the new Soviet legislature, which does not include the Nobel Peace
Prize winner.
   The 67-year-old nuclear physicist and human rights activist, who
won the Nobel in 1975, said in a speech to the academy that many
scientists objected to the slate for Sunday's election approved by
the leadership in January.
   Sakharov and several other well-known proponents of reform are
missing from the list. The official news agency Tass quoted him as
saying, however, that scientists were upset ``not because Sakharov
was not nominated, but because the role of scientific institutions
was ignored.''
   He called for reversal of what he called the anti-democratic
decision, which produced a list of what critics describe as
old-guard managers of scientific institutions.
   A vote on the academy candidates is scheduled for Tuesday.
   Sakharov was nominated from several geographic districts for a
seat in the new 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies, but he
decided to refuse the nominations and fight for an Academy of
Sciences seat.
   Under an election law approved in December, 750 seats in the
legislature are reserved for the Communist Party and its affiliates
and for professional, social and trade union organizations. The
other 1,500 will be filled by representatives of the 15 Soviet
republics and their electoral districts.
   Those in the academy who support Sakharov hope to force a new
round of nominations by mustering enough support to deny all
nominees a majority, said Andrei Mironov, a former political
prisoner.
   That would force the academy to start over and produce a new list
of nominees under terms of the new election law.
   Twenty-five seats were allotted to the academy, but it gave five
to affiliated societies and associations. From 121 nominees, the
academy leadership chose 23 candidates for the remaining 20 seats.
   Although 60 research institutes nominated Sakharov, he was not
chosen for the final slate. The leadership's decision inspired
widespread press criticism and a demonstration at the academy's
Moscow headquarters.
   Tass said 1,108 academicians, corresponding members and
representatives of reseach institutes attended the three-day meeting
that began Monday.
   ``The first three days of this week may become the `hottest'
spring days for Soviet scientists,'' it said, alluding to the
leadership's rejection of such reformers as Sakharov, space
scientist Roald Sagdeev and sociologist Tatyana Zaslavsakaya.
   The agency acknowledged ``many scientists were unsatisfied'' with
the slate of candidates.
   Mironov said two other academicians also spoke on Monday in favor
of new nominations. No details of their remarks were available.

<HEAD>FCC Says Phone Company Surveys Find More Satisified Customers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Residential telephone users feel they're
receiving about the same quality of service they got before the
breakup of the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., and business
customers think their service has improved, according to a federal
analysis of phone company surveys.
   The percentage of residential customers who reported they were
satisfied with their phone service climbed from about 93.1 percent
to about 94.1 percent from 1985 to June 1988, the Federal
Communications Commission concluded.
   Small business user satisfaction increased from about 91.6
percent in 1985 to near 94.2 percent in the first half of 1988, the
most recent period for which figures are available, the FCC said.
   Large business user satisfaction climbed from about 90.3 percent
in 1985 to 94.7 percent in mid-1988, the commission said.
   ``Residence customer perceptions have not changed significantly
since 1985, while business perceptions have noticeably improved,''
it said.
   The FCC study, released last week, was based upon semiannual
reports the commission has required the seven ``Baby Bell''
companies to file in the wake of the 1984 AT&amp;T divestiture.
   The Bell company reports were broken down into five broad
categories for analysis: customer satisfaction, dial tone delay,
transmission quality, on time service orders, and equipment failure
and blocking.
   ``In the areas of customer perception, transmission quality and
dial tone speed, the companies generally improved since 1985. ...
The companies do show some decline with respect to on time service
... performance for residential customers,'' the report said.
   The percentage of customers satisfied with dial tone speed (a
connection within three seconds) rose from about 97.6 percent in
1985 to nearly 98.9 percent in 1988. Transmission quality
satisfaction climbed from about 89.9 percent to 94.5 percent.
   However, on time service order satisfaction for residential users
fell from 98.1 percent in 1985 to 97 percent in June 1988, the
report said.
   The report covered the local phone companies operated by U.S.
West, Southwest Bell, BellSouth, NYNEX, Pacific Telesis, Bell
Atlantic and Ameritech.
   The commission cautioned that data collected from state public
utilities commissions may be more detailed and that the data should
not be used to compare companies.
   ``The individual reports provided by the companies tend to
obscure trends since the indices almost always register over 90
percent,'' the commission said.

<HEAD>Surging Inflation Could Mean Recession This Year, Analysts Say</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates in 6th graf, Markets continued, with final stocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

   The recent spurt of inflation is raising fears
of a recession, with some economists predicting Monday that a
downturn could begin in the second half of 1989.
   These analysts believe that the Federal Reserve, faced with
alarming news of increasing price pressures, will squeeze credit so
tightly that an economic slump will be all but inevitable.
   ``Once you get inflation up to the levels we have right now, it
has taken a recession to cool things off. That is an unfortunate
fact of life,'' said Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at the New
York investment firm of Merrill Lynch.
   Inflation worries were heightened last Friday when the government
reported that prices at the wholesale level had shot up a full
percentage point for the second straight month.
   It was the worst back-to-back inflation news in nearly eight
years and it sent stock and bond prices plunging as investors
worried that the Federal Reserve would be forced to drive interest
rates higher in an effort to dampen demand.
   Markets continued to be battered by inflation worries on Monday,
with the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 stocks falling 29.64
points to close at 2,262.50, after a 48.57 point drop on Friday, the
worst one-day loss in nearly a year.
   Investors were braced for an even bigger market drop Tuesday if
the government's monthly check of consumer prices comes in with a
worse-than-expected number.
   Economists were looking for consumer prices to rise by about 0.5
percent in February. They feared that a figure as high as 0.7
percent could send markets into a tailspin. Even a 0.5 percent
increase would translate into an annual advance above 6 percent,
sharply higher than the price increases of 4.4 percent or less
during the past seven years.
   The Bush administration sought to play down inflation worries on
Monday with White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater telling reporters
that a number of recent business reports paint a picture of a
slowing economy which will be enough to break any inflationary
pressures.
   But private ecoomists said fears were now so widespread that the
Federal Reserve will be forced to take actions that will likely send
a variety of consumer and business interest rates higher.
   ``We are looking at potentially the worst inflationary bout since
the late 1970s and early 1980s,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist
of the Boston Co. ``It is a policy problem of immense proportions
for the Federal Reserve and it will require sharply higher interest
rates and potentially a recession to deal with.''
   Starting a year ago, the central bank, under Chairman Alan
Greenspan, began gradually nudging interest rates higher in an
effort to keep inflation from getting out of control.
   Some economists complained that the Fed was too tentative,
especially in the second half of 1988, and now is faced with the
need to slam on the brakes.
   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a
government securities dealer, predicted that the Federal Reserve
would boost the discount rate, the rate it charges to make loans to
financial institutions, two or more times in coming months.
   The Fed increased the discount rate to 7 percent on Feb. 24 in a
move widely seen as a signal that it intended to move more strongly
against inflationary pressures.
   ``The Fed gave up on gradualism in February,'' Jones said. ``Now
that they have become tougher and more aggressive, it makes the
danger of a recession greater.''
   Both Steinberg at Merrill Lynch and Sinai said they were now
forecasting recessions. The Merrill Lynch forecast calls for a mild
downturn to begin in the July-September quarter this year while
Sinai said he was not looking for a downturn until early next year.
   However, other economists, while forecasting slower growth, said
there was still a chance that the Fed would be able to achieve its
hoped for ``soft landing'' where growth slows enough to ease
inflationary pressures but not enough to mean an end to the
six-year-long economic recovery from the severe 1981-82 recsssion.
   ``A recession occurs when businesses get nervous and start laying
off people. I don't see that happening,'' said Michael Evans, head
of a Washington forecasting firm. ``Businessmen are still optimistic
and they are holding on to their qualified employees.''
   But the Shadow Open Market Committee, a group of economists who
monitor Federal Reserve actions, released a report Monday saying
that the central bank had ``increased the risk of a recession'' by
its recent actions.
   Politicians are worried as well. Six Republican senators last
week signed a letter complaining about the Fed's inflation-fighting
efforts.
   ``If the Fed persists in tightening credit and raising interest
rates, we fear it will sow the seeds of a recession,'' said the
letter, signed by Sens. Bob Kasten, R-Wis.; Don Nickles, R-Okla.;
Steve Symms, R-Idaho; Connie Mack, R-Fla.; Trent Lott, R-Miss., and
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.

   Four black detainees on a
hunger strike escaped Monday from a Johannesburg hospital, fled 38
miles to Pretoria and took refuge at the West German Embassy there,
officials said.
   The four men, who were held without charge for between 10 months
and 23 months, demanded that the government guarantee that they and
all other political detainees will be freed.
   ``We have committed no crime,'' the escapees said in a statement.
``We have been kept in detention for so long that we felt we had to
embark on a life-and-death hunger strike to dramatize our plight in
detention and to ultimately secure our immediate release.''
   West German Embassy Counselor Klaus Bonnemann said Monday night,
``They can stay and we will not make them leave against their will.''
   He said the men will have access to medical treatment if needed.
   Hundreds of detainees have taken part in hunger strikes since
January, demanding to be released or put on trial. The government
says it freed more than 400 detainees in the past month and that
about 350 remain in custody.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been held without charge for
varying lengths of time since the state of emergency was imposed 33
months ago.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha said his government is in contact with
the West Germans, and the matter was ``receiving attention.'' Botha
did not say what actions South Africa plans.
   The men said through the Detainees Aid Center that they belong to
organizations affiliated with the banned United Democratic Front,
the country's largest anti-apartheid coalition.
   They identified themselves as Job Sithole, 21, Ephraim Nkoe, 28,
Mpho Lekgoro, 24, and Clive Radebe, 28. All are from the townships
around Johannesburg and Pretoria and have been active in various
youth and student organizations, their statement said.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   The men did not disclose how they escaped from the hospital and
got to the West German Embassy.
   But lawyer Priscilla Jana, who met the men Monday evening, told
the South African Press Association the four took a taxi from the
hospital to the embassy.
   Journalists were not allowed inside the embassy, but from the
gates four black men clad in T-shirts and jeans could be seen
standing in the foyer of the building.
   The embassy, surrounded by 13-foot high walls, is less than a
half-mile from Union Buildings, South Africa's administrative
capital.
   People have escaped from South African custody and taken refuge
in foreign diplomatic missions several times in recent years.
   Most recently, three detainees escaped from a hospital in
September and holed up in the U.S. Consulate in Johannesburg for
more than 40 days before deciding to leave. The South African
government promised the three men, all United Democratic Front
members, would not be detained or restricted once they left the
consulate. The three have spoken regularly on behalf of the
organization in recent months.
   In another incident, Klaas de Jonge, a Dutch citizen accused of
smuggling weapons for the African National Congress guerrilla
movement, took refuge in the Dutch Consulate in Pretoria for more
than two years before he was returned to the Netherlands in
September 1987 in an exchange involving prisoners in four countries.

<TEXT>
   Victoria Burton, 11, shivering in a cold wind
on the first day of spring, sang the National Anthem at an empty
Robert F. Kennedy Stadium better than three other children and 29
adults Monday and won the right to sing it again _ with the sun
presumably warmer and the stands fuller.
   The girl from the Baltimore suburb of Cockeysville won an
audition to sing ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' on April 2, the day
before the baseball season begins for real, at an exhibition game
between the Baltimore Orioles and the St. Louis Cardinals, two
foreign teams named after birds.
   The nation's capital has been without a team since the second set
of Senators headed west, to Dallas-Fort Worth, in 1972. That version
of the Senators had been created as an expansion club by baseball's
rulers in 1961 to fill the void when the first Senators skipped town
for Minneapolis.
   Victoria, wearing a bow in her hair and braces on her teeth, said
she was nervous but not at all worried about forgetting the words.
She said she had known the words by heart for years.
   Her mother, Sarah Burton, said Victoria started singing even
before she learned to walk.
   She recalled that when Victoria was in the second grade, her
teacher called and said, ``I've got to talk to you about your
daughter.''
   ``I thought she'd done something terrible,'' Mrs. Burton said.
``But when I went to school, he said, `She's got this remarkable
voice. We've got to do something about it.'''
   Victoria joined the Maryland Children's Chorus. She also sings at
dinner theaters and, her mother said, at every opportunity.
   For several hours, the national anthem echoed in the empty
stadium. Contestants sat in high-priced seats along the first base
line awaiting the chance to stand at a microphone behind home plate
and sing.
   Among them were Mike Ferraro, 57, needing a shave, just off the
nightshift at the Merrifield, Va., Post Office, who carried the
words on a card in his pocket ``just in case my mind went blank'';
Ed Strude, an air conditioning refrigeration combusion engineer who
sings in the choir of the District Heights, Md., First Bapist Church
and does ``most of my singing for the Lord''; Cub Scout Jack Foy of
Laurel, Md., son of a computer whiz at the National Institutes of
Health; and Cheryl Chance, an editorial assistant for the U.S. Army
who said she was ``late for work even as we speak.''

   Alfredo Cristiani used his own
commercial success and public discontent with a long civil war to
overcome his party's image of an ultra-right movement linked to
death squads.
   Cristiani, who claimed victory in Sunday's presidential election,
says his Republican Nationalist Alliance party, known as Arena, is a
political force no one can ignore.
   Arena was founded by Roberto d'Aubuisson, a former army major
frequently accused of organizing right-wing death squads, and many
people wonder whether Cristiani runs the party or is a figurehead
for d'Aubuisson.
   Before the election, Cristiani said the U.S. government ``cannot
dismiss'' his party ``in the simplistic manner it did in the past.''
   ``We consider the United States our natural ally, but it cannot
come and impose models or conditions,'' said Cristiani, who attended
Georgetown University in Washington.
   U.S. administrations have criticized d'Aubuisson, who was
dismissed from the army in 1980 on grounds of plotting a coup. The
party founder denies the allegations against him.
   D'Aubuisson formed the party in 1981. It has gained popularity in
recent years and it won a slim legislative majority in 1988, which
puts it in the position of controlling both the legislative and
executive branches.
   Cristiani, a 41-year-old coffee farmer and distributor of medical
supplies, appealed in the campaign to El Salvador's traditionally
conservative middle and upper classes, and to others tired of a
9-year-old war that has taken more than 70,000 lives.
   ``I'd rather be sitting in my office'' than running for
president,'' he said in a pre-election interview. ``I am here
because I am convinced that my country can progress if we are free
in every sense of the word and adopt an economic model for
development.''
   At his side throughout the campaign was d'Aubuisson, stirring up
the crowds at rallies.
   D'Aubuisson lost the 1984 presidential election to Christian
Democrat Jose Napoleon Duarte. Cristiani, a member of Arena since
1982, became the party president in 1985 when d'Aubuisson stopped
down from that post.
   D'Aubuisson is currently an Arena representative in the National
Assembly and is still referred to by many party members as ``maximum
leader.''
   Cristiani, who has not been linked to the death squads, was
elected to the National Assembly in 1985 and re-elected last year.
   In a recent interview by The Associated Press, Christiani was
asked why d'Aubuisson had quit as Arena president.
   ``He recognized that his figure and all that had been said about
him was prejudicial to the party's image,'' he said.
   Cristiani also commented on the United States and d'Aubuisson.
   ``D'Aubuisson personally cannot expect the support of the United
States,'' he said. ``Even if he were to be born again his image
could not be changed there. They damaged it so much beyond
salvation.''
   Cristiani blames Arena's image problem on the foreign news media
_ especially the U.S. media. He also has criticized the U.S.
government for what he calls the ``distortion'' of Arena's image.
   Cristiani is a tall, angular man with a soft voice, graying
moustache and hair combed straight back, an exemplar of the economic
class that blames the military and politicians of the past for the
nation's ills.
   ``We may be conservative,'' he said of Arena, ``but we are the
only party that has defined the social problems of the country and
that offers a solution.''
   He said President Duarte, barred by the consitution from seeking
re-election, failed to end the war and solve economic problems.
   ``We must have a clear economic model _ a free market _ that
benefits all sectors of society; avoid protectionism, (and) let the
government take care only of those services where private business
will not enter,'' he said.
   Peace is a ``viable probablity'' if leftist guerrillas join the
democratic process, he said.
   If they don't, the alternative is ``efficient, professional use
of the armed forces, but we would rather sit down and talk about a
national peace proposal so we all may re-enter a peaceful life,''
Cristiani declared.
   ``Some objectives have been achieved and the main thing is that
all political parties are participating in the election.''
   Ana Guadalupe Martinez, a member of the rebel political
commission, said in an interview in Mexico City that Cristiani is on
the ``rational'' right but she fears d'Aubuisson is ``the power
behind the throne.''

<TEXT>
   The minister of justice and labor under
deposed President Alfredo Stroessner was charged Monday under a law
he often used to harass political dissidents.
   Also Monday, a Chilean convicted of participating in the
September 1980 assassination of Anastasio Somoza, who was ousted as
president of Nicaragua in July 1979, said he will appeal a police
order expelling him from Paraguay.
   Charges filed by Attorney General Diogenes Martinez said the
former minister, Jose Eugenio Jacquet, would ``attack opponents of
the former regime, calling them subversives and implicating them in
terrorist plans.''
   Jacquet's statements and actions were ``an open incitement to
violence, to disobedience of laws and a form of preaching hate
between Paraguayans,'' the document said.
   Law 209, titled ``In Defense of Public Peace and the Freedom of
Persons,'' says anyone convicted of inciting violence or urging
people to disobey laws can be given a jail sentence of one month to
three years.
   ``Preaching hate between Paraguayans'' carries a sentence of one
to six years.
   The law also forbids defaming the president or his ministers. It
often was used to detain opposition leaders for several days and
sometimes for months.
   Excerpts of Martinez's charges published by the newspaper Ultima
Hora cited an occasion in 1987 when Jacquet threatened to
``neutralize those who criticized'' the ruling Colorado Party's
leadership.
   Gen. Stroessner was deposed Feb. 3 by Gen. Andres Rodriguez, a
longtime associate, after ruling Paraguay for nearly 35 years.
Opposition leaders have asked Rodriguez to repeal the law.
   Manuel Modesto Esquivel, former director of the postal service,
also was charged with violating Law 209. Days before the coup, he
threatened to go into the streets with ``assault battalions'' to
defend the Stroessner regime.
   Both men are under arrest, charged with ``crimes against public
administration'' that include fraud, embezzlement and bribery.
Stroessner is in exile in Brazil.
   Alejandro Mella Latorre, the 39-year-old Chilean convicted in
Somoza's death, was placed under house arrest Sunday.
   After his release from prison Feb. 17, two weeks after Stroessner
was ousted, Mella Latorre said, ``My roots are in Paraguay'' and
that he would try to remain.
   Police say, however, that Paraguayan law allows the expulsion of
immigrants convicted of crimes punishable by more than two years in
prison.
   Mella Latorre claims not to have been involved in the
assassination of Somoza, who was killed by bazooka and gunfire on an
Asuncion street, but he served six years in jail for it and another
two years for participating in January 1986 prison riot.

   The payment of monthly ``imminent danger''
bonuses to sailors deployed in the Persian Gulf will come to an end
April 1, the Pentagon said Monday.
   The bonuses, previously known as hostile fire or combat pay, are
worth $110 a month and have been paid to servicemen working inside
the Persian Gulf since August 25, 1987.
   Defense sources disclosed almost two months ago that Gen. H.
Norman Schwarzkopf, the head of the U.S. Central Command, had
recommended an end to the bonuses because the truce in the Iran-Iraq
war was continuing to hold.
   Adm. William J. Crowe, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
approved the recommendation recently and officials in the Defense
Department's manpower office then signed the order Monday, said
William Caldwell, a Pentagon spokesman.
   According to Pentagon statistics, about $16 million has been paid
out in danger bonuses since August 1987. Before the ceasefire took
hold in the Iran-Iraq war last August, about 8,000 servicemen were
receiving the payments every month.
   While most of those receiving the bonuses were deployed on ships
in the region or flew warplanes over the Persian Gulf's waters,
servicemen assigned to small bases in Bahrain and Kuwait were also
eligible. As a result, about 1,300 women also received the bonuses
at one point or another, the Pentagon said.
   According to defense officials who declined to be identified,
Schwarzkopf concluded early last January the threat to Americans
assigned to the region ``has receded to the point that it is
difficult to justify danger payments.''
   ``And the fact that we went to a different regime _ one of
monitoring ship traffic instead of actually escorting tankers
directly _ changed things, too,'' observed one source, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The Central Command is the organization responsible for American
military operations in the Middle East and Indian Ocean region. As
such, it is the parent command for the Joint Task Force Middle East,
the unit responsible for guaranteeing the safety of merchant ships
flying the U.S. flag in the Persian Gulf.
   The administration of former President Ronald Reagan agreed in
the spring of 1987 to extend American military protection to 11
Kuwaiti tankers after they re-registered under the Stars and
Stripes. Kuwait, a friend of the United States and a key ally of
Iraq, had seen its ships become a special target of Iranian forces.
   In August 1987, one month after the first Kuwaiti tanker to be
escorted ran into an underwater mine, the Pentagon announced it
would start making the payments to the crews of warships operating
inside the Persian Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz and a small portion of
the Gulf of Oman, as well as personnel in Kuwait and Bahrain.
   Iran and Iraq agreed to a truce last August in their bloody,
8-year-old war and to date, the cease-fire has held. As a result,
the United States has slowly reduced the number of warships
operating in the region and stopped conducting closely supervised
convoy runs.
   Instead, the ships now in the region maintain what the Navy calls
a ``monitoring regime'' of keeping U.S.-flag tankers within radar or
radio range.
   The authority to make imminent danger payments was provided to
the Pentagon in 1983 under an amendment to a law that had previously
established procedures for providing hostile fire, or combat, pay.
   The new law specified that danger pay could be provided to
servicemen deployed in areas where there was a risk of terrorism or
other physical threats, even though American forces were not
directly involved in combat.
   After April 1, only a small number of servicemen assigned to four
countries _ Lebanon, El Salvador, Colombia and Peru _ will be
receiving the danger bonuses.

   The State Department said Monday it is prepared
to support the Salvadoran government that emerges from Sunday's
national election _ but only so long as it respects democracy and
protects human rights.
   Department spokesman Charles Redman praised the Salvadoran people
for having braved ``violence and terror'' by leftist guerrillas who,
he said, tried harder to disrupt Sunday's balloting than in any
other election in seven years.
   ``Our position is that we support the democratic process, that we
are prepared to support the person who emerges from that democratic
process,'' Redman said.
   ``Our relationship with that new government will dependon its
adherence to democracy and respect for human rights, the twin
pillars of our approach to El Salvador.''
   Redman spoke hours before the candidate of the ruling Christian
Democratic Party, Fidel Chavez Mena, conceded defeat to Alfredo
Cristiani, nominee of the rightist Arena party.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
judgments about human rights will be a ``very important factor'' in
guiding U.S. policy toward El Salvador.
   Vice President Dan Quayle also criticized FMLN guerrilla attempts
to disrupt the voting. Asked by reporters about the deaths of two
Salvadoran and one Dutch journalist Sunday at the hands of security
forces, Quayle said he lacked details.
   ``But what ought to be disturbing to the American people, and I
know it's disturbing to the people of El Salvador, is the fact that
the FMLN threatened the people of El Salvador with their lives for
exercising the democratic right to vote. That is a very disturbing,
shocking event and we ouht to be shocked about that,'' Quayle said
after an awards ceremony.
   Two members of a U.S. delegation sent by President Bush to
observe the election _ Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Rep. Tony
Coelho, D-Calif. _ said the process appeared to be fair but the
actions of the new government will decide whether U.S. aid continues.
   ``We concluded that it was a free and fair and honest election,''
McConnell said. ``Clearly the activities of the FMLN had some impact
on turnout in some areas of the country.''
   Coelho said the delegation met with Cristiani and told him that
``if they return to the death squads, return to the killing of the
early '80s, they should not expect support from individuals in our
legislature as well as our government.''
   But McConnell cautioned against applying an unreasonable standard.
   ``We had more murders in this city (Washington) last year than
they did in the occupied territories of the Middle East. We're not
in a very good position to be lecturing people about violence,'' he
said. ``The standard we need to apply here is not to expect that no
violence will occur in a country in which a war is going on but
rather how incidents are handled.''
   Meanwhile, dozens of demonstrators were removed by police Monday
from a State Department entrance as hundreds of others protesting
U.S. support for the Salvadoran government chanted from across the
street.
   The demonstrators did not resist as they were dragged away from
the diplomatic entrance. Barricades were then put up and employees
were diverted to other entrances.
   Placards and chants accused the United States of supporting
right-wing ``death squads.''
   Redman said the government of outgoing President Jose Napoleon
Duarte was committed to democracy and to improving human rights
performance.
   ``We will look to the new Salvadoran government to uphold the
same standards and to press for improvement,'' Redman said.
   The election took place amid growing restiveness in Congress
about American policy in El Salvador, partly because of the Arena
party's growing strength.
   A key figure in the Arena hierarchy is Maj. Roberto D'Aubuisson,
who was once described by a former U.S. ambassador to El Salvador,
Robert White, as a ``pathological killer.'' In 1980, the Carter
administration stripped D'Aubuisson of his U.S. visa.
   As administration and congressional sources see it, continued
legislative support for large-scale aid for El Salvador will depend
in some measure on Cristiani's ability to demonstrate that he is
more than a front man for D'Aubuisson.
   Although returns are not final, Cristiani has claimed victory
over the candidate of the ruling Christian Democratic party, Fidel
Chavez Mena.
   The United States has provided about $3.5 billion in economic and
military assistance to El Salvador during this decade, making it the
largest recipient of assistance in the hemisphere.
   Some in Congress maintain that the United States has received
little in return on its investment, pointing out that
politically-motivated killings average about 20 a month and that
efforts to negotiate an end to the strife have not succeeded.
   The conflict, now nearly 10 years old, is estimated to have
claimed about 70,000 lives.

   Government and opposition negotiators
attacked a series of unresolved problems Monday as talks on
political and economic reform entered a crucial phase.
   Solidarity, the banned independent union movement, reported
progress on amending a draft law on upcoming Parliament elections
that the government last week sent to Parliament for discussion
without consulting the opposition.
   Solidarity national spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz said the
government agreed to an opposition proposal that each candidate have
a representative on vote-counting commissions. That clause had been
dropped from the government draft sent to Parliament.
   Government negotiators also accepted an opposition demand that
the draft clearly state the law would be valid only for the upcoming
elections in June, Onyszkiewicz said.
   He said other problems remain, including a debate over the number
of signatures needed to nominate a candidate, but ``it is a fact
that the government side is ready to assume a flexible stand on all
those problems.''
   Negotiators hope to wrap up talks at the working groups so that a
plenary session can be held April 3. The talks began Feb. 6.
   Negotiators at a working group on trade union issues have reached
agreement on most issues, said opposition negotiator Henryk Wujec.
   But he said the two sides had failed to agree on the future of
workers who were fired for their participation in Solidarity or
their refusal to leave it when it was banned after the December 1981
martial law crackdown.
   Solidarity wants a statement saying the fired workers have the
right to return to their jobs included in the round-table document
on trade unions. The government says it is prepared to issue an
appeal to managers to allow the workers to return, Wujec said.
   Tens of thousands of workers were dismissed from their jobs after
martial law, Wujec said.
   ``We (Solidarity) decided if this problem is not solved, we
wouldn't be able to sign the final document. I think some solution
must be found,'' he said.
   Although disputes remain, one senior Solidarity supporter
expressed optimism that the talks would end in agreement.
   ``I am not that much of a pessimist to think that the round table
will end with a crash,'' Jerzy Turowicz, editor of the respected
Catholic weekly Tygodnik Powszechny told reporters.
   In another development, the banned union Rural Solidarity
concluded a two-day national congress by expressing reservations
about the upcoming Parliament elections and asking that its property
confiscated under martial law be returned, a spokesman said Monday.
   The meeting Saturday and Sunday in a Warsaw church brought
together more than 400 private farmers from around the country in
the first congress of Rural Solidarity since it was declared illegal
following the imposition of martial law.
   Negotiators at the round-table talks have agreed in principle to
grant legality again to Rural Solidarity. Solidarity and Rural
Solidarity are separate groups but are allied on most issues.
   Rural Solidarity spokesman Jacek Szymaderski said the union does
not plan to boycott parliamentary elections now being negotiated
between the opposition and the government ``despite the fact that
the proposed electoral law is not democratic and the proposed date
is premature.''
   Szymanderski said Rural Solidarity can expect to gain the support
of about a million private farmers when it is legalized.

<HEAD>Daytona Beach Cashes In On Break Crowds Once Headed To Lauderdale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Daytona Beach once again is
Florida's big spring break attraction, leaving some merchants in
Fort Lauderdale _ the original draw for college students _ hungry
for business.
   Daytona Beach officials have opened their arms to spring breakers
and expect more than 400,000 to show up at the beach and patronize
the city's hotels, bars and other resort businesses in the next two
weeks, pumping an estimated $100 million into the city's economy.
   And companies as diverse as Playboy Enterprises and AT&amp;T are
working to capitalize on the city that bills itself ``The World's
Most Famous Beach'' with major promotions to attract any loose
dollars.
   Volusia County lifeguards patrolling the shores in the Daytona
Beach area reported record crowds last weekend, and Chief Beach
Ranger John Kirvan estimated there were 150,000 beachgoers on
Saturday alone.
   ``We're busting at the seams,'' he said.
   But 229 miles to the south, the city popularized as the original
mecca for spring break revelers in the movie ``Where the Boys Are''
expects fewer than 20,000 students this year, down from 350,000 as
recently as 1985. Fort Lauderdale merchants believe they have lost
$100 million in annual business with the disappearance of the spring
break crowd.
   ``There's vacation, and then there's party,'' said Mark Aulb, 19,
a student from Ontario, Canada, who baked under the Daytona Beach
sun.
   Aulb, a student coordinator for spring break tours in Florida,
said he organized 20 busloads of spring travelers, with only one
headed to Fort Lauderdale.
   ``Daytona usually opens their arms to everyone,'' Daytona police
Officer N.F. Fiore said. ``It's a free-wheeling town.''
   Fort Lauderdale responded to large crowds several years ago with
a police crackdown on public drinking and driving infractions.
   Fort Lauderdale Mayor Bob Cox has made it clear since 1985 that
he doesn't want hordes of drunken college students in his city,
preferring to boost the South Florida destination as a family resort.
   ``I foresee nothing but a good impression,'' Cox said. ``There's
a couple of bar owners over there that don't agree. But by and
large, people say they've seen a real change in attitude.''
   T-shirt airbrush artist Edward Patterson, who has been coming to
Fort Lauderdale for spring break for the past nine years, said he is
selling his apartment and packing it up after this season. By
Friday, he had designed only one $12 shirt.
   ``Your lovely mayor has really screwed things up,'' he said. ``He
killed a billion-dollar business and didn't replace it with
anything. It's a shame that Fort Lauderdale has become a
seniors-only condo.''
   But in spite of missing college students, Richard Weaver,
president of the Greater Fort Lauderdale Visitors and Convention
Bureau, said 1988 was a record year for tourism.
   ``We're finding replacement markets that are beginning to
coalesce and replace the spring break,'' he said.
   Weaver said Fort Lauderdale pulled in $2.3 billion last year from
3.5 million visitors, a 4.5 percent gain over 1987, and he expects
to break records again in the first quarter of 1989.
   Linda Gill, president of the Broward County Hotel and Motel
Association, said there was a 17 percent occupancy increase in the
city's 30,000 rooms in January 1989, compared with January 1988.

   Two senior police officers were
killed Monday while returning from a meeting with colleagues in the
Irish Republic, authorities said. The IRA claimed responsibility.
   Lawmakers from Northern Ireland said the slayings suggested a
serious breach of security involving the regular consultations
between the two police forces, set up under the Anglo-Irish Accord
to coordinate action against terrorism.
   Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey condemned the murders and
pledged full cooperation in the investigation.
   The South Armagh Brigade of the Irish Republican Army sent a
message to news media claiming responsibility and saying the
movements of the victims had been monitored.
   The deaths followed a series of retaliatory slayings by
Protestant and Roman Catholic extremists. On Sunday, gunmen stormed
a Belfast home and killed a Roman Catholic man while he said his
prayers with his wife.
   A police spokesman said the names of the two dead officers were
not released, and said he had no firm information on how they were
killed. ``We assume they were shot,'' he said on condition of
anonymity.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, identified the
victims as Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Bob
Buchanan. Breen, the police commander in the South Armagh area, was
said to be the highest-ranking police officer killed in 20 years of
sectarian violence in the province.
   ``They were in an unmarked car, without uniforms, so their
identity had to be through information supplied to the terrorists,''
said the Rev. William McCrea, a Democratic Unionist member of
Parliament.
   The constabulary said the car was found near Jonesborough, just
inside the British province of Northern Ireland. The area was sealed
off and the area was searched by helicopter before police and troops
moved in.
   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King pledged that the security
forces would take ``every possible step'' to combat the wave of
retaliatory murders.
   King, the British Cabinet minister responsible for Northern
Ireland, discussed the violence Monday with deputy police chief
Michael McAtamney of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
   ``What the RUC and all the security forces need at this time is
the full support of the whole community in a total rejection of
violence and a maximum public alertness and vigilance against these
evil groups,'' he said afterwards.
   David Braniff, 63 and a father of 13, was shot dead in his north
Belfast home Sunday night. Neighbors said two gunmen burst into
Braniff's house and shot him at point-blank range. They said he died
with his rosary in his hands.
   Police appealed to the public to help find Braniff's killers. No
group immediately claimed responsibility.
   Braniff, a Catholic, was a bricklayer who had been a Protestant
before he married. He had British flags tattooed on his arms and
worked in Protestant areas of Belfast.
   On Friday, Catholic civil servant Niall Davies, 42, was shot in
his home, apparently in retaliation for the IRA killing the previous
night of Jackie Irvine, 49, a former commander of the Protestant
paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force.
   The latest round of killings began Feb. 12 when Catholic attorney
Patrick Finucane was shot in his home. The Protestant underground
Ulster Freedom Fighters said they killed him because he was an IRA
officer. His widow denied it.
   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland and unite the province with the Catholic Irish
Republic to the south, while the Protestant majority wants to remain
under the British flag.

<HEAD>Group Sees Growing Threat from Hazardous Materials on Rails</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toxic railroad accidents pose a growing threat
to communities nationwide and federal regulators do too little to
prevent them, a private group contended Monday.
   More than 24,000 people were evacuated as a result of 351 rail
accidents involving toxic materials in 1987, according to Citizen
Action, a public interest group based in Washington with chapters in
25 states.
   Forty-one of 50 states had at least one accident, the group said,
basing its findings on figures supplied by the Federal Railroad
Administration.
   A spokeswoman for the federal agency defended enforcement
efforts, saying that more hazardous material is being transported by
rail and yet figures on rail cars leaking such material show a
decline from 1984 and 1985.
   In 1987, the private group said, Illinois led the nation with 49
rail accidents involving hazardous materials, followed by Texas with
46 and Louisiana and Michigan with 15 each.
   Texas had the greatest number of railcars leaking toxic
materials, _ 29, or nearly one-third of the total _ in what the
group considered the most accurate measure of accident severity.
   Pennsylvania led the country with 12,360 people evacuated.
   Although the number of toxic rail accidents nationwide declined
3.7 percent from 1986, Citizen Action said the severity of those
accidents ``increased significantly,'' with the number of railroad
cars leaking toxic substances up 12.7 percent, from 79 in 1986 to 89
in 1987.
   Those numbers, however, are down from 109 railcars that released
hazardous materials in 1985 and 100 in 1984, said the Federal
Railroad Administration.
   Most toxic rail accidents were concentrated in heavily populated
states bordering the Great Lakes and the Gulf Coast _ states with
heavy industry or oil and gas production, Citizen Action said.
   ``Few communities are safe from the environmental contamination
of these catastrophes on wheels,'' said Robert Creamer, spokesman
for Citizen Action and executive director of the Illinois Public
Action Council, which conducted the study.
   Citizen Action said 4 billion tons of hazardous materials are
shipped annually, involving 250,000 shipments and 3,000 carloads a
day.
   The group contended that although 53 percent of rail accidents
involving hazardous materials stemmed from mechanical failures, the
Federal Railroad Administration does not effectively enforce rail
safety standards.
   ``The greatest contributor to toxic rail accidents are unsafe
track and roadbeds, yet even when FRA inspectors find a defect, they
do not assess a penalty _ they only notify the railroad of its
non-compliance,'' Creamer said.
   A spokeswoman for the agency said notifications come only in very
minor cases, and she said the agency in 1987 assessed hazardous
materials penalities totaling $646,750.

<HEAD>No Evidence Found of Wiring Fault in Crashed Airliner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators found no evidence of fire or
incorrect wiring in the right-hand engine of a British Midland
Airways jetliner that crashed on Jan. 8, killing 47 people, an
interim report said Monday.
   The bulletin issued by the government's Air Accident
Investigation Branch reached no conclusion about the cause of the
crash and said much work remains to be done on the investigation.
   The right-hand engine was shut off and the left-hand engine on
fire when the plane crashed early in the flight from London to
Belfast, Northern Ireland, the report said.
   It confirmed passengers' reports of a fire in the left-hand
engine of the brand-new Boeing 737 and said one fan blade had
fractured.
   In his first public comment since the accident, pilot Kevin Hunt
said, ``Both the first officer (David McLelland) and I agreed that
the right engine was causing us the problem.''
   Hunt, still hospitalized, said in a statement the crew had no
indication of a fire in the left engine until less than a minute
from crashing while trying to land at central England's East
Midlands Airport.
   The report quoted the flight crew as saying cockpit instruments
confirmed their belief that they had resolved their onboard
emergency by shutting off the right engine, and that the left engine
was operating normally.
   The left engine lost power when the airplane was nearly 2{ miles
from the airport and 900 feet above ground, and Hunt told McLelland
to restart the right engine, the report said.
   Seventeen seconds later, a bell rang warning of a fire in the
left engine, and 36 seconds after that the plane crashed without
ever regaining power in the right engine.
   Michael Bishop, chairman of British Midland, said the airline was
satisfied the report ``accurately relates the sequence of events so
far as they're known.'' He said he did not expect a final report to
be available until early next year.

<HEAD>Party Chairman Backs Daley Over Jackson-Supported Foe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic mayoral candidate Richard M. Daley
picked up an endorsement Monday from Democratic National Committee
Chairman Ron Brown, who spurned the candidate of his close ally,
Jesse Jackson.
   ``He is the Democratic Party's nominee and I am the national
Democratic Party's chairman,'' Brown said. ``Rich Daley stands for
the future of Chicago, for reaching out to all Democrats, for
building better schools, safer streets, and a stronger economy.
   ``These values are at the heart of the Democratic Party,'' he
said, ``and I heartily endorse them and him.''
   Jackson, who supported Mayor Eugene Sawyer in his losing primary
election bid against Daley, has since shifted support to a
third-party candidate, Alderman Timothy Evans.
   The victor of the April 4 election will serve the final two years
of the four-year term won by the late Mayor Harold Washington in
April 1987. He died in November 1987.
   Daley, the son of former Mayor Richard J. Daley, is white; Evans,
like Jackson, Brown, Sawyer and Washington, is black.
   Jackson was pivotal in helping Brown secure the Democratic
chairmanship, but Brown also worked hard to prove to moderates and
conservatives that he would be independent of Jackson and other
party liberals.
   ``The reverend knows I'm here. I'm not here to pick a fight with
Rev. Jackson or any other Democrats,'' Brown told reporters after
joining Daley for a breakfast with more than 100 black business and
political leaders.
   ``The Rev. Jackson and I are friends. I respect him. I told him
what I planned to do and he didn't try to persuade me otherwise,''
Brown said.
   Evans, the nominee of the Harold Washington Party, attempted to
take some of the glow off the morning meeting, calling it ``the
quickest trip a national party chairman has ever taken. He waved
hello and waved goodbye in a matter of a few hours.
   ``It doesn't sound like a ringing endorsement of Rich Daley to
me. I don't put down Ron Brown,'' he added. ``I know he's between a
rock and a hard place.''
   The most recent poll in the campaign, done by WLS-TV, showed 53
percent of the respondents favoring Daley to 36 percent for Evans, 5
percent for Vrdolyak and 6 percent undecided.
   The results of the telephone poll of 700 registered voters, taken
March 11 through March 15, had an error margin of plus or minus 4
percentage points.

<TEXT>
   Use of a linear accelerator to produce tritium
for nuclear weapons appears to be a promising alternative to current
Energy Department plans to build new production reactors, according
to a scientific report released Monday.
   The report, prepared by scientists at the Los Alamos, N.M., and
Brookhaven, N.Y., national laboratories, urged consideration of an
accelerator as a possible backup to building new reactors at the
Savannah River complex in South Carolina and the Idaho National
Engineering Laboratory in Idaho Falls.
   The report said construction of new reactors was the ``lowest
technical risk approach to supplying the critical need for tritium.''
   ``However, we believe it is prudent that DOE pursue other
technologies for tritium production to provide potential
alternatives as a contingency for the future,'' the report said.
``One concept that appears to be particularly promising is the
accelerator production of tritium.''
   Ronald Cochran, acting head of the Energy Department's Office of
New Production Reactors, told a special panel of the House Armed
Services Committee on Monday that the department has yet to see the
report.
   ``We will review the report with great interest,'' Cochran said,
adding that department believes the accelerator proposal involves a
``level of risk too great at this time'' to make it an alternative
to constructing the reactors.
   The nation's current supply of tritium is threatened by the
crumbling conditions at the department's existing production
reactors and weapons plants.
   An accelerator is essentially a long tunnel in which subatomic
particles are whipped at high speed until they crash into a target,
in this case lithium clad in aluminum. The resulting collision
produces tritium _ a critical element in nuclear weapons that
increases the power of warheads, but decays rapidly.
   The report said that an accelerator could be completed within
eight to nine years on an aggressive schedule compared with at least
10 years to finish a new production reactor.
   An accelerator would cost about $2.3 billion, including $600
million for contingencies, the report said. The estimated cost of
the new Savannah River reactor has been pegged at about $3.2
billion, while the Idaho reactor would cost about $3.6 billion.

   First dog Millie took sick after giving birth
to six puppies, the White House said Monday.
   First lady Barbara Bush's press office said the springer spaniel
was suffering from a slight fever in the wake of Friday night's
delivery.
   The fever was said by physicians to be caused by a mild
post-delivery uterine infection.
   Millie's temperature reached 104, the press office said, but that
was only a few degrees above the 100-101 range which is normal for
canines.
   It said the dog was responding well to prescription medicine
taken in tablet form three times a day, and said the treatments
would continue for several days.
   Meantime, Mrs. Bush was quoted as marveling about how the puppies
were ``doubling in size before my eyes.''

   The next U.S. move in the Middle East will be a
plea to the Palestine Liberation Organization on Wednesday to ease
tensions on the Israeli-held West Bank and in Gaza, U.S. officials
said Monday.
   But prospects for success apparently are dim. PLO officials
already have vowed not to relent in their 15-month uprising while
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told 1,100 visiting foreign
Jews in Jerusalem that he would not deal with the PLO.
   Diplomatic sources said Shamir would come to Washington on April
5 and meet with President Bush on April 6. A U.S. official said,
meanwhile, that President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt would be here April
3 to 5 for similar meetings. King Hussein of Jordan is expected
later in the spring.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told a House appropriations
subcommittee last week he might urge Israel to talk to the PLO if
negotiations could not be held with other Palestinians.
   Baker also unveiled during a visit by Israeli Foreign Minister
Moshe Arens his hopes for reciprocal gestures by the PLO and Israel
on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   The idea would be for Israel to relax its grip on the territories
by reversing its detention of Palestinians while the PLO would try
to moderate the protests that began in December 1987. Since then,
403 Arabs and 17 Israelis have been killed.
   Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman, announced on
Monday the sixth U.S. session with the PLO would be held in Tunisia.
He said its purpose was ``instituting a dialogue'' with Yasser
Arafat's organization.
   Without going into detail, Redman said the idea was ``to try to
make some concrete progress in the peace process.''
   Other U.S. officials, who declined to be identified, said
Ambassador Robert Pelletreau's meeting with a PLO representative on
Wednesday would provide an opportunity to seek reciprocal easing of
tensions.
   The U.S. enovy has held five sessions in Carthage since the
Reagan administration ended a 13-year ban on dealing with the PLO
last December.
   PLO officials have complained the meetings were not substantive.
Israel, on the other hand, criticized the United States for
accepting a pledge by Arafat renouncing terrorism.
   Since then, PL0 guerrillas have conducted several raids against
Israelis in southern Lebanon. Baker has concluded the attacks do not
amount to terrorism requiring the talks to be broken off.
   Shamir, in a speech in Jerusalem, said ``we fully recognize that
the status quo is not in our interest, because it means absence of
peace, and peace is our paramount goal.''
   At the same time, Shamir reiterated Israel's reasons for refusing
to talk to the PLO or to withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza, which
were lost by Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Six-Day War.
   ``The government is united in its opposition to the creation of a
Palestinian Arab state west of the Jordan River. We are opposed to
negotiations with the PLO because it will inevitably lead to a
demand for a state west of the Jordan River,'' he said.

<HEAD>Congressmen Complain About Soviet Testing of Advanced Western TV</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Congress asked the Commerce
Department on Monday to explain why testing of Western-made
high-definition television equipment in the Soviet Union wouldn't
violate laws prohibiting the transfer of advanced technology to the
Soviet bloc.
   Reps. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., and Don Ritter, R-Pa., said in a
letter to Commerce Undersecretary Paul Freedenberg they were
concerned ``about affording the Soviet Union access to advanced
television cameras, displays, video recorders and signal processing
technology'' that could ``result in the transfer to the Soviet Union
of sensitive technology that has potential for both military and
commercial applications.''
   The Soviet Union has offered to conduct the first side-by-side
tests of competing HDTV technologies being developed in Japan, the
United States and Europe. The Soviets say the tests would be an
objective assessment of the differing systems and could speed
development of a single system for worldwide use.
   At hearings earlier this month before the House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications and finance, which is
chaired by Markey, questions were raised about possible violations
of export-control accords.
   HDTV, which promises motion-picture quality images, has a number
of potential uses, including entertainment, medicine, education and
the military.
   The Commerce Department has jurisdiction over COCOM, the
Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Control, which is an
international watchdog agency regulating the flow of high-technology
products from Western nations to the communist bloc.
   Markey and Ritter asked Freedenberg to report back within 30 days
on whether advanced television technologies are subject to the COCOM
restrictions and if they had been approved for transfer to the
Soviet bloc.
   Their letter asked Freedenberg to spell out ``what actions the
Commerce Department and other federal departments, agencies or
entities presently are taking or, prospectively, will take to ensure
that HDTV or advanced television technologies, if they are
prohibited technologies, are not transferred to the Soviet Union or
other Eastern bloc nations by domestic or foreign entities.''
   They also asked Freedenberg to outline how Commerce determines
what is prohibited by COCOM and how the United States monitors
adherence to the accords by other nations.
   Ken Robinson, a policy adviser in the Commerce Department's
National Telecommunications and Information Administration, said
agency officials could not comment on the letter until they had seen
it.
   But he noted that Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, during a
recent appearance before the subcommittee, ``said he was not in
favor of exporting potentially strategic sensitive technology to the
Eastern bloc.''
   Mosbacher also told the subcommittee his department had not
agreed to any such transfers, Robinson said.

   Pan American World Airways has yet to implement
many steps recommended by a security consultant who in 1986 warned
that the airline was doing little to prevent bombs from being
smuggled onto aircraft, a congresswoman said Monday.
   According to Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., the Israeli security
firm KPI Inc. cautioned the carrier more than two years ago that it
was ``highly vulnerable'' to terrorist attacks.
   ``The fact that no major disaster has occurred to date is merely
providential,'' KPI wrote in September 1986, Mrs. Collins said.
   Last Dec. 21, Pan Am's Flight 103 was blown from the skies over
Scotland by a bomb authorities say was placed in a radio-cassette
player, killing 270 people.
   Mrs. Collins, chairwoman of the Goverment Operations
transportation subcommittee, wrote a letter to the Federal Aviation
Administration on Monday quoting portions of reports the security
company wrote to Pan Am in September and November of 1986.
   Mrs. Collins wrote that ``within days'' of the completion of the
September 1986 paper, a terrorist attack in Karachi, Pakistan,
killed 18 Pan Am passengers and crew members.
   The studies included examinations of security at nine airports,
including Frankfurt, West Germany, and London's Heathrow Airport.
Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt and had landed in London.
   Mrs. Collins' letter said that according to information her panel
has gathered ``from a variety of sources,'' Pan Am has yet to
correct ``many of the gaps'' specified in the 1986 studies.
   ``If they had been, it is possible that those lives could have
been saved,'' she wrote, referring to the Scotland and Pakistan
disasters.
   Jeffrey Kriendler, Pan Am's corporate communications vice
president at the airline's New York headquarters, said KPI is
unfamiliar with Pan Am's current security program. He said the
company would not respond to Collins' criticism until corporate
officials had seen the letter.
   The KPI reports concluded that Pan Am conducted insufficient
checks of baggage, did a poor job of questioning passengers boarding
planes, and was slow to react to warnings of possible terrorist
activity, according to Mrs. Collins.
   ``In conclusion, there are no adequate safeguards under the
presently operating security system that would prevent a passenger
from boarding a plane with explosives on his person or in his
baggage, whether or not he is aware of the fact,'' the security
company wrote.
   The reports said X-ray examinations of luggage should be replaced
with manual searches, which were performed too infrequently.
   ``On the whole, the presently employed search techniques stand a
low chance of discovering concealed explosive charges, if at all,''
the consultant wrote.
   The company wrote that careful scrutiny of lost-and-found baggage
``is very rare,'' making it simple for explosives ``to be sent
ownerless to a supposed destination.''
   At some airports, including London, baggage with a Pan Am tag
simply placed on a conveyer belt would be loaded onto planes, even
without a registered passenger, KPI said.
   The consultant criticized airline employees for being too lax
when searching the baggage of Americans and of citizens of each
airport's country, considering them safer.
   ``It might be pointed out that the question of citizenship is
irrelevant to the terrorist threat,'' KPI said.
   The consultant said it found little effort to carefully
scrutinize suspicious-looking passengers.
   It also complained that in some instances, warnings of terrorist
plans were not relayed to all Pan Am security workers. In one
incident, all Pan Am security employees at Frankfurt and Paris were
not told of a warning received about two Middle Eastern women who
were planning to place explosives aboard a plane. The report did not
say what the consequences were.

<HEAD>Michelangelo Would Have Run Afoul of Schlock Art Law, Attorney Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michelangelo would have run afoul of Massachusetts
law if he tried to sell his painting of the Sistine Chapel as an
original, an attorney challenging the state's new ``schlock art''
law claimed Monday.
   ``The statute as it is written defines `original' as requiring
only one person to work on it, and Michelangelo had apprentices that
helped him out,'' said attorney Alvin Nathanson.
   Nathanson represents United Oil Paintings Inc., which sells oil
paintings for $35 to $200 in seaside art galleries and shopping
malls up and down the Eastern seaboard. The company sued
Massachusetts saying the state law _ the first of its sort in the
nation _ is vague and unconstitutional.
   The law bans the sale of ``non-original art'' unless it is
labeled ``not an original.'' It defines original as ``independently
created and executed and signed by the individual artist'' _ a
standard Nathanson insists many Old Masters could not meet.
   After a three-day trial last week, both sides are now waiting for
Suffolk Superior Court Judge John Cratsley to decide what separates
original art from schlock. Cratsley is not expected to rule until
next month at the earliest.
   The state legislator who wrote the law said he only intended to
keep consumers from being sold cheap copies under the guise of
``original'' art.
   State Sen. Robert Buell said ``schlock art'' companies put names
similar to those of famous artists on paintings that are very
similar to the well-known works. While such paintings stop short of
forgery, Buell said, they are certainly not original.
   ``There's nothing wrong with selling it,'' said Buell, who
sponsored the law on behalf of artists in the seaside resort of
Rockport. ``It's just deceitful to tell the customer who's paying
$45 or $65 that he's getting an original painting.''
   United Oil, in a broad attack on the law, has asked the court not
only to define original but also to explain how police officers
charged with enforcing the law could be expected to make such
distinctions.
   Douglas H. Wilkins, the assistant attorney general defending the
state, has argued that the point is moot since United Oil has never
been prosecuted, though it has sold more than 60,000 paintings since
the law was passed.
   Wilkins also has argued that the law is constitutional because it
protects consumers against deceptive marketing.
   He told the judge it could be used to prosecute those who copy
others' work, make machine reproductions and sell them as original
oil paintings or sign false names to paintings.
   Wilkins dismissed the Michelangelo example, saying any law could
be challenged in the abstract using far-fetched examples.
   ``How are they going to sell the Sistine Chapel, anyway?'' he
said. ``Is it like selling the Brooklyn Bridge?''

   Israeli troops shot and wounded 10 Palestinians
in the occupied territories on Monday, and four Jewish settlers were
arrested on suspicion of burning Arab farm equipment in a vigilante
raid.
   The Gaza Strip was paralyzed for the third day in a general
strike called after bloody riots.
   Over the weekend, seven Palestinians were killed in clashes by
army gunfire, raising to 403 the number of Palestinians killed since
the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987, protesting Israeli occupation of
lands seized from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
Seventeen Israelis have also died.
   Despite curfews that confined more than 330,000 Gaza residents to
their homes, six Palestinians were wounded in clashes in the seaside
strip.
   The wounded included a 9-year-old boy from Khan Yunis who was
shot in the stomach, Arab hospital officials said. The army
confirmed four wounded in Gaza.
   The army said two soldiers were slightly hurt in Gaza City when
they were attacked by Arab stone-throwers, and one lost his rifle.
   The army ordered residents to return the weapon by Tuesday
morning or face harsh sanctions, army radio reported. Arab reports
said residents were threatened with curfews and water cuts.
   Four Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip were arrested Monday and
accused of setting fire to 16 Palestinian-owned greenhouses and a
tractor near Deir el-Balah refugee camp Saturday night. The raid was
reportedly in retaliation for a Friday attack on a settler-owned
packing house in Gush Katif.
   The national Itim news agency said an army patrol spotted the
vigilantes and informed police of the raid.
   In the West Bank, four Palestinians were wounded Monday, the army
said. Arab hospital officials said they included a 70-year-old man
from Nablus, shot in the leg.
   The head of the military administration in the West Bank, Brig.
Gen. Shaike Erez, meanwhile held a meeting with Palestinian leaders
in the area.
   ``It was not the first meeting and it won't be the last,'' said
the administration spokesman, Capt. Olivier Rafowicz.
   Arab participants said they told Erez that Israel must negotiate
with the Palestine Liberation Organization to end the uprising.
   ``People said this was a political struggle ... that needed a
negotiated and peaceful solution,'' said Gabi Baramki, acting
president of Bir Zeit University. ``We said the only negotiating
partner is the PLO.''
   Israeli leaders insist they will not negotiate with the PLO,
which they regard as a terrorist organization.
   The radical Islamic fundamentalist Hamas (Zeal) movement released
a leaflet on Monday calling for a general strike in two weeks and an
Arab boycott of Israeli products.

<HEAD>Police Say Bloody Underworld War Has Ended</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The boss of a gang battling Japan's top underworld
syndicate told police his gang will disband, ending the bloodiest
gangster vendetta in postwar Japanese history, police said Monday.
   Hiroshi Yamamoto, 64, visited a police station near his home
Sunday afternoon to announce his decision to disband the Ichiwa-kai
gang, said police in Kobe, a major port city in western Japan.
   ``He came here, told us the gang was disbanding, and left. It all
took about three minutes,'' the officer at Higashi-Nada precinct
said.
   It is not uncommon for gangsters to make such appearances at
police stations, and many bosses even make written vows to police to
end conflicts or disband gangs, said the officer, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   But he said police are still waiting for a reaction from the
rival Yamaguchi-gumi, by far the nation's largest crime syndicate,
and further skirmishes could erupt.
   The Ichiwa-kai, which had an estimated 6,000 members at its peak,
was created in June 1984 after an internal dispute over
Yamaguchi-gumi's leadership led to a revolt by followers of
boss-candidate Yamamoto.
   In January 1985, two Ichiwa-kai gangsters fatally shot
Yamaguchi-gumi boss Masahisa Takenaka and two other syndicate
leaders.
   The Osaka High Court on Monday upheld a lower court verdict
sentencing the two to life imprisonment and also upheld sentences of
10 years for three Ichiwa-kai lookouts.
   The Ichiwa-kai attack left the Yamaguchi-gumi without a leader,
although acting boss Kazuo Nakanishi and ``young leader'' Yoshinori
Watanabe quickly led the gang into the bloody vendetta, known to the
Japanese as the ``Yama-Ichi War.''
   Police say 315 armed incidents during the four-year battle
between the two gangs left 25 people dead and more than 70 injured.
   A Yamaguchi-gumi source said Yamamoto ``timed the breakup of the
gang to match the sentencing, as a kind of gesture to the
Yamaguchi-gumi.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In Japan, where gun laws are strict and violent crime rates low,
the high-profile gunfights created public outrage and spawned
grassroots movements to rid residential areas of gang headquarters
and offices.
   The strongest of those movements evicted a Yamaguchi-gumi
affiliate from a residential area in Hamamatsu, central Japan, and
the gang today is on the verge of disbanding.
   Headquarters of both the Yamaguchi-gumi and the Ichiwa-kai are in
expensive residential districts in Kobe, but their presence has not
faced serious local opposition.
   When the Ichiwa-kai split from the Yamaguchi-gumi, the
organization had roughly 10,000 members. Police say it now has more
than 20,000.
   Police say about 86,000 gangsters operate in 3,200 gangs in
Japan. Nearly 40 percent belong to the big three nationwide
syndicates: the Yamaguchi-gumi, Sumiyoshi Rengo-kai and Inagawa-kai.
The latter two are based in Tokyo.

   A 17-vehicle motorcade loaded with
$3 million worth of medicine and other private humanitarian aid for
El Salvador was stalled at the border Monday after Salvadoran
officials denied entry, a group spokeswoman said.
   Cynthia Curtis said the motorcade, organized by ``Building with
the Voiceless in El Salvador,'' a Washington, D.C.-based group, had
been at the border town of La Hachadura since March 13 after
crossing Mexico and Guatemala.
   Ronald Robinson of San Francisco said Salvadoran immigration
officials turned the group back even though its members had valid
entry visas. The officials claimed the country was closed to
foreigners because of Sunday's presidential elections, Robinson said.
   He said the mission was sponsored by the John F. Kennedy
Foundation for Human Rights and carried $3 million in food,
clothing, medicines and school materials donated by a number of
American private companies.
   The group is made up of 40 U.S. citizens, including 12 women,
four Canadians and and one Australian, all volunteer humanitarian
aid workers, Robinson said.

   Egyptians and Israelis, discussing their
countries' relations after a decade of peace, agreed Monday that
solving the Palestinian problem is the only way to foster true
friendship between the former enemies.
   An Israeli Cabinet minister and two Egyptians, all major players
in development of the peace treaty signed March 26, 1979, urged the
Jewish state to recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization as a
first step toward peace across the region.
   They and a group of students, journalists and others met for a
discussion organized by the British Broadcasting Corp. and taped for
broadcast Tuesday, five days before the anniversary of the first and
only treaty between an Arab state and Israel.
   ``Let us make a difference between the two aspects of the
(treaty). The first was peace between Egypt and Israel. The second
was the solution of the Palestinian problem,'' said Butros Ghali,
Egypt's minister of state for foreign affairs.
   ``We have been successful in achieving the first. We have
completely failed in achieving the second one.''
   Ghali was deeply involved in negotiations over the 1978
U.S.-brokered Camp David Accords, which set a framework for the
treaty, and over the treaty itself.
   ``We decided in Camp David on a very important issue, that we are
going to solve the Palestinian problem,'' said Ezer Weizman,
Israel's minister of science and development and another key player
in the process. ``This is the next issue coming up, and I believe
that to continue what we started, we have to do that.''
   Ghali agreed, and added: ``Sooner or later, you will talk to the
PLO.''
   Israel considers the PLO a terrorist group, and a succession of
Israeli governments has vowed never to negotiate with it.
   Weizman, a leading member of the left-leaning Labor party,
reiterated his well-known position that Israel should negotiate with
the PLO and predicted that talks could begin within two years.
   Monday's third main participant, Mustafa Khalil, was a senior
aide to the late President Anwar Sadat, whose 1977 trip to Jerusalem
led to peace between the two countries.
   Despite diplomatic relations, Egyptian-Israeli cooperation in
most fields has been very limited. Large numbers of Israeli tourists
come to Egypt, but few Egyptians go to Israel.
   Several Egyptian participants at Monday's session indicated the
extent to which bad blood remains from four Arab-Israeli wars since
1948.
   Khaled Daoud, a student at the American University in Cairo, said
he had come to the session to discuss Egypt's relations with Israel,
but ``I did not know there would be Israelis here before I came. If
I had known, personally, I would not have come.''

<HEAD>Soviet Leader Calls For United Europe Without Arms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev called for a
united Europe without ``offensive arms of any type'' in a videotaped
message shown Monday at an Italian Communist Party congress.
   ``The idea of the `common European house' isn't born at a desk,
but is the result of the history of Europe,'' he said.
   ``We are convinced that this is possible, that Europeans,
together with Americans and Canadians, can revive the idea ... of an
integrated Europe, where everyone maintains his own national origin
and unlimited liberty, where there are no nuclear arms nor offensive
arms of any type.''
   Delegates viewed the videotape on a huge screen at a Rome
convention hall.
   Some U.S. and European officials have expressed concern that the
popular Gorbachev will create pressure for disarmament in NATO
countries.
   Gorbachev said about his restructuring policies in the Soviet
Union that ``our people are for perestroika'' and that ``the
openness will last forever.''
   However, he added, ``We are not yet satisfied with the results we
have obtained.''
   Italian Communists, who make up their country's second-biggest
party and are in the opposition, warmly applauded Gorbachev's
remarks.

   Travelers blocked by strikes at Corsica's
ports and airports referred to themselves Monday as hostages, and
demonstrators battled police in the French island in the
Mediterranean.
   Police threw tear gas grenades to disperse about 350 protesters
throwing stones and burning tires in front of this northern city's
administrative offices. Officials said two policemen were injured.
   A group of travelers unable to leave Corsica established a
``committee of hostages'' and urged French officials to provide
means of evacuation ``to honor the elementary and constitutional
right of all citizens to freedom of movement.''
   The island's ports and airports have been closed since the middle
of last week in an escalation of the strike by public employees that
started five weeks ago.
   French Premier Michel Rocard met in Paris with six Corsican
legislators and said the government would organize discussions on
reform programs with political, social and economic leaders of
Corsica.
   He said success would depend a ``spirit of dialogue and
responsibility.''
   Strikers are demanding what they call an insularity bonus to
compensate for high prices. Officials in Paris have not disputed the
strikers' claim that prices of basic goods are higher in Corsica
than in mainland France.

   The Justice Department's withholding of
documents about the toxic-waste cleanup Superfund ``arguably had the
purpose or the effect'' of obstructing a 1983 congressional inquiry,
an independent counsel said Monday.
   But Alexia Morrison also concluded there was a lack of evidence
that the subject of her criminal investigation, former Assistant
Attorney General Theodore B. Olson, was part of any conspiracy to
withhold documents in the matter.
   Olson made ``misleading and disingenuous'' statements during a
March 10, 1983, appearance before a House subcommittee, but there is
insufficient evidence that he ``knowingly testified falsely,''
Morrison concluded in a 225-page report.
   Olson's answers were not ``overly helpful,'' but ``it clearly
cannot be said in our view that the testimony actually obstructed
the committee's inquiry.''
   Morrison had announced last Aug. 26 that she would not seek an
indictment aganst Olson.
   Her report, detailing the reasons, was released by a special
court that appointed Ms. Morrison independent counsel to investigate
allegations that Olso gave false testimony to obstruct the inquiry
of the House Judiciary monopolies subcommittee.
   The panel was investigating allegations that the Justice
Department concocted an ``executive privilege'' claim to prevent
Congress from obtaining Environmental Protection Agency documents
concerning possible misconduct by Superfund officials.
   The confrontation between Congress and the executive branch
helped bring the ouster of EPA administrator Anne M. Burford and
other top officials, including Superfund director Rita Lavelle.
   Lavelle was later convicted of lying to Congress about conflicts
of interest in her management of the EPA's Superfund program.
   Morrison, who unsuccessfully sought to broaden her investigation
to consider conspiracy charges against two other former top Justice
Department officials, suggested in her report that there was a basis
for suspecting a concerted effort to thwart the subcommittee's
inquiry.
   ``The principal act which arguable had the purpose or the effect
of obstructing that inquiry was the failure to disclose to the
committee the existence of documents which the department had
withheld from its production to the committee,'' Morrison said. ``We
could find no evidence linking Mr. Olson to that failure.''
   Morrison noted that then-Deputy Attorney General Edward C.
Schmults withheld handwritten notes of department officials from the
documents turned over to the subcommittee.
   Carol E. Dinkins, then assistant attorney general in charge of
the lands and natural resources division, also withheld a draft
chronology of the executive privilege dispute compiled within the
department.
   The subcomittee was not told that these documents were being
withheld and was led to believe that virtually everything covered by
its request was turned over, Morrison said.
   ``The concealment of the notes and chronology arguably
obstructed, and certainly substantially delayed, the successful
completion of the committee's inquiry,'' Morrison said.
   ``And there were enough people involved in this course of conduct
to give rise to the question whether they acted in concert to
obstruct the committee's inquiry.''
   For this reason, Morrison said that in late 1986, she asked
then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III to expand her jurisdiction to
pursue conspiracy allegations against Schmults and Dinkins.
   On the advice of the Criminal Division, Meese refused to expand
Morrison's mandate and opposed her request to the special court for
permission to broaden the investigation. The special division of the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled that it couldn't overrule
Meese but said Morrison could investigate whether Olson participated
in a conspiracy.
   In her report, Morrison said, ``The withheld materials were
plainly within the compass of ... (the panel's) request, and they
contained information critical to any assessment of the department's
role in the EPA documents controversy.''
   Even though there may have been a valid basis for withholding the
material, ``there could not be in our view any justification for the
failure to inform the committee of the existence of the withheld
documents,'' Morrison said.
   In a statement attached to the report, Schmults, now general
counsel of GTE Corp., in Stamford, Conn., pointed to a 1986 Justice
Department memo concluding that ``there are no reasonable grounds to
believe that further investigation or prosecution is warranted''
with regard to him.
   Olson's attorneys, in another statement, said he was ``unaware of
any evidence suggesting the existence of a Department of Justice
conspiracy to obstruct the House Judiciary review process; indeed,
he views the very concept of a possible conspiracy as preposterous.''
   ``The totality of this evidence demonstrates conclusively that
Mr. Olson's conduct throughout the Judiciary Committee process was
wholly inconsistent with the notion that he participated in a scheme
to obstruct Congress by secretly withholding documentary
materials,'' Olson's attorneys said.

   The army on Monday barred
journalists from the border region where Nicaraguan rebel camps are
located after two soldiers were killed by mines in the area.
   The soldiers were patrolling on foot near the town of La
Congolona, 100 miles southeast of Tegucigalpa, when they stepped on
the mines Thursday, according to armed forces spokesman Col. Manuel
Suarez Benavides.
   Military teams worked over the weekend to clear mines from a
20-square-mile area at the border, he said.
   ``The Sandinista army has intensified the mining of different
Honduran border zones with Nicaragua by making rapid incursions into
our territory with what appears to be an attitude of provocation,''
Suarez Benavides said.
   ``To avoid acts that we would later regret, the decision was made
not to permit journalists to enter Yamales.'' The area is along the
Yamales River, 102 miles east of Tegucigalpa; the road to Yamales
runs to within 200 yards of the border with Nicaragua in some places.
   Contra rebels, who have operated from camps in Honduras since
1981, also are known have planted mines when retreating across the
border.
   Nicaraguan officials had no immediate comment. The two countries
regularly exchange accusations on border incidents.
   Also Monday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Eugenio Castro Claramount
said at least 14 Hondurans are among the 1,894 former Nicaraguan
national guardsmen released last week in Nicaragua. He said they
will soon be returning to Tegucigalpa.
   The Nicaraguan army reported 20 incidents of harassment from
Honduran troops across the border from Teotecacinte, near the
Yamales area, this year. No casualties were reported.
   About 11,000 Contra rebels and their families retreated to base
camps in Honduras after the United States cut off military aid about
a year ago. They have been receiving food, medical supplies and
other non-lethal U.S. aid.
   For many years access to the camps was strictly restricted by the
Honduran government, but foreign journalists have been able to visit
the camps frequently in recent months, usually traveling there by
road from Tegucigalpa.

   Wintry weather lingered throughout much of the country Monday on
the first day of spring, with a blizzard hitting parts of Kansas and
stormy weather moving into much of the Southwest and Northeast.
   Snow and high winds in western Kansas reduced visibility to near
zero at times, closing Interstate 70 west of Oakley. A high wind
warning was issued for west central and southwestern Kansas.
   A high wind warning also was posted for northwestern Texas, and a
winter storm warning for the south Texas plains. A snow advisory was
issued for the Permian Basin of Texas and for southeastern Colorado
and the Oklahoma panhandle.
   A winter storm watch also was posted for much of New Mexico.
   Further to the east, strong thunderstorms raked southeast Texas
and western Louisiana, and rain extended from the central plains
through the Ohio Valley and the Tennessee Valley to the Appalachians.
   Although spring officially began at 10:28 a.m. EST Monday, a
winter-like storm was brewing in the Northeast.
   Snow in the lower Great Lakes region and the upper Ohio Valley
was expected to spread northeastward during the night. A winter
weather advisory was posted for the mountains and southwestern
sections of Pennsylvania, with winter storm watches posted for a
wide area ranging from Maine through New Hampshire, Vermont and
upstate New York.
   A snow advisory was posted for northern Indiana.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 12
degrees at Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to 92 degrees at McAllen, Texas.
   The national weather forecast for Tuesday called for rain from
the Rio Grande Valley of Texas through the Tennessee Valley and the
central Gulf Coast states to the mid-Atlantic coast, with
thunderstorms most likely from the central Gulf Coast to the
Carolinas. Snow was expected from the upper Ohio Valley to northern
New England, with rainshowers from the northern and central Pacific
Coast to northwest Montana. Fair to partly sunny skies were forecast
for the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures were expected to remain below 50 from the high
plains region to the northern half of the Atlantic coast; in the 20s
and lower 30s from the Dakotas through the Great Lakes region to
northern New England; in the 70s and 80s in southern Arizona,
southern and central California and from the central and eastern
Gulf Coast to the southern Atlantic coast.

   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's
88-year-old patriarch, said in a New Year message Monday that
Moslems must overcome carnal desires, but admitted being unable to
do so himself.
   Tehran television quoted him as saying: ``I hope the Iranian
nation and other Moslems throughout the world will transform
themselves so they can work for the sake of God, and not for their
own victory or their carnal desires.
   ``In his lifetime, man is afflicted with carnal desires. He needs
self-discipline, and I, as the speaker of these words, have not
succeeded in this task.''
   The Persian New Year begins March 21.
   President Ali Khamenei delivered a message stressing postwar
reconstruction and development of oil and related industries. A
U.N.-sponsored truce was reached with Iraq last August after eight
years of war.
   In the past year, he said, ``undoubtedly the most important event
was the acceptance of the cease-fire ... by Ayatollah Khomeini and
its support by the people.''
   Chief Justice Musavi Ardebili canceled New Year vacations for
judges and magistrates because of a government anti-narcotics
campaign, Tehran radio reported.
   It quoted him as saying the vacations had been canceled so judges
could continue ``stamping out malicious elements and drug
smugglers.''
   A crackdown on drugs in Iran began when a new law took effect
Jan. 21, imposing the death sentence for possession of even small
quantities. According to official figures, more than 200 offenders
have been convicted in Islamic courts and executed.
   The radio also said a budget of 9.7 trillion rials ($140 billion)
was passed by the parliament Monday and approved by the Guardian
Council, which makes sure legislation conforms with Islamic law and
the constitution.
   It said the council made amendments and deleted some items, but
it did not describe the changes.
   A report by the official Islamic Republic News Agency said the
budget included $2.5 billion in loans from abroad for repairing war
damage to the infrastructure. In the past, even during the war, Iran
avoided incurring foreign debt.

<TEXT>
   NBC correspondent Connie Chung is jumping to CBS
and Cable News Network anchor Mary Alice Williams is joining NBC in
the latest round of big-name network-hopping.
   Chung will be Sunday anchor of the ``CBS Evening News'' and
in-studio anchor for a revamped version of CBS' struggling weekly
prime-time newsmagazine ``West 57th.''
   A statement issued by NBC News President Michael Gartner said,
``We are sorry to see Connie leave the NBC news team. We made what
we believed was a fair and attractive offer to Connie. I regret that
she was unable to accept our offer, but I wish her well in her new
role at CBS.''
   Chung was a Washington correspondent with CBS from 1971-76 and
anchor at KNXT-TV, now KCBS-TV, the CBS-owned station in Los Angeles
until 1983.
   Before joining CNN at its inception in 1979, Williams was an
anchor and reporter for WNBC-TV, the NBC-owned station in New York.
   Williams will be a co-anchor and reporter on a new prime-time NBC
show, ``Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow,'' the brainchild of NBC
Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff.
   Last month, CBS lost Diane Sawyer to ABC, where she will anchor a
new prime-time news show with Sam Donaldson. Late last year, NBC
News lost one of its few recognizable stars, Chris Wallace, also to
ABC for the prime-time show.
   Chung, another of NBC's best-known stars, had been considered the
likely anchor for the new NBC show, which will probably premiere as
a monthly broadcast this summer, then join the schedule weekly early
next year.

<HEAD>ANC Vows To Step Up Struggle, Supports Winnie Mandela</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG MELLGREN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GRAN, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The African National Congress vowed Monday to
step up its military and political resistance to South Africa's
racial policies, and it expressed support for the embattled Winnie
Mandela.
   After a five-day conference of 88 leaders, the main guerrilla
group fighting the South African government also said it saw an end
in sight to apartheid.
   ``The apartheid regime is not only steeped in an irreversible
crisis, it is weakening in many ways,'' Secretary-General Alfred Nzo
told a news conference. ``The end, I think, is in sight.''
   Nzo also said the group had discussed the issue of Mrs. Mandela,
``and Winnie should be given the opportunity to continue to be the
symbol of our struggle.''
   Mrs. Mandela, wife of jailed black leader Nelson Mandela, was
sharply condemned last month when her personal bodyguards were
implicated in the alleged abduction of four black youths and the
death of one of them.
   The ANC dismissed as ``a bluff'' hints of Nelson Mandela's early
release from jail. It said an increasing number of political
opponents had been imprisoned since a state of emergency was imposed
in 1986.
   The closed-door conference _ the largest since 1986 _ was called
to review the situation in southern Africa and to discuss
anti-apartheid strategies, which Nzo said will remain unchanged.
   ``The recent election of F.W. de Klerk as leader of the ruling
National Party will not result in any significant change in policy.
His recent utterances ... about a dialogue have no substance,'' said
Nzo, who is based in Lusaka, Zambia.
   ``The situation in South Africa remains unchanged in its main
elements,'' he said. ``Accordingly we must escalate both the mass
political offensive and our armed actions.''
   Thomas Nkobi, the ANC treasurer general, said military forces
will soon begin moving out of Angola under the terms of the southern
Africa peace accord, but he would not say when or where they would
go. ``When they move, the people of the world will know,'' he said.
   Nzo said the ANC does not seek to operate from Namibia after the
South African-controlled country becomes independent.
   The South-West Africa People's Organization, which has fought a
guerrilla war in Namibia against South Africa since 1966, is widely
expected to win elections scheduled for next November.
   ``I have heard different reports. In the past SWAPO said it will
do nothing to stop the struggle against apartheid,'' Nzo said. ``The
ANC has not asked to have bases in Namibia.''
   He said the ANC will open new missions in Washington, Madrid,
Tripoli, Caracas and elsewhere to press for continued international
sanctions against Pretoria's white minority government.
   The conference was sponsored by Norway's largest labor union, LO,
with help from the Foreign Ministry.

   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Monday that a
Soviet artist is using older SS-4 missiles, not scrapped SS-20
missiles, to make a pair of sculptures that will be displayed in New
York.
   A report that appeared widely in the Soviet press last week said
sculptor Zurab Tsereteli of the southern republic of Georgia was
using pieces of the SS-20 missiles in sculptures to be placed near
the United Nations and by Riverside Church in New York.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev said the reports were
mistaken. ``The SS-20s are to be eliminated by explosion,
demolition, and after that process they don't exist anymore,'' he
told a regular news briefing.
   SS-4s, older medium-range missiles, are being cut up, and
Tsereteli received pieces of several of them, Perfiliev said.
   The missiles are being destroyed under a U.S.-Soviet agreement to
eliminate both sides' medium- and shorter-range nuclear weapons.

   Two U.S. Marine officers were sent home
because of a mock execution in which blanks were fired with machine
guns at Norwegian ``prisoners'' during a NATO exercise, an army
spokesman said Monday.
   ``It was meant as a joke, but both the American and the Norwegian
military leadership considered it to be a very bad joke,'' said Gen.
Torkel Hovland, commander of a Norwegian division that participated
in the ``Cold Winter'' maneuvers.
   American, British, Dutch and Norwegian soldiers took part in the
Arctic exercises held March 3-15.
   Hovland confirmed a report in the newspaper Fremover, published
at Harstad in northern Norway, describing what happened March 12
after the Norwegians were captured.
   ``The Norwegians were ordered executed, lined up and `shot'
one-by-one with machine-gun blanks,'' it said. ``When one Norwegian
officer among the prisoners refused to leave his car, an American
soldier put his gun inside the car's open window and fired blanks.''
   It said no one was injured and two American officers, a captain
and a lieutenant, were held responsible. Their identities were not
revealed.
   Maj. Yngve Jessen, a spokesman for the maneuvers, told the
Norwegian news agency NTB the incident violated ``all regulations of
the Hague and the Geneva conventions about treatment of prisoners.
We can't exclude that the American captain involved will be reduced
in rank or even be dismissed from service.''

<TEXT>
   It might have been a warning or a prank, but the
``gift'' someone left for reputed mobster John Gotti in front of his
Little Italy hangout on Monday was not a workable bomb, police said.
   When bomb squad officers opened a plastic box they found on the
step of the Ravenite Social Club, they at first described what they
found inside as an explosive powder.
   But further analysis disclosed the powder to be two pounds of
salt and an ounce of gunpowder. Given such a small amount of powder,
plus faulty batteries and wiring, ``it appears the device would not
have detonated,'' Chief of Detectives Robert Colangelo told
reporters. If it had, he added, it probably couldn't have done much
damage.
   Asked to explain the incident, he said: ``We could assume it's
either a message to Gotti that perhaps he is vulnerable or that his
club is vulnerable. It could have been a prank. It could have been a
lot of things.''
   A man telephoned the police department's organized crime bureau
shortly after 5 a.m. and said, ``There is a gift for John Gotti at
the social club.'' He did not give his name, but identified the club
as the Ravenite in lower Manhattan.
   Police Inspector Richard Mayronne said the device included a
10-inch aluminum bottle packed with powder. The bottle was partially
contained in a 4-by-6 inch plastic box which contained batteries
wired to a circuit board with an electric timer. The bottle, which
contained the powder and a coil, protruded from inside the box.
   The non-bomb was the latest slap at Gotti, reputed boss of the
Gambino crime family, who is besieged by law enforcers and mob
rivals.
   In January a battalion of police officers, some of them posing as
street vendors, arrested Gotti on the street near the Ravenite. They
threw him against a wall, patted him down and read him his rights.
Gotti, apparently stunned to be treated like a common criminal,
asked, ``What's wrong with you guys?''
   He was charged with ordering the shooting of a union official who
had himself ordered the trashing of a restaurant owned by a Gambino
family member.
   Meanwhile, prosecutors in a Mafia trial in Newark say members of
the Genovese crime family, headed by Vincent ``Chin'' Gigante,
plotted to kill Gotti to stop him from infringing on their rackets.
FBI agents, in fact, warned Gotti in 1987 that he was the subject of
such a murder plot. Gigante and Gotti are virtually the only major
New York Mafia figures to have avoided long prison sentences.
   The Ravenite, which has been the subject of intense surveillance
by investigators, is a simple storefront that sits inconspicuously
on a street of colorful, lively Italian restaurants. The club has
long been frequented by members of the Gambino crime family, notably
Aniello Dellacroce, a professional murderer who became one of the
family's two most powerful leaders.
   Dellacroce was Gotti's patron, and after the older man died in
1985 Gotti allegedly ordered the murder of Gambino boss Paul
Castellano and seized control of the family.

   Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South
Africa met Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega on Monday and said he asked
Noriega if he would guarantee freedom of the press, free elections
and human rights in Panama.
   Tutu indicated that Noriega responded positively to the requests
made by him and his delegation of Anglican leaders, but Tutu did not
answer reporters' questions about Noriega's answers.
   As chief of Defense Forces, Noriega is Panama's de facto leader.
He was not available to speak with reporters after the one-hour
private meeting.
   Tutu, the black prelate who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for
his efforts against South Africa's racial segregation policies,
spoke briefly with reporters.
   Panama has elections scheduled for May 7 to elect a new president
and two vice presidents. Panamanians also will elect all 67 members
of the National Assembly and 510 municipal officials.
   Noriega is not a candiate for president.
   The U.S. government imposed sanctions against Panama last year,
throwing this country's economy into serious disarray, in an effort
to force Noriega to quit as military chief after a U.S. grand jury
indicted him on drug trafficking and money laundering charges.
Noriega denied the charges.
   Tutu and his fellow Anglican leaders visited Nicaragua for five
days before arriving in Panama on Saturday. Tutu returns to South
Africa on Tuesday.

   Rep. Newt Gingrich, striving to prevent damage
to his race for the No. 2 leadership post among House Republicans,
promised Monday to provide full accounting of his unusual book
promotion deal.
   ``We'll check with our attorney and get it out into the open,''
said the Georgia congressman, trying to distinguish his book deal
from the one that led to ethics charges brought by Gingrich against
House Speaker Jim Wright.
   ``We were not trying to make a quick buck or arrange any
sweetheart deal,'' he said at a news conference. Although the
limited partnership formed for promotion was unusual in publishing,
it was ``much like the arrangement used for producing and promoting
a Broadway play,'' he said.
   Wright, D-Texas, clearly reveled in the attention being paid to
his nemesis.
   ``People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones,'' he
said.
   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., said Gingrich should
expect to face an inquiry himself.
   ``He should anticipate somebody filing charges... and he'll have
to live by the same standard he has set for others,'' Coelho said.
   Gingrich made ``a plea to you and the press and the American
public to listen and understand the truth,'' he said, but others
``asked for the same thing and Newt wasn't always interested,''
Coelho said.
   Three House Democrats _ Reps. Barney Frank of Massachusetts,
Martin Sabo of Minnesota and Lawrence Smith of Florida _ sent a
letter to Gingrich late Monday asking that he answer a list of
questions they said are raised by the promotion deal.
   The letter says the questions involve House rules, financial
disclosure requirements, the Federal Election Campaign Act and the
Internal Revenue Service code.
   An article in Monday's Washington Post said 21 investors put up
$5,000 apiece to promote Gingrich's 1984 book, ``Window of
Opportunity.'' In exchange, the investors were to receive 45 percent
of the profits, but there weren't any.
   They did, however, gain tax benefits from the arrangement, the
article said.
   Gingrich's wife, Marianne, who co-authored the book, received
``less than $10,000'' from the $105,000 for her work in arranging
the deal and coordinating the promotional efforts. Her tax benefit
amounted to $26, Gingrich said.
   She said the House ethics committee was consulted before the
partnership contracts were signed, and their earnings were fully
disclosed as House rules require.
   ``I did a lot of work,'' she told reporters, adding that the book
was still for sale and reciting a toll-free number if anybody wanted
to buy.
   Contrasting his volume with the one Wright has privately
published and sold, Gingrich said his book was ``a real book, 272
pages long, with real ideas, not a collection of House floor
speeches and memories,'' and it was sold in regular bookstores.
   Gingrich said he held the news conference as soon as he could
because he wanted to quickly dispel any notion of wrongdoing in the
midst of his campaign for Minority Whip.
   Gingrich is one of two announced candidates for the post, which
became vacant when Dick Cheney was confirmed last week as Secretary
of Defense. Rep. Edward Madigan, R-Ill., is also campaigning for the
position.
   Gingrich said Monday he believes he has a majority of the 174
House Republicans committed to him, and that the article about his
book deal would not hurt, except that it was a distraction for a few
hours.
   Meantime, the House ethics committee convened for its first full
day of deliberations in Wright's case, following three weeks of
presentations and counter-arguments from its special counsel and
Wright's attorney.
   Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., said the deliberations would go
through Wednesday, but added he could not predict whether final
decisions on the charges against Wright would be completed by then.
If not, the panel would reconvene early next month following the
Easter recess, he said.
   Rep. John T. Myers of Indiana, the senior Republican on the
panel, said he expects the panel will act to release the full report
of its independent counsel, Richard Phelan, but added that decision
had not yet been made.
   Both men said they expected that whatever the final outcome, it
would be bipartisan and not be the result of a polarized committee.
The 12-member panel, unique in the House, is evenly divided between
Democrats and Republicans.
   Both also said they did not expect the GOP leadership race to
impact their deliberations, and Myers said he did not believe
Gingrich's book promotion deal would be relevant.
   ``They're two separate issues,'' he said. ``That is not an issue
before the ethics committee and hopefully it will not be.'' Later,
asked about the impact of the book deal on Gingrich's chances, Myers
added: ``I don't see how they can help any. Mr. Gingrich, it poses,
I think, some problems for him.''
   ABC-TV reported Monday night that Wright was a silent partner
with a major savings and loan operator in a Florida land development
deal at the same time Wright was involved in legislation affecting
the savings and loan industry.
   The deal involved a 20-acre parcel of land near Orlando, Fla.,
according to ABC. The land was subdivided into housing lots and
Wright tripled his money in three years, making a $90,000 profit,
ABC said. One of the other buyers was RIchard Swann, an Orlando
lawyer who was chairman of the city's largest savings and loan, the
network said.
   Mark Johnson, a spokesman for Wright, ``the ABC story was utterly
false. There was not even the slightest potential for a conflict of
interest as ABC suggested. The whole underlying premise of that
story is that there some connection to the S&amp;L issue, and it's just
utterly and totally false.''

   A judge's last-minute intervention kept Randall
Dale Adams in prison Monday as he was about to walk free after
serving 12 years in prison on a controversial conviction for the
killing of a police officer.
   District Judge Ron Chapman reset Adams' bond at $100,000,
superseding another judge's decision to release Adams simply on a
promise to appear in court.
   The action, which culminated an afternoon of confusion among
prosecutors, judges and defense attorneys, came after the District
Attorney's office filed a motion to have state District Judge Larry
Baraka removed from the case.
   In another late development, prosecutors said for the first time
that they were prepared to retry Adams since his conviction was
overturned after being questioned in the film ``The Thin Blue Line.''
   ``We are ready for a trial right now,'' said Assistant District
Attorney Winfield Scott. ``We could call and crank up this trial
right now if you wanted us to. We're fully prepared to proceed with
the trial.''
   Prior to Scott's comments, it was unknown whether prosecutors
felt they had enough evidence to seek a new trail.
   Vance's office, in filing the motion to have Baraka removed,
charged that the judge was biased when he ruled there was not enough
evidence in the original 1977 case to convict Adams.
   Judge Chapman said 54th District Judge Carl Anderson would hear
the motion Tuesday afternoon. If the judge rules that Baraka should
not be removed from the case, Adams could be released under the
$50,000 personal recognizance bond that Baraka set for him earlier
Monday.
   But Chapman said, ``Once the motion to recuse is filed, Judge
Baraka has no other authority to do anything further on the case.''
   Chapman and Baraka are both state judges, but Chapman presides as
administrative judge for the region.
   Defense attorney Randy Schaffer said Adams did not have the 10
percent necessary to post bail on the $100,000 bond. Adams remained
held in the Lew Sterrett Justice Center Monday night.
   ``I guarantee it's not tonight, and I don't know when, if ever,''
Schaffer said on whether Adams would be able to post bail.
   District Attorney John Vance said, ``I don't think Randall Dale
Adams ought to be out on the street. I think anybody that's indicted
for killing a police officer is a danger to society.''
   Adams, 40, has steadfastly maintained his innocence in the 1976
shooting death of Dallas police officer Robert Wood. He originally
was sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted to life in
prison in 1980.
   His conviction was unanimously overturned by the Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals on March 1.
   The appeals court reviewed the case on the recommendation of
Baraka, and agreed with his ruling that Adams did not receive a fair
trial.
   Adams' case had been resurrected with the help of New York
filmmaker Errol Morris, whose documentary ``The Thin Blue Line''
suggested the slaying was committed by the prosecution's chief
witness, David Harris.
   Harris, who is on death row for another slaying, was not charged
in the Wood shooting. He testified at Adams' 1977 trial that Adams
was driving a car that the police officer pulled over, and that
Adams shot the officer.
   However, in a hearing before Baraka last December, Harris
testified that Adams did not kill Wood.
   Schaffer also presented evidence at the December hearing that
prosecutors had suppressed evidence at Adams' trial.
   The district attorney's office earlier Monday filed a motion
asking that Adams' bond hearing be presented before a different
judge. Baraka rejected the motion.
   ``There are no lengths they will not go to to pursue this man,''
Schaffer said. Prosecutors were not present in court, much to the
annoyance of Schaffer.
   ``I've been to three goat ropings and a county fair and I've
never seen this kind of childish behavior,'' Schaffer said.
   Before Chapman's decision, Schaffer had said Adams planned to
join his family in Ohio and Morris, the filmmaker, called Baraka's
release order a ``wonderful step toward exoneration.''

<HEAD>Denver Symphony Cancels Rest of Season</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Denver Symphony Orchestra's 1989 spring season
will end early with Saturday's concert because of a nearly $1
million shortfall, orchestra officials announced Monday.
   Symphony officials said they were canceling eight concerts
remaining in the 1989 spring season, but said they hoped to
reorganize the orchestra in time for the 1989-1990 season. They
planned to have a proposal in hand by Aug. 1.
   ``We looked at every possible alternative before we were forced
to make this decision,'' John Low, chairman of the symphony board,
said at a news conference.
   ``Obviously, we cannot continue to run without cash in the bank,
and at this point in time we can't run until June,'' he said.
``We'll be back next year. ... We may have a reduced budget and a
smaller season, but we're going to offer the same quality
performances the Denver community demands and deserves.''
   Last fall, a last-ditch community fund-raising campaign saved the
symphony from a possible bankruptcy. But since then symphony
officials have said they faced a $985,000 shortfall.
   People holding tickets for canceled concerts may receive credit
for next season's concerts, but no cash refunds will be paid,
officials said.
   The DSO said in a statement that conductor Philippe Entremont,
who was in Paris, would not be at the last concerts scheduled
Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
   Michelle Patrick, a DSO spokeswoman, said it was Entremont's
decision not to perform this weekend. She said she did not know if
he would return to the symphony.

   A key figure in the investigation of a Defense
Department purchasing scandal was hospitalized Monday, according to
his attorney, Gerard F. Treanor Jr.
   Treanor said he had been authorized by William Parkin, a private
consultant, and his family to say Parkin was in Alexandria, Va.,
Hospital but could give no further details.
   However, NBC-TV reported that Parkin, who had been considering a
plea of guilty, had attempted suicide by taking an overdose of pills.
   A hosspital nursing supervisor, who declined to give her name,
said Parkin ``was doing fine.''
   In the trial, scheduled to start March 27 in U.S. District Court
in Alexandria, prosecutors will attempt to prove that Teledyne
Electronics of Newbury Park, Calif., and three of its employees paid
Parkin to obtain details about a $100 million Navy radar contract.
   Parkin is accused of paying another consultant, Fred Lackner of
Woodland Hills, Calif., who, in turn, gave money to Stuart Berlin, a
one-time Navy procurement specialist, prosecutors say.
   All the defendants have pleaded innocent to the charges, which
are contained in an indictment unsealed on Jan. 6.
   Parkin worked with a number of defense contractors including
Unisys, Hazeltine, Northrup and Teledyne Electronics.

<HEAD>Baseball Investigating Charges Against Pete Rose</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE KAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Sports Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PLANT CITY, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Baseball great Pete Rose is under
investigation for serious allegations, baseball Commissioner Peter
Ueberroth said Monday, and one source said the Cincinnati Reds
manager faces possible suspension for gambling.
   The commissioner's office, in an unusual and carefully worded
statement, did not say what the allegations were. Rose admits to a
fondness for betting on horse and dog races, but has never been
accused of betting on baseball.
   The usually effusive Rose declined comment on the investigation.
``If something happens, when it happens, I'll talk about it then,''
he said.
   The commissioner's statement was issued jointly with A. Bartlett
Giamatti, the National League president who has been selected to
replace Ueberroth.
   ``The office of the commissioner, which was founded to preserve
the integrity of the game, has for several months been conducting a
full inquiry into serious allegations involving Mr. Pete Rose,'' the
statement said.
   ``When the commissioner's office has completed its inquiry, the
commissioner will consider the information presented and take
whatever action is warranted by the facts consistent with the rules
and procedures of major league baseball,'' it continued.
   Rose flew to New York from spring training on Feb. 20 to meet
with Ueberroth, Giamatti and several lawyers. At the time, the
commissioner's office said the matter was private, but several
published reports said gambling was discussed.
   Not until Monday did baseball acknowledge it was investigating
Rose. And one baseball source, who asked not to be identified, said
that the statement ``was a prelude to what's going to happen in the
next couple of days.'' He said Rose might be suspended for gambling
activities.
   John M. Dowd, a trial lawyer with the Washington firm of Heron,
Burchette, Ruckert &amp; Rothwell, is leading the investigation as
special counsel to the commissioner.
   The 47-year-old Dowd headed a Justice Department organized crime
task force from 1972 to 1978 and led investigations of the FBI and
of former Pennsylvania Rep. Dan Flood. Dowd said Monday that he had
been investigating Rose for about a month and did not know how much
longer the inquiry would last.
   He would not discuss the nature of the investigation.
   Baseball personnel are prohibited from betting on baseball games,
but they are allowed to make legal bets at tracks, a common pasttime
for baseball players and managers. Despite that, baseball personnel
have been suspended for associating with gamblers.
   On one occasion last year, Rose said: ``I'm not supposed to
gamble. They talked to me about that.''
   Rose was suspended for 30 days last year for a scuffle with
umpire Dave Pallone. It was the longest suspension given a manager
in 41 years.
   Rose, who has been Cincinnati's manager since August 1986, holds
what is considered one of baseball's most unassailable records _ the
most hits in a career, 4,256. He also has played in more games than
any other player _ 3,562.

<TEXT>
   Alfredo Cristiani, who tried to
erase memories of his right-wing party's links to death squads that
killed thousands of Salvadorans, celebrated his presidential victory
Monday over the U.S.-backed government.
   Fidel Chavez Mena, candidate of the incumbent Christian
Democrats, conceded defeat and told a news conference, ``I have
called him (Cristiani) personally to congratulate him and express my
desire that God illuminate him in governing the country.''
   U.S. Ambassador William Walker said the election result was not a
defeat for U.S. policy. In Washington, the State Department said it
was prepared to support the new Salvadoran government but only if it
protects democracy and human rights.
   Cristiani, of the Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, will
take over from President Jose Napoleon Duarte on June 1. Duarte, one
of Washington's staunchest allies, had been unable to end a
9-year-old civil war with leftist rebels that has taken an estimated
70,000 lives.
   Duarte, barred by the constitution from seeking re-election, has
said his proudest moment will come when he hands over power to an
elected successor. Duarte suffers from terminal liver cancer.
   Cristiani immediately urged all political parties to ``put down
their political banners and unite to ensure progress.'' He told a
Monday news conference that his party ``doesn't want a sectarian
government.''
   He also thanked Chavez Mena for accepting ``in a very democratic
manner the results of the elections.''
   The Central Elections Council said Arena had 53.81 percent of the
576,339 votes counted from Sunday's election, compared to 36.59
percent for the centrist Christian Democrats. Trailing were the
conservative National Conciliation Party with 4.21 percent and the
leftist Democratic Convergence at 3.2 percent. Other votes were
divided among three smaller parties.
   ``Arena has won and I congratulate Alfredo Cristiani publicly,''
said Ricardo Perdomo, the Christian Democratic chairman of the
council. He said final official results would not be announced until
a recount is concluded Thursday.
   Agriculture Minister Antonio Morales Erlich estimated voter
turnout at between 850,000 and 900,000 _ one of the lowest in
Salvadoran history and less than half of those eligible. Walker, the
U.S. ambassador, had said a turnout of 60 percent or better would
represent a defeat for the guerrilla strategy.
   Chavez Mena conceded that Cristiani would win more than 50
percent of the vote, thus enabling him to evade a runoff election
that would have been held next month between the top two contendes.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said: ``Our
relationship with that new government will depend on its adherence
to democracy and respect for human rights, the twin pillars of our
approach to El Salvador,'' said department spokesman Charles Redman.
   Redman praised the Salvadoran people for braving ``violence and
terror'' by leftist guerrillas who, he said, tried harder to disrupt
Sunday's balloting than any other election here in seven years.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the elections
``represent a strong desire by the people of El Salvador for the
ability to participate in the election process.'' But he said the
United States was ``concerned about the level of guerrilla attacks
and human rights abuses'' during the balloting.
   The United States has supported El Salvador with $3.5 billion in
aid this decade, and some congressmen have said the results leave
much to be desired.
   Cristiani, a 41-year-old coffee-grower and businessman, said late
Sunday he ``would be the president of all 5 million Salvadorans. We
are going to unify this people in order to pull ourselves out of
this profound crisis.''
   Arena was linked in the early 1980s to rightist death squads
blamed for the murders of tens of thousands of suspected leftists.
Cristiani contends the party has changed significantly and his
candidacy was evidence of that.
   But fanatical rightists remain prominent in the party, including
party founder Roberto d'Aubuisson, who was once called a
``pathological killer'' by a U.S. ambassador. D'Aubuisson has
repeatedly denied links to death squads.
   D'Aubuisson, a former army major who was cashiered in 1980 for
allegedly plotting a coup, is an Arena legislator. Although he holds
no formal party post, he was the party's top drawing card at
election rallies, where he was introduced as ``maximum leader.''
   The election marked the first time Salvadoran voters had a chance
to replace an incumbent civilian government with a distinctly
different government.
   Guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front tried
to thwart the voting with a transport ban across the
Massachusetts-sized country and attacks on military positions in 12
of the country's 14 provinces.
   The insurgents lifted the ban Monday and said that the high
absentee rate proved their contention that El Salvador's problems
could not be solved without their participation.
   At least 29 guerrillas and soldiers were killed in Sunday's
fighting, as well as two civilians, according to Col. Emilio Ponce,
chief of the joint chiefs of staff. Ponce told The Associated Press
the attacks constituted ``a nationwide offensive.''
   Three journalists _ two Salvadorans and a Dutchman _ also were
killed and a fourth seriously wounded by security forces over
election weekend.

<HEAD>`Diff'rent Strokes' Actor Smoked Coke Before Shooting, Witness Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Todd Bridges, once a star of the TV series
``Diff'rent Strokes,'' was ordered Monday to stand trial for
attempted murder following testimony that he was high on cocaine
every day for weeks before shooting a convicted drug dealer.
   Municipal Judge David Horwitz, presiding at the preliminary
hearing, determined there was enough evidence to try Bridges and set
the 23-year-old former actor's Superior Court arraignment for Friday.
   The judge rejected a plea from Bridges' attorney to reduce the
charge on grounds that Bridges was too drugged to form the intent to
shoot his alleged victim.
   ``The defendant is grossly overcharged,'' said attorney Johnnie
Cochran, who noted that witnesses said Bridges ingested rock cocaine
at least four times the day of the shooting at a house that was a
cocaine hangout.
   Kenneth Clay, the victim of the shooting, described the
23-year-old Bridges as ``based out'' from freebasing _ smoking
cocaine _ when the shooting occurred Feb. 2.
   ``It was the worst I seen him,'' said Clay, 25. ``He looked like
his eyes were about to jump out of his head. He'd lost a lot of
weight, just wasn't hisself.''
   Clay described himself as a bodyguard at the house in
south-central Los Angeles, where Bridges was living. He said he had
seen Bridges have apparent epileptic seizures after consuming large
amounts of cocaine, and once stuffed a towel in Bridges' mouth to
keep him from swallowing his tongue.
   On Feb. 2, Clay said, Bridges came to the house and they argued.
He said Bridges left and later returned with a gun and a friend,
Harvey Duckett. When Bridges fired the gun, Clay said, Duckett urged
him on, saying, ``Shoot him. Shoot him.''
   Duckett, who has a long record of felony convictions, pleaded no
contest to being an accessory in the case. However, he denied Clay's
account and said he didn't arrive until the shooting was over.
   Authorities allege that Bridges shot Clay eight times. The actor,
who appeared in jail garb Monday, has been unable to post $2 million
bail. Horwitz refused a request from Cochran to lower the bail.

   The Transport Department told airlines and airports
Monday there is a ``high and continuing risk'' of more devices like
the bomb in a radio-cassette player that destroyed Pan Am Flight
103, killing 270 people.
   The department said it sent a telex as a reminder of its previous
warnings, which have been the subject of controversy, and to suggest
new safety measures. Transport officials would not elaborate on the
statement.
   Pressure grew for the government to explain whether the Flight
103 disaster on Dec. 21 could have been averted with better
dissemination of warnings and information about bombing equipment
found before the explosion over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   Opposition politicians have demanded Transport Secretary Paul
Channon resign because of how he handled events before the bombing,
which killed all 259 people on the Boeing 747 and 11 on the ground.
   The Evening Standard newspaper said police believe the bomb
contained only one or two pounds of explosives, but its location
near a weakened seam in the baggage hold increased its effect.
   Inspector Tom McCullough of the Lockerbie police, who are
conducting the investigation, refused comment beyond saying the
report was ``most likely speculation by the press.''
   A source the Evening Standard did not identify was quoted as
saying: ``If the bomb had been almost anywhere else it might have
killed half a dozen people or maybe even just shredded some bags.''
   In Washington, a member of Congress said Pan Am still is not
following many anti-terrorism measures an Israeli security firm
suggested to it more than two years ago.
   Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., said in a letter to the Federal
Aviation Administration the security consultant concluded the
airline was not careful enough in checking baggage, did a poor job
of questioning passengers boarding planes and was slow in reacting
to warnings of possible terrorist activity.
   She quoted from reports KPI Inc. gave Pan Am in 1986 after
reviewing Pan Am security at nine airports, including Frankfurt and
London's Heathrow Airport. Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt and
changed planes at Heathrow.
   One of the KPI reports said: ``Pan Am is highly vulnerable to
most forms of terrorist attack. The fact that no major disaster has
occurred to date is merely providential.''
   Opposition lawmakers in London continued claiming Monday that the
public was not given a full explanation of events before the
bombing. Channon made no comment.
   He canceled a speech to an airline magazine conference and did
not address Parliament after the second rejection of an opposition
Labor Party request to force him to speak.
   Labor and other opposition leaders want Channon to explain why a
warning that might have alerted Pan Am to the type of bomb used was
not sent until after the disaster.
   It was the second of two issued after the discovery Oct. 26 by
West Germany of explosives hidden in a radio-cassette player in the
possession of suspect Palestinians.
   Monday's statement by the Transport Department said: ``Since the
discovery in Germany in October last year of an explosive device
hidden in a radio, we have considered it possible that there might
be other similar devices in existence in Germany or elsewhere.
   ``In view of the high and continuing risk for electronic devices,
the department has today by telex issued a further reminder to
airports and airlines drawing attention to the guidance issued
earlier and suggesting some further steps that should be taken.''
   The first warnings were issued in November but Pan Am says it did
not receive the second, more detailed, bulletin until Jan. 17.
   Channon's department said the fact that U.S. airlines were not
told until January, a delay it said occurred because color
photographs were being prepared, was not important because the FAA
and West Germany provided similar information a month earlier.
   Channon also has been criticized for failing to tell Parliament
of either warning until last week and failing to order tighter
airport security.
   Roland Bachmeier of the West German Interior Ministry said Monday
that British experts attended a briefing Nov. 15 on the
radio-cassette player found in West Germany and ``they were in
possession of all the information.''
   FAA spokesman John Leyden said in Washington on Monday that his
agency did not send a photograph of the explosive device to airlines.
   He said the FAA's Nov. 18 security alert to carriers contained
technical details of the bomb and how it would work. He said it
wasn't until later that the West Germans developed material on the
bomb that included photographs.
   U.S. carriers serving London received the photograph from British
authorities, he said.

<HEAD>Cabinet Told It Must Talk to PLO To End Uprising, Shamir Stands Firm</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: LEADS thruout to move up reports of Cabinet intelligence briefing
on PLO. No pickup.</HEAD>

   Top army and intelligence officials told the
Cabinet that Israel must deal with the PLO if it wants to reach a
settlement with Palestinians and end the uprising in the occupied
territories, news reports said Monday.
   The reports came as Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir opened a
conference of world Jewish leaders with a call for solidarity and
won a standing ovation for equating the PLO to the biblical
murderers of the Jews.
   The daily newspapers Haaretz and Yediot Ahronot said ``authorized
elements of appraisal'' _ believed to be military and intelligence
officials _ concluded the Palestine Liberation Organization has made
substantive changes and wants a ``realistic political settlement.''
   That assessment was given to Shamir's Cabinet, along with the
judgment that no dialogue with the Palestinians was possible without
the PLO, the newspapers said.
   According to the reports, the intelligence sources said the
Palestinian uprising could continue for years and be kept at
manageable levels by the military, but it would not end without a
political solution.
   Avi Pazner, a spokesman for Shamir, said the reports were
inaccurate and misleading but would not comment further.
   A succession of Israeli governments have refused to deal with the
PLO, which Israel views as a terrorist group. However, some doves in
the center-left Labor Party have recently advocated talking to the
PLO as the only way to resolve the Palestinian problem.
   Shamir made it clear at the conference he had not softened in his
approach to the PLO.
   ``We have the power and determination to confront the Hamans of
this generation and to expose their deception, their double-talk,
and to rid the world of their venom and ideology once and for all,''
Shamir said.
   Haman plotted to exterminate the Jews at the time of the Persian
king Xerxes, the Book of Esther says.
   ``At times like this, when our people's desperate yearning for
peace is questioned by some, we want our sisters and brothers to
come forward and explode this blasphemy,'' Shamir declared. ``We may
have our differences on how to achieve our dream of peace, but we
are united ... that peace is our goal.''
   In prepared remarks handed out earlier to reporters, Shamir said
agreeing to a Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip would not solve the problem.
   ``Our government is united in its opposition to the creation of a
Palestinian Arab state west of the River Jordan,'' he said. ``We are
opposed to negotiations with the PLO because it will inevitably lead
to a demand for a state.''
   Israel radio said some delegates rose at an earlier closed
meeting to recommend negotiations with the PLO.
   President Chaim Herzog opened the conference of 1,100 Jewish
leaders from 30 countries.
   ``We dare not underestimate the feelings expressed in the unrest,
nor should we ... expect it to simply fade away,'' he said of the
Palestinian uprising that began more than 15 months ago, in which
403 Palestinians and Israelis have been killed.
   ``There is no way but peace, no solution but through open, free,
bilateral negotiations.
   ``This requires emergence of a fearless, sober Palestinian
leadership ... which will abandon negation of Israel's right to
exist, will abandon the path of violence and terror and will enter
into negotiations without preconditions.''
   A call for talks with the PLO by Deputy Finance Minister Yossi
Beilin, an aide to Labor leader Shimon Peres brought criticism from
members of Shamir's conservative Likud bloc and predictions of an
end to the Labor-Likud coalition.
   Peres also suggested the coalition partners might divide over the
peace issue.
   ``I think in the coming months we shall have to make up our
mind,'' he said on Israel radio. ``If we can find a joint solution,
fine. If not, we will have to make an historic choice.''
   In Baghdad, Iraq, PLO chairman Yasser Arafat told a news
conference Israel government is using a plan to halt the uprising
that consists of ``escalating oppressive measures and intensifying
the iron-fist polices against our people, while ... offering some
new ideas on a settlement to the conflict ... aimed at distracting
world opinion.''
   He denied reports the United States asked the PLO to halt
military operations against Israel as a condition of continuing a
dialogue that began in December. Washington lifted a 13-year ban on
dealing with the PLO after Arafat publicly renounced terrorism and
recognized Israel's right to exist.
   Arafat said the PLO has the right to conduct ``all kinds of
struggle'' against Israel, but indicated recent attacks were mounted
by rival Palestinian factions to embarrass him.
   Israeli forces repelled four guerrilla incursions last week,
including two from Lebanon and one each from Jordan and Egypt. Five
guerrillas and one Israeli soldier were killed.
   Arafat said PLO officials meeting in Tunis on March 29 with U.S.
Ambassador Robert Pelletreau will ask for active American
involvement in efforts to convene an international peace conference
on the Middle East peace conference.

<HEAD>Former Minister Served Subpoena in Wife Attack Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Methodist minister found financially
liable for an attack that has left his wife comatose said he will
honor a subpoena he was confronted with when he came to town to
visit his children.
   Walker Railey told KDFW-TV in Dallas on Sunday that he has agreed
to make his financial records available to the attorney who
represents his wife's parents.
   Railey was served the subpoena Saturday morning as he approached
the home of a friend who has custody of his two children. Railey
said he was in town from California to help his children celebrate
their March birthdays.
   No criminal charges have been filed in the April 21, 1987, attack
on Peggy Railey. But in a civil suit filed by Mrs. Railey's parents
against Railey, a state district judge awarded nearly $18 million in
a default judgment. Railey was served the suit twice, but never
responded to the allegation that he attacked his wife, though he
denied it out of court.
   Despite the judge's ruling, Mrs. Railey's parents, William and
Billie Joe Nicolai, have yet to collect any money from Railey.
   Bill Arnold, the attorney for the Nicolais, subpoenaed Railey for
questioning about his financial status last week.
   ``This is just part of the process. The judge found him liable
for trying to kill his wife,'' said Arnold said. ``This is just the
next step in trying to find what assets he had. It will never make
Peggy Railey whole, but it's the only thing we have left to do.''
   Railey said he didn't respond to the earlier subpoenas because
``I had nothing to gain in the suit and I didn't have the money to
go to court.''
   Railey has denied any knowledge of the attack that left his wife
in a coma. Mrs. Railey is in a nursing home and doctors say she is
not expected to recover.
   Railey has said he was working late the night of the attack and
returned to find his wife near death. But there were several
inconsistencies in the information Railey provided to police about
his whereabouts on the night of the attack.
   Eight days after the attack he took an overdose of pills on the
morning police wanted to question him. He wrote a note saying he
felt besieged by demons.
   Railey, then pastor of the First United Methodist Church in
Dallas, eventually surrendered his church credentials, citing
increasing stress from the attack and the investigation.
   Later, he turned custody of his children over to friends and
moved to California.

   Ships searched the Gulf of Mexico around two
badly burned oil platforms Monday but found no trace of seven men
missing after explosions and fires swept through the platforms
Sunday night.
   Thirty-five men escaped the blazing platforms, according to the
Coast Guard. Ten of those were injured, two critically.
   The side-by-side oil production platforms, which were connected
by catwalks, erupted in flames about 7:30 p.m. Sunday. The Coast
Guard said men were working on natural gas lines at the time of the
fires, but a spokesman for owner Atlantic Richfield Co. said the
cause was unknown Monday.
   ``There was work going on,'' said company spokesman Earl Sims,
``but we don't know if it was the cause.''
   Sims had no assessment of loss and said he did not know how
severely the two platforms were damaged.
   ARCO identified five of its employees who were among the seven
missing. It said the other two were employees of contractors working
aboard the rigs.
   The missing ARCO workers were Richard Freeman Jr. of Meadville,
Miss.; James R. Gibbs of Elba, Ala.; Doyle Henson Jr. of DeRidder,
La.; Barry Pritchard of Lafayette, La., and J.B. Suharto, an
Indonesian on assignment with ARCO in Lafayette. The two contractors
were not identified.
   Both the Coast Guard and ARCO suspended their search after
sundown Monday. Quartermaster 1st Class Fred Kephart said the Coast
Guard was deciding whether to resume searching Tuesday morning.
   Sims said ARCO and other rig operators in the area would continue
searching Tuesday, but ``at a reduced level,'' with just two boats
at their disposal.
   Sims said searchers boarded one of the platforms during the day,
but found no survivors or bodies.
   The other platform, the one where the fire started, was much more
badly damaged. ``There is some question about the integrity of the
structure and whether we can get on it in a safe manner,'' said
Sims. ``We'll be looking at that tomorrow.''
   The two platforms, just off the southeast tip of Louisiana, were
about 50 to 100 feet apart, with living quarters on one.
   Coast Guard Petty Officer Bob Morehead said 42 people were
believed to be aboard the ARCO platforms when the fires broke out.
Helicopters and boats rescued the survivors, some of whom jumped
directly into the water while others fled the platforms in covered,
capsule-like life boats.
   Morehead said an oil slick two miles long and about 100 yards
wide extended from the structures.
   The 10 injured men were taken to West Jefferson Hospital in
Marrero, a New Orleans suburb, said spokeswoman Lynne Pourciau.
Eight were suffering from burns and two others from multiple
injuries.

   Local and international
journalists Monday mourned three colleagues killed while covering
the election and demanded that government and rebel forces commit
themselves to respect reporters' lives.
   More than 1,000 journalists were in El Salvador for Sunday's
presidential election, and many joined in funeral processions Monday
for the two Salvadorans slain by security forces. A Dutch cameraman
was killed when army troops attacked a guerrilla-held village.
   The armed forces insisted the weekend slayings were isolated
incidents but announced an army corporal had been arrested in one of
the killings.
   Col. Emilio Ponce, head of the joint chiefs of staff, said the
killings did not demonstrate a policy to hinder journalists.
   Air force troopers killed Roberto Navas, 30, and seriously
wounded Luis Galdamez, 34, near a roadblock on the outskirts of San
Salvador Saturday night. Both were photographers for the Reuter news
agency.
   The armed forces said the two were on Navas' motorcycle and
stopped at one roadblock but drove through another checkpoint.
Galdamez said they stopped at a checkpoint and identified themselves
and then were shot after proceeding.
   Mauricio Pineda, a 26-year-old soundman for a local television
station, was killed Sunday morning by a soldier in the eastern
province of San Miguel. The army acknowledged Pineda was shot
without provocation and said a corporal implicated in the killing
was under arrest and would be turned over to civilian authorities
for trial.
   Cornel Lagrouw, 30, a camerman for the Dutch television network
IKON, was fatally wounded during a gunfight Sunday between rebels
and troops in San Francisco Javier, a town 70 miles east of San
Salvador.
   Journalists with Lagrouw said he was standing next to some
guerrillas when he was struck in the chest by a bullet fired from an
army position.
   The local Association of Correspondents did not blame the army
for the shooting but condemned the crew of an air force helicopter
that jounalists said fired at the car they were using to take the
dying Lagrouw to a hospital.
   The journalists said the car was flying white flags and was
identified as a news vehicle with large letters ``TV'' taped on the
windshield, roof and sides.
   About 300 journalists and other friends and relatives were in the
procession Monday morning as Navas' body was taken to a San Salvador
cemetery.
   Many reporters also attended the afternoon ceremony for Pineda.
   Lagrouw was a resident of Nicaragua, and Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega sent condolences Monday to the Nicaraguan Association
of Foreign Correspondents. Lagrow was a member of the association.
   The statement by the Salvadoran Association of Correspondents
said:
   ``Our efforts in zones of conflict to keep the people informed
demands respect and guarantees. We demand that the parties to the
conflict take the necessary measures so that such respect and
guarantees are an everyday reality.''
   It was directed to the armed forces and the rebels Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front.
   Ponce spoke to leaders of the Association of Correspondents
Sunday night and told them, ``Though they (the shootings) happened
in a brief lapse, this kind of incident is isolated. It does not
represent any policy or desire on the part of the armed forces to
intimidate journalists or keep them from doing their job.''
   U.S. Ambassador William Walker said Monday of the shootings:
``Obviously it is a tragedy.
   ``Now it is for the government to look into it and if there is
culpability, then punish those guilty. But as of now I don't know
the facts. I don't think anyone does.''

<HEAD>DEA Sting Ends With Arrest of Dozens of Alleged `Speed' Makers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sting operation has dealt a ``body blow'' to a
brisk methamphetamine trade by targeting alleged drug dealers who
ranged from health care workers to gang members, officials said
Monday.
   ``This is the largest single enforcement operation directed
against illicit drug manufacturers ever undertaken in the United
States,'' said agent Charles Hill of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration.
   Ninety-one people were charged in 27 separate federal
indictments, unsealed Monday, with manufacture and distribution of
methamphetamine, an illegal stimulant known as ``speed,'' ``meth''
or ``crystal.''
   In addition, 29 methamphetamine labs were seized, state Attorney
General John Van de Kamp said.
   Philip Donohue Jr., agent in charge of the local office of the
state Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement, said 78 people were in custody
and authorities had seized about 20 pounds of methamphetamine and at
least 38 weapons, including combat assault rifles and one Uzi
submachine gun.
   The first arrests came Sunday as 350 officers from several law
enforcement agencies made sweeps of homes in San Diego, Orange
County and Mammoth Lakes in the Sierra Nevada. More arrests were
planned, Donohue said.
   The sting involved the placement of an undercover state agent
inside a legitimate retail chemical supplier, Triple Neck Scientific
Co. of San Diego, with the owner's consent.
   Starting last June, the agent made contact with customers buying
chemicals and equipment for making methamphetamine and other illegal
drugs, said Van de Kamp.
   Methamphetamine makers in San Diego aren't limited to the
``traditional subculture of outlaw motorcycle gangs,'' the attorney
general said.
   ``Only half those arrested in this operation fit that
description. Among the other half, we had people like a retired
pharmacist, and a registered nurse. ... We found whole families
involved in the drug trade,'' he said.
   ``This gigantic sting will deal a body blow to the
methamphatamine trade in San Diego,'' Van de Kamp added.
   Donohue said San Diego ``has the dubious distinction of being the
meth capital of the United States.''
   Nearly half of the illegal methamphetamine labs in the United
States are located in California, and San Diego County has led the
nation in the number of labs seized for each of the past five years,
according to federal figures.

Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs planned.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Heidi Holland has made the journey from
off-Broadway to Broadway with her wit and wisdom intact. In fact,
she has gotten better, although she'd be the first to deny it.
   Heidi is the insecure heroine of ``The Heidi Chronicles,'' Wendy
Wasserstein's funny feminist travelogue that takes theatergoers from
the late 1960s to the present. The play, now on view at Broadway's
Plymouth Theater after a successful run at Playwrights Horizons,
remains one of the unqualified joys of the New York theater season.
   In a series of sketches, Wasserstein traces Heidi's changing
ideas about herself, about men and about other women. Heidi, an art
historian, may not embrace every trend, notion or belief that pops
up during her 20-year Odyssey, but she examines them with a
discerning attitude that is rich in humor and not above a little
anger.
   Director Daniel Sullivan has enlarged the production for
Broadway, but he hasn't diluted its effectiveness. Large slide
projections that pinpoint specific historical moments _ from Vietnam
War protests to the first rumbles of women's as well as gay
liberation _ enhance its appeal. Snippets of old pop music also help
anchor the play in the particular time periods.
   At the center of the play stands Joan Allen's radiant performance
as Heidi. She projects an intelligence and likability that never
waver during the character's many moments of self-doubt. It's a
richly drawn portrait.
   Peter Friedman has polished his performance as the egocentric
baby-boomer publisher who is in love with Heidi but marries someone
else. He's arrogance at its most ingratiating. Boyd Gaines is funny
and at times poignant as a sardonic but caring baby doctor. Cynthia
Nixon, the one new addition to the cast, demonstrates her virtuosity
in two roles _ as a flower child in a hilarious women's rap session
and as an ambitious corporate groupie of the Reagan years.
   Wasserstein has had some off-Broadway successes, most notably
``Isn't It Romantic'' and ``Uncommon Women and Others.'' ``The Heidi
Chronicles'' is her Broadway debut, and it's something to cheer.

   American audiences deserve to see the Royal National Theater of
Great Britain, but not the company of actors sent overseas by its
educational division with a ragtag version of ``Macbeth.''
   The production, now on view at the Harry DeJur Playhouse, toured
colleges and universities across the country before coming to New
York for a two-week run. Shakespeare's shortest play has been made
even shorter in this production, performed at just over two hours
with no intermission. It just seems longer.
   Director Nick Ward has a concept but not a play. This is bare
bones Shakespeare _ with no scenery and tattered, grimy all-purpose
costumes. Eight actors play all the roles. When not acting, they sit
trance-like on benches located on three sides of the stage.
   That dispassion carries over to their performances. Ken Drury, a
Nicol Williamson look-alike, possesses a resonant voice but it has
little emotion. At least a quivering Amelda Brown suggests Lady
Macbeth's obsession with power. Nothing else in this forlorn revival
seems alive.

   An Eastern Airlines flight attendant sued jailed
Wall Street financier Ivan F. Boesky for $500,000 on Monday,
claiming she suffered serious injuries when she tripped over
Boesky's briefcase during a flight in 1986.
   The flight attendant, Garvetta Spencer, who lives in a Virginia
suburb of Washington, D.C., was ``rendered sick, sore, lame and
disabled,'' according to the suit filed in U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn.
   Boesky's attorney, Robert McCaw, did not return a telephone call
seeking comment Monday.
   Boesky in late 1986 paid $100 million to settle charges with the
Securities and Exchange Commission including insider trading. His
confessions rocked Wall Street and spurred a crackdown on
white-collar crime.
   Boesky began serving a three-year sentence in a federal prison in
California last April.
   Spencer's suit claims Boesky acted negligently and in violation
of federal aviation regulations when he placed an open briefcase in
the aisle during an Eastern shuttle flight from Washington to New
York on Nov. 26, 1986.
   She said she was pulling a beverage cart up the aisle when she
fell over the briefcase and landed on her lower back. The suit
claims Spencer was hospitalized for a week and spent an unspecified
amount of money on doctor visits and other medical treatment.
   The $500,000 request also includes claims for lost wages.

<HEAD>Hawke Tearfully Admits To Adultery On National Television</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an extraordinary public confession,
Prime Minister Bob Hawke tearfully admitted to a national TV
audience Tuesday he had been unfaithful to his wife of 33 years.
   Hawke made the admission in a taped interview on Channel 7's
Newsworld program that was to be aired Tuesday night. The network
and the Prime Minister's Office released a transcript of the
interview.
   Hawke, 59, acknowledged reports of his womanizing, saying it was
in the past. He pledged his love for his wife, Hazel, calling her an
``incredible woman.''
   Newspapers led their front pages with the story. The Sydney
Morning Herald headlined: ``Bob Hawke In Tears: How I Cheated On
Hazel'' and the Daily Mirror of Sydney read: ```I Was Unfaithful To
Hazel,' PM's Amazing TV Admission.''
   The last time Hawke broke down on television was when he referred
in 1984 to drug problems among members of his family. Mrs. Hawke
later went on television to explain that their daughter, Roslyn, and
her husband, Matt, had been treated for heroin addiction.
   A spokesman for Hawke said Tuesday's admission was not new. ``All
this has been said before,'' said the official, who is not allowed
to be named.
   Hawke has said he will seek a record fourth term as prime
minister.
   In the interview, Hawke was asked what people mean when they
accuse him of being a womanizer.
   ``They mean I was unfaithful to my wife,'' Hawke replied.
   Robertson: ``Is that true?''
   Hawke: ``Yes.''
   Robertson: ``Did you stop that?''
   ``Yes,'' Hawke replied in tears, and then, ``I guess there are
not many women who would have put up with me all that time. But my
love for her never changes. I have always loved Hazel, always will.''
   Hawke also referred to his past drinking, which his biographer
Blanche d'Alpuget says earned him an entry in the Guiness Book of
World Records when he drank two and a half pints of beer in 12
seconds while studying at Oxford University in Britain. Hawke quit
drinking in 1979.

<TEXT>
   Two sisters taken hostage by a gunman
apparently were shot before police stormed a barricaded house to end
a 42-hour standoff, a police official said Monday, denying witness
reports that suggested the women were still alive.
   Police also speculated that a sexual-abuse investigation of the
gunman, Douglas ``Dougie'' Thomas, might have prompted the hostage
situation. It ended Sunday night when Thomas fatally shot his
girlfriend, 20-year-old Karen Lambert, wounded her sister and then
took his own life.
   The wounded hostage, Nicole Lambert, 14, was in critical
condition Monday at St. John's Hospital after surgery for a gunshot
wound in her head, said hospital spokeswoman Aggie Hayner.
   Police said Thomas, 20, took four hostages late Friday at the
home of Barbara Lambert, mother of Karen and Nicole Lambert. Thomas,
whom police described as ``deranged,'' threatened to kill the
sisters, as well as Karen Lambert's daughters, Katrina, 4, and
Kelisa, 2{ months.
   The two small children were released over the course of the next
42 hours while police surrounded the house and tried to convince
Thomas to surrender. Officials decided to storm the house after
Thomas took a telephone on which he had been talking to police and
threw it out a window, according to Springfield Police Chief Mike
Walton.
   Moments later, police fired two volleys of tear gas and broke
through the barricaded front door of the house. The two women were
found shot and wrapped in quilts just inside the door, police said.
Thomas was found lying on top of them with a self-inflicted gunshot
wound in his chest.
   The Springfield State Journal-Register quoted two witnesses as
saying they heard screaming as police tried to break through the
door, and that the screams stopped before officers entered the house.
   But Police Cmdr. Dan Hughes, who said he accompanied the
Emergency Response Team that stormed the house, said no gunshots
were heard immediately before or during the assault.
   Asked whether he believed the women were shot before the tear gas
was fired, Hughes said, ``Absolutely. When, I don't know, but it was
some time earlier.''
   Thomas, said by relatives to have been released from prison last
year after serving three years for a 1985 shooting, had been under
investigation by police for possible criminal sexual abuse as a
result of a complaint filed on behalf of a minor, police spokesman
Neil Williamson said.
   While declining to give details, he said the sexual-abuse probe
``could involve one of the hostages'' and might have prompted the
rampage.

   Sabotaged electrical and
telephone service hampered election officials' plan for a quick vote
count in the presidential election.
   The plan had been for each of more than 260 voting location in 14
provinces to transmit facsimiles of its returns by telephone to the
national Election Council in the capital Sunday night after the
polls closed.
   Election officials had said they expected to have preliminary
returns on election night. That turned out to be optimistic.
   At midnight on election night the council announced it was
suspending the count because of ``technical'' problems with the
computer.
   On Monday morning, Jorge Alberto Diaz, the council member who
represents the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena,
told reporters that returns were not yet in from some areas affected
by power outages.
   Leftist rebels lifted their transport ban on Monday, but on
election day there were reports that returns could not be delivered
because of dangerous conditions on the roads.
   Basic service like telephones and electricity are favorite
guerrilla targets and more than half the nation's electrical grid is
not working.
   Instead of trying to transmit the results by FAX, poll officials
said, the ballots and tally sheets would have to be brought from all
over this Massachusetts-sized to the capital. Final official results
might not come until as late as Thursday.
   But even though official results were not available, the parties
made predictions about the outcome based on unofficial results from
their own poll watchers.
   Arena claimed victory with more than 50 percent of the vote
Sunday, and the Christian Democrats conceded, even though only
130,000 votes had been officially counted at the time.
   Turnout was thought to be between 50 and 60 percent of the
nation's 1.8 million registered voters.

<HEAD>Judge Says Widow Can't Have Insurance Both Ways</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LARGO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court has denied a widow's claim
for $100,000 in life insurance, saying it couldn't create a ``legal
purgatory'' in which her brain-dead husband could be judged dead for
life insurance and alive for his medical insurance.
   The judges suggested a change in Florida's insurance laws.
   Ken Kepler, 49, suffered a heart attack May 28, 1986. It left him
with extensive, irreversible brain damage and he was in a vegetative
state in a hospital for 11 months.
   He was pronounced dead April 29, 1987, 20 days after the family
obtained a court order allowing doctors to withhold food and water.
   That date also was 10 days after expiration of his term life
insurance policy, the only life insurance he had.
   Family attorney Bruce Marger contended Kepler died when he
suffered the heart attack, since paramedics revived his heart rate
and breathing but he never regained consciousness or more than
minimal brain function.
   Marger said his position was supported by public policy set by
courts in at least three other states concerning the time of death
``where the dying process is interfered with by artificial means.''
   A Pinellas County judge rejected that argument, as did the 2nd
District Court of Appeal last month.
   ``Under any acceptable definition of `death,' Mr. Kepler did not
die before the expiration of his life insurance policy,'' the
appeals court ruled. ``We cannot rewrite the contract between the
parties.
   ``While the plaintiff's argument would provide a comforting
solution in this case, it would create numerous problems in other
cases.''
   The judges said they could not invent a ``legal purgatory'' in
which Kepler would have been dead for life insurance purposes but
alive so medical insurance could cover the remaining time he was
hospitalized.
   But in the same ruling, the judges said the case suggests the
Florida Legislature should pass a law to automatically extend the
coverage of term life insurance policies when the insured is in a
chronic vegetative state.
   Term life insurance pays benefits if the insured dies during a
certain period. Premiums are less than for whole life insurance,
which has no expiration date, provides larger benefits and offers
investment opportunities.
   The judges said they could foresee people forced ``to balance
their love for a family member against their needs in the future for
life insurance proceeds.''
   Tampa attorney Michael N. Brown, who represented Kepler's
insurer, Georgia International Life Insurance Co., said extended
coverage as the court suggested would require increased premiums and
negate the attraction of term life insurance.
   ``We sympathize with her,'' Brown said of widow Lynnette Kepler,
45, who was married to Kepler 20 years and had four children with
him. ``She got a bum deal but it wasn't the fault of the insurance
company.''
   Brown said the company could not voluntarily pay the $100,000 she
was seeking because of the precedent it would set and the concern it
would raise among stockholders.

   A passenger bus careened off a roadway and
plunged into a 100-foot-deep gulley Monday, killing at least 15
people and injuring 35 others, news reports said.
   The Excelsior news service said the accident on the
Naucalpan-Toluca state highway outside Mexico City occurred about
7:20 a.m. (8:30 a.m. EST). No other vehicles were involved.
   The news service quoted rescue officials as saying 15 were
confirmed dead. Nacaulpan Red Cross dispatcher Jesus Rangel said
many of the 35 wounded suffered serious injuries and were taken to
nearby hospitals.
   Rescue attempts were hampered by the depth of the gulley and
faulty rescue equipment, the news service said.
   More than 30 Red Cross, fire department and federal highway
police units at midday were still pulling bodies and the injured out
of the wreckage, Excelsior said.
   Surviving passengers reportedly told authorities the bus was
traveling very fast when the vehicle left the roadway and plummeted
into the ditch.
   Among those reported killed was the driver. His name was not
immediately available.
   Nacaulpan is in the state of Mexico just north of Mexico City.

<TEXT>
   Police had to use tear gas to break up a melee
Monday between about 50 Jewish feminists trying to worship at the
sacred Western Wall and angry Orthodox men who hurled chairs,
bottles and fruit at the women.
   The ultra-Orthodox men apparently feared the women would try to
repeat past feminist efforts to carry the Bible _ which Jewish
tradition says only men may do _ and don the prayer shawls worn
exclusively by male Jews.
   Orthodox tradition has a virtual monopoly on religious affairs in
Israel.
   One woman was slightly injured by a chair that struck her head
and neck, police spokesman Uzi Sandori said. He said there were no
arrests.
   The Western Wall, also known as the Wailing Wall, is Judaism's
holiest site. It is the only remaining wall of the ancient Jewish
temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D.
   After the women entered a specified women's prayer area, Orthodox
men stormed the cordoned-off section and threw chairs, fruit, and
``anything they put their hands on'' at the praying women, Sandori
said.
   Ushers who work at the Western Wall tried to protect the women
and warded off the men, but police only firing tear gas after a
woman began bleeding when she was hit by a chair, Sandori said.
   He said the police did not act earlier because they are not
allowed to interfere in a religious area unless called in by the
Religious Ministry.
   Amihud Bahat, a spokesman for the ministry, said the women at the
wall had deliberately left their prayer shawls and Bible at home and
did nothing against the rules.
   ``They are feminists but they behaved appropriately,'' he said,
adding they were welcome to pray at the wall in the future.

   Citing a report that found the Superfund
program ripe for a contracting scandal, a House panel chairman says
the Environmental Protection Agency must avoid the ``morass of
abuses'' that have plagued Pentagon purchasing.
   The General Accounting Office concluded in a new report that the
EPA is letting the growing number of contractors in the Superfund
program police themselves on potential conflicts of interest.
   Procedures are so lax that the agency might not discover a
company it hired to investigate a hazardous waste dump also was
working for the polluter of the site, the GAO said in a report
obtained over the weekend by The Associated Press.
   Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., who requested the study, wrote EPA
Administrator William K. Reilly on Friday, ``The Superfund contract
program must avoid at all costs the morass of abuses and conflict of
interest problems that plague the defense procurement system.

   The action in Congress this week is in the
House, which has a minimum wage debate on its agenda as well as
items that could reshape the leadership of both parties in the
chamber.
   Little legislation has moved through the Congress so far this
year, with most of the time spent on the failed plan to raise
congressional pay and the Senate battle over the nomination of John
Tower for defense secretary.
   President Bush lost that one, but his nomination of Rep. Dick
Cheney to the Pentagon post sailed to confirmation last week before
the Senate shut down for a two-week recess.
   GOP lawmakers are expected to choose Wednesday between two
candidates vying to replace Cheney in the No. 2 leadership post,
pragmatist Edward Madigan of Illinois and flamboyant conservative
Newt Gingrich of Georgia.
   The balloting in that race will come as the chamber's ethics
committee deliberates whether Speaker Jim Wright violated House
rules through his financial dealings, which have been the subject of
a nine-month panel investigation.

the shuttle apparently weathered better than its predecessors.
   Discovery remained at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., where high
winds hampered crews working Sunday to get the craft ready for its

leave on time Friday.
   After their desert landing at Edwards early Saturday, the five

   They were going back to work today, briefing the space agency on

   Hundreds of people rallied in Moscow to vent anger
at the Communist Party elite's alleged campaign to discredit ousted
city party boss Boris N. Yeltsin, a maverick reformer who is running
for national office.
   In a rare display of political passion, about 3,000 people
marched on city hall Sunday to drum up support for the popular
candidate. Police made no move to break up the unauthorized
gathering.
   Yeltsin is seeking a seat in the new national parliament, the
Congress of People's Deputies, in elections next Sunday that will
represent the country's first experiment with contested elections.
   ``He's against the party mafia, and that's why the party mafia is
against him,'' declared marcher Taras Osipov, a 65-year-old retired

   The devastating drought of 1988 is still
fresh on farmers' minds, and insurers say they're getting a bumper
crop of business this year _ a lot earlier than usual.
   More than 100 million acres of farm land are expected to be
insured this year, compared with about 75 million acres in 1988,
says Gene Gantz, executive director of the American Association of
Crop Insurers.
   ``It is a gigantic record,'' he said, adding that up to 150
million acres could be covered if conditions remain dry through the
April 15 deadline for signing up for federally subsidized
multi-peril crop insurance.
   Rainfall has been in short supply so far this year, scaring many
farmers who watched their fields and pocketbooks shrivel during last

the 1960s such as acid, downer, grok and chopper, and jazz-age
coinages such as Big Apple.

<HEAD>Diverse Collection of Nominees for Oscar's Best Actor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A boy who turns into a man. An autistic
genius. A Swedish peasant. A hard-bitten FBI agent. A dedicated math
teacher.
   Has there ever seem such a diverse collection of nominees for
best actor? Each performance seems unique, creating a difficult
choice for Academy voters.
   Gene Hackman has been in Oscar contention before. He was
nominated for supporting performances in ``Bonnie and Clyde'' (1967)
and ``I Never Sang for My Father'' (1970), and won the big prize as
the relentless Popeye Doyle in ``The French Connection'' (1971).
   Hackman, 58, is one of those actors who seems to get better with
age. He gets kidded about his lack of selectivity _ last year he
appeared in five films within three months _ but invariably he draws
praise from critics and his fellow actors. His one memorable film of
1988 was ``Mississippi Burning,'' for which he was nominated.
   As the Southern sheriff turned FBI agent, Hackman once more
brought depth to what could have been a surface role. ``I always
manage to find a way in films to be a bit introspective,'' he said
in a recent magazine interview. ``It helps me as an actor, makes me
feel as if I'm doing something important.''
   Max Von Sydow's nomination as the downtrodden farmhand in ``Pelle
the Conqueror'' was a rarity: He won the recognition speaking a
foreign language. Only one Oscar has ever been awarded to a
performer in a subtitled film: Sophia Loren for ``Two Women.''
   Although he has been acclaimed as a star of Ingmar Bergman films
and international movies, Von Sydow, 66, has had no Academy
recognition until now.
   ``I am not American and I am not English,'' he says, ``so my
choice of parts in English-language films is limited.''
   Von Sydow was delighted with his ``Pelle'' role because it
allowed him to use his own childhood dialect; like the character
Lasse, he grew up in a small Swedish town. He liked the role because
it offered ``such a great variety of emotion. In every new scene
there is a new situation and a new attitude from the man.''
   Although Robin Williams had a breakthrough nomination last year
with ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' comedy has traditionally been held
in low regard by Academy voters. Now Tom Hanks is trying to break
that tradition as a nominee for ``Big.'' He made a comedic gem out
of the role of 13-year-old Josh Baskin who overnight is granted his
wish to become a grownup.
   For Hanks, 32-year-old graduate of sitcom (``Bosom Buddy''), the
role required no method-actor searching for identity. ``I just
imagined what it would be like to be a 13-year-old,'' he says simply.
   ``The kid is on the immature side,'' Hanks adds, ``and I must say
I was much the same when I was his age. It wasn't until I was 14
that I started growing up and becoming highly intelligent and
debonair.''
   Two of the other nominees for best actor faced more difficult
transformations. Edward James Olmos, the slim, laconic Lt. Martin
Castillo of TV's ``Miami Vice,'' shaved his mustache, thinned his
hair and added 40 pounds to portray East Los Angeles teacher Jaime
Escalante in ``Stand and Deliver.'' The Bolivia-born Escalante
attracted wide attention by inspiring his students to such high
academic achievements that they were suspected of cheating.
   ``What motivates Escalante is the sheer love of teaching,''
observes Olmos, 42. ``When he see the light in a student's eyes,
it's a natural high, like adrenalin. He needs it, like a performer
who needs applause.''
   Olmos himself has been attracting applause since his appearance
as the macho narrator of Luis Valdez' play and the 1971 movie,
``Zoot Suit.'' His role as Lt. Castillo won him the Emmy.
   Dustin Hoffman exerted his customary thoroughness in preparing
for his role as Raymond Babbit, the autistic man with a genius for
numbers in ``Rain Man.'' After reading the initial script, he
puzzled over the paradox of a man whose autism crippled him for
normal living, but who nevertheless could perform superhuman feats
of calculation.
   For a year, Hoffman visited with autistic savants and their
families and talked with medical experts about the phenomenon. Out
of his research came the portrayal of a man who seemingly could not
converse with anyone, yet was capable of surprising flashes of
wisdom.
   Hoffman, 51, had plenty of time to prepare as ``Rain Man''
underwent changes of directors and scripts. In the first days under
director Barry Levinson, the actor remained unsatisfied. But the
pair finally reached agreement.
   ``It's like in baseball,'' he says, ``you hit a home run and then
you start popping up. What you're trying to do is just connect, meet
the ball. In the movies, you're trying to make contact. But not
until it's over do you find out where it went.''

<HEAD>Sensitive Roles: A Road to the Oscar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Portraying the physically or mentally impaired
presents a challenge to film actors, who must make the part credible
as well as sensitive. Academy Award voters have rewarded several for
their efforts with the coveted Oscar. This year, Dustin Hoffman and
Tom Hanks are competing for the best actor prize, based on their
roles as adults with diminished mental capacities. As critics noted,
both infused their parts with credibility, keeping their characters
grounded in the realities of their predicaments, rather than playing
Tinsel Town cliches.
   ``Tom is fun ... but he had to be more restrained,'' said
director Penny Marshall. ``Innocent and shy was better than loud and
brash and broad. If (his character) is just skipping down the block
and making silly faces, I don't think you get involved with the
movie.
   ``Basically, you have to not act like what you think a child acts
like, but get in touch with the child inside of you.''
   Indeed, both actors found the key to their depictions from within.
   ``I simply pretended I was 12 years old. That's all I did,'' said
the 32-year-old Hanks of his role as Josh Baskin, a child locked in
a man's body in ``Big.''
   Hoffman, who plays a compulsive autistic savant in ``Rain Man,''
discovered the secret to Raymond Babbitt by examining his own
fastidious acting habits. ``I suddenly realized that I was playing
off myself because I know something about obsession and I'm
comfortable being obsessive,'' the 51-year-old actor said. ``The
rest of it just took care of itself.''
   Such introspection brought more than believability to ``Rain
Man'' and ``Big.'' It also allowed both actors to touch on emotions
not limited to their character's situation.
   In ``Rain Man,'' for example, Hoffman's autistic savant was used
not for melodrama but to illuminate the fear of the unknown and the
desire for order that many of us share. And as a youngster suddenly
thrust into a cutthroat corporate environment, Hanks hinted that
innocence and fairness can, in the end, prevail.
   Yet, given their subject matter, both films ran the risk of
falling into Hollywood formula, where complicated disorders are
reduced to plot devices, and multidimensional people with
disabilities are simplified for audience appeal.
   Actors such as Oscar-winner Jack Nicholson (as a renegade mental
patient in 1975's ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'') and
Emmy-winner Larry Drake (the mildly retarded office clerk on ``L.A.
Law'') have been singled out for accurately portraying the mentally
impaired.
   And Academy Award voters and film critics have praised a variety
of other actors playing characters with mental and physical
impairments: Jane Wyman won an Oscar for playing a deaf-mute in
1948's ``Johnny Belinda''; Patty Duke was awarded a statuette for
her depiction of Helen Keller in 1962's ``The Miracle Worker.''
   Marlon Brando was commended for his performance as an injured war
veteran for 1950's ``The Men''; Cliff Robertson won an Oscar for
playing a man with mental retardation in 1968's ``Charly''; Jon
Voight took the best actor prize for playing a paraplegic in 1978's
``Coming Home''; John Malkovich was a best supporting actor nominee
for his role as a blind border in 1984's ``Places in the Heart.''
   And John Hurt and Charles Laughton suffered pounds of daily
makeup and folded their bodies into contorted positions for
sensitive roles they played. For his lead in 1980's ``The Elephant
Man,'' Hurt received a nomination for best actor. Laughton won
critical and industry praise in 1939's ``The Hunchback of Notre
Dame.''
   But many others have been faulted for overblown, inaccurate
representations.
   Josie Abady directed the play ``The Boys Next Door,'' about four
mentally handicapped men in a group home.
   ``Like all people, people who are handicapped are funny, they're
pathetic, they're great,'' Abady said.
   ``You just think cheap shot, and you've got the stereotype,''
Drake said. ``Hoffman's character and my character both have a full
range of emotion. And that seems to surprise people _ that the
characters can feel as much as they feel, and note as much as they
note.''
   As originally written by Barry Morrow, ``Rain Man'' described
Hoffman's autistic character as ``an overgrown Cabbage Patch doll,''
a person with the lovable, huggable habits of the mentally retarded
as typically seen through entertainment industry eyes.
   ``But Dustin suggested that it would be more interesting if the
guy was more autistic, more quirky and less cuddly,'' said ``Rain
Man'' co-screenwriter Ron Bass. ``The idea is that there would be
two autistic characters _ the Raymond character who is clinically
autistic and the Charlie character (a coldhearted car salesman
played by Tom Cruise) who is emotionally autistic.
   ``In this situation, you don't fall in love with Dustin right
away,'' Bass said. ``He's a difficult guy, and just when you think
what he's doing is kind of cute and sweet, he does something
completely weird.''
   Hoffman's depiction of autism was much better than what he's seen
in the past, said George Zitnay, executive director of the Joseph P.
Kennedy Jr. Foundation.
   Zitnay said movies tend to depict the disabled ``as being much
more disabled than they really are. ... My attitude has always been
that films have done a disservice to persons with mental
retardation.''
   As the creators of ``Rain Man'' tried to be true to the autism
disorder, the makers of ``Big'' also chose not to let the script or
its star resort to shtick.
   ``It's such a high-concept idea that there's a huge temptation to
just play the jokes and not the emotion or character,'' said ``Big''
co-writer Gary Ross.
   ``But I think (the movie) lets us reveal a lot about the adult
world, using Josh as a mirror: that we all have a child inside us
and we all can operate childishly. As soon as you start trying to
figure (the character) out intellectually, you lose it.''

<HEAD>Supporting Actress: Diverse Roles and A Double Nominee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five impressive performances have made the
competition for best supporting actress one of the most difficult to
predict in recent Academy history.
   The portrayals are diverse: a secretary, a dog trainer, a bigot's
wife, a French noblewoman, a business executive. Three of the
actresses are in the early stages of promising careers, two are
unquestioned stars.
   Sigourney Weaver is the only one of the five to have been
nominated before: as the female Rambo in ``Aliens,'' 1986. This year
she finds herself in two categories, as leading actress in
``Gorillas in the Mist'' and supporting actress in ``Working Girl.''
   Weaver, 39, has been praised for her bravery in both films: for
working with the gorillas, and for taking a secondary role as the
duplicitous boss of Melanie Griffith in ``Working Girl.''
   ``It's a very funny role as a Wall Street tycoon-shark or
`sharkess,'' Weaver said. ``The film really stars Melanie Griffith
and Harrison Ford, but I have a very juicy supporting role. I
thought it was a good antidote to the hardship and sadness of
(`Gorillas in the Mist').''
   Geena Davis is a new girl in town. About 30 (she declines to
state), she has played a ghost in ``Beetlejuice,'' an insect's
girlfriend in ``The Fly'' and a spaceling's lover in the forthcoming
``Earth Girls Are Easy.'' Her co-star in the latter two films was
her husband, Jeff Goldblum.
   ``The Accidental Tourist'' is a more conventional role, though
she is definitely offbeat as the free-thinker who comes to train
William Hurt's dog and stays to form a romance.
   ``I read the (Ann Tyler) book when it first came out and I loved
the character of Muriel,'' she says. ``It's kind of amazing that I
got to work in the movie and people liked it and it's all worked
out.''
   Frances McDormand, 31, the least known of the supporting-actress
nominees, is well respected among her fellow professionals. A
graduate of the Yale School of Drama, she has won acclaim for stage
portrayals, especially for her role as Stella in ``A Streetcar Named
Desire,'' for which she won a recent Tony nomination. She appeared
in two films by Joel and Ethan Coen, ``Blood Simple'' and ``Raising
Arizona.''
   In ``Mississippi Burning,'' McDormand plays the pivotal role of
the wife of a deputy sheriff who is involved in the murder of three
civil rights workers. In a recent magazine interview, she upheld the
film against its detractors.
   ``A lot of things haven't changed that much since 1964. That's
why I think the movie is so important. I would consider the movie a
failure if people came away from it saying, `Oh, these things
happened in Mississippi in 1964. How terrible!'
   ``Instead, I hope they come out of it thinking these things
happen all over the country, and they're still happening.''
   Joan Cusack is best remembered as the frantic news producer in
``Broadcast News,'' and as a regular on ``NBC's Saturday Night
Live.'' She'll be seen next month in ``Say Anything'' as the sister
of John Cusack, her real-life brother.
   Cusack, 26, won her nomination as the wisecracking pal of Melanie
Griffith in ``Working Girl.'' She recently talked about the
difference between the two women:
   ``Melanie and I are best friends, but she wants to move up from
being a secretary to being an executive, and it distresses me. I
mean, we have a life together _ we ride the same ferry to work, we
take our coffee break together, we lunch together. That's enough for
me. I'm a basically happy person. But Melanie wants more.''
   A former beauty pageant contestant in Orange County, Calif.,
Michelle Pfeiffer languished in forgettable films (``Grease 2,''
``Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen'') and what she
calls ``junk television'' (``Delta House,'' ``B.A.D. Cats''). That
changed when she scored as Al Pacino's cool mistress in ``Scarface.''
   After playing one of the title roles opposite Jack Nicholson in
``The Witches of Eastwick,'' Pfeiffer, 31, became a hot ticket. Last
year she appeared in three major films: ``Tequila Sunrise,''
``Married to the Mob'' and ``Dangerous Liaisons.'' The latter
brought her the nomination for supporting actress.
   It was no easy role. She played the almost saintly Madame de
Tourvel who is cruelly seduced by a rakish nobleman (John Malkovich)
and then destroyed when he abandons her. The role required her to
``have about three nervous breakdowns,'' she says.
   The actress recalled sitting in with Malkovich in her dressing
room and complaining, ``I can't do this. I can't do this again.''
Though she cried so much she came to work with her eyes swollen
shut, she reverted to her native confidence ``that it was all there,
and I wouldn't have any trouble.''

<HEAD>Italians Rediscover Theater</HEAD>

   After years of TV addiction, Italians are finding
their way out of the house and rediscovering the pleasures of
theatergoing.
   Internationally known actors are turning down movie scripts in
favor of the stage, and spectators are responding by forming ticket
lines at dawn to get into the hottest shows.
   Marcello Mastroianni has tackled Russian drama. Swedish film star
Ingrid Thulin _ the sensuous woman in Ingmar Bergman's classic 1957
film ``Wild Strawberries'' _ plays a domineering mother in a tragedy
by the Spanish playwright Federico Garcia Lorca.
   Actress Monica Vitti is being peppered with offers to bring her
hilarious performance as a brash reporter in Ben Hecht's ``The Front
Page'' back to the United States.
   ``After more than a decade-long love affair with television,
Italians are once more thirsty for their roots of great comedy and
tragedy,'' says University of Rome sociology Professor Alberto
Abruzzese.
   ``They want to be moved by real-life sounds and be tickled by the
comedians they saw on the screen.''
   Last year, movie attendance in Italy dropped by 18 percent. While
movie houses have been closing throughout the country, new theaters
have opened in Naples, Florence and smaller cities to bring the
total to 1,700 nationwide.
   Thulin, one of Bergman's favorite actresses, has returned to the
stage after a 20-year absence in Lorca's ``The House of Bernarda
Alba'' which is presently on tour in Italy.
   Bergman himself will come to Italy this year to direct an Italian
version of Eugene O'Neill's ``Long Day's Journey Into Night.''
   Mastroianni's performance in Nikita Michailov's ``Mechanical
Pianola'' produced a nightly traffic jam in Rome's central Piazza
Argentina. They play is adapted from a short story by Chekhov.
Mastroianni told interviewers he hadn't felt so thrilled since he
won an Oscar nomination for his role in ``Dark Eyes'' three years
ago.
   Comedian Ugo Tognazzi riled a few government ministers and
triggered controversy by improvising lines about corruption in high
places during his stage version of Moliere's classic ``The Miser.''
   Italians spent $118 million on theater tickets in 1987 _ a 23
percent increase from 1986, and 1988 figures point to another 20
percent jump. During that period, the average price of an orchestra
seat increased only about 16 percent, from $18 to $21.
   Government statistics show that one out of five Italians attended
some sort of theater performance in 1988.
   Just as in Roman times the government organized theater events
for its people, today's network of 14 state-subsidized theaters,
offer stage variety that ranges from translations of Broadway hits
to Greek tragedy to Italian classics.
   Post avant-garde performances and experimental groups at 500
private theaters and four drama schools also get a share of the $42
million which the Italian government annually allocates to encourage
the theater industry.
   Italy's ancient theater tradition has its roots in the classics
of Greek theater _ tragedy, comedy and satire. In medieval times,
religious themes were popular.
   During the Renaissance a new form based on classic theater was
shaped by Machiavelli and others. It gave way to the commedia
dell'arte which dominated Italy and most of Europe until the end of
the 1700s.
   Luigi Pirandello, master of Italy's 20th-century theater, focused
on the condition of the modern man.
   While the classics are still popular, they have competition from
Broadway-style productions.
   Vitti, who starred in an all-woman version of Neil Simon's ``Odd
Couple'' last year, has been touring Italy in ``Front Page.''
   ``The success has been incredible,'' she said. ``Spectators have
stood on line all night in Turin and Lucca. Police have had to
intervene to stop punchups over tickets, and we're still going
strong after four months on tour.''
   Vitti has received offers to bring the show to New York, Los
Angeles and Buenos Aires, but her fear of flying makes her hesitate.
   A scuffle erupted New Year's Eve in Milan over the presentation
of ``Trojan Women'' in ancient Greek. Fifty spectators fought over
the remaining four tickets on sale at a theater.
   Other serious dramas, including works by Shakespeare and
Pirandello, are playing to sold-out crowds. Andrea Jonasson, the
Swedish wife of Italy's best-known theater director Giorgio
Strehler, alternated lines in Italian and German in Pirandello's
Berlin-based drama on lost identity, ``As You Desire Me.''

   There aren't many bands who have made Charlie
Chaplin cry and Brigitte Bardot laugh. But then, they aren't many
bands that sound like the Gipsy Kings.
   Their music is a fiery blend of flamenco, jazz and Latin sounds
driven by a half-dozen guitars; their lyrics are sung in Gitane, a
mixture of Spanish, French and Gypsy.
   It's not the usual Top 40 fare, yet the band from the South of
France _ international stars in Europe _ has broken onto the U.S.
charts with their catchy ``Bamboleo.''
   ``It's funny to see in Billboard that we're in different
categories each time,'' said Chico Bouchikhi, speaking through an
interpreter. ``Nobody knows where to place us.''
   The music isn't the only thing that's different about this band;
the group's army of six guitar players are all related. Brothers
Nicolas and Andre Reyes are joined by their brother-in-law,
Bouchikhi, and three cousins, Diego, Paco and Tonino Baliardo.
   ``A family is able to live, work, do music and have fun together.
It's better to have it that way,'' said Bouchikhi, speaking just
prior to the band's appearances this month on ``Saturday Night
Live'' and ``The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.''
   The band has played together for the past 16 years, crossing
barriers of language, music and geography as their career slowly
progressed. They started out playing street corners and cafes for
change, where they quickly attracted an impressive coterie of fans.
   One of their first boosters was the legendary comic Charlie
Chaplin. They met the Little Tramp while playing on the streets of
Switzerland and he became their biggest fan, weeping as the Gypsies
played their traditional songs.
   ``It was a very, very strong moment for the band, because he
cried as he listened to the music,'' said Bouchikhi. ``It was very
strong to realize that someone who had made the whole world laugh
for so long could cry to our music.''
   And what about Bardot?
   ``We met by chance about 10 years ago when we received an offer
to play for one of her birthday parties,'' Bouchikhi said. ``It went
really well, and everybody was dancing and happy. So we became
friends. ... She was kind of a godmother for the group.''
   The Gipsy Kings repaid her friendship by recording a song about
Bardot titled (in English) ``Woman.''
   Language has never been a problem for the group as they moved
around the world. ``Bamboleo'' and its follow-up, ``Djobi, Djoba,''
were huge hits.
   ``Emotion and passion do not need language really, and that's the
most important language really,'' Bouchikhi said. ``Words to us are
not secondary, but not that important. It's a general feeling of the
music.''
   And despite the growing success, the band doesn't want to become
too successful. The idea of the Gipsy Kings headlining at Giants
Stadium doesn't hold much appeal for the group, Bouchikhi said.
   ``What's important is to keep the idea of a big party, some kind
of joy and emotion,'' he said. ``And if you're playing to too many
in a group, it's kind of difficult to keep the emotion together.
   ``You have to keep some kind of balance. It's pretty easy to lose
yourself while going up and up and up.''
   To prevent that, group members rejoin their friends and relatives
each year in an 80-trailer caravan in Arles, France, for an annual
Gypsy festival. It is a time for the band to renew its family ties
and relax.
   ``We need to come back. It's very important to have the time to
be together again before going out and traveling again,'' said
Bouchikhi. ``So we try to spend a lot of time in France.''

   This is one of a series of periodic reports by
The Associated Press on the economic, social and political
turbulence that has turned South America into a continent in crisis.
In this report, the AP bureau chief in Lima surveys Peru, which has
possibly reached the lowest point in its 165 years as an independent
nation.

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``These are the days of the anonymous nocturnal
bullet, of the slashing of throats of village officials, of the
disappearance of union leaders.''
   So wrote Cesar Hilderbrandt in a column recently in Si magazine
in a passage that epitomizes the desperation of today's Peru, a
nation struggling with economic chaos and a savage leftist
insurgency that threatens to explode into civil war.
   From cab drivers to congressmen, Peruvians are asking themselves
what went wrong in their Andean country, which had one of South
America's strongest economies until the 1960s.
   _More than 14,000 people have been killed in the nine-year
uprising by the the leftist Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso)
guerrilla organization. Blackouts and bombs have become part of
daily life in Lima. A paramilitary death squad has made its
appearance.
   _Inflation hit a record 1,722 percent in 1988 and is widely
projected to soar above 10,000 percent this year, pushing wages and
salaries down to bare-survival levels. The economy shrank 9 percent
in 1988 and is likely to contract even more this year.
   _The collapse is putting hundreds of thousands of people out of
work in the continent's third largest country and one of its
poorest. In 1976, Peru produced 34,000 automobiles; this year it is
expected to assemble, at the most, 3,500. Few people can afford them.
   Although many Peruvians blame President Alan Garcia for the
chaos, most independent analysts say the economic crisis had been
building toward an eruption for the past several decades; Garcia's
populist, free-spending policies lit the fuse.
   Highway bandits have begun waylaying buses and automobiles,
making travel outside Lima dangerous and adding to the sense of a
disintegrating nation where law and order has broken down.
   Many Peruvians now speak of ``the civil war that is coming,''
seeing it as inevitable.
   ``There is a very real danger that Peru, without realizing it, is
sinking deeper into the swamps of fratricidal war,'' the magazine
Oiga commented in a recent editorial.
   Surveys indicate most people have little faith that solutions
will be found.
   Garcia, a dynamic young leader, was elected in 1985 as ``the
president of hope.'' But his defiant stance against paying the
foreign debt, now $19 billion, cut Peru off from international aid
and his uncontrolled spending bankrupted the country, critics say.
   These days angry crowds shout ``Alan, you charlatan'' when he
speeds by in heavily armed convoys.
   In recent months Lima has been hit by waves of coup rumors and
many Peruvians doubt the presidential election scheduled for April
1990 will take place. Leftist military officers seized power in
1968; constitutional government was restored in 1980.
   Former Mayor Alfonso Barrantes of Lima, a Marxist, is one of the
favorites in the campaign. The other front-runner is the writer
Mario Vargas Llosa, leader of a center-right coalition.
   Peruvians frequently mention the opening passage in Vargas
Llosa's 1974 novel ``Conversation in the Cathedral,'' saying it
succinctly reflects their feelings now:
   ``From the doorway of La Cronica, Santiago looks at the Avenida
Tacna without love: cars, uneven and faded buildings, the gaudy
skeletons of posters floating in the mist, the gray midday. At what
precise moment had Peru (screwed) itself up?''
   One who saw things that way was Morty Weisselberg, 41, a
second-generation Peruvian, who had a high-paying job as the manager
of a small metallurgical company. He packed up and left a few months
ago for Canada with his wife and two small daughters. Before he left
he explained why.
   ``What worries me is the kind of future I am going to leave my
children. `The future that this country offers is very different
from the one 30 years ago when I was in the position of my children.
Then there was a bright future for the country, at least
apparently.''
   The Weisselbergs were among 150,000 Peruvians, most of them
professionals and skilled workers, who bought one-way tickets out
the country in 1988, the largest exodus in Peru's history.

   Many blame Peru's economic decline on several decades of
government mismanagement, controls that have stifled private
enterprise and strident nationalism that has frightened away foreign
investors and isolated Peru from world financial centers.
   More than anything, Weisselberg said before he left, he was
frightened by what he saw as the country's deep class divisions and
its growing violence.
   Political analysts agree with him that Peru's social and racial
divisions, inherited from the Spanish colonial era, have spawned
class hatred that threatens to rip apart the fabric of Peruvian
society.
   The scorn and discrimination shown by Peru's white elite toward
the dark-skinned Indian and mestizo majority has generated deep
resentment among Peru's poor, say social scientists.
   ``Political violence in Peru is not the result of poverty alone
but of humiliation, oppression, class hatred, racism,'' said Sen.
Enrique Bernales, head of a blue-ribbon Senate panel on violence.
   For many Peruvian and foreign political experts, Peru now stands
at a critical point in its 165-year history where an antiquated,
inequitable and inefficient politial structure is crumbling.
   ``For me the Shining Path is nothing more than the violent
natural expression of this social explosion,'' said Luis Lumbreras,
one of Peru's most important archaeologists. ``If it had not been
Shining Path, sooner or later there would have been another group,''
   Lumbreras is from Ayacucho, the impoverished highland province
where the Maoist-inspired guerrillas launched their insurgency in
1980, after 10 years of organizing among Quechua-speaking Indians in
the countryside.
   Peru covers an area larger than Texas, New Mexico and Arizona
combined and has a population of 21 million. But just as it is
divided by class and race, it is sharrply divided by its geography
into three regions _ the Andean sierra, the coastal deserts and the
Amazon rain forest _ that feel little in common with one another.
   In the 1950s highland peasants began to crowd into Lima, the
capital, looking for a better life, and the migration has
accelerated in recent years as the countryside has turned into a
battlefield.
   With the Shining Path insurgency and the forced integration of
Lima and other coastal cities, Peru's white class has begun to feel
challenged for the first time.
   Once the royal capital of the Spanish empire in South America,
Lima is surrounded by the bleakest shantytowns on the continent,
home to two-thirds of the city's 7 million inhabitants.
   Lima's rich, increasingly insecure, live behind high walls in
suburbs to which entry is controlled by gates and armed guards.
   The economic collapse, regarded as the worst in Peru's history,
has hit the middle class and the poor the hardest.
   The purchasing power of salaries has plummeted by at least 50
percent in the last year. A doctor at a public hospital earns the
equivalent of $80 a month. A public school teacher earns $55. The
value of an army general's salary has fallen from $1,100 a month in
1980 to $200 today.
   Dorotea Sandoval lives with her husband and eight children in the
shantytown of Villa El Salvador, where mothers boil fish bones to
give a thin broth to their children.
   ``We stopped eating meat a long time ago,'' she said.

<HEAD>Cheney And The Rush to Judgment</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dick Cheney may be too good for the Pentagon.
They're starting to make him sound like a saint.
   The Senate confirmed Cheney at top speed, unanimously, one week
after President Bush named him to be secretary of defense, a
striking contrast to the 10-week struggle that led to the rejection
of former Sen. John G. Tower for the job.
   One Republican senator called the quick confirmation a rush to
judgment, but voted for Cheney anyhow. But then speed and harmony
were understandable given the senators' appraisals of the six-term
congressman from Wyoming.
   Cheney was pronounced trustworthy, steady, realistic, pragmatic,
remarkable, moral, unique, superb, experienced, tough,
compassionate, outstanding academically, exemplary, committed,
unflappable, smart, a man of integrity and the ultimate legislator.
   All of that in an hour's discussion, with no harsh words except
for leftover complaints that Tower had been treated unfairly and was
still being maligned by published accusations of excessive drinking.
   Cheney's path to confirmation began with banter after weeks of
gallows humor about dry happy hours. Cheney said he had enjoyed his
one public appearance before the Senate Armed Services Committee.
``It was a lot of fun,'' he said.
   None of it was fun for Tower, even before he was publicly accused
of drinking too much and stepping out on his wives when he was
married. From the outset, he had faced critical questions about the
consulting fees he received from defense contractors after he left
the Senate in 1985, contractors he would have dealt with as
secretary of defense.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
said there was nothing on the Cheney record to even hint at a
conflict of interest or any other problem. He insisted the committee
had taken no shortcuts on the Cheney nomination, that ``this nominee
is being treated like all others.''
   But the Senate obviously was in a hurry-up mood after the Tower
rejection. Besides, the two-week Easter recess began on Friday, and
the people who had rejected one nominee didn't want to leave on
vacation without filling the job.
   It usually is easier the second time around. Senators who have
voted against a presidential nominee don't want to do it again. But
it doesn't always work that way _ Richard M. Nixon was defeated on
successive nominations to the Supreme Court.
   Cheney would have been overwhelmingly confirmed in the first
place. He does not pose as a defense expert, but he needs no pose.
Cheney knows government from the inside, as a White House aide and
Gerald R. Ford's chief of staff. He is a firmly conservative
Republican, No. 2 in his party's House leadership, but he draws
solid praise from Democrats as well as GOP colleagues.
   Tower's nomination was damaged by delay before it ever got to the
Senate. It took more than a month for the president to announce that
he was choosing Tower, a delay the White House blamed on the need to
check out accusations it said were proven groundless. The Senate
heard similar accusations and decided otherwise.
   Nunn, leading the debate against Tower, said even the Bush
transition team had internal differences on the nomination. There
was no hesitation on the Cheney appointment _ Bush made it one day
after Tower was rejected. It was not set up in advance of the Senate
vote, but Chief of Staff John Sununu had raised the possibility with
Cheney by seeking his counsel on candidates for the Pentagon.
   One public and one closed-door hearing later, the Armed Services
Committee voted 20 to 0 for Cheney, and a day after that he was
confirmed.
   Nunn insisted the committee had checked Cheney out carefully and
thoroughly and had followed its standing procedures on nominees.
That included an FBI report; Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said more than
100 people were checked in that part of the process.
   The FBI report on Tower, concentrating on his drinking habits,
became a central issue in that debate, even though it was secret.
Senators could read it but could not cite or quote from it. That
process was unique.
   Nunn and Warner read the FBI report on Cheney and told other
committee members they found nothing detrimental. Nunn said that is
standard and sufficient in most cases, although other committee
members can arrange to see FBI reports if they deem it necessary. In
this case, none did.
   ``Let's not make any mistake about it, this is a rush to
judgment,'' insisted Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa. ``Let's not make it a
precedent.''
   He also observed that it is possible to rush to the right
judgment.

<HEAD>Cultures Mingle in Arab Desert as American Indians Perform</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   War whoops pierced the desert stillness.
Tom-toms kept the beat as dancers circled under the starry sky and
the campfire flickered their shadows on the adobe walls.
   The American Indian had come to Arabia.
   The fascinated onlookers were Bahrainis, who also have tribal
origins, but dance to different drums.
   The occasion was a cross-cultural pow-wow during a visit by the
American Indian Dance Theatre, a 15-member troupe touring the Middle
East and Europe under the auspices of the U.S. Information Service.
   The Americans, representing eight Indian tribes from Apache to
Zuni, said they were delighted by the Arabs' enthusiasm at their
performances, featuring traditional dances in authentic dress.
   ``We show them the vibrant colors, our beadwork, the songs,
dances. In a sense, they're just like us, they have their tribal
songs and dances that are new to us, just as ours are to them,''
said Marty Pennecoose, 31, a Southern Ute who now lives in Salem,
Ore., and works as a high-iron construction worker.
   The desert gathering, arranged by the U.S. Embassy, was a private
affair held in the ruins of an 80-year-old sheik's palace, within
sight and smell of Bahrain's oil and gas fields.
   The 50 or so guests sat on rugs in the sand, eating Middle
Eastern food, including four roast lambs, to watch an all-male
Bahraini dance group perform.
   The Indians later staged an impromptu performance. Long hair and
braids flew as the dancers, wearing jeans, cowboy boots and sneakers
instead of tribal costumes, mingled with the Bahrainis in their
white dishdashi robes and Arab headdress.
   Pennecoose said it was ``a learning process, going to these
different countries, experiencing their surroundings and cultures,
things that we'd only see in books.''
   ``We want to show the rest of the world what we have to offer,''
he said. ``It's a good thing, what we're doing, dancing around the
world.''
   Arlie Neskahi, 32, a Navajo and lead singer, said he found
cultural similarities as well as differences.
   ``Our people are shepherds, and I grew up eating lamb and goat,''
said Neskahi, who wore an Arab head scarf wrapped in the style of
Yemen, one of the group's earlier stops.
   ``My father always told me it takes all the colors of the rainbow
to make it beautiful,'' he said.
   ``We want to share our cultures with other people who don't know
anything about us,'' said Chester Mahooty, 60, a Zuni Indian from
New Mexico and the troupe's senior member.
   ``The people here think that John Wayne is the most popular, not
the Indians. We have to tell them the truth.''
   It was that stereotype that the company's founder and producer,
Barbara Schwei, said she wanted to dispel.
   ``I felt there was definitely a need to express the American
Indian culture to people because there is such a lack of
information. I thought it was time for a company done properly,
playing first-class theaters all over the world.'' Schwei, with
director and choreographer Hanay Geiogamah, picked the dancers
during visits to Indian pow-wows and festivals in the southern and
northwestern United States.
   The members are drawn from both American and Canadian tribes.
   Geiogamah, a Kiowa Delaware from Oklahoma, said the result is ``a
kind of new pan-tribal idiom'' that helps Indians preserve and
expand an important art form.
   Mahooty, who adorns himself with huge turquoise breastplates and
rings, said American Indian dances emphasize a religious
relationship with nature.
   Many are acted-out prayers to the ``Great Creator,'' mother
Earth, or mountain spirits, for rain, good harvest or hunting.
``Eagle dances,'' common from the northern plains to the
southwestern pueblos, pay homage to the soaring bird that Indians
believe has direct contact with deities in the sky.
   For one Bahraini it was a new look at a people ``we know only
from cowboy films.''

   Two-year-old Margaux, Lorraine and Claire are busy
bathing their dolls. Zoe is sponge-painting. Three other toddlers
paste spots inside a drawing of a big blue fish.
   In the next room excited 15-month-olds throw rubber balls into a
plastic swimming pool and then jump in.
   In France, where women make up 42 percent of the work force,
collective infant care subsidized by federal and local funds is a
way of life for nearly 335,000 children, rich and poor, under the
age of 3.
   To get a first-hand look at France's much-admired system, 14 U.S.
child-care experts recently spent two weeks touring nearly two dozen
day care centers, pre-schools and drop-in centers in Paris and the
provinces.
   They met with French child care professionals and government
officials, looking for ways to improve child care services in the
United States.
   ``In the U.S., we're still light years away from what we've seen
here,'' said Evelyn K. Moore, executive director of the National
Black Child Development Insitutute in Washington, D.C., who took
part in the visit sponsored by the Frenc
receive special training including nursing skills. Day care center
directors are registered nurses who have had additional training
plus five years of day care experience.
   The law requires one aide for every five infants who do not walk,
and one aide for every eight who do walk. Each center has its own
pediatrician, child psychologist and dietician who make two visits
weekly, along with a full-time laundress, cook and cleaning
personnel.
   ``In the U.S. we basically have untrained people working in child
care. In France, child care is considered a profession and has
status,'' said Susanne Martinez, legislative counsel to Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif.
   Mrs. Revel said the locale _ a cheerful, brand-new facility
designed to handle young children _ was another reason she opted for
day care.
   ``It's very safe. The children aren't being told constantly not
to do this or that. Their only restraints are with regard to each
other.''
   Health and safety regulations are a major concern for child care
advocates in France and the United States. While many mothers say
children in day care are sick more frequently than children kept at
home, child care professionals disagree.
   Bettye Caldwell, professor of early childhood education at the
University of Arkansas in Little Rock, says statistics show that
infants under 12 months in day care get 10 colds a year as opposed
to 8 colds for children who stay home.
   ``Out of 66 children here, there are always about a dozen who are
sick, and they're always the same ones,'' said Nada Finztler, the
director of a day care center in central Paris.
   American experts are also examining French day care funding.
Parents pay the equivalent of $1.50 to $18.00 a day, on a sliding
scale linked to their income.
   Officials say the overall costs for a single day of child care in
Paris is about $33 and up to $50 in the provinces. Parent fees cover
roughly 30 percent of operating costs. National and municipal
government funds make up the difference.
   ``I'm especially impressed by France's commitment to child care
from the national level down to the municipal level, and the
integration of support from each level,'' Ms. Martinez said.
   French municipalities pay for building child care facilities and
provide equipment. The Education Ministry oversees pre-school
teacher training and the Social Affairs Ministry handles child care
aids.
   Several experts said they were surprised by the French system's
near universal availability.
   ``What strikes me is that programs in France are for all kinds of
families, whereas in the United States, the care would be directed
towards low-income and disadvantaged families,'' said David Edie, a
day care specialist at the Wisconsin Department of Health and Social
Services.
   He said the proposed Act for Better Child Care, known as the ABC
bill in Congress in Washington, targets only low-income families.
   It would earmark $2.5 billion to provide more child care
facilities, upgrade training for child care workers, subsidize the
care costs for low-income families and create resource and referral
services.
   Edie called the bill ``a drop in the bucket'' and said it would
not affect middle-class double-income families who would still have
to scramble for costly private care.
   France's child care system is an extension of family policies
adopted decades ago to counter a falling birthrate and population
devastation wrought by war.
   Edie says the French have understood better than most that child
care is not just a baby-sitting service, but an educational
experience.
   ``We can learn a lot from the French,'' said Mrs. Moore. ``It's
clear their government has made a firm commitment to young children
and families. We're just not there yet, but child care is a service
whose time has come.''
   At Mrs. Finztler's day care center in Les Halles, nearly 100
children from 2 months to 3 years of age are engaged in different
activities.
   The 2-year-olds bang on drums and blow into recorders.
Afterwards, they lie on the floor breathing deeply to relax.
   ``We focus on introducing new physical sensations and
experiences,'' Mrs. Fintzler said. Earlier, the toddlers took off
their clothes and slid around in soft white flour, ``learning about
softness and slipperiness.''
   The tots also love splashing finger paint all over each others'
naked bodies, learning about ``sexual difference'' and losing
``inhibitions about what's clean or dirty,'' she said.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The idea was to protect the elderly from
catastrophic health bills without adding to the deficit. The
solution was to tax affluent retirees to fund a new insurance
program. But what seemed like fiscal prudence to Congress smacked of
tax tyranny to Dan Hawley, a retired airline pilot who's launched a
grass-roots rebellion against the new Medicare law.

   With his bolo ties and legs bowed by knee
troubles, Daniel Hawley has the look of an aging cowboy bent on
kicking up one more ruckus. That's precisely what the 64-year-old
retired pilot has in mind.
   Hawley and his wife, Marsha, 51, have launched a mom-and-pop
petition drive aimed at a decision by Congress to fund a new
catastrophic health insurance program for old people by taxing
elderly retirees.
   The petition drive has attracted 140,000 signatures from people
irate about the new Medicare law, which will tack $800 or more onto
the annual tax bills of Hawley and other affluent retirees.
   It's a grass-roots rebellion, fed by retirees' fears that if
Congress can put a special tax bite on them to pay for these
benefits, the lawmakers will do it again and again.
   The outcries have caught lawmakers by surprise. They were trying
to patch some of the cracks in Medicare that had spurred sales of
high-cost, low-benefit ``Medigap'' insurance policies.
   They also wanted to free the aged of the worry of being
bankrupted by catastrophic medical bills without adding to the
deficit or raising taxes.
   When then-President Reagan signed the legislation last July 1, he
noted with pride that it ``follows the same premise as all sound
insurance programs: It will be paid for by those who are covered by
its services.''
   ``That's a change in attitude in this country,'' boasted Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
   The new law divides the $33 billion, five-year cost of benefits
among the 33 million Medicare beneficiaries _ not equally, but
according to ability to pay.
   All but the poorest pay a $4-a-month premium that generates 37
percent of the money needed. The other 63 percent of the costs are
picked up by a ``supplemental premium,'' or surtax, on the 40
percent of Medicare beneficiaries with enough income to owe at least
$150 in federal income taxes.
   What seemed like fiscal prudence to Reagan and Bentsen smacked of
tax tyranny to Dan Hawley and his loosely knit band of confederates.
   He claims the new Medicare benefits are minuscule and the costs
are steep, and he inveighs bitterly against the ``dictators'' who
railroaded ``this big caboozle'' through Congress.
   ``The senior citizens of America are in the greatest fight they
have been in since World War II, and this time it is with their own
Congress,'' said the white-haired Hawley, a one-time pile driver
from Chicago who boasts that he ``never bent any tin'' during nearly
34 years as an American Airlines pilot.
   ``Congress did a marvelous job of keeping the public uninformed
on the total extent of this bill. The seniors are saying, `We did
not ask for this bill. Take your benefit back. Leave us alone.'''
   Each morning's mail brings another stack of letters, petitions
and a few small checks for Hawley's cause.
   ``In Florida we are all hopping mad. Who was on the committee
that passed this abomination?'' wrote a Punta Gorda, Fla., man.
   A Pottstown, Pa., retiree sent Hawley a copy of the note he now
sends charities informing them that until the new Medicare act is
repealed, ``all of our funds previously available for good causes
such as yours have been confiscated by the U.S. government.''
   A Lake City, Mich., man complained that senior citizens are being
``forced to pay for the health care of profligate drug users and
AIDS victims who for any reason have gained a place on the rolls of
Medicare and Medicaid.''
   ``If, indeed, this concept is the trend of the future, i.e.,
`Make those who benefit, pay,' then please hasten to take us from
the list of those who pay for child care, education, welfare, ADC,
low-income housing and a myriad of other government giveaway
programs from which we receive no direct benefit,'' wrote the
Michigan retiree.
   In Washington, Bentsen and some of the other ``dictators'' at
whom this torrent of complaints is aimed defend their legislation
and argue that many of the critics are misinformed.
   Medicare remains ``the best buy in town'' for its rly or disabled beneficiaries,
including the 1.6 million seniors
who will be hit with the maximum tax, Bentsen insists.
   ``I hear some of these folks say, `Well, the odds are that
they're not going to need catastrophic illness (covera33 million
eldege).' Well,
that's wonderful,'' said Bentsen.
   ``Well, there's only one-half a percent chance that your home's
going to burn down but to be prudent most of us go out and buy fire
insurance on our homes, and if we don't go out and voluntarily do
it, the people that carry the mortgage insist that we do it. And
we're delighted that we don't have to collect on it,'' he said.
   ``The same thing is true in catastrophic. You would hope you
never had to collect on it. But
   The Hawleys began their organization last summer after reading a
senior columnist's article in the Las Vegas Review-Journal and
calling a meeting at a local senior citizens' center.
   Some were AARP members dissatisfied with their own organization's
stance.
   AARP says it likes the catastrophic benefits, but not the way
they were financed. The organization has held its ground, despite
pressure from some chapters.
   Hawley has debated a top AARP executive on public television's
MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour, and squared off with AARP officials on
other television and radio shows.
   He isn't camera-shy. ``We are constantly talking over microphones
in an airplane,'' he explained.
   While Hawley speaks of waging a David vs. Goliath struggle
against the AARP to lobby for repeal of the catastrophic act, he
disavows any intention of trying to turn his coalition into a
permanent lobbying force.
   Others are using the fight over catastrophic coverage to try to
sign seniors up for new organizations, and banks and securities
firms are using it to pitch tax-free investments.
   Hawley's petition warns that the elderly could wind up footing
the bill for ``most of the medical costs of AIDS patients.'' With
the AIDS medication AZT costing up to $10,000 a year per patient,
Hawley fears that elderly people with big drug bills could get
frozen out of the program.
   The prescription drug benefit has a cap so that only those with
the steepest drug bills are helped. Some 5.5 million beneficiaries _
one in six _ will get Medicare reimbursement for some of their drug
costs.
   But relatively few AIDS patients live long enough to get Medicare.
   Some 10,000 AIDS patients receive Social Security disability
payments, but only 900 have been on the disability rolls for the two
years required to qualify for Medicare, according to Social Security
spokesman Phil Gambino.
   Despite its name, the Catastrophic Coverage Act makes only a
small dent in the financial problems confronting families trying to
pay for long-term nursing home care, which costs an average of
$25,000 a year. The new Medicare law relaxes restrictions on the
income and assets an elderly person can own when a spouse needs
Medicaid to help pay nursing home bills.
   The uproar may make lawmakers leery of ever attempting to cover
long-term care costs under Medicare.
   Horace B. Deets, the AARP's executive director, said the
complaints about the Medicare catastrophic act are a ``good example
of what happens when you take a patchwork approach to a systemic
problem. We need something done for universal access to
comprehensive care, and it isn't here yet for everybody.''
   In addition to repealing the catastrophic act, Hawley also wants
Congress to set up a blue-ribbon presidential commission to examine
the ``monstrous'' unresolved health care issues. He would set one
rule for this commission: no politicians allowed.
   Hawley isn't saying when he will deliver his petitions to
Congress.
   ``Eisenhower didn't tell the Germans when he was going to land,''
the pilot said. ``When the snowball is rolling down the mountain,
you don't stop it halfway.''
   If he loses the fight, ``then I almost guarantee you that in two
years, Congress has its greatest turnover ever. The senior power
will vote them out of office.''
   If he wins, ``then you will never hear Daniel Hawley's name
again. He's going down and start playing golf, all across this
country.''

   Here is a look at the new or expanded benefits
provided the elderly and disabled by the Medicare Catastrophic
Coverage Act, and how much beneficiaries will have to pay for them.
   HOSPITAL _ Medicare beneficiaries will pay a deductible of $564
for their first day's stay in the hospital each year, but Medicare
pays the rest of their hospital bills, no matter how long the stay.
Previously there were limits on how much Medicare would pay for
stays longer than 60 days, and patients were charged a deductible
for each hospital admission after a 60-day ``spell of illness.''
Effective: Jan. 1, 1989.
   DOCTOR BILLS _ Starting in 1990, Medicare beneficiaries will have
to pay no more than $1,370 in out-of-pocket expenses for doctor
bills and other services under Medicare's Part B. However, if their
physician charges more than Medicare approves, they will still be
liable for the difference.
   Medicare patients must pay the first $75 as a deductible on
approved charges, then Medicare will pay 80 percent of other
approved charges up to the $1,370 threshold, and 100 percent beyond
it. If a patient's private insurance pays some of the bills, that
still counts toward the $1,370. Effective: Jan. 1, 1990.
   DRUGS _ Currently, Medicare pays only for prescription drugs
administered in the hospital and for immunosuppressive drugs
administered during the first year after an organ transplant.
Starting in 1990, it will begin covering outpatient prescription
drugs for the first time.
   In 1990 Medicare will help pay for certain antibiotics and other
intravenous drugs, and it will cover immunosuppressive drugs beyond
the first year of a transplant. After a $550 deductible, Medicare
will pay 80 percent of the cost of intravenous drugs and 50 percent
for the immunosuppressives.
   In 1991, Medicare will begin covering most other prescription
drugs and insulin. There will be a $600 deductible and 50 percent
co-payment for 1991; a $652 deductible and 40 percent co-payment for
1992, and a 20 percent co-payment and deductible to be determined
for 1993 and beyond.
   SKILLED NURSING FACILITY _ Medicare will pay for 150 days of
skilled nursing care, up from 100 days. The co-payment is limited to
an estimated $22 per day for the first eight days. The new law
scraps a requirement that a patient had to be hospitalized for at
least three days before entering a skilled nursing facility.
Effective: Jan. 1, 1989.
   HOME HEALTH CARE _ For those who meet Medicare's restrictive
eligibility requirements, the catastrophic act will provide up to 38
consecutive days of care. Those who do not need daily care will be
eligible for up to six days a week for as long as prescribed by a
doctor. Effective: Jan. 1, 1990.
   HOSPICE CARE _ The new law provides unlimited hospice care for
terminal patients; it was previously limited to 210 days. Effective:
Jan. 1, 1989.
   RESPITE CARE _ For someone caring at home for a Medicare
beneficiary requiring daily personal care, Medicare will pay for up
to 80 hours per year of home health aide and personal care services.
Limited to those who have met either the annual deductible for
prescription drugs or the $1,370 Part B catastrophic limit.
Effective: Jan. 1, 1990.
   MAMMOGRAPHY: Medicare will pay up to $50 for X-ray screenings to
detect breast cancer. Effective: Jan. 1, 1990.
   TAXES AND PREMIUMS _ All Medicare Part B beneficiaries now must
pay an extra $4 premium each month; this will rise to $10.20 per
month in 1993. Those who owe at least $150 in federal income taxes
will also pay a supplemental premium based on that income tax
liability. The supplemental premium rate for 1989 is $22.50 for each
$150 of federal income taxes, or 15 percent. If someone owes $1,000
in federal taxes, they will have to pay an extra $150 in Medicare
supplemental premium. The maximum supplemental premium is $800 per
Medicare beneficiary, or $1,600 per couple enrolled in Medicare.
   The supplemental premium, or surcharge, rises from 15 percent for
1989 to 25 percent for 1990, 26 percent for 1991, 27 percent for
1992 and 28 percent for 1993. In effect, a 15 percent surcharge on
the elderly boosts their 15 percent marginal tax rate to 17.25
percent and the 28 percent rate to 32.2 percent. In 1993, the 28
percent surcharge will boost the 15 percent rate to 19.2 percent and
the 28 percent rate to 35.8 percent.
   The House Ways and Means Committee says 60 percent of the elderly
will not be subject to the supplemental premium, paying only the
$4-a-month premium for their coverage. It predicts that 5 percent of
the elderly in 1989 and 10 percent in 1993 will pay the maximum
supplemental premium. They are generally individuals with adjusted
gross incomes above $43,000 this year and couples with incomes above
$85,000.
   The committee says more than 7.8 million Medicare beneficiares,
or 22 percent, will receive new benefits each year when the
catastrophic act is fully implemented. Some 5.8 million will receive
prescription drug benefits, 2.4 million will have doctor bills and
other charges in excess of the $1,370 cap paid, and 1.5 million will
be spared having to pay more than one hospital deductible of $564
each year.
   Although the new law does not provide direct coverage of
long-term care costs, it eases Medicaid restrictions on how much
income and assets an elderly spouse can keep when the other spouse
is a Medicaid-financed nursing home resident.
   Effective Sept. 30, 1989, spouses will be able to keep income of
at least 122 percent of the federal poverty level, or $786 per
month. These limits will rise to 133 percent of the poverty line on
July 1, 1991, and 150 percent on July 1, 1992. In addition, the new
law allows states to permit the spouse to keep assets, in addition
to a home, worth at least $12,000 and possibly as high as $60,000.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Ella Fitzgerald made her debut at a Yale
University dance 54 years ago. She's been captivating audiences ever
since. She began as a jazz singer, then moved on to classy popular
music. Today, magazine ads and TV commercials are introducing a new
generation to America's first lady of song.

   A boy walking by Radio City Music Hall saw a big
picture of Ella Fitzgerald, advertising her upcoming concert. ``Ah,
Ella!'' he cried, then he threw his arms wide and embraced the glass
over the poster.
   You can show her picture or say ``Ella'' any place in the world
and people know who you mean: America's first lady of song.
   The 6,000-seat Music Hall sold out fast. After more than 50 years
in show business, Miss Fitzgerald hasn't tired of those appearances.
These days, her doctor sanctions a couple of dates a month. The
longest she's been away from the public was nine months, after her
1986 heart attack and a bypass operation.
   ``I love to sing and I love people,'' she says. ``I try to give
people love through singing and make them happy.''
   It was Yale men and their dates at a dance 54 years ago who put
Ella in show business. From the stage, in the shy, modest tone of
somebody unaware of her own greatness, she always thanks the public
for keeping her there.
   When she arrived in New York from singing in Palm Springs two
days before her Radio City concert, a wealthy fan gave her a party.
``He had a cake made with my picture on it. Neil Sedaka was there,
Tony Bennett, Jon Hendricks. We got up and jammed; we were supposed
to be doing `Lady Be Good.' You never heard such a `Lady Be Good.' ''
   Liza Minnelli and Whitney Houston, who were unable to attend,
sent notes of regret, which Miss Fitzgerald took home to keep.
   She travels with an 8-by-10 photograph of her 3-year-old
granddaughter, Alice, who lives in Seattle. ``She likes country and
western. She sings, `You are my sunshine, my only sunshine.'''
Alice's singing is imitated by her famous grandmother.
   Imitating is one of the things Miss Fitzgerald does best. In
Radio City, she sings ``Ghost of a Chance'' like she thinks it would
be done by a tenor saxophone, trades scat phrases with bassist
Keeter Betts and offers a Louis Armstrong-like growl in her
flag-waving final encore, ``Mack the Knife.''
   In a voice that is light, girlish and true, she slips easily in
and out of jazz, always swinging. When Norman Granz became her
manager in 1954, he bought her contract from Decca Records and began
recording her on his own new label, Verve. Instead of easing her
slowly from jazz into the day's pop hits, he boldly moved her into
classy popular music. Her first Verve recording was ``The Cole
Porter Songbook.''
   She'd been traveling with Dizzy Gillespie and was apprehensive
about drastically changing styles. ``I'd been singing be-bop. I
thought the man was trying to get me out of the business.''
   Instead, ``The Cole Porter Songbook'' introduced the singer to a
larger, non-jazz audience. The record was followed by other
``songbooks'' devoted to the music of Gershwin, Ellington, Rodgers
and Hart, Berlin, Arlen, Kern and others. These days, Miss
Fitzgerald sweetly reminds audiences, ``They're available on CD.''
   If there was anybody left who didn't know Ella Fitzgerald, they
met her through commercials. She sang for Memorex tapes and a glass
shattered. ``Kids liked it. They'd always ask me when I'm going to
break another glass. We get on an airplane and pilots say, `Whatever
you do, don't sing next to the window.'''
   Slimmed down from her previous look as a comfortably plump
grandmother, she posed for Annie Leibovitz for an American Express
ad. The photographer chose a red dress, hat and leopard coat from
Miss Fitzgerald's closet, posed her by her old convertible that had
to be pushed into place and said something a bit raunchy _ Miss
Fitzgerald doesn't say what _ to put a ``foxy lady'' look on her
face.
   ``She got me snazzy,'' the singer smiles. ``People take that
picture out of magazines and ask me to autograph them.'' They also
recognize her voice singing ``Isn't It Romantic'' in American
Express TV ads as a couple loses a credit card in Venice and picks
up a replacement in Beijing.

   Ella Fitzgerald was born in Newport News, Va., and moved to
Yonkers, N.Y., before she started school. ``I came with my mother;
she was married,'' Miss Fitzgerald says. ``I started first grade in
Yonkers, on Clinton Street.''
   Then in 1934 came the famous amateur contest _ famous because
it's where Miss Fitzgerald was discovered _ in Harlem. ``I went as a
dancer. I lost my nerve,'' she recalls. ``They had two sisters who
closed the show, the Edwards Sisters. They could dance. I was the
first amateur out. There was no way in the world I was going to go
out there and try to dance after they had finished.
   ``Somebody laughed in the audience. The master of ceremonies
said, `Well, do something.' My mother had a record by Connee
Boswell; she loved that record. She would play it so much that I got
to know it. I tried to sing `The Object of My Affection' and
`Judy.'''
   She won first prize.
   Bardu Ali, who often fronted the Chick Webb Band on stage while
Webb played drums, was there. He recommended the teen-ager to Webb
as band vocalist and Webb said she could sing when he played a Yale
dance. If she went over, she could join the band. She went over.
   In 1938, Miss Fitzgerald and Webb Band arranger Van Alexander
wrote ``A-Tisket, A-Tasket (I lost my yellow basket),'' which became
her first hit record. On her last birthday, when she turned 70, Bill
Cosby sent her a huge basket of flowers and a note, ``A-tisket,
a-tasket, I found your blank-blank basket.''
   She has three bits of advice that she lives by. ``One time in a
school play, I tried to sing `Sing, You Sinners' and I got on the
street and somebody told me they liked it and I ignored them. My
mother slapped me down. You've heard of seeing stars? I saw stars.
She told me, `If somebody speaks to you, you say hello.'''
   Once, when she was pining, Miss Fitzgerald says, ``Duke Ellington
told me it's like a toothache. It'll hurt for awhile. But when you
take that tooth out, you miss it but you'll feel better.''
   And a cousin told her to smile, even if people said something bad
about her. ``I used to be very self-conscious. Somebody looked at
me. I thought, `Oh, what are they saying?' I learned to smile. It's
beautiful to feel you can smile and you can love people.''
   In 1987, after she recovered from her heart attack, she played
the Hollywood Bowl. Other dates were lined up but another, shorter
layoff intervened. ``One of my toes had to be amputated. I was
wearing pointy-toed evening shoes. Now I have to wear open-toed
shoes. I say, `Thank God, here I am walking.'''
   Last summer Miss Fitzgerald fell on a step on the Hollywood Bowl
stage. Forget malpractice suits. The backstage was instantly full of
doctors eager to help. The singer took a short intermission, then
returned to sing ``Since I Fell for You.'' Now she enters and leaves
the stage holding her pianist's arm.
   Her last recording, ``Easy Living,'' made with guitarist Joe
Pass, came out before her heart attack. The month she turned 70, a
30-year-old record, ``Ella in Rome _ the Birthday Concert,'' was
released for the first time. It was taken from a recently found tape
of a concert she did in Rome on her 40th birthday.
   She'll record again this spring and would like to make her first
music video, in which she would dance, possibly with children from a
Watts nursery that's named for her, then break into song.
   ``I love ballads because they tell a story,'' Miss Fitzgerald
says. ``If it's a pretty tune, people start thinking about something
that happened in their lives.'' She told her Radio City audience,
``There will be something for everybody. The only thing I don't have
is rap. I might try it.'' As well as ballads and jazz, she included
a bossa nova, had a rock beat behind ``Ain't Nobody's Business,''
sang a Stevie Wonder song _ and did a gentle rap.
   Don't be surprised if she tries a country-western duet someday
with granddaughter Alice.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Some years ago public outrage threatened to end a
booming industry, that of the Tennessee Walking Horse. The industry,
and the breed, survive. One reason is because of people like Charles
Thomas.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>By JULES LOH</NOTE>
<NOTE>AP Special Correspondent</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BUCKEYE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It would be nice if everybody could claim
the title his government has bestowed upon Charles Thomas, but few
measure up. Thomas is, officially, a Designated Qualified Person.
   ``I don't know who thought up that name,'' says Thomas. ``I guess
they had to call us something.''
   What Thomas and only about 75 others are designated to be
qualified at is deciding whether a horse, specifically a Tennessee
Walking Horse, is fit to compete in a horse show.
   ``For a while there,'' he was saying the other day, stroking the
forehead of a brood mare who ambled over to the fence to greet him,
``it looked like the whole walking horse business was going down the
drain. That would have been a shame. It's a beautiful breed.''
   It is most gentle with an easy gait that doesn't jar the rider at
any speed. It reaches its front feet high and far out, one and then
the other, and brings its back feet forward to overstride the front.
Its back remains as level as a love seat. The high stretch of the
front feet is what horsemen call ``the big lick,'' a crowd-pleasing
action prized in show rings.
   ``The gait is bred into the horse,'' Thomas explains. ``With
regular training a good horse will develop the big lick naturally.
But some trainers weren't satisfied. They took shortcuts, tried to
make something artificial out of what's supposed to be natural.
   ``That's why we now have DQPs _ designated qualified persons.''
   The ``shortcuts'' brought down upon the walking horse industry
the wrath of the American Horse Protective Association and other
humane groups and, finally, Congress. In 1970 it passed the Horse
Protection Act, aimed specifically at Tennessee Walking Horses, and
assigned the U.S. Department of Agriculture to enforce its
provisions.
   ``What the trainers would do,'' says Thomas, grimacing, ``was
sore the horse.
   ``First they built up the front feet by putting thick pads
between the hoof and the shoe. This raised the horse in front and
gave him a longer reach, a higher step. Then they did the worst
part. They burned the horse with a chemical, blistering it above the
front hooves, and attached a heavy, rough chain that would rub on
the sore part.
   ``The horse would try to kick the chains off, like you would try
to throw a bracelet off your wrist that bothered you. The whole
effect was to exaggerate the big lick.
   ``The crowds loved it. It really is exciting to watch. The judges
listened to the crowds, and soon soring, as it was called, became
the accepted way to treat a walking horse.
   ``I've seen horses so sore they couldn't finish, just give out.
I've seen horses walk off with blood running from above their
hooves.''
   The memory causes Thomas to shudder. He cannot abide cruelty.
   Charles Thomas is 50. He is a gentle soul with a voice like a
Southern lullaby. He and his wife, Christine, and their three
children live in a friendly farmhouse a century old, nestled against
a clear spring on 96 acres of Cumberland Mountain foothills in this
rural community near Lynchburg.
   Both Charles and Christine work at the nearby Jack Daniel's
distillery, he in the steam plant, she in the bottling house.
   ``Walking horses are important to me,'' Thomas says, ``but just
as a sideline. Of course for a lot of folks around here their living
is the walking horse business.''
   Quite a business. Shelbyville, a few miles north of here, bills
itself as ``The Walking Horse Capital of the World'' and is the site
of an annual 10-day show, called The Celebration. It is to walking
horses what the Kentucky Derby is to thoroughbreds.
   Last year's 50th annual Celebration drew more than 3,500 horses
who competed before a paid attendance of 231,000 devotees of the big
lick.
   ``It's like a 10-day carnival,'' says Thomas. ``The fans get
really into it. One time I had to disqualify the favorite and I
thought it might cause a riot. They weren't pleased.''
   Thomas has been a DQP for six years and an inspector at the
Celebration the past five.
   He recalls that when he first became an inspector he disqualified
a horse at a small show and the trainer threatened him.
   ``That hasn't happened since and I don't believe it will ever
happen again. The inspection program is accepted now, and I'm
accepted as a fair person. So are the other DQPs.
   ``The owners and trainers realize it's in their best interest. We
reject fewer horses each year.'' At last year's Celebration, for
example, 56 horses were rejected compared with 185 the year before.
   ``Why did I apply to become a DQP? Well, I grew up around walking
horses and love the breed. I never could abide that business of
soring them.
   ``In the old days they were called plantation horses, just a good
sturdy horse you could ride all day without getting tired. People
around here would ride them to a show on Sunday and ride them home.
   ``It wasn't until they became big business, sort of show
business, that trainers began soring them. There's big money in it.
   ``So when I heard about the DQP program I decided I would like to
be one, like to help get the breed back to what it's supposed to be.
   ``Every Friday and Saturday night from the first of May through
the end of October,'' says Thomas, ``there will be a horse show at
one place or another, sometimes just small places around here like
Wartrace and Belt Buckle and Winchester, and I will be at one of
them.
   ``I will also go to auction sales and inspect there, so the
buyers can be sure they aren't getting a horse that's been sored.
   ``The way I do it, I take up each front foot in turn. I press all
around the top of the hoof, at one o'clock, two o'clock, all the way
around.
   ``I press with my thumb until my nail turns a little white, that
much pressure. If the horse flinches at all, just moves a little,
that's it. I turn him down.''
   Has it made the shows less sensational, less spectacular with
those high-prancing steeds?
   ``No,'' says Thomas emphatically.
   ``Now they have to produce that action by breeding it into the
horse, not by abusing them. Knowing that, I believe the fans feel
the shows are better than ever.''
   What Designated Qualified Person would disagree?

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Foreign cadets at West Point? What better way to
build good will and expose future foreign leaders to American
ideals, says a Congressional report. This year's foreign cadets hail
from Bangladesh and Botswana, among other places.
</TEXT>

<NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WEST POINT, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States Military Academy is
legendary for producing such all-American war heroes as Ulysses S.
Grant, Douglas MacArthur and Dwight D. Eisenhower. But the
``country'' in West Point's motto ``Duty, Honor, Country'' does not
necessarily mean the United States.
   For the past century, West Point has also been a training ground
for future generals of foreign armies _ dictatorships as well as
democracies.
   Soldiers like Filipino General Fidel Ramos, the late Nicaraguan
dictator Anastasio Somoza and pre-revolutionary Chinese Army Gen.
Ying Hsing Wen marched out of West Point's storied Long Gray Line to
play key historical roles.
   This year's foreign plebes come from Bolivia, Guatemala, Lebanon,
Liberia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Malawi, Singapore, Jordan,
Turkey and Zimbabwe. Currently, 30 foreign cadets are training at
West Point from Bangladesh, Haiti, Senegal, Cameroon, Liberia and
Botswana among other places.
   Once approved by the secretary of defense, a nation's politics or
relations with the United States are not considered in judging an
applicant's merits, says Capt. Robin Carrington, admissions officer
for foreign cadets.
   ``We do not deal with philosophy,'' Carrington says. ``We try to
keep standards for foreign cadets exactly the same as U.S.
citizens.''
   There are cadets from countries ruled by hard-line dictators who
do not tolerate dissent or hold elections, as well as from countries
with democratic governments like that of the United States.
   The purpose of educating foreign cadets at West Point, according
to a Congressional report, is to build good will and expose future
foreign military leaders to American ideals, especially in
developing nations where the United States seeks to promote
stability.
   Annapolis and the Air Force Academy have similar programs. By
law, each military academy is allowed 40 foreign cadets at a time.
At the moment, the Air Force Academy has 37 and the Navy academy, 32.
   ``Our goal is to provide an opportunity for students from
selected countries to attend the Air Force Academy and learn more
about the way we do business in this country and go back home with a
first-rate military education and hopefully be better allies,'' says
Lt. Col. John Swiney, associate director of admissions at the U.S.
Air Force Academy.
   Fidel Ramos graduated from West Point with honors in 1950.
Thirty-six years later, he played a pivotal role in the revolt that
ended Ferdinand E. Marcos' 20-year reign in the Philippines and put
Corey Aquino in power.
   Ramos developed friendships with West Point classmates who went
on to powerful posts in the U.S. military, including Charles
Gabriel, an Air Force chief of staff, and John Wickham, who became
the U.S. Army's chief of staff.
   Ramos is now Philippine defense secretary and one of his
country's most popular figures. A veteran of the Korean and Vietnam
wars, Ramos is using his education to fight a communist insurgency
and quell coups in the Philippines.
   Natee Wongissares, a senior from Bangkok, Thailand, agrees that
both countries have benefited from Thailand's cadets at West Point.
   ``In the future these people (West Point graduates) have a
tendency toward the United States,'' the Thai cadet says. ``They can
affect the relationship between the two countries for a better
relationship, they will work together.''
   Unstable political climates in some Third World countries, where
change is more apt to take the form of a coup than a democratic
vote, have created unusual situations for West Point graduates.
   Capt. Moises Cortizo, Class of 1980, is a loyal aide to
Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega, at odds with the United
States since his indictment by an American grand jury on drug
trafficking charges last year.
   Ricardo Ernesto Castro, Class of 1973, sought political asylum in
the United States after testifying before Congress about his
activities as a leader of a Salvadoran death squad.
   Anastasio Debayle Somoza, son of the original Nicaraguan dictator
Anastasio Somoza, was given command of the Nicaraguan national guard
when he graduated from West Point in 1946. He went on to succeed his
father as president before the Sandinista Revolution ended that
regime.
   West Point's first foreign cadets came from South America, but
the program has expanded virtually worldwide. Countries with cadets
at West Point are no longer necessarily U.S. allies.
   Soviet cadets may enter West Point classrooms next fall under a
program approved by the Reagan administration allowing West Point
and Soviet military academies to exchange cadets for two-week visits.
   American cadets also have the opportunity to spend two weeks at a
foreign military academy in one of more than 30 countries including
Venezuela, Jordan, Belgium, Morocco, the Dominican Republic and
Japan.
   Of more than 70 nations invited, 25 to 30 send applications. Many
of America's strongest allies do not send cadets to West Point. NATO
member countries are invited but don't participate, although a
Canadian midshipman is attending the Naval Academy.
   Foreign cadets don't compete against American candidates, says
academy spokeswoman Andrea Hamburger. ``These spaces are
specifically designated for non-American cadets. They have to meet
the same basic criteria as a cadet here would.''
   At West Point all cadets eat the same food, adhere to the same
dress code, take the same courses and meet the same requirements for
graduation.
   In addition to chemistry, engineering, and science courses, they
can study the history of technology and warfare, the American
experience in Korea and Vietnam, space mechanics, terrain analysis,
military computer systems, military ethics and nuclear reactor
design.
   ``They are usually very, very serious students and good students.
Depending on where they are from, some struggle with English,'' says
Carrington.
   Some have more than a language barrier to overcome.
   Carrington recalls one cadet from an African tribe who had never
flown on an airplane until he came to West Point. He had only heard
about water coming out of the walls, but had never seen or taken a
shower and had to be shown how to drink out of a soda can.
   ``There is some culture shock, especially in the beginning,''
Carrington says.
   Otherwise, foreign cadets are not so different from American boys
who grow up dreaming of going to West Point.
   In Bangkok, Natee Wongissares dreamed of becoming a West Point
cadet. ``It was my life goal since I was 12 to get to West Point,''
he says. ``Since I saw a movie about Eisenhower when he was a
general I wanted to be just like him.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Records were made to be broken, but sometimes, a
bit of history fades with their passing. Such was the case when
Warren Luhrs sailed from New York to San Francisco in 80 days 20
hours, breaking a record that had stood since the era when clipper
ships roamed the seas.

   When Warren Luhrs sailed into San Francisco on Lincoln's Birthday
in his 60-foot sloop Thursday's Child, he killed the last living
remnant of one of the nation's most picturesque and romantic
chapters, the era of the clipper ships.
   Luhrs' time of 80 days 20 hours from New York to San Francisco
beat a record that had stood since 1854, when Millard Fillmore had
just turned over the White House to Franklin Pierce, France had an
emperor and the world's first oil well was still five years away.
   The old mark of 89 days eight hours had held off challengers for
135 years. It had been set by the clipper Flying Cloud, a
masterpiece of master shipbuilder Donald McKay, which was navigated
by the skipper's wife, Mrs. Josiah Creesy, with Himself at the helm.
   Creesy, his 40-odd member crew and his passengers were in a rush
because there was gold in California. His cargo could fetch $1 an
egg and $40 for a quart of whiskey.
   Clipper ships, the greyhounds of the sea, were built for speed.
Anything fast in those days could be called a clipper. Clipper
sleds. Clipper buggies.
   McKay, a native of Nova Scotia, turned out swift, sharp-prowed
and daringly overcanvased fliers at his yard in East Boston. There
were to be 14 instances when a tall ship logged more than 400 miles
in 24 hours. Ten were McKay creations including the fastest,
Champion of the Seas, which once covered 465 miles in a day's run.
   Flying Cloud, in fact, broke her own record in 1854. Three years
earlier, with her white and gold goddess figurehead cutting the
waves, Flying Cloud sped around the Horn with Eleanor Creesy
navigating past the rocks and through snow and gales to beat the old
record by more than a week. The crew, who had blown out several
topmasts under Creesy's iron rule _ that time was money and speed
advertising of the finest kind, promptly deserted for the gold
fields.
   The clipper era was actually short-lived and marked the last
undisputed primacy of the American merchant marine. American
clippers in the opium trade to China set speed records all over the
world. Their names were as glorious as the ships: Comet, Eagle Wing,
Westward Ho, Sovereign of the Seas, Young America, Sea Witch. (Sea
Witch sailed from Hong Kong to New York in 74 days 14 hours in 1849).
   In getting to California pronto in the 1850s to pan gold in the
Sierras there was no lesser of evils. Overland there were Indians
and deserts and mountains. Transshipping across the Isthmus of
Panama there were malaria and yellow fever. Around the Horn there
was ... the Horn.
   Rounding the Horn is like walking up a dark alley at midnight
with the Cape being the mugger. Rounding it east to west is
particularly life-shortening because the westerlies whirl unimpeded
around the world goaded by incessant storms into some of the most
awesome waves in the world. A sailing vessel could spend a month
battling gales to double the Cape. Some gave up and turned around to
sail to the Orient via the Cape of Good Hope at the tip of Africa. A
speed merchant like the frosty-tempered Creesy keeping his foot to
the pedal only made the hazards greater.
   The Americans had another unsung hero, Matthew Fontaine Maury.
Maury was a Navy lieutenant who had been beached due to a leg
injury, so he was given a berth as superintendent of the sleepy
Department of Charts and Instruments.
   He began collecting log books from as many voyages as he could
find and gradually drew up charts of wind patterns and currents.
Armed with these, Americans became, briefly, monarchs of the oceans.
The era didn't last because the Civil War concentrated the nation's
energies away from the sea and because of the development of the
ironclad steamboat. McKay's last clipper, the Glory of the Seas
launched in 1868, ended her days as a frozen fish warehouse.
   About the only glory remaining were the old clipper records.
   Records and the seas have always conspired to lure mankind out of
his easy chair. The Blue Ribband for the fastest time was always a
coveted trophy in the heyday of the trans-Atlantic liners. But
yachtsmen, if they ventured on the high seas at all, usually endured
cold, wet and hunger until they reached distant ports at the other
end.
   Joshua Slocum, another Nova Scotian, became the first amateur to
sail alone around the world at the turn of the century but, with an
old alarm clock as his navigational timepiece, he was not intent on
speed. Indeed, he would freeload for months at a time en route at
hospitable yacht clubs.
   With transoceanic jets leaving few worlds to conquer, however,
yachtsmen increasingly looked to old records to test their mettle.
Sir Francis Chichester circled the globe with Gypsy Moth IV in 1966
at age 66 in 226 days with only one stop. Three years later another
Englishman, Robin Knox-Johnston, who a psychiatrist said was
``distressingly normal'' before and afterward, won a race around the
world in 313 days to become the first non-stop, solo
circumnavigator. Another contestant, a Frenchman named Bernard
Moitessier, was winning on the home stretch. He decided, however, he
preferred his own solitary company at sea to that of his fellow
humans ashore and sailed on for another half of the globe, finally
stopping in Tahiti.
   Since then, racing across large bodies of ocean alone or with
crew has become commonplace. It has become particularly appealing to
Frenchmen who excel at sailing high-speed multihull sailboats vast
distances with occasional interruptions when the technology falls
apart and sinks.
   Luhrs, a Rhode Islander, is also a transoceanic soloist as is
Dodge Morgan, a former journalist turned manufacturer, now living in
Maine after setting a non-stop record around the globe of 150 days.
   If Luhrs' record stands for another 135 years, it won't be for
lack of challengers. Even as he finished under the Golden Gate
Bridge, two French persons, Phillipe Monnet who left New York Jan.
8, and Anne Liardet, a 27-year-old sailing with her fiance, had
already rounded the Horn. Monnet reportedly hit an iceberg; Liardet
was ahead of Flying Cloud's time but behind Luhrs'.
   Luhrs said on arrival in San Francisco ``once is enough.'' This
leaves Eleanor Creesy with some consolation. She is the only
navigator to have guided her husband around the Horn to a record _
twice.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Infertility is a problem among aging, wildborn
gorillas, and few zoo gorillas were born in the wild. By adapting a
human artificial fertilization technique for use on wildborn
gorillas, scientists hope to expand the genetic pool and guard
against inbreeding.
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Becky and Mimbo have the same
problems as many infertile couples, but theirs have greater
ramifications: They represent a possible threat to their species.
   Infertility among aging, wildborn gorillas prompted specialists
to adapt a human artificial fertilization technique for use on
Becky, a lowland gorilla at the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo in Colorado
Springs.
   ``The hope is to have a diverse genetic pool so the gorillas
don't become inbred, by managing the population to the maximum
genetic representation of all captive gorillas,'' says Dr. Paul
Calle, Cheyenne Mountain Zoo veterinarian.
   ``If three of 10 gorillas are responsible for 80 percent of the
offspring, the contribution of the others get lost over time.''
   Estimates by experts on the wild gorilla population range from
10,000 to 70,000.
   Only 15 percent to 20 percent of the 297 captive gorillas in
North America are wildborn, or of the foundation stock for carrying
on the bloodline. Experts say many of them are reaching the end of
their reproductive years.
   Such is the case with Becky, 32, and Mimbo, 26, who have just one
surviving offspring.
   The Denver and Cheyenne Mountain zoos are working under a
two-year grant from the Institute of Museum Services. Last
September, they assembled a team including zoo veterinarians, an
infertility specialist and a reproductive physiologist to perform
Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer (GIFT) on Becky. It was the first
reproductive procedure ever tried on a gorilla, according to Dr.
Richard Cambre, a Denver Zoo veterinarian.
   Becky did not become pregnant, but the surgery did provide
information on the gorilla's reproductive system that could increase
the chances for success when she undergoes the procedure again.
   Similarities in the reproductive systems of humans and gorillas
make gorillas likely candidates for artificial fertilization
techniques such as GIFT, says Dr. William Yee, a University of
California at Irvine infertility specialist who performed Becky's
surgery.
   ``We learned that, like in humans, gorillas respond
differently,'' Yee says. ``It seemed (Becky's) eggs were not mature
enough.
   ``In the normal process of reproduction, after the egg is
released, the Fallopian tube picks up the egg from the ovary. Inside
the Fallopian tube is where fertilization occurs.
   ``With Gamete IntraFallopian Transfer, we're placing the eggs and
sperm inside the tube so when we're finished, we're assured the egg
and sperm are present in the spot where fertilization occurs.''
   GIFT has a live birthrate of 25 percent among women, compared
with 17 percent with in-vitro fertilization, he says.
   Similar efforts have been made at the Dallas Zoo, where three
gorillas have undergone unsuccessful reproductive surgeries
following Becky's, says Naida Loskutoff, a Ph.D. candidate at Texas
A&amp;M who participated in Becky's procedure.
   Eggs were collected for future artificial inseminations from a
32-year-old and a 17-year-old physically unable to bear offspring.
The third, like Becky an infertile female in her 30s, was
artifically inseminated, Loskutoff says.
   Conservationists find the prospect of apparently infertile
gorillas producing offspring encouraging for the species' future.
   In cases where a species exists only in captivity, often because
of habitat destruction, zoos have crossed the line from
entertainment to conservation to ensure the species' survival,
Cambre says.
   The goal in such cases is to return the species to the wild once
survival can be ensured, he says.
   Their numbers don't place lowland gorillas among the most
endangered species, but they are among the biggest draws to zoos.
Experts say their popularity has increased since the recent film,
``Gorillas in the Mist,'' which depicts Dian Fossey's work with the
more severely endangered mountain gorilla.
   ``If you sit and watch a family of gorillas, you see a little
insight to human behavior,'' says Lester Fisher, coordinator of the
Species Survival Plan gorilla committee based at Chicago's Lincoln
Park Zoo.
   Natural breeding among captive gorilla groups is preferred over
surgical procedures, and Fisher says the natural method is proving
increasingly successful, especially among larger zoo populations.
   ``Our breeding program in our North American SSP has definitely
turned the corner,'' Fisher says.
   To that end, the SSP committee for lowland gorillas documents the
family trees of captive gorillas in North America and monitors
inter-zoo transfers of the animals to avoid inbreeding and the
subsequent loss of genetic diversity.
   ``Genetic diversity means the animals carry a variety of genes,
representing a cross-section of the population,'' Fisher says. ``In
the wild, if you have normal groups, you would have total genetic
diversity.
   ``Since we are no longer taking the animal from the wild, we are
dealing with a captive population and we have to look at a bigger
picture so we can look specifically at the problems of managing
husbandry and reproduction.''

   Deputy District Attorney Grace Van Owen
frequently stumbles over her own seriousness. ``Grace is very much
in her element in the courtroom,'' says actress Susan Dey, who plays
her on NBC's ``L.A. Law.''
   ``But I battle with her in terms of how serious she is.''
   At the moment, Dey is prosecuting another of Van Owen's hopeless
cases, outfoxed by a sly attorney and facing a jury swayed by
sympathetic defendants. On the courtroom set on a sound stage at
20th Century Fox Studios, three old-timers are on trial for robbing
a bank.
   Lew Ayres, 81, white-thatched and slightly stooped, has the jury
hanging on every word. ``They robbed the bank because they couldn't
draw out their senior citizens money,'' he says.
   ``They're very sweet men,'' concedes prosecutor Van Owen, adding,
``who committed a very serious crime.'' She doesn't smile. Her suit,
a black-and-gray striped jacket with padded shoulders and a black
skirt, reinforces her no-nonsense attitude.
   Although some of the comic scenes in ``L.A. Law'' are played at
her expense, Van Owen is by no means a loser. As the love interest
of attorney Michael Kuzak (Harry Hamlin), she's bright and talented,
beautiful and sexy.
   Back at the makeup trailer parked outside the stage, Dey ponders
the paradox that is Grace. ``She's in a very serious environment.
She feels safest when she's at work. She's most insecure when she's
away from that environment,'' Dey says.
   ``I like her best in a dilemma, when the crisis comes. In a
dramatic or comedic conflict. She has a vulnerability in a conflict.
She's really a powerful woman. She's strong. When something gets to
her, it's wonderful. She gets frustrated. She can be outwitted
because she's so serious. Her determination boxes her in.''
   Makeup artists Lee Mitchell and Candy Conery work on her face for
the next scene. Then Sarah, her 10-year-old, enters the trailer.
``Boo-Boo's here!'' Dey exclaims, jumping off the high makeup chair
to hug her.
   Sarah is from a previous marriage. Dey is now married to
television producer Bernard Sofronski.
   Van Owen isn't known for doing things on impulse, but on a show
early this year she did suddenly kiss Victor Sifuentes (Jimmy Smits).
   ``Nothing's come of that yet,'' says Dey. ``For us, the moment
was so wonderful for Grace to fulfill this fantasy. But there's no
talk that anything will come of it. Steven Bochco said it was just
something Grace has always wanted to do.
   ``That was one of the few times I got to work with other members
of the cast besides Harry. I'm usually in court. It was a new
experience and it was fun, too. I'm kind of lucky. There's a lot of
give and take. I work the long hours in the courtroom, which makes
you kind of crazy. But I get to work with all these wonderful guest
stars.''
   She was not in the ``L.A. Law'' pilot, but was cast after running
into executive producer Bochco at a school function for their
children. Bochco was looking for a love interest for Kuzak, as well
as another view of the law.
   Dey says she spent about a month in court with a deputy public
defender researching an earlier role for another pilot. She used
that as background for the character of Van Owen.
   The daughter of a newspaper editor from upstate New York, Dey had
done commercials and modeling before making her debut as Laurie in
``The Partridge Family'' in 1970. The show, starring Shirley Jones
and David Cassidy, was about a singing family.
   ``It was pure luck that I got `The Partridge Family,''' says Dey.
``I thought I was an adult. I was 16 when I did the pilot and 17
when we started the show. I was 21 when we finished.''
   Her next series was ``Loves Me, Loves Me Not,'' a romantic comedy
co-starring Kenneth Gilman that lasted only a few weeks in 1977. She
was also in the short-lived CBS prime-time soap opera ``Emerald
Point N.A.S.''

   Acting in the comedy ``Cafe Crown,'' at
Broadway's Brooks Atkinson Theater, is ``like being in a musical
without having to sing,'' says Anne Jackson.
   ``It's such a joyous play to do. There are 18 actors; it's an
ensemble piece. Audiences seem to have a really good time.''
   Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson's husband of 41 years, plays flamboyant
impresario-actor David Cole in ``Cafe Crown.'' His actress wife
plays his actress wife.
   ``Cafe Crown'' is a revival of Hy Kraft's 1942 comedy, which was
the first Broadway success for director Elia Kazan. It's set in the
real Cafe Royal, which opened in 1920 amid 80 Yiddish theaters, a
haven for deal-making actors and eccentric waiters.
   Wallach's character is fighting to keep Yiddish theater alive.
Another character, a gifted young actor based on Paul Muni, wants to
leave the Yiddish theater for Hollywood.
   ``Remember those ads, `You don't have to be Jewish to like Levy's
rye bread?''' Wallach says. ``You don't have to be Jewish to enjoy
`Cafe Crown.'
   ``It's a family play, well-plotted. The play reflects Hy Kraft's
personality. There is no meanness in it, no discomfort.
   ``The decline of the Yiddish theater was based on the fact that
young people didn't want to learn Yiddish,'' Wallach adds. ``I
didn't learn it. When my parents argued, they spoke Polish, German
or Yiddish.''
   Wallach's most difficult acting in ``Cafe Crown'' is telling the
young actor he'll release him from his contract, giving him a chance
at Hollywood. ``It's a very moving thing to me,'' Wallach says. ``I
say, `What right have I to demand your sacrifice?' One generation is
saying to another, `We must move on.'It's in only two lines. In
acting, you just have to go along with the notes _ like music.''
   The couple has acted together in Murray Schisgal's ``The Typist
and the Tiger,'' ``Luv'' and ``Twice Around the Park.''
   ``Cafe Crown'' opened in October off-Broadway at the Public
Theater. A hit, it moved to Broadway Feb. 18. Fyvush Finkel and
Felix Fibich, both veterans of Yiddish theater, are in the cast. So
is Bob Dishy.
   Wallach turned down a film to do the Broadway run. ``The movie
was interesting but I love doing the play,'' he says. ``I didn't
want to go to Germany for two months. I'd rather spend it on
Broadway.''
   In 1953 he turned down the role of Maggio _ which then went to
Frank Sinatra _ in the film ``From Here to Eternity.'' He says, ``It
was the choice between that or a brilliant play by Tennessee
Williams, `Camino Real,' where he'd tailored a role for me. Kazan
was directing. It wasn't an act of heroism. It was a choice.
   ``I'm a contented actor. I read of actors making $800,000. I'm
happy doing what I'm doing.
   ``Once the ego drive to be in the limelight, to make a killing,
to be the biggest, flattens out, you begin to relish the work for
the work.
   ``We paid our dues in the theater,'' says Wallach. ``We spent
years working with great stars, learning from the ground up. We were
bequeathed certain values in the theater that are important to us.
So when we find projects we want to do, we do them.''
   Miss Jackson is writing a second book. Her first, ``Early
Stages,'' ends with the birth of the couple's son, now a married
father of two little boys who's working on special effects on ``Star
Trek 5.'' The couple's two daughters are actresses, one married, one
getting married in May.
   Though they also act independently, Miss Jackson says, ``We do
have a lot of fun working together. We're both quite good character
actors. The characterizations that we come up with make it seem like
it's a different person we're relating to.''
   Wallach's acting in ``Cafe Crown'' changes, he says, depending on
what Bob Dishy does as the legendary Cafe Royal busboy. ``I never
know if he's going to be polite or irascible. There's a little
mystery in his acting, which is why he's always interesting.''
   The rather small part of Mrs. Cole originally didn't appeal to
Miss Jackson. ``I thought they just wanted me because of Eli. When I
got involved in it, I realized it was better than I thought,'' she
says.
   ``Her role is very important in `Cafe Crown,''' says Wallach.
``They talk about her before she comes on. She has one scene with me
and one scene in the final act. It's really not much. But it's so
carefully woven into the fabric of the play that the character
emerges very strongly.''
   ``It was a surprise to me,'' the actress says. ``And it's fun to
play.''
   One day, during the off-Broadway run, Miss Jackson climbed on a
chair in their apartment, fell and missed four performances. Wallach
opens his mouth to comment on her understudy, hears ``Be careful
what you say about how good she was'' from his spouse and says
mildly, ``I was happy when you came back.''

   Once a place only for the penguin, adventurer and
the scientist, Antarctica now is attracting the tourist and casual
visitor, increasing the danger to Earth's last pristine environment.
An Associated Press correspondent traveled to the Frozen Continent
recently and this is what he found.

   Like a monument to the end of
Antarctica's age of innocence, the Bahia Paraiso's badly gashed
orange hull rises out of ice-blue waters.
   Penguins calmly perch atop the overturned vessel, unaware of the
danger in thin oily sheen in the water around them. Most of the tens
of thousands of gallons of diesel fuel that spilled out in the
shipwreck Jan. 28 has since evaporated, but more is slowly leaking.
   Times are changing at Earth's last frontier.
   Countries eager to stake or reinforce their claims to a slice of
the Frozen Continent are dispatching ships and aircraft, bulldozers
and amphibious trucks. With nationalistic fanfare, they are building
new bases and launching new research projects.
   During the austral summer, well-heeled tourists arrive by the
hundreds each week on cruise ships, supply vessels or military
transport planes contracted by specilized travel agencies. Even
private yachts and polar skiing expeditions are venturing into the
last place on Earth where no passport is needed.
   Accidents are happening, and in the case of the Bahia Paraiso
Antarctic wildlife paid the price. A host of legal, environmental
and highly political questions are surging up like the hazardous
icebergs in Antarctica's poorly charted seas.
   ``You're confronted daily with an ever-hastening chain of
events,'' Peter Wilkniss, polar programs chief for the
Washington-based National Science Foundation, told a visiting
Associated Press correspondent at Palmer Station. The foundation
directs all U.S. research in Antarctica.
   Wilkniss advocates increased international regulation.
   ``There's nothing that prevents anyone from doing anything they
want,'' he said. ``I don't think we can live with that situation.''
   He described the continent's 5.1 million square miles as ``a
judicial no-man's land.''
   No laws apply to Antarctica because no one owns it, according to
the terms of the Antarctic Treaty. The pact was signed in 1961 by 12
countries who agreed to put all territorial claims on hold for at
least 30 years and reserve Antarctica for peaceful research.
   Eight other nations since have joined the treaty with full voting
powers, while an additional 18 have agreed to abide by its
provisions and hold observer status. The treaty nations meet about
every two years.
   The organization recently drafted a plan to permit strictly
regulated exploration and exploitation of the continent's mineral
resources after 1991, when the treaty itself is up for review.
   But it is only beginning to grapple with such issues as the
proliferation of bases, marine and air safety, indemnification, and
medical and rescue facilities.
   The wreck of the Bahia Paraiso exemplifies the region's
predicament.
   The 435-foot supply and research vessel, operated by the
Argentine navy, called on Palmer Station in glacier-rimmed Arthur
Bay on Jan. 28 so the 81 tourists on board could take a look around.
It also carried a crew of 235.
   On its way out of the bay, it ran aground in a passage marked on
sea charts as containing ``danger ledges and pinnacles.'' Crew and
passengers got off safely in lifeboats and found shelter at the
station.
   The ship, over a period of four days, gradually rolled over and
sank. About 180,000 gallons of diesel oil from its storage tanks
spilled into the water.
   During the austral summer season, more than 30 cruises were
scheduled to call on Palmer, bringing an average 100 tourists on
each occasion.
   Tourism is uncontrolled and, to some, out of control.
   ``In 1982, we got three cruise ships all season,'' said Bruce
Carter of ITT-Antarctic Services, which is contracted to supply and
maintain Palmer Station. ``This year we got as many as five a week.
We'd sometimes get two in one day.''
   The Science Foundation briefly tried to ban tourist visits last
year, arguing that it interfered with research. But the ban was
lifted when influential Americans complained, claiming a right to
see how their tax dollars are being spent. The Bahia Paraiso's
tourists included 46 Americans who paid from $3,000 to nearly $7,000
for the cruise.
   The station's staff includes a medical corpsman with a small
one-room clinic for treating the two to four dozen people at the
base. It is not designed for handling a maritime disaster.

   And station workers said only fair weather prevented a disaster.
They said most of the Bahia Paraiso's lifeboats were open,
inflatable rafts without oars or motors. The day was calm and they
could be towed ashore by station workboats without difficulty. But
they could have overturned or been blown out to sea if the volatile
Antarctic weather had taken a turn for the worse, the workers said.
   In response to the diesel spill, the National Science Foundation
dispatched navy and civilian pollution control experts with 52 tons
of specialized equipment. The mission cost more than $2 million. The
Chilean and Argentine navies also sent costly clean-up missions.
   The clean-up ended in mid-March, although the Bahia Paraiso still
holds about 63,000 gallons that can't be safely reached and pumped
out. It could spill if the ship breaks up in a winter storm or
simply seep out for many months as the wreck gradually
disintegrates. Experts say it would be too costly to haul the wreck
away.
   The area of the spill teems with wildlife, including penguins,
skuas, cormorants, Arctic terns and other birds. Seals and whales
frequently pass through the bay.
   Scientists say there already exists indirect evidence that many
penguins and other birds were poisoned by the spill, but they have
been unable to determine the extent of the damage. A special team of
15 researchers from the United States, Argentina and Chile has
arrived to begin a comprehensive study on the spill's environmental
impact. It will take years to complete.
   Yet there is no way a claim for damages can be made. Since the
United States has no property rights to the area at or around Palmer
Station, it has no legal grounds for seeking compensation. The area
of the accident, on the Antarctic Peninsula, is claimed by Chile,
Argentina and Great Britain.
   Chile recently announced plans to propose, at the next Antarctic
Treaty meeting in Paris in October, an article to hold each country
financially responsible for environmental or other damage. The
Science Foundation plans to press for agreement on cost sharing in
clean-up of spills and other accidents, and for formation of an
international coordinating office for emergencies.
   But there could be some opposition.
   ``We must act with prudence, without falling into decisions that
could be a little hasty,'' said Roberto Daverede, head of Antarctic
affairs for the Argentine Foreign Ministry. Argentina claims a thick
wedge of the continent and, like the other claimant nations, rejects
any foreign or international jurisdiction.
   Daverede played down the effects of the Bahia Paraiso spill.
   ``This is far from being a natural catastrophe,'' he said. He
called the wreck ``an isolated incident.''
   Nonetheless, less than a month after the Bahia Paraiso accident a
Peruvian research ship ran aground 300 miles away, near King George
Island. The vessel, called the Humboldt and touted as the flagship
of Peru's territorial claim, also spilled some diesel fuel but was
soon refloated.
   By world standards neither accident would qualify as a major
environmental disaster.
   ``I've walked away from bigger diesel spills than this where
nothing died, absolutely nothing,'' said Jim O'Brien of Gretna, La.,
a pollution control expert hired by the U.S. government for the
Bahia Paraiso clean-up.
   But there is special concern that Antarctica's environment may be
especially fragile. There's also a growing belief that its huge cold
mass plays a key role in long-term global weather patterns.
   There also are some indications that the strain on the local
environment may be straining political relations.
   For decades, a unique spirit of international friendship and
cooperation has reigned in Antarctica. Political conficts were left
at the doorstep, and missions from such idealogically distinct
countries as the Soviet Union and right-wing Chile lived as
next-door neighbors, sharing supplies, equipment and a drink or two
on the cold nights.
   In early March, however, the Chileans criticized what they called
the poor waste handling at the Soviet Bellinghousen base, literally
a stone's from their own Marsh base on King George Island. They said
they would file a complaint at the next treaty meeting.

   For two decades scientists
enjoyed a cloistered existence at this U.S. research center,
studying wildlife in conditions as unspoiled as anywhere in the
world.
   No longer.
   The mission of Palmer Station, perched on a gravelly point
beneath a towering glacier, changed overnight when the Argentine
supply ship Bahia Paraiso ran aground Jan. 28 and spilled its cargo
of diesel fuel just offshore.
   ``This is changing from a place where people studied untouched
nature long-term to a place where people study the effects of an oil
spill long-term,'' said Margaret Rubega, an ornithologist from The
University of California-Irvine. She was studying skuas and kelp
gulls at the station when the wreck occurred.
   ``As an ecosystem that was basically undisturbed, it's a horrible
loss. Really it's tragic,'' Miss Rubega said.
   William Fraser, an ornithologist from the Point Reyes (Calif.)
Bird Observatory, said there already are indications of some
poisoning of penguins, skuas, cormorants and other bird species that
populate the rocky islands around the spill.
   ``We have no direct evidence of heavy mortality, but we have
indirect evidence,'' he said.
   Scavanging giant petrels who live on the rocky islands around the
base were feeding their newborn chicks an unusually rich diet of
penguin meat after the spill, Fraser said.
   ``What this means is you had large numbers of penguins dying
locally.''
   In addition, 726 pairs of polar skuas were nesting in the area
when the spill occurred.
   ``Every single one lost their chicks,'' Frazer said.
   He stressed that the evidence was not conclusive. A team of 15
U.S. scientists has just begun more comprehensive studies.
   Ironically, the site offers an excellent base of information for
a before-and-after examination of a spill. The wealth of data on
bird and marine life collected since the station went into operation
can be used for comparison, Fraser said.
   ``It's a terrible disaster, but it's an incredible natural
experiment.''

   ABOARD THE R@_ Ship captain Grant
Philpott says a chill runs through him every time he passes Sail
Rock.
   The 91-foot pinnacle rises out of waters 700 feet deep like a
sailor's bad dream.
   ``You get to wondering how many (others) are lying just under the
water,'' Philpott said.
   According to Antarctic sea charts, plenty of them are on the
jagged bottom at Sail Rock near Deception Island, ready to rip
through the strongest of hulls like the reinforced one of the Polar
Duke, a modern U.S. research ship.
   But even the charts can't be trusted. They are loaded with
hazards marked ``PA'' (position approximate) and ``ED'' (existence
doubtful). Some areas have never been sounded.
   ``There's a lot of old data being used,'' Philpott said.
   Throw in roving icebergs as tall as high-rise buildings and
sudden storms with winds up to 90 knots or more, and you've got a
place where even the best-run ship may well bump into something
sooner or later.
   The 219-foot Polar Duke has state-of-the-art navigational
equipment, including two radars, two depth sounders and a site-scan
sonar. Nonetheless, it ran into uncharted shoals two years ago and
put a $1-million dent in the hull.
   A British ice-breaker, the Endurance, hit an iceberg earlier this
year and still had a patched hull when it came to the assistance of
a grounded Peruvian research ship, the Humboldt, in late February.
   Philpott said he ``grew up on the ice'' of his native
Newfoundland in Canada and has navigated in Antarctica since 1985.
Experience is essential, he said.
   But the increasing number of ships plying the Antarctic coast is
raising questions about the judgment of some crews. When the
Argentine research vessel Bahia Paraiso wrecked on shoals Jan. 28,
it was attempting to cruise through an area marked on sea charts
with the warning: ``Dangerous Ledges and Pinnacles.''
   Once upon a time, a ship in these waters sailed virtually alone.
   On a recent 8,500-mile expedition, however, the Chilean ship
Capitan Alcazar reported sighting 27 other vessels, including two
private yachts and three tourist cruise ships, from a host of
countries from Singapore to Spain.
   More traffic is expected to produce more mishaps. But according
to Philpott there's a saving grace: it also means more ships to come
to your rescue.
   ``The biggest danger is the lack of other ships if you do get in
trouble,'' he said.

   Here are some facts and figures about Antarctica:
   HISTORY: Britain's Capt. James Cook is believed to have first
entered Antarctic waters during an expedition in 1773-75, and he was
followed by several other mariners who discovered land there in the
early 1800s. The American Capt. Charles Wilkes first identified it
as a continent in 1840 when he traced 1,500 miles of coastline. The
first inland expeditions were carried out by Norway's Leonard
Kristensen and Britain's Robert F. Scott and Ernest Shackleton in
the late 1800s and early 1900s. Roald Amundsen of Norway reached the
South Pole in December 1911 and Scott arrived a month later, but his
four-man party perished.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GEOGRAPHY: Antarctica is 5.1 million square miles in area, larger
than all of Europe and now has been determined to have 17,500 miles
of rugged coastline. Its uneven surface of rock and gravel descends
toward the center like a soup bowl, under the vast weight of a
rounded cap of ice more than a mile deep in some places. The total
volume of ice on the continent is equivalent to 72 percent of all
water on earth. The continent is divided by the Transantarctic
Mountain Range and includes other clusters of peaks including Visson
Massif, the highest at 16,864 feet above sea level.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CLIMATE: The coldest continent, Antartica's inland temperatures
remain almost constantly below freezing. On the Antarctic Peninsula
temperatures can rise above freezing during the austral summer. The
lowest reading ever, at the Soviet Union's Vostok Station on July
21, 1983, was minus 89.2 degrees Celcius. There is little
precipitation in Antarctica, averaging four inches a year.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   POLITICS: The continent is administered by the Antarctic Treaty,
signed by 12 nations in 1961 who agreed to suspend all territorial
claims and dedicate the region to peaceful research. Eight other
nations have since become voting members, while 18 more enjoy
observer status. The treaty is up for review in 1991. Seven nations
make direct territorial claims to part of the continent, with some
claims overlapping. Other countries, including The United States and
the Soviet Union, refuse to recognize any claims.

<TEXT>
   An ambitious experiment to allow Chinese to
own their homes has halted in this seaside city because of
complaints from powerful officials and austerity policies in Beijing.
   Other experiments in housing reform throughout China are also off
to a slow start due to the sky-high price of living space and lack
of confidence in the government.
   ``The policies are in contradiction. We don't know what the
future holds,'' said Qin Shiyu, a housing reform official in Yantai,
a breezy town in Shandong province on the Bohai Sea.
   In Beijing, apartments cost the equivalent of about $45 a square
foot, meaning that an average college graduate would have to save
his total income for 70 years to buy a basic three-room flat.
   In crowded Shanghai prices can be even higher.
   A recent report by the official Xinhua News Agency said living
space per person in a Shanghai neighborhood amounted to nine by nine
feet, or 54 square feet.
   ``And that's only for the relatively well off,'' it said.
   Thousands, it said, were living in 21.6 square feet of space.
   In Yantai, prices have been more reasonable and 1,600 homes have
been sold in about two years. But 16,000 families are still waiting
for a chance to buy.
   Yu Bingmo, a worker at the Yantai General Synthetic Leather
Factory, was lucky.
   In October, he scraped together his life savings, took out a loan
and bought his three-room, 600-square-foot apartment _ or about 30
feet by 20 feet _ for about 12,000 yuan ($3,243).
   ``It may mean a few more years of lousy cigarettes but I was
willing to take the risk,'' said Yu, 57, as he sat with his wife in
the living room. ``It's not a palace but at least it's mine.''
   China began housing reform in the mid-1980s in an attempt to
correct a serious housing shortage that had left millions of Chinese
urban dwellers with nowhere to live.
   The plan picked up urgency over the past few years as part of
China's effort to reform its heavily subsidized housing system.
   In China's countryside, houses are privately owned and passed
from generation to generation. But in the cities, home to 40 percent
of the country's 1.1 billion people, housing has been built and
maintained by state funds and rented at rock-bottom prices.
   ``China's housing industry is a welfare undertaking making no
profits at all,'' said a recent edition of the Beijing Review.
   China also looked at private housing as a way to channel people's
money into the country's infrastructure and halt spending on
consumer goods. They reasoned that less consumer spending would
limit record high inflation of around 30 percent.
   In addition, reformers wanted to battle corrupt officials who use
their power to secure bigger and better apartments for themselves
and their friends.
   In 1986, Yantai and three other cities were selected as the first
group of pilot cities for urban housing reform.
   In Yantai, rent was raised almost 2000 percent to 1.24 yuan a
square meter (3 cents a square foot). To Chinese accustomed to
paying around 3 percent of their salaries for rent the jump was
substantial.
   Next, the housing department ordered businesses in the city to
add a subsidy of 23.5 percent of each worker's salary to his
paycheck to make up for the rent increase.
   As rent payments to work units increased, the state cut the
amount it gave them for housing. Residents were also made
responsible for the upkeep of their homes.
   ``You've got a broken toilet, well fix it yourself,'' said Wang
Qingyuan, head of the Real Estate Management Office in Yantai. ``The
end result is that people are being made more responsible for their
lives.''
   Workers were encouraged to buy their houses at cut-rate prices,
one-tenth to one-fifth of the market rate. Special low- or
no-interest loans were offered.
   To discourage speculation, resale was permitted only after five
years.
   The sales pace was quick.
   But, China's economy was overheating. To cut spending, the State
Council, China's Cabinet, ordered all money received in the sales of
housing frozen in bank accounts for two years. And the Ministry of
Finance clamped a 40 percent tax on those funds.
   Other problems were brewing.
   Yantai, known for its clean air and fresh fish, is a retirement
area for some of China's most powerful former officials. When rents
went up, they complained. Some went on rent strikes, others used
``connections'' to avoid paying.
   The effect on Yantai's reform was deadening. Work units, which
own all the housing, stopped selling. A halt in sales meant housing
construction stopped.
   ``We were like a truck moving downhill and then somebody slammed
on the brakes,'' said one official. ``It was a pretty big shock.''
   Other cities, like Beijing and Shanghai, have also begun housing
reform but to them it only means putting a few houses on the market.
Their success has been even less notable than Yantai's.
   Because housing prices are so high and no attempts have been made
to change the rent system, only successful individual businessmen,
still a rarity in China, are able to afford their own home.
   On a recent afternoon, Sun Xiaofeng, a cab driver who makes 300
yuan ($81) a month, a good deal by Chinese standards, strolled into
the Beijing Real Estate Exchange.
   ``I'm just curious,'' he said. ``I'll never be able to buy a
house, not in 10,000 years.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Slaves of New York''</HEAD>

   ``Slaves of New York''
   
   The film production team of Ismail Merchant and James Ivory has
specialized in literary adapations, creating such cinematic jewels
as ``A Room With a View,'' ``Maurice'' and ``The Bostonians.'' All
three movies had their bases in works with rich backdrops and meaty
characters.
   Now they've used their production and directorial skills in
trying to turn a hunk of coal into a diamond. Unfortunately,
``Slaves of New York'' doesn't glitter. It's still a rough, dark
lump.
   ``Slaves of New York'' is also a meandering melange of
superficialites. It was written by Tama Janowitz, who also wrote the
book of short stories from which it was adapted. Both are shallow
works. There is no flesh and not even an interesting skeleton upon
which to fashion a story that will grab us, inspire us, make us feel
something or just entertain us.
   The action, such as it is, takes place in the self-absorbed and
limited downtown art world, an environment that works hard at
causing narcolepsy.
   Eleanor (Bernadette Peters), a copyreader at an East Village
newspaper, is an artsy type _ she designs outrageous hats. She also
is massively insecure and doesn't think she measures up to her
bohemian friends. She lives with a pseudo-artist named Stash (Adam
Coleman Howard) who dots the world with all those cookie cutter
cartoons and graffiti-like drawings the downtown world calls art.
The miserably highstrung Stash is having an affair with Daria
(Madeleine Potter) who's having an affair with Marley (Nick Corri).
   ``Slaves of New York'' is Bernadette Peters first movie role
since 1981's ``Pennies From Heaven.'' Since then, she's gone on to
greater glory on Broadway, receiving a Tony award from her
performance as Dot in Stephen Sondheim's ``Sunday in the Park With
George,'' and starring in ``Song and Dance'' and ``Into the Woods.''
   She is terribly miscast in ``Slaves of New York,'' and her
talents largely go unused.
   Mary Beth Hurt is wonderful as an acidic art dealer, but we see
too little of her. Ditto Tammy Grimes as Georgette.
   Ivory's direction lacks heart; he just doesn't seem to like what
he's doing or even understand it. But then again, Janowitz hasn't
given him very much material. Too much of the movie seems like guess
work and hence incomplete.
   ``Slaves of New York'' was produced by Ismail Merchant and Gary
Hendler and is released by Tri-Star Pictures. This film is rated R.

<HEAD>Video View: ``Moon Over Parador,'' ``A Summer to Remember''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   
   ``Moon Over Parador'' (MCA Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated
PG-13)
   
   The farce ``Moon Over Parador'' is better than it seems at first,
but it's nowhere near as good as it could be, with Paul Mazursky as
director and actors Richard Dreyfuss, Sonia Braga and Raul Julia.
   It's a little like ``Tootsie'' goes ``Bananas.''
   Dreyfuss, who puts in a very good performance, plays an ambitious
actor in search of a really meaty role. He inadvertently finds it
when he is kidnapped to fill in when the dictator of a Caribbean
country (Parador) where he'd been at work on a film dies. Julia is
the evil police chief, the power behind the power. Braga, who had
been the dictator's mistress, takes Dreyfuss on and gets him to do
some good in her country.
   But underneath it all, the movie is about acting and entertaining.
   Jonathan Winters, Fernando Rey, Sammy Davis Jr., Ed Asner, Dick
Cavett and Ike Pappas make appearances. Julia's character, educated
at Harvard University, talks about Wayne Newton and Lou Grant and is
fascinated with acting and movie making.
   In Parador, Dreyfuss' character gets a copy of the Sunday New
York Times and reads about acting opportunities. Dreyfuss and Braga
``perform'' for an applauding crowd of Paradorans at a beach by
smooching. As dictator, Dreyfuss recreates a scene in which the real
dictator visited the shooting of a film in Parador. And Mazursky
himself appears, cross-dressing as the late dictator's mother.
   And finally, when Drefuss leaves Parador to return to the New
York City acting scene he left, he bids farewell to Braga in what he
exclaims to be a moment right out of ``Casablanca.''
   But for all the attention to acting, many of the lines leave much
to be desired and simply fall flat. When the dictator passes out
drunk, Julia looks at him and says, ``He can't drink anymore. His
liver is totally damaged.''
   Still, there is much in the movie that is witty and fun.

   ``A Summer to Remember'' (MCA Home Video. VHS-Beta, $39.95. Rated
PG)
   
   ``A Summer to Remember'' does have Tess Harper, a cute orangutan
and a couple of kids who triumph over adults. But it is so syrupy
that it's hard to swallow.
   The film, directed by Robert Lewis, is about a deaf boy (Sean
Gerlis) who feels isolated and extremely angry after his dad leaves
him and his mother (Harper) and sister. His stepfather (James
Farentino) tries desperately to reach him and break him from his
shell.
   But what it takes to bring him out is an unlikely relationship he
and his sister develop with an escaped ape who has been trained to
speak in sign language. It's a clever idea, and the acting is fine.
Also in the cast are Louise Fletcher, Burt Young and Bridgette
Andersen.
   The movie deals well with the difficulties that can develop
between a stepfather and stepson, and with the way the world can
seem to a deaf boy.
   But it hits the audience over the head with its good intentions.
Especially heavy-handed are the music and and a slow-motion scene in
which the kids tumble in a field with their orangutan pal.

   ``Born to Burn'' (MCA) _ Ethel and the Shameless Hussies
   
   Ethel and the Shameless Hussies, working at some lonesome
intersection where the Andrews Sisters meet Bob Wills, are really a
lot more talented than the dopey names and outrageous outfits would
have you believe. In fact, that's the problem here _ the joke
quickly wears thin, pulling down what could be a real up-and-coming
country band with a difference.
   ``Ethel'' and her polyester pals, ``Bunni'' and ``Blanche,'' we
are led to believe, are three good ol' gals who were all married to
the same lout. They sing clever things _ ``I Thought He Was Mr.
Right, But He Left'' _ and wear a lot of animal prints and
semi-naughty corsets.
   But amid the schlock, there is some quality. Their singing is
right on the mark, and their sound leans to Texas swing, the rebirth
of which is the happiest country music trend in a long time. In real
life, Ethel even comes with credentials: She's actually the
songwriter Kacey Jones, who co-wrote the Mickey Gilley hit ``I'm the
One Mama Warned You About,'' which is reprised on ``Born to Burn.''
   These women, though, face a big decision: Is this a country band
or a vaudeville act? The gimmick that got them their big break is
going to turn them into the Buster Poindexter of C&amp;W if thy don't
find a way out real fast.

   ``Mystery Girl'' (Virgin) Roy Orbison
   
   Roy Orbison's sudden death last December makes it hard to
objectively consider this ``comeback album.'' Is it really good, or
does sentimentality make it seem so?
   It's really good. Not perfect, but it would have been a hit even
if Orbison hadn't succumbed to a heart attack.
   Orbison imports an all-star crew to help him, including George
Harrison, Tom Petty and most of his Heartbreakers, Bono and The Edge
of U2, Jeff Lynne, Elvis Costello, Steve Cropper and a host of
studio stars. All Orbison needed to bring was that sweet,
other-worldly voice.
   ``You Got It,'' the single, is successful for the same reason as
the Traveling Wilburys _ it's light, breezy ``feel good'' pop.
   But the meat of the album are the Bono and Edge-composed ``She's
a Mystery to Me'' and Costello's ``The Comedians.'' The spare
arrangement of the former lays bare a tale of romantic torment.
   ``The Comedians'' adds a bizarre new twist to romantic loss: The
narrator is left stuck on the top of a ferris wheel while his
girlfriend walks off holding the operator's hand. The song builds to
a dramatic climax before Orbison leaves the listener, like himself,
hanging in mid-air.
   Each of the album's 10 songs go down easily, with only ``(All I
Can Do Is) Dream You'' having much of a rock 'n' roll kick.
   That eventually becomes a problem. Songs such as ``A Love So
Beautiful,'' ``Windsurfer'' and ``The Only One'' are predictable and
tend to blend together after awhile. Orbison was successful when he
tackled challenging material; he should have tried it a few more
times.
   Still, this Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame member managed to thrust
himself onto the contemporary scene without looking foolish. That
happens less often than it seems.

   Lieder by Franz Schubert; Kathleen Battle, soprano, James Levine,
Piano (Deutsche Grammaphon)
   
   Kathleen Battle and James Levine present a varied selection of
Schubert songs, spanning a broad emotional range. In the first half,
Battle sings mostly about the sunnier side of love. Her light,
supple voice is perfectly suited to Schubert's setting of Goethe's
``Liebhaber in allen Gestalten,'' with its repeated line, ``Would
that I were a fish, so nimble and agile.'' Those words nicely sum up
Battle's fine voice.
   Her instrument changes color for the interesting ``An die
Laute,'' in which a young man confides his love to a lute. Levine,
whose pianism is as welcome as his podium work, perfectly
approximates the sound of the lute in the accompaniment.
   This recording amply demonstrates that Battle does not lack for
charm, and does not hesitate to show it. The listener is won over on
the eighth track, a hauntingly beautiful lullaby called ``Nacht und
Traume.'' She sings softly throughout with a heart-aching sweetness.
The song is about the joy men take in their dreams, and ends with a
depressing conclusion _ a call for a return to sleep when day breaks.
   The program now takes a darker turn. Battle sings of aching
hearts in ``Rastlose Liebe,'' or ``restless love,'' and the
turbulent night of a young nun awaiting her Saviour like a trembling
bride in ``Die junge Nonne.'' Finally comes the wondrous ``Shepherd
on the Rock,'' which transverses the range of a lover's emotions _
yearning, grief, loneliness, longing and the joy of anticipation.
   To some tastes, this song is better for a deeper voice, and
Battle has trouble with some of the low notes. But she sings with
conviction and attention to detail. Clarinettist Karl Leister is
flawless, sounding like a cool mountain stream bubbling over
polished rocks.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was 200 years ago that French citizens overthrew
King Louis XVI, beginning a bloody revolution that was to
reverberate throughout Europe.
   Bastille Day, July 14, the day in 1789 when the French
revolutionaries stormed and destroyed the state prison in Paris is
the national holiday of France.
   A reconstruction of the Bastille and ``the world's biggest ball''
are just two of the events marking the celebration of the
bicentennial of the French Revolution taking place in France in the
coming months.
   Those thirsty for ``revolutionary'' wine will find it at the
Salon des Vins at the Porte de Versailles where, from April 28 to
May 8, visitors can sample wine made as it was during the reign of
Louis XVI.
   For visitors who don't speak French but would like to know more
about exactly what happened 200 years ago, a special historical bus
tour in English is being offered by Vision tourist agency. The tours
go both to Versailles, where the Royals lived it, and to sites in
Paris, where they died.
   Meanwhile, the Tuileries Gardens from May 5 to Nov. 11 will
become a living theater of bicentennial events.
   A special area in the gardens will come alive with musicians,
dancers and clowns, while cafes and a restaurant cater to hungry and
thirsty crowds.
   In a theater space visitors will see computer-powered plastic
automatons resembling Robespierre, Danton and other historical
figures doing their revolutionary thing, though beheadings are not
part of the show.
   And spectators may experience a time warp as they view the
computerized 3-D film of Paris as it was 200 years ago, complete
with a riot outside a bakery, the crowds demonstrating against
high-priced bread.
   The gardens will sprout several temporary structures, including
two 120-foot towers with spiral staircases to evoke flying doves,
the bicentennial symbol.
   Another theater will offer nonstop, 10-minute skits with actors
portraying aspects of the Revolution like ``Fraternity Night.'' This
is not a celebration of pledging a college frat, but a show on ``the
abolition of privileges.''
   Those in Normandy at mid-summer will be able to see Tall Ships
from all over the world sailing from Rouen to Le Havre between July
12-15.
   As a special salute to France, 51 visiting brass bands from the
United States will parade from City Hall to the Trocadero on July 8.
   Also in July will be the inauguration of a giant arch west of
central Paris, a new monument that stands in a line of landmarks
beginning at the Place de la Concorde and running through the Arc de
Triomphe. The inauguration will kick off events to celebrate the
Declaration of the Rights of Man, the French Bill of Rights adopted
during the Revolution and later the preamble to the French
Constitution.
   Festivities will peak on Bastille Day, July 14, beginning with
fireworks and including ``the world's biggest ball,'' a huge street
dance on the evening of July 13.
   At the Place de la Bastille, the new Paris Opera will open its
doors for the first time, offering a concert commemorating the
revolution.
   The original Bastille prison was burned down two centuries ago,
but visitors can see copies of it reconstructed at La Villette, a
giant park in northeast Paris from July 9-15.
   At the end of the show, visitors will be allowed to tear down the
towers and take home souvenir bricks inscribed, ``Liberte, Egalite,
Fraternite.''
   Meanwhile, toy-makers are offering giant inflatable plastic
replicas of the Bastille _ suitable for the backyard.
   In a more serious vein, President Francois Mitterrand will host a
summit meeting of the seven richest nations schedueled to take place
at the height of the summer celebrations.
   On July 14, U.S. President George Bush, British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and other heads of state are expected to view the
parade and flyover from the presidential box on the Champs-Elysees.
   As a gala wind-up on July 15, a special sound-and-light display
created for Paris by Jean-Paul Goud will illuminate the City of
Lights.
   The Eiffel Tower, celebrating its own centennial, will present a
special illuminated show on July 17. And Mayor Jacques Chirac has
announced that on Aug. 26 tightrope walker Philippe Petit will
negotiate the Seine on a 400-foot highwire between the Eiffel Tower
and the Palais de Chaillot.
   Petit will carry a copy of the Declaration of the Rights of Man
to present to Chirac.

   Just about every museum in France is putting on an
exhibition to mark the bicentennial of the French Revolution. Among
them:
   ``Magicians of the Earth'' is the theme covering contemporary art
works from both industrialized and developing countries at the
Pompidou Center and the Grande Halle of La Villette. The show runs
May through August.
   Fashion-lovers can view clothes from aristocratic closets of the
revolutionary period in the Musee de la Mode et du Costume, Palais
Galliera, until May 7.
   Emphasis is on ``The Stuff of Heroes'' at the Musee des Arts et
de la Mode in the Decorative Arts wing of the Louvre. The May to
August exhibition will spotlight revolutionary-period clothes with
an emphasis on textiles, accessories and jewelry.
   The most striking art from the revolutionary period will be the
paintings and drawings by Louis David displayed at the Louvre, Oct.
26 to Feb. 12, 1990.
   The works by this ``realist'' artist and chronicler of the times
include a sketch of a hook-nosed and grim Marie-Antoinette on her
way to the guillotine.

<TEXT>
   The land that was to become the state of
Oklahoma was a patchwork of Indian nations and unassigned territory
surrounded by a maturing frontier 100 years ago.
   But that all changed with the roar of a cannon on April 22, 1889,
signaling the start of the first of the great land runs that would
open millions of acres to white settlement.
   As many as 40,000 people participated in the Run of '89, each
hoping to stake a claim to 160 acres of land or a lot in a
designated townsite. The 2-million-acre rectangle later would form
parts of six central Oklahoma counties.
   Re-enactments of the run and related observances are scheduled as
part of a statewide centennial this spring. State officials say the
focus on the state's frontier heritage should draw an additional 1
million visitors during 1989.
   Fort Reno west of El Reno will be the site of one of the largest
re-enactments. The ``Fort Reno and Indian Territory Days''
observance will draw up to 500 re-enactors in military, civilian and
Indian dress to an encampment April 15 and 16, organizers say.
   After the Fort Reno event, a cavalry unit will spend three days
riding 54 miles to Guthrie, just as soldiers did in 1889 when they
policed crowds gathering for the land run. The largest re-enactments
of the run are scheduled as spectator participation events in
Guthrie April 22.
   According to state tourism officials, other centennial
re-enactments will be in Oklahoma City April 8-9; Lawton May 20-21;
Pawnee and Fort Gibson May 27; Yukon June 8-11; Norman July 21-23;
Ponca City Sept. 16, Fountainhead State Park Sept. 30; Salina Oct.
7; Lawton Oct. 29-30 and in Oologah Nov. 11.
   Whit Edwards, coordinator of the living history program for the
Oklahoma Tourism and Recreation Department, said he hopes
participants gain a better understanding of what life was like in
1889 through the re-enactments.
   ``They can actually feel and touch a little bit of history,
whether it's in the foods or the clothing,'' Edwards said. ``It's a
lot more human feeling than reading it out of a book.''
   Indian tribes routed from their homelands in other parts of the
country had been moved to Oklahoma for decades before the land run.
Oklahoma comes from a Choctaw phrase meaning ``Home of the Red
People.''
   But when many Indians sided with the Confederacy during the Civil
War, it gave the federal government the rationale it needed to begin
taking land away from the tribes, says Stan Hoig, a retired Central
State University professor who has written 10 books about Oklahoma
history.
   A decade before the Run of '89, railroad interests and so-called
``Boomer'' groups began lobbying Congress for the land to be opened
for settlement.
   President Benjamin Harrison used the ``Land Run'' approach
apparently because he was familiar with smaller runs used in
Illinois and Indiana, Hoig says.
   Homesteaders made the run on foot, on horseback, by wagon and
even bicycle. Although it was used four more times to settle
Oklahoma land, Hoig says it was a poor system.
   ``I would say there was very little fair about it,'' Hoig says.
``It was an exercise in American enterprise. Everybody had his own
way of beating the game.''
   Often, settlers would sneak into the area to be claimed hours or
days in advance to scout out desirable land. When the run started,
these ``Sooners'' would emerge from the brush to stake their claims
before legitimate racers.
   ``Sooners'' became the nickname for Oklahomans.
   Oklahoma's territory days ended in 1907, when it became the 46th
state.

   A taste of the Old West awaits the tour group that will travel
through what was once Oklahoma Indian territory, meeting tribal
elders and sharing their lives for a few days.
   Led by anthropologist Robert Vetter, a select group of about 12
people will learn about Indian values and spirituality, visit Indian
sacred sites, and view and participate in tribal pow-wows. The group
will explore Oklahoma and take part in the ``sweat lodge,'' an
ancient ritual of purification.
   They also will learn how to set up, take down and travel with
teepees.
   The tour, ``Journey in Indian Territory,'' runs May 3 through May
10. Robert Fields, a Pawnee Indian and adjunct instructor of
anthropology at the University of Oklahoma, will accompany the tour.
   Vetter has studied and written about Oklahoma Indian culture,
working with Oliver Pahdopony, the last medicine man of the Comanche
Indians.
   Vetter says that Indian people practice ``fictive kinship,''
meaning they extend kinship ties to people who are not blood
relatives. He says he feels related this way to some of the Indians
he has met and worked with.
   Yet he says he does not try to romanticize Indian life. ``They
are a people of the 1990s, as well as a people of the 1860s, with
the same inherent faults and virtues as the rest of us.''
   Cost is $695 per person, covering orientation, registration,
lodging, instructions, lectures, activities, some meals and ground
transportation.

   The pot of gold may remain elusive. But here, the
rainbow is back in the sky.
   The Rainbow Room of beloved memories _ the first really big date,
the celebration of certain wedding anniversaries and birthdays, the
one go-for-broke dinner on that vacation in New York _ is operating
again, recalling bygone days.
   As the song says, they've ``put it back the way it was'' _ when
it opened in 1934 as the epitome of elegance on the 65th floor of
the art deco RCA Building at 30 Rockefeller Center.
   The Rainbow Room has never been updated but, Joseph Baum, whose
company now leases the two floors of the Rainbow complex, says that
changes had crept in. ``All of us make little changes. Suddenly they
become big changes.''
   The Rainbow Room, which has spectacular views of the Manhattan
skyline and a revolving dance floor, reopened in December 1987 after
a two-year, $20 million renovation.``It was completely rebuilt down
to the steel, every square inch refurbished, put back to be in
perfect condition,'' says Baum.
   Renovation became complete this year with the opening of a cozy
cabaret named Rainbow and Stars.
   Baum, who likes to talk about an ambiance of ``dine, dance and
romance,'' says that the Rainbow Room now has alternating dance
bands and its circular, wooden dance floor revolves again. ``It
hadn't been used for years,'' he says.
   What isn't in the Rainbow Room that was at its opening 55 years
ago is the ``color organ.'' It shot lights in the colors of the
rainbow onto the ceiling's white dome and crystal chandelier,
depending on what notes were played, and gave the Rainbow Room its
name.
   The rainbow theme _ updated _ is carried out in Rainbow and
Stars. The long interior wall is dotted with tiny lights _ the
stars. Periodically, the stars disappear and the wall becomes curved
rows of rainbow colors. ``I think what we have is what Rainbow
stands for,'' says Baum, ``history, memory and the energy of today.''
   Baum says, ``The whole idea of Rainbow is again to be showing the
world what it means to be a New Yorker and those who want to be New
Yorkers for a short time _ how to enjoy seduction and celebration.''
Waving at the view, he adds, ``This is your town expressing all its
possibilities. People dress up. We have 30 to 40 percent every night
in black tie.''
   Rainbow and Stars is on the north side of the RCA Building's 65th
floor, and a bar, Rainbow Promenade, is on the south.
   On the west, where the Ellington Band formerly swung two
engagements a year in the Rainbow Grill, the room is renamed Rainbow
Pavilion and is rented for private parties. The entire floor is a
private luncheon club on weekdays. The Rainbow Room is open to the
public for brunch on Sundays.
   Baum says the average food check in the Rainbow Room is around
$50 for food per person; drinks, tax, tips and a $15 music charge
take it higher.
   Dinner prices in Rainbow &amp; Stars are comparable, with an
entertainment charge usually at $35 per person.

   When it comes to deciding what to do for a vacation this year,
many travel consultants are of the opinion that some 3 million
Americans can't be wrong.
   That's the number of U.S. travelers expected to take cruises in
1989.
   The choice of itinerary ranges from a 25-cent ride on the
Manhattan-Staten Island ferry (round trip) to a round-the-world trip
in a penthouse split-level suite aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2 at
$360,000 each, double occupancy.
   For travelers lured by faraway places with strange-sounding names
there's a cornucopia of adventurous cruises offered vacationers this
season.
   For example:
   _ An Amazon River expedition that includes fishing for piranhas
that later become a luncheon treat.
   _ A visit to the Galapagos Islands, described by Charles Darwin
as ``a living laboratory of evolution,'' where he formulated his
``Origin of Species'' in 1835.
   _ Siberian River cruises led by Sir Fitzroy Maclean, a noted
Soviet expert from Great Britain.
   _ A trip aboard what is billed as the first and only luxury ship
to cruise China's Yangtse River.
   _ In-depth luxury cruises in the Baltic Sea and Gulf of Bothnia.
   Despite the millions of cruising Americans each year, travel
experts say less than 10 percent of U.S. vacationers have discovered
cruising.
   But because of an expected increase in popularity, more ships are
being constructed, according to Douglas Ward, executive director of
the International Cruise Passengers Association.
   The result is an overcapacity of berths in certain cruising
areas, keeping prices modest and competitive for passengers, says
Ward, author of the Berlitz ``Complete Handbook to Cruising.''
   Since 85 percent of those who take cruises are eager to go again,
he adds, the overcapacity is expected to decline as the margin grows.
   Robert Thornton, professor of marketing at Miami University of
Ohio, agrees with Ward that overcapacity means the cruise industry
may not be in for smooth sailing.
   While cruises are in the midst of an unprecedented boom in
popularity, Thornton foresees a change in marketing strategy if that
growth _ which averaged 10.5 percent annually from 1980-87 _ is to
continue.
   Plans by the cruise industry to expand by 30,000 berths in the
next five years, he says, could result in a classic overcapacity
squeeze in profits.
   Because the market is already so heavily discounted, the Miami
University professor recommends that consumers find a travel agent
who specializes in cruises.
   Bargains exist and more may be in the offing for those who can
wait for a last-minute trip, he says, for no cruise line will leave
with an empty cabin if possible.
   Thornton says industries approaching overcapacity typically
attempt to segment the market, and he believes that tactic will be
used more and more by the cruise industry as capacity exceeds demand.
   ``That means you'll have `dinks' (double income, no kids) on
cruise A, singles on cruise B and retirees on cruise C,'' he says.
   Ward puts it another way. He notes a trend toward ``specialty''
cruising, using smaller ships equipped to cater to young, active
passengers, pursuing their hobbies or special interests.
   In advising vacationers how to make a selection, Ward says there
is a trend by some cruise lines to offer ``more ports'' in a week
than their competitors, according to Ward.
   But such intensive ``island hopping'' gives little time to
explore a destination to the full before you have to nip back on
board for a quick ride to the next port, he says, adding:
   ``While you see a lot in a week, by the end of the cruise you may
need another week to unwind, and you'll be hard put to remember what
you saw on which day.
   ``Ultimately, this is not the best way to cruise, except for
those who want to see as much as possible in a short space of time.''
   Ward, who has been on more than 600 cruises himself, agrees with
the old maxim that ``the best way to unwind quickly is to travel
slowly.''

<DATELINE>KILRONAN, Aran Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ireland's Aran Islands have so many
stone walls that only seeing is believing.
   The three inhabited islands _ Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer _
add up to about 18 square miles, but there must be hundreds of miles
of stone walls. They are usually dry walls of mostly sharp stones
enclosing tiny pastures and gardens.
   The walls are the key to the makeup of the Aran Islands, lying
across the mouth of the Bay of Galway on Ireland's west coast. They
are islands of limestone, solidified sediment of a tropical sea that
covered the area more than 270 million years ago.
   Documentary filmmaker Robert Flaherty, in ``Man of Aran'' (filmed
on Inishmaan in the 1930s), showed viewers what seemed the epitome
of isolation and struggle against the odds of nature.
   The islands also inspired playwright John Millington Synge,
author of ``Riders to the Sea'' and ``The Playboy of the Western
World,'' when he visited in the 19th century. He made the trip from
Galway by curragh, the native open Irish canoe made of timber lathes
and canvas and rowed by two or more people.
   Although the islands are only about six miles from Doolin, in
County Clare, and some 30 miles from Galway, they must have seemed
remote indeed.
   But today, Kilronan, the main village on the biggest island,
Inishmore, can seem quite crowded by people looking for the remote.
   Boats bring day trippers from Rossaveal, north of Galway, and
Doolin. Both boat trips are far shorter than the three hours it
takes the boat from Galway.
   The bed-and-breakfasts in the Aran Islands have television, hot
water, electricity and radiators in the bedrooms.
   But the Aran Islands are still a world of their own _ and still
remote in their way _ for visitors who spend days rather than hours
on them, walking and looking around and listening to the Gaelic
language.
   A horse cart, van or bike will take a visitor to the foot of the
hill where stands Dun Aengus, one of the best preserved prehistoric
fort-like structures in Europe. The climb to the top has to be done
on foot, across a wet, rock-strewn meadow with dainty little flowers
and over rocks worn so smooth by nature and so criss-crossed by
little crevices that they resemble giant tiles. They are slippery in
wet weather _ and chances are it will be misting if not raining
there or anywhere else on the Aran Islands.
   In addition to the stone walls, stone ruins and stone houses,
stone crosses dot the landscape, in memory of islanders killed at
sea.
   Fishing is still a major occupation of the islanders and the sea
still rules their lives. The man running the tourist office may
suddenly shoo away the tourists, close down, and dash to the beach
where others, clad in orange rescue suits, are already launching a
motorized rescue raft for a boat in trouble under the cliffs of
Moher, across the water in County Clare.
   As dusk falls on Inishmeer, on a broad sand beach, small boys
play with their dogs. The friendly donkeys no longer used for
tilling the soil come up to nuzzle a passerby. There are piles of
curraghs on the beach, for Inishmeer is the only place in the
islands where they're still made.
   Beyond the beach, on a sweep of dune, are an old burying ground
and various ruins dating back to medieval times or even earlier. Up
a steep hill, one comes upon a cashel wall (ancient circular wall
that used to enclose ecclesiastical buidings) and within it a ``more
modern'' tower house built, perhaps, in the late 14th century.
   Alone in the misty twilight, visitors can still feel the
remoteness of time and place.

   Americans made 1.2 billion person trips in 1987,
according to the U.S. Travel Data Center.
   A person trip is travel by one person a distance of 100 miles or
more from home.
   Whether they traveled for business or pleasure, many depended on
a travel agent for help.
   Who are these travel agents?
   Sharon Walker, in her 20s, works for the Ohio Motorists
Association travel agency in Oberlin, Ohio. It's one of 27
association branches throughout the state.
   Miss Walker headed for the travel business straight out of high
school, lured by her love of travel, an interest in geography and
the prospect of free or cut-rate trips. A school in Florida that
offered a six-week crash course plus six months of home study sent
her on her way.
   Kaye Jones, a vice president of Barnett Travel Tours and Cruises
in Greensboro, N.C., has been in the business more than 25 years.
She went into the travel field after trying and discarding nursing
and banking.
   Jean Chipman, co-owner of the Encore Preston II travel agency in
Dallas, was divorced and in her 30s when she went to work about 25
years ago for a friend who owned a travel agency.
   It was a traditional business for women without specialized
training to enter when they wanted something to do after the
children were grown, much like real estate, Mrs. Chipman explained
in a telephone interview.
   But computerization has changed all that, she said, and most
travel agencies don't have much time for in-house training these
days. To get a job, one needs computer know-how. She also notes that
more and more men are entering the field, especially at management
level.
   Both Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Chipman are certified travel counselors
(CTC), meaning they have taken courses offered by the Institute of
Certified Travel Agents (ICTA), a non-profit organization
headquartered in Wellesley, Mass., devoted to educating travel
industry personnel. To earn the initials, an agent must have
completed a five-part travel management program, served at least
five years in the travel industry and signed a code of ethics.
   The ICTA also has started a new program of training in
geographical areas that will allow agents who complete the course to
use the desination DS, or destination specialist.
   A Louis Harris survey for the American Society of Travel Agents
(ASTA), showed that the gross dollar volume of all bookings handled
by U.S. travel firms in 1987 was $64.2 billion.
   And yet, it seems, there is relatively little formal regulation
in the field.
   A spokesman for ASTA's state legislative affairs department says
only seven states regulate agents and agencies, with the regulations
varying state-to-state. The seven are California, Hawaii, Ohio,
Rhode Island, Washington, Illinois and Florida.
   Various organizations within the industry itself, including ASTA,
have codes of ethics for members. ASTA's covers such things as
accuracy of any information an agent gives out, full information to
travelers about terms and conditions of any sale, and prompt
remittance of any undisputed funds.
   The Airlines Reporting Corp. is owned by major U.S. airlines and
serves as a clearing house for receipts that agents get from airline
tickets they sell. It also sets standards for the agents with which
it has agreements _ more than 33,600 of them. If an agency does not
live up to its agreement, ARC can pull the ``plates'' through which
it makes out airline tickets.
   The ICTA quotes estimates that there are about 200,000 travel
agents across the country waiting to help travelers. Usually, their
services are free. And they say that especially in this day of
airline deregulation, agents can save the traveler time and money
with their computers, contacts and background.
   But how many travelers actually follow the advice to ``see your
travel agent''?
   Relatively few, according to the Travel Data Center. It estimates
that 13 percent of U.S. travelers consulted an agent in 1987 and of
those, only 10 percent used them to book hotel or airline
reservations.
   ASTA, however, estimates that almost 90 percent of cruises are
booked through travel agencies, and 80 percent of airline travel.
But it estimates bookings of hotels through agents only in the
mid-20 percent range, with most of that for hotels outside the
United States.

   How can those who want to use a travel agent find
a good one?
   The Institute of Certified Travel Agents, a non-profit
organization headquartered in Wellesley, Mass., and devoted to
educating travel industry personnel, offers some advice:.
   ``First, ask a friend who's had a good experience with an agent.''
   It also suggests that one look for the CTC (certified travel
counselor) or DS (destination specialist) designations, given by
ICTA to those who have completed its courses.
   Also, ICTA says, membership of an agency in such trade
associations as ASTA (American Society of Travel Agents) and ARTA
(Association of Retail Travel Agents) is an indicator of a
serious-minded agent.
   Note, too, how long the agency has been in the field, and how
long its staff has been in the business. Beware of rapid turnover.
   And note whether the office is neat, well-stocked with brochures
and well organized, and whether the staff is helpful and friendly.

   Fodor's, Penguin, ``Let's Go'' and many more _
guidebooks galore from many publishers are showing up in their
latest versions. There's a guidebook for every taste in travel.
   ``Let's Go,'' a series covering Europe, U.S.A., Britain and
Ireland and the rest and written by the Harvard Student Agencies
(St. Martin's), won't list the Hiltons and Marriotts everywhere, but
you'll find the hostels and bed-and-breakfasts. And where else can
you learn where the hitchhiking is good?
   Penguin's ``Caribbean,'' ``Ireland,'' ``Australia'' and ``New
York City,'' among others, often written by local journalists and
writers, give a feeling of intimacy with a place, as if hearing from
a friend. These books are aimed at experienced travelers ``in search
of exceptional information to help them sharpen and deepen their
enjoyment of the trips they take.''
   Readers learn of a pub in County Cork, Ireland, dating back to
1837, where young poets recite their latest works, and that Clare
Island, off Ireland's northwest coast, ``is the kind of sanctuary
that attracts individuals; it is remote and yet has every comfort.''
   Fodor's, long familiar to travelers, has started to rewrite,
reformat and redesign all its more than 100 travel guides.
   Did you know, for instance, about the one-room public library at
De Funiak Springs, in northern Florida, the state's oldest
continuously operating public library, dating from 1887? The new
Fodor's ``Florida,'' in one of numerous paragraphs headed ``Off the
Beaten Track,'' notes that this library contains in addition to
14,000 volumes ``an impressive collection of European armor, some
dating back to the Crusades.'' Part of the fun of a visit, Fodor's
says, is tracing the history of the collection and learning how it
got there.
   Bantam Books started a series of travel guides this spring, in
both trade size and pocket size. The four larger guides marking the
imprint's start cover Australia, Great Britain, Italy and London;
the pocket guides are to the cities of London, Washington, D.C., and
Rome.
   Bantam says its intent with the new guides is to get away from
the ``laundry list style'' and ``focus only on the unique.''
   Berlitz has added Prague to its series of handy, pocket-sized
travel guides. It contains a number of color photos and maps along
with useful travel information on the Czechoslovakian capital.
   There is a buoyant, unconventional guide to the Caribbean, ``Rum
and Reggae, What's Hot and What's Not in the Caribbean,'' by
Jonathan Runge (St. Martin's). It focuses on what the visitor wants
to do _ from golf to enjoying a little privacy for nude bathing _
and says where to find it.
   Just in time to help the traveler already browsing through ``The
Best of Brazil'' (Crown) or planning a trip elsewhere in Latin
America comes ``The Travelers' Guide to Latin American Customs &amp;
Manners,'' by Elizabeth Devine and Nancy L. Braganti (St. Martin's).
Don't give white flowers if you're invited to someone's home in
Guatemala, they warn; they're associated with funerals. And in
Venezuela, it's considered unlucky to give someone handkerchiefs.
   Some other new guidebooks:
   ``On the Road USA''( Reader's Digest), for automobile travelers.
This guide is formatted with entries arranged along major highway
routes. Each entry has information about routes, sites, opening
times, admission costs, and facilities available.
   ``The Self-Guided Travel Series'' (Langenscheidt) is for
experienced independent travelers. The first of the series covers
England, Mexico, Italy, France and Canada. Each book includes
suggested driving and walking tours, concise background about
history, architecture, and lesser known sites, and practical
information about each location.
   ``The Real Guides'' (Prentice Hall) is aimed at younger,
udget-conscious travelers. These are Americanized versions of the
British ``Rough Guides Series'' which include political and cultural
information about each country. The first eight books cover
Amsterdam, France, Greece, Mexico, New York, Paris, Portugal and
Spain.
   ``Eyes of Texas Travel Guides'' (Gulf) are detailed, localized
guides for selected areas of the state.
   ``The Teenager's Guide to Study, Travel and Adventure Abroad''
(St. Martin's), compiled by the Council on International Educational
Exchange, is a combination of advice and hard listings on
educational opportunities all over the world. Details about
eligibility, application deadlines, cost, living arrangements, and
supervision are covered for each of about 150 entries.

   Often fascinating are new and reprinted accounts of people's
travels.
   Bruce Chatwin, in ``Songlines,'' seeks out the traditional
ancestral paths of aborigines in the Australian Outback, and Mary
Morris travels alone and offbeat in Mexico in ``Nothing to Declare''
(both Viking-Penguin).
   Freya Stark visits Turkish spots that Alexander the Great visited
in the years before the Christian era and thinks of his experiences
as she jolts and rides along ``Alexander's Path'' (Overlook Press).
   Geoffrey Moorhouse sets out with some trepidation to cross the
Sahara by himself by camel, as recounted in ``The Fearful Void''
(Griffin).
   Eric Newby's apparently insatiable interest in other people's
travels has led to a fat collection, ``A Book of Travellers' Tales''
(Viking-Penguin), with brief excerpts of writings by travelers
ranging from the unknown diarist who was on Portuguese navigator
Vasco de Gama's 1497-1499 voyage, in which he discovered the sea
route to India around the Cape of Good Hope, to novelist Evelyn
Waugh, looking at Mt. Etna.

   Whether it means restoring a 10th-century watermill in France,
working at a children's crisis center in Ireland, harvesting crops
in Czechoslovakia, or digging ditches in Turkey, a number of young
Americans are combining travel with volunteer service, says the
Council on International Educational Exchange (CIEE).
   ``Volunteer workcamps have been popular in Europe since the
1920s,'' says CIEE program coordinator Rick LeVert, ``but it's a
relatively unknown concept for Americans that's growing rapidly.
   The CIEE sponsors an international workcamps program in 14
countries. Typically, the summer workcamps involve 15 to 20
volunteers living in communal fashion, working and sightseeing
together.
   Most participants are 20 to 35 years old, according to CIEE, with
the minimum age 18. There are limited opportunities for 16-year-olds.
   Volunteers are responsible for transportation costs to the
workcamp and a $100 program fee. They are provided with free room
and board.
   Don Hudson spent two weeks in France last summer excavating a
chateau.
   ``You spent enough time with people to see through the
differences to underlying similarities and through the similarities
to underlying differences,'' he said.
   Erica Goldberger, 18, who worked on a forest reclamation project
in West Germany, was the only American among volunteers from the
Netherlands, West Germany, Algeria, Spain and France.
   ``I learned so much,'' she says. ``I feel much more responsible,
independent and self-confident. I learned about life in many
different cultures and made friends from all over the world.''
   Volunteers have come from foreign countries to the United States,
as well. Workcamp projects in the United States have included a sand
dune consevation project in Oregon, reconstruction of low-income
housing in New York, and an archaeological dig in Kentucky.

   ``Staying on schedule'' is the key to keeping healthy while
traveling, says two specialists at the University of Oklahoma Health
Sciences Center in Oklahoma City.
   That means eating, sleeping and bathroom habits, according to Dr.
Robert A. Rankin and Dr. O.H. Rundell.
   The two have these suggestions for reducing health problems while
traveling:
   _ Stay on your regular schedule when eating. If you get
constipated, don't wait days to do something about it. Snacking on
fruits and vegetables will help.
   _ Restrict your intake of rich foods, to prevent heartburn.
   _ If your travel keeps you away three or more days, catch up on
your sleep before leaving.
   _ When crossing several time zones, use short-acting sleeping
pills to help you sleep.
   _ Don't drink to induce sleep on airplane flights. Instead, read
a book or listen to music or relaxation tapes.
   Rankin is associate professor of medicine, Digestive Diseases and
Nutrition Section at Oklahoma Memorial Hospital; Rundell is adjunct
assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the OU
Health Sciences Center and director of a sleep disorders center.
   For diabetics, Dr. Ira J. Laufer, director of the Diabetes
Treatment Unit at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, has some
specific suggestions:
   _ Self-monitor your blood glucose, either by a test strip or
electronically with a meter.
   _ Pack enough medication for several days in a carry-on bag.
   _ Keep a copy of any prescription with you at all times.
   _ For international travel, find out if waivers are needed to
carry medication or syringes through Customs.
   _ See if your doctor can recommend a physician in your travel
area. Travel agents can help with information on international
medical and assistance services.
   _ Wear an emergency medical ID bracelet or necklace.

   You have a broken leg, and you have a long flight ahead of you.
You should have your cast split to prevent buildup of painful air
pressure.
   You're a dieter, on the road. Only calorie-laden menus are
presented to you. Be assertive; ask for what you need to maintain
your diet.
   You want to avoid jet lag. You can't, but you can learn to handle
it.
   This advice and other ways to travel in good health are covered
in a new book, ``Travel Well, A Gourmet Guide to Healthy Travel''
(Brontosaurus Press), written by a Dallas physician, Norman Kaplan,
and his wife, Audrey.
   Travel, the Kaplans point out, can be hazardous to your health.
Business travel can be stressful. You get less sleep and rest. You
eat and drink too much. You don't exercise enough.
   ``It is hard enough for people to control their weight, blood
pressure, cholesterol level, exercise conditioning, and
psychological equilibrium in the relatively stable home situation.
On the road, it can be almost impossible,'' the Kaplans write.
   Their book includes advice about how to deal with these problems
aloft and on the ground. To help travelers continue exercise and
diet regimens, they list hotels with workout, jogging and swimming
facilities and restaurants they say will prepare diet fare for you.
   The Kaplans say there is no proven way to fend off jet lag, but
that it will help to try sleeping earlier on eastward flights and
staying awake later on westward flights.
   To avoid stress, they advise planning, traveling light with
carry-on luggage, and using special services such as business
centers at airports.

   Business travel has become a big ticket item for many
corporations, and many of them are learning to manage their own or
to cut deals to cut rising travel costs.
   U.S. corporations are expected to spend over $115 billion on
travel and entertainment in 1990, up from an estimated $95 billion
last year, according to an American Express survey. A similar survey
by Runzheimer International puts the median per-company travel
expenditure for 1987 at $2,348,000, a rise of about $120,000 over
the previous two years. Travel and entertainment costs are the third
largest controllable expense for most companies, after salaries and
data processing, American Express says.
   One way companies are dealing with travel expenses is to do it
themselves, by adding in-house travel specialists to their staffs.
About 29 percent of the 1,600 companies surveyed by American Express
say they added travel managers in l988, an increase of 16 percent in
two years.
   Many companies have computerized reservation equipment on their
premises. Coupled with frequent reviews and closer enforcement of
travel policies, their travel costs continue to rise, but at a rate
less than overall average travel costs, according to Runzheimer, a
travel and living cost consulting company.
   ``Employers are finally realizing how much they're spending on
travel, and they're zeroing in on ways to control this major
expense,'' says Bradford Burris, Runzheimer publisher.
   Still, nine out of 10 companies use travel agencies, the American
Express survey shows. Heavy spending companies are able to get lower
fares and better services by consolidating the number of agencies
they use. About half use a single agency. But even when they use
outside agencies, more companies have become more directly involved
in travel and entertainment expense management.

   Surviving at the foot of the glass and steel
towers of Wall Street, the 200-year-old South Street Seaport has
become one of New York City's most popular new tourist attractions.
   The restored seaport, with its tall sailing ships, historic
buildings and a full schedule of entertainments, attracts an
estimated 12 million visitors each year.
   New York's financial empire began in South Street's 18th century
warehouses and counting houses, handling the wealth growing out of a
burgeoning ship trade. With the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825,
produce and goods from the Midwest fueled the boom, and South Street
became known as the ``Street of Ships.'' China clippers,
trans-Atlantic packets, Caribbean schooners, grain barges, fishing
smacks and steamboats crowded the wharves along the lower East River
tip of Manhattan. The heyday lasted until about 1860, when New York
outgrew the port and trade shifted to the Hudson River.
   Today's Seaport thrives on tourism, its old buildings and sailing
ships helping visitors relive the past. They can take harbor
excursions aboard vintage ships like the century-old schooner
Pioneer, or tour permanently moored ships such as the four-masted
bark Peking, the full-rigged three-masted Wavertree, the lightship
Ambrose or the fishing schooner Lettie G. Howard, each about 100
years old.
   The Seaport also is home of the venerable Fulton Fish Market and
Sloppy Louie's, a small shopfront restaurant dating from the 1930s.
These have been joined by hundreds of other modern stores,
restaurants and boutiques since the Seaport restoration began in the
1970s.
   Bowne &amp; Co. stationers on Water Street is typical of the old
buildings in the 11-block restoration. A museum replica of an 1870s
print and stationery shop, it has old hand-operated letterpresses
producing cards, stationery and pamphlets for sale at the front of
the store. The South Street Museum offices are in two Front Street
buildings thought to be the oldest on the block, dating from at
least 1797. They were once used by grocery firms, and one of the
buildings still has a wooden wheel in its attic, part of an old
hand-hoisting system.
   Live indoor and outdoor concerts are regular Seaport events, and
fireworks shows are added for holiday weekends. Memorial Day events
are scheduled May 27-29; Independence Day, July 1-4; Labor Day,
Sept. 2-4.
   Special events include the Stars and Stripes Regatta in July, the
Mayor's Cup Schooner Race in September, and the Maritime Festival in
October.

   Hawaii always has had the image of a ``Fantasy Island''
vacationland.
   Now, it's trying to fulfill those fantasies, from a wild game
safari to Grand Prix-type auto racing. Or, a more romantic, private
champagne picnic on a remote cliff overlooking the waterfalls.
   The new Hyatt Regency Waikoloa hotel, which opened last fall at
the Waikoloa Beach Resort on the main island, offers 10 different
``fantasies'' for its guests.
   Some may consider the cost fantastic, as well. The Lauhala Point
Picnic is an extra $700 per couple; the Hulihee Palace Dinner
Fantasy, a private, five-course dinner served along with native
entertainment, is $300 (including limo to and from the palace).
Hotel accommodations run from $195 to $375 a night.
   ``The romantic fantasies are popular,'' says Patrick Cowell,
Hyatt Resorts Hawaii regional vice president, ``because they allow
busy couples a total escape from the real world and the
responsibilities of work and family life.''
   The $360 million hotel seems something of a fantasy itself. It
has a fleet of paddle boats plying a four-acre lagoon with tame
dolphins and a 77-step, pink flagstone grand staircase descending
into the lagoon. Canopied canal boats ferry guests to their rooms.
   Another top-rated hotel on the island is the Mauna Kea Beach, on
the Kohala Coast. It was chosen ``America's No. 1 Favorite Hawaii
Resort'' in a poll of subscribers to ``Andrew Harper's Hideaway
Report,'' a travel newsletter for well-traveled (and well-heeled)
business executives.
   The new Hallekulani hotel on Waikiki was featured in a recent
issue of Travel and Leisure magazine, which considered the capital
city of Honolulu ``still the best urban beach resort in America.''
   Waikiki beach, the magazine said, ``might be the most famous _
and most expensive _ beach in the world.''

<TEXT>
   Here, in one place, you can contemplate
18th-century agricultural life, 19th-century industry, and
20th-century music.
   Waterloo Village is a restored rural village with buildings
spanning two centuries, offering the visitor a visible historic time
chart.
   Houses and outbuildings in rusticated stones from the 1740s show
how the homesteaders who settled here along the banks of the
Musconetcong River milled grain by water power and worked their
trades as weavers, tavern keepers, blacksmiths, apothecaries and the
like.
   Iron was found in the region, and by the time of the
Revolutionary War, Andover Forge in the village was producing gun
barrels for the Continental Army. In 1815, Brig Gen. John Smith, an
early landowner, renamed the community to celebrate Wellington's
victory over Napoleon at Waterloo that year.
   The opening of the 102-mile Morris Canal in the 1830s marked the
next era, with Waterloo serving as an inland port for barges
transporting coal, iron and grain from Pennsylvania to the Hudson
River. The barges have gone now, but the towpaths remain for walking
through forests, along lakes and rivers. Tall Victorian mansion
houses also remain as a legacy of Waterloo's mid-19th century
prosperity.
   Waterloo declined with the coming of the railroads after the
1840s and nearly disappeared after the market crash in 1929. But the
abandoned village was discovered by Percival Leach and Louis
Gualandi in the 1940s, and they began its restoration. The two men,
partners in a design firm, solicited money for restoration and
antiques for the 11,000-acre property, turning it into a historical
museum now owned jointly by the state and the non-profit Waterloo
Foundation.
   Music festivals are the 20th-century contribution to Waterloo.
Its summer concert series began 20 years ago, and since then both
classic and popular artists have entertained more than 250,000
visitors each year.

   Hilton Head Island _ that's South Carolina _ promotes itself with
the simple motto: ``Life is simply better here.''
   No relation to the Hilton hotels, the island is 35 miles from
Savannah, Ga., 95 miles from Charleston, S.C., and for better
educated, beach-loving pleasure-seekers with money, it may indeed be
a simply better place to visit.
   The South Carolina barrier island resort had an estimated 1.2
million visitors in 1988, spending some $475 million. More than
380,000 travelers are expected this spring, between March and May,
according to the Chamber of Commerce.
   A survey of last year's visitors, conducted by the University of
South Carolina's Institute of Tourism Research, found that most
visitors _ 74.9 percent _ went simply for pleasure and cited ``rest
and relaxation'' as what they wanted most from their vacation.
Others went to attend meetings or explore retirement possibilities,
the study showed.
   Nearly 83 percent of those surveyed were college graduates,
earning $50,000 or more annually.
   Most spring visitors came from Ohio, New Jersey and North
Carolina, representing 30 percenting of the spring profile.
   Spring was an attractive time, speculated M. Dale Augenstein,
president of the Hilton Head Island Chamber of Commerce, because of
the island's uncrowded golf courses, tennis courts and
accommodations.
   The island is named for William Hilton, a 17th-century English
sea captain, who was commissioned by a group of Barbados planters to
find new land on which to plant sugar and indigo.
   There are eight planned communities on the island today, with a
population of more than 20,000 people. A four-lane highway bridge
connects the island to the mainland.

   Hertz and Avis may not have to worry yet, but some imaginative
hotel operators are providing some unusual transportation of their
own.
   The Westin Lenox hotel in Atlanta has a 1961 Rolls-Royce Phantom
V at the disposal of its guests, who can reserve the car for trips
throughout the area.
   The 20-foot limousine is described as ``sapphire blue with a
silver mink top.'' It was bought from a private collection in
Richmond, Va., according to a hotel spokesman, and has an interior
of ``Italian burr walnut, London cloth and Wilton carpet.''
   While it's not unusual for hotels to have their own mini-buses or
vans meet guests at the airport, The Westcourt in the Buttes, a
hilltop conference resort in Tempe, Ariz., sends a London taxi to
meet its guests coming into the Phoenix Sky Harbour Airport.
   One of the resort's three white taxis is a 1962 diesel, bought
from the Central Automobile Co. of London, says C.V. Healy, general
manager of the property. The other two came from London Coach, USA,
a Detroit dealer specializing in British cars.
   ``We wanted something distinctive and immediately recognizable
for our guests,'' says Healy.

   Being with the family is the primary reason most Americans go on
vacation, according to an American Express survey.
   The survey of 1,000 adults found that 72 percent of those asked
put family as the biggest motivation in taking a vacation,
especially among women and among those over 65. It was followed by
being with a spouse or companion, then rest and relaxation and
escape from stress. Rest and relaxation was the biggest reason among
travelers aged 18 through 49.
   Fifty-eight percent said they went on vacation for fun and
entertainment and 56 percent wanted to ``go somewhere new.''
   Men ranked romance higher than women did; 38 percent of the men
said it was an important factor, compared to 32 percent of the women.
   The survey, called ``Psychology of Vacation Travel,'' also found
that the average American vacationer takes a day-and-a-half to
``unwind,'' although nearly 10 percent said they never unwind.
   The vacation ``afterglow'' lasts six days, on the average,
according to those interviewed. But 9 percent said it lasts less
than a day.
   Others reasons cited for vacations included adventure, meeting
new people, ``escape'' (from everyone, everything or the weather),
shopping and gambling.

   The Labor Department reported wholesale prices
rose 1.0 percent in February, equalling January's surprising rise
and projecting an annual wholesale inflation rate of 12.6 percent.
   The report on inflation belted the stock and bond markets Friday,
with the Dow Jones industrial average plunging nearly 50 points on
fears of spiraling prices, crushingly high interest rates and a
possible recession.
   Economists said if the Federal Reserve boosts interest rates too
high in its effort to cool off the economy and dampen inflation, it
could accidentally cut short the record 6{-year-old economic
expansion.

   Eastern Airlines is shopping for the new pilots it
needs to survive a crippling strike now in its third week.
   ``We've waited patiently for the pilots union to come to its
senses,'' Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said as an advertisment was
run in Sunday's Miami Herald appealing for pilots to ``be part of
the new Eastern.''
   The ads will begin running Tuesday in other major newspapers
across the country, Matell said.

   A deadlocked jury deliberated a ninth day without
returning a verdict in the the first criminal corruption trial
linked to the confessions of jailed insider trader Ivan Boesky.
   U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe told the nine women and
three men in the GAF Corp. stock manipulation case late Saturday to
reconsider the evidence after the panel reported an 11-1 split. The
sole juror said he or she could shift positions ``under no
circumstances.''
   After rehearing more than two hours of testimony and deliberating
another four hours Sunday, the jury, which has been sequestered
since March 10, reached no verdict and asked to reconvene Monday.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. has rejected a
government demand to fire financier Michael Milken immediately,
further delaying settlement of fraud charges against the investment
firm, sources said.
   The refusal by Drexel Chief Executive Frederick H. Joseph marks a
possibly significant roadblock in resolving civil charges, and could
complicate resolution of criminal charges stemming from a two-year
federal investigation into one of Wall Street's biggest and most
profitable companies.
   Drexel already has agreed to government demands to axe Milken,
withhold his multimillion-dollar 1988 pay and bar him from ever
speaking with members of the firm about any business matters.

   Inflation has been heating up in Europe for the
first time in years and that, plus the higher interest rates being
used to combat it, are causing a lot of worry across the Continent.
   But few economists believe Europe will return to double-digit
inflation or that it will threaten the European economies' comeback
of the late 1980s.
   The pickup in prices, which coincides with a resurgence in U.S.
inflation, is being blamed on faster-than-expected economic growth,
which caught European governments by surprise. Central banks across
Europe, it turned out, slackened their grip too much after the
October 1987 stock market crash, economists said.
   Both consumer buying and investment spending have been strong in
Europe and as a result, factories have been working at or near
capacity.
   Economists also blame the upward trend in the dollar and the
weakness of European currencies _ particularly the West German mark
_ last year, as well as higher commodity prices, especially for oil.
   Higher prices are being exacerbated by higher wage claims,
threatening to cause wage-price spirals in some countries.
   Since the second half of 1988, European countries have tried to
stop inflation by raising interest rates to discourage that spending
and borrowing, but there is no clear indication it is working.
   Signs are that consumers are continuing to spend. In Britain, for
example, retail sales spurted 2.5 percent in February.
   This renewed inflation is a big disappointment for Europe
following the great successes the once-lumbering and mature
economies have had in turning themselves around by making their
industries more modern and efficient.
   ``There are inflationary pressures within most of the economies
in Europe. I think the inflation fear is fairly widespread,'' said
Nigel Rendell, an economist at the London investment firm James
Capel and Co.
   European inflation will peak at 5 percent this year, its highest
level since 1985, up from with 3.5 percent last year, he predicted.
It should fall back to 4 percent next year, as U.S. economic growth
slows and the dollar weakens, he said.
   Britain and Italy are expected to fare the worst, with an average
annual rate of up to 7 percent in 1989, economists say.
   The continental economies are not as overheated as those of the
United States and Britain, said Anthony Thomas, an economist with
the London investment firm Kleinwort Grieveson Ltd. As a result,
inflation is ``a much easier problem for them to contend with,'' he
said.
   Indeed, Rendell said: ``It's important to stress that although
we're going to get back to inflation, we're not going to get back to
the teen-age (double-digit) inflation we saw in the 1970s or the
double-digit inflation we saw earlier in the 1980s.''
   Many economists think interest rates will have to go even higher,
particularly after the U.S. government reported Friday that
wholesale prices surged 1 percent in February, prompting the stock
markets to plunge. The rates might go up within the month, they said.
   But David Bowers, an economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd.,
said he is not convinced higher interest rates will work in Spain,
for example, because Spanish consumers aren't heavily indebted and
because a large amount of investment is foreign and funded from the
outside.
   In addition, these high rates, besides squeezing mortgage holders
and other borrowers, are boosting currencies, and that is worsening
trade imbalances in Britain and Italy.
   However, economists are not concerned that the higher interest
rates will lead to a recession.
   ``In Europe, there is a lot of (economic) momentum,'' Rendell
said. ``We see (economic) growth at relatively high levels. It will
be less than last year, but it still will be pretty strong.''
   Rendell expects economic growth of 3 percent in Europe this year
compared with 4 percent in 1988.
   Here are annual inflation rates for 1988, and forecasts for 1989
and 1990 for the major European countries. They were provided by
James Capel and Co.

<HEAD>Lazare Kaplan Diamond Deal Sign of Hopefulness in Angola</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN LINNEE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A multimillion dollar agreement to import
Angola's diamonds announced this month by New York-based Lazare
Kaplan International could translate into more than just much-needed
hard currency to the war-ravaged southern African nation.
   Under terms negotiated with Endiama, the Angolan state diamond
company, Lazare Kaplan will import $20 million a year in
high-quality, uncut gem diamonds for processing at its plant in
Caguas, Puerto Rico, company spokeswoman Amy Wiener said in a
telephone interview from New York.
   Wiener said the first shipment has arrived for cutting and
polishing in the plant.
   The agreement is the first major international business deal
announced with the Marxist-oriented government since the signature
Dec. 22 of U.S.-brokered accords by Angola, Cuba and South Africa on
the phased withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola.
   The withdrawal is being made in return for the independence of
the South African-controlled territory of Namibia, formerly known as
South-West Africa.
   ``I was impressed by the fact that all those with whom we met in
Luanda took a business-like, non-ideological approach,'' LKI
Chairman Maurice Tempelsman said in a company news release.
   ``In view of the close diplomatic cooperation between the
American and Angolan authorities in connection with the withdrawal
of South African and Cuban forces from Angola and Namibia, there is
no reason why this agreement should not be followed by many mutually
beneficial examples of economic cooperation between our two
countries.''
   The United States has no diplomatic relations with Angola, which
gained independence from Portugal in 1975 after a 14-year colonial
war and has since been fighting U.S.-and South African-backed rebels.
   Ms. Wiener said the diamond importing agreement, the first LKI
has made with Angola, was indirectly related to the December accords.
   ``The peace process was moving forward, and continues to move
forward,'' she said. ``It can only help business, and we're
encouraged by it.''
   South Africa agreed to stop supporting Jonas Savimbi and his
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, but the United
States continues to supply about $15 million a year in military aid
through bases in neighboring Zaire.
   Before his inauguration, President Bush wrote Savimbi assuring
him of continued U.S. support in order to pressure Angolan President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos into negotiating.
   Nearly 90 percent of Angola's hard currency earnings come from
oil pumped mainly by an Angolan-American consortium in fields near
the mouth of the Zaire River.
   Under Portuguese rule, Angola was exporting between 5 percent and
8 percent of the world's diamond production. Exports fell following
independence but rose in 1981-82 to 1.3 million carats worth $165
million.
   In 1987 the Portuguese company SPE (Portuguese Entrepreneurial
Society) signed a cooperation agreement with Endiama, and 50
Portuguese technicians are working in Angola as diamond mining
advisers.
   A delegation from Endiama visited Lisbon earlier this month
following a trip to the United States, and there have been newspaper
reports here of a possible joint venture between Portugal and Angola
in mining and finishing.
   Throughout the 1980s Portugal has been an illicit export route
for unfinished Angolan diamonds. The Lisbon daily Europeu said the
illicit trade amounted to $200 million in 1983 alone.
   In 1984, Savimbi-led rebels attacked diamond mines in
northeastern Angola, and production fell off sharply.
   The area was later divided into production blocs and leased to
mining companies in the same way Angola has awarded concessions to
oil companies. The Angolan army now provides security in the
diamond-mining areas.
   Ms. Wiener said LKI does not plan to become involved in actual
diamond mining in Angola.

<DATELINE>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Companies ranging from breweries to
Playboy Enterprises to AT&amp;T now view the ``The World's Most Famous
Beach'' through green-tinted glasses.
   Instead of seeing a half-million tanned and sunburned college
students in town to party until they drop, they see dollar signs.
   Students spend big bucks on their annual excursion to the sand,
surf and bars of Daytona Beach, a fact increasingly recognized by
both big and small entrepreneurs.
   During the five-week period betwen March 4 and April 1 this year,
an estimated $100 million will be spent by spring breakers here for
everything from hotels, to food, to beer, according to Evelyn Fine,
director of the Mid-Florida Research and Business Center in Daytona
Beach.
   Since Fort Lauderdale cracked down on the merry making in that
sun capital a few years ago, Daytona Beach has become a haven for
college students nationwide.
   ``We're the biggest spring break destination in the world,'' Ms.
Fine said. ``Fort Lauderdale bitterly regrets losing the spring
break market.''
   If the college students are here, can businesses which cater to
that age group be far behind?
   Playboy magazine, which featured ``The Women of Spring Break'' in
its April issue, is one company with an active beach presence.
   ``Playboy is here because we're No. 1 in the college market. It's
a great party,'' said Cindy Rakowitz, a communications director for
Playboy Enterprises. ``The majority of our readers are in the 18- to
34-year-old range and that's the market that's here.''
   On the pool deck of Penrod's Clarendon Plaza Hotel, a long line
of young men waited for bikini-clad Lynne Austin, Miss July 1986,
and Ava Fabian, Miss August 1986, to autograph pictures.
   ``I am in love,'' screamed a somewhat inebriated young man,
holding his autographed photos.
   The two signed such things as ``My No. 1 sweetheart,'' and ``Love
and Kisses'' on the black and white publicity photographs.
   Playboy also gave the young men a plastic bag containing a
variety of cologne samples, sunscreen, and condoms _ all products
advertised in the men's magazine.
   Also in the bag was Playboy's Spring Break magazine.
   ``I read about Daytona Beach in Playboy,'' said senior Kurt
Brewer, a chemical engineering major from Wichita, Kan., who added
that in past years that he had spent spring break on Padre Island in
Texas.
   While Playboy was using sex to push its products, AT&amp;T was trying
to appeal to students' minds.
   For students trying to get away from the studying rat race, a
10,000-square-foot, open-air, seven-foot-high plastic and maze was
constructed on the beach.
   Known as the AT&amp;T Maze Challenges, students were encouraged to
use their wits and legs to try to make it through the maze in record
time.
   Each day, the maze's pathways, which contain AT&amp;T advertising
posters, are reconstructed into a different configuration, giving
students a chance to try several different mazes.
   ``We estimate, on the average, it will take people between 15 and
20 minutes to complete the maze,'' said David Pugliese, AT&amp;T college
market manager, who said those that complete the maze in record time
receive T-shirts, beach towels and duffel bags.
   ``Lots of people are vying for the attention of the college
students, and I feel this is a healthy and positive event as
compared to some of the things spring break is known for,''
explained Gail Piccirilli, in charge of the college marketing for
AT&amp;T, Basking Ridge, N.J., as she led a reporter through the maze.
   She added, though, she hadn't come to Daytona Beach as a student.
   ``My father wouldn't let me,'' she said.
   Other companies catering to the student crowd included brewers
Anheuser Busch, Miller and Coors and automakers Chrysler and General
Motors.

   Share prices plunged today in Tokyo for their
sharpest one-day decline this year, and the dollar gained against
the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, a 77.01-point loser Friday,
shed another 366.21 points, or 1.14 percent, to finish trading at
31,654.80.
   The index's decline marked the largest one-day drop this year in
a trading session dominated by sell orders following a sharp fall at
the start of today's session.
   Volume traded on the first section today was estimated at 950
million shares, compared with Friday's 1.18 billion shares.
   ``Share prices were lower across the board,'' said Manji Ueda of
Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage.
   He attributed the index's plunge to a 50-point decline in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average in New York on Friday and the trend toward
a weaker yen.
   In New York, the Dow Jones index fell sharply following a U.S.
government report Friday that the nation's producer price index of
finished goods rose a full percentage point in February, triggering
concern that inflation will grow and interest rates will rise.
   Instability on the foreign exchange market and higher interest
rates tend to discourage market participants from investing in
stock, while higher U.S. interest rates would make the dollar more
attractive to foreign currency investors.
   ``The majority of Japanese investors collected profits by selling
off risky issues after they were discouraged by the decline on the
New York market and the yen's weakness,'' Ueda said.
   ``A national holiday (Tuesday) also prompted them to sell off,''
he said.
   Financial markets will be closed in Tokyo on Tuesday, a national
holiday marking the spring equinox.
   In currency dealings, the dollar gained ground and finished
trading at 131.92 yen, up 0.85 yen from Friday's 131.07-yen close.
The U.S. currency opened at 131.88 yen and fluctuated in a range
between 131.79 yen and 132.08 yen.
   The 1 percent rise in the U.S. producer price index of finished
goods in February triggered a new wave of worries about inflation
and interest rate hikes, said a trader with Bank of Tokyo, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   The dollar fluctuated in a fairly tight range in Tokyo mainly
because of position adjustments, the trader said. ``Speculative
investors sold the dollar for profit-taking around the 132-yen
level, while they bought it near 131.70 yen,'' he said.
   ``The Tokyo market's dollar-buying interest is still strong, and
investors are now concerned about the U.S. consumer price index in
February, due out Tuesday,'' the trader said.
   He said a higher consumer price index would further encourage
investors to buy the dollar and boost its value against the yen.

<TEXT>
   This Media General-Associated Press poll on
savings and loans is based on telephone interviews March 6-15 with
1,108 adults in the continental United States.
   Phone numbers were selected randomly, and interviews were
conducted with the adult who had the most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample.
The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that if every
adult American were asked the same questions, the results
theoretically would be the within three points of the poll's
results, 19 times out of 20. The error margin is larger for
subgroups _ five points, for example, for those with savings and
loan accounts.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and
results in this poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100.
   1. Let's consider a few different kinds of places where people
can put their savings: banks, savings &amp; loan associations, credit
unions and money market funds. Please tell me whether you think of
each as a safe place to keep your money, or not.
   a. Banks: Safe: 93 percent. Unsafe: 5. Don't know or no answer: 2.
   b. S&amp;Ls: Safe: 53. Unsafe: 36. DK-NA: 11.

No: 63. DK-NA: 1.
   3. (If yes to 2) Are you afraid that you could lose your money in
a savings and loan failure? Yes: 33. No: 66. DK-NA: 2.
   4. (If yes to 2) Have you held off on adding money to your
savings and loan account because of the financial problems some
savings and loans are having? Yes: 20. No: 79. DK-NA: 1.
   5. (If yes to 2) Have you taken any money out of the savings and
loan because of the financial problems some savings and loans are
having? Yes: 9. No: 91. DK-NA: 0.
   6. (If no to 5) Have you considering doing that? Yes: 22. No: 77.
DK-NA: 1.
   7. (If no to 2) Have you had money in a savings and loan in the
past year? Yes: 8. No: 89. DK-NA: 3.
   a. (If yes to 7) Did you take your money out of the savings and
loan because of the financial problems some savings and loans are
having? Yes: 31. No: 66. DK-NA: 2.
   8. (If no to 7) Are you keeping your money out of savings and
loans because of the financial problems some savings and loans are
having? Yes: 18. No: 79. DK-NA: 3.
   9. The federal insurance fund for savings and loan accounts is
not big enough to cover all the savings and loans that are in
financial trouble. Where do you think most of the money to cover
those accounts should come from _ a fee paid by people who have
accounts at the savings and loans, higher insurance premiums paid by
the savings and loans themselves, or money from the federal
government? Fee: 14. Insurance: 42. Federal: 27. DK-NA: 18.
   10. What do you think government should do with failing savings
and loan associations _ close them down and pay off their
depositors, or provide federal assistance to attract new owners?
Close: 29. Assist: 51. DK-NA: 20.
   11. What do you think is mainly responsible for the problems in
the savings and loan industry - bad management by the savings and
loans, a lack of government regulation, fraud by savings and loan
managers, or general economic problems? Management: 48. Regulation:
10. Fraud: 11. Economic: 21. DK-NA: 10.
   12. Do you think the savings and loans should have more
government regulation, or less government regulation, or is the
current level of regulation about right? More: 53. Less: 7. Right:
25. DK-NA: 15.
   13. Do you think the federal government will come up with a
long-term solution to the financial problems of the savings and
loans, only a temporary solution, or no solution at all? Long-term:
31. Temporary: 39. None: 19. DK-NA: 12.

<TEXT>
   A federal jury reported an 11-1 deadlock but
decided to continue deliberating as the possibility of a second
mistrial emerged in the watershed GAF Corp. stock manipulation case.
   On the ninth day of deliberations Sunday, the jury in the first
criminal trial linked to the confessions of Ivan Boesky reheard more
of two hours of testimony but gave no indication it was closer to
breaking the impasse.
   U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe told the panel of nine
women and three men to reconsider the evidence after the panel
reported the split Saturday. The sole juror said he or she could
shift positions ``under no circumstances.''
   The jury was sequestered March 10 after a six-week retrial.
Attorneys for both sides declined to comment Sunday on the
protracted deliberations.
   The case in federal court in Manhattan is considered a key test
of the government's ability to try Wall Street corruption emanating
from the insider trading scandals of the mid-1980s. It is the first
securities fraud case to reach the trial stage.
   GAF and its vice chairman, James T. Sherwin, have denied charges
of trying to boost the price of Union Carbide Corp. stock in October
1986 in an attempt to reap gains from the planned sale of a large
block of shares. They are charged with eight counts including stock
manipulation, conspiracy, wire fraud and securities fraud.
   The jury, in a note read in court Saturday, asked the judge for
help in resolving the deadlock but did not say whether the majority
favored acquittal or conviction. The move came after more than 65
hours of deliberations.
   ``Your honor. We need help. There are 11 jurors who have come to
a unanimous decision on counts one through eight and one juror who
does not agree,'' the jury said.
   Lowe said that before declaring a mistrial because of the
deadlock, she wanted the jurors to reassess their positions. But she
said jurors should not vote against their conscience just because
they were outnumbered.
   Lowe called a mistrial Jan. 10 after ruling the prosecution
unintentionally withheld from the defense a piece of evidence that
showed a key document had been altered.
   An acquittal would be a major setback for the Manhattan U.S.
attorney's office, which chose GAF as its leadoff case in a series
of securities fraud trials set for this year.
   Prosecutors based the GAF case on information supplied by Boyd L.
Jefferies, a Los Angeles broker who was fingered by Boesky in late
1986 and testify under an agreement with the government. He already
has agreed to plead guilty to two felony counts for breaking
securities laws.
   Boesky, a former arbitrager, is serving a three-year term for
insider trading charges under a settlement in which he also paid
$100 million in fines and restitution.
   Jefferies' testimony is considered central to the Boesky-derived
trials of speculator Salim B. Lewis and takeover specialist Paul
Bilzerian later this year. Attorneys for those two defendants have
been attending the GAF trial.
   During deliberations, the jury asked to rehear testimony of
Jefferies and several other witnesses, as well as review charts,
tables and other documents presented during the six-week trial.
   GAF, a Wayne, N.J.-based chemical and building materials
manufacturer, and two subsidiaries face a maximum total fine of $12
million. Sherwin, 55, of Princeton, N.J., faces 40 years in prison
and a fine of up to $2 million.

   _Nebraska, $15.2 million in claims on $27.2 million in premiums,
representing a profit of $44 for each $100. Nebraska has irrigated
farms and did not suffer as extensive losses as neighboring states
on insured crop lands.

<HEAD>London Shares Lower At Midday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices were lower at midday Monday in patchy
trading, as the market attempted to regain its footing after
Friday's near 40-point slide.
   The market was ``nervous and sensitive,'' said Bob Wade, joint
head of market making at the brokerage firm Robert Fleming and Co.
   An early morning consolidation attempt faltered when several
market makers marked down their stocks and became reluctant to add
stock onto their books, Wade said.
   However, market watchers cautioned that the low volume appeared
to magnify the drop in prices.
   ``There's been vast movement on no real trade,'' one said.
   Market players also were cautious ahead of Wall Street's opening.
They were worried about a continuation of Friday's sell-off in New
York, where the Dow Jones industrial average declined nearly 50
points.
   At about noon in London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was off 18.3 points, or 0.9 percent, at 2,054.8,
above the midmorning low of 2,052.9, but well down from the opening
best level of 2,075.0.
   Volume amounted to 221.8 million shares by midday compared with
267.1 million shares at the same time Friday.

   Stock prices declined broadly today, still
feeling the weight of the new inflation worries that hit the market
on Friday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 15.35 to 2,276.79 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 3 to 1 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 224 up, 710
down and 457 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 22.11 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Friday's news that the producer price index of finished goods
rose a full percentage point in February for the second consecutive
month caught many traders by surprise.
   Interest rates jumped as investors quickly concluded that the
Federal Reserve was likely to tighten credit further in its efforts
to keep inflation in check. Rates were mostly higher again today in
the credit markets.
   More evidence of trouble is expected on Tuesday when the Labor
Department reports on the consumer price index for last month.
   Fears have increased on the Street that the Fed might wind up
pushing the economy to the brink of a recession before it sees any
signs that its anti-inflation campaign is working.
   International Business Machines led the active list, down 1] at
111[ on top of a 5|-point drop Friday, when the company said its
first-quarter earnings would fall short of analysts' estimates.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.90 to 163.76. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.17 at 327.19.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 48.57 to
2,292.14, for its biggest point decline since it tumbled 101.46 last
April 14.
   That all but wiped out strong gains recorded earlier in the week,
leaving the average with a net increase of 10 points from the
previous Friday's close.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by almost 7 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 214 up, 1,424 down and 309 unchanged.
   Big Board volume hit an eight-week high of 242.90 million shares,
against 196.04 million in the previous session.

   A Delaware judge this morning granted an injunction
sought by Shamrock Holdings Inc. to keep Polaroid from completing
its share repurchase program, one of the key elements in the instant
camera company's fight against a Shamrock takeover.
   Shamrock had said earlier today that if the injunction was not
granted, it would tender its 4.9 million Polaroid shares.
   Vice Chancellor Carolyn Berger of the Delaware Chancery Court
granted the injunction for one week while Shamrock appeals her
rulings of last week to the Delaware Supreme Court. She said the
week would give the higher court time to decide if it would accept
the appeal.
   Berger ruled Friday that Polaroid can go ahead with its plan to
buy back 22 percent of its shares and reaffirmed the company's
controversial employee stock ownership plan. The buyback offer was
set to expire at midnight tonight.
   Shamrock claims the stock buyback plan would stack the deck in
favor of Polaroid management in a proxy fight.
   Polaroid has been resisting Shamrock's hostile takeover bid since
July, when the Burbank, Calif., company made an unsolicited offer of
$40 a share. In January, Shamrock increased the bid to $45.
   Last July, Polaroid put 9.7 million shares into an employee stock
ownership plan. In January, the company announced a recapitalization
plan that included selling $300 million of stock to Corporate
Partners L.P., a private investment group.
   Shamrock, a radio and television concern owned by the Roy E.
Disney family, owns about 4.8 million shares of Polaroid and is
waging a proxy fight for control of the board of directors at the
May 9 annual meeting.

   Traders went back to work in the stock and bond
markets today worried about the economic outlook and wondering, ``Is
history going to repeat itself?''
   A repeat of history would mean a precipitous drop in prices _
another crash like Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987.
   The financial markets have been nervous for months about
inflation and the prospect that the Federal Reserve Board would
continue to drive interest rates higher to curb prices and cool off
the economy.
   But concerns about how the economy could affect stock and bond
prices became full-fledged anxiety on Friday, after the Labor
Department reported inflation at the wholesale level soared 1
percent for the second month in a row in February.
   The news unleashed a storm of selling in the stock and credit
markets. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell more
than 48 points, and the Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond fell
more than $17 for each $1,000 in face amount. That meant higher
interest rates.
   Bond traders were so upset by the inflation report they totally
disregarded the strength of the dollar Friday. In many sessions in
the past, the credit markets shrugged off negative economic signals
because the dollar moved higher.
   Traders didn't care about the dollar _ all they saw was interest
rate hikes in the offing.
   Friday's market trends continued today as stocks slumped and
interest rates and the dollar rose.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was off 12.50
points at 2,279.64 as of 11 a.m. EST. The Treasury's long bond was
off another $1.50 per $1,000 face value, as its yield, which moves
in the opposite direction, rose to an even 9.3 percent. The dollar
was slightly up against the Japanese yen, West German mark and
British pound.
   To some observers, Friday's performance bore a disquieting
resemblance to Oct. 16, 1987, also a Friday. That day, the Dow Jones
industrial average lost 108 points in a precursor to its 508-point
collapse three days later on Black Monday.
   Could it happen again?
   ``A crash-type situation is conceivable,'' said Robert Brusca,
chief economist with Nikko Securities International, noting that
``Overseas, things don't look any better.''
   ``Japan has a currency that's falling and an economy that's
runing at a high rate of speed,'' he said.
   The Japanese face high inflation because they are heavily
dependent on oil imports, and the price of oil keeps climbing,
Brusca said.
   European nations face similar problems, he said.
   But Raymond Stone, manager of global and fixed income and
economic research for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, discounted the
possibility of a repeat of October 1987.
   ``There is one difference,'' Stone said. ``Before the crash, the
dollar was heading south ... The dollar has been firming the last
several days.''
   ``You don't have the same lack of confidence you had at that
time,'' said Stone. ``You had a bad (inflation) number, but there's
no fear of a collaspe of the currency.''
   ``I wouldn't go too far in making a comparison,'' he said.
   Economic fundamentals aside, there is little chance of such a
steep decline in stock prices as on Oct. 19, 1987 because safeguards
have been implemented as a result of the crash. On Friday, some of
those safeguards were deployed.
   Price limits on stock-index futures trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange _ known as circuit-breakers _ were used for the
first time since being imposed last year by major financial markets.
   Many critics blamed the effect of computerized strategies
involving simultaneous trading of stocks and the stock-index futures
for worsening the crash, leading to the development of the
circuit-breakers, which also provide for a temporary halt in stock
market trading if the Dow Jones average falls 250 points in one day.
   Even with safeguards in place, Stone doubted there would be much
movement in the markets Monday because of the impending release of
another inflation indicator, the Consumer Price Index for February,
on Tuesday.
   ``I think there's going to be a lot of reluctance to make a major
commitment until CPI,'' he said.
   The consensus among economists was for a 0.5 percent increase in
consumer prices.
   ``If the consensus' expectation is realized, it could take some
of the steam out of the ugly number we got'' on Friday, Stone said.
   William V. Sullivan, director of money market research for Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc., said it would take more than just a few good
economic reports to turn the markets around.
   ``There is almost a sense of despair in the marketplace regarding
the outlook for interest rates,'' he said.
   Sullivan said he expected the Fed would tighten credit further.
``It's highly improbable for any chance of a drop in interest rates
in the next few months.''
   The Fed increased its discount rate _ the interest it charges its
member banks _ half a percentage point to 7 percent almost four
weeks ago.
   But Brusca, of Nikko Securities, said, ``The Fed is faced with a
really terrible dilemma _ if the Fed were to tighten any quicker,
what would it do to the dollar, which is already stronger than it
should be?''
   When U.S. interest rates go up, the dollar becomes more
attractive to foreign investors and also rises. But when the dollar
is too high, the U.S. trade deficit increases _ so a surge in
interest rates could widen the trade gap.
   The trade deficit was cited as one of the factors contributing to
the 1987 crash.

<HEAD>Court Clears Way for Detroit Newspaper Merger</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts grafs 14-28, Finally we seem, with comment and other
action. This also moved on general news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today cleared the way for the
partial merger of Detroit's two daily newspapers.
   The court, over two dissenting votes, set aside an earlier
postponement that had been granted by Justice William J. Brennan.
   A federal appeals court panel here voted 2-1 last Jan. 27 to
uphold then-Attorney General Edwin Meese's decision to allow the
newspapers to form a joint operating agreement under the federal
Newspaper Preservation Act.
   The 1970 law empowers the attorney general to give financially
failing newspapers an exemption from antitrust laws.
   Under the joint operating agreement, the Detroit Free Press and
The Detroit News would combine their business, advertising and
production departments but maintain separate news and editorial
staffs.
   By a 5-4 vote last month, the full appeals court refused to
reconsider the three-judge panel's January ruling.
   Brennan, in a three-paragraph order March 4 postponing the
merger, said he was referring the matter to the full court.
   A group of Michigan readers and advertisers who sued to stop the
partial merger contend that the Free Press, a morning newspaper
owned by Knight-Ridder Inc., is not a failing newspaper even though
it lost $10 milion a year between 1981 and 1986.
   The opponents, calling themselves Michigan Citizens for an
Independent Press, say the Free Press and News, which lost $50
million in the same period, were unprofitable solely because both
papers cut prices in an unsuccessful effort to force each other out
of business.
   Gannett Co., which owns the News, is the nation's largest
newspaper publishing group. Knight-Ridder is the second largest.
   Knight-Ridder has threatened to close down the Free Press if the
joint operating agreement is not approved.
   The opponents' emergency request said the agreement ``threatens
the independence of daily newspapers in 25 cities'' where, like
Detroit, competing newspapers still exist.
   Justices Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens voted to extend
the postponment until the court considers a formal appeal by those
who oppose the partial merger.
   ``Finally, we seem to be near the point where we can assure the
readers of the Free Press that their newspaper is saved,'' said Free
Press Publisher David Lawrence.
   In other action today, the court:
   _ Agreed to decide whether there is a constitutional right to
take the hullocinogenic drug peyote as a religious practice.
   The court agreed to review a ruling that Oregon officials
violated religious freedom by denying unemployment compensation to
two men fired for using peyote at religious ceremonies.
   _ Agreed to use a New Jersey case to decide whether federal
courts may make it easier to broaden age discrimination lawsuits
against employers.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.,
which is accused of bias against older workers in laying off some
1,200 employees at New Jersey plants.
   _ Turned away an appeal by 10 people criminally convicted for
their participation in a 1985 protest demonstration at a
Philadelphia abortion clinic.
   _ Let stand rulings that 1985 articles in Hustler magazine
villifying two women active in fighting pornography are
constiutionally protected expressions of opinion.
   The two women lost their attempts to revive libel lawsuits
against Hustler magazine and its publisher, Larry Flynt.
   _ Left intact rulings that the requirement of a Florida-based
company that all its employees attend weekly Christian devotional
services violated the rights of an atheist who worked there.
   The Townley Manufacturing Co., based in Chandler, Fla., lost its
appeal, in which its lawyers argued that the owner's
constitutionally protected religious freedoms were violated.
   _ Agreed to decide a narrow, but potentially significant, point
of environmental law _ one that may affect the effectiveness of
private citizen enforcement.
   The justices said they will consider reinstating a lawsuit
against a Tillamook County, Ore., landfill by the couple who own an
adjacent dairy farm.
   _ Turned away a still-pending, big-money antitrust dispute over
the sale of raw milk.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court
ruling that could cost millions for two cooperative associations of
dairy farmers and a marketing agent for dairy cooperatives.
   The Detroit newspaper case is Michigan Citizens for an
Independent Press. vs. Thornburgh, A-695.

   Stock prices suffered another broad setback
today, still feeling the pressure of the new inflation worries that
hit the market on Friday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 48.57 points
Friday, dropped 23.21 to 2,268.93 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 3 to 1 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 338 up, 972 down and
479 unchanged.
   Friday's news that the producer price index of finished goods
rose a full percentage point in February for the second consecutive
month caught many traders by surprise.
   Interest rates jumped as investors quickly concluded that the
Federal Reserve was likely to tighten credit further in its efforts
to keep inflation in check. Rates were mostly higher again today in
the credit markets.
   More evidence of trouble is expected on Tuesday when the Labor
Department reports on the consumer price index for last month.
   Fears have increased on the Street that the Fed might wind up
pushing the economy to the brink of a recession before it sees any
signs that its anti-inflation campaign is working.
   International Business Machines led the active list, down 3[ at
109] on top of a 5|-point drop Friday, when the company said its
first-quarter earnings would fall short of analysts' estimates.
   Other losers among the blue chips included Ford Motor, down | at
4ng Sunday to get the craft ready for its
ride atop a jumbo jet to Florida. Officials, however, expected it to
leave on time Friday.
   After their desert landing at Edwards early Saturday, the five
astronauts spent the rest of the weekend with their families.
   They were going back to work today, briefing the space agency on
the shuttle's performance and the experiments conducted during the
nearly flawless five-day mission, said Steve Nesbitt, a Johnson
Space Center spokesman.
   A preliminary examination indicated only 10 thermal protection
tiles will need to be replaced, in contrast to the last shuttle
flight, in December, when nearly 200 tiles were severely damaged.
   ``This is one of the best yet,'' said Cindy Lodge, who works on
the shuttle's tile system. ``We've had no major damages, there's a
few dings ... around the nose cap, nothing severe at all.''
   The tiles shield orbiters during the fiery re-entry into Earth's
atmosphere.
   Five tiles were damaged when wires connected to a tire pressure
monitor snapped as the right main landing gear dropped, Ms. Lodge
said. Only one of those five tiles will need to be replaced, she
said.
   The brakes, which have caused problems during previous shuttle
landings, also performed well, engineers said.
   ``The brakes looked the best ever. No signs of any heat; there
was no damage whatsoever,'' said NASA's Tip Talone, who coordinates
processing of the orbiter for each flight.
   The mission ended with a picture-perfect landing that was watched
by a near-record crowd of 460,000.
   Five hundred people cheered the astronauts' return to Houston
later in the afternoon.
   ``We've had one fun time and we really enjoyed this flight,''
said mission specialist James F. Buchli, who had been on two
previous Discovery missions.
   The flight was commanded by Michael L. Coats, who had flown one
previous shuttle mission. The other crew members _ pilot John E.
Blaha and mission specialists Robert C. Springer and James P. Bagian
_ made their first voyages.
   Discovery's flight, the 28th shuttle mission, was the third since
Challenger exploded shortly after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986. Seven
astronauts died in the explosion, which brought shuttle flights to a
halt for nearly three years.
   Discovery blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., a week ago
today. Six hours into the mission, the crew accomplished its primary
mission _ the deployment of a $100 million communications satellite.
   The satellite completes a network that will enable the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration to have nearly constant contact
with space shuttles and other satellites.
   The astronauts also photographed the Earth. Their film will be
edited into a movie that will document environmental damage by man
and nature.
   Four rats that were aboard as one of the experiments, were killed
shortly after touchdown so researchers can study how their
intentionally cut legs healed in microgravity. Many of the 32
fertilized chicken eggs that were aboard will be allowed to hatch to
see how space affected embryo development.
   Other experiments included growing protein crystals as part of a
project to develop new drugs and seeing how plants grow in
microgravity. The results will be studied by the researchers who
designed the experiments.
   The only problem during the flight concerned an erratic pressure
reading from a hydrogen tank that helps supply electricity to the
orbiter. The astronauts conserved electricity for a day until ground
controllers corrected the difficulty.
   The next shuttle to fly _ Atlantis _ is expected to be rolled out
to a Cape Canaveral launch pad Wednesday for its scheduled April 28
liftoff. The Atlantis astronauts will deploy a probe that will map
the surface of Venus.

<HEAD>Continental Attendants Strike; No Immediate Effect Seen</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Rewrites throughout to UPDATE with Trump lowering offer for
shuttle; adding background on flight attendants union and tightening throughout.
No pickup.</HEAD>

   Continental Airlines flight attendants announced a strike today
and began picketing at airports, but no immediate effects on flights
were reported at strikebound Eastern's sister carrier.
   ``I can only confirm that the strike has been called,'' Myra
Clayton, spokeswoman for the Union of Flight Attendants, said today
in Houston. She said the decision was made among union leaders
Sunday night, but it was not directly related to the strike that has
all but shut down Eastern Airlines since March 4.
   Meanwhile, Donald Trump said today he is no longer willing to pay
his prior offer, $365 million, for Eastern's profitable East Coast
shuttle, because of the labor troubles at Continental's sister
airline. And Eastern began efforts to hire new pilots to replace the
ones who have walked out.
   As the Continental strike deadline came at 10 a.m. EST, some
flight attendants set up picket lines at the carrier's main Houston
hub, but flights appeared to be departing and arriving normally.
   There are about 6,800 Continental flight attendants; the company
and union give differing figures on how many are union members in
the largely ununionized carrier.
   ``It's like an annual event,'' Continental spokesman Dave Messing
said. An Easter 1988 call for a sickout failed to materialize, and
``there's no reason to believe this attempt will be any more
successful,'' he said.
   About 10 members of the Union of Flight Attendants, dressed in
maroon uniforms with Continental emblems, walked a picket line at
Houston Intercontinental Airport, carrying yellow signs proclaiming
``On Strike.''
   ``We were prepared to strike in December and we were promised at
the time that if we waited the company would be willing to sit down
and negotiate a contract with us in January, but that still has not
happened,'' Sheila Hammond, one of the pickets, said.
   There were also pickets reported at Newark (N.J.) International
Airport and Denver's Stapleton International Airport, two other
major Continental airports.
   It was not immediately clear how many flight attendants walked
off their jobs and how many were picketing on their days off.
   There were no immediate reports of problems at airports affected
by the picketing, or at other airports. Many airports require
would-be pickets to seek permission in advance.
   ``We don't see any evidence of that at this point,'' said Richard
Boulware, public affairs director for Denver's Stapleton
International Airport. ``We have not received any requests for
permission to demonstrate or picket by the flight attendants.''
   Continental said in a statement that the flights were running
normally, ``which shows that our flight attendants are proud of
their service and will continue to support the company's goal of
providing for the customer.''
   The company says that only about 5 percent of its flight
attendants are actually dues-paying members of the attendants union,
which is the only union at the airline since 1983. The union says
that more than 60 percent of the attendants are members.
   Continental's flight attendants voted in December to authorize a
strike over wages and have been free to walk out since that time,
union president Carla Winkler said Sunday.
   Messing said the company had reserve attendants it could call in
if the walkout became significant. He said Continental operates
about 1,400 flights daily serving 120 cities in the United States
and numerous foreign countries.
   Continental's flight attendants, although represented by a union,
have been operating without a collective bargaining agreement since
September 1983, when Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air Corp.,
Continental into bankruptcy and abrogated his union contracts. Texas
Air is the parent company of both Eastern and Continental.
   Winkler said she hoped a Continental walkout would make it clear
to travelers and government officials that ``the problem with
Lorenzo isn't just at Eastern.''
   Eastern, meanwhile, announced this weekend a campaign to hire
pilots to replace those who have refused to cross the picket lines.
   The union for the 3,600 pilots who have honored the Machinists'
strike since it began March 4 said it will go to U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in New York to fight the plan. The airline filed for protectio
under the bankruptcy laws five days after the strike began.
   ``All transactions outside the normal course of business need
(the judge's) approval,'' said Air Line Pilots Association attorney
James Linsey. ``Hiring a new work force is certainly not in the
normal course of business.''
   Only about 200 Eastern pilots, most of them management, are
flying, and Eastern is operating less than 10 percent of its
pre-strike schedule of 1,040 daily flights. Most of the
still-operating flights are on the shuttle service between Boston,
Washington and New York, which Eastern has been trying to sell to
Trump.
   In a letter to Lorenzo disclosed today, Trump said he wouldn't
pay $365 million for the shuttle because it ``has become an entirely
different business in that its market share and customer base may be
lost for some time to come, if not forever.''
   ``Today, the business is worth considerably less than the price
negotiated last fall,'' the multimillionaire real estate developer
said.
   Eastern has said that increasing the number of pilots is the key
to its survival.
   ``We need pilots to start rebuilding,'' Eastern spokesman Robin
Matell said Sunday. ``We've waited patiently for the pilots' union
to come to its senses.''
   A union spokesman, J.B. Stokes, said he doubted Eastern would
find many applicants because of an industrywide pilot shortage.
   ``They want to test the marketplace, and they also want to try to
frighten our pilots into thinking they're being replaced. They
should have learned by now that intimidation isn't going to work,''
Stokes said.

   Real-estate magnate Donald Trump said today he
wants to chop more than a third off the $365 million price he's
willing to pay for the Eastern Airlines shuttle because of the
strike that has grounded the carrier.
   In a letter to Frank Lorenzo, head of Eastern's parent company
Texas Air Corp., Trump said, ``The shuttle has become an entirely
different business in that its market share and customer base may be
lost for some time to come, if not forever.''
   ``Today the business is worth considerably less than the price
negotiated last fall,'' Trump said.
   He did not specify how much he's willing to pay now, but told the
Associated Press in a telephone interview: ``I'm looking for a
reduction in excess of $125 million.''
   The New York billionaire developing announced last October that
he would purchase the moneymaking operation for $365 million in cash
and name it after himself.
   However, the strike by Eastern's mechanics and the unwillingness
of most of the airlines' pilots to cross picket lines has forced
Eastern to file for bankruptcy court protection.
   Only about 200 of the 3,600 Eastern pilots have crossed the lines
since the strike by the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers began March 4.
   Eastern has been operating only slightly more than 100 daily
fights, about one-tenth its normal level.
   The airline, which has begun advertising for new pilots, has
acknowledged there are no near-term prospects for expanding its
operations.
   Shuttle flights are among those still taking off. The airline has
been struggling to keep the shuttle between Boston, New York and
Washington in the air by offering a number of passenger incentives,
including promotional fares as low as $12.
   Trump said he remained interested in buying the shuttle and would
like to close a deal ``before the shuttle operations become worse.''
   In his letter, he asked Lorenzo to call him later today to
discuss the sale.

<HEAD>Ringier, Krueger Sign Merger Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The W.A. Krueger Co. printing firm has
agreed to be acquired by Ringier AG of Zurich, Switzerland for $321
million, company officials said.
   The two companies have been partners since 1985 in a joint
venture, Krueger Ringier Inc., the nation's largest printer of
paperback books. Krueger Ringier also prints National Geographic and
other magazines and catalogs.
   Krueger chairman Jack W. Fowler said Monday that the agreement on
a cash price of $10.50 per share is subject to stockholder approval.
Ringier, which owns about 5 percent of Krueger, can void the
acquisition if it fails to receive enough shares to give it 80
percent ownership, Krueger spokesman Cliff O. Bickell said.
   The price was the same as Ringier offered in January. That
takeover stalled after Krueger officials said other buyers were
interested in the company.
   Krueger Ringier had revenues of $237 million in 1988 and profits
of about $15 million, while Krueger had $372 million in revenues and
$15.7 million in profits in the same period.
   Krueger employs about 3,400 people in offices in Scottsdale and
production plants in Phoenix; Jonesboro, Ark.; New Berlin and
Brookfield, Wis.; Senatobia, Miss.; Olathe, Kan.; Fullerton, Calif.;
and Pontiac, Ill., Bickell said.
   Ringier, a family-owned company with 3,000 employees in Europe,
Hong Kong and the United States, publishes the European editions of
USA Today, Fortune magazine and the Journal of Commerce, among other
publications. Its revenues exceeded $500 million in 1988, according
to a statement by chairman Christoph Ringier. The company did not
disclose its profits.
   ``We will create a global printing company that is not only
committed to the American marketplace but also able to offer
international publishers a single printing and distribution
source,'' he said.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Clears Partial Merger Of Detroit Papers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way for
the partial merger of Detroit's two daily newspapers under a 1970
law that permits an antitrust exemption for financially failing
newspapers.
   The court, over two dissenting votes, set aside an earlier
postponement granted by Justice William J. Brennan.
   In other decisions, the high court again refused to let states
and state agencies be sued for allegedly violating federal copyright
laws, and rejected an appeal by workers at a California nuclear
power plant who are challenging their employer's random drug tests.
   In the Detroit newspapers case, a federal appeals court panel in
Washington voted 2-1 on Jan. 27 to uphold then-Attorney General
Edwin Meese's decision to allow the newspapers to form a joint
operating agreement under the federal Newspaper Preservation Act.
   Under the joint operating agreement, the Detroit Free Press and
The Detroit News would combine their business, advertising and
production departments but maintain separate news and editorial
staffs.
   A group of Michigan readers and advertisers who sued to stop the
partial merger contend that the Free Press, a morning newspaper
owned by Knight-Ridder Inc., is not a failing newspaper even though
it lost $10 milion a year between 1981 and 1986.
   The opponents, calling themselves Michigan Citizens for an
Independent Press, say the Free Press and News, which lost $50
million in the same period, were unprofitable solely because both
papers cut prices in an unsuccessful effort to force each other out
of business.
   Gannett Co., which owns the News, is the nation's largest
newspaper publishing group. Knight-Ridder is the second largest.
   In the copyright case, the justices refused to revive allegations
that UCLA, a California state-run university, illegally copied a
company's computer programs and instruction manuals.
   Nine major motion picture studios had urged the court to hear BV
Engineering's appeal to broaden protection against what they said is
widespread copyright infringement.
   The movie producers said, for example, that prisons in Kansas,
West Virginia, Idaho, Utah, Delaware, North Carolina and Rhode
Island are refusing to pay for films shown to inmates.
   The justices on Feb. 21 had turned away a similar appeal by a
photographer who accused a state university in Virginia of
unauthorized use of his photographs.
   In the drug-testing case, the court, without comment, left intact
a ruling that threw out, at least temporarily, a lawsuit attacking
the tests.
   The justices already are studying the validity of drug tests in
three other cases, one involving a private employer and two
concerning federal workers or federal regulations.
   The case acted on Monday stems from tests initiated by Southern
California Edison Co. at its San Onofre nuclear plant.
   In other business-related decisions:
   _The court turned away a still-pending, big-money antitrust
dispute over the sale of raw milk. The justices, without comment,
let stand a federal appeals court ruling that could cost millions
for two cooperative associations of dairy farmers and a marketing
agent for dairy cooperatives.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1982 ruled against
Mid-America Dairymen of Springfield, Mo., Associated Milk Producers
Inc. of San Antonio, Texas, and the Central Milk Producers
Cooperative, based in Chicago.
   _The court refused to let Idaho officials tax the income of
railway workers who live elsewhere but pass through the state as
crew members on nonstop freight trains. It let stand a ruling that
such a tax on crews of Burlington Northern Railroad would violate
the Constitution and be unfair to the workers.
   _The court refused to hear an appeal by a federal judge in
Pittsburgh who issued orders in the bankruptcy case of Jeannette
Corp. glass company after he disqualified himself from presiding
over the matter.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that set aside
the orders by U.S. District Judge Paul A. Simmons.

   Wheat futures prices closed sharply lower Monday
on the Chicago Board of Trade amid reports of a blizzard in Kansas
but other grain and soybean futures advanced, with soybeans posting
fairly strong gains.
   The wheat market had opened lower and remained depressed
throughout the morning on perceptions that weekend precipitation in
the Great Plains had improved growing conditions for the maturing
winter wheat crop and added badly needed moisture to the soil.
   Wheat doubled its losses in the afternoon as selling increased
following reports that wind-driven snow had closed several highways,
including Interstate 70, in western Kansas, an area especially in
need of moisture.
   ``The market went through some liquidation, despite the fact that
when we look at all the precipitation recording during the past 24
hours, it won't necessarily be characterized as a drought-breaker,''
said Ted Mao, a grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in
New York.
   Soybean futures contined their recent upward trend on continuing
concerns about tight supplies of soybeans for immediate delivery.
   At the close, wheat was 5} cents to 8{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.27 a bushel; corn was } cent to
1} cents higher with March at $2.79 a bushel; oats were { cent lower

<HEAD>Former Haas Securities Chairman Indicted on Fraud Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former head of a defunct Wall Street
brokerage firm was charged Monday with illegally inflating the
prices of three stocks in a two-year scheme undone by the 1987 stock
market crash.
   In a 15-count indictment handed up by a federal grand jury,
Eugene Laff, former chairman of Haas Securities Corp., was charged
in what authorities called the first securities fraud case emanating
from the Oct. 19, 1987, crash.
   The indictment is the latest in a three-year federal crackdown on
Wall Street crime and the first by the Manhattan U.S. attorney's
office since the government formed nationwide securities and
commodities task forces in January.
   Laff, 51, of Greenwich, Conn., was charged with conspiring to
manipulate the prices of three over-the-counter stocks to increase
the value of substantial holdings owned by Laff and Haas Securities.
   The indictment is based on the confessions of Stanley A. Aslanian
Jr., 29, a former Haas trader and presidentwho pleaded guilty in
January to conspiracy and agreed to cooperate with the government.
He has not been sentenced.
   ``I think it's a reflection of an ongoing problem of penny stock
fraud,'' Acting U.S. Attorney Benito Romano said. ``It's one that
deserves our serious consideration generally.''
   Attorneys for Laff denied the charges, suggesting that
co-conspirators, including Aslanian, wrongly accused Laff of
participating in the alleged fraud.
   ``It seems that in looking at the indictment a lot of conduct of
other individuals appears to be attributed to Mr. Laff based on the
theories of conspiracy,'' said John Lang, an attorney for Laff.
   The indictment alleges that Laff took part in a conspiracy
starting in January 1986 to manipulate the stock prices of Flores de
New Mexico Inc., T.S. Industries Inc., and Big O Tires Inc.
   He is charged with conspiracy, securities fraud, mail fraud and
obstructing a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. Each
of the 15 counts carries a maximum five years in jail and $250,000
fine.
   Haas Securities, through Laff, allegedly cornered the market on
shares of the stocks and set artificially high prices. By sustaining
the high price, Laff allegedly was able to reap a large profit. The
indictment does not specify how much money was involved in the
schemes.
   Haas Securities, a 75-year-old firm that had 12,000 customers
before going out of business nine days after the crash, is now
liquidating its assets in U.S. Bankruptcy Court proceedings.
   The indictment says Laff acted as a ``market maker'' on the
stocks by being ready to buy and sell a specific stock at prices
published by the firm.
   Laff, Aslanian and several unnamed co-conspirators, the
indictment says, allegedly raised the prices of the manipulated
stocks and placed large blocks of shares in friendly accounts that
were concealed from the public to create the appearance of demand.
   The indictment names, but does not charge, Henry Lorin, president
of a private investment company that allegedly controlled the
accounts and bought blocks of the three stocks.
   Laff made ``bogus, non-market, unauthorized'' transactions that
artificially boosted the share prices without money ever changing
hands, the indictment claims. Laff then sold some stocks accumulated
by Haas Securities at the inflated prices.
   The charge also says Laff published false information about the
stocks, made unauthorized sales to customers who did not have the
money to pay and refused to accept sell orders from customers.
   Haas Securities went belly-up after the crash because it no
longer had the capital to stay in business. Authorities said the
alleged scheme to manipulate the stocks couldn't be maintained after
the market drop and the share prices collapsed.
   After the crash, investors demanded information about the stocks.
Haas Securities allegedly was able to sustain the prices for several
days after the crash until it filed for bankruptcy and the
manipulated share prices plunged.

western Europe for the first time, a U.S. Foreign Agricultural
Service official said Monday.
   U.S. exports to the 12-nation European Economic Community are
expected to drop to $7.3 billion for the year ending Sept. 30,
Thomas O. Kay told a House subcommittee on rural development. U.S.
sales to all of western Europe are expected to reach only $7.8
billion, he said.
   In the year ended last Sept. 30, U.S. exports to the EEC reached
$7.5 billion, compared to $7.3 billion to Japan.
   The biggest gains for U.S. farm sales are coming from the Pacific
countries, Kay said. He said China is now the biggest importer of
U.S. wheat and predicted big increases in exports to South Korea.
   ``We are transferring our resources to that area _ that's where
the future lies,'' Kay said.
   Melvin E. Sims, Argiculture Department general sales manager,
said 1989 will be the last year in which South Korea will get U.S.
government-supported loans to encourage purchases.
   Kay said total U.S. farm exports this year are projected to rise
to $38 billion, up $2.7 billion from 1988. He attributed the
increase to higher prices caused by last summer's drought, which is
expected to reduce the volume of farm exports by 2 percent.

   The dollar drifted lower in quiet U.S. trading
Monday after gaining ground overseas.
   Gold prices strengthened. Republic National Bank of New York said
gold was bid at $395.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up $3 from
Friday's late bid.
   Currency traders said the dollar started out firmer following its
rise in Europe and Asia but that internal market influences and
fears of central-bank intervention depressed demand.
   ``The sentiment is still bullish, though, based on expectations
of higher interest rates,'' said Earl I. Johnson, a trader at Harris
Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.85 yen to a closing 131.92 yen. It was quoted at
132.10 yen in London, and at 131.275 yen in New York, down from
131.70 yen Friday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.7115 from $1.7135 Friday.
Later, in New York, sterling stood at $1.7190, up from $1.7130.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday,
included: 1.86835 West German marks, down from 1.87625; 1.6105 Swiss
francs, down from 1.6185; 1.19425 Canadian dollars, down from
1.19575; 6.33725 French francs, down from 6.3550; and 1,370.50
Italian lire, down from 1,377.00.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Friday: 1.8780 West
German marks, up from 1.8770; 1.6185 Swiss francs, up from 1.6140;
6.3575 French francs, up from 6.3450; 2.1185 Dutch guilders, up from
2.1145; 1,377.00 Italian lire, up from 1,376.25; 1.1935 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1965.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $396.10 a troy ounce, up from $393.60 Friday.
   Gold traded in London at a late bid price of $396 an ounce, up
from $393.25 bid late Friday. In Zurich, the late bid price was
$395.50, up from $393 bid late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.94 to close at a bid $396.81.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver for current

to $6.17 an ounce from $6.14 bid Friday.

<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and gas rigs declined by
three this week to total 740, Baker Hughes Inc. reported.
   Despite occasional weekly increases, the count has followed its
historical pattern of decline during the first months of the year,
falling from a late-December high of 940.
   A year ago, the total was 943, the company said Monday.
   The rig count is a widely watched industry index of drilling
activity and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for
oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker copmany that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per
42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the
rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began
compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Louisiana showed the greatest
decrease _ nine, while Pennsylvania was down five and Michigan was
off four. Other declines were in North Dakota, two; and Colorado and
Ohio, down one each.
   Kansas had the biggest increase with six additional rigs,
followed by Wyoming, with five. New Mexico was up by three, with
California and Oklahoma each up by one. Texas was unchanged for the
week.

<HEAD>Coleman Agrees To $545 Million Buyout By Perelman Group</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coleman Co. Inc. said Monday it had accepted
a $545 million buyout offer from takeover strategist Ronald O.
Perelman, who apparently outbid the company's founding family.
   MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings Inc., which is controlled by
Perelman, agreed to pay $74 a share in cash for the company, which
is the maker of the famed Coleman lantern, other outdoor recreation
equipment and home heating and air conditioning equipment.
   The Coleman family, which controls about 27 percent of Coleman's
7.1 million common shares outstanding, had offered $64 a share Feb.
14 to take the company private in a debt-financed takeover.
   Sheldon C. Coleman, the company's chairman and chief executive,
is the grandson of company founder W.C. Coleman.
   The family reportedly raised its offer to $68 per share during a
sealed-bid auction required by a special committee of the Coleman
board that was reviewing the bids.
   Coleman stock rose $4.25 a share at $72.75 in heavy New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   A number of analysts had speculated the family's initial overture
may have been an attempt to open the company to competing, higher
offers.
   But the family indicated its buyout proposal was aimed at
enabling it and senior management to focus on Coleman's long-term
interests. Family members also repeatedly said privately they wanted
to retain control of the corporation.
   Neither company would comment beyond a brief statement announcing
the deal. The statement did not indicate whether other bids were
received.
   The merger agreement was approved unanimously by the special
committee and by Coleman's board of directors.
   Under the agreement, MacAndrews &amp; Forbes would begin a $74 a
share tender offer by Friday for all outstanding Coleman shares. The
offer was conditioned on at least two-thirds of the shares being
tendered.
   The deal also gives MacAndrews &amp; Forbes the option to acquire up
to 18.5 percent of Coleman's outstanding common shares for $74 a
share, if those shares are needed to help satisfy the minimum tender
provision, the companies said.
   Coleman had record sales of $657.9 million and record earnings of
$24.5 million in 1988.
   In addition to lanterns, Coleman is one of the world's biggest
makers of outdoor recreation equipment such as coolers, sleeping
bags and pop-up travel trailers. The company also makes air
conditioning equipment, lawn movers, home and recreational vehicle
heaters, air guns and electrical generators.
   MacAndrews &amp; Forbes interests range from cosmetics and jewelry to
comic books and licorice extract.
   It is controlled by Perelman, who became chairman of Revlon Group
Inc. after leading a successful takeover fight for the cosmetics
company and made a lucrative although unsuccessful run at Gillette
Co., the personal products maker.
   Late last year, a Perelman-led group put up $315 million and got
$5.1 billion of government aid to acquire five bankrupt Texas thrift
institutions with assets of more than $12 billion.
   The Coleman family had indicated it might sell off the company's
heating and air conditioning products division to help pay for its
proposed leveraged buyout.
   Analysts said Perelman also might want to sell part of the
company's operations, but they doubted there would be a wholesale
breakup of Coleman.
   ``So far, they haven't chopped up companies they've acquired,''
said Harold Vogel, a Merrill Lynch analyst who follows Coleman.

   International Business Machines Corp. said Monday
it and Toshiba Corp. have developed a prototype color flat-panel
display for computers that is larger and clearer than any
demonstrated so far.
   The screen is a scaled-up version of the liquid crystal display
used in high-quality pocket-size portable televisions, IBM said.
   The company said it intends to use the screens on laptop
computers but did not say when they might reach the market.
   The screen has almost 400,000 picture elements arranged in a
720-by-550 array, IBM said. Each element is associated with four
dots: red, green, blue and white. The elements are rewritten 60
times a second, so the panel can display moving images. At its
present stage of development, the 1{-inch-thick screen can display
up to 16 colors.
   The display is the result of a two-year research program by IBM
Yamato Laboratory in Japan, Toshiba, and the IBM Research Division
in Yorktown Heights, N.Y.

<HEAD>Crude Prices Plummet; Products Decline Moderately</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crude oil prices plummeted in heavy trading on
the New York Mercantile Exchange Monday, reversing last week's rally
in which prices rose nearly $2 a barrel.
   The April contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, dropped 82 cents to a closing price of $19.51 a
barrel, taking back 45 percent of the previous week's gains.
   On Friday, the April contract closed at $20.33, the highest level
since Aug. 14, 1987, when crude prices were $20.57 a barrel. It
capped a week-long rally during which prices rose $1.83 a barrel
from the previous Friday.
   Refined oil products traded on the exchange also declined, but
not as sharply.
   Unleaded gasoline for April delivery declined .14 cent to 55.48
cents a gallon, while April heating oil lost .21 cent to settle at
53.36 cents a gallon.
   Traders said the crude market was technically driven, fueled in
part by normal dealings on the last day of the April contract. Other
contract months for 1989 had only modest declines.
   But market fundamentals had not warranted the high price levels
reached on Friday, they said.
   ``The market realized that and took profits today,'' said James
Steel, an energy broker at Refco Inc.
   The market had expected problems with April deliveries to
underpin the recent price rise but they never materialized, some
analysts said.
   ``Instead, the market got a bucket of cold water in the form of
the April squeeze not developing,'' said Nauman Barakat, vice
president of energy investments at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Steel said once prices broke through the $20 mark on the
downside, the momentum picked up. ``That prompted a sharp
sell-off,'' he said.
   Strong demand and declining world oil production have helped
boost prices recently, but energy specialists had forecast that the
market could not sustain prices much higher.
   ``Demand is not that strong. Given that and given expected
slowdowns in economic growth it doesn't justify oil being over $20 a
barrel,'' Steel said.
   Brokers said the slower decline in product prices helped an even
sharper fall in crude prices.

   The stock market fell sharply for the second
straight session Monday under pressure from new inflation worries.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 29.64 to
2,262.50, extending its loss over the past two trading days to 78.21
points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 3 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
357 up, 1,156 down and 430 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 151.26 million
shares, down from 242.90 million Friday, when the total was swollen
by the so-called triple witching hour involving expiring options and
futures on stock indexes.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 179.35 million shares.
   Friday's news that the producer price index of finished goods
rose a full percentage point in February for the second consecutive
month caught many traders by surprise.
   Interest rates jumped as investors quickly concluded that the
Federal Reserve was likely to tighten credit further in its efforts
to keep inflation in check.
   Rates were higher again Monday in the credit markets. Interest
rates on three-month to one-year Treasury bills climbed about 20
basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
   More evidence of trouble is expected on Tuesday when the Labor
Department reports on the consumer price index for last month.
   Fears have increased on the Street that the Fed might wind up
pushing the economy to the brink of a recession before it sees any
signs that its anti-inflation campaign is working.
   International Business Machines led the active list, down 3 at
109{ on top of a 5|-point drop Friday, when the company said its
first-quarter earnings would fall short of analysts' estimates.
   Other losers among the blue chips included Ford Motor, down } at
49[; Exxon, down | at 44{; Digital Equipment, down 2~ at 106}, and
Sears Roebuck, down ] at 42|.
   Pennwalt gained 13[ to 130[. The company, fighting a takeover bid
by a New York investor group, agreed to be acquired by Societe
Nationale Elf Aquitane of France for $132 a share.
   Reebok rose 1\ to 14 on talk that a management group was
discussing a possible buyout.
   By contrast, Syntex fell 2| to 40| after a rumored takeover bid
failed to materialize.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $26.86 billion, or 0.93
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.53 to 163.13.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 3.61 to 334.17, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was down 2.77 at 289.92.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slumped 3.69 to 398.50. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 325.49, down 2.87.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opponents of the partial merger of Detroit's
two major daily newspapers will ask the Supreme Court to hear their
appeal, despite the court's refusal Monday to further delay the
business deal.
   The court, with only two justices dissenting, lifted without
comment a postponement granted March 4 by Justice William J. Brennan.
   The order cleared the way for The Detroit News, owned by Gannett
Co., and Detroit Free Press, owned by Knight-Ridder Inc., to merge
their business and production operations under an antitrust
exemption allowed by the 1970 Newspaper Preservation Act.
   The Justice Department's approval of the partial merger was
challenged by a coalition of newspaper readers and advertisers,
Michigan Citizens for an Independent Press, and Public Citizen, a
Washington-based advocacy group.
   ``We lost a battle in the war,'' said William Schultz, attorney
for Public Citizen. ``On the other hand, I feel much better because
there were two dissents than if there would have been no dissents at
all. The fact that we got two dissents puts us in the serious
category.''
   With the lifting of the stay, the newspapers can begin
immediately to put their partial merger into effect.
   But a Knight-Ridder vice president, Frank Hawkins Jr., said it
was too early to discuss timing of the merger. ``Obviously there
have to be some discussions with our friends at Gannett,'' Hawkins
said.
   Opponents' intention to continue their appeal to the Supreme
Court means the newspapers had to decide whether to proceed with the
merger at the risk of the court later ordering it dismantled.
   ``Once the merger is implemented, the egg has been scrambled, and
how do you unscramble the egg,'' said Harold Spaeth, a political
scientist at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Mich., who
specializes in the Supreme Court.
   ``If the merger was consummated and then terminated, it would be
almost like starting up a new newspaper, and you just don't do that
in a metropolitan area on a daily basis at this point in time,'' he
said.
   Schultz said he was confident there were sufficient votes on the
court to grant a petition to hear the cases. The court's order did
not specify how many of the seven non-dissenting justices in fact
supported lifting the stay.
   Spaeth, however, said the court's refusal to delay the merger
made it unlikely they would consent to hear the case.
   Justices Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens voted to extend
the postponement until the court considers a formal appeal by those
who oppose the partial merger.
   ``I can't think of a nicer way to start out the week,'' Free
Press Publisher David Lawrence said. ``Finally, we seem to be near
the point where we can assure the readers of the Free Press that
their newspaper is saved.''
   Neither Gannett nor the News commented on the justice's decision.
   Opponents of the joint operating agreement argued that the Free
Press was not a failing newspaper even though it lost $10 million a
year between 1981 and 1986. The News lost $50 million in the same
period.
   The losses were due solely to price-cutting by the newspapers in
an unsuccessful effort to force each other out of business, the
opponents said.
   The opponents' emergency request to the Supreme Court said the
agreement ``threatens the independence of daily newspapers in 25
cities'' where, like Detroit, competing newspapers still exist.
   Knight-Ridder has threatened to close the Free Press if the joint
operating agreement is denied.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Chief Says No Immediate Cost Cuts Planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. plans no
immediate cost cuts in response to a Federal Communications
Commission deregulation move last week, AT&amp;T Chairman Robert E.
Allen said Monday.
   Abolishing the regulations by which AT&amp;T sets long-distance rates
in favor of linking rate increases to inflation doesn't completely
deregulate long-distance service, Allen said.
   ``The ruling last Thursday is a step toward full deregulation of
AT&amp;T, but it is just a step,'' he told a news conference before a
meeting of the Economic Club of Detroit.
   The deregulation is intended partly to give AT&amp;T incentives to
increase efficiency, since its profits will no longer be limited to
a fixed rate of return on investment. But Allen said, ``We're not
planning any cost-cutting moves as a result of the decision.''
   Also at the news conference, Allen questioned the prospects for
what he said is needed federal deficit-fighting action, and he
voiced his own irritation with automated, tape-recorded sales
pitches to people's home telephones.
   Allen questioned whether Congress and President Bush's
administration, after squabbling over stage-setting matters such as
John Tower's unsuccessful nomination as defense secretary, can get
along well enough to battle the federal budget deficit.
   Definite action also is needed to reverse nearly 10 years of
ignoring the national debt, Allen said.
   ``A lot of people are saying the right things. At this point I am
a little skeptical about that. I am not sure that recent events in
Washington will create the kind of harmony between the leadership
and the administration to make that happen.''
   But he said, ``There's always hope with a new administration.''
   Regarding computer-operated, tape-recorded sales messages some
companies automatically play over people's telephones, Allen said he
did not favor regulatory action.
   ``I don't like it,'' Allen said. ``I am personally offended by a
computer trying to talk to me.''
   Allen said it was up to customers to discourage such sales
tactics through their reaction against products marketed that way.
   ``Innovators will always find ways to market their products,'' he
said. ``But the marketplace works. If most people find them
offensive, they won't be rewarded for their efforts, and they will
try something else.''

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Tumble As Rain, Snow Moisten Fields</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices fell sharply Monday on reports that badly
needed precipitation in the Great Plains had improved growing
conditions for the winter wheat crop.
   Other grain and soybean futures advanced, with soybeans posting
some fairly strong gains. On other markets, precious metals were
mixed; copper futures fell; livestock and meat futures were mostly
higher; and energy futures finished mostly lower.
   Wheat settled 5} cents to 8\ cents lower on the Chicago Board of
Trade with the contract for delivery in March at $4.26\ a bushel;
corn was 1 cent to 2 cents higher with March at $2.79\ a bushel;
oats were { cent lower to 1 cent higher with March at $2.09 a
bushel; soybeans were 2} cents to 8{ cents higher with March at
$7.76} a bushel.
   The wheat market had opened lower and remained depressed
throughout the morning after the weekend precipitation in the
Plains. Winter wheat now is maturing in the central and southern
states and northern farmers are preparing for spring planting.
   Selling increased in the afternoon, doubling wheat's losses,
following reports that wind-driven snow had closed several highways,
including Interstate 70, in western Kansas, an area especially in
need of moisture.
   ``The market went through some liquidation, despite the fact that
when we look at all the precipitation recording during the past 24
hours, it won't necessarily be characterized as a drought-breaker,''
said Ted Mao, a grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in
New York.
   Analyst Katharina Zimmer of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets agreed
that the weekend preciptation had not been heavy, especially in
Kansas.
   But she said: ``We went into the weekend not expecting rain and
now it's still raining and snowing, maybe enough to make people
abandon their long (or buy) positions.''
   After the close, the National Weather Service issued a forecast
calling for above-average precipitation in the Plains and the
Midwest next week, which could lend a bearish tone to trading on
Tuesday.
   Gold futures advanced moderately on New York's Commodity
Exchange, continuing the rally launched Friday by fears of rising
inflation. Silver futures retreated slightly.
   Copper futures dropped sharply on the Commodity Exchange,
displaying the volatility that has rocked the market for several
weeks amid tight-supply concerns.
   Gold settled $2.40 to $3.40 higher with April at $397.40 a troy
ounce; silver was 0.8 cent to 1.1 cents lower with May at $6.185 a
troy ounce.
   Copper settled 2.9 cents to 3.55 cents lower with May at $1.3335
a pound.
   Most cattle futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
in reaction to firmer cash markets. The April contract reached a new
life-of-contract high _ 78.67 cents a pound _ for the second
consecutive session.
   Pork futures were dragged down by weak cash markets for most of
the session, but a wave of late buying brought the market to a mixed
close.
   Live cattle settled .30 cent lower to .52 cent higher with April
at 78.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent to .65 cent
higher with March at 80.05 cents a pound; live hogs were .17 cent
lower to .25 cent higher with April at 42.62 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .05 cent to .67 cent higher with March at 37.62
cents a pound.
   Most crude-oil futures retreated slightly in a thin market,
although the April contract dropped 82 cents a barrel as traders
bailed out of long positions prior to Wednesday's expiration.
Futures on refined products ended mixed.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 82 cents
lower with April at $19.51 a barrel; heating oil was .46 cent lower
to .13 cent higher with April at 53.36 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .10 cent to .42 cent lower with April at 55.48 cents a
gallon.

   Developer Donald Trump lowered his offer for
Eastern Airlines' shuttle by at least $125 million Monday because of
damage to the service by a walkout by Eastern Machinists and pilots.
   ``I bought something that had a 57 percent share of the market,''
the billionaire said in a telephone interview. ``That share has
deteriorated considerably.''
   In response, Miami-based Eastern sent Trump a letter Monday
afternoon informing him the carrier is seeking other bids for the
shuttle. The letter says Eastern has recently received ``other
offers unsolicited'' and invites Trump to re-submit a bid.
   Trump announced last October that he planned to acquire the
lucrative three-city shuttle service from Eastern's parent Texas Air
Corp. for $365 million.
   But on Monday, Trump said he wants to cut the offered price by
more than a third.
   ``I'm looking for a reduction in excess of $125 million,'' he
said, adding that he considered $200 million a reasonable offer.
   Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst for the investment firm Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co., said Trump's move could reopen the bidding for the
shuttle while signaling the developer's reluctance to get into the
airline business.
   Art Kent, a spokesman for Houston-based Texas Air, did not return
repeated calls for comment. Excerpts from Eastern's letter to Trump,
signed by Barry P. Simon, senior vice president for legal affairs at
Eastern, were released in a statement.
   ``We believe it is our obligation to all our constituencies _
creditors, shareholders, employees and the communities and traveling
public we service _ to ensure that any shuttle sale is completed on
the best possible terms for Eastern,'' Simon wrote to Trump.
   ``Your intention to not proceed at this time on the terms in the
Oct. 12 agreement requires that we take action, consistent with our
obligations under the reorganization process to solicit offers from
third parties for the shuttle.''
   On March 4, Eastern's 8,500-member Machinists union, chiefly
mechanics and baggage handlers, walked off the job. The refusal of
most of the airline's pilots to cross the Machinists' picket lines
has forced Eastern to file for protection from creditors under the
bankruptcy laws.
   Eastern's hourly shuttle service, usually a profitable operation
linking New York with Boston and Washington, has been flying during
the strike.
   In the first days of the walkout, most Eastern shuttle flights
flew nearly empty, but the airline has been trying to rebuild its
business with a number of passenger incentives, including
promotional fares as low as $12. Fares returned to normal on
Saturday.
   Eastern made another pitch Monday to lure shuttle passengers.
Starting March 23, when the cut-rate weekday fares of $49 return to
$99, Eastern will offer an on-time guarantee on shuttle flights.
   If the shuttle plane is more than five minutes pulling away from
the gate, Eastern will greet the arriving passengers with refunds on
the spot or free tickets for other shuttle flights. The exceptions
would be delays caused by airport problems or severe weather.
   A rival shuttle service operated by New York-based Pan Am Corp.
has been flying with full passenger loads.
   Pan Am has seen business on its shuttle service double since the
strike began, said Pan Am spokeswoman Elizabeth Manners. The airline
has added flights and introduced larger aircraft to accommodate the
increased demand, she said.
   In a letter sent Monday to Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo,
Trump said, ``Last fall I agreed to buy a fully operational shuttle
which held nearly 60 percent of the market, commanded the principal
loyalty and confidence of business travelers and provided excellent
service to the customer.
   ``However, as you and I discussed, the shuttle has become an
entirely different business in that its market share and customer
base may be lost for some time to come, if not forever.''
   The shuttle ``is worth considerably less than the price
negotiated last fall,'' Trump said.
   Eastern spokesman Jim Ashlock in Miami said the airline has been
encouraged by shuttle traffic and it was showing signs of luring
back its regular business travelers. He referred requests for
comment about the Trump letter to Texas Air.
   Lorenzo's New York office also referred calls to the Houston
headquarters.
   Bruce Nobles, president of the Trump Shuttle, the company formed
in anticipation of purchasing the Eastern shuttle, estimated Eastern
was now carrying about 20 percent of the shuttle market.
   Systemwide, Eastern is operating only about 100 flights a day,
about one-tenth of its normal flight schedule. The airline has begun
advertising for new pilots, while acknowledging there are no
near-term prospects for expanding its operations.
   Trump, who promised to rename the hourly service ``The Trump
Shuttle'' and redecorate the blue-silver Boeing 727s, said Monday he
was still interested in buying the operation and was prepared to
close a deal with Lorenzo within a week.
   ``I'm not surprised he'd want to lower his price considering the
strike and the troubles (Eastern's) had,'' said Robert Decker, an
analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago.

<HEAD>French Concern Makes $1 Billion White Knight Deal For Pennwalt</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBs 3rd graf pvs to UPDATE with Centaur extending offer through
Friday. Picks up The group...</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TED DUNCOMBE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pennwalt Corp. dealt a severe blow to an
investor group's hostile takeover bid Monday by agreeing to a $1
billion ``white knight'' buyout by the French government-controlled
Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine.
   Some analysts said they did not expect any rival bids to top the
French oil and chemical company's $132 a share offer for each of
Pennwalt's approximately 8 million common shares outstanding.
   Centaur, a New York investment group that was offering $110 a
share for Pennwalt, issued a statement extending its offer through 5
p.m. EST Friday. The offer, which had been set to expire at 5 p.m.
Monday, was extended to give the group time to review the agreement
with Elf Aquitaine, the statement read.
   The group controls about 12.7 percent of Pennwalt's common shares.
   Pennwalt jumped $13.12{ to $130.12{ a share on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   Elf Aquitaine said it would begin a tender offer for the Pennwalt
shares on or before Friday with a scheduled expiration 20 business
days later.
   The merger, which would maintain Pennwalt's name and keep its
headquarters in Philadelphia, is subject to shareholder approval.
The boards of both companies have approved the agreement.
   ``We are delighted that Pennwalt is becoming a member of a global
organization in which there is such a strong strategic fit between
our businesses,'' Pennwalt chairman and chief executive Edwin E.
Tuttle said in a statement.
   Unlike Centaur's offers, which Pennwalt repeatedly spurned,
Tuttle called the Elf Aquitaine buyout ``in the best interests of
all Pennwalt stakeholders.''
   Michel Schneider Maunoury, chairman and chief executive officer
of Elf Aquitaine Inc., the corporation's U.S. holding company based
in Stamford, Conn., said in a telephone interview the deal had been
under discussion for three to four weeks and he did not expect any
trouble completing it.
   Maunoury said the merger would enhance Elf Aquitaine's efforts to
develop its specialty chemical business and to increase its presence
outside Europe.
   ``It's a good company,'' he said. ``...It has good sales all
around the world, everything.''
   Elf Aquitaine, in which the French government owns a controlling
interest, has more than $20 billion in annual sales with more than a
third related to chemicals.
   Analysts said the deal likely would succeed.
   ``It gives the shareholders top dollar,'' said Donald Pattison, a
chemical analyst for C.J. Lawrence, Morgan, Grenfell Inc. in New
York. ``I don't see any way anybody could get any more out of it.
It's really a credit to management, because they stuck to their guns
and they really got a blue-chip purchaser.''
   Centaur, headed by financiers Abbey J. Butler and Melvyn J.
Estrin, announced last June it had acquired a 6.5 percent interest
in Pennwalt, which then was trading at about $62 a share.
   Pennwalt responded by selling its drug and equipment businesses
and buying back about 40 percent of its outstanding shares.
   Centaur made its initial $100 a share offer on Dec. 13, but
Pennwalt had resisted Centaur's overtures since indicated it would
seek other alternatives such as further restructuring or a sale of
the company to a third party.
   Pennwalt, which had $1.02 billion in sales in 1988, repeatedly
has refused to meet with Centaur, saying the offer was inadequate
and the partners unworthy.
   Centaur received a setback earlier this month when a federal
judge blocked a special shareholders meeting the partnership had
hoped to use to stage a proxy fight for control of Pennwalt's board
of directors.
   On Feb. 23, Pennwalt announced it planned to sell its Wallace &amp;
Tiernan equipment division based in Belleville, N.J., for more than
$40 million to a management-led group as part of its defensive
strategy.
   In a separate announcement Monday, Pennwalt said it had agreed to
sell an Italian subsidiary, Pennwalt Italia SpA, to Akzo Chemicals
BV of the Netherlands. Terms were not disclosed.

<HEAD>Convenience Store Owner Says Losses Reflect Buyout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southland Corp., owner of 7-Eleven convenience
stores, Monday reported it lost $37 millionin the fourth quarter and
$216.2 million for all of last year, reflecting high interest costs
and other expenses related to its 1987 leveraged buyout.
   The losses occurred despite strong operating results for its
7-Eleven stores.
   Revenue amounted to $1.97 billion in the three months ended Dec.
31 and $7.99 billion in all of 1988.
   Because of the buyout, the seven months ended July 31, 1987 were
reported on a separate accounting basis than subsequent periods,
which means results from the two periods within 1987 cannot be added
together to produce 1987 full-year financial results, and no
full-year comparisons can be made between 1987 and 1988.
   Southland's 1988 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization was $494.3 million, including $16.5 million from
divested operations, the company said.
   Jere W. Thompson, Southland's president and chief executive
officer, called that figure ``the most appropriate measure of our
progress.''
   ``We're very pleased overall with the company's operating and
financial achievements during its first full year after undergoing
one of the largest leveraged buyouts in history,'' Thompson said in
a prepared statement.
   Southland added 600 convenience stores to its 7-Eleven
international operation in 1988. The division now includes nearly
5,300 stores operated by licensees and affiliates in the United
States and 19 foreign countries.
   Southland operates about 7,000 additional convenience stores in
the United States and Canada, and owns a 50 percent interest in
Citgo Petroleum Corp.
   The company has completed the sale of 910 operating convenience
stores and virtually all of its other businesses scheduled for
divestiture as part of the LBO.
   To date, the company has repaid $977.5 million of its original
$2.55 billion LBO bank debt.

<TEXT>
   Emhart Corp. said Monday it had agreed to
be acquired by Black &amp; Decker Corp. in a $2.8 billion takeover to
thwart a hostile $2.4 billion buyout attempt by an investor group
that includes oil heir Gordon P. Getty.
   The $40 a share agreement, unanimously approved by the boards of
directors of both companies, came weeks after Farmington-based
Emhart spurned the unsolicited $35 a share offer from the Getty
group, known as Topper L.P.
   Peter L. Scott, Emhart's, president, chairman and chief executive
officer, said the combination with Black &amp; Decker, a leading tool
and appliance maker, would create business synergies that should
benefit Emhart shareholders.
   ``The agreement with Black &amp; Decker also alleviates my concern
that prolonging the takeover battle with Topper could have adverse
effects on certain segments of Emhart's business,'' he said.
   Topper issued a statement saying it was ``stunned and outraged''
over the agreement and that it was not asked to make a higher offer.
The group indicated its offer remained negotiable and said it was
studhing ``numerous options.''
   Emhart stock fell 37{ cents a share to $40.75 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. Black &amp; Decker fell $2.62{ a share to
close at $20.75.
   Both Emhart and Black &amp; Decker have been heavily involved in
takeover activity during recent years.
   Emhart staged an unsuccessful, hostile bid to acquire Stanadyne
Inc., a maker of plumbing fixtures, automotive and metal products,
in early 1988. Stanadyne escaped by undergoing an $820 million
leveraged buyout led by the investment firm Forstmann Little &amp; Co.
   Scott has overseen a restructuring at Emhart that has resulted in
the sale of some 18 businesses and the purchase of several key
product lines since September 1986, such as Price Pfister plumbing
fixtures and GardenAmerica in-ground watering systems.
   Emhart and Black &amp; Decker indicated they planned to sell Emhart's
electronics and information systems division under an overall debt
reduction program.
   Black &amp; Decker acquired the small appliance business of General
Electric Co. several years ago. The company also waged a lengthy
unsuccessful battle last year to acquire American Standard Inc., a
New York-based plumbing and air conditioning equipment maker, and
has been seeking other acquisitions since.
   Nolan Archibald, Black &amp; Decker's president and chief executive
officer, said Emhart would broaden his company's product base and
provide ``excellent growth opportunities for Black &amp; Decker for
years to come.''
   ``The do-it-yourself products of Emhart's consumer sector fit
ideally with our power-tool business, broadening our lines with
non-competing products moving through identical channels of
distribution,'' he said.
   The companies said they were considering cutbacks in Emhart's
30,000-member workforce but had made no decisions. They also said
Black &amp; Decker had agreed to honor all Emhart employee severance
plans.
   Black &amp; Decker, with annual sales of about $2.3 billion, is the
world's leading producer of power tools and household products. The
company posted a profit of $33 million on revenue of $705.5 million
for its first quarter ended Dec. 25.
   Emhart is a diversified producer of industrial and commercial
products and information and electronic systems. Emhart had 1988
revenue of $2.76 billion and net income of $126.6 million.
   Mitchell Quain, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder in New York
City, said Black &amp; Decker could suffer from the debt it must incur
to finance the buyout, if high interest rates slow housing
development and thus suppress demand for its products.
   But Quain also said that naming Scott as a director and chairman
of Black &amp; Decker would give the company a better shareholder focus.
   Black &amp; Decker will begin a $40 a share tender offer for all
outstanding shares of Emhart common stock. The buyout was
conditioned on at least two-thirds of Emhart's common shares being
tendered.
   In rejecting the Topper bid earlier this month, Emhart said the
offer was too low and appeared to be tainted by insider trading.
   Scott cited unusual trading activity before announcement of the
offer by Topper, whose partners also include New York real estate
developers Lawrence and Zachary Taylor.
   Emhart's stock, which was selling at $32.75 when Topper tendered
its offer, had risen almost $10 in the month prior to the offer amid
takeover rumors.

<HEAD>Hamburger Chain Founder Loses Bid to Dismiss Insider Trading Charge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The founder of the Carl's Jr. hamburger chain
lost a bid Monday to have a federal insider trading case against him
and several relatives dismissed.
   In rejecting a dismissal motion by Carl Karcher's attorney, U.S.
District Judge Edward Rafeedie ruled that a jury should hear
Karcher's claim that the civil case against him is based only on
circumstantial evidence.
   Karcher is accused of passing on information that allowed several
relatives to avoid losses on stock in Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc.,
which runs 460 Carl's Jr. fast-food outlets in California and the
West.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission case, filed in April 1988,
alleges that various Karcher relatives and one company executive
sold stock to avoid losses totaling $310,000 in advance of an
unfavorable earnings report in 1984.
   The civil suit seeks treble damages.
   Karcher and his wife, Margaret, are accused of passing insider
information to relatives, but aren't accused of selling stock
themselves. Other defendants include the couple's son, Jerome;
daughters, Barbara Karcher-Garrett, Margaret J. LeVecke, Catherine
Karcher-Everly and her husband, Daniel; and son-in-law, Donald E.
Fergus Jr.
   Alvin DeShano, who was accounting director for Karcher
Enterprises, is named in the civil insider-trading suit and also has
pleaded innocent to criminal securities-fraud charges in the case.
   Carl Karcher's brother, Donald F. Karcher, president of Karcher
Enterprises, and six members of his side of the family agreed to pay
a total of $187,560 in February to settle their part of the civil
case. They didn't admit guilt.
   Others included in that settlement were Donald Karcher's wife,
Dorothy; their daughter and son-in-law, Doneta Ann and David
Thomason, and Mrs. Karcher's sister and brother-in-law, Rosemary and
William T. Bruns.
   Carl Leo Karcher, Carl Karcher's son, was ordered in September to
pay $10,500 for his role in the case.

   Owners of the Seabrook nuclear power plant
bought a bond Monday to guarantee enough money to decommission the
reactor if necessary after tests, a move that could give them their
long-sought low-power license.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, in an unprecedented move,
ordered Seabrook owners in December to show they could come up with
$72 million to tear down and clean up the plant after the low-power
tests with radioactive fuel if the plant fails to overcome
evacuation-planning and financial obstacles to a commercial license.
   Opponents have argued that towns in the area could not be safely
evacuated in case of a reactor accident. One of the 12 New England
utilities that own the plant has sought bankruptcy protection becuse
of debt associated with the plant.
   The owners paid $8.5 million Monday to Aetna Casualty and Surety
Co. of Hartford, Conn., to insure any part of the $72 million that
the owners could not come up with themselves, said Seabrook
spokesman Rob Williams. He said Aetna would refund as much as $6
million if the plant operates commercially.
   Edward Brown, president of Seabrook operator New Hampshire
Yankee, called the bond purchase ``a significant milestone for
Seabrook Station.''
   ``We have now met all of the (Nuclear Regulatory Commission's)
stringent requirements to receive a low-power license and begin
important testing of Seabrook's reactor,'' Brown said in a statement.
   The NRC left it to its staff to approve the bond and issue the
low-power license, though the commission gave opponents 10 days
after the license is issued to seek a stay.
   ``If the NRC staff takes a week or two to review this and then
there's a 10-day waiting period, it looks like we could be in a
position to receive low-power in the first part of April,'' Williams
said.
   Veteran plant foe Robert Backus, lawyer for the Seacoast
Anti-Pollution League, noted that the surety bond, if approved, is
the last obstacle to low-power tests at the $5.9 billion Seabrook
project, which originally was planned for commercial operation 10
years ago.
   ``So it's not a good day as far as I'm concerned,'' Backus said.
   In another Seabrook-related development Monday, Gov. Judd Gregg's
office announced that the state will start intensive negotiations
with lead plant owner Public Service Co. of New Hampshire and its
creditors on a bankruptcy reorganization plan for the utility.
   Public Service sought bankruptcy protection 14 months ago because
of debt from its 36 percent Seabrook share.
   Gregg, in a departure from unwavering state support for Seabrook,
announced earlier this month he will try to block testing of the
plant until commercial operation is assured. He called it bad
business judgment to contaminate the plant before a commercial
license is guaranteed.
   State officials said they plan to request within the next week in
bankruptcy court that the testing be stopped.
   On Tuesday, an NRC licensing board opens what could be the last
round of hearings on the plant's commercial license.
   The Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will hold hearings for
several months in Boston on evacuation plans that Seabrook developed
for nearby Massachusetts communities that refuse to cooperate.
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis maintains that no evacuation
plans could work for the crowded beaches and communities within
Seabrook's 10-mile emergency-planning zone.

   The parent corporation of strike-crippled Eastern Airlines got
double trouble Monday when New York developer Donald Trump cut his
bid for Eastern's shuttle and flight attendants called a strike at
sister carrier Continental Airlines.
   There were few signs of disruption from the strike by the flight
attendants union at Continental, but Mary Jane Barry, president of
the Eastern flight attendants' union local, predicted the walkout
would grow.
   ``Right now, they're still trying to get the word out,'' Ms.
Barry said in Miami.
   Continental's flight attendants voted in December to authorize a
strike over wages and have been free to walk out since then, union
leader Carla Winkler said.
   Ms. Barry said parent Texas Air Corp. has been trying to offset
Eastern's strike, begun March 4 by its Machinists union and joined
by the pilots and flight attendants, by increasing Continental's
service.
   Only about 200 Eastern pilots, about half of them management, are
flying, and Eastern is operating less than 10 percent of its
pre-strike schedule of 1,040 daily flights.
   Continental's executive vice president and chief operating
officer, Lewis Jordan, said that as of midday Monday, only 35
attendants were participating in that walkout and would be
``permanently replaced.''
   Ms. Barry, speaking at her union hall where walls were decorated
with posters showing a Dracula figure representing Texas Air
chairman Frank Lorenzo, said unions will announce new actions aimed
at Continental on Tuesday. She declined to give details.
   In another development Monday, the Air Line Pilots Association
charged that Eastern pilots operating during the strike are omitting
pre-flight aircraft inspections, an external visual check which must
be done before departure.
   ``That's an absolute lie perpetrated by the pilot's association
as another tactic to scare the public,'' said Eastern spokesman
Robin Matell. ``There's been no violation of any regulations and
ALPA knows that, but they don't care.''
   Meanwhile, Trump said that because of the strike he no longer
thought Eastern's Northeast shuttle service was worth the $365
million he offered last year. He said he'd like to cut the price by
more than $125 million.
   The deal has been awaiting final approval, and Eastern last week
said it would ask U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York, where Eastern
filed March 9 for Chapter 11 protection and bankruptcy
reorganization, to expedite the sale to Trump.
   In a letter to Lorenzo, Trump said: ``The shuttle has become an
entirely different business in that its market share and customer
base may be lost for some time to come, if not forever.''
   Eastern replied with an afternoon letter telling Trump it was
seeking other bids for the shuttle. The letter, which the airline
issued in a public statement, said Eastern has recently received
``other offers unsolicited'' and invited Trump to re-submit a bid.
   Eastern officials said passenger traffic on the 62 daily flights
on the Boston-New York-Washington shuttle has improved steadily
since the first days of the strike, when some flights carried as few
as seven passengers. For one week it slashed weekday fares from $99
to $49 one way and weekend fares from $69 to $12 to lure passengers
back.
   Eastern made another pitch Monday to lure shuttle passengers.
Starting March 23, when the cut-rate weekday fares of $49 returns to
$99, Eastern will offer an on-time guarantee on shuttle flights.
   If the shuttle plane is more than five minutes pulling away from
the gate, Eastern will greet the arriving passengers with refunds on
the spot or free tickets for other shuttle flights. The exceptions
would be delays caused by airport problems or severe weather.
   A rival shuttle service operated by New York-based Pan Am Corp.
has been flying with full passenger loads.
   Pan Am has seen business on its shuttle service double since the
strike began, said spokeswoman Elizabeth Manners. The airline has
added flights and introduced larger aircraft to accommodate the
increased demand, she said.
   A Teamsters leader at Pan Am, meanwhile, said his union has
initiated ``guerrilla warfare'' against Pan Am operations,
especially its Northeast shuttle service.
   William F. Genoese, director of the Teamsters' Airline Division
and head of the Pan Am local, said the action was taken to show his
union's support for the Eastern strike and to protest Pan Am's
imposition of $35 million in pay cuts on its Teamsters last year.
   The ``guerrilla'' tactics include deliberate diversion of baggage
and cargo and cancellation of passengers' reservations, he said.
   When the Continental strike deadline came at 10 a.m. EST, some
flight attendants set up picket lines at the carrier's main Houston
hub, but flights appeared to be departing and arriving normally.
Pickets also were reported at Newark, N.J., Los Angeles and Denver.
   There are about 6,800 Continental flight attendants, but the
union has been without a contract since Continental's 1983 Chapter
11 reorganization. The company says only 5 percent of its attendants
belong to the union, and the union says 60 percent. Continental's
pilots and machinists lost their unions in 1983.
   Continental spokesman Dave Messing said the flight attendants'
walkout is ``like an annual event.'' An Easter 1988 call for a
sickout failed to materialize, and ``there's no reason to believe
this attempt will be any more successful,'' he said.
   Messing said Continental operates about 1,400 flights daily
serving 120 cities in the United States and abroad.
   The union says Continental flight attendants are paid $11,000 to
$15,000 annually, 30 to 50 percent lower than their counterparts at
other airlines.
   But Jordan, the airline vice president, said Continental is
paying ``comparable industry rates.'' He added that the airline on
Jan. 1 implemented a $19 million wage and fringe benefit increase.
   It was not immediately clear how many flight attendants walked
off their jobs and how many were picketing on their days off.
   In another development related to the Eastern strike, a federal
judge in Manhattan denied a request by unionized workers at four New
York area commuter railroads to delay his order barring them from
honoring Eastern picket lines.
   U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr., who signed
preliminary injunctions barring sympathy strikes at the four rail
lines late Friday, refused to temporarily delay them while the
unions appealed.
