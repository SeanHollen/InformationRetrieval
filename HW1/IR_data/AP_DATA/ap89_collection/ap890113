<HEAD>NAACP Drops Out of NY Times Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The NAACP said Friday it had pulled out of a suit
against The New York Times that charged the newspaper's real estate
advertisements promote racial discrimination by featuring white
models.
   Director Dr. Benjamin Hooks said the NAACP ``suspended its
participation'' because the organization had not held direct
negotiations with the Times prior to filing the suit, contrary to
longstanding policy.
   The suit was filed Thursday in U.S. Disrict Court by the New York
Open Housing Center and four individuals, along with the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   ``While other members of the coalition met with representatives
of the Times, the NAACP was not represented and hence the Times'
publisher, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, was correct when he complained
that the lawsuit was filed without any discussion with the NAACP,''
Hooks said in a news release.
   Hooks said the failure to hold direct talks occurred ``through an
adminstrative oversight.'' Hooks said the suit had not been dropped
and a meeting with Times officials would be sought.
   ``We regret any confusion that might have arisen over this matter
and have taken steps internally to see that such an oversight does
not occur again,'' Hooks said.
   On Thursday, the Times issued a statement maintaining that its
advertising conforms with anti-discrimination laws and saying the
complaint appeared at first reading to be ``without merit.''
   The plaintiffs said photos and drawings that accompany real
estate ads in the Times ``depict whites almost exclusively as
potential residents, thus indicating a preference based on race.''

   Three ``skinhead'' members of a neo-Nazi
youth gang were sentenced Friday to prison terms ranging from three
to seven years for attacking a homosexual man in a Laguna Beach park.
   ``It's not your politics being punished here but your behavior,''
Superior Court Judge David H. Brickner told the men during
sentencing in the highly publicized gay-bashing case.
   Stephen Walther, 18, John Michael Moore Jr., 23, and Aaron
Fredrick Compean, 19, all of Huntington Beach, were acquitted of
attempted murder charges on Dec. 1 but were convicted of assault
with a deadly weapon.
   Walther was sentenced to four years in prison, Moore to four
years and eight months, and Compean to seven years for the July 14,
1988, attack on Robert Thomas Joyce at the city's Heisler Park.
   Joyce, 48, suffered serious injuries at the hands of the
attackers. Compean's use of a lead pipe was the reason for the
lengthier sentence.
   The three had been roaming the Laguna Beach park in search of gay
men to attack when they confronted Joyce, said Orange County Deputy
District Attorney Thomas Avdeef, who won imposition of maximum
sentences.

   Jan Lewczenko hasn't mastered English yet, but
he reached a pinnacle in the dwindling art of deep-cut crystal
glassmaking when he cut the bowl Congress will give George Bush on
Inauguration Day.
   ``It was like a dream come true,'' the shy Polish immigrant said
from his job at the Lenox Crystal Inc. plant in Mount Pleasant, 40
miles southeast of Pittsburgh.
   Lewczenko, 39, is one of fewer than 25 master deep cutters in the
country and of four on the Lenox staff. His experience cutting
difficult designs nominated him for the bowls ordered by the Joint
Congressional Committee on the Inauguration, plant superintendent
Randy Eshland said Friday.
   Lewczenko, pronounced Lev-chenko, is not known as a talkative
man. He did little more in a telephone interview than express his
pride in the assignment and the finished piece.
   ``He's excited and bashful about all the publicity going on
around him. He's not comfortable about it. He's (a) rather quiet
man,'' his wife, Krystyna, 33, said from their home in Mount
Pleasant.
   ``This is like American dream come true, especially ... coming to
this country with 3-year-old kid, without language and $100 on
hand,'' she said.
   Lewczenko's pride was infectious, said Barbara Handyside, the
33-year-old Lenox designer who interpreted the congressional
committee's ideas and worked side-by-side with Lewczenko.
   ``The enthusiasm was just overwhelming. That was part of the
excitement in working with him,'' Miss Handyside said from Lenox
headquarters in Lawrenceville, N.J.
   The first gift Bush receives Jan. 20 and the only one he's
scheduled to get at the inaugural luncheon will be Congress's
crystal bowl of nearly 20 pounds and nearly 9 inches in diameter,
according to Lenox. Vice President Dan Quayle will receive a smaller
version of the bowl, which Lwwczenko also cut. Lenox declined to
reveal the price of the bowls.
   Blossoming cherry trees engraved on the front of each bowl frame
a transparent area through which the west face of the Capitol is
visible engraved on the far side of the bowl.
   The president's bowl rests on a 14-pound, beveled, lead glass
plinth, or flat base. It is inscribed with Bush's name and the words
``Bicentennial Inauguration, Jan. 20, 1989.''
   Rendering an architectural scene on a curved surface complicated
the cutting, which was accomplished by holding the hefty piece
against diamond-and carborundum-tipped cutting tools.
   ``It makes it even more difficult seeing through the glass to
cut,'' said John Potts, vice president of manufacturing for Lenox.
``The skill is to make sophisticated and accurate cuts when your're
holding a heavy piece such as this.''
   ``To hand hold this thing absolutely steady through the hours
that it takes to polish this thing is absolutely unimaginable,''
Miss Handyside said.
   Lewczenko showed an aptitude for skilled work while sculpting
clay as a child, his wife said. He studied at a glass-cutting school
in Poland then spent 20 years cutting glass there.
   He and his wife and son, Matthew, now 10, immigrated to the
United States in April 1983, two weeks before huge antigovernment
protests at the Lenin shipyards.
   Lewczenko worked as an maintenance man while building a
glass-cutting machine at home to create pieces to prove himself as a
cutter.
   A one-year stint at a New Jersey glass studio led to his job at
Lenox.

<TEXT>
   Here are brief sketches of Bernhard Goetz's four
shooting victims, all of whom were 19 when Goetz shot them on Dec.
22, 1984, with an unlicensed .38-caliber revolver.
   Goetz, who was resentenced Friday to one year in jail for
possessing the gun used in the shootings, has said he thought he was
about to be mugged by the four as he rode the subway. The victims
say they were only panhandling.
   Three of the victims, Darrell Cabey, Troy Canty and James
Ramseur, filed lawsuits totaling $63.5 million against Goetz that
were consolidated in state court in October.
   The lawsuit could not proceed unless Goetz was sentenced, ending
his criminal trial, according to Cabey attorney William Kunstler.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Darrell Cabey was the most seriously injured of Goetz's victims;
he was paralyzed from the waist down and suffered brain damage.
   During Goetz's 1987 trial, a neurologist, Claude Macaluso,
testified that Cabey fell into a coma and ``a persistent vegetative
state'' that lasted six weeks while hospitalized.
   ``He sits and watches TV. His mother struggles to make a life for
him,'' Kunstler said Friday.
   Kunstler initially opposed the consolidation of the three
lawsuits filed against Goetz because he said the other two
plaintiffs are notorious felons and Cabey would be prejudiced by
association with them.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _James Ramseur was wounded in his left arm and chest. He is
serving an eight-year sentence at Coxsackie Correctional facility
for raping and robbing a woman.
   During the trial, he said Goetz attorney Barry Slotnick tried to
``kill my credibility'' during courtroom questioning.
   ``I'm not the defendant. I was the victim of that crime,''
Ramseur said. After he refused to testify, he was taken from the
court, held in contempt and his testimony was stricken from the
record.
   ``I don't feel that if I testified it would have made any
difference,'' Ramseur said after the trial.
   Ramseur has said all along that he and Cabey were sitting when
Goetz started shooting. He said he thought the jury should have
found Goetz guilty of attempted murder and assault.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Barry Allen claimed his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination 21 times after being sworn in during Goetz's
trial. He was threatened with contempt. He was denied immunity from
prosecution if he testified.
   He served time at Rikers Island city jail for violating parole
for a necklace snatching. The state Correctional Services Department
said Friday that Allen was paroled in October.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Troy Canty is a self-described former drug addict and
ninth-grade dropout who calmly handled tough questioning by Goetz
attorney Slotnick.
   On the stand, Canty wore a suit and tie and was well groomed.
Slotnick placed a large photograph near Canty of him in sneakers and
a jacket glaring at a photographer.
   Canty acknowledged his past: often in trouble in school,
attacking a teacher, being sent to a psychiatric day school for
``hostile and assaultive'' behavior.''
   He said he learned how to break into video machines when he was
14 or 15 and shoplifted in department stores. He started smoking
marijuana at 13 or 14.
   By the time he met Goetz on the subway, he said, he was using
crack twice a day and had been arrested and convicted on theft
charges.
   He testified he was no longer a drug addict and hoped to enter a
cook training course.

   New research indicates blacks have less access to
medical care than whites.
   According to a 1986 nationwide telephone survey, one in 11 blacks
reported not seeing a doctor for economic reasons, compared with one
in 20 whites. And blacks who did go to a doctor may not have been
treated as well as whites, the study said.
   The report, which appears in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association, also said blacks were less likely to have
health insurance.
   Another study in the Journal reviewed 50 medical studies of
trials of new drugs published from 1984-1986 and found that blacks
were included in less than two-thirds of them.
   A third study looked at racial inequities in use of medical
procedures for heart-disease patients in Massachusetts, and found
that whites were 1.38 times more likely to undergo angiography, a
technique for taking X-rays of the heart, and 2.26 times more likely
to undergo bypass operations.

   Scientists say a new treatment for osteoporosis has
proved successful in reversing the bone loss that afflicts an
estimated 5 million Americans.
   A five-year clinical test reveals that use of a new slow-release
form of sodium fluoride _ long used by dentists to strengthen teeth
_ when given with calcium citrate can reverse the effects of
osteoporosis by increasing bone mass, researchers at the University
of Texas Southwestern Medical Center reported Thursday.
   Spinal osteoporosis, a gradual loss of a kind of bone found
primarily in the spine, commonly affects elderly, postmenopausal
women and results in shortened stature, curvature of the back and a
protruding abdomen that can cause back pain and discomfort in the
digestive system.

   A new ulcer drug that is still being tested is
superior to one of the mainstays of ulcer treatment because it
promotes healing and relieves symptoms more quickly, according to a
new study.
   The study found the new drug, known as omeprazole, worked better
in patients with stomach ulcers than Zantac, one of two widely used
treatments for ulcers. Both work by blocking the body's secretion of
hydrochloric acid.
   After one month of treatment, ulcers had healed in 80 percent of
those getting omeprazole and 59 percent receiving Zantac. After two
months, 96 percent of the omeprazole patients and 85 percent of the
Zantac patients had healed.
   The results were published in Thursday's issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine.

   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommends
two significant changes in the routine for measles vaccinations.
   _ Infants under 15 months old, in areas where recurrent measles
is a problem, should get two measles shots instead of one _ a shot
of measles vaccine alone at 9 months, and a second dose at 15 months
of the commonly used measless-mumps-rubella vaccine.
   _ In schools with measles outbreaks _ and in nearby schools where
the disease might spread _ all students whose measles shots came
before 1980 should be re-vaccinated, along with their siblings.
   Measles specialists have discovered two major outbreak patterns
in recent years: outbreaks among infants under the 15-month
vaccination age and outbreaks among school-age children who have
been vaccinated but still got measles anyway. As much as 10 percent
of all vaccinations don't provide the intended protection.

   Studies show that acyclovir, an antiviral drug,
can reduce or eliminate recurrent outbreaks of genital herpes even
when taken for more than a year, a researcher reported.
   Dr. David Baker, a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology, said
Thursday that a study involving 261 patients with active herpes
infections showed that outbreaks of the disease were virtually
eliminated for about half of those taking acyclovir twice daily. The
others who took the drug experienced milder, shorter outbreaks.
   Although earlier studies showed that acyclovir was effective
temporarily against herpes, Baker said the trial was the first to
demonstrate that the antiviral drug is effective over many months.
   A report on the study was published this month in the journal
Obstetrics and Gynecology.

<TEXT>
   A Belgian soldier assigned to his
country's Washington embassy surrendered to police Thursday, saying
he had killed two people here as revenge after breaking up with his
male lover, authorities said.
   Rudy Van Den Borre, 25, surrendered after making several calls to
police, challenging them to ``come and find me.'' He was booked into
Broward County Jail without bond on two counts of first-degree
murder.
   He told the officer who arrested him early Thursday that he'd
killed two people and was planning another murder as revenge against
the lover he'd just broken up with, the Broward County Sheriff's
office said in a statement.
   ``He had a lover's quarrel with his boyfriend up (in) the
Washington area,'' sheriff's Sgt. Tom Carney told reporters. ``He
came down here, he was emotionally upset about that.''
   Police statements said Van Den Borre arrived in south Florida
Jan. 4 and wandered around the Fort Lauderdale beach area visiting
gay hangouts.
   ``And he meets these people at local clubs, goes down on the
beach with them and at some point decides that he's going to shoot
and kill them,'' Carney said.
   Michael Egan, a 36-year-old airline reservation clerk from Fort
Lauderdale, was found shot in the head Jan. 8. Less than 24 hours
later, the body of Hollywood cab driver Gerald Simons, 52, was
found, similarly killed.
   Fort Lauderdale police said both victims were homosexuals.
   Because Van Den Borre is a diplomatic employee, there is some
question about his status before the law. Officials said the Belgian
Embassy had been told of the charges against him and was cooperating
in the investigation.

<TEXT>
   An automobile magazine that couldn't resist the
trademark battle between General Motors Corp. and an Italian gun
maker did a ``road test'' comparison of Beretta, the pistol, and
Beretta, the Chevy.
   Car and Driver, its editorial tongue planted firmly in its cheek,
has a story in its current issue with the headline: ``We've shot
from the hip before, but never like this.''
   Fabbrica d'Armi P. Beretta SpA, the gun company, sued GM for $250
million in federal court in New York last July, claiming that the
car infringes on the pistol's trademark. The case is pending.
   The Car and Driver comparison was thought up by Editor William
Jeanes, and was written by New York Contributing Editor Bruce McCall.
   ``For our test, we chose a 1989 Beretta V-6 GTU two-door
notchback coupe and a 1989 Beretta 16-round Model 92F 9mm
Parabellum, the spiffiest models in their respective lineups,''
McCall wrote.
   The magazine listed these details:
   Curb weight: Beretta, the pistol, 2.5 pounds; Beretta, the Chevy,
2,847 pounds.
   Top speed: Beretta, the gun, 878 mph (at the barrel end);
Beretta, the sedan, 114 mph.
   Price, as tested: Beretta, the semiautomatic, $596; Beretta, the
car with an automatic transmission, $15,428.
   Along with the facts and figures, there are some performance
opinions in the article:
   _``The Beretta 92F (the pistol) ... hates corners more than any
device C-D has tested since the 1964 AMC Marlin.''
   _``We liked the solid heft and natural feel of the Italian
lightweight. It falls easily to hand. ... No such provision is
designed into the five-speed Getrag shifter fitted to our U.S. test
sample, perhaps because while the Italian aims to be on the hip of
everybody in uniform, the American aims only to be uniform among
everybody hip.''
   _``You can field-strip the Italian in minutes without tools,
while the same task performed on the Chevy would require countless
hours and untold broken fingernails.''

   A generation ago, when this was
Saigon, American officers lived and played in the Rex Hotel, a
sandbagged fortress frequently silhouetted against the night sky by
flares and tracer bullets.
   Today, sedans instead of jeeps drive up to its doors, and
uniformed doormen rather than military guards greet them.
   The Rex now beckons foreign businessmen and tourists, not
soldiers.
   This is the new Vietnam, leaving its course of economic
self-destruction, opening its doors, courting capitalism. Its young
are attuned more to American jeans, pop music and the good life than
to a war with America they never really knew.
   ``In 1975, at that time, I was just seven; I don't know
anything,'' said Thu An, a 20-year-old classical violinist studying
at the Ho Chi Minh Conservatory of Music. It was in April of 1975
that the long war ended.
   In the fifth floor restaurant of the Rex, beneath the
chandeliers, Thu An entertains American tourists with such ballads
as ``I Left My Heart In San Francisco'' and ``The Shadow of Your
Smile'' as they dine on lobster and Chateaubriand.
   There even was a ``Happy Birthday'' salute _ that venerable bit
of Americana _ for Jackie Gershen, a San Diego travel agent who
turned 47. Black-tied waiters brought a birthday cake decked with
lighted candles.
   For the masses, things remain the same, at least for the moment.
They struggle to survive along with their proud and stubborn
country, which exiled itself and waited in vain for what it
considered its due from the world for standing up to the Giant of
the West.
   Throngs of unemployed wander the streets of Ho Chi Minh City,
once the boisterous capital of South Vietnam. Vietnam's unemployment
rate is about 25 percent and the cost of living increased in 1988 by
7 percent to 11 percent a month.
   Like the violinist Thu An, many young Vietnamese have no
emotional attachment to the war, in which the United States took
part from 1961 to 1975.
   They are restless, impatient, looking to personal futures of
education, jobs and travel abroad. They envy affluent Asian
neighbors and countrymen who went to America as refugees and
prospered.
   Some older southerners live in the past, the good old days when
millions of American dollars propped up the economy and brought
Saigonese the luxuries they no longer can afford.
   More workers and government officials are speaking out about the
hardships.
   Nguyen Van Thuong, maitre d'hotel at the Ramuncho Restuarant
favored by Americans in the war years, is unhappy with the measly
$50 a month he is paid for the same job at the Rex.
   ``I do not have enough food for my family,'' said Thuong, who is
53 and has six children. ``I work much but I receive nothing. At
Ramuncho, I was happy.''
   He looked around the room and added: ``There are government
officials everywhere, but we don't scare because our life go down.''
   Some officials agree with him. One is Nguyen Xuan Oanh, a
Harvard-educated economist for the old Saigon regime who advises the
communist government in Hanoi and serves in the National Assembly.
   ``It has deteriorated,'' he said. ``We try very hard to keep some
of the hotels in a decent state so the foreign investors can come
in. We need capital. We need more industrial ventures. We need
technology. We have plenty of labor.''
   The Vietnamese look to the United States for these necessities of
transition from failed central planning to a market-oriented economy
that allows free enterprise, competition and foreign investment.
   Oanh said it does not mean the end of communism, or socialism as
it is called here. He explained:
   ``Socialism is not an end in itself. There are so many variations
of the same thing. We try very hard to keep away from ideology.
   ``Whatever the Americans, the Europeans have done, this is the
result of thousands of years of experience. Let's just take that.
Don't say this belongs to capitalism or what. Take the best of both
worlds and build the economy of Vietnam.''
   In keeping with the new approach, Oanh was blunt in evaluating
the economy:
   ``We have had a lot of state enterprise, but these guys are no
good because they just wait for the government. ... They don't care
whether (what they make) can be sold or not.
   ``Now it's different. We now allow the private businessman to
really worry about production so they have to watch their step. They
have to worry about marketing, everything, just like any other
businessman.''
   Vietnam now imports three times more than it exports, but
officials hope the United States will help by providing financial
aid and lifting its trade embargo once diplomatic relations are
established. They say that should happen within a few years.
   A major sticking point is the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia,
which began with an invasion in December 1978. Occupation troops and
the government Vietnam installed are fighting a civil war with
Cambodian guerrillas.
   ``If there is a political solution, Vietnam will withdraw all its
troops at the latest by next September,'' said Maj. Gen. Tran Cong
Man, editor of the army newspaper.
   ``If there is no political solution now, Vietnam will withdraw
all its troops in 1990. There will be nothing to settle and to
debate. Then the Americans will have no reason not to establish
diplomatic relations.''
   Half a million southerners, many of whom worked for the U.S.
government, have applied for exit visas to America, to join
relatives or in hopes of jobs and business opportunities.
   Tens of thousands have spent years trying to get out and their
struggle has an ironic counterpoint: Members of the first emigrant
wave, many of them now American citizens, return by the thousands
for short visits with relatives and pour badly needed dollars into
the economy.
   Gen. Nguyen Vinh Nghi, 58, who was captured by North Vietnamese
troops shortly before the fall of South Vietnam on April 30, 1975,
hopes to take his wife and three children to the United States.
   He was released from prison camp a year ago and says: ``I have
nothing to do here.''

   A 75-year-old widow in need of money said officials
tricked her out of a masterpiece for a pittance. A court agreed,
giving the first round to her in one of three swindles that have
shaken the French museum world.
   Last month, the court convicted the city of Strasbourg and its
Museum of Decorative Arts of fraud in the purchase from
Marie-Madeleine Falbisaner of an unsigned painting attributed to
Simon Vouet, court painter of King Louis XIII.
   When the museum did not return the painting as ordered, a
magistrate charged chief curator Jean-Daniel Ludmann, 51, with
``breach of trust,'' for failing to do so.
   ``My family has lived for generations in Strasbourg and I wanted
the family heirloom to remain here,'' Mrs. Falbisaner said in a
telephone interview. ``This is what I get for being sentimental. I
was gypped.''
   Ludmann, the museum and Strasbourg have appealed. A decision is
expected within two years and Mrs. Falbisaner hopes to recover the
painting, now in storage at the museum.
   ``Knock wood, I won't die before then,'' she said.
   Also in December, charges were brought against Pierre Rosenberg,
chief curator of paintings at the Louvre, for involvement in the
purchase of a work by 17th century portraitist Bartolome Esteban
Murillo for half its estimated worth.
   Rosenberg, a scholar with an international reputation, was
accused of either knowing or purposely ignoring the fact that the
painting, ``The Gentleman of Seville,'' might have been stolen from
its owner, an elderly, eccentric heiress who died under suspicious
circumstances in 1986.
   Another elderly widow saw justice done in December when an
unsigned painting by Nicolas Poussin was returned to her and she
sold it for $1.4 million.
   Twenty years ago, her husband sold it for the equivalent of $366
to the Louvre, whose experts had noticed the mislabeled painting in
a sale catalogue.
   After the museum displayed it as a Poussin, the family sued. The
court ruled that the Louvre did not have the right to use its vast
resources and expertise to cheat ordinary citizens.
   French museums have been an elite preserve, some say above the
law, so newspapers recounted the unfolding dramas like installments
in a seamy soap opera.
   ``Is there something rotten in the kingdom of museums?'' art
critic Bruno Foucart asked in Beaux Arts magazine, recalling
Hamlet's moral dilemma.
   ``Curator Tripped Up By Canvas,'' one headline sniffed. An
editorial by Gerard Dupuy in the newspaper Liberation was called
``The Scholar Gone Astray.''
   The latest episode is known as the Vouet Affair for the 17th
century portraitist who experts say is the likely creator of Mrs.
Falbisaner's unsigned ``Allegory of Force.''
   Mrs. Falbisaner's story began in 1986 when she decided to
supplement her monthly pension of about $450 by selling ``Allegory''
to the city of Strasbourg for about $55,000.
   It had been in the family for more than 250 years and was
believed to be the work of Vouet, who introduced the Italian Baroque
School to France.
   Experts examined the painting before the sale, however, and to
Mrs. Falbisaner's chagrin, concluded it was a high-quality example
of the Vouet school but not by the master himself.
   The museum still was interested, however, and curator Ludmann
borrowed the work to examine its condition, a standard procedure.
   Without telling Mrs. Falbisaner, he took the painting to the
Louvre for laboratory examinations, including X-rays.
   Tests indicated the work was by Vouet, or at the very least
attributable to him. That information was not passed on to Mrs.
Falbisaner.
   Ludmann sent an enthusiastic letter to city officials urging them
to approve the sale. The tests, he wrote, ``reveal the existence of
several retouchings by the artist himself.''
   He said the price was ``more than reasonable, and assuredly
advantageous, given Vouet's fame and his value on today's market.''
   Both the Louvre and Strasbourg officials have denied formally
authenticating the work as a Vouet.
   ``I'm convinced the essentials of the painting _ its composition,
idea and colors _ are Vouet,'' Ludmann told The Associated Press,
but added that he cannot be certain because the work is unsigned.
   Big money is at stake. In today's art market, a Vouet is
estimated to be worth up to $500,000, nearly 10 times what the
museum agreed to pay Mrs. Falbisaner.
   Many in the art world say privately they are delighted to see
museums get a comeuppance, but have closed ranks publicly,
dismissing the scandals as the price of becoming fashionable.
   ``Ten years ago, no one outside the museum world would have
noticed,'' one said privately. ``Today, a curator is a superstar who
appears on television and dines with the mayor.''
   Ann Cremin, a respected art critic, said: ``The museums, because
of their limited acquisitions budgets, have to be on the lookout for
bargains.
   ``These kinds of affairs have probably happened countless times
in the past. The difference is the money involved. The ordinary
person today hires a good lawyer to get the property back, and the
story makes the papers.''

   Tracy Chapman seems of another time, a time when
Dylan, Odetta, Seeger and Guthrie celebrated freedom and the spirit
of man, and defied brutality and repression with their songs and
anthems.
   Chapman, whose self-titled debut album has been nominated for six
Grammys, is of this age and her songs take a hard, cold look at
poverty, racism, inequality and human relations. She is
uncompromising, tough and compassionate.
   ``I think people look at the world in many different ways and
choose to see what they like,'' she said in an interview last year
with The Washington Post. ``I think lots of people ignore some of
the harder issues, the more unpleasant things. I don't think I harp
on them.''
   Her LP opens with ``Talkin' Bout a Revolution,'' a song that
tells of ``standing in the welfare lines
   Crying at the doorsteps of those armies of salvation
   Wasting time in the unemployment lines
   Sitting around waiting for a promotion
   Poor people gonna rise up
   And get their share
   Poor people gonna rise up
   And take what's theirs.''
   Until ``Tracy Chapman'' hit record stores last April, the
24-year-old poet-singer-songwriter-folksinger was one of the Boston
area's best kept secrets. As an anthrolopolgy major at Tufts
University in Medford, Mass., she performed in coffee houses and
clubs, and was a local hit.
   The LP, with its range from folk to pop ballad to reggae,
enchanted millions more. It has sold over 4 million copies and has
been nominated for album of the year and best contemporary folk
recording. The single, ``Fast Car,'' has been nominated for best
song and record of the year, and Chapman herself is up for best new
artist and best female pop vocalist.
   ``Fast Car'' was a No. 1 hit and tells of a high school dropout
who works to supports her alcoholic father and who wants to escape
it all with her unemployed boyfriend:
   ``You got a fast car
   And I got a plan to get us out of here
   I been working at the convenience store
   Managed to save just a little bit of money
   We won't have to drive too far
   Just 'cross the border and into the city
   You and I can both get jobs
   And finally see what it means to be living.''
   Chapman's rich contralto with its melancholic underpinnings is an
instrument by itself and highly effective on ``Behind the Wall,'' a
song about a battered woman. She sings a capella of the harsh
realties of the domestic fight: ``Last night I heard the screaming -
Then a silence that chilled my soul'' _ and slams the police for
doing nothing.
   She grew up in Cleveland and has been singing since she was a
child. She was in a Connecticut boarding school when
singer-songwriters had been put out to pasture by synthesizer
philistines. Chapman didn't turn on her radio, but many of her
classmates listened to folk music and played guitar.
   In college, one of her classmates was Brian Koppelman, whose
father, Charles, is a leader in the music publishing business. This
gave her the wedge she needed to gain entry to the recording world.
   Chapman, whose musical roots can be traced to Joan Armatrading,
Carol King and Joni Mitchell, was part of a new wave of
singer-songwriters in the late 1980s, especially women such as Toni
Childs, Marti Jones, Melissa Etheridge and Michelle Shocked.

   Public school officials, concerned that students
may be living on the streets, opened homeless shelters in two
Houston schools Thursday so needy pupils can get beds, showers and a
meal.
   A 12-year-old girl who had been sleeping under an abandoned house
was the first of eight people to enter the shelters, officials said.
   ``We didn't discuss anything with the child when she came in,''
said school board President Melody Ellis. ``Right now she's playing
checkers with one of the administrators. We just tried to give her
encouragement and let her play.''
   The shelters will remain open nightly until at least Jan. 20,
when the superintendent the Houston Independent School District will
recommend to the school board that the program be continued or
modified.
   Within an hour of opening, six children arrived at the shelters,
and Ms. Ellis said four other young boys who showed up at one of the
campuses left before entering, apparently because of television
cameras nearby.
   ``It is drizzling outside and it is extremely cold, and I would
really like for these children to come in,'' Ms. Ellis said when
asking reporters to leave the area. Temperatures were in the low 40s
Thursday night.
   By late evening eight youths and one parent were in the two
shelters, including a homeless woman with five children, all
enrolled in Houston schools, and a 14-year-old dropout.
   Houston is estimated to have 20,000 to 25,000 people who live on
the streets or in shelters, but it's uncertain how many of those are
children.
   The school shelters are not intended for children whose families
are staying in city shelters, but rather for those pupils who seem
to live alone on the streets.
   ``We've had teachers discovering students sleeping in areas
around schools, storing clothes under houses in the neighborhood and
some who are asking for help,'' school district spokesman Larry Yawn
said.
   It's not certain why those pupils are on the streets, however.
Judy Hay, of Harris County Children's Protective Services, said use
of the term ``homeless'' for the school program may be a misnomer.
   ``I know there's children out there,'' she said. ``But I
certainly didn't think they were in school. These children have a
home somewhere, but they either are abused or choose not to be at
home.''
   Ms. Hay said programs already exist for ``truly homeless''
children, whose parents, for example, may be living out of their
cars.
   Other social service programs also exist for children who need a
``cooling-off'' time away from their parents, she said.
   ``There are vacancies in shelters right now,'' Ms. Hay said.
``It's going to be interesting to find out what these principals
have been seeing.''
   Under the Schoolhouse Shelters program, approved this week and
announced Wednesday, volunteers from the school system and other
social agencies will staff the shelters, which officials hope may
lead to more permanent assistance for homeless youths seeking help
in a familiar place.
   One school is set up to handle children from kindergarten through
eighth grade. The other is intended for high school students.
   The Red Cross has donated 75 beds and blankets. Existing showers
and dressing rooms in gymnasiums of the schools will be used,
officials said.
   The cost to the school district, while not yet determined, should
be minimal, officials said. The district is providing food _ soup
and sandwiches _ and security guards.
   The program will serve only students enrolled in the Houston
Independent School District, among the nation's 10-largest districts
with about 190,000 students.
   Security officers will guard against drugs and weapons, and Yawn
said hand-held metal detectors will be used at the school entrance.
Students entering the shelters, operated from 5:30 p.m. until 7
a.m., will have to prove they are enrolled before entering.

<HEAD>Bush Known as `Ellie the Elephant' After Wartime Rescue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surviving crew members of the World War II
submarine Finback are looking forward to a nostalgic reunion with
George Bush, the young Navy pilot they dubbed ``Ellie the Elephant''
after rescuing him from the Pacific Ocean more than 44 years ago.
   Don Kohler, 64, of Rogers, Ark., the torpedoman who helped pull a
grateful Bush to safety from his orange life raft onto the Finback's
deck, remembers offering a smile and a hearty ``welcome aboard,''
but recalls little else about the incident.
   ``At that time, he was just another downed pilot,'' said Kohler,
a retired Chicago businessman. ``Nobody back then knew he'd become
president of the United States.''
   Rescued after his plane was shot down by Japanese fire, Bush
eagerly took his turn at night lookout watches and other seagoing
duties, watched Betty Grable movies in the wardroom and donned
earphones to listen in awe as the submarine's torpedoes sank two
enemy ships.
   Former Finback officers remember the 20-year-old Bush as a
gregarious jokester who earned the nickname ``Ellie'' for his comic
wardroom imitation of a trumpeting elephant, they said in recent
telephone interviews.
   ``I remember he was very lively, obviously intelligent and very
personable,'' said retired Rear Adm. Lawrence Heyworth of Virginia
Beach, Va., who was the Finback's torpedo and gunnery officer when
Bush was hauled aboard on Sept. 2, 1944.
   Said Heyworth: ``All three pilots we rescued were bright,
bright-eyed young men, but George seemed the most outgoing and had
the most ebullient personality. He was the most entertaining, and he
made us laugh a lot.
   ``We called him Ellie because of his outstanding imitation of an
elephant trumpeting. Ellie the Elephant. It wasn't because we all
sat around thinking we were Republicans. We must have seen one in a
Tarzan movie. We just thought elephants were funny. We kept asking
George to do it over and over again.''
   ``He had a tremendous sense of humor,'' recalled W.E. ``Bill''
Edwards of Bay St. Louis, Miss., an insurance agent and retired Navy
commander. As a bearded ensign aboard the Finback, Edwards filmed
Bush's rescue with an 8mm Kodak movie camera.
   Edwards said that at last count, nearly 30 surviving officers and
enlisted crewmen of the Finback were planning to attend Bush's
swearing-in at noontime Jan. 20 at the Capitol.
   They and a few of Bush's former flying buddies plan to sit
together in prime bleacher seats on Pennsylvania Avenue for the
inaugural parade after Bush takes the presidential oath of office.
   Inaugural officials reportedly were trying to arrange a reunion
for Bush and his old submarine buddies at Blair House, the
presidential guest quarters across the street from the White House,
possibly next Wednesday.
   Heyworth and Edwards have stayed in touch with Bush over the
years. But most of the Finback veterans haven't seen or spoken to
Bush since he left the submarine at Midway Island after a month-long
combat patrol.
   Bush won the Distinguished Flying Cross for completing his
bombing run against a Japanese radio communications center in the
Bonin Islands, about 600 miles south of Japan, after his Grumman
Avenger torpedo bomber was struck by enemy fire and engulfed in
flames. Bush bailed out over the water but his two crew members were
lost.
   According to his autobiography, Bush's only injuries were a gash
on the forehead and a painful sting from a Portuguese man-of-war. He
was picked up by the Finback less than two hours after his parachute
hit the ocean.
   ``I'm proud of what I was able to do to help Mr. Bush on board
our boat,'' said Kohler.
   But Dan Moody, 71, a Finback veteran and retired radiation
laboratory technician living in Albany, Calif., gave little thought
to Bush at the time.
   ``We brought him aboard, dried him out and gave him hot coffee,''
he said, and then forgot him.
   ``I was 26 years old and a first class torpedoman,'' Moody said.
``Who'd pay any attention to a 20-year-old kid?''

<HEAD>Designated Energy Chief Faces Uphill Struggle On Nuclear Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retired Adm. James D. Watkins is scrambling
back to his battle station three years after ending a sparkling
41-year Navy career. But this time the threat is a homegrown crisis
instead of a foreign power.
   He was nominated Thursday by President-elect Bush to head the
Energy Department, which has been rocked by a partial shutdown of
the nuclear plants that produce the nation's atomic warheads and by
the prospect of devoting tens of billions of dollars to rebuilding
and cleaning up the aging nuclear complex.
   Watkins, 61, has no background in the commercial energy field,
but he has been associated with the Navy's nuclear operations since
early in his career, which was capped by a four-year stint as chief
of naval operations, the top Navy officer.
   In 1958, Watkins studied nuclear engineering at Oak Ridge, Tenn.,
National Laboratory, one of the links in the nationwide nuclear
bomb-making network. He later taught at Navy nuclear training
centers and worked in the Naval Reactors Division of the Atomic
Energy Commission, a forerunner of the Energy Department.
   At a news conference following the announcement of his nomination
as energy secretary, Watkins said grappling with the nuclear weapons
plants problem would be his ``first order of business'' before his
Senate confirmation hearings start.
   Watkins' selection came just hours after President Reagan
formally endorsed an Energy Department report recommending that $81
billion be spent over the next two decades to modernize the nuclear
bomb factories. It acknowledged that budget constraints would make
it difficult to carry out the plan.
   One of the most immediate threats posed by the nuclear weapons
plant problem is the possibility that the United States could run
low on tritium, a short-lived radioactive gas that Energy Department
reactors produce for atomic warheads.
   Last year, the last of the tritium-producing reactors was shut
down for safety reasons, leaving the country at least temporarily
without fresh supplies of the gas.
   The Pentagon has said the reactors must be restarted soon in
order to avoid jeopardizing the nation's nuclear arsenal, but
officials have not said just when the problem would become critical.
No date has been set for restarting the tritium-producing reactors,
although Reagan's report said it was unlikely before late 1989.
   Even once the key reactors are made safe and put back into
operation, the new energy secretary will face great uncertainty over
whether and when to build a new generation of tritium-producing
plants. The existing ones are more than 30 years old. Reagan's
report called them obsolete and in need of replacement.
   A related, and perhaps more long-lasting, problem is finding the
technology _ and the money _ to clean up the widespread
environmental damage caused by four decades of bomb-making.
   Energy industry officials welcomed the selection of Watkins,
although his name was not among the many that had churned through
Washington rumor mills in recent weeks.
   ``Adm. Watkins has demonstrated his ability as a leader and
administrator,'' said Charles J. DiBona, president of the American
Petroleum Institute, representing major oil companies.
   Other officials urged Watkins to tackle the military reactors
problem immediately.
   ``It is especially important that this national security issue be
handled skillfully ... so it does not become an abiding distraction
to other energy issues,'' said George H. Lawrence, president of the
American Gas Association, a trade group.
   Although the nuclear problem is likely to give Watkins his most
immediate headaches, the new energy secretary will face challenges
on other fronts. Among them are:
   _An emerging battle in Congress over whether to raise the federal
gasoline tax as a way of curbing gasoline consumption and cutting
the federal budget deficit. Debate over a possible tax on oil
imports also is likely to heighten this year.
   _A growing wave of oil imports that has increased concern about
U.S. dependence on OPEC. Some economists and members of Congress
have said the government should act now to insulate the nation
better against a supply disruption _ particularly in the volatile
Middle East _ that could force up oil prices.
   _Calls by the natural gas industry for ending all controls on gas
prices. Consumer groups are opposed.
   _Deciding whether to open up more federal lands in Alaska and
elsewhere for oil and gas exploration. Conservations are strongly
opposed; the oil companies say such additional exploration is vital
to halting a recent slide in domestic oil production.

<HEAD>DOE Report Says Accelerator Safer Way to Make Weapons Material</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unreleased Department of Energy report
concludes that a linear accelerator could produce one of the key
ingredients in nuclear weapons more cheaply, quickly and safely than
new production reactors could.
   Such an accelerator would produce far less radioactive waste than
a nuclear reactor and ``should be more readily acceptable to the
public,'' according to a draft summary of the report obtained by The
Associated Press on Thursday.
   The U.S. supply of tritium, a radioactive gas used to produce
nuclear warheads, is threatened by the crumbling condition of the
Energy Department's existing weapons plants and reactors.
   The report, prepared by scientists at the Brookhaven and Los
Alamos national laboratories and at Westinghouse-Hanford Co. in
Washington state, concluded that an accelerator could produce enough
tritium to meet all U.S. weapons needs.
   An accelerator is essentially a long tunnel in which subatomic
particles are whipped at high speeds until they crash into a target,
in this case lithium clad in aluminium. The resulting collision
produces tritium.
   According to the report, using such an accelerator to make
tritium would not produce any ``long-lived'' nuclear wastes and
``costs associated with safety and environmental concerns should be
minimal.''
   In addition, it said, an accelerator ``does not have the
licensing requirements associated with nuclear reactors and should
be more readily acceptable to the public.''
   Last July, the department recommended building two new production
reactors, one at the Savannah River complex near Aiken, S.C., and
the other at the Idaho Falls National Laboratory in Idaho.
   At present, the nation's only facilities for producing tritium
are three reactors at Savannah River, but all three are shut down
either for maintenance or because of safety problems.
   Department officials have said that at least one of the reactors
should be back on line this year, but the start-up date continues to
slip as more problems are found.
   The department's Energy Research Advisory Board looked
``briefly'' at using an accelerator to produce tritium, but ended up
recommending construction of two new reactors, said Chris Sankey, a
DOE spokeswoman.
   ``The board concluded that these technologies were not mature
enough to provide new production capacity in the next 10 to 12
years,'' she said.
   But the DOE report said that the nation's tritium needs could be
met by using an accelerator ``that could be in operation as early as
1996.''
   By comparison, the proposed new reactors are expected to take a
minimum of 10 years to complete.
   ``The required accelerator technology has largely been
demonstrated at the component level although some additional
development work is desirable to effect cost reductions, improved
performance and ease of operation,'' the report said.
   The accelerator would take massive amounts of electricity to
operate, roughly the entire output of a nuclear power plant. One
potential site for it would be in the Pacific Northwest, which has
the cheapest electric rates in the nation.
   The report said ``preliminary discussions'' with the Bonneville
Power Administration indicated that the federal power marketing
agency based in Portland, Ore., would have enough electricity
available to power an accelerator.
   An accelerator could cost more to build, but because the cost of
operating it would be about half that of a reactor, ``total life
cycle costs,'' including construction, would be about 25 percent
less, said Pierre Grand, a scientist at Brookhaven.
   The two planned new reactors would cost an estimated $6.8 billion.
   Grand acknowledged that ``those are ballpark figures and we need
to do a lot more work to come up with firm estimates.''
   But he said he was convinced that construction of an accelerator
would ``alleviate all the safety, licensing and waste problems''
associated with a reactor.
   Grand said that while radioactive waste would be produced, ``you
won't have the transuranic wastes that are the culprits in terms of
long-term storage.''

   Congressmen, teachers, and Saudi princes will
no longer be invited by NASA to be passengers on the space shuttle
under a new policy that emphasizes completing the recovery from the
Challenger accident in which two non-astronauts were killed.
   The space agency announced a new category of ``space flight
participants'' and said, at the same time, that flight opportunities
for them ``are not available at this time.''
   Before the Challenger exploded on liftoff Jan. 28, 1986, NASA had
given minimum training to a senator, a member of the House of
Representatives, a Saudi Arabian prince and Christa McAuliffe, the
first ``Teacher in Space.'' Mrs. McAuliffe was killed along with
industrial engineer Gregory Jarvis and five astronauts.
   ``The Challenger accident marked a major change in the U.S.
outlook and policies with respect to the flight of other than NASA
astronauts,'' the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said
in the policy statement Thursday.
   ``NASA and interested external parties, domestic and
international, must re-examine previous understandings,
expectations, and commitments regarding flight opportunities.''
   At the time of the Challenger explosion, the process of choosing
a reporter to fly on the shuttle was in its final stages. Committees
had winnowed down thousands of applications to 40.
   When the shuttle does begin flying non-essential passengers
again, NASA said, a teacher will be the first.
   The agency said that for now, flight opportunities generally will
be limited to professional astronauts and payload specialists
essential for mission requirements while it works to improve the
reliability of the shuttle and reduces a payload backlog.
   The new space flight participant category embraces those ``whose
presence on board the space shuttle is not required for operation of
payloads or for other essential mission mission activities, but is
determined by the administrator of NASA to contribute to other
approved NASA objectives or to be in the national interest.''
   Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, flew on the shuttle in April 1985 and
Rep. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., was aboard in January 1986, at the
invitation of NASA's administrator. Both hold positions important to
the space program on congressional committees and the official
explanation was that the flights were important to their oversight
responsibilities.
   In 1985, shuttle passengers included Sultan Al-Saud of Saudi
Arabia and Rodolfo Neri Vela, a Mexican. They were aboard, NASA
said, to ``observe'' the launches of the Arabsat and Morelos-B
communications satellites for their countries.
   NASA said that while it remains committed to a long-term goal of
providing such flight opportunities it is devoting its energies to
proving that the shuttle is safe and reliable.
   ``Accordingly, flight opportunities for space flight participants
are not available at this time,'' NASA said. ``When NASA determines
that a flight opportunity is available for a space flight
participant, first priority will be given to a Teacher in Space in
fulfillment of space education plans.''
   All shuttle flights will be planned with a minimum crew of five
NASA astronauts and can be increased to a maximum of seven for
payload or other mission requirements, the agency said. Such added
crew members have to be chosen at least 12 months before the flight
and first consideration will be given to NASA's own people.

   With only a week to go, the Reagan
administration is managing to eke out a few foreign policy successes
before turning leadership in world affairs over to President-elect
Bush and his deputies.
   The withdrawal of 450 Cuban soldiers from Angola this week marks
the beginning of the end of a 14-year presence in the Southwest
Africa country. The pullout is part of a deal arranged by the United
States that will bring independence to Namibia, now under South
African control.
   Chester A. Crocker, the assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, worked eight difficult years for a settlement, continuing
efforts that began early in the Carter administration.
   The Cuban exodus does not end the war in Angola. The Marxist
government, armed by the Soviet Union, is still fighting the rebel
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or UNITA, which has been
supported by South Africa and the United States.
   But the war is likely to be less intense, and Namibia will get
the independence South Africa was unwilling to grant despite
worldwide condemnation.
   In Afghanistan, the Soviets have again started to withdraw their
troops despite threats to stall until a political settlement is
worked out with U.S.-armed rebels.
   Transports carried some units out by air this week, while others
streamed northward from the Soviet garrison in the capital city of
Kabul. By Feb. 15, the last of the 50,000 Soviet troops are supposed
to be gone.
   Here, too, the departure of a foreign army does not mean peace is
settling in. But the fighting may slacken.
   Rebels armed by the United States and Pakistan have government
forces on the run. Without Soviet backing, however, President
Najibullah and his army could collapse without much of a struggle.
   Soviet troops have been in the country since December 1979. Their
ouster was a main foreign policy goal of the Carter and then the
Reagan administration.
   Success came partly as a result of massive Soviet losses and the
kind of anguish at home that Americans suffered during the Vietnam
war. But the advent of Mikhail S. Gorbachev in April 1985 and the
smoother relationship he worked out with President Reagan had a lot
to do with it.
   Superpower cooperation also helped bring about the African
settlement and the ongoing Vietnamese troop withdrawal from
Cambodia, although it did not crack the Arab-Israeli conflict or
have an impact on the wars in Nicaragua and El Salvador.
   In the meantime, the outgoing administration is defying tradition
by not just fading away.
   Secretary of State George Shultz has purchased his tickets for
flying home to California right after the inaugural next Friday. But
a U.S. Air Force jet is waiting for him to board at Andrews Air
Force Base this weekend.
   The idea is to fly to Vienna and celebrate the end of a 27-month
human rights conference, hold a 32nd and final meeting with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and make preparations for
East-West arms control talks.
   Those negotiations will seek the reduction of troops all across
the European landscape. The idea is to ease tensions between the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact.
   To get those talks going, the Soviets met U.S. demands for the
release of more than 600 political prisoners, the reunification of
more than 100 families and stepped-up emigration of Jews, ethnic
Germans and Armenians.
   The Shultz trip is on hold, though, pending resolution of a
dispute between Greece and Turkey over how much Turkish territory
across from Cyprus will be included in the reduction talks.

<HEAD>Hawaii Convention For Troubled System Stirs Protests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for the Farm Credit Council, an arm
of the financially beleaguered Farm Credit System, says it makes
sense to send nearly 200 of its representatives to Hawaii later this
month for a midwinter convention.
   Protests have been raised by a grassroots unit in North Dakota,
the Fargo Farm Credit Services, which tried unsuccessfully to get
the council's St. Paul, Minn., district to reduce its number of
delegates to the meeting.
   The Fargo board objected to sending a 14-member district
delegation, plus some staff people, to the Jan. 24 meeting scheduled
at the Sheraton-Waikiki Hotel. After the one-day council meeting,
most of the delegates will attend the annual convention of the
National Council of Farmer Cooperatives on Jan. 25-26.
   Joe Terrell of the Farm Credit Council's national office in
Washington said the council is an affiliate of the NCFC, which will
send about 800 delegates to Honolulu, compared with the council's
175.
   The council handles lobbying activities for the cooperative Farm
Credit System, which includes nationwide networks of federal land
banks, production credit associations, bank for cooperatives and the
federal intermediate credit bank.
   Overall, the system has a loan portfolio of more than $50
billion. As a result of a continuing financial crisis and huge
losses, Congress late in 1987 drew up a bailout plan that could pour
as much as $4 billion into the ailing system.
   Terrell said Thursday in a telephone interview that the Honolulu
convention site was selected in 1983 by the NCFC and that the
council had studied the situation for almost a year before deciding
to go to Honolulu or hold its own annual meeting somewhere else and
apart from the NCFC.
   Although there was some agonizing over the potential public
relations harm of going to Hawaii, Terrell said that a cost analysis
showed it was good business to join NCFC in Honolulu.
   Terrell said other sites were studied, including Washington,
D.C., and cities in the Midwest and on the West Coast.
   Air travel to Honolulu will be ``a little bit higher for a larger
number of people'' than to mainland cities, he said. But those
additional costs will be offset by other things, such as holding a
joint reception and sharing other functions with the NCFC.
   ``So we decided to do it, knowing that there could be some
criticism about it,'' Terrell said.
   Rep. Byron L. Dorgan, D-N.D., called the decision to send Farm
Credit System officials to Hawaii ``a foolish mistake'' in the wake
of the $4 billion bailout passed by Congress.
   ``We didn't bail them out to send them to Hawaii,'' Dorgan said.
``We bailed them out to help family farmers.''
   Dorgan, in response to an Associated Press query, said the Farm
Credit System has ``done a pretty good job under some rough
circumstances, but this is the kind of foolishness that shows a lack
of sensitivity to how things look to the folks out there in the
country who are paying bills.''
   He added: ``There are plenty of empty hotels in the farm belt
that would love to host a meeting of the Farm Credit folks. There
might be less sun, and also less heat for the Farm Credit Council.''

   Flue-cured tobacco farmers and buyers each will
be assessed 1.12 cents per pound for the 1989 crop, the Agriculture
Department said.
   The total of 2.24 cents covers a no-net cost assessment of 2
cents per pound and 0.24 cents to help cover the federal budget
deficit. The 1989 total assessment will be down slightly from last
year's total of 2.26 cents per pound.
   Department officials said Thursday they consulted with the
Flue-cured Tobacco Cooperative Stabilization Corp., the
producer-owned association that handles the support program, before
determining the 1989 assessment.
   The budget deficit assessment will be imposed according to the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, which calls for a
reduction in the level of price support by 1.4 percent or,
alternatively, an assessment on producers to achieve and equal
reduction in spending.
   Officials said the 1989 price support for flue-cured tobacco will
remain at $1.468 per pound as announced on Dec. 15 for this year's
crop.

<HEAD>Non White Males More Likely to Be Killed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Take two boys born today. One is white. The
other is not. The chances are five times greater that the non-white
boy eventually will become a murder victim, the FBI says.
   Non-white males born now face a 1 in 38 chance of ending up the
victim of a killer, while the risk for white males born today is 1
in 204, according to a statistical study released Thursday.
   The odds faced by the entire population born today are 1 out of
177, the study found.
   Sharon Propheter, a statistician with the Uniform Crime Reporting
program, cautioned that the predictions are based on 1987 figures
and do not account for possible changes in the murder rate.
   ``We can't look into the future and say there are going to be so
many murders in 1999,'' said Propheter, who prepared the report with
statistician Harvey Rosenthal. ``This is based on what happened in
1987.''
   The murder rate in 1987 was 8.3 per 100,000 population. That
year, there were an estimated 20,100 murders nationwide, of which
9,510 victims were non-white, 7,436 of them non-white males. The
murder rate in Canada for that year was 2.5 per 100,000.
   Between 1967 and 1987, the U.S. murder rate leaped 34 percent,
the FBI reported. The highest rate in the past 10 years was 10.2 per
100,000 population in 1980, and the lowest was 7.9 per 100,000 in
1984 and 1985.
   The FBI study was based on the Uniform Crime Reporting statistics
added to a computer model. It did not break down the non-white
category for blacks, Hispanics, Asian-Americans and other
minorities, Propheter said.
   If there were no murders, the average lifespan for all Americans
would increase by almost 3 months, and the average lifespan for
non-white males would increase by more than 11 months, the study
found.
   A person born now can expect to live about 75 years, according to
health statistics.
   The study _ which calculated the probabilities of being murdered
for newborns, those age 20 and those age 40 _ predicted that while
newborn non-white males have a 1 in 38 chance of becoming a murder
victim, the chance for non-white females is 1 in 138. For both sexes
combined, the chance is 1 in 60.
   For newborn white males, the risk is 1 in 204, while for white
females, it's 1 in 437 for a combined chance of 1 in 277.
   For newborns of all races, the chance of being murdered is 1 in
122 for males, 1 in 324 for females and 1 in 177 for both sexes.
   The least likely to be murdered _ among the ages calculated by
the FBI _ are white women who are now 40. They have only a 1 in 931
chance of being murdered. Of all the groups now 40, the highest
probability of being murdered remains non-white males, with a 1 in
97 chance. The overall odds for that age group is 1 out of 453.
   As for men who already have reached age 20, non-whites have a 1
in 41 chance of being murdered, while whites have a 1 in 224 chance,
for an overall chance of 1 in 136.
   For females who are now 20, non-whites have a 1 in 157 likelihood
of being murdered, and whites have a 1 in 504 chance for a total
probability of one in 376.

<HEAD>Studies Say Changes Needed To Help Older Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Looming shortages of skilled labor can be eased
by relying more on older workers, provided they receive training and
their old-age benefits are protected, according to a group of Labor
Department studies.
   ``Educational reform in public schools should eventually maximize
the labor force of the future, but cannot immediately remedy the
skills shortage of today's population,'' Labor Secretary Ann
McLaughlin said Thursday in releasing the department studies. ``I
think clearly that older workers should be tapped across the board.''
   One of the reports, the department's first extensive analysis of
potential labor shortages, said major shortages could occur because
the economy is projected to grow at 2 percent to 3 percent annually
while the rate of work force growth will be just 1 percent.
   The median age of workers is projected to rise from the current
36 to 39 by the end of the century, with the number of people aged
45 and over increasing from the 1986 total of 74.2 million to 96.3
million.
   The government said that most employers, while aggressively
pursuing members of the shrinking pool of younger workers, have
ignored the special needs of older workers, including flexible
scheduling, job sharing, health care and phased retirements.
   In some cases it actually costs older workers to continue working
past the age when they are eligible to retire, the studies said.
That is because Social Security and private pension provisions often
penalize beneficiaries who continue or resume working.
   The Social Security penalties slowly are being phased out, but
the report said that a faster timetable should be considered and
that employers should revamp their private plans, offering employees
incentives to work to a later age.
   Another key to keeping older workers on the payroll, researchers
said, is retraining employees to reflect the changing labor market.
   ``Far more attention needs to be given to the design of jobs and
working conditions that are deliberately tailored to the distinctive
capabilities, limitations, needs and preferences of older workers
now employed and others who, under the right circumstances, might
choose to become re-employed,'' the department said. ``The barriers
are formidable but not insurmountable.''
   The reports said the definition of older workers can vary,
involving employees as young as 47 in some cases. But most problems
are faced by workers in their 60s. Workforce participation drops
significantly at age 62 and again at 65 because these are
eligibility dates for Social Security and many pensions.

   President Reagan led a hushed
crowd at a military review in a moment of silence for the 595
members of the armed services who died in the line of duty during
his administration.
   ``They volunteered; they chose to serve; they gave their lives;
they are our heroes,'' the president said at Thursday's ceremony in
the gleaming new hangar that will be home to the new Air Force One
being built to replace the aging presidential aircraft.
   Reagan led the tribute at a Pentagon-sponsored ceremony honoring
him for his service as commander in chief. Secretary of Defense
Frank C. Carlucci presented the Department of Defense Medal for
Distinguished Public Service and medals from the armed services to
the president.
   During his remarks, Reagan complimented all of those in uniform.
   ``The gratitude of a nation comfortable and at peace properly
goes, not to me, but rather to all of you,'' he said.
   ``Over the last eight years, the luster has been restored to the
reputation of our fighting forces, after a time during which it was
shamefully fashionable to deride and even condemn service such as
yours,'' Reagan told the assembly.
   ``Those days will never come again,'' he said, to thunderous
applause.
   The Marine Band followed its traditional playing of the Marine
Hymn and other armed service anthems with a rendition of the
sentimental ``Auld Lang Syne.''
   The unusual review was to have been held outdoors and include
fly-overs of 17 aircraft from all the services plus the Coast Guard.
It was forced inside by a chilly rain. The fly-overs were called off.

   Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet is leaving London for
the industrial city of Birmingham, lured away by $10.6 million in
extra funding.
   ``The facilities to be built in Birmingham and the new money to
be made available add up to an offer we cannot refuse,'' Jeremy
Isaacs, director of the Royal Opera House, told a news conference
Thursday.
   Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet is the touring section of the Royal
Ballet and performs at Sadler's Wells Theater, while the Royal
Ballet appears at the opera house. Both companies will continue to
be managed by the opera house, Isaacs said.
   He said the ballet company's future artistic development will
``best be secured'' by basing it in Birmingham, Britain's second
largest city with a population of more than 1 million and 110 miles
northwest of London.
   Birmingham authorities will spend $7.1 million extending the
Hippodrome Theater to provide rehearsal and other facilities for the
ballet company and will join the state-funded Arts Council to give
it an additional $3.5 million over two years.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan says some civil rights leaders
are doing so well by ``keeping alive the feeling that they're
victims of prejudice'' that he sometimes wonders whether they
``really want what they say they want.''
   Reagan made the statement in an interview to be broadcast Sunday
on the CBS television program, ``60 Minutes.'' Portions of the
interview were broadcast Thursday on the CBS Evening News.
   The president defended himself against criticism of his civil
rights record, saying he was a lifelong foe of discrimination and
``one of the great things that I have suffered in this job is this
feeling and this editorializing comment that somehow I'm on the
other side.''
   Of the black leaders who have criticized him, he said,
``Sometimes I wonder if they really want what they say they want
because some of those leaders are doing very well leading
organizations based on keeping alive the feeling that they're
victims of prejudice.''
   He declined to name names.
   Mike Wallace of ``60 Minutes'' conducted separate interviews with
Reagan in the Oval Office and with first lady Nancy Reagan in the
presidential residence. He also interviewed them together in the
residence.
   Asked whether she had ever worried during the Iran-Contra crisis
about the possibility of impeachment, Mrs. Reagan said, ``No, well,
no. I _ It never entered my mind until somebody said it on
television, and then that word is a frightening word.''
   ``It's like _ it's like having somebody say cancer to you. You
know, you ... you ... you freeze.''
   Mrs. Reagan did not say who it was she heard discuss the
possibility of impeachment. No impeachment moves were made against
the president, who repeated during the interview his denial that he
swapped arms to Iran in an effort to secure release of American
hostages.
   Mrs. Reagan also said in the interview she believes John
Poindexter, who lost his job as the president's national security
adviser because of the Iran-Contra affair, ``should have told
Ronnie'' about the diversion of profits from the arms sales to
Contra rebels in Nicaragua. The president has said he did not know
of the diversion.
   Asked if she disagreed with her husband about his description of
Poindexter aide Oliver North as a national hero, the first lady
replied, ``Sometimes we disagree.''

<HEAD>Bush's Choice For Drug Czar Is Blunt-Spoken Conservative</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Early in William J. Bennett's tenure as
secretary of education, when he was still on speaking terms with the
National Education Association, the teacher union asked Bennett what
he would do if he had a magic wand to wave over American schools.
   ``No drugs _ none, zero, out, gone, disappear,'' replied the
blunt-spoken educator. ``Give me a wand? All the drugs: gone.''
   During his 3{ years in the Reagan Cabinet, the conservative and
combative Bennett often spoke out about the drug ``plague'' and
chafed at what he felt was an inadequate effort by the Reagan team
to combat the problem.
   Now, as President-elect Bush's choice to be the nation's first
drug czar, it will fall on the shoulders of the burly former college
football lineman to find a way to win that war.
   Bennett, 45, was a headline-grabbing education secretary who
railed against rising college costs and slipshod standards, and
spoke his mind freely on topics in and out of his field, from
defense of Western civilization courses to AIDS to a trip to Managua
to thumb his nose at the Sandinista government.
   His spirited defense of education budget cuts _ including a 1987
attempt to cut in half a $200 million drug education program _ made
him unpopular with school groups and some lawmakers.
   It was Bennett who made the call to embattled Supreme Court
nominee Douglas H. Ginsburg in November 1987 suggesting Ginsburg
withdraw because of his admitted use of marijuana while a law
professor.
   Bennett himself grew up in the raucous 1960s, flirted with the
idea of joining the radical Students for a Democratic Society at
Williams College and had a blind date as a graduate student in Texas
with hard-rocking Janis Joplin, who later died of a drug overdose. A
onetime rock band guitarist, he is an unabashed fan of early rock
'n' roll of the Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens variety.
   In an interview with The Associated Press after the Ginsburg
affair, Bennett said he and Joplin just ``drank a couple of beers.''
He turned aside a question about whether he had ever used marijuana,
saying, ``I will not join this procession of confessors. If I have
any confessions to make, I will make them to a priest. I will
stipulate for the record, however, I was young.''
   But Bennett had said flatly in prior interviews that he never
tried illicit drugs.
   Bush was asked at Thursday's announcement if he knew his new drug
czar was ``addicted to nicotine.'' Bush referred the question to
Bennett, but added, ``He knows his mandate.''
   Bennett, a longtime two-pack-a-day smoker, told reporters, ``You
will not have a director of national drug control policy who
smokes.'' Asked when he was quitting, Bennett, whose post requires
Senate confirmation, said, ``By the time I'm national director.''
   He left Reagan's Cabinet in September to write, open a small
policy shop called the Madison Center, and deliver lectures at
reported fees of up to $15,000-per-apperance.
   He found fault with the Reagan war on drugs, best known for Nancy
Reagan's ``just say no'' crusade.
   ``An all-out war on drugs _ with more resources for police, more
prosecutors, more convictions, more jail sentences _ would be
popular with the American people ... and it would be the right thing
to do,'' Bennett said in an interview with the Heritage Foundation's
Policy Review magazine.
   ``I wish we had done more in the area of drugs. We have done a
lot more than some people will give us credit for, but our policies
on drugs could have been more coherent, more direct. We could have
taken not only the moral lead, which I think President Reagan did,
but more of the legislative lead,'' he said.
   According to an account in the New Republic last May 23, Bennett
repeatedly urged the Pentagon and then-Attorney General Edwin Meese
to unleash the U.S. military against foreign drug traffickers. ``The
military should do to the drug barons what our forces in the Persian
Gulf did to Iran's navy,'' Bennett reportedly advised in one memo.
   Bennett is a Brooklyn-born son of a bank officer and a medical
secretary who was raised in the Virginia suburbs of Washington after
his parents divorced. He majored in philosophy at Williams after
abandoning plans to pursue a career in advertising.
   After obtaining his Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of
Texas at Austin and his law degree at Harvard, Bennett taught at
several campuses and eventually ran the National Humanities Center
in Research Triangle Park, N.C. He was chairman of NEH from
1981-1985.
   As the third education secretary, he made headlines from the
start, when he defended steep student aid cuts by suggesting some
students would simply have to undergo ``divestiture of certain
sorts: stereo divestiture, automobile divestiture,
three-weeks-at-the-beach divestiture.''
   He infuriated college administrators with his broadsides against
rising costs, and once challenged them to start the new academic
year by sending each of America's 12 million college students a
letter warning that drug use would not be tolerated.
   But even some of his enemies admired the flood of attention he
brought to education. In a Wall Street Journal poll of notables last
spring, Bennett emerged as the choice for best Reagan appointee.
   Bennett and his wife, Elayne, a social worker, have a 5-year-old
son, John.

<HEAD>Quayle as Big a Joke Target as Bush, Dukakis During Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If elections came down to who was the butt of
more jokes on late-night television, George Bush and Michael Dukakis
would be sharing the White House and Dan Quayle would be president
for life.
   A study of monologues by Johnny Carson and David Letterman found
that the score during the general campaign was virtually a tie: 51
jokes about Republican Bush to 50 about his Democratic opponent,
Michael Dukakis.
   The study by Robert Lichter and Daniel Amundson of the private,
non-partisan Center for Media and Public Affairs found that the
biggest target was Quayle, the vice president-elect. He drew 52
barbs _ more than 10 times Democrat Lloyd Bentsen's total of five.
   The president-elect did better as the political season
progressed. During the primary campaigns, Bush was on the receiving
end of more jokes than all his Democratic opponents combined.
   ``George Bush's improved media image this fall even reached into
the realm of late-night comedy. But Dan Quayle got stuck with Gary
Hart's role as the all-purpose political joke,'' said Lichter and
Amundson.
   Some of their findings:
   _When Bush mistakenly referred to Sept. 7 as Pearl Harbor Day,
Carson played up the gaffe for three days. One example: ``A reporter
pointed out to Bush that the Japanese attacked on Dec. 7 instead of
Sept. 7. Bush said that's what made it a sneak attack. He said, `If
they showed up on Pearl Harbor Day, it wouldn't have been a
surprise.'''
   _Carson on a typical Bush photo opportunity: ``He was humming `My
Country Tis of Thee' while Mother Teresa spoon-fed him apple pie.''
   _Carson on Bush's appeal to Hispanics: ``George is a good man but
he's not the most ethnic guy around. Somebody asked him what he
thought of Cinco de Mayo and George said, `Oh, I'll just have
regular coffee.' And he had a bad opening. He opened with `Ich bin
ein gringo.'''
   _Letterman on ``The Top 10 Reasons Dan Quayle Would Make a Good
President.'' Among them: ``Would not seem like a brainy egghead when
visiting the nation's injured professional wrestlers;'' ``Boyish
good looks would cause Mrs. Gorbachev to fall in love, reveal state
secrets;'' ``State of the Union Address would be three minutes,
tops!''; and ``Impossible to pick himself as VP.''
   _Carson on Quayle's foreign policy expertise: ``He was asked
today if he would send military aid to the Straits of Hormuz. He
said, `Okay, but the Gays of Hormuz are on their own.'''
   _Carson on Dukakis' short stature and ``the controversy over
whether they should stand during the debate or sit during the
debate. ... Dukakis originally wanted squatting.''
   _Carson, again, on Dukakis' alleged lack of forcefulness:
``Somebody asked him who he's going to vote for and Dukakis said he
was undecided, he was going to wait until after the debate
tomorrow.''

<HEAD>Falklands Ship Heads For Uruguay In Hopes Of Opening Sea Link</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STANLEY, Falkland Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cargo ferry slipped out of the
Falkland Islands for Uruguay and Chile in an attempt to reopen
shipping links with the South American mainland that were ruptured
nearly seven years ago.
   Argentina, which invaded the islands it calls the Malvinas in
1982 and was driven out 74 days later by the British, strongly
opposes the shipping links. Uruguay has said it will not cooperate
unless neighboring Argentina agrees, while Chile says its attitude
depends on Uruguay's.
   The 777-ton Indiana I left Stanley harbor without fanfare
Thursday carrying 12 passengers, believed to be mostly island
businessmen hoping to establish mainland trading links.
   The vessel is expected to reach the Uruguayan capital of
Montevideo on Sunday, then head to the southern Chilean town of
Punta Arenas at the tip of South America before returning to the
remote Falklands.
   The French-built ship was recently refitted in Hull, England. It
is a roll-on, roll-off ferry, meaning vehicles can drive aboard.
   ``It is not a regular service, which is significant, because we
don't know where demand will come from,'' said Graham Botterill,
manager of the ship.
   ``We are an international commercial venture and as such can go
anywhere in the world we like,'' he told reporters in Stanley.
   Botterill said the ship may only sail to Montevideo three times a
season, while the ship's booking agent, Tom Swales, said: ``It is
not a scheduled service, and is different in that respect to, say,
running a ferry link between England and France.''
   The owners hope to attract business executives interested in
saving on freight costs. The present shipping link is with distant
Britain, 8,000 miles away.
   The identity of the Indiana I's owners is not clear, but they are
known to be a consortium including British, Japanese, French,
Taiwanese, South Korean and Spanish fishing companies, each of which
has invested about $260,000.
   The ship has a British crew, is registered in Nassau and flies
the Bahamian flag.
   Argentina claims sovereignty to the south Atlantic archipelago.
Britain rules it as a colony and says sovereignty depends on the
wishes of the islanders, who overwhelmingly want to stay British.
   Attempts to launch Anglo-Argentine negotiations on the islands'
future are stalled over Argentina's demand to put the sovereignty
issue on the agenda, and Britain's insistence that sovereignty is
non-negotiable.

   A district court has ordered a
41-year-old suspect in the killing of Swedish Prime Minister Olof
Palme kept in detention for another two weeks pending further
investigation.
   The Stockholm District Court on Thursday approved the
prosecutors' demand that Christer Pettersson be held until Jan. 27
awaiting formal charges.
   Pettersson was arrested Dec. 14 and arraigned two days later,
raising hopes for an end to a murder hunt that lasted almost three
years.
   He has pleaded innocent.
   Palme, a four-term prime minister, was fatally shot on Feb. 28,
1986, while walking home from a movie with his wife in central
Stockholm.

   A West German affiliate of a company here is
being investigated as a source of at least one piece of equipment
used in a suspected Libyan chemical weapons plant, officials said
Thursday night.
   West German officials are investigating material used in the
Libyan factory that may have come from Frankfurt Zink, a European
affiliate of John Zink Inc., said John Zink President Bernard Benson.
   The United States says the plant at Rabta, about 35 miles
southwest of the Libyan capital of Tripoli, is a chemical weapons
factory. Libya has denied the accusation, saying the plant is
designed to produce pharmaceuticals.
   NBC News reported Thursday night that U.S. intelligence officials
determined as early as the summer of 1987 that Libya had obtained
the chemical components of poison gas.
   Information obtained by the United States included the names of
companies in West Germany and other countries which sold supplies,
equipment and expertise to the Libyans, the network said.
   NBC showed film footage of a Zink company sign in Frankfurt. The
New York Times also has reported that Frankfurt Zink was among a
number of companies from which Libya obtained materials for the
plant.
   Benson said Zink officials in the United State were informed by
West German authorities that the Frankfurt affiliate was being
investigated. He said it is believed, but had not been confirmed,
that a flare manufactured by the company was used in the Libyan
plant.
   ``It's a fairly small part of the plant,'' Benson said. ``A
typical device used in chemical plants to burn off waste gas.''
   The West German government, which had denied that any West German
firms were involved with the Libyan plant, announced Thursday that
it had found traces of West German complicity in building the
factory.
   Benson said company records indicate that the flare, valued at
about $100,000, was to be shipped to a pharmaceutical company in
Hong Kong.
   ``Whether that actually went to Hong Kong or went to Libya, I
just can't verify,'' he said. ``We have no proof that it did end up
there (Libya). It's early in the discovery process for us.''
   John Zink is a worldwide distributor and manufacturer of
combustion equipment and environmental control devices, and about
half of its equipment is shipped outside the United States, Benson
said.

<HEAD>Rock Hudson's Lover Believed He Would be Bequeathed Actor's Mansion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rock Hudson's lover testified that he expected
to receive the actor's hilltop mansion after Hudson died of AIDS in
1985.
   Marc Christian, 35, said Thursday that Hudson never discussed his
will with him, but hinted several times that he would bequeath his
Hollywood Hills home to him.
   Christian told Superior Court jurors that Hudson told him, ``I
hope one day you will be able to enjoy this house as much as I
have.''
   Hudson died of complications from acquired immune deficiency
syndrome in February 1985. His 1981 will left all of Hudson's estate
to a trust. The mansion was later sold to ``Twilight Zone'' director
John Landis for nearly $3 million.
   Christian, an aspiring musician, filed an $11 million lawsuit
against Hudson's estate and his former secretary, Mark Miller, for
failing to tell him Hudson had AIDS. Christian testified Wednesday
that he had unprotected sex with Hudson for nine months before
learning from television news that the screen idol had the fatal
disease.
   Christian has tested negative for AIDS. However, he is also
seeking damages for emotional distress that he claims he continues
to suffer because doctors have told him the incubation period for
the disease can be 10 years or more.
   ``When I really think about it and can't get it out of my mind, I
begin to sweat. At night, I have nightmares that I'll look like Rock
did _ like a cadaver,'' Christian said.
   Attorneys for the estate and Miller contend Christian and Hudson
stopped having sexual relatiions in February 1984, four months
before Hudson was diagnosed with the disease. They say Christian
filed the lawsuit after he learned he was left out of Hudson's will.

   Under President Reagan's tenure as
commander-in-chief, the military has experienced its largest
peacetime buildup. Here, at a glance, are some of the changes that
have taken place in the past eight years.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   BUDGET: Annual Pentagon spending in terms of budget authority
rose from $213.8 billion in fiscal 1982 _ the first full year of
Reagan's presidency _ to $290.8 billion in fiscal 1989. In all, the
administration allocated $2.13 trillion to the Department of
Defense, an amount that does not include Department of Energy
spending on nuclear warheads.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   NAVY: The number of carrier battlegroups has increased from 12
when Reagan took office to 15. Modernization programs include
purchase of eight Trident submarines, four Nimitz-class aircraft
carriers, 33 new Aegis cruisers, 27 nuclear-powered attack
submarines, new WASP class amphibious ships, four modernized
battleships and two hospital ships. In naval manpower, the service
increased its number of petty officers to 54,000 after a shortage of
22,000 in 1981. The administration gained approval for a 600-ship
fleet but was forced to scale back its request.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ARMY: The Army's modernization resulted in purchases of 397 AH-64
Apaches, an all-weather attack helicopter; 924 Blackhawks, a modern
utility helicopter; 5,350 M-1A1 Abrams tanks, and 3,913 Bradley
fighting vehicles. The Army also fielded 416 MLRS's, multiple
launcher rocket systems. Under department reorganization, two new
light divisions were formed that would allow forces to get to
troubled areas quickly. The Army also persuaded Congress to
authorize for the first time in more than a decade a new type of
chemical weapon for the U.S. stockpile.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MARINES: Modernization included purchase of more than 100 AV-8B
vertical takeoff attack jets and development of a new air-cushion
landing craft for amphibious assaults.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   AIR FORCE: The Air Force's modernization included the purchase of
100 B-1B bombers, hundreds of F-15 and F-16 jet fighters and
deployment of the MX missile and air-launched cruise missile.
Development also took place on the new B-2 stealth bomber, the new
AMRAAM air-to-air dogfighting missile and the C-17 cargo plane.
Following the January 1986 explosion of the space shuttle
Challenger, the Air Force restarted production lines for several
types of unmanned rocket boosters.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MANPOWER: The personnel levels have remained constant at about
2.1 million as have the number of admirals and generals.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   STRATEGIC DEFENSE INTIATIVE: Reagan created this program,
commonly known as Star Wars, to search for exotic weapons that could
be used to automatically shoot down Soviet nuclear missiles and
shield the United States and its allies. Although Congress routinely
cut Reagan's spending requests, the program will receive more than
$4 billion this year for research and development.

<HEAD>Antiviral Drug Effective Against Herpes, Researcher Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Studies at five medical centers have found that
acyclovir, an antiviral drug, can reduce or eliminate recurrent
outbreaks of genital herpes.
   Dr. David Baker, a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology at the
State University of New York, Stony Brook, said a double-blind study
involving 261 patients with active herpes infections showed
outbreaks of the disease were virtually eliminated for about half of
those taking acyclovir twice daily.
   ``These were all patients who before had had about one recurrence
of herpes a month'' and had been infected for more than a year,
Baker said Thursday in a telephone interview.
   Genital herpes is caused by a virus that generally is spread
through sexual contact in which one partner has open lesions of the
disease.

   President-elect Bush says he would not advocate
government action to curtail corporate takeovers but suggested a
review of tax laws might be needed to guard against abuses.
   ``I am not in favor of the government picking winners and
losers,'' Bush said at a news conference Thursday to announce his
final Cabinet choices.
   Asked whether he planned action to put the brakes on increasing
number of takeovers, many through so-called leveraged buyouts, Bush
said, ``You are talking to one who would as much as possible rely on
market forces.''
   But he added, that ``if there are abuses of our tax laws, ... the
whole tax law will be reviewed to see how they can be eliminated.''

   Officials from the nation's cities say drugs
and housing problems worsened in urban America last year, and the
shortage of affordable housing is the top hindrance to local
economic growth.
   The National League of Cities, releasing the findings Thursday of
its annual survey of local officials, criticized the Reagan
administration for major reductions in housing aid and for proposing
to end local assistance to fight drugs.
   The league, which represents large and small municipalities
across the country, surveyed 690 officials in 473 communities last
month.
   Two-thirds of the town officials reported local drug problems had
worsened in 1988, and crime was described as worsening by 45 percent.

   Arizona's governor, chief justice and House
speaker will ride to work together for a week as part of an effort
to reduce pollution.
   Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford offered Thursday to have her car
pick up Chief Justice Frank Gordon Jr., a fellow Democrat, and
Speaker Jane Hull, a Republican, beginning Monday in the
neighborhood where all three live.
   Gordon and Mrs. Hull agreed , although Mrs. Hull warned it might
be complicated if she and Mrs. Mofford wanted to have their hair
done on the same day.
   Organizers hope car pools, bus trips and bicycling can help
reduce a brown haze that hangs over Phoenix for much of the winter,
making it one of the country's worst cities for air pollution.
   State officials hope the voluntary measures will forestall
federal pollution penalties without the need for stricter auto
emissions laws.

   Actress Michelle Pfeiffer realizes people want to
know more about her now that she's starring in several major movies,
but that doesn't mean she likes it.
   ``I didn't become an actress so that my life could be exposed,''
Pfeiffer says in an interview in the February issue of Vanity Fair.
``It's really the only thing that makes me contemplate quitting
acting. I would give it up because I hate it that much.''
   In recent months, Pfeiffer has appeared in three major films _
``Dangerous Liaisons,'' ``Married to the Mob'' and ``Tequila
Sunrise.''
   Meanwhile, her estranged husband, Peter Horton, has gained
stardom on ABC-TV's ``thirtysomething.''
   ``I had a great marriage with a great man. They don't come much
better than that,'' she said.
   Why the breakup?
   ``It's very confusing,'' she said. ``We got married really young.
I think we grew up and our views changed.''

character on TV,'' he said, referring to Downey's on-air persona.
``Eighty-five percent of what you see is what he honestly believes

   The prince told guests at the exhibition his passion for Italy
could only be appreciated by drawing and observation, ``although it
is slightly difficult in my case to sit in the middle of Rome to try

   Charles' expressed preference for classical over much of modern
British architecture has upset some architects but won him the
admiration of many other people.

   If President Reagan decides to return to
sportscasting after leaving the White House, he shouldn't have much
trouble finding work.
   Two radio stations, perhaps more intent on publicity than beefing
up their staffs, said Thursday they had offered jobs to the outgoing
chief executive, whose early career included sportscasting in Des
Moines, Iowa.
   Sister stations KZLA-FM and KLAC-AM are offering Reagan a
$100,000, one-year contract to do a daily sports talk show from his
California home.
   No sooner had word of that offer hit the airwaves than oldies
station KRLA-AM topped it with a $200,000-a-year bid for a morning
sports commentary spot.
   ``This is absolutely a 100 percent bona fide offer,'' said Robert
Novak, marketing director for the twin stations, which play country
music and broadcast Los Angeles Lakers basketball and Los Angeles
Kings hockey.
   KRLA General Manager Bob Moore said he conveyed his offer in a
telegram to the White House Thursday.
   ``Seeing how Ron's an ex-sportscaster ... we thought this would
be a good use of his abilities,'' Moore said.
   Neither station got an immediate response.

   When he becomes president, George Bush will get a
new car with the options chief executives have come to expect: armor
plating and communications gear.
   The Secret Service on Thursday received a Ford Motor Co.
limousine, a 22-foot modified 1989 Lincoln Town Car that will first
be used in the inaugural parade Jan. 20.
   The black limo is 44.7 inches longer and 6.1 inches taller than a
conventional Town Car. Its chassis was redesigned and a 7.5-liter
engine was used primarily because of increased weight from the armor
plating and communications equipment.
   The car's weight was not revealed for security reasons, Ford
spokesman J.F. ter Horst said.

   The creator of the ABC hit comedy ``Roseanne''
says he was forced off the show by Roseanne Barr, the show's
sharp-tongued star.
   In a statement released late Wednesday, Matt Williams said Miss
Barr insisted he leave the program, and he ``reluctantly agreed.''
   Williams, one of three executive producers for the series, left
the show last week. The show's producers cited ``creative tensions.''
   ``Days after completion of the 13th episode, Roseanne Barr
informed the executive producers that she refused to continue in the
series as long as Matt Williams was there,'' Williams said. ``In
order to permit the production of the remaining nine episodes
ordered for this season, Matt Williams reluctantly agreed to leave
the show he created and developed.''
   ``Roseanne,'' which stars Miss Barr as a housewife and mother who
works at a factory, has beaten NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' for the No.
1 spot in the Nielsen ratings in two of the last three weeks.
   A spokeswoman for the show said no immediate response to
Williams' statement was planned.

   A Korean-American businessman was arrested
Thursday in an alleged international conspiracy to buy nerve-gas
bombs for export from the United States, possibly to Iran, officials
said.
   Juwhan Yun, 48, of Short Hills, was accused in a federal
complaint of conspiring to violate the Arms Export Control Act by
seeking to ship the gas sarin, which attacks the central nervous
system causing convulsions and death.
   ``It was a wide-ranging, trans-Atlantic conspiracy,'' said First
Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoff.
   The arrest came the same day the West German government reversed
itself and said it suspected that West German companies helped build
a Libyan plant that the United States believes is for manufacturing
chemical weapons.
   The turnaround followed the arrest Wednesday night of a Belgian
shipper tied to the case and confirmation by Libya that West German
firms aided the project. Libya says the plant is for producing
medicine.
   In the New Jersey case, Chertoff added that at one point in the
dealings with Yun, the purported destination was Iran but that this
had not been verified.
   Yun negotiated with an undercover customs agent posing as an arms
dealer to buy 500 quarter-ton bombs that use sarin, said Richard
Mercier, special agent in charge of the U.S. Customs Service's
office in Newark.
   Mercier described the gas as a ``very rapid, odorless, colorless
poison which can enter the body by inhalation, absorption or
injection.''
   Yun was arrested after his wife dropped him off at Customs
offices in Newark, where Yun believed he was to meet the undercover
arms dealer, Mercier said.
   If convicted, Yun faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000
fine. He was ordered held without bail by U.S. Magistrate Ronald
Hedges pending a hearing Tuesday.
   Yun told the court his Short Hills home was worth $650,000 and
that he also owns a $400,000 New York City condominium. He said he
has three children and has been in the United States for 17 years.
   According to the federal complaint filed in U.S. District Court
in Newark, a seven-month investigation began when an arms procurer,
a confidential informant, told Customs that Komex International
Corp. of Summit had contacted the informant about buying ammunition
for export to South Korea.
   Yun is identified as president of Komex, which sought information
on the purchase of 105mm and 106mm ammunition, the complaint said.
Chertoff said Komex is an import-export concern that had engaged in
legitimate arms dealings.
   On June 27, an undercover agent contacted Yun and said he could
provide information about the ammunition.
   Court papers said the agent taped a July 6 conversation with Yun
in which Yun said that four years ago Iran asked South Korea to
deliver 400 TOW missiles, electronically guided missiles designed
mainly as anti-armor weapons. The agent said that he had 20 TOW II
missiles ready for sale. Two weeks later, the agent told Yun he had
500 TOW II missiles available, and Yun said he would make inquiries
to find ``some right people'' at the ``right price,'' the complaint
said. Authorities said the deal was never completed.
   The complaint also alleged that Yun asked the undercover agent if
he could supply Stinger missiles to the same destination as the
TOW's. ``This is believed to be Iran,'' the complaint said.
   Stingers are portable anti-aircraft missiles. The suspects
allegedly also discussed importing Varian tubes, which are power
tubes used in military radar systems, the complaint said.
   Cooperating in the investigation were the U.S. Department of
Defense, the Army and Navy, and French and British customs officials.
   British officials were involved because according to the
complaint on Nov. 27 Yun phoned a Briton, Charles Caplan, who
operates Domino Associates of London. Caplan asked Yun if he could
obtain 200 to 500 bombs of sarin, the complaint said, and three days
later Yun asked the undercover agent if he could obtain the sarin.
   Yun was communicating throughout the alleged negotiations with
K.Y. Joo, president of Kwang Jin Trading Co. in Seoul, the complaint
said. French officials entered the investigation when Yun discussed
the deal via facsimile with Joo, who was staying in a hotel in
France.
   Yun and Caplan discussed in other fascimile messages during
December the purchase of a minimum of 500 sarin bombs for $12,000
each.
   Authorities said Yun met with Caplan and two other people in a
London hotel earlier this month. The identities of the others, who
are described in the federal complaint as co-conspirators, were not
released. Caplan also was charged in the complaint, and Chertoff
said officials were discussing whether to extradite him.
   The London Daily Telegraph reported in March that a Charles
Caplan served nine months in prison for plotting to supply gun
silencers to a government official in Libya through a company known
as Domino Avionics.
   Efforts to reach officials at Komex were unsuccessful. A man who
answered the telephone at the company's offices declined comment and
hung up.
   Messages were left on a telephone answering machine at Domino
Associates Holdings Ltd. Defence Suppliers' offices in London. They
were not immediately returned.
   Last month, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that U.S.
Customs officials were investigating an alleged scheme to ship
thiodiglycol, a chemical precursor of mustard gas, from the United
States to Iran via Singapore and Pakistan.
   Customs officials filed documents in U.S. District Court in St.
Louis requesting a search warrant for records between Alcolac
International Inc., a Baltimore company that manufactured the
chemical, and two companies in West Germany and Singapore.

   An all-expenses-paid vacation to ...
Lexington?!?
   ``The heart of thoroughbred country,'' the announcer for the TV
game show ``Jeopardy'' intoned in revealing the weeklong vacation
won by Charlie Schwartz, 38, of Venice, Calif.
   ``I was surprised, obviously,'' said Schwartz, a demographer for
a Los Angeles bank who won the $3,500 trip Friday. ``Why Lexington,
Kentucky?''
   Why not? game show officials say.
   Traditional vacation spots such as New York, San Francisco and
Florida are mixed with more unusual destinations to ``promote
awareness across the country,'' said Rocky Schmidt, a spokesman for
the show.
   Although Schwartz drove through Lexington 25 years ago, he
remembers very little about it. Schwartz said he probably would
visit Lexington with his wife and 9-month old son in late April.
   Schmidt said ``Jeopardy'' contestants two other times have won
trips to Lexington.
   Trips usually go to second-place contestants, Schmidt said. The
first-place winner Friday received $12,800 cash, and the third-place
winner got a sofa.

   They held an election and no voters
came.
   The two people who requested the referendum held Wednesday never
arrived, as planned.
   Charles and Patricia Schunk live on property within a 200-acre
parcel annexed in December to the neighboring city of Eau Claire. An
annexation can be vetoed by residents of the property, and that's
what the Schunks did by not voting.
   Polls at Hallie town hall opened at 9 a.m. and stayed open for 11
hours on the referendum question of whether the land ought to remain
attached to Eau Claire.
   The Schunks are the only residents of the tract. Town Attorney
David Raihle declared the election outcome a 0-0 tie. Under state
law, the tie nullified the annexation, Raihle said.
   In an ordinary election, Hallie is a suburb of 4,500 eligible
voters. The 200-acre parcel includes vacant lots, a few businesses
and the Hallie Golf Course.
   The nullification of the annexation through the non-vote saves
the town from taking Eau Claire to court, Raihle said, because some
non-resident property owners would have insisted on suing.
   The referendum cost the town about $125, said Town Clerk Shirley
Sippel.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rose Friday against the Japanese
yen, while share prices also gained on the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
with the market's key barometer setting a record high.
   The dollar finished at 126.65 yen, up 0.53 yen from Thursday's
close of 126.12 yen. The U.S. unit opened higher at 126.70 yen, up
0.58 yen from the previous day, and moved within a range of 126.45
yen to 127.08 yen.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which closed Thursday unchanged from Wednesday's
31,143.45-point record high close, added 154.93 points, or 0.5
percent, to close the day's trading at 31,298.38 points, a record
high for the market's key index.
   The dollar dipped briefly on a report from Washington that a West
German official had said he did not expect the U.S. to raise its
discount rate in the near future.
   Tokyo's higher opening followed overnight gains on overseas
markets, dealers said.
   Traders predicted currency trading would be thin throughout the
day ahead of a three-day weekend and the release of U.S. trade
figures on Wednesday.
   Japan's markets and most businesses will be closed Monday for an
extra day off due to a national holiday that falls on Sunday.
   Friday morning's trading was dominated by investors adjusting
their positions ahead of the weekend and the dollar was trading in a
narrow range, said Minori Takeuchi of Chemical Bank.
   In the stock market, early trading was led by individual and
foreign investors, but as the session advanced, participation
widened to include Japanese institutional investors.
   Trading was moderately active.
   Investors have not reacted with alarm to the market's rapid
advance this week. The Nikkei has added more than 900 points during
the week and climbed above the 31,000-point mark for the first time.

   A new Jackson ranks among the artists nominated
for a Grammy _ and he's unrelated to Janet and Michael.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, fiery orator and Democratic candidate for
president in 1988, is nominated for a speech recorded on a gospel
album by Aretha Franklin, ``One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism.''
   In the speech, delivered at Detroit's New Bethel Baptist Church,
Jackson pays tribute to Ms. Franklin's late father, the Rev. C.L.
Franklin.
   Ms. Franklin was nominated for best female soul gospel singer for
her work on the album.
   Jackson spokesman Frank Watkins said Jackson was unaware of the
nomination. He was expected to return to Chicago Thursday night
after a two-week trip to Africa and France.
   ``At one level certainly it's a surprise, but at another it's
not,'' Watkins said.``Anytime you're associated with Aretha Franklin
or Jesse Jackson you're quite likely to win an award. They're both
stellar talents in their fields _ Aretha as a singer and Jesse as an

   This seaside town plans to install special
toilets for dogs in an effort to keep its streets clean, a newspaper
reported.
   Dogs were banned last week from Imperia's historic center, but
that prohibition was lifted two days ago after a protest by animal
rights groups.
   La Repubblica newspaper reported Thursday that the city plans to
install toilets _ described as self-cleaning cylindrical structures
about five feet wide, filled with sand and containing deodorants and
``attractive substances'' _ to induce a dog to use it and not the
sidewalk.
   The newspaper quoted one resident as grumbling, ``There aren't
enough public toilets for humans, but they want to build them for
dogs.''
   The city, on the northwest coast near Monte Carlo, also said it
would provide free plastic bags to dog owners to clean up after
their pets.

<HEAD>Blacks Not Getting Proper Medical Care, Research Shows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blacks aren't getting proper medical care because
they lack insurance, have poor health coverage or have been
disappointed by doctors, studies published today indicate.
   The studies also show that blacks are included in fewer tests of
new drugs and, in at least one state, tend to get less aggressive
treatment for heart disease.
   They were published in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association, a theme issue coinciding with the birthday Sunday of
slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
   According to a nationwide survey of 10,130 U.S. residents, one in
11 blacks said they didn't see a doctor for economic reasons in
1986, compared with one in 20 whites.
   Blacks were less likely to have health insurance, and those who
did were less likely to be covered by private insurance and more
likely to live in a state with limited Medicaid benefits, said
researchers led by Robert J. Blandon of the Harvard University
School of Public Health in Boston.
   Their report said 37.2 percent of blacks overall had not seen a
doctor in a year, compared with 31.7 percent of whites.
   The disparity was greater for people in poorer health, with 32.2
percent of blacks going a year without a doctor's care, compared
with 17.5 percent of whites, the researchers said.
   ``There continues to be a lack of parity in access to health
care, and a consequent excess of unmet medical needs for blacks
compared with whites,'' the authors said.
   Blacks were more likely than whites to live in one-adult
households, perhaps making it harder for them to get to a doctor,
the researchers said.
   ``Blacks were more likely than whites to report that during their
last visit, their physician did not inquire sufficiently about pain,
did not tell them how long it would take for prescribed medicine to
work, did not explain the seriousness of the illness or injury, and
did not discuss test or examination findings,'' the study said.
   This is true despite that blacks, on average, are in poorer
health than whites, and continue to have a death rate 1{ times
higher than whites of the same age as well as double the white
infant mortality rate, the researchers said.
   ``Medicine in some ways is no different than getting your car
repaired or deciding whether to spend the night in a particular
hotel,'' Howard E. Freeman, chairman of sociology at the University
of California at Los Angeles and a co-author of the study, said
Thursday. ``You're not inclined to do it if past experiences have
been negative. Our data suggest there's a greater proportion of
negative experiences for blacks and the poor in general than there
are for the more affluent among us.''
   A related study in the Journal found few blacks included in
trials of new drugs.
   A review of 50 medical studies published from 1984 through 1986
showed that blacks were included in fewer than two-thirds of the
tests, said researcher Craig K. Svensson of Wayne State University
in Detroit.
   Svensson said researchers, particularly those from companies that
are seeking government approval for new drugs, should include large
numbers of blacks in clinical trials to determine if the medications
have different effects, based on race.
   A third study in the Journal examined the treatment of
heart-disease patients in Massachusetts and found that whites had
more angiography procedures and heart bypass operations.
   In angiography, doctors take X-rays of the heart after injecting
dye into it, allowing them to determine the extent of blood vessel
blockage.
   The researchers, Drs. Mark B. Wenneker and Arnold M. Epstein of
the Harvard School of Public Health, were unable to say if their
findings were typical nationally, but added their study ``suggests
that substantial racial inequalities exist in the use of procedures
for patients hospitalized with coronary heart disease.''

   Kind-hearted thieves returned first-grader
Margaret Allen's prized Buffalo Bills flag and gave her some goodies
to boot.
   The 6-year-old girl had proudly displayed the deep blue Bills
flag inscribed with the words ``Happy New Year'' under the American
flag outside her family's home just north of Buffalo until last
weekend, when it disappeared.
   Whoever took it left a note in the family's mailbox promising to
return the flag after the Bills-Bengals American Football Conference
Championship game in Cincinnati.
   Margaret watched Sunday's game, which the Bills lost, on
television and thought she spotted the flag in the crowd.
   She waited and waited, but the flag didn't show up.
   After news reports about her loss, the family received a
mysterious phone call Wednesday evening.
   The caller instructed the family to look for the flag near a
telephone junction box outside their home, said Margaret's father,
Peter.
   The family found the flag, a case of beer, a thank-you note, a
bag and a second note that read, ``We waited till now to return the
flag for our own protection (we thought you'd be watching), but we
had all intentions of returning your flag. And this is for
Margaret.''
   Inside the bag, to Margaret's surprise and delight, was a game
program from Cincinnati, a shirt, a hat and several other souvenirs
from the playoff.
   ``I still don't know who took it,'' Allen said, ``but they
certainly have made my little girl happy. She really is kind of
speechless after all that's happened.''

<HEAD>Researchers Say New Treatment Reverses Bone Loss</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A substance dentists have long used to strengthen
teeth is a key part of a new treatment that appears to safely curb
spinal osteoporosis, a progressive bone disorder afflicting some 5
million Americans, researchers say.
   University of Texas Southwestern Medical School researchers on
Thursday announced results from a seven-year trial of the new
treatment.
   Doctors say spinal osteoporosis results from a gradual loss of
trabecular bone, found primarily in the spine. It most commonly
affects elderly women and results in shortened stature, curvature of
the back and a protruding abdomen that can cause back pain and
digestive discomfort.
   The treatment employs a slow-release form of sodium fluoride, a
compound used by dentists to strenghthen teeth which _ when given
with calcium citrate _ can reverse the effects of osteoporosis by
adding bone mass, said Dr. Charles Pak, mineral metabolism chief at
Southwestern Medical Center.
   Pak said fluoride has been available as an osteoporosis treatment
for decades but caused serious side effects, including corrosion of
the stomach lining, painful swelling of the joints and stress
fractures.
   ``These complications have precluded the long-range acceptance of
use of fluoride in the United States,'' said Pak. ``Our treatments
have been designed to overcome these problems.''
   In the new treatment, fluoride is encapsulated in a waxy pill
that allows it to bypass the stomach before much of the compound is
released. That helps alleviate gastrointestinal discomfort and
allows the fluoride to be absorbed slowly into the blood, at an
effective but not toxic rate, Pak said.
   Each year, an estimated 500,000 people suffer osteoporosis spine
fractures, and a third of women over age 65 will have spinal
fractures during their lives, the Southwestern researchers said.
   ``Treatments such as estrogen and calcium supplements, which are
directed at preventing bone loss, are useful in averting the
development of osteoporosis when they are applied early, such as
during the early postmenopausal period,'' said Pak. ``But they have
limited value in patients with established osteoporosis, who have
already sustained a substantial bone loss. Our treatment is directed
toward the latter group.''
   Pak said the treatment, which has been conducted on experimental
basis at 10 hospitals around the country, does not reverse spinal
curvature or other damage, but does increase bone mass and forestall
further breakage.
   He said it cannot be used by people who have sustained hip
fractures because of differences in the makeup of hip bones.
   Pak said he plans to apply to the federal Food and Drug
Administration in April for approval of the treatment. An FDA review
usually takes nine months to 2{ years, he said.
   The new drugs promise to increase the availability and usability
of osteoporosis treatments, said Dr. Lawrence Raisz, director of
endocrinology and metabolism at the University of Connecticut.
   ``Everybody is anxious to have a treatment approved by the FDA,''
Raisz said.
   The new drugs were developed by Pak and a team of researchers
with the help of the Mission Pharmacal Co. of San Antonio.
   Since 1982, the group has tested the treatment on 251 patients in
Dallas, Fort Worth, Temple and Tyler, Texas; Charleston, S.C.;
Cleveland and Indianapolis.
   Less than 5 percent of patients at Southwestern experienced
gastrointestinal problems when treated with fluoride for an average
of 3.5 years, and about 6 percent complained of joint pain.
   Pak said findings were similar at the other hospitals. Patients'
spinal bone mass gained 3 percent to 6 percent each year.
   The studies were sponsored by Southwestern, the General Clinical
Research Center there funded by the National Institutes of Health,
and the National Institute for Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin
Diseases.

   Mexican and U.S. officials are investigating
the origin of a cache of Uzi submachine guns and ammunition
uncovered in the home of an oil union boss charged with the murder
of a federal agent.
   The oil boss, Joaquin Hernandez Galicia, said the former mayor of
Reynosa, across the border from McAllen, Texas, arranged the arms
shipment. The ex-mayor is believed to have fled with his family to
the United States, according to a highly-placed source in the
Attorney General's Office.
   Authorities said 200 submachine guns smuggled in from the United
States were found in the home of Hernandez Galicia when he was
arrested Tuesday after a shootout with police in Ciudad Madero,
about 220 miles northeast of Mexico City.
   Soldiers blew down the door of his home with a bazooka and a
federal agent was shot to death in the ensuing gunbattle.
   Hernandez Galicia, among two bodyguards and 48 other jailed
associates, was charged Thursday with homicide, weapons possession,
importing prohibited weapons and resisting arrest. He faces 40 years
in prison if convicted.
   His associates are to be charged with fraud, weapons possession
and tax evasion, judicial authorities say.
   Hernandez Galicia, 66, told investigators that former Reynosa
Mayor Jose Cruz Contreras secretly delivered the Uzis and about
30,000 cartridges on Dec. 10, according to a statement from the
Attorney General's Office.
   The source in the Attorney General's Office said Mexican
authorities and FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration officials
met Thursday to try to determine where the arms originated.
   In a Mexico City prison Thursday, Hernandez Galicia said, ``They
told me my family was kidnapped and if I didn't give a statement
that pleased the Federal Attorney General, I wouldn't see them
again.''
   He told reporters his detention was ``a dirty, prefabricated
infamy.''
   Several thousand oil workers and supporters demonstrated for his
release Thursday night in Mexico City's main plaza.
   According to the statement, Hernandez Galicia told investigators
Cruz Contreras was accompanied during the arms transaction by Juan
Abrego, the police chief of Hidalgo, Texas. The statement did not
elaborate.
   The Texas town's mayor, Edward Vela, said Thursday that the
allegations were under investigation.
   Attempts to reach Abrego by telephone were unsuccessful. But
Abrego was quoted Thursday by the official Excelsior news agency as
saying he had ``nothing to do'' with any arms shipment to Hernandez
Galicia.
   ``On various occasions I went to his house in Ciudad Madero,
accompanied by Contreras, but I never brought him arms,'' Abrego was
quoted as saying.
   Vela said he talked with his police chief and that Abrego would
continue as head of the 13-member police force.
   ``If and when anything is proven, we will take the appropriate
action,'' Vela said, adding that he was a friend of the former
Reynosa mayor. ``I find it hard to believe Cruz Contreras is
involved. He's a businessman and does a lot of work with the poor
and disadvantaged.''
   Hidalgo, with about 3,000 residents, is across the Rio Grande
from Reynosa. Reynosa, with one of Mexico's nine refineries, is a
stronghold of oil workers allied with Hernandez Galicia.
   A bomb threat and rumors of more arrests forced union local
chiefs to evacuate the union's national headquarters before they
could vote to choose a new secretary-general.
   The new leader of the 200,000-member union, Sen. Ricardo Camero
Cardiel, pledged to use ``all legal means to win the freedom of
Hernandez'' and other arrested leaders,'' the daily newspaper La
Jornada said.
   Camero Cardiel replaced Salvador Barragan Camacho. Barragan
Camacho, who has a history of heart trouble, is under arrest in a
hospital.
   Judicial police showed reporters jewelry valued at more than $1.3
million they said was found inside the trunk of Barragan Camacho's
car.
   The Oil Workers Union, like most of the labor movement, is
closely tied to the government. But Hernandez Galicia has a
longstanding feud with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.

<HEAD>Dollar Up Against Yen, Stocks Hit Another Record High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rose today in Tokyo against the
Japanese yen, while stock prices closed at another record high.
   The dollar finished the week at 126.65 yen, up 0.53 yen from
Thursday's close of 126.12 yen. The U.S. currency opened the day
higher at 126.70 yen and moved within a range of 126.45 yen to
127.08 yen.
   Dealers said the dollar dipped briefly on a report from
Washington that a West German official said he didn't expect the
United States to raise its official discount rate in the near future.
   The dollar's higher opening in Tokyo followed overnight gains on
overseas markets, dealers said. In New York, the dollar closed at
126.38 yen after rising 0.50 yen.
   Trading in Tokyo was dominated by investors adjusting their
positions ahead of the weekend, Minori Takeuchi of Chemical Bank
said.
   Japan's markets and most businesses will be closed Monday because
of a national holiday that falls on Sunday.
   Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita today said stable exchange
rates were necessary for orderly growth of the world economy, Kyodo
News Service reported. If currency rates fluctuate wildly, Japan's
central bank will ``take necessary steps to stabilize the market,''
it quoted him as saying.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which closed Thursday unchanged from Wednesday's
31,143.45-point record high finish, added 154.93 points, or 0.5
percent, closing at 31,298.38, another record high.
   Today's bullish market was due in part to boosted confidence on
the part of individual investors who had stayed on the sidelines
during the months before Emperor Hirohito's death on Saturday, said
Michio Katsumata of Nomura Securities.
   January is traditionally a busy month in the market for foreign
institutional investors, who returned to the market after receiving
their business results at the end of December, Katsumata added.

<HEAD>Dribble Diplomacy: Israelis Down Soviets In Basketball</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Dribble diplomacy is alive and well as the Israelis
topped the Soviet Army team in a basketball contest that had more
significance off court.
   While China had its spell of ping-pong diplomacy in the 1970s
when it decided to warm up to the West, the Jewish state and the
Soviet Union now seem to be improving relations.
   At the army sports complex on Moscow's west side, Maccabi of Tel
Aviv held on to beat the Soviet Army 97-92, to the joyful shouts of
hundreds of Soviet Jews who had the rare opportunity to wave an
Israeli flag and proclaim their ancient heritage.
   In Israel, it was estimated that more than 2 million of the 4.2
million people followed the game in the first live broadcast from
Moscow. Maccabi held a 71-51 lead with 12 minutes to play but the
Soviet team stormed back to within 93-89 on the play of guard
Vladimir Gorin and forward Sergei Tarakanov.
   Rush-hour traffic in major Israeli cities was cut to a trickle as
people sped home early to watch the game. Israelis gathered in
pizzerias and cafes to watch. Jerusalem's central Mahane Yehuda
market closed three hours early.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, not known as a sports
buff, viewed the game on a small portable TV set in his office.
   After Ken Barlow, one of four native American players on the
Israeli team, wrapped up the game for Maccabi with a short jump shot
as the clock wound down, fans rushed into the streets in Israel,
shouting ``We won, we won!'' Bus and taxi drivers honked their horns.
   Inside the stadium, Soviet Jews hugged and kissed each other.
   ``This is joy, this is happiness,'' crowed Merab
Detrokalashuvili, a 38-year-old Jew from the Soviet Georgian
republic. ``The Jewish nation is one nation.''
   On the court, the pace had been hectic but with nary an incident,
Maccabi captain Doron Jamshi and coach Zvi Sherf said. Nor was any
disturbance reported in the stands or outside.
   ``Relations are very good,'' a pleased Jamshi said. ``It's like a
little war. We won the war and go home happy.''
   The team's appearance in Moscow for a European Championship Cup
game was the first by an Israeli team in 15 years.
   The Soviet team will go to Israel for a rematch in March.
   It was the first Soviet appearance by an Israeli basketball team
since Israeli participants in the University Games were jeered as
they walked into Lenin Stadium in August 1973.
   The Kremlin severed diplomatic relations with Israel following
the 1967 Mideast War and it has been only in recent years, under
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, that Soviet-Israeli relations have
shown signs of improving.
   The visit of Soviet musicians, a leading poet and ordinary Soviet
tourists to Israel have helped. Cultural visits are particularly
popular, not leastly because Israel has 250,000 immigrants from the
Soviet Union.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of Israel said the drawing closer of
the two nations is motivated by Soviet desire to play a role in any
Mideast peace settlement and the need to convince Israel such a role
can be constructive.
   But for basketball-crazy Israel and for Soviet Jews chanting
``Maccabi, Maccabi!'' in the stadium and waving blue-and-white
banners bearing the Star of David, the game was a joy just in itself.
   Especially that final score, 97-92.
   The U.S.-born players on the Israeli team were Willie Sims, who
has played for Maccabi three years. He first came to Israel to play
briefly in 1977, then returned in 1981. He played at Louisiana State
University.
   Barlow has played for Maccabi for two years after a collegiate
career at Notre Dame.
   Kevin Magee played at UC-Irvine and came to Israel in 1984 to
play for Maccabi.
   Lavon Mercer has been with Maccabi one year, and before that he
played seven years with Hapoel Tel Aviv. He played at Georgia State
University.

<HEAD>Coup Possibility Talks Spread In Insurgence-Plagued Peru</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas killed five policemen in an
attack northeast of Lima, bringing to 41 the number of people killed
since Saturday in the intensified insurgency, the government said.
   The attack by the Maoist Shining Path occurred Wednesday near
Huaraz, 190 miles to the northeast, the government said Thursday. It
did not elaborate.
   The U.S. Embassy said Thursday that the guerrillas likely
sabotaged a train and caused a crash in the Andes Mountains that
killed a New Jersey mayor's wife.
   Anna Cucci was killed and her husband, Jersey City Mayor Anthony
Cucci, was injured Dec. 1 when the rail car they rode derailed and
tumbled down a ravine near Cuzco, 350 miles southeast of Lima.
   The announcements came the same day as Prime Minister Armando
Villanueva and the army commander, Gen. Artemio Palomino, moved to
dispel speculation that the military might take over the government.
   President Alan Garcia is widely blamed for mismanaging Peru's
fragile economy and causing a severe recession, marked by record
high inflation last year of 1,722 percent, and for failing to curb
the 8-year guerrilla insurgency.
   ``The nation and the armed forces are united. There is no danger
of a military coup,'' Villanueva said Thursday. Palomino said talk
of a coup was without credibility.
   Vice President Luis Alberto Sanchez and former President Fernando
Belaunde also issued statements in recent days denying a coup was
afoot and appealing for calm.
   Nearly all political parties have demanded Garcia resign or make
drastic changes in his center-left government.
   In another development Thursday, Soviet spokesman Oleg Tkachev
said the Soviets would respect a ban against its ships fishing off
Peru.
   Last week, a Peruvian judge issued a restraining order
indefinitely suspending a three-year Soviet-Peruvian accord, which
permits 20 Soviet trawlers to annually catch 400,000 tons of mainly
mackerel and Pacific hake inside Peru's 200-mile limit.
   Fishermen argued that the contract provided unjust profits to the
Soviets.
   The government responded by soliciting another court order
barring 50 Peruvian fishing boats from leaving their home port of
Paita, 600 miles north of Lima, until the contract dispute is
resolved.
   The Lima daily El Comercio said nearly all of Paita's fishing
boats, which supply more than half of the fish consumed
domestically, began a sympathy strike Tuesday.
   Fishing is one of Peru's most important industries and more than
4 million tons of fish are caught yearly. Peru exports nearly $300
million worth of fishmeal annually, the Ministry of Fishing said.

<HEAD>Signs Of Homeless Students Prompt School-Based Shelters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF AWALT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 12-year-old girl who had been sleeping under an
abandoned house was the first to seek shelter at a public school in
a new program that offers homeless students a refuge from the chilly
streets.
   ``Right now she's playing checkers with one of the
administrators,'' said school board President Melody Ellis. ``We
just tried to give her encouragement and let her play.''
   Public school officials opened shelters at two schools Thursday
night to provide needy students with beds, showers and hot meals.
   The 12-year old, who was not identified, was the only one of
eight children who stayed at the shelters on the first night who met
the guidelines for the Schoolhouse Shelters program, officials said.
A mother brought five children to a shelter, and two teen-agers who
sought refuge gave names of schools outside Houston.
   ``If only one child shows up, the program's working because
that's one child that's not on the streets,'' says area schools
Superintendent Kaye Stripling.
   ``I'm not disappointed,'' Ms. Ellis said. ``It's going to take
some time for the children to build up a trust factor with us, and
you can imagine how frightened these poor little children are with
all this attention.''
   Four other boys who came to a shelter decided to leave because
they feared the attention they might draw, said officials who tried
unsuccessfully to discourage reporters from staking out the shelter.
   Officials in the Houston school district, Texas' largest with
about 190,000 students, set up the shelters after increasing reports
of students living on the streets. Houston has an estimated 20,000
to 25,000 homeless people, but it's uncertain how many are children.
   The program is based on the premise that students who feared
seeking help elsewhere might turn to a more familiar environment _
school.
   Under the program's guidelines, only students enrolled in Houston
schools are eligible to stay in the shelters, which are not meant
for families or children who should be served by other social
programs.
   One of the two schools is set up to handle children from
kindergarten through the eighth grade. The other is intended for
high school students.
   The Red Cross donated 75 cots and blankets, and area residents
volunteered to drive the streets in search of children needing
shelter. The cost to Houston schools, which provided food, space and
security officers, was described as minimal.
   The program will remain in effect at the two schools until at
least Jan. 20, when the superintendent will recommend to the school
board that it be continued or modified.
   Despite general support from social agencies, some officials have
doubts about how severe the problem is.
   Programs already exist for ``truly homeless'' children, said Judy
Hay of Harris County Children's Protective Services.
   But supporters of Schoolhouse Shelters disagreed, saying a cold
front that swept through Houston Thursday evening may help prove the
necessity of the program. Balmy afternoon temperatures dipped to a
windy 40 degrees by late evening.
   ``These children do not have homes,'' Ms. Ellis said. ``We have
incidences reported where children have left school and gone home to
find that there is nobody there anymore.''

<HEAD>Rightist Severs Finger To Protest Corruption</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A political scandal involving leading government
officials has prompted one irate citizen to protest by chopping off
part of a finger and mailing it to the prime minister, police said
today.
   A member of a rightist organization admitted severing the top of
his little finger on the right hand and sending it to Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita, along with a message protesting political
corruption, a police official said.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
47-year-old protester was a member of an extreme rightist group. But
he refused to identify him ``because the act was obviously aimed at
seeking publicity.''
   The protester included a return address on the package, the
official said.
   A package containing the finger was delivered to Takeshita's
official residence on Tuesday with a letter describing Japan's
leaders as ``dirty politicians'' involved in a stock-profiteering
scandal, the official said.
   Scores of politicians and business leaders were offered the
opportunity to buy unlisted stocks of Recruit Cosmos Co., a real
estate subsidiary, and then reaped hefty profits after public
trading began.
   The scandal has led to the resignation of two Cabinet ministers
and 16 others from the top echelons of the bureaucracy, business and
news media. A relative and aide to Takeshita also have been
implicated, but the prime minister maintains he was not personally
involved.
   The rightist was also quoted as saying in his protest message:
``I urge you to reflect gravely (on the situation) at the beginning
of a new era.''
   Emperor Hirohito died at age 87 on Saturday and his eldest son
Akihito immediately succeeded to the throne.
   Police said there were no plans to file charges against the
protester, a resident of the Saitama region near Tokyo and a member
of a right-wing group known as Kokuyukai, or ``concern for the
country group.''
   Japan's rightist groups often drive around cities in
military-style jeeps and trucks, blaring recorded marching songs and
anti-communist slogans.
   Many extreme rightists advocate revision of the pacifist
constitution to re-militarize Japan and restore the emperor to his
pre-World War II status as a living god.

<HEAD>OSHA Cites U.S. Military Academy For 156 Violations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Army officials knew or should have known
about health and safety hazards threatening civilian workers at the
U.S. Military Academy that prompted inspectors to cite 156
violations, a federal official says.
   Of the violations found by the U.S. Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, 107 were classified as ``serious,'' meaning
they held a ``substantial probability that death or serious injury
can result,'' John Tomich, OSHA's New York regional director, said
Thursday.
   Tomich said he was uncertain whether any serious injuries had
resulted from the violations, which included bare electrical wires,
a chlorine gas hazard and unsafe machines.
   The military also clearly knew about 30 additional problems but
failed to make a ``reasonable'' effort to rectify them, Tomich said.
   In some cases, academy officials had hoped to remove the hazards
but may have been hampered by budgetary restraints, Tomich said.
   ``A lot of the violations have to do with basic safety,'' said
Tomich, whose Albany office headed the investigation. ``For whatever
purpose ... the conditions were allowed to exist. We were surprised
at the number of violations and the severity of them.''
   West Point officials said the report, which was sent to the
academy this week, still had to be reviewed by the school's
superintendent, Lt. Gen. Dave Palmer, and they declined comment.
   OSHA's August 1988 probe was the first time the federal safety
enforcement agency had investigated West Point. The OSHA team was
dispatched after the academy's occupational accident rate rose above
the national average for the first time in 1988, Tomich said. The
national average was 2.79 accidents per 100 workers a year. Tomich
said it was 3.85 at West Point.
   Besides 3,800 civilian employees, 4,400 cadets and 1,600 military
personnel are at West Point, said academy spokeswoman Andrea
Hamburger.
   OSHA is only authorized to investigate civilian worksites. Tomich
said fewer than half of those were inspected at the academy, and the
sites chosen were considered ``high hazard'' areas.
   ``The thing that we were surprised at was the sheer numbers that
we had here,'' Tomich said. ``We had 80 or 90 pages of citations,
which is not your normal case. And that's not even going into the
entire facility wall to wall.''
   Among the violations found by OSHA:
   _At the cadet gym, the academy failed to properly separate tanks
of sodium hypochlorite and hydrochloric acid near the pool. The
combination of the two chemicals would create dangerous chlorine
gas, Tomich said, adding, ``The potential for them to mix was
there.''
   _Inadequate ventilation at the indoor rifle and pistol range
created a potentially dangerous exposure to lead particles from
bullets.
   _Many machines failed to have adequate safeguards against a
worker getting caught in the apparatus. Tomich said there was ``risk
of amputation.''
   _Numerous cases where electrical wiring was either exposed or
unsuitable. Tomich said employees risked coming in contact with live
wires and being electrocuted.
   _Elevated working platforms failed to have guardrails.
   _Many exits were padlocked, violating fire safety codes.
   Despite failing to address these problems, Tomich said he
detected no ``blatant disregard'' for civilian safety.
   In many cases, he said, Army officials ``basically just
transferred that information onto a notice of unsafe condition and
posted it in the area but never corrected it.''

<HEAD>Head Of Government Inquiry Into Aboriginal Deaths Resigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of a government probe on the
deaths of 104 aborigines in police custody has resigned, and
indigenous activists today called the decision a devastating blow to
the inquiry.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke said James Muirhead, federal court judge
since 1977, resigned late Thursday to become administrator of the
Northern Territory.
   Aboriginal groups called the decision a blow to their cause and
expressed concern that the inquiry, set up in 1987 to investigate 44
aboriginal deaths in police custody since 1980, could be downgraded.
   Since the inquiry began, the number of aboriginal deaths in
police custody has grown to 104, and Muirhead had said the increased
number would extend his work _ expected to be completed last month _
two years minimum.
   Aboriginal activists have charged police brutality as the cause.
   An interim report issued last month recommended aboriginal
recruits replace white police officers suspected of racism and that
drunkenness be abolished as a crime for aborigines.
   Most aborigines have died in police cells by hanging after being
picked up on charges of being drunk and disorderly.
   Hawke said Muirhead, who also was the judge in the Lindy
Chamberlain trial, would continue in his job until April. The
Chamberlain trial was the basis for the recent U.S. movie starring
Meryl Streep entitled ``A Cry in the Dark.''
   The Black Action Group and the Committee to Defend Black Rights,
which represents many of the families of aborigines who have died in
custody, urged the federal government ensure that justice is not
denied the country's indigenous population following Muirhead's
resignation.
   Aborigines, Australia's original inhabitants, number about
160,000, or 1 percent of the 16 million population. Government
figures statistics show aborigines are socially and economically
deprived.
   Aboriginal activists declared last year's Bicentennial marking
European settlement a year of mourning.
   Muirhead, 63, said aborigines should not fear the probe will wind
down.
   ``I think the commission is well established,'' he said.
   No replacement was immediately named.

<HEAD>U.S. Has Evidence Of German Involvement In Libyan Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. government has evidence implicating West
German companies in the construction of a Libyan chemical factory
and indicating that the plant began test production of poison gas,
according to news reports.
   Intelligence sources said a toxic spill occurred during an
attempt to make poison gas in August and led to frantic phone calls
to West German companies for clean-up help, NBC News reported
Thursday.
   Imhausen-Chemie, a chemical company whose officials have denied
any connection with the disputed plant, was one of those the Libyans
called for help, the TV network's news said.
   Officials, in confirming the NBC report to The New York Times,
said the evidence included extensive intercepts of telephone
conversations between the Libyans and their suppliers.
   The United States has charged that the plant at Rabta, about 35
miles southwest of the Libyan capital of Tripoli, is a chemical
weapons factory. Libya has denied the accusation, saying the plant
is designed to produce drugs.
   NBC said U.S. intelligence officials determined as early as
summer 1987 that Libya had obtained the chemical components of
poison gas.
   The United States was able to compile detailed evidence of the
Libyan operation through electronic eavesdropping, satellite
surveillance and the use of spies in Libya and Europe, NBC reported.
The information obtained included the names of companies in West
Germany and other countries which sold supplies, equipment and
expertise to the Libyans.
   Earlier this month, The Washington Post also reported that a
chemical spill occurred at the plant in August.
   The West German government had denied any German firms were
involved with the Libyan plant, but Chancellor Helmut Kohl announced
Thursday that authorities had seized documents that may show West
German companies helped build the plant.

   About 30 Canadians who manned Arctic
Circle naval convoys that supplied Soviet allies during World War II
have received awards from the Soviet Union.
   Igor Liakin-Frolov on Thursday pinned his country's Commemorative
Medal on the veterans, who served on some of the 900 ships that
sailed from Scotland for the Soviet port of Murmansk, on the Barents
Sea.
   ``The aid of these soldiers and merchants was very important,''
said Liakin-Frolov of the Soviet Embassy in Ottawa. ``It was not
decisive, but it was major, and the Soviet people are grateful.''
   The Murmansk Run continued until the spring of 1944, and one of
every five ships was sunk by the Germans, he said.
   ``It was very hard _ the cold, the darkness, and especially the
Germans,'' said Maurice Vaudry, who served aboard the Royal Canadian
Navy destroyer HMCS Le Huron. ``But we were young.''

<HEAD>Amnesty Report: Three Burmese Arrested After Forced Repatriation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Amnesty International charged that
Burmese military authorities arrested at least three Burmese
students shortly after Thailand forced them to return home.
   A 21-year-old student taken into military custody in a separate
case died two days after his release, apparently from harsh
treatment in detention, the London-based human rights organization
said.
   The statement, dated Thursday, was received by telex in Bangkok
today, a day after another Amnesty statement accused Thai military
authorities of forcibly repatriating 22 students who fled Burma
after a bloody military coup in September. Thai officials said they
returned voluntarily.
   In Tokyo, Japan today announced it would suspend a $7.4 million
grant to Burma because it is under military rule. Japan's Foreign
Ministry said it has not recognized Gen. Saw Maung, who seized power
after a bloody September coup, as Burma's legitimate leader.
   The latest Amnesty International statement said that according to
the Burmese state radio, two students repatriated Saturday, Sao Myo
Win Tun and Kyi Moe, were arrested shortly after their return and
taken into military custody for questioning.
   Amnesty previously said the two students had taken leading roles
in the August and September demonstrations for democracy in Shan
state.
   The statement said other reports indicated authorities arrested a
third student Saturday, Tu Ain Tin, who had become popular among
demonstrators for performing pro-democracy songs.
   The statement said Amnesty also was concerned that another
pro-democracy demonstrator, Zaw Win Tin of the Burmese capital of
Rangoon, reportedly died Dec. 30, ``less than 48 hours after he was
released from military custody.''
   ``He had been arrested several weeks earlier and had apparently
been held incommunicado without charge or trial since then,''
Amnesty said. ``He is said to have died from the effect of the
severe ill treatment he sustained while in prison.''
   Amnesty has reported many Burmese arrested for involvement in the
pro-democracy campaign have been held without charge or trial and
that some have been tortured or otherwise harshly treated.
   Students led last year's nationwide demonstrations for democracy
in Burma until Saw Maung took power Sept. 18. His troops cleared the
streets by killing hundreds of unarmed demonstrators.
   Thousands of students fled to Thai border areas controlled by
anti-government guerrillas, seeking refuge and in some cases,
military training. Thai officials have said about 7,000 remain at
the border.
   Thailand at first promised the students temporary asylum but then
army chief Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh broke an international
campaign to isolate Burma's government and reached an agreement with
Saw Maung to send the students home.
   Saw Maung's government promised no action against the students
and denied accusations of arrests and harsh treatment.
   Under the program, the students are brought to Tak in northern
Thailand and then flown to Rangoon aboard Burmese military aircraft.
   Seventy-six students returned Thursday, bringing to 260 the
number who have returned under the program, Thai officials said.

<TEXT>
   Californians were recovering today from 100-mile-an-hour Santa
Ana winds that wrought havoc with traffic and travelers, while much
of the South was getting out the umbrellas.
   Thousands of truckers, campers and air travelers were stranded in
Southern California Thursday when hurricane-force winds damaged
buildings, turned over big trucks, forced authorities to close many
roads and shut the Ontario International Airport for 10 hours.
   High-wind warnings were posted this morning for the mountains of
Southern California, as well as for the northern third of the
Pacific Coast, Montana and parts of New Mexico.
   In the South, rain was falling across the Virginias, the
Carolinas, Tennessee, northern Georgia, northern Alabama, northern
Mississippi, southeast Arkansas and northern Louisiana.
   Flash flood watches were posted in northern Louisiana, much of
Mississippi and northwest Alabama. Heavy rainfall was to make the
Cumberland River crest 3 to 4 feet above flood stage this morning
near Fourmile, Ky.
   Snow continued during the early morning in Michigan. Scattered
snow was falling in New York, western Kentucky, southeast New Mexico
and portions of Idaho.
   Today's forecast called for rain in the Rio Grande Valley of
Texas, the Carolinas, Georgia and northern Florida. Snow and
freezing rain was predicted over southwest Texas, southeast New
Mexico and southern Oklahoma.
   Snow showers were expected to be scattered over Maine.
   Sunny skies were forecast for the remainder of the nation.
   High temperatures were predicted in the teens over northern Maine
and northeast Minnesota; in the 20s and 30s for the remainder of New
England and New Jersey, the Ohio Valley, the Great Lakes, the upper
half of the Mississippi Valley, much of the Northern Plains, the
upper Missouri Valley, northwest Texas, the Oklahoma Panhandle and
the Rocky Mountains.
   Highs elsewhere were expected to be in the 40s, 50s, and 60s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 18
degrees below zero at Craig, Colo., to 89 degrees at Key West, Fla.

   Thousands of truckers and air travelers were
stranded and up to 100,000 residents lost power as Santa Ana winds
tore through Southern California at up to 100 mph, officials said.
   The winds closed Ontario International Airport for 10 hours
Thursday, shredded one of the world's largest blimps and damaged an
airliner there and toppled at least a dozen tractor-trailer rigs in
Ontario, said California Highway Patrol Sgt. Tim Joy.
   ``It's kind of an intense feeling,'' said trucker Bill Derringer,
who sat out the winds at an Ontario truck stop. ``You become kind of
a devout Catholic or whatever you are real quick.''
   The Santa Anas _ also called ``devil winds'' _ are spun off by
high pressure inland and pick up speed as they move from Southern
California's deserts through mountain passes and roar down on
adjacent communities.
   Winds subsided by nightfall Thursday as the high pressure system
that caused the howling gales moved to the east. The National
Weather Service predicted winds would gust up to 35 mph this morning
and be gone by tonight.
   As many as 100,000 Southern California Edison customers went
without power at times late Wednesday and Thursday as winds felled
lines.
   A fire started when hurricane-force winds downed a power line
charred about 160 acres of brush near Ramona, about 25 miles
northeast of San Diego, before it was contained Thursday. No
injuries or damage were reported.
   A whirlwind of dust obscured Ontario, about 40 miles east of Los
Angeles, where about 2,000 campers and truckers swilled coffee and
traded stories at truck stops.
   ``I don't think anybody moved for 12 to 14 hours,'' said Bob
Berenyi, manager of Truck Stops of America.
   In nearby Rancho Cucamonga, winds tore part of the roof off the
San Bernardino County sheriff's station, said Deputy Denise Garland.
Outside, deputies donned goggles to direct traffic.
   A half-dozen trucks huddled under an overpass near Glen Avon to
avoid winds that toppled two rigs just a few yards away. No serious
injuries were reported.
   At least 45 flights were diverted from Ontario International
Airport or canceled, stranding thousands of travelers.
   ``People are just sitting there numb. Some of the business
travelers are pretty upset, but the majority are resigned to the
fact they aren't going anywhere right away,'' said airport Manager
Michael DiGirolamo.
   About all that was left intact of a 194-foot-long Airships Inc.
blimp, used by Pepsi Cola Co. to promote its Slice brand, was the
nose cone attached at an anchor pole and the gondola, said Capt.
Jerry Davis, airport security chief.
   The blimp, valued at $6 million, is one of the Starship series,
the largest blimps in the world. It was to have flown over the Super
Bowl in Miami, Fla. Jan. 22, but now will require six weeks of
repair.
   A United Parcel Service cargo bin blew into a Southwest Airlines
Boeing 737, putting a six-inch gash in the fuselage near the
cockpit, said Ron Kochevar, assistant airport manager.

<DATELINE>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today offered $217,000,
one of the largest bounties in Australian history, to help solve the
killing of its No. 3-ranking law enforcement officer.
   Justice Minister Michael Tate announced the reward after
Assistant Federal Police Commissioner Colin Winchester was shot
twice in the head in his driveway in Canberra, the federal capital.
   Tate has suggested Tuesday's murder might have been a warning to
witnesses in upcoming drug trials that Winchester was known to be
investigating.
   ``It may be an intimidation tactic to say that if we can kill a
man of this seniority, no witness is safe,'' he told a news
conference. ``All Australians have found this killing shocking, and
would want no resources spared in the hunt for the murderer.''
   Winchester, 55, was buried today will full police honors in
Canberra.
   Tate said the reward was for information leading to an arrest for
the killing. He said any witness would be granted indemnity from
prosecution relating to the crime.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher On West German Comments, Gold Off Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rose in European trading this
morning as the market continued to react positively to comments in
Washington by West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg,
dealers said.
   The stronger dollar depressed gold prices slightly.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar surged in Asian dealings
and continued to rise in Europe in response to Stoltenberg saying he
would like to see the dollar remain at around 1.80 West German marks.
   Dealers in Frankfurt and Milan said the market's rally was being
curbed by fears of central bank intervention.
   A trader with the Milan branch of a major U.S. commercial bank
expressed surprise at the strength of the dollar's rally so far this
year, spurred mainly by high U.S. interest rates.
   ``Let's not forget that the dollar has risen without the benefit
of a long-expected hike in the U.S. discount rate,'' she said. The
discount rate is the interest rate charged by the Federal Reserve on
loans to commercial banks.
   But another trader in Milan said the primary motive behind the
dollar's rally is speculation.
   ``The U.S. still has a big trade deficit and says it wants a
lower dollar. The west Germans have a huge trade surplus and want a
stronger mark. But the dollar surges and the mark falls,'' he said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.53 yen to a closing 126.65 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted higher at 126.75 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Thursday:
   _1.8375 West German marks, up from 1.8355
   _1.5680 Swiss francs, up from 1.5510
   _6.2705 French francs, up from 6.2150
   _2.0743 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0590
   _1,350.50 Italian lire, up from 1,339.50
   _1.2000 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1957
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.7730, compared with
$1.7880 late Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $403.50 a troy ounce and
at midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed the same
recommended price. It was down from $404.50 bid late Thursday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $403.25, down from $404.20 bid late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.18 to close at a bid $405.18.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $5.90 a troy
ounce, down from Thursday's $5.95.

<HEAD>Man Once Convicted of Murder Released On Forged Bail Papers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An accused killer whose $100,000 bail was revoked
last year after he allegedly threatened a witness was allowed to
leave jail based on forged court papers that showed a new bail of
$10,000, officials said.
   George Suarez, 35, whose 1983 conviction in the murder of an
elderly pharmacist and a customer at a Brooklyn drugstore was
overturned on a technicality, left Rikers Island jail Dec. 17, but
officials only found out Thursday when he failed to appear in court
for his retrial, said Ruby Ryles, a Correction Department
spokeswoman.
   She said a woman, whose name was not released, had paid the
$10,000 bail in cash.
   Suarez' lawyer, Harold Weiswasser, said he learned of the escape
when he walked into Brooklyn state Supreme Court Thursday and
Justice Ronald Aiello asked him where his client was.
   ``I thought the judge was kidding me,'' he said.
   Authorities then discovered that legal papers had been doctored
to show that Suarez's status had been changed from no bail to
$10,000 bail, said Ryles.
   ``I was shocked and the clerk was quite upset because it was his
signature that had been forged,'' said Weiswasser.
   Suarez and two co-defendants were convicted of second-degree
murder in the Dec. 12, 1982 shooting deaths of Milton Scher, 73, and
34-year-old Rose DeGennaro.
   Suarez and the other two were sentenced to prison, with Suarez
getting 50 years to life. He was released on $100,000 bail, however,
after his conviction was overturned on a technicality in December
1987, Ryles said.
   Suarez was sent back to jail and his bail was revoked last
September after a witness in the case reported being threatened,
according to a spokesman for the Brooklyn district attorney's office.
   Police have warned the female witness that Suarez has escaped.
   Correction officials also were trying to determine how Suarez's
papers had been changed and to find the woman who bailed him out,
Ryles said.

   Czechoslovakia and Britain will
propose an international convention to control exports of plastic
explosives, Czechoslovakia's ambassador to West Germany was quoted
as saying today.
   Semtex, a Czechoslovak-made plastic explosive, is believed to
have been used in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which blew up
over Scotland Dec. 21, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the
ground.
   Czechoslovak experts have traveled to Britain to help in crash
investigation.
   Ambassador Dusan Spacil, in an interview with the Cologne-Bonn
Rundschau newspaper, was quoted as saying his country's rigorous
controls prevented exports of Semtex.
   Worldwide exports of plastic explosives should be regulated by an
international convention, and Czechoslovakia and Britain plan to
present such a proposal to the United Nations, Spacil was quoted as
saying.
   ``Producers of such explosives should be obliged to make an
annual report to the United Nations on the deliveries and the
recipients (of plastic explosives),'' the ambassador was quoted as
saying.

<TEXT>
   The non-aligned movement today recognized
an official as representing the PLO's declared state of Palestine at
the opening of a conference called to modernize the 101-member
organization.
   The head of the political department of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, Farouk Kadoumi, received a warm welcome. Foreign
Minister George Iacovou of Cyprus descended from the podium to hug
him.
   Kadoumi, considered the PLO's foreign minister, told the meeting
of foreign ministers the non-aligned movement cannot lose sight of
its goal of ``ending colonialism.''
   It was the first such high-level meeting of the non-aligned
movement since the Palestine National Council declared an
independent Palestinian state in November.
   About 90 countries, most from the non-aligned movement, have
recognized Palestine, and Kadoumi thanked them for their support. He
expressed ``gratitude for the role of the non-aligned movement in
strengthening the militancy of our Palestine people'' in trying to
establish a state in territory occupied by Israel.
   Foreign Minister Nathan Shamuyaria of Zimbabwe read a message
from President Robert Mugabe, the head of the non-aligned movement,
calling for a permanent headquarters for the organization.
   Iacovou, in his opening address, said the conference was designed
to ``make suggestions as to how the movement will become more
effective and more dynamic.''
   At the foreign ministers' conference held in Nicosia in
September, delegates complained the organization was bloated,
churning out endless documents that nobody read and adopting
resolutions nobody followed.
   The conference on updating the movement emerged from those
complaints.
   Foreign Minister Narasimha Rao of India said the movement ``is at
a crossroads. One road leads to irrelevance, the other to the role
it has played in contributing new ideas to international problems.''
   The non-aligned movement, founded in 1961, initially was designed
to represent countries that did not want to choose sides in the
U.S.-Soviet superpower rivalry.

   Two teen-agers were in serious condition and
40 other children and three adults were injured after a school bus
driven by a man with a suspended sentence collided with a coal
truck, officials said.
   Bus driver Enoch Smith, 33, had his license suspended for failing
to report to traffic school after receiving a speeding ticket Aug.
25, Patrolman Paul Shackelford said. Smith had paid a fine for the
ticket, the patrolman said.
   Police cited Smith for driving with a suspended license, a
misdemeanor, at a hospital where he was treated and released for
minor injuries. A court date wasn't set.
   The accident occurred at a rain-drenched intersection at the
entrance of North Laurel Junior High School Thursday afternoon, said
Capt. Gene Hollon of the Laurel County Sheriff's Department.
   Truck driver John B. Massey, 28, who suffered cuts and bruises,
attempted to swerve to avoid the bus as it crossed the intersection
in his path, but he jackknifed and hit the bus at an angle,
Shackelford said.
   Shackelford said the truck was empty. ``If the truck had been
loaded, it would have cut the bus in two,'' he said.
   Witnesses said the bus might not have come to a complete stop at
the intersection, where it faced a stop sign and a flashing red
light, but police had not confirmed the reports, Shackleford said.
   ``There was a tremendous amount of screaming and crying,'' said
Hollon, who arrived moments after the crash. ``Some of the students
were pinned in together. I saw one instance where one of the
students was trying to help the other, even though they both were
pinned in.''
   Two 13-year-old boys, Robert Watts and John Detherage, were in
serious and stable condition today at University of Kentucky Medical
Center in Lexington, spokeswoman Mary Margaret Colliver said.
   Watts suffered abdominal and other injuries and underwent surgery
Thursday night. Detherage suffered head injuries and multiple
lacerations and was in the pediatric intensive care unit.
   Five children, including Massey's 4-year-old son who was in the
truck with him, were admitted to Marymount Hospital in London in
satisfactory condition, officials there said.
   Marymount Hospital said 35 students, the drivers of both vehicles
and an adult school aide were treated and released.
   Thursday was Smith's first day on the route he was driving,
school Superintendent Joe McKnight said. He was hired full-time Dec.
14 but had driven other times for the district as a substitute,
McKnight said.
   Smith completed state-required training more than a year ago,
said Gordon Nichols, spokesman for the state Department of Education.
   McKnight said he talked to Smith Thursday night and Smith told
him he had no knowledge of his license suspension. Smith, however,
told him he once had a speeding ticket, McKnight said.

<HEAD>CDC Recommends Changes In Vaccinations For Measles, Which Isn't Going
Away</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decade after predicting measles was on the verge
of eradication, federal health officials have proposed two new steps
to try to wipe out the disease.
   The recommendations, issued Thursday by the Centers for Disease
Control, could mean an extra measles shot for thousands of infants
and older children.
   According to the CDC, the major outbreaks of measles in the
United States in recent years have occurred among infants under the
15-month vaccination age and among school-age children who have been
vaccinated but got measles anyway. As many as 10 percent of all
vaccinations fail to provide the intended protection.
   To try to stop the outbreaks, the CDC's Immunization Practices
Advisory Committee has recommended:
   _Infants younger than 15 months, in areas where recurrent measles
is a problem, should get two measles shots instead of one _ a shot
of measles vaccine alone at 9 months, and a second dose at 15 months
in the commonly used measles-mumps-rubella vaccine.
   _In schools experiencing outbreaks and in nearby schools where
the disease might spread, all students whose measles shots came
before 1980 should be revaccinated, along with their siblings.
   That 1980 cutoff was chosen because vaccinations before then may
not have been as effective either because the vaccine subsequently
was improved or because the vaccinations came earlier in life
according to U.S. policy at the time, the CDC said.
   In the late 1970s, CDC measles specialists believed the once
common childhood disease could be eradicated by fall 1982. But that
goal was not met; from 1983 to 1988, between 1,497 and 6,282 measles
cases have been reported in the United States each year.
   Dr. Sonja Hutchins, a CDC measles specialist, could not predict
how many children would be affected by the new recommendations,
adding, ``We're in the process of analyzing that now.''
   The CDC's recommendations are not binding on local health and
education officials, but are widely recognized as health policy in
the United States.
   Local health officials will be responsible for monitoring measles
in their communities and spreading the word about the new
recommendations, Ms. Hutchins said.
   The CDC's immunization committee is recommending the two-dose
routine for infants in any county that has had five preschool
measles cases in each of the previous five years, and is urging
revaccination of certain students at any high school or college
where an outbreak is taking place or might spread from a nearby
school.
   About one in 10 counties reported at least one measles case in
1987. More than 800 cases occurred in California alone, another 469
in New York City, 452 in Texas and 318 in New Mexico.
   The nation's measles-eradication strategy, which stresses
vaccination of infants, surveillance for measles and aggressive
outbreak control, is unchanged, Ms. Hutchins said.
   ``These three elements are still important,'' she said. ``These
two major recommendations are modifications to the current
strategy.''
   The two modifications come with alternatives, the CDC said.
   In affected areas where a two-dose infant schedule isn't
possible, vaccination should come at 12 months, not 15, the agency
said. And if a school fighting a measles outbreak can't revaccinate
all students whose shots came before 1980, it should at least target
students vaccinated before the age of 15 months.

   Democratic legislator Thomas A. Loftus found
it troubling enough to be called ``Tommy'' by the Reagan White
House. Now Republicans rate him a ``sustaining member'' of their
national committee.
   Loftus, speaker of the state Assembly, is preparing to run in
1990 against Republican Gov. Tommy G. Thompson.
   For several years, Loftus said Thursday, the Reagan White House
sent letters addressed to Rep. Tommy Loftus.
   ``Tommy is the name my mother used to sew in my underwear,'' he
said.
   He said he tried unsuccessfully to persuade the GOP its
computerized address system was amiss. As an alternative, he
suggested Republicans address the correspondence to Thomas or Tom.
   To boot, he is among recipients of a form letter signed by
Republican Party strategist Lee Atwater, telling him: ``You have a
noteworthy record of support for Republican principles.''
   Loftus said the only part of the letter that really appealed to
him was its declaration that he has ``a special grasp of the issues
and a keen understanding of the challenges we will face as America
moves into the 1990s.''
   The Atwater letter contained a plastic card that identifies
Loftus as a ``sustaining member'' of the Republican National
Committee, to which he was invited to contribute money.

<HEAD>Chinese `Baby Boom' Outstripping Food Supply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's most populous country is growing
faster than the food supply, threatening China's economic
development unless authorities enforce strict birth control
policies, official reports said today.
   ``If we don't strictly control the baby boom, more difficulties
will be passed on to succeeding generations,'' Peng Peiyun, head of
the State Family Planning Commission, told about 6,000 people
gathered Thursday night at the Great Hall of the People.
   She was quoted by the China Daily newspaper.
   ``The population increase will gobble up all the economic gains
each year unless it is put under strict control,'' the Xinhua news
agency quoted Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong as saying.
   China will have 1.1 billion people by April, Ms. Peng told the
meeting.
   She did not announce the birth rate for 1988, but disclosed that
1987's rate was 2.3 percent, higher than the 2 percent previously
announced for the year.
   The recent barrage of official lectures on family planning may
indicate that last year's rate was higher still. The official goal
is 1.5 percent growth or lower.
   To achieve that goal, since the early 1980s the government has
limited most families to only one child. But in the past few years
more and more families have ignored the limit, and the state also
has seemed to relax the policy.
   Last year, it said rural couples whose first child was a girl
would be allowed to have a second to try for a son to work on the
land.
   However, the combination of soaring population and stagnant grain
harvests has heightened anxiety among officials.
   Chen said the rapid growth rate means per capita grain supplies
will remain about even even if overall grain production is increased
25 percent to 1.1 trillion pounds by the year 2000.
   However, a decline in per capital grain supplies seems likely
because agriculture officials recently said it will be virtually
impossible to reach that goal by 2000.
   Population projections for 2000 are going higher and higher. The
target is 1.2 billion, but family planning authorities said last
year it more likely would reach 1.27 or 1.28 billion.
   The Economic Daily predicted Tuesday that it would hit 1.32
billion if it continues growing at its current pace.
   Enforcement of the general one-child policy varies widely from
one area to another. Cities are the most strict, with most workers
facing fines and possible dismissal if they have a second child.
   But in some rural areas, farmers have become prosperous enough to
be able to afford the fines.

   Hedda Nussbaum, the live-in companion of alleged
child killer Joel Steinberg, did not require psychiatric
hospitalization after the beating death of the couple's daughter, a
psychiatrist testified.
   Dr. Azariah Eshkenazi, testifying for the defense, said Thursday
that Ms. Nussbaum could benefit from outpatient psychiatric care but
that in November 1987 she was oriented and coherent with
``absolutely no thought disorder.''
   Steinberg, 47, is accused of fatally beating the couple's
illegally adopted, 6-year-old daughter, Lisa. His lawyers have tried
to shift the blame onto Ms. Nussbaum, 46, who has spent the past
year in a psychiatric facility.
   The defense has argued that Ms. Nussbaum is a ``malingerer'' who
remains hospitalized to win sympathy and avoid prosecution.
   She was charged with Steinberg in the girl's death, but charges
were dropped and she became the government's star witness.
Prosecutors said she was so physically and emotionally battered by
Steinberg that she was unable to harm Lisa.
   ``I did not find any mental disorder that would require her to be
psychiatrically hospitalized,'' testified Eshkenazi, head of mental
health services for women prisoners at Elmhurst Hospital Center.
   He said he based his opinion on reports of two other Elmhurst
psychiatrists and his 45-minute interview with Ms. Nussbaum 10 days
after her arrest.

   An 11-year-old set fire to his

   Not only was the boy arrested, but the girl broke up with him

   The boy and two friends _ boys ages 12 and 7 _ were charged
Wednesday with arson and burglary in the nighttime fire Dec. 30 at

   ``The motive was love,'' the fire marshal said.
   The boys were suspended and may face expulsion, Superintendent

   The fire occurred over the Christmas break, and school opened as
scheduled afterward.
   The 11-year-old often had threatened to burn the school, and took
matches and a flammable liquid to start the fire, Catoe said.
   Catoe said the boy had offered to let his girlfriend help set the
fire so he could join the 12-year-old at South Olive Elmentary
School, but she refused.

<TEXT>
   George Bush promised a Cabinet of ``new faces''
but his final team more closely resembles a group photograph of
old-timers from previous Republican administrations.
   The president-elect completed his selections on Thursday by
naming retired Adm. James D. Watkins as energy secretary and William
Bennett as drug czar.
   The two are typical of other Bush appointments. Both have
previous top-level government experience: Bennett as President
Reagan's education secretary and Watkins as chief of naval
operations and chairman of Reagan's presidential commission on AIDS.
   In the past, Bush said ``stay tuned'' when he was asked about
those new faces. But now that the lineup is complete, the new faces
are hard to pick out.
   The president-elect told reporters en route to a Florida fishing
weekend today that it was a matter of defining old and new.
   ``I never pledged that I would have a totally inexperienced
Cabinet,'' he said. ``There's a lot of new faces in the Cabinet. It
depends how you define new _ new from the old (Reagan
administration) Cabinet, not new from having no experience in
Washington.
   ``I want an experienced Cabinet. That's exactly what we've got.''
   Nearly all the top-level positions in the Bush administration
will be filled by people who, like Bush, are middle-aged,
middle-of-the road Republicans. Most, like him, have resumes long in
years of government service.
   Seven members of his new team served in President Reagan's
Cabinet and two are retiring Republican lawmakers.
   In fact, of the government's 14 principal Cabinet agencies, only
three will be headed by Washington outsiders: Texas oilman Robert
Mosbacher at Commerce, Atlanta educator Louis Sullivan at Health and
Human Services and Chicago mass transit official Samuel Skinner at
Transportation.
   Asked where the rest of the new faces are, Bush aides have
suggested they'll be at sub-Cabinet levels of government.
   Bush himself has insisted that his Cabinet does have its share of
new faces _ or at least old faces in new jobs.
   ``I set a goal for a broad-based Cabinet, experienced people,
experienced people,'' Bush said in an interview earlier this week
with USA Today. ``I think we've got it. They're giving me a hit a
little on `new faces.' These are new faces. ... When I said new
faces, I didn't mean I was going to reach out and find everybody
with no experience in government.''
   Three members of Bush's new Cabinet are direct holdovers from
Reagan's _ Dick Thornburgh as attorney general, Nicholas Brady as
treasury secretary and Lauro Cavazos as education secretary. He also
announced that CIA Director William Webster and presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater would keep their jobs.
   Eight other top-level Bush appointees once held Cabinet or other
high-level posts under Reagan.
   They include: Bennett; Watkins; former Transportation Secretary
Elizabeth Dole, who is Bush's choice for labor secretary; former
Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, chosen for agriculture
secretary; and former Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, to be
Bush's secretary of state.
   Also: Edward J. Derwinski, an undersecretary of state who was
chosen as secretary of veterans affairs; Richard Darman, a former
deputy treasury secretary who will be Bush's budget director; and
Thomas Pickering, U.S. ambassador to Israel who will be U.N.
ambassador.
   Bush picked two retiring veterans of the House for his Cabinet:
former rival Jack Kemp of New York for housing and urban
development, and Manuel Lujan of New Mexico for interior.
   And he reached into pre-Reagan GOP administrations for two of his
selections, picking Carla Hills, who had been HUD secretary in the
Ford administration, as his trade representative; and naming Brent
Scowcroft as national security adviser, the same job he'd held under
Ford.
   Three sub-Cabinet posts filled by Bush do qualify as newcomers,
however: New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu as his chief of staff;
Stanford University economist Michael Boskin as chief White House
economist; and conservationist William Reilly to head the
Environmental Protection Agency.
   In all, Bush's Cabinet contains one black (Sullivan), two
Hispanics (Lujan and Cavazos), and two women (Dole and Hills).
   And what advice did Bush give his new team?
   Bush met with them Thursday evening. But before the event, he
told reporters his advice would include ``think big.''
   And, Bush added, ``I'm going to tell them I don't like `kiss and
tell' books.''

   A British Tornado warplane flew into
a group of eight West German jet fighters today and collided with
two of them, killing the two British crewmen and injuring a German
pilot, officials said.
   Several houses were slightly damaged on the edge of the northern
village of Wiesmoor by debris from the Tornado but there were no
civilian casualties, local police said.
   The Tornado crashed into a field just outside Wiesmoor, while one
German plane came down a few miles away, the defense spokesman said.
The other plane involved in the crash managed to land safely, he
said.
   The pilot of the German jet that crashed was injured, he said.
   The accident came amid growing complaints among the West German
public about the dangers to civilians from NATO training flights
over this densely populated country. More than 100 people were
killed in military-related plane crashes last year in West Germany.
   A spokesman at the West German Defense Ministry in Bonn said the
British plane flew into a group of eight German Alfajet fighters
preparing to land at Wittmund air base near Wiesmoor, 50 miles
northwest of the port city of Bremen.
   The Defense Ministry spokesman, who asked not to be identified by
name, said the Tornado plane collided with two of the Alfajets.
Earlier reports indicated the British plane crashed with only one
German fighter.
   A spokesman at the British forces headquarters in Rheindahlen
confirmed the Tornado had crashed after the collision, killing the
two-man British crew.
   ``We can confirm that a Royal Air Force Tornado jet from No. 14
Squadron at the Royal Air Force base Brueggen crashed near the
village of Wiesmoor, killing the pilot and the navigator,'' the
spokesman said.
   Brueggen is near the West German border with the Netherlands, 210
miles south of the crash site.
   The spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Tornado was on a routine training mission when it crashed.
   A Wiesmoor police spokesman said the injured German pilot had
been taken to a nearby hospital. It was not immediately clear
whether the pilot sustained his injuries while ejecting from the
airplane.
   Identities of the British crew killed in the crash ``will not be
released pending notification of next of kin,'' the British forces
spokesman said. He said a team of experts was traveling to the scene
to investigate the crash.
   In the worst military crash in West Germany last year, 70 people
died after three Italian air force stunt jets collided during an air
show at the U.S. Air Force base in Ramstein that was attended by
thousands of people.
   The last major NATO plane crash occurred on Dec. 8, when a U.S.
Air Force A-10 Thunderbolt slammed into a residential neighborhood
in the city of Remscheid, killing the pilot and five people on the
ground.
   The West German Defense Ministry is expected next week to submit
a report on ways to reduce military aircraft training flights.

   The driver of a hearse was crushed to
death between the dashboard and a full casket in a head-on
collision, authorities said.
   Jack Volkering, 59, of Fort Wright, was returning from a funeral
Mass on Wednesday when a car driven by Lonnie Stephens, 23, of
Bellevue crossed the road and struck the hearse, Police Chief Gene
Schweitzer said Thursday.
   The casket broke through a metal holding post and struck
Volkering in the back as the dashboard and steering wheel hit him in
the chest, said Dr. Fred Stine, Campbell County coroner. Stine said
Volkering probably suffocated.
   Volkering was pronounced dead at St. Luke Hospital. Stephens was
not seriously hurt.
   Volkering was transporting a body to the livery service he worked
for.
   Another hearse picked up the body immediately after the accident
and it was buried Thursday as scheduled, said Bob Lucas of the
Alexandria Funeral Home.

<TEXT>
   A conference of Eastern and Western
nations today informally accepted a landmark accord on human rights
and security, diplomats said. The pact calls for freedom of travel
and religion in the East bloc.
   However, a Greek-Turkish dispute still blocked a final agreement
among the 35 nations that is to include a mandate for new European
talks on conventional weapons, said the diplomats, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. If the deadlock is broken, a final pact
could be signed on Saturday, they said.
   The disagreement between Greece and Turkey over a Turkish port in
the eastern Mediterranean has prevented negotiators from the 16 NATO
and seven Warsaw Pact nations from approving the new East-West talks
on reducing conventional troops and weapons across Europe.
   Twelve non-aligned nations are also attending the conference.
   Agreement on the human rights and security accord came after more
than two years of tough East-West bargaining at the Helsinki review
conference, which opened in November 1986.
   A copy of the accord, obtained by The Associated Press, showed
landmark agreements on the freedom of East bloc citizens to travel,
practice religion and monitor their countries' compliance with human
rights.
   Western diplomats called the Vienna document a milestone. Its key
test, however, will be whether the Soviet Union and its allies
actually stick to the new commitments.
   The pact ``refined and defined the humanitarian undertakings in
far greater detail than ever possible before,'' said Canadian envoy
William Bauer.
   He and other Western diplomats said reforms in the Soviet Union
played a major role in securing the agreement.
   The diplomats also said the human rights provisions contained in
the Vienna document are more specific than any others since the
Helsinki process began with the signing of the Helsinki Final Act in
1975.
   The document also provides a mechanism by which any two of the
signatories can raise human rights issues. Western diplomats
described that agreement as a major achievement.
   The conference is scheduled to wind up next week with a three-day
closing ceremony attended by foreign ministers from all the
signatories of the 1975 Helsinki Final Act: the Soviet Union, the
United States, Canada and all European nations except Albania.
   But that ceremony was put in jeopardy today because of the
failure to break the deadlock between Greece and Turkey. If the
impasse is broken, a final document could be accepted in a public
meeting on Saturday, diplomats said.
   Turkey agreed with the Soviet Union that the eastern
Mediterranean port of Mersin, which is close to Syrian border,
should be excluded from the new East-West arms talks.
   But Greece insists the port must be considered. It says Mersin is
a key port for shipping supplies to northern Cyprus, which is
controlled by Turkey. The rest of the island is controlled by Greece.
   Greek Ambassador Evangelos Frangoulis denied at a news conference
today that Athens raised its objections at the last minute. He said
Athens would be happy to put aside the issue until the East-West
arms talks open, probably in March. Diplomats say, however, that
Turkey will not accept this compromise.
   In an attempt to break the deadlock, the 35-nation conference
worked into the night Thursday.
   A draft document presented on behalf of the non-aligned nations
early today was informally accepted by caucuses of NATO, the Warsaw
Pact and the 12 nations of the European Economic Community,
diplomats said.
   The only outstanding human rights issue remained Canada's
acceptance of a controversial human rights conference in Moscow in
1991.
   Bauer, the Canadian envoy, said this morning he expected firm
assurances from the Soviets during the day that they would permit a
Leningrad couple waiting for 10 years for exit visas to emigrate.
   He indicated that Canada would then agree to the Moscow
conference.

<HEAD>Hopkins Researchers Develop Process To `See' Thoughts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Using electrodes connected to a monkey's brain,
scientists at Johns Hopkins University say they have produced a
computer image of the brain as it thinks.
   ``We have visualized a thought process, a mental
transformation,'' said Dr. Apostolos Georgopoulos, a neuroscientist
and leader of the research team. ``We've used a technique that lets
a mental process be seen as a physical one.''
   The team's study, published today in Science magazine, found that
nerve cells of the motor cortex, the part of the brain that controls
movement, can be tracked during the thinking that precedes
purposeful movement.
   The findings might someday help scientists develop artificial
limbs that respond electronically to the brain's instructions,
Georgopoulos said.
   Experiments on a trained rhesus monkey named Lambda demonstrated
that mental calculations showed up on the computer screen
thousandths of a second before the animal performed a task.
   Georgopoulos has worked since 1980 to decipher the electrical
brain activity that determines how an animal responds to stimulus,
such as a shining light.
   ``We know that the brain analyzes the situation and has to
produce a movement that will be appropriate for the situation, with
the appropriate direction in space,'' Georgopoulos said. ``So we ask
the animal to make that movement, and we record the activity of the
brain and see how the cells interrelate.''
   Using a clock-like device with a circle of light bulbs,
scientists taught Lambda to move a metal handle to a right angle to
whichever light was turned on.
   Georgopoulos said Lambda, coaxed with rewards of banana juice,
learned to respond correctly more than 80 percent of the time.
   Electrodes implanted into the monkey's cortex picked up the
electrical activity of the cortical cells that control arm movement.
The impulses were relayed to a computer and interpreted into images
of vectors, or directional forces.
   The computer graphics showed that milliseconds after the light
flashed on, the electrical activity in those cells displayed a
tendency to ``think'' in the direction of the light. The vectors
then rotated in that direction.
   ``This, I believe, is the first time one can infer something
about the psychological processes of the brain,'' Georgopoulos said.
``You can look at the brain and see there's a rotation.''

   U.S. fighter jets buzzed a Libyan commercial airliner
flying from Tripoli to Istanbul, Libya's official JANA news agency
said today.
   The report, citing a statement by the Secretariat of Libya's
General Popular Committee for Communications and Maritime Transport,
said the incident occurred Tuesday after the Libyan Airlines Boeing
707 had left Tripoli communications air space and entered Athens
communications air space.
   In Washington, a Pentagon spokesman, Cmmdr. Mel Sundin, said:
``We have checked with the appropriate authorities and we have no
knowledge of any such incident. There are a lot of planes over there
and a lot of military planes. If something did happen it may well
not have involved our planes.''
   He said U.S. officials would probably investigate the Libyan
claim further.
   The week before, U.S. jets shot down two Libyan military planes
over the Mediterranean. U.S. authorities said the attack was in
self-defense, but Libya claimed the American aircraft launched a
``premeditated'' attack.
   The Libyan news agency, monitored in London, said the captain of
the Libyan airliner observed a U.S. fighter plane flying fast from
right to left and then go behind the airliner.
   Shortly thereafter, the statement said, two U.S. fighters
appeared, one from the right and the second from the left, each
about 10 miles from the airliner and at about the same altitude.
They flew alongside the airliner for about 14 minutes, the statement
said.
   It added that the captain informed Athens air control.
   According to JANA, Libya also sent a protest to the Arab civil
aviation and the international civil aviation organizations
condemning the behavior of the U.S. fighters, which it said
``endangered the safety of the airliner.''
   It said any repetition ``will be considered a threat against
international air navigation over the Mediterranean.''

   The English-language daily Jerusalem Post quoted Shamir as saying
in an interview that the U.S. decision to start a dialogue with the
PLO gave new impetus to the 13-month-long Palestinian uprising, or
intefadeh, in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``I must say that their recent step with the PLO caused grave
damage to peace, grave damage to us. I think they prolonged the
intefadeh,'' he was quoted as saying, adding that he believed the
Palestinians had been on the verge of giving up.
   He said he was developing specific peace proposals that included
his view of a final settlement for the West Bank and Gaza Strip but
refused to disclose his ideas, saying publicity would invite Arab
rejection.
   ``I'm thinking in complete frameworks, but I do not think that it
is worthwhile today to make any plan public because this will kill
it off ... they will say `no' and that's it,'' he was quoted as
saying.
   Shamir said he would make his ideas clear when he visits
Washington. Aides said he is expected to travel to Washington in
late February or March to meet with President-elect George Bush.
   ``It could be that I will propose certain ideas, or even more
than that, when I go to Washington,'' Shamir was quoted as saying.
   In a sign of flexibility on procedural questions, the hard-line
prime minister said he would welcome help in arranging the talks
from U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar. But he was
adamant in opposing U.N. involvement in negotiations because he
believed the U.N. is hostile to Israel.
   ``I will never trust any decision made by the U.N. or by any U.N.
institution, because we know in advance that any U.N. body, no
matter what its composition, is against us,'' he was quoted as
saying.
   Shamir was sharply critical of European countries for insisting
that Israel speak with the PLO, which he considers to be a terrorist
organization bent on destroying Israel, despite recent PLO
statements of moderation.
   He said Israel would resist pressure from West European countries.
   ``This is perhaps our historical destiny, to swim against the
tide. But we keep on swimming. We have not drowned yet,'' he was
quoted as saying.

<HEAD>11-Year-Old Artist, Missing Three Weeks, Turns Self In</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A troubled 11-year-old came in from the cold
after three weeks as a runaway, having captured the city's
imagination with drawings and a letter that were published in the
newspapers while he was on the streets.
   Jason Allen ``indicated he was tired, tired of living on the
streets,'' said Mark J. Voelz, his psychiatric social worker, after
the boy telephoned him Thursday and asked to be picked up at a
suburban shopping center.
   ``He is a fairly upset young man who needs treatment,'' Voelz
added.
   Jason bolted from his mother, Trudy Allen, on Dec. 23 as he was
being admitted to a treatment center for children with emotional
problems.
   The boy, ``a very bright young man'' suffering from depression,
apparently was afraid of being ridiculed for being treated there,
center, Voelz said.
   Jason's talents as an artist were apparent earlier this week when
Milwaukee newspapers published portrait sketches obtained from the
boy's family.
   One of the detailed drawings was of an elderly bearded man in a
tweed hat, holding a dog. The other sketch was of a downcast
adolescent.
   Police attempted to locate some of the people shown in the
sketches in hopes they could lead to the boy.
   On Thursday, the Milwaukee Journal published a long, rambling
letter Jason had written the newspaper.
   In it, he complained about being misunderstood, pleaded for
understanding and reminded readers, ``I am just one runaway among
thousands of others whose stories go untold.''
   Voelz said the boy took a few hundred dollars with him when he
ran away. Jason still had $65 Thursday and was wearing warm clothes,
insulated mittens and a wool hat, having ``prepared himself like a
good Boy Scout,'' Voelz said.
   Officials said the boy would be admitted to the psychiatric
center for about a week and later will be seen on an outpatient
basis.

   The NAACP has sued The New York Times, charging
that its real estate ads promote discrimination by picturing whites
almost exclusively.
   The Times said in statement that its advertising conforms with
anti-discrimination laws and that the complaint appeared to be
without merit.
   The plaintiffs, who also included a housing rights group, said
photographs and drawings that accompany real estate ads in the Times
``depict whites almost exclusively as potential residents, thus
indicating a preference based on race.''
   ``Decades ago homeowners could hang up signs, or run ads that
said `Whites Only.' The fair housing laws were designed to change
all that,'' Benjamin Hooks, director of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People, said in a statement Thursday.
   ``But now developers run ads that say with pictures what they can
no longer say with words.''
   The plaintiffs said they recently negotiated an agreement with
the Washington Post and some of its advertisers to have black models
included in real estate ads. It said the Times declined to enter
into such an agreement.
   The civil rights suit, filed in U.S. District Court, was joined
by the New York Open Housing Center and four individuals.

   A white-supremacist ``skinhead'' raised his arm in
a Nazi salute after a judge gave him the maximum, 10 years in
prison, for vandalizing a synagogue.
   Judge Joe Kendall on Thursday also fined 19-year-old Daniel Wood
$5,000. He was convicted of criminal mischief for the Oct. 8
incident at Temple Shalom.
   ``It's not illegal to hate, but it is illegal to act on that
hatred,'' the judge told Wood, who testified he was a member of the
Ku Klux Klan.
   After hearing the sentence, Wood gave Kendall a raised-arm
salute. Wood's attorney, Larry Boyd, explained that his client was
``very hurt'' and added, ``I'm sure it was just an immature,
emotional reaction.''
   Wood admitted during the trial that he and two friends spray
painted anti-Semitic slogans and swastikas on the synagogue, but he
renounced the philosophy of hate and said he hd ``gotten rid of most
of those beliefs.''
   Wood also pleaded guilty to three other incidents of criminal
mischief involving a Jewish community center, an Islamic mosque and
the breaking of the car windshield of a racially mixed couple.
   Temple Shalom's senior rabbi, Kenneth Roseman, said Wood's Nazi
salute proved the sentence was appropriate. ``He obviously is not a
repentant person,'' Roseman said.

   The chairman of the House ethics committee
wants to know why the son of an Illinois congressman was on the
congressional payroll while at the same time running for office in
Chicago.
   Thomas John Savage, son of Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill., was on the
payroll of Del. Walter Fauntroy, the District of Columbia's
non-voting representative to Congress, at the same time he was
running for the Illinois Legislature from Chicago.
   Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., who chairs the House ethics
committee, has written Fauntroy demanding an explanation of the
younger Savage's employment, a congressional source said Thursday.
   A federal investigation into the case began last month after The
Associated Press reported Savage was on Fauntroy's payroll although
he had submitted a sworn affidavit to Illinois elections officials
stating he had met state requirements by living continuously for two
years in the legislative district he sought to represent. That
period covered the time he was on Fauntroy's payroll.
   House rules, meanwhile, require that a congressional employee
report regularly to work.
   Fauntroy first said the younger Savage had worked on a District
of Columbia statehood bill, but Savage later conceded he rarely
worked in Fauntroy's office and did little more than stuff envelopes
when he was there.
   Thomas Savage earned $21,398 while on Fauntroy's payroll from
September 1987 through June 1988.
   Dixon's letter asked Fauntroy to explain how he had come to hire
Savage, what duties Savage performed, and whether Savage had
regularly reported to work, the congressional source reported.
   A Justice Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity
said the FBI also is looking into any connection between Fauntroy's
employment of the younger Savage and Rep. Savage's employment of
Lezli Baskerville, a former Fauntroy aide.
   A month before Fauntroy hired Savage, Ms. Baskerville had been
ousted from a job Savage had given her on the House Public Works and
Transportation Committee. Committee officials said she had not shown
up for work.
   After leaving the Public Works panel, Ms. Baskerville returned to
Fauntroy's payroll, where she was directed to do legislative work on
behalf of the National Black Leadership Roundtable, a private group
of black businessmen that Fauntroy chairs, according to a memo
provided by Fauntroy to his staff.
   Fauntroy, in a statement released Thursday, said: ``On the advice
of counsel for the United States House of Representatives, while I
have nothing to hide, I have nothing to say.
   ``It should be noted that no one on my staff has been subpoenaed
by any law enforcement authorities, nor has anyone on my staff even
talked to any law enforcement authorities.''
   The FBI officials investigating the matter do not have subpoena
powers, according to sources familiar with the probe.
   In addition, congressional sources and others familiar with the
investigation said Johnny Barnes, Fauntroy's staff director, refused
to meet with FBI agents who attempted to question him. Barnes
refused to comment on the matter when telephoned by a reporter.
   ``I don't know nothing about no investigation,'' Gus Savage told
reporters at Chicago's Midway Airport. ``I haven't done anything to
get investigated.''
   Accusing the assembled media of just wanting ``to make a story,''
Savage testily pointed to one reporter and said: ``Did you stop
being a transvestite?''
   Contacted by telephone in Chicago on Thursday, Thomas Savage said
he was unaware of the investigation. He refused to comment further.
   Congress is out of session, and a telephone call to Dixon's
office seeking comment on Thursday's developments was not returned.
   The FBI conducts a ``preliminary investigation'' after an initial
determination that the known facts in a case warrant a more detailed
examination. Ordinarily, a report resulting from a preliminary
investigation is sent to the U.S. attorney's office for review. A
decision then is made whether to present the case to a grand jury.
   In the Fauntroy case, the preliminary investigation will
determine whether Attorney General Dick Thornburgh will seek the
appointment of a special prosecutor, the procedure required when
members of Congress are involved.

<HEAD>Palestinian Dies, Militants Smash Monument To Arab Soldiers</HEAD>

U.S. Jewish lobby meeting Palestinians, report on PLO funding of upsrising.

<TEXT>
   A 15-year-old Palestinian died today of head
wounds suffered in a clash with troops, and assailants believed to
be Jewish militants smashed a monument to Arab soldiers in east
Jerusalem.
   Mayor Teddy Kollek called the vandals in the capital's Arab
sector ``idiots'' and expressed concern that their action might lead
to retaliation by Arab militants and further fuel tensions in the
city.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, merchants began a seven-day
commercial strike after pro-PLO leaders of the Palestinian uprising
called for the move in slogans painted on walls.
   The strike is to protest the Israeli collection of taxes from
Palestinians. Non-payment of taxes is a major tactic of the revolt
against Israel rule.
   The Israeli newspaper Maariv said today the PLO has foiled
Israeli efforts to block its funding of the uprising by using
Israeli-Arab businessmen, international organizations and
ultra-Orthodox Jews to transfer money.
   Mohammed Yaub Salhoub, 15, died early today at Mukassed Hospital
in east Jerusalem, a day after being shot in the head by troops
during clashes in the Nuseirat refugee camp in the occupied Gaza
Strip, hospital officials said.
   The army confirmed the death but said it was checking the
circumstances.
   The death brought to 352 the number of Palestinians killed in the
13-month uprising. Fifteen Israelis have also died in the unrest.
   The monument to soldiers of the Arab Legion outside the
Rockefeller Museum was partially smashed, said police spokesman Alex
Lapidot. He said police had no suspects.
   An anonymous caller told Israel army radio the monument was
damaged by ``lovers of the land of Israel and the Jewish people.''
   The caller said the attack was carried out to protest the
dismantling by troops two days ago of a monument erected by Jewish
settlers in honor of an Israeli taxi driver slain in the West Bank.
   Settlers have vowed to erect additional monuments to Jews killed
in the occupied lands in defiance of an army ban.
   ``The people who did this are stupid, they are idiots,'' said
Kollek. He said the city would offer to repair the monument.
   Police imposed a curfew in east Jerusalem's Silwan neighborhood
after they arrested 14 people, including nine said to be firebomb
throwers.
   It was only the third time a curfew was clamped on a Jerusalem
neighborhood during the uprising. Curfews are a frequent measure of
control and punishment in the occupied lands.
   In a newspaper interview published today, Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir accused the United States of prolonging the uprising by
opening a dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization last
month.
   ``It gave a great push and great encouragement to people who
perhaps had reached a point where they were considering desisting
from this way (the uprising),'' he was quoted as saying in the
Jerusalem Post.
   The United States ended a 13-year ban on contacts with the PLO
after its chief, Yasser Arafat, last month renounced terrorism and
recognized Israel's right to exist.
   The Maariv newspaper and Palestinian journalists said the closing
of Arab banks and limits put on money Palestinians can bring into
Israel have not halted PLO funding of the uprising.
   Maariv said a fringe group of ultra-Orthodox Jews, who believe
the state of Israel cannot exist until the coming of the Messiah,
transfer money to Palestinian activists, but demand a 25 percent fee
for religious seminaries.
   It said Arab public figures from northern Israel and Israeli-Arab
businessmen belonging to the Islamic Opposition Movement have pumped
millions of dollars into the uprising by laundering money through
legitimate businesses.
   Also today, Palestinian notables considered moderates confirmed
they met earlier this week in Jerusalem with leaders of the American
Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a pro-Israel lobby in
Washington that has spearheaded the fight to block the PLO's
diplomatic gains.
   The meeting took place at the Jerusalem residence of U.S. Consul
Philip Wilcox and also included PLO supporters, said one of the
participants, West Bank lawyer Jonathan Kuttab.
   Kuttab said such meetings are useful because only staunch
supporters of Israel, such as AIPAC, could eventually persuade
Israeli leaders to drop their resistance to talks with the PLO.
   ``The only people who can change Israel's views are friends like
AIPAC,'' he said. ``Criticism from any other source could reinforce
Israel's paranoia and fears.''

<TEXT>
   A car bomb exploded today in a suburban
district of south Beirut controlled by the pro-Iranian militia
Hezbollah, killing at least six people and injuring 14, police said.
   The blast came on the sixth day of fierce fighting between
Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the rival Amal militia for control
of south Lebanon. Police said two civilians were killed as the
militias battled with mortars and machine guns, and another three
were wounded.
   The afternoon blast in Beirut's Bir El-Abed neighborhood came a
half hour after thousands of Hezbollah supporters demonstrated
against the Syrian-backed Amal, a police spokesman said.
   He said the demonstrators, who included hundreds of women clad in
black chadors from head to toe, had disappeared from the streets
when the car bomb went off.
   The protesters chanted ``Death to America, the great satan'' and
``Death to (Amal chief Nabih) Berri'' as they marched through the
streets following noon prayers.
   ``If it happened during the demonstration, it would have been a
much greater disaster with plenty more casualties,'' said the
spokesman, who cannot be named under standing rules.
   He said the bomb-laden car was a dark blue Mercedes-Benz, rigged
with 220 pounds of TNT.
   The explosion touched off several fires in Bir el-Abed's Roweiss
neighborhood and many shops and cars parked nearby were gutted,
police said.
   Reporters saw at least 10 cars that had been reduced to piles of
twisted metal. Twenty-six others also were damaged on both sides of
the street where the explosion occured.
   Police said the wounded included a driver for a Western news
agency and a photographer from a local Beirut newspaper. Both are
Lebanese.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the car
bombing, the first in Lebanon this year. By police count there were
20 car bomb explosions in Lebanon last year that killed 116 people
and wounded 488.
   Another police spokesman said the Amal gunners slammed 120mm
rounds at the rate of 10 per minute into the village of Jbaa, held
by Hezbollah fighters. Jbaa is 30 miles southeast of Beirut.
   The new casualties in the south raised the toll to 114 killed and
230 wounded since the clashes broke out Sunday on the western edge
of Israel's self-proclaimed security zone.
   The police spokesman said thuds from exploding shells and
staccato bursts of machine gun fire echoed across the valleys of
Iklim Tiffa.
   The spokesman said Hezbollah's firepower was ``much weaker than
that of Amal's ... Hezbollahis responded by shelling Amal
positions.''
   ``It appears that Amal has started a war of attrition to force
the isolated Hezbollahis to consume their stocks of ammunition
before trying to storm their positions again,'' the spokesman added.
   Most of Jbaa's 6,000 residents fled the village after Hezbollah
gunmen captured it Sunday along with nearby hamlets.
   In a counterattack Monday, Amal recaptured four villages west of
Jbaa, 10 miles southeast of the port of Sidon, but have failed to
dislodge Hezbollah fighters from the mountain stronghold. Jbaa is
the key to a 9-square-mile enclave controlled by around 500
Hezbollah fighters.
   On Thursday, Hezbollahis repulsed a 1,000-strong Amal force, the
police spokesman said.
   Amal, or hope, has cut off supply lines to the Hezbollah enclave
by blocking its northern, western and southern approaches. Hostile
Israeli-backed militiamen of the South Lebanon Army man positions to
the east.
   Hezbollah's Shiite zealots aim at creating an Islamic republic in
Lebanon along the lines of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's state in
Iran.
   The more secular Amal favors a government that would give
Lebanon's Moslems and Christians equal shares in running the nation.

   An engine apparently fell off a cargo plane
before it crashed, killing both crewmen, the National Transportation
Safety Board said today.
   The twin-engine turboprop bound for Montreal went down after
takeoff Thursday morning a half mile from Dayton International
Airport.
   ``They found one of the engines away from the impact site,'' Alan
Pollock, an NTSB spokesman, said in a telephone interview from
Washington. He said that suggests the engine broke loose before
impact.
   Airport spokeswoman Sharon Caudill said NTSB investigators
recovered the ``black box'' flight recorder and also obtained
recordings of conversations between the crew and the control tower.
She did not say what they contained.
   The plane was owned by Bradley First Air of Canada and was flying
cargo for Emery Air Freight Corp. Killed were pilot Ian Grant, 37,
of Richmond, Ontario, and co-pilot Ken Bhuller, 54, of Chelsea
Pirrefondes, Quebec.
   Bruce Jonasson, manager of Bradley First Air, said the Hawker
Siddeley plane had been used by Bradley for about nine years and had
been reliable.
   The plane tore into woods several hundred yards from a row of
houses.
   ``We thought we were dead,'' said Dewey Meade, who stood at his
window as the plane cleared his roof by a few feet and crashed no
more than 200 yards away.
   ``That's how close it was. We've got debris all over the roof and
everything,'' he said.

   A businessman who said his good looks
and sexual magnetism made him irresistible to women has been
convicted of five sexual assaults, including three rapes.
   Thomas J. Panichas, 32, of Fountain Valley could receive up to 89
years in prison at sentencing March 3. He was found guilty on 19
felony counts for attacks on five women from 1985 to 1988.
   Panichas, who at one point in his testimony needed several
minutes and a pen and paper to calculate his dozens of romantic
conquests, insisted all five women consented and enjoyed his
advances.
   In some cases, he said, the women took off their clothes or
ripped out portions of their panty hose to entice him.
   ``I don't see how this is incredible,'' he testified. ``I guess
I'm a good-looking man in their eyes.''
   The women, all in their early 20s with long blond hair, testified
that after meeting Panichas at a nightclub or during a job interview
at his cellular phone business, he wined and dined them and boasted
of running a firm that would gross $190 million.
   They said that the 6-foot-5 Panichas then attacked them in his
office or in the front seat of his Cadillac. One woman said that
when she closed her eyes during an attack, Panichas forced them open
with his fingers.
   Investigators said that Panichas' company actually was in serious
financial trouble and that he had sold only a handful of phones.
   The jury deliberated about six hours.
   ``He was pretty grandiose about his claims of being so sexually
active,'' said jury foreman Kenneth Van Buskirk. ``It was pretty
easy to see through him.''

<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with body arriving. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Libya today flew the body of a U.S. pilot killed in
the 1986 raid on Tripoli to Rome, where a Vatican representative
turned over the flag-draped coffin to Italian officials.
   The body was to be handed over later to U.S. officials.
   The Libyan military plane, a white Soviet-built Ilyushin with a
tiny green Libyan flag near one window, arrived at Rome's Ciampino
Airport at 3:45 p.m.
   The Libyan news agency JANA said Thursday that Libya was
returning the body, but did not identify the pilot. However, JANA
reported on Dec. 24 that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was offering
to return the body of Capt. Paul Lorence, 31, of San Francisco.
   Libya's gesture comes during increasing international debate over
a suspected poison gas factory in Libya, and only nine days after
U.S. warplanes shot down two Libyan jets over the Mediterranean Sea.
   JANA also has complained that a Libyan Airlines plane en route
from Tripoli to Istanbul on Tuesday was buzzed over the
Mediterranean by U.S. fighter planes. The Pentagon said it had no
knowledge of such an incident.
   At the airport, a delegation including two Vatican officials and
several Italian diplomats and air force officers met the plane. No
U.S. officials were present.
   The white coffin, draped with an American flag and topped with
wreaths of red and orange flowers, was carried off the rear section
of the plane by the Italian air force officers in blue uniforms and
Libyans in green fatigues.
   The casket was set on the ground briefly before the air force
officers tranferred it to a blue police mortuary van. The body was
to be taken to a morgue for identification.
   One of the Vatican officials, Monsignor Francesco Mointerisi,
said Italian officials would later turn over the body to the
Americans.
   The Vatican said it was acting as an intermediary for
``humanitarian reasons.'' Vatican sources said the Libyans first
approached the Vatican around Dec. 15.
   JANA said Thursday that: ``In the framework of the humanitarian
initiatives to which the Great Fatah September Revolution (Libyan
government) devotes a fundamental interest, the body of the American
pilot will be handed tomorrow, 13th January, to the representative
of the Vatican, representing His Holiness, the pope.''
   Lorence and Fernando Ribas-Dominicci, 33, of Utuado, Puerto Rico,
were in an F-111 that disappeared during the April 15, 1986, raids
on Tripoli and Benghazi. Witnesses reported seeing an F-111 crash
into the Mediterranean soon after the plane being hit during the
raid.
   The other 17 U.S. Air Force bombers returned safely to their
bases after dropping about 100 tons of bombs on the cities.
   Three months after the 1986 U.S. attack, Libyan television showed
pictures of a body it said was Lorence's. Libyan authorities have
made no mention of Ribas-Dominicci.
   President Reagan said the attack was in retaliation for what he
called Libya's support for international terrorism.
   Libyan authorities said the raids killed about 40 people.
   Gadhafi was quoted as saying in the Dec. 24 dispatch that he was
returning the body ``especially since this occasion coincides with
the end of the rule of the Reagan administration.''
   The move follows the Jan. 4 downing by U.S. jets of two Libyan
planes over the Mediterranean. U.S. authorities said the attack was
in self-defense, but Libya claimed the American craft launched a
``premeditated'' attack.
   The Libyan gesture also comes after Washington threatened
possible military action against a nearly completed plant in Rabta,
40 miles from Tripoli, that it says is intended for chemical weapons
production.

   A Korean-American businessman arrested in an
alleged conspiracy to purchase nerve-gas bombs had contacts in
Britain, South Korea and possibly Iran, but officials say it's still
unclear who wanted the weapons.
   Juwhan Yun, 48, was arrested Thursday and was being held without
bail at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City
pending a bond hearing Tuesday.
   A federal complaint accused Yun of conspiring to violate the Arms
Export Control Act by seeking to ship bombs containing sarin, a gas
that causes convulsions and death by attacking the central nervous
system.
   Yun negotiated with an undercover U.S. Customs Service agent
posing as an arms dealer to purchase 500 quarter-ton bombs and other
weapons, said Richard Mercier, chief agent at the federal agency's
Newark office.
   He described the gas as a ``very rapid, odorless, colorless
poison which can enter the body by inhalation, absorption or
injection.''
   No weapons were ever delivered, officials said.
   ``I can't say that there was any indication there was ever any
plan to use it or in fact there was actually an end purchaser who
had plans to deploy it in any fashion,'' said Michael P. Chertoff,
first assistant U.S. attorney.
   At one point in the dealings, the purported destination for the
bombs was Iran, but that has not been verified, Chertoff said.
   Yun also contacted the undercover agent about the possible
purchase of TOW anti-armor weapons and Stinger anti-aircraft
missiles, apparently for delivery to Iran, the complaint said.
   A Briton, Charles Caplan, also was charged in the case, which
Chertoff called a ``wide-ranging, trans-Atlantic conspiracy.''
   Concern over the potential spread of chemical weapons has
intensified recently. At a United Nations conference in Paris on
Wednesday, more than 140 nations reaffirmed the 1925 Geneva Protocol
banning the use of chemical arms.
   Yun's arrest came the same day the West German government
reversed itself and said it suspected German companies helped build
a Libyan plant the United States believes is a chemical weapons
factory. Libya says the plant will produce medicine.
   Yun was arrested when his wife dropped him off at Customs offices
in Newark, where he believed he was to meet the undercover agent,
Mercier said.
   If convicted, Yun faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000
fine.
   He told U.S. Magistrate Ronald Hedges that his Short Hills home
was worth $650,000 and that he also owns a $400,000 New York City
condominium. He said he has three children and has been in the
United States for 17 years.
   The arrest followed a seven-month investigation that also
involved the U.S. Department of Defense, the Army and Navy, and
French and British customs officials.
   According to the complaint, the undercover agent contacted Yun
after Customs received a tip from a confidential informant that
Komex International Corp. of Summit was seeking to buy ammunition
for export to South Korea. Yun was identified as president of Komex,
an import-export company that had engaged in legitimate arms
dealings.
   On Nov. 27, the complaint said, Yun telephoned Caplan, who
operates Domino Associates of London. Caplan asked Yun if he could
obtain 200 to 500 sarin bombs, and three days later Yun asked the
Customs agent if he could obtain the ordnance, the complaint said.
   Throughout the negotiations, Yun was communicating with K.Y. Joo,
president of Kwang Jin Trading Co. in Seoul, the complaint said.
French officials entered the investigation when Yun discussed the
deal via facsimile with Joo, who was staying in a French hotel.
   In subsequent fascimile messages last month, Yun and Caplan
discussed the purchase of a minimum of 500 sarin bombs for $12,000
each.
   Yun met with Caplan and two other people in a London hotel
earlier this month, authorities said. The two others were described
in the federal complaint as co-conspirators but were not identified.
   Caplan could be extradited, Chertoff said.
   Caplan recently completed a nine-month prison sentence in Britain
for conspiring to export 50 gun silencers to Libya in 1985 through a
company called Domino Avionics.
   He was described in court as a former employee of CBS-TV in the
United States and a former military consultant. His attorney said he
was a small-time businessman and had a very small part of the arms
business.
   A British Customs spokesman who requested anonymity said of the
nerve gas case: ``We were approached by the U.S. authorities in
connection with this case and we conducted our own inquiries.''
   The spokesman added that British authorities ``have been unable
to produce any evidence that an offense has been committed in the
United Kingdom.''
   A man who answered the telephone at Komex's offices declined
comment and hung up.
   Messages were left on a telephone answering machine at Domino
Associates Holdings Ltd. Defence Suppliers' offices in London. They
were not immediately returned.

<TEXT>
   A prosecutor today said he has
opened a criminal investigation into the Imhausen-Chemie company,
which the United States claims helped build a chemical weapons plant
in Libya.
   Werner Botz, chief prosecutor in Offenburg, said he opened the
probe after reading a report on the dispute in this week's Stern
magazine.
   Stern, a nationwide news magazine known for its investigative
reporting, said Imhausen-Chemie was involved in the Libyan plant,
along with I.B.I. Engineering of Frankfurt and the Hamburg-based Pen
Tsao medical material company.
   Imhausen-Chemie has denied any connection to the plant in Rabta,
60 miles outside Tripoli. News reports and U.S. government sources
have said Imhausen-Chemie provided much of the technical equipment
for the facility, which U.S. officials said was built to manufacture
poison gas.
   Libya said the plant will produce pharmaceuticals.
   Hans Frey, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe,
near Offenburg, said the possible charge being investigated is ``a
violation of the export control law.'' He said he had no other
information about the probe.
   Imhausen-Chemie, I.B.I. and Pen Tsao have been named by U.S.
officials in their accusations that West German companies aided
Libya in building the plant.
   Federal officials have audited Imhausen-Chemie and said they
could find no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the Lahr-based
company.
   Federal officials also cleared Pen Tsao of suspicions of
wrongdoing but said investigators were examining records seized from
I.B.I., which is no longer in business.
   TV and magazine reports have shown bank documents and other
records said to establish Libyan financial links with
Imhausen-Chemie and I.B.I.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Thursday authorities uncovered new
documents implicating West German companies in deliveries of
equipment for the plant.
   His spokesman, Friedhelm Ost, today conceded that Bonn officials
first learned of ``indications'' in October that West German
companies were involved with the plant.
   Ost was asked about reports alleging Bonn officials have known
for as long as two years that Imhausen-Chemie and other West German
companies may have been involved in the project.
   He said intelligence sources mentioned the possibility of West
German involvement in October but contended they had no evidence
then or now that can be used for legal action against any West
German companies.
   Today's announcement followed the arrest of a Belgian shipping
agent linked to the case and confirmation Thursday by Libya's U.N.
ambassador that West German companies assisted in the project.
   The ambassador, Ali Treiki, told CBS that West Germany ``did help
us, not only in this plant, in other plants also.''
   Federal officials said this week that Belgian authorities had
arrested and charged Jozef Gedopt, director-general of Cross Link NV
of Antwerp, with forging shipping documents for goods delivered to
Libya.
   The ZDF television network said Gedopt's company allegedly used a
Cyprus-registered freighter to deliver West German equipment to
Libya in February 1986 after forging destination papers.
   NBC News reported Thursday that Libyan officials contacted West
German companies for clean-up help after a dangerous chemical spill
in August at the facility.
   Both NBC and The New York Times quoted unidentified officials as
saying the evidence included extensive interceptions of telephone
conversations between the Libyans and their suppliers.

<TEXT>
   Robert B. Anderson, U.S. treasury secretary under
President Eisenhower, has been disbarred for tax evasion and illegal
banking activities.
   A state appeals court Thursday called its action ``a sad but we
think necessary end to the legal career of one who has in times less
beclouded by poor and corrupt judgment served his country in high
office.''
   Anderson, 78, pleaded guilty in 1987 to evading taxes on $240,000
in income for 1983 and 1984 and operating an illegal bank in which
investors lost $4.4 million.
   He was sentenced to a month in jail and five months' house
arrest, fined $500,000 and ordered to enter an alcohol treatment
program. He was later suspended from practicing law pending final
decision of the appeals court.
   Anderson headed the Treasury in 1957-60. He also served as deputy
secretary of the Navy and special ambassador to Panama during the
Panama Canal negotiations.

<HEAD>No Direct Dialogue In French Middle East Peace Initiative</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israelis and Palestinians met face-to-face today in
the French Senate, a direct confrontation billed as a peace
initiative that never managed to develop into a dialogue.
   Israelis sat in one row. Palestinians sat in another. Israelis
talked. Palestinians talked. But they didn't talk to each other.
   With television cameras filming their every move, the delegates
listened politely to a string of speeches on Europe's role in making
peace in the Middle East.
   The two-day conference, which opened Thursday, was the idea of
several members of the European Parliament and was organized by four
French intellectuals. It brought together leftist members of the
Israeli Parliament, representatives of the Palestine Liberation
Organization and other Palestinians.
   The Palestinian delegation was led by Ibrahim Souss, head of the
PLO general delegation in France, and Nabir Sha'ath, longtime
advisor to PLO chief Yasser Arafat.
   Israeli delegates were Yair Tsaban, head of the socialist Mapam
Party, Lova Eliav and Ora Namir of the center-left Labor Party and
Shulamit Aloni, head of the leftist Citizens Rights Movement.
   In a speech, Eliav called compromise ``the essence of peace,''
and he urged direct dialogue with ``the opposite party'' _ the PLO.
   Fayez Abu Rahme, a prominent Palestinian lawyer in the
Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip, said the 13-month-old Palestinian
uprising would ``stop tomorrow if Israel agreed to an international
conference to formulate a peace treaty based on mutual recognition
and self-determination.''
   ``After 40 years of saying no to Israel, we finally said yes to
co-existence with Israel,'' he said. ``We are for a state that
recognizes and cooperates with Israel. Now, it's up to Israel to say
yes.''
   The Israeli government, now led by right-wing Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir of the Likud bloc, has rejected the idea of a
conference.
   Yael Tamir, representing the leftist Peace Now Movement in
Israel, called for one day of non-violence in Gaza and the West Bank
to promote peace.
   She also urged Palestinian delegates to clarify the PLO's
positions, including Arafat's renunciation of terror last month.
``You must say these things again and again, and the Israelis will
finally hear,'' she said.
   Arafat renounced terrorism and recognized Israel last month which
led the United States to reverse a 13-year ban on talks with the PLO.
   David Susskind, president of the Belgian Jewish Community Center
and moderator of the debate, called for the two peoples to work in
harmony.
   ``The idea of being pro-Palestinian or pro-Israeli has become a
thing of the past,'' he said. ``Being for peace means being for both
peoples.''

<HEAD>Investigators Report Wiring OK in Engines in Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators have determined that the engines of a
Boeing 737 that crashed Sunday north of London were correctly wired,
a newspaper said. The report, if true, would rule out a possible
cause of the disaster.
   Meanwhile, the plane's engines were crated for shipment today to
France, where the manufacturer will search for clues to the cause of
the crash.
   The British Midland Airways jet, flying from London to Belfast,
crashed into a roadside embankment while attempting an emergency
landing at an airport 100 miles north of London. The disaster killed
44 people and injured 82.
   Investigators are now trying to solve a major mystery in the
crash: why the plane's right engine shut down when the left engine
was on fire.
   U.S. and British authorities earlier this week ordered checks on
the wiring of similar aircraft engines. That move prompted
speculation that a faulty alarm system may have misled the British
Midland Airways crew into shutting down the wrong engine, causing
the crash.
   The pilot had reported his right engine on fire, but evidence of
a fire was found afterward only in the left engine.
   The Times of London said investigators were ``as certain as can
be'' that the engines were correctly wired after checks on similar
engines ended Thursday.
   Investigators are still no nearer to discovering the cause of the
engine problems and do not know if the cockpit misinterpreted
instruments in the control panel, the paper said.
   The CFM56 engines, jointly made by U.S.-based General Electric
and SNECMA of France, will be stripped down at SNECMA's plant south
of Paris, the British Transport Department said.

<UNK>Military Says Monitoring Posts Are Angoloan Problem</UNK>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military today denied a
claim that it was aiding Angolan rebels in violation of a peace
treaty and said Angola should negotiate with the guerrillas to bring
peace to the region.
   Maj. Valeriano Martinho, an Angolan member of a commission
monitoring the cease-fire between South Africa and Angola, told
journalists visiting the area Thursday that monitoring posts had not
been established in southeastern Angola.
   He also said he believed South Africa was continuing to supply
the rebel group, the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola, through gaps in the border between Angola and the South
African-ruled territory of Namibia.
   The rebels control the territory and their leader, Jonas Savimbi,
said several months ago that he would attack any troops trying to
enter the area.
   Under a treaty signed Dec. 22, South Africa has agreed to
withdraw from Namibia and allow it to become an independent nation,
and Cuba has agreed to pull its troops out of Angola. South Africa
and Angola also agreed to establish monitoring posts along the
border.
   The negotiations did not include the Angolan rebels, who have
received aid from South Africa and the United States in their
13-year war with the Marxist Angolan government, which has been
supported by Cuban troops.
   South Africa responded to Martinho with a statement that said the
military had done ``everything and more that is required of it in
terms of all the agreements signed between South Africa, Angola and
Cuba.''
   The statement said South Africa was prepared to establish the
monitoring posts on its side of the border ``but is aware of the
fact that the Angolan armed forces are experiencing difficulties''
with the guerrillas.
   ``The best possible solution to the problem'' would be for Angolo
to negotiate with the rebels, the statement said.
   Savimbi says his guerrillas are fighting for a government of
national unity to be followed by free elections. The Angolan
government has refused to negotiate with him.

<HEAD>Tass Says It Can't Confirm Earthquake Survivor Story</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The official news agency Tass today expressed
serious doubts over a story it ran about six men allegedly pulled
from the rubble in Leninakan 35 days after the Armenian earthquake.
   ``Regrettably, we are unable so far to confirm with full
certainty the authenticity of the reports made by our Armenian
colleagues about the `Leninakan miracle,' nor can we categorically
deny them,'' Tass said.
   Today's urgent dispatch was headlined: ``One Always Wants
Miracles.''
   Tass reported Thursday that the six men had been rescued a day
earlier from the basement of a wrecked nine-story apartment building
after being trapped for five weeks after the Dec. 7 earthquake.
   The chief source of information for the Tass account was Aikaz
Akopyan, a 50-year-old electrician. Akopyan was quoted as saying he
and the other men survived because the basement was used to store
canned vegetables, smoked ham, stewed fruit and pickles.
   Soviet television broadcast an interview Thursday night with
Akopyan from his hospital bed, and the Communist Party daily Pravda
and other Soviet newspapers printed his account of the ordeal and
rescue. The story was widely reported in the United States.
   But Tass said disturbing questions surfaced when Armenian
reporters began to check into Akopyan's story.
   ``Why, for instance, a day after the miraculous salvation, was it
possible to locate only Aikaz Akopyan in a Yerevan hospital?'' Tass
asked in the dispatch 24 hours after publication of the first
report. ``Where is the survivor's sister, who failed to appear at
the hospital on Friday, though she promised to do so?''
   Artem Shakhbazyan, a journalist with the state-owned Armenian
news agency Armenpress, said in a telephone interview that agency
reporters searched hospitals in Yerevan and the earthquake zone for
the other five survivors today failed to located them.
   Military authorities brought into Leninakan for the relief effort
also knew nothing of the rescue related by Akopyan, he said.
   ``There are doubts about all of this,'' Shakhbazyan said.
   However, he said Akopyan was known to be a Leninakan resident,
and that four neighbors who visited him at Yerevan's Hospital No. 3
verified that his home had been destroyed by the quake and his wife
and children killed.
   ``He maintains that what he said happened, just as he said it,
that he was trapped for 35 days with five other people,'' the
Armenpress reporter said. He said Akopyan was given a psychiatric
examination today and found to be sane.
   Akopyan was suffering from pneumonia and was in a weakened
condition, Shakhbazyan said.
   Tass said that when Akopyan's account was sent to its Moscow
headquarters by Armenpress, ``it was immediately circulated around
the world on the Tass wire, picked up by radio and television, with
more details added by correspondents of several Soviet newspapers.''
   ``Everyone wanted to believe in the Leninakan miracle,'' it said.
   Tass recalled a previous report that 17 earthquake victims had
survived for weeks in a wrecked bakery by eating grain and melted
snow. That report was denied by rescue officials.
   ``A host of other news items from Armenia, truthful and invented,
sell on the world news market.'' Tass said. ``It is understandable:
One wants so much to believe in the miracle of six people being
saved on the 35th day after the quake.''

   A pair of idiosyncratic talents captured the
bulk of Grammy Award nominations, with the feel-good sound of Bobby
McFerrin's ``Don't Worry, Be Happy'' contrasting with the bleak
poetry of Tracy Chapman's ``Fast Car.''
   Miss Chapman's somber, haunting folk songs won her six
nominations Thursday, including best song, record, album and best
new artist.
   McFerrin's ebullient vocals earned five nominations, including
record, album and song.
   The two symbolize the diversity of nominees for National Academy
of Recording Arts and Sciences trophies, and represent a break from
the mainstream. The Grammy nominations _ with an all-time high 76
categories _ were culled from a record 6,800 entries released from
Oct. 1, 1987 to Sept. 30, 1988.
   Winners will be announced here Feb. 22 during a televised
ceremony on CBS-TV with host Billy Crystal.
   Miss Chapman's self-titled first album was a surprise hit in 1988
and its single ``Fast Car,'' about a woman seeking to escape a cycle
of poverty, was a No. 1 hit. The 24-year-old singer's song and
record nominations, plus one for best female pop vocal performance,
were for ``Fast Car.''
   Her album also received a nomination for best contemporary folk
recording. The Boston-based singer came to record producers'
attention during nightclub performances while a student at Tufts
University.
   McFerrin, 38, whose ``Don't Worry, Be Happy'' was the first a
cappella song to reach the No. 1 position on Billboard charts,
received nominations for best song, record and male pop vocal
performance for ``Don't Worry.'' He also received an album
nomination for ``Simple Pleasures.''
   In addition, McFerrin, who records his works using only his
voice, was nominated for best male jazz vocal performance for the
song ``Brothers.''
   Heavy metal and rap music made a Grammy debut, while past pop
giants gathered nominations in relatively obscure categories _ Bob
Dylan and Van Morrison in traditional folk, Joe Jackson for motion
picture score and Linda Ronstadt for Mexican recording.
   Anita Baker received four Grammy nominations, all for ``Giving
You The Best I Got,'' the one song she had eligible for this year's
awards. The song is a candidate in the best record, song, best
female rhythm and blues performance and best rhythm and blues song
performance.
   Sting's ``Nothing Like The Sun'' received an album of the year
nod and the song ``Be Still My Beating Heart'' was nominated for
song of the year as well as best pop male vocal performance. Sting
has won four Grammys, two with the group the Police and two as a
soloist.
   Steve Winwood, a rock veteran whose career spans nearly 25 years,
received record of the year and best male pop vocal performance
nominations for ``Roll With It'' and an album of the year nod for
the LP of the same title. Winwood has won two Grammys.
   George Michael, whose smash album ``Faith'' sold more than 6
million copies and spawned six hits, received only two nominations,
album of the year and best pop male vocalist for ``Father Figure.''
   Michael Jackson, shut out at last year's awards, received a
single nomination for his ``Man In The Mirror'' single as record of
the year.
   The Beach Boys, who have never won a Grammy and have not been
nominated since 1966 for ``Good Vibrations,'' received a best pop
group performance nomination this year for their hit ``Kokomo.''
   Nominated for record of the year were ``Don't Worry, Be Happy,''
``Fast Car,'' Miss Baker's ``Giving You The Best That I Got,''
Jackson's ``Man in the Mirror,'' and Winwood's ``Roll With It.''
   Nominated for album of the year were Michael's ``Faith,'' Sting's
``Nothing Like the Sun,'' Winwood's ``Roll With It,'' McFerrin's
``Simple Pleasures,'' and Miss Chapman's album.
   Nominations for song of the year _ a songwriter's award _ were
for ``Be Still My Beating Heart'' by Sting, McFerrin's ``Don't
Worry, Be Happy,'' Miss Chapman's ``Fast Car,'' ``Giving You the
Best That I Got,'' written by Miss Baker, Skip Scarborough and Randy
Holland, and ``Piano In The Dark'' by Brenda Russell, Jeff Hall and
Scott Cutler.

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Montenegrin Parliament today
accepted the resignations of the republic's six-man presidency. The
leaders quit following protests over the region's failing economy.
   Montenegro's representative in the federal presidency also
stepped down. The resignations marked the first time the entire
state and Communist Party leaderships of one of Yugoslavia's six
republics had stepped down.
   The ouster of the ruling elite came after more than 120,000
people demonstrated in Titograd, the region's capital, earlier this
week and demanded new leadership because of the disastrous state of
the economy.
   Montenegro's government resigned after mass protests in October.
   ``The current mass dissatisfaction among the workers, students
and young people is due to a large extent to the difficulties faced
by the country as a whole,'' said parliament's vice president,
Bozidar Tadic, in a speech broadcast live on national television.
   The central committee of Montenegro's Communist Party on
Wednesday accepted the resignation of its ruling Presidium and named
interim leadership to prepare for an extraordinary party congress.
   The parliament, which decided that the republic's presidency will
act as a caretaker until new elections are held, also accepted the
resignation of its speaker, Velisav Vuksanovic.
   Montenegro, Yugoslavia's smallest republic and one of its
poorest, has been particularly hard hit by the country's economic
problems and a decline in living standards. The nation faces a $21
billion foreign debt and in 1988 alone inflation ran at 250 percent.
   The average monthly salary in Montenegro is the equivalent of
about $80. Unemployment in the region soared after closure of a
number of unprofitable enterprises previously subsidized by the
federal government.

   The Tehran zoo's undernourished animals
will be transferred in six months to a new and bigger home at a park
on the outskirts of the capital, according to news reports Friday.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency said the decision came after
newspapers reported that animals were dying of disease and hunger.
One report said a boa constrictor had eaten a smaller boa for lack
of food.
   The Iranian news agency, monitored in Nicosia, said a foundation

   Backers of a planned memorial honoring blacks
who served in the Revolutionary War banked their first major
corporate contribution Friday and said they hoped to build it in
Washington by 1991.
   Design and construction of the Black Revolutionary War Patriots'
Memorial is expected to cost about $4 million, said Bill Noack, a
spokesman for General Motors, which contributed $25,000 to the
project.
   GM also plans to sponsor a dinner in Washington on May 23 aimed
at raising another $250,000, Noack said.
   The memorial is intended to honor the 5,000 black soldiers and
sailors who fought in the Revolutionary War as well as black slaves
who ran away or petitioned for freedom during the era, according to
Maurice A. Barboza, president of the Black Revolutionary War
Patriots' Foundation.
   GM Group Vice President Marina Whitman, who presented the $25,000
check to Barboza at a news conference, said, ``We are here today to
correct the historical record, if you will. The 5,000 or so black
Americans who served in the Revolution and the many who gave their
support are not prominent in the pages of history ... (yet) they
made a meaningful contribution to our freedom as a nation.''
   Barboza said he hoped other corporations will contribute funds
``that will help us memorialize these forgotten Americans.''
   President Reagan signed a law on March 25, 1988, authorizing
construction of the memorial, which is expected to be in the area
between the Lincoln Memorial and Washington Monument.

<HEAD>Air Traffic Controllers, FAA Ink First Pact Since 1981 Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air traffic controllers reached tentative
agreement with the Federal Aviation Administration on their first
union contract since President Reagan fired 11,400 controllers in
1981.
   ``It's a clear victory for both the FAA and the union,'' said
union president R. Steve Bell, who predicted easy approval of the
agreement by the National Air Traffic Controllers Association's
7,000 members. They make up just over half of the nationwide
controller workforce.
   ``It represents a new spirit of cooperation between labor and
management at FAA, in sharp contrast to past problems,'' said FAA
spokesman John G. Leyden.
   The tentative contract was signed late Thursday after a third
round of talks in Baltimore, Md. The negotiatons began in Washington
in November.
   The union won the right to represent the 13,000 controllers in
June 1987. The former union, the Professional Air Traffic
Controllers Organization, was forced into bankruptcy and decertified
after Reagan's mass firings of most of its members during the strike.
   The contract does not cover salaries, which are set by Congress,
or any matter that would significantly increase cost of the
operation.
   It covers some working conditions, guaranteeing employees breaks
and changes in working positions after every two hours. The
controllers monitor and control air traffic at about 400
installations around the country.
   The contract also sets up several committees on safety,
technology and other matters, a development that union negotiator
Elizabeth Thomas of Tamiami, Fla., said would give the union more
involvement in FAA decision-making.
   Among provisions are participation of the union in accident
investigations that involve a controller's actions, immunity for
controllers who report deficiencies in the system, local and
national committees on keeping a safe workplace, and evaluation of
possibly setting up a program to deal with job stress.
   Controllers earn between $19,000 and $55,000 a year, depending on
experience and the number of operations conducted at their assigned
facilities.

<HEAD>Bush's Wartime Rescuers Remember Him as `Ellie the Elephant'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush may be the Big Elephant in the
inaugural parade next week, but his buddies on a World War II
submarine remember him as ``Ellie the Elephant,'' the fun-loving
young Navy pilot they rescued from the Pacific Ocean 44 years ago.
   Surviving crew members of the USS Finback are looking forward to
a nostalgic reunion with Bush here next Wednesday, two days before
they watch him take the presidential oath of office on the West
Front steps of the Capitol.
   Inaugural planners have passed the word to several Finback
veterans that Bush is setting aside time to meet with them at Blair
House, across the street from the White House, to swap war stories
and renew old acquaintances.
   Prime bleacher seats have been reserved for the inaugural parade
Friday down Pennsylvania Avenue for nearly 30 survivors of the
Finback crew, plus several of Bush's old fellow pilots, who are
expected to attend the inauguration.
   Bush was nicknamed ``Ellie'' by the Finback's officers for his
wardroom imitation of a trumpeting elephant.
   ``It wasn't because we all sat around thinking we were
Republicans,'' said retired Rear Adm. Lawrence Heyworth, 67, of
Virginia Beach, Va., who was the Finback's torpedo and gunnery
officer.
   ``We must have seen one in a Tarzan movie. We just thought
elepants were funny. We kept asking George to do it over and over
again.''
   Bush was plucked from the Pacific on Sept. 2, 1944, shortly after
he bailed out of his flaming Grumman Avenger torpedo bomber over the
Bonin Islands 600 miles south of Japan.
   Bush won the Distinguished Flying Cross for heroism during the
bombing raid against an enemy radio communications center. The
citation noted that Bush, then only 20, completed his dive and hit
his target even after his plane was hit and engulfed in smoke. His
two crew members were lost.
   ``At that time, he was just another downed pilot,'' said Don
Kohler, 64, of Rogers, Ark., the torpedoman who helped pull Bush out
of his bobbing orange life raft to the safety of the Finback's deck.
``Nobody back then knew he'd become president of the United States.''
   During the month he spent on the Finback before saying goodbye at
Midway Island, Bush eagerly took his turn at night lookout watches
and other seagoing duties, watched Betty Grable movies in the
wardroom and donned earphones to listen in awe as the submarine's
torpedoes sank two enemy ships.
   Retired Navy Cmdr. W.E. ``Bill'' Edwards, who filmed Bush's
rescue with a Kodak movie camera from the Finback's conning tower,
remembers Bush's surprise that his first meal on the submarine that
night was filet mignon and fresh strawberry shortcake with whipped
cream.
   ``He said he'd been eating nothing but Spam and beans on the
carriers,'' Edward, 67, said in a telephone interview from his
retirement home at Bay St. Louis, Miss.
   Bush was one of three Navy pilots rescued by the Finback during
U.S. carrier raids against the Bonin Islands in early September.
   ``I remember he was very lively, obviously intelligent and very
personable,'' said Heyworth. ``All three pilots we rescued were
bright, bright-eyed young men, but George seemed the most outgoing
and had the most ebullient personality. He was the most
entertaining, and he made us laugh a lot.''

   Police said Friday they have found the
battered body of the grandmother of a man charged with the shotgun
slayings of his two housemates last weekend.
   The search is continuing for two other people who lived with the
suspect, police said.
   Mark Southern McCallister, 19, of St. Albans, was charged Tuesday
with two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Otis Gerald
Sanson, 25, and his brother Billy Lee, 27, who lived with
McCallister in a mobile home.
   Otis Sanson's body was found in a trailer next to the mobile
home, while his brother's body was found in a cardboard crate nearby.
   Deputies found the body of McCallister's grandmother, Charlotte
Ruby Ferrell, 69, in the bedroom of her St. Albans home late
Thursday wrapped in curtains and sheets, said Kanawha County
Sheriff's Department Cpl. John Rutherford. No charges have been
filed, he said.
   ``We haven't had time to even think about that,'' Rutherford
said. ``We're treating it as an apparent homicide.''
   Mrs. Ferrell's body was found after relatives noticed that her
mail hadn't been picked up for several days, Rutherford said. He
said an autopsy will be performed.
   McCallister is being held in the Kanawha County Jail pending a
bond hearing next week, Rutherford said.
   Two other people who lived with McCallister have not been seen
since October, Rutherford said. Bonnie Sanson Pauley and her
boyfriend, Jimmy Price, were reported missing this fall and
authorities believe they may be living in Texas, he said.

   President-elect Bush arrived this morning
for a pre-inaugural weekend of fishing to ``clear the mind'' for the
task ahead.
   ``I doubt I'll get another chance to come here as president,'' he
said in this self-proclaimed sportfishing capital. ``There won't be
any winter or summer White House anywhere. I have no intention of
building something else.''
   Bush arrived at Marathon Airport aboard Air Force Two. He was
dressed casually in a blue blazer, gray slacks and boat shoes.
   ``Why go fishing?'' asked Bush, whose inauguration is Jan. 20.
``Contentment, environment, total relaxation, peace of mind, clear
the mind for the decisions ahead.''
   He said he was looking forward to ``splendid isolation'' on his
visit to the Florida Keys.
   Bush was greeted by pigtailed 6-year-old Melissa DeFoor, daughter
of the local sheriff. Wearing a flowered dress and black patent
leather shoes, she said she was ``very excited'' about the
president-elect's arrival.
   The vice president and a crew of Washington fishing buddies
planned to drive 32 miles north, check into a townhouse, then head
for the shallows of Florida Bay.
   Fishing guide George Hommell, who has taken Bush out before, said
he had his 17-foot skiff ready for excursions into Everglades
National Park waters and the home of ``bonefish, which is probably
the fastest fish in the world.''
   Weather permitting, Bush will spend all three days of his weekend
pursuing redfish, snook, sea trout, ladyfish, jack and barracuda,
Hommell said.
   ``These are all fish that you use light tackle for, with 8- or
10-pound test line, and you cast in shallow water,'' he said.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady was expected to join Bush,
along with Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.; Dr. Burton James Lee III of
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York; Fred Zeder, a
senior transition adviser and longtime friend; and the usual
entourage of Secret Service agents and reporters.
   The excursion is Bush's third fishing or hunting trip since his
election two months ago. He went fishing in Gulf Stream, Fla., in
November and went hunting and fishing in Texas and Alabama the week
after Christmas.
   It was not the first stay for Bush in this island community of
5,000. Bush also spent time last April at Tarpon Flats, a townhouse
development where prices start at $425,000.
   J.W. ``Jim'' Gibbs, executive director of the Islamorada Chamber
of Commerce, was elated at the prospect of another Bush visit.
   ``We've had him here many times before and we've enjoyed his
visits,'' he said. ``The nice thing about our area is they come to
relax and escape all the hubbub, and that's what we allow them to
do.''

   A couple accused of enslaving two
mentally retarded men for more than a decade on their dairy farm
have been fined and ordered to pay the men $34,000 in restitution.
   Ike and Margarethe Kozminski of Chelsea pleaded guilty in October
to a reduced charge of violating the Fair Labor Standards Act by
failing to maintain necessary employment records for the men.
   U.S. District Judge George La Plata on Wednesday fined the
Kozminskis $3,000 each and ordered them to pay restitution to Robert
Fulmer, 72, and Louis Molitoris, 65.
   The couple's son, John Kozminski, pleaded guilty to the same
charge and was sentenced to six months in a court diversion program
similar to probation. La Plata will decide whether to impose a
further sentence or dismiss the charge.
   The Kozminskis were indicted in 1983 on charges of holding Fulmer
and Molitoris in involuntary servitude for more than a decade.
   The couple was accused of not paying the workers while housing
them in a trailer without utilities and feeding them moldy food. The
Kozminskis allegedly denied them medical care and told them they
would be arrested if they tried to leave.
   A federal jury convicted the couple in 1984. The U.S. Supreme
Court reversed the ruling and returned the case to U.S. District
Court in Ann Arbor.
   U.S. Attorney Roy C. Hayes said his office reached the plea
agreement with the Kozminskis because of concerns about the effect
of another trial on the men. Fulmer and Molitoris were last known to
be living in separate foster care homes west of Ann Arbor.
   The Kozminskis declined to speak with reporters following their
appearance before La Plata.

   Candice Bergen, star of the successful new CBS
series ``Murphy Brown,'' has a lifestyle that is not just
bi-coastal, it's bi-continental.
   While filming the show, Bergen lives in Los Angeles with her
3-year-old daughter, Chloe.
   But the rest of the time, she and her husband, film director
Louis Malle, live in New York and Malle's estate in the south of
France.
   ``It's the kind of place where the most exciting thing is to
watch the tomatoes grow,'' Bergen said in the February issue of
Vanity Fair, referring to a stay in France last summer during the
writers' strike.
   ``But it was such an important summer for us because of how much
that house now means in terms of a refuge.''
   Bergen, the daughter of the late ventriloquist Edgar Bergen,
said, ``I come from this tiny, shrinking family, but when we get
together with Louis' family there are so many cousins and even
great-grandchildren. There are 30 of us and it's wonderful.''
   ``I can't imagine what I would do without Louis. If you don't

   The surgeon who performed a
career-saving operation on Joe Montana's back said he is surprised
the San Francisco 49ers quarterback is still playing.
   ``I frankly felt he would have done himself in by now,'' Arthur
White said Thursday. ``It's amazing, simply amazing.''
   But White, in an interview in The (Oakland) Tribune, also said he
fears advancing arthritis is putting the Super Bowl-bound Montana
closer to an injury that could end his football-playing days.
   Montana, 32, who had a ruptured disk removed in September 1986,
is ``eating up the years really fast,'' said White, medical director
of the Spine Care Medical Group in Daly City.
   Montana said last summer he wanted to keep going four or five
more seasons.
   But Montana's back shouldn't affect his play in Super Bowl XXII
on Jan. 22, and he is not in any more danger of serious injury than
any other player, the doctor said.
   ``It's not as if he's throwing all caution to the wind,'' he
said. ``Besides, if a million dollars was on the line, I'd probably
play the next game, too.''

   British actress Tracey Ullman will play a
woman who repeatedly tries to kill her husband in a black comedy
based on an Allentown case, according to the movie's production
company.
   The starring role in ``I Love You To Death'' will be the first

movie ``Plenty.'' She now has a weekly half-hour comedy show on the
Fox Network.
   The casting was confirmed Tuesday by Chestnut Hill Productions,
which plans to begin shooting the film in April in North Carolina,
Oregon and Washington state.
   Directed by Lawrence Kasdan, the film also will star Kevin Kline.
   Kline and Ullman will play Tony and Frances Toto.
   Mrs. Toto repeatedly tried to kill her husband by having him shot
in the head, and, when he survived, the heart. After each attempt,
she fed him homemade chicken soup laced with barbiturates.
   Toto immediately forgave his wife, but the authorities did not.
The couple was reunited in February after she served a four-year

<HEAD>Source: Party Ready to Offer Legalization to Solidarity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party leaders are ready to make
Solidarity legal again if the trade union will help back their
political and economic reforms, a government source said Friday.
   The source _ a party member informed about preparations for a key
meeting of the party Central Committee on Monday and Tuesday _
characterized the decision as ``a gamble'' and ``revolutionary'' for
Poland.
   If it is accepted by the opposition, it will mark the end of an
era of political impasse in Poland and represent an admission that
authorities' efforts through most of the 1980s to destroy the East
bloc's only independent union movement have failed.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa was not available for comment
Friday evening.
   Union national spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz said he had not been
expecting such a dramatic action from the Central Committee meeting,
``but if it happened, it would be very good'' and could ``open the
road'' to talks between the opposition and the government.
   Members of the ruling Politburo, led by Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski,
visited factories Friday to inform party units about the plenum, the
state-run PAP news service reported.
   The source, who demanded anonymity, said Solidarity could be
legalized in a few months if it agrees to certain conditions, which
he said might be expected to include a promise to obey a 1982 union
law that spells out arbitration procedures in collective bargaining
disputes and bans wildcat strikes.
   Solidarity, banned seven years ago, has said it would accept
legalization within the framework of that law.
   Solidarity would also be expected to begin talks immediately with
the authorities, the source said. It would be asked to agree with
authorities on the form and aims of a new election law that could
result in a ``substantial presence'' of the opposition in parliament
_ but leave the party in a coalition majority with the allied
Peasant and Democratic parties, the source said.
   The arrangement would mean the communists would have diminished
power in the parliament, because they now have an absolute majority
and do not need the coalition parties to rule, the source said.
   Parliamentary elections are scheduled this year and Jaruzelski
has stressed that more opposition voices should be heard in
parliament. However, the party wants to allocate seats to various
constituencies rather than have Western-style competition among
opposing parties, as the opposition prefers.
   Other topics for discussion would be on the formation of a second
chamber of parliament and on a permanent Council of National
Reconciliation, a committee that would represent a broad political
spectrum of views and seek consensus on major issues.
   Compromise with the opposition is possible in part because of the
changing international situation, including the reforms being
carried out by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the easing of
U.S.-Soviet tensions, the source said.
   Authorities expect the West to support Polish reforms and
encourage the opposition ``in a positive sense,'' but not to back
``adventures, revolt and civil war,'' he said, arguing that only
peaceful change, not confrontation, will bring results.
   Poland also expects the decision to recognize Solidarity to lead
Western governments to look more favorably on the country's requests
for credits in such forums as the Paris Club, the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank, the source said.
   The country already has hints that Western governments will look
on the action favorably, he said.
   ``We hope that this decision will facilitate financial relations
with the West and Western participation in the Polish reform,'' said
the source.
   ``We count on the opposition being loyal, so we can have this
year a legal opposition in Poland,'' the source said.
   He said the compromise as he described it was ``possible but not
100 percent sure. There are people against agreement.''
   There are party members who oppose the compromise, especially
within the official trade union movement OPZZ, but Jaruzelski and
Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski favor the agreement and have
sufficient backing to produce a declaration at the party meeting,
the source said.
   The source estimated that no more than one-third of Central
Committee members will be opposed or hesitate before approving the
decision.
   The source said Walesa must decide if he prefers ``legalization
and some divisions'' in his ranks ``or unity and continuation of the
situation.
   ``According to our knowledge, Walesa and those around him are for
the agreement,'' he said.
   Solidarity was suspended and then banned after a Dec. 13, 1981,
military crackdown when authorities said the union had been taken
over by radicals intent on toppling Poland's communist system.
   The union had a 16-month legal existence after August 1980, and
continued to be active after the imposition of martial law, first as
an underground organization and more openly since a 1986 political
amnesty.

   A University of Oklahoma football player
shot a teammate in the chest in an argument at a dormitory for
athletes today, officials said.
   Zarak Peters was in stable condition at Norman Regional Hospital,
a bullet lodged in his ribs, said spokeswoman Paula Bowles.
   Teammate Jerry Parks, 20, was charged with shooting with intent
to injure, which carries up to 10 years in prison, said District
Attorney Tully McCoy. Parks was jailed for arraignment later today
and suspended from the university.
   ``At the University of Oklahoma we go to great lengths to protect
our students,'' interim President David Swank said in a statement.
``Possession or use of a firearm on the OU campus is in violation of
the student code.
   ``In enforcing the student code, the University of Oklahoma is
more stringent on student athletes than any other students with
frequent room visitations by members of the coaching staff.''
   The university said the two students, who attended high school
together in Houston, were arguing in the dorm for reasons still
unclear. Parks got a handgun from a vehicle parked outside and
returned, the university said.
   Peters is a lineman, Parks a defensive back.

<TEXT>
   Contradictory bookkeeping procedures and
a desire to boost commissions within the treasurer's office
contributed to losses of $279 million in the state's investment
fund, Gov. Arch Moore said.
   Moore, who leaves office Monday, announced the findings of a
private audit of the fund Thursday. It was the Republican's first
public comment on the investment fund loss since it became public
after the Nov. 8 election, in which Moore was defeated by Democrat
Gaston Caperton.
   State officials haven't said yet which state agencies and local
governments will absorn the losses, so the effect of the missing
money is not clear, said House Finance Chairman George Farley, a
Democrat.
   Even without taking into account the missing $279 million, the
state has been experiencing financial problems so severe that income
tax refunds were delayed up to five months in 1988.
   House of Delegates Speaker Chuck Chambers, a Democrat, said after
the governor's announcement that it appeared the Board of
Investments wasn't paying attention when the investment fund was
losing money.
   Moore chairs the board, whose other members are Treasurer A.
James Manchin and Auditor Glen Gainer. The board has nominal control
of the investment fund.
   Moore said at a news conference that Manchin's office was making
inflated and unrealistic interest payments to local governments,
even when the losses were piling up, so the treasury could attract
commissions.
   The consolidated fund's losses totaled $279 million through Nov.
30, said Moore. The audit by Touche Ross &amp; Co. ``ascertained that
the treasurer's office kept two sets of books,'' said Moore. ``They
kept one set of books to determine what they paid out in interest.
Another set (was kept) as related to their transactions and they
never reconciled the two methods.''
   For example, the central investment pool in the consolidated
investment fund paid out rates of 9 percent, 8.3 percent, and 7.8
percent respectively in April, May and June 1987, when the losses
were severest and the fund had no earnings, the audit showed.
   ``You will find that the treasurer's office was paying out
tremendously large sums of money that they were not earning,'' Moore
said.
   Manchin, however, was unhappy with the reference to ``two sets of
books.''
   ``I would like to believe that it was one accounting system which
took care of profits and the losses. There was another accounting
system which took care of the distributions. The distributions never
have shown where the losses were,'' the treasurer said.
   Under the guidelines of the fund, created in 1978, the treasurer
could go to an outside agency to handle investments or he could
charge a commission on what investments he could gather from local
governnments.
   The commissions ``were not monitored by the Legislature. They
were a fund out of which the treasurer's office could do essentially
what he wanted to do,'' said Moore.
   The fund generated from commissions was used to pay for
day-to-day expenses in the treasurer's office.
   Moore said the investment office borrowed billions of dollars'
worth of funds from brokerage houses to help buy the huge amounts of
securities transactions that were being handled by the investment
office. The $1.7 billion fund saw sales of $80.5 billion in 1987.
   The audit showed that $27.2 billion was borrowed in 1986 and
1987, including $10.8 billion in April 1987, the month in which the
largest loss was recorded. An addition, $4.3 billion was borrowed in
1988.
   Moore said much of the borrowing occurred without the knowledge
of the Board of Investments.

<HEAD>Internal Argument Surfaces In U.S. Agency Over African National Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A disagreement surfaced Friday within the State
Department about whether the African National Congress is a
terrorist organization or a legitimate freedom-fighter.
   The State Department's internal argument arose following
inclusion of the ANC in a book, ``Terrorist Group Profiles,'' issued
this week by the Defense Department.
   Officially, spokesmen for both departments said they agreed the
ANC should be in the book.
   ``That was an information document,'' said State Department
spokesman Charles Redman. ``It's not meant to be a policy
publication,'' he added.
   But within the State Department, counterterrorism officials
disagreed with professional diplomats concerned with maintaining
ties to South Africa's black majority.
   The section on the ANC, one of some 50 groups in the compilation,
says that the ANC's indiscriminate attacks on civilians in recent
years could endanger Americans caught in the cross fire.
   A Pentagon spokesman said the group was included in the book
because authorities wanted to warn Americans of the danger from the
ANC and other organizations around the world. The spokesman, Lt.
Cmdr. Jim Kudla, said the book had been ``fully coordinated'' with
the State Department.
   The office of counterterrorism at the State Department concurred
that the inclusion of the ANC had been approved, saying that while
the group is ``a political guerrilla organization, it also has used
terrorist tactics.''
   Redman also said that ``there's no question that certain (ANC)
acts ... would be considered terrorist acts.''
   But he also read a statement prepared by the department's Africa
Affairs Bureau which said ``the United States government has not
determined that the ANC is a terrorist organization.''
   The statement added that ``we regard the ANC as a politically
diverse organization ... with substantial political support in South
Africa.
   ``Some of the ANC's political objectives, such as ending
apartheid and establishing a non-racial government in South Africa
are goals we share,'' the statement said.
   ``We strongly differ with the ANC on some of the methods they
have used to pursue these objectives, including the use of
violence,'' the statement added.
   A bureau official, asked by a reporter if the statement was at
odds with the position of the counterterrorism office, said ``I
can't go any further.'' The official declined to be identified by
name.
   A counterterrorism office official, who also declined to be
identified by name, indicated that there was a difference between
the positions.
   Despite periodically condemning the ANC's car bombings and other
attacks, Secretary of State George Shultz met in Januray 1987 with
ANC leader Oliver Tambo, and State Department officials maintain
contacts with the group.
   The ANC also has support among liberals in Congress, but
conservatives condemn the group as a communist organization armed by
the Soviet Union.
   The Pentagon book says the ANC is armed with Soviet weapons and
gets most of its training in Marxist-oriented Angola.
   The South African government in 1960 banned the then-peaceful
ANC, and one year later the group began a sabotage campaign. In
recent years the ANC's attacks have expanded to include random
bombings in busy public places such as fast-food restaurants and bus
depots.
   There have been 180 bombings in South Africa over the past 31
months, killing 35 people and injuring at least 665.

   President-elect Bush said today he would
take ``a hard new look'' at U.S. immigration policies, but he blamed
the influx of refugees from Central America on what he called
tyranny in leftist-run Nicaragua.
   Bush, at a brief news conference at the airport in nearby
Marathon en route to a weekend of fishing in the Florida Keys,
defended offshore oil drilling and said it can be done without
harming the environment. He also said he would strive throughout his
presidency to rid the world of chemical and biological weapons.
   Referring to the furor over what the United States contends is a
chemical weapons plant under construction in Libya, Bush said, ``I
think there is much more understanding now about that Rabta (plant)
and I think that's a good thing.''
   ``But I think the way to approach it now is to build on what
happened there in terms of worldwide understanding, to start with a
determination to stop proliferation'' of chemical weapons, he said.
   Earlier, Bush told reporters traveling wioth him from Washington
that he never doubted West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
commitment to eliminating chemical weapons. The Bonn government said
Thursday it now has indications that a German company may have links
to the suspect plant.
   Bush, who is being joined on the fishing trip by buddies
including Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Sen. Alan Simpson,
R-Wyo., was asked first what he planned to do about the influx of
refugees overburdening the Miami area.
   Bush replied that the influx of refugees into Florida and his
home state of Texas ``is causing an overburdening of facilities like
schools and hospitals. This is a sorry commentary on what's
happening in Central America and Nicaragua, and we've been seeing
this for a long, long time.
   ``When I become president, we're going to take a hard new look at
the immigration policies,'' he said, ``but there is no easy answer
to it.
   ``The final answer is democracy and freedom in Nicaragua,'' the
vice president added. ``When people are fleeing tyranny the United
States has to be generous. But no one community can suffer an
overload without some support.''
   Asked what he would do about the refugees already here, Bush
replied crisply, ``The law takes care of that.''
   Queried as to whether he favors a ban on oil leasing in the
Florida Keys, Bush, a former Texas oilman, said, ``What does that
have to do with fishing?''
   He went on: ``Look I've pledged two things: One is recognizing
that this country cannot depend on foreign oil for our national
security, but (needs) prudent development of our offshore resources.
   ``Two, I am pledged to see that that is done with total
compatability to our marine life and to other environmental
considerations.
   The president-elect said he knows ``it can be done compatibly ...
because I have experience in this first hand in the Gulf of Mexico.''
   When a local reporter asked if he would have a winter White House
at Islamorada, Bush replied, ``There will be no winter or summer
White Houses anyplace. I have a home now (in Kennebunkport, Maine)
and that's the one house that I have and I hope to get to there
sometime.''
   On Air Force Two earlier, Bush said the fact that his new Cabinet
is heavily weighted with familiar Washington figures was just what
he wanted.
   Bush had promised to bring ``new faces'' to Washington, but he
said: ``I never pledged that I would have a totally inexperienced
Cabinet. There's a lot of new faces in the Cabinet. It depends how
you define new _ new from the old (Reagan administration) Cabinet,
not new from having no experience in Washington.
   ``I want an experienced Cabinet. That's exactly what we've got,''
said Bush, who choose only three people without Washington
backgrounds to fill his 17 Cabinet and Cabinet-level jobs.
   The president-elect, who once hoped to appoint the whole Cabinet
before Christmas, finally finished the task Thursday by naming
former naval chief James D. Watkins as energy secretary and tapping
former Education Secretary William J. Bennett to lead anti-drug
efforts.
   Seven current or former Reagan Cabinet officers and two retiring
Republican lawmakers will hold top jobs under Bush.
   He also enlisted Edward Derwinski, an undersecretary of state and
former congressman, to head the new Department of Veterans Affairs,
and kept William Webster on as CIA director.
   Labor Secretary-designate Elizabeth Dole and Carla Hills, Bush's
choice as U.S. trade representative, will be the only women in the
Cabinet. It will have two Hispanics _ Lauro Cavazos at Education and
Manuel Lujan at Interior _ and one black, Louis Sullivan at Health
and Human Services.
   Bush assembled his Cabinet at Blair House for an informal meeting
followed by a dinner with their spouses. He told reporters
beforehand:
   ``I'm going to tell them to think big. I'm going to tell them to
challenge the system. I'm going to tell them to ... adhere to the
highest ethical standards.''
   He also said, more in earnest than in jest, ``I'm going to tell
them I don't like kiss-and-tell books.'' He added that he wants them
to ``be on the record as much as possible.''
   ``I'd rather see their name on the record than insidiously leaked
to somebody,'' Bush said.
   ``I don't mind differences being aired. I want them to be frank.
I want them to fight hard for their position, and then, after I make
the call, I'd like to have the feeling that they'd be able to
support the president,'' Bush said.
   ``I'll tell them to work with Congress. We're going to have some
fights with Congress, but we're not going to approach it as though
we're dealing with the enemy,'' the president-elect said.
   Watkins, 61, the chief of naval operations until 1986 under
Reagan, is a nuclear warfare expert who headed the presidential
commissin on AIDS that called last year for new legislation to
protect the civil rights of victims of the deadly disease.
   The retired admiral said he is determined to make sure that
``safety is never subverted (and) the environment is adequately
protected'' while nuclear energy is developed.
   Bennett, 45, a longtime two-pack-a-day smoker, said he would kick
the habit before he is sworn in as director of national drug control
policy.
   Bush, who will be sworn in Friday, said he is ``not entirely''
comfortable with the cost of his inauguration, which could reach $25
million. However, he said it is being paid for largely with private
funds and the country deserves ``every four years something as
unifying, with the pageantry and the drama, of an inauguration.''
   The excursion to Florida is Bush's third fishing or hunting trip
since his election two months ago. He went fishing in Gulf Stream,
Fla., in November and went hunting and fishing in Texas and Alabama
the week after Christmas.

<HEAD>Retail Sales Surge In 1988 Despite Weak December Spending</HEAD>

   Retail sales grew in 1988 at their strongest
pace in four years, the government reported Friday, but the year
went out with a whimper of weak holiday sales at department stores
and car dealerships.
   Sales totaled $1.61 trillion for the year, up 6.7 percent from
1987 and the largest annual increase since a 9.8 percent gain in
1984, the Commerce Department said.
   But despite rosy expectations for strong year-end sales by
retailers and car dealers, December sales were up just 0.2 percent
from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted $138 billion.
   December's gain was the slowest since a 0.3 drop in September
that was followed by a revised 1.7 percent increase in October and a
0.9 percent rise in November. The figures are not adjusted to
exclude the effects of rising prices.
   Economist David Wyss of Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass.,
said that while the overall sales figure for 1988 turned out to be
``a lot better than we feared it was going to be after the stock
market crash'' in October 1987, December's numbers were unexpectedly
low.
   ``It suggests that we're entering 1989 with a lot less momentum
than we thought we had,'' Wyss said. ``I wouldn't call it a worry
yet, but it does suggest that the economy is going to be slowing
down in 1989.''
   Jay Levy of Levy Economic Forecasts in Chappaqua, N.Y., said the
report shows consumers ``have moved toward caution'' after a period
of more buoyant spending.
   The bond market rallied in early action Friday as traders read
the sales figures as a sign of a slowing economy that would place
less upward pressure on interest rates.
   However, some economists were skeptical about the implications of
the report, saying December's weak numbers later might be revised
upward and that they might not reflect strong sales late in the
month, particularly of automobiles.
   ``All I know is that auto companies were well satisfied with what
they saw and the general merchandisers were well satisfied,'' said
Robert Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
   Sandra Shaber of the Futures Group in Washington, said that while
retail sales weren't as strong as expected for December, spending
still showed modest growth that should continue into the new year.
   While overall retail sales for the year were posting their best
showing since 1984, the department store category rose by just 4.5
percent, the smallest annual gain since a 3.4 percent rise in the
recession year of 1982.
   This sluggish performance was offset by a 9.5 percent rise in
auto sales for the year, up sharply from a 1.8 percent increase in
1987. However, auto sales actually fell in December, dropping 0.3
percent from the previous month and posting the first decline since
a 1.4 percent drop in September.
   Excluding autos, retail sales were up 0.3 percent in December,
following a 0.6 percent rise in November.
   Retail spending is seen as a key barometer of economic health
because it represents about one-third of the gross national product.
The holiday season is particularly important because it can account
for half of a general retailer's annual profits.
   Sales by general merchandisers reached $15.76 billion in
December, up 0.3 percent from a month earlier. Other categories
posting gains during December included furniture stores, service
stations and bars and restaurants.
   Sales decreased at food, clothing and drug stores.

   A ``Friday the 13th'' computer virus struck
personal computers in Britain on Friday, wiping out program files
and annoying businesses, a computer expert said.
   Hundreds of personal computer users found the virus was
programmed to delete files on Friday the 13th, said Alan Solomon,
managing director of S and S Enterprises, a data recovery center in
Chesham.
   The virus, which might be a new species, has been slowing down
computers made by International Business Machines Corp. and
compatible models, said Solomon, who also is chairman of an IBM
personal computer users group.
   Telephone lines to the center were busy with calls for help from
businesses and individuals whose computers were struck by the virus,
he said.
   ``It has been frisky and hundreds of people, including a large
firm with over 400 computers, have telephoned with their problems,''
he said.
   A spokesman for IBM in Portsmouth, who asked not to be
identified, confirmed that the virus had wiped out files in personal
computers made by IBM and compatible machines. He said he didn't
know whether larger computers were affected.
   In the United States, several computer-security experts said
today they had not heard any reports the virus had crossed the
Atlantic.
   Solomon said his company would try to figure out how the virus
operates and then attempt to kill it. The identity of the hacker who
devised the virus might never be known, he said.
   ``It is just a pesky nuisance and is causing a lot of problems
today,'' Solomon said.

<HEAD>Church of Nativity Roof Leak Causes Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LaBELLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leaky roof on the church built over the grotto
where Jesus is believed to have been born has revived an ancient
dispute among three Christian communities over control of the church.
   When the Greek Orthodox Church recently tried to repair the roof
on the Church of the Nativity, Roman Catholics and the Armenians
complained. Now the Israeli government has taken responsibility for
repairs, an Israeli spokesman said Friday.
   ``The workers who were on the roof had to be ordered off,'' said
Shmuel Hamburger, religious affairs officer for the military
government of the occupied West Bank, where the church in Bethlehem
is located.
   Hamburger said the argument dates to before 1852, when the
then-Turkish government of Palestine stepped in to settle disputes
among the three churches.
   An agreement known as ``the status quo'' was established to
assign such responsibilities as cleaning the church, but roof
repairs have always been disputed.
   ``The procedure in which the roof is repaired, from the time of
the Turks, was done by the government,'' Hamburger said.
   Construction on the Church of the Nativity began in the 4th
century. The Greek Orthodox Church gained title in 1672, but the
Roman Catholics obtained partial ownership in 1852. The Armenians
control a southern section of the church.
   The grotto where tradition says Jesus was born is under the Greek
Orthodox part of the church.
   The three churches jealously guard their rights as outlined in
``the status quo,'' and roof work done in 1983 also caused a dispute.
   The Rev. Claudio Baratto, director of the Roman Catholic
Christian Information Center, said his church and the Armenians
consider the roof common property and believe any repairs should be
approved by all three churches.
   Baratto said the roof has been leaking for years and referred to
it as part ``an ancient question'' over which the churches continue
to argue.
   ``Some parts pretend to have rights that the other parts
contest,'' he said.
   ``We hope in the future to reach a sensible solution,'' Baratto
added. But for now, he said, the Israeli government will have to
take responsibility for the repairs.
   Hamburger said they should be made after the rainy winter weather
subsides.
   A spokesman for the Greek Orthodox Church could not be reached
for comment. Bishop Timothy, secretary to the Greek Orthodox
Patriarch, told the Jerusalem Post that the church was not trying to
repair the roof but only to clean out rain gutters.
   He added, however, that the church has the right to make roof
repairs if it wishes.
   ``If we wanted to do something, we would do it. I don't think
they had the right to complain,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying.

   A British warplane strayed into a
squadron of West German jet fighters Friday and collided with two of
them, killing two British fliers and injuring a German pilot,
officials said.
   Opposition political leaders quickly responded with demands for a
reduction in the number of military flights over West Germany, where
more than 100 people died last year in military-related crashes.
   A spokesman at the West German Defense Ministry in Bonn said the
British Tornado jet flew into a group of eight German Alfajet
fighters that were preparing to land at Wittmund air base near the
northern town of Wiesmoor.
   The spokesman said the Tornado hit two of the Alfajets. One
crashed into a Wiesmoor field after the pilot ejected, and the other
managed to land safely at the nearby military airbase, he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said the West German pilot who ejected was hospitalized in
good condition.
   A spokesman at the British forces headquarters in Rheindahlen
said the two-man British crew died when the Tornado crashed outside
Wiesmoor.
   Ruediger Schad, commander of West Germany's 43rd Fighter Bomber
Squadron, said the British and German aircraft were on unrelated
training missions.
   Several houses on the edge of Wiesmoor were slightly damaged by
debris from the crash, but there were no civilian casualties,
according to a police spokesman in the village.
   Josef Stock, interior minister of Lower Saxony state, where
Wiesmoor is located, called for a 50 percent reduction of low-level
training flights in West Germany.
   Walter Kolbow, a defense expert with the opposition Social
Democratic Party, said the crash ``is deadly proof of the urgency in
finding a new defense readiness concept.''
   Another Social Democrat, Erwin Horn, accused Defense Minister
Rupert Scholz of ``ignoring the concerns'' of West German citizens.
   Scholz has come under fire amid widespread calls for ending NATO
low-level training flights over West Germany. Scholz and other NATO
leaders say such flights are essential for maintaining combat
readiness.
   The West German Defense Ministry is expected next week to submit
a report on ways to reduce military aircraft training flights.
   On Dec. 8, a U.S. Air Force A-10 Thunderbolt slammed into a
residential neighborhood in the city of Remscheid, killing the pilot
and five people on the ground.
   In August, 70 people died after three Italian Air Force stunt
jets collided at the U.S. Air Force base in Ramstein during an air
show.

doubled in 1988 to 4 percent, the worst pace since Americans began
recovering from double-digit inflation at the beginning of the
decade, the government said Friday.
   Although inflation is still a far cry from 1979 and 1980, when
wholesale prices posted back-to-back increases of 13 percent and 12
percent, many economists said they are worried about the trend.
   The rise in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index for
finished goods, one stop short of the retail level, was the worst
since 1981, when it shot up 7.1 percent.
   The index rose 2.2 percent in 1987. A year before that, it
recorded a rare decline, of 2.3 percent.
   ``I don't like the sound of a doubling of inflation, but we have
to put 4 percent in perspective,'' said Robert Brusca, an economist
with Nikko Securities Co. International Inc.
   ``It's not that bad, but it's not that good either. If we were at
4 percent and moving down, I wouldn't worry about it. But, we're
heading up. What concerns me is the potential for further
acceleration,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, in a separate report, the Commerce Department said
retail sales in December rose a lackluster 0.2 percent, following
strong increases in October and November.
   Economists said that figure, if it is not re-estimated in
subsequent months, could be an indication that the momentum of
economic growth slowed a bit as 1988 ended. That would ease
inflationary pressure and make it less necessary for the Federal
Reserve Board to boost interest rates. In response, the bond market
rallied in early trading.
   For the year, retail spending rose 6.7 percent in 1988 to $1.61
trillion, the best performance in four years.
   The Reagan administration this week, in its final economic report
to Congress, listed the taming of inflation as one of its greatest
accomplishments.
   The administration is predicting a steady drop in the rate
through 1994. Richard W. Rahn, chief economist of the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce and an adviser to President-elect Bush, said the
annualized wholesale inflation rate, when looked at by quarter,
eased last year: from 4.9 percent in the second quarter, to 4.6
percent in the third to 3.3 percent in the fourth.
   ``Inflation watchers should not be concerned,'' he said.
   But, most other private analysts expect tight labor markets and a
squeeze on factory capacity to produce at least a modest price
speedup, with inflation rates above 5 percent by the end of 1989.
   The unemployment rate in December matched a 14-year low, while
factories were straining in November at the highest operating levels
in nine years.
   ``Inflation (in 1988) worsened and then paused. I think this
build-up in pressure will cause it to worsen again,'' said Robert
Dederick, a former Reagan administration economist now with Northern
Trust Co. in Chicago.
   Much of the impetus for wholesale price increase last year was
provided by a drought-induced 5.7 percent increase in food prices,
the steepest since 1980. They had showed no change in 1987.
   Meanwhile, energy prices, which had soared 11.2 percent in 1987,
fell 3.4 percent in 1988. However, with the production agreement
reached by the OPEC nations in November, analysts expect higher oil
prices this year.
   All other finished goods in 1988 rose 4.3 percent.
   In December, food prices fell a slight seasonally adjusted 0.1
percent and energy costs edged up only 0.2 percent. Everything else
jumped 0.6 percent, the biggest increase since September.
   This is the third consecutive month of good news for grocery
shoppers. Prices were unchanged in November after a 0.1 percent
decline in October. However, that period of stability was preceded
by seven consecutive months of increases from early spring through
the summer.
   The department reported December declines in these catagories:
turkey, 17.1 percent; fresh and dried vegetable prices, 8.5 percent;
fresh fruit, 2.7 percent; fish, 1.3 percent, and pork, 0.3 percent.
   There were gains of 3 percent for beef, 2.5 percent for chicken,
and 1 percent for dairy products.
   Fuel oil in December soared 8.5 percent and natural gas rose 3.3
percent. Gasoline prices, however, fell 3.5 percent, holding back
overall energy gains.
   For other items, a sharp 5.7 percent increase in tobacco prices
and significant gains of 0.9 percent in automobile costs and 0.7
percent in women's clothing led the index.
   The overall December increase left the Producer Price Index for
finished goods at 110.0, meaning that a hypothetical selection of
goods costing $100 in 1982 would have cost $110 last month, 30 cents
more than in November.
   December's Consumer Price Index, which measures prices at the
retail level and, unlike the wholesale index includes services and
imports, is scheduled for release on Jan. 19.

<HEAD>Hong Kong Panel Bars Elected Official for 15 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A joint Hong Kong-China panel approved a measure
Friday to bar the enclave from electing its own chief executive for
at least 15 years after Chinese rule begins in 1997, a committee
member said.
   However, the committee's political blueprint would also provide
for increasing proportions of elected seats in the local legislature.
   Martin Lee, a pro-democracy lawyer from Hong Kong who sits on the
committee, said the plan, which must be approved by China,
represents ``a big step backward as far as democracy was concerned.''
   The proposal is included in a proposed constitution by which
Communist China will govern capitalist Hong Kong after the British
withdraw from the colony on China's coast.
   The document is designed to enshrine the ``one country-two
system'' plan promised by Beijing to allow this territory of 5.7
million people to exercise a ``high degree of autonomy'' and remain
capitalist for at least 50 years after the change in sovereignty.
   The 58-member committee with Hong Kong and Chinese
representatives met in the nearby southern Chinese city of Canton on
Friday and approved most of the second draft to be submitted to the
Chinese National People's Congress. A third and final draft is
expected to be approved by China next year.
   In an interview from Canton, Lee said the group backed a plan
under which the first three post-colonial chief executives, serving
five-year terms, would be chosen by an electoral college.
   A governor appointed by London heads the colonial government. The
chief executive will be post-colonial Hong Kong's top local official.
   Under the committee's proposal, a referendum could be held to
determine whether the fourth chief executive will be popularly
elected. However, the vote will take place only if half the members
of the local legislature, the sitting chief executive and a
committee of the Chinese congress approve, according to Lee.
   ``Effectively, we may never have a directly elected chief
executive,'' said Lee.
   The committee also proposed that the first four post-1997 local
legislatures, each lasting four years, be composed of directly
elected members and interest group representatives, Lee said.
Popularly elected members will constitute 27 percent of the first
legislature, 38 percent of the second and 50 percent of the third
and fourth.
   If a referendum is held, the public could decide whether all
members are popularly elected, Lee said.

<HEAD>Fees for Grazing Livestock to Be Boosted</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New 4th graf with fees also up on BLM lands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fees for grazing livestock on public land
administered by the Forest Service will be boosted by up to 25
percent, effective March 1, the Agriculture Department said today.
   F. Dale Robertson, chief of the Forest Service, said monthly fees
for grazing stock on nationa forests in 15 Western states will be
raised to $1.86 per head, up 32 cents from last year. Fees for
national grasslands in nine states will be raised 46 cents to $2.29
per head.
   The Interior Depatrtment said it planned similar increases in
grazing fees on lands controlled by the Bureau of Land Management.
   ``Grazing fee rates are going up because the prices farmers and
ranchers received for beef cattle increased by 9 percent, and
private grazing land lease rates increased in most of the staes
involved,'' Robertson said.
   On the other hand, cost increases for livestock production ``were
modest in comparison,'' he said. These are factors included in a
formula to determine annual grazing fees.
   For grazing fee purposes, the term ``head month'' is used, which
was described by the agency as ``a month's occupancy and use of
range by one weaned or adult cow, bull, steer, heifer, horse, burro
or mule; or five sheep or goats.''
   The new fees apply to national forests in Arizona, California,
Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North
Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.
   Higher fees will apply to national grasslands in Colorado,
Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota,
Texas and Wyoming.

<HEAD>Human Rights Activists Arrested in Bulgaria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities arrested seven human rights
activists, and they face prosecution on charges of telling lies
about the state, the government said Friday.
   The activists, reported arrested in Plovdiv, are connected with
the Independent Society for the Protection of Human Rights in
Bulgaria, according to a Western diplomat and newspapers in Sofia.
   BTA, the official news agency, carried an Interior Ministry
statement on the arrests of the seven. It identified four of them as
Ilia Stoyanov Minev, Grigor Simov Bozhilov, Dimiter Tomov Yordanov
and Blagoy Vassilev Topouzliev.
   An exile source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Minev
was president of the human rights group and had spent 27 years in
jail.
   The Otechestven Front newspaper linked Menev to Eduard Genov, a
leading Bulgarian dissident who spent 10 years in internal exile. He
and another activist, Ivan Yankov, were expelled and arrived in
Vienna on Oct. 20.
   In an interview then, Genov told The Associated Press that
Bulgarian officials appeared poised to stifle dissent out of fear it
might snowball into a growing opposition.
   The BTA announcement said most of those arrested had been
previously convicted of various crimes and investigators would
``undertake the necessary actions for clarifying the facts and
circumstances (for) charging these people with criminal offenses.''
   It added, ``In complicity and internationally, they have
disseminated untruthful allegations with the aim to create mistrust
of authorities and their work.''
   The allegation apparently referred to interviews given by some of
those arrested to Western reporters or radio stations.

<HEAD>Kimball May Seek Plea Change To Save Insurance Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Olympic diver Bruce Kimball may be
allowed to change his guilty plea in a drunken-driving manslaughter
case to safeguard insurance money for victims and their families,
his attorney said.
   The guilty plea Kimball entered Wednesday could amount to a
breach of contract and allow his insurance company to cancel a $1.3
million liability insurance policy, said Frank Quesada, a lawyer for
the 1984 silver medalist.
   So Kimball may seek to change his plea to ``no contest'' before
sentencing Jan. 30, Quesada said.
   ``The company could cut Kimball loose,'' he said. ``It has
nothing to do with the way Bruce feels .... A change (in pleas)
would be all for the victims.''
   Hillsborough Circuit Judge Harry Lee Coe III said he would accept
a no-contest plea if it's proven his policy would be canceled.
   Kimball pleaded guilty after listening to only a few minutes of
testimony about the Aug. 1 crash, which killed two teen-agers and
injured four others. He said he wanted to spare the families the
grief of hearing descriptions about how his car plowed into the
youths on a dead-end road in suburban Brandon.
   Kimball, 25, is being held in Hillsborough County Jail awaiting
sentencing on two counts of drunken-driving manslaughter and three
counts of causing great bodily injury while driving under the
influence of alcohol. He faces between seven and 22 years in prison
under state sentencing guidelines.
   There are four civil lawsuits pending against Kimball stemming
from the accident, a month before the 1988 Olympic diving trials in
which he participated but failed to make the team.
   If the victims' lawsuits are successful, money from Kimball's
liability insurance policy could pay for damages.
   Gary Sawyer, Kimball's attorney in the civil cases, said he
didn't know if the insurance company, AAA of Michigan, would cancel
Kimball's policy.
   Kimball, who was placed alone in a jail cell after defense
attorneys claimed he was a suicide risk, has been adapting to life
behind bars, jail supervisor Maj. James Cook said Thursday.
   ``I talked with him today and his mood was up. He seemed calm.
His spirits were upbeat compared to yesterday after the shock of
coming into a hard-core jail from the outside,'' Cook said.
   ``He was not introspective. He told me, `I`ve got some
adjustments to make and I'm making them,''' he said.

   Thailand and Burma on Friday denied
allegations by Amnesty International that Burmese students have been
forcibly repatriated from Thailand and arrested upon their arrival
in Burma.
   ``I believe the government has more information than a body which
is 1,000 miles away,'' Ohn Gyaw, head of the Burmese Foreign
Ministry's Political Department, said in response to the charges by
the London-based group.
   Ohn Gyaw spoke with reporters invited by the Thai military to
accompany 32 students on a flight Friday from Thailand. Under an
agreement reached in December by the Thai army chief and Burma's
leader, Gen. Saw Maung, 292 Burmese students have been repatriated.
   The Amnesty International statement said 22 students who returned
Jan. 7 were forced to after being rounded up by Thai police.
   It said Thai army personnel forced them onto the plane even
though the students expressed fears for their safety, petitioned to
be allowed to stay in Thailand, and went on a hunger strike.
   According to Burmese state radio, two of the students _ Sao Myo
Win Tun and Kyi Moe _ were taken into military custody for
questioning and reports indicated a third, Tu Ain Tin, also was
arrested, Amnesty International said.
   The group said the three were active in pro-democracy
demonstrations in August and September.
   ``As far as we know, Kyi Moe is at home right now,'' Ohn Gyaw
said, adding that Sao Myo Win Tun and others also were ``peacefully
at home.''
   Amnesty International said it also had reports that another
student, Zaw Win Tin, died Dec. 30, after being held in military
custody in Burma.
   ``He had been arrested several weeks earlier and had apparently
been held incommunicado without charge or trial since then,''
Amnesty International said. ``He is said to have died from the
effect of the severe ill treatment he sustained while in prison.''
   Students had led a nationwide pro-democracy campaign until Saw
Maung seized power Sept. 18. Thousands of students fled to Thai
border areas controlled by anti-government guerrillas, seeking
refuge and military training.
   Thailand at first promised the students temporary asylum. That
changed after the Thai army chief, Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh,
visited Burma on Dec. 14 and reached the repatriation agreement.
   At the news conference in Rangoon were students who said they had
made several trips to the border to try to persuade fellow students
to return. The students said they had returned to Burma because they
felt ``used'' by the insurgents.
   Before Friday's flight left Tak in Thailand, Col. Chalermsak
Sirisukha said: ``We have always persuaded the students and others
to go home and have repeatedly insisted that anyone who is not yet
ready to go back can stay here. There is no element of coercion.''
   As the students marched to the plane, a Thai official shouted:
``Anyone who has any reservations about going back, please return
now to your tent!'' No one did.
   ``I believe it's safe now to go back,'' said Ne Lin U, 19.
``Thailand has provided us help and now I can return.''
   Kyaw Kyaw Aung, 33, said: ``The camp administrators did not force
us back. If I stay on, I cannot move freely and conduct
pro-democracy movements.''
   Another 29 students are to fly back on Saturday.
   ``If I could stay, I would stay,'' said one, Aung Soe Moe.

   A flying mattress carried a 79-year-old
man to safety as his suburban home was leveled by a natural gas
explosion, authorities and the man said.
   The incident occurred Thursday morning as James Steurer was
sitting on his bed in this western Chicago suburb, putting on his
shoes in preparation for a visit to his daughter-in-law.
   Moments later, Steurer recalled afterward, he was still sitting
on his mattress _ outside on the driveway, blown out a side wall of
his home by the force of the gas explosion.
   ``I landed outside, picked up my mattress and it was on fire, so
I tried to put it out,'' he said. ``What could you think at that
point?''
   The explosion scattered broken glass, threw a side wall of the
home against a next-door neighbor's garage, sent pieces of wood onto
neighboring rooftops and gave off a blast of heat that melted the
siding on a neighboring house.
   ``Absolutely I'm lucky,'' said Steurer as firefighters searched
through the remains of his $50,000 wood-frame home for clues to the
cause of the strange occurrence. He suffered only a few minor
scratches.
   Steurer had one request for firefighters: ``Do you think you
could find my car keys and glasses?''
   Crystal Lake Fire Chief Richard Nebel said investigators had
determined that the incident was a natural gas explosion but have
not been able to pinpoint the cause.

<TEXT>
   An electronics company and six men, the
first group indicted in the Pentagon purchasing investigation,
pleaded innocent Friday to charges they paid or took money for
inside information about a multimillion-dollar defense contract.
   U.S. District Court Judge Richard Williams set a trial date of
March 27 for Teledyne Electronics of Newbury Park, Calif., a
division of Teledyne Industries; for three Teledyne employees,
George H. Kaub, Eugene R. Sullivan and Dale Schnittjer; for two
private consultants, William Parkin and Fred Lackner, and for a Navy
purchashing official, Stuart Berlin.
   The defendants were released on $10,000 personal recognizance
bonds.
   The charges, which range from conspiracy to bribery, are
contained in a 27-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury
last week.
   They are the first resulting from the federal government's
two-year-old investigation into allegations that private consultants
paid bribes to defense employees for information about contracts let
by the Pentagon's $150-billion-a-year purchasing office.
   At the arraignment, each defendant pleaded not-guilty to all
counts against him. All face charges of conspiracy and bribery, and
some face other charges.
   Teledyne's attorney, Thomas Patten, asked Williams to postpone
the trial ``because we have a daunting task in front of us.''
   Later, Patten said he felt his client should be afforded more
time to develop its defense because the government spent over two
years to work on its end.
   Another attorney, George O'Connell, who represents Sullivan, a
Teledyne Electronics executive, told Williams that he has met with
``lengthy delays and stonewalling'' in trying to interview key
Pentagon employees about the case.
   But Joseph Aronica, an assistant U.S. attorney, said prosecutors
have ``no intention of impeding access to witnesses.'' Williams
suggested the two sides try to work out their differences before
resorting to legal maneuvers.
   Gerard Treanor, an attorney for Parkin, said, ``We anticipate
after the trial he will be acquitted.''
   Berlin, the Navy man, was asked whether he thought he would be
exonerated. ``Sure do,'' he responded.
   The indictment alleges that Teledyne Electronics and its
employees paid Parkin, of Alexandria, Va., to obtain details about a
Navy radar contract worth more than $100 million. Parkin then paid
Lackner, a consultant based in Woodland Hills, Calif., who in turn
gave bribes to Berlin, the indictment says.
   Prosecutors said Berlin's information played a role in landing
the contract for Teledyne Electronics.
   Berlin, Parkin and Lackner face maximum penalties of 185 years in
prison and fines of $5.5 million each, if convicted on all counts.
Teledyne Electronics faces a fine of $6.5 million if convicted. The
other men face lesser sentences if found guilty.
   Prosecutors have said they plan to develop the case with the help
of testimony from Michael Savaides, a former employee of Teledyne
Electronics who has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bribery.
He is cooperating with prosecutors.
   After the indictment was made public, the Defense Department
suspended Berlin without pay and barred Teledyne Electronics from
doing business with any agency of the government.
   The Pentagon also suspended the Hazeltine Corp. and two of its
former exeutives who have entered guilty pleas in the massive
Pentagon investigation.

<TEXT>
   A man who spent six months in jail
facing rape charges was released Friday, cleared by a DNA print test
that showed he could not have been the attacker.
   ``We're so happy,'' said Sammie Scheff's mother, Mary Miller.
``It's been so bad. I knew he didn't do it. ... Now we can get on
with our lives.''
   State Supreme Court Justice James Cowhey signed an order
dismissing the charges against Scheff, 26, of Greenburgh, after the
DNA tests cleared him.
   In an unusual move, the district attorney's office made the
dismissal motion, backing a motion Scheff's attorney had planned to
make.
   ``It's about time,'' said Scheff, who left court and headed back
to his job as a carpenter's assistant.
   The dismissal came a day after a hearing during which experts
declared that the DNA tests proved ``100 percent'' that Scheff could
not have raped the 21-year-old woman outside a convenience store in
Greenburgh on Feb. 8, 1988.
   Scheff was arrested Feb. 25 and imprisoned until Aug. 26, when
his bail was reduced from $50,000 to $500, based largely on the test
results.
   Prosecutor George Bolen said his office would accept the DNA test
results as scientific evidence. But his office asked for the hearing
to determine if the tests were done properly.
   The victim had identified Scheff in a photo array and in a
lineup, Bolen said.
   DNA print testing is a new, highly technical procedure based on
the fact that each person's DNA, or genetic material, is unique,
except in the case of identical twins.
   The DNA Print Identification Test offers comparisons of genetic
codes by extracting the DNA from a crime scene specimen, such as
semen, blood or tissue, and chemically dividing the DNA into
fragments.
   The fragments form a pattern which serves as an identity profile.
The pattern can be compared with the identity pattern from the
suspect's blood specimen.

   ``It is obvious that the bandit has never
eaten at Amelia's,'' proclaims a waterfront restaurant that turned
an armed robbery into a public relations bonanza.
   Amelia's lost an unspecified amount of cash Jan. 5 when a masked
gunman forced the manager to empty a wall safe. As police continue
the search for a suspect, Amelia's is working to recoup its losses
with a publicity campaign that offers a free meal to customers who
show up with a ski mask.
   ``For the steal of a lifetime,'' the restaurant says, customers
who bring a black ski mask ``will receive their choice of any item
on our menu without formal charges.''
   The advertisement running this week in local newspapers under the
banner, ``Ameliated Press'' says the masked gunman made ``a big
misteak.''
   Francis Barrett, owner of the chain that operates the restaurant,
refused to say how much was stolen. ``I don't want to tell people
how much money they can make,'' he said.

   They may be banned in Pineville, but the
Men Of Louisiana College are apparently hot elsewhere.
   Three of the students connected with the Men Of Louisiana College
Calendar, which was pulled from the bookstore of the small Baptist
college here after local ministers complained about it, will appear
on the ``Donahue'' television show later this month.
   The calendar, which featured male students in sportswear, suits
and swimwear, was intended to raise funds for a tour of churches and
schools by the college's chorus. Sales were halted by the college's
administration after several Baptist ministers complained it created
a playboy image for the school.
   Students Kent Bozant, Farley Painter and Jack Fiscus will appear
on ``Donahue.'' Painter and Fiscus appeared in the calendar, and
Bozant is the chorus president.
   A ``Donahue'' producer, confirmed on Friday the scheduled
appearance and said the program will be taped Jan. 25. Producer Jose
Pretlow said no air date has been set.
   The president of the school, Robert Lynn, was quoted in a Baptist
publication recently as saying, ``Overall, the pictures of the male
students were about as scintillating as a Sears catalog.''
   Louisiana College spokesman Lyn Rollins said the school would not
have an immediate comment on the students' planned television
appearance.
   School officials said only 23 copies of the calendar were sold
before it was banned.

<HEAD>Eds: Inserts 5 grafs on Justice Dept. move to quash Reagan, Bush
subpoenas after 7th graf, ``Walsh last''</HEAD>

   The judge in the Iran-Contra case today
dismissed the two criminal charges that accused fired National
Security Council aide Oliver North of illegally diverting more than
$14 million in U.S. Iran arms sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell said he had no choice but to
grant the motion by independent counsel Lawrence Walsh to dismiss
the conspiracy and theft counts against North. The Reagan
administration had refused to allow use of some classified documents
bearing on the charges in the trial.
   ``It is apparent that the attorney general and the independent
counsel are unable to proceed... (are) unwilling to proceed in
connection with the conspiracy and theft charges,'' said Gesell.
   ``The court is powerless to direct the case to proceed'' on the
two main counts.
   The judge dropped the charges under a section of the Classified
Information Procedures Act in which the attorney general may certify
that a trial may result in the disclosure of classified information.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh made that certification in a
declaration filed Thursday with Gesell at the judge's request.
   Walsh last week gave up his pursuit of the conspiracy and theft
of government property charges against North after the
administration refused to declassify portions of documents that
Gesell said were needed in order for North to get a fair trial.
   Meanwhile today, the Justice Department filed a motion to quash
subpoenas that North had served to compel the testimony of President
Reagan and President-elect Bush when he stands trial beginning Jan.
31.
   The department said the two subpoenas ``raise profound
constitutional concerns, not only regarding executive privilege with
respect to particular information, but also regarding the authority
of the courts to compel appearances by a former or sitting
president.''
   North's unprecedented attempt to compel a chief executive's
testimony ``threatens the place of the president in the
constitutional structure as head of a co-equal branch of the
government,'' the department said in a brief signed by Assistant
Attorney General John R. Bolton.
   The court papers disclosed that Reagan offered last Sept. 28 to
respond in writing to ``reasonable written questions'' about the
case. Bush has also offered to provide such written responses to
relevant questions.
   The offer was apparently rejected by North's lawyers, and the
Justice Department argued that the defense must show that they need
the testimony of Bush and Reagan for their case.
   At a hearing today, Gesell touched on one of the areas of
classified material that was among the most sensitive with the
administration. He pointed to the portion of his order Dec. 12 that
said that in many cases the government must provide the full text of
intelligence reports in open court in any trial of North.
   ``The court has no factual basis to question'' the classification
of documents that the administration says it cannot allow to be
disclosed at North's trial, Gesell said.
   Meanwhile, Walsh embarked on an effort to protect the remaining
12 criminal charges against North from the problems of classified
information that plagued the conspiracy and theft counts.
   Walsh said in a court filing Thursday that North's possible
offenses to the other 12 counts ``are narrowly circumscribed'' and
that ``the classified information problems'' affecting the
conspiracy and theft charges ``should no longer be at issue.''
   Walsh's view clashes with the one expressed a week ago by defense
attorney Brendan Sullivan, who said, ``Classified information
pervades the remaining charges as well.''
   At the conclusion of today's court hearing, Gesell announced that
lawyers from both sides were to meet immediately in his chambers to
discuss matters pertaining to classified information.
   Four of the remaining charges relate North's alleged obstruction
of inquiries in September and October 1985 by misrepresenting his
activities to Congress.
   Walsh said the government also will prove North denied in the
1986 presidential inquiry by Attorney General Edwin Meese III that
the NSC was involved in the diversion of an arms sale money and that
North told Meese the Israelis controlled the diversion.
   Walsh said in the court filing Thursday that ``the government's
case no longer depends on proving that the proceeds of the Iranian
arms sales constituted government property, or that by diverting
those proceeds to the Contras, North embezzled them.''
   He said ``classified information problems affecting Counts One
and Two (the conspiracy and theft charges) should no longer be an
issue.''
   Still, Walsh said North may attempt to bring classified
information into the case by saying that he covered up his
activities because superiors directed him to or because everything
he did was ``authorized and perfectly legal.'' Under neither
approach should North be permitted ``to import classified
information,'' said Walsh.
   However, Gesell said Monday that while motive does not determine
guilt or innocence under the law, North has a right to show the
activities he sought to cover up were not illegal. North might then
seek to bring in some of the same classified information that led
Walsh to abandon the conspiracy and theft charges.
   Walsh said the government would prove North solicited funds for
the Contras from private donors, helped Contra leader Adolfo Calero
obtain weapons, played a role in the Contras' opening a southern
front and provided military advice and intelligence.
   Since that alleged assistance predates U.S. arms sales to Iran,
proof of the legality or illegality of diverting money to the
Contras from those arms sales is irrelevant, said Walsh.
   Walsh said ``what is not at issue'' in connection with the counts
concerning the attorney general's inquiry is whether North was
authorized to divert funds or believed he was authorized.
   The independent counsel also said North ``should not be permitted
to introduce evidence that earlier in 1986, the Attorney General or
the President allegedly had some fragmentary knowledge of North's
conduct.''
   Walsh's filing also disclosed new information on the allegation
North made personal use of travelers checks supplied by Calero.
Walsh said that on four occasions involving six checks, North spent
them on ``official travel for which he sought and received
government reimbursement.''
   According to testimony at congressional hearings in 1987, North
had spent some of the travelers checks at local merchants. Those
checks are mentioned in the indictment.
   According to Walsh, North on three occasions involving half a
dozen travelers checks spent the money on private travel for himself
or his family.

   Mike Tyson was said to be ``all smiles'' today
after heeding the ``lovebird whistle'' and rushing off to see Robin
Givens in Canada, where the champ also got in some sparring practice
with news cameras.
   The 22-year-old fighter left training camp Wednesday without
luggage or entourage to go to Vancouver, where his estranged wife
was filming an ABC movie.
   Tyson, who is scheduled to fight Frank Bruno of Britain Feb. 25
at the Las Vegas Hilton, arrived back in town Thursday night, said
Bruce Banke, hotel executive director of publicity.
   ``He was all smiles, very calm, very gracious,'' said Banke, who
talked with the champion briefly today before Tyson got into a
sports car and drove away.
   Tyson is involved in divorce proceedings against Givens, who
recently filed a $125 million libel suit against him.
   ``Tyson went to Vancouver for the simple reason that there is a
thing called the lovebird whistle,'' Al Braverman, a fight promoter,
said from New York.
   In Vancouver, Tyson threw a photographer's camera and snapped the
viewfinder off a TV camera as he entered a hotel. No charges were
filed.
   Jasper Vance, an ABC publicist, said Tyson visited Givens on the
set, but ``I don't know whether this means they have effected a
reconciliation.''
   A member of the movie's production staff who refused to give his
name said the couple were ``very affectionate'' on the set.

<HEAD>Helms Says Soviets Violating Treaty At Missile Plant But US Is Satisfied</HEAD>
<HEAD>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said Friday the
Soviet Union is preventing U.S. inspectors from X-raying containers
leaving a Soviet missile assembly plant and is therefore violating
the treaty banning medium-range, nuclear-armed missiles.
   But the State Department said it expects full Soviet cooperation
when the X-ray equipment is ready to be installed and is satisfied
that existing procedures will enable the detection of any banned
medium-range SS-20 missile attempting to leave the factory.
   ``The United States is satisfied with the implementation of the
... treaty to date,'' said department spokesman Charles Redmond.
   Helms, in a letter to President Reagan, called inspection rights
at Votkinsk the ``heart and keystone'' of the treaty's verification
system and said that under the treaty's terms the U.S. inspection
team should have been able to X-ray all items leaving the factory by
last Dec. 1, six months after the treaty went into effect.
   ``The package of procedures that the Soviets obligated themselves
to allow have not been agreed, in part because the Soviets have made
unacceptable demands for other procedures and provisions,'' Helms
said.
   ``Because of this failure to agree to the U.S. X-ray rights, the
U.S. X-ray equipment is still not installed at Votkinsk,'' he said.
   Helms asked Reagan what he intends to do to ``prevent the Soviets
from continuing to exploit their potential to cheat at Votkinsk''
and added:
   ``Due to Soviet intransigence, the U.S. has been totally unable
to monitor effectively or verify whether the Soviets have continued
to manufacture or deploy perhaps dozens of banned SS-20 missiles
from the Votkinsk factory for the last eight months that the treaty
has been in force.''
   But at the State Department, Redmond said that any problem was a
minor one.
   ``The Soviet Union agrees fully with the right of the United
States to install that kind of equipment,'' Redmond said, adding
that the Soviets will have the same X-raying privileges at the U.S.
facility at Magna, Utah.
   ``We are now in the final stage of working out of the details of
implementing this right,'' Redmon said. ``The United States is in
the final stage of testing the appropriate equipment for this
particular verification method.''
   ``When we are fully ready to install our equipment we expect the
Soviet Union will cooperate with us fully,'' he said.
   A 30-person U.S. team continuously monitors the Votkinsk facility
and has inspected every vehicle leaving it large enough to contain
an SS-20, Redmon said.
   Additionally. he said the inspection team is ``opening randomly
selected SS-25 canisters.''
   ``This particular monitoring activity is but one element of a
comprehensive set of verification procedures,'' Redmond said.

<HEAD>Postal Drug Tests May Indicate Problem Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People who tested positive for drugs in
pre-employment screening, but were hired anyway, had sharply higher
absentee rates and were much more likely to be fired than other
workers, the Postal Service reported Friday.
   Once on the job, people who had positive drug tests had a 43
percent higher absentee rate and were 40 percent more likely to be
fired than workers who tested clean of drugs, the agency said.
   ``We're doing actual work force performance factors. Attendance
and involuntary turnover are the first ones (in which) we see a
strong relationship at this point in the study,'' said Assistant
Postmaster General Joel S. Trosch in a telephone interview.
   ``Frankly, I anticipate some of the relationships we see getting
stronger and I will not be surprised if we see other relationships''
such as accident rates, he said.
   ``Even these first interim results provide significant support
for a business decision to say no to applicants who test positive
for drugs,'' added Trosch, who handles employee relations.
   The drug tests were not used in deciding whether to hire the
employees involved, although the Postal Service is planning to
institute pre-employment drug screening for all new workers over the
next 30 days, Trosch said.
   The National Labor Relations Board, meanwhile, is considering
whether such testing should be subject to bargaining between the
Postal Service and its unions.
   The test results reported Friday came from a program involving
4,375 workers hired at 21 sites around the country over nine months.
The report covered the first six months of work for those people. It
is planned to continue for a full two years.
   In the test, designed by the Postal Service with National
Institute on Drug Abuse consultation, job applicants were screened
for drugs before being hired.
   However, local managers were not informed of the results of the
tests. They made hiring decisions based on written exams and
interviews, as with any postal worker, officials said.
   In the study, 5,465 applicants were screened for drugs. Of them,
4,375 were eventually hired by the Postal Service, and 4,220 were
evaluated in this study because they had completed their six-month
probationary period.
   A subsequent analysis found that 515 applicants had tested
positive, of which 354 had been hired by the agency.
   Marijuana was the most common drug found, being detected in 232
cases. Of those hired, 88 had tested positive for cocaine and 34 for
other drugs, according to the report.
   Of all those hired, 361 have since been fired by the Postal
Service for one reason or another, the report said.
   That group included 42 people who had tested positive for drugs
and 319 who had tested negative.
   The study found those using drugs made up 8.4 percent of the
evaluated group of people hired. The firing rate for drug users was
40 percent higher than for non-users.
   In addition, the agency totaled up the sick leave, leave without
pay and time spent absent without leave for both groups.
   While it did not report detailed numbers in this category, the
agency said that those who had tested positive for drugs were absent
from work at a rate 43 percent greater than those who tested
negative.
   ``Our study is the first in which we are ... comparing
performance of individuals who test positive and who test negative
in an actual work setting,'' Trosch said.
   In reporting the preliminary figures, the Postal Service added
that turnover and absenteeism are only two of many areas that are
potentially affected by whether workers use drugs.
   ``Other productivity savings may result from reductions in
accidents, injuries, benefit claims, etc.,'' the report said.
   Statistics on those topics are expected to be included as the
test continues.
   The 21 postal centers involved in the test are Trenton, N.J.;
Hartford, Conn.; New Haven, Conn.; Atlanta; Tampa, Fla.; Orlando,
Fla.; Dallas; Fort Worth; Detroit; two hiring centers in Chicago;
Denver, St. Louis, Milwaukee, San Diego, Calif.; Oakland, Calif.;
Santa Ana, Calif.; Long Beach, Calif., Los Angeles and two hiring
centers in Seattle.

   A school bus driver involved in an accident
that injured 45 people faces a charge of driving with a suspended
license, authorities said.
   Two students remained in a hospital Friday in serious but stable
condition, one day after a coal truck and the bus collided as the
bus pulled into a rain-drenched intersection in London, Ky.
   Enoch Smith, 33, is to appear in court Jan. 23 on a charge of
driving with a suspended license, London Police Chief Bill Smith
said.
   Enoch Smith had not been told that his license had been revoked
for failing to pay a $15 fee for a speeding ticket, said Laurel
County school Superintendent Joe McKnight, who said Smith had paid
his fine but not a reinstatement fee.
   No decision has been made on what action may be taken against
Smith, McKnight said.
   The accident happened at the entrance of North Laurel Junior High
School a few minutes after school let out. Truck driver John B.
Massey tried to swerve to avoid the bus, but he jackknifed and hit
it at an angle, police said.
   ``The (bus) driver pulled out in front of the truck,'' the police
chief said. ``No question about that.''
   Inspectors from the state departments of Transportation and
Education examined the 1987 bus early Friday at the school's garage.

<TEXT>
   Authorities in three states arrested 19
motorcyle club members or their associates early Friday on federal
racketeering, drug and firearms charges.
   A federal indictment names 29 members or associates of members of
the Pagan Motorcycle Club, including the group's national president
and vice-president, said U.S. Attorney Michael W. Carey. Authorities
have leads on the members not yet arrested, he said.
   Separate indictments name six non-club members as part of the
biker investigation, and it was not clear Friday afternoon how many
of the 19 were Pagan members.
   Carey said the Pagans, which has chapters throughout the East, is
considered among the most dangerous such clubs in the country.
   ``They've commited virtually any crime you can name,'' said Terry
Katz, a Maryland state police sergeant who has been involved in
operations against the Pagans for 13 years.
   More than eight kilograms of cocaine, 4,000 doses of LSD and
several ounces of methamphetamine were seized or bought during the
investigation, Carey said. Besides West Virginia, arrests were made
Friday in Ohio and Pennsylvania. And search warrants were issued in
Virginia in connection with the investigation.
   A federal grand jury in Charleston charged 29 people on Tuesday,
and the 85-count indictment was unsealed Friday, Carey said. The six
non-members were named in five indictments.
   Pagan membership stands at about 280, with 130 of that number in
prison, Carey said.
   Katz said the arrests would weaken the club, but he said
retaliation is possible.
   ``They have burned houses of witnesses, made threats. ... They
are a violent organization,'' Katz said. ``They react violently to
intimidation, and that's what they view this as.''
   Club President Daniel Delp of Alliance, Ohio, is charged with
racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, engaging in a continuing
criminal enterprise, conspiracy to distribute controlled substances,
interstate travel in aid of racketeering and distribution of
controlled substances. Delp is under arrest, according to a
spokesman for Carey.
   If convicted on all counts, Delp would face a life sentence and
fines of up to $7.75 million, Carey said.
   The vice president, Kenneth Blain McMillion, 41, of Charleston,
is charged with racketeering. McMillion would face 20 years in
prison and fines of up to $250,000 if convicted, Carey said.
McMillion is still at large.
   The 17 people who were arrested in the Charleston area probably
will be arraigned later this afternoon, a spokeswoman for the U.S.
Magistrate's Office said.
   Those arrested in other states will be arraigned at the nearest
magistrate court, she said. Members are being held by the U.S.
marshal in various locations.
   None of those arrested was available for comment until after
their court hearings, a spokesman for the U.S. Marshal's office in
Charleston said. Calls to three attorneys representing Pagans in the
Charleston area were not immediately returned. Others arrested had
not yet obtained counsel, according to the magistrate's office.

<HEAD>Easy Approval Seen For FAA-Controllers Contract</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union leaders on Friday predicted easy approval
of the first labor contract for air traffic controllers since
President Reagan fired 11,400 of them during a strike eight years
ago.
   The new three-year contract with the Federal Aviation
Admnistration will help ensure air safety, said R. Steve Bell,
president of the year-old National Air Traffic Controllers
Association.
   It gives controllers guaranteed breaks, limited immunity in
reporting system errors and participation in accident investigations
and some FAA decision-making.
   The tentative agreement signed late Thursday in Baltimore does
not cover salaries, which are set by Congress and range between
$19,000 and $55,000 annually.
   But Bell said new FAA-union ``professional councils'' would be
set up. He added that such labor-management cooperation could lead
to increased compensation, better working hours and more health
benefits.
   Both sides described the talks as evidence of vastly improved
relations between the FAA and its 13,000 controllers since the 1981
illegal strike that led to the bankruptcy and decertification of
their old union. More than half the controllers, who monitor and
control air traffic at 400 sites around the country, have joined the
new bargaining unit.
   ``It's a clear victory for both the FAA and the union,'' said
Bell, predicting that the agreement would be approved in a vote by
union members within the next few weeks.
   ``It represents a new spirit of cooperation between labor and
management at FAA, in sharp contrast to past problems,'' said FAA
spokesman John G. Leyden. He said talks with the new union went
smoothly, while the old union used to begin by asking for such
things as Olympic-sized swimming pools at each FAA site and other
costly benefits the government agency had no authority to provide.
   ``The new contract goes a long way toward helping airline
safety,'' Bell said in a telephone interview. ``What it contains is
a safety system contract between the FAA and controllers and with
the American flying public.''
   The contract would for the first time guarantee controllers a
break away from any controller duties after two hours monitoring air
traffic. Bell said controllers often are worked for two hours
straight and then switched to another duty without a break.
   The return of limited controller immunity, eliminated before the
1981 strike, would allow workers to report errors and system
deficiencies without fear of retribution, as long as they did not
involve negligence.
   ``The system, if errors were made and reported, tended to be
punitive in nature rather than preventative,'' said Bell. He said
management gave up none of its rights to discipline employees.
   The contract would also include controllers on boards that review
system errors and in groups that oversee technical development of
the system and evaluate facilities.
   ``The FAA was heretofore a little bit testy with allowing
controllers to get into the procedure aspect of the job,'' Bell said.
   The FAA also agreed to quickly release controllers from duties
for participation in accident investigation by the National
Transportation Safety Board. Controllers have not been included on
official investigative teams since the old contract, Bell said.

<HEAD>Grazing Fees Rising on Federal Land</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grazing fees on most federal land will be
raised by 21 percent March 1, partly because of higher beef prices,
two federal agencies said Friday.
   The Forest Service, part of the Agriculture Department, and the
Bureau of Land Management, part of the Interior Department, said the
new fee for grazing in national forests and on public land
administered by the bureau in the West will be $1.86 per animal per
month, up 32 cents from the previous year.
   By presidential directive, the two agencies use the same formula
to set grazing fees. The formula rises and falls with beef prices,
among other factors.
   F. Dale Robertson, chief of the Forest Service, said ``the prices
farmers and ranchers received for beef cattle increased by 9
percent, and private grazing land lease rates increased in most of
the states involved.''
   For grazing fees, the agencies consider one animal to be a horse

   Twenty-five years ago, Mississippi Ku Klux
Klan leader Tommy Tarrants firebombed and shot at civil rights
workers, blacks, Jews and law enforcement officers.
   Today, Tarrants is a Virginia businessman and Mennonite minister
who says he regrets his younger days. He now prays the people he
once terrorized will have lives free of violence and memories free
of bitterness.
   Tarrants has built a new life, removed from his life as a member
of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Mississippi. He married
into one of North Carolina's most prominent families and is the
father of two young daughters.
   He renounced his life in the Klan in 1970, and Tarrants says he
is now developing a private ministry to bring business people and
professionals to God.
   ``I have prayed for the people we hurt, we killed, we terrorized.
I have deep feelings for them and about those who helped me do it,''
the 42-year-old Tarrants said in a telephone interview this week
with the Jackson Daily News.
   As one of the inner circle of Mississippi Klan leaders during the
1960s, Tarrants said he participated in dozens of church and
residential bombings in Jackson, Meridian and Laurel.
   Tarrants was admitted to the Klan hierarchy immediately after the
June 1964 murders of three civil rights workers in Philadelphia,
Miss. His underground collection of friends and confidants _
including the Klan's Imperial Wizard, Sam Bowers, and Klansman Wayne
Roberts, both convicted of charges connected with the Philadelphia
killings _ read like the FBI's most-wanted list.
   Under FBI surveillance from 1964 to 1968, Tarrants was arrested
three times, once with Bowers. In June 1968, his Klan activity ended
in a violent shootout with FBI agents who converged on Tarrants as
he tried to firebomb the Meridian home of Meyer Davidson, a Jewish
businessman.
   His old friend Roberts, who turned FBI informant after his
conviction in the Philadelphia killings, leaked the bombing plans,
Tarrants said.
   After a trial in Meridian, Tarrants was sentenced to 30 years at
the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman for the attempted
bombing. He was paroled Dec. 13, 1976.
   ``I've put my past behind me, but there's still so much each of
us can do to make things right,'' said Tarrants, who wrote a book on
his experiences, ``The Conversion of a Klansman,'' published in 1979.
   With national attention focused on the Klan's reign of terror in
the recently released movie ``Mississippi Burning,'' Tarrants said
the nightmares are creeping back.
   ``I try not to think about it. Frankly, I don't know if I'll even
go see the movie, but I may,'' Tarrants said. ``My wife is
interested. She's curious. Last week, she bought all the magazines
that have written about it. She put them on the table, but I haven't
brought myself to read them.''

<HEAD>Bush's Choice For Energy Chief Raises Doubts In Oil Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush's choice of an energy
secretary with nuclear expertise but no experience in other energy
fields drew little praise and some concern Friday from industry and
environmental groups.
   In announcing his selection of Adm. James D. Watkins to head the
Energy Department, Bush said Thursday that Watkins would oversee the
daunting task of repairing the department's crippled nuclear weapons
complex. Safety and other problems recently forced the closing of
the country's only facilities producing tritium, a vital ingredient
for nuclear warheads.
   Watkins was trained in nuclear reactor engineering early in his
41-year Navy career, worked in the Naval nuclear office of the
now-defunct Atomic Energy Commission and later commanded a
nuclear-power submarine.
   But he has no professional experience in the conventional energy
areas, such as oil and natural gas, that are more commonly
associated with the Energy Department.
   ``You're touching me on my Achilles' heel,'' Watkins said in
response to a news conference question Thursday about his views on
how to shore up domestic oil prices.
   This admitted weakness, and Bush's clear interest in focusing on
problems in the nuclear weapons complex, has caused some concern
about how the new administration will address other energy issues
such as the growing U.S. dependence on foreign oil.
   ``Our initial reaction is definitely one of disappointment,''
said Tom Haywood, executive vice president of the North Texas Oil &amp;
Gas Association, a producers trade group. ``We had hoped for someone
who could come in knowing the domestic oil business,'' he said,
adding that he expected Watkins to be a ``quick study.''
   Bryan Jacobowski, an energy analyst at the Wall Street firm of
Paine Webber Inc., said oil industry executives had figured Bush
would pick ``somebody who was a bit more of an advocate'' for their
interests on Capitol Hill.
   In part, the selection of a military official to head energy
policy reflects a declining emphasis within the Energy Department on
civilian energy issues. In the current fiscal year the department is
spending 58 percent of its $15 billion budget on defense programs;
in 1982 the defense share was 28 percent.
   George H. Lawrence, president of the American Gas Association,
representing natural gas producers, hailed Watkins' ``proven
managerial skills'' and said his nuclear background will help in
solving the nuclear defense problems.
   But, he said, ``It is especially important that this national
security issue be handled skillfully ... so it does not become an
abiding distraction to other energy issues.''
   The natural gas industry's main concern about leadership in the
Energy Department is that it help win congressional approval to end
the remaining price controls on gas.
   Bush has pushed aside suggestions that oil executives need worry
about his choice.
   ``They've got a president of the United States that came out of
the oil and gas industry, that knows it and knows it well,'' he said
Thursday.
   Some analysts said the Watkins choice appeared to reflect a
relaxed attitude by Bush about the possibility of a new oil crisis
developing in the 1990s.
   ``It suggests the (Bush) administration doesn't see a major
problem in fossil fuels in the near future,'' said John Lichtblau,
executive director of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation,
which is supported by oil industry funds. He added that he disagrees
with this view and is concerned that if the OPEC cartel falls into
disarray again, oil prices could fall low enough to harm U.S.
security.
   Environmental groups also expressed mild concern about Watkins.
   Stephen Schwartz, of the Greenpeace environmental organization,
said he hoped the choice of Watkins ``does not reflect a decision to
place military production needs ahead of safety and the
environment.''
   Dan W. Reicher, an attorney for the environmental group Natural
Resources Defense Council, said his group was worried that nuclear
defense needs would get too much attention in an Energy Department
headed by a career military man.
   ``We are concerned that the appointment of Adm. Watkins signals
that cleaning up the bomb plants and developing a sound national
energy policy will continue to be sacrificed in the name of nuclear
weapons production,'' Reicher said.

<HEAD>New Non-Profit Group Seen to Restore Taliesin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Architect Frank Lloyd Wright's former home
at Taliesin needs a five-year, $16 million restoration and should be
opened as a tourist attraction, according to members of a state
commission studying the site.
   Commission members say they plan to recommend creation of a
non-profit corporation to undertake the restoration and oversee
operation of the landmark. Some state money would be involved, but
most would be raised from corporations, foundations and private
donors, commission members said.
   Taliesin, built in 1911 on 600 acres amid the rolling hills of
southwestern Wisconsin and declared a national landmark in 1976, now
is a school for architects.
   Commission members said they were optimistic the plan would win
the blessings of the Taliesin Fellowship, Gov. Tommy Thompson and
other state officials, and that restoration would start soon.
   The commission expects 200,000 to 250,000 people to visit
Taliesin annually. The site also would be available for national and
international conferences.
   ``There are some unknowns since there's quite a lot of logistics
involved in handling that many people,'' said Nicholas Muller, head
of the State Historical Society and a member of the study
commission. ``But the commission is not looking at the state as a
great pot of money.''
   There is some disagreement among commission members about how to
perform the restoration, said Marshall Erdman, a builder, architect
and former Wright student who heads the state commission.
   ``We want to do it right,'' he said. ``If we do it incorrectly,
there's no use doing it. On the other hand, we have to deal with
practicalities. And fortunately, unlike most restoration work, we
still have people who were there on the site, so we can save a lot
of effort and research.''
   Air conditioning, a new heating systems and better glass bonding
would make Taliesin comfortable year round, Erdman said.
   ``A lot of the things we're doing is the way it should have been
done had Mr. Wright had the resources and technology we have
today,'' Erdman said.

<HEAD>New Rule Would Deny Payment To Those Giving Substandard Care</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government agency that administers Medicare
proposed a new rule Friday to deny payment under the program to
hospitals and physicians that deliver substandard hospital inpatient
care.
   The new rule would enhance the government's ability ``to ensure
that Medicare beneficiaries receive high-quality care,'' said
William L. Roper, administrator of the Health Care Financing
Administration.
   In proposing the rule, the agency complies with instructions from
Congress.
   The agency said the rule was not expected to have a ``substantial
impact on a significant number of small entities or small rural
hospitals.''
   Under the rule, peer review organizations, composed of physicians
in each state and under contract to the Health and Human Services
Department to review health-care services funded under Medicare,
would be authorized to deny Medicare payments when substandard care
harms a patient or places the patient at high risk.
   The rule prohibits physicians and hospitals from charging
patients for services for which payment was denied because of
poor-quality care.
   When the review groups find that care is substandard but does not
result in harm to the patient or present imminent danger, Medicare
will pay for the claim but the review group will conduct a follow-up
review and work with the provider to correct the problem.
   Currently, when review groups find poor care being delivered,
they are limited to remedial action, which includes discussing the
case with the hospital or physician, intensifying future reviews and
recommending sanctions.

   A Philadelphia sculptor's life-size bust of
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. will be unveiled at the U.S. Embassy in
South Africa to mark the slain civil rights leader's birthday.
   Sculptor Zenos Frudakis said the bronze bust, commissioned by the
embassy in Pretoria, will be installed permanently in the embassy's
outdoor garden.
   A State Department spokeswoman in Washington, Mary Swan,
confirmed Friday that the embassy would hold an unveiling ceremony
Monday.
   The bust is derived from a model Frudakis sculpted as one of
three finalists in a competition held by the National Endowment for
the Arts for a portrait of King for the U.S. Capitol.
   In a statement issued in Philadelphia, Frudakis said Anglican
Bishop Desmond Tutu, black activist Winnie Mandela, U.S. Ambassador
Edward Perkins and other dignitaries are expected at the ceremony.
   The artist, whose other works include a sculpture of Philadelphia
Mayor W. Wilson Goode, said he considers the King bust his most
important work.
   ``I felt compelled to re-create someone who has been lost to all
of us _ to bring back alive those qualities of character which are
embodied in his features and recognized by the world he changed
forever,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bomb Kills Seven Minutes After Hezbollah March Passes By</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car bomb exploded in south Beirut on
Friday minutes after thousands of pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems marched
by in a demonstration against their Syrian-backed rivals. Seven
people were killed and 15 wounded, police said.
   The blast occurred on the sixth day of fierce fighting between
the mainstream Amal militia and the fundamentalist Hezbollah for
control of south Lebanon's Apple Province and the country's 1
million Shiites.
   The Mercedes-Benz blew up on Roweiss Street, a residential area
in the Bir el-Abed district. It touched off several fires and
blasted a crater in the street six feet deep and more than seven
feet across.
   The force of the explosion catapulted a flaming car onto a power
pole.
   ``A tongue of flame pierced the sky when the deafening blast
occurred. I was hurled a few yards off and then landed on my belly
with glass raining on me,'' said Issam Jaber, interviewed in front
of his tool shop.
   At least 10 cars were destroyed. More than 16 buildings suffered
considerable damage in a one-mile radius around the blast. At least
nine shops were destroyed.
   Broken power cables dangled on streets littered with glass shards
and uprooted pine trees.
   Police said the dead were civilians who lingered after thousands
of Hezbollah protesters passed by minutes before. Some demonstrators
carried placards and chanted slogans such as ``Death to America, the
Great Satan!'' and ``Death to Nabih Berri!''
   Berri heads Amal, which is backed by Syria.
   ``If it happened during the demonstration, it would have been a
much greater disaster with plenty of more casualties,'' said a
police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing regulations.
   Hezbollah gunmen shot in the air to clear a path for ambulances.
At one point they stopped a team of civil defense workers, beat five
of them, blindfolded them and then dumped them into the trunk of a
car and sped away.
   ``They are suspects,'' said one Hezbollah gunman, who refused to
give his name.
   Syrian troops in charge of security in Beirut's Moslem sector
watched but did not intervene.
   A Hezbollah statement said none of the party leaders or partisans
who took part in the demonstration was injured.
   No one claimed responsibility for the blast.
   Hezbollah militiamen claimed Berri was behind it, but an Amal
statement disclaimed involvement, calling the blast ``an intolerable
act of terrorism aimed at fanning the flames of dissension within
the Shiite community.''
   Hezbollah's parade was called to protest what the party termed
``the murderous military adventure'' by Berri to evict Hezbollah
from south Lebanon's Apple Province.
   Militiamen of the two factions battled Friday with mortars and
machine guns in and around the Apple Province village of Jbaa, but
none made territorial gains.
   Police said two civilians were killed and another three wounded.
   Jbaa is the key to a 9-square-mile enclave controlled by about
500 Hezbollah fighters. It extends south to the hamlets of Ein
Bouswar and Louwaizeh and east to wooded Mount Safi.
   Iran's Parliament speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani, called for an end
to the fighting. Rafsanjani, speaking in Tehran, said Hezbollah and
Amal ``are both committing murder, and the Islamic Republic is
disgusted.''

   Asians will be given a choice of nationalities
to check off on the 1990 census form, the Census Bureau announced
Friday.
   Bureau officials, politicians and members of the Asian community
have been debating whether to provide the checkoff on the forms or
simply to provide a blank space for Asians to specify their
nationality.
   The checkoff system was decided on at the request of the Asian
community, officials said. But an additional blank line will also be
included for people who do not fit into the suggested categories.
   Checkoff categories will be the same as those offered in 1980,
officials said. They were Japanese, Chinese, Filipino, Korean,
Vietnamese, Asian Indian, Hawaiian, Guamian and Samoan.

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tritium, a gas that strengthens nuclear bombs, is
a byproduct of Canada's nuclear power plants, but the United States
shouldn't look to the north for a way to ease a shortage caused by
problems in U.S. weapons plants.
   ``It would not be amenable,'' said Atomic Energy Control Board
spokesman Hugh Spence. ``In peacetime certainly it would not be
amenable. Certainly we would not countenance sales directly to the
weapons system.''
   Anti-nuclear activists allege that any exports to the United
States would be virtually impossible to track in their civilian or
military uses.
   ``Even if our tritium isn't used directly in military weapons
systems, which we suspect it will be, it will free up their scarce
supplies,'' Irene Koch of the Nuclear Awareness Project said in a
telephone interview.
   The Savannah River Plant in Aiken, S.C., the only U.S. source of
the radioactive isotope of hydrogen, is closed because of safety
problems. The U.S. Department of Energy has recommended building two
new production reactors, at a cost of $8.6 billion. Meanwhile, the
Defense Department needs to replenish the tritium, which decays at a
rate of 5.5 percent a year, in its warheads.
   The U.S. nuclear industry is based on light-water reactors, which
use water as a coolant and other materials as moderators _ slowing
the neutrons enough so they cause fission. Canada's 18 reactors use
heavy water _ in which hydrogen is replaced by the isotope deuterium
_ as coolant and moderator.
   One byproduct of the reaction is tritium, which also has some
commercial and industrial applications, including in emergency
lighting devices.
   ``Right now the plan is to remove the tritium and then store it
on site,'' Young said in a telephone interview. ``We still haven't
made that decision to sell any of it, let alone export any of it to
the U.S.''
   The question of exports came up in the debate over the plant 47
miles east of Toronto, ``mainly from the critics who oppose this,''
he said.
   ``It's very much an issue for us. It has been for a couple of
years,'' said Koch, whose group is pressuring the Ontario provincial
government to refuse permission for any tritium exports.
   The federal government also would have to license exports of
radioactive materials, and Spence said Canada has one of the world's
most stringest systems of safeguards against nuclear exports for any
military purposes.
   It requires countries with recognized nuclear capacities _ the
United States, Britain and France _ to agree that no Canadian
materials will be used for weapons. In general, other countries must
have ``full-scope safeguards'' to obtain Canadian materials, and
must allow international inspection of all nuclear facilities. India
was cut off in 1974.
   It also is recognized that exports for peaceful uses free a
supply for weapons systems, although that has not come up in any
debate, Spence said. ``I know the Americans know our safeguard
concerns and in many ways share them.''
   Washington has not approached the Canadian government for
tritium, he said. ``It really hasn't come up.''

   As his presidency draws to an end, Ronald
Reagan is naming top-level staff aides to various boards and
commissions.
   White House personnel director Robert Tuttle was appointed Friday
to the board of trustees of the Woodrow Wilson International Center
for Scholars in the Smithsonian Institution, bringing to four the
number of such appointments in the past two days.
   Reagan also named Mari Maseng, his communications director, to be
a member the National Council on Vocational Education and Alan
Michael Kranowitz, the White House assistant for legislative
affairs, to be a member of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council.
   On Thursday, Reagan named chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein to
the board of trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts for a term expiring Sept. 1, 1998. He also named
special assistant John Tuck to the board of visitors of the U.S.
Naval Academy for a term expiring at the end of 1991 and announced
the appointment of Rhett Dawson, who has headed the White House
administrative office, to the board of visitors of the U.S. Military
Academy, for a term expiring Dec. 30, 1991.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said at a briefing Friday,
``There are hundreds of organizations and groups that have been
established by the president or by Congress or by some authority, to
advise the government on a continuing basis. And it is true that the
president is appointing a number of senior staff people and others
to these commissions because they've done outstanding work and
they're outstanding people who have seen government close up.''
   Members of such boards and commissions typically receive nominal
salaries or fees and have travel and hotel accommodations paid when
they attend meetings.

   Most older Americans support a new national
health insurance program that pays the catastrophic costs of major
illness, according to a poll released Friday by the American
Association of Retired Persons.
   The new health insurance law, which took effect Jan. 1, will
cover extended hospitalizations and help pay high prescription-drug
bills. It will be financed by premiums paid by all Medicare
enrollees, a sore point among some retirees.
   The poll of 1,750 people age 45 and older found 71 percent
supported the program while 15 percent opposed it. Among the 657 who
were age 65 and older, 65 percent supported the program and 21
percent opposed it.
   AARP said the finding that concerns them most is that more than
half of those questioned said they were not familiar with the
program.
   ``There a great need to get the facts out,'' said John Rother,
AARP's director of legislation, research and public policy. ``Even
those familiar with it are in fact misinformed'' about aspects of
the program, he added.
   The 28-million-member AARP supports the catastrophic illness
program and has started a campaign to educate senior citizens about
its benefits.
   Some retirees are upset they will have to pay for coverage
whether they want it or not and say they could do better buying
private insurance.
   The major financing provision of the program has been the target
of most complaints. It requires everyone eligible for Medicare who
pays more than $150 in federal income taxes to pay an extra premium
based on the amount of tax they own.
   The maximum surtax on any person is $800 this year, or $1,600 for
a couple if both spouses are eligible. Such a couple would have
income of at least $70,000.
   Overall, 58 percent of those polled said they viewed the
supplemental premium based on tax liability as positive.
   However, a majority of those surveyed said they did not like
having only those over 65 pay for it. Overall, 52 percent viewed
this as a negative aspect of the program, compared with 42 percent
who said was it was positive.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said he was gratified by the poll
results and anticipates no change in the tax.
   ``It offers security and peace of mind to older Americans and the
vast majority of them understand and appreciate that,'' he said in a
statement.
   The poll was conducted by telephone Dec. 2-18. Results have a
margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points for the
entire group of 1,750 and 4 points for the subgroup of those age 65
and older.

   Hindus and Sikhs fought with guns and swords
Friday during a religious procession honoring two Sikhs executed for
the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandi, authorities and
witnesses said.
   Civil administrator N.R. Gupta said at least four people,
including a Sikh trapped in a burning truck, were killed. About 200
people were injured, and more than 200 shops were looted and set
ablaze, he said.
   The government of Jammu-Kashmir state imposed a curfew on the
northern city and ordered police to shoot violators.
   Police opened fire several times and used tear gas to try to stop
the fighting, but it continued until 1,000 army troops arrived more
than five hours later, Gupta said.
   Witnesses said the fighting started shortly after about 2,000
Sikhs left a temple on a procession in honor of Kehar Singh and
Satwant Singh, who were hanged last week and now are revered as
martyrs of the Sikh faith.
   Many carried pictures as the eight-mile procession moved through
a Hindu neighborhood, and a group of militant Hindus asked the Sikhs
to remove the pictures, the witnesses said. One Sikh pulled a dagger
and lunged at the Hindus, who retaliated, they said.
   Jammu, 40 miles north of Sikh-dominated Punjab state, has a
population of about 500,000. Of these, about 80,000 are Sikhs, about
300,000 are Hindus and the rest are Moslems.
   Kehar Singh and Satwant Singh were executed for the assassination
of Mrs. Gandhi, who was killed Oct. 31, 1984, in apparent
retaliation for an army raid she had ordered on the Sikhs' holy
Golden Temple.
   Sikh militants were using the temple as a base for their fight
for an independent homeland in Punjab state.
   The assassination caused anti-Sikh riots in many northern cities,
including Jammu. More than 2,700 people died, most of them Sikhs.
   Sikhs comprise 2 percent of India's 800 million people but are a
majority in Punjab. Sikh militants claim discrimination by Hindus,
who comprise 80 percent of the country's population.

<HEAD>They're Fighting For Tickets To The Texas Black Tie And Boots Ball</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Competition to go to the hottest inaugural week
party _ the Texas Black Tie and Boots Ball _ has led to a political
scrap over Sen. Phil Gramm's decision to give some of the $50
tickets to those contributing $1,000 to his re-election campaign.
   So intense is the fight for tickets that people have put ads in
newspapers. One man was offered a free trip to Europe if he
relinquished his tickets and others have reportedly scalped theirs
for $500 each.
   Described as an event where you can ``let your hair down, grab a
beer and kick your boots off,'' this ball is a big draw this year
because President-elect Bush, an adopted Texan, is expected to show
up with 5,500 other guests.
   Organizers initially planned for 4,500 people, but rented more
space at the Washington Hilton to accommodate demand.
   Unlike many events over the glittery inaugural week, the ball is
not sanctioned by the official inaugural committee.
   Instead, the bipartisan Texas State Society, made up of Texans or
would-be Texans, is hosting the Jan. 21 party as it has for the past
two inaugurations. Democratic Rep. Charles Stenholm is the society's
chairman.
   At the center of the controversy is Gramm, a first-term
Republican who is using the inauguration to raise money for his 1990
re-election campaign.
   For a $1,000 contribution, Gramm offered his supporters
membership in the Gramm Senate Advisory Board. During inaugural
week, board members are invited to a lunch with a Cabinet officer
and attend a reception with VIPs. They were also given tickets to
the ball, until supplies ran out, according to fund-raiser Brad
O'Leary.
   The inaugural package is expected to bring in between $100,000
and $150,000 for the senator, O'Leary said.
   O'Leary said he bought 300 tickets right after they went on sale
Dec. 14. At the request of the society, he and others who purchased
big blocks of tickets later returned 10 percent of them.
   Chino Chapa, Stenholm's spokesman, said Gramm's campaign was by
far the largest purchaser of tickets. Tickets were automatically
sent to the society's 3,000 members, while others were made
available by the society.
   Some of the criticism has come from Democrats upset that Gramm
has used to bipartisan ball as a way to make money. ``The black tie
and boots thing is indicative of the way Phil Gramm operates,'' said
Ed Martin, executive director of the Texas Democratic Party. ``It's
always Phil Gramm first,'' he said.
   Republicans have been more tempered, but Dan Flynn, a spokesman
for Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, holder of Bush's old congressional
seat, said it would have been ``totally unethical'' to resell
tickets at a higher price.
   Archer's office, which has been inundated with requests, bought
about 20 tickets and then sold them at the same price to
constituents, he said.
   ``A lot of folks from Texas can't understand why they can't get
in,'' said Ed Gillespie, an aide to Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas.
   Larry Neal, Gramm's spokesman, said the office had heard a lot of
complaints about the ball, but most of them came from Democrats. He
said it was ``not particularly surprising'' to find complaints
coming from the party that lost the election. Gramm was traveling in
Texas Friday and was not available for comment.
   Gramm's aides defended the senator's fund-raising. They said the
$1,000 contribution bought more than the $50 ticket, and about
two-thirds of the black tie and boots ball tickets were given to
people who contributed money to the campaign earlier.
   O'Leary said the society should have done a better job in
dividing up the tickets for what he said promised to be a ``cattle
show.''
   ``They wouldn't have had this problem except that people from New
York, Maine, Connecticut and all over want to come. They should have
limited it to people with a Texas driver's license.''
   ``Next time we will recommend imposing limits on the tickets you
can buy,'' Chapa said.
   Despite the ball's popularity, some, like Armey, are avoiding it.
``He can't stand wearing a black tie,'' Gillespie said, adding: ``He
doesn't drink ... He does his smoozing on the House floor.''

   Farmers planted 54.5 million acres of winter
wheat last fall for harvest in 1989, a 12 percent increase from 1988
and the most in four years, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following
year. It accounts for about three-fourths of the total U.S. wheat
output.
   Production was reduced last year by drought, and brisk export
demand has helped reduce stockpiles. With greater demand, prices
have risen substantially the past year.
   Also, farmers are being required to idle only 10 percent of their
wheat base acres for 1989 in order to qualify for government price
supports, compared with 27.5 percent previously.
   ``All states increased acreage from 1988 except Arizona, the
Dakotas, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey and Wyoming,'' the
department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its report. ``New
Mexico and Tennesee are unchanged.''
   In Kansas, the largest producer, wheat plantings jumped 22
percent to 12.4 million acres.
   Nationally, the 54.5 million acres of winter wheat planted for
1989 is the largest acreage since 57.8 million acres were planted
for the 1985 harvest, according to USDA records.
   ``Seeding of this year's crop kicked off in August in several
states,'' the report said. ``Progress moved along by varying
degrees, reaching about 97 percent as of Dec. 1. By mid-December,
seeding was finished except for parts of the Southeast, Arizona and
California.''
   In a supply-and-demand analysis, officials said the U.S. total
wheat stockpile on June 1, the beginning of the 1989-90 wheat
marketing year, could be whittled to around 534 million bushels,
less than half the 1.26 billion bushels in the June 1, 1988,
inventory. It was more than 1.82 billion bushels on June 1, 1987.
   Export subsidies and other government programs have helped boost
wheat sales to the Soviet Union, China and other foreign buyers.
Total shipments in 1988-89 are expected to be around 1.5 billion
bushels, more than double the 700 million bushels needed to cover
U.S. domestic food requirements.
   Meanwhile, wheat prices at the farm have risen to a predicted
range in the current marketing year of $3.60 to $3.75 per bushel, on
the average, compared with $2.57 in 1987-88 and $2.42 in 1986-87.
   A comparable situation has developed for some other grains hit by
last year's drought. Corn prices, for example, were forecast at an
average of $2.30 to $2.70 per bushel in the 1988-89 marketing year
that runs through August, compared with $1.94 last season and $1.50
in 1986-87.
   Another report showed the Dec. 1 inventory of corn at 7.07
billion bushels, down 28 percent from a year earlier. The wheat
inventory, at 1.71 billion bushels, was down 32 percent from Dec. 1,
1987.
   Soybean stocks as of Dec. 1 were reported at 1.37 billion
bushels, down 22 percent from a year earlier.
   A review of overall 1988 crop production showed relatively minor
adjustments in USDA's previously announced harvest figures, with the
exception of corn. Last year's corn harvest was reported at 4.92
billion bushels, up from 4.67 billion bushels estimated last
November.
   Even so, the 1988 corn harvest was down 30 percent from 1987
production, with the drought-reduced yield averaging 84.6 bushels
per acre, compared with the record level of 119.4 bushels per acre
in 1987.
   The 1988 harvest of all wheat was a decade low of 1.81 billion
bushels, down 14 percent from 1987, and soybeans last year totaled
1.54 billion bushels, 20 percent below 1987 production. Cotton
output, at 15.4 million bales, was up 5 percent from 1987 and was
the most in seven years.

   The West German finance minister said Friday
his government had ``some new information'' to link firms in his
country with the construction of a plant in Libya that the United
States says was designed to develop chemical weapons.
   But the West German official said criminal prosecution would
proceed only if there was ``complete evidence.'' Gerhard Stoltenberg
pledged after a one-hour meeting with Deputy Secretary of State John
C. Whitehead that ``whatever it takes to get information, it will be
followed.''
   Meanwhile, West German and U.S. experts held a second day of
meetings on the intelligence the Reagan administration has used to
support its claim that Libya was trying to develop chemical weapons
at the plant, some 60 miles southwest of Tripoli.
   ``We are trying to provide as much information as possible,''
Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman, said. He said the
talks at an undisclosed location would be ``useful and productive,''
but provided no other details.
   Separate British and Dutch investigations also point to an
attempt by Col. Moammar Gadhafi's country to develop chemical
weapons. Secretary of State George P. Shultz said last week the
Libyans had not reached the point of production.
   Stoltenberg, in a curbside news conference outside the
department, renewed allegations that West German firms had been
targeted for criticism by U.S. media.
   ``What we did not like in some American press comments,'' he
said, ``was to single out Germany because it is obvious that it
could have been a problem of quite a few other countries.''
   The finance minister said the United States and West Germany
should join in promoting international cooperation to prevent
technology transfers to countries which could produce chemical
weapons to endanger world security.
   Officials of the West German government last week registered
skepticism that the United States had evidence to link West German
firms to the plant, which Gadhafi said was producing pharmaceuticals.
   However, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Thursday in Bonn that
authorities had seized new documents that may show firms helped the
North African country build a chemical plant.
   On Friday, Hans Frey, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office in
Karlsrube, told The Associated Press there would be an investigation
into the Imhausen-Chemie company.
   Frey said the possible charge being investigated was ``a
violation of the export control law.'' He did not elaborate.
   Imhausen-Chemie has denied any connection to the Libyan plant.
   Stoltenberg said the evidence came from West German sources.
``There was no proof a week ago,'' he said, ``and now there is some
new information in the last days ... which could lead to criminal
prosecution.''
   But he said ``it's not a final decision... We must have complete
evidence (to prosecute). Whatever it takes to get information, it
will be followed.''
   Referring to the dispute with the United States, the West German
official said ``we have really made progress in understanding.''

<HEAD>Tass Doubts Own Quake Survivor Story</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 16th graf, ``Soviet TV ...'' with 3 grafs with more detail
on how Soviet press covered the story.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The official Tass news agency on Friday raised
serious doubts about a story it ran on the miraculous survival of
six men trapped in the rubble of a collapsed building for 35 days
after the Armenian earthquake.
   In an urgent dispatch headlined ``One Always Wants Miracles,''
Tass said it hadn't found a single eyewitness to confirm a Leninakan
resident's tale that he and five others survived for five weeks on
canned goods in a dark, cramped food cellar.
   ``Everyone wanted to believe in the Leninakan miracle,'' the news
agency said.
   ``Regrettably, we are unable so far to confirm with full
certainty the authenticity of the reports made by our Armenian
colleagues ... nor can we categorically deny them,'' it said.
   Tass, whose initials stand for the ``Telegraph Agency of the
Soviet Union,'' is run by the state and is used to distribute news
and offical proclamations of the government.
   In the years before President Mikhail S. Gorbachev instituted his
policy of greater openness, or ``glasnost,'' the Soviet press was
highly restricted in what it reported. Natural disasters and
accidents rarely found their way into the national press. Its
reporting on the devastating earthquake in Armenia, as well as other
recent disasters, has been unusually candid.
   Tass first ran the story Thursday, a day after the reported
rescue. In its dispatch Friday, it said it could not find the other
five survivors, the rescuers or any witnesses to the incident that
made headlines around the world.
   Officials gave up hope weeks ago of finding more survivors in the
Dec. 7 quake, which killed 25,000 people. They began bulldozing the
ruins to prevent decaying bodies from spreading disease.
   But Aikaz Akopyan, a 50-year-old electrician admitted to a
Yerevan hospital Thursday with pneumonia, offered Tass a detailed
report of his five-week entombment.
   Psychiatrists examined Akopyan and found him normal, and
reporters found acquaintances who confirmed Akopyan's identity and
former residence in the ruined apartment building, Tass said.
   ``Akopyan remembers the five young men perfectly well,'' Tass
said Friday. They said he suggested the other five survivors mut
have traveled to relatives in another village.
   But neighbors in the area of the ruined building told two
correspondents from the Soviet newspaper Izvestia that they knew
nothing of a rescue Wednesday.
   Leninakan City Council chairman E. Kirakosian walked down the
street with the Izvestia reporters Thursday and told them the last
survivors in the city were found Dec. 26, the newspaper said in its
Friday afternoon editions.
   Earlier attempts to find the rescuers were hampered by the fact
that there is still only one telephone line to Leninakan, according
to Armenpress, the Armenian news agency that is affiliated with Tass.
   Akopyan was quoted by Tass as saying the six survived because
they were buried in a cellar used to store canned vegetables, smoked
ham, stewed fruit and pickles. He said he sang and told stories in
the pitch-dark room to keep the others from going crazy.
   Soviet media leaped on the story. The evening news program
``Vremya'' interviewed Akopyan in his hospital bed Thursday night,
and Friday morning's Komsomolskaya Pravda published a large photo of
Akopyan on its back page, headlined, ``And still there are
survivors!''
   The Communisty Party daily Pravda ran the Tass report on page
three under a small headline, ``More than one month underground,''
and Moskovskaya Pravda offered the same article with the title,
``Freed from captivity in the rocks.''
   But Friday's Izvestia was skeptical. ``35 days under the
rubble?'' read the headline.
   Tass said Armenpress first heard of Akopyan's tale from Yuri
Tunyan, head of health and social security for the Armenian Council
of Ministers.
   ``The first thought which crossed the mind was, `It is
impossible,''' Tass said. But Tass correspondent Kirill Dibrova
interviewed Akopyan in the hospital, and believed him.
   Ashot Adomyan, deputy chief physician at Hospital No. 3, also
believes the story, the news agency said.
   Tass quoted the doctor as saying it is natural for a man trapped
in a basement for more than a month to develop pneumonia.
   In addition, Akopyan arrived at the hospital blindfolded.
Professional rescuers would have bandaged the eyes of a person
trapped in the dark for five weeks before taking him into daylight,
Tass said.
   But it said rescue authorities in Leninakan could not confirm
Akopyan's story, leaving disturbing questions.
   ``Why, for instance, a day after the miraculous salvation, was it
possible to locate only Aikaz Akopyan in a Yerevan hospital?'' the
news agency asked. ``Where is the survivor's sister, who failed to
appear at the hospital on Friday, though she promised to do so?''
   In an intriguing twist, Tass quoted an acquaintance of Akopyan
named Siranush Nersesyan, who said she heard in the housing
administration in Leninakan on Jan. 9 _ two days before Akopyan says
he was rescued _ that people probably were still alive in the
basement of that building.
   In its story Friday, Tass recalled a report earlier this month on
French TV that 17 earthquake victims had survived for weeks in a
wrecked bakery by eating grain and melted snow. That report was
subsequently denied by rescue officials.
   ``A host of other news items from Armenia, truthful and invented,
sell on the world news market.'' Tass said. ``It is understandable:
One wants so much to believe in the miracle of six people being
saved on the 35th day after the quake.''

<HEAD>Two Journalists Lied On Applications, Got Jobs At Heathrow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two British journalists said Friday they got jobs
as airplane cleaners at Heathrow Airport using fake applications and
were able to wander on and off jets where they could easily have
planted bombs.
   One of them, a London Weekend Television researcher, said he left
a package on a Japan Airlines flight without being challenged.
   The other, Daily Express reporter Graham Dudman, said he was
hired by Skyliner Services after a 10-minute interview and found
``alarming holes'' in Heathrow security three weeks after a bomb was
planted on Pan Am Flight 103.
   The two journalists were not working together when they got their
airport jobs. The British Airports Authority, which operates
Heathrow, refused comment.
   Dudman said he decided to apply at the airport after a bomb blew
up Flight 103 on Dec. 21, killing all 259 people on board and 11
people on the ground in the Scottish town of Lockerbie.
   The New York-bound flight originated in Frankfurt and switched to
a bigger plane at Heathrow.
   Dudman said he was hired by Skyliner Services, a private cleaning
contractor, after an interview Jan. 4. He said his application,
which contained many lies, was never checked. Dudman said he
received a pass that allowed him access to all areas of the airport,
and he started work Jan. 9.
   ``As a part-time aircraft cleaner, it enabled me to board 12
jetliners on any one of which I could have planted a bomb under a
seat or in a locker,'' he said.
   ``I gained unchallenged access to luggage containers and the
cabin and flight decks of trans-Atlantic airlines where at times I
was alone and unsupervised,'' he said.
   Dudman said he carried bulky packages and a camera past security
posts and was never stopped or questioned, even when he took
photographs on the airfield. Several photographs appeared in the
paper, including one that showed the reporter posing near some Pan
Am luggage.
   ``Each member of the cleaming staff I spoke to about security
said they had never seen any and expressed amazement there had been
no clampdown after Pan Am,'' Dudman said.
   London Weekend Television said researcher Stewart Morris was
hired by Fernley Aeroclean, using a fake name. It said he planted a
parcel on Japan Air Lines Flight 402.
   Morris said he wasn't searched when boarding planes or supervised
while working and could have planted the parcel anywhere, except
possibly TWA which ran a metal detector over the cabin after the
cleaners had finished.
   Paul Ross, a reporter for London Weekend Television, said after
he received a call from Morris, he bought a ticket on Flight 402,
retrieved the package from under a window seat during the flight and
took it into the cockpit without challenge.
   ``It could have contained a bomb, a gun or a knife,'' he said.
``I could easily have blown up or hijacked the plane.''
   London Weekend Television said the incident was filmed and would
be shown Sunday, subject to approval by the Independent Broadcasting
Authority.
   After Dudman's disclosure, Heathrow's managing director, Alan
Proctor, announced that Heathrow had withdrawn security passes for
staff at Skyliner.
   Transport Secretary Paul Channon ordered the British Airports
Authority to tighten security to ensure no one had unsupervised
access to aircraft or checked baggage in restricted areas unless
they had held an airport pass for at least six months.
   Skyliner called the government's action ``a very harsh decision
because procedures for security are the same with us as they are for
all the other companies at Heathrow.''

<DATELINE>MARSHALL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man being sued by the state for refusing
to rent to an unmarried couple is challenging the state Human Rights
Act, which he says violates his religious beliefs forbidding sex
before marriage.
   ``The Bible clearly states this is wrong,'' Layle French, 32,
said Thursday from his farm outside Marshall, in southwestern
Minnesota. ``I live with the Bible as my guide.''
   French said the Human Rights Act, which protects Minnesotans from
various forms of discrimination, violates his First Amendment right
to freedom of religion and is unconstitutional.
   The dispute began last February when Susan Parsons of Marshall
sought to rent a house owned by French. Parsons and French entered
into an agreement in which Parsons told French she intended to live
with her fiance and that his two children would stay with thempart
of every month, according to a Human Rights Department complaint.
   Two days later, French told Parsons he had changed his mind and
would not rent to her. French said he told her, ``Why don't you get
married and I'll let you rent it.''
   He and his attorney, James R. Anderson, filed a written response
Friday with the state attorney general's office to the lawsuit filed
Dec. 7 by the state Department of Human Rights.
   An administrative law judge is scheduled to hear the case April
11.
   Anderson said the law's lack of a provision for a jury trial
makes it unconstitutional.
   Human Rights Commissioner Stephen Cooper said juries do not hear
human rights cases because juries are supposed to reflect the
society's majority, and human rights laws are designed to protect
the minority.
   He said French was trying to control the lives of his tenants.
   ``Landlords often have exaggerated ideas of what their rights
are,'' Cooper said. ``They're trying to invent a constitutional
right to say, `I have the right to tell you what to think.'''
   French said he believes by living together the couple would
violate a little-known state statute that outlaws sexual intercourse
between unmarried adults.
   ``We contend it's a very schizophrenic state that on the one hand
outlaws fornication and on the other compels cohabitation,'' said
Anderson. ``It's against his religious convictions to rent on that
basis.''
   He conceded that the misdemeanor sex statute was rarely enforced
although still on the books.
   Cooper said French had no evidence Parsons and her fiance would
violate the law forbidding sex before marriage.
   Phone calls to Parsons' home for comment Friday went unanswered.

<HEAD>Official Says Lost Missile Part Would Be Valuable To Soviets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A flight data recorder missing from a 1987
long-range nuclear missile test would provide valuable information
to any U.S. adversary that might have recovered the device, an
Energy Department official said Friday.
   Although the recorder contained no classified information, ``it
is valuable,'' said Chris Sankey, a department spokeswoman. She
declined to describe the specific value of the recorder to the
Soviet Union or any other country.
   The Pentagon acknowledged earlier this week it was investigating
the loss of the recorder and said there was a possibility it may
have been found by the Soviets.
   Defense officials also said the recording device, which would
contain such information as the acceleration and velocity of the
missile during flight, was not classified. But a Pentagon source
indicated the data would be valuable to a U.S. adversary since the
missile was being tested under realistic conditions.
   ``Wouldn't you like to get your hands on that?'' asked the source.
   Sankey said a search for the device was continuing jointly by the
departments of defense and energy but there was no clear evidence it
had fallen into Soviet hands.
   The Energy Department is responsible for building and testing the
Pentagon's nuclear warheads. During test flights the missiles carry
a dummy warhead and not an actual nuclear weapon, although the rest
of the missile contents are real.
   Ms. Sankey said only the flight date recorder and ``some minor
debris'' were lost during the U.S. recovery of the Minuteman 2
missile that was launched July 7, 1987 from California toward
Kwajalein Atoll in the western Pacific Ocean.
   She said this was the first time that a missile's flight data
recorder had been lost in a test flight.
   ``It doesn't pose a loss of any technology for the United States,
but obviously there are a lot of things unclassified that we don't
want non-allied countries to have,'' Ms. Sankey said.

   The Associated Press, in a report on deductions

   The Internal Revenue Service considers scientology fees
non-deductible personal expenses, but appellate courts for the 2nd,

<TEXT>
   U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady will
meet with cabinet members from six major allies to prepare for a
major gathering on Third World debt, West German Finance Minister
Gerhard Stoltenberg said Friday.
   The ``Group of Seven'' includes West Germany, Japan, Britain,
France, Italy and Canada. Their ministers of finance and the heads
of their central banks meet at irregular intervals to try and bring
their economic policies closer together and coordinate policy on the
dollar and other currencies.
   Robert Levine, a spokesman for the U.S. Treasury, said no
decision has been made on the meeting. Support for it has now also
been voiced by Nigel Lawson, the British chancellor of the
exchequer, who saw Brady earlier this week.
   The presidents of seven major Latin American debtor countries
will be meeting in Caracas Feb. 2 at the inauguration of Carlos
Andres Perez as president of Venezuela.
   Perez and the recently inaugurated President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari of Mexico have taken the lead in urging relief from the debt
burden that has resulted in net payments of $20 to $30 billion a
year from poor countries to richer ones.
   Venezuela, one of the most regular with its payments, at length
joined many of the other debtor governments and suspended payments
of principal on most of its $30.3 billion debt on Dec. 31. There
have been reports that Perez is considering a stop on interest as
well.
   Dan Quayle, who will be inaugurated next week as vice-president,
will represent the United States at the inauguration.
   Latin American countries owe more than $440 billion of the $1.3
trillion of Third World debt. Brazil, Mexico and Argentina are the
biggest Third World debtors, with much of the money owed to U.S.
banks.
   In April, representatives of 151 countries, including many
cabinet members, will be in Washington for a semi-annual meeting of
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The debt and how
to reduce it will be major topics there.
   The seven governments try to coordinate their buying and selling
of currencies to keep the prices as stable as possible. Stoltenberg
said that would continue while plans are worked out by the Bush
administration to reduce the U.S. budget deficit, a goal strongly
urged by the allies.

<HEAD>Malpractice Settlements Reach $5.3 Million In Bone Peg Cases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four medical malpractice suits
against a doctor who replaced patients' spinal discs with bone taken
from cadavers have been settled for $5.3 million, said lawyers for
the plaintiffs.
   Aaron Schneider, an orthopedic surgeon, used a garden hose to
wash the bone pegs cut from pelvic bones of cadavers at the Pinellas
County morgue, after getting permission from next of kin, lawyers
said. He then stored the bone pegs in his kitchen freezer, they said.
   Three other malpractice suits against Schneider are pending.
   The latest settlement of $975,000 was reached Tuesday, 90 minutes
into the testimony from the first witness during the trial of a suit
brought by Dolores Nelson, 47, of St. Petersburg.
   Her lawyers said she suffered crippling pain and a severe loss of
mobility because of the procedure.
   ``Nobody that I know uses this procedure,'' testified Dr. Ronald
B. Greene, an orthopedic surgeon from the University of
Pennsylvania's medical school.
   Schneider's insurer, Florida Patients Compensation Fund, agreed
to settle while Greene was testifying.
   In earlier court proceedings, Schneider denied he committed
malpractice, but he declined to comment after the settlement.
   The procedure is not experimental but is considered difficult and
requires extensive training, said Miami lawyer Larry Stewart, who
represented Mrs. Nelson.
   Schneider performed the operation 107 times on 58 people, and his
own records showed a success rate of 24 percent, said another lawyer
for Mrs. Nelson, Larry Bianchi.
   Schneider told Mrs. Nelson, who injured her back in a 1981 fall,
that replacing a disc with a bone peg had a 90 percent chance of
alleviating her pain, according to court papers.
   Mrs. Nelson's pain, however, worsened after the operation at
Humana-Sun Bay Community Hospital in St. Petersburg, and she
sustained nerve injury, the suit said.
   She underwent two more operations, one using more bone pegs from
a cadaver and the other using bone chisled from Mrs. Nelson's hip.
In the end, she had 14 different bone pegs hammered in and nine
chisled out, the suit said.
   The hospital also was named in the suit but was dropped from the
case Monday after agreeing to a small settlement, that was not
disclosed.
   Prior settlements reached in the last six months have ranged from
$247,500 to $2,062,000. Three more cases are set for trial later
this year.
   The Florida Department of Professional Regulation has no public
record of any investigation or discipline involving Schneider, a
spokesman said.

<HEAD>Sources Say DOE Put Accelerator Report `On Ice''</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Energy held back for several
months a report that concluded there was a cheaper, quicker and
safer way to produce tritium for nuclear weapons than building a new
production reactor, sources familiar with the report said Friday.
   A copy of a draft summary of the report obtained by The
Associated Press said a linear accelerator could produce enough
tritium to meet all U.S. weapons needs.
   The report, which still has not been released, was prepared by
scientists at the department's Brookhaven and Los Alamos national
laboratories and the Westinghouse-Hanford Co., a department
contractor based at the Hanford nuclear reservation in Washington
state.
   The draft summary was dated August 1988, a month after the
department had recommended construction of two new production
reactors and at a time when there was deepening concern about the
safety and reliability of the entire weapons complex, particularly
the tritium-producing reactors at Savannah River in South Carolina.
   The sources, who asked not to be identified, said Friday that
department officials were worried that release of the report would
provide further ammunition for critics of the department's decision
to build new reactors.
   They also said officials feared the report could cause problems
at a time when the department was struggling to get its defense
production programs back on track.
   The sources said the department wanted the report held until
after the election and the new administration took office.
   ``I think the words were `put it on ice,''' said one source at
the Hanford reservation familiar with the report. ``They wanted to
hide it under a rug.''
   Another source, who worked on the report, said that as word of
the study started to seep out to the scientific community, there
were subtle suggestions to scientists at Los Alamos and Hanford that
they not discuss it.
   The source also said the report had yet to receive a fair hearing
from the Energy Department and that those who have seen it at the
department have been skeptical about its conclusions.
   Chris Sankey, a department spokeswoman, denied that the
department had been holding the report.
   ``We've not directed any such effort to put such a report on
hold,'' she said. ``To my knowledge the department has not formally
reviewed and therefore is not prepared to discuss this particular
proposal.
   ``I would point out that pursuance of other technologies to meet
long-term national security requirements is consistent with the
objectives of our national laboratories and contractors.''
   Ms. Sankey had said earlier that the department's Energy Research
Advisory Board looked briefly at the idea of using an accelerator to
produce tritium, but concluded that the technology was not ``mature
enough to provide new production capacity.''
   An accelerator is essentially a long tunnel in which subatomic
particles are whipped at high speed until they crash into a target,
in this case lithium clad in aluminum. The resulting collision
produces tritium, a radioactive gas used in nuclear warheads.
   The draft report said that an accelerator would produce far less
radioactive waste, would not operate at the high pressures and
extreme temperatures and ``should be more acceptable to the public''
than a nuclear reactor.

   Mayor Annette Strauss on Friday announced her
candidacy for a second term as the leader of the nation's
seventh-largest city, a day after a mayoral commission released its
plan to stem racial tensions.
   ``Dallas is on the move again,'' said Mrs. Strauss, 64, the
city's first elected woman mayor. ``We've regained the momentum of
the '60s, '70s and early '80s.''
   The mayor said she has worked hard to promote the city as a good
place to do business.
   ``Dallas is the best place anywhere for businesses to succeed,''
she said, but conceded that Dallas has been losing tax base to its
suburbs.
   ``At the top of my list of priorities are fighting crime and
drugs and economic development, which I believe are inextricably
tied together.''
   The second year of her first two-year term as mayor was one of
the most violent in the city's history. Five Dallas police officers
were killed and the city recorded a record number of homicides.
   She said progress has been made toward easing racial tensions and
praised the work of Dallas Together, a 76-member commission she
appointed to study race relations in the wake of the police
shootings and a dispute over the role of the Dallas Police Citizens
Review Board.
   The commission issued a report Thursday that recommended the
appointment of a charter review committee to study the number and
composition of city council districts. Dallas' City Council is now
comprised of the mayor, two at-large members and eight district
members.
   Expensive campaigns keep many people from running for city
office, Dallas Together said. Mrs. Strauss spent about $1.2 million
on her mayoral race in 1987, but she said she would not spend that
much for the May 6 election.
   She is the only announced candidate for the post.
   Mrs. Strauss served two terms as an at-large City Council member
and defeated Fred Meyer in a runoff for mayor in 1987. The
incumbent, Starke Taylor, did not run.
   A public relations consultant, Mrs. Strauss has been active in
Dallas civic and performing arts organizations for more than 20
years.

<TEXT>
   The government on Friday
applauded a Pentagon report calling this country's leading
anti-apartheid group a terrorist organization.
   But the government also said it was confused by a report released
by another U.S. agency with a contradictory view.
   The Defense Department report, released Wednesday, listed the
outlawed African National Congress among 52 terrorist organizations
worldwide.
   ``As far as the South African government is concerned, the
Pentagon report correctly analyzes terrorism,'' said Foreign
Minister Pik Botha.
   However, the U.S. Information Service in Pretoria released a
statement from the State Department in Washington that contradicted
the Pentagon report.
   ``The U.S. government has not determined that the ANC is a
terrorist organization,'' said the statement prepared by the State
Department's Africa Affairs Bureau.
   The State Department supported the ANC's aims of ending apartheid
and establishing a democracy, but it disagreed with the ANC's use of
violence, the statement said.
   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the
26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools
and health services.
   Botha described the State Department statement as ``somewhat
confusing.'' He added, ``Nevertheless, the State Department
acknowledges that the ANC's (violent) methods are unacceptable, and
this is the decisive issue.''
   The Pentagon said its booklet, which included a foreword by
President-elect George Bush, was prepared as a reference work _ not
as a policy statement.
   The booklet has prompted headlines in South African newspapers
and angry condemnations of the United States by some anti-apartheid
activists and organizations.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize
laureate who says he supports the African National Congress' goals
but opposes violence, said he was ``shocked and dismayed'' by the
Defense Department report.
   In Washington, a Pentagon spokesman said the group was included
in the book because authorities wanted to warn Americans of the
danger from the ANC and other organizations around the world. The
spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Jim Kudla, said the book had been ``fully
coordinated'' with the State Department.
   But within the State Department, counterterrorism officials
disagreed with professional diplomats, who wrote the statement
contradicting the the Pentagon report and who are concerned with
maintaining ties to South Africa's black majority.
   The South African government banned the African National Congress
in 1960, and the group began a sabotage campaign one year later.
There have been 180 bombings in South Africa during the 31-month
state of emergency, killing 35 people and injuring at least 665 of
all races.
   The government says it will not negotiate with the group unless
it renounces violence. The congress says it had no alternative but
to take up arms after it was banned as a peaceful organization.

   Eight leaders of Montenegro's
government resigned Friday, two days after the central republic's
Communist Party leaders were forced out by growing unrest over the
region's faltering economy.
   It was the first time the entire government and party leaderships
of one of Yugoslavia's six constituent republics had stepped down.
   The Montenegrin Parliament on Friday accepted the resignations of
the six-man state presidency but voted to keep it in a caretaker
capacity until new elections were held.
   It also accepted resignations of the republic's representative in
the collective nine-man federal presidency and of its speaker,
Velisav Vuksanovic.
   The state news agency Tanjug reported later that the Parliament
also decided to call early elections in Montenegro. A final decision
on that matter will be made Jan. 26, Tanjug said.
   On Wednesday, the party's central committee formally accepted the
resignation of its ruling Politburo and named a interim leadership
to prepare for an extraordinary party congress.
   Yugoslavia's federal government, six republic governments and two
autonomous provinces each are run by a party presidium, a state
presidency and a government. The presidencies, headed by chairmen,
mostly have formal functions subordinate to the party.
   Montenegro's government, in charge of implementing economic
policies, already resigned after mass protests last October.
   The ouster of the entire Montenegrin ruling elite came after more
than 120,000 people demonstrated earlier this week in Titograd, the
region's capital, demanding the leadership step down because of the
disastrous state of the region's economy.
   ``The current mass dissatisfaction among the workers, students
and young people is due to a large extent to the difficulties faced
by the country as a whole,'' said Bozidar Tadic, vice-president of
the Montenegrin Parliament, in his keynote speech which was
broadcast live on national television.
   Montenegro's representative on the federal presidency, Veselin
Djuranovic, said his decision to step down ``was motivated by a
sense of responsibility for the economic situation ... and in the
expectation that it will help alleviate the crisis.''
   Montenegro, Yugoslavia's smallest republic and one of its
poorest, has been particularly hard hit by the protracted national
economic crisis, characterized by a 250 percent inflation rate, a
$21 billion foreign debt and 12 percent drop in living standards in
1988 alone.
   The average monthly salary in the republic amounts to the
equivalent of $80, and unemployment has soared after the closing of
several unprofitable enterprises previously subsidized through
federal funds.

   Diplomats from the tiny African nation of
Rwanda collected more parking tickets per car than any other U.N.
mission in the city where the world body makes its home.
   Data released Friday by New York's Parking Violations Bureau show
the five cars of the East African nation's mission received 307
summonses in the first six months of 1988. The bureau said each car
collected an average of 10.2 tickets a month.
   Sudan, Bahrain, the Ivory Coast and Seychelles rounded out the
list of the top five parking scofflaws, according to bureau figures.
   Each of Sudan's five cars was ticketed an average of 8.47 times
per month, Bahrain's three vehicles each got 7.83 tickets a month,
the Ivory Coast's 13 vehicles each got 6.96 tickets, and Seychelles
with one car collected six.
   Figures for the last half of 1988 are not yet available.
   Consular and U.N. diplomats hold diplomatic immunity and thus
cannot be compelled to pay parking tickets. Few ever do, and the
Parking Violations Bureau does not try to collect the millions in
unpaid fines.
   New York parking tickets cost $10 to $40, depending on the
offense.
   The Soviet Union, with 110 vehicles, did not even make the list
of the top 20 offenders. The U.S. Mission does not issue diplomatic
plates to its employees, and did not appear on the list.
   The Parking Violations Bureau turns its list over to the New York
City Commission for the United Nations and Consular Corps, which
serves as liaison between the city and the foreign diplomatic
community.
   Officials in that commission, headed by Gillian Martin Sorensen,
talk to the worst offenders and have achieved some success in
reducing the number of offenses.
   The total number of parking tickets went down from 153,784 in
1978 to fewer than 65,000 in 1985, even though assigned diplomatic
parking spaces in midtown Manhattan were cut by 40 percent,
according to Mrs. Sorensen's office.

<HEAD>``British Coup'' Star Says He Is His Characters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ask Ray McAnally what he thinks of the people he
portrays so memorably, and the Irish actor is lost for words. His
job, he says, is to honor his characters, not to judge them.
   ``The character is me; I see the world that he sees,'' says the
62-year-old actor, who can be seen on Masterpiece Theater on PBS on
Sunday playing fictional Prime Minister Harry Perkins, a socialist
who is unseated by his own uppercrust secret service.
   Written by Alan Plater and directed by Mick Jackson, it will air
in two parts _ Sunday from 9 to 10 p.m. EST and Monday, 9 to 11 p.m.
EST.
   It's McAnally's second recent PBS series, following his starring
role as ne'er-do-well Rick Pym in John Le Carre's ``A Perfect Spy.''
   Set in 1990s Britain, ``Coup'' shares the paranoiac,
conspiratorial tone of such recent British films and TV series as
``Defense of the Realm'' and ``Edge of Darkness.''
   It is rooted in a long-standing, real-life conspiracy theory _
that right-wingers in the British secret service plotted to oust
Harold Wilson and his Labor Party government in the '70s.
   Adapted from a novel by Chris Mullin, a Labor lawmaker, ``Coup''
is a satire in which a Labor prime minister outrages his opponents
by telling the truth to the press and honoring his election pledges.
   Perkins' downfall comes from keeping a promise to remove U.S.
military bases, and turning to Moscow for aid rather than allowing
Britain to remain ``an aircraft carrier for the United States.''
   As the right-wing press howls for his blood, the secret service
sets out to discredit him by concocting a phony bank account in his
name and digging up an ancient love affair.
   The series invites debate, but McAnally keeps his distance. An
Irish resident who has never voted in a British election, he tries
to get under Perkins' skin without evaluating him.
   ``My job is not to make decisions about politics (but) to create
the human being,'' McAnally said in a phone interview. ``If I were
playing (British Prime Minister) Maggie Thatcher, I'd vote for
Maggie Thatcher.
   ``When I play Harry, I'm in his shoes. He feels that the world
needs changing, that the values society holds need to be changed.''
   McAnally's strength is his uncanny ability to become his
character, whether as the polished papal ambassador in ``The
Mission,'' or as the roughhewn Ulster work boss in ``Cal.''
   The Perkins role required a distinctly south Yorkshire accent
which he honed to perfection by spending five months in the pubs and
steel foundries of Sheffield.
   Of scripts, he says: ``I draw no massive, cosmic, global
conclusions, but simply take every line in detail.''
   McAnally has rarely been out of work since making his
professional debut in his native County Donegal at age 16. He has
worked closely over five decades with Dublin's Abbey Theater in more
than 150 plays, classic and modern, as both an actor and a director.
   Movie work has ranged from ``Shake Hands With the Devil'' with
James Cagney to ``The Fourth Protocol'' with Michael Caine. He most
recently appeared on London's West End stage last season playing
George Bernard Shaw alongside Sir John Gielgud in ``The Best of
Friends.''
   Roland Joffe's movie ``The Mission'' made him a star, a status he
accepts with ambivalence: ``I'm still, thank God, quite anonymous.''
   Married with four children, McAnally says he was first drawn to
acting at age 6, and sees it as ``a vocation, not a career.''
   ``This is where I belong,'' he said. ``A lot of people go into
the business because they think it's going to give them something.
That, I think, can be disastrous because they may not get what
they're looking for.''
   McAnally will be seen later this year as the lawyer Jaggers in a
new TV adaptation of ``Great Expectations.''

<TEXT>
   U.S. 6th Fleet forces are conducting routine
exercises in the Mediterranean, a spokesman said Friday.
   The maneuvers, code-named National Week, are being held in
international waters and air space, said Lt. Ray Kempisty.
   ``National Week is a routine, previously scheduled exercise that
has been held once or twice a year since 1967,'' he said.
   The maneuvers began Wednesday, a week after U.S. Navy jets shot
down two Libyan warplanes over the Mediterranean. Libya's ambassador
to the United Nations, Ali A. Treiki, has called the operations a
provocation.
   Tensions were high even before the jet downing, as Washington
raised the possibility of a military strike against an alleged
chemical weapons factory near Tripoli.
   Defense officials said the exercises were taking place well away
from Libya and that Washington had canceled a missile-firing
exercise in the central Mediterranean north of Libya.
   Kempisty said the exercises are to end Tuesday.
   He said the maneuvers are designed to ``train the incoming
carrier battle group in Mediterranean operations.'' He provided no
other details.
   A 13-ship battle group headed by the aircraft carrier Theodore
Roosevelt sailed into the Mediterranean early Wednesday, joining the
carrier John F. Kennedy and its support ships.
   Defense officials in Washington said Wednesday that the two
carrier battle groups would participate in joint operations for a
few days before the Kennedy sails for home.
   The Roosevelt is accompanied by six destroyers, two cruisers, a
frigate, an ammunition ship, an oiler and a repair ship. The Navy
said about 15,000 sailors and Marines were with the carrier group.
   A Marine amphibious group accompanying the Theodore Roosevelt has
not yet entered the Mediterranean, Kempisty said.

   A World War II bomb was found Friday in
a quarry outside the port city of Plymouth, and residents of nearby
Brixton village were evacuated pending the arrival of an army bomb
squad, police said.
   No one was allowed within one mile of the site.
   Plymouth residents said they thought the 600-pound bomb marked,
``1941'' and ``Rhine,'' was one of two dropped by a German aircraft
to lighten its load as it was chased by fighter planes.
   Plymouth, in southwestern England, has a naval dockyard and was
heavily bombed during World War II. Wartime bombs and unexploded
anti-aircraft shells are found regularly.
   A 500-pound bomb was found in east London's old docklands in
November.
   Authorities evacuated hundreds of people, blocked streets and
halted air traffic and construction work until the bomb could be
defused.

<HEAD>State Board of Education Adopts Evolution Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG WILLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The California Board of Education on
Friday unanimously adopted a new policy statement intended to
strengthen the teaching of evolution in the state's 7,125 public
schools.
   Fundamentalist church leaders criticized the new policy, which
was adopted as a guideline for classroom teachers and for textbook
publishers, and said they will urge local school boards throughout
the state to interpret the policy to allow teachers or students to
question evolution.
   A key provision of the policy statement specifies that only
theories based on factual evidence should be taught in science
classes, while theories based on religious belief ``are appropriate
to the History-Social Science and English-Language Arts curricula.''
   Associate State Superindentent Francie Alexander described
adoption of the new policy statement as ``a very significant step''
toward eliminating the hesitancy of some local schools to teach
evolution in science classes when faced with opposition from church
leaders.
   ``It makes it explicit what is science and what is religion. That
means evolution is going to be taught as the main theory of origins.
We have not had anything of this clarity before,'' she told
reporters after the board's vote.
   But the Rev. Louis Sheldon of Anaheim, president of the
Traditional Values Group, which he said includes 6,000 California
churches, said the principal weakness of the new policy is that it
is not clear how students or teachers may question evolution theory.
   ``Is there still a door of opportunity through which a critical
view of evolution can be raised? We do not see it precisely in the
language. We're kind of in a no man's land,'' he told reporters
after the vote.
   Sheldon said his group isn't advocating the teaching of the Bible
creation theory in science classes, but only wants to ``keep the
door open'' to allow discussion of other theories of the the origin
of life.
   ``The issue is, will evolution be taught as fact, or as theory,''
Sheldon said, adding that there ``is some positive material in the
statement. We just want to carry it further.''
   Neither side testified directly before the full board, which
adopted the policy statement after a brief description and no
debate. But nearly half of the board's members had participated in
part or all of two lengthy hearings drafting the statement earlier
this month.
   The debate over the policy statement focused almost exclusively
on evolution, but that word didn't even appear in the first two
drafts of the document, and was added in the final draft adopted by
the board only as an example of scientific theories in a footnote.
   However, Alexander said she was sure that to textbook publishers
and local teachers, ``it's very, very clear'' that the statement
sets policy for teaching evolution.

   Associate Attorney General Francis A. Keating
II disclosed Friday he will not be reappointed to his position at
the Justice Department in the Bush administration.
   Keating, the department's No. 3 official, said he was informed
Thursday of the decision that he would not be offered his current
job after George Bush is inaugurated president next Friday.
   The word from Attorney General Dick Thornburgh came the same day
that Bush announced appointment of William Bennett as drug czar _ a
job Keating had also been considered for by transition officials.
   Thornburgh ``has a right to his own team. I would do the same if
I were him,'' said Keating, who became associate attorney general
last spring after directing the law enforcement agencies of the
Treasury Department.
   Keating's departure from Justice was not unexpected.
   Department sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said most
presidential appointees below the rank of attorney general in the
Justice Department are expected to be replaced in the Bush
administration.
   No decision on Keating's replacement has been made, said the
sources.

<TEXT>
   Airport authorities said former Ugandan
dictator Idi Amin left Dakar on Friday apparently bound for
Kinshasa, the Zairean capital, from which he was just deported.
   The authorities said on condition of anonymity that Amin flew out
on the same Falcon 50 plane that brought him to the Senegalese
capital on Thursday. It belongs to the Zairean state mining company
Gecamines.
   Amin, accompanied by one of his sons, was detained in Kinshasa on
Jan. 3 as he tried to enter Zaire on a false passport, one of a
batch reported stolen.
   Zairean officials said they established that Amin intended to
return to Uganda through Zaire. The two countries share a common
border.
   Officials in Kinshasa made it clear Amin's presence was unwelcome
and an embarrassment. They assured neighboring countries of
continuing cooperation and good will.
   Calling himself ``Dada'' (Big Daddy), the 300-pound Amin seized
power in a 1971 coup and ruled until 1979, drawing world accusations
of human rights atrocities and corruption. Uganda's president now is
Yoweri Museveni.
   Amin was supposed to take a flight from Dakar to Saudi Arabia,
where he has been living in exile for years, but the plane left for
Jidda, the Saudi capital, without him, the authorities said.
   They said the pilot would not accept him as a passenger because
he did not have a Saudi visa. They said when the Falcon 50 left they
presumed it was returning to Kinshasa.
   Elaborate security precautions at the airport prevented reporters
from talking to Amin.
   Saudi diplomats said authorities in Jidda were not pleased at the
manner he left the country and are not happy about accepting him
back.

<TEXT>
   Alongside the icy runway at Kabul's
airport, about 500 Soviet soldiers laden with equipment lined up
Friday in front of giant transport planes waiting to take them back
to the Soviet Union.
   Downtown, Afghans huddled in blankets against the biting cold,
forming long lines for bread or gasoline. Bread, the staple diet of
the poor, has become a precious and increasingly expensive commodity.
   Afghan guerrillas, assisted by a bitter winter, appear to be
making an increasingly effective attempt to blockade the city of 3
million, and some diplomats say the Soviet strategy is to get out as
quickly as possible, with as little publicity as possible.
   Indeed, Friday's troop departure was the latest in what Western
diplomats say is a rapidly accelerating pullout that belies hints
from Moscow it may not meet next month's withdrawal deadline.
   ``They (the Soviet troops) are leaving and they want to cover up
the Kabul end of it,'' said one Western diplomat. ``It could be that
with the acute shortages, they don't want to show the unpleasant
reality of Kabul.''
   But the Soviet news agency Tass said Friday: ``An extremely
difficult situation developed in Kabul in providing the population
with foodstuffs. Long breadlines appeared in the city.''
   It reported that the government imposed an anti-hoarding decree
under which ``people who deliberately hide surplus foodstuffs and do
not hand them over in time, are brought to court.''
   Tass said convoys of food, fuel and other necessities were being
rushed into Kabul, but ``groups of extremists attack convoys
virtually every day and are a constant threat to Kabul's supplies.''
   Afghan government forces killed or wounded 100 insurgents in
battles in Nangarhar and Kandahar provinces, and near Kabul seized
54 missiles intended for use against the capital city, the news
agency said. Another 170 resistance fighters were killed or wounded
in fighting among rival factions, Tass said.
   Under a U.N.-mandated agreement, the Red Army, which entered
Afghanistan in December 1979, is to be out of the country by Feb.
15. Soldiers began leaving May 15, and about half the estimated
100,000 were gone by Aug. 15.
   But the Moslem guerrillas fighting the Soviet and Afghan troops
this week broke off negotiations with Yuli Vorontsov, the Soviet
deputy foreign minister and the ambassador to Kabul. Vorontsov
hinted that if the insurgency continued, the Soviet troops might
delay their departure.
   Western diplomats say the current rate of withdrawal indicates
the bulk of the Soviet troops are likely to be gone ahead of
schedule.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze traveled to Kabul
on Friday. The nature of his visit was not disclosed by Tass.
   Friday's group of troops was lined up beside two blue and white
Ilyushin-76 transport planes. More than a dozen smaller Antonov
aircraft were nearby. Diplomats estimate that seven to eight Il-76
aircraft arrive and leave daily.
   This week, the Soviets shut down their 700-bed military hospital
in Kabul, pulled out all the medical staff and handed the facility
over to the Afghan administration. Soviet civilian advisers as well
as government ministers are also going. There are no firm numbers on
how many of the estimated 2,500 advisers remain.
   Diplomats say that in the past week, the number of advisers at
the Ministry of Health has been cut from 16 to two and at the
Afghan-Soviet Transport Company from 20 to five.
   The price of nan, the flat bread that along with sugar and tea is
all most Afghans can reguarly afford, has more than doubled to about
15 Afghanis. At the commonly used black market rate, a U.S. dollar
is worth 200 Afghanis.
   Sugar ran out at most stores about a month ago.
   On Sunday, a regular working day in this Moslem country, the
bread shortage was so acute that 80 percent of bread stores were
closed. Witnesses said a group of Afghan soldiers broke into and
robbed one store that still had supplies.
   Large parts of the city are without power for up to six hours
daily. In what appears to be part of an effort to conserve power,
the university closed in November, a month early, and won't reopen
until March, a month late.
   Thos who can afford it are exacerbating the shortages by stocking
up.
   People join cars at gas stations, filling up two-gallon cans to
lug home.
   One Western diplomat estimated that up to 7,000 of the remaining
50,000 Soviet soldiers may have left since the new year. The U.S.
State Department said Jan. 11 that the Soviet Union had renewed its
withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   Army Gen. Vitaly M. Shabanov, a deputy Soviet defense minister,
told a Moscow news conference Friday: ``It is our intention to abide
by the Geneva agreements. This is our duty and indeed this is the
firm opinion and strong intention of our leaders. So there can be no
doubts in this regard.''

<HEAD>Treasury Considering Merger of Bank and S&amp;L Agencies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department is working on a savings
and loan reform plan that would transfer control of the insurance
fund for S&amp;L deposits from its current regulatory parent to the
agency that insures commercial banks, a government official said
Friday.
   However, the department hasn't decided for certain on the
recommendation to President-elect Bush, which would give the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. jurisdiction over the Federal Savings and
Loan Insurance Corp., said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   It would be an administrative merger, not a merger of the money
in the funds, which are each separately financed through premiums
paid by the industry they insure, the official said.
   Commercial bankers are lobbying hard to make sure money from
their fund doesn't go to solve a competing industry's problems. The
FDIC is solvent, with more than $15 billion in reserves. The FSLIC,
although it still has several billion dollars in cash to work with,
has been technically insolvent since 1986.
   An administrative merger of the funds would promote similar
regulatory standards for both banks and S&amp;Ls. Bankers believe that
regulation of S&amp;Ls is now more lax.
   The FDIC already regulates institutions, called savings banks,
which are similar to savings and loan associations. Even so, many in
the S&amp;L industry believe merging the funds would eventually mean the
end of a separate system of providing home mortgage loans.
   Currently, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board runs the FSLIC, which
as the deposit insuror has prime responsibility for making sure S&amp;Ls
engage in safe lending practices. However, the bank board is also
charged with promoting home ownership by establishing S&amp;Ls, a role
critics say can inherently conflict with the FSLICs.
   The Wall Street Journal, in Friday's editions, cited sources who
said the department is close to deciding in favor of the FSLIC-FDIC
merger, but is still considering whether to recommend abolishing the
bank board altogether.
   S&amp;L regulators reacted strongly against both proposals, which
could be forwarded to President-elect Bush as soon as he takes
office on Jan. 20.
   ``I think it's a crummy idea,'' said bank board member Lawrence
White. ``It does not get us any kind of pot of gold that's going to
solve the problem. I don't think you get any better regulation. ....
What it does do is create administrative disruption and disarray at
exactly the wrong time.''
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the FDIC, has in several speeches
expressed his agency's preference ``for going it alone,'' however,
he has said he would, if asked, tackle the job of regulating S&amp;Ls in
addition to banks.
   In a study released earlier this month, the FDIC recommended that
FSLIC be made independent of the bank board, but remain separate
from the FSLIC.
   Treasury is also examining ways to find a source of money to
devote to faster rescues and closings of insolvent S&amp;Ls. Proposals
range from a mechanism to borrow the money ``off-budget'' so that it
does not inflate the budget deficit to spending the money outright,
but declaring it exempt from Gramm-Rudman deficit limits.
   A senior member of both the House Budget Committee and the
tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Bill Gradison,
R-Ohio, suggested Friday a rationale for exempting S&amp;L rescue
spending from Gramm-Rudman.
   Gradison released a Congressional Research Service report that
argued that the economic impact of S&amp;L failures has already been
felt because the losses already exist as a liability of the
government, regardless of when the payoff actually occurs.
   ``The bailout should be reflected in the budget, but because the
economic impact has already been absorbed, the resulting outlays
should be exempt from the Gramm-Rudman targets,'' he said.
   Reagan's outgoing budget director, Joseph R. Wright Jr., told
reporters Friday he favored putting the S&amp;L rescue ``on-budget,''
rather than hiding the spending through some budgetary device.
   Bush, meanwhile, moved this week to establish an independent
source of expertise on S&amp;Ls in the White House by naming Roger B.
Porter, a Harvard University business professor, as chief domestic
policy adviser, and Richard Breeden, a Washington attorney, as an
assistant for issues analysis.

   An academy-award winning documentary about the
romance of an elderly Michigan couple will be broadcast by Soviet
television in late January or early February, a cable television
said Friday.
   The documentary, ``Young at Heart,' tells of the romance and
marriage of artists Louis Gothelf and Reva Shwayder of Franklin,
Mich.
   Gothelf emigrated from Russia to the United States at the age of
13. The pair are each in their 80s.
   Detroit producer Sue Marx, Gothelf's daughter, made the
documentary, which was first aired on The Learning Channel in 1987
and won an Academy Award for the best short documentary in 1988.
   The chairman of The Learning Channel, Harold Morse, said he
believes the Soviet decision to show the documentary ``will mark the
beginning of an ongoing program exchange between The Learning
Channel and the Soviet Union.''
   Marx's camera follows Gothelf and Shwayder, both coping with the
loneliness that followed the death of their spouses, as their common
interest in art blossoms into a love affair.
   The couple move in together, prompting Gothelf's granddaughter to
ask, ``Why can you live with someone and I can't?''
   In the end, Gothelf and Shwayder decide to marry, and the
documentary concludes with an exchange of vows in a garden ceremony.

<TEXT>
   Bernhard Goetz, who shot four young black men on
the subway and was convicted only of illegal gun possession, was
sentenced Friday to one year in jail and fined $5,000 after a judge
noted he had shown no remorse.
   ``I do feel this case is really more about the deterioration of
society than it is about me,'' Goetz told the court before the
sentence was pronounced. ``Society needs to be protected from
criminals.''
   Goetz's lack of remorse ``gave me concern he might recidivate in
possessing a firearm,'' said state Supreme Court Justice Stephen
Crane in Manhattan. Supreme Court is New York state's trial-level
court.
   The now-famous defendant, who faced one to seven years, decided
to go ahead with his sentencing even though he has asked the U.S.
Supreme Court to review his case because he wants to get the jail
time over with, said his attorney, Mark Baker.
   ``He's resigned to the fact that he's going to jail,'' Baker
said. ``He's paid his bills for the next few months and gotten his
affairs in order. He's tense and apprehensive.''
   Under a one-year prison sentence, Goetz gets credit for nine days
he already served immediately after his arrest, and becomes eligible
for parole in 51 days.
   Goetz left immediately for Rikers Island city jail, smiling
meekly at court officers as he was led away. The Correction
Department agreed to a defense request that Goetz be kept in
protective custody there, Baker said.
   ``There is no rhyme, reason or reality to Bernhard Goetz going to
jail,'' Goetz's other attorney, Barry Slotnick, said after the
sentencing. He had urged that his client's sentence be limited to
the nine days he had already served.
   ``He has lived in a fishbowl (due to publicity) and he should not
go to jail,'' Slotnick told the judge.
   Assistant District Attorney Gregory Waples, calling Goetz ``a
potential danger to himself and New York society,'' sought a
one-year sentence with supervised parole so that Goetz would be
forced to undergo psychiatric treatment.
   Goetz shot the teen-agers in December 1984. He fled to New
Hampshire, then surrendered, saying he had shot the men because he
felt he was about to be robbed. The case became a sensation of the
talk-show airwaves and editorial pages, prompting debates on racism,
self-defense and vigilantism.
   To many blacks in particular, Goetz was a cold-hearted criminal,
a symbol of racially-motivated violence; to many whites,
particularly gun owners, he was the ``subway vigilante,'' an
ordinary citizen protecting his rights.
   Goetz was acquitted in June 1987 of attempted murder, assault and
other charges and convicted only of possessing the gun used at the
time.
   On Oct. 19, 1987, Crane sentenced Goetz to six months in jail, a
$5,000 fine, 200 hours community service, five years' probation and
psychiatric counseling.
   But last year, a mid-level appeals court overturned the sentence,
saying the judge should have followed the state gun control law,
which mandated a one-year sentence. The case was returned to Crane
for resentencing.
   Baker said he and Slotnick asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 6
to review the case because they are challenging the conviction
itself.
   But because Goetz wants to get the jail time over with, the
attorneys did not request that the sentencing be held off until the
Supreme Court rules within six to eight weeks, Baker said.
   ``We all decided to proceed and not delay it any further,'' Baker
said. ``If he gets the straight time (of a year in jail), we won't
appeal that'' either.
   If the high court decides to review the case, however, the
attorneys would ask that Goetz's sentence be interrupted, Baker said.
   Three of the four teen-agers Goetz shot recovered. The fourth was
brain-damaged and partially paralyzed. Goetz claimed he shot them in
self-defense because he was about to be robbed; the youths claimed
they were panhandling.
   Goetz's sentence is ``an outrage and gives license to bigots and
lunatics all over the city of New York to go out and blast people
who they hate and fear,'' said Ron Kuby, a lawyer representing one
of the teen-agers, Darrell Cabey, in a multimillion-dollar suit
against Goetz.
   He said he had spoken with Cabey's mother, who expressed
disappointment with the verdict. ``She was hoping a stiff sentence
would prevent other people from going out and doing to black youth
what Bernhard Goetz did to Darrell Cabey. Unfortunately, that's not
going to happen.''
   Mayor Edward I. Koch said he thought the sentence was
appropriate, saying of those who carry illegal handguns, ``Every one
of them should serve a year in jail. No exceptions.''
   Despite all the headlines and public debate that the Goetz case
spawned, it is difficult to say if the case changed the lives of
anyone not directly involved in the shooting or its prosecution.
   In the place it logically would have had the greatest impact _
the subways _ police say they can see little effect.
   ``I don't really see any pattern at all that exists based on that
particular case,'' said Sgt. Bob Valentino, a spokesman for the
transit police.
   Subway crime figures have bounced up and down in the years since
the shooting, while subway ridership has been up. An estimated 3{
million people use the subway every weekday.
   ``The perception of subway crime, of being frightened, is more
than the reality,'' said Valentino. ``We're trying to address that
and inform the public.''

<HEAD>Shevardnadze Arrives In Afghanistan</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Afghanistan, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze arrived in the capital on Friday, the Afghan news
agency said, and more fighting was reported between government and
rebel forces.
   Tass,the Soviet news agency, also said the government has
reopened a main supply line to Kabul that had been cut by heavy snow
and resistance attacks. The break in the supply line had created
long bread lines.
   Shevardnadze's trip, reported in a one-sentence statement by
Tass, had not been announced previously. Tass gave no indication of
his itinerary.
   ``Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze left Moscow for
Kabul on a working visit today,'' the Tass dispatch said. Radio
Kabul reported his arrival.
   The trip came after the U.S. State Department said Jan. 11 that
the Soviet Union had renewed its withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   Under agreements signed in Geneva, the Soviet Union withdrew half
of its 100,000 soldiers between May 15 and Aug. 15 and the remainder
are to leave by Feb. 15.
   But Soviet officials have accused Pakistan and the United States
of violating those agreements by continuing to provide military aid
to the Afghan resistance, and have raised the possibility that the
withdrawal will not be completed on time.
   Army Gen. Vitaly M. Shabanov, a deputy Soviet defense minister,
told a Moscow news conference on Friday: ``It is our intention to
abide by the Geneva agreements. This is our duty and indeed this is
the firm opinion and strong intention of our leaders. So there can
be no doubts in this regard.''
   Asked to comment on the State Department report that the second
stage of the withdrawal had begun, he said, ``The first stage of the
withdrawal is over and I am sure the second stage will begin soon.''
   Yuli Vorontsov, first deputy foreign minister and the Soviet
ambassador to Afghanistan, has urged the formation of a broad-based
government including representatives of the ruling pro-Soviet
People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
   But the resistance refused to continue talks with the Soviets,
saying Vorontsov was trying to secure a place for its ally in any
post-war government.
   Tass reported Friday that a car bomb exploded in the Afghan city
of Herat, killing or wounding 20 people. In another report, Tass
said a main supply route to Kabul from the northern village of
Hayraton, closed by heavy snow and rebel attacks, had been reopened.
   ``An extremely difficult situation developed in Kabul in
providing the population with foodstuffs. Long breadlines appeared
in the city,'' Tass said. It reported that the government imposed an
anti-hoarding decree under which ``people who deliberately hide
surplus foodstuffs and do not hand them over in time, are brought to
court.''
   Tass said convoys of food, fuel and other necessities were being
rushed into Kabul, but ``groups of extremists attack convoys
virtually every day and are a constant threat to Kabul's supplies.''
   Afghan government forces killed or wounded 100 insurgents in
battles in Nangarhar and Kandahar provinces, and near Kabul seized
54 missiles intended for use against the capital city, it said.
Another 170 resistance fighters were killed or wounded in fighting
among rival factions, Tass said.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in 1979 to replace a faltering
Marxist regime with a new government and stayed behind to fight an
anti-communist insurgency. They agreed to withdraw under a
U.N.-brokered accord reached last year.

<HEAD>Official Uses Private Firm for News Release</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A departing Justice Department official used a
private public relations firm Friday to announce a press conference
that was not officially cleared with the attorney general.
   The public relations company that issued the release for
Assistant Attorney General Roger J. Marzulla had recently prepared
an announcement that the outgoing head of the land and natural
resources division was joining a local law firm to start an
environmental-law practice.
   Without telling the Justice Department's public affairs staff,
Hartz@Meek International Inc., told news organizations the land
division planned to file a court action against the District of
Columbia's sewage treatment plant.
   Department spokesman Loye Miller said use of a private public
relations firm to announce an official Justice Department action was
unprecedented and ran counter to established procedures.
   The firm got involved in official Justice Department business
just four days after the agency announced deep cuts in its public
affairs staff that would take effect in 30 days.
   Later Friday, Marzulla appeared before television cameras in his
office to discuss the court action even though department officials
said he had not received clearance to hold a press conference.
   At the outset, Marzulla said he was conducting a briefing, not a
press conference. But he read a prepared statement and took
questions during a session filmed by two local TV camera crews.
   The Hartz@Meek press release was distributed before the Justice
Department issued its formal release announcing the government was
seeking a $3.1 million contempt-of-court judgment against the D.C.
government for failing to upgrade the sewage plant.
   Miller said he was unaware of the private company's news release.
Miller said he had been unable to get clearance from the attorney
general's staff for Marzulla to hold a press conference.
   Miller said Marzulla had sought clearance from Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh's office to hold a press conference. The spokesman
said he was prepared to advise Marzulla not to hold a press
conference when he was told the assistant attorney general had
withdrawn his request for clearance.
   Marzulla said he asked Hartz@Meek to issue the release to give
local news organizations notice that the department's action was
being taken.
   More publicity is needed, Marzulla said because the department's
anti-pollution efforts have been ``eclipsed by the wrong notion that
there has not been enough enforcement.''
   He denied seeking to promote his new career as an environmental
lawyer by using the public relations firm to summon local reporters
to the briefing.
   ``It does not strike me as inappropriate,'' Marzulla said.

   NATO, the Warsaw Pact and 12 other
European nations on Friday informally accepted a landmark human
rights and security accord designed to enhance freedom in the Soviet
bloc and boost East-West contacts.
   But a lingering dispute between Greece and Turkey continued to
block final agreement on a mandate for new East-West arms talks.
   The accord includes provisions that would increase religious
freedom; speed emigration procedures and the issuance of visas for
important family reasons; allow independent monitoring; encourage
tourism; allow freer spread of information; and give all prisoners
humane treatment.
   Another provision would stop the abuse of psychiatry against
political prisoners. Soviet authorities have been accused of using
mental hospitals to punish dissidents.
   Western diplomats hailed the document as a major advance on human
rights, but noted the key test was whether the Soviet bloc would
stick to it.
   The 1975 Helsinki Final Act, signed by the Soviet Union, the
United States, Canada and all European nations bar Albania,
contained commitments to free travel, information and other human
rights that the East bloc often violated.
   The Vienna document ``refined and defined the humanitarian
undertakings in far greater detail than ever possible before,''
noted Canadian Ambassador William Bauer, who played a prominent part
in Western efforts to achieve good human rights agreements.
   Reforms in the Soviet Union played a major role in securing the
agreement, Bauer and other Western diplomats said.
   Diplomats trying to resolve the dispute between Greece and
Turkey, NATO allies, reported no firm progress Friday, and scheduled
their next session of NATO-Warsaw Pact talks for Saturday.
   The U.S. ambassador to the talks, Stephen Ledogar, said Secretary
of State George Shultz will not come to Vienna next week to wind up
the 35-nation Helsinki review conference and formally approve the
final document unless the dispute is solved.
   ``Shultz could decide at any moment that the U.S. could wait no
longer,'' Ledogar told reporters. ``Time is running out.''
   Greece and Turkey are arguing over whether to include a strategic
triangle of Turkish territory close to the Syrian border and the
disputed port of Mersin in new East-West talks on reducing
conventional forces in Europe.
   Ledogar said Greece and Turkey will have to share the bame if
their dispute unravels the arms talks and Helsinki conference
agreements.
   Polish Ambassador Wlodzimierz Konarski, speaking on behalf of the
Warsaw Pact, said late Friday, ``We have done all we can'' to reach
agreement in Vienna.
   ``The problem remaining ... is not East-West,'' he said. ``You
can't blame the East for it.''
   Konarski said the session set for Saturday was ``the final
deadline'' for advising foreign ministers whether or not to come to
Vienna next week.
   The ministers are scheduled to end the meeting in a three-day
session next week. The meeting opened in Vienna in November 1986.
   The mandate for the new arms talks is supposed to be included in
the final document of the conference.
   NATO and the Warsaw Pact gave provisional agreement to the final
document _ minus the mandate for arms talks _ on Friday after the 12
neutral and non-aligned nations at the conference worked late into
the night to resolve outstanding differences.
   Even as the East bloc informally accepted the accords, reports
came from Bulgaria of the arrest of at least seven independent human
rights activists in that nation.
   Communist authorities in Czechoslovakia also have banned a rally
planned Sunday by independent groups in Prague who want to
commemorate a student who burned himself to death in January 1969 to
protest the 1968 Soviet-led invasion.
   If finally approved, the Vienna accord contains provisions to:
   _ Allow religious education, the spread of religious literature
and charity action by churches.
   _ Resolve outstanding emigration applications within six months,
and grant visas for family reunification within one to three months.
   _ Facilitate tourism, allowing Western visitors to stay in East
bloc homes.
   _ Provide much more information needed by Western businessmen
trading in the East.
   _ Allow independent groups to monitor their governments' human
rights behavior, and the state of the environment.
   In addition, the agreement provides for the first time a formal
mechanism allowing any Helsinki signatory to take up human rights
matters with any other signatory.
   Annual conferences on human rights are planned before the next
Helsinki review conference, scheduled in Helsinki in 1992.

<HEAD>Dukakis Begins Aggressive Campaign to Promote $735 Million Tax Package</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A day after announcing a $735 million tax package,
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis launched a campaign Friday to build
political support for the plan, which has drawn little enthusiasm in
the Legislature.
   The governor's first stop on what aides said would be an
aggressive, highly visible statewide lobbying effort was Bunker Hill
Community College, the kind of government investment Dukakis says
his tax plan is designed to protect.
   ``For our children and our grandchildren's sakes _ 180,000 of who
attend our public colleges and universities _ we must go forward,''
Dukakis said, calling education the key to good jobs. ``That's why I
need your support for the revenue package I unveiled last night.''
   His plan, which seeks to raise $131 million in the next six
months and $604 million in the following year, targets drinkers,
smokers, drivers, investors, corporations and utilities.
   The governor said he was committed to building support for new
taxes rather than pare government spending much further.
   Dukakis told the House and Senate Ways and Means committees
Friday that he is withholding $250 million in spending authorized in
the $11.6 billion budget because the state does not have the money
to pay for the spending.
   Dukakis told legislators that his Revenue Advisory Board met
Thursday and made no change in its forecast of state tax
collections. At its last meeting in December, the board trimmed $308
million from its projection for the current fiscal year, which ends
on June 30.
   In addition to meeting with hundreds of students and university
officials at the Bunker Hill campus, the governor also spent much of
the day giving interviews to Massachusetts television stations to
promote the program.
   The biggest element in the package was a proposed doubling in the
personal income tax rate on profits from capital gains on
investments. Dukakis proposed keeping the current exemption for
sales of homes and would exempt profits from new investments in
Massachusetts.
   Dukakis also proposed raising the gasoline tax from 11 cents to
17 cents a gallon; adding 4 cents per pack to the cigarette excise;
a 50 percent increase in the state tax on beer, wine and alcohol;
and applying the sales tax to purchases by utilities and to
interstate telephone calls and data transmissions.
   In addition, Dukakis called for diverting $14 million from the
Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund to a job training program and
changing the schedule of filing corporate estimated taxes to bring
in an extra $46 million this year.
   Dukakis will present the tax proposal in a legislative package to
skeptical legislators next week, just past the mid-point in the
budget year. He said the plan would have to take effect by April 1
to help balance the budget this year.
   In December, Dukakis acknowledged a shortfall of at least $600
million in the current state budget of $11.6 billion.

<HEAD>Navy Withdrawing Another Ship From Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration has decided to
withdraw another warship from the Persian Gulf, citing the
continuing cease-fire between Iran and Iraq.
   The USS Josephus Daniels, a guided missle cruiser, was ordered
out of the Persian Gulf Friday, said Lt. Col. Keith Schneider, a
Pentagon spokesman.
   The spokesman said the move was approved by Defense Secretary
Frank C. Carlucci. He acted after a month's experience with new
convoy monitoring procedures inside the gulf, Schneider said.
   The Daniels' departure leaves 14 American Navy ships still
operating inside the Persian Gulf and another 10 deployed with an
aircraft carrier battle group nearby in the Arabian Sea. The 14
still inside the gulf include six warships, six minesweepers, one
amphibious landing ship and one flag ship.
   The United States has very gradually reduced its naval task force
inside the gulf since Iran and Iraq agreed to a truce last August in
their seven-year war. Last month, with the cease fire still holding,
the Navy ships relaxed their convoy procedures for U.S. flag tankers
to a system of very loose radio and radar monitoring.
   Before the cease fire, the Navy had been accompanying the
merchant ships on each transit of the gulf to provide maximum
protection.

   The Justice Department will try to enter a
civil suit brought against the General Electric Co. over admissions
that it failed to test components in engines sold to the Navy,
officials announced Friday.
   A former plant manager for General Electric, Anthony Divincenzo,
sued GE last September under a law which lets private citizens seek
damages on behalf of the government for alleged fraudulent activity.
   The assistant attorney general for civil proceedings, John R.
Bolton, said in a statement the Justice Department was petitioning
U.S. District Judge Carl Rubin to join the suit, but it was not
known when Rubin would decide the issue.
   FBI and Pentagon investigators have been reviewing GE admissions
that test records may have been falsified at a Seattle factory that
made parts for military and commercial aircraft, according to court
documents and federal officials.
   The investigation centers on a check and drain valve for the
F-404 engine that powers the Navy's F@A-18 fighter, according to
the Justice Department announcement.
   The GE factory in question also makes an engine part used by the
type of Boeing aircraft that crashed Sunday in Britain, killing 44
people.
   However, federal and company officials said the part could not
have caused the Boeing accident. The federal investigation began
last year and has no connection with the accident in England.
   GE spokesman Richard Kennedy said Wednesday the factory made a
timer valve for the CFM56 engine used by the Boeing 737-400 as well
as a check and drain valve for the F404 engine aboard the Navy's
FA-18 fighter.
   Another GE employee, attorney Robert C. Anderson, said in a
letter dated last June 2 that test records may have been falsified
for valves used on the FA-18 in 1984-87.
   According to newly revealed court papers in Cincinnati, the FBI
has become involved in the investigation of the FA-18 engines.
   Navy spokeswoman Lt. Nettie Johnson was unable to say immediately
whether the F@A-18 had experienced problems from faulty
check and drain valves.
   Anderson, the GE attorney, said in his letter to the Pentagon
that: ''In late May 1988, it was discovered that prior to July 1987,
a particular flow leak check, which is required by GEAE (General
Electric Aircraft Engine) specifications, was not performed on the
F-404 check and drain valves.''
   ``It is believed that the test was discontinued sometime in 1983,
possibly as a result of the test fixture becoming broken,'' Anderson
said in the letter.
   ``The test was reinstituted in July 1987 when the problem was
detected by lower level personnel in the plant,'' the letter said.
``During the period involved, it is also believed that operators may
have falsified internal test records which are maintained to reflect
actual test readings.''
   Anderson's letter does not indicate the total number of engines
or their value, but said the deliveries covered the periods of
April-May 1984, April-May 1985, April-May 1986, and April-May 1987.
   Defense Department officials said they had received Anderson's
letter as part of what they called a ''voluntary disclosure
program'' for companies that believe they have not met the terms of
their contracts. The inspector general's office in the Pentagon, in
conjunction with the FBI, is investigating the admissions in the
letter, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   At the request of the Justice Department, all documents in the
Divincenzo suit remained under seal until last Friday, when Judge
Rubin denied a federal motion to allow the Justice Department until
Feb. 1 to decide whether to join the case as a plaintiff.

   Arabs rioted in the West Bank city of Hebron on
Friday after Jewish settlers began an armed patrol, Israel radio and
Arab reports said. Israeli soldiers reportedly killed two
Palestinians and wounded 18 in separate clashes.
   In Jerusalem, assailants believed to be Jewish militants smashed
a monument to fallen Arab soldiers.
   Israeli soldiers killed a 15-year-old Palestinian during a clash
at the Dheishe refugee camp near Bethlehem, doctors said. They said
a bullet hit Nabil Mohammed Abu Laban in the shoulder and then
pierced his heart.
   An Arab reporter said the youth was shot when dozens of Arab
youths hurled stones at troops, who responded with tear gas, rubber
bullets and, finally, live ammunition. He died at a Bethlehem
hospital.
   The army said it was checking the report. Israel radio confirmed
the death and said another youth was wounded in the clash.
   Earlier Friday, a 15-year-old Arab died of wounds sustained in a
clash with Israeli troops a day before, officials at Mukassed
Hospital in east Jerusalem said.
   They said Mohammed Yaqub Shalhoub was shot in the head during a
confrontation in the Nuseirat refugee camp in the occupied Gaza
Strip.
   An army spokesman confirmed the death and said the boy was shot
when troops who pursued stone-throwers found themselves in a
dangerous situation. The spokesman, who cannot be identified under
military rules, did not elaborate.
   The deaths raised to at least 353 the number of Palestinians
killed since the uprising against Israeli rule was launched in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in December 1987. Fifteen Israelis
have been killed.
   Armed Jewish settlers patrolled the streets of Hebron, claiming
they wanted to prevent stone-throwing attacks on their cars, Israel
radio said.
   Arab youths hurled rocks at the patrol, and the settlers opened
fire in the air, the radio and Arab reports said. The action sparked
a riot by Arabs in the city's casbah, a maze of narrow streets
serving as an open-air market, they said.
   An Arab reporter in the city said dozens of youths who left the
main Ibrahim Mosque began throwing stones at soldiers, who opened
fire with live ammunition, wounding a 20-year-old in the stomach and
a 22-year-old in the leg.
   The army spokesman confirmed the injuries but said he was unaware
of the settlers' patrol.
   In east Jerusalem, assailants partially smashed a stone monument
to soldiers of the Arab Legion near the Rockefeller Museum, police
spokesman Alex Lapidot said. He said police had no suspects.
   The Arab Legion was the Jordanian force that tried to prevent the
establishment of Israel in 1948.
   An anonymous caller told Israel Army radio the monument was
damaged by ``lovers of the land of Israel and the Jewish people.''
   He said the attack was to protest the dismantling by troops two
days ago of a monument erected by Jewish settlers in honor of an
Israeli taxi driver slain in the West Bank. Settlers have vowed to
erect additional monuments to Jews killed in the occupied lands in
defiance of an army ban.
   Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek condemned the desecration of the
monument.
   ``Several idiots came from some place in the West Bank to damage
the monument,'' Kollek said. ``This is stupidity and idiocy in
addition to evil.''
   Kollek expressed concern the incident may spark retaliation by
Arab militants and further fuel tensions in the disputed city. He
said the municipality will offer money to Arab authorities for
repairing the monument.
   New confrontations were reported in the Gaza Strip. Hospital
officials said at least seven Palestinian were wounded in clashes at
the Jabalya and Shati refugee camps.
   In the Khan Yunis refugee camp, soldiers shot and wounded three
young Palestinians, officials at Nasser Hospital said. The wounded
included an 11-year-old boy shot in the pelvis and a 12-year-old
wounded in the leg, they said.
   Merchants in Gaza began a commercial strike after pro-PLO leaders
of the uprising called for the move in slogans painted on walls.
   The strike is to protest Israeli raids to collect taxes from
Palestinians. Non-payment of taxes is a major tactic of the uprising.
   In the West Bank, a 17-year-old Palestinian from the village of
Faroun was hit by a plastic bullet in the leg when soldiers opened
fire at masked stone throwers, doctors said. Four others were
wounded at the Askar refugee camp.

   President Reagan told Soviet and American high
school exchange students Friday that as they get to know one
another, they will discover ``that most of the problems in this
world between countries do not exist between people.''
   Turning to the Soviet youngsters, Reagan said, ``What with our
political parties and our open elections, all of the independent
media, free labor unions, private businesses and private
organizations of every type and size, America has more different,
independent participants in our system than we have flavors of ice
cream.''
   ``And believe me we have a lot of flavors of ice cream,'' he
added.
   To the Americans, who will spend time in Soviet homes, Reagan
said, ``I think you will find that as people we share so much _
above all, we share our common humanity and our dreams of peace and
freedom and a decent life for ourselves and our children.''
   Reagan proposed the high school exchange program to Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev when they met in Moscow last year and told the
students he is happy to see it under way before he leaves office.
   Later Friday, Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Soviet
ambassador Yuri Dubinin spoke to a welcoming assembly at a high
school in suburban Bethesda, Md., where 15 Soviet students will be
visiting for the next several weeks.
   ``You're part of something quite significant,'' Shultz said. He
told the Soviet students ``you have a job to do ... to learn as much
as you can'' about the United States.
   Dubinin said ``this exchange is one of the spectacular results''
from the Moscow summit, promoting ``intensified people-to-people
contacts.'' He added that the program was ``in the spirit of new
thinking'' being promoted by Gorbachev.

   Two U.S. helicopters Friday began a long-distance
rescue relay to save 32 people stranded on a stricken Cypriot
freighter in the Atlantic 400 miles off the southwest coast of
England, the coast guard said.
   The 42,000-ton Yarrawonga, bound from Norway to Canada to pick up
a load of iron ore, was caught in gale-force winds and lost 240
square yards of side plating and three hatch covers Friday.
   ``I don't know how long we can stay like this,'' the unidentified
skipper said in a radio message.
   The Defense Ministry said the German and Filipino crew members
were not believed to be in immediate danger.
   But Tony Andrews of the Falmouth coast guard said, ``The skipper
has been reporting more cracks appearing in the hull of his ship.''
   The HH-53C helicopters, chosen for their range and 35-man
capacity, took off from their base at Woodbridge-Bentwaters 72 miles
east of London and flew to Shannon airport in the Irish Republic on
Friday night to refuel and await first light, the coast guard said.
   The aircrafts' 800-mile round trip journey will require in-flight
refueling from tanker support aircraft.
   ``It's a very tricky situation and the rescue should take until
midday Saturday,'' said Andrews. ``The helicopters will try to winch
off the 32 crew, and that will be very tricky, too, but it's
something these helicopter crews train for.''
   The helicopters were expected to fly the rescued crew members to
Shannon. The crippled vessel's skipper reported one woman among the
crew _ the wife of an officer. He said three of the 32 aboard were
German and the rest Filipino.
   Two British Royal Air Force Nimrod reconnaissance planes from St.
Mawgan in Cornwall, southwest England, reached the bulk carrier
before dark on Friday and took pictures showing a gaping hole in its
starboard side and three hatches open. Relays of Nimrods, designed
for long searching at sea, were circling the ship overnight.
   The Yarrawonga reported boiler failure earlier in the day but
managed repairs and was on the move again Friday afternoon, making
about 7 mph toward the west coast of Ireland.
   The ship left port in Norway in December and was bound for the
St. Lawrence seaway in Canada.
   Earlier Friday, a Spanish trawler ran aground in high seas off
the southwest coast of Ireland and three of its crew were lost.
   The Big Cat's skipper, chief engineer and boatswain were presumed
drowned after the vessel hit rocks at Valentia harbor, County Kerry.
   A coastal life-saving team rescued 11 crewmen _ nine Spanish and
two British. Names and nationalities of the dead and missing were
not released.

   A prosecutor on Friday ordered a
criminal inquiry into a West German firm Washington says helped
build a poison gas factory in Libya, compounding the embarrassment
of the Bonn government.
   The inquiry into the export activities of Imhausen-Chemie, a
Black Forest chemical firm, was announced eight days after the
government said the firm appeared to have no link with the suspected
chemical weapons plant.
   Werner Botz, chief prosecutor for the Offenburg region, told The
Associated Press he opened the new investigation after reading an
extensive report on the issue in this week's Stern magazine.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
U.S. government is pleased the West Germans ``took a look'' at the
evidence supplied by U.S. officials and investigated the matter.
   In another embarrassment Friday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
spokesman conceded at a news conference that intelligence sources
told the government in October that West German companies may have
helped build the plant south of Tripoli, the Libyan capital.
   Government spokesman Friedhelm Ost had said earlier that Bonn
knew nothing of alleged West German complicity in the project until
U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz brought it up during Kohl's
visit to Washington in November.
   At the same news conference Friday, Finance Ministry spokesman
Karl-Heinz von den Driesch said investigators had to date found no
evidence against West German firms that would stand up in court.
   After meeting in Washington Friday with Deputy Secretary of State
John C. Whitehead, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said Bonn
had ``some new information'' to link West German firms with building
the Libyan plant.
   He said, however, that criminal prosecution would proceed only if
there was ``complete evidence,'' and pledged that ``whatever it
takes to get information, it will be followed.''
   West German and U.S. experts met for a second day in Washington
to examine U.S. evidence on the plant's purpose and alleged West
German involvement.
   Stern cited what it said were official documents and witnesses in
its article, which accused three firms _ Imhausen-Chemie, the now
defunct I.B.I. Engineering of Frankfurt and Pen Tsao medical supply
of Hamburg _ of being deeply involved in the Libya project.
   U.S. officials contend the plant in Rabta, 60 miles south of
Tripoli, is intended to produce chemical weapons. Libya says it is a
pharmaceutical plant.
   Stern alleged that Imhausen-Chemie provided ``everything that is
needed to build a chemical plant'' to I.B.I., which in turn shipped
the materials to Libya under forged bills of lading.
   The article also mentioned involvement by the Cross Link NV firm
of Antwerp, Belgium. The director of that company, Jozef Gedopt, was
arrested in Brussels Wednesday night and charged with forging
shipping documents on goods delivered to Libya.
   A woman who answered the telephone at Imhausen-Chemie Friday said
the firm would have no comment on the developments. She refused to
give her name or put calls through to the management.
   Libya's U.N. ambassador, Ali Treiki, has said the West Germans
``did help us, not only in this plant, in other plants also.''
   A Finance Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
told the AP the Offenburg prosecutor had informed Bonn of his
decision to reopen the inquiry into into Imhausen-Chemie. But the
official said the decision was not the result of evidence provided
by government-ordered audits.
   ``We have said repeatedly that we have found no grounds for
prosecution,'' the official said. ``The prosecutors in our country
are free to order investigations independent of the government.''
   West German law requires firms exporting hazardous materials,
arms or their components to obtain licenses from the Economics
Ministry. However, officials have said the legalities regarding
transfer of technology or consultation vary from case to case.
   The Bonn daily newspaper Die Welt reported in its Saturday
editions that West German intelligence chief Hans-Georg Wieck told
Kohl's office in late September it had uncovered indications of West
German involvement in the project.
   Die Welt, which gave no source for the report in editions
delivered late Friday, said Imhausen-Chemie's name was not mentioned
to Kohl until Oct. 18.
   ``Were the intelligence warnings ignored?'' Die Welt headlined
its front-page article.

   Two Teamsters union officials were convicted
Friday of federal charges they participated in a $700,000 payroll
padding scheme that involved hiring ``ghost employees'' who were
paid but did little or no work.
   A U.S. District Court jury found Harold Friedman, 66, a Teamsters
international vice president and president of the Ohio Council of
Teamsters, guilty on four counts: labor racketeering, conspiracy to
commit labor racketeering, embezzlement and filing false reports. He
was acquitted of one count of embezzlement and one count of filing
false reports.
   Teamsters Local 507 Recording Secretary Anthony Hughes, 52, was
found guilty of all three charges against him: labor racketeering,
conspiracy to commit labor racketeering and embezzlement, which
could carry penalties of up to 45 years in prison and a fine up of
to $60,000.
   Hughes was accused of being a ``ghost employee,'' an employee
paid for doing no work.
   Friedman faces a maximum sentence of 46 years in prison and fines
up to $70,000 on the convictions. No sentencing date has been set.
   When the verdict was announced, Hughes looked down and shook his
head, but Friedman showed no emotion. A couple of women in a crowd
of supporters cried, and another ran out of the courtroom sobbing.
   Jackie Presser, Teamsters international president until his death
of brain cancer July 9, was indicted with Friedman and Hughes on May
16, 1986, but was never tried. His illness prompted repeated delays
in the trial, which started Oct. 24 and heard from 80 witnesses.
   Court documents have indicated that Presser, also
secretary-treasurer of Local 507, and Hughes were FBI informants.
Presser's former attorney, John R. Climaco, has said Presser's
defense would have been that he was authorized by the FBI to hire
``ghost employees'' to enhance and protect his informant status.
   The prosecution contended that Presser couldn't have been
authorized to hire ``ghost employees'' because they were on the
payroll as early as 1972 and Presser didn't begin informing until
1977. Friedman's attorney said Presser was a government informant in
1963.
   Lawyers for Friedman and Hughes asked U.S. District Judge George
W. White to release documents about Presser's work as an informant,
but the judge declined, preserving the mystery over who Presser
informed on and when.
   When White declined to release the documents, Friedman and Hughes
rested their case without using the defense planned by Presser.
Friedman testified that as far as he knew, the alleged ``ghost
employees'' worked for their pay.
   The jury deliberated Wednesday afternoon and all day Thursday
before returning to court Friday, when they asked White if they
would be permitted to deliberate on Monday, Martin Luther King Jr.
Day. The judge said no.
   Friedman, in addition to being one of 16 Teamsters international
vice presidents, is president of Teamsters Joint Council 41 in
northeast Ohio and president of both Teamsters Local 507 and Bakery
Workers Local 19. The two locals share offices and have a combined
membership of about 12,000.
   A union officer must relinquish his union positions for 13 years
if convicted of certain felonies, including embezzlement, a Labor
Department official said.
   Among the prosecution witnesses were three alleged ``ghost
employees'' who testified that they were paid by the union and did
little or no work.

   Eight technicians trying out an
ultra-modern cable car plunged to their deaths Friday in an accident
near the ski resort town of l'Alpe d'Huez,local officials said.
   The victims, all from the region, were employed by a tourist
association and the Pomagalsky construction company, based in this
mountainous southeastern town.
   The cable car, which could hold 125 people, unhooked from its
overhead line and dropped 660 feet to the bottom of a ravine.
   There was no immediate explanation why the car became unhooked
from the cable, which was intact, the officials said.
   Although it was difficult to reach the spot, rescue workers found
the car quickly, but no one was alive.
   ``As soon as we got down there, we knew we wouldn't find any
survivors,'' said one fireman from the rescue team. ``They were
literally part of the metal and the tubes.''
   Nightfall and the other difficulties hampered the salvage
operation.
   The cable service was to be opened on Jan. 21 and was described
as one of the longest in world at 1.6 miles. It was the pride of the
450 inhabitants of the tiny hamlet of Vaujany, north of l'Alpe
d'Huez.
   It would have been able to bring 2,000 skiers an hour to the
village and link it to ski slopes in the 9,200-foot Petites Rousses
chain and other resorts.

   A man prosecutors call ``the Al Capone of Italy''
claimed Friday at a deportation hearing that he was framed for
crimes in his homeland and faces certain death from mobsters or
corrupt police if he is deported.
   Carmine Esposito, 32, told Immigration Judge Craig Zerbe that the
Nuova Camorra Organizzata, a criminal clan similar to the Mafia that
operates in and around Naples, wanted him to join them but that he
rebuffed their overtures.
   Esposito testified that he once was asked to saw off a shotgun
for a customer of the auto body shop owned by his father in Acerra,
Italy.
   When he refused, the customer _ who allegedly controlled the
local police force _ had him harassed by police and eventually
framed, Esposito said.
   ``That's why I escaped from my country, because this happens
every day,'' said Esposito. If he is forced to return to Italy, he
added, ``they kill me.''
   Italian authorities charge that he ordered or committed 12
killings in his homeland from April 1982 through June 1983. Esposito
has not been convicted of those crimes.
   An attempt to have him extradited last year failed because the
charges on which the extradition warrant was based were dropped.
   Esposito, wearing handcuffs, testified for an hour Friday in a
small federal hearing room guarded by a sentry with a shotgun.
   Zerbe said he would issue a written opinion in the case next week.
   The judge ruled earlier Friday that Esposito cannot be deported
on the basis of weapons convictions in Italy, because the
convictions occurred after he was living in the United States.
   Esposito, who moved here in April 1984, still could be deported
because he entered the country on a fraudulent passport, said Craig
Oswald, a government attorney.
   Italian courts convicted Esposito of associating with criminals
and of forging license plates for cars engaged in criminal activity,
in addition to the weapons violations.
   The murder charges have not gone to trial, and warrants that were
issued for them have expired, though the charges still stand, Oswald
said.
   Esposito was arrested almost two years ago and has been
incarcerated ever since in solitary confinement at the federal
Metropolitan Correctional Center.
   A federal prosecutor at time of the arrest called Esposito the
``Al Capone of Italy.'' Esposito denied the accusation.

   President Reagan said Friday night he hopes the
Supreme Court will overturn the landmark 1973 decision legalizing
abortion so ``the voice of life'' could be heard ``over all the
others.''
   Appearing at the annual dinner of the Knights of Malta, a Roman
Catholic civic organization that helps the poor, Reagan urged church
people to join forces in fighting for the rights of the unborn.
   ``Our critics call themselves pro-choice, but have they ever
stopped to think that the unborn never have a choice?'' he said.
   Referring to the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion,
the president said, ``When Roe versus Wade goes _ as I have faith it
must _ the way of Dred Scott and `separate but equal,' a new debate
will rise in the state houses of our land.''
   ``And the voice that I believe must be heard, and in the end
shall be heard over all the others, is the voice of l ife,'' Reagan
said.
   ``The Knights can be part of that voice,'' he said.
   In an excerpt of an interview that Reagan gave to Cardinal John
O'Connor, for broadcast on O'Connor's Sunday television show here,
Reagan was asked about criticism that he shown little sensitivity to
the care of children after they're born.
   ``Well, some of the people have said that are the same ones who,
for example in the Congress, have supported a bill with regard to
child care, that the goverment would require a grandmother to be
licensed in order to be given the care of her own grandchild,'' he
replied. ``This is just ridiculous.''
   The president replied by repeating his criticism of the proposed
Act for Better Child Care, circulating in Congress.
   Reagan said that the bill would require a grandmother to be
licensed to care for her grand child.
   It was Reagan's last official out-of-town business trip. The
president and his wife, Nancy, will travel to Camp David, Md.,
Saturday, and the pair will remain at the White House next week
until Reagan attends President-elect Bush's inauguration on Friday.
   Reagan said that while he may be leaving office, he ``won't leave
the battle.''
   ``In just seven days, I will lay down the mantle of this great
office the American people have bestowed upon me,'' Reagan said. ``I
won't leave the battle. As long as there is breath in me, I will
fight for the principles in which I believe.''
   ``But if I may, in this moment of leaving office make two special
requests of you. The first is that you prepare now to be part of
that voice of life in the great debate ahead. And the second, that
you help America find a way out of the trap of the welfare state.
Help it find a way to open the doors of hope and love, open them as
no state, any state, ever can, for those in need. Help open the
promises of this land of shining opportunity to all,'' he said.
   Reagan was presented with the organization's highest honor _ the
Grand Cross of Merit Special Class _ ``for his vigorous defense of
the pro-life cause and his strong support of traditional Christian
family values.''.
   The Knights of Malta order is a worldwide philanthropic
organization which seeks to serve ``the least of thy brethren.'' The
organization is comprised of 10,000 members in 40 countries and is
headquartered in Rome.

   John Hull, an American linked to an
illegal arms-supply network aiding the Nicaraguan rebels, was being
held Friday under charges of drug trafficking and violating Costa
Rican national security, his lawyer said.
   Attorney Ciro Casas Zamora said Hull was formally charged in the
4th Federal District Court and was being held in the San Sebastian
Jail, where he will remain until a Monday bail hearing.
   A source in the Office of Judicial Investigations said on
condition of anonymity that Hull was arrested Thursday for
investigation into charges of drug and weapons trafficking and
spying for the U.S.-backed Contras fighting the Nicaraguan
government.
   The Office of Judicial Investigations acted after residents near
his farm on the Nicaraguan border denounced activities by Hull that
were seen as possibly endangering relations between Costa Rica and
Nicaragua's Sandinista government, the source said.
   Hull's lawyer called his client's arrest ``politically
motivated'' and said he plans to appeal.
   ``This is a simple case of political persecution in which the
government of President (Oscar) Arias is trying to defend the
political interests of the Sandinista government and the Costa Rican
Marxists,'' Casas Zamora said.
   A U.S. embassy official said on condition of anonymity that an
American consular official was seeking permission to visit Hull.
   The official dismissed suggestions that the arrest was
politically motivated, contending that the Office of Judicial
Investigations has an honorable reputation.
   All the embassy can do, the official said, is ensure Hull has
access to a lawyer and that he is treated the same as a Costa Rican
citizen.
   Hull, a former Indiana resident who is about 69 years old, has
lived in Costa Rica for 20 years and has said he is a Costa Rican
citizen. He has acknowledged he supported the Contras and has said
that in the past he let them use his property in Los Chiles, 81
miles northwest of San Jose.
   F. Andy Messing, who heads the conservative National Defense
Foundation in Washington, said he and Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif.,
met with Hull during a fact-finding trip to Central America last
month.
   He said Hull assured them he stopped assisting the Contras when
the Iran-Contra case broke. In the case, Reagan administration
officials sent arms to Iran for money to be sent to the Contras.
   Hull said in 1986 interviews that authorities twice raided his
home looking for evidence of rumored gun running and drug smuggling.
The searches turned up nothing, he said.
   Hull's wife, Mariella, of Patoka, Ind., confirmed that her
husband was being held, the Evansville (Ind.) Courier reported
Friday.
   Mrs. Hull would not reveal details about the case, but said she
was informed by telephone that her husband was arrested, the
newspaper said.
   Witnesses testifying before Congress on illegal arms shipments to
the anti-Sandinista rebels have said Hull's ranch was a way station
for gun smugglers and cocaine traffickers.
   Hull was not among 13 men indicted in September in Miami on
charges of running an illegal arms network for the Contras. Reports
said Hull was granted immunity by the special prosecutor in the case.
   ``I would be extremely upset if that were true,'' Jack Blum,
counsel on the case for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said
after the indictments. ``Witnesses say (Hull) was all over the place
in this case.''
   Convicted cocaine pilot Gary Betzner has testified that Hull once
met his plane when it landed on the ranch to exchange Contra arms
for Colombian cocaine.
   Hull has denied any connection to drug trafficking.
   Hull also was among 29 people named in a civil suit filed last
year by two journalists. Tony Avirgan filed the suit with his wife,
Martha Honey, after being wounded in a 1984 bombing blamed on the
defendants.
   A U.S. district judge in Miami ruled in favor of the defendants.
He ruled the plaintiffs failed to prove that a wide-ranging
conspiracy was behind the news conference bombing in Nicaragua that
injured Avirgan. Eight people were killed but the apparent target,
Contra leader Eden Pastora, only was wounded.

   Fireworks packed in luggage that had been stowed in
the hold of a British airliner exploded at Gatwick Airport on
Friday, police said. Three men were arrested.
   The small explosion and fire came as three golf bags were being
unloaded from a Dan-Air Boeing 727 that had arrived from Palma,
Majorca, police said.
   Baggage handlers ran for cover when one golf bag ignited, then
stamped out the fire and found the bag contained dozens of
fireworks, the domestic news agency Press Association reported.
   Security men found more fireworks in the two other bags, the
agency said.
   Police did not identify the three men arrested on suspicion of
carrying explosives aboard an aircraft.

   An explosion injured 23 workers on Friday
at Chuquicamata, the world's largest open pit copper mine in
northern Chile, and badly damaged a furnace considered essential for
production, officials said.
   The state copper corporation, CODELCO, said the explosion at the
mine's flash oven was caused by overheating due to a malfunction in
the energy system.
   The oven, the mine's largest and most modern, was put out of
commission.
   Chuquicamata mine is near Calama, 970 miles north of Santiago.

   Twenty-six teen-agers moved into the
South African consulate Friday for a weekend anti-apartheid protest
to mark the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr.
   The students, none of them black and ranging in age from 13 to
19, occupied a hallway outside the consulate's third-floor office,
singing songs such as ``We Shall Overcome'' and other protest
anthems. The crowd blocked at least one person from entering.
   The group brought sleeping bags, food and satchels of books. They
said they would camp in the hallway until Monday, when fellow
protesters planned a march at the building to commemorate the
birthday of the slain American civil rights leader and to denounce
South Africa's system of racial segregation.
   ``We're doing it for the kids of South Africa, where they can be
detained and tortured even without their parents' knowing it,'' said
Susan Goldberg, 14, a student at 32nd Street School.
   ``We want to disrupt their business because they make money here
and that's more money for the racist South African government,''
said Sonia Slutsky, 16, a junior at Beverly Hills High School.
   More than 20 uniformed police officers stood by, along with
plainclothes officers and fire inspectors, who warned the students
against blocking exits.
   Consular officials were unavailable to both protesters and the
news media, but police Lt. Robert Curtis said officers would remove
the students if South African officials or building managers made a
trespassing complaint.
   One consulate patron, an American citizen from South Africa who
said he was seeking a visa to visit his family, was turned away when
the group refused to move away from the door.
   The students said they took the day off from school with their
parents' permission.
   The group was drawn from 50 area high schools and junior high
schools and trained in civil disobedience by activists at the
University of California, Los Angeles.

   The individual whose remains were turned over
to the United States on Friday by Libya has been identified as the
pilot of an F-111 bomber which took part in the raid over Libya in
1986, Pentagon sources said Friday night.
   The officials, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said
Libya had been wrong in tentatively identifying the remains as those
of Capt. Paul Lorence.
   Rather, the sources continued, the remains have now been
positively identified as those of Maj. Fernando Ribas-Dominicci, of
Utuado, Puerto Rico.
   Ribas-Dominicci, who was 33 at the time of his death, was the
pilot of the lone F-111 bomber that was lost in the bombing raid on
Tripoli. Lorence, 31, of San Francisco was the other U.S. airman in
the only plane lost during the April 15, 1986 raid.
   At the time he disappeared during the raid, Ribas-Dominicci held
the rank of captain. He was posthumously promoted to the rank of
major.
   ``A forensic identification has been performed and reveals that
the remains are those of Ribas-Dominicci _ and not those of Capt.
Lorence,'' said one Pentagon source.
   ``We just got the word that it's not the one they had claimed it
was. We don't know if they also ever found the remains of Capt.
Lorence,'' said the source.
   The official said the Pentagon would not have any other details
Friday night on arrangements for Ribas-Dominicci's funeral.
   The F-111 was one of 18 F-111s that flew from Great Britain to
bomb Libya in retaliation for what President Reagan said was Libya's
involvement in the bombing of a West German disco frequented by
American service personnel.

<HEAD>First Refugee Deported Under Tough New Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 22-year-old Sikh became the first refugee
deported under Canada's tough new immigration policies Friday and
left Canada for India.
   Wearing a beige trenchcoat, Chhinder Pal was escorted to a
boarding gate at a Montreal airport after an appeals court ruled he
could not stay here while his lawyers appeal his deportation order.
   The three-judge panel said Pal did not face ``irreparable
damage'' if returned to his native India.
   Pal said he was a Sikh. Violence arising from a Sikh separatist
movement has left thousands dead in northern India.
   ``We don't know if (Pal) was in trouble with his government for
his political opinions or for activities that by our standards are
illegal or revolutionary activities,'' said Judge Mark MacGuigan.
   Controversial amendments to the Immigration Act were announced
last month by Immigration Minister Barbara McDougall. They are aimed
at stemming the tide of bogus refugees into Canada and clearing up a
backlog of 85,000 refugee claimants over the next two years.
   Pal arrived on Jan. 1, the day the new immigration policies went
into effect. He appeared before an immigration panel on Jan. 6
claiming his life would be in danger if he were sent back to India.
   His lawyer, Melvin Weigel, argued that Pal did not have a lawyer
present when he gave a statement to immigration officials on
arriving in Canada. That statement was later used against Pal at his
hearing.
   Under the new immigration system, two-member federal panels
evaluate a claimant's story and determine whether he faces danger in
the country he has left.
   If both panel members agree a claimant is a bogus refugee, they
can order the person deported within 72 hours.
   In Ottawa, the London-based human rights organization Amnesty
International released a statement saying Pal should have passed the
first refugee test and been allowed to stay in Canada while his
claim was being processed.
   ``(Pal) faces the risk of persecution of the basis of his
political activities if he is deported to India,'' said lawyer
Michael Schelew, head of the refugee committee of Amnesty's
English-Canadian section.

   About 1,000 members of an anti-abortion group
defied a federal judge's order Friday and twice blocked the entrance
to a Planned Parenthood clinic.
   Demonstrators from Operation Rescue gathered at about 7:15 a.m.
in front of Planned Parenthood's Margaret Sanger Center in
Manhattan, snarling morning rush-hour traffic. A few abortion rights
demonstrators also showed up.
   The clinic was not able to open until 10:15 a.m. because the
demonstrators blocked the building's entrance, a Planned Parenthood
spokeswoman said.
   Police moved in to make some arrests and protesters who were not
arrested left the scene en masse. But they returned several hours
later and lay down, blocking the clinic's front door.
   Police moved in again. A total of 176 people were arrested and
charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. They refused
to give their names and were held for arraignment, said Officer
Edward Feeney, a police spokesman.
   Group spokesman Harry Brock said more protests were planned for
Saturday.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Ward on Tuesday issued a permanent
injunction against the Binghamton-based group, forbidding members to
obstruct access to health clinics in the area or harass clients
trying to get inside. The order calls for a fine of $25,000 a day
for violations.
   Ward issued a temporary restraining order against the group in
May and ordered organizers to tell police where they would be
demonstrating so police could place officers at the site. When they
failed to do so, the judge fined the group $50,000 for violating his
order and $19,000 to pay police overtime.
   The group did not inform police of their protest site Friday, so
officers in buses followed demonstrators to their destination.
   The action against the group was brought by the National
Organization for Women and other abortion rights groups.
   The judge ordered that the $50,000 fine be donated to NOW and the
other groups.
   Operation Rescue spokesman Randall Terry said Thursday that the
group was being discriminated against because of politically
unpopular views. It has not paid any fines yet.

   The estimated 10,000 pit bulls in the city could
slowly disapppear if the Board of Health succeeds in requiring the
terriers be registered, photographed and tattooed.
   The proposed Health Code amendment, which could be in effect by
March, would require photographs, identifying tattoos, mandatory
registration and proof that the animal had been spayed or neutered.
   The proposed regulations also call for owners to be at least 18
years old and that they carry $100,000 in liability insurance.
   The rules would eventually ban all pit bulls from the city after
those who are registered die or are moved out.
   ``If a pup was born after the registration period, that pup would
have to be taken out of the city or disposed of,'' said Dr. Stephen
Joseph, the city's health commissioner.
   Pit bulls were cited in 422 bite cases involving humans between
November 1987 and September, said Health Department counsel Irwin
Davison. That's about 14 percent of the 3,057 bite cases reported in
that period, he said.

   A Northwest Airlines jetliner that lost a

Metropolitan Airport, officials said.
   Flight 345 landed without incident at 4:53 p.m. EST and taxied
under its own power to the passenger gate, said Mark Sparks of the

   Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons said the lost wheel was one of
four on the right main landing gear. The landing gear assembly has a
total of 10 wheels, he said, adding that the cause of the mishap had
not been determined.
   The Boeing 757, carrying 143 passengers and six crew members,
departed Washington National Airport at 2:09 p.m. EST when it lost
the wheel, which severely damaged a private plane on the ground at
Washington National Airport, authorities said.
   The aircraft remained at Metropolitan Airport for inspection
Friday night while Flight 345 continued to San Francisco using
another plane, Gibbons said.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas battling the
U.S.-backed government vowed on Friday to increase attacks in this
capital city and advised civilians to stay clear of possible
military targets.
   The rebels, broadcasting on the clandestine Radio Farabundo
Marti, told street vendors and passers-by to avoid the capital's
military bases and the U.S. Embassy. The guerrillas consider
Washington the sponsor of what they call the counterinsurgency
campaign against them.
   A 9-year-old civil war has killed an estimated 65,000 people,
most of them civilians.
   Urban commandos of the Marxist-led Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front increased actions last year, bringing what had been
a primarily rural war to the capital. In November and December, they
attacked three major armed forces installations in San Salvador,
causing about 40 casualties among military personnel.
   Two civilians were killed and about 40 wounded in the attacks,
which employed vehicles equipped with explosive charges.
   The government considers such attacks terrorist acts. But the
rebels say the vehicles serve as ``mobile artillery'' _ launching
platforms for rudimentary mortars. They say the explosion in the car
is a charge that catapults the bomb toward the military target.
   The explosion of the launching charge destroys the vehicle and
creates a shock wave that shatters surrounding windows and in some
cases has killed and wounded passers-by.
   Also Friday, authorities of the National University said they
have received death threats, and blamed a new death squad that
announced its formation last month.
   Bombs exploded Thursday night at the homes of the dean and
assistant dean of the university's humanities college. The bombs
damaged property but caused no injuries.
   University rector Luis Argueta Antillon, in a press conference,
blamed an anti-communist terror group for placing the bombs and the
death threats.
   Rightists consider the university a haven for leftist
revolutionaries.

<TEXT>
   The secretary-general of the opposition
Democratic Nicaraguan Coordinate on Friday denied government charges
that the U.S. Embassy is financing a Sunday protest march.
   Official Sandinista government news media have ``mounted a smear
campaign against the opposition because they lack the ideological
bases to face it,'' Roger Guevara said.
   ``The Sandinistas use these methods to try and cloud their
administrative and political collapse,'' he said.
   The pro-government newspapers El Nuevo Diario and Barricada,
among other Sandinista media, said opposition political leaders
received huge sums of money, including $25,000 from the U.S. Embassy
in Managua, to pay for the Sunday protest.
   The U.S. government in the past has financed opposition groups in
Nicaragua, including the anti-Sandinista guerrillas known as Contras.
   Without specifying amounts, Guevara acknowledged that his group
has received funds from European sources. He did not elaborate.
   The opposition leader said the march will commemorate the 11th
anniversary of the killing of journalist Pedro Joaquin Chamorro
Cardenal, who was assasinated by the administration of former
President Anastasio Somoza. The leftist Sandinista government has
been in power since overthrowing Somoza in 1979.
   ``But at the same time it will be a demonstration in protest of
the misery, the need and the repression'' in Nicaragua, Guevara said.
   Fourteen opposition groups of varying ideologies on the left and
right planned to participate in the march.

<TEXT>
   A man accused of killing his wife and burying
her body under concrete in the newspaper building where they worked
was found guilty of murder Friday.
   Theodore P. Sinks, 40, was convicted after more than eight hours
of jury deliberation. He was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison
and fined him $15,000.
   Sinks was charged with murder in the death of his wife, Judy, 44,
whose body was found in a concrete-encased pit at the Dayton Daily
News, where she was a clerical worker and he was a building
superintendent.
   Her body was unearthed in April by police acting on an anonymous
tip more than five months after Sinks reported her missing.
   The body was found in a seventh-floor utility room, an area that
Sinks supervised, in a small pit used as an overflow reservoir for
the heating and cooling system.
   Prosecutor Herbert Jacobson told the jury that Sinks had an
explosive temper and wanted out of his marriage, so he strangled his
wife, put her body in a 55-gallon drum, took the drum to the utility
room and buried her.
   ``He put her where nobody, nobody would ever know it,'' Jacobson
said.
   Prosecutors also cited the testimony of a jail worker who
testified that Sinks told him last August he had done something ``in
a fit of anger'' that he could not undo and that he had decided to
plead innocent by reason o insanity.
   Defense attorney Thomas Hansen said prosecutors had failed to
prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and attacked the credibility
of an anonymous source who led police to the utility room pit.
   ``They don't know who he is, where he is or what he is,'' Hansen
said. ``There's a Mr. X out there someplace that knows a lot about
this.'' Hansen said Sinks could have fled if he had been guilty, but
did not do so.

   Royal B. Little, who founded Textron Inc.
and became the father of the modern conglomerate, has died at age 92.
   Little died Thursday after a brief illness at his winter home in
the Bahamas. He spent summers in Narragansett, R.I.
   His son, Arthur, who was with Little when he died, said his
father requested that no funeral service be held. ``He said he'd
like people to think he'd gone on a long trip,'' Arthur Little said.
   Royal Little built Providence, R.I.-based Textron from Special
Yarns Corp., which he founded in 1923. He retired as Textron board
chairman in 1961.
   Little overcame a lack of financing by using charitable trusts to
finance some of Textron's early acquisitions.
   In the 1960s, Little's personal fortune was estimated at $20
million, but he was known to borrow money for his train fare to
Providence from a friend waiting with him at the Kingston, R.I.,
station.
   After retiring from Textron, Little built Narragansett Capital
Corp. as the nation's largest publicly-held investment company
specializing in small businesses. He also was board chairman of
Amtel Inc., Bevis Industries and American Television and
Communications Corp.

<HEAD>Fortuneteller, Companion Convicted After Promises To Raise Souls</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A vanished fortuneteller and her companion
were convicted of duping an elderly woman out of $150,000 after
telling her that the souls of her two dead husbands could be raised
from hell to heaven.
   Lena ``Marie'' Wilson, 53, and Joe Marks, 38, were not around
Thursday night to hear the verdicts. They disappeared last April and
the trial was held without them.
   ``Lena Wilson and Joe Marks perpetrated a scam on Jeane Dunton
the likes of which Peoria County has never seen,'' said Assistant
State's Attorney Angela Madison.
   Ms. Wilson, who operated a fortunetelling business in Peoria and
Galesburg since 1983, told Mrs. Dunton that she had the power to
raise the souls of her two dead husbands from hell to heaven,
multiply the widow's money and keep her, her two daughters and her
grandson from going blind.
   Mrs. Dunton, 69, said she believed Ms. Wilson's lies. The jury
determined Marks, Ms. Wilson's live-in companion, also helped
conceal the scam. Mrs. Dunton said during 20 months, she gave up
$150,000 in cash and property.
   Ms. Wilson was convicted of theft and conspiracy and Marks was
convicted of conspiracy. Judge James Bumgarner will sentence them
Feb. 24.
   Ms. Wilson claimed she had the power to remove a curse placed on
Mrs. Dunton and her family 44 years earlier by her first husband's
former girlfriend, Mrs. Dunton testified during the bizarre,
three-day trial.
   Mrs. Dunton said she turned over thousands of dollars in cash at
a time, supplied Ms. Wilson with new clothes and gave her a crystal
chandelier, according to testimony.
   Mrs. Dunton also bought a new Cadillac, which Ms. Wilson said she
needed to store the evil that she had exorcised from Mrs. Dunton,
according to testimony.
   The car eventually was transferred to Marks, Mrs. Dunton said.
   Not until last January, after a three-month investigation by
Illinois police, did Mrs. Dunton realize she was duped, she said.
   Last Feb. 8, police arrested Marks at the couple's Galesburg
home. Ms. Wilson was stopped in western Missouri several days later
with a bag filled with about $150,000 in jewelry.
   Ms. Wilson and Marks each posted bonds of up to $60,000 to remain
free pending trial in Mrs. Dunton's case.
   After a pre-trial hearing in April, Ms. Wilson fled the
courthouse moments before police were to arrest her on charges that
she stole from three other women. Marks also fled the area at the
same time, police said.
   Police said authorities across the United States and Canada have
been alerted to search for Ms. Wilson, her daughter, Ann Corricelli,
25, and Marks.
   Ms. Corricelli also faces a theft charge in the Dunton case and
several more in unrelated cases, but she not been arrested.

<TEXT>
   Former Washington Redskin player Alvin Garrett,
who says he hasn't had a job in at least a month, has taken out a
classified newspaper ad to sell the ring earned from the 1983 Super
Bowl.
   Garrett, a wide receiver who caught a touchdown pass in the
Redskins' 27-17 victory over the Miami Dolphins in January 1983, put
an ad in the Washington Post earlier this week under ``Antiques and
Collectibles.''
   He said he's been offered $20,000, but wants more. ``It'll
climb,'' he said, adding that he is seeking $50,000.
   Garrett said he has only worn the diamond-and-ruby ring three or
four times and only displays it upon request. He claimed he's kept
in a safe for the past few years.
   ``It's just a ring,'' he said. ``When I got it, it was good to
have, but there's more to life than a gold band and a diamond...You
need to have enough money to have shelter, a car to drive, food to
eat.''
   Garrett, who now spends much of his time at two local places of
worship, said the sale would also help him spread his ``ministry.''
   ``To me, (the ring) is an earthly crown; I'm shooting for the
heavenly crown,'' he said.
   Garrett said he ran the ad to see what kind of response he would
get, and left open the possibility that he may not sell it.
   ``It's not guaranteed I'll sell the ring,'' he said. ``I might
not and I might. But if I do sell it to someone, I'd sell it to
someone who'll keep it, not bust it up.''

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl has acknowledged
what his government long denied _ West German companies may have
helped build and supply a Libyan plant that U.S. officials believe
is on the verge of full-scale production of poison gas.
   Kohl said in a television appearance late Thursday that
authorities have uncovered new documents implicating West German
companies in deliveries of equipment for the plant in Rabta, about
40 miles outside Tripoli.
   The government's sharp reversal followed the arrest of a Belgian
shipping agent linked to the case and confirmation by Libya's U.N.
ambassador that West German companies assisted in the project.

   A Korean-American businessman arrested in an
alleged conspiracy to purchase nerve-gas bombs had contacts in
Britain, South Korea and possibly Iran, but officials say it's still
unclear who wanted the weapons.
   Juwhan Yun, 48, was arrested Thursday and was being held without
bail at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City
pending a bond hearing Tuesday.
   A federal complaint accused Yun of conspiring to violate the Arms
Export Control Act by seeking to ship bombs containing sarin, a gas
that causes convulsions and death by attacking the central nervous
system.
   Yun negotiated with an undercover U.S. Customs Service agent
posing as an arms dealer to purchase 500 quarter-ton bombs and other
weapons, said Richard Mercier, chief agent at the federal agency's
Newark office.

   An unreleased Department of Energy report
concludes that a linear accelerator could produce one of the key
ingredients in nuclear weapons more cheaply, quickly and safely than
new production reactors could.
   Such an accelerator would produce far less radioactive waste than
a nuclear reactor and ``should be more readily acceptable to the
public,'' according to a draft summary of the report obtained by The
Associated Press on Thursday.
   The U.S. supply of tritium, a radioactive gas used to produce
nuclear warheads, is threatened by the crumbling condition of the
Energy Department's existing weapons plants and reactors.
   The report, prepared by scientists at the Brookhaven and Los
Alamos national laboratories and at Westinghouse-Hanford Co. in
Washington state, concluded that an accelerator could produce enough
tritium to meet all U.S. weapons needs.

   The chairman of the House ethics committee
wants to know why the son of an Illinois congressman was on the
congressional payroll while at the same time running for office in
Chicago.
   Thomas John Savage, son of Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill., was on the
payroll of Del. Walter Fauntroy, the District of Columbia's
non-voting representative to Congress, at the same time he was
running for the Illinois Legislature from Chicago.
   Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., who chairs the House ethics
committee, has written Fauntroy demanding an explanation of the
younger Savage's employment, a congressional source said Thursday.
   A federal investigation into the case began last month after The
Associated Press reported Savage was on Fauntroy's payroll although
he had submitted a sworn affidavit to Illinois elections officials
stating he had met state requirements by living continuously for two
years in the legislative district he sought to represent. That
period covered the time he was on Fauntroy's payroll.

   A substance dentists have long used to strengthen
teeth is a key part of a new treatment that appears to safely curb
spinal osteoporosis, a progressive bone disorder afflicting some 5
million Americans, researchers say.
   University of Texas Southwestern Medical School researchers on
Thursday announced results from a seven-year trial of the new
treatment.
   Doctors say spinal osteoporosis results from a gradual loss of
trabecular bone, found primarily in the spine. It most commonly
affects elderly women and results in shortened stature, curvature of
the back and a protruding abdomen that can cause back pain and
digestive discomfort.
   The treatment employs a slow-release form of sodium fluoride, a
compound used by dentists to strenghthen teeth which _ when given
with calcium citrate _ can reverse the effects of osteoporosis by
adding bone mass, said Dr. Charles Pak, mineral metabolism chief at
Southwestern Medical Center.

   Blacks aren't getting proper medical care because
they lack insurance, have poor health coverage or have been
disappointed by doctors, studies published today indicate.
   The studies also show that blacks are included in fewer tests of
new drugs and, in at least one state, tend to get less aggressive
treatment for heart disease.
   They were published in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association, a theme issue coinciding with the birthday Sunday of
slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
   According to a nationwide survey of 10,130 U.S. residents, one in
11 blacks said they didn't see a doctor for economic reasons in
1986, compared with one in 20 whites.

   A 12-year-old girl who had been sleeping under an
abandoned house was the first to seek shelter at a public school in
a new program that offers homeless students a refuge from the chilly
streets.
   ``Right now she's playing checkers with one of the
administrators,'' said school board President Melody Ellis. ``We
just tried to give her encouragement and let her play.''
   Public school officials opened shelters at two schools Thursday
night to provide needy students with beds, showers and hot meals.
   The 12-year old, who was not identified, was the only one of
eight children who stayed at the shelters on the first night who met
the guidelines for the Schoolhouse Shelters program, officials said.
A mother brought five children to a shelter, and two teen-agers who
sought refuge gave names of schools outside Houston.

   Mexican and U.S. officials are investigating
the origin of a cache of Uzi submachine guns and ammunition
uncovered in the home of an oil union boss charged with the murder
of a federal agent.
   The oil boss, Joaquin Hernandez Galicia, said the former mayor of
Reynosa, across the border from McAllen, Texas, arranged the arms
shipment. The ex-mayor is believed to have fled with his family to
the United States, according to a highly-placed source in the
Attorney General's Office.
   Authorities said 200 submachine guns smuggled in from the United
States were found in the home of Hernandez Galicia when he was
arrested Tuesday after a shootout with police in Ciudad Madero,
about 220 miles northeast of Mexico City.
   Soldiers blew down the door of his home with a bazooka and a
federal agent was shot to death in the ensuing gunbattle.

   A pair of idiosyncratic talents captured the
bulk of Grammy Award nominations, with the feel-good sound of Bobby
McFerrin's ``Don't Worry, Be Happy'' contrasting with the bleak
poetry of Tracy Chapman's ``Fast Car.''
   Miss Chapman's somber, haunting folk songs won her six
nominations Thursday, including best song, record, album and best
new artist.
   McFerrin's ebullient vocals earned five nominations, including
record, album and song.
   The two symbolize the diversity of nominees for National Academy
of Recording Arts and Sciences trophies, and represent a break from
the mainstream. The Grammy nominations _ with an all-time high 76

   Dribble diplomacy is alive and well as the Israelis
topped the Soviet Army team in a basketball contest that had more
significance off court.
   While China had its spell of ping-pong diplomacy in the 1970s
when it decided to warm up to the West, the Jewish state and the
Soviet Union now seem to be improving relations.
   At the army sports complex on Moscow's west side, Maccabi of Tel
Aviv held on to beat the Soviet Army 97-92, to the joyful shouts of
hundreds of Soviet Jews who had the rare opportunity to wave an
Israeli flag and proclaim their ancient heritage.
   In Israel, it was estimated that more than 2 million of the 4.2
million people followed the game in the first live broadcast from
Moscow. Maccabi held a 71-51 lead with 12 minutes to play but the
Soviet team stormed back to within 93-89 on the play of guard
Vladimir Gorin and forward Sergei Tarakanov.

   On a snowy Sunday morning this month, two
youths were buying drugs within a few steps of the Embassy of Spain.
There was nothing furtive about the deal, just money handed over and
two small packets given in return. Anybody driving by could have
seen it.
   Across the street, next to the Polish Embassy, a young woman
signaled a passing car. The car stopped, the woman leaned into the
open window and handed over some money. She withdrew a gloved hand
holding a small package. Anybody could have watched.
   That block, just a mile up 16th Street from the White House, is
one of the estimated 90 open-air drug markets flourishing in the
capital, which last year achieved the distinction of having the
nation's highest murder rate.
   Washington is a city of contrasts, and they never have been more
stark. The news coming out of the capital these days _ of farewells
and the fresh expectations which arise with the inauguration of a
new president _ competes against news of murder, drugs and a mayor
under a cloud.
   Things have gotten bad enough for the other Washington to begin
to poke into the consciousness of official, prosperous, gleaming
Washington.
   Barely a block from the White House, some of the city's homeless
huddle on heating grates. Activist Mitch Snyder estimates there are
15,000 people who live in Washington with no homes other than the
streets, and he says several have frozen to death. The best
publicized case was that of Jesse Carpenter, a World War II veteran
who died of exposure across the street from the White House in
Lafayette Park.
   Across the street from the domed Congress, a beggar jangles coins
in a tin cup and asks passing legislative aides for money.
   ``It's the American dream and the American nightmare all rolled
into one,'' said B.J. Harris, a drug education counselor with the
non-profit Sasha Bruce Youthworks, a youth counseling service named
in honor of the late daughter of a prominent American diplomat.
   Statistics provided by the Census Bureau highlight the disparity.
   The District of Columbia has the nation's second highest per
capita income after the state of Connecticut: $20,303 annually,
which is 32.3 percent higher than the national average.
   The city has the nation's fourth highest per capita education
level, with 28 percent of the population having completed 16 years
or more of schooling.
   Yet, Washington's infant mortality rate is the highest in the
country _ 20.8 per 1,000 births, compared to the national average of
10.6, according to the Children's Defense Fund. The city has the
country's highest tuberculosis case rate, 25.4 per 100,000,
according to the Centers for Disease Control.
   ``This city has monoliths of marble attesting to a great
civilization, and yet some of its neighborhoods are like the
undeveloped Third World,'' Harris said.
   Most of the 27 million tourists who come through Washington every
year never see the seamier sides. In Washington, most neighborhoods
are clearly delineated between the 170,000 white minority and the
458,000 blacks and Hispanics.
   There are many middle-class black neighorhoods, and integrated
neighborhoods, with tidy lawns and substantial houses which could
fit anywhere in America. Some of the predominantly white areas, such
as green and grassy Spring Valley or Cleveland Park, with shaded
streets of elegant Victorian homes, are as comfortable as any in
America.
   One can stroll down Massachusetts Avenue _ past the official
residence of the vice president, past the statute of Winston
Churchill, past the ornate Islamic Center where Moslems gather to
worship, past dozens of elegant embassies _ without a moment's
thought of danger.
   In fact, one can live a lifetime in northwest Washington removed
from the violence and crime that characterize neighborhoods just a
few miles away.
   ``The lines of race and class are very distinct here,'' said
Harris.
   ``The neighborhood we live in is completely white and it's a
world apart from'' the crime-ridden streets in other parts of the
city, said Lauren Silva Pinto, a television producer who lives with
her husband on a shaded block in northwest Washington. ``I feel
extremely safe here, we walk around at night with no problems, have
barbecues, visit neighbors.''
   Washington became a mecca for blacks fleeing the segregationist
South in the first half of this century. Washington was segregated
itself until after World War II, but jobs were available for blacks,
who ultimately became the majority group in the capital.
   Most of the people who work in Washington, whether for the
federal government or other employers, live in suburbs across the
Potomac River in Virginia or across the district line in Maryland.
   Among them are black professionals whose income has risen and who
chose to migrate away from the city's run-down housing and mediocre
schools.
   ``This meant that many of the role models for black youths are no
longer there,'' said Jim Fyfe, chairman of the Department of
Justice, Law and Society at American University.
   The city's youth, who are largely responsible for the sharp
escalation in the crime rate, are victims of alienation and
hopelessness, said Fyfe.
   Those feelings, compounded by a 35 percent unemployment rate
among the city's youth, have resulted in a sharp escalation of drug
consumption and trafficking over the past year. Some of those picked
up in police sweeps are as young as 12.
   ``They see the mansions, the fancy diplomats' cars, and they know
they can never have those things,'' said Greg Anderson, himself a
former addict and pusher who now works as a researcher for an
unusual local television program called ``City Under Siege.''
   The nightly 30-minute program, produced with police help, focuses
on attempts to stem the drug epidemic.
   Drugs are responsible for Washington surpassing Detroit's murder
rate in 1988, with a record 371 homicides _ 49.42 per 100,000
compared with 48 in the former murder capital.
   Police say drug-related murders account for 60 percent of the
killings, compared to 1986 when they accounted for only one-third.
   Police officers say many of the killings are the result of turf
wars for the lucrative crack trade. Prices of crack _ the highly
addictive cocaine-based substance which looks like a rock and is
smoked in a pipe _ are much higher in Washington than elsewhere,
said Lt. Michael Raizilowish. A small bag of crack which goes for
$50 in New York can sell for up to $100 here, he said. Young dealers
can easily make $100 or $200 a day.
   Police are outgunned and outnumbered. A highly touted attack on
drug infested neighborhoods called Operation Clean Sweep led to
46,000 arrests over the past two years but has done little more than
clog the city's overcrowded jails and court systems. The police
chief said it was a failure; it didn't curtail the drug trade for
more than a moment.
   The drug epidemic has undermined the tremendous popularity of
D.C. Mayor Marion Barry, who has been the subject of two
investigations into his social ties with suspected drug dealers.
   City officials say the drug plague can no longer be tolerated.
``We must all make a personal commitment, because we all have a
stake in this war against drugs,'' wrote Assistant Police Chief
Isaac Fulwood in an impassioned Washington Post article.
   And he added: ``What happened to our city last year should make
us all ashamed.''

<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   She won an Academy Award for playing the ruthless
television executive in ``Network,'' and gave unforgettable
performances as Bonnie Parker in ``Bonnie and Clyde'' and Evelyn
Mulwray in ``Chinatown.''
   Faye Dunaway's exhaustive preparation and demand for perfection
have won her admiration but have also caused tension on the set.
Jack Nicholson, her co-star in ``Chinatown,'' nicknamed her ``The
Dreaded Dunaway.''
   But for her latest movie, ``Burning Secret,'' Dunaway drops the
tempo. She plays Sonya Tuchman, the wife of an American diplomat
stationed in Vienna in 1919. The film has a quiet, somber feel and
Dunaway plays her part with the same sense of understatement.
   ``You just have to keep it balanced inside,'' the actress said.
``It's a part of acting. Your business is the inner character and
the rest will take care of itself.
   ``This particular character was gently restrained. She was very
much in the period of 1919, very much as it should be. She wasn't
like Diane in `Network.'''
   ``Burning Secret'' also stars Klaus Maria Brandauer (``Mephisto''
and ``Out of Africa'') as the enigmatic baron who romances Sonya,
and features 12-year-old David Eberts in his film debut as Sonya's
sensitive son.
   ``What Klaus does is what the best actors do,'' Dunaway said.
``He's a link. He always goes against the grain. He's also a very
great gentleman.''
   Dunaway, who has played opposite such seasoned thespians as
Warren Beatty and William Holden, relished the opportunity to work
with an untrained actor such as Eberts.
   ``Children have a wonderful thing _ they don't have to battle
against artifice,'' Dunaway said. ``David is completely genuine,
which is what all of us grownups want to achieve. He wasn't like a
child actor; David didn't have that artifice. He had a wonderful
kind of innocence and reality about him.''
   Acting Dunaway, noted, is really a way of staying childlike. A
chance to remain open and adventurous.
   ``I do know that acting is play. When you actually are doing it,
it's play. Let's do this now and then this. It's all very
spontaneous,'' she said. ``That's very enjoyable because the rest of
life is far more complicated.''
   Dorothy Faye Dunaway was born in 1941 in Bascom, Fla. She
attended Florida State University and the University of Florida
before transferring to Boston University's School of Fine and
Applied Arts.
   In 1962, her senior year at Boston University, Dunaway was chosen
to play a lead role in Arthur Miller's ``The Crucible,'' and was
subsequently recommended for admission to an actor's training
program at the new Lincoln Center Repertory Theater.
   Her time at the Lincoln Center program led to roles on Broadway
in ``A Man for All Seasons'' and ``After the Fall.'' Dunaway's
performance as the unhappy wife in the American Place Theater
production of ``Hogan's Goat'' caught the attention of talent agent
Joyce Selznick and in 1967 led to her film debut in ``The
Happening.''
   Neither that film nor ``Hurry Sundown'' made much of an impact,
but later that year Dunaway earned her first Academy Award
nomination when she starred with Beatty and Gene Hackman in ``Bonnie
and Clyde,'' an enormous critical and commercial success.
   ``I think I've been lucky for many of the roles I've played,''
Dunaway recalled, ``but Bonnie was definitely the biggest break for
me. It was the closest to me. I felt kind of homefree.''
   She went on to earn another Oscar nomination in 1974 for
``Chinatown'' and was named best actress in 1976 for ``Network.''
Still, fame has had its drawbacks as well: she has divorced twice
(from rock star Peter Wolf and photographer Terry O'Neill) and her
overwrought performance as Joan Crawford in the 1981 cult classic,
``Mommie Dearest,'' left moviegoers wondering whether the ``real''
Faye Dunaway came armed with wire hangers.
   ``I think it was a mistake to do,'' she admitted. ``The
intentions are there, we wanted to make the portrait of a tortured
woman. It's an interesting challenge but I don't think it can be
done. People think that you're like that; the persona that's created
by the roles you play are identified with you. You have to be
careful.''
   Dunaway's career made few gains after ``Mommie Dearest'' until
1987, when she won raves as the broken down alcoholic, Wanda, in
``Barfly.''
   ``I was absolutely searching for a part that would make people
forget `Mommie Dearest.' `Barfly' was a gift from Mickie (Rourke,
her co-star), a gift from God. I was deglamorized, demystified.
   ``The vulnerability in `Barfly' is close to me, but not the
drinking.''
   Dunaway's admirers have included Crawford, John Huston, who
played her father in ``Chinatown,'' and Debra Winger, who sighted
her performance in ``Mommie Dearest'' as a major influence on her
own career.
   Dunaway expressed great respect for Patricia Neal but stressed
that her acting style is very much her own.
   ``You can only be yourself, you can't emulate other actresses.''

<TEXT>
   In Israel's longest running play, the rabbi
steals the show.
   Rabbi Benjamin Levene takes on the roles of an ultra-Orthodox Jew
who's never heard of television, a macho bus driver, a Bohemian
painter and a character Israelis think of as a typical American
tourist: he's crazy about Israel but would never want to live here.
   Levene developed the one-man show as part of the educational
program for Gesher, Hebrew for bridge, a movement that is trying to
bring together religious and secular Israelis at a time when
tensions between the two have brought the melting pot society near
the boiling point.
   ``If we don't understand each other, the rest of the world will
just gobble us up,'' Levene recently told 40 secular Tel Aviv high
school students at a seminar on Jewish identity in Jerusalem.
   In recent years, secular Jews, who make up about 70 percent of
Israel's 4.2 million population, have clashed in the streets, courts
and legislature with observant Orthodox Jews over Sabbath
observances and other issues.
   Levene, a modern Orthodox Jew who grew up in Jersey City, N.J.,
and moved to Israel in 1969, tries to ease tensions by making people
laugh at, and appreciate, his parade of stereotypes.
   In the past decade, he has taken the show to schools, collective
farms and army bases, doing as many as four to five shows a week. He
also performs in the United States and soon will take the show to
Los Angeles and Montreal.
   He began a recent performance as an ultra-Orthodox rabbi, dressed
in black and flicking cigarette ashes in his vest pocket when he
thinks no one is looking. In an exaggerated show of modesty he
covers his eyes when he hears women are in the room.
   The 41-year-old Levene takes aim at the holier-than-thou
tendencies of some ultra-Orthodox.
   ``A Jewish state? There's a state with a lot of Jews in it, but
it's not a Jewish state,'' says his character. ``Everyone here acts
just like gentiles.''
   As far as he's concerned, prayer is much more effective than any
army could be in defending the Jewish people, and things would be
better if people rested on the Sabbath as the Bible commands.
   After a short break in his act, Levene returns as Moti, a macho
bus driver who wears his army dog tags outside his shirt, which is
unbuttoned to his waist. Moti answers most questions in the brusque,
clipped style he learned in uniform: ``Affirmative. Ditto.''
   His idea of a religious experience is watching a video of the
film ``Ben-Hur.'' He's served in every Israeli war since 1948, even
if he was just a cook, and he doesn't care what his children do when
they grow up, so long as they don't leave Israel.
   Levene's portrayal attacks Moti's materialism but appreciates his
patriotism.
   While Levene is backstage changing for another character, his
straight man, Shimon Siani, takes over and asks the students for
their impressions. The secular teen-agers, many wearing jeans, punk
haircuts and oversized earrings, have mixed feelings.
   ``I like the fact that his family is so important for him, and
that charity is a way of life, and mutual help,'' Orna Gerzner said
of the ultra-Orthodox character. ``I guess in the secular community
we've lost that a bit.''
   The teen-agers' comments indicate they are much more conservative
than the Levene character Jean-Paul Simone, a Paris-born artist who
lives in Israel with his non-Jewish wife and son, Noel.
   Simone refused to bear arms in the Israeli military. He is a
humanist who believes in justice, world peace and the dignity of man.
   Most of the students pounced one of the teen-agers in the
audience who said he would marry a non-Jew.
   ``Of course,'' the boy added, defensively, ``only if she agreed
to come live here in Israel with me.''
   One of the funniest characters is the cigar-chomping American
Jewish fund-raiser. Everybody knows Harry: He has a sun visor on his
forehead, a camera around his neck and a bag full of cheap
souvenirs, and he's on his 228th visit to Israel.
   ``I know everyone, and everyone knows me,'' he says, adding,
``Israel is real. ... Lets hear it for LA.''
   Harry repeatedly mentions that he gave $4.5 million to Israel
last year.
   Although Harry is far from modest and prefers his comfortable
American lifestyle to Israel's hardships, he is a fervent supporter
of the state and is involved in his hometown Jewish community.
   Several high school students said the show made them rethink some
of their own stereotyping.
   ``I don't believe (in religion) at all, and I generally dislike
the ultra-Orthodox,'' said Rika Sharir. ``But I think this showed me
the more sympathetic side of some religious people.''

<HEAD>Malaria Making Comeback in Venezuela</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANTHONY CAPLAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Malaria, the killer disease once
believed to have been largely eradicated in Latin America, is making
a comeback in Venezuela.
   Experts attribute the resurgence to declining standards of living
due to scarce resources and a booming population.
   They estimate that malaria cases in Venezuela reached some 40,000
in 1988, up from 11,127 in 1984, the last year of accurate records
kept by the World Health Organization for the country.
   Recent Venezuelan press accounts have warned of an imminent
epidemic of malaria sweeping the remote southeast Orinoco River
basin, inhabited mainly by Indians and gold miners. In that area
alone at least 50 people have died of the disease in recent months,
officials say.
   Until 1945, malaria was the leading killer in Venezuela.
   It is transmitted by the bite of a female mosquito of the genus
anopheles, prevalent in tropical regions. The mosquito bites only
between sunset and dawn.
   The disease is caused by parasites injected during the mosquito's
bite. The most serious form of malaria causes fever, chills,
headache and sometimes shock, kidney and liver failure, and coma.
   There is no known vaccine against malaria, although researchers
are still searching for one.
   Francisco Montbrun, Venezuela's health minister, has made several
tours to the malaria-ridden areas and says the nation is facing a
severe crisis.
   He blames the comeback mainly on an influx of gold miners to
areas in southeastern Venezuela that previously were scarcely
inhabited.
   ``Before there was nobody there so we had the disease
controlled,'' he said. ``Now with all the people moving in from who
knows where, they're getting malaria and there are no controls.
   ``The gold miners leave holes in the ground that are breeding
places for the mosquito. They live in shacks without walls. It is
very hard to carry out control programs.''
   Dr. Arnaldo Gabaldon, who is credited with largely eradicating
the disease in Venezuela by 1961, maintained that the resurgence of
the disease resulted because the government halted DDT spraying
programs in malaria-prone areas in the last decade and failed to
train personnel in control programs.
   ``They've gotten lazy. The bureacrats would rather sit in their
air-conditioned offices than go out in the field and see what is
going on under the sun,'' said Gabaldon, who was given the
``Outstanding Alumnus'' award in November by the Johns Hopkins
School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore for his lifetime
fight against malaria.
   The Venezuelan government, strapped for funds due to falling oil
prices and payments of the foreign debt, has cut back on public
services.
   The Health Ministry will run a deficit for 1988 of $55 million,
said Health Minister Montbrun, meaning that money for DDT spraying
and for paying workers in the field has been short.
   Although banned in the United States and other areas of the
world, DDT still is used in tropical regions to fight malaria.
   Doctors in the field also blame declining government services for
the malaria comeback of recent years.
   A World Health Organization report says DDT spraying campaigns
across Latin America have declined drastically, falling from 13.5
million houses sprayed in 1975 to 5.5 million in 1982.
   It blames ``recession, economic policies of contraction, and an
asymmetrical and non-equitative renegotiation of regional debt'' as
causes of a decline in malaria-control programs.
   Other causes listed in the report are ``massive migrations into
the Amazon basin,'' and ``resistance of vectors, (anopheles
mosquitoes) to DDT.''
   Malaria cases in neighboring Brazil have risen from 51,800 in
1970 to 378,257 in 1984, according to the World Health Organization.
   Tourism officials maintain travelers to such popular places as
Venezuela's Angel Falls would not be in danger.
   ``It's not necessary to fear malaria,'' says Jose Haua of Haua
Turismo. ``Perhaps there is a focus in the gold-mining area, but
where we go there is no danger. If you want, we can give you a pill
here in the office before the trip.''
   Doctors say that taking certain quinine-based and other
medications during and after trips to malaria-ridden areas can
lessen the severity of the disease if it is contracted but not
prevent it.
   Other precautionary measures such as the use of repellents and
mosquito-nets at night are usually sufficient, they say.

   During the filming of the classic thriller, ``The
Birds,'' Veronica Cartwright would take Alfred Hitchcock his tea.
   ``Every afternoon at 4:30,'' said the English-born actress, then
a 12-year-old child star. ``He loved the fact that I was from
Bristol, because he used to tell me all the best wine cellars to go
to, like it was really going to help me at 12. I wish I could
remember some of them now.''
   Cartwright got her start in William Wyler's 1962 film ``The
Children's Hour.'' Most recently her roles have included ``The
Witches of Eastwick,'' ``The Right Stuff'' and ``Alien'' and the
critically acclaimed HBO series ``Tanner '88.''
   She can be seen Tuesday night in the CBS movie ``Desperate for
Love,'' playing the mother of a teen-ager who is accused of murder.
   ``That was funny when they sent us the T-shirts,'' she said
during lunch at a midtown Manhattan restaurant. ``It says `Desperate
For Love.' Can you imagine me wearing that down the street here?''
   The movie was shot in Georgia and is based on a real-life case
from Mississippi.
   Cartwright seems surprised when it is suggested that she works a
lot.
   ``I'm glad it seems that way,'' she said. ``Sometimes when I'm
off for a month, I start to panic and go, `Where's my next job?'
Yeah, I've been really lucky, and the parts that I've gotten have
been really different and not really in the same realm which makes
it exciting.''
   Jack Nicholson, who had directed her in ``Goin' South,'' had
suggested her for the role as the small-town prude in ``The Witches
of Eastwick,'' a part that had been written with an older actress in
mind. Her performance was praised, but she said it set her career
back briefly, because casting agents thought she was older than she
is, her late 30s.
   ``I wanted to get out on `Bull Durham.' I was too old. Susan
(Sarandon) gets it, and she's three years older than I am!'' she
said.
   Cartwright's sister, Angela, was a regular on TV in ``Make Room
for Daddy'' and ``Lost in Space.'' Angela lives in Tolucca Lake,
Calif., and devotes her time to running a gift shop and raising two
children, Jessica, 7, and Jesse, 3, Veronica said.
   The doting aunt pulled out pictures of the kids. She said her
sister works on occasion, if it's convenient and doesn't take her
away from her family.
   ``Maybe she got saturated when she was a kid, I don't know,''
Cartwright said. ``She was on series for 12 years. No, I'm the only
nut in the family. I like to subject myself to torture.''
   When she played Ethel Kennedy in ``Robert Kennedy and His
Times,'' a CBS miniseries, she had to quickly enlist her niece,
Rebecca, to play a bit part as one of the Kennedys' children.
   ``They had put in a call to general casting to send down two sets
of twins. They sent an Oriental set and an Hispanic set,'' she
recalled. ``They're going, `No, these are supposed to be Kennedy's
children!'''
   Rebecca, then 3, performed so admirably, director Marvin Chomsky
leaped up and shouted, ``Give her her (Screen Actors Guild) card!
Give her her card!'' she recalled proudly.
   Cartwright pulls out another photograph of ``my bear,'' her
husband, Richard Compton, on the set of a ``Miami Vice'' episode he
was directing. They moved to New York last August after he just up
one day and announced he was sick of the West Coast.
   ``I wasn't going to divorce him just because he wanted to move to
New York,'' she said. The city does seem to have won her over since
they moved here.
   ``I was walking to the post office one day, ... and this guy is
walking by goes, `I love your work! Thank you so much!' and kept on
walking. You go, `Thanks!' I mean, it makes you feel so great! They
know what you've been in. And here, they'll tell you. They don't bug
you about it, they just want you to know that they like it. In L.A.
they don't do that. It's terribly flattering.''

<HEAD>Gallery Showcases Images of Reagan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID S. MARTIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LEWISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ronald Reagan is a mythical centaur. He's
also Rocky, a human television set and a warrior in what is billed
as the first art exhibit to feature a sitting president.
   These images of Reagan by nearly 40 artists, including Andy
Warhol and Red Grooms, appear in an exhibit titled ``Reagan:
American Icon'' at Bucknell University's Center Gallery.
   The show, featuring works done in the past eight years, opened
Jan. 14 and will run through March 23. Reagan will yield the
presidency to George Bush on Jan. 20.
   ``It's unprecedented that a president has had contemporary
artists do this many images of him,'' said Robert P. Metzger, the
gallery's director, who added that the exhibit was the first of its
kind for a president still in office.
   The Reagan interpretations range from flattering to critical, but
Metzger was quick to point out the exhibit was put together based on
the quality of the art, not politics.
   ``You don't go out of your way to offend someone with an art
exhibit, but on the other hand, art is not docile. We do want to
arouse people; we want to make them think,'' he said.
   The show includes:
   _ Two Andy Warhol screenprints of Reagan in Van Heusen shirt
advertisements published during the president's acting days.
   _ A mock wooden toy by Red Grooms showing Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev standing on a missile connected to four
wagon wheels titled ``Nuclear Nuts.''
   _ A heroic depiction of Reagan as a centaur _ half horse, half
man _ by the Moscow-born artists Komar and Melamid.
   _ A ceramic image by Robert Arneson of Reagan as a television
set, the president's smiling face coming out of the screen, a wire
hand as the antenna and a warning on the back: ``Do not expose this
appliance to thought or reason.''
   _ A painting by Israeli-born artist Ori Hofmekler titled ``Ronnie
II'' showing Reagan as the Sylvester Stallone movie character Rocky
Balboa, sporting boxing gloves and shorts and wearing a championship
belt with the presidential seal on it.
   _ A lifelike portrait of Reagan by Leon McFadden, with the
president's face covered by tiny, nearly invisible logos of all of
the Fortune 500 companies.
   The show contains two paintings of Nancy Reagan and one of the
president and first lady together.
   It also has books, articles, posters, photographs, buttons,
T-shirts and postcards about the Reagans culled from Metzger's
personal collection of 50,000 books and 50 filing cabinets filled
with memorabilia about celebrities ranging from Marilyn Monroe to
the artist Jackson Pollock.
   Metzger said he conceived the idea for the show several years ago
but did not think enough work with Reagan as the subject would exist
until at least 1991.
   To find the work, Metzger quizzed museum directors, talked to
artists and went to galleries in New York City.
   ``It was just detective work tracking down the material,'' he
said. ``When I began the search I didn't know there was enough for a
show. I was sort of groping. Who would have guessed?''
   Metzger, who has a doctorate in art history from the University
of California signed by Reagan when he was California's governor,
said the show is historically significant because it is done by
artists while Reagan was still in office.
   ``This will be a show that will be a watershed,'' he said.
``There's probably no other show at any other museum devoted to one
person. There just isn't the material.''
   Even though almost all of the images of Reagan depict him in his
role as president, it was Reagan's former life as an actor which
attracted the artists, Metzger said.
   ``I do think it's this duality of his life. ... It's captured the
imagination of a lot of contemporary artists,'' he said.

<HEAD>Ignore The Urgent ``Free'' Advice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There is an enormous vested interest these days
in offering ordinary Americans financial advice, and it is likely to
burgeon rather than diminish because it is profitable.
   It is made up of diverse practicioners, including bankers,
brokers, financial planners, lending officers, mutual funds sales
people, insurance agents, direct mail sellers, financial
publications and others with something to peddle.
   It is motivated by profit as much as it is by any instinct to
deliver you from your financial bondage, and the message is
invariably the same:
   You must do something immediately about your financial situation.
These are troubled times, and the troubles will be yours if you
don't act now, today.
   Confronted with such a blizzard of advice, some of which you
might have observed is contradictory, what must you do?
   Answer: Nothing. Based on the experience of the past, your
chances in doing nothing rather than something might leave you no
worse off _ and probably much better off _ than if you had acted too
quickly and rashly.
   Some reminders:
   _Attempting to adjust to every short-term financial twist can be
extremely costly. Experience in the stock market shows that in-out
traders do no better, and often far worse, than those who stay put
through good times and bad.
   _There is a huge difference between investing and trading.
Investing is a long-term transaction with a long-term payoff.
Trading is an attempt to make short-term gains. It is the livelihood
of Wall Street. It isn't yours.
   _You are not incompetent. Most Americans are smart enough to make
sound financial decisions, in spite of what sometimes seems a
concerted effort to make them feel inadequate to the task.
   Take it from Peter Lynch, manager of the Magellan Fund, which in
11 years has gained close to 1,900 percent. In a soon-to-be
published book, Lynch comments that the ordinary person can do
better without professional advice.
   ``Investing on your own is going to mean ignoring the hot tips,
the recommendations from brokerage houses and the latest `can't
miss' suggestions from your favorite newsletter in favor of your own
research,'' he says.
   Numerous studies, and the experience of many small investors and
investment clubs, adds documentation to his thesis. So convinced is
he of this point of view that he calls ``professional investing'' an
oxymoron _ contradictory.
   _The latest urgent advisory about what you should do is likely to
be followed within a year by still another that, experience shows,
will send you off in a different direction altogether.
   _There are few real experts who advertise their wares publicly.
Many who claim expertise also claim credentials that fail to
withstand examination. Any adviser can show winners. What about the
losers?
   _There are no ``sure things'' available to the general public.
Neither are there secret tax shelters that haven't been exposed to
the public eye. Certainly, no adviser has one that others don't know
about.
   None of this will ever stop financial advice from pouring forth,
of course, because it is a product that sells well in a free
marketplace. And that means it is yours to ignore as well as buy.

<HEAD>Holiday Boat Disaster Sparks Outcry against Impunity of Rich in Brazil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA GENASCI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sinking New Year's Eve of an
overcrowded tourist boat off Rio de Janeiro has sparked a nationwide
outcry against what many Brazilians feel is the impunity of the rich
and powerful and a general disrespect for law.
   In public demonstrations, Brazilians have made the tragedy, in
which 52 passengers and crew died, a forum to rail against a
widespread sense that in Brazil people in the right places can get
away with lawbreaking _ from running red lights to hiring
professional killers.
   ``Some of the worst vices of the Brazilian soul came to light the
moment the boat sank: facility to bribe, irresponsibility and the
failure to assist fellow citizens in trouble,'' the newspaper Jornal
do Brasil of Rio de Janeiro said in an editorial.
   There has been no accurate count of the number of revelers on the
Bateau Mouche when it capsized and sank on its way to an annual
fireworks display off Copacabana beach. A widely accepted figure is
150.
   The flat-bottomed river boat was built to carry 20 passengers.
Survivors claim it was dangerously overcrowded and listing badly in
rough water and that lifejackets were not readily accessible.
   There are accusations _ as yet unproved _ that Port Authority
guards who inspected the Bateau Mouche just two hours before it went
down were paid off to allow it to venture into the open sea.
   The navy and the police are bickering over which group should
investigate the sinking. There is widespread fear that no one will
be held responsible _ as happened so often before here in Latin
America's largest country, in highway and maritime tragedies, fires
and collapses of buildings and freeways.
   In 1981, for example, two riverboat sinkings in Amazon waters
claimed about 500 lives. Both resulted from overcrowding, yet no one
was ever prosecuted.
   ``The sinking of the Bateau Mouche is a portrait of our
reality,'' political commentator Alexandre Garcia said in a
syndicated newspaper column. ``We were already irresponsible, now we
are becoming inhuman.''
   ``There is a cultural tradition of disregarding security norms,
of negligence,'' said Evaristo de Moraes, a lawyer for the owners of
the Bateau Mouche. ``We need to look at our mentality, which
believes that laws are always flexible.''
   De Moraes added, however, that in the case of the boat disaster,
``I am convinced my clients had no responsibility whatsoever.''
   Indeed, one of the owners of the boat initially told reporters
that ``panic among the passengers'' was the cause of the tragedy.
   Paulo Soares, a son-in-law of the Bateau Mouche's 50-year-old
captain, Camilo da Costa, who drowned, told the AP, ``Camilo didn't
want to go out. He called us to say the boat was overloaded and the
sea was too rough. But he had no choice. He would lose his job if he
didn't sail.''
   Brazilians are proud of what they call ``jeitinho,'' or a
``little way'' of cutting through red tape, avoiding a traffic
ticket or eliminating a problem that has become intertwined with
self-definitions of national character. There is a whole
professional category known as ``despachantes,'' whose job consists
basically of paying off the right people.
   A recent prime-time TV soap opera, ``Vale Tudo (Anything Goes),
drew ratings of 80 percent with its portrayals of greed, conniving,
corruption and deceit among it principal characters.
   But it isn't exclusively a lack of respect for laws that has
generated a sense of impunity in Brazil, said Deputy Justice
Minister Luis Eichenberg.
   ``This also has grown from a tremendous lack of human and
material resources,'' he said. ``We often are physically and
financially unable to enforce the law.''
   Many Brazilians are determined that the Bateau Mouche case not be
forgotten. Theater and movie personalities _ outraged by the
drowning of the well-known actress Yara Amaral _ along with Rio city
councilmen and other well known figures have organized to demand
that police determine responsibility in the sinking.
   Brazilians also have rallied around the shooting death in
December of the internationally known ecologist Francisco Mendes,
who sought to defend the Amazon's ecology and its poor peasants
against the interests of powerful landowners. Many employ private
gunmen to eliminate enemies.
   According to Amnesty International, the London-based human rights
organization, about 1,000 peasants, ecologists and Roman Catholic
priests, who defend landless farmers, have been killed in land
disputes in Brazil since 1980. Only three cases have been
prosecuted, the organization says.

   Profound changes are at work in the American
Midwest, sent reeling this decade with blows to its auto, steel and
farming powerhouses. For autos, the Midwest was the place, Detroit
the hub. Chicago and St. Louis also boasted auto plants. Now,
Japanese automakers are setting up shop in rural, largely white
communities and jobs are becoming increasingly scarce for big-city
blacks. The first story in a four-part AP Extra series, ``The
Changing Heartland,'' examines this trend.

   With a college campus and fertile fields,
this patch of mid-America is a place where students learn and
farmers earn side by side. But corn country has a new face producing
a new crop _ cars.
   Last fall, this tranquil town and its twin city, Bloomington,
joined a growing number of smaller Midwest locales with
Japanese-associated plants that are shaking up the auto industry.
   The increasing Japanese presence in America's midsection _ plants
in Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, Tennessee, one planned for Indiana, and
Chrysler-Mitsubishi here _ is creating work and growth in white
rural areas while jobs and opportunity disappear in heavily minority
big cities.
   ``Certainly, it's a restructuring of the auto industry,'' said
Richard Hill, a Michigan State University urban affairs and
sociology professor. ``The reorganization ... is definitely
detrimental to blacks.''
   The trend has aroused concern in a business that's already lost
thousands of blue-collar jobs, raised questions about potential
bias, and worried blacks, who've long regarded the auto industry as
a steppingstone to a better life.
   ``Auto shops were really the bridge that brought black people
from the lower class to the middle class,'' said Joe Wilson, former
head of a United Auto Workers local at a closed Detroit plant.
``What are you going to do for the people left behind, locked up in
the ghetto who have no place to go and no car to get out to rural
areas?''
   Japanese automakers, who've invested $5 billion in U.S.-based
facilities in the last decade, point to their affirmative action
programs and insist transportation, education and the work ethic _
not race _ determine location. But some academics also claim the
Japanese generally avoid unionized areas and towns with large pools
of U.S. autoworkers, preferring to train novices.
   Whatever the reason, communities such as Bloomington-Normal _
thriving, white-collar towns that are worlds apart from
gasping-for-survival, blue-collar cities like Detroit _ are becoming
motor capitals.
   ``It's just a different culture,'' said Bloomington Mayor Jesse
Smart. ``This whole city is like a big neighborhood. (And) with
modern auto plants being clean, it's not smokestack anymore; it's
compatible with agriculture.''
   In Bloomington-Normal, insurance, farming and academia are big.
Urban blight, crime and unemployment are not.
   Bloomington-Normal, 4 percent minority, had a 4.1 percent
unemployment rate in October. Detroit, 65 percent minority, had a
10.1 percent jobless level.
   Studies have shown black men have been devastated by industrial
decline. In the Detroit area, 52 percent of black men in heavy
manufacturing production lost their jobs from 1979 to 1984,
according to a study by Michigan State's Hill.
   Nationwide, about 27 percent of blacks lost their heavy
manufacturing jobs in the same period, said the study, based on
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reports.
   Future prospects are even bleaker.
   A 1988 study concluded Japanese ``behavior with regard to site
location and hiring practices heightens rather than eases the
dilemma of blacks who are being rapidly displaced from their
traditional American employers.''
   The study, by University of Michigan professors Robert Cole and
Donald Deskins, said although they had no concrete evidence, they
believe ``avoidance of blacks is one factor'' for the Japanese in
determining plant sites.
   ``I think it's a factor,'' Deskins said. ``I can't say this is
their intent.''
   The study found while blacks comprise 11 percent of the civilian
labor force, they represent 17.2 percent of workers at the Big Three
U.S. automakers.
   In contrast, the study said, Mazda Motor Manufacturing (USA)
Corp.'s plant in Flat Rock, Mich., has a potential black labor pool
of 29 percent and Honda of America Manufacturing Inc., in
Marysville, Ohio, has one of 10.5 percent. Company officials say
their black workforce is 15.1 percent and 5.1 percent, respectively.
   Honda spokesman Roger Lambert disagreed with the calculations and
also pointed out the company recruits at black colleges.
   Honda, however, agreed last March to give $6 million to 377
blacks and women after an EEOC investigation concluded they should
have been hired sooner.
   The EEOC claimed Honda employed discriminatory practices with a
30-mile hiring radius that excluded Columbus, Ohio, which has the
area's largest minority population. Honda, which expanded its hiring
area before the settlement, admitted no wrongdoing.
   Many Japanese-associated auto plants are close to universities
and near Interstate 75, dubbed Auto Alley, which stretches south
from Michigan.
   Toyota is in Georgetown, Ky., near the University of Kentucky;
Chrysler-Mitsubishi is in Normal, home of Illinois State University,
while Subaru-Isuzu Automotive Inc. is near Lafayette, Ind., across
the river from Purdue.
   These towns say automakers are attracted to cheaper land, lower
taxes, open space and a well-educated work force.
   Bloomington-Normal, population 87,718, was appealing because of
its good highway and rail systems, incentives, strong work ethic and
schools, said G. Glenn Gardner, former chairman of Diamond-Star
Motors Corp., the firm formed by Chrysler and Mitsubishi.
   ``We needed people with very good communication skills _ verbal,
written and reading,'' he said. ``Some of the major larger cities
have a very difficult time graduating significant numbers of
students.''
   In Tippecanoe County, surrounding Lafayette, one in four people
25 years and older has four years of college, said Mark Davis,
president of Greater Lafayette Progress Inc., a non-profit
development corporation.
   ``What kind of public education system does Detroit have?'' he
asked. ``What kind of technological capability in terms of college
graduates does Detroit have?
   ``There's no God-given right big cities should be viewed as the
automotive centers,'' he said. ``We small towns, technologically
sophisticated centers, think we can compete, too.''

   They do, engaging in fierce bidding wars, offering free land and
water, road and sewer improvements, employee training funds and tax
abatements.
   Chrysler-Mitsubishi received $88.7 million in state incentives
alone, including 630 acres of farm land.
   ``Nobody ever offered us a site in Chicago ... Detroit ... (or)
St. Louis,'' Gardner said.
   Experts also say Japanese automakers prefer areas where unions
aren't strong.
   ``They're afraid wages will be high,'' said Michael Young,
director of the Center for Japanese Legal Studies at Columbia
University. ``They're afraid unions will create demands that will
make the company unproductive.''
   Mazda is atypical _ it is 25 miles from Detroit and, spokesman
Jim Gill said, the only wholly owned subsidiary of a Japanese
automaker with UAW affiliation.
   ``If you're going to locate in Michigan,'' Gill said, ``you best
be prepared to deal with the UAW.''
   Mazda, because of its location, also has many former Big Three
employees _ nearly a fourth of its workers.
   But Vladmir Pucik, international business professor at the
University of Michigan, said the Japanese prefer ``a relatively
inexperienced labor force so they can train them in the Japanese way
of doing things. They want to go somewhere so nobody will say, `At
Ford, we did it differently.''
   Gardner conceded Chrysler-Mitsubishi sought fresh faces.
   ``We didn't want to have another car plant that (would) have 20
years of experience transferred to our plant,'' he said. ``We wanted
some green people when it comes to building cars.''
   But he said any suggestion race was involved in site selection
was ``utter nonsense'' and any charge ``we selected a town to stay
away from a union ... is absolutely and unequivocally dead wrong.''
   The plant was built with a 100 percent unionized labor force.
   Bloomington Mayor Smart says the Japanese will be happy they
built here.
   ``When you get into any rural setting, people are not afraid to
put in long hours,'' he said. ``Here there's a satisfaction in
seeing the end result. You're just bred that way.''

   Following is a list of Japanese-associated auto plants in the
United States. The information is provided by company officials.
   _ Diamond-Star Motors Corp. in Normal, Ill., a joint
Chrysler-Mitsubishi venture, began producing Plymouth Lasers and
Mitsubishi Eclipses in September.
   The workforce is about 1,500 and could reach 2,900 by this fall.
By 1990, annual production will be 240,000 cars a year.
   _ Subaru-Isuzu Automotive Inc., next to Lafayette, Ind., a joint
venture of Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. and Isuzu Motors Limited, is
expected to begin producing cars and trucks this September.
   The plant will initially employ 1,700 workers and, depending on
the market, could expand to a workforce of 3,200 by 1992-93. By
1990, production of Isuzu Troopers and Pups and the Subaru Legacy
will total 120,000 vehicles a year.
   _ Mazda Motor Manufacturing (USA) Corp. in Flat Rock, Mich.,
began making the Mazda MX-6 and Ford's sporty Probe in September
1987. It has nearly 3,500 employees and produces about 240,000 cars
annually.
   _ Toyota Motor Manufacturing, U.S.A., Inc. in Georgetown, Ky.,
was dedicated in October. It has about 1,750 employees and produces
about 360 Camry sedans a day.
   By the end of 1989, it will produce 200,000 cars annually and
have 3,000 employees. An additional 500 workers will be added when a
power train plant that produces engines, axles and steering
components becomes operational in 1991.
   _ Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corp. U.S.A. in Smyrna, Tenn.,
opened in June 1983 and has 3,100 workers. The plant produces about
220,000 Sentra cars and Nissan light trucks annually.
   _ Honda of America Manufacturing Inc. in Marysville, Ohio, began
making motorcycles in 1979. Auto production started in 1982. The
company now has two plants at Marysville and one at Anna, Ohio. It
has expanded at Anna and is building a fourth plant in East Liberty,
Ohio. The workforce is 6,700 and expected to increase to 8,500 by
1991. This year, Honda is expected to produce 360,000 Accord and
Civic cars, as well as motorcycles.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., the only Japanese-affiliated
plant located out the country's midsection, opened in Fremont,
Calif., in 1984. The joint Toyota-General Motors venture has 2,640
employees and produces about 200,000 cars a year. It manufactures
the Corolla sedan and the Geo Prizm, a replacement for the Chevy
Nova.

   U.S. Market Share:
   _ Japanese companies increased their share of the U.S. market
from about 8 percent in 1976 to about 23 percent in 1987.
   _ An estimated 2.08 million Japanese imports and 737,513
``transplants'' _ cars built totally or partly by the Japanese at
U.S. sites _ were sold in this country last year. That accounted for
26.6 percent of the 10.52 million cars purchased in the United
States.
   Imports include cars such as the Dodge Colt, built by Mitsubishi
in Japan. Transplants include products of joint U.S.-Japanese
ventures, such as the Ford Probe, built by Mazda.
   _ The number of transplant autos built in the United States has
risen steadily. The Wefa Group, an economic consulting organization,
estimates Japanese transplants in North America will total 1.7
million cars in 1990, compared with 600,000 in 1986.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Imports:
   _ Japan exported 2.21 million cars to the United States in the
1987 fiscal year, which ended last March. The Japanese government
said shipments in the April-November period were 10.4 percent below
those of a year earlier, but it still estimates Japan will have
exported 2.2 million cars to this country when the current fiscal
year ends in March.
   In 1981, Japan imposed a voluntary export restraint in response
to U.S. political pressure. It first limited annual exports to the
United States to 1.68 million units. The cap was increased in steps
to 2.3 million units in 1985. It has remained there since.
   Some Japanese automakers feel the quota is outdated because
domestic car prices have become more attractive against the cost of
Japanese cars, driven upward as the yen doubled in value over the
last three years.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Exports:
   _ In 1986, North America produced 12.5 million vehicles and
exported 40,000. Japan produced 12.2 million vehicles, 6.6 million
of which were exported.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Japanese Investment:
   _ In the 1980s, Japanese automakers have invested $5 billion in
U.S. assembly plants for cars and light trucks.
   _ Seven automakers and more than 100 auto parts suppliers with
partial or total Japanese ownership are operating or building plants
in the United States. Since 1984, the number of Japanese-affiliated
auto suppliers has nearly doubled in this country.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Job Loss:
   _ A 1988 GAO report said Japanese-affiliated automakers could
cause the loss of 45,000 jobs in the industry in 1990 if there was a
high displacement rate (`transplant' autos built in lieu of domestic
cars), a production level of 1.8 million vehicles by those companies
and 50 percent of the cars' parts and materials were made in the
United States compared with 83 percent for traditional U.S.
automakers.
   But the UAW said the government underestimated the potential job
loss due to transplants. The union said up to 74,000 jobs could be
lost.
   _ The GAO estimated a job loss of 360,000 from 1985 to 1990 from
all factors, including transplants, gains in productivity, rising
auto imports and increased use of foreign parts. However, the UAW
estimate was 470,000, noting Japanese-affiliated plants have built
only a third of planned capacity.
   _ From 1985 to 1987, 169,000 auto manufacturing jobs have
disappeared. That includes workers at the plants as well as those
employed by industry suppliers.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Minorities:
   _ In 1984, according to reports filed with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, blacks comprised 17.2 percent of all workers
employed by the Big Three automakers and 8.4 percent of white-collar
employees.
   Blacks make up nearly 11 percent of the civilian labor force.
   _ General Motors Corp. estimated its 1987 payroll for its black
employees was $3 billion. The March 1988 Current Population Survey
estimated total 1987 wage and salary income for 12.9 million blacks
was $178.8 billion.
   So, although GM's black workers represented just six-tenths
percent of all black employees, they received 1.7 percent of the
nation's black wage and salary income in 1987.

   It's been called the Midwest's Silicon Valley. A
region known for rustic woods and clear waters is also a breeding
ground for the ultimate high-tech machine: the supercomputer. The
growing supercomputer industry in Wisconsin and Minnesota is the
subject of the second story in a four-part series, ``The Changing
Heartland,'' that explores the new economic order in the Midwest.

<DATELINE>EAU CLAIRE, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This land of sparkling waters and
towering trees was once home to brawny loggers who shaped a town's
past. Now it's a mecca for some of America's brainiest scientists,
plotting a path to the future.
   This is ``America's Dairyland,'' proclaimed on every Wisconsin
license plate. But cow country is swiftly developing into a
supercomputer corridor, where some of the fastest, costliest and
most mind-boggling machines in the world are created.
   With $50 million in incentives as a sweetener, this ex-lumber
mill town lured a different breed of builder: supercomputer wizard
Steve Chen, whose young company hopes to construct a new machine 100
times faster than any that exists. Target completion date: the early
1990s.
   ``Every state in the nation wanted this,'' said Michael Schatz,
Eau Claire's economic development specialist. ``It definitely is a
major coup. ... This has just as much impact as an auto plant would
have for Kentucky or Tennessee.''
   Chen's firm hasn't created many jobs yet and there's not even a
guaranteed product, but his locating here in 1987 further
establishes the upper Midwest as the nation's supercomputer capital.
   The region was already home to Cray Research Inc. and founder
Seymour Cray, the guru of supercomputers, as well as the industry's
second major U.S. player _ ETA Systems Inc., a subsidiary of Control
Data Corp.
   Now joining them is Chen's Supercomputer Systems Inc. They are
all within 100 miles of each other in northwestern Wisconsin and
southeastern Minnesota.
   They have followed a path laid down just after World War II, when
several retired naval intelligence officers founded Engineering
Research Associates in St. Paul, Minn., and built code-cracking
computers for the government. ERA was later bought out by UNIVAC,
which years later spawned Control Data.
   Cray helped start Control Data, then formed his own company in
1972.
   Cray Research, headquartered in Minneapolis, has a major base 11
miles from here, in Chippewa Falls. Cray recently expanded to
Colorado, but most of his workers are in the two Midwestern states.
   Cray hired Chen, who left to start his own firm 16 months ago.
Now these neighbor rivals are competing to create a machine faster
than those that already do billions of calculations a second and
help design cars, forecast weather and aid in weapons research.
   ``They're both after the fastest gun in the West,'' said Peter
Patton, a computer consultant in Minnesota. ``Chen's oiling up his
holster.''
   Having so much brainpower battling to build the world's biggest
and best supercomputer in so small a region lends new prominence to
a part of America probably better known for breweries and bitter
cold than breakthroughs.
   ``This places Minnesota and Wisconsin on the international map,''
said Patton, director of technology assessment at the Super
Performance Computing Service of Dataquest Inc., a
marketing-forecasting firm.
   ``It adds prestige. It's sort of the difference between a
Chevrolet assembly plant in your area and a Rolls Royce (plant),''
he said. ``They don't think of us as dairy and flour milling states
any more.''
   Some predict this industry will have a ripple effect, attracting
parts and supply businesses. Patton said hundreds of companies in
the Twin Cities area, such as Honeywell and 3M, are already involved
in advanced technology.
   Some have grander visions. ``The potential is here to develop
these businesses and offshoots into a mini-Silicon Valley,'' said
Dick Hansen, president of the First Wisconsin National Bank of Eau
Claire.
   But there are big differences between Silicon Valley and Chippewa
Valley.
   In California, the focus is on microprocessors _ materials for
many everyday products.
   Supercomputers are more elite, with only about 350 installed
worldwide, many in government and corporate offices, and expensive,
costing $10-25 million each, Patton said.
   ``In terms of dollars this is a very small corner of the total
computer market,'' said Tad Pinkerton, director of information
technology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ``Even if you
have 100 machines at $10 milion apiece, that's not a lot of money.''
   Some Midwesterners also say they don't care to duplicate some
things about the Silicon Valley, particularly its explosive growth.
   ``Wisconsin has a very progressive social environment, one which
is going to move cautiously in things like building,'' Pinkerton
said.
   Even Chen's company will grow slowly. Chen, who formed a
partnership with International Business Machines Corp., talks of
taking four to five years to build his computer. Employment, now
about 100, isn't expected to reach 1,000 until the late 1990s.
   Despite the wait, Eau Claire, population 58,000, had few qualms
about offering Chen a $50 million package of grants and federally
guaranteed loans, even though it was $4 million more than the city's
annual budget.
   The city is lending $1.5 million of the $31.2 million loan
package. Hansen's bank is responsible for the rest. The deal calls
for a federal agency to guarantee $25 million in loans, which
haven't been approved yet.
   Despite the risks, Schatz said, ``This was the chance of a
lifetime. It's the first time we seriously played with the big boys
and went after a nationally known famous person.''
   Eau Claire and other cities began wooing Chen when he left Cray
in September 1987 after the company canceled his supercomputer
project, saying his proposal was too risky and too costly.
   He decided on Eau Claire, in part to avoid moving the 40 Cray
workers he'd attracted to his company. Chen has also opened a
Chinese restaurant in town.
   His company has created an influx of new residents who Schatz
said are responsible for raising the average cost of a house to
$105,000, up $20,000 from 1987.
   ``You're always looking for clean, high-tech industry,'' Schatz
added. ``They pay high wages. It brings an intellect to your
community with scientists and engineers. It's an environment people
like to work in.''
   That wasn't always the image of this northwestern Wisconsin town,
named for its clear waters. In the 19th century, Eau Claire was
white-pine country, home to logger barons. With 20 sawmills on its
river banks, it was nicknamed ``Sawdust City.''
   A century later, in 1981, an almanac ranked Eau Claire No. 1 in
America for most taverns per person _ one for every 629 people.
   Schatz said being home to one of a handful of supercomputer
companies in the world will give Eau Claire new visibility. ``People
around the nation,'' he said, ``will know who we are now.''

<TEXT>
   They're super-swift high-tech superstars that can do anything
from design nuclear warheads to build a better yacht.
   Supercomputers are used by the government, the military,
universities and Fortune 500 companies to help crack codes, forecast
weather, design aircraft, conduct geological exploration or simulate
the effects of nuclear explosions.
   ``The supercomputer is important economically and socially,''
said Peter Patton, a computer consultant in Minnesota. ``They're
used in everything from the mundane to the sublime _ designing
appliances ... to developing new life-saving techniques and
surgery.''
   That range, he said, can help shape America's role in the world
economy.
   ``The whole name of the game is competitive advantage in the
international market,'' said Patton, director of technology
assessment at the Super Performance Computing Service of Dataquest
Inc., a marketing-forecasting firm. ``The key to maintaining that
competitive advantage is faster design, reduced government
certification time, better testing.''
   The two major U.S. supercomputer companies are Cray Research Inc.
and ETA Systems Inc., a subsidiary of Control Data Corp.
   Its competition: three Japanese computer giants _ Fujitsu,
Hitachi and NEC.
   There also are about three dozen smaller, so-called
``mini-supercomputer'' companies in the United States, Patton said.
   Some experts believe the Japanese are threatening America's
dominance of the industry. ``We opened a very large lead and we no
longer have that large lead,'' Patton said.
   One of Japan's main advantages, he said, is it has the ``lion's
share of semiconductor (computer chips) market. We gave up on the
semiconductor industry.''
   But other experts say it's too early to talk of the Japanese
overtaking the United States.
   ``Even though Cray machines use a lot of Japanese components, I
don't think it's fair to say they're ahead in any way, shape or
form,'' said Michael Burwen, president of Palo Alto Management
Group, a consulting firm.
   ``There are a lot of people who say the Japanese are a very big
threat to supercomputers,'' he said. ``I don't think the evidence is
in. The Japanese certainly have not been able to demonstrate they
can penetrate anything outside their home market in this business.''
   About 350 supercomputers have been installed worldwide. U.S.
customers include NASA, the National Cancer Institute and Los Alamos
National Laboratory, location of the first Cray, introduced in 1976.
   Supercomputers can do billions of calculations a second.
   For example, a Bible concordance _ an alphabetical referencing by
word _ that took a scholar 17 years to do in the mid-1700s and
required 1,000 hours on a computer in 1956 can be done on a Cray
supercomputer in 20 seconds, Patton said.
   Although experts sometimes disagree on what a supercomputer is,
it generally is described as the fastest, largest, most expensive
machine at any time _ one that can do problems others can't.
   Burwen also said 44 percent of all supercomputers are in private
industry, 37 percent in government installations, and 19 percent in
universities.
   Nowadays, supercomputers are changing industry, because products
``can not only be designed and prototyped on screen, but be tested
and evaluated ... and have complete data performance before you
touch tool to steel,'' he said.
   Automakers, for one, ``can do a design in six months instead of
18 months,'' he said. ``You can literally take years off the design
cycle.''
   Supercomputers have also begun to simulate crash testing for
autos.
   And oil companies use supercomputers to get the best production
in petroleum exploration.
   ``If they get 1 percent (more oil) out of a reservoir, it pays
for itself 100 times over,'' Patton said. ``What if it's a $10
million computer if you get $20 billion (more oil) out of a
reservoir?''
   Among Cray's customers are America's Big Three automakers,
Volkswagen, Fiat and petroleum giants such as Shell and Chevron.
   A Cray supercomputer also was used to help design Stars &amp;
Stripes, the yacht Dennis Conner sailed in 1987 when he won the
America's Cup. Two competing syndicates also used Cray technology,
said company spokesman John Swenson.
   Scientists designing supercomputers are toiling in an industry
constantly trying to produce faster machines.
   Cray plans to have a new supercomputer ready this year or next,
and it's expected to be 100 times faster than his original machine.
In 1992-94, he hopes to produce the Cray-4, 1,000 times more
powerful.
   And, Swenson said, that won't be the end. As he explained, ``We
still don't see the limit.''

<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The Indiana shoreline of Lake Michigan is home to
the nation's steel giants. And perhaps no Rust Belt city better
typifies a steel town than Gary. The steel slump of the '80s hit
hard in Gary, already struggling with crime, decay and a declining
tax base. But steel is making a comeback and Gary hopes it can, too.
The third story of a four-part series, ``The Changing Heartland,''
looks at the resurgence in Gary and northwestern Indiana.

<DATELINE>GARY, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This steel town has long been a four-letter
word for all that's gone wrong in industrial America: a shrinking
workforce, sooty skies, a sorry future.
   With the city's fate tied to steel's fortunes, when the industry
hurts, so does Gary. Now that steel is surging, this archetypal Rust
Belt city says it is on the mend, too.
   Unemployment is down, companies are moving in, real estate is
being snatched up. More importantly, Gary is looking beyond steel _
a lakefront marina is planned and an airport project is being pushed.
   ``We're on an upturn now,'' said Mayor Thomas Barnes. ``The
optimism we feel is not because we've resolved the problems that
exist. It's because we're right now on a track to resolving them.
There's growth as opposed to further decline. People are taking
another look at Gary.''
   They will still find a depressed city _ shuttered stores, gutted
homes and a bleak downtown with no hotel or department store. But
there also is new prosperity due, in part, to a leaner, profitable
steel industry that's been boosted by increasing demand, import
limits, the low dollar and new technology.
   After losses of almost $12 billion in 1982-86, the industry
nationwide earned $1 billion in 1987 and is expected to double that
for 1988.
   That improvement has contributed to an upturn in Gary and other
parts of northwestern Indiana, site of the world's greatest
concentration of steel-making capacity. For example:
   _ Five steel companies in Porter and Lake counties, the latter
including Gary, have spent more than $2.5 billion on their
facilities since 1982, said the Indiana Steel Advisory Commission.
   Indiana is America's No. 1 steel producer; 22 percent of the
nation's steel is made there. The industry pumps almost $20 million
daily into Indiana's economy.
   _ Unemployment in the Gary-Hammond, Ind., area fell from 15.7
percent in 1982-83 to 9.5 percent in 1987; the 1987 numbers would
have been lower but for a six-month walkout at USS Gary Works, the
city's biggest employer and flagship of USX Corp.
   November's unemployment rate was 6.1 percent; 1988 was the first
year this decade without double-digit employment in any month. Those
figures, however, do not reflect huge population losses. The area's
labor force shrunk by 38,100 from 1980 to November 1988.
   _ New and expanding businesses in the Gary area have filled 12.4
million square feet of industrial space and created almost 6,500
jobs since 1984. Much of the growth is steel-related.
   Gary ``is one of the best heavy industrial locations in
America,'' said John Gates, an investor and redeveloper. ``You're
close to all the major manufacturers in the United States. Most of
these peoples' customers are nearby. You've got very inexpensive
rents and real estate costs.
   ``If someone needs steel, you're going to be near the biggest and
cheapest source of supply nationwide,'' added Gates, who has helped
24 companies, some from West Germany and Austria, expand or settle
in the area.
   The new-and-improved status may even be reflected in a 1988 Money
magazine survey that ranked the Gary-Hammond area 41st among 300
U.S. living spots _ two slots above considerably more picturesque
Honolulu and up from 92nd place a year earlier.
   That might seem surprising, considering Gary's reputation as
aging, crime-infested and polluted. City planner Taghi Arshami says
that's more myth than reality, though he concedes Gary's center
section, with a vacancy rate equal to 20 acres, is devastated.
   ``The problem we have generally for downtown is lack of
investment, lack of confidence on the part of business and on the
part of banks that are not willing to put the money down,'' he said.
   But he is optimistic about developing Gary's downtown into a
public and service sector hub, noting that 12,000 people work there.
   Some of Gary's image problems stem from lean times of the last
decade. Jobs and people disappeared, unemployment soared. Gary's
population, now about 137,000, fell 10 percent from 1980 to 1986.
Even now, experts say, growth in northwestern Indiana is occurring
in rural areas.
   The mills shrank, too, while becoming more efficient.
Northwestern Indiana now has 35,300 steelworkers, a 47 percent drop
from 1979. USS Gary Works has 7,500 workers, compared with
21,000-22,000 in the late 1970s.
   Although mill investments spur related business, some say Gary is
in a precarious position because it remains so dependent on steel.
   ``The danger of Gary is not that they aren't doing fairly well,''
said Frank Cassell, professor emeritus of industrial relations at
Northwestern University. ``(But) they're likely to delude themselves
into thinking that what they're doing is the most powerful
influence.''
   Instead, he said, bigger factors are external _ demand, the
dollar and the nation's economy. ``Gary is doing good work for
itself. That's commendable,'' he said. ``(But) one doesn't want to
think that's the whole picture.''
   Some business leaders concede the region has done a poor job of
diversifying, but others point to such changes as the growth of the
health industry, which provides 20,400 jobs in the area.
   Gary is also touting recreation. Promotional brochures feature
the Indiana Dunes and Lake Michigan, photos of children bicycling
along the beach, a golden sunset over shimmering waters and a local
boy who made good _ Michael Jackson.
   ``We have one of the largest fresh water bodies anywhere in the
world,'' Barnes said. ``We have far from taken full advantage of
it.''
   Gary hopes to rectify that with an ambitious $150-$200 million,
1,400-slip marina adjacent to the USS site that could eventually
include a hotel, shopping center and amphitheater. Officials hope to
build the first 250 slips this year.
   Gary also hopes to have the third commercial airport in the
Chicago area. Its present airport provides only charter and private
corporate service.
   An expanded airport would relieve congestion at O'Hare
International and Midway in Chicago. One report said it would
attract 6.5 million passengers to Gary annually and create 122,000
jobs with a payroll of $1.6 billion.
   Though these projects are critical, Barnes said the city also has
``a much healthier manner of looking at problems,'' whether it's
cleaning up illegal dumps or addressing housing needs.
   ``There's already a renewed spirit of cooperation that hasn't
existed in 20 years,'' said Bill Brown, transportation planner for
the Northwestern Indiana Regional Planning Commission.
   ``People,'' he said, ``feel a lot more confident about Gary's
future.''

   Here are some facts about the steel industry, provided by the
American Iron and Steel Institute. They represent reports from 25
companies representing 80 percent of the industry.
   _ Profits-Losses: The nation's steel industry is expected to post
a 1988 profit of about $2 billion. In 1987, profits were $1.02
billion, following losses of almost $12 billion in 1982-86.
   The rising profits are attributed to a general strengthening in
the world steel market and a moderate increase in demand.
   _ Shipments: Domestic steel mill shipments are estimated to have
risen from 76.7 million tons in 1987 to about 83 million tons in
1988 _ an 8.2 percent increase.
   _ Production: Raw steel production jumped from 89.2 million tons
in 1987 to almost 100 million tons in 1988 _ a 12 percent increase.
   _ Employment: Average industry employment in 1988 was 170,000,
slightly above the 1987 average of 163,000, the lowest since the
institute started keeping records in 1933. The industry posted a
record-high employment of 650,200 in 1953.
   _ Imports: Imports in 1988 will have accounted for about 20.5
percent of the steel shipped to consumers, compared with 20.9
percent in 1987. Imports reached a high of 26.4 percent in 1984, the
year when the Voluntary Restraint Agreements set a goal of reducing
imports to 20.2 percent of the U.S. market. The agreement expires
this year.
   _ State Production: Indiana leads the nation in steel production,
with about 22 percent of the steel made there. Ohio accounts for 18
percent and Pennsylvania 13 percent.

   When the farm crisis of the '80s swept
mid-America, it took a heavy toll on Iowa: folks lost their land,
Main Streets collapsed and young people deserted their hometowns.
Today, however, despite 1988's withering drought, Iowa's fortunes
are reversing. The final story in a four-part series, ``The Changing
Heartland,'' looks at the upturn in Iowa's economy.

<TEXT>
   When Dennis Keitel returned from a
life abroad two years ago, he yearned to settle on the soil he once
called home. He was ready for Iowa, but Iowa wasn't ready for him.
   Jobs were scarce. So was optimism. People were moving out,
merchants were following. But over time, misery has given way to
mending.
   Iowa, a state that once typified the decline and despair of rural
America, is on the rebound. Consider Keitel, an Iowa native who
returned to a state thousands fled, found work where two years ago
there was none, and is praising a land that not long ago was pitied.
   ``I think this place is a gold mine,'' says Keitel, a 36-year-old
engineer who grew up on an eastern Iowa farm.
   ``The Iowa economy is coming on strong,'' boasts Gov. Terry
Branstad. ``We know we still have a long way to go, but we've come a
long ways.''
   Unemployment is down, revenues are up and there's a sense the
worst is over. Some claim a bust-to-boom assessment is too rosy and
premature, but the declining dollar, export opportunities, price
supports and a diversifying economy have contributed to a
turnaround. Consider:
   _ The value of Iowa farmland rose 20.4 percent in 1988, prompting
the Des Moines Register headline ``Iowa Dirt Turns to Gold Again.''
The increase, reported in an Iowa State University study, was the
largest since the mid-1970s. From 1981 to 1986, land values had
plummeted 63 percent.
   _ Iowa's labor force reached an all-time high in October: 1.5
million people working or seeking jobs. Unemployment was 3.5
percent, the lowest since November 1979. In some areas, jobs
outnumber residents. Mount Pleasant has about 5,000 people of
working age but almost 12,000 jobs.
   Iowa soon plans to set up a nationwide toll-free number to lure
back ex-Iowans who left in search of work.
   _ Iowa is expected to have a $180 million budget surplus in the
1989 and 1990 fiscal years, a panel of financial experts said in
December, although some of that will likely be eaten up with federal
mandates.
   _ One in five Iowa farmers has substantial money troubles, down
from one in three in 1984-85, said Neil Harl, an Iowa State
economics professor.
   _ Deere &amp; Co., the state's largest private employer with 14,800
workers, posted record fourth-quarter and year-end earnings.
   _ After six years in which Iowa lost almost 100,000 people, the
Census Bureau reported last month state population increased by
11,000 from 1987 to 1988.
   Despite such numbers, some say last summer's drought will have a
lingering impact. They also worry the state's upturn is bypassing
rural areas where schools have closed, young people have departed
and Main Street merchants have closed up shop.
   ``We haven't turned the corner yet by any means,'' said Dave
Ostendorf of Prairiefire, a rural advocacy group. ``Many of the
rural counties still have poverty rates exceeding 20 percent.''
   Branstad says, though, that no state enjoys ``uniform prosperity.
What we want to do is help those areas that aren't doing as well to
help themselves.''
   The state uses lottery proceeds, for instance, for economic
development, some of the money going for loans, aid to local
communities or research projects.
   Already, the upswing and growth in the meat packing and farm
equipment industries have helped hard-hit blue-collar areas. In
Waterloo, unemployment fell from 8.8 percent last January to 4.3
percent in November.
   ``People feel we've bottomed out,'' said Jim Lawrence, president
of the Waterloo Chamber of Commerce.
   Deere, which has a giant local operation, has recalled workers; a
leather processing plant recently opened, and a new IBP Inc. hog
slaughtering plant is being built, Lawrence said.
   In Mason City, about 1,500 new jobs, many of them service sector
and health-related, will be created in 1989 alone, compared with
about 2,000 in the last five years combined, said Tom Jolas, an
economic development consultant to the city.
   Iowa's recovery is due, in part, to a declining dollar that makes
grain and other products more competitive on the world market, said
state economist Harvey Siegelman.
   ``There will be Winnebagos going to Europe, beef to Japan and
Deere tractors all over the world,'' he said.
   Just as critical is Iowa's effort to reduce its reliance on
agriculture.
   ``The key to success is diversification,'' Branstad said. ``Some
of it actually is building off the agricultural economy that already
exists and finding new uses for products.''
   Branstad said Iowa has also targeted several industries for
development: telecommunications, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and
insurance. Des Moines already is an insurance capital.
   Mount Pleasant, 28 miles from the Mississippi River, learned to
diversify decades ago. It's paid off. The town's business roster
includes such corporate names as Motorola, Cargill and Goodyear. A
Wal-Mart distribution center opened in 1985.
   Mount Pleasant is also home to a large fireplace maker, a bulk
mail distributor that claims more outgoing postage volume than Las
Vegas, and a school bus manufacturer.
   ``We set an example of how we can control our own future,'' said
Glenda Griffin, the local chamber's vice president. ``We appreciate
the help of the state and federal government, but we will not sit
back and depend on them.''
   Mount Pleasant never hit the depths some Iowa communities sank to
in the mid-1980s, though the county unemployment rate was 8.1
percent in 1982-83. In November, it was 2.5 percent.
   In the last six months, two motels, four stores and a truck stop
have opened. Officials say property values rose from $45 million to
$130 million in the last decade; retail sales jumped 18.7 percent
from March 1986 to March 1988.
   Mount Pleasant has also held onto its young people, offering jobs
involving computers and lasers.
   ``There isn't a small town in the state of Iowa that has any more
sophisticated industry than we have,'' said Mayor Tom Vilsack.
   Keitel returned from Saudia Arabia in 1986, ending up as an
engineer in Connecticut when he couldn't find work in Iowa. Last
fall he found a job in Mount Pleasant.
   ``Iowa still has a lot to offer, even with all of its problems,''
he said. ``We haven't lost our sense of values. The quality of life
still means more than the almighty dollar.''
   Vilsack has another explanation:
   ``We can't do a lot about what's plaguing the small-town farmer.
We've given families the opportunity to be in control of their own
lives. Iowa's got to take its destiny in its own hands.''

<HEAD>Kangaroo for Dinner? Australian Conservationists Object</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD BILL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kangaroos may soon end up on dinner
plates in New South Wales, Australia's most populous state. Animal
welfare groups are hopping mad.
   They contend few Australians will want to feast on their national
symbol but that tourists might.
   Conservationists called the decision ``disastrous'' and
potentially dangerous because kangaroos carry a host of diseases.
   ``Paul Hogan (the comic star of ``Crocodile Dundee'') is luring
American tourists to Sydney, but all they are likely to see is a
bloodbath,'' said Sue Arnold of Australians for Animals, the
country's largest wildlife conservation group.
   ``Kangaroos are shot by helicopter, poisoned, snared and used for
pet food as well as an export industry. Now they're being offered
for domestic human consumption. How can they survive?'' she said in
an interview.
   Hogan, hailed by the tourist industry for his ``throw another
shrimp on the barbie'' commercials that brought a record 2 million
visitors to Australia's bicentennial celebrations in 1988, has a new
series to be screened in the United States in February.
   In the commercial, as reported by the Sydney Morning Herald,
Hogan says that ``God had a sense of humor'' when he desposited in
Australia ``the famous giant hopping mouse'' _ the kangaroo.
   Tourism Minister Graham Richardson said the commercials are
expected to contribute to a 20 percent growth in tourism this year.
Five million tourists are expected by the year 2000, said Bill Gray,
Manager of the government-funded Tourism Australia.
   Officials said a decision Jan. 6 to harvest kangaroos for human
consumption will not endanger wildlife.
   The News South Wales health minister, Peter Collins, said the
program is for farming kangaroos, not depleting wildlife stocks. The
decision reverses a longstanding ban in New South Wales, of which
Sydney is the tourist gateway.
   Kangaroo meat already is consumed in the states of South
Australia and Western Australia. Its is described extremely lean,
full of protein and somewhat gamy, not unlike venison.
   Collins said his department would ensure that kangaroo meat is
safe to eat, but Arnold and others questioned how the state
government planned to farm the creatures and maintain a standard
that makes them fit for consumption.
   Australia's population is 16.5 million. The government's National
Parks &amp; Wildlife Service estimates the kangaroo population at about
15 million. An annual culling quota is about 3 million, with the
meat used for pet food and skins turned into such goods as wallets
and purses for export.
   ``What other country in the world slaughters its national
symbol?'' said Richard Jones, a member of the New South Wales
Parliament who was elected in 1987 on a platform of animal welfare.
   Arnold said kangaroos carry a range of diseases, such as
salmonella, tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis and hydatid cysts, a worm
that can be fatal.
   Farmers regard the kangaroo as a pest. The Greenpeace and Animal
Liberation organizations, both supporters of Australians For
Animals, said the decision represents a victory for the farm lobby.
   The Canberra Times, a newspaper in Australia's capital, said the
kangaroo industry is in chaos.
   It said there is compelling evidence of widespread illegal
shooting and few controls on the transportation of skins and
carcasses inter-state.
   Only licensed professional shooters are supposed to hunt
kangaroos but conservationists and others maintain the government
regulation is loosely enforced.
   ``At the end of the day, the only conclusion to be drawn is that
the government controls on the kangaroo industry are worthless,''
the newspaper said in an editorial.
   Christine Townsend, spokeswoman for Animal Liberation, called the
decision a disaster.
   ``It simply commercializes our wildlife,'' she said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ronald Reagan leaves the White House with
shoulders squared as ever, his wits and wit undiminished by the
burdens which sent his recent predecessors into quicker retirement
and aged some of them almost beyond his years.
   The Western sun beckons, and Reagan, nearly 78, enters the winter
of his public life without melancholy, even as he claimed, with
Shakespeare's assistance, that his departure evoked ``such sweet
sorrow'' in his heart.
   More sweet than sorrow for this political Romeo. He relinquishes
his power with relish, happily telling his conservative
revolutionaries in his farewell address Thursday that ``My friends,
we did it.''
   History will be the judge of that, but one Reagan success is
indisputable: He stayed the course, and leaves the presidency with
the same charm and equilibrium with which he entered it. No man,
especially in the nuclear age, has proved so immune to Henry Adams'
observation long ago that power is poison, and that its effect upon
presidents is inexorably tragic.
   Reagan ``is totally comfortable with the fact of leaving and more
relaxed about it every day,'' says spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
``He's very satisfied that he has done everything he could do.''
   Reagan, in a typically light moment, said recently the first item
on his California agenda with be a long nap. ``Come to think of
it,'' he added, ``things won't be all that much different, after
all.'' A year earlier he observed that ``It's true that hard work
never killed anybody. But I figure, why take the chance?''
   He was, in fact, an often inattentive president, above the usual
fray, operating more by instinct than intellect. Ever maddening to
his critics, he made an art of sitting things out, like the poker
champion who knows when to walk away from the table, when to return
and bet the ranch.
   Eight years ago, he promised a ``revolution of ideas'' for
America. It may take decades to resolve the debate over how much he
really changed the national course, and how much, for that matter,
the national interest changed his own ideas. But certainly, in an
era of glass-jawed politicians, he went the distance without
disabling scar or scorn, and set a modern standard for survival.
   There's just a hint of gray now on that old Irish head, and he
needs a hearing aid in both his ears. But nobody has aged less in
the presidency, even in simpler times. Which is all the more
remarkable, considering he was the oldest man ever to enter it, that
he was nearly mortally shot that first year, that he needed
surgeries, major and minor, for cancer.
   Or that his administration suffered failures and embarrassments
that surely would have undone other presidents _ a staggering
national debt, the loss of hundreds of Americans in Lebanon, the
bizarre sale of arms to Iran and the diversion of the profits to
rebels in Central America, the criminal convictions of close aides
and a pervasive ``sleaze'' quotient through the years, colossal
slips of the tongue and manglings of fact, and the worst stock
market crash in six decades.
   Through all of that, the Iran-Contra affair opened the only crack
in his famed Teflon veneer, triggering an overnight, 20-percent drop
in his popularity rating. But even as the arms-for-hostages deal
knocked him back on his heels, it was not, as diagnosed by some
Democrats, an Achilles rupture. As usual, Ronald Reagan bounced back.
   He had many triumphs, and made good on much of his agenda, mostly
on domestic policy the first term and foreign policy the second. He
lowered taxes, radically altered the manner in which they are
levied, improved the national defense and raised the national
spirit. He relentlessly pushed the country through two painful years
of high unemployment and recession that led to an unprecedented six
straight years of recovery and growth, lowering inflation from 13
percent in 1980 to about 4 percent today. Unemployment fell by half,
to just over 5 percent.
   His foreign policy produced a surprising number of successes.
Foremost among them, in Reagan's words, ``we have, the past few
years, forged a satisfying new closeness with the Soviet Union.''
Some of that, doubtlessly, is more Reagan's Irish luck than his
doing _ Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, after all,
didn't have Mikhail Gorbachev to deal with.
   But Reagan still had his own hands to play. Despite European
resistance, he deployed Pershing II missiles aimed at the Soviet
Union, and, ignoring domestic pleas for a nuclear ``freeze,'' stuck
with his ``zero-option'' plan for intermediate nuclear weapons for
six years. It paid off. The INF treaty eventually signed, the first
ever to reduce nuclear arsenals, was entirely on his terms.
   He sent arms to the Afghan rebels, and the Soviets are finally
leaving Afghanistan. He sent the Navy to the Persian Gulf, and Iran
and Iraq called off their long, hideous war. Many believe his
measured use of U.S. firepower, especially against Moammar Gadhafy's
Libya, contributed to a decline in international terrorism. His
administration also helped end or temper regional conflicts in
Africa and Southeast Asia.
   The results weren't so rewarding in Central America, and
Americans are still held hostage in Lebanon. But Reagan, portrayed
by his opponents in 1980 as a trigger-happy cowboy, leaves with a
remarkable record for statesmanship.
   His presidency produced many contradictions. He campaigned on a
promise to abolish two cabinet departments, Energy and Education,
and wound up instead adding one: Veterans Affairs. He put
conservatives in the nation's courts, but his ``revolution'' barely
disturbed local electorates, and Congress remained in Democratic
hands.
   He promised to balance the budget, and, to this day, blames
Congress that it wasn't done. But he never even proposed a budget
that cae close. Instead, the national debt soared from $900 billion
to over $2.6 trillion while he was in office, a painful tax against
the nation's _ and George Bush's _ future.
   For all his talk about a ``safety net'' for the nation's poor and
disadvantaged, more families live below the poverty line now than
when he took office. Similarly, he offered more rhetoric than remedy
for the nation's drug crisis.
   To the consternation of even some Republican allies in Congress,
he often governed more by anecdote than analysis, stubbornly
clinging to notions that had no foundation in fact. He once
asserted, in an anti-abortion speech, that babies have been born
after just three months of pregnancy, ``and have lived, the record
shows, to grow up and be normal.'' But the White House could produce
no such record, and the American College of Obstetrics and
Gynecology said there was no solid evidence that fetuses less than
six months old can survive.

   Reagan repeatedly told the story of the woman who bought an
orange with her food stamps, then spent the change on a bottle of
vodka. She couldn't be found, either. Change from food stamps,
incidentally, is limited to 99 cents.
   To illustrate the evils of school busing for racial balance, he
had a tale about how the daughter of the very woman who brought the
landmark 1954 school desegregation suit now had to be bused miles
from her home to attend class. But Kim Smith, daughter of Linda
Brown Smith, went to school two blocks from her home in Topeka, Kan.
What's more, Topeka didn't have school busing for racial balance.
   Reagan had lots of those. Remember the killer trees?
   Sometimes, he tripped over his own tongue as well as the facts.
President Samuel Doe of Liberia became ``Chairman Moe,'' and an open
microphone caught him more than once in hip shots like ``All right,
my fellow Americans, I am pleased to tell you today that I have
signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing
in five minutes.''
   Not everybody thought these things funny, but Reagan, the Great
Communicator, usually got away unscathed and unfazed. In part,
doubtlessly, it was because he had such an infectious ability to
disarm his critics by laughing at himself. And nobody deprecated
Reagan like Reagan.
   Before the Discovery launch last year, he was asked if he'd like
to go into space. ``I've been there for several years,'' he
deadpanned.
   That kind of humor and modesty went a long way to stir a nation's
perception of Reagan as at once a normal man and a very special one.
America laughed with him, trusted him, admired his schoolboy
optimism. And it forgave his indiscretions as family mischief.
   Educator and management consultant Eugene Jennings wrote in
``Anatomy of Power,'' that ``great leaders, in bearing and behavior,
make a distinction between authority and power,'' and Reagan ``never
appears as an authority figure.''
   Two other keys to Reagan's success, Jennings said, were his
ability to communicate his sense of values, and his willingness to
limit priorities. While Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter inundated
Congress and the public, he noted, Reagan called forth one issue at
a time, never scattering his shot.
   Dwight David Eisenhower was the last president to serve two full
terms, but he left tired and with his successor, John F. Kennedy,
having campaigned on a promise ``to get America moving again.''
   Reagan came along at a time when it appeared the national mood
would hold any president to a single term. The presidency had been
weakened by the overlapping traumas of Vietnam and Watergate, and,
while Gerald Ford and Carter restored the integrity of the office,
the country remained wearied as it confronted the frustrations of an
energy crisis, runaway inflation and the the hostage-taking of
Americans in Iran.
   Carter, in an ill-advised speech that sounded his own political
epitaph, complained of a national malaise, in which Americans
suffered ``a crisis of confidence.'' By the time the voters turned
him out after four years, Jimmy Carter had aged 10. It seemed that
way with Johnson and Nixon, too.
   Ronald Reagan will be 78 on Feb. 6. But he looks and acts
remarkably like the man who arrived in Washington eight years ago,
full of exuberance. His waistline may have expanded an inch, but not
much more has swelled. He arrived with a size 7 hat. It still fits,
and that's a major reason why the nation remains so fond of him.

   As anyone knows who has been outdoors on a
windy winter day, moving air can seem to go right through layer
after layer of clothing, chilling a person to the bone.
   And that wind chill is more than just a nasty sensation, or a
number provided by the local weathercaster. It can be a serious
hazard at this time of year.
   Those especially vulnerable to the dangers of cold are the very
young and the very old, medical experts point out. But virtually
anyone can become a victim of hypothermia, or extreme cooling of the
body.
   The wind chill exists all the time, of course. Consider the
pleasant summer day when it suddenly seems cold after emerging from
a swimming pool.
   That's wind chill at work too, but it's not much of a hazard then.
   Come this time of year the wind can whisk away body heat faster
than you can say ``Jack Frost,'' leaving you shivering or worse.
   The reason is the body's own cooling mechanism depends on
evaporation of moisture, a process that is very effective in
removing heat.
   Moving air carries away molecules of evaporated water and the air
that the body has warmed. More water then evaporates into the dry
air, which the body has to heat, the result is that the process
makes the body even cooler.
   And that, in reality, is the problem.
   The wind doesn't make it colder, it carries away heat to make it
cold faster.
   If the air is at 20 degrees Fahrenheit and the wind is 20 miles
per hour the windchill is minus 10 degrees.
   People unfortunately exposed to these conditions won't actually
cool down to minus 10. At the worst they will stop cooling at 20
degrees, when they reach the air temperatrure.
   But they will get there faster, cooling at the same rate as if
the temperature were minus 10.
   So what this all means is listen to the latest weather reports
before leaving the house and dress for the weather. Layers of
clothing are more effective than one or two thick garments.
   Since more than half of the heat produced by the body can be lost
through the head and neck, a cap or hat is vital in winter, the
Center for Environmental Physiology points out.
   Trapped air is the key to insulation, and there are several ways
to do this. Animals use fur. Birds opt for feathers.
   People can manage the same effect with layers of warm clothing,
especially wool and down garments which trap air in layers.
   Cold puts extreme stress on the body, which can prove deadly to
people with heart of lung disease and to those whose bodies have
poor heat regulation systems _ the very young and very old
especially.
   The ill elderly can suffer at temperatures as high as 60 degrees,
according to physicians, who urge that friends and family keep track
of the old and ill at this time of year.
   Signs of hypothermia include changes in a person's appearance or
behavior, uncontrollable shivering or total lack of shivering when
it would be expected; stiff muscles, slow or irregular heartbeat,
slurred speech, weak pulse, confusion, drowsiness and a drop in body
temperature.
   Victims of hypothermia need rewarming and medical attention, the
Department of Health and Human Services stresses.
   While waiting for emergency medical help, HHS experts say,
prevent further heat loss by wrapping the victim in a warm blanket.
Hot water bottles or a warm heating pad _ not hot _ can help if
placed on the victim's abdomen.
   If the victim is alert, small quantities of food and drink can
help, but never give alcoholic beverages.
   Warming can also be accomplished by lying close to the victim and
using one's body heat to warm them. But do not handle the victim too
roughly. Rubbing, for example, can make things worse, the HHS
experts warn.
   Besides the elderly, infants are in danger of hypothermia because
their body heating systems may not yet be fully developed.
   Thus, parents and other adults need to pay close attention to the
warmth of tots, Make sure they wear a cap, limit a baby's time
outdoors and keep them as dry as possible, since moisture carries
off heat quickly.

<HEAD>Oil Spills Still Fact Of Life After 20 Years Of Environmental Progress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OCEAN SHORES, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty years ago this month, a huge
oil spill in Santa Barbara, Calif., helped launch the environmental
movement with wrenching images of blackened beaches and lifeless,
oil-soaked birds.
   This past week along the rugged Washington coast, it appeared
that despite 20 years of progress in environmental protection, some
things haven't changed.
   ``It's horrible,'' said Clifford Perry, 44, a volunteer at a
makeshift ``dirty bird hospital'' set up in this tourist town's
convention center to treat thousands of birds mired in a Dec. 22 oil
spill.
   ``Imagine going into a grocery store and suddenly seeing oil over
all the food, then going outside and finding oil on your car, on
your house, everything,'' Perry said Thursday, scrubbing a terrified
seabird in a pan of soapy water. ``That's how it is for these
animals.''
   It was this kind of scene that environmentalists hoped to prevent
when they rallied together after the Jan. 28, 1969, blowout of an
offshore Union Oil Co. well in the Santa Barbara Channel.
   That accident spread an estimated 3 million gallons of crude oil
along 150 miles of the southern California coast. Globs of tar
blackened rocky cliffs and sandy beaches. Greasy mist coated
beachside mansions. At least 3,600 birds died, even as volunteers
worked around the clock to wash the oil from their feathers.
   Disgust and anger translated quickly into political action,
spearheaded by a Santa Barbara group called Get Oil Out, better
known as GOO.
   Environmental awareness soon became politically fashionable, and
the 1970s produced a raft of legislation tightening safety
procedures required of oil producers and transporters. The
Environmental Protection Agency was born, and the Coast Guard was
ordered to beef up inspections of oil tankers and barges.
   Oil interests and environmentalists agree that technological
advances of the past two decades also have made the oil industry
safer.
   Yet oil spills remain as much a fact of life as they were 20
years ago. Some 10,000 to 15,000 spills into U.S. waters are
reported every year during transportation and storage of oil, Coast
Guard officials say. Offshore drilling contributes 1,300 to 1,500
more spills a year.
   The vast majority of spills are small, sometimes no more than a
gallon or two, but major spills are still a regular occurrence.
   1988 was a particularly bad year:
   On Jan. 2, a storage tank collapsed upstream of Pittsburgh, Pa.,
spilling 1 million gallons of diesel fuel into the Monongahela River
and affecting water supplies in three states.
   In April, 365,000 gallons of crude oil spilled from a refinery in
Martinez, Calif.
   In July, a tanker crashed into a mooring structure in Corpus
Christi, Texas, spilling 630,000 gallons of crude oil.
   In September, a Mississippi River tanker scraped bottom and
spilled 1 million gallons of heavy oil.
   Finally, on Dec. 22, a tugboat tore a gash in the barge it was
towing in rough seas off Grays Harbor, Wash., spilling up to 231,000
gallons of heavy oil. Storms and strong currents spread the oil
along 300 miles of coastline; the worst damage was along some of the
Northwest's most pristine beaches, in Washington's Olympic National
Park and British Columbia's Pacific Rim National Park.
   About 6,000 birds have died; 3,000 more were spotted floundering
along beaches and were taken to rescue centers like the one at Ocean
Shores. The painstaking bird cleanup may not be finished until the
end of this month, and officials said they'll consider themselves
lucky if half the cleaned birds survive.
   Like the 1969 Santa Barbara spill, the Washington accident
promises to provide ammunition for foes of oil development.
   Washington Gov. Booth Gardner toured the Ocean Shores bird
hospital and vowed to continue fighting oil exploration that the
Interior Department is planning for federal waters off the state's
Olympic Peninsula.
   Environmentalists in Washington, Oregon and California said the
spill will bolster their efforts to keep offshore drilling at bay.
They also want the Coast Guard to tighten its inspections of oil
transporters, and they are lobbying for better methods of assessing
the ecological damage of oil spills.
   ``This spill has certainly brought home to people that we can't
wait for things to happen. We have to get involved now,'' said David
Ortman, Northwest representative of Friends of the Earth.
   But an industry spokesman said those who would prevent oil spills
should not oppose offshore drilling. Less offshore development will
mean greater reliance on tanker-delivered foreign oil, which has a
much higher record of spills, said Mike Fergus, spokesman for the
Western States Petroleum Association.
   Offshore oil drilling has an excellent safety record, he said.
Between 1980 and 1987, U.S. offshore oil platforms spilled a total
of 291 barrels of oil while producing about 453 million barrels of
crude oil, he said. A standard barrel of crude oil contains 42 U.S.
gallons.
   ``To say no more oil development offshore is not reasonable,
given the demand that this country has for oil,'' Fergus said.
   And so the arguments rage on, as they have for 20 years. In Santa
Barbara, GOO still exists (so does the goo _ several barrels a day
of crude still bubble up from the ocean floor near the well that
blew out in 1969. This seepage is not counted in the spill figures
quoted by Fergus.)
   GOO didn't get the oil industry out, but the group claims it
helped limit the growth of drilling and forced safety precautions
that otherwise would not have been taken.
   In 1969, 10 oil platforms dotted the the Santa Barbara Channel.
Today there are 22, with applications pending for at least six more.
   Without citizen action, ``we suspect there would be two to three
times as many platforms as there are now,'' said Robert Hopps,
president of GOO.
   The environmental movement has changed a lot in 20 years. ``A lot
of our membership has died off, literally,'' Hopps said.
   But now, as then, the sight of an oily bird strikes something
deep with the American conscience. Last weekend, 1,000 people
reported to the Ocean Shores bird hospital to ask if they were
needed.
   ``We all use oil,'' said volunteer Perry, still clutching the
oil-soaked bird. ``I guess we have to pay the price for it.''

   The Treasury Department has taken under
advisement a Customs Service decision to classify imported sport
utility vehicles like the Suzuki Samurai, and most small vans as
trucks, subjecting them to duty rates 10 times higher than those for
cars, an agency spokesman said Thursday night.
   The spokesman, who requested anonymity, said the department
decided Thursday to review the ruling, will assess the case and make
a legal decision.
   Last week, Deputy Customs Commissioner Michael Lane said that in
the past, these vehicles sometimes had been classified as cars, upon
which a 2.5 percent duty is imposed, and at other times as trucks,
subject to a 25 percent duty.
   The deciding factor often was whether the vehicles were fitted
with back seats and other amenities.
   Lane said auto industry officials have estimated the ruling could
affect 100,000 to 250,000 or more vehicles, many of which would be
switched from the car to truck category and could net the government
hundred of millions of dollars in higher tariffs.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., trying to cleanse
its dirtied image from the Wall Street insider trading scandal, has
offered top jobs to two ex-chairmen of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, including the one who first authorized a probe that led
to the financial giant's current problems.
   John S. R. Shad, who headed the SEC from 1981 to 1987 and now is
envoy to the Netherlands, confirmed Thursday through a spokesman at
the U.S. embassy there that he had been approached by Drexel about
becoming chairman, but he did not say whether he would accept.
   The nation's fifth-largest securities firm also asked another
ex-SEC chairman, Roderick M. Hills, husband of U.S. trade
representative-designate Carla Hills, about the possibility of
serving on its board of directors.
   Hills, who ran the SEC from 1975-77 and is now an independent
trade consultant in Washington, also confirmed Drexel had approached
him but declined to comment further.
   It was under Shad's auspices that the SEC began a major
investigation of Drexel in late 1986, which resulted in a massive
civil enforcement action in September and a record securities-fraud
plea deal between the firm and the Justice Department, reached last
month but still not finalized.
   Shad ordered the Drexel probe after the firm was implicated in
extensive wrongdoing by Ivan F. Boesky, the speculator and inside
trader now serving a three-year prison term.
   ``The firm's objective is to develop a fresh outlook on the
problems and opportunities it faces, and to continue to make an
important contribution to the nation's capital markets,'' Drexel
said in a brief statement Thursday disclosing the job offers to Shad
and Hills.
   ``The firm continues to enjoy the loyalty and support of the vast
majority of its employees, and investment banking, institutional and
retail clients. After the settlement, the firm's $2 billion of
capital will remain among the largest in the securities industry and
will be more than adequate to finance its future growth,'' the
statement said.
   The invitations extended by Drexel were disclosed as the firm
continued to negotiate with the government over final details of its
securities fraud plea bargain settlement.
   Under that accord, Drexel must pay a record $650 million in fines
and restitution, plead guilty to six unspecified felonies, settle
related civil litigation with the SEC and agree to cooperate in the
government's expanding campaign against Wall Street corruption.
   Shad is credited with toughening the agency's enforcement efforts
to reduce insider trading and other abuses on Wall Street, and is a
leading proponent of strengthening business ethics in general.
   Independently wealthy, with an extensive background on Wall
Street, Shad resigned the SEC post in 1987 after a six-year tenure
to accept the ambassador position.
   If Shad were to accept a Drexel job, he would replace Robert
Linton, who has long been expected to retire.
   It would mark an ironic twist not only in the legal ordeal of the
investment firm but also for Drexel's chief executive officer,
Frederick Joseph, who was once hired by Shad 20 years ago when Shad
ran the now-defunct investment firm E.F. Hutton &amp; Co.
   Word that Shad and Hills had been approached came a day after
Drexel said it and former Sen. Howard Baker had agreed to end talks
about a possible role for him in the firm's senior management.
   Baker, a prominent Republican lawyer, former Tennessee senator
and one-time White House chief of staff under President Reagan, had
been negotiating with Drexel since November about assuming a senior
position.
   There was no explanation for why talks ended. But people familiar
with the talks said there was disagreement over how much management
control would be exercised by Baker, who has no background in Wall
Street investment banking.

<HEAD>Trade Group Announces Plans For Advanced Television</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixteen U.S. electronics companies have agreed to
study the feasibility of creating a corporate partnership that would
develop the next generation of televisions, a trade group says.
   The partnership would be a potentially profit-making organization
that would work with the federal government on research leading to
the manufacture of high-definition TV sets, the American Electronics
Association said Thursday.
   The partnership might even do its own manufacturing of
components, such as picture tubes, spokesman John Hatch said.
   The trade group argues that the United States cannot afford to be
left behind by the Japanese in the next generation of bright, sharp
televisions, which will be packed with sophisticated electronics.
   ``Given the unlikelihood of an individual U.S. company risking
entering this evolving new market, the action is a logical and
practical next step for the industry,'' Pat Hill Hubbard, the
group's vice president for science and technology policy, said in a
statement.
   Some analysts have expressed skepticism about the potential for
success of such a partnership, and some of the companies that agreed
to do the feasibility study said they were not necessarily committed
to participating in a partnership.
   John Taylor, a spokesman for Zenith Electronics Corp., the last
major U.S. television manufacturer, said, ``In terms of overall
support, we rate this as third or fourth in importance.''
   Acknowledging the obstacles, Ms. Hubbard said in an interview,
``There's not been a soul who's encouraged me personally or AEA in
general on doing this. There's been nothing but nay-sayers.''
   Asked if she was optimistic about the chances for a partnership,
she said, ``Optimistic is too elevated a word. This is a logical
next step.''
   Companies funding development of a business plan for the proposed
venture are Hewlett-Packard Co., Varian Associates, Cohu Inc.,
Digital Equipment Corp., ITT Corp., Prometrix Corp., PCO Inc.,
Zenith, International Business Machines Corp., Apple Computer Inc.,
Tektronix Inc., Raychem Corp., Motorola Inc., Texas Instruments
Inc., Harris Corp. and AVX Corp.
   Also participating is MCC, the Austin, Texas-based research
consortium formerly known as Microelectronics and Computer
Technology Corp.

<HEAD>New England's Biggest Utility Offers $2 Billion for PSNH</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WENDY MITMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public Service Co. of New Hampshire,
forced into bankruptcy court by debts from the stalled Seabrook
nuclear power plant, is pondering a bid from Northeast Utilities
that values the struggling PSNH at nearly $2 billion.
   PSNH's initial reaction Thursday to the bid from New England's
largest power company was positive.
   ``We are glad to see that Northeast Utilities, a serious,
qualified bidder, has valued PSNH Company of New Hampshire at a
level it describes as in excess of $2 billion,'' PSNH President John
Duffett said in a statement.
   Duffett said the PSNH board would consider the offer, which must
also be approved by federal and state regulators and PSNH's
creditors.
   Under the Northeast Utilities proposal, PSNH's 36 percent share
of Seabrook would be spun off into a separate company to be owned by
PSNH's unsecured creditors.
   Northeast Utilities pledged to buy Seabrook power through a
subsidiary which would be a New Hampshire-based utility owning
PSNH's assets other than Seabrook, Northeast Utilities officials
said.
   Northeast Utilities said it would pay $1.2 billion for the
non-Seabrook assets. The company valued the pledge to buy Seabrook
power at $750 million, making the total deal worth nearly $2 billion.
   PSNH has said about 10 companies have expressed interest in
acquiring all or part of the utility, including New England Electric
System; a pairing of Central Maine Power Co. and Central Vermont
PSNH Co.; and New Hampshire Electric Cooperative.
   A New England Electric spokeswoman said officials would not
comment on the Northeast Utilities proposal before reviewing it in
detail. Comment was not immediately obtained from any other possible
bidders.
   Seabrook, a $5.8 billion, 1,150-megawatt plant finished in 1986,
remains idle for lack of a federal operating license. PSNH went into
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code last
year after state courts refused to allow the utility to pass on the
costs of Seabrook to ratepayers.
   PSNH is the biggest stakeholder in Seabrook; Northeast Utilities
owns 4 percent of the plant.
   PSNH, its creditors and the state are negotiating a financial
restructuring of the utility, but the talks have been punctuated by
harsh rhetoric and charges of bad faith.
   In his statement Thursday, Duffet criticized state officials for
failing to recognize a value anywhere near the range proposed by
Northeast Utilities.
   Northeast Utilities officials said their proposed buyout would
provide PSNH with an opportunity to speedily resolve virtually all
outstanding issues in the reorganization.
   Northeast Utilities President William Ellis said the state and
PSNH are ``now far apart on reaching a settlement,'' with the
utility wanting more money to settle up with creditors and the state
refusing to agree to the high rates being proposed by creditors.
   ``We firmly believe we can be the catalyst ... to bring
ratepayers and creditors together,'' Ellis said.
   Ellis urged PSNH to incorporate the proposal into its own
bankruptcy reorganization plan. If PSNH declines, Northeast
Utilities will press its case with PSNH's creditors and New
Hampshire officials, Ellis said.
   Northeast Utilities, based in Hartford, Conn., serves more than 1
million customers in Connecticut and 185,000 customers in
Massachusetts through subsidiaries, the Connecticut Light and Power
Co. and Western Massachusetts Electric Co.
   The company's electricity sales in the past year were more than
$2 billion, compared with PSNH's sales of under $600 million.
   The Northeast Utilities offer provides more money than had been
previously available for stockholders and creditors, and protects
PSNH's ratepayers from huge increases.
   Under the proposal, first-mortgage and general and refunding
mortgage bondholders _ who have been receiving interest since PSNH
filed for bankruptcy _ would recover their full principal, about
$440 million, Ellis said.
   Third-mortgage bondholders would receive all of their principal _
just over $400 million _ but substantially less than the total
interest that has accrued.
   Steven Davis, president of Consolidated Utilities and
Communications Inc., a substantial third-mortgage bondholders group,
said Thursday it was too early to comment on the proposal. However,
he said his group's position has been ``that as secured creditors
you deserve 100 percent of capital and accrued interest.''
   The unsecured creditors who would hold the Seabrook assets would
receive about $70 million in cash from Northeast Utilities and $75
million in preferred stock from the Northeast Utilities subsidiary.
Northeast Utilities would also pay them $165 million to pay for
Seabrook until it wins an operating license.

<HEAD>Federal Official Traces S&amp;L Crisis to ``New Breed'' of Owners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES O. CLIFFORD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal official investigating more than
$220 million in losses from alleged fraud at savings and loans says
much of the crisis in the nation's thrifts can be traced to a ``new
breed of owner.''
   ``Often they were real estate developers'' who took over a small
thrift, a move that ``provided them with a ready source of cash to
fund their projects,'' James Cirona, president of the Federal Home
Loan Bank of San Francisco, said in testimony to be given today to a
congressional committee.
   Cirona was appearing for a second day before members of the House
Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee at a hearing into the
troubled thrift industry, which saw a post-Depression record 217
insolvent institutions last year.
   On Thursday, Cirona, whose district includes California, Nevada
and Arizona, delivered a half-inch thick statement that said since
August of 1987 his investigators had referred 5,384 cases of
possible fraud or abuse to the U.S. attorney's office.
   Many of the cases ``involve rather small amounts obtained
fraudulently by borrowers or depositors,'' he said.
   ``However, we are particularly concerned by abuse by insiders
which may often involve very large sums of money. For this reason we
have established a special system of `priority referrals' that
involves insiders or amounts in excess of $100,000.
   ``We estimate that losses ... on these priority referrals, as of
Sept. 23, 1988, amounted to over $220 million.''
   The new breed of savings and loan owner, who entered the field
following deregulation in 1982, could find an ``auditor that would
allow a thrift to guarantee a profit by investing in acquisition,
developments and construction loans,'' Cirona said in today's
prepared testimony.
   Others testifying on Thursday included Herbert Sandler, chairman
and chief executive officer of World Savings and Loan Association, a
successful Oakland thrift that Sandler said deals only in
residential loans.
   He said the savings and loan crisis was ``the greatest financial
scandal in history in which in excess of $100 billion has been
wasted and lost.''
   The problems could have been avoided if the ``fundamentals of the
thrift industry'' _ dealing only in residential loans _ had been
followed, he said.
   Sandler called efforts at deregulation of the industry bungled
and that regulators had been repeatedly warned.
   ``I could tell you stories that would make your hair curl,'' he
said, bringing laughter from the nearly-packed hearing room and from
committee chairman Henry Gonzalez, who ran his hand over his bald
pate.
   Gonzalez, D-Texas, earlier told his own horror stories of failed
thrifts, recalling a couple who lost $50,000 saved for their
children's education.
   ``It would tear your heart out'' to hear such stories, said
Gonzalez.
   Gonzalez called for a full analysis of the crisis in the savings
and loans institutions where government bailouts exceeded $38
billion in 1988 alone.
   The hearing was needed to ``clean up the mess that is already out
there,'' he said, adding that more hearings would be held in other
cities.

<HEAD>Plans to End Merger Pact, Sell Oster-Sunbeam to Black &amp; Decker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allegheny International Inc. has asked a
federal bankruptcy judge for permission to sell its keystone
Oster-Sunbeam division to Black &amp; Decker Corp. as part of a plan
management will devise to reorganize the troubled consumer products
company.
   Creditors, however, asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Joseph Cosetti
Thursday for permission to file their own plan to reorganize
Allegheny International, which has been operating under Chapter 11
of the federal bankruptcy code for nearly a year.
   At a hearing before Cosetti, unsecured creditors lashed out at
management for the rejection Wednesday of a merger agreement with
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
   ``This debtor is inept. It has no credibility,'' said Robert
Sable, representing Allegheny International's unsecured creditors.
   Lawyers representing unsecured creditors literally stood in line
to tell Cosetti they had no faith in the Allegheny International
board's ability to find an acceptable reorganization plan.
   Allegheny International asked Cosetti to allow the firm to sell
Oster-Sunbeam, a maker of irons, shavers and other small appliances,
to Black &amp; Decker for $260 million.
   In conjunction with that proposal, management said it has entered
an agreement under which its recent adversary, Spear, Leeds &amp;
Kellog, would help finance the management reorganization plan. The
New York firm had been battling the board as head of a shareholders'
committee.
   The board rejected the Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette deal because
the securities firm struck a private bargain with a rival bidder,
the Paul S. Levy banker group, to carve up the company between them.
   Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette planned to sell the lawn furniture
and gas grill business to Levy for $250 million and keep the rest of
the company, including the Oster-Sunbeam division.
   The board also objected to Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette altering
its takeover proposal by lowering its common equity contribution to
the reorganized company by $30 million.
   Allegheny International said it would ask the bankruptcy court
for sanctions against Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette and the Levy
group.
   The board announced a tentative merger agreement with Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette last November after the major creditor groups
scuttled an earlier management reorganization plan and forced the
board to offer the company for sale.
   Cosetti deferred ruling on any of the requests. He had set
Thursday as a deadline for management to choose among the bidders'
reorganization plans.
   Management's sole right to submit a plan expires today.
   It was not immediately clear what anti-trust considerations might
be raised by the merger of the Sunbeam-Oster division and Black &amp;
Decker.
   Allegheny International would use the proceeds of the
Oster-Sunbeam sale to reduce debt and emerge with a company with
about $500 million in annual sales from its remaining businesses,
which include gas grills, lawn furniture, weather instruments,
electric blankets and scales.
   Black &amp; Decker, based in Towson, Md., manufactures and sells
power tools, accessories, household appliances and lawn care
equipment.

<HEAD>Technology's Effect On Economy Felt In Poorer Countries: Greenspan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan says
the technological advances that have spurred changes in the world
economy this decade are starting to be felt in poorer nations.
   Some heavily indebted nations _ for example, Mexico, Argentina
and Brazil _ are beginning to show signs of economic vitality,
Greenspan said late Thursday in a speech at the Federal Reserve Bank
of Atlanta.
   ``We obviously still have very significant problems with the
debtor nations and their economic structure.''
   But Greenspan said the nations are going through profound changes
that make him optimistic that economic improvement may be
forthcoming.
   Greenspan said that technological advances, which have
``downsized'' the goods produced by industrial nations and vastly
improved communications, have put pressure on governments to open up
their societies and economies.
   He said that ``perestroika,'' the name for Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev's economic reform program, is a worldwide
phenomenon and is evidence that centrally controlled economies as
part of oppressive government leadership are becoming a thing of the
past.
   ``If we could resolve the debt problem, which we're beginning to
get some handle on, then I think we're going to find a really major
renewal of economic capabilities in a number of these countries
which have been under such terribly difficult pressure in recent
years,'' he said.

<HEAD>Government Plans To Expand Imports To Hold Down Trade Surplus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The South Korean government has
promised to expand its imports whenever the country's current
account trade surplus exceeds quarterly targerts.
   Government officials said the United States was mostly likely to
benefit from the plan, which was contained in an annual economic
report presented to President Roh Tae-woo Thursday.
   Korea's trade surplus with the United States was estimated at
around $9 billion last year, down from nearly $10 billion in 1987.
The United States is Korea's biggest market, taking about 35 percent
of Korean exports which totaled $60.6 billion last year.
   The government said it will set up special task forces to remove
various non-tariff barriers and prepare a schedule for opening the
market for farm products.

<HEAD>Six Board Of Trade Members Get Fines, Suspensions In Wig Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six traders have been suspended from conducting
transactions at the Chicago Board of Trade and fined thousands of
dollars each for engaging in fraudulent practices.
   CBOT disciplinary authorities found all six had engaged in a
scheme involving a trader who wore a wig and fake identification to
conduct transactions, CBOT officials announced Thursday.
   The traders were linked through federal court testimony last
summer to the wig scheme masterminded by veteran trader Thompson B.
Sanders, who was sentenced in November to six years in prison.
   The disciplinary action, imposed Dec. 16 but announced this week,
followed revelations by prosecutors in the Sanders probe.
   The suspensions ranged from 15 days to 10 years and fines were
between $5,000 and $50,000 each.
   Investigators found all six engaged in ``fraud and dishonorable
and dishonest conduct'' and ``reckless and unbusinesslike dealings
inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade.''
   Sanders, 45, was found guilty of setting up the scheme in which
Daniel Dewey, another former trader, donned a wig and used stolen
trader badges and jackets to gain access to a restricted area near
the Treasury Bond trading pit.
   The government claimed that because of the disguises, Sanders,
Dewey and others in the scheme were able to claim $30,000 in trading
profits without detection. Dewey was sentenced to five years in
prison.
   The six suspended traders were identified as David Schremser, Dan
Hayes, Patrick Bratta, Scott Bremner, Patrick Sutor and Robert
Kinkade. Schremser and Hayes testified under grants of immunity from
prosecutors at Sanders' trial, the CBOT said.
   The CBOT board of governors levied the stiffest penalty against
Bremner, who was suspended for 10 years, fined $50,000 and barred
from associating with other members of the exchange during the
suspension.

<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community has
given a cool response to a proposal made by a group of U.S.
congressmen to set up a bilateral panel to arbitrate trade disputes
between the United States and the EEC.
   A spokesman for EEC's External Relations Commissioner Frans
Andriessen, said Friday that the EEC was ``reluctant'' about the
plan.
   The EEC was more interested in strengthening the procedures of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the Geneva-based
international trade body which normally arbitrates in trade
disputes, he said.
   The spokesman, who asked not to be named, said the U.S.
congressmen had discussed the issue with Andriessen on Thursday in
Brussels. He said that the congressmen suggested the panel could
arbitrate in what they called ``relatively minor'' disputes such as
the current quarrel about the EEC's ban on hormones in beef.
   In retaliation for the ban, the United States imposed 100 percent
tariffs affecting $100 million worth of trade in EEC goods. The EEC
will decide whether to take countermeasures at a meeting of its
foreign ministers at the end of January.

   The stock market was mixed today, faced with news
of a smaller-than-expected rise in retail sales last month.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped .53 to 2,221.79
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 569 up, 344 down and
518 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.60 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Commerce Department reported that retail sales increased 0.2
percent in December, a gain much smaller than most analysts had
estimated. Stock traders seemed uncertain at first how to respond to
the news.
   In the bond market, investors reacted positively, sending
interest rates lower on the report's suggestion that economic
activity was a bit less robust than had been thought.
   But the dollar declined in foreign exchange after the figures
were made public.
   Brokers said blue-chip stocks also were faced with some selling
to cash in on the gains that have recently carried the market to its
highest levels since the October 1987 crash.
   Among actively traded blue chips, USX was up ] at 31]; General
Electric held steady at 45, and International Business Machines
dropped \ to 122~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.23 to 159.49. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .20 at 315.20.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 15.89 points
to 2,222.32 _ less than 25 points shy of its close of 2,246.74 on
Oct. 16, 1987, just before it took a 508-point drop on Black Monday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 3 to 2 on the
NYSE, with 899 up, 569 down and 509 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 183 million shares, up from 148.95
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Year's First Stock Market Barometer Signals Fair Weather</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first ``barometer'' of 1989 has already
flashed a positive signal for the stock market.
   In the first five sessions of the year, the Dow Jones average of
30 industrials posted a net gain of 30.89 points.
   That marks the 24th time in the past 40 years that the market
gained ground in the first trading week, according to Yale Hirsch,
an Old Tappan, N.J. investment advisor.
   On only two of those occasions, in 1966 and 1973, did the market
fail to finish the year in the plus column.
   Hirsch describes the first-week performance as an ``early
warning'' system for his popular January barometer, which is based
on the premise that ``as January goes, so goes the year'' in the
market.
   In his annual Stock Trader's Almanac, Hirsch says the direction
stock prices take in January has foreshadowed the full year's
outcome correctly all but three times since 1950.
   This time of year is a peak period for the various indicators
people have adopted to try to solve the perpetual riddle of the
market outlook.
   When the Super Bowl is played in Miami on Jan. 22, many Wall
Streeters will be rooting, at least tongue-in-cheek, for the San
Francisco 49ers to beat the Cincinnati Bengals.
   That's because the 49ers trace their origins to the National
Football League before its merger with the former American Football
League.
   In the 22 years that the Super Bowl has been played, a victory by
a team from the original NFL has always been followed by an up year
for stock prices.
   Sober, right-thinking Wall Streeters try not to take the Super
Bowl indicator too seriously. It simply isn't fitting for people
with fiduciary responsibilities to be associating themselves with
anything so patently frivolous.
   Still, the Super Bowl indicator gets a lot of attention, if only
as an entertaining diversion from the rigors of a demanding business.
   Hirsch argues that there is considerably more logic to the
January barometer.
   ``Several events have been squeezed into January which affect our
economy and our stock markets, and quite possibly those of many
nations of the world,'' he observes.
   Congress convenes, the president presents his budget and his
State of the Union message, and ``national goals and priorities''
are set.
   ``Switch these events to any other month and chances are the
January barometer would become a memory,'' he concludes.
   That case fails to sway some skeptics, however, who question the
utility if not the validity of the January barometer.
   In 1987, for example, the market rose 13.2 percent in January.
Thanks to the crash that fall, stocks finished the year with a gain
of just 2 percent.
   So while the barometer's performance that year was technically a
correct call, prices actually were lower at yearend than they had
been 11 months earlier.
   If you had tried to act on the January barometer as soon as its
signal was known, in other words, chances are you would have lost
money.
   Even worse yet, from the viewpoint of many professional money
managers, the January barometer failed to alert investors in 1982 to
the impending start of a mighty bull market.
   Stocks fell 1.8 percent in January of that year. With an upsurge
that started in August, they closed out the year with a net gain of
14.8 percent.

<TEXT>
   Japan's dominant phone company, under pressure from
the government, said Friday it would disclose market information
that would help its new long-distance competitors plan their
strategies.
   Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. said it would reveal facts
such as the number of calls made between administrative districts
and the revenue from each district, as well as the number of phone
subscribers in each city.
   The utility, long owned by the government, was privatized in
1985, and its telecommunications monopoly ended at the same time,
but it held key traffic information as a corporate secret despite
pressure from competitors and the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications.
   ``The competition is getting quite severe for us in many
different aspects, but we decided to disclose some of information we
have to accommodate the needs of new common cariers,'' NTT President
Haruo Yamaguchi said at a news conference.
   NTT is the world's largest company in terms of its stock market
valuation.
   The company has been disclosing the total number of subscribers
nationwide, and the total number of calls made annually, but it
withheld other details.
   Three companies, Teleway Japan, DDI and Japan Telecom, have
started long-distance telephone services since 1986 in the 320-mile
corridor between Japan's two biggest cities, Tokyo and Osaka.
   NTT is reportedly losing its long-distance share to the three new
common carriers. The Tokyo-Osaka corridor covers more than 70
percent of Japan's 120 million population, and the new companies are
offering long-distance rates about 20 percent lower than NTT.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today predicted that unemployment
would rise from 2 percent to 3 percent as a result of an austerity
plan designed to cut the economy's growth rate and reduce inflation.
   The announcement, the first of its kind, came as the government
is struggling to cool an overheated economy that has boosted prices
to record-high levels. People ran on banks last summer to take out
their money and buy as much as possible before prices went higher
still.
   ``The austerity measures will leave many people jobless,'' said
Yuan Wu, spokeman for the State Council, or cabinet. ``The most
seriously affected will be those in the construction industry,
because it is those projects that we want to stop.''
   He said the government hopes to cut inflation by 3 percent to 5
percent next year. He said anything lower would stifle economic
developement.
   Yuan said China has an 18.5 percent rate of inflation, but some
Chinese economists privately put it at about 40 percent.
   In a news conference summing up last year's economy, Yuan said
China's gross national product in 1988 grew by 11.2 percent over
1987 to $368 billion.
   Industrial output led the surge, jumping by 17.7 percent.
However, agriculture increased a disappointing 3 percent.
   Yuan said China hopes to cut its gross national product to a 7.5
percent rate of growth this year. Under the plan, industrial
production will fall to 8 percent growth and farm output will rise 4
percent.
   He said unemployment in China was 2 percent and expected to rise
50 percent to 3 percent this year because of the government's
austerity program.
   Estimates by independent economists put the jobless figure much
higher.
   The government imposed the austerity program in September to put
the brakes on the price spiral that has eroded the standard of
living for up to a fifth of city dwellers.
   A reform program designed to allow prices to float on the market
was cut back severely.
   Under the austerity program, more than 10,000 projects have also
been stopped, reducing investment by $9 billion, Yuan said.
   He said the government would move to cushion unemployment by
guaranteeing the jobless a certain standard of living. He did not
give details.
   Although most areas of the economy will be cut, the state will
put more money into agriculture, Yuan said.
   China will increase its farm investment by $100 million, Yuan
said.
   He said the austerity program has already slowed the growth of
prices. In December, prices went up 26 percent over the same month
the previous year. But, Yuan said the rate of increase was 0.8
percent less than in November.
   Bank deposits, another signal of economic activity, are again on
the increase, he said.
   One of the reasons for the increase, however, is that many banks
have frozen the assets of individually- and collectively-owned
businesses.
   Yuan also said a crackdown on corruption has returned $2.1
billion in embezzled funds to the state.
   More than 150 high-ranking officials from national companies have
resigned and more than 30 big companies closed because of corruption
inquiries, he said.

   The landmark 1986 overhaul of the federal
income tax, which was widely advertised as having no effect on the
budget deficit, actually will worsen the red ink by almost $91
billion over a five-year period, the Reagan administration now
estimates.
   The 1990 budget that President Reagan sent to Congress on Monday
projects the new tax law will add $24.4 billion to the deficit this
fiscal year and $20.3 billion in the year that begins Oct. 1. It
resulted in an $8.9 billion loss in 1988.
   A Congressional Budget Office specialist this week disputed the
Treasury calculations. CBO's figures, which are expected in a few
days, will show a far smaller revenue loss over five years. The
official said CBO's estimates are supported by the Joint Committee
on Taxation, which advises Congress on tax matters.
   ``In 1992 and 1993, we believe the new law will increase
collections by between $5 billion and $10 billion a year,'' said the
CBO official, who would not be quoted by name.
   ``Looking even further into the future, it's going to be
revenue-neutral,'' meaning it will produce the same revenue that the
old law would have in those years, the CBO source said.
   The Treasury Department offered no official explanation of why
its new estimates differ so widely from earlier calculations.
   However, one Treasury aide suggested the problem is that the new
estimates have no way of accounting for higher incomes that many
economists think resulted from the lower tax rates under the new law.
   This explanation is based on the concept that underlies Reagan's
economic policies: that cutting tax rates induces people to work
hard, earn more and save more. Those higher incomes, in turn, would
produce more revenue for the government.
   During the nearly two years it took Congress to write the law,
leaders of the House, Senate and administration always agreed on one
point: no matter what went into the new tax package, the total
result should neither raise nor lower total government tax
collections.
   On several occasions, lawmakers had to amend their work because
revenue experts indicated it would have lost money,
   Shortly after the law was enacted, Congress and the Treasury
Department estimated that in the five budget years from 1987 through
1991, it would produce $300 million less in total revenue than the
old law would have _ a figure low enough to be considered
revenue-neutral.
   But a year ago, Reagan's budget indicated that loss would be
$23.2 billion.
   The new budget more than doubles the loss or the same five years
to $48.5 billion. It projects a $90.9 billion loss for the five
years from 1988 through 1992.
   When Reagan signed the new law, Congress and the administration
agreed the measure would increase tax collections by $11.5 billion
in 1987, chiefly because owners of stocks and other investments
would be induced to sell some assets in the closing days of 1986 to
avoid a higher tax on capital gains that began in 1987.
   In fact, the Treasury Department says, 1987 collections rose by
$21.5 billion.
   Congress and the Treasury Department often have found it is next
to impossible to project how changes in tax laws will affect
taxpayer behavior _ and thus revenue collections _ more than a year
or two into the future.
   The problem with the 1986 law is even greater, because it
included the most changes since the income tax was enacted in 1913.
   In addition to cutting tax rates significantly for individuals
and corporations, the law reduced or repealed several deductions and
credits and aimed to shift $120 billion of the tax burden from
individuals to businesses over five years.
   The CBO official said whatever shortage in revenue results from
the new law will have been caused by overestimating taxes to be
gained by reducing individual deductions, rather than from the rate
reduction.

   The stock market turned downward today, faced
with news of a smaller-than-expected rise in retail sales last month.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had climbed 15.89
points Thursday, slipped 5.71 to 2,216.61 by 11 a.m. today.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 519 up, 617 down and
563 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 45.41 million shares at
midmorning.
   The Commerce Department reported that retail sales increased 0.2
percent in December, a gain much smaller than most analysts had
estimated. Stock traders seemed uncertain at first how to respond to
the news.
   In the bond market, investors reacted positively, sending
interest rates lower on the report's suggestion that economic
activity was a bit less robust than had been thought.
   But the dollar declined in foreign exchange after the figures
were made public.
   Brokers said blue-chip stocks also were faced with some selling
to cash in on the gains that have recently carried the market to its
highest levels since the October 1987 crash.
   Among actively traded blue chips, USX was up ] at 31], but
General Electric dropped [ to 44~, and International Business
Machines fell { to 122|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.21 to 159.05. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .19 at 314.81.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Open Higher On Soviet Wheat Talk, Argentine Dryness</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices opened mostly
higher today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid reports of a Soviet
bid for U.S. wheat and drought damage to Argentina's soybean crop.
   The Soviet Union was said to be bidding for more of the wheat it
has been offered at prices subsidized by the U.S. government,
analysts said.
   An Argentine government report showing the first signs of damage
to that country's soybean crop gave the soybean market a boost,
analysts said.
   ``Argentina is extremely hot and dry,'' said Jon Horton, a
grain-market analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Trading activity was fairly subdued with many traders taking to
the sidelines ahead of this afternoon's Agriculture Department crop
report.
   The report, scheduled for release after the close of trading,
will contain final 1988 crop production figures, a hotly anticipated
tally of winter wheat plantings, new estimates of the U.S. grain
stockpiles and predictions for 1989 soybean and corn plantings.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent to 2{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.43 a bushel; corn was } cent to
1\ cents higher with March at $2.87\ a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to

to 3{ cents higher with January at $8.01 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .15 cent to .23 cent higher with February at
74.25 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .08 cent
higher with January at 85 cents a pound; live hogs were .17 cent
lower to .13 cent higher with February at 45.60 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .20 cent to .35 cent higher with February
at 43.05 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures closed higher on Thursday while pork futures were
mixed.

   Wholesale prices, boosted by a 0.4 percent
increase in December, rose 4 percent for all of 1988, the fastest
pace since the nation began emerging from double-digit inflation
near the beginning of the decade, the government said today.
   The gain in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index for
finished goods, one stop short of the retail level, was nearly
double last year's 2.2 percent increase. It was the biggest gain
since 1981, when costs jumped 7.1 percent.
   The index was propelled upward by a drought-induced 5.7 percent
increase in food prices. They had showed no change in 1987.
   Meanwhile, energy prices, which had soared 11.2 percent in 1987,
fell 3.4 percent in 1988. However, with the production agreement
reached by the OPEC nations in November, analysts expect oil prices
to head higher this year.
   All other finished goods in 1988 rose 4.3 percent.
   In December, food prices fell a slight seasonally adjusted 0.1
percent, energy costs edged up only 0.2 percent, but everything else
jumped 0.6 percent, the biggest increase since September.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said ``inflation
is running pretty much on the course its been on for several
months.''
   This is the third consecutive month of good news for grocery
shoppers. Prices were unchanged in November after a 0.1 percent
decline in October. However, that period of stability was preceded
by seven consecutive months of increases from early spring through
the summer.
   With the end of unseasonably moderate temperatures in many parts
of the country in December, fuel oil soared 8.5 percent and natural
gas rose 3.3 percent. Gasoline prices, however, fell 3.5 percent,
holding back overall energy gains.
   For other items, a sharp 5.7 percent increase in tobacco prices
and significant gains of 0.9 percent in automobile costs and 0.7
percent in women's clothing led the index.
   The fall in wholesale food costs was led by a 17.1 percent drop
in turkey prices. Fresh and dried vegetable prices fell 8.5 percent;
fresh fruit, 2.7 percent; fish, 1.3 percent, and pork, 0.3 percent.
There was a gain of 3.0 percent for beef, 2.5 percent for chicken,
and 1.0 percent for dairy products.
   The overall December increase left the Producer Price Index for
finished goods at 110.0, meaning that a hypothetical selection of
goods costing $100 in 1982 would have cost $110 last month, 30 cents
more than in November.
   The increase was close to, or slightly higher than, what most
economists expected in advance of the report. In November, the index
rose 0.3 percent. It was unchanged in October.
   President Reagan, in his economic report to Congress this week,
listed the taming of inflation as one of his proudest economic
achievements. However, 1988 marks the second consecutive year of
accelerating inflation. Wholesale prices actually fell 2.3 percent
in 1986.
   The administration is predicting a steady dampening of price
increases through 1994, but most private economists forsee another
modest acceleration this year. However, none expects a return to the
days of 1979 and 1980, when wholesale prices surged 13 percent and
12 percent.
   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co.,
anticipates no relief next year. He said tight labor markets and a
squeeze on factory capacity will continue. The unemployment rate in
December matched a 14-year low, while factories were straining in
November at the highest operating rates in nine years.

<TEXT>
   ``I'm expecting some further acceleration in prices particularly
because the economy is so strong,'' Jones said. ``I think we can say
at best we had a slight breathing spell (in October and November)
where we caught our breath after food prices were pushed up by the
drought.''
   Inflation at the consumer level, which also includes services and
has in recent years run at a higher rate than wholesale price
inflation, was 4.4 percent for the first 11 months of 1988, the same
as the annual rate in 1987.
   But, Jones said, it's only a matter of time before pressures
producing an acceleration in consumer prices rises. He predicted an
inflation rate of 5 percent to 6 percent this year.
   ``You can't flout the laws of economics. The remarkable thing is
we didn't had more acceleration last year,'' he said.
   The Labor Department is due to release its December index for
consumer prices on Jan. 19.

   Bond prices rose in early trading today, boosted
by a government report showing lower-than-expected December retail
sales and by a stronger dollar.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 13-16 point, or about
$8.12 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the
opposite direction from its price, fell to 8.89 percent from 8.97
percent late Thursday.
   Retail sales were up 0.2 percent in December, less than the
increase many analysts and economists had expected. The figure
indicated that inflationary pressures may not be as great as
believed; fear of inflation can lead to lower bond prices as
investors flee the fixed-income market.
   The dollar also was up today in foreign-exchange trading despite
reported sales of the U.S. currency by central banks, providing
further confidence for the bond market, analysts said.
   Another economic report released today, the December wholesale
price index, was in line with the figure many experts expected, up
0.4 percent.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues rose from [ point to 7-16 point, intermediate
maturities were up 9-16 point and long-term issues were up from }
point to 27-32 point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial
information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 4.63 to 1,136.30.
   In corporate trading, industrials were up. Moody's Investment
Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.57
to 295.81.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.50 percent as the
discount fell 5 basis points to 8.22 percent. Yields on six-month
bills fell to 8.82 percent as the discount fell 5 basis points to
8.34 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 9.00 percent as the
discount fell 5 basis points to 8.33 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 91-16 percent, unchanged from late Thursday.

<HEAD>Former Delta Air Lines Exec's Book Blasts Company</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delta Air Lines Inc.'s carefully nurtured image of
a family-style company where life is lovely and finances are fine is
a smoke screen hiding serious flaws, says a former company
executive's new book.
   ``I have written this book to say that the `emperor has no
clothes,' to expunge the illusion that Delta is OK,'' Sidney F.
Davis says in explaining the reasoning behind ``Delta Air Lines:
Debunking The Myth.''
   ``Fact is Delta is not OK. Fact is Delta no longer deserves the
reputation that it is financially impregnable and can endure and
prosper in the worst of times.
   ``Fact is Delta is in need of strong medicine if it is to survive
over the long term,'' writes Davis, a former vice president and
assistant general counsel, who quit in 1979 after 13 years at the
airline and now serves as general counsel for an airplane leasing
company in Atlanta.
   Industry analysts, however, see little to concern them at the
Atlanta-based carrier, which generally enjoys a strong reputation on
Wall Street and among the traveling public.
   ``No, I can't confess to be to worried about Delta,'' said Robert
Decker, an analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago, an opinion
echoed by Gail Scully at Argus Research in New York.
   The book ``offers nothing constructive,'' said Delta spokesman
Bill Berry, who gave it his own title: ``Sour Grapes by Sid Davis.''
   ``I can see nothing to the current criticisms,'' Berry said. ``I
find his book laughable. It is so out of tune with what the industry
is today and what Delta is and his opinions just are laughable. They
just don't fit today.''
   Davis said he left Delta in 1979 to become general counsel of
Springs Industries Inc. After nine years at the textile company, he
returned to Atlanta to establish a consulting business which was
bought by his current employer, Intercredit Corp.
   He says high salaries, lack of marketing expertise, a sub-par
computer reservations system and failure to deal with airline
deregulation have made Delta a company ``living on borrowed time.''
   ``We're stable; we're financially healthy; we're growing,'' Berry
said. ``We're not setting the world on fire, but we're doing it the
Delta way.
   ``The company has always been ultraconservative.''
   Davis offers a litany of problems at Delta: complaints that Chief
Executive Officer Ron Allen has no grasp of marketing and is ``the
wrong man at the wrong time;'' accusations that Delta's budget
process is non-existent; claims the airline has prospered by ``dumb
luck;'' and suggestions its hiring-from-within process has perverted
the company.
   He says the company has a ``siege mentality'' about criticism,
and has no planning process.
   Among Davis' solutions are for the company to more aggressively
hire non-Delta employees, totally restructure its marketing
department, get rid of its no-layoff policy and ``demonstrate
financial stewardship.''
   Davis doesn't expect his recommendations to be heard. ``The very
problems I name and the solutions I pose will by my naming and
proposing be immediately ruled out of any serious consideration of
how to resolve Delta's predicament,'' he writes.
   The book, which arrived in Atlanta stores last week, has been
greeted with a demand unusual for a business-oriented book,
according to sales people at some local bookstores.
   ``It's moving more quickly than even we imagined,'' said Cindy
Gelb, spokeswoman for Peachtree Publishers Ltd., which printed
15,000 of the books initially.
   Berry admits to keeping up with sales, but he says there has been
little response coming to the airline.
   Berry said just-released figures show ``Delta for the 15th
consecutive year got the lowest number of consumer complaints of the
major airlines. Our passengers like us; if nobody else, our
passengers like us.''
   Last week, Delta, the nation's third largest airline, reported an
11.3 percent increase in revenue passenger miles in 1988 and said
the actual number of passengers rose 7.1 percent to almost 60
million.

   The Big Three U.S. automakers got 1989 off on an
upbeat note, selling 3.7 percent more U.S.-built cars and light
trucks in early January than they did during the same period last
year, the companies said Friday.
   A 20.4 percent gain in light truck sales by General Motors Corp.,
Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. was diluted by a 5.5 percent
decrease in car sales overall, prompted by a 19.8 percent decline in
sales of GM cars.
   Ford and Chrysler showed increases of 13 percent and 11.4
percent, respectively, in car sales.
   The Big Three said they sold cars and light trucks at a daily
rate of 24,393 during the Jan. 1-10 period this year, compared with
a rate of 23,534 during the same time last year.
   There were seven selling days in both periods.
   GM, Ford and Chrysler said light trucks, including small pickups,
minivans and sport-utility vehicles, were bought at a daily rate of
10,021 in early January this year, compared with a daily rate of
8,324 during the same time last year.
   On the car side, the Big Three reported early January sales at a
rate of 14,372 in 1989, compared with 15,210 cars a day during the
same period of 1988.
   Automakers had ambitious production schedules through the
fourth-quarter of last year, indicating confidence in the early 1989
sales market. Incentives continued to be a factor and a new round of
incentives appears near.
   On Wednesday, the day after the early-January sales period ended,
Ford returned to cut-rate financing as an option to cash-back
financing. GM and Chrysler did not follow suit in the
low-interest-rate game by noon Friday.
   GM, the only member of the Big Three to show fewer car sales this
year than in the first reporting period of 1988, said it sold cars
at a daily rate of 6,801 during early January this year, compared
with an 8,481 daily rate during the same time last year.
   GM's truck sales rose 6.3 percent to a daily rate of 3,968 this
year, compared with a 3,732 rate last year.
   Chrysler's light truck sales showed a 46.9 percent increase in
early January, climbing to a daily rate of 2,347 in 1989 from 1,598
during the period last year. Chrysler-made cars sold at a rate of
2,225 a day in early January this year, up 11.4 percent from the
13,985 daily rate of a year before.
   Ford said it sold trucks at a daily rate of 3,706 in early
January, 23.8 percent more than the 2,993 early-January rate last
year. Car sales at Ford rose 13 percent, to a daily rate of 5,346 in
early January this year from a 4,731 during the period last year.

   Texaco Inc.'s newly formed Canadian subsidiary,
Texaco Canada Petroleum Inc., said Friday it has named a new
president and chief executive officer.
   The appointment of Phillip J. Cram, a native of Reading, England,
is effective immediately, the company said.
   Texaco Canada Petroleum was formed last September to continue
Texaco Canada Inc.'s interest in production and exploration in
Brazil, West Africa and Canada after that company is sold.
   The new company's assets in Brazil, Mauritania and 11
Canadian-producing properties have been valued at $92 million
(Canadian dollars). In addition, it has cash and marketable
securities worth an estimated $65 million.
   Texaco, based in White Plains, N.Y., announced last year that it
was selling its 78 percent interest in Toronto-based Texaco Canada
as part of a restructuring to raise some $5 billion after emerging
from bankruptcy last April.
   Shareholders in Texaco Canada will receive a special dividend of
one share of Texaco Canada Petroleum for each outstanding share of
Texaco Canada. The stock will begin trading on the Toronto Stock
Exchange in approximately six weeks, Texaco spokesman Hart S. Searle
said.
   Analysts speculated recently that final bids for Texaco Canada
were received on Monday and that the unit could fetch in the range
of $4 billion. The sale of Texaco Canada represents one of the final
steps in Texaco's massive restructuring plan.
   Cram, a research chemist and 15-year veteran of Texaco, has
served in various capacities in the United States, Canada and the
Middle and Far East. He will be based at Texaco Canada Petroleum's
headquarters in Calgary.

   The government greatly expanded its role in
protecting workers from hazardous materials Friday, setting exposure
limits for 164 substances for the first time and tightening limits
for 212 more in changes officials said could save 700 lives a year.
   ``This is a monumental job,'' Assistant Labor Secretary John A.
Pendergrass said in announcing the standards, which he said should
significantly reduce the risk of illness to 21 million Americans who
work in general industry and may be exposed to toxic or hazardous
materials.
   About 4.5 million workers now face exposures above the new
limits, the Labor Department said in completing a two-year project
that represents the first large-scale changes to exposure standards
in nearly two decades. Employers have until September to comply.
   ``We are literally taking a 20-year technological leap,'' said
Pendergrass, head of the department's Occupational Safety and Health
Administration. ``This is the biggest action OSHA has taken in its
history.''
   OSHA estimated that in addition to preventing about 700 deaths a
year, the tighter limits should prevent 55,000 illnesses and 500,000
lost workdays each year attributed to workplace exposure to
hazardous and toxic materials. Rough estimates provided by the
agency indicated the new standards could cut exposure-related deaths
by one-fifth, illnesses and lost workdays by one-fourth.
   The reductions in maximum exposure limits cover some of the most
commonly used industrial materials and byproducts, including
acetone, carbon monoxide, carbon disulfide, chloroform, hydrogen
cyanide, perchloroethylene and styrene.
   Substances regulated for the first time include wood dust and
grain dust, acrylic acid, butane, gasoline, paraffin wax fumes,
tungsten and welding fumes.
   Some substances are known or suspected carcinogens; others can
have narcotic-like effects on humans. Still others are blamed for
kidney, liver, heart and respiratory ailments while some are major
skin and eye irritants.
   The limits cover the maximum amount of a substance a worker can
be exposed to at any given time and during an eight-hour workday.
   OSHA said it needed to conduct further review before setting
lmits for exposure to asphalt, fibrous glass dust and mineral wool.
Those substances had been subject to new standards under the
agency's draft regulations, but conflicting data presented during
public hearings prompted OSHA to delay final decisions.
   The changes announced Friday could cost employers on average
$6,000 a year for each affected workplace, though that would vary
greatly, the government said. Costs could range from $77,400 a year
for petroleum refineries to $360 annually for auto dealers. The
average per-worker cost is $150.
   The department considered limits for more than 400 industrial
chemicals and substances in a single review, departing from a policy
of case-by-case study that had produced new, comprehensive standards
for just 24 substances in 17 years.
   After the review, the government decided to let stand existing
limits on 52 substances. The new limits on the others take effect
March 1 and employers must be in compliance by Sept. 1.
   Exposure limits will remain unchanged for 169 additional
substances not covered by the two-year review. Some of them are
currently being reviewed on an individual basis.
   The new standards apply only to general industry but will be
extended, following additional proceedings, to construction and
maritime industries as well.
   New limits were first suggested two years ago. A draft was
released last summer followed by 13 public hearings and a public
comment period during which more than 90 companies, trade
associations and labor unions testified and submitted documents for
OSHA to consider.
   The new federal guidelines will require 23 states and the
territories of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to check
OSHA-approved local standards they have adopted to make sure they
meet the new regulations.
   Those states are:
   Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky,
Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina,
Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia,
Washington and Wyoming. Affected to a lesser extent are Connecticut
and New York, which have state exposure standards for local
government employees.

<HEAD>Two General Electric Companies To Combine European Divisions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. PLC of Britain and U.S.-based
General Electric Co. said Friday they plan to merge their European
consumer products, medical equipment and some electrical divisions.
   The U.S.-based GE plans to pay British-based 325 million pounds,
or about $579 million, in cash as part of the merger of their
European operations, the companies said.
   The annual revenue of the combined European operations of the two
General Electrics would come to about $2.45 billion, said a
spokesman for the British GE, who declined to be identified by name
in accordance with British practice.
   The agreement is subject to shareholder approval and to clearance
from governmental and regulatory authorities.
   The combined European consumer products division is to be managed
by the British GE and will draw on the U.S.-based GE's technology.
The two companies, which are otherwise unrelated, will take equal
stakes in the venture.
   In medical equipment, the British GE will merge its Picker unit's
European operations with the U.S. company's GE Medical Systems
(Europe) and retain a 25 percent stake in the enlarged group.
   The British GE's Belgian-based electrical distribution unit
Vynckier NV is to merge on a 50-50 basis with the U.S.-based GE's
Italian unit, Compagnia Generale Elettromeccanica SPA.
   The companies said they have been negotiating the merger of the
European divisions over the past 12 months.
   As previously reported, the investment firm Lazard Brothers and
Co. disclosed last Saturday that it was holding negotiations with
several international companies which might lead to a bid for the
British GE, Britain's largest electronics manufacturer.
   Lazard is the merchant bank adviser to Plessey Co. PLC, another
British electronics firm for which the British GE and Siemens AG of
West Germany had launched a bid of 1.7 billion pounds, or about $3
billion.
   The British government, however, referred the British GE-Siemens
bid for Plessey to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on
Thursday, which blocks the takeover during a three-month inquiry
into its effects on competition.

<HEAD>Mexican Oil Prices Increase Average $2 a Barrel in December</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexican oil prices rose an average of more
than $2 a barrel in December in the wake of the new OPEC quota
agreement, the government oil monopoly Pemex said.
   The price of light Isthmus crude in the Americas was $13.93 a
barrel in December, an increase from $11.62 in November, Petroleos
Mexicanos said late Thursday.
   The heavy Maya grade sold for $10.52 a barrel, compared with
$9.21 a month earlier, and the extra-light Olmeca for $15.24, up
from $12.90.
   Customers in the Far East paid $12.95 a barrel for Isthmus and
$10.30 a barrel for Maya, increases from $10.82 and $8.22 a barrel
respectively.
   Prices for European buyers during the first half of the month
averaged $14.39 for Isthmus and $11.09 for Maya, up from $12.79 and
$9.71.
   Pemex said the increases were the result of ``the significant
recovery in prices of the principal crudes sold on the international
petroleum market'' following the agreement Nov. 28 by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   OPEC's 13 members agreed to lower their output by nearly 4
million barrels a day, to 18.5 million barrels in an effort to stem
the flow of excess oil and reverse the decline of world oil prices.
Mexico is not a member of OPEC.
   Since the accord, prices for U.S. crude, as well as Middle East
and other crudes, have risen more than $3 a barrel.
   Mexico's crude oil exports for 1988 averaged 1.3 million barrels
a day and petrochemicals, 40,000 barrels a day, Pemex said.
   In December, 51.6 percent of crude oil exports went to the United
States. Spain was the second largest buyer with 16 percent and 13
percent was sold to the Far East.

   Pop music star George Michael has begun work on a
video project that may result in a commercial for diet Coke,
Coca-Cola USA said.
   Soft drink companies in recent years have repeatedly turned to
entertainment figures to appear in their commercials which they hope
will catch the attention of viewers of all ages and help sell their
soda pop.
   Pepsi-Cola, for instance, has featured entertainers Michael
Jackson and Lionel Ritchie in commercials. Coca-Cola has employed
singers Whitney Houston, the Pointer Sisters and the Manhattan
Transfer in its advertising.
   The agreement disclosed Thursday calls for the singer and the
soft drink company to collaborate in both the development and
production of the project, Coke officials said Thursday.
   ``We're mutually developing some concepts which may or may not
lead us to the altar. We'll know more by the end of next week,''
said Michael A. Beindorff, vice president for advertising and
associate director of marketing for Coca-Cola USA.
   Michael, whose ``Faith'' album was one of 1988's biggest sellers,
filmed portions of the potential ad Thursday at Madison Square
Garden in New York with British filmmaker Stephen Frears.
   The first spot, if approved by both Michael and Coca-Cola USA, is
tentatively scheduled to be broadcast during the Super Bowl Jan. 22.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Close On High Note</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
higher Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade in subdued activity
ahead of the Agriculture Department's eagerly awaited first crop
report of the new year.
   Soybean futures posted the strongest gains on rumors the Soviet
Union was in the market for U.S. soybean meal. But overall, ``today
was really a dull day,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York.
   The crop report, which was released at 3 p.m. EST in Washington,
contained the government's final 1988 crop production figures, a
hotly anticipated tally of 1989 winter-wheat seedings, and estimates
of U.S. grain stockpiles.
   The winter-wheat seedings figure came in at 54.46 million acres,
well below the average pre-report estimate of 57.59 million acres
and 12 percent above the 1988 seeding figure.
   Analysts called the number bullish for the wheat futures market.
   The USDA said 1988 soybean production totaled 1.54 billion
bushels, 19.8 percent below the 1987 harvest but higher than most
pre-report estimates and higher than the USDA's Nov. 9 projection of
1.51 billion bushels. Analysts called the number bearish for soybean
futures.
   The USDA said 1988 corn production totaled 4.92 billion bushels,
30.3 percent below the 1987 harvest but higher than most pre-report
estimates and higher than the USDA's Nov. 9 projection of 4.67
billion bushels. Analysts termed the number bearish for corn futures.
   The USDA pegged soybean stocks as of Dec. 1 at 1.37 billion
bushels, corn stocks at 7.07 billion bushels and wheat stocks at
1.71 billion bushels.
   The USDA will project 1989 corn and soybean acreage on March 31.
   At the close of trading, wheat was 1\ cents lower to } cent
higher with the contract for delivery in March at $4.41 a bushel;
corn was 2{ cents to 3 cents higher with March at $2.88{ a bushel;

   Venezuelan President-elect Carlos
Andres Perez will talk with top officials of Iran and Iraq next week
as part of his self-appointed mission to forge political unity
within OPEC, Perez advisers said Friday.
   Perez is promoting a summit of OPEC heads of state to ease the
internal political tensions that have eroded the cartel's
effectiveness in controlling the world oil market.
   Although Perez is still in an unofficial capacity, his scheduled
visit next week to both Baghdad and Teheran is the first by a top
level representative of a non-Arab member of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries since Iran and Iraq agreed last year
to end their eight-year war.
   Perez' brief talks will follow a day of discussion in Zurich with
OPEC Secretary General Subroto, who was instrumental in getting Iran
to agree to allow Iraq to produce the same amount of oil as Iran in
the cartel's new output quota system. The accord, signed in
November, reduced OPEC's oil production by 4 million barrels to 18.5
million barrels a day starting Jan. 1 and extending for six months.
   ``He will be discussing petroleum, international cooperation,
South-South relations, and of course the (OPEC) summit,'' Perez
press spokesman Pastor Heydra said.
   Perez is scheduled to meet with Subroto on Sunday in Zurich
before leaving for Belgrade, Yugoslavia on a visit to promote
bilateral cooperation and trade.
   He will stop in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates before
moving on to Teheran next Tuesday and Bahrain and Baghdad on
Wednesday.
   Perez visited Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Algeria last December to
drum up support for the summit. Arab members of OPEC have been cool
to the idea.
   Indonesia has expressed support for a summit in 1990, the year of
OPEC's 30th anniversary. The cartel's 20th anniversary summit,
scheduled for 1980 in Baghdad, was cancelled because of the Gulf war.
   Perez is also promoting a summit of Latin American nations to
pressure for better conditions to repay the region's foreign debt of
over $400 billion.
   Perez' inauguration ceremony Feb. 2 will be attended by 21 heads
of state, including Fidel Castro. Unofficially, several OPEC
ministers, including Saudi Arabia's Hisham Nazer, may also attend,
Venezuelan officials said.
   The inauguration will be followed by an informal meeting among
the region's top debtors to discuss a Perez proposal for a ``common
framework'' for future debt negotiations.
   Among the biggest debtor nations _ Brazil, Mexico and Argentina _
only Mexico is not sending its president. Venezuela is the region's
fourth largest debtor.
   This week in New York Venezuela began talks with major creditors
to refinance most of its $33 billion foreign debt.

   Congressional analysts on Friday disputed the
Reagan administration's projection that the 1986 tax overhaul _
which was supposed to have no effect on the federal deficit _ will
actually worsen the red ink by nearly $91 billion over five years.
   Nevertheless, the Congressional Budget Office did acknowledge its
own forecasts show that rather than being ``revenue neutral'' the
sweeping law will lose $23.4 billion during the same five-year
period ending in 1992.
   Comparing other time periods shows a similar disagreement between
the administration's tax experts in the Treasury Department and
those of Congress, who work for the Congressional Budget Office and
the Joint Committee on Taxation.
   The argument means nothing as far as reducing the deficit is
concerned, since the revenue figures are already built into the
president's budget.
   However, the disagreement is likely to make government officials
and the public think twice the next time they hear anyone attempt to
estimate tax revenues far into the future.
   Meanwhile, Joseph Wright Jr., Reagan's budget director, said he
did not expect the size of the revenue losses to be anywhere near
the levels being estimated in the president's formal budget.
   ``This is a static analysis done by the Treasury Department that
does not take into account any other influences on the economy. It
needs to be taken with a grain of salt,'' Wright said.
   He said the analysis failed to take into account faster economic
growth that the administration contends is likely to occur in
response to the reduction in tax rates.
   Shortly after Congress passed the 1986 law, Treasury and the
Joint Committee on Taxation estimated it would be essentially
revenue neutral _ lose only $300 million _ from 1987 through 1991.
They forecast a sizable revenue increase in 1987, because taxpayers
would act to avoid a scheduled rise in the tax on capital gains;
losses in 1988 and 1989, and then increases into the future.
   At this time a year ago, Reagan proposed a budget that forecast a
$23-billion drop in collections during the same five years. The
budget that came out this week more than doubles that projected
decline, to $48.5 billion for the period, and increases it to $90.9
billion for the 1988-92 period.
   In contrast, CBO says that because of the big 1987 boost, the law
will increase collections by $4.6 billion in the 1987-1991 period,
though it will result in an overall loss for the 1988-92 period.
   The administration's latest forecast was included in the fiscal
1990 budget that President Reagan sent to Congress on Monday. During
that 12-month period beginning Oct. 1, revenue will be $20.3 billion
less than under the old law, Treasury says. CBO forecast a drop of
only $700 million.
   CBO expects the new law to produce more revenue each year than
the old law starting in 1991 while the Treasury Department estimates
continued declines, at least through 1993.
   It was a different story in 1985 and 1986 when Congress and the
administration were putting the new law together.
   Democrats wanted to ensure the overhauled law did not worsen the
treasury drain that they blmed principally on Reagan's 1981
across-the-board tax cut. Republicans were fighting any revenue
increase, on grounds more taxes would simply lead to more spending.
   The solution was to aim for a tax bill that was revenue neutral _
that left the government with essentially the same money that the
old law would have provided.
   But, as the new figures seem to indicate, there is simply no way
to forecast how taxpayers will react to changes in the tax law three
or more years in the future.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., then chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee and a prime author of the new law, recognized the
difficulty of such forecasts. On the day the Senate passed the final
version of the bill, Packwood declared:
   ``We have done everything we can to write it so that it will be
revenue neutral. But, very frankly, when you are talking about a
bill that goes over five years, and we're going to be collecting
roughly $4.7 trillion over that five years, you could hope it is
neutral. Nobody can be absolutely sure.''
   Forecasting tax revenues was made ever more difficult because the
1986 law included the most changes since the income tax was enacted
in 1913. In addition to cutting tax rates significantly for
individuals and corporations, the law reduced or repealed several
deductions and credits and aimed to shift $120 billion of the tax
burden from individuals to businesses over five years.

   A ``Friday the 13th'' virus struck personal
computers in Britain on Friday in what experts said may have been a
new manifestation of a computer virus that originated in Israel.
   Hundreds of personal computer users found the virus was
programmed to delete files on Friday the 13th, said Alan Solomon,
managing director of S and S Enterprises, a data recovery center in
Chesham.
   ``It has been frisky and hundreds of people, including a large
firm with over 400 computers, have telephoned with their problems,''
he said.
   Several U.S. computer-security experts said they had not received
any reports that the virus had cropped up inside the United States.
   The virus bore many of the characteristics of one that had been
programmed to go off on Friday, May 13, 1988, the day before the
40th anniversary of the establishment of the state of Israel. That
virus was first noticed at Hebrew University in Jerusalem and later
spread to Europe.
   Security experts said it was logical that a virus that was set to
go off on one Friday the 13th would also go off on subsequent Friday
the 13ths unless it was completely eradicated. This was the first
Friday the 13th since the one in May 1988.
   ``It is just a pesky nuisance and is causing a lot of problems
today,'' said Solomon, who also is chairman of an IBM personal
computer users group.
   The virus apparently attacked Microsoft Corp.'s MS-DOS, the
software that runs the internal operations of the original line of
International Business Machines Corp. personal computers and
compatible models.
   There were no estimates of how widespread the damage from the
virus was. The Israeli newspaper Maariv said that in one case the
original Israeli virus destroyed $15,000 worth of software and two
disks in which 7,000 hours of work had been invested.
   The Israel virus, for some reason, possibly an error by its
creator, began eating up space and slowing down computers before May
13, 1988. Solomon said the latest virus also ate up room in
computers and slowed them down before Friday.
   A spokesman for IBM in Portsmouth, who did not want to be
identified further, confirmed the virus had wiped out files in
personal computers made by IBM and compatible machines. The virus
apparently did not affect personal computers in offices of IBM
itself, however, said Colette Abissi, an IBM spokeswoman in
Purchase, N.Y.
   The identity of the hacker who devised the virus might never be
known, Solomon said.
   ``The important thing is not to panic and start trying to delete
everything in a bid to remove the virus as that can do untold
damage,'' he said.
   As long as master disks are free from the virus, files can simply
be copied from them and used again, he said.

<HEAD>Natwest Discontinues U.S. Primary Bond Dealership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Westminster Bank PLC said its U.S.-based
County Natwest Government Securities Inc. would abandon its primary
bond dealership after operating in the U.S. Treasuries market in New
York for just over three months.
   Natwest said some of the 100 people employed by the dealership
might be transferred within the company.
   The decision to withdraw resulted from an assessment of the costs
involved in the primary dealership, Natwest said.
   ``Continued expansion of the business would require the injection
of substantial additional capital, but analysis of the prospective
long-term return on capital has persuaded us that further investment
cannot be justified in the context of our overall strategy,''
Natwest said in a statement.
   County Natwest Government Securities was named one of 46 primary
dealers in U.S. government securities on Sept. 29, the last time new
primary dealers were added to the list by the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York.
   In December, the Fed recommended that Natwest inject $50 million
to $100 million into the dealership to meet capitalization
requirements.
   Primary dealers are government bond dealers that do business
directly with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. They are
required to make markets in all government issues and to participate
at all Treasury auctions.

   U.S.-made car and truck sales rose 5.6 percent
during early January this year compared with the same period last
year, despite a 19.8 percent decline in car sales at General Motors
Corp., automakers said Friday.
   The drop at GM may have been due to dealers moving some sales
from early January to late December to inflate year-end numbers,
analysts speculated. Strong truck sales helped bolster sagging
automobile sales industrywide.
   The seven U.S. automakers said they sold cars and light trucks on
a daily rate of 25,622 vehicles during the Jan. 1-10 period this
year. During the same period last year, they sold cars and trucks at
a daily rate of 24,252.
   There were seven selling days in both periods.
   GM was the only U.S. maker to show a decline during the period,
as its car sales skidded 19.8 percent, to a daily rate of 6,801 in
early January this year compared with a rate of 8,481 during the
same time last year.
   ``I think you're just seeing a payback from the end of
December,'' said analyst Charles Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. of New
York. ``A few of the dealers probably called a few of the Jan. 3-4
sales Dec. 31 sales (to boost year-end figures).''
   David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. of New York agreed,
saying: ``Their sales were unbelievably good in late December and
unbelievably bad in early January. If you add the two periods
together and divide by two, things are about normal.
   ``There was a lot of year-end window dressing in late December,''
Healy added.
   During the final 10-day period of December, GM reported a daily
sales rate of 14,657 cars a day, more than twice the early January
rate.
   Overall, U.S. automakers said they sold cars at a daily rate of
15,283 during the first 10 days of the year, a 3.1 percent decline
from a daily rate of 15,765 during the same time last year.
   Car sales for Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. rose during early
January, 13 percent and 11.4 percent, respectively.
   Light truck sales among all the makers rose 21.8 percent to a
daily rate of 10,339 during early January this year compared with a
rate of 8,488 last year.
   Chrysler's light truck sales showed a 46.9 percent increase in
early January, climbing to a daily rate of 2,347 in 1989 from 1,598
during the period last year. Chrysler-made cars sold at a rate of
2,225 a day in early January this year, up from 1,998 daily rate of
a year before.
   Ford said it sold trucks at a daily rate of 3,706 in early
January, 23.8 percent more than the 2,993 early-January rate last
year. Car sales at Ford rose to a daily rate of 5,346 in early
January this year from a rate of 4,731 during the period last year.
   While its car sales rate fell, GM's truck sales rose, going up
6.3 percent to a daily rate of 3,968 in early January of this year
from a 3,732 truck-per-day rate during the same time last year.

   The stock market chalked up another gain Friday
to set fresh new highs since the crash nearly 15 months ago.
   But the day's progress was small and tentative, coming on volume
that lagged far behind Thursday's pace.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.75 to 2,226.07,
finishing the week with a net gain of 31.78 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
836 up, 615 down and 540 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 132.32 million
shares, down from 183 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 158.11 million shares.
   The Commerce Department reported that retail sales increased 0.2
percent in December, a gain much smaller than most analysts had
estimated. Stock traders seemed uncertain at first how to respond to
the news.
   In the bond market, investors reacted positively, sending
interest rates lower on the report's suggestion that economic
activity was a bit less robust than had been thought.
   But the dollar declined in foreign exchange after the figures
were made public.
   Brokers said blue-chip stocks also were faced with some selling
to cash in on the gains that have recently carried the market to its
highest levels since the October 1987 crash.
   Among actively traded blue chips, USX gained \ to 31\; Merck rose
{ to 60]; General Motors added ] to 88; Ford Motor was unchanged at
52~, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was down [ at 29.
   Smithkline Beckman led the active list, up [ at 52\ on turnover
of more than 2.5 million shares. A Wall Street Journal article
discussed waning sales of Smithkline Beckman's ulcer drug Tagamet
and described the company as a takeover candidate.
   Abbott Laboratories rose ] to 47|. The company reported
fourth-quarter earnings of 99 cents a share, against 84 cents in the
like period a year earlier.
   Champion Spark Plug climbed ~ to 15. The company said it know of
no reason for the activity.
   Kay Jewelers posted one of the day's biggest percentage losses,
falling 2 to 13{. Kay said it would have a charge against its
fourth-quarter earnings as a result of the planned writeoff of a
significant number of receivables.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $5.22 billion, or 0.19
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
.33 to 159.59.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose .82 to 328.81, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up .70 at 283.87.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market edged
up .08 to 387.09. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 315.93, up .93.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises; Gold Falls</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar surged to three-month highs against
major currencies Friday as buyers shrugged off attempts by central
banks to restrain its rise.
   Most of the dollar's gains occurred after midday in New York,
when currency trading ceased in Europe and the European central
banks were no longer in the market selling dollars, traders said.
   There were reports of two rounds of intervention earlier in the
day by the central banks of the United States, West Germany, Canada,
Italy, Belgium, Switzerland, France, Britain and Austria.
   After the dollar had already achieved its gains for the day, the
Federal Reserve by itself reportedly sold some dollars late in the
U.S. trading session.
   Traders were unintimidated by the central banks because it
appeared the banks were merely trying to stall the dollar's rise,
not drive the dollar down, said Stephen Flanagan, senior yen dealer
at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   The U.S. government fears the dollar's rise because it could hurt
the competitiveness of American goods in world markets, worsening
the U.S. trade deficit. Japan, West Germany and others fear higher
inflation if their currencies become too weak.
   The dollar closed in New York at its highest levels since October
against the West German mark, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, French
franc and Italian lira and at its highest level since November
against the British pound.
   In spite of the seemingly sharp rise in the dollar, though,
currency rates remain far more stable than they were earlier in the
decade, said Craig Sloane, a currency analyst with Smith Barney,
Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   The dollar shot up until February 1985 and then immediately
collapsed, losing half its value against the yen and the mark in
little more than two years. Since then it has traded in a relatively
narrow range.
   The dollar's rise Friday came in spite of news that U.S. retail
sales increased by only 0.2 percent in December, while market
forecasts had been for an increase of 1.4 percent.
   Higher sales could have signaled a hike in interest rates which
would have made the dollar more attractive to investors. Instead,
yields on Treasury bonds fell sharply.
   Also, the Commerce Department is scheduled to report on the
November merchandise trade deficit on Wednesday, and traders are
usually reluctant to buy dollars heavily in advance of the report in
case a big deficit hurts the U.S. currency.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7770 late Friday, more than
one cent cheaper for buyers than Thursday's late $1.7880. In New
York, the pound weakened to $1.7660 from $1.7850.
   The dollar rose in Tokyo to close at 126.65 yen, up from 126.12
yen. Late Friday in London, the dollar traded at 126.35 yen. In New
York, the dollar rose to 127.30 yen from 126.38 yen late Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's
late rates, included: 1.8445 West German marks, up from 1.8268;
1.5740 Swiss francs, up from 1.5559; 1.1978 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1972; 6.2850 French francs, up from 6.2280; and 1,352.6
Italian lire, up from 1,344.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with
Thursday's late rates, included: 1.8275 West German marks, down from
1.8355; 1.5715 Swiss francs, up from 1.5510; 6.2505 French francs,
up from 6.2150; 2.0655 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0590; 1,346.50
Italian lire, up from 1,339.50; and 1.1982 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1957.
   Gold prices rose in Europe by more than $1 a troy ounce.
   In Hong Kong, where the day's trading begins, gold closed at
$405.18 a troy ounce bid, down from $406.36.
   In London, the late bid gold price was $405.75 a troy ounce, up
from $404.50. Gold also closed in Zurich, Switzerland, at $405.75
bid, up from $404.20.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $402.30 a troy ounce from $404.50 on Thursday.
Later, Republic National Bank of New York said gold bullion was bid
at $402 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down from $404.20 on Thursday.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.96 bid a troy ounce,
up from $5.95. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current
delivery fell to $5.888 a troy ounce from $5.916 on Thursday.

   Here are sales results for the seven major U.S.
automakers for the first period of January 1989.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals. There
were seven selling days in the period this year and seven selling
days last year, and seven selling days so far this year, compared
with seven selling days in the corresponding period a year earlier.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota and Mazda are counted as domestic and appear in this table.
Mazda began making cars at its Flat Rock, Mich., plant in October
1987.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and Chrysler
names are counted as foreign. Sales of imported cars and trucks are
reported at the end of each month.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Advance On Chilean Refinery Blast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices rose sharply Friday on New York's Commodity
Exchange in reaction to reports of a disastrous explosion at the
smelting operations of the world's largest copper mine near
Chuquicamata, Chile.
   On other markets, gold and silver futures retreated; coffee
futures fell; grains and soybeans were mostly higher; energy,
livestock and meat futures were mixed; and stock-index futures
advanced.
   Copper settled 4.3 cents to 5.2 cents higher with the contract
for delivery in March at $1.431 a pound. The Commodity Exchange's
spot copper price settled at the day's high of $1.536 a pound.
   The explosion of the flash furnace feeding Chilean Copper Corp.'s
Chuquicamata smelter was reported to have killed at least 16 people
and could result in significant production losses, putting further
strain on extremely tight copper supplies, analysts said.
   ``The question of how much production loss will occur is not
clear at all (but) any losses are very bullish because the market is
so tight,'' said Bette Raptopoulos, a metal-market analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Production problems have plagued the worldwide copper industry in
the past year, helping to drive the Commodity Exchange's spot-month
price to a record high of $1.6475 a pound on Dec. 8.
   A loss of production from Chuquicamata ``is not going to be a big
supply problem in times to come but it will have an immediate
short-term impact'' on prices, said analyst James Steel of Refco
Inc. in New York.
   Gold and silver futures prices fell moderately on the Commodity
Exchange, reflecting gains in the dollar's value against major
foreign currencies, analysts said.
   Gold settled $2.30 to $2.40 lower with February at $403.50 a troy
ounce; silver was 2.8 cents lower across the board with March at
$5.957 a troy ounce.
   Coffee futures ended lower in a second day of volatile activity
on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange. Despite the decline,
analysts said the market's bullish supply-and-demand fundamentals
remained in place.
   Coffee settled 1.38 cents to 3.01 cents lower with March at
$1.397 a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures ended mostly higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade ahead of an Agriculture Department crop report that
was released after the close of trading and is expected to boost
wheat prices, and pressure corn and soybean prices, on Monday.
   In the report, the USDA estimated 1989 winter-wheat seedings at
54.46 million acres, 12 percent above the 1988 tally but well below
analysts' pre-report estimates.
   The USDA said 1988 soybean production totaled 1.54 billion
bushels, 19.8 percent below the 1987 harvest but higher than most
pre-report estimates and higher than the agency's Nov. 9 projection
of 1.51 billion bushels.
   The government said 1988 corn production totaled 4.92 billion
bushels, 30.3 percent below the 1987 harvest but much higher than
pre-report estimates and the USDA's Nov. 9 projection of 4.67
billion bushels.
   The USDA pegged soybean stocks as of Dec. 1 at 1.37 billion
bushels, compared with 1.76 billion bushels a year earlier; corn
stocks at 7.07 billion bushels, compared with 9.77 billion bushels a
year earlier; and wheat stocks at 1.71 billion bushels, compared
with 2.51 billion bushels a year earlier. The soybean number was
slightly below expectations while the wheat and corn figures were
higher than expected.
   The winter-wheat seedings figure alone would have been ``very
bullish'' for the wheat market, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   But he said buying enthusiasm in the wheat market on Monday
probably would be tempered by the bearish corn and and soybean
production numbers and the bearish wheat and corn stocks figures.
   The corn numbers were ``a shockingly bearish surprise,''
Lespinasse said, and could translate into opening declines of more
than 5 cents a bushel on Monday.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents lower to { cent higher with March at $4.41
a bushel; corn was 2\ cents to 3 cents higher with March at $2.88\ a
bushel; oats were 4\ cents to 5\ cents higher with March at $2.43 a

unleaded gasoline was .52 cent to 1.20 cents higher with February at
49.97 cents a gallon.
   Livestock and meat futures finished narrowly mixed on the Chicago

<HEAD>Phillips, Chevron Boost Spending</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Chevron Corp. and Phillips Petroleum Co. said this week they plan
to increase their capital spending levels for refining and marketing
operations in 1989, while spending more exploration dollars overseas.
   The companies said their strategies to focus on ``downstream''
investment _ the businesses that refine and market chemicals,
gasoline and other products _ were based on projections for weak oil
prices into the 1990s.
   The downstream, or exploration and production, operations of most
major oil companies have been hurt in recent years because of low
oil prices. Despite a sharp rise in crude prices since November when
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to reduce
its output, many analysts and oil company executives have remained
skeptical that the gains would last beyond June, when the agreement
expires.
   Several oil companies have said recently they would reduce
domestic operations and concentrate on foreign exploration because
it is cheaper and the potential for finding oil is greater. In 1988,
U.S. oil production fell by an estimated 1 million barrels a day.
   Chevron, the fourth-largest oil company, said Friday it will
spend $3.8 billion in 1989, $400 million more than in 1988,
excluding its $2.5 billion acquisition of Tenneco oil and gas assets
in the Gulf of Mexico.
   Chevron said it would invest $350 million for chemical
production, up 50 percent from last year, and $1.1 billion for
refining, marketing and pipeline operations, 25 percent more than in
1988.
   The San Francisco-based company said its production budget would
remain virtually unchanged at $2 billion, but with increased
investments in Africa, Indonesia and the North Sea.
   Meanwhile, Phillips Petroleum said it would boost its capital
spending 8 percent to $975 million, concentrating on refining
operations and foreign exploration and production.
   The largest increase in the budget comes in the company's
petroleum refining, marketing, petrochemicals and plastics business
_ up from $330 million in 1988 to $389 million in 1989.
   The Bartlesville, Okla.-based company is expanding its
manufacturing capacity in several plastics lines at its Houston
chemical complex.
   Of the $406 million budgeted for worldwide exploration and
production projects, $228 million is earmarked for overseas where
the company said it sees strong potential for adding reserves in a
low oil and gas price environment.
   The foreign exploration and production budget of $228 million is
an increase from $159 million in 1988. Domestic exploration and
production was budgeted at $178 million for the year, down from $241
million.

<TEXT>
   Soft drink giant Pepsico Inc. has agreed to buy
General Cinema Corp.'s bottling business for $1.75 billion in cash,
the companies announced Friday, two weeks after an earlier deal fell
through.
   The previous deal, which carried a price tag of $1.5 billion,
disintegrated after the Federal Trade Commission asked for
additional details to determine whether it might violate antitrust
laws. The delay prevented the sale from being completed in time for
General Cinema to obtain tax deferral benefits.
   ``We're delighted that we reached a new agreement like this,''
said General Cinema spokesman Phil Nardone. He said the companies
negotiated for the past two weeks and ``every time one of the
parties walked away from the table, the other party came back, so it
showed you that both parties really wanted this transaction to come
to fruition.''
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Pepsico fell 75 cents
a share to $38.75 a share while General Cinema rose 37{ cents a
share to $24.37{.
   Pepsico spokesman Jim Griffith said despite the higher price tag,
the new deal won't actually cost Pepsico $250 million more because
of offsetting reductions in financing costs and taxes.
   ``Comparing the net after-tax cost of Pepsico of the deal we
signed today and the deal that we had hoped to do in 1988, the
difference to Pepsico is only about $60 million more,'' Griffith
said. ``The reason for that is that this deal allows us lower
effective financing costs and higher net tax benefits.''
   ``You're talking about a 5 percent difference and the deal makes
great sense for us both from a strategic standpoint and an operating
standpoint,'' Griffith said.
   Analysts have said the deal would bring one of the nation's
biggest independent bottlers under Pepsico's control, allowing the
Purchase, N.Y.-based company to consolidate bottling operations and
reduce costs.
   Under the new deal, General Cinema will not be able to defer $400
million in capital gains taxes over 20 years, because that provision
expired Dec. 31, but Nardone said the advantage of having cash,
which can be invested until the taxes are due, helps offset the loss.
   Nardone said the new cash deal is an improvement over the
previous arrangement, which was for a 20-year Pepsico note.
   The companies said the revised deal is subject to signing a
definitive agreement. The companies also said they do not anticipate
any unusual delays in giving the FTC the additional information it
wants.
   Nardone said the deal means General Cinema will be pulling out of
the bottling business, although it maintains an 18 percent interest
in Cadbury Schweppes PLC.
   General Cinema, a film exhibition and soft-drink bottling concern
based in Chestnut Hill, Mass., owns and operates 1,359 movie screens
at 318 locations. The company also owns about 60 percent of the
Neiman Marcus Group.
   General Cinema entered the bottling business in 1968 when it
acquired American Beverage Corp., which held Pepsi-Cola franchises
in Miami and northern Ohio. It subsequently purchased other
franchises and has regional bottling facilities in Atlanta;
Jacksonville, Fla.; Winston-Salem, N.C.; Twinsburg, Ohio and
Charleston, W. Va.
   The company's beverage unit had revenue of about $720 million for
the fiscal year ending Oct. 31.

<HEAD>Sundstrand May Pay Nearly $100 Million To Settle New Claims, Magazine
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKFORD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sundstrand Corp. declined to comment Friday
on a report that the aerospace contractor may pay the Defense
Department nearly $100 million to settle questionable billing
practices.
   Quoting unidentified sources, Business Week magazine said the
Pentagon is preparing an administrative settlement in which
Sundstrand would make payments both in cash and contract-price
guarantees to resolve the billing problem.
   ``We've made a standard practice not to comment on anything like
that, which first of all we haven't seen and secondly it's an
allegation on their part,'' Sundstrand spokesman Claude Vernam said.
   The settlement would compound the effect of an unprecedented
$127.3 million in fines levied against Sundstrand late last year
after the company pleaded guilty to overcharging the Pentagon on
defense contracts.
   In its Jan. 23 issue, Business Week reported that the
administrative claim alleges the company billed the government for
millions of dollars in costs unrelated to its Pentagon contracts.
   Sources also told the magazine that current or former Sundstrand
executives may be indicted by the U.S. attorney's office in Chicago.
   ``Whether or not there will be any indictments and when those
indictments would be handed down, we have no comment,'' said Bill
Clabault, one of several assistant U.S. attorneys working on the
case.
   The federal prosecutor's office routinely declines comment on
pending investigations.
   Sundstrand pleaded guilty Oct. 21 to four counts of defrauding
the government by overbilling on aircraft parts. It also pleaded
guilty in Washington state to one count of mischarging on government
contracts at its Seattle-area plant.
   Business Week also reported that Sunstrand, which makes
electrical systems used in military and commercial jets, has agreed
never to rehire 10 former executives, five of whom were fired Jan. 5
in a disciplinary action that involved 22 people.
   Also at the government's insistence, Sundstrand agreed to revise
its overhead accounting system, reducing the government's cost on
most contracts by 20 percent to 40 percent, the magazine said.
   In addition, it said, the company has guaranteed price reductions
on some Pentagon contracts and has separated government and
commercial production at its plants.
   Last month, Sundstrand's chairman and chief executive, Evans W.
Erikson, announced he was retiring.

<HEAD>Corporate Credit, Bond Ratings Decline In 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The overall quality of both corporate and
municipal bonds declined in 1988, a credit-monitoring firm said
Friday.
   Based on preliminary data, a record 386 corporate bond ratings
were lowered last year, representing $171 billion of debt, according
to Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. The previous record was the 364
downgrades in 1986.
   Conversely, 261 corporate bond ratings were raised last year,
representing $158 billion in debt, S&amp;P said. The number of upgrades
in 1988 far surpassed the old high of 188 in 1987, it said.
   The number of ratings is greater than the number of companies
issuing bonds because differing types of bonds issued by the same
company receive separate ratings, S&amp;P said.
   Several leveraged buyouts and recapitalizations, especially in
the retail industry, accounted for some of the lowered ratings, S&amp;P
said.
   Notable upgrades included Texaco Inc., Mobil Corp. and Ford Motor
Co., which together accounted for $42 billion of debt.
   The company said a negative trend continued in the ratings of
debt offerings of financial institutions.
   In municipal bonds, S&amp;P said large declines in the quality of
housing, utility and hospital issues more than offset positive
trends in general obligation and airport, port and college revenue
bonds.
   The firm said it lowered the ratings on 266 issues representing
about $23 billion of debt, while it raised the ratings on 112 issues
equaling about $17 billion of debt.
   In 1987, 269 municipal issues representing about $16.5 billion in
debt were downgraded, while 153 ratings on $25 billion in debt were
raised.
   The number of municipal bond issues increased in 1988 as the
market recovered from the federal tax reform act, S&amp;P said. A total
of 2,094 issues were rated last year, of which 82 were taxable. In
1987, 1,817 issues were rated, including 70 taxables.

   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Wall Street's
largest firm, said Friday it would report a loss for the fourth
quarter of 1988 due to bad investments in a troubled Texas bank.
   The company also said it would revise downward its profit for the
rest of 1988 because of previously reported accounting problems at
The Boston Co., a subsidiary that caters to wealthy clients.
   Shearson did not estimate the amount of quarterly loss from
devalued securities in MCorp of Dallas, but said it would release
fourth-quarter figures later this month. One stock analyst put the
loss at $15 million to $16 million.
   With capital exceeding $4.5 billion, 40,000 employees and more
than 700 offices worldwide, Shearson i the largest U.S. investment
firm. About 61 percent of it is owned by American Express Co., the
financial services giant.
   Shearson said it will record a pretax charge of $70 million in
the fourth quarter ended Dec. 30 to reflect a further reduction in
the value of MCorp securities. Shearson initially lowered the value
of the holdings in early 1988.
   To correct an overstatement in Boston Co. earnings, Shearson said
it would restate profit for the first three quarters of 1988 that
will lower Shearson's earnings for that period by $30 million, to
about $110 million.
   Shearson spokesman Michael O'Neill said the problem at The Boston
Co. stemmed from recording revenues that should have been deferred,
and deferring expenses that should have been recorded.
   He said an unidentified employee disclosed the problem and there
was no misuse of company or client assets.
   Last month, Shearson estimated the restatement would result in a
$15 million profit reduction. It also said three top Boston Co.
officers were suspended with pay over the improper accounting.
   Thomas Schick, another Shearson spokesman, said a committee of
outside auditors and Shearson officers is expected to determine who
was responsible within a few weeks.
   Shearson declined to name the three suspended officers. They have
been identified by Boston newspapers as President James N. von
Germeten, Executive Vice President Joseph F. Murphy and Chief
Financial Officer Michael J. Walsh.
   ``The review's conclusion was that what was involved here was
accounting decisions that would boost the reported earnings,''
Schick said. ``In terms of what the motive was, I cannot possibly
speak to that. We do not believe that any laws were broken.''
   Shearson said it would have reported a fourth-quarter profit
without the devaluation of MCorp holdings.
   Alison Deans, who follows the securities industry for Kidder,
Peabody &amp; Co. Inc., estimated the profit would have been $30 million
to $35 million, or 30 to 35 cents a share. Because of the MCorp
problem, the loss should be $15 million to $16 million, she said.
   Shearson said it owns MCorp money market cumulative prefered
stock with a face value of $117.5 million, and MCorp subordinated
debt securities with a principal amount of $29 million.
   After the adjustments, the preferred stock will be valued at
$29.4 million and the debt securities at $11.6 million, Shearson
said.
   MCorp, which has requested financial assistance from the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., in October declared a moratorium on payment
of preferred stock dividends and principal and interest on debt.
   Ms. Dean said Shearson acquired the MCorp securities after it
agreed to underwrite them, or bring them to market, in early 1988.
There was a lack of investor interest and Shearson ending up buying
them itself.
   It was unclear whether any other brokerage firms own MCorp
securities in any significant amount. But Ms. Dean said she did not
foresee the fallout from the troubles in the banking and savings and
loan industries becoming widespread in the securities industry.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, Shearson's shares
closed at $19.62{, up 87{ cents from Thursday.

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission has
allowed billionaire developer Donald Trump to buy more shares of
Caesars World Inc. stock, a Trump official said Friday.
   Trump has already bought a block of Caesars World stock. In
mid-December, he filed a notice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act for
a determination whether continued purchases would violate antitrust
laws.
   Susan Heilbron, an executive vice president of the Trump
Organization, said the FTC notified Trump on Monday that he could
buy more stock.
   ``We did not receive any requests for additional information and
they raised no questions about the antitrust implications,'' Ms.
Heilbron said.
   In his request to the FTC, Trump indicated he ``has the
good-faith intention, subject to price, availability and necessary
approvals,'' to acquire 15 percent of the stock. He also indicated
he may ``decide to seek control of (Caesars) through the acquisition
of 50 percent (or) more of the outstanding voting securities.''
   Trump, owner of two casino-hotels in Atlantic City and one under
construction, has not indicated how much stock he purchased in the
rival gaming company. But provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act
require people or companies to file with the trade commission when
they amass $15 million worth of stock in another company.
   The day after Trump officials received the notice from the FTC,
Caesars shareholders adopted a shareholder rights program designed
to prevent unfriendly takeovers.
   Under the new plan, if someone buys 20 percent of Caesars stock,
or if someone with 10 percent appears only interested in forcing the
company to buy back the stock at a premium, or if a person is
unqualified to hold a gaming license, then all other Caesars
shareholders have the right to buy additional stock at half its
market value.
   Trump has not commented on his involvement with Caesars. Ms.
Heilbron also said that even after the FTC ruling, ``Mr. Trump would
not comment on his plans.''

<HEAD>Friday the 13th Economic News Helps Dollar, Stocks, Bonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's Friday the 13th economic reports showing higher
inflation and a mixed picture for retail sales didn't cast any
bad-luck spells on the financial markets, where the dollar rallied,
bond prices jumped and stocks reached the highest level since the
Wall Street crash 15 months ago.
   The Labor Department said the rate of increase in wholesale
prices nearly doubled in 1988 to 4 percent, the worst pace since the
early 1980s. Although inflation remains far below the double-digit
era of last decade, many economists expressed concern.
   ``I don't like the sound of a doubling of inflation, but we have
to put 4 percent in perspective,'' said Robert Brusca, an economist
with Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. in New York ``It's not
that bad, but it's not that good either.''
   In another report released Friday, the Commerce Department said
retail sales in December rose a weak 0.2 percent, following strong
increases in October and November. But for the year, retail spending
rose 6.7 percent in 1988 to $1.61 trillion, the best performance in
four years.
   The wholesale prices report had little effect on the markets, but
some traders said the retail sales figure for December was weaker
than expected and suggested that inflationary pressure was easing,
which helped stocks and bonds.
   Others credited the strength in the markets to a relentless rise
in the dollar's value despite coordinated dollar-selling by major
central banks to stem the U.S. currency's advance. A more expensive
dollar makes investments denominated in the currency more attractive.
   In the bond market, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose
nearly $10 per $1,000 in face value, while its yield declined from
8.97 percent late Thursday to 8.88 percent, the lowest in more than
two months.
   Lower yields in the bond market encouraged investors to buy
stocks and helped the market reach another in a recent series of
post-crash highs. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
rose 3.75 points to 2,226.07, finishing the week with a net gain of
31.78 points.

<TEXT>
   A group of 84 former Empire Airlines pilots
now employed by Piedmont Aviation Inc. have filed a $25 million
lawsuit against the Winston-Salem, N.C.-based airline, its parent
company and the pilots' union.
   The suit will be served on Piedmont, USAir Group Inc. and the Air
Line Pilots Association next week, said Alan Peterman, a Syracuse
attorney who is representing the pilots.
   The suit claims the union arbitrarily refused to represent the
pilots' seniority interests and other employment rights in the
USAir-Piedmont merger and accuses all three organizations of
breaching contractual obligations to ensure the pilots' interests
were represented fairly, the attorney said.
   The suit was filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Syracuse.
   In December 1987, the pilots filed a $5.2 million lawsuit against
the union and its Piedmont Master Executive Council, which is
pending.
   Both lawsuits seek to increase the pilots' seniority with
Piedmont to include time spent flying for Empire. Empire, based in
Utica, N.Y., merged with Piedmont in 1986.
   The pilots' lawsuit contends they will lose pay, advancement
opportunities and transfer ability during the decade following the
merger because of their low placement on the integrated seniority
list.
   Peterman said he expects the airlines and union to ask for the
pilots' lawsuits to be consolidated. He said the 1987 lawsuit
probably would go to a non-jury trial by year's end.

<HEAD>Mitterrand Says Stock Exchange Authority to Get More Power</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand said Friday the French
stock market authority would be given greater powers to investigate
possible insider trading deals.
   Mitterrand spoke after two simmering controversies involving a
raid and a takeover took a political turn and threatened to
embarrass the Socialist government.
   The takeover involved state-owned Pechiney SA's acquisition late
last year of New York-based Triangle Industries, whose main asset is
the packaging company American National Can Corp.
   The stock market authority, the Commission des Operations de
Bourse, is investigating that deal after receiving an alert from its
counterpart, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Earlier in the week the French press disclosed that a friend of
Mitterrand bought Triangle shares before the takeover was finalized.
   The raid involved an unsuccessful attempt to change the makeup of
shareholder groups controlling the bank Societe Generale, in which a
state deposit institution provided a third of the funds involved.
   The right wing opposition charged that the involvement of the
institution meant the government supported the move.
   Mitterrand, speaking on a visit to the central French city of
Dijon, said the controversy did not bother him and he hoped it would
not bother the country.
   He said he had decided to broaden the stock market authority's
areas of competence and means to control dealings.
   Later, Prime Minister Michel Rocard said he would introduce
legislation at the spring session of Parliament to reinforce the
powers of the authority.
