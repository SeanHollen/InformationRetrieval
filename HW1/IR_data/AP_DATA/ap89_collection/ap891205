   Rebel and government forces called a
cease-fire Wednesday and evacuated hundreds of Americans and other
foreigners from hotels in Makati financial area where fighting had
kept them trapped for four days.
   The military chief named a negotiator to discuss a peaceful end
to the crisis with rebels who began a coup attempt against
President Corazon Aquino last Friday.
   Mrs. Aquino had earlier ruled out talks with the rebels and told
them ``surrender or die.'' In an emotional TV address Wednesday,
Mrs. Aquino appealed to the Filipino people for support.
   Speaking extemporaneously, an obviously fatigued Mrs. Aquino
asked Filipinos to turn out in the streets Friday in a show of
support like the February 1986 ``people power'' uprising that
propelled her into office and drove Ferdinand Marcos into exile.
   Wednesday was the sixth day of the insurrection.
   ``You, my beloved countrymen, I depend on you,'' she said. ``Let
us see each other on Dec. 8 and show to the world that the majority
of the Filipinos believe in democracy and will give everything they
can for progress and for peace.''
   The appeal seemed to be a sign that Mrs. Aquino faces mounting
pressure amid the armed challenge by military mutineers and demands
from her own followers for substantial changes in her policies and
administration.
   ``I know that I owe my presidency to you,'' she told the people.
``I did not think of being your president. I just wanted to serve
you. I just want to restore democracy. I want to respect your
rights. I am only asking you to help me. You are my only source of
strength for me to continue our reforms in government. I also
depend on you to see for yourself what these people are doing
against us.''
   Vicky Benito, a receptionist at the Manila Garden Hotel in the
Makati district, said Wednesday morning, ``All Americans are safe.
The Americans are all OK.''
   The U.S. Embassy and Philippine authorities said 164 Americans
were out safely, and that the evacuatio appeared complete. Also
reported out and safe were 70 British, 14 Swiss, 26 West Germans,
17 Singaporeans, 210 Japanese, 40 Australians and 41 Canadians.
   At least 77 people have been killed and more than 540 wounded
since rebel soldiers began their coup attempt.
   A statement by the armed forces said the cease-fire would remain
in effect ``until further orders'' in order ``to allow a smooth
withdrawal of hotel guests from the Makati area.''
   But the statement by military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de
Villa also said the cease-fire was ``in connection with ongoing
negotiations'' to end the fighting.
   De Villa designated Brig. Gen. Arturo Enrile, superintendent of
the Philippine Military Academy, to talk with rebels in the
financial district.
   More than 30 buses shuttled between the battle zone and a
shopping area near the airport, where evacuees were taken until
arrangements can be made for them to leave the country.
   U.S. Consul Bruce Beardsley some of those evacuated would leave
the Philippines on the first available flight.
   A rebel officer said Tuesday that the estimated 215 trapped
Americans might not go free because of U.S. support for Mrs. Aquino
during the uprising, including providing air cover early in the
revolt.
   But a statement issued Wednesday said the insurgents' executive
committee decided late Tuesday to free all the Americans because
``these American tourists are not our enemy.''
   On Wednesday, however, a statement issued in the name of a rebel
leader, Brig. Gen. Edgardo Abenina, declared the insurgents were in
a ``state of war.''
   ``We advise the U.S. government to prepare a plan for the
evacuation of its nationals as the impotent Aquino administration
may not be able to ensure their safety,'' said the statement
distributed to news organizations.
   ``We appeal to the American people to exert pressure on the
United States government to refrain from pursuing any policy or
action which may trigger a new Philippine-American War.''
   About 2,000 foreigners were believed trapped in hotels and
apartments in the area, which the rebels seized Saturday on the
second day of their uprising. ``It was slick,'' said Crosby Nash,
58, of Centerville, Md., of the evacuation. He had been stranded at
the Manila Garden Hotel. ``It was a superb operation. I think
there's certainly relief.''
   Fanny Dickins, a Briton who lives in Hong Kong, said staff at
the Intercontinental woke guests at 7:30 a.m. and told them to
report to the lobby with their smallest piece of luggage.
   She said a rebel officer was in the lobby to see off the
foreigners. Some of them posed for pictures with him.
   ``I found them all sympathetic,'' she said of the insurgents.
``They were very nice and extremely polite, all of them.''
   Safe passage for the foreigners was delayed Tuesday. However,
hundreds of other residents of the district were able to flee amid
the most serious coup attempt so far against Mrs. Aquino.
   Wednesday's evacuation included not only foreigners and
Filipinos in the area's three luxury hotels but also in
condominiums lining Ayala Avenue and other thoroughfares.
   Manila radio stations broadcast instructions to condominium
residents to stay in front of their buildings until the buses
arrived for pickup.
   Private Filipinos offered accommodation to foreigners because
hotels were jammed with Makati residents who fled earlier.
   Rafael Alunan, undersecretary of tourism, negotiated Tuesday
with the rebel leader in Makati. Talks at the Intercontinental
Hotel ended at sunset but apparently resumed early Wednesday. The
rebels offered Monday to let the foreigners leave.
   Earlier, insurgent Capt. Albert Yen said that ``the intention is
not to release Americans. ... U.S. meddling has caused the failure
of the first wave of our assault, so we hold them liable. It is the
responsibility of the U.S. government if we take their nationals
hostage.''
   On Friday, U.S. F-4 Phantom jets flew air cover for loyalist
forces. The planes did not fire on the rebels, but kept them from
continuing air strikes from Villamor Air Base. Rebels seized the
base early in the coup attempt.
   In Washington, the Bush administration had expressed public
concern for the trapped Americans.
   ``You can be assured that the Pentagon has contingency plans for
everything,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, but
would not elaborate.
   Four hundred mutinous Scout Rangers were operating in Makati and
400 other rebels still occupied Mactan Air Base in Cebu, 350 miles
south of Manila.
   Brig. Gen. Jose Commendador, leader of Mactan rebels, said
Tuesday a ``nationwide uprising by the military'' would result if
the government moved against them.
   Vice President Salvador Laurel said in a statement issued
Tuesday in Hong Kong resignation of the government would allow for
``a new mandate'' and avert civil war. Although still vice
president, Laurel broke with Mrs. Aquino in 1987 and formed an
opposition party.
   Continued fighting has strained the economy and weakened public
confidence.

   The Associated Press erroneously reported Dec.
5 that states are affected by a Supreme Court ruling dealing with
city and local government involvement in labor negotiations.
   The court ruled, 6-3, that Los Angeles city officials are
required to compensate a taxi company that went out of business
after the city interfered in a dispute between the company and its
drivers.
   The decision does not affect state governments. The court ruled
last June that states and state officials may not be sued under the
civil rights law at issue in the Los Angeles case.

<HEAD>Thornburgh to Decide Whether Special Prosecutor Needed in HUD Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is conducting a
preliminary inquiry on whether a special prosecutor should
investigate allegations that former Housing Secretary Samuel R.
Pierce violated the law.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh disclosed late Monday that he
had ordered the preliminary inquiry into allegations submitted last
month by 19 Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee.
   The department has 60 days to complete the preliminary inquiry.
Thornburgh's chief spokesman David Runkel said it began Saturday.
   Under the law, the inquiry by the Justice Department's public
integrity section must determine if there are ``reasonable grounds
to believe that further investigation is warranted'' by special
prosecutor, known as an independent counsel.
   Thornburgh's decision was forwarded to the House Judiciary
Committee in a brief letter, which was not released. It was also
filed under seal with a special division of the U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia that appoints independent
counsels and oversees their operation.
   One of the lawmakers, Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., praised the
decision, but suggested Thornburgh launched the preliminary inquiry
only after being prodded by Congress.
   ``There was no necessity of a Judiciary Committee request in
order for the Justice Department to act,'' Morrison said. ``They
could well have done so on their own.
   ``There is no indication that it wouldn't have happened without
our initiative,'' Morrison said.
   The procedure under the special prosecutor law was triggered
Nov. 2 when Morrison and 18 colleagues sent a letter to Thornburgh
requesting appointment of an independent counsel.
   The lawmakers said congressional hearings on the scandal at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development had uncovered evidence
of a conspiracy by Pierce and top aides to award grants based on
political favoritism.
   They also suggested there was evidence Pierce lied under oath
when he told the House Government Operations employment and housing
subcommittee he did not have ``hands on'' involvement in awarding
HUD grants.
   Pierce's lawyers, who had expressed confidence last month that
Thornburgh would find no basis to proceed with a preliminary
inquiry, offered a similar response to the latest news about their
client.
   ``Under the very low threshold the statute requires, we aren't
surprised that a preliminary inquiry has been undertaken,'' said
Robert Plotkin, one of Pierce's lawyers.
   Plotkin said he was confident that Justice Department
prosecutors ``will find there is no basis for appointing an
independent counsel.''
   But Morrison said there was enough evidence generated by
congressional hearings ``that justifies a careful look by an
independent counsel.''
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who with Morrison led the call for
an independent counsel, said Thornburgh's decision ``is a move that
should be welcomed by everyone, including ex-Secretary Pierce.''
   ``This investigation is a fair and thorough way to get answers
to questions that are not going away,'' Schumer said.
   After receiving the lawmaker's request last month, Thornburgh
accused Morrison and Schumer of trying to inject ``partisan
politics into this matter, which has until now been handled on a
non-partisan, professional way by the Congress, HUD and this
department.''
   ``Even more distressing is the assertion by the congressmen that
criminal acts have been committed before criminal investigations
have been completed,'' Thornburgh said.
   The attorney general bristled last week at a reporter's
suggestion that he might have trouble opening an investigation of
Pierce because the two men sat together on President Reagan's
Cabinet.
   ``Let me tell you this, in this or any other case, Dick
Thornburgh is going to go where the evidence leads,'' the attorney
general said. ``If the evidence is there, we will take appropriate
action; if it's not, we won't.''

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev had a direct question at
the superpower summit for President Bush's press secretary, Marlin
Fitzwater, who had derided the Soviet leader earlier this year as a
``drugstore cowboy.''
   ``Marlin, you lose 30 pounds?'' Gorbachev asked the once-stout
Fitzwater.
   There was no mention of the earlier jibe, which had been
intended to question Gorbachev's sincerity about arms-control
proposals.
   Instead, they talked about the liquid diet by which Fitzwater
has lost 35 pounds, dropping to 198 pounds.
   ``That's good,'' Gorbachev said.
   Pleased that the weight loss was noticed, Fitzwater thanked the
Soviet leader.
   Fitzwater gave reporters the account of the conversation with
Gorbachev aboard the Soviet cruise liner Maxim Gorky in Malta's
Marsaxlokk Bay, where Gorbachev and Bush held two days of talks.

<HEAD>Government Says Many ATV Dealers Violate Age Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An undercover government survey shows more
than half of all-terrain vehicle dealers are at least partially
violating an agreement with the Justice Department not to recommend
adult-size ATVs for children younger than 16.
   The study, released Monday by the Consumer Product Safety
Commission, was criticized by a spokesman for American Honda Motor
Co., one of the manufacturers involved in the 1988 consent
agreement limiting ATV sales.
   ``This survey was based on undercover casual conversations with
salesmen and did not involve a sales transaction,'' said Kirk
Antonius, a spokesman for Honda in Los Angeles.
   ``We have a safeguard built into the sales process that requires
the consumer to sign a document saying that he has seen and read
all of the proper safety information and is aware of the age
recommendations by the manufacturers.''
   Antonius also criticized the timing of the release of the
survey, conducted in June.
   ``This is more than a five-month delay in reporting this,'' he
said. ``If they had given us this information five months ago, it
would have helped us in talking to the dealers to be sure that
their sales representatives are doing their best job. If there are
some salesmen providing inappropriate age recommendations, we would
like to know about it and work with our dealers.''
   Ken Giles, a spokesman for the commission, said the survey was
conducted by a contractor and received by the commission about 10
days ago.
   The commission said it based its conclusion on the undercover
survey of 227 randomly selected ATV dealers.
   Recommending use by children under 16 of adult-size ATVs _ those
with engines larger than 80 cubic centimeters _ is contrary to a
consent decree agreed to in 1988 by the commission, the Justice
Department and five U.S. ATV distributors: American Honda Motor Co
Inc., Kawasaki Motors Corp. U.S.A., American Suzuki Motor Corp.,
Yamaha Motor Corp. U.S.A. and Polaris Industries.
   The decree requires ATV distributors to use their ``best
efforts'' to assure that dealers do not sell adult-size ATVs for
use by children under 16.
   ATVs are motorized machines that can traverse rough, off-road
terrain. They range in engine size from 50 to 500 cubic centimeters.
   The commission's study was the second in six weeks to indicate
widespread violation of the consent agreement.
   On Oct. 23, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a private
organization affiliated with consumer advocate Ralph Nader, said 54
percent of dealers it surveyed told volunteers who telephoned them
that an adult-size vehicle would be appropriate for use by children
under 16. That group surveyed 215 dealerships in California,
Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico,
Vermont and Washington.
   The commission said its undercover investigators asked dealers:
``What ATV would you recommend for my 13-year-old boy?''
   It said about 56 per cent of the dealers answered in ways either
partly or completely inconsistent with the age provisions of the
consent decree. Almost 30 percent of them mentioned there are
recommendations against selling big ATV's to children, but
discounted the warning. Another 26 percent did not mention the
age-size guidelines.
   The commission said more than 100 children die each year riding
adult-sized ATV's.
   It said none of the dealers surveyed were selling three-wheeled
ATVs, which are banned by the consent decree.

<TEXT>
   Two Iran-Contra prosecutors deny suggestions
by John Poindexter that they should not handle the case against the
former national security adviser because they were tainted by his
testimony on Capitol Hill under a grant of immunity.
   Poindexter's lawyers say his high-profile testimony compelled by
Congress hopelessly compromised the government's case against their
client.
   However, prosecutors Dan Webb and Howard Pearl said in court
Monday that they were busy with their careers during Poindexter's
nationally televised appearances in July 1987.
   ``I could not tell you if you held a gun to my head one single
fact'' about Poindexter's testimony, said at a pre-trial hearing
called by U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene to consider a
defense motion that the indictment against Poindexter be dismissed.
   Webb, a former U.S. attorney in Chicago, said he was aware
Poindexter was a high-ranking Reagan administration official but
didn't know he was the national security adviser.
   Pearl said he was ``absolutely sure'' he never watched the
Iran-Contra hearings because he was tied up at the U.S. attorney's
office in Chicago handling a criminal investigation of sports
agents.
   Both prosecutors, hired within the past few months to handle the
Poindexter prosecution, acknowledged they must have seen news
accounts of the hearings.
   Greene took the matter under advisement. Oliver North is
scheduled to testify when the pre-trial hearing resumes Dec. 12.
   A 1972 Supreme Court ruling bars prosecutors from making any use
of a defendant's testimony compelled under a grant of immunity.
Poindexter testified under such a grant of immunity about a 1985
arms shipment to Iran.
   Poindexter is charged with one count of conspiracy, two counts
of obstructing Congress and two counts of making false statements
in the Iran-Contra scandal. His trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 22.
   He is accused of trying to cover up North's involvement in the
secret Contra resupply effort and of trying to hide the fact that
Reagan administration officials knew about a 1985 shipment of Hawk
missiles to Iran at the time it happened. The Hawks shipment was
assisted by the CIA without a signed presidential finding as
required by law.
   Webb, who was in private law practice during the congressional
Iran-Contra hearings, said he recalled questions raised in the news
media about ``whether President Reagan had ordered subordinates to
lie or obstruct Congress.''
   Webb said he also remembered questions about ``whether the
president was involved in arms to Iran for hostages'' and
``generally whether the president knew of the diversion of funds
from the Iran effort to the Contra aid effort.''

   The stone plaque calling the
Yasmina quarter the ``neighborhood of the two martyrs'' has not
kept pace with the anger and bitterness built up in two years of
the Palestinian uprising.
   The neighborhood of 6,000 Palestinians, crowded into the old
marketplace known as the Casbah, now has 14 ``martyrs,'' men and
teen-age boys shot by Israeli soldiers along the narrow streets.
   Yasmina has seen all the many sufferings and the few small
triumphs of the ``intefadeh,'' the uprising that began on Dec. 8,
1987, to demand Israel end its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Flag-waving demonstrations, stones, firebombs and the killing of
suspected collaborators have been common in Yasmina, Arabic for the
fragrant Jasmin flower.
   The Israeli response has been tear gas, gunfire, arrests, the
demolition of houses. The latest example came Dec. 2 when soldiers
shot to death four men blamed for killing fellow Palestinians
accused of collaborating with Israel.
   Some Palestinians and Israelis question whether the uprising is
losing its steam after two years of suffering with no real
political gains. But in Yasmina, the talk is of defiance, revenge,
carrying on the battle for a Palestinian state.
   ``We don't want the blood of our sons to go for nothing,''
replied Yusra El Masri, 42, when asked if the revolt will persist.
On the wall opposite hangs a blurry enlargement of a family
snapshot that shows her son, Bashar, dead at age 20.
   ``He was trying to throw two firebombs,'' she said
matter-of-factly.
   Another son and a son-in-law are in jail, accused of taking part
in the uprising, Mrs. El Masri said. She complained angrily of
dozens of visits by Israeli soldiers to question her other five
sons.
   Pulling her youngest son, 3-year-old Fuad, close to her, Mrs.
Masri said: ``I hope he will grow up and avenge the death of his
brother.''
   It's uncertain how much the defiance expressed by Mrs. Masri and
others in Yasmina is mere bravado. One former Nablus policeman,
long familiar with the Casbah, was asked if residents were not worn
down by the long revolt.
   ``They are tired, of course, but I'm not sure they admit it even
to themselves,'' he replied, asking that his name not be used.
   After two years, there is reason for weariness. The Palestinian
economy, never well-developed, has been further hurt by the
three-hour store hours and almost weekly general strikes ordered by
the PLO-backed leaders of the uprising.
   By army estimate, more than 40,000 Palestinians have been
arrested and at least 8,900 injured in the uprising in the West
Bank and Gaza. Palestinians say the numbers are higher.
   In Nablus, with a population of about 100,000, the death toll
from Israel is 66 in the past two years.
   Throughout the West Bank and Gaza, where 1.7 million people
live, 625 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis. At least 154
others have been slain by fellow Arabs as suspected collaborators.
Forty-three Israelis also have been killed.
   Scars of the violence are visible on Sharea Lulu _ Street of the
Pearl _ where the El Masri family lives. Near their home stands the
wreckage of a house partly demolished by the army after a concrete
block was dropped from its roof last February, killing an Israeli
soldier, Binyamin Meisner, 24.
   An Israeli reservist who has served in Nablus said the city
holds both dangers and frustrations for soldiers.
   The 29-year-old corporal, whose name could not be used under
army regulations, said patrolling the Casbah means staying alert to
every motion atop the two- and three-story buildings.
   ``At any moment, you can have rocks or bottles all over you,''
he said, adding that troops also must constantly decide when they
can open fire under regulations allowing use of live ammunition
only if a soldier's life is in danger.
   ``It's a frustration. You're a soldier with a weapon,'' he said.
``It's a very difficult thing. It's spur of the moment.''
   Despite the many deaths in Nablus, the soldier added, ``the
number of casualties is in line with the rules.''
   Abed El Sayeh, whose 13-year-old brother died in army gunfire
last year, has an understandably different view of soldiers' rules.
``Here they shoot at anything that moves,'' he said.
   El Sayeh lives on Sharea Lulu, only steps from the memorial to
the ``two martyrs: his brother, Samir, and a 14-year-old neighbor,
Khaled Tubeleh.
   The families of both can recite a litany of deaths, injuries,
arrests and humiliations at the hands of Israeli soldiers.
   Abed, 21, said he has been jailed four times in the uprising.
Another brother, age 11, broke his arm falling from a roof as
soldiers chased him. The fiance of a 16-year-old sister, Bahia, was
killed Sept. 2 in an army raid.
   Abed expects the stone-throwing and rioting to go on ``until the
Palestinian state is here and the Palestinian flag is flying.'' He
hinted that guns may replace stones if the uprising fails to
produce real results.
   ``We are waiting for peace,'' he said. ``If there's no solution,
there are other means. ... People here would be glad if it turned
to armed struggle.''
   So far, Abed said, the uprising's success has been in forging
Palestinian unity and focusing world attention on Israel's
occupation.
   Israeli officials maintain, however, that Palestinian unity is
often maintained by fear.
   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, Israel's armed forces chief of staff, said
last week the army's task in Nablus was stopping gangs of uprising
enforcers who have been blamed for most of the deaths of 23
supposed collaborators.
   ``I would say our main effort is not directed against the
general public, but against the terror squads that are using force
and pressure on the large groups of population in order to get them
out on the streets,'' he said.
   A day later, a 35-year-old woman was shot to death as an alleged
collaborator in the Casbah. Nearby, a reporter encountered several
members of a gang called the Black Panthers, including one man with
a bulky bag he said held an M-16 assault rifle.
   Another man said the group was ready to expand its activities to
killing Israelis if PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat ended his order to
keep the uprising a ``revolution of stones.''
   ``This is the time for punishing collaborators. When we have
orders from Arafat, we'll finish the others,'' said the man,
wearing a pendant in the colors of the Palestinian flag.
   Eight days after he made that threat, the man and his friend
with the bulky bag were among four Palestinians killed by soldiers
outside a barber shop in the Casbah.

   Until two years ago, the Soviets jammed the
Voice of America and vilified it as an instrument of American
propaganda.
   Until last year, the U.S. government's radio network couldn't
get permission to station a correspondent in Moscow.
   Now, the VOA is playing supersonic tag with Mikhail Gorbachev.
   When Gorbachev flew to Malta for his summit with President Bush,
the ``chase plane'' of journalists from Moscow accredited by the
Kremlin to cover the event also carried VOA Moscow correspondent
Andre de Nesnara.
   De Nesnara, a Russian-speaking American, has been stationed in
Moscow for a year covering the fast-paced changes in the Soviet
Union for the radio network that broadcasts more than 2,000 hours
weekly in 49 languages.
   The crumbling order in Eastern Europe, one of the prime regions
targeted for more than 40 years by VOA broadcasts, has afforded the
network undreamed of opportunities to report on a part of the world
never before accessible to its correspondents. But is has also
forced changes in network thinking.
   ``We came to the conclusion about two years ago that we had to
be more compelling, more interesting'' to compete with the
increasingly free and lively programs by radio stations in Eastern
Europe, said Sidney A. Davis, VOA's programming director.
   VOA has aired roundtable satellite discussions between Soviet
and American experts, as well as call-in programs from the Soviet
Union with listeners asking questions about economic, medical and
scientific issues.
   ``We can offer them expertise their radio stations can't,''
Davis said.
   But the fact remains that VOA gets its money, $180 million
annually, from the U.S. government. Its editorials still reflect
official policy.
   While the editorials on the summit didn't tell VOA listeners
anything that Bush himself didn't tell Gorbachev at Malta, the
language was blunter.
   The United States contends Nicaragua and Cuba are shipping
Soviet-made arms to leftist guerrillas in El Salvador to fight the
U.S.-backed government. Gorbachev said his government isn't
involved and had been assured by the Nicaraguan government that it
has not shipped any weapons to the Salvadoran rebels.
   Bush told reporters at the joint news conference with Gorbachev
that he and the Soviet leader ``have a difference.'' Giving
Gorbachev the benefit of the doubt, Bush said: ``I don't believe
the Sandinistas have told the truth to our Soviet friends.''
   But a Dec. 1 VOA opinion piece was more direct.
   ``High levels of Soviet aid to Cuba and Nicaragua help these
countries to support subversion and destabilization in Central
America,'' it said. ``The Soviet Union should press Cuba and
Nicaragua to curb such activities.
   ``The Soviet Union also continues to pour massive amounts of
heavy weapons into Afghanistan. These weapons are taking a terrible
toll on civilians and help to keep in power a repressive communist
regime.''
   Transcripts of the broadcast reports, as well as of the
editorials, were made available under a recently publicized policy
of openness by VOA.
   The station's 1942 charter forbids it to disseminate its
broadcasts within the United States to prevent the VOA from being
used by the administration to indoctrinate Americans.
   The law does allow American reporters and academics to review
VOA material, but network officials say this access was not widely
known until a recent case involving a lawsuit by NBC News President
Michael Gartner.
   Gartner contends VOA only began allowing access to its broadcast
material after he filed suit against the network's parent agency,
the U.S. Information Agency, which argued that barring
dissemination of USIA material within the United States violates
the First Amendment.
   A U.S. District Court in Iowa last month dismissed Gartner's
suit.

   Vice President Dan Quayle says the Soviet
Union's foreign policy is largely unchanged and he believes the
Soviets' pursuit of their interests creates instability in other
countries, according to a report Tuesday.
   In remarks reflecting more apparent skepticism than President
Bush has shown about Soviet intentions, Quayle said the Soviets
have ``very significant interests beyond their borders and those
interests create instability.''
   ``I don't think they've changed much in foreign policy,'' Quayle
said in an interview with The Washington Post in Tuesday editions.
   ``We cannot count on the Soviets, out of the goodness of their
hearts, in alleviating those tensions for us.''
   But Quayle said he viewed events in one area beyond the borders
of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, as reflecting Soviet domestic
policy.
   ``I get into debates on this with people (in the administration)
who ask about Eastern Europe,'' Quayle was quoted as saying.
   Though Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has been very helpful
in spurring Communist governments in Eastern Europe to reform, ``I
don't view that as a matter of foreign policy as much as domestic
policy.''
   ``My viewpoint is the new thinking and the real reform is in the
area of economics,'' Quayle said.
   Quayle said he ``hadn't seen any evidence of their slackening
off'' aid to Cuba and Nicaragua.
   On the summit meeting of President Bush and Gorbachev, Quayle
said he thought a strategic arms agreement ``is something that
could be achieved'' on the timetable agreed to by the two leaders.
   Bush told a news conference in Brussels on Monday the West
stands ``at the threshold of a new era'' but he declined to endorse
Gorbachev's suggestion that the Cold War is over. ``That day hasn't
arrived,'' Bush said.

<HEAD>Ozone Hole Closed for Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Antarctic ozone hole is closed for this
year after the window allowing dangerous ultraviolet radiation to
reach the Earth was open at near record levels.
   The hole, actually a region of depleted ozone levels in the
stratosphere over the South Pole, approached record levels in
October, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said
Monday.
   Ozone levels in that region have returned to normal, said Walter
Komhyr of NOAA's Air Resources Laboratory.
   Ozone in the upper atmosphere helps screen the Earth from
dangerous ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Scientists are
concerned the hole over Antarctica could endanger marine life in
that region and, if the depletion spreads, cause increased skin
cancer and other health problems.
   Scientists measure ozone in Dobson units, with a measurement of
270 to 300 considered normal for the area over the Antarctic.
   When the ozone hole forms, levels drop drastically, setting a
record at 125 Dobson units in 1987 and falling to 135 units this
year.
   Levels rebounded to 322 units by mid-November, then declined
somewhat and are now estimated at near 300, Komhyr said in a
telephone interview.
   During the Antarctic spring, a band of winds encircles the
continent, preventing the air there from mixing with the atmosphere
in other parts of the world.
   During that period, temperatures drop to minus 125 degrees
Fahrenheit and colder in the upper atmosphere, creating a situation
in which manmade chlorofluorocarbon chemicals can mix with and
destroy the ozone. Those reactions cease later in the year, when
temperatures warm to minus 70 degrees or so, and the winds break
down, allowing polar air to mix once again with air from other
areas and thus restore ozone to more normal levels.
   The breakup of the polar vortex winds has been occurring quite
late in the last few years, Komhyr said, compared with the 1960s
and 1970s, when it took place several weeks earlier. The cause of
the delay is not well understood, he said.
   The period of greatest ozone depletion this year extended from
Oct. 6 to Oct. 9, Komhyr said. The depletion was nearly as deep as
in 1987, but didn't last quite as long as that year, he said.

<TEXT>
   The leftist political
opposition and humanitarian groups labeled as subversive for
working with the poor have been driven underground or out of the
country by a climate of persecution.
   Eileen Rosin, the sole representative of the Los Angeles-based
Medical Aid for El Salvador, left the country Monday after
discovering her office was ransacked over the weekend.
   Neighbors said about 20 men in military uniforms entered it
before dawn Saturday.
   For eight years, Medical Aid has distributed money for
prosthetic devices, delivered donated medicines to hospitals and
sent dozens of children to the United States for operations beyond
the technical means of Salvadoran hospitals.
   Ms. Rosin, 35, had worked in El Salvador for two years and left
reluctantly for Los Angeles.
   ``We had two little girls lined up for heart operations in the
States. I don't know what will happen to them now,'' she said.
   The United Nations on Friday said it will transfer its
Salvadoran offices to Guatemala ``for lack of guarantees.''
   Officials found equipment and furniture at the main U.N. offices
smashed following fighting last week around the building, in the
affluent neighborhood of Escalon.
   Army troops had occupied the offices, which administered UNICEF
and refugee projects, after U.N. personnel were evacuated. When
U.N. officials returned, they found scrawled on the walls: ``U.N.
equals FMLN equals Traitors.''
   The letters stand for Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front,
the rebel group that last month launched its biggest offensive of
the 10-year-old civil war.
   The U.S.-backed government of rightist Alfredo Cristiani
responded by declaring a state of siege that suspended
constitutional guarantees.
   Hundreds of people have been detained since, including two dozen
foreigners who work with churches or humanitarian groups. Almost
all the non-Salvadorans have been deported, although some remain
jailed facing charges.
   Foreigners who work with the poor are called
``internationalists,'' and they are a favorite target of the right,
which accuses them of supporting revolution.
   A flier signed ``Salvadoran air force,'' considered the most
rightist branch of the armed forces, was found strewn on city
streets over the weekend.
   ``With God, reason and might, we shall conquer,'' it said.
``Salvadoran patriot: You have every right to defend your life and
your property. If in order to do this you have to kill FMLN
terrorists and their internationalist allies, do it.''
   ``We are in the catacombs. There is no prospect for above-ground
humanitarian work with the poor in the short or middle term,'' said
Episcopalian Rev. Luis Serrano, whose church has for years done
social, medical and educational work with displaced people and
refugees.
   He commented in an interview in Mariona prison, where he and
eight members of his church are jailed as alleged subversives.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has said the crackdown by
the government and armed forces was ``absolutely appropriate.''
   Washington has provided $4 billion in aid this decade to the
Salvadoran government in the war, which has killed 71,000 people,
1,000 of them in the latest fighting.
   U.S. Ambassador William Walker likened the raids and arrests to
the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.
   ``I'm not condoning it. But in times like these of great emotion
and great anger, things like this happen. Even in the U.S., with
all its guarantees, it happened,'' Walker said.
   ``There are a series of indications of a climate of
persecution,'' said Monsignor Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary
bishop of San Salvador, after Mass on Sunday. ``Not only against
personnel of the Catholic church, but against many people who try
to help the most humble and the most poor.''
   ``It appears that the military authorities, in their quest to
restore order, have adopted as their criteria the saying, `Think
the worst, and you'll be right,''' he said.
   The climate of war and fear has tinged even jokes. One goes like
this:
   Two soldiers are patrolling the streets 10 minutes before the
beginning of the nightly curfew. They pass a man walking quickly in
the opposite direction. One soldier turns around and fatally shoots
the man.
   ``Why'd you do that?'' asks his companion.
   ``I know that guy. He lives 20 minutes from here.''

   National drug director William J. Bennett and
budget director Richard Darman are ``apart by more than a couple of
hundred million dollars'' on spending to fight drugs in 1991 and
President Bush may settle the dispute, an administration official
says.
   ``It's a big enough gap that it's likely to have to go to the
president,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The recently approved anti-drug budget for the 1990 fiscal year
totaled $8.8 billion, which Congress had boosted by $900 million
over Bush's request of $7.9 billion.
   ``I'd expect to see a real increase'' in 1991, not just an
adjustment for inflation, the official said in an interview Monday.
   But how much has not been determined, said the source, who
refused to provide details on how much is being sought by Bennett,
director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, and how
much is sought by Darman, director of the Office of Management and
Budget.
   ``Bennett and Darman are apart by more than couple of hundred
million dollars,'' the official said. ``It may end up going to the
president to get things sorted out. Hard to know when.''
   Bennett spokesman Don Hamilton said, ``This is the time of year
when lots of agency heads and Cabinet secretaries are talking to
Darman, occasionally in strong terms.''
   Meanwhile, Bennett's office is continuing work on what is being
referred to among officials as ``Strategy Two,'' the update on the
national drug control strategy Bush presented Sept. 5. The update,
like the original strategy, was required by Congress.
   Hamilton said the updated strategy will add detail to some
areas, focus on several anti-drug plans being employed around the
country that are working and will get into specifics on proposed
budgets.
   Expected to be included are the designations of cities or areas
considered ``high-intensity drug trafficking areas'' that would be
eligible for additional federal resources, both in money and
personnel.
   Published reports have said the areas to be designated in the
upcoming strategy are Los Angeles, New York, Miami, Houston and the
southwest border, but officials in Bennett's office say no final
decisions have been made.
   ``The conversations in reference to high-intensity drug
trafficking areas are still ongoing,'' said Reggie Walton, the drug
office's associate director for state and local affairs.
   ``I have thoughts in my mind what areas stand at the top of the
list,'' said Walton, who took the lead on determining the criteria
for designating the targeted areas.
   In the current fiscal year, only $25 million total has been
allocated from the federal budget for such areas, but that could
increase by $20 million to $21 million with money coming out of the
federal asset forfeiture fund, Walton said. That fund contains
revenue from assets seized from drug traffickers.
   The second administration official said even the higher amount
``is not that much money to begin with. Los Angeles spent $2
billion in the drug war in L.A. County. We're looking at dividing
this money up among four, five, six, seven areas. What can you do
with this money? Obviously, we'll be looking at more money later.''
   Walton would not say how much money he would seek in the 1991
budget for the high-intensity drug trafficking areas.
   The federal effort to crack down on drugs in the nation's
capital alone will cost about $97 million, Bennett has said.
However, that includes money for three drug treatment centers and a
new jail for the District of Columbia still in the planning stages.
   Walton said some places designated as high-intensity drug
trafficking areas could get computers to enhance targeting of
money-laundering operations, while others may need more prosecutors
or law enforcement agents.

<HEAD>Ted Turner's Neighbors Want Electricity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPPS, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five families who live without electricity
near Ted Turner's 8,100-acre plantation say they want the
broadcasting executive to allow power lines to cross his property
to their homes.
   Dressie Sloan, with the Jefferson County National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, accused Turner of trying to
get rid of his poor neighbors by refusing to extend the electric
lines.
   ``One word from Mr. Turner, and they'd have their lights,''
Sloan told the Tallahassee Democrat Sunday. ``He has the power and
the money to do it, but he wants to squeeze them out.''
   But Avalon Plantation manager George Purvis said Turner was only
complying with a former owner's restrictions.
   ``Mr. Turner has never tried to get those people to move out,''
Purvis told the newspaper. ``But Mrs. (Alexandra) McKay thought an
above-ground wire would destroy the national beauty of her land.''
   Dee Woods, Turner's personal assistant in Atlanta, said he was
unavailable to answer Sloan's complaint.
   About a mile through the woods from the plantation, Frances
Oliver has lived in one of the three tarpaper-covered shacks for 30
years.
   ``We used to have a school out here, a church and maybe a couple
hundred people,'' she said. About a dozen people now live on almost
215 acres surrounded by tree farms, hunting clubs and plantation
forest.
   Ms. Oliver said she relies on a wood stove for cooking and
heating. She totes water from a plantation well and reads by a
kerosene lamp. Car batteries run her TV set.
   Electricity would be nice, Ms. Oliver said. ``Maybe it would
bring the people back,'' she said.
   But even if Turner did approve the extension, Purvis said he
wondered who would foot the bill. A power line from the
plantation's terminal to the houses would cost at least $40,000,
according to Ronald Bass, a manager for Tri-County Electric
Cooperative.
   State law gives people the right to draw power from a utility
company, but since Tri-County is a rural co-op it operates under
federal guidelines, and does not have to install the lines free of
charge.

   A woman stole a patrol car from a

boyfriend with a stalled car, authorities said.
   Beverly J. Watt, 29, got into the car and headed north on
Interstate 25, leaving behind a confused boyfriend and a bewildered

   Watt was arrested a short time after the incident Sunday
following a chase in Cheyenne, Wyo., that ended in a collision

   Watt was admitted to a Cheyenne hospital for psychiatric
observation, Klith said, adding that charges are pending.
   Deputy Bill Eckrich had stopped to talk with the stranded

   ``The next thing we knew, she was talking on his radio,'' Klith
said. ``She was very belligerent and using foul language. She

   ``I love playing Eddie. But, I didn't want to reprise the role

   Rather than inspiring creativity, drugs more
often hamper musicians, blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan and
other artists say in the December issue of Musician magazine.
   ``The obsession with the quick fix becomes not just a crutch,
but everything to us,'' said Vaughan, who recently kicked a
long-term drug habit. ``And then what really matters gets pushed
out the window.''
   The Red Hot Chili Peppers' latest album, ``Mother's Milk,''
includes an anti-drug anthem inspired by the recent death of the
band's guitarist, Hillel Slovak, from a heroin overdose. ``Losing
your best friend at the age of 26 is a mind- and soul-blower,''
said Anthony Kiedis, the funk band's lead singer.
   Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead recently gave up an eight-year
heroin habit, but says, ``It's tough for me to adopt a totally
anti-drug stance. ... (Heroin is) the perfect comfort drug. I
understand perfectly why people use it. It would be a nice old-age
drug. But it's definitely wrapped up in itself; it doesn't let you
go anywhere.''

   Officials of an anti-drug program are
defending it against complaints by Alice Sessions, wife of FBI
Director William Sessions, who resigned as head of the organization.
   Ms. Sessions said the ``Join the Move'' project used the FBI
chief's name to court donations and ``I just couldn't be associated
with that.''
   One of those who got a sales call was the Sessions' son, who
lives in Texas, she told the Austin American-Statesman.
   Ms. Sessions also expressed concern over the group's
fund-raising tactics, which involved selling spices, jellies and
sauces.
   Officials of the program, sponsored by the Austin-based Texas

   Reforms in Eastern Europe allowed a
change in location for the shooting of a movie on the life of
Polish leader Lech Walesa, a report says.
   The film will be shot in Poland instead of West Germany as
originally planned, according to the Hollywood Reporter.
   The authorized biography of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning
Solidarity leader will be produced by James W. Brubaker and Thom
Mount beginning in 1990, Warners and the Mount Co. said in a joint
release Monday announcing the $20 million film.
   Mount acquired the rights to Walesa's story nine months ago from
a group that included director Stanley Kramer.

<HEAD>Congressional Budget Writers Wary of `Peace Dividend'</HEAD>

   Top Democratic congressional budget writers
agree with President Bush's warning that a proposed trimming of the
Pentagon's budget won't produce a ``peace dividend'' for domestic
programs.
   Liberals and other lawmakers hope the easing of Cold War
tensions will translate into a siphoning of defense money into
health, education, transportation and other domestic needs.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is studying plans to pare up to
$180 billion from anticipated military spending increases through
1994. The administration says it's still trying to decide what the
size and shape of the cuts will be.
   But the chairmen of Congress' two budget committees expressed
caution Monday for those who hope the reductions will mean a
windfall for other government initiatives.
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., said his
analysis of defense reductions under study by the administration is
that savings of just $2 billion are likely next year.
   Over five years, military spending would still increase by $200
billion, excluding the effects of inflation, he said.
   ``Clearly, there is no so-called peace dividend,'' said Sasser,
whose figures were based on Pentagon plans and economic projections
announced earlier this year.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee, said there are still too many unknowns to predict
whether domestic programs will benefit from defense cuts Bush is
expected to propose.
   Panetta said there are questions about the types of savings he
will seek, whether aid will be sought to offset economic
dislocations caused by closed bases and weapons plants, and how
much of the cutbacks would go to deficit reduction.
   ``I have always been very cautious about arguing for a defense
dividend,'' he said.
   Liberal lawmakers argue that with better U.S.-Soviet relations,
it's time to shrink the defense budget, which comprises about
one-fourth of the government's $1.2 trillion annual spending.
   ``The more you cut from the military, the less damage you do to
domestic programs to meet Gramm-Rudman targets,'' Rep. Barney
Frank, D-Mass., said Monday.
   Frank has been a leader of a group of liberals pressing
congressional leaders to slash about $20 billion from the Pentagon
budget and redistribute most of it among health, housing, education
and other domestic programs.
   Bush, speaking Monday to reporters at a Brussels, Belgium, news
conference after his summit with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, tried to douse those hopes.
   ``We have a lot of demands at home, and there's no question
about that,'' Bush said. ``But I think it is premature to speak as
some are at home about a peace dividend _ take a lot of money out
of defense and put it into other worthy causes.''
   The president cited the problems the government will have in
scraping together enough savings to meet the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law's requirement of a fiscal 1991 shortfall of
no more than $64 billion.
   The administration is expected to forecast a deficit for fiscal
1990, which ends Sept. 30, of about $110 billion. Bush will submit
his proposed 1991 budget to Congress on Jan. 22.
   ``There just isn't a lot of, quote, excess money, unquote,
floating around there,'' Bush said.
   The cuts Cheney is considering would be made from increases
already projected. Thus, rather than reducing military spending
totals, they are widely expected on Capitol Hill to leave Defense
Department outlays near the current level of about $290 billion.
   Since 1986, military spending has decreased by an average of 3
percent annually when inflation is taken into account, even though
the actual amount going to the Pentagon has increased each year.
Defense Department outlays, $265 billion in 1986, should reach $287
billion this year.
   Defense spending is difficult to shrink quickly because much of
it _ such as purchases of fleets of jet fighters _ is committed in
contracts that span several years. Even reducing numbers of troops
has offsetting costs, such as higher civilian unemployment rates.
   The conventional wisdom among lawmakers and lobbyists is that
the 1991 Defense Department budget is unlikely to contain
reductions of more than $3 billion to $8 billion from the increases
that were already planned for the year.

<HEAD>Molten Rock Triggers Quakes Under Volcano, But Eruption Unlikely</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Molten rock moving beneath California's
Mammoth Mountain ski resort triggered thousands of small
earthquakes since May, but the U.S. Geological Survey says the old
volcano is unlikely to erupt.
   ``We still see occasional bursts of quake activity, but it's
much more sporadic'' in recent weeks than in June, when hundreds of
tiny jolts each day rattled the 11,053-foot mountain in the Sierra
Nevada, said USGS geophysicist Dave Hill, the scientist in charge
of monitoring the situation.
   In a statement issued Monday, the federal agency said: ``While
eruptive activity as a consequence of this current earthquake swarm
cannot be ruled out, observations at many volcanoes in the world
suggest the most likely outcome ... is a return to an extended
period of relative quiescence.''
   Hill discussed the ``swarm'' of quakes under Mammoth Mountain
during a Monday session at the American Geophysical Union's fall
meeting.
   Only four of the thousands of quakes that started May 4 measured
more than 3 on the Richter scale, so most were too small to be
felt. Some of the quakes were only 1.5 miles deep and often came in
rapid-fire bursts.
   Mammoth Mountain has bulged upward about one-half inch since
May, Hill said.
   The most likely explanation for the quakes and bulging is that
molten rock, or magma, is being squeezed into a vertical crack that
extends from 3.5 miles to 6 miles below Mammoth Mountain's south
flank, he said.
   This sheetlike intrusion is called a dike, and excavations at
many old volcanoes reveal that most dikes never erupt to the
surface, Hill explained.
   Mammoth Mountain, now covered with ski runs, last erupted
explosively about 50,000 years ago and is located just outside the
southwest rim of Long Valley caldera. The caldera is a
20-by-10-mile oval-shaped crater created 730,000 years ago by one
of the world's greatest eruptions.
   That blast spewed at least 600 times more material than the May
18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens.
   The resort town of Mammoth Lakes sits inside the caldera a few
miles east of Mammoth Mountain. Hill cautioned against undue
volcano phobia, saying it is ``more dangerous to drive up on U.S.
395 than to spend time skiing or living near Mammoth Lakes.''

   Presidential Airways Inc., which filed for

is discontinuing all its flights.
   ``Our Chapter 11 filing has resulted in a reduction in our
passenger loads,'' president and chief executive officer Harold J.

   ``At this point it is prudent for the company to conserve as
much of its cash as possible. We will review our options for the

   The service was discontinued effective Monday.
   Presidential began four years ago as a mid-size carrier,
switched to a charter service and then to a feeder service for
Continental Airlines, which then maintained a hub at Washington
Dulles International Airport at Herndon.
   However, Houston-based Continental closed its Washington hub,
and in January 1988 Presidential became a feeder for United. It
recently had been operating 24 flights a day to and from six cities.
   According to court documents, Presidential had $30 million in
assets and $76 million in liabilities as of June 30. Its largest
creditor, British Aerospace PLC, is owed about $26 million for
aircraft, the documents said.

<TEXT>
   At Army &amp; Lou's, one of the nation's most elegant
purveyors of black American cuisine, the owner is working to lower
cholesterol _ showing that soul food doesn't have to be hard on the
heart.
   ``A lot of people cannot imagine soul food without using lard,
heavy fat and grease, but people are very health-conscious today,''
said owner Avis Piper, who supervises the kitchen and occasionally
helps cook.
   ``We're making a statement that soul food doesn't have to have
fat, or oil or cholesterol to be soul food and to be healthy food.''
   On a recent Saturday night, patrons at the 200-seat restaurant
included many of Chicago's leading black officials: a U.S.
congressman, the county prosecutor and four state lawmakers.
   The South Side business also is frequented by black and white
celebrities such as Bill Cosby and the cast of his TV family, the
Rev. Jesse Jackson and U.S. Sen. Paul Simon.
   The menu, with more than 100 items, runs the gamut from
black-eyed peas and ham hocks at $7 to filet mignon and lobster
tails at $35.
   The meats mostly are lean. Vegetables are steamed rather than
fried or boiled. Entries like the sweet-potato pie and salmon
croquettes are cholesterol-free.
   No salt, artificial flavorings or additives are used, and
vegetable shortening is substituted for lard in cooking.
   Mrs. Piper says the low-cholesterol dishes offer some customers
more of a choice. Dempsey Travis, a prominent black real estate
developer and writer, is one who's hooked.
   ``There are certain things like catfish I wouldn't eat, but now
I find it highly desirable and delicate,'' said Travis, who eats at
the restaurant at least twice a week. ``It's just the kind of place
you're proud to take a person,'' he said.
   The restaurant was founded in 1945 by William Armstrong, whose
nickname was Army, and his wife Luvilla, known as Lou. The two ran
it for 28 years before selling to another couple.
   Mrs. Piper, a former public school teacher and interior
designer, and her husband, Benjamin, an accountant, were regular
patrons before buying the restaurant 15 months ago.
   Mrs. Piper, who had been an amateur gourmet cook, says she hopes
the restaurant will help set a trend toward healthier soul food.
   Dr. Linda Van Horn, a registered dietician at the Northwestern
University Medical School, says that's a welcome change.
   ``It's well-known that the black population has a higher risk
for heart disease, stroke, hypertension and diabetes than the white
population because of diet and other factors,'' she said.
   ``Hopefully, the risks can be reduced without altering the
flavor that people love,'' she said.

   Seven jurors had been seated Monday in the second-degree

when Mellen T. Benedict made his statement to prosecutor Andy
Dempster, according to court officials.
   Asked by Dempster if he could judge the case on evidence from
the witness stand, Benedict responded that it was his professional

   Benedict is listed in the telephone book as a ``metaphysical
expert and professional psychic.''
   Ray Vallery, representing Alford, said the defense couldn't
proceed if any of the jurors believed what Benedict said.
   ``I didn't hear anyone laughing in the courtroom when he said
it,'' Vallery said.
   Alford and McNeil are accused of a 1988 burglary. The trial was

   A space shuttle returning to Earth set off
sonic booms that shook the ground under Los Angeles, showing city
skyscrapers may be more vulnerable to earthquakes than previously
believed, researchers say.
   ``It means that during an earthquake, the buildings may sway
more than had been expected because of the sediments in the Los
Angeles Basin,'' said U.S. Geological seismologist Jim Mori, a
co-author of the study by scientists from the USGS and the
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
   The shuttle-induced ground motion, which never had been noticed
until Columbia descended Aug. 13, was discussed Monday at the
American Geophysical Union's fall meeting by Caltech geophysics
professor Hiroo Kanamori, chief author of the study.
   ``Engineers say we don't need to worry about it, but I'm not so
sure,'' Kanamori said. ``It's time to really think about this
problem more carefully and more seriously.''
   ``While these results certainly call for close study, I don't
believe there's any cause for alarm,'' said Caltech civil engineer
James L. Beck.
   Kanamori, Mori and their colleagues found that the shuttle's
characteristic twin sonic booms thumped 400 high-rise buildings in
downtown Los Angeles and the nearby Wilshire district when Columbia
swept northeast over the city at 2,600 mph before landing at
Edwards Air Force Base. The base is about 80 miles north of Los
Angeles.
   The early morning booms prompted dozens of alarmed calls to
police. The shuttle was returning from a five-day mission to deploy
a spy satellite.
   The thumps against the buildings were transmitted down to the
soft sediment of the Los Angeles Basin, triggering seismic waves
that reached Caltech instruments 12.5 seconds before the sonic
booms were heard there. That's because waves move more quickly
through rock than through air.
   The scientists learned from the data that the soft,
1.25-mile-deep sediment beneath Los Angeles amplifies the effects
of slow, swaying ``long-period'' quake waves with a period _ or
time between wave crests _ of 2 to 3 seconds. Short-period waves
cause sharp jolts.
   Buildings 20 to 30 stories tall tend to sway back and forth once
every 2 to 3 seconds, making it possible that ``in an earthquake,
the Los Angeles basin would preferentially amplify ground motion
... giving 20- to 30-story buildings more shaking than if they were
founded on (solid) rock,'' Caltech said in a news release.
   Kanamori and Mori estimated buildings on the sediment would
shake three to five times worse than those on solid rock. That's
less severe than the tenfold and greater amplification of shaking
during the great quakes of 1985 in Mexico City, which rests on an
old lake bed.
   Henry Koza, a structural engineer at EQE Engineering in Los
Angeles, said skyscrapers ``are designed and built to pretty strict
criteria. ... There's so much inherent flexibility in high rises
they can accommodate significant motion.''
   ``I don't think those buildings are going to fall down,'' said
Egill Hauksson, a University of Southern California seismologist.
``Probably the engineers are right in that they have designed these
buildings with some overestimates of what the shaking might be to
make sure the buildings are safe.''
   But Kanamori said: ``My feeling is these effects have not been
really evaluated very carefully and very quantitatively.''
   Robert Harder, assistant chief of the city's Building Bureau,
said the city requires buildings taller than 160 feet to be
designed using computer-simulated quakes to test loads, stresses
and swaying.
   ``We feel our requirements in the city are adequate. They go way
beyond what other agencies have required,'' Harder said.
   Scientists for years have said a magnitude-6.5 quake in or near
Los Angeles would be as bad or worse than the much-feared,
magnitude-8 ``big one'' on the more distant San Andreas Fault.
   Kanamori and Mori conducted the study with Caltech geophysicist
Don Anderson, and USGS seismologists Tom Heaton and Lucile Jones.

some type of detonator between bags of gunpowder in one of the

   The fog-shrouded streets were
empty, unpounded this day by the hundreds of thousands who had
successfully pressed the ruling Communists to abandon one-party
rule.
   Only tourists, pub crawlers and window shoppers, bundled against
the damp cold, strolled past the Christmas displays on downtown
streets Sunday, when authorities announced a coalition Cabinet
still dominated by Communists.
   Most Czechs and Slovaks were at home, and when the announcement
came many were watching on television a tennis match or a concert
in Prague's Sports Stadium that benefited the opposition coalition
Civic Forum.
   Before 20,000 people at the stadium, a rock band turned up its
amplifiers to blast out its angry response to the government: a
spirited rendition of the Rolling Stones song, ``(I Can't Get No)
Satisfaction.''
   The crowd roared in approval, a harbinger of the massive
anti-government demonstrations that resumed Monday.
   Few people on the streets Sunday or in the smoky cafes and bars
were impressed by the government move, and others strolled on
unaware.
   Life around the Hradcany Castle went on as usual, with parents
out for the afternoon, their kids stopping to gawk at the
ceremonial guard outside the presidential residence. Only the odd
leaflet glued to a doorway, or a dab of colorful graffito, recalled
two weeks of unprecedented public protest.
   In the magnificent Old Town square, a large group of American
tourists _ guidebooks in hand _ seemed more interested in the
Middle Ages than the peaceful revolution at hand. One woman, on
learning that an American passer-by was a journalist, asked: ``Oh,
why are you here?''
   At Slavia, an elegant old cafe across from the National Theater,
a blend of Prague's golden youth and its punk culture ate up all
the ice cream by 10 p.m. Their talk of politics was leavened by
peals of laughter.
   After the government announcement, scores of pro-democracy
activists gathered at the Civic Forum headquarters to plan strategy.
   Outside the Laterna Magika theater, hundreds stood shivering to
watch videotaped opposition statements from televisions set up in
upper floor windows.
   In the early evening, opposition leaders denounced the
Communist-dominated Cabinet on national television and called for a
general strike if a new government more to their liking is not
seated.
   On another channel, West Germany's Boris Becker and Sweden's
Stefan Edberg were locked in a bitter second set in the finals of
the Masters tennis tournament from New York.

of America, employed by Nynex subsidiary New York Telephone, and
20,000 members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers, at New England Telephone, affected 10 million customers.
   It began Aug. 6 and was the last of four regional phone company
strikes to be resolved. The IBEW and New England Telephone did not
settle until Nov. 20. The CWA ratified its contract Friday.
   New York Telephone said it was trying to fill more than 100,000
service orders and a potential backlog of another 150,000
installations with customers who withheld orders during the work
stoppage.
   Filling those orders will take until May, the company said.
Repair work, it said, is up to date.
   During the strike, some 10,000 managers filled in for striking
workers. One striker was killed in a strike-related car accident,
and Nynex claimed hundreds of acts of sabotage were made against
its property.
   A major sticking point was a proposal by the company that
workers share the cost of health care. Nynex conceded this point in
exchange for reduced wage increases.

   The USS Iowa sails into port this week with
the controversy over an explosion that killed 47 sailors no more
settled than when the battleship set sail six months ago.
   The Iowa was in the Mediterranean when the Navy released a
report saying a disgruntled gunner's mate, who died in the April 19
blast, sabotaged one of the warship's massive 16-inch guns.
   But the Navy report has been widely criticized by relatives of
the victims and military watchdog groups, and intensely scrutinized
by Congress.
   The House Armed Services subcommittee is holding hearings on the
report next week, and the Senate Armed Services Committee next week
will get testimony from Capt. Fred P. Moosally, the Iowa's
commander. The General Accounting Office is reviewing the Navy's
findings.
   The Iowa is due in port later this week, probably Thursday,
according to officials.
   The Navy said the explosion was most probably caused by an
intentional act and ``the most likely person with the access,
knowledge and possible motivation to accomplish this act has been
identified as Gunner's Mate 2nd Class Clayton Hartwig.''
   The Navy said the 24-year-old Hartwig, of Cleveland, was
suicidal and that he placed a detonating device between sacks of
gun propellant in the middle gun of the three-gun turret and
triggered the device.
   ``I think that conclusion must be in the `Guiness Book of World
Records' for the longest standing leap from conjecture to an
unsupportable conclusion,'' said retired Rear Adm. Eugene Carroll,
executive director of the Center of Defense Information in
Washington, D.C., and a frequent Navy critic.
   Kreig Brusnahan, a Cleveland attorney representing Hartwig's
family, said congressional hearings will show incompetency and bias
in the Navy's report.
   ``The Navy is still engaged in a coverup. ... Every action taken
is designed to find human error instead of the truth,'' said Ellis
Rubin, a Miami attorney representing Kendall Truitt, one of the
survivors of the explosion.
   Lt. Cmdr. Craig Quigley, a Navy spokesman at the Pentagon, said
the service stands behind the report as unbiased, factual and
correct.
   Both Carroll and Brusnahan point out that the Navy also
documented numerous administrative and training irregularities
aboard the battleship. The Navy concluded that none of those
deficiencies contributed to the explosion.
   Carroll said the Navy made that judgment for a self-serving
reason.
   ``My reasoning is that the big issue is, `Should we have an
Iowa?' Should we spend the money and men to operate a 45-year-old
ship with obsolete equipment, equipment that has failed in the
past? They diverted attention away from the question of the Iowa,''
he said.
   Critics also pointed to tests done by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation that found no trace of a detonating device. The Navy
said its experts and equipment were superior to the FBI's.
   Sailors' families were upset by leaks from the Navy during a
Naval Investigative Service probe into Hartwig's background. The
leaked reports claimed that a lapsed relationship between Hartwig
and another gunner's mate, Kendall Truitt, motivated Hartwig in his
suicidal tendencies. The final Navy report said there was no
substance to the allegations about the relationship.
   ``The way I see the investigation, the Navy took 20 days to
determine it was not an accident, then spent the rest of their time
to build their case against Clay,'' said Nancy Lewis, whose
23-year-old son Richard died in the explosion. ``I don't believe
Clayton did this.''

   With his wife showing signs of progress after
the world's first heart, liver and kidney transplant, John Martin
was on the telephone in a delicate conversation. On the line was
the husband of the donor.
   The talk was brief, said Dimitri Mavris, whose wife, 26-year-old
Auli, died from injuries suffered in a freak automobile accident.
Auli Mavris' organs were transplanted into 26-year-old Cindy Martin
in Pittsburgh on Monday.
   ``He said, `You have given us a great gift,' and I said, `She
would have wanted it that way. Our prayers are with you and your
wife,''' Mavris said.
   Mrs. Mavris was killed after being struck by a car driven by a
neighbor in a parking lot by her apartment in Atlanta, when she was
taking a load of trash to a bin.
   Mrs. Martin remained in critical condition, considered normal
after transplant surgery, in Presbyterian-University Hospital's
intensive care unit. Doctors said Monday they were encouraged by
her progress and planned to wean her from a respirator. They said
infection had become her greatest risk.
   ``Hopefully, she will go home in three or four weeks,'' said Dr.
John Armitage, who performed the heart transplant. ``Right now her
organ function looks encouraging. She's awake and writing us
notes.''
   Although multi-organ transplants have been done before, this was
the first involving the heart, liver and a kidney, Armitage said.
   Three other people have received combination heart-liver
transplants, but only Stormie Jones, a 12-year-old Texas girl who
received her new organs in February 1984, has survived the
procedure.
   The 21{-hour operation, which ended at 5 p.m. Sunday, was broken
into three parts, with the heart transplanted first, the liver
second and the kidney last.
   ``Her greatest need was for improved circulation and treatment
of her failed heart. That was addressed first,'' Armitage said.
``Her kidneys, although bad, were the least of her multi-organ
system failure.''
   In Chicago, the recipient of the nation's first living-donor
liver transplant, 22-month-old Alyssa Smith, was in serious but
stable condition, University of Chicago Hospitals spokeswoman Mary
Fetsch said today. Doctors are pleased with her progress eight days
after the procedure, the spokeswoman said. She has been moved out
of intensive care to a private room and shows no signs of rejecting
the liver.
   Her mother, Teresa, who donated a piece of her liver for the
operation, was in good condition and expected to be released from
the hospital this week, Ms. Fetsch said.
   Mrs. Martin suffers from familial cardiomyopathy, an inherited
heart disease. Her father died when he was 31 and many relatives on
his side of the family have died young, Martin said.
   On Oct. 20, 1985, one day after the couple were married, Mrs.
Martin was admitted to Presbyterian-University Hospital to await
her first heart transplant. She received it Nov. 6.
   Since then, she has suffered from chronic rejection of the heart
and developed hepatits and kidney dysfunction.
   Martin, 28, said at a news conference that he's been telling his
wife ``to hang in there and hope that our lives are finally going
to turn around.''
   Mrs. Martin had to give up her secretarial job and has spent
most of her time at home in Archbald doing only light household
chores, because she tired easily and developed several infections,
said her husband, a manufacturing engineer.
   Armitage said ethical questions of retransplantation, despite
the shortage of donor organs, ``was not a major consideration'' in
Mrs. Martin's case.
   ``She is a very young patient,'' he said. ``We were very
committed to her.''

<DATELINE>FORT BENNING, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army is searching for an automatic
rifle to replace the M-16, which soldiers have used since the
Vietnam war.
   The goal is to develop a weapon that will make the 21st century
soldier twice as effective at wounding or killing enemy troops,
overcoming battlefield stress and unpredictable targets.
   ``The M16A2 is the finest combat rifle in the world, but the
accuracy of that weapon because of human factors is not as high as
one would like it to be,'' said Pete Rowland, public affairs
officer for the Army's Armament Research, Development and
Engineering Center at Picatinny Arsenal, N.J.
   Since September, 36 Army and Air Force shooters have been
conducting preliminary tests with four advanced combat rifle
prototypes at Fort Benning.
   The Army has spent about $40 million since 1982 on research and
development and expects to spend another $17 million by 1991, when
officials decide what technology to pursue.
   The prototypes were submitted by Colt Industries of Hartford,
Conn.; Steyr-Daimler-Puch of Steyr, Austria; AAI Corp. of Hunt
Valley, Md.; and Heckler &amp; Koch, a German firm with a U.S.
subsidiary in Chantilly, Va.
   The Colt rifle fires conventional ammunition or a duplex
cartridge with two projectiles. Colt claims one projectile travels
to the point of aim and the other diverges slightly to increase hit
probability.
   The Steyr uses a plastic-cased cartridge that fires a steel
flechette, or dart. The AAI rifle fires a brass cartridge with a
flechette and the Heckler &amp; Koch a bullet from a ``caseless
cartridge'' made of molded propellant.
   Rowland said the Army is trying to develop a rifle that fires
lightweight, low-cost ammunition.
   ``The soldier of today ... is weightily equipped,'' he said.
``Anything that can be done to make that lighter _ and a lot is
being done _ will increase his effectiveness. Probably from head to
foot, the Army is looking for a way to lighten the load.''
   The M-16 already is lighter than the Soviet-designed AK-47, but
that assault rifle has the reputation of being more durable on the
dirty battlefield than the M-16. The M-16 typically takes smaller
ammunition than the AK and most other assault rifles.
   In battle, the soldier's shooting skills are hampered by a
variety of factors, such as stress, fatigue, weather conditions and
obscured targets, Rowland noted.
   ``The goal is to develop some compensations in the weapon to
offset the outside factors that affect a soldier in battle,'' he
added. ``The soldier ... has to have twice the accuracy that he has
with the current version.''
   Earlier this year, the Army conducted extensive engineering and
safety tests on the prototypes at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md.
   The Army has scheduled a media briefing and demonstration of the
weapons Dec. 13 at Fort Benning. In January, another team of Army
and Air Force shooters will arrive at Benning to begin another
three months of testing.
   Bill Harris, a media relations specialist at Picatinny Arsenal,
said there is no timetable for phasing out the M-16.
   ``Since the M-16 is over 20 years old now, the Defense
Department has decided to look at new technology,'' he said. ``The
average life of a military rifle is 20 to 30 years, going back to
the flintlocks used in the Revolutionary War. If we find a
technology that meets the needs of doubling the effectiveness of
the M-16, then ... we could have a new weapon in the hands of
troops as early as 1995.''
   The M-16 was first issued to U.S. troops in 1967. During the
Vietnam war it was criticized for jamming. The problem was
corrected by using a different type of gunpower in the rifle's
5.56-mm ammunition. The latest version, known as the M-16A2, was
introduced in 1987. It has a maximum effective range of 550 meters
and is more accurate and reliable than the earlier versions, Harris
said.
   ``The M-16 is a very reliable weapon,'' he added. ``It's
considered one of the best combat rifles in the world.''

<TEXT>
   The only newspaper of the Amish and
Mennonites is owned by a Jewish family, edited by a Lutheran and
has its readers double as unpaid reporters.
   Butter churning, recipes and buggy accidents are among the
subjects that fill the pages of The Budget, which is gearing up for
its 100th anniversary as what may be the most widely circulated
small-town newspaper in the country.
   George Smith, 82, has worked at the newspaper in this Tuscarawas
County village of 2,000 in eastern Ohio since his father bought the
paper in 1920. There are no Amish and two Mennonites on the staff.
   ``One problem with Amish girls is they work a couple of years
then get married,'' said Smith. As for the Amish men: ``It's not
their kind of work.''
   Smith supervises the 600 or so ``scribes'' who send in
handwritten items of parochial interest from Amish and Mennonite
settlements in such places as Charm, Ohio; Macon, Miss.; Sarasota,
Fla.; and Intercourse, Pa. Smith, whose title is associate editor _
although there is no editor _ also lays out the pages.
   Smith, who became editor and publisher in 1936, sold the paper
to two employees in 1974. When they left, Albert Spector of Wooster
bought the paper in 1981.
   Spector, who is Jewish, owns Spector's stores, a major
advertiser in The Budget and supplier of dry goods to the Amish and
Mennonites.
   Every week the paper receives as many as 400 letters from the
scattered communities describing births, marriages, buggy accidents
and the weather.
   There are two editions, one serving Sugarcreek and surrounding
areas and the national edition, which carries more than 300 letters
from Plain People settlements in the lower 48 states and more than
a dozen foreign countries.
   A special 100th anniversary edition will be sent to The Budget's
18,000 subscribers in May. Smith is planning a summer party for all
his correspondents.
   Smith said he edits the letters for spelling, punctuation and
clarity, but ``we like to keep the flavor.''
   For instance, an Amish from Stockport, Ohio, had this
butter-churning tale: ``Floyd Beechy rigged a plastic crate on the
center of the buggy wheel. In this he fastened a plastic jug of
cream. As he or the Mrs. had to drive the scholars to school every
day, this saved churning at home. Now they have 2 girls at home and
probably don't churn anymore.''
   From Guys Mills, Pa.: ``James A. Miller is laid up with a torn
ligament in back of his leg and internal bleeding. This happened
while chasing heifers.''
   And from Jamesport, Mo.: ``It seems the postal service is
getting slack again. For quite awhile we received The Budget on
Sat., but lately it doesn't come till Mon.''
   Reports of violent crime are rare because occurrences are rare,
Smith said.
   ``We try to avoid anything about crime. We don't feel it has a
place in The Budget ... unless it really directly involves the
Amish.''
   The paper has grown from four pages to 30 or more since its
first edition and production has been modernized. The Budget is now
on its third computer system, complete with laser printer, and some
Mennonite letters arrive by fax.
   The Budget scribes are not paid. But good writers receive
stamped envelopes to mail in stories. If they're really good, they
get free subscriptions.
   There are no photographs in the national edition, as the Amish
shun having their pictures taken. Recipes as well as display and
classified ads are included.
   Surgarcreek is surrounded by the largest settlement of Amish in
the world, with 20,000 to 25,000 living in Holmes, Wayne, Coshoctan
and Tuscarawas counties in Ohio. About 100,000 Amish people live in
the United States. Figures on the Mennonite population were
unavailable.

<HEAD>Government To Ban Tobacco Ads In Print Media</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Dollar amounts U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Government today said it
plans to outlaw cigarette advertising in the print media in an
attempt to slash the $2 billion a year spent on health care for
smokers.
   ``It reflects the concern that tobacco consumption is the major
preventable cause of illness in the Australian community today,''
Health Minister Neal Blewett said in announcing the decision.
   ``The Government has a clear responsibility to act to discourage
Australians from smoking and particularly to reduce pressures on
young people to take up smoking.''
   Advertising of tobacco products has been banned in the
electronic media since 1976.
   Blewett said the government would amend the Smoking and Tobacco
Products Advertisements Bill to legislate the ban on advertising in
newspapers and magazines.
   He said there was sufficient evidence of a link between tobacco
advertising and the taking up of smoking to justify the
government's decision on strong public health grounds.
   ``Although advertising is not the only determinant in people's
decision to smoke, research has established that it does affect and
reinforce other influences such as peer and social pressures,''
Blewett said.
   The ban will bring Australia into line with many other countries
that have outlawed tobacco advertising, including Canada, Norway,
Finland, Italy, Portugal, Singapore and Iceland.
   Blewett noted that research in Norway had shown ``substantial
falls'' in smoking among adolescents since a ban took effect in
that country in 1975.
   Sports Minister Graham Richardson said earlier he opposed a
total ban on tobacco advertising because some sports relied heavily
on tobacco sponsorship.
   He said that sport received about $16 million a year from
tobacco companies in Australia and that replacement sponsorships of
that size would be difficult.

<HEAD>Report: Police Satisfied With Handling of Mayor's Drug Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The District of Columbia police department has
concluded its officers acted properly in handling allegations that
Mayor Marion Barry was hospitalized for a drug overdose six years
ago, a newspaper reported today.
   Police Chief Isaac Fulwood believes the department and
then-chief Maurice Turner were right to drop the matter after the
allegation could not be corroborated, sources told The Washington
Post.
   A Howard University psychiatrist reportedly told police
investigators in 1984 that the mayor suffered from a drug overdose
in 1983.
   Barry, in an effort Monday to quell the overdose allegations,
let reporters review 154 pages of medical records. But the records
were withdrawn after an hour and many reporters complained it was
impossible to draw conclusions from them.
   Barry's spokeswoman said the records were released to
substantiate the mayor's statements that he suffered from a hiatal
hernia in 1983 and not a cocaine overdose.
   The records indicated that doctors diagnosed Barry's illness as
a hiatal hernia, an abnormality of the digestive tract that can
cause symptoms similar to those of a heart attack.
   None of the records showed that Barry was tested for the
presence of cocaine or that illegal drugs caused his
hospitalization.
   Medical experts told the Post the symptoms identified in Barry's
records were consistent with several illnesses, including a hiatal
hernia, heart disease and a cocaine overdose.

<TEXT>
   A woman who was subjected as a child to Josef
Mengele's notorious experiments on twins said the Nazi medical data
gathered from her suffering should never be used in scientific
research.
   Eva Mozes Kor told her story Monday at a Boston University
conference on Nazi doctors and parallels in modern medicine. Some
in the audience of about 300 people weeped and when she finished
many stood and cheered her.
   ``I'm hurt by scientists who say we should use Nazi data,'' Kor
said. ``I feel the victims have paid with lifelong suffering.''
   ``No one should benefit from brutal crimes,'' said Kor, a
Hungarian Jew and president of CANDLES, which stands for Children
of Auschwitz Nazi Deadly Lab Experiments.
   Some biomedical ethicists contend that the issue is moot,
because Nazi research already has been cited in American and
British journals. They argue that the data, despite its source,
have the potential to save human life.
   Benjamin Freedman, an associate professor at the McGill Center
for Medicine, Ethics and Law, was scheduled today to present a
defense of using data from Nazi experiments.
   Kor's recollection of her experiences at the Auschwitz-Birkenau
concentration camp in occupied Poland during World War II was one
of the most dramatic at the symposium.
   The 54-year-old Terre Haute, Ind., resident said the trauma of
the camps has never left her. In 1987, she donated a kidney to her
identical twin sister, Miriam, whose kidneys seriously deteriorated
over the years as a result of near-deadly injections given them in
the camps.
   They were nine years old when taken prisoner.
   Kor, her parents, two older sisters and her twin, arrived by
packed train at Auschwitz in April 1944. She remembers her mother
clutching her hand and her sister's hand when they were shoved off
the train onto a platform. Her father and two older sisters
disappeared into the crowd and were never heard from again.
   Kor said a member of the SS yelled in German for twins and
pulled her and her sister in one direction on the platform. Kor
looked back and saw her mother being dragged away, arms
outstretched toward the twins and crying.
   The sisters were taken to the special barracks for twin girls,
aged 18 months to 12 years where they began a grim routine that
lasted until the camp was liberated on Jan. 27, 1945. About 3,600
twins were tested at the camp.
   ``Nothing on earth can prepare you for Auschwitz,'' said Kor.
``It is hell on earth.''
   Three days a week, for nine hours at a time, Kor and her sister
stood naked with a dozen other sets of twins in a laboratory where
Nazi doctors prodded, poked and examined them in every detail.
   Three times a week, the twins were taken to another laboratory
where blood samples were taken from Kor's right arm and her left
arm was injected with germs and chemicals.
   Kor became very sick after one injection and was taken to a
barrack for the dying. While lying sick, Kor was not given any
medication, food or water. Once Kor heard Mengele say, ``Too bad,
she's so young, she only has two weeks to live.''
   She made a pledge to survive. Later she discovered that the
doctors carefully monitored her sister during the same period.
Their goal, she said, was to wait until Kor died, then give her
sister a fatal injection and conduct comparative autopsies.
   It was not until 1979 that Kor and her sister were able to
discuss what happened to them during their 10 months in the camp.
Her sister now lives in Israel.
   ``The emotional scars were so deep that we're only now coming to
terms with them,'' Kor said.

   The House ethics committee has subpoenaed
former prostitute Stephen Gobie to testify this week at a closed
hearing about his relationship with Rep. Barney Frank, according to
a report published today.
   The Washington Times reported that the subpoena was secretly
authorized by two members of the 12-person ethics panel and was
served last week on Gobie at his Washington area home by two U.S.
marshals.
   The Times, quoting unnamed congressional and law enforcement
officials, said the subpoena required Gobie to bring records and
other documents to verify his relationship with Frank, a
Massachusetts Democrat. The closed-door hearing is scheduled for
Wednesday, the newspaper said.
   One of Congress' leading liberals, Frank had acknowledged he is
homosexual well before the recent publicity.
   Frank has admitted paying Gobie $80 for sex in 1985 and
subsequently hiring him with personal funds to serve as a
housekeeper and driver from July 1985 through August 1987.
   Gobie has leveled various charges against Frank that the
congressman has denied. Among those are that Frank knew Gobie was
running a prostitution ring from Frank's Capitol Hill apartment and
that Gobie and Frank engaged in sexual activity at the House
gymnasium.

<TEXT>
   The state banned the sale or manufacture
of eight handguns and at least 100 others also will be prohibited
because their manufacturers did not submit them for approval,
officials said.
   The Maryland Handgun Roster Board, a nine-member panel, has been
working for about a year to compile a list of handguns that meet
the criteria of a law passed last year aimed at banning so-called
Saturday Night Specials _ the cheap, small, low-caliber weapons
popular among criminals.
   ``Some people said this law would ban all guns in the state of
Maryland, but that has not occurred,'' State Police chief Elmer
Tippett said Monday. ``We banned some today and we approved a large
number.''
   Weapons makers were asked to submit their guns for the board's
approval. Tippett, who headed the panel, estimated that at least
100 guns were not considered because manufacturers failed to submit
them.
   ``I believe Maryland will be a safer place to live because we
have taken the time to consider these guns and their use,'' Gov.
William Donald Schaefer said.
   The board judged the quality of manufacture, concealability,
weight, size, safety features and intended use. The ban goes into
effect Jan. 1, though manufacturers who did not submit their guns
to the board may do so at a later date. The list of legal guns
includes more than 600 weapons.
   ``Despite the National Rifle Assocation's cries of wolf, we can
all clearly see that law-abiding citizens in Maryland will still be
able to purchase legitimate handguns,'' said Sarah Brady, wife of
former White House press secretary James Brady, who was shot and
severely wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt against former
President Reagan.
   Mrs. Brady is chairwoman of Handgun Control Inc., a national
group that lobbied for passage of the state law.
   Rafael Fiol, chairman of the state National Rifle Association,
said he disapproved of the board's work.
   ``I don't think there should be any restriction on law-abiding
citizens owning guns,'' he said.
   Manufacturers who violate the law can be fined up to $10,000 per
gun and dealers who sell banned guns could be fined up to $2,500
per gun sold and could lose their license.
   Among the 100 or more weapons banned because their makers did
not submit them were three of the five guns considered the most
popular by criminals, according to statistics from the federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   The three guns are the MP-25, a .25-caliber semi-automatic
pistol made by Raven Arms in California, the J22, a semi-automatic
pistol manufactured by Jennings Firearms of California, and the
TEC-9, a 9mm assault pistol made by the Florida manufacturer
Intratec.
   The eight handguns considered and banned by the roster board
included The American Derringer Corp.'s Model 1 .44 Magnum and
Model 11 .38 Special; the Lorcin .25 caliber semi-automatic model
L-25; Seecamp's LWS .32 and .25, Precision Small Parts PSP-25 and
Freedom Arms' .22 Long Rifle Mini Revolver and .22 Magnum Mini
Revolver.

   Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci said she will stay
with friends in southern Florida and has no plans to work with her
Romanian coach or with the U.S. Gymnastics Federation.
   Officials of the federation had flown to New York in hopes of
contacting Comaneci and setting up a meeting between the former
Olympic champion and her former coach, Bela Karolyi, who defected
earlier and now lives in Houston.
   But Comaneci said Monday she would not be working with the
federation, adding forcefully, ``I have no business with my former
coach.''
   Comaneci, 28, left Romania a week ago, enduring a six-hour
nighttime trek over rough terrain to reach the Hungarian border.
She arrived in New York City on Friday and Monday flew to Miami.
   She left the plane on the arm of Constantin Panit, a fellow
Romanian exile who aided in her defection and lives with his wife,
Maria, in Hallandale.
   Panit said the two had been friends in Romania.
   Representatives from the State Department greeted the two at
Miami International Airport and quickly ushered them to a waiting
car.
   Some news reports had said Comaneci would go to Indianapolis,
where the federation is located, or Houston, where Karolyi lives.
But she said her immedate plans were to relax with Panit and his
family, who belong to a community of Romanian exiles in southern
Florida.
   ``I came here a few years ago and I liked it,'' Comaneci said.
   Comaneci arrived in New York City on Friday after fleeing
Romania through Hungary and Austria. She held a brief news
conference then, but since has stayed out of the public eye _
despite a brief shopping spree at Macy's, she said.
   Comaneci gained worldwide fame at age 14 when she became the
first gymnast ever to receive a perfect score of 10 in the
Olympics, an achievement she repeated seven times during the 1976
Games at Montreal.

   A fuel barge exploded in the Houston Ship
Channel, injuring one man and leaving another missing, authorities
said.
   The injured man was transported to a local hospital suffering
from burns after the explosion Monday afternoon, said Cpl. Rodney
Tooley with the Harris County Sheriff's Department. He was in
guarded but stable condition Monday night at Hermann Hospital.
   The search for the missing man was called off later because of
darkness. Coast Guard officials were not sure if the search would
resume today.
   Houston Fire Department boats and a sheriff's marine division
boat helped douse the fire on the barge. The initial explosion sent
up thick black smoke that was visible from downtown Houston, about
20 miles away.
   U.S. Coast Guard officials said the injured and missing men were
part of a crew cleaning the barge, which had been carrying a form
of natural gas when the explosion occurred.

<BYLINE>Rain Turns to Snow in Pacific Northwest ^By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain was turning to snow today in the wind-lashed Pacific
Northwest as cold lashed much of the eastern part of the country.
   Strong winds pounded the eastern slopes of Montana's Rockies
with gusts of up to 64 mph at Livingston, Mont. Up to a foot of
snow was forecast for western Montana.
   A cold front brought steady rain in the northern Pacific Coast
region Monday afternoon. Rainshowers extended across the Northern
Plateau into the northern Rocky Mountain region.
   Temperatures were below freezing all day Monday from the Great
Lakes to the northern Atlantic Coast, with highs in the teens in
northern New England.
   Philadelphia shivered under a low of 18 Monday and a wind chill
of down to minus 25.
   Monday's low of 15 degrees recorded at Newark International
Airport was far below the normal low of 32, said Harry Woodworth, a
National Weather Service meteorologist.
   ``You don't need any detailed descriptions of it out there,''
Woodworth said. ``It's cold. Period.''
   Clouds hung over much of the northern half of the nation Monday,
while sunny skies prevailed across the southern states. Snow
showers were scattered across the Great Lakes region, the Ohio
Valley and the mid-Atlantic Coast states.
   A weekend snowstorm in northern Maine left Caribou under 21
inches of fresh snow, for a total depth of 30 inches, and high wind
caused widespread drifting.
   The strong winds east of the Rockies helped temperatures warm
into the 50s and lower 60s in Montana on Monday. Brisk southwest
winds warmed readings into the 60s across the central Plains region
with 60s and lower 70s in the southern Plains.
   Mild weather prevailed across the West. The mercury rose to the
50s and lower 60s along the northern Pacific Coast and temperatures
warmed into the 70s and lower 80s in Southern California.
   Monday's high in the nation was 83 degrees at Woodland Hills,
Cal.
   The low was 20 degrees below zero at Watertown, N.Y.

<HEAD>Judge Gives Drug Addict Two Years in Monastery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEESBURG, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has ruled that a longtime heroin
user can spend two years in a Zen Buddhist monastery in New York
rather than the five years in prison he was sentenced to earlier
this year.
   Loudoun County Circuit Judge James H. Chamblin, who issued the
ruling Monday, said Keith Brian Scofield's jail term would be
retained until he completes the two-year program at a monastery in
Sullivan County, N.Y., in the Catskills Mountains.
   Scofield, 30, described himself as a drug addict desperate to
fill a ``spiritual void'' in his life.
   The Sterling, Va., resident was arrested for possession of
heroin in August 1987, convicted in November 1988 and released on
probation. After a June 1989 arrest on a minor charge, Chamblin
gave him the five-year sentence.
   Acting Abbot Junpo Dennis Kelly, who will be legally responsible
for Scofield while he is at the monastery, said ``life here is very
strict,'' with the daily regimen including chants in four languages
beginning at 5 a.m.
   Scofield told The Washington Post he has entered five drug
rehabilitation programs, completed three and feared he would
relapse back ``to the same meaninglessness'' and addiction without
a highly structured program of spiritual therapy. ``This is not
something I'm doing to dodge time,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A dispute about liability insurance that kept a $1
million, state-of-the-art bomb detector sitting in a crate at the
Miami airport has been resolved with the manufacturer agreeing to
absorb the cost.
   Pan American World Airways had worried that the thermal neutron
analysis device _ only the second of its kind _ could leak
radiation, spawning costly lawsuits.
   ``We have reached an agreement but I'm not going to be specific
to what the agreement entails,'' Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon
said Monday. ``It does provide the protection that we felt we
needed _ the liability insurance.''
   The machine can detect plastic explosives in checked baggage.
Current X-ray equipment is incapable of sensing bombs like the one
believed to have downed a Pan Am jumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotand
in December 1988, killing 270 people.
   The FAA bought the new device and delivered it in August to
Miami International Airport for Pan Am's use. The agency has
mandated installation of the machines in 40 high-risk airports
around the world.
   Trans World Airlines made no complaint when the first machine
was installed at its terminal at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport
in September, said Monte Begler, associate administrator of the
Federal Aviation Administration.
   Pan Am's reaction was unexpected, he said, and ``I'd be less
than candid if I didn't say I was disappointed.''
   The manufacturer said the airline's concerns were groundless.
   ``There is no risk,'' said Hadi Bozorgmanesh, vice president of
Science Applications International Corp. of San Diego. ``If there
were, we wouldn't have gotten a license from the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.''
   But Bozorgmanesh confirmed that his company and Pan Am reached
an agreement wherein SAIC would assume all liability.
   ``We are prepared to immediately go ahead and do the
installation as soon as we get the go-ahead from FAA,''
Bozorgmanesh said.
   It will take about three weeks, including installation and
testing, before the device is ready for use, he said.
   Families of victims of the Scotland crash are angered by what
they see as Pan Am's foot-dragging, said Victoria Cummings of Coral
Gables, whose husband died in the bombing.
   ``It's appalling that this kind of thing can get caught up in
politics and profits,'' Mrs. Cummings said. ``The industry has only
its bottom-line profit in mind ... It will probably take more
people getting blown out of the sky to get the priorities changed.''
   Airline officials have questioned whether the expensive
equipment works.
   During an August speech in Miami, Pan Am Senior Vice President
Robert Gould charged that the government was forcing airlines _
which must pay for all but the first six machines _ to buy them for
political reasons.
   ``Mandating (new technology) may please a constituency, but it
doesn't enhance safety,'' Gould said. ``I don't believe it is as
effective as the public may think it is, and, therefore, we're
going to give a false impression about security.''

   An 8-year-old AIDS victim whose family
battled for 2{ years so she could attend school was laid to rest
with her Raggedy Ann doll after a procession took her casket past
the school and courthouse.
   Eliana Martinez, who died last week, was buried Monday in a
funeral full of balloons, songs, praise and memories of the fight
over her education.
   Her adoptive mother, Rosa Martinez, finally won the long court
battle, but the mentally disabled child went to school for only
three weeks this year. She grew too ill to continue.
   ``Eliana taught us to hug and to kiss,'' Mrs. Martinez said.
``She takes a part of me with her. Her legacy is there will be
other children going to school.''
   The funeral procession wound past the Manhattan Exceptional
Center, where Mrs. Martinez released balloons; past the U.S.
Courthouse where she won her suit; and past the Hillsborough County
School Board offices where educators fought Eliana's admission to
class.
   At the gravesite, Eliana's small white casket was opened for her
mother to kiss her goodbye.
   Strands of the colorful glass beads which Eliana liked had been
placed around her neck, and her Raggedy Ann doll laid on her chest.
She was in a white dress with blue ribbons.
   During a 90-minute service at the funeral home chapel, Eliana
was remembered as a frail child who never learned to speak, yet
taught adults the language of love.
   Playing in the background was ``Everybody's Child,'' a song
composed by family friend Linda Castellano.
   Teacher Peggy Kelly told about 125 mourners that ``never have I
seen a person communicate so much with so little words. This child
had no ugliness in her at all ... she was always there for you.''
   Mrs. Martinez adopted Eliana when she was 11 months old after
hearing a radio appeal for a sickly child abandoned in a Puerto
Rico hospital.
   It wasn't until four years later that Mrs. Martinez, her husband
Joe and their son Joey learned Eliana had acquired immune
deficiency syndrome. By the time she was four months old, Eliana
had received 38 transfusions, and doctors believed she received
tainted blood.
   Education officials in Hillsborough County tried to keep Eliana
on homebound instruction, fearing the risk of transmitting AIDS to
other children. Mrs. Martinez sued, saying Eliana needed peer
contact to develop.
   A federal judge said the child could attend classes only if she
sat inside a specially-built glass booth. Mrs. Martinez appealed
that decision and won.

   Those magazine pages that reek of perfume
when opened would be banned by a state legislator who says they
threaten the health of certain sensitive types.
   ``If you think the only hazard of leafing through a magazine or
opening an envelope is a paper cut, think again,'' said Sen. Martin
Connor, a Democrat who introduced a bill requiring that pefume
samples be sealed in odor-free packaging.
   ``A majority of consumers at one time or another have received a
bill in the mail or bought a publication which was permeated by a
cosmetic or fragrance sample. This minor inconvenience for most
people could be a major nightmare for asthmatics and allergy
sufferers,'' he said.
   Perfume companies' use of fragrant samples is a ``major
assault'' on people with chemical sensitivities, said Mary
Lamielle, president of the Voorhees, N.J.-based National Center for
Environmental Strategies.
   Lamielle said 10 percent to 20 percent of the population can be
bothered to some degree by the chemicals in fragrance and cosmetics.
   A trade group that represents the cosmetics industry said the
bill is unnecessary.
   ``We know of no scientific data linking such samples to any
significant threat to the public health,'' said Michael Petrina of
the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association, in testimony for
a hearing today organized by Connor.

   Rowena Cruz stood in the doorway of
her tiny wooden shack early today and pointed to the bed where a
brother and cousin had been fast asleep just a half hour earlier.
   The bed and covers bore dark stains from the blood of the two
men, who were wounded when a 60mm mortar exploded next to the hut
shortly after dawn.
   The attack apparently came from rebels holed up in nearby
skyskcrapers during the fifth day of their coup against President
Corazon Aquino. The intended target, a battalion of loyalist
marines massing a block from the huts, was unscathed.
   The impoverished neighborhood took the full force of the mortar.
   Blood trailed from the shacks to the Makati Medical Center
across the street, where nine injured civilians were rushed for
treatment and a 6-year-old girl was declared dead on arrival.
   Inside, a young boy lay dazed on one emergency room table, blood
smeared along his legs, while a 4-year-old girl screamed in pain as
doctors disinfected a flesh wound on her back as hospital staff
looked on.
   ``Almost all of them are stable,'' Dr. Phillip Ong said of the
morning's first casualties.

   John Knight, wearing only electric-pink swimming trunks and a
Casio watch, said enough was enough. The rest of this coup would be
spent poolside at the Westin Philippine Plaza.
   ``Four days shut up in a house is too much,'' said Knight, 41,
one of hundreds of foreigners who fled their homes in rebel-held
suburb of Makati today. ``We were running out of food and the wife
and kids were getting psychologically tense.''
   Knight, of London, brought his wife, 10-year-old son and
11-year-old daughter to the Plaza to escape the firefight between
rebel and loyalist troops just blocks from their home. Several
embassies early today phoned their nationals in Makati urging them
to flee.
   Although Knight left his home early enough to book a room, the
U.S., Canadian and Japanese embassies reserved Plaza ballrooms to
shelter the hundreds of foreign residents who arrived after the
hotel filled up.
   The Plaza, overlooking Manila Bay and fully equipped with pool
(including slide), miniature golf and Mongolian barbecue, provided
a distinctly pleasant change of environment for the Makati
residents.
   ``They were firing directly underneath me in the morning,'' said
Harman Schteiden, 34, of Santa Clara, Calif., as he recounted his
decision to leave his home at 6 a.m. Now he was stretched out on a
chaise lounge, a three-day-old USA Today in hand.
   ``I just figured I was out of food, the electricity was out
because of the firing and I had no exercise for two or three days,
Schteiden said. ``I took two shirts, two pants, underwear, a
toothbrush and my shaver, and that's it.''

   Back in Makati, it was quickly apparent that the Philippine
Constabulary fighting the rebels do not dress as a team.
   Some wore regulation boots, others slippers.
   Some wore khaki, others prefer T-shirts.
   Many opted for regulation helmets, but at least one dressed for
battle in a turqouise-and-pink Miami Vice baseball cap.
   One soldier clutched his M-16 in hands covered by black woolen
gloves.
   They all affixed yellow or blue ribbons to their uniforms,
however, so they could distinguish themselves from the rebels.
   Meanwhle, some civilians refused to stop working as loyalist
soldiers took up positions along Makati's streets. As marines
crisscrossed major roads dodging sniper fire just two blocks from
rebel strongholds, vendors strolled by selling cigarettes and
balloons and blithely ignoring roadblock signs saying, ``No Entry,
War Ahead,'' ``War Zone,'' and ``Danger: Men at Fight.''

   The president of Justice Denied, a group formed to
release innocent people from prison, was in jail today on drug
charges after an FBI agent recognized his photograph in a
newspaper, officials said.
   Jim Humphreys was charged Monday with 10 counts of possession
with intent to distribute and distribution of heroin from a 1985
indictment, according to FBI spokesman Woody Specht. He was being
held in lieu of $25,000 bond, Specht said.
   The agent saw Humphreys' picture in a Dallas newspaper, from a
ceremony Saturday when Humphreys announced formation of the
organization.
   Among those attending the ceremony were Randall Dale Adams,
whose wrongful conviction for the murder of a police officer was
the subject of the documentary ``The Thin Blue Line.'' Adams was
freed earlier this year after spending 13 years in Texas prisons.
   Humphreys had served as an investigator in the case that led to
freedom for Lenell Geter, an engineer who spent two years in prison
for a robbery he didn't commit.
   Edith Neely Crosby, treasurer of Justice Denied, said she had
not heard about Humphreys' arrest, but felt it would not deter the
goals of the organization.
   ``I'm greatly surprised by it,'' she said. ``It's not going to
interfere with Justice Denied. There are too many people involved
with it and they are too dedicated to it. We will continue on.''

<HEAD>Newspaper: Scots To Seek Extradition of Flight 103 Suspect</HEAD>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scottish investigators are expected to
ask Sweden to extradite a Palestinian suspected of complicity in
the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, a newspaper reported today.
   A court in Uppsala on Monday said it had approved the seizure of
evidence from Mohammed Abu Talb's home last week because he was a
suspect in a murder case in Scotland.
   A police spokesman in Lockerbie, Scotland, refused to comment on
the court's decision, and said only that ``our inquiries are
continuing in Sweden and elsewhere.''
   The bombing over the Scottish town on Dec. 21, 1988, killed all
259 people abourt the jumbo jet and 11 on the ground.
   Relatives of British victims of the bombing said the development
could be the most significant action yet in the inquiry.
   Dr. Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora was on the plane, said: ``If
forensic confirmation is obtained of the link, it seems much the
most significant step so far. It brings nearer the point at which
the individuals responsible can be identified.''
   There has been no public suggestion that Abu Talb, a resident of
Sweden since 1983, was suspected of placing the bomb on board the
aircraft, and it was unclear whether investigators believe he had a
direct role.
   Abu Talb, 35, a former member of the radical Palestine Popular
Struggle Front, is awaiting a verdict on separate charges of murder
and attempted murder in connection with bombings in Copenhagen,
Amsterdam and Stockholm in 1985 and 1986.
   The Dagens Nyheter newspaper today said British authorities
would submit an extradition request before that verdict _ due Dec.
21 _ is announced.
   The request would prevent Abu Talb's immediate release from
detention in case he is acquitted on the other bombing charges, the
report said. He was arrested in May.
   A District Court clerk in Uppsala, 42 miles north of Stockholm,
today said no extradition request had been submitted yet.
   Legal experts said an extradition request could take several
months to process, requiring the approval of the Supreme Court and
the government.
   Abu Talb was charged with the death of one person and the
attempted murder of others in Copenhagen in an explosion outside
the office of Northwest Orient Airlines on July 22, 1985. None of
the other bombs caused casualties.
   Three other Palestinians living in Sweden also were charged in
the bombings. One was released pending the verdict after the
six-week trial ended last month, an indication that he may be
acquitted or receive a light sentence.
   Scottish and Swedish investigators raided Abu Talb's home last
week and seized 15 bags of clothing in an apparent search for a
link to clothes from the suitcase that concealed the fatal bomb.
   The clothing aboard the doomed flight came from a store in
Malta, where Abu Talb reportedly was sighted two months before the
explosion.
   Abu Talb's passport showed he was on the Mediterranean island
Oct. 19-26, 1988. Some reports said he was seen on Malta with
another Palestinian, Hafez Dalkamoni, another suspect in the case
who is in detention on other charges in West Germany.
   Abu Talb was questioned behind closed doors by the court Friday.
In its decision Monday, the court ordered a continued blackout on
all proceedings in the case.
   Jamila Mograbi, Abu Talb's common-law wife, confirmed that Abu
Talb had brought clothing from Malta in October 1988, which she
said were wholesale samples for an import business he hoped to open
in Sweden.
   Court records said Abu Talb was born in Lebanon but served in
the Egyptian army and underwent military training in the Soviet
Union. He deserted the army in 1970 and fled to Lebanon, where he
joined the Palestine Struggle Front and headed a personal security
unit.
   According to documents, Abu Talb came to Sweden in 1986 on a
false Moroccan passport, and had used several different identities
and birth dates with various Swedish authorities. Miss Mograbi said
the couple has been living in Sweden for six years.

<HEAD>Soviets Come To Rescue Of Antarctic Trek</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has agreed to supply
fuel to the Antarctic expedition led by Minnesotan Will Steger,
preventing an early end to the 4,000-mile ski and sled dog
adventure.
   Until the Soviets stepped forward Monday, the International
Trans-Antarctica Expedition faced the possibility of abandoning its
historic journey at the South Pole, where it is expected to arrive
next week.
   ``It was really serious,'' said Cynthia Mueller, a spokeswoman
at the expedition's St. Paul headquarters.
   The expedition has been jeopardized by breakdowns in the air
support provided by Adventure Network International Inc., a
Canadian firm that has a monopoly on non-government flight
transportation in Antarctica.
   Trans-Antarctica's $1.5 million logistical contract calls for
Adventure Network to place food caches and provide emergency rescue
from the beginning of the expedition on the Antarctic Peninsula to
the Soviet scientific base at Vostok, where the Soviets take over
that responsibility.
   However, finicky weather and repeated mechanical failures by
Adventure Network's cargo carrier, an aging DC-6, left the
expedition without supplies east of the Thiel Mountains, which it
passed more than a week ago.
   Now within 220 miles and one week of the South Pole, the
expedition feared running out of food for Steger, his five
companions and 30 sled dogs.
   ``Without a sufficient supply of fuel at the pole for resupply
and rescue operations, the expedition would have been forced to
halt operations next week,'' said spokeswoman Jennifer Kimball
Gasperini.
   The Soviets, who are limited partners in the expedition, said
Monday that as much as 12 tons of Soviet-owned airplane fuel will
be waiting for the expedition at the South Pole, meaning the dog
mushers will be able to receive food and have a rescue plane
standing by as they continue east across the Area of
Inaccessibility, a remote stretch of ice between the South Pole and
Vostok.
   The Soviets will sell the expedition fuel already cached at the
South Pole, rather than risk a flight across the continent.
Although details are still being negotiated, the Soviet aid will
cost Trans-Antarctica as much as $200,000.
   The expedition, which began July 27, is making its seven-month
journey to bring world attention to Antarctica and to demonstrate
the power of international cooperation. The expedition's other
members are from the Soviet Union, France, Great Britain, Japan and
China.

   Publishers of St. Louis' two competing
newspapers, including the nation's newest daily, say their
long-anticipated ``newspaper war'' has resulted only in the sale of
more papers.
   The St. Louis Sun, which debuted Sept. 25, has averaged 107,000
readers a day in its first two months, while the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch's circulation has remained steady at 378,000 daily
and 565,000 on Sunday.
   ``We look on it as a competition, which is something different
than a war,'' said Ralph Ingersoll II, the Sun's editor-in-chief
and the chairman and chief executive officer of its parent company,
Ingersoll Publications Co.
   Ingersoll and Nicholas Penniman IV, publisher of the
111-year-old Post-Dispatch and vice president of the Pulitzer
Publishing Co., spoke Monday at the annual meeting of the Missouri
and Kansas Associated Press Publishers and Editors.
   ``I do firmly believe that the Post-Dispatch is a much better
newspaper today than it was a year ago,'' Penniman said.
   The Post-Dispatch's Saturday newspaper has increased its
circulation about 3 percent to 348,000 since the Sun began
appearing with its expanded Saturday paper that costs $1 compared
to 25 cents for the Post-Dispatch.
   Ingersoll said he still expected the Sun to turn a profit by the
end of 1990, but that profits won't be as high as originally
projected because of the large number of home subscribers taking
the Sun. Home subscribers pay less.
   He said he expects the Sun's circulation by the end of 1990 to
be about 125,000.
   David Lipman, managing editor of the Post-Dispatch, said the new
competition has accelerated changes at the newspaper and given it a
jolt of adrenalin.
   ``The Post-Dispatch feels 10 years younger. And we're going to
continue feeling young and being useful and still be a lot of
fun,'' he said.
   Before the debut of the Sun, the Post-Dispatch had been without
competition since the St. Louis Globe-Democrat folded in October
1986.

<TEXT>
   Several hundred mourners paid final respects
to Chief Frank Fools Crow in a ceremony that was done in the
traditional Sioux culture with medicine men and with Christian
services by Episcopalian ministers.
   An estimated 700 people attended the nearly five-hour observance
Monday for the Oglala Sioux chief and medicine man believed to be
99 years old.
   The funeral, held in the Little Wound School gymnasium, featured
many aspects of Indian culture, including a full-sized tepee, war
bonnets and colorful quilts. A riderless horse, bearing a blanket
and war bonnet that signified Fools Crow's death, led the wooden
wagon to the graveyard. About 60 horses and riders and a string of
cars two miles long were in tow.
   ``When a warrior dies, they take their horse so the journey into
the spirit world is a good one,'' said Severt Young Bear of
Porcupine.
   Family members rode in a limousine owned by Dennis Banks, a
co-founder of the once-militant American Indian Movement. Banks and
AIM co-founder Russell Means traveled to Kyle to pay last respects
to Fools Crow.
   ``A lot of young people have come back to the traditional ways
because of him,'' Banks said.
   Banks said few people know it was Fools Crow who decided that
Wounded Knee should be the site of a 1973 armed confrontation
between about 300 AIM supporters and 300 federal lawmen.
   ``He knew something was going to happen, so he said we should go
back to Wounded Knee,'' Banks said.
   Two Indians were killed in the 71-day takeover and two law
officers were wounded.
   Banks said representatives of 80 to 90 Indian tribes were at the
funeral.
   ``I've never seen a funeral the size of this,'' he said.
   Fools Crow was a teacher who helped preserve the Indian way of
life, said Francis Whitebird, state Indian affairs coordinator.
   ``He had a tremendous mental capacity. He saw the world. He
understood things,'' Whitebird said.
   Joe Cash, director of the Institute of Indian Studies at the
University of South Dakota, said Fools Crow will be remembered more
as a medicine man than as a chief. He said those who took part in
the 1973 Wounded Knee uprising used Fools Crow as an example of how
Indians should live.
   ``He became sort of a religious symbol of the old way of doing
things,'' Cash said.
   Although births of many Indians were not recorded when South
Dakota first joined the union, the widely respected spiritual
leader was believed to be 99 years old. He died Nov. 27.
   Born on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, one of the most
economically depressed areas of the country, Fools Crow quit school
in the third grade to help his family earn a living.
   He later traveled throughout the United States with the Buffalo
Bill Cody Wild West Show.
   Fools Crow lived with grandchildren near Kyle after the death of
his second wife, Kate, last year. He had four children with his
first wife, Fannie Afraid Of Hawk, who died in 1954.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has indicated it is ready to pull
out some of the estimated 80,000 troops it has kept in
Czechoslovakia since Soviet tanks spearheaded a 1968 invasion that
crushed ``Prague Spring'' reforms.
   The announcement by Tass came on the same day the Soviet Union
and four other Warsaw Pact allies that took part in the invasion
jointly denounced it.
   The official Soviet news agency said Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze met Monday with Foreign Minister Jaromir Johanes of
Czechoslovakia to discuss deployment of Soviet troops in the East
bloc country.
   ``It was decided to begin appropriate Soviet-Czechoslovak
consultations with the understanding that this issue should be
tackled in accordance with the ongoing European disarmament
process,'' Tass said.
   ``Reduction of armed forces and armaments on condition of
maintaining European balance ... is the indispensable guarantee of
stability in Europe.''
   According to figures from the rival North American Treaty
Organization, the Warsaw Pact has 3 million full-time military
personnel in Europe, compared with 2.2 million for the Western
alliance. Pact statistics in contrast claim rough parity: 3.6
million for NATO and 3.5 million for the East bloc.
   Bulgaria, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and the Soviet Union
issued their first-ever joint statement condemning the invasion,
which they had defended for nearly two decades, at the end of a
one-day Warsaw Pact meeting Monday.
   ``The dispatch of the armies of the five socialist countries to
Czechoslovakia in 1968 was an act of interference in domestic
affairs of sovereign Czechoslovakia and should be condemned,'' Tass
reported.
   For months, following momentous political change in Eastern
Europe, all the signers of Monday's announcement except the Soviets
condemned the invasion of their ally.
   Romania was not a party to Monday's statement. Its hard-line
leader Nicolae Ceausescu, attended the meeting but his country
refused to take part in the invasion.
   Ironically, Ceausescu is reported to have urged a Warsaw Pact
invasion of Poland in August, when it became the first East bloc
country to seat a government not led by Communists.
   In a separate statement Monday, the Soviet government admitted
the decision to send troops into Czechoslovakia in 1968 to crush a
Communist-led reform movement ``was erroneous in light of all facts
known now.''
   The Soviet announcement likened the situation in 1968 to the
current political upheaval in Czechoslovakia, where demonstrations
and a general strike have forced changes in the leadership. The
statement said this was a natural process of self-reassessment.
   The Warsaw Pact meeting came one day after President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and President Bush completed their summit in Malta.

   Toyota Motor Corp. has recalled every Lexus LS400
luxury automobile sold in the United States so far because of a
sticky cruise control mechanism and defective stoplight cover.
   The recall announced Monday is the first for Lexus, which went
on sale in early September. November sales figures were due out
later today, but company officials estimated that about 8,000 cars
would be affected by the recall.
   The Lexus division of Toyota also makes and markets the ES250
automobile, which is not subject to the recall.
   ``We haven't had any accidents or injuries,'' Lexus Vice
President Dave Illingworth said. He said the two problems had
brought one customer complaint each.
   In addition to the cruise control and stoplamp problems, Lexus
mechanics also will be sure that a wiring connector between the
alternator and the battery is seated properly. If not clicked into
place, battery power could be drained, Lexus spokesman Kurt Von
Zumwalt said.
   ``It's hard in the short term, but in the long term it will help
our image,'' Von Zumwalt said in a telephone interview from his
office in California.
   The company said it would replace a cruise control actuator,
which controls the throttle.
   He also said the plastic covering on the center-mounted
stoplight would be replaced because letting the light burn too long
could melt the covering.
   Letters were to be sent today to owners of the LS400, which
sells for $35,000, telling them to take their cars to the nearest
Lexus dealership.
   ``We believe that we will have everything handled within two to
three weeks,'' Illingworth said.

<TEXT>
   Taxes, gambling and sex education are among the issues North
Dakotans vote on today, while abortion and housing, respectively,
are central to two local California elections.
   North Dakota Secretary of State Jim Kusler predicted 150,000
voters would turn out for today's special election, which includes
seven referendums _ the most on the state's ballot since 1919.
   Gov. George Sinner has conducted an extensive statewide campaign
to push for increases in the state's taxes on sales, income and
motor fuels.
   In addition to the three tax referendums, voters are being asked
to approve mandatory sex education in public schools, a mandatory
seat-belt law, a retirement program for legislators and
legalization of video gambling machines. The ballot also includes a
proposed constitutional amendment to reorganize the executive
branch of state government.
   In California's San Diego County, a state Senate election has
drawn national headlines because one of the candidates, a Roman
Catholic, is the country's first public official to be denied
Communion because of her advocacy of abortion rights.
   Assemblywoman Lucy Killea, a Democrat and the underdog in a
heavily Republican district, has said she will abide by the ban
imposed by Bishop Leo T. Maher, and will not change her stance.
   Her opponent, first-year Assemblywoman Carol Bentley, a
Republican and abortion opponent, has tried to stay away from the
controversy.
   The special election is being held to fill a vacancy created
when the incumbent was made a municipal judge.
   In northern California, Watsonville is holding a city council
election that originally was scheduled for Nov. 7 but was postponed
after the Oct. 17 earthquake, which destroyed more than 300 homes
in the town 95 miles south of San Francisco.
   The election will mark the first time Watsonville has elected
city council members by district. A court ordered the city to end
its tradition of at-large elections because they discriminated
against Hispanic residents, who are about half of the town's
population of 30,000.
   Sixteen candidates, five of them Hispanic, are vying for seven
seats on the new council. Housing and development, which were big
issues before the quake, have loomed even larger in the aftermath
of the disaster.

   Fewer than one in 10 Michigan woman surveyed as
part of a nationwide study said they have had only one sex partner

   About 14 percent of the women surveyed by Dr. Richard Reid, a

   Reid surveyed 962 women between ages 18 and 35 in Detroit,
Kalamazoo, Southfield and Berkley as part of a U.S. Centers for

cancer of the cervix.
   The survey showed 9 percent of the Michigan women have had one
sex partner by age 35; 9.6 percent had two; nearly half had three

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 6th graf, `As a...' to restore first name of Ms. Domingo.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attempted military coup in the Philippines has
given some anxious moments to plaintiffs who are depending on a key
witness to leave that country and testify in federal court.
   The wrongful-death lawsuit accuses former Philippines President
Ferdinand Marcos, his widow, Imelda, and others of arranging the
June 1981 murders of two Seattle union activists because of their
anti-Marcos activities.
   One key witness is Bonifacio Gillego, a one-time member of
Marcos' intelligence network who later rebelled against Marcos and
now is a House member under the government of President Corazon
Aquino.
   Gillego is expected to ``draw a lot of the threads together''
from previous testimony about Marcos intelligence agents operating
in the United States, said Sharon Maeda, spokeswoman for the
Committee for Justice for Domingo and Viernes.
   Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes were activist reformers in the
Alaska Cannery Workers Union. They were shot in union offices in
Seattle on June 1, 1981.
   As a legislator, Gillego was required to obtain special
permission to leave the Philippines during the coup emergency, said
Domingo's sister, Cindy Domingo. At last report he had obtained
that permission, but still faced the task of trying to get a flight
out of the country to appear here, probably next week.
   At least 70 people have been killed and more than 500 wounded
since mutineers seized several military installations and bombed
the presidential palace in Manila on Friday, according to the Red
Cross.
   The chances of Gillego being able to attend ``look very good,''
Ms. Domingo said Monday. Less certain was the status of Randolph
David, a Philippines university professor who was scheduled to
testify about Marcos' martial-law regime.
   If David is unable to leave the Philippines, he would likely
give a deposition by telephone, Ms. Domingo said.
   Three men have been convicted of murdering the two men,
allegedly in an internal union dispute. But plaintiffs claim
Marcos' government marked the men for death because of their
anti-Marcos activities, including support for anti-Marcos trade
unionists in the Philippines.
   The suit, filed in September 1982, seeks $30 million on behalf
of the men's families. In addition to the Marcoses, defendants
include the men convicted of the murders; the Philippines
government; Dr. Leonilo Malabed of San Francisco, a Marcos friend
who ran the Mabuhay Corp.; and Constantine Baruso, a former union
president whose gun was used in the killings. Baruso was never
charged in the killings.
   It was Gillego, in particular, who drew the plaintiffs'
attention to the most important document in the case: a supposed
account sheet for the Mabuhay Corp., a San Francisco company that
plaintiffs claim was used to funnel money from the Philippines to
agents in this country.
   That account sheet includes a $15,000 entry that plaintiffs
claim was money used to pay for the murders.

   A dog shot his master while they were
hunting rabbits in southern Norway last weekend, the sheriff's
office said today.
   The 50-year-old hunter suffered minor injuries when he was hit
by pellets from a shotgun accidently fired by his dog Terna, a
Finnish Hound, said Steinar Mydland, a Lyngdal district deputy
sheriff, confirming a report in the Oslo daily Aftenposten.
   The hunter and his companions had laid down their guns when they
stopped to rest during a hunting trip Saturday near the town of
Lyndal, Mydland said.
   ``The dog was playing near the guns and accidently hit the
trigger,'' he said. ``Luckily, the shot ricocheted. A direct hit
would have been tragic.''
   Mydland refused to name the hunter, who was treated at a
hospital and released.
   ``It wouldn't be right. It's embarrassing for a hunter to get
shot by a dog,'' he said.

<HEAD>Drug May Reverse Balding in Men</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Baldness may be reversed with a new drug that
blocks the male hormone testosterone on scalp cells without the
side effects of steroid-based drugs, a dermatologist reported.
   The drug Cyoctol helped hair growth in 10 of 12 men in a study,
said Dr. Richard A. Strick of the University of California, Los
Angeles, during a presentation Monday to the American Academy of
Dermatology in San Francisco.
   Cyoctol, a synthetic compound developed by Los Angeles-based
Chantal Pharmaceutical Corp., will be tested by Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. to treat acne and baldness.
   Strick's results sound as though they are at least comparable to
the hair-growth gains men make with minoxidil, the only drug
approved for use in the United States against male pattern baldness
and marketed as Rogaine, said Dr. Dowling B. Stough, a
dermatologist at the University of Arkansas.
   Balding men who used a solution of Cyoctol had 12 percent more
hair on a test patch of scalp than they had a year earlier, the
Strick study showed. Men who hadn't been treated lost 9 percent of
their hair.
   Previous studies found that minoxidil resulted in moderate to
dense hair growth in 39 percent of men who used it for a year.
   Rogaine, a 2 percent minoxidil solution, is the only
FDA-approved hair loss treatment and is a non-steroid based drug.
It has been on the market for over a year and costs about $60 for a
one-month supply.
   Strick suggested that perhaps using a combination of Cyoctol and
minoxidil could produce dramatic results.
   But Strick was cautious about directly comparing Cyoctol's
results to those with Rogaine. The studies are not directly
comparable, he said, because they analyzed different sections of
the balding spot and also because they counted hairs in test
sections differently.
   In Rogaine studies, the hairs were counted by hand and the
Cyoctol test used a new computerized method.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also recently approved a
Cyoctol analog as an investigational new drug against skin
wrinkling.
   Stough said the Cyoctol study was small and that baldness
remedies frequently don't live up to their early promise.
   He also said that if Cyoctol proves effective against baldness
it would work best in men in the early stages of hair loss when
most follicles have not died.
   ``You can't grow daffodils without bulbs and you can't grow hair
without follicles,'' Stough said.
   Additionally, Cyoctol appears to have no side effects like
steroid-based preparations. Cyoctol is considered exciting because
it doesn't act as a steroid interfering with the body's hormonal
balance.
   Steroidal substances can reverse baldness, but they can lead to
undesired feminine body characteristics, such as cessation of beard
growth and enhanced breast development.
   Cyoctol blocks the sites on the walls of the scalp cells at
which the male hormone testosterone attaches to cause male pattern
baldness. When attachment occurs, the hair follicle shrinks and
eventually stops growing hair. This type of baldness runs in
families and affects about 30 percent of men in the United States.

   The bright lights of Christmas brought together
some 50,000 spectators huddling in bitter cold for the 57th annual
tree-lighting ceremony at Rockefeller Center.
   ``I love New York in the holidays,'' said Pat Polkowske, 31, of
Hanau, West Germany, who spent the day window shopping with her two
daughters, Leah, 7, and Wesle, 8. ``There's a real special feeling

26-degree chill early Monday evening, gasped as the 20,000 lights
on the 70-foot tall Norway spruce burst into a kaleidoscope of
color at the push of a button from David Rockefeller and youngsters
in a truancy prevention program.
   The crowd roared, oohed, and aahed while the Choral Society of
the Hamptons joined in with ``Joy to the World.''
   ``It's fun that everyone came together for this one day,'' said
Nicola Tuseo, 21, of Bayside, Queens, adding that past
tree-lightings she watched on television don't hold a candle to the
real thing.
   The wintry weather, which with the wind chill felt more like 15
degrees, didn't dampen the crowd's spirits, some of whom serenaded
police with Christmas carols.
   Over the past two weeks, workers festooned the tree from
Montebello, N.Y., with five miles of wire.
   In a holiday blessing before the lighting, the Rev. Calvin Butts
of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem said the lights on the
tree symbolized thousands of voices seeking freedom in the cities
of Eastern Europe and in the jail cells of South Africa. Butts
reminded the crowd ``to remember those children for whom there are
no gifts.''
   Judit Somogyi, 19, of Budapest, Hungary, was in New York
visiting friends.
   ``We can celebrate Christmas and religion more in Hungary now,''
because of growing political freedom in Eastern Europe, she said
through an interpreter.
   ``But I really like Snoopy and how New York does Christmas,''
she said.

   Israeli warplanes today attacked a
Palestinian guerrilla base near this southern port city, wounding
seven people, most of them Palestinian civilians, police said.
   Four fighters struck the base of terrorist mastermind Abu
Nidal's Fatah Revolutionary Council in the Majdalioun Valley, east
of Sidon, a police spokesman said.
   However, an Israeli army announcement in Jerusalem said
warplanes struck a headquarters and a base of the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, headed by former
Syrian army Capt. Ahmed Jibril.
   There was no immediate explanation for the conflicting reports.
   The Lebanese police spokesman said most of the casualties were
Palestinian civilians seeking medical treatment at a Palestinian
guerrilla-run clinic when the Israeli warplanes struck.
   The Israeli army said all aircraft returned safely from the noon
raid.
   The police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with
regulations, said the jets fired eight rockets at the Abu Nidal
base and flew west over the Mediterranean.
   ``It was a swift attack. It only lasted a few minutes,'' the
spokesman said. Guerrilla defenders ``hardly managed to open fire
from anti-aircraft guns. No hits were observed,'' he added.
   He said Abu-Nidal's guerrillas immediately blocked all
approaches to the valley as their jeeps and ambulances evacuated
casualties to hospitals in Sidon.
   Smoke billowed from the valley as the guerrillas fired rifles in
the air to make way for their ambulances.
   Two Swiss Red Cross workers kidnapped in Sidon Oct. 6 are
believed held in the valley.
   The attack was Israel's 17th air raid in Lebanon this year.
   By police count, 18 people were killed and 109 wounded in the 16
previous attacks. The latest was Nov. 25 against the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command in southeastern
Lebanon.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, broke away from
Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah group in the early 1970s and
formed his own group.
   Abu Nidal is reported ill or under house arrest at his
headquarters in Libya.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh,
who swept Rajiv Gandhi out of office with a pledge to fight
corruption, today presented a new Council of Ministers that
includes three of Gandhi's former ministers.
   Oaths of office were administered to 15 Cabinet ministers and
two lower-level ministers of state. Together they comprise the
Council of Ministers, along with Singh and Deputy Prime Minister
Devi Lal who were sworn in Saturday.
   No portfolios were announced during the televised half-hour
ceremony presided over by President Ramaswamy Venkataraman at the
presidential palace.
   Singh told reporters portfolios would be announced Wednesday. He
said more ministers would be announced later.
   He denied the delays were caused by dissension within his
National Front centrist coalition, which was created this year by
people who had little in common except their opposition to Gandhi
and his Congress Party.
   The coalition combined to create the most cohesive opposition
force since India became independent 42 years ago, and it resulted
in the Congress Party being bumped from power for only the second
time since then.
   Singh, leader of the National Front, must seek Parliament's vote
of confidence for his government by the end of December.
   The new ministers include Gandhi's estranged cousin and his
former minister of state for home affairs, Arun Nehru; ex-Tourism
Minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed; and ex-Minister of State for
Industry Arif Mohammed Khan.
   The ministers of state included Maneka Gandhi, Gandhi's
estranged sister-in-law.
   Singh, who himself once served Gandhi as defense and finance
minister, is the leader of the Janata Dal, or People's Party, the
largest of the five parties comprising the National Front.
   Twelve of the ministers announced today are members of the
Janata Dal. One minister represents each of the coalition's other
four parties _ the Congress (Socialist) Party and three regional
parties, the Telegu Desam from Andhra Pradesh state, Asom Gana
Parishad from Assam state and Dravida Munnestra Kazagham from Tamil
Nadu state.
   Singh's slate is India's first minority goverment. No single
party won a majority of the 525 Parliament seats decided in the
Nov. 22-26 election.
   Singh, 58, took office after the National Front was assured
support from two extremes of the political spectrum _ the
right-wing Hindu fundamentalist Bharatiya Janata Party and a
Communist alliance.
   The National Front won 144 parliamentary seats. The Bharatiya
Janata or Indian People's Party, which captured 88 seats, and the
Communist alliance, which won 51, said they will support Singh but
will not join the government.
   Singh, like all six previous prime ministers, is a Hindu but has
sworn to preserve India's secular form of government.
   Singh, like all six previous prime ministers, is a Hindu but has
sworn to preserve India's secular form of government.
   The Congress Party remained the single largest party with 193
seats but did not seek the coalition partners needed for a
parliamentary majority.

   A faculty vote to ban the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps from the University of Wisconsin-Madison because of
discrimination against homosexuals is not binding but will
encourage debate, officials said.
   The faculty voted 386-248 Monday in favor of the resolution,
which calls for the removal of the Army, Navy and Air Force ROTC in
May 1993 if the military continues to refuse candidates on the
basis of homosexuality.
   The action is not binding because only the Board of Regents,
which governs University of Wisconsin campuses across the state,
can terminate the ROTC contract with the federal government.
   It was unlikely the UW Regents would consider the resolution at
its meeting on Friday, said Regent Erroll Davis, who declined to
say whether he would support such a ban.
   ``It isn't on our agenda,'' Davis said. ``I certainly wouldn't
begin to speculate on what my fellow board members would do.''
   Chancellor Donna Shalala said the faculty vote could bring the
issue to the attention of Congress.
   ``It's the beginning, I hope, of a major debate about
discrimination in the ROTC,'' she said.
   Opponents of the resolution said it would hurt the university
and wouldn't create a change in the military's policy.
   ``This will make the campus less appealing'' to prospective ROTC
students and the U.S. Department of Defense, said Gordon Baldwin, a
law professor and the ROTC's faculty liaison.
   ``This is like a mosquito bite on a whale,'' Baldwin said. ``I
would be surprised if the regents canceled these contracts.''
   Baldwin, who was among about 15 faculty members who spoke at the
meeting, said afterward he doesn't support or oppose the military's
stand on homosexuals.
   Last week, Republican Gov. Tommy G. Thompson said ROTC should be
allowed to remain on campus because it is good for the university
system.
   The total of 634 votes cast Monday compared with 2,400 faculty
members who were eligible to vote.
   The ROTC at Madison serves 440 students, 155 whom are on full
scholarship, Baldwin said.
   Supporters of ROTC said the university, which was founded under
the federal Land Grant Act of 1862, is required to provide military
instruction.
   The faculty resolution would give the program until 1993 to
change its policy and accept homosexuals. If it refused, the
resolution urges moving the program off campus until the ban is
lifted.

   The search for a missing commuter
plane with eight people aboard resumed today with a Coast Guard
ship carrying sophisticated sonar to look for wreckage in about 100
feet of water.
   The search of Block Island Sound for a twin-engine New England
Airlines plane missing since Nov. 28 was postponed Monday by heavy
waves and high wind, said Coast Guard Lt. Hank Leeper.
   Seas of 4 to 8 feet were whipped by wind blowing at 20 to 35
knots.
   ``That's prohibitive for us for operating'' the side-scanning
sonar, which does not work well in waves of more than 6 feet, said
Richard Walker, an engineer with the Coast Guard Research and
Development Center in Groton, Conn.
   Seas today averaged 2 to 3 feet with wind under 12 mph, said
Seaman Michael Allard at the Point Judith Coast Guard Station.
   The plane took off from Block Island on a night flight to
Westerly, 17 miles across the sound. Floating debris and the bodies
of two dogs belonging to a passenger indicated the Britten-Norman
Islander broke up, a National Transportation Safety Board spokesman
said.
   Leeper said searchers would concentrate on a three-square-mile
``primary'' area where a study of wind and tide action made the
greatest probability of finding the wreckage. They hoped to cover
that in a day with the sonar.
   The sonar will ``show anything, rock outcroppings ... it looks
very much like an aerial photograph, as if the water were
removed,'' said John Fish, president of American Underwater Search
and Survey Inc., of Cataumet, Mass., which provided the equipment.

<TEXT>
   Former Communist Party chief Erich Honecker
and other members of his ousted leadership have been put under
house arrest at their luxury residential compound, the official
news agency ADN said today.
   Also, East Germany's chief prosecutor resigned after mounting
criticism he could not handle investigations into abuses of power
by ousted Communist leaders. Citizens began to keep vigil at police
stations.
   Honecker lost his job in a major power reshuffle on Oct. 18 and
on Sunday he was ousted from the party he had led for 18 years. He
was replaced as party leader by Egon Krenz, who resigned under
pressure Sunday along with his Politburo and Central Committee.
   ``The former general-secretary and president Erich Honecker is
among those who are not allowed to leave their houses in the
elegant compound,'' ADN reported. The Wandlitz compound near Berlin
has 23 houses used by Politburo members and their families.
   ADN said all former Politburo members who were still living at
Wandlitz also were held there.
   It was not immediately clear when Honecker was arrested. The
77-year-old former leader has been in ill health following surgery
last summer and had been a virtual recluse in Wandlitz since
October.
   Honecker and his inner circle are under investigation for
suspected corruption; three former Politburo members are already in
prison pending investigation.
   Prosecutors sealed off secret police offices in East Berlin
where large sums of money and files had apparently been packaged
for transport, ADN said. They acted on a tip from citizens keeping
watch outside.
   Growing public outrage has led to citizens to try to storm at
least one public building, while others have stood guard to make
sure that no potential criminal evidence is smuggled away from
government offices.
   ADN gave no reason for prosecutor Guenter Wendland's resignation.
   Wendland was a holdover from Honecker's hard-line government and
had been leading a probe of police accused of beating and
mistreating pro-democracy protesters following massive rallies in
early October.
   A group of lawyers and legal experts had demanded his
resignation, saying he was too close to the now-disgraced former
power structure to handle the probes.
   The 25-member interim committee guiding East Germany's Communist
Party has appealed to angry citizens for calm to avoid ``anarchy
and chaos.''
   In Bonn, the federal government announced that Rudolf Seiters,
the top aide to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, would travel to East Berlin
late today for talks with Premier Hans Modrow.
   The 61-year-old premier has emerged as the nation's top
political figure since the Communist Party's leadership quit on
Sunday.
   Seiters was scheduled to see whether Kohl should go forward with
his planned visit to East Germany that had been expected by the end
of the year.
   West Germany has called for reunification of the countries, a
proposal rejected by the Communists and some opposition activists.
But late Monday, about 200,000 people rallied in Leipzig, calling
for reunification and shouting ``Germany, United Fatherland.''
   The move against the secret police was the latest in a series of
searches and seizures.
   ADN said investigators discovered bundles of secret police files
in a ``sensitive area,'' packed for transport. Citizens in East
Berlin had become suspicious when they spotted lights on in several
secret police offices where the shades had been pulled. They
notified police.
   The prosecutor sealed several offices and ordered police to
guard them.
   During the search, one person carrying two large suitcases left
the building through a side door but was stopped by a group of
citizens who turned him over to police, ADN said.
   Prosecutor Rainer Glawe permitted Olaf Klein, a member of the
opposition group New Forum, to observe the investigation.
   Glawe later said the person who had been apprehended was freed
after identification, but that the two suitcases contained ``large
sums of (East German) marks and foreign currencies.''
   ``Apparently, according to what is known, the money was intended
for a contact person of Swedish nationality for further delivery to
fake companies to which the name Schalck-Golodkowski has been
connected,'' ADN said.
   Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski was East Germany's chief trade
negotiator. He is being sought as a fugitive in connection with
shady currency and weapons deals and disappeared this weekend.
   East Germany's ambassador in Switzerland, Eckard Bibow, said
today the country has issued an international warrant for
Schalck-Golodkowski's arrest.
   In the first direct cooperation, the temporary committee running
the Communist Party joined with opposition groups to form a
commission to investigate charges of corruption.
   The Central Committee building in East Berlin was ringed by
security officials who checked cars and bags of officials leaving
the party headquarters.
   Offices and safes of former officials were placed under guard to
prevent them from destroying or spiriting away documents.

   A Canadian pilot shot down in 1944 was
buried today in a military cemetery surrounded by family, friends
and members of a French association searching for Allied soldiers
lost during the Battle of Normandy.
   A.E. Miron was a 25-year-old fighter pilot on Aug. 17, 1944, the
day his ``Typhoon'' was hit by a German shell.
   ``I was flying in formation with Miron when I saw his plane come
from behind and crash to earth,'' recalled John Thompson, a member
of the squadron who was interviewed by the French news agency
Agence France-Presse.
   Other witnesses told the association, Wings of Victory, that the
plane plunged into a haystack that camouflaged Nazi anti-aircraft
artillery. The information helped the group locate the remains of
Miron, who had been listed as missing, in a Normany field on Sept.
2.
   Miron was buried with 799 of his comrades in the small British
military cemetery of Saint-Charles-de-Percy, AFP reported.
   Jacques Brehin, president of the association, said seven lost
aircraft have been found since his group began looking in 1984. He
said 15 pilots are still listed as missing from the 151 who were
shot down during the prolonged battle to liberate France.
   No information was immediately available on Miron's home town.

<HEAD>Jury Ponders Whether To Cancel Vacation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After a month of deliberations, the jury in
the McMartin preschool molestation trial is discussing a new
subject _ whether or not to interrupt deliberations for a Christmas
vacation.
   The jurors were confronted with the option Monday after Superior
Court Judge William Pounders yielded to their concerns and decided
not to announce partial verdicts before the scheduled Christmas
break on Dec. 15.
   He urged jurors to reconsider whether they want to take the two
weeks off or continue deliberating.
   ``Our concern is with you,'' he said. ``We have to keep you
together, healthy and hopefully happy and not so angry at each
other that we lose one of you.''
   The jurors retired to their deliberation room but had not
announced their decision by day's end.
   Three jurors had told the judge earlier they were worried about
community pressure on them if partial verdicts were publicized
before the entire 65 counts were resolved.
   The jurors are considering 65 separate charges against Raymond
Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62, who are
accused of molesting children at their family owned preschool in
Manhattan Beach.
   The 2{-year-old trial is the longest and costliest criminal
proceeding in Los Angeles and U.S. history, and the judge has said
he's determined to get verdicts. Six original alternates were used
up as illness and job problems caused them to drop out. All
verdicts must be unanimous, and loss of one juror now could cause a
mistrial.
   In an unusual plan, Pounders asked the jury to deliver sealed
verdicts as they decided individual counts. But since no verdict is
final until it is announced in court and affirmed by all jurors, he
had planned to announce a partial verdict before the vacation.
   He intended the vacation to give jurors respite from stress of
deliberations, which could take months. But on Monday it turned out
that at least seven jurors planned to return to their jobs during
the break rather than take vacations.
   Pounders then suggested they might want to cancel the vacation.
However, at least one juror has purchased plane tickets for an out
of state trip and would lose money if it was canceled, he said.

<HEAD>Israeli Troops Kill Five Guerrillas In Negev Desert</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli troops shot and killed five guerrillas
today who infiltrated Israel from Egypt, the military announced.
   It said the clash occurred in the morning after the guerrillas
crossed the border from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula into the western
part of Israel's southern Negev desert.
   It was the first infiltration in nine months from Egypt, the
only Arab country to have signed a peace treaty with Israel.
   An Israeli force encountered the guerrillas, gave chase and
killed them all without suffering any casualties, the army said.
   It was not known to which organization the guerrillas belonged.
They carried five Soviet-designed Kalashnikov assault rifles,
grenades, a pistol with magazines, binoculars and wire cutters, the
army said.
   The head of the army's southern command, Maj. Gen. Matan Vilnai,
told Israel army radio the attack apparently was linked to the
second anniversary this week of the Palestinian uprising in the
occupied lands.
   ``We can assume there is a link between these things. ... There
is no doubt that organizations which we confront would try to carry
out such an attack,'' Vilnai said. He refused to give details of
the clash.
   He said the guerrillas carried at least 50 grenades.
   ``This equipment shows they simply meant to kill. Not to argue
too much, not to carry out a hostage-taking operation, but a
killing operation,'' Vilnai said.
   Vilnai noted that Israel's border with Egypt was usually quiet.
Israel and Egypt signed a U.-S.-mediated peace treaty in 1979 and
have full diplomatic relations.
   The last reported infiltration from Egypt occurred March 15,
when two teen-aged Palestinian guerrillas were captured near the
border town of Rafah.
   Army sources said the guerrillas planned to attack an army base
or patrol in the area.
   A year earlier, on March 7, 1988, three Palestinian guerrillas
who infiltrated from Egypt seized a commuter bus near the southern
city of Beersheva. Three civilians were killed and nine reported
wounded. The guerrillas were shot to death when anti-riot police
stormed the vehicle.

<TEXT>
   Temperatures eased today across the East after a day of bitter
cold sent homeless people throughout the Northeast to crowded
shelters and set records as far south as Florida.
   A warm front headed across the middle Atlantic states today,
with New York City expecting a high in the upper 30s, up 10 degrees
from Monday, when temperatures were freezing all day from the Great
Lakes to the northern Atlantic Coast, with highs only in the teens
in northern New England.
   But cold air held its ground today in upstate New York, with
lows today of 14 below zero at Watertown and 13 below in Massena,
according to the National Weather Service. Albany tied a 1926
record of 2 degrees and Binghamton tied its record of 5 degrees.
   Much of New England also is staying cold with more bone-chilling
temperatures, stiff wind and snow flurries expected.
   ``We may be lucky to hit the 32 mark all week,'' said Scott
Reynolds, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Vermont.
Monday's high was 15 degrees in many parts of the state.
   A ferocious weekend snowstorm in northern Maine left Caribou
under 21 inches of fresh snow, for a total depth of 30 inches, and
high wind Monday caused widespread drifting.
   When temperatures dipped into the teens in New York City on
Monday, officials said transit police did not evict the homeless
from subways or stations except in extreme cases.
   ``Stations are not shelters or houses, but we recognize that
it's cold out there,'' said Caren Gardner, a Transit Authority
spokeswoman. ``We're not cruel and inhuman, we're not going to put
them out on the street.''
   The city's 24 shelters housed 8,900 people Sunday night.
   In New Jersey, the year's first blast of severe cold weather
also filled shelters as scores of homeless people escaped wind
chill temperatures of minus 30 degrees.
   ``We had to send people away, right back into the cold,'' said
Elizabeth Jones, a spokeswoman for the 16-bed Salvation Army
shelter in Elizabeth. ``There were more people than there was
room.''
   Monday's low of 15 degrees, recorded at Newark International
Airport, was far below the normal low of 32, said Harry Woodworth,
a National Weather Service meteorologist. Today's low was 24
degrees.
   In Boston, the Pine Street Inn, which provides 730 beds for the
homeless, was full Sunday, with some people staying in the lobby.
   A low of 18 and wind chill of minus 10 to minus 25, plus already
crowded shelters, forced Philadelphia officials to add 125 beds for
the homeless, to a total of 2,975. Today's low was 29, with an
expected high of 45.
   In Florida, generally warmer temperatures were forecast today
with highs from the low to mid 60s in the north to the mid 70s in
the south, the weather service said.
   Temperatures hit record lows Monday across the state, including
47 at Miami, 39 at Fort Myers, 33 at Tampa, 40 at St. Petersburg
and 27 at Apalachicola. But today's low at Miami was 53, with 41 at
Tampa, 43 at Fort Myers and 36 at Apalachicola.
   Most of Alabama also had record lows, including 25 at the Gulf
of Mexico port of Mobile. In Mississippi, Jackson and Meridian each
hit a record low of 20.
   In the Pacific Northwest, heavy rain and melting snow caused
flooding and forced the evacuation of up to 30 people Monday in the
Concrete area in western Washington and about 200 in the town of
Hamilton, both along the Skagit River, said David Brookings of
Skagit County public works.

<HEAD>Parties Got $28.5 Million in Unregulated Contributions, Study Finds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican and Democratic parties in nine
battleground states last year received $28.5 million in ``soft
money'' contributions unregulated by federal campaign laws, a study
released today said.
   The study by the Center for Responsive Politics did not examine
how the money was spent.
   However, Ellen Miller, executive director of the center, said
the report ``finds such obvious patterns of questionable soft money
giving that anyone can see there was wholesale erosion of our
campaign finance laws during last year's presidential campaign.''
   ``Soft money'' consists primarily of direct contributions by
corporations and labor unions _ which cannot be given in any amount
to federal elections _ and individual donations that exceed amounts
permitted by federal law.
   In 41 states, it is legal to use union and corporate
contributions for state and local election campaigns. More than
half the states also allow unlimited individual contributions to
the political parties.
   It is illegal to use such money in presidential or congressional
election campaigns, which are governed by federal law.
   ``Based on the record publicily available, any individual soft
money donations identified in this report may in themselves have
been fully legal, but overall, these donations and the aggregate
amounts of soft money contributions identified illustrate the
potential for abuse in the current law,'' the center's study said.
   The center is a private nonprofit organization that studies
congressional, campaign finance and other issues. Its board of
directors is chaired by Bethine Church, widow of former Sen. Frank
Church, D-Idaho, and includes former Republican and Democratic
members of Congress.
   The states studied were California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois,
Missouri, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas and Washington. They
were selected because their laws permit soft money contributions,
they had extensive disclosure requirements and they were hotly
contested, or battleground, states in the presidential campaign,
Ms. Miller said.
   The Republican and Democratic parties in the states received $11
million from individuals and $6.5 million from corporations, the
study said. The Democratic National Committee contributed slightly
more than $7.5 million in soft money and the Republican National
Committee just over $2 million in the nine states.
   About one-third of the contributions wre made in the month
before the election. The Republican National Committee, for
instance, gave 80 percent of its money in the nine states during
that period.
   The California GOP received the most soft money of any state
party examined, getting $5.8 million.
   More than 77 percent of the corporate contributions of $20,000
or more went to Republican state parties, as did nearly 90 percent
of the individual contributions of that size.
   The states in which soft money totals were the largest were
California, $10.2 million; Florida, $4.7 million; Illinois $4.4
million; Texas $3.2 million; Colorado, $2.1 million; and Missouri,
$1.5 million. The remaining totals were nearly $1 million in
Washington, $883,000 in Pennsylvania and $345,286 in North Carolina.
   The leading individual donor in the nine states was H. Wayne
Huizenga, president of Blockbuster Entertainment of Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., who gave $117,000. The leader among business
contributors was Atlantic Richfield Corp., which gave $159,500.

<HEAD>Court Makes it Easier for Workers to Sue Unions in Ohio Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today made it easier for
workers to sue their unions over alleged failures to provide fair
representation.
   The court unanimously reinstated a federal lawsuit a Toledo,
Ohio, area sheet metal worker filed against his union five years
ago.
   Lynn L. Breininger's suit contends that Local 6 of the Sheet
Metal Workers International Association discriminated against him
in referring work out of its hiring hall.
   Lower courts had thrown out the suit, ruling that Breininger was
alleging an unfair labor practice and that the National Labor
Relations Board has exclusive jurisdiction over such claims.
   Those courts were wrong, the justices said today.
   ``That a breach of duty of fair representation might also be an
unfair labor practice is not enough to deprive a federal court of
jurisdiction over the fair representation claim,'' Justice William
J. Brennan wrote.
   He added: ``Federal courts have jurisdiction to hear
fair-representation suits whether or not they are accompanied by
claims against employers.''
   Local 6 represents sheet metal workers who work for various
employers in the Toledo area. The union has collective bargaining
agreements with two associations of employers.
   The union operates a job-referral system out of a union hiring
hall.
   Breininger, a longtime union member, alleges that the union
refused to honor employers' specific requests for his services and
unjustifiably passed him over in making referrals.
   His suit also contended that Local 6 had violated the federal
Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 by, in
effect, disciplining him because he had politically opposed some
union leaders.
   Today's decision was not a total defeat for Local 6. The
justices, by a 7-2 vote, said lower courts were right in ruling
that the union's alleged failure to refer Breininger for jobs
through its hiring hall is not, even if true, a violation of the
1959 law.
   That still left Breininger free to pursue his
fair-representation claim in federal court.
   Justices John Paul Stevens and Antonin Scalia dissented from
that part of the court's decision. They said Breininger should be
allowed to sue over the alleged violation of the 1959 law in
addition to the alleged failure of fair representation.
   The case is Breininger vs. Sheet Metal Workers, 88-124.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the nation's two republics
today named a government dominated by non-Communists following
rallies nationwide that denounced the Communists and demanded a new
federal government.
   The Czech republic's new government was the first of any kind in
Czechoslovakia in 41 years that the Communists did not dominate.
   Hours after the regional government was named, an opposition
delegation led by playwright Vaclav Havel met with Communist
premier Ladislav Adamec to discuss how to meet popular demands for
democracy by reshuffling the federal government.
   The Czech republic's parliament accepted the resignations of 11
ministers in the regional government and sacked Communist deputy
premier Jaroslav Tlapak, the state-run news agency CTK reported.
   However, Communist Frantisek Pitra remained as premier of the
regional government. The new 16-member Cabinet named to serve under
him contains nine non-Communists _ five non-party people and four
from parties traditionally allied with the Communists but now
playing a more independent role. Seven were Communists.
   The Czech republic's actions could pave the way for similar
changes in the federal government, as demanded by angry protesters
opposed to the federal government named Sunday. That Cabinet
contained only five non-Communists and left the Communists in all
the key ministries.
   Striking students, actors and other artists today promised to
continue their 2-week-old sit-ins and work stoppages for another
week.
   As Adamec met with opposition leaders at the federal government
building in Prague, about 2,000 students gathered outside and
blocked access to it by building a giant wall of cardboard boxes
and chanting, ``Resign! Resign!''
   More than 150,000 people jammed Prague's Wenceslas Square on
Monday night and chanted the same slogan and demanded free
elections by July.
   ``They must go!'' the protesters roared in condemnation of the
national Communist leadership. ``They lied to us again!''
   At least 50,000 people rallied in the Slovak capital of
Bratislava Monday night and the state news agency CTK reported
protests in the Bohemian city of Usti nad Labem to the north,
Gottwaldov to the east and Ostrova on the Polish border.
   The protests replaced the euphoria of a week ago, when the
popular movement to end 41 years of orthodox Communist rule brought
down the old hard-line leadership. Many demonstrators feel the
Communists are reneging on promises of reform.
   Opposition leaders threatened to call a general strike on Monday
if Adamec does not form a new national government by Sunday that
includes more non-Communists.
   Last week, the Communist Party officially relinquished its
monopoly on power and Adamec raised people's hopes by promising a
coalition government.
   The concessions followed a two-hour general strike Nov. 27 that
was organized by Civic Forum as a referendum on one-party Communist
rule. The strike paralyzed the country as millions of people poured
into the streets.
   But the Communists hold all the key ministries on the new
21-member Cabinet. Thirteen members are holdovers from the
administration that resigned last month under public pressure.
   The Civic Forum, moving away from its previously stated role as
strictly an opposition coalition, said it would propose its own
candidates for a new government.
   Civic Forum spokesman Jiri Dienstbier said the opposition faces
increasing public demands to establish a clear-cut political
program.
   He said Civic Forum could endorse candidates who are members of
other parties if they endorse the opposition coalition's ideals,
foremost among them free elections, speech and assembly.
   In another indication of the strength of opposition pressure, a
parliamentary commission appointed to investigate the harsh police
repression of a student demonstration on Nov. 17 delivered its
report.
   CTK said the committee reported that 1,569 riot police used
brutal and undue force against the demonstrators. Public outrage at
the police tactics helped launch what became 11 straight days of
massive pro-democracy demonstrations.
   The commission report said an undetermined number of
demonstrators suffered serious injuries, including internal
bleeding and spinal damage. The report dismissed as unrealistic the
Interior Ministry statement that 44 demonstrators were injured.
   It also disputed official statements that demonstrators attacked
police and said some police actions by police were so brutal there
could be prosecutions for assault and abuse of public office.
   The report concluded by saying ``high political persons'' were
responsible for the police actions and the suppression of previous
protests, but did not give any names.

   The Navy learned a lesson when
Greenpeace anti-nuclear protesters halted the submarine launch of a
Trident 2 missile in July, and it was ready for them this time.
   In a high seas drama 50 miles off the Florida coast on Monday,
Navy ships rammed and fire-hosed the 190-foot MV Greenpeace vessel
while helicopters buzzed two small high-speed rafts. Sailors in
motorized rafts cut the fuel lines of one Greenpeace raft before
towing both out of the launch safety zone.
   With their vessels helpless, about 25 Greenpeace activists could
only watch as the nuclear submarine Tennessee unleashed the Trident
2, the Navy's newest, most powerful weapon, on a successful test
launch.
   The 44-foot missile shot out of a tube in the sub's deck, broke
the sea's surface, ignited and hurled a dummy warhead package to an
ocean target several thousand miles away.
   ``We did a perfect launch, just beautiful,'' Vice Adm. Roger
Bacon, commander of the Atlantic Submarines Fleet, told reporters.
   The success of the fourth Trident 2 test flight put the program
back on track toward becoming operational next spring after two
explosive failures in the first three tests.
   Greenpeace spokesman Steven Shallhorn said today on ABC's ``Good
Morning America'' that the group believes the Navy acted in panic.
   ``They are very, very desperate to save their Trident 2 missile
program,'' he said. ``Because of the technical failures that they
have it's a prime candidate to be cut when defense spending starts
to be cut next year.''
   Bacon also appeared on the ABC program and said he was concerned
about safety.
   ``I warned that vessel over 50 times, most of the times
personally, to remain outside of 5,000 yards from the submarine,''
he said. ``They did everything just not safe, and I want these
operations to be safe.''
   Greenpeace, which said it was considering suing the Navy for
Monday's action, had successfully used the MV Greenpeace and the
two motorized rafts, called Zodiacs, to halt a launch from the
Tennessee in July.
   ``We were more prepared today because we looked at what they
tried to do on July 28, and we used the minimum force necessary
today to clear the area,'' Bacon said.
   The ``minimum force'' included three large ships, three
helicopters and eight motorized rafts. More than 900 sailors were
assigned to the task force that kept the launch area clear.
   ``This is a terrible outrage,'' said Peter Bahouth, executive
director of Greenpeace USA, in a statement. ``This is an unbridled
act of aggression against a peaceful protest in international
waters.''
   For many years, Greenpeace has attempted to stop nuclear testing
at sea. In July 1985, this tactic of direct intervention turned
tragic when French secret agents sunk the Rainbow Warrior, a
Greenpeace ship, off Auckland, New Zealand.
   The ship was sent to protest French nuclear testing in the South
Pacific. Explosives were attached to the ship's hull. One crew
member was killed.
   Greenpeace's protest Monday was over the United States' refusal
to negotiate with the Soviet Union on a reduction of sea-based
nuclear missiles.
   The incident began at dawn as the Tennessee submerged for the
Trident 2 countdown, and the MV Greenpeace moved inside the
5,000-yard diameter safety circle around the sub.
   Burnette said the Navy repeated warnings: If the protesters
didn't clear the area, the Navy would ``exercise its rights under
international law and will forcibly remove you.''
   The MV Greenpeace radioed back, ``You are doing your best but
you haven't sunk us yet; we are staying.''
   Two submarine support ships, the Grasp and the Kittiwake, took
up positions on either side of the Greenpeace, shot water from fire
hoses into the smoke stacks to stop the engines and then bumped the
vessel out of the safety area.
   Greenpeace spokeswoman Shannon Fagan reported two holes, one a
three-foot gash, were punched in the Greenpeace hull. The Navy said
it counted only one hole, about one foot in diameter.
   Fagan said the Greenpeace was ```dead in the water'' for about
an hour until the crew got one of the engines restarted. The ship
then limped toward port in Jacksonville, Fla.
   The Navy plans five more submarine launches of the Trident 2. If
all goes well, the Tennessee is scheduled to go on operational
patrol next spring with 24 of the deadly missiles. Each is capable
of propelling as many as 12 warheads to different targets more than
4,600 miles away.

   Officials at the Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory denied a congressional report that said there
were serious security lapses involving large amounts of plutonium.
   ``At no time has plutonium been unprotected,'' said L. Lynn
Cleland, acting manager of the weapons lab's safeguards and
security. Cleland, at a news conference Monday, called Lawrence
Livermore's plutonium building ``one of our most highly secured
facilities.''
   According to a report released Sunday, the federal weapons lab
35 miles east of San Francisco had left the radioactive material _
enough for a nuclear weapon _ unattended.
   The report included transcripts of testimony by Department of
Energy officials at a hearing last July before the House Energy and
Commerce subcommitee on oversight and investigations. The panel is
investigating the Department of Energy's weapons facilities.
   According to the transcript of the testimony, Edward J.
McCallum, the DOE's top security evaluator, testified that
Livermore lab security ``has not been effective.''
   Amounts of plutonium and other nuclear weapons materials were
``left unattended in unalarmed rooms during off-shift hours,''
McCallum said. Previous security measures were inadequate to
protect the material from sabotage or theft, but the lab has since
corrected the problem, he said.
   Cleland, while insisting no plutonium was unprotected and that
none of it was missing, said the lab agreed with a DOE
recommendation to improve security.
   ``There were deficiencies, but we did not feel they were very
serious, but they were serious enough that they needed to be
addressed and we addressed them,'' he said.
   Livermore ranked lowest of all 26 nuclear weapons facilities in
the nation for safeguarding nuclear weapons materials, according to
the testimony. Lab officials said they didn't know how the DOE
arrived at that ranking.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Health and Human Services
collected nearly $5.7 billion in settlements, fines, restitutions
and savings in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, according to an
HHS inspector general's report released today.
   But it contended that millions more could be saved if the
department heeded Inspector General Richard Kusserow's
recommendations involving changes in the Medicare and Medicaid
programs.
   Recommendations by the inspector general, or internal watchdog,
for savings, prosecutions and sanctions have netted $26.9 billion
for the department over the past five years, the report said.
   Changes that result from rules changes in HHS programs, like
Medicaid and Medicare, account for the largest savings.
   The report estimated that the Health Care Financing
Administration, which runs Medicare and Medicaid, will save $465
million over five years with establishment of a reasonable payment
rate for a new drug for patients with kidney disease.
   It also projected a five-year savings of $312 million with
elimination of Medicare payments for unnecessary assistant surgeon
services.
   The report also outlined previous inspector general
recommendations for savings that the department has not acted on.
   For example, it said, the financing administration could save
$400 million to $900 million annually by requiring insurance
companies that are primary payers to pay claims instead of passing
them on to Medicare.
   The inspector general also said Medicare could save millions of
dollars each year by tightening controls to assure that special
seat-lift chairs to help a patient stand up are medically necessary.
   Kusserow's office said it logged 1,278 successful prosecutions
last year and collected $81 million in fines and recoveries. It
also imposed 846 administrative sanctions during the period.
   In one of the largest settlements ever won by the department, a
medical device manufacturer in Florida paid $5.6 million civil
settlement with HHS and the Justice and Veteran Affairs
departments. The agreement resolved allegations that the company
manufacturered and distributed defective pacemakers.
   In another case, more than $2 million was recovered from a
number of Illinois hospitals that had billed the Medicare program
twice for the same services.

   Radicals who oppose expansion of Narita Airport
today hurled firebombs and bricks at police who fought back with
water cannon. One protester was arrested for blocking construction
work.
   About 5,000 riot police officers continued work begun Monday to
remove one of 10 huts built illegally on the site for a second
runway at the airport, 40 miles northeast of Tokyo.
   Yoshikazu Kawakami, 22, a member of the Battle Flag radical
leftist group, was arrested for defying a court injunction and
building a tower on the site, said officials of the Chiba
Prefectural Police.
   Four towers have been built and another member of the group was
arrested Monday on a similar charge, the officials said on
condition of anonymity.
   Five people atop the towers, each 49{ feet high, tossed
firebombs and bricks at police this morning, officials said. Police
fired water cannon and used cranes to lower steel cages onto the
towers to contain the hurled objects.
   Farmers and their supporters, including radicals seizing on the
issue for their anti-government activities, have been resisting the
government's plans to expropriate farmland to build the $2.5
billion runway.
   Pressure to complete the 8,250-foot runway is growing as
complaints of air-traffic congestion mount. The government hopes to
complete construction next year.

<HEAD>Serbia's Hard-line Leader Blasts Liberal Slovenia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The hard-line leader of the Serbian
republic today refused to re-establish political or business ties
with the republic of Slovenia until its liberal leaders step down.
   The speech was viewed as the harshest attack by a Yugoslav
politician on another constituent republic in 46 years of Communist
rule in this country.
   In an unprecedented move, Serbia on Wednesday cut all ties with
Slovenia after authorities there banned an anti-Slovenian rally
planned by Serbs on Dec. 1.
   Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, speaking in the Serbian
Parliament, today accused the Slovenian leadership of being
``brutal'' for not allowing the protest.
   Slovenia's liberal-oriented leadership advocates regional
autonomy and has already legalized several opposition parties that
are to take part in the first contested elections in postwar
Yugoslavia in March.
   The Serbian leadership favors a centralized federation and
opposes Western-style political pluralism.
   Last year, massive demonstrations orchestrated by Serbia toppled
leaderships in the republic of Montenegro and in the provinces of
Vojvodina and Kosovo. The leaders were replaced by Milosevic
supporters.
   Milosevic said his republic will not have ties with Slovenia
``until the conservative, aggressive and brutal forces make room
for what is democratic, peace-loving and brotherly in Slovenian
politics.''
   Slovenian politicians believe Milosevic wants to provoke a
showdown with Slovenia to impose his own brand of ideological
orthodoxy on all of Yugoslavia and prevent moves toward a
multi-party system.
   Yugoslavia has for years been a socialist showcase despite its
one-party system, with a comparatively free press and no travel
restrictions.
   But its political, economic and social problems have mushroomed
since the death in 1980 of president Josip Broz Tito, who founded
the modern Yugoslav federation in 1943.

arguments. Picks up 3rd graf, `Horn said ....</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The attorney for a policeman who shot a black
motorcyclist pleaded with jurors today to consider only the facts
in the officer's manslaughter trial, not the impact their verdict
might have on race relations.
   The city has girded itself against a repeat of the racial
violence that raged for three days after Colombian-born officer
William Lozano, 31, shot and killed Clement Lloyd on Jan. 16 as the
motorcyclist sped away from a patrol car. Lloyd's passenger, Allan
Blanchard, died of injuries suffered in the motorcycle crash.
   ``This case has nothing to do with racial prejudice,'' said
defense attorney Roy Black, giving his closing argument in a low,
measured tone. ``Your verdict has meaning only in its truth to the
case and its effects on a police officer. No one here is trying to
cause any further problems, all we are seeking is the truth in this
case.''
   Earlier, the prosecution argued that Lozano could have avoided a
confrontation before the shooting. It ``was not a life-or-death
situation'' for Lozano, prosecutor Don Horn told jurors. ``It was
not a split-second decision.''
   Horn said all of the prosecution witnesses had heard the
motorcycle approaching from at least a block away, while Lozano
claimed he never noticed it until it was almost upon him.
   ``He stepped out there, he decided he was going to shoot, and he
shot,'' Horn said. ``All he had to do was step behind the police
car.''
   Lozano is charged with two counts of manslaughter and faces a
maximum of 30 years in jail on each count.
   Jurors would have to decide if Lozano acted as a ``reasonably
cautious and prudent police officer,'' Horn said.
   Horn then reviewed arguments on both sides with the intent of
showing that Lozano was not threatened by the motorcyclist and did
not have to shoot him in self-defense.
   Attorneys predicted the case could be in the hands of the jurors
by the end of the day.
   On two previous occasions in this decade, riots broke out when
white officers were acquitted in the slayings of blacks.
   Prosecutors say Lloyd fired unnecessarily as the motorcycle
passed him at a safe distance. The defense argues that Lozano fired
only at the last second to protect his life as the motorcycle bore
down on him in the wrong lane.
   Jurors heard from almost 60 witnesses after testimony began Nov.
15. The trial opened Oct. 23, but it took more than three weeks to
seat a jury of two blacks, one Hispanic and three non-Hispanic
whites.
   Following the close of testimony Monday, the judge and lawyers
for both sides hashed out instructions to be given to the jury
before deliberations.
   The prosecution won efforts to exclude much of Florida's
``fleeing felon'' law from the instructions. The law allows police
to fire on suspected criminals, but Dade Circuit Judge Joseph
Farina disallowed it on grounds that Lozano never testified he was
trying to make an arrest at the time of the shooting.
   The defense, won an instruction that if Lloyd was committing
aggravated assault _ which can include causing a ``well-founded
fear'' of death or injury _ Lozano could be found innocent for
shooting him.
   Defense attorneys rested their case earlier Monday after rolling
a Kawasaki Ninja motorcycle similar to Lloyd's into the courtroom.
   Attorney Mark Seiden had an expert testify about the cycle's
measurements to show the bullet could have entered Lloyd's head at
an angle _ as the autopsy showed _ even if the bike was headed
directly at the officer.
   The defense also put officer Felix Martinez on the stand to
testify about a 1988 incident in which Lozano allegedly forced a
man's head into the officer's chest during an argument. The
prosecution claims the incident shows Lozano had a hot temper when
his authority was challenged, but the defense claims the story was
made up.
   The motorcycle shooting occurred on Martin Luther King's
birthday as Miami began a week of celebration leading up to the
Super Bowl. Lozano and his partner Dawn Campbell were stopped on a
street in a black neighborhood.
   Another squad car was chasing down Lloyd's motorcycle, which
raced past the street where Lozano stood. The officer fired one
shot, killing Lloyd instantly and sending the motorcycle crashing
into a car.
   Within an hour after the shooting, an angry crowd gathered at
the scene and began pelting officers with rocks and bottles.
   The violence spread. By the time it ended three days later, one
looter had been shot to death, 11 people were wounded by gunfire
and 13 buildings were burned down in the Overtown and Liberty City
neighborhoods.

<HEAD>Italian Nuclear Physicist Dead at 81</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Edoardo Amaldi, considered one of the fathers of
Italian physics and a pioneer in nuclear research, died Tuesday at
the age of 81.
   Amaldi fell ill at the Lincei Academy, a Rome research institute
of which he was president, and died a short while later at a nearby
hospital, officials said. The exact cause of death was not
announced.
   Born in 1908 in Carpaneto Fiorentino in the Emilia-Romagna
region of northern Italy, Amaldi studied under physicist Enrico
Fermi, winner of the Nobel Prize in 1938 for his research on
nuclear fission.
   Amaldi served for 41 years as a physics professor at the
University of Rome.
   He was a driving force in the creation of the Geneva-based
European Council for Nuclear Research, now called the European
Laboratory for Particle Physics. He was secretary general of the
organization from 1952-54.
   From 1958-59, Amaldi was president of the scientific and
technical committee of the European Atomic Energy Community.
   Funeral services were scheduled for Thursday.

   A virus from abroad has entered a computer system
at Osaka University but caused no major disturbance, an official
said Tuesday.
   The virus was detected Oct. 19 in one of four computers linked
to a high energy physics network that also includes the United
States and Europe, said Shojiro Sugimoto, an official at the school
in western Japan. The virus was removed immediately and there was
no major damage to computers, he said.
   A virus, apparently from abroad, also was detected in computers
at Tokyo University's Atomic Nucleus Research Institute and Tokyo
Metropolitan University, but there were no reports of major damage,
the Japan Broadcasting Corp. reported Tuesday.
   Computer viruses, created by unknown programmers, are pieces of
software that reproduce themselves and spread from one machine to
another through infected floppy disks, office networks or telephone
lines. They erode a computer's processing power and storage space,
or destroy information.
   A virus disrupted computers at the University of Tokyo's
seismological and ocean research institutes in October. That virus
infected only personal computers being used by researchers, and not
major computer systems.

<HEAD>Nuremberg War Crimes Prosecutor Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lord Elwyn-Jones, a prosecutor at the Nuremberg
war crimes trials and Britain's chief legal officer under the last
Labor Party government, has died of cancer at the age of 80.
   He died at his home in Brighton on Monday night, said his son,
Dan.
   Elwyn-Jones remained active in politics until his death, and
attended the ceremonial opening of Parliament last month. He had
been scheduled to be in the House of Lords on Monday to give
Labor's views on whether the government should permit the
prosecution of alleged Nazi war criminals living in Britain.
   ``The memories of Nuremberg are still vivid in my memory,'' he
said in July. ``The millions deliberately put to death _ that
cannot be passed over as a mere aberration which should be
forgotten in the mere tide of history.''
   He was born Frederick Elwyn-Jones in Wales in 1909, the son of a
frequently unemployed steelworker. He was educated at the
University of Wales and then Cambridge University, where he was
president of the Cambridge Union, the debating society. He became a
lawyer in 1935.
   Elwyn-Jones came to national prominence as a member of the
British War Crimes Executive at Nuremberg in 1945 where he was a
prosecutor at the Nazi trials.
   He was elected to the House of Commons in 1945, and was Attorney
General in Prime Minister Harold Wilson's government from 1964-70
and Lord High Chancellor, the country's top law officer, from
1974-79. He received a peerage and moved to the unelected House of
Lords in 1974.
   Elwyn-Jones was the senior counsel for the tribunal of inquiry
into the 1966 collapse of a coal slag heap in the Welsh village of
Aberfan that killed 116 children and 28 adults.
   He was a government adviser during the 1966 crisis brought on by
Rhodesia's unilateral declaration of independence, and attended
unsuccessful talks with Wilson and Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian
Smith aboard the Royal Navy cruiser HMS Tiger off Gibraltar.
   In 1984, he presided at a mock televised trial that found King
Richard III innocent of the murder of The Little Princes, the two
teen-age nephews he put in the Tower of London because they stood
between him and the throne.
   Elwyn-Jones is survived by his wife, three children and nine
grandchildren.
   A private funeral is planned, with a memorial service to be held
later.

<TEXT>
   Voters in this West African country go to
the polls Sunday in presidential and legislative elections that are
the first since independence from France in 1960.
   About 3 million voters are expected at the polls to elect 93
deputies to parliament, as well as whether to keep President Ali
Saibou in office. Saibou faces no opposition.
   In 1987, voters approved a national charter that served as the
basis for a constitution that was approved Sept. 24 in this
landlocked nation of about 7 million people in the Sahara north of
Nigeria and south of Libya.
   Under the new constitution, Niger's president serves a
seven-year term.
   The new document is the first since the previous constitution
was suspended in 1974 by Gen. Seyni Kountche who took power in a
military coup during a devastating drought. After Kountche's death
in 1987, Saibou, the former head of Niger's military, was elected
leader by the ruling Supreme Military Council.
   Saibou freed about 100 people imprisoned for coup plots against
Kountche.
   In 1988, Saibou announced the creation of a political party, the
National Movement for a Society of Development. It remains the sole
party and its leader becomes the only candidate for the presidency.
   Saibou, 49, has pledged to put Niger on the path of food
self-sufficiency.

   Police used tear gas Tuesday to break up
a demonstration over the fatal wounding of a university student who
fought with a classmate over campus elections.
   The fight was linked to Khartoum University's student union
elections last week that were won by the Islamic Trend, a Moslem
fundamentalist aggregation.
   Bashir el-Tayeb Ibrahim, who was stabbed to death Monday, was a
member of the Democratic Students' Alliance, which supported
political parties that were disbanded earlier this year.
   Khartoum District Attorney Salah el-Din Tag el-Din said the
suspected killer, who is at large, belonged to the Moslem
fundamentalist group.
   The demonstration that followed the killing was dispersed
quickly, but the campus remained tense.
   A military junta overthrew Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi's
civilian government June 30 and dissolved all political parties,
labor unions and professional organizations.

<HEAD>Sudanese Peace Talks Collapse Over Islamic Law Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By REID G. MILLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peace talks between rebels and the
Sudanese government collapsed Tuesday in disagreement over the
country's Islamic legal code and other issues that have kept them
at war for nearly seven years.
   ``In my opinion, neither side came to Nairobi prepared to take
the difficult steps necessary for peace,'' said former President
Jimmy Carter, who acted as an unofficial mediator in the five days
of negotiations.
   ``Both sides, at the end, seemed ready to emphasize their
differences, postpone further action and let the war continue,''
Carter said. ``There is no telling how many hundreds of thousands
of people will die because these two sides have failed to reach an
agreement.''
   Both Carter and Lam Akol, the chief negotiator for the Sudan
People's Liberation Army, said the talks broke down mainly over the
government's failure to address the question of Sudan's Sharia law,
a harsh Islamic legal code.
   The government's chief spokesman, Abdel Samie Omer Ahmed,
disagreed. He said the talks had not broken down but were merely
postponed to give his delegation a chance to confer with the
government.
   No date was given for further negotiations.
   Carter said he proposed the Sudanese government set aside the
Sharia law from the beginning of a cease-fire until the convening
of a constitutional conference to write a new, basic framework of
law for the African nation.
   ``If the government would do that, and only that, I believe
peace would come,'' Carter said. ``I'm not asking them to cancel
it, to abrogate it. I'm just asking them to set it aside for a few
months.''
   He said the rebels had agreed to abide by Sharia law if it were
established as part of the legal code by a broad-based
constitutional convention.
   The chief rebel negotiator said the two sides also had
``fundamental divergences'' on the state of emergency in effect in
Sudan since 1983 and the country's military pacts with Egypt and
Libya.
   But Akol made it clear the rebels view the Islamic law, which
imposes such penalties as cutting off a hand for petty theft, as
the chief stumbling block.
   ``They have to move on Sharia law,'' he said.
   The rebels took up arms in 1983 to press the Moslem-dominated
government for greater political autonomy and larger economic
benefits for the largely Christian southern half of Sudan.
   The war has brought widespread famine to the south. The United
Nations estimated that 250,000 people died in the region in 1988.

   The chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee says he will begin hearings on the 1990 farm bill in
January with a session on groundwater problems and he wants the
Environmental Protection Agency to have proposals in hand.
   ``I want them to have specific recommendations,'' Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., said Monday after meeting with EPA administrator
William Reilly.
   Leahy said he intended to move the farm bill quickly and wants
it to contain groundwater provisions when it passes the Senate.
   ``I want answers. I don't want to say we're studying it,'' he
said.
   Leahy has been critical of EPA's performance in protecting
groundwater, which is the source of drinking water for many
Americans who use wells.
   ``I am particularly concerned about the well-documented
contamination from nitrates and pesticides,'' Leahy said. ``It is
time for the administration to get off the dime to solve this
pressing problem.''

   The National Family Farm Coalition has a
proposal for the 1990 farm bill it says would strengthen family
farms while eliminating the need for deficiency payment subsidies.
   At a news conference Monday, members of the coalition presented
a plan that also would encourage sustainable agriculture, or what
is commonly called organic farming.
   ``For grain handlers and shippers, and for food processors, the
1985 farm bill has ensured record profits,'' said the coalition's
statement. ``For over 400,000 farm and ranch families who left the
land between 1985 and 1988 and their rural communities, that farm
program has been a disaster.''
   The coalition says their model farm bill would:
   _Allow farmers to earn their income from the marketplace by
raising price support levels to cover the cost of production.
   _Establish a farmer commodity reserve that would ensure against
natural disaster and cushion the economic risk of changing from
chemical to sustainable methods.
   _Ensure through production management and a commodity reserve a
stable supply of grain for domestic, foreign trade and food
assistance programs.
   ``There is a growing concern among farmers, consumers and in
Congress that farm commodities be grown with few chemicals,'' said
the coalition's statement.
   The group's proposal would give farmers a two- to five-year
economic cushion while switching from herbicides and pesticides to
sustainable methods through access to reserve crops.

   The National Resources Inventory shows that
sheet and rill erosion on cropland decreased by a half-ton per acre
nationwide between 1982 and 1987, dropping from 4.3 tons to 3.8
tons per acre a year.
   However, wind erosion on cropland increased 0.1 ton per acre to
3.3 tons per acre a year, said the report from the Agriculture
Department's soil conservation service that was issued Monday.
   According to the data, sheet and rill erosion nationwide totals
1.6 billion tons per year and wind erosion 1.4 billion tons
annually.
   The survey ``reveals impressive gains for soil conservation,''
said the Center for Resource Economics, a Washington-based
non-profit environmental research and publishing organization.
   But the research also shows that soil erosion is still a serious
problem, it said in a statement.
   ``From everything we know about land use in the mid-1970s,
erosion conditions worsened with the onset of the export boom,''
said Ken Cook, vice president of the center.
   He said analysis of the survey data may show that the
improvement in erosion control is due substantially to massive
idling of cropland under government programs between 1984 and 1987.
   The Agriculture Department said the report does not reflect the
work under way on about 140 million acres of highly erodible land
as part of the conservation provisions of the 1985 farm law.

<HEAD>Armenians Surround Legislators, Call Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armenians trapped their lawmakers in their
chambers for hours today and then went on strike to demand stronger
action against Moscow's bid to end a territorial dispute, an
activist said.
   Thousands of people surrounded the Supreme Soviet chambers in
Yerevan, the Armenian capital, Monday night and refused to let the
lawmakers out until 5 a.m., Karen Shakhbazyan said.
   When only 49 of 315 legislators showed up five hours later for
the morning legislative session, Yerevan factory workers went on
strike, he said by telephone from the city.
   The lawmakers spent Monday debating a proposal to drop the words
``Soviet Socialist'' from Armenia's official name and call it
simply the ``Armenian Republic.''
   The legislators did not decide that issue, or a call for them to
boycott a session of the national Congress of People's Deputies
when it meets in Moscow Dec. 12.
   ``The people are demanding that they decide the issue,''
Shakhbazyan said.
   Many Armenians want the lawmakers to boycott the national
legislative session in defiance of Moscow's position over the
disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region.
   Last week, the Armenian legislature declared the republic would
annex the enclave, which is predominantly Armenian and Christian
but part of neighboring Azerbaijan, which is mostly Moslem.
   Nagorno-Karabakh is called an autonomous region but it is
supposed to obey the Azerbaijan government.
   Dozens of people have been killed in the past 18 months in
violence stemming from the territorial dispute.
   Moscow is unlikely to recognize the Armenian annexation.
   The federal Supreme Soviet put Nagorno-Karabakh under the direct
rule of Moscow last year but did away with that arrangement on Nov.
28.
   It directed Azerbaijan to work with local officials to solve
mounting social, economic and political problems in the enclave.
Both Armenians and Azerbaijanis have said they are dissatisfied
with that decision.

   The economic damage from the ongoing
coup attempt will last well beyond the final echoes of rival troops
exchanging gunfire in the heart of the embattled Makati financial
district.
   Less than a week after rebel soldiers launched a bid to topple
President Corazon Aquino, officials are talking about serious
damage to efforts to attract foreign investment to this struggling
nation.
   ``The cost (of the attempted coup) was high not only in life and
property, but in terms of investments,'' said Sen. John Osmena.
``Tourism will dry up for the next year. The economic recovery has
been stalled.''
   Political unrest is never good news for national economies. But
this sixth coup attempt against Mrs. Aquino's government spells
particular trouble because the main battlefield has been the
country's financial center, including three luxury hotels filled
with wealthy foreign guests.
   The country's two stock exchanges are located in Makati and have
been unable to operate since the coup attempt began Friday.
Business sources say the exchanges are considering waiting a day or
two after order is restored before reopening for fear that share
prices in the opening hours will collapse.
   Banks and shopping centers in Makati are believed to have
suffered substantial damage in recent fighting, which broke out
during what should have been the height of the Christmas sales rush.
   Among the foreigners held hostage in Makati hotels are leading
Taiwan industrialists, including Jeffrey Koo, the powerful
president of the China Trust Co. Ltd., and Japanese investors, the
type of people with the capital needed to help fuel fuel economic
growth in the Philippines.
   ``The Japanese have really been terrorized there (in Makati),''
House Speaker Ramon Mitra said Monday. ``Many of them are
investors, can you imagine the damage this will bring?''
   Sony Corp. of Japan has said the company may postpone
construction of an audio equipment plant if the Philippines seems
headed for more instability.
   Manila can ill afford squeamishness on the part of cash-rich
Taiwan, which had $133 million in approved investment in the
Philippines in the first three quarters of 1989, up from $109
million for all of 1988.
   ``If the situation continues to deteriorate, the major investors
may withdraw their investment,'' Chi Min-shen, an official of
Taiwan's official Industrial Deveopment and Investment Center said
in Taipei on Tuesday.
   Taiwan businessmen ``would not risk their lives for whatever
incentives or privileges are offered,'' he said, referring to tax
breaks and market access concessions that Manila offers to attract
overseas investors.
   The Manila fighting also comes just after Mrs. Aquino's trip to
Canada and the United States to seek new investment. In her many
appearances before North American business groups, Mrs. Aquino
assured would-be investors the Philippines was stable, even as her
adversaries were finalizing plans for a coup.
   Last week, Mrs. Aquino said: ``Foreign investment is increasing
because the message has got through that the country is politically
stable and the daily danger of coups is long past.''
   In fact, the Philippines has chalked up some respectable
economic statistics. In the first nine months of 1989, the real
gross domestic product rose 6 percent from the same period a year
earlier.
   Investing in the country can be profitable. The Hong Kong-based
Jardine Fleming's Philippine Trust rose 183 percent in the first 10
months this year and more than 2,000 percent in the past five years.
   Manila and other Southeast Asian capitals have long sought to
parlay cheap labor and abundant natural resources to create their
own economic miracles to follow the trailblazing path set by Asia's
dynamic ``little dragons'' of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and
Singapore.
   To what degree the coup attempt will derail such plans remains
to be seen. Philippine officials clearly hope the damage can be
contained.
   ``There is no doubt that investments will be affected as a
result of the events that have transpired, but I would like to look
at that as something temporary,'' said Trade Secretary Jose
Concepcion. ``We have to give assurances to foreign investors that
this is the last coup.''

<HEAD>Mladenov Says Leading Role of Communist Party an Open Question</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bulgaria's new Communist leader indicated today
that his party's leading role in government will be an open
question as he initiates reforms.
   ``This will have to be decided upon by the Bulgarian people,''
Petar Mladenov told a news conference in Moscow.
   The Bulgarian Constitution now guarantees the Communists a
leading role in society.
   ``It's difficult for me to predict in what particular way this
issue will be resolved, but I foresee changes in the
constitution,'' Mladenov said.
   He said a constitutional commission of which he is chairman will
make recommendations to Bulgaria's Parliament at the end of the
month.
   The Communist parties of some of Bulgaria's East bloc partners,
including Czechoslovakia and East Germany, have given up their
constitutional monopoly on power in the face of popular demands for
democratic reforms.
   Mladenov took over as Communist leader on Nov. 10, ending 35
years of rule by Todor Zhivkov.
   Mladenov attended the Warsaw Pact meeting held Monday in Moscow
and stayed on for talks with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
He said relations with Moscow were good and should improve.
   Bulgaria's media have become increasingly open since Zhivkov's
ouster, publishing interviews with leading dissident intellectuals.
   The nation's army newspaper today published an interview with an
opposition figure who said Bulgaria's one-party system was
totalitarianism.
   ``Socialism does not exist anywhere in the world,'' said Zhelyu
Zhelev, the acting leader of the independent Club for the Support
of Glasnost and Perestroika _ a reference to Gorbachev's program
for openness and social and economic change.
   The Narodna Armia newspaper also quoted Zhelev as saying:
``There is no new model of production that is more progressive than
capitalism.''

   Israel's jets raided Palestinian
guerrilla bases Tuesday, its surrogate militia shelled towns in
south Lebanon, and fighting between rival Shiite Moslem militias
spread to Beirut.
   President Elias Hrawi said he would ask Syria to withdraw the
40,000 soldiers it stations in Lebanon if his new government can
establish authority over a nation factionalized by 14 years of
sectarian civil war.
   Police said 20 people were wounded in fighting between the
Syrian-backed Shiite militia Amal and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or
Party of God, in Beirut and south Lebanon.
   Four warplanes attacked Palestinian bases near Sidon, provincial
capital of south Lebanon, in Israel's 17th air raid into Lebanon
this year. Police said seven people were wounded.
   The South Lebanon Army, a predominantly Christian militia that
helps Israel patrol its border ``security zone'' in south Lebanon,
shelled the Shiite market town of Nabatiyeh and nearby Hadatha
village with 155mm howitzers. Eleven people were reported wounded.
   Police said the Israeli planes hit bases used by guerrillas of
terrorist Abu Nidal and the Syrian-backed Palestine Liberation
Front on the northern edge of the Majdalioun Valley, east of Sidon.
   A clinic operated by the Soviet-backed Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine also was damaged in the raid at 11:45 a.m.,
police reported.
   South Lebanon Army opened fire on Nabatiyeh and Hadatha a few
minutes later.
   Police said 20 shells landed in Hadatha, eight miles north of
the border with Israel, wounding 10 civilians. Hadatha is policed
by Nepalese units of the 5,800-member U.N. Interim Force in
Lebanon, to which nine nations contribute soldiers.
   Militia gunners also fired intermittently at Nabatiyeh and the
surrounding area, wounding a woman, said a police spokesman, whose
name was withheld because of regulations.
   Funeral processions for five people killed in similar shelling
Monday were blocked by the shelling. Ambulances carrying the bodies
could not enter Kfar Rumman village on Nabatiyeh's northern edge.
   ``They waited all day,'' the police spokesman said, and
``finally, the victims were buried in Deir Zahrani,'' six miles to
the west.
   Security sources in south Lebanon said Hezbollah fighters
responded to the shelling by firing four rockets into Marjayoun, a
Christian border town where the Israeli-allied militia has its
headquarters.
   Lebanon protested the shelling to the U.N. Security Council,
blaming the attacks on Israel, the Foreign Ministry said.
   Amal, which lost control of Sohmor, Yohmor and Mashgara villages
in the Bekaa Valley to Hezbollah in overnight fighting, was
regrouping, apparently for a counterattack.
   Syrian soldiers police the valley in east Lebanon. They stayed
out of the battle, but scores were deployed Tuesday at an Amal base
at the northern entrance to Mashgara.
   According to the police spokesman, Amal ``has lost all its
positions in the western sector of the Bekaa.''
   Two civilians were slightly wounded by shrapnel during
skirmishes in Christian east Beirut between Syrian-backed militias
and the Christian troops of Gen. Michel Aoun, who fought a
six-month artillery war with Syrian troops this year.
   Shooting across the no man's land between east Beirut and the
Moslem western sector panicked residents of the capital, who fear
the political crisis between the Hrawi and Aoun, both Christians,
could bring another round of artillery warfare.
   Aoun contends Parliament's election of Hrawi, with Syrian
support, was unconstitutional and refuses to vacate his
headquarters bunker beneath the presidential palace in Baabda, a
Christian suburb east of Beirut.
   He also rejects the peace plan Hrawi is trying to implement
because it does not include a timetable for withdrawal of the
Syrians, whom he describes as an occupation army.
   Streets were deserted after the first few rounds of gunfire
across the line at midday. Syrian troops manning west Beirut
checkpoints took cover behind sandbag barricades and many residents
ran straight to bomb shelters.
   In an interview published by the independent daily newspaper
An-Nahar, Hrawi said, ``I will ask the Syrian army to withdraw from
areas that the (government) can gain authority over.'' He said this
would be done ``after the extraordinary situation in the eastern
areas is over.''
   By ``eastern areas,'' he meant the 310-square-mile enclave north
and east of Beirut where about 1 million Christians live and Aoun's
soldiers are in control.
   Syrian soldiers are in Lebanon under a peacekeeping mandate
issued by the Arab League in 1976, one year after the beginning of
a civil war that has cost more than 150,000 lives.

<HEAD>White House Officials Play Down Differences Between Bush, Quayle</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 10 grafs new with White House statements; picks up 4th graf
pvs, Quayle has taken.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White House officials said today ``there is no
policy difference'' between President Bush and Vice President Dan
Quayle over the intentions of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``We have an administration that is very closely aligned, but I
think it's probably not possible for people to speak literally with
one voice, and there may be a difference in perspective, but
there's no difference with the policies we're pursuing,'' National
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft told reporters.
   Quayle, in an interview, seemed to take a more negative view of
the Soviet Union than Bush, telling The Washington Post that the
Kremlin's foreign policy does not appear to have changed despite
improved relations with the West.
   ``You're still dealing with a totalitarian government'' that
wants to ``create instability'' in other nations, Quayle said in
the interview published today.
   His comments came a day after Bush returned from his
Mediterranean summit meeting with Gorbachev and said that in view
of developments, the West must adopt ``new thinking'' toward the
Soviets.
   ``My viewpoint is the new thinking and the real reform is in the
area of economics. I don't think they've changed much in foreign
policy,'' Quayle said.
   ``There is no policy difference'' between the two men, Scowcroft
said.
   He and White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater pointed out
that Bush remained critical of the Soviet role in Central America.
   Scowcroft said he was convinced there was no confusion on the
part of Gorbachev as to what is U.S. policy.
   Fitzwater said Bush and Quayle had discussed the Post interview
this morning when they met, but that Bush ``doesn't feel there's
any need for concern.''
   Quayle has taken a tougher line in the past in his public
comments on the Soviet Union than other administration officials
and the interview contrasted with Bush's generally upbeat
assessment of the weekend's superpower summit.
   Quayle told the Post the Soviets have ``very significant
interests beyond their borders and those interests create
instability.
   ``We cannot count on the Soviets, out of the goodness of their
hearts, in alleviating those tensions for us.''
   But Quayle said he viewed continuing changes in Eastern Europe
as reflecting Soviet domestic policy.
   Though Gorbachev has been very helpful in spurring Communist
governments in Eastern Europe to reform, `I don't view that as a
matter of foreign policy as much as domestic policy.''
   But Quayle said he ``hadn't seen any evidence of their
slackening off'' aid to Cuba and Nicaragua.
   On the summit meeting of President Bush and Gorbachev, Quayle
said he thought a strategic arms agreement `is something that could
be achieved'' on the timetable agreed to by the two leaders.
   Bush told a news conference in Brussels on Monday the West
stands ``at the threshold of a new era'' but he declined to endorse
Gorbachev's suggestion that the Cold War is over. ``That day hasn't
arrived,'' Bush said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. announced
today it would cut 10,000 U.S. jobs without layoffs as it copes
with slow growth in the U.S. market.
   The world's largest computer company said it would set aside
$2.3 billion from its pre-tax earnings for the fourth-quarter to
cover costs of employee buyouts and restructuring. IBM said it
would reduce its staff by limiting hiring and offering incentives
to employees to quit or retire early.
   The company did not announce any closings of facilities and John
Akers, the chairman and chief executive, said he did not expect any.
   IBM also announced a program to buy back up to $4 billion of its
own stock, which has lost more than a third of its value since its
1987 peak.
   With the company cost-cutting to improve profitability, IBM's
stock rose $2 a share to $101.25 at midday today on the New York
Stock Exchange after a $2.12{ a share rise on Monday, when
speculation intensified that the company planned to cut jobs.
   The stock's peak price was $175.87{ in August 1987.
   IBM expanded dramatically in the early 1980s but has been
cutting back since 1985, when it became apparent that the
industry's rapid 15 percent annual growth was slowing.
   IBM said its growth overseas was strong, but the U.S. business
still was growing more slowly than desired.
   ``The actions we are describing today underscore our ongoing
resolve to make IBM the most competitive information processing
business in an industry that continues to grow,'' Akers said in a
statement.
   IBM has a 40-year tradition of no layoffs. In a meeting today
with securities analysts, Akers said the company intended to keep
that tradition because it helped the company maintain a
high-quality, flexible and dedicated workforce.
   He added, ``It's impossible to guarantee for all time full
employment under any and all circumstances.''
   The company said its $4 billion stock buyback, in combination
with a $1 billion buyback authorized in October, if completed would
bring total repurchases since mid-1986 to more than $10.5 billion.
That amounts to about 15 percent of the shares outstanding at that
time _ possibly the biggest repurchase program ever undertaken.
   The job cuts are intended to reduce the company's U.S. workforce
to 206,000 by the end of 1990, a reduction of more than 37,000 from
1985 levels.
   The $2.3 billion pre-tax charge against fourth-quarter earnings
breaks down as follows:
   _$500 million for separation payments to people leaving the
company.
   _$500 million for accounting changes to speed up the way IBM
logs its payment for software and technology investments.
   _$1.3 billion for restructuring, including consolidations,
capacity reductions and cuts in the valuation of special
investments such as share ownership in other companies.

   A man wearing a Santa Claus suit sang
``We Wish You a Merry Christmas'' as he held up a bank, dashing
away with an undetermined amount of money.
   ``You always see Santa Claus walking around this time of year,''
West Goshen Township police Officer Richard Geiger said. ``No one
thinks anything of it. If it happened in July, that would be a
different story.''
   Geiger said the pseudo-Santa entered a Fidelity Bank branch
Monday afternoon, waited in line with other customers, then told
the teller he was there to present a singing telegram.
   The robber then handed the teller a red plastic bag with
drawstrings and pictures of Santa. His note instructed the teller
to place cash in the bag until he was finished with his song,
police said.
   Geiger said the amount of money taken had not been determined.

<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury today indicted two
associates of Jim Bakker for lying during the PTL fraud
investigation.
   Sam Johnson, former minister at Heritage Village Church, was
charged with 12 counts of perjury for his testimony about a $10,000
check that was part of $265,000 in hush money paid to former church
secretary Jessica Hahn.
   Evangelist John Wesley Fletcher was charged with one count of
perjury for his testimony about how Bakker was introduced to Miss
Hahn.
   ``There will be no further PTL-related indictments coming out
this grand jury,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller.
   Fletcher introduced Bakker to Miss Hahn before their sexual
encounter at a Florida motel room. Reports that Bakker used
ministry funds to pay Miss Hahn to keep quiet about the liaison led
to Bakker's resignation in March 1987.
   Johnson, who runs Heritage Ministries of Charlotte, the
non-profit ministry created by a federal bankruptcy court after the
decline of PTL, was not immediately available for comment. His
secretary, Pam Jewett, said Johnson was taping a Christmas TV
special at a resort in the North Carolina mountains.
   ``We were very surprised'' by the indictment, she said.
   Fletcher, who was arrested twice within four hours last week on
drunken driving charges in Durham, where he lives, could not be
immediately located for comment.
   The indictments were issued about three hours after Richard
Dortch, Jim Bakker's former second-in-command at the bankrupt
ministry, arrived at the federal courthouse.
   Dortch, who pleaded guilty in August to fraud and conspiracy
charges for his role in the PTL affair, would not comment on the
grand jury as he entered the courthouse with his son, Richard
Dortch Jr.
   Asked if he would talk with reporters after his appearance,
Dortch said, ``Silence is wisdom.'' Dortch's attorney, Mark
Calloway, also made no comment.
   As expected, the new grand jury probe focused on people who
allegedly committed perjury in appearances before the special grand
jury that indicted Dortch and Bakker a year ago. The original
indictments in the PTL case were handed down on Dec. 5, 1988.
   Bakker is serving a 45-year term in a federal prison in
Minnesota after being convicted of fraud and conspiracy charges.
Bakker is appealing the conviction, but a panel of the 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals refused to free Bakker on bond while the
appeal was prepared.
   On Oct. 5, Bakker was convicted by a jury on all 24 counts of
fraud and conspiracy for bilking faithful followers who sent him
$158 million for ``partnerships'' in the ministry entitling them to
annual lodging guarantees. Prosecutors said Bakker diverted $3.7
million in PTL money to buy expensive homes, cars, jewelry and
vacations.
   Dortch was sentenced to eight years in prison and fined
$200,000. His plea agreement enables the former Assemblies of God
minister to remain free until federal authorities no longer require
his cooperation. The plea agreement for Dortch included a provision
that he would be required to report to prison no sooner than Jan.
15 as long as he cooperated with prosecutors.
   The fate of the ministry's Heritage USA religious theme park and
hotel complex is in the hands of a bankruptcy court judge in
Columbia, S.C. The complex, in Fort Mill, S.C., south of Charlotte,
has closed.

<HEAD>Return of Predatory Sea Lions From Seattle to California</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California sea lions that prey on steelhead and
salmon at a Seattle fish ladder could be caught and sent back to
breeding grounds off Southern California ahead of time this winter
under new government recommendations.
   Sea lions normally would eat their way through the winter, then
head south in the summer.
   An environmental assessment issued Monday by the National Marine
Fisheries Service and the Washington state Wildlife Department
favored capturing the sea lions at the Ballard locks and sending
them back to the Channel Islands, about 30 to 40 miles off Santa
Barbara, rather than doing nothing or killing the marine mammals.
   The report rejected killing, or the ``lethal removal
alternative,'' largely because of the need to prepare an
environmental impact statement and review potential legal, policy
and technical issues.
   ``Some segments of the public would be opposed to lethally
removing even a limited number of problem animals,'' the report
said.
   The animals find easy pickings at the bottom of a fish ladder at
the Ballard Lock, the sole passage for valuable salmon and
steelhead, a seagoing rainbow trout, to reach Lake Washington and
upstream spawning grounds.
   The 500- to 600-pound animals gorge themselves and severely
deplete the number of fish that succeed in getting upstream to
spawn. Even two to five sea lions ``can easily account for
predation of over 400 fish,'' the report said.
   Federal officials expect 40 to 60 sea lions would have to be
removed.
   The animals have flourished since passage of the federal Marine
Mammals Protection Act of 1972 and now number more than 177,000
animals.
   Removal would have so little impact that an environmental impact
statement is unnecessary, the report said.
   Efforts to preserve fish runs through the Lake Washington
Shipping Canal by using firecrackers, rubber bullets, nets, playing
of recorded sounds, harassment by boat and foul-tasting fish to
change the sea lions' dining preferences all have failed in recent
years.
   Last year 39 sea lions were trapped. Two died and the rest were
released near the mouth of the Columbia River.
   Thirteen returned to the locks, a journey of about 200 miles or
roughly one-fifth the distance between Seattle and the Channel
Islands, in an average of 15 days.
   Doing nothing would result in continued loss of as much as 70
percent of the number of wild steelhead needed for spawning in the
Sammamish and Cedar rivers, the study found.
   In 1988-89, sea lions let less than 700 fish through to spawn,
about 900 less than what wildlife officials set as a target.
   Joe Scordino of the federal agency said capture and removal to
California could begin by the end of the month or early January, at
a cost of as much as $150,000 to $175,000.
   Public comment on the plan is being solicited through Dec. 15,
but only court action or an administrative denial of funding could
block the effort, he said.
   In California, fishing interests and some state officials have
voiced strong opposition to the proposal. Rolland A. Schmitten,
Northwest regional director of the National Marine Fisheries
Service, said he hoped to persuade them the plan would have no more
than an inconsequential effect in their state.
   ``We don't want to ram anything down anybody's throat,''
Schmitten said.

<HEAD>Eds: Results of recount expected after 7 p.m. EST.</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nationalist government Tuesday was
forced to agree to recount an important race after the ruling
party's victory drew allegations of fraud and led to a clash
between police and opposition supporters.
   In Taipei, newspaper reports said about 12 percent of the votes
cast in Saturday's island-wide election were bogus. Central
Election Commission officials refused comment on the reports.
   The vote, the first multiparty election in Taiwan's history,
dealt the Nationalist Party its worst setback in 40 years in power.
Nationalists lost several important local elections and garnered 58
percent of the total vote, down from 70 percent in 1986.
   During the election and raucous campaign, the opposition party
accused the Nationalists of widespread vote buying and ballot box
stuffing.
   Those allegations were strongest in Tainan, a largely
agricultural county in southern Taiwan, where a Nationalist and an
opposition Democratic Progressive Party candidate were in a close
race for the county executive post, one of the highest elected
offices in Taiwan.
   About 10,000 opposition supporters screaming for a recount
packed a square next to county government offices in Tainan on
Tuesday.
   Club-wielding protesters discovered five plainclothes policemen
in their midst and beat them, police said. The officers, disguised
as journalists, were stripped of their cameras, which were tossed
into a nearby swimming pool, police said.
   Police grabbed and beat one protester with clubs.
   Witnesses said several protesters were injured. Police said at
least two people were hospitalized.
   The crowd soon swelled as thousands of protesters armed with
clubs and stones flocked to the square. About 2,000 riot police
cordoned off the square and set up water cannons.
   Huang Hsin-chieh, chairman of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, went to Tainan and asked the county government
for a recount of the roughly 200,000 votes.
   After hours of negotiations, the government agreed to a recount
in the presence of opposition officials. Officials said the outcome
would be known Wednesday.
   According to official results, Nationalist candidate Lee
Ya-chiao defeated opposition candidate Lee Tsung-fan by 9,000 votes.
   County executives wield wide powers over police, schools and the
economy of their constituencies and are among the highest elected
officials here.
   In Saturday's voting, the opposition won six of 15 county
executive seats, not including the controversial Tainan seat. In
1986, the opposition won two.
   In the capital, newspaper reports said 814,000 votes were
invalidated. Fewer than 7 million people voted.
   In the central city of Nantou, about 400 demonstrators ended an
overnight sit-in Tuesday after authorities promised an
investigation of alleged vote buying.
   A Nationalist official, Wu Tun-yi, said he would ``disembowel
myself if there was any vote rigging.''

Republican candidates and participate in anti-drug events in two of
the cities, the White House said Tuesday.
   Bush will visit the Acres Homes War on Drugs Committee in
Houston, a group fighting drug trafficking in a public housing
project. Drug policy director William Bennett visited the group
recently to applaud its success in taking back a park from dope
peddlers.
   Bush will attend a fund-raising dinner that night in the
cavernous Astrodome for Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, noting the size of the
arena, quippad, ``The senator's pretty optimistic on this one.''
   Larry Neal, a spokesman for Gramm, said, ``somewhere in excess
of 2,500 people'' are expected at the dinner. ``It's on the floor
of the Astrodome,'' said Neal, adding that if they used the seats,
``you could pack in 40,000 to 50,000 more.''
   Bush will spend the night in Houston, his legal residence, then
fly Friday morning to Denver to appear at a luncheon for Rep. Hank
Brown, R-Colo., who is running for the Senate seat that Sen. Bill
Armstrong, a fellow Republican, is vacating next year.
   Bush will also take part in an anti-drug rally with players from
the Denver Broncos football team at John K. Kennedy High School in
Denver, then fly to Des Moines to speak at a fund-raising dinner
for Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa. Tauke is considering a run next year
for the seat of Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa.
   Bush will helicopter to Camp David, Md., for the weekend after
returning to Andrews AFB late Friday night.

   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki said
Tuesday he was glad the Warsaw Pact alliance has condemned its 1968
invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   Mazowiecki, a Solidarity activist and former political prisoner,
on Monday became the first non-communist government chief to take
part in a Warsaw Pact summit. He represented Poland at the meeting
in Moscow along with communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski and
non-communist Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski.
   The meeting, held as tumultuous reforms spread through the East
bloc, included a briefing from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on
the weekend summit with President Bush in Malta.
   Mazowiecki, a Roman Catholic, said in an interview with the
state PAP news agency that Gorbachev also expressed ``high
respect'' for Polish-born Pope John Paul II, with whom he had an
unprecedented meeting in Rome on Friday.
   ``Mr. Gorbachev put a great emphasis on the fact that it had
been a very, very interesting meeting for him,'' Mazowiecki said.
   Jaruzelski, commenting to PAP on the Warsaw Pact meeting, said:
``It is true the participants were different to a large extent _
the leaderships have changed in many countries. Of course, we were
aware that our foreign policy is being pursued in new conditions,
in a period of changes taking place today in nearly all socialist
countries.''
   Skubiszewski praised the resolution that criticized the 1968
Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia. He said the Polish
delegation successfully moved to have the resolution include a
section saying ``the Warsaw Treaty is no grounds for any
intervention in the internal affairs of states.''
   ``I am glad that this could take place at the first meeting of
the Warsaw Treaty states' leaders in which I had an opportunity to
participate,'' Mazowiecki said of the resolution.
   The prime minister, who last month made his first official trip
to the Soviet Union, has promised his government will remain loyal
to the Warsaw Pact alliance.

   Bush told NATO leaders in Brussels on Monday that the United
States supports an integrated Europe. His remarks were seen in some
quarters as a prod to Mrs. Thatcher, who has objected to a common
European currency and other aspects of unification.
   Bush believes that a stronger Europe is good for the United
States, but the details and timing of the integration are up to the
Europeans themselves, Brent Scowcroft, the president's national
security adviser, said today.
   Scowcroft also tried to play down apparent differences between
Bush and Quayle about the Soviet Union's foreign policy.
   The issue arose from an interview in which Quayle said it would
be a mistake to view the Malta summit as a sign that Soviet foreign
policy had changed.
   ``I think it's probably not possible for people to speak
literally with one voice,'' Scowcroft told reporters.
   ``I don't think they've changed much in foreign policy,'' Quayle
told The Washington Post as Bush flew home from talks with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the briefing in Brussels for
allied leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   In contrast, Bush said after the summit ``we stand at the
threshold of a brand new era of U.S.-Soviet relations'' and that
Gorbachev's acceptance of dramatic reforms in Eastern Europe
``absolutely mandates new thinking'' by the West.
   Discussing the skeptical stand taken by Quayle, Scowcroft said,
there may seem at times to be ``a difference of perspective but
there's no difference in the substance of the policies we're
pursuing.''
   Bush was briefing his Cabinet today on his weekend summit in
Malta with Gorbachev.
   As soon as he got to his private White House quarters Monday
night, Bush called Philippine President Corazon Aquino to express
concern for the lives of Americans trapped in hotels in Manila by
rebel forces trying to overthrow her.
   Bush paid tribute to her courage in seeking to quell the
rebellion, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said. Mrs.
Aquino, Fitzwater said, assured Bush her government was doing
everything possible to protect Americans.
   Bush, in a concession to possible jet lag from trans-Atlantic
travel, pushed back his schedule one hour today, receiving his
daily intelligence briefing in the Oval Office at 9 a.m. instead of
8 a.m.
   Bush was in high spirits Monday after giving NATO leaders an
assessment of the summit. Asked at a news conference why he risked
riding on a Navy launch through 6-foot waves after talks with
Gorbachev, Bush jokingly said: ``You know these charismatic, macho,
visionary guys. They'll do anything.''
   On a more serious note, Bush said he assured the allies the
United States would maintain ``significant military forces in
Europe as long as our allies desire our presence.''
   At the same time, Bush said he would ``kick our bureaucracy''
and urge other Western countries to complete work on a treaty
between NATO and the Warsaw Pact to reduce troops, tanks, artillery
and other conventional forces in Europe by next year.
   Bush told NATO leaders he hoped a multinational summit could be
convened in Europe next summer to sign such an accord.
   He said he wants that treaty ``in the bank'' before seeking
deeper reductions. Negotiators working on the accord in the
Austrian capital are making brisk progress but several issues are
unresolved, most significantly a dispute over the kind of Soviet
airplanes to be scrapped.
   Gorbachev's grip on power has been questioned in light of the
dramatic upheaval in his once-solid communist empire and the
failure of his reform programs to ease shortages of food and other
goods.
   Asked if Gorbachev acted like a man in jeopardy, Bush said: ``He
seemed very much in control. You could tell the way he interacted
with his own top people there. And he felt very confident in
discussing without notes a wide array of subjects with me.''
   Searching for a way to describe the Kremlin leader's attitude,
Bush said that ``subdued is the wrong word, but I would say
determined and unemotional about it.''
   Other members of Bush's delegation remarked that Gorbachev
seemed low key in comparison with his demeanor at summits with
former President Reagan.
   Bush said he hoped the West could take steps to ease Soviet
economic woes.
   ``We want to try to meet him on some of the areas where he needs
help. I'm thinking of a few suggestions I had in the economic
area,'' he said. ``But I also believe that the West must remain
strong and together and try to be helpful where we can in a united
way, but not be imprudent.''
   Bush said ``it wasn't all sweetness and light'' between himself
and Gorbachev, mentioning they disagreed over Central America.
   However, Bush said: ``As I watched the way in which Mr.
Gorbachev has handled the changes in Eastern Europe, it deserves
new thinking. It absolutely mandates new thinking.''
   Bush also commended Gorbachev for supporting a conventional arms
treaty that would require the Warsaw Pact to disproportionately
reduce his forces to bring them down to NATO's level.
   ``When I hear him talk about peaceful change and the right of
countries to choose _ countries in the Warsaw Pact to choose _ that
deserves new thinking,'' Bush said.

   An Avianca airliner that blew up with
107 people aboard last month was destroyed by a bomb placed in a
seat near the fuel tanks, a Colombian cabinet minister said today.
   All members of a crash investigation team agreed that the Boeing
727 was destroyed by a bomb, Minister of Government Carlos Lemos
Simmonds said at a news conference.
   Lemos did not say who may have placed the bomb, but suspicion
has fallen on Colombia's drug traffickers who had been bombing
banks, restaurants, hotels, schools and other public places.
   Before the airliner was bombed, 201 bombs had exploded over the
previous three months in major Colombian cities, killing 29 people
and injuring 238.
   Earlier, Lemos had suggested that drug traffickers were
responsible for the Nov. 27 crash that killed all those aboard.
   The jet exploded minutes after taking off from Bogota's
international airport on its way to the southern city of Cali.
   A man had called Caracol radio and claimed responsibility for
the crash on behalf of the Extraditables, a terrorist group linked
to the Medellin cocaine cartel.
   The man said the group destroyed the plane in retaliation for a
police raid on the hideout of Pablo Escobar, a leader of the
Medellin cartel, on Nov. 22. Caracol later said it doubted the
caller's authenticity.
   ``All of the technicians who took part in the investigation
agreed without exception that it was the work of criminals and that
an explosive device was placed in a seat near the gasoline tanks,''
Lemos said.
   The Bogota daily El Espectador, quoting a report by Colombia's
Civil Aeronautics Authority, said the bomb was in seat 15F, along
the right side of the plane.

   NASA on Tuesday set Dec. 18 for
launching space shuttle Columbia on a 10-day Christmas flight, but
said liftoff could be delayed a day or two if a renovated launch
pad is not ready.
   Liftoff was scheduled for 7:29 p.m., the second straight
after-dark shuttle launch. It also would be the third flight in
three months, the sixth this year and would tie the longest
previous shuttle mission.
   Columbia's five-person crew is to deploy a Navy communications
satellite and then track down and retrieve for return to Earth a
science satellite that has orbited Earth nearly six years.
   Dec. 18, which has been a launch target for some time, became
official at the conclusion of a two-day flight readiness review by
shuttle managers.
   A statement announcing the date noted that a new mobile launch
platform and a modified launch pad 39A are being used for the first
time.
   ``Due to work on these facilities, there is a higher than normal
probability of developing problems that might result in a short
delay to the launch date,'' the statement said.
   Minor problems have cropped up in fitting the shuttle to the new
facilities since Columbia moved to the pad last week.
   ``We've got a good shot at making the 18th if the pad work goes
smoothly,'' said space agency spokesman Ed Campion. He said if
problems do crop up, he expected the delay would be minimal, ``a
day or two.''
   Pad 39A was the launch base for the first 24 shuttle missions,
but has not been used in nearly four years. Workers recently
completed a two-year, $50 million overhaul to improve safety,
electrical, fuel line, environmental control and other systems.
   All seven launches since shuttle flights resumed 15 months ago
have been from neighboring pad 39B. The program was grounded for 32
months after the 1986 Challenger explosion.
   If there were a delay of several days, shuttle managers
discussed options to avoid launching on Christmas Day so most
workers could have the holiday off. Campion said under study are a
plan to launch a day or two after Christmas and another that would
put the flight off until after New Year's Day.
   Astronaut Dan Brandenstein will command Columbia's crew. The
others are pilot Jim Wetherbee and mission specialists Bonnie
Dunbar, Marsha Ivins and David Low.

   The government told school administrators
nationwide Tuesday that poor maintenance and improper operation may
cause certain indoor bleachers to collapse.
   ``Investigations reveal that if the bleachers are not opened
properly and/or maintained correctly, over a period of time, the
bleachers may collapse,'' the Consumer Product Safety Commission
said in a statement.
   The commission said recent collapses of school gymnasium
bleachers prompted the warning, which involves manual, telescoping
bleachers made from 1966 to 1979 by Michigan-based Interkal and
sold under the trade names ``Brunswick,'' ``Vecta'' and
``Interkal.''
   The agency said that 16 collapses since 1978 have produced back,
arm, leg and ankle injuries _ some serious.
   Last spring nine people were injured when a section of a
bleacher collapsed during a graduation ceremony at a Colorado high
school. Eighty-three students were injured in September 1988, when
bleachers collapsed at a Maryland high school; officials determined
that structural failure caused the collapse.
   Francis Hubbel, president of Interkal, acknowledged that the
bleachers at issue don't ``have certain fail-safe features built
in.'' He said the bleachers were redesigned in 1979.
   ``The old design is working but requires a high level of care''
by owners, Hubbel added in a telephone interview.
   The company, which manufactures half of all indoor school
bleachers, has sent more than 3,000 schools operating manuals and
safety stickers to be affixed to the bleachers, Hubbel said.
   He recommended school personnel tray?=/O???O?/Ll?erating the bleachers
inspect the structures each time they are
used.
   He also said the bleachers should be inspected annually by
authorized and trained professionals, preferably the person who
installed them.
   ``Many of these bleachers are very old and very safe while
others have developed some problems,'' said Hubbel.
   He said the age of the bleachers was not relevant in determining
the chances of collapse.
   ``We have seen bleachers that are five years old that have been

<HEAD>Thatcher Survives Leadership Challenge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher today comfortably
defeated an unprecedented challenge to her leadership of the
Conservative Party, but failed to crush all traces of rebellion.
   She got the votes of 314 of her 374 members of Parliament, while
33 opposed her and 24 abstained. Three failed to vote.
   That meant 57 lawmakers, or 15 percent, refused to support her,
and the figure provoked conflicting initial assessments.
   ``Anything below 50 would have been an absolute triumph. I think
57 is a bloody good result,'' said Norman Tebbit, a Thatcher ally
and former party chairman.
   ``I think it is a troublesome result for her,'' said John Cole,
BBC-TV's political editor, broadcasting the result live to the
nation from the House of Commons.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who has been re-elected unopposed every year
since she became party leader in 1974, was challenged by Sir
Anthony Meyer, 69, a little-known outsider who put up his candidacy
to rally anti-Thatcher sentiment.
   The consensus had been that if 100 or more failed to support
her, Mrs. Thatcher would have been badly damaged, while anything
under 45 would be an unassailable vote of confidence in her.
   Meyer conceded that the prime minister, already 10 years in
office, was entitled to feel ``pretty pleased with the result.''
   Meyer had sought to rally opposition to Mrs. Thatcher's handling
of the economy, her tough style of leadership, and her reluctance
to integrate Britain deeper into the European Economic Community.
   Mrs. Thatcher has run unopposed in the annual vote since she
ousted Edward Heath as party leader after the Tories lost the 1974
general election to the Labor Party.
   She came to power when the Conservatives won the 1979 general
election. She is in her third term as prime minister following Tory
victories in the 1983 and 1987 general elections. She is the
longest serving prime minister this century.

<HEAD>Winter Surprises Record Number Of Cape Cod Turtles</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cold weather that swept through New England
faster than usual this year caught endangered sea turtles before
they could migrate to the Gulf of Mexico, leaving some dead or
dying on Cape Cod beaches.
   Waves have tossed a record number of turtle bodies onto the
sandy beaches of Cape Cod, said Robert Prescott, director of the
Massachusetts Audobon Society's Wellfleet Bay Wildlife Sanctuary.
   Several species of turtles feed in Cape Cod Bay during the
summer, then migrate to warm Gulf beaches to nest.
   Turtles can stand water as low as 45 degrees before they slow
down and stiffen, said Diane Reynolds, an administrative assistant
who has worked at the Wellfleet sanctuary for seven years. Tuesday,
the water at the Nantucket shoals was 45 degrees, according to the
National Weather Service.
   Eight dead or near-dead turtles, most from the endangered
species list, were reported found last week, the most since a
five-day record set in 1985, Prescott said.
   The turtles include four Ridleys, an endangered species, and one
loggerhead, a species considered threatened, or slightly less rare
than Ridleys. Three others, including a hawksbill turtle rarely
seen this far north, were found dead, Reynolds said Tuesday.
   The turtles were taken to the New England Aquarium, where rescue
teams nurse the listless reptiles back to health so they can be
flown south for further therapy.
   At the aquarium, the turtles live in a heated pool and
assistants ply them with green crab, squid and pieces of fish.
Though the rescued turtles have not yet started to eat, they are
doing ``about as well as can be expected,'' said Vikki Corliss, a
spokeswoman for the aquarium.
   ``They're not running relay races, that's for sure,'' she said.
``But they move around the pool. They are responding to a degree,
considering they are cold-stunned.''
   Corliss said it could take a couple of weeks for the turtles to
recover. Then they will be flown to aquariums in North Carolina or
Florida, for additional care before they are eventually released,
Prescott said.
   Rescuing the Ridley turtles would be a particular victory
because of their endangered status, Prescott said. Only 600 female
Ridley turtles were counted last year at their nesting site along
the northern Mexican coast. In 1947, 40,000 nesting females were
counted.
   Reynolds said man is the biggest threat to Ridleys and other
turtles.
   Turtles suffer from ``the destruction of beachfront property,
poachers,'' said Reynolds. ``Poachers eat them, turn their shells
into jewelry, sell them as souvenirs. They eat the eggs.''

<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Changes in the Earth's climate could encourage
the spread of diseases like encephalitis and rabies, while at the
same time damaging the human body's ability to fight them, a
conference on climate and health was told Tuesday.
   Potential problems stem both from the increase in ultraviolet
radiation, as the protective ozone layer in the stratsophere is
damaged, and from climate warming, which many scientists believe is
occurring in a so-called Greenhouse effect.
   Ultraviolet radiation, already known to cause skin cancer, also
has a major effect in reducing the response of the human immune
system, said Dr. Raymond Daynes of the University of Utah.
   ``There is really no advantage to sunbathing. Your skin is
really not meant to withstand ultraviolet radiation,'' Daynes told
the conference on ``Global Atmospheric Change and Public Health.''
   Ultraviolet radiation, he said, ``in addition to being a potent
carcinogen, appears able to modify, or suppress, the immune
system.''
   Levels of ultraviolet radiation are considered likely to
increase as ozone is depleted in the upper atmosphere, where
man-made chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons destroy the
protective layer. Already a seasonal reduction in ozone, known as
an ozone hole, occurs at the South Pole.
   At the same time this immune system damage is being threatened,
warming of the climate could lead to the spread of diseases
currently limited by the climate, added Dr. Robert E. Shope of the
Yale University School of Medicine.
   And Dr. Susanne Holmes Giannini of the University of Maryland
School of Medicine added that ultraviolet radiation also increases
the effects of many diseases that affect the skin or start on the
skin.
   Skin disesases such as leprosy, smallpox, skin ulcers and
infections and herpes could be worsened by increases in radiation,
she said, as could diseases that enter the body through the skin
such as anthrax, bubonic plague, yaws, some types of diptheria,
African sleeping sickness and others.
   In one series of tests, she said, mice infected with what is
normally a skin disease developed fewer skin ulcers under
ultraviolet radiation, but between 15 percent and 40 percent of
them died. Thus, she concluded, ultraviolet radiation seems able to
convert one normally non-fatal disease into a fatal one.
   ``Most human infectious diseases will probably not be greatly
influenced by climate change,'' said Shope. But, he added, those
affected by climate, such as diseases carried by mosquitoes, likely
will be.
   The change is hard to predict without known how much or how fast
climate will change, he said, noting that while the Greenhouse
effect is widely discussed, scientists disagree over whether it has
actually begun and how much warming might occur.
   If there is a warmer climate, said Shope, possible problems
might include the spread of bat-borne rabies as vampire bats from
South and Central America extend their range to the north, spread
of dengue and yellow fever and an increase in St. Louis
encephalitis.
   Normally that form of encephalitis, which is particularly
serious in older people, occurs in an epidemic every decade or so,
the last one having been in 1975.
   Mosquitoes breeding in sewage spread the disease, he said, and
warm, dry years favor its expansion.
   Other diseases causes by parasites might also spread, he said.
But he added that there is no way of predicting exactly which
diseases may expand, which could be reduced, or when.

   U.S. Jewish leaders Tuesday gave
President Richard von Weizsaecker an award for urging people not to
forget the Nazi years, but they expressed concern about right-wing
extremism should the Germanys unite.
   Weizsaecker was the first German to receive the Anti-Defamation
League's Joseph Prize for Human Rights. The president is known for
speeches reminding West Germans never to forget the Nazi years and
calling on them to guard against a revival of fascism.
   ``This is for me a very moving moment,'' Weizsaecker said.
   Burton Levinson, the league chairman, called Weizsaecker the
``conscience of his country'' who ``looks truth straight in the
eye.''
   The Anti-Defamation League is based in New York and known for
its work to prevent anti-Semitism.
   In an interview, Levinson and the league's national director,
Abraham Foxman, praised West Germany's rise as a democratic nation
that eschews political extremism.
   They acknowledged that ultra-rightism has increased in West
Germany but said they are confident of officials' efforts to
control it.
   ``They have taken it seriously, they are facing the problem,
they are dealing with it, and we are satisfied,'' Foxman told The
Associated Press.
   But Foxman said he is worried about what might happen among East
Germans after 40 years of Communist domination if the Germanys are
reunited.
   ``There is a concern that generations that have grown up in
totalitarianism can very easily swing from one extreme to
another,'' said Foxman.
   ``They may be more supportive of a right-wing ideology which is
nationalistic, simplistic,'' he said.
   He suggested that East Germans should be re-educated. Their
Communist leaders long maintained they did not have to accept
responsibility for the Nazi years because their country was created
after the Nazis' defeat.
   Foxman said he would like to see reeducation occur before the
two German states draw together in any formal way. ``There needs to
be a re-examination of history and an acceptance of some of the
responsiblity,'' he said.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl last week unveiled a 10-point plan to
move toward uniting the Germanys.
   Foxman said he would like his suggestion of reeducating East
Germans to be the 11th point of the plan.
   The Joseph Prize's previous recipients include former Israeli
leaders Golda Meir and Menachem Begin; author Elie Wiesel; and
former Vice President Hubert Humphrey.

   MTV Networks, which owns cable TV's Nickelodeon
and a new all-comedy channel that will start next year, said
Tuesday it has bought rights to 15 former network shows, including
the acclaimed ``Mary Tyler Moore Show.''
   Thirteen of the shows are situation comedies going to MTV's
``Ha! The TV Comedy Network'' channel. Another series headed there
is ``TV Bloopers and Practical Jokes,'' which was on NBC for three
years.
   Eight of the comedies and one comedy miniseries, the six-part
``Fresno,'' were made by Moore's production company, MTM, which
also made the CBS' drama series, ``The White Shadow.'' That series
will air on Nickelodeon.
   Moore's old series and repeats of ``The Bob Newhart Show,'' the
latter part of the MTM package, won't air on `Ha!'' until 1992
because those shows still are in syndication to television
stations, an MTV spokesman said.
   However, the others, including ``The Lucy Show'' starring the
late Lucille Ball, ``Love, American Style,'' and ``That Girl'' will
be on ``Ha!'' when it starts operating, he said. Those three
sitcoms were not bought from MTM.
   The new ``Ha!'' channel is scheduled to begin on April 1,
competing with Home Box Office's 24-hour The Comedy Channel, which
premiered on Nov. 15.

   Hundreds of foreigners fled intense
fighting between rebel and loyalist troops in a financial district
today, but thousands more were trapped for a fourth night when the
battle halted evacuation efforts.
   A rebel source said the insurgents, who are seeking to oust
President Corazon Aquino, might refuse to allow all the Americans
to leave. More than 200 Americans were believed to be trapped.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
insurgents would release all Asian and European tourists but ``the
intention is not to release Americans'' because of U.S. support for
Mrs. Aquino.
   Fighting spilled over into exclusive neighborhoods near where
the ambassadors of the United States, China and the Soviet Union
live. U.S. officials said Ambassador Nicholas Platt would not be
spending the night in his residence.
   In Washington today, the U.S. administration expressed concern
for the safety of American tourists and businessmen unable to leave
the Philippines and said there remains ``some uncertainty'' about
their status.
   President Bush is keeping options open as he weighs the best way
to protect American citizens, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said.
   ``You can be assured that the Pentagon has contingency plans for
everything,'' Fitzwater said, while declining to elaborate on what
additional military steps the United States might take.
   The strain of captivity, fear of violence and the uncertainty
began to take their toll on the Americans held.
   ``It's very frustrating with the government and with the
reformists (rebels),'' Allan Campbell, 61, of Lancaster, Pa., told
reporters allowed to enter the Intercontinental Hotel briefly.
``We're getting angry now at both sides.''
   On Friday, the first day of the coup attempt, U.S. F-4 Phantom
fighter jets flew air cover in support of pro-government forces
battling guerrillas who were staging their sixth attempt to oust
Mrs. Aquino since she was swept to power in 1986.
   More than 74 people have been killed and more than 500 wounded
since rebels launched the bloodiest attempt yet to topple Mrs.
Aquino's administration. Rebels say the elected government has
failed to deal effectively with the country's Communist insurgency,
corruption, incompetence and economic problems.
   At least two people were killed and 15 wounded in today's
fighting, one of the dead a 6-year-old girl killed when a 60mm
mortar fired by the rebels slammed into a squatter settlement near
the Makati Medical Center.
   In addition to the 400 or so rebels entrenched in the Makati
financial district, a similar number still occupied Mactan Air Base
in Cebu, 350 miles south of Manila, despite an ultimatum to leave
the garrison by today.
   Tourism officials today prepared about 20 buses to go into
Makati to evacuate tourists to the airport, but heavy fighting
forced them to halt the convoy.
   After hours of negotiations with the rebels _ members of the
elite 1st Scout Ranger Regiment, government negotiators said the
evacuation would be delayed for at least a day.
   ``They've decided to postpone it for tomorrow because it's
nightfall and we don't want the tourists to be mistaken for
soldiers,'' said Rafael Alunan, undersecretary of tourism.
   The insurgents on Saturday moved into the district that is home
to many foreign diplomats and journalists, taking control of about
22 buildings.
   The U.S. Embassy and others urged their nationals to flee
Makati, even if they lived in areas not yet touched by the fighting.
   Scores of Americans arrived today at the U.S. Seafront housing
compound, which was guarded by U.S. Marines. Others moved to hotels
near Manila Bay, about five miles west of the fighting.
   The Philippine Plaza said 450 foreigners had checked into the
hotel by midafternoon.
   ``We're telling Americans that if they can get out safely, get
out,'' said U.S. Embassy spokesman Jerry Huchel. ``But if they
can't, stay where you are, but keep away from upper floors.''
   Huchel estimated that about 215 Americans were trapped in three
luxury hotels in Makati. The Manila Chronicle quoted military
reports as saying nine American servicemen from U.S.-run Clark Air
Base, 50 miles north of Manila, were among them.
   A statement distributed to news organizations in the name of
cashiered Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, a fugitive, said
the rebels did not want to hurt civilians.
   ``We would like to emphasize that what we are doing is for the
good of all the Filipino people for the longer term,'' the
statement said. ``We cannot continue with the present system in
which the political, economic and moral fiber of this country is
slowly and shamelessly rent apart by the Aquino regime under the
shameless support of the U.S. imperialists in the guise of
democracy.''
   Mutineers on Friday took over several military facilities and
bombed the presidential palace. With the U.S. air support,
government forces counterattacked and regained most positions.
   Honasan once supported Mrs. Aquino but led an August 1987
attempt to overthrow her.

   Accidents happen. That's how Gov. Carroll
Campbell explained shooting and slightly injuring his guide during
a hunting trip.
   Campbell said Monday he was hunting quail Nov. 28 when one
pellet of bird shot hit Harry Williams in the cheek and another hit
him in the wrist. He was not seriously hurt.
   ``I was out of sight down in a gully and the other fella was out
of sight up one hill and I shot up at a quail and a couple of shots
happened to hit him,'' Campbell told WIS-TV. ``It's the first time
it's ever happened to me and I'll do the best I can to make sure
it's the last time.''
   Campbell said everyone in his party was following safety rules.
   ``We were wearing the orange hunting hats and we had everything,
but we were in some brush and you get down in a gully and someone's
up and they were a long way away ... about 75 yards,'' he said.
``And you do get sprayed a little bit and you have to be careful
with it and as careful as we were, things happen.''

   Best-selling author W.P.
Kinsella dismisses critics taking potshots at his latest hits
because he either isn't who he writes about or hasn't been where he
sets his stories.
   ``Fiction writers can write about anything they damn well
please,'' says Kinsella, whose collection of humorous short
stories, ``The Miss Hobbema Pageant'' is riding high on best-seller
lists in British Columbia.
   Kinsella, author of the baseball novel ``Shoeless Joe'' on which
the recent movie ``Field of Dreams'' was based, has come under fire
for his short stories about Indians Silas Ermineskin and Frank
Fencepost.
   Marilyn Buffalo McDonald, a resident of Hobbema, Alberta, who
reviewed ``The Miss Hobbema Pageant,'' called it ``malicious'' and
``racist and sexist.''
   Kinsella says people from Hobbema tend not to be able to
distinguish fantasy from reality.
   ``Obviously, everything I write is fiction because I've never
been there and I don't know anything about the place,'' said
Kinsella.
   That sort of thinking would mean ``a white, male writer couldn't
write about anything except other white males and a woman couldn't
write about anything except women.
   ``Consequently, all children's literature would have to be
written by children,'' Kinsella said.

   Bill Cosby is the most successful entertainer
in history and will be No. 1 when people look back on television of
the 1980s, in the opinion of the editors at TV Guide magazine.
   ``The Cosby Show has been at or near the top of the ratings
almost since its debut in 1984,'' according to the magazine's Dec.
9 issue, and the show ``has never depended for its ratings on
raunchy gags, violence and put-down stereotypes.''
   Besides Cosby, among the most-remembered television
personalities of the 1980s will be Larry Hagman and Oprah Winfrey,
the editors said.
   Cosby's half-hour comedy show placed first among the top shows
of the decade, which included ``Dallas'' and ``Dynasty,'' cop shows
``Hill Street Blues'' and ``Miami Vice,'' and ``Nightline'' and
``Saturday Night Live.''
   Hagman's J.R. Ewing character made ``Dallas'' a hit because ``he
played the smiling cobra with such campy finesse.'' The show was
picked as the second-best of the decade.
   Winfrey was singled out because: ``What she's about is pure
personality. It includes the gift of intimacy _ that warm
spontaniety.''

   Julio Iglesias is said to be near settlement
with the security guard who claims the singer felled him with a
karate chop in 1986.
   A civil trial for damages was scheduled Monday in U.S. District
Court here, but a lawyer for the guard asked that the trial be
called off saying the case was close to settlement.
   David Wells, a lawyer representing Iglesias, said the settlement
was ``in the works. But I don't see any reason that it won't be
worked out.''
   The guard, Stephen A. Clemons, claims that Iglesias made racial
comments to Clemons and another guard at a St. Louis hotel, then
followed the verbal attack with a karate chop on the neck.
   Iglesias has denied striking Clemons, saying he merely greeted
him in a friendly manner.
   Clemons originally sought $50,000 in actual damages and $250,000
in punitive damages. He amended the lawsuit in January to seek $5
million in punitive damages.

<HEAD>Sandinista Strike Against Contras Possible, Officials Say</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts new 4th graf, In Managua, with no comment from Nicaraguans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A significant increase in Nicaraguan troop
concentrations near the Honduran border camps of the Contra rebels
is raising the possibility of a Sandinista attempt at a knockout
blow against the insurgents, officials say.
   At the same time, the officials said intelligence reports
indicate the Sandinistas in two weeks will receive from the Soviet
Union four helicopters with potential for military use.
   The shipment reportedly left the Soviet Union by ship on the eve
of the Mediterranean summit last weekend.
   In Managua, the Nicaraguan Defense Ministry declined comment on
the report.
   The sources said the Sandinista mobilization began to occur in
late October when President Daniel Ortega called off a cease-fire
in effect for the preceding 19 months.
   There are no reliable estimates of the number of Sandinistas
involved in the redeployment.
   The Sandinista army is believed to be in a position to launch an
offensive against the Honduran-based camps within 72 hours.
Alternatively, those forces could be earmarked for use against the
estimated 5,000 Contras still inside Nicaragua, said the officials,
insisting on anonymity.
   The new deployments reflect what has been a deteriorating peace
process in Nicaragua, marked not only by the suspension of the
cease-fire five weeks ago but also by the continued existence of
the Contras despite calls by Central American presidents for them
to demobilize.
   Today was to have been the deadline for the Contras to disband
under a resolution approved in August by Ortega and four other
Central American presidents. But thousands of Contras continue to
be deployed at the Honduran camps, subsisting on U.S. food and
other non-lethal aid.
   Despite Sandinista protests, the aid will continue until after
national elections set for Feb. 25. U.S. officials are worried the
election will be called off, but the Sandinistas deny any such
intention.
   The rebels note the five presidents specified the demobilization
was to have been carried out ``voluntarily'' and they insist their
return to their homeland cannot precede the establishment of
democratic conditions in Nicaragua.
   Those conditions have not been met, the rebels contend,
defending their decision to ignore today's deadline.
   Mistrust between the Sandinistas and the Contras has accelerated
in recent weeks, partly because of an abortive attempt by the two
sides last month to restore the cease-fire.
   Wary of Sandinista intentions, Contra forces have been placed on
alert and have positioned themselves further east where their
detection by enemy forces amid dense foliage is more difficult, the
sources said.
   The Soviet MI-17 helicopters left port last week on the eve of
the summit and are due at the Nicaraguan port of Corinto on Dec.
18, the officials said.
   Such helicopters normally are sent to Nicaragua without weapons,
enabling the Soviets to say they are not prolonging the conflict in
that country. On Sunday, after the Mediterranean summit, President
Mikhail Gorbachev reaffirmed that his country has long since ceased
the delivery of arms to the Sandinistas.
   President Bush has said he does not challenge Gorbachev's
assertion, but the reported shipment of MI-17s appears to some
officials to undercut the Soviet leader's claims of peaceful
involvement.
   The officials said MI-17s delivered to the Sandinistas routinely
are converted to military use once they arrive in Nicaragua. They
are used both as troop transports and as gunships.
   The sources said the Sandinistas have about 38 MI-17s in their
inventory. The MI-17 is an advanced version of the MI-8 Hip
helicopter and is more easily adaptable than the MI-8 for use as a
gunship.

   A woman jailed for having seven overdue library
books is suing the county and its solicitor for $500,000.
   Karen Lindsay, a 48-year-old office worker from suburban
Atlanta, was jailed overnight in October for failing to appear in
court on the overdue-book charges. She said she returned the books
in 1988 and was never served with the notice to appear in court.
   ``That seems like a reasonable amount for being dragged out of
your house at 10:30 p.m. and spending a night in jail without
bond,'' said Herbert P. Schlanger, Ms. Lindsay's attorney.
   The U.S. District Court complaint alleges false arrest.
   Schlanger said that because Ms. Lindsay never received court
notice, she committed no crime and, therefore, was falsely
imprisoned.
   Solicitor Gerald N. Blaney, named in the lawsuit, declined
comment, but has acknowledged that the woman didn't receive the
notice.
   Ms. Lindsay is to appear Thursday night on ``The Tonight Show
Starring Johnny Carson'' to talk about her experience.
   She said Monday that she hopes the lawsuit will result in a
change in the policy of issuing arrest warrants for people who
haven't received notice to appear in court.

   Veterinarian Bruce Young, who lost a bid in Limestone County

She'll be living with a pig named Romeo.
   Young, 44, found Julia, then 20 pounds and 8 weeks old,
wandering along a road one stormy night in February. He named her
after a former girlfriend.
   A city ordinance bans hog-raising within city limits. Young
contended Julia was a pet, not livestock, but lost a court fight.
   Julia's fans will be able to watch her go out in style in the

   Some adjustments had to be made when
9-year-old Ben Williamson entered Pensacola High School's
International Baccalaureate honors program after skipping four
elementary grades.
   His books were too heavy for the 4-foot, 6-inch freshman to
carry by himself, so the school issued him a second set to keep at
home.
   Ben is allowed to eat lunch in the honors program office because
he is afraid of some of his larger schoolmates and prefers playing
checkers there with another student or chess with a retired math
professor.
   Although not totally comfortable either with children his own
age or teen-agers, Ben prefers the company of other high school
students.
   ``I feel more alien when I'm with my age group,'' he said. ``We
don't think about the same things. Transformers and Gobots bore
me.''
   Although a fight against boredom propelled Ben from kindergarten
to ninth grade in four years, he is still very much a child, said
Donna Dunson, coordinator of the honors program.
   ``We were reading `Lord of the Flies' together last year and
discussing its parallels to Russian history when all of a sudden
his tongue's out touching his nose, and he says, `Can you do this?'

   Fighting by rebels intensified
Tuesday in the embattled financial district where 2,000 foreigners
are trapped, and a rebel officer said Americans stranded there may
not be freed because of U.S. support for the Aquino government.
   About 215 Americans are believed pinned down in hotels in the
Makati district, said U.S. Embassy spokesman Jerry Huchel.
   Safe passage for the trapped foreigners was delayed Tuesday,
although hundreds of others living in the district were able to
flee to safer areas amid the most serious coup attempt so far
against President Corazon Aquino, who took office in February 1986.
   Scores of Americans arrived Tuesday at the U.S. Seafront housing
compound, where U.S. Marines were on guard. Others moved to hotels
near Manila Bay, about five miles west of the fighting.
   At least 77 people have been killed and more than 540 wounded
since rebel soldiers launched the coup attempt Friday.
   Vice President Salvador Laurel suggested that he, Mrs. Aquino
and Congress all resign, as a means of ending the battle, and
schedule new elections.
   Reports said the leader of the main pro-Aquino party had
suggested she dismiss her Cabinet as a gesture to the rebels.
   Rafael Alunan, undersecretary of tourism, negotiated for hours
with the leader of rebels in Makati about the foreigners trapped in
three luxury hotels and condominiums.
   The talks at the Intercontinental Hotel ended at sunset, and
Alunan said they would continue Wednesday. The rebels offered
Monday to let the foreigners leave.
   After the negotiations Tuesday, Alunan said: ``They've decided
to postpone ... because it's nightfall and we don't want the
tourists to be mistaken for soldiers.'' He said some details
remained to be settled, but would not be more specific.
   Capt. Albert Yen, one of the insurgents, said ``the intention is
not to release Americans.''
   ``U.S. meddling has caused the failure of the first wave of our
assault, so we hold them liable,'' Yen said. ``It is the
responsibility of the U.S. government if we take their nationals
hostage.''
   On Friday, U.S. F-4 Phantom jets flew air cover for loyalist
forces, without firing on the rebels, and prevented insurgents from
continuing air strikes from Villamor Air Base. They had seized the
base in the first hours of the coup.
   Yen said the rebellion was codenamed ``Seven Days and Seven
Nights in December,'' and would involve a seven-stage operation. He
said the takeover of the financial district, which began Saturday,
was the second stage.
   In Washington, the Bush administration expressed concern for the
trapped Americans and said ``some uncertainty'' remained about
their status.
   ``You can be assured that the Pentagon has contingency plans for
everything,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. He would
not say what additional military steps the United States might take.
   In addition to the 400 Scout Rangers in Makati, a similar number
of mutineers still occupied the Mactan Air Base in Cebu, 350 miles
south of Manila.
   Brig. Gen. Jose Commendador, leader of the Mactan rebels, said
Tuesday there would be a ``nationwide uprising by the military'' if
the government moved against them.
   The coast guard arrested five mutineers on a vessel that arrived
Tuesday from Bacolod, 300 miles south of Manila.
   Soldiers established roadblocks north of Manila because of
reports that rebel reinforcements were coming. Maj. Gen. Alfredo
Lim, the Manila police chief, issued ``shoot to kill'' orders for
mutineers who tried to enter the city in civilian clothes.
   In a statement issued Tuesday in Hong Kong, Laurel said the
government's resignation would allow for ``a new mandate'' and
avert civil war. Although Laurel is vice president, he broke with
Mrs. Aquino in 1987 and has formed an opposition party.
   Gov. Roberto Pagdanganan of Bulacan province said Sen. Neptali
Gonzalez, chairman of the pro-Aquino Struggle of the Democratic
Filipino party, suggested in a meeting Monday with the president
and local officials that she dismiss her Cabinet.
   Pagdanganan said most of those present endorsed the proposal,
but Mrs. Aquino offered no opinion.
   At least two people were killed and 15 wounded in fighting
Tuesday, including a 6-year-old girl killed when a 60mm mortar
round fired by rebels hit a squatter settlement near the Makati
Medical Center.
   Continued fighting has strained the economy and weakened public
confidence.
   Banks in Quezon City said withdrawals over the last two days
surpassed the figures for all of November. Jose Concepcion,
secretary of Trade and Industry, announced that Mrs. Aquino had
imposed price ceilings on rice, chicken, pork and cooking fuel.
   A statement distributed to news organizations in the name of
cashiered Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, a fugitive, said
the rebels did not want to hurt civilians.
   ``We would like to emphasize that what we are doing is for the
good of all the Filipino people for the longer term,'' it said.
   ``We cannot continue with the present system in which the
political, economic and moral fiber of this country is slowly and
shamelessly rent apart by the Aquino regime under the shameless
support of the U.S. imperialists in the guise of democracy.''
   Honasan once supported Mrs. Aquino, but led the strongest
previous attempt to overthrow her, in August 1987.

<TEXT>
   The federal government is trying to turn family
planning clinics into venues for anti-abortion advocacy,
Massachusetts' attorney general argued Tuesday in appealing a ban
on abortion service referrals for clinics receiving government
funds.
   In 1988, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services barred
family planning clinics from suggesting abortion as an option to
pregnancy. It specifically prohibits use of federal money for
programs that assist women in obtaining abortions. It also bans the
use of funding for activities that ``encourage, promote or advocate
abortion.''
   The regulation is on hold while Massachusetts, New York and
Colorado wage court battles against it, claiming it violates
constitutional rights of privacy and free speech.
   ``These regulations suppress one viewpoint but foist on patients
another viewpoint _ that she should carry that pregnancy to term,''
Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon argued Tuesday before
the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. ``What we're talking about
here is government manipulating information.''
   He presented a scenario in which poor, uneducated, pregnant
women leave a family planning clinic believing they must continue
their pregnancy with no alternative.
   ``The government doesn't have to subsidize a constitutional
right (to abortion), but it can't interfere with these rights,''
Shannon said.
   Arguments Tuesday invoked both the 1973 Supreme Court decision
in Roe vs. Wade that abortion is a woman's right to decide and the
so-called Webster case in July that said a state can deny funding
for abortions.
   Justice Department counsel Alfred Mollin, arguing for Health and
Human Services, said Webster established ``it is wrong for the
government to place an obstacle, but not wrong to leave an obstacle
there.''
   Mollin contended that the regulations are not as prohibitive as
they seem.
   They don't prevent a clinic staff from at least saying they
don't make abortion referrals, he said. He also said a physician
can still refer a woman for an abortion if the pregnancy risks her
life or health.
   ``The tone of the regulations are not to set up an anti-abortion
advocacy group,'' Mollin said.
   The matter has already been before the court in Boston. In May,
three judges of the 1st Circuit ruled in favor of the state,
upholding an injunction blocking the ban on referrals from taking
effect.
   But when the Supreme Court handed down the Webster decision two
months later, the federal government asked the 1st Circuit to
rehear the arguments in this new light.
   Elsewhere, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York
City upheld the regulations last month.
   A ruling is pending on an appeal of the regulations in federal
court in Denver on behalf of Planned Parenthood affiliates.
   This fiscal year, the federal government is spending $138
million to provide family planning services to 5 million teen-agers
and women.
   ``This case is the only one that is national in scope,'' said
Scott Swirling, executive director of the National Family Planning
and Reproductive Health Association based in Washington, D.C. ``The
outcome will determine whether poor women can get complete amounts
of information (about abortion).
   ``This case doesn't concern the legality of abortion, but until
and unless the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, abortion is a
legal and constitutional right.''

   Despite a report that national drug policy
director William J. Bennett and budget director Richard Darman are
at loggerheads over the 1991 budget to fight illegal drugs, a
Bennett spokesman said Tuesday that he expects ``a happy ending''
when the shouting is over.
   An administration source said Monday that ``Bennett and Darman
are apart by more than a couple of hundred million dollars. It may
end up going to the president to get things sorted out.''
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, refused to
detail the proposals from Bennett or Darman but did say he expects
to see ``a real increase'' over the $8.8 billion 1991 budget.
   Under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 which created Bennett's
Office of National Drug Control Policy, Bennett is required to
certify that the anti-drug budget sent to Capitol Hill is adequate
to fund the strategy he has developed to curb drug use.
   After President Bush presented the original strategy Sept. 5,
along with a $7.9 billion price tag for 1990, members of Congress
questioned Bennett on whether he had set the budget figure or
whether that figure had been imposed by Darman's Office of
Management and Budget. Bennett told Congress _ which eventually
increased the 1990 budget to $8.8 billion _ that he felt the $7.9
billion was adequate.
   Asked if Bennett would be able to give Congress the same
assurances on the 1991 budget if he doesn't win the battle with
Darman, Bennett spokesman Don Hamilton said Tuesday, ``I'm not
really very worried about it. I'm confident it's all going to have
a happy ending.
   ``The agencies come up with the numbers,'' Hamilton said.
``Bennett takes a look at them. The idea is that we work this
through, keeping OMB in what should be a three-cornered thing.''
   Hamilton had said Monday, ``This is the time of year when lots
of agency heads and Cabinet secretaries are talking to Darman,
occasionally in strong terms.''
   OMB spokeswoman Barbara Clay said only, ``We have nothing to
say. We don't comment at all on the '91 budget, and this falls into
that category.''
   Meanwhile, Bennett's office is continuing to work on the update
of the national drug control strategy, referred to among officials
as ``Strategy Two.'' Like the original strategy, the update is
required by Congress.
   The update is expected to include designations of cities or
regions considered ``high-intensity drug-trafficking areas'' that
would be eligible for additional federal resources, both money and
personnel.
   Published reports have said the areas to be so designated in the
upcoming strategy are Los Angeles, New York, Miami, Houston and the
Southwest border. Officials in Bennett's office say no final
decisions have been made.
   ``The conversations in reference to high-intensity drug
trafficking areas are still ongoing,'' said Reggie Walton,
associate director for state and local affairs. ``It is incorrect
to say any final resolutions have been made.
   Although numerous cities have clamored for the designation in
the hope of a windfall of federal aid, there is relatively little
money available for 1990. Only $25 million is in the federal
budget, and that could be enhanced by up to $21 million from the
federal asset forfeiture fund, Walton said. That fund contains
revenue from assets seized from drug traffickers, including cash,
bank accounts, homes, cars, planes and boats, among other things.
   But one administration official said, ``We're looking at
dividing this money up among four, five, six, seven areas. What can
you do with this money?'' The official said the Los Angeles area
spends $2 billion of its own money for anti-drug efforts.
   In comparison, Bennett has said the federal effort to crack down
on drugs in the nation's capital alone will cost about $97 million,
including money for three drug treatment centers and a new jail for
the District of Columbia.
   Walton said the high-intensity drug-trafficking areas might get
federal resources such as personnel instead of cash. He declined to
say how much money would be sought for the areas in 1991.

<DATELINE>BLACKHAWK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In this season of conspicuous
consumption, gourmets and gluttons alike can load up at a grocery
store that offers patrons the use of brass carts and cellular
telephones and plays live classical music.
   Customers at FJ's Blackhawk Market, a year-old,
33,000-square-foot store, also can sip on fresh-brewed French roast
coffee served from gleaming brass urns while they shop.
   There's no Muzak here. Shoppers stroll down
black-and-white-tiled, softly lit aisles to strains of classical
music, played by a tuxedoed musician at the keyboard of a shiny
black grand piano.
   FJ's operations manager Greg Pereira likes to watch new
customers do double-takes as they enter the store. He says it
borrows a little from other luxury markets while adding his own
whimsical spin.
   The son of a grocery store owner, Pereira owned several chain
markets before embarking on the upscale showplace about 30 miles
east of San Francisco, near the exclusive Blackhawk Country Club,
home to numerous Bay area sports stars, executives and
personalities.
   FJ's was the first store to start up at a shopping complex in
the foothills of majestic Mount Diablo, amid a burgeoning suburban
population with a median household income of $90,000 and an average
age of 38.
   He and store owner Frank J. Straface teamed up to create their
own Blackhawk version of Beyerly's in Minnesota, Simon David's in
Dallas, AJ's in Scottsdale, Ariz. and Harrod's in London.
   ``We were laughed at. We were ridiculed by the industry. We
didn't know if we couldn't do it,'' Pereira recalled.
   But they went ahead, doing away with the traditional fluorescent
lights that shine overhead in other supermarkets, and installing
black cases and shelves for eye-catching displays of all products
but produce and meat. State laws ban black shelves for those two
items.
   Shoppers focusing on food can find the usual peanut butter,
salami, chips, breakfast flakes and cat food. But it's the unusual
that sets FJ's apart from the usual mall market.
   FJ's boasts almost 70 kinds of mustard, ranging in price from 70
cents to $10. There is maple syrup from Vermont, cranberry cabernet
chutney, wild mushroom caviar, squid ink pasta and bags of
grapevine cuttings to impart an unusual flavor to California
barbeques.
   ``What do I like about FJ's?'' said shopper Pat Devine of
Blackhawk. ``Everything. The people are friendly. The place is
clean. The carts work.''
   So do the cellular phones you can check out while shopping.
Local calls are free; long-distance calls can be charged to
customer credit cards. Periera said the idea was more novel than
practical at first, and callers tended to boast to friends,
``You'll never guess where I'm calling from!''
   But he said the dozen phones are more often used now to check
with someone at home about food purchases _ although they have been
used to complete a car purchase and conclude stock deals.
Capitalizing on the communications boon, FJ's also accepts orders
via fax machines.
   Everything is done in the spirit of fun, said Pereira, such as
an event dubbed ``Dog Days of Summer.'' During that promotion, the
store offered samples of a frozen canine treat called ``Frosty
Paws,'' along with FJ's own version of ``Thirsty Pup'' bottled
spring water.
   The extras don't jack up the cost of the inventory, Pereira
said. The fixtures and the shopping carts cost FJs the same as they
would other stores, but FJs tailors them to the upscale market.
   For instance, they buy fewer carts that look nicer, he said.
   ``It doesn't cost anything,'' Pereira said. ``There is no price
value to it. It's just a different approach.''
   Focusing on speciality items does bring the store more profit,
he acknowledged.
   For example, he noted that most stores don't carry nine
varieties of caviar, or carry champagne that ranges in price from
$3 to $1,000 a bottle. Ten percent profit on a $1,000 bottle is
much more than on a $3 bottle of the bubbly, he added.

   A former Teacher of the Year acquitted of
drug charges that resulted in her firing has sued to get her job
back.
   Vicki Sherling, who was arrested along with her husband,
Michael, after authorities found marijuana plants in a makeshift
greenhouse in the couple's yard, also seeks an unspecified amount
of damages in the lawsuit filed Monday in U.S. District Court.
   The former teacher in Moultrie in southwest Georgia was
temporarily suspended from her job in May, shortly after being
arrested. In June, the school board dismissed her and the State
Board of Education upheld the local board.
   An appeal of that decision is in the state courts, said her
lawyer, William Norwood.
   Sherling pleaded guilty to possessing and manufacturing
marijuana and drew a 10-year sentence with three years to serve. He
testified in court that Mrs. Sherling had no knowledge of the
plants.
   The lawsuit contends that many of the school board members
``prejudged the case'' and that Mrs. Sherling was denied due
process of law because the board was not impartial.
   The lawsuit also contends that Mrs. Sherling, Colquitt County's
Teacher of the Year for 1989, was told that she was not fired
because of the drug charges, but because she ``allowed her husband
to use marijuana.''

   French actor Robert Vidalin, known to millions as
the voice of Charles De Gaulle's resistance fighters during World
War II, has died at the age of 86.
   He died Sunday. No cause of death was given.
   Vidalin, an actor and member of the Comedie Francaise national
theater, gave up his acting in 1939 to join the underground after
the Nazis invaded France.
   Later he joined De Gaulle in London and became one of the best
known radio announcers on the popular BBC news program, ``Les
Francais Parlent aux Francais'' _ ``The French Speak to the
French.''
   The program was broacast illegally into France and millions
risked arrest and deportation for tuning in. Vidalin was among many
who transmitted coded messages to the resistance and announced the
June 6, 1944, invasion by Allied forces.
   After the war, he returned to acting in Paris and taught drama
as well as performing at the Comedie Francaise.

<HEAD>Justices Hear Arguments Over Ohio Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   States should be barred from outlawing the
``mere possession and simple viewing'' of child pornography, the
Supreme Court was told Tuesday.
   ``Anything that one uses in one's own home, it's all protected
under the First Amendment,'' public defender S. Adele Shank argued
in attacking such an Ohio law.
   But Columbus City Attorney Ronald J. O'Brien said possession of
lewd depictions of nude children is not an act falling under the
First Amendment's freedom-of-expression protections.
   ``Child pornography has been driven underground,'' O'Brien said.
``Because it's underground, the additional tool of having a
possession offense is necessary.''
   The nation's highest court ruled in 1982 that states may outlaw
material depicting sexual performances by children because such
material, like obscenity, is not constitutionally protected.
   But the 1982 decision dealt with producing and selling child
pornography, not the private possession of it.
   Clyde Osborne of Columbus, then 61, was prosecuted in 1985 for
possessing four photos of a nude boy believed to be 13 or 14.
Prosecutors said Osborne got the photos from a Florida mail-order
business and had placed them in a photo album in his home.
   The photos were discovered after police searched Osborne's home
on a tip that he had bought the material.
   Osborne was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail.
   The state law, as passed by the Ohio Legislature, banned
possession or viewing of ``any material or performance that shows a
minor ... in a state of nudity.'' Exemptions were included for
parents and, among other things, for photos with an artistic,
medical or scientific purpose.
   The Ohio Supreme Court, in upholding the law, narrowed its ban
to lewd depictions of nude children under 18.
   Many of the justices' questions Tuesday centered on whether the
law as originally worded or the law as construed by Ohio's highest
court is now at issue.
   Ms. Shank, representing Osborne, said the court must confine its
ruling to the law as originally written. O'Brien said the law as
construed by the Ohio Supreme Court is what is before the court.
   Whichever rendition of the state law the justices use, their
decision is expected by July.
   Some of their questions and comments focused directly on the
validity of outlawing something possessed in one's home.
   When Ms. Shank noted that the high court in 1969 ruled that
governments may not ban the private possession of obscene
materials, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist reminded her of the
court's 1982 child-porn decision and other rulings.
   ``A lot of water has flowed uner the bridge since'' the 1969
ruling, Rehnquist said.
   Justice Antonin Scalia at one point said Ohio ``asserts the only
way to dry up the child-pornography business is by making it
illegal to have this material ... the same way you attempt to dry
up elephant poaching by making it illegal to possess ivory.''
   Ms. Shank and O'Brien disagreed over how many other states have
similar laws.
   O'Brien told the justices that 18 other states have similar
laws. Briefs previously submitted identified those states as
Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois,
Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, Oklahoma, South
Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington and West Virginia.
   But Ms. Shank said not one of those states outlaws the
``viewing'' of child pornography.
   ``There is not a single statute that replicates the Ohio
statute,'' she said. ``Ours is the broadest such statute in the
country.''
   The case is Osborne vs. Ohio, 88-5986.

   Cities and other local governments may be
forced to pay civil rights damages if they interfere illegally in
labor negotiations, the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.
   By a 6-3 vote, the justices said Los Angeles city officials are
required to compensate a taxi company that went out of business
when the city canceled its franchise during a dispute between the
company and its drivers.
   The ruling, while relatively narrow, bucks a recent high court
trend limiting the application of federal civil rights laws.
   The decision does not affect state governments. The court ruled
last June that states and state officials may not be sued under the
civil rights law used in the Los Angeles case.
   In other action, the court:
   _Made it easier, in a unanimous ruling in an Ohio case, for
workers to sue their unions over alleged failures to provide fair
representation.
   _Ruled, 8-1, in a New York City case that federal judges may
punish lawyers but not their law firms for frivolous lawsuits and
needless legal maneuvers.
   _Heard arguments in an Ohio case over the power of states to
outlaw mere possession of material containing lewd depictions of
child nudity.
   In the cab company case, the Los Angeles City Council refused in
1981 to renew the Golden State Transit Corp.'s taxi franchise
because the company was caught up in a dispute with a Teamsters
union local representing company drivers.
   Golden State, with 400 cabs, had been the city's largest taxi
operator until 1980. The Teamsters called a strike for the same day
the city was to consider renewing the franchises of 13 cab
companies.
   Golden State went out of business after failing to win renewal
of its franchise.
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1986 that Los Angeles officials
improperly interfered with rights protected by the National Labor
Relations Act.
   That ruling said local governments lack authority to tip the
balance in labor disputes by defining what economic sanctions
either side might suffer.
   But the decision did not specify what remedy was available to
Golden State.
   The case went back to the lower federal courts, and last year
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied compensatory damages
to the defunct taxi company.
   A federal judge previously ordered Los Angeles officials to
grant Golden State a four-year franchise and pay the market value
of the company's assets, less what it received in bankruptcy
proceedings.
   The company said that was a hollow victory since it already had
liquidated its assets when it went out of business.
   The Supreme Court on Tuesday permitted the cab company to sue
the city under a federal civil rights law enacted after the Civil
War that generally benefits individuals rather than businesses.
   Justice John Paul Stevens said while the National Labor
Relations Act does not authorize such suits, the act ``creates
rights in labor and management that are protected against
governmental interference.''
   Therefore, he said, either side in a labor-management dispute
that is victimized by government interference may invoke the
federal civil rights law to seek compensation.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M.
Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Connor dissented.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher won a handsome
but less-than-crushing victory Tuesday against an unprecedented
challenge to her leadership of the Conservative Party.
   She won 314 out of the 374 votes by Tory members of Parliament,
while 33 supported challenger Sir Anthony Meyer, 24 abstained and
three didn't vote.
   Even though 60 of her fellow Tories did not vote for her, Mrs.
Thatcher declared that the result, with backing from 85 percent of
the parliamentary party, showed ``overwhelming support.''
   ``I'd like to say ... how very pleased I am to have had the
overwhelming support of my colleagues in the House and of the
people from the party in the country,'' she said outside her No. 10
Downing St. residence Tuesday night.
   Ordinarily, the result would have been regarded as an
unassailable vote of confidence. But in Mrs. Thatcher's case it
provoked conflicting assessments.
   The 64-year-old prime minister has been re-elected unopposed
every year since becoming Conservative leader in 1975, and has
stamped her style and authority on the party to such an extent that
any rebellion becomes a major event.
   The consensus among analysts had been that anything under 45 not
supporting her would be a crushing victory, while 100 or more would
be a devastating blow.
   ``I think she was bruised rather than fatally wounded,'' said
Eleanor Goodman, political correspondent of Independent Television
News.
   ``I think it is a troublesome result for her,'' said John Cole,
BBC-TV's political editor, broadcasting the result live to the
nation from the House of Commons.
   ``Anything below 50 (non-supporters) would have been an absolute
triumph. I think 57 is a bloody good result,'' said Norman Tebbit,
a Thatcher ally and former party chairman. He did not count the
three who did not vote.
   Meyer, 69, a little-known outsider, put up his candidacy to
rally opposition to Mrs. Thatcher's handling of the economy, her
tough style of leadership, and her reluctance to integrate Britain
deeper into the European Economic Community.
   He had said he was hoping his move would tempt more serious
contenders to declare their candidacy. But no one, including the
leading undeclared candidate, former Defense Secretary Michael
Heseltine, joined the contest.
   Meyer conceded that the prime minister, already 10 years in
office, was entitled to feel ``pretty pleased with the result.''
   But the outcome was expected to keep speculation alive about a
more closely run contest next year if the economy does not improve
and Mrs. Thatcher's poll showings slump.
   Thatcher government policies are blamed for an annual inflation
rate of 7.3 percent, a falling pound and 15-percent interest rates.
   Mrs. Thatcher was having her weekly meeting with Queen Elizabeth
II when the last ballots were counted in a committee room at the
House of Commons and the result was announced.
   Her campaign manager, George Younger, said the result was
conveyed to her at Buckingham Palace immediately.
   Mrs. Thatcher ousted Prime Minister Edward Heath for the party
leadership and came to power when the Conservatives won the 1979
general election.
   She is in her third term as prime minister following Tory
victories in the 1983 and 1987 general elections. She is the
longest serving prime minister this century.
   Meyer, a former diplomat, told Britain's Sky Television before
the vote: ``She is sticking very grimly to the defense of every
shred of British nationalism and refusing to consider any further
pooling of sovereignty such as would be necessary to enable the
(12-nation) European Community to proceed successfully forward ....
She seems to spend half her time poisoning the public's mind
against the European Community.''
   He added: ``If you listen to almost any group of Members of
Parliament talking privately, one thing they are all agreed on is
that the prime minister's style has become intolerably bossy, that
she doesn't listen to any of her Cabinet ministers, she treats them
like errand boys .... There is a narrowness, an intolerance about
her.''

<HEAD>Red Army Faction Claims No One Can Escape Their Assaults</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Red Army Faction terrorists, who
killed West German financier Alfred Herrhausen last week, declared
in a letter delivered Tuesday that no one is safe from their
assaults.
   They also demanded that their jailed comrades be housed together.
   The letter, dated Saturday and stamped with the group's
signature symbol, a star and machine gun, was received by a Western
news agency in Bonn. It described Herrhausen, chairman of the
Deutsche Bank, as Europe's most powerful economic figure and said
he had been ``executed'' for that reason.
   Herrhausen's plan for resolving the Third World debt crisis was
``nothing other than an attempt to ensure long-term domination and
plundering,'' said the letter, sent by mail with false return
address.
   ``There is no place in the world for the leaders of this system
and there can be no protection against the attacks of revolutionary
guerrilla units,'' it said.
   Spokesmen for the federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe said
they viewed the letter as an authentic claim of responsibility from
the Red Army Faction, which had been dormant for three years until
the Herrhausen assassination.
   His armored Mercedes was blown up by a remote-control bomb in
Bad Homburg, where he lived, as he was being driven to work Nov. 30.
   Authorities searched about 150 apartments Monday night in
Darmstadt, acting on information from more than 1,000 reports and
tips relayed to the Federal Crime Bureau in Wiesbaden, said bureau
spokesman Willy Terstiege.
   He said no useful evidence was found.
   Agents obtained search warrants for an entire apartment building
after receiving reports that the bombers might be hiding there, he
Terstiege said.
   An organization in Hamburg called the Prisoners Information
Bureau, which speaks for jailed Red Army Faction terrorists, said
the cells of 26 had been searched in the past week in connection
with the Herrhausen case.

   Federal judges may punish lawyers but not
their law firms for frivolous lawsuits and needless legal
maneuvers, the Supreme Court ruled today.
   Voting 8-1 to overturn a $50,000 penalty against a now-dissolved
New York City law firm, the justices said a federal court rule is
aimed only at the lawyers who sign the offending documents. The
rule does not apply to those lawyers' law firms, the court said.
   The rule at issue says courts may deal with an offending
document by imposing ``on the person who signed it ... an
appropriate sanction.''
   Writing for the court, Justice Antonin Scalia said, ``Just as
the requirement of signature is imposed upon the individual, we
think the recited import and consequences of signature run as to
him.''
   The federal rule requires litigating lawyers to inquire before
attaching the required signature to any filing whether it has merit.
   Scalia said, ``Where the text establishes a duty that cannot be
delegated, one may reasonably expect it to authorize punishment
only of the party upon whom the duty is placed.''
   Justice Thurgood Marshall was the sole dissenter, calling
today's decison ``an unnecessary erosion of the discretion of
federal trial judges.''
   In other action, the court:
   _Made it easier for workers to sue their unions over alleged
failures to offer fair representation.
   The court unanimously reinstated a federal lawsuit a Toledo,
Ohio, area sheet metal worker filed against his union five years
ago.
   Lower courts had thrown out the suit, ruling the plaintiff was
alleging an unfair labor practice and that the National Labor
Relations Board has exclusive jurisdiction over such claims. The
justices said those courts were wrong.
   _Ruled that cities and other local governments that interfere
illegally in labor negotiations may be forced to pay damages for
losses suffered by management or workers.
   The court ruled, 6-3, that Los Angeles officials are required to
compensate a taxi company that went out of business after the city
interfered in a dispute between the company and its driver.
   The lawyer-sanctions case stemmed from a 1982 lawsuit filed by
Northern J. Calloway, an actor who plays the character David on
television's ``Sesame Street.''
   Calloway sued Marvel Entertainment Group and others, accusing
them of copyright infringement and other violations on a proposed
animated science fiction movie to be called ``The Skyrider.''
   His suit sought $44 million in damages.
   A federal judge dismissed the suit and imposed $100,000 in
sanctions against Calloway, $50,000 against his lawyer, Ray
LeFlore, and $50,000 against the former law firm of Pavelic and
LeFlore.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the penalties
against LeFlore and the law firm, stating, ``Calloway's case was at
all times very weak. From the very beginning (his) case suffered
from obvious and grave weaknesses.''
   For example, the appeals court said, none of the people sued
made any money from the proposed movie project.
   Today's decision reversed the 2nd Circuit court's ruling
regarding the law firm's sanction.
   LeFlore did not ask the high court to overturn the $50,000
penalty assessed against him personally.
   The case is Pavelic &amp; LeFlore vs. Marvel Entertainment, 88-791.

<HEAD>NEA President Calls For Bold Pre-School Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All children entering school should be ready
to learn, the head of the nation's largest teachers' union said
Tuesday in proposing federally financed pre-school programs for
poor youngsters that integrate nutrition, prenatal care and health
screening.
   ``No child should be allowed to fall through the cracks,'' said
Keith Geiger, president of the National Education Association.
``Every child should arrive at school physically, intellectually,
emotionally and socially able to learn.''
   Geiger said the NEA will offer ideas on what the nation's
education goals should be during a Thursday meeting of the
Education Task Force of the National Governors' Association.
   The task force has been working on a set of national performance
goals for education since the idea was approved in September at the
Education Summit called by President Bush and attended by the
nation's governors. All 50 governors are to convene in late
February to put on the finishing touches.
   In a Dec. 1 letter to the task force co-chairmen, Geiger
suggested the goals ``be both ambitious and specific: ambitious
enough to demonstrate that America's leaders understand the depth
of the problems schools face, specific enough to enable Americans
to hold government accountable.''
   Geiger said improving pre-school education should be the primary
focus of reform efforts. He said programs designed to provide
prenatal care, nutritional support, health screening and
developmental child care must be made available to all families of
young children in need.
   Head Start has been touted as the most successful pre-school
program financed by the federal government. About 1,300 Head Start
programs operate around the country, providing education, health
and nutrition services to about 20 percent of the improverished
pre-schoolers who are eligible.
   President Bush recently signed a law to increase spending for
the Head Start program this fiscal year by $147 million to $1.6
billion.
   The NEA estimated that about $6.3 billion is needed to serve all
eligible children aged 3 through 5.
   Other proposals the NEA wants incorporated into the national
performance goals are ones to:
   _Provide a fully qualified teacher for every classroom. Salaries
and benefits should be competitive with other fields that require
comparable skills, preparation and responsibility.
   _End school financing patterns that make the quality of
education dependent on the wealth of the local school district.
   _Provide teachers with tools other professionals take for
granted _ a telephone, adequate work space, a personal computer and
access to clerical support.
   _Focus learning on critical thinking and encourage teachers,
employees, parents and communities to become involved in decisions
that affect the schools.
   _Reduce the dropout rate to less than 10 percent.
   _Make grants and affordable loans available to all high school
graduates in economic need so they are guaranteed access to higher
education or postsecondary training.

<HEAD>Five Guerrilla Infiltrators Killed, Palestinian Protester Dies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers Tuesday killed five heavily
armed Arab guerrillas who crossed the border from Egypt and planned
a ``spectacular'' terrorist attack to mark the anniversary of the
Palestinian uprising, the army said.
   Israeli jets staged their second raid into Lebanon in the past
12 days in an attempt to forestall further infiltrations coinciding
with the uprising's second anniversary on Friday. Lebanese police
said seven people were wounded.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, a Palestinian teen-ager was killed
and 20 Palestinians were wounded in stone-throwing clashes with
troops, Arab doctors said.
   The death raised to 626 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli gunfire during the uprising against Israel's occupation of
the West Bank and Gaza. Forty-three Israelis have died since the
``intefadeh,'' as the revolt is called, began on Dec. 8, 1987.
   The clash in the Negev desert occurred before dawn when an
Israeli force encountered the five guerrillas and gave chase. The
soldiers killed all the guerrillas in the hilly area of Mount Harif
and suffered no casualties themselves, the army said.
   Maj. Gen. Matan Vilnai, head of the army's southern command,
said the infiltration was apparently linked to the uprising
anniversary.
   ``We can assume there is a link between these things. ... There
is no doubt that organizations which we confront would try to carry
out such an attack,'' he said on armed forces radio.
   The guerrillas carried Soviet-designed Kalashnikov assault
rifles, 51 hand grenades, a pistol with magazines, binoculars and
wire cutters, and were on their way to a ``spectacular attack'' in
Israel, the army said.
   Vilnai said the guerrillas' equipment ``shows they simply meant
to kill. Not to argue too much, not to carry out a hostage-taking
operation, but a killing operation.''
   ``They carried no documents, and as a result we cannot know to
what group they belonged,'' he added.
   It was the first infiltration in nine months from Egypt, the
only Arab country to have a peace treaty with Israel. The last
occurred March 15, 1989, when two guerrillas from a fundamentalist
Moslem group were captured near the border town of Rafah.
   There have been at least 50 infiltrations this year from
Lebanon. Israel staged its 17th raid of the year on guerrilla bases
there Tuesday.
   Four fighters struck the base of terrorist mastermind Abu
Nidal's Fatah Revolutionary Council in the Majdalioun Valley, east
of Sidon, a Lebanese police spokesman said. Seven people were
reported wounded.
   The Israeli army said all aircraft returned safely.
   On Nov. 25, Israeli jets attacked bases of the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command in Lebanon.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, soldiers opened fire to disperse
Palestinian stone-throwers, killing a 17-year-old and wounding 20
other demonstrators, hospital officials said. They said Nasser
al-Kejek was fatally wounded in the chest.
   The army said Tuesday that all schools in Gaza will be closed
starting Wednesday ``until further notice,'' apparently to prevent
riots linked to the uprising anniversary.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, in a speech in Tel Aviv devoted
to the anniversary, said that ``politically, the Palestinians this
year ... are in a much weaker situation than they were a year ago.''
   Rabin said ``stone-throwing in the Middle East'' was low on the
international agenda but noted it was bothering Israel, since 85
percent of violent incidents in the territories were
stone-throwings.
   However, Rabin said, ``they cannot move the bulk of Palestinians
to demonstrations, no doubt violent demonstrations. All the
attempts at civil disobedience have failed completely.''
   The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied
Territories said Tuesday that 132 children under the age of 17 have
been shot and killed in the uprising, including 37 under the age of
13.
   It said the number of casualties among children is increasing.
   Rabin and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir were briefed Tuesday by
assistant U.S. Secretary of State John Kelly on last weekend's
summit between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   ``The situation in the region does not depend on the decision of
world powers, even superpowers,'' Shamir said afterward. ``The
situation depends on us and our neighbors, and the solution will be
found in agreement between Israel and its neighbors. We should not
expect salvation from the superpowers.''

<HEAD>Ortega Offers Extending Deadline For Contra Dismantling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega proposed
extending until the end of the year Tuesday's deadline for the
U.S.-backed Contra rebel force to disband.
   The anti-Sandinista fighters say the will not demobilize until
all conditions of the August Central American peace accord are met.
   Ortega said he will present his offer to extend the deadline to
disband the Contras at a summit of Central American presidents set
for Dec. 10-12 in Costa Rica.
   Speaking before thousands of people at the Plaza of the
Revolution on Monday night, Ortega called for ``a new popular
insurrection to defeat the Yankees.''
   The occasion was the official start of campaigning for the
general elections scheduled for Feb. 25.
   Ortega is running for re-election. His main challenger is
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the U.S.-backed candidate nominated by
the 14-party National Opposition Union coalition.
   ``I'm going to ask at the summit that Dec. 31 be set as the new
deadline for the demobilization of the Contras,'' Ortega told the
crowd.
   About 5,000 Contras are living in Honduras jungle camps near the
Nicaraguan border and are receiving non-lethal aid from the United
States. There also are an estimated 6,000 Contras in Nicaragua.
   Ortega on Nov. 1 lifted a cease-fire with the Contras that had
been in effect for 19 months, saying the rebels had begun
infiltrating into Nicaragua by the thousands and that their attacks
had increased dramatically.
   Subsequent peace talks between government and rebel delegations
at the United Nations and the Organization of American States
failed, and no further talks have been scheduled.
   Mistrust between the Sandinistas and the Contras has intensified
since then and the Contra have been placed on alert, according to
officials in Washington.
   For the past month, Sandinista forces have been massing along
the north-south central Nicaragua corridor where the Contras
operate, but the troops have not launched an offensive.
   The Sandinista army is believed to be in a position to launch an
offensive against the Contra camps within 72 hours, officials in
Washington said on condition of anonymity.
   The Sandinistas have protested continued U.S. aid to the Contras
in the camps, but Washington says it will continue until after the
election.
   Tuesday's deadline for disbanding the Contra forces was set in
August as part of a regional peace accord agreed to by Ortega and
the presidents of Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and Costa Rica.
   The agreement called for a ``voluntary'' demobilization,
however, and the rebels have cited that in insisting that they will
not disband until democratic condition exist in Nicaragua.
   The Sandinista People's Army and Interior Ministry forces have
battled the Contras in scattered skirmishes. Nine Contras were
reported killed since Friday in four clashes in three provinces.
Six Interior Ministry soldiers were killed in an ambush in another
province.

<HEAD>Gonzalez Confirmed for 3rd Term as Spanish Prime Minister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Felipe Gonzalez won parliamentary approval
on the first ballot Tuesday for his third-straight term as Spain's
prime minister.
   A total of 167 lower-house deputies voted in favor of the
Socialist leader, the bare-minimum majority necessary for first
ballot confirmation.
   Due to court rulings annuling the Oct. 29 election of 18
deputies in three voting districts, the number of deputies in the
lower house, or Cortes, has been reduced temporarily to 332 from
350.
   All 166 of the Socialist deputies voted for Gonzalez, along with
Luis Mardones, the sole deputy of the Independent Coalition of the
Canary Islands. Another 155 deputies voted against Gonzalez and six
abstained.
   Four other deputies-elect, who belong to the Herri Batasuna
Party, considered the political wing of the armed Basque separatist
group ETA, were not eligible to vote after refusing Monday to swear
allegiance to the Spanish constitution.
   Without the support of at least one non-Socialist deputy,
Gonzalez would have had to wait 48 hours for probable confirmation
with a plurality on a second ballot.
   The courts have ordered repeat elections by March in the North
African enclave of Melilla, and the provinces of Murcia and
Pontevedra.
   Gonzalez told parliament Monday he would call for a vote of
confidence once all 350 deputies are elected.
   The 47-year-old former labor lawyer has headed the Socialist
Party since 1974. He was elected to four-year terms in 1982 and
1986.
   Spaniards vote for party slates under a system of proportional
representation based on results tabulated in the 52 electoral
districts.

<HEAD>Escaped Terrorist Suspects in Namibia Linked to Death Squads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three suspected right-wing
terrorists who escaped custody in Namibia had been linked to South
African-based death squads believed to have killed two white
activists, police said Tuesday.
   South Africa's state-run television reported that police were
investigating the possibility the escape may have been arranged by
a far-right group that had drawn up a ``hit list'' of potential
assassination targets.
   The report said five suspected members of the group had been
arrested. It did not identify the organization or give further
details.
   The escapees _ two South Africans and a West German _
overpowered police guards Monday and fled in a car with two
accomplices near Windhoek, Namibia's territorial capital.
   One of the officers, Ricardo van Wyk, was hit in the spine by a
shot from his own revolver, which was seized. He was unconscious in
a Windhoek hospital Tuesday, and doctors said he might be paralyzed.
   The escapees had been charged with murdering a black security
guard in a hand grenade attack on a United Nations office in
northern Namibia in August. South African police said the three
were connected to two former South African police officers held in
the assassinations of David Webster of Johannesburg on May 1 and
Anton Lubowksi of Windhoek on Sept. 12.
   Police have said the ex-officers also have been linked to death
squads, some of which allegedly existed in the national police
force.
   Webster was a university lecturer and human rights advocate.
Lubowski was the only white official of the South-West Africa
People's Organization, the main independence movement in Namibia.
   The grenade attack on the U.N. office in the town of Outjo and
the assassination of Lubowski were the most publicized incidents of
violence during the campaign for U.N.-supervised pre-independence
elections in November.
   SWAPO, which waged a 23-year guerrilla war for independence from
South Africa, won a majority in an assembly that is now drafting a
constitution. Independence is expected by early next year.
   Some right-wing whites accused the U.N. monitoring force of
favoring SWAPO in the election.
   The head of the U.N. contingent, Martti Ahtisaari, said Tuesday
it appeared that arrangements for moving the escapees between their
cells and a courthouse were ``surprisingly lax.''
   The three had been charged with the murder of David Hosaeb, 22,
a private security guard at the U.N. office.
   They were identified as Horst Klenz, 52, of West Germany, and
Darrell Stopforth, 22, and Leonard Veenendal, 23, both South
Africans.
   Veenendal headed the Johannesburg branch of the Afrikaner
Resistance Movement, whose members advocate creation of a
whites-only state and often wear khaki uniforms with swastika-style
emblems.
   One of the ex-policemen held in the killing of the white
activists is Ferdinand Barnard, a former detective convicted in
1984 of murdering two drug suspects. The other is Calla Botha, a
well-known rugby player who was a member of the Brixton Murder and
Robbery Squad, the unit investigating the assassinations.
   On Monday, Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said police had
made progress in their investigation of South African death squads
believed involved in the slayings.
   The national police force has been criticized widely for its
failure to solve dozens of killings of anti-government activists
since 1978. Opposition groups have demanded the appointment of an
independent judicial commission to conduct the investigations.

   East Germany's fallen Communist
leaders were under house arrest Tuesday at an exclusive estate
here, the focal point of an investigation into their alleged
extravagant lifestyle at public expense.
   But the gates of the walled, park-like Wandlitz compound were
still open. Delegations of schoolchildren on field trips visited to
see how their former leaders lived.
   The fenced-in perimeter of the vast, mostly wooded area 25 miles
north of East Berlin was calm and virtually deserted Tuesday
evening, with few cars traveling the snow-dusted roads around the
compound.
   The accused leaders were forbidden to leave the compound, but a
soldier on patrol said no extra security had been ordered to seal
off exits.
   Earlier, the official news agency ADN said ailing former leader
Erich Honecker and unspecified other disgraced top officials would
not be allowed to leave Wandlitz, which has become a symbol for
official abuse of power.
   ADN did not say how many former Communist leaders were under
arrest at the estate's 23 houses. Officials at Wandlitz said they
also did not know how many were there or whether special security
was in force at the houses.
   A reporter's request to enter the estate was politely refused.

   Fifteen people trapped by a fire raging in a
nine-story downtown building Tuesday were plucked from the roof by
a helicopter, authorities said. Forty people were injured in the
fire.
   The building housed apartments and businesses, said Fire
Department spokesman Jim Wells. The fire broke out just before noon
and was out in about a half-hour.
   In addition to those rescued by helicopter, about 30 others
escaped down ladders extended to the sixth and seventh floors of
the building, said Manny Hernandez, another Fire Department
spokesman.
   ``They were scared and crying. The women were crying and hugging
each other when they got to the ground,'' Hernandez said.
   Flames shot out the windows and smoke billowed across the
downtown skyline from the fire, which started on the sixth floor
and burned part of the seventh floor, Hernandez said. Smoke damage
occurred throughout the upper floors, he said.
   Of the 40 people hurt, 18 were hospitalized, authorities said,
most for smoke inhalation. None of the 15 people plucked from the
roof of the building was injured, authorities said.
   ``I was working on the seventh floor and I smelled smoke. I
called to people, `Fire, I smell smoke, everyone out, fire!,'''
Chris Jeong, 28, said.
   John Tang, who manages a sixth-floor clothing manufacturing
business called New Seasons, said he told his employees to stand by
the windows as soon as he smelled the smoke.
   ``I told them not to be afraid, that there was fresh air,'' Tang
said as he sat on a Fire Department mat in the street.
   Eventually, firefighters escorted the workers from the building
while Tang stayed behind briefly to make sure no one was left. He
said he believed everyone got out safely.

<HEAD>Pentagon: No Plans to Protest Detention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States does not plan to protest the
detention of U.S. military observers by Soviet officers in East
Germany last week, an incident the Pentagon revealed Tuesday to
have been the fifth of its kind in the past year.
   Five Soviet military observer teams were detained by Western
military forces in West Germany over the same period, said Pentagon
spokesman Pete Williams.
   Asked whether the detentions amounted to tit-for-tat events,
Williams said, ``I am only reporting the facts.''
   In announcing that the Pentagon had no plans to protest the
latest incident, Williams said, ``No one senses that they were
unreasonably detained.''
   A U.S. officer and non-commissioned officer were held for 7{
hours near Halle, about 80 miles southwest of Berlin, and a tire on
their car slashed with a bayonet.
   The detention took place Friday on the eve of President Bush's
summit with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, but it was not
made public until reporters made inquiries in Washington on Monday.
   Williams, adding fresh details during a briefing Tuesday, said
the U.S. soldiers were stopped in their car by a man dressed in
civilian clothes who informed them that they were in a restricted
zone.
   ``The tour tried to leave, but was blocked. Another individual
in civilian clothing punctured the vehicle's left front tire with a
bayonet,'' Williams said. ``Then a Soviet investigation officer
arrived and indicated to the U.S. tour officer that that was an
overreaction, the puncturing of the tire.''
   The spokesman said U.S. Army officials in Europe found the
Soviet officer who came to investigate ``cordial, professional and
thorough,'' and that the two American soldiers were found not to
have been in a restricted area.
   ``No U.S. personnel were threatened. They did not perceive a
threat to their safety,'' Williams said.
   The spokesman said no one was injured and the U.S. soldiers
returned to their base in the East Germany city of Potsdam near
Berlin.
   Williams said it appeared that the man who had slashed the tire
was a Soviet officer.
   He said the Americans were detained for such a long time because
the Soviet investigating officer had to come some distance and then
conducted a very thorough investigation.
   The observers are part of the U.S. military mission that was
established under a 1947 accord that allows the Western allies and
the Soviets to set up offices in each other's occupation zones.
Under this pact, the United States, Britain and France have
military liaison offices in East Germany, which is the old Soviet
occupation zone, and the Soviets have three in West Germany, one in
each of the old U.S, British and French zones. Each office may have
a staff of 14 soldiers.
   Asked what the two U.S. officers were doing at the time of the
incident Friday, Williams said, ``They were doing what U.S.
military liaison mission people do. They go out and they look
around. It's similar to what the Soviet military mission does,
based out of Frankfurt.''
   The detention came despite the signing in June of a U.S.-Soviet
agreement designed to avoid dangerous military incidents reached
between then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William
Crowe, and top Soviet military officials.
   On Monday, the Pentagon also announced that U.S. and Soviet
officials met in Washington in August and in Moscow in November to
prepare for implementation of the safety accord. The agreement is
scheduled formally to come into force Jan. 1.
   In March 1985, a Soviet sentry shot an unarmed U.S. Army major,
Arthur D. Nicholson Jr., and let him to die without medical aid,
saying Nicholson had been ``caught red-handed'' taking pictures in
a restricted area of East Germany.

   A convicted killer drove a fire truck in
an attempt to escape prison, ramming fences, gates and other
vehicles during a rampage that ended when she crashed into a tree.
   Shirley Wolf, 20, will ``very likely be charged with attempted
escape with force,'' said Ross Dykes, associate warden at the
California Institution for Women.
   Wolf, sentenced at 14 for the first-degree stabbing murder of an
85-year-old woman, apparently scaled an inner fence at the prison
to get to the fire truck Monday night, officials said.
   ``She started a one-ton fire truck and began driving erratically
from the fire station, striking several other maintenance
vehicles,'' Dykes said. Wolf then drove through a gate.
   ``Wolf then used the truck to ram a narrow fenced entry to get
into a yard area. Unsuccessful, she accelerated rapidly in reverse
and struck a tree. We then placed the inmate under control,'' he
said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC, which canceled Jackie Mason's ``Chicken
Soup'' last month, on Tuesday canceled two more new series,
``Homeroom'' and ``Living Dolls,'' and added two new series, one an
NBC castoff.
   ABC also said it is moving ``Mission: Impossible'' from
Thursdays to Saturdays as of Jan. 6, and taking ``Mr. Belvedere''
off the air after the show's Dec. 30 telecast. It will bring that
show back later this season.
   ABC's new series are ``Father Dowling Mysteries,'' starring Tom
Bosley as a crime-solving priest, and the self-explanatory
``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' which had strong ratings as a
Nov. 26 special.
   Bosley's series, which NBC aired last year, now will air
Thursdays on ABC, and debut on Jan. 4. ABC's other new show will
premiere Jan. 14, when ABC's new ``Free Spirit'' also will be moved
up by a half-hour to a new 8:30 p.m. EST time period Sundays.
   The two canceled ABC series were among last week's lowest-rated
network shows. The network's changes raised to seven the number of
new network shows dropped since the season began in September. NBC
earlier canceled ``Nutt House,'' and CBS axed ``The People Next
Door,'' ``Peaceable Kingdom'' and ``Top of the Hill.''

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of Czechoslovakia's two
republics named the first government in 41 years dominated by
non-Communists, and talks began with opposition leaders on their
demands for a new national government.
   Leaders of the Communist-controlled labor organization took the
unprecedented step of endorsing a general strike that the
opposition has threatened if the national government is not changed
this week.
   An Interior Ministry announcement said work on dismantling
fortifications on the border with Austria would begin Monday. The
government said last week some of the barbed wire, watch towers and
trip wires would be taken down.
   About 2,000 demonstrating students chanted ``Resign! Resign!''
as Ladislav Adamec, the Communist premier, met with dissident
playwright Vaclav Havel on demands for a new Cabinet to replace the
Communist-dominated one chosen Sunday.
   Jiri Dienstbier, spokesman for Havel's opposition group, Civic
Forum, said the discussions would continue Wednesday. Miroslav
Pavel, who is head of state television and attended the talks, said
they were ``very complicated.''
   Opposition groups say the general strike will take place Monday
unless the 21-member Cabinet, which contains only five
non-Communists, is replaced before then.
   Dienstbier called the new Czech government ``a step in the right
direction,'' but said its composition still was not an accurate
reflection of public opinion.
   The parliamentary commission investigating the police violence
Nov. 17 that started the nation's peaceful revolt, said Tuesday
that ousted Communist Party chief Milos Jakes and Miroslav Stepan,
the former Prague party boss, ``bear direct political
responsibility'' for the crackdown.
   It proposed that six senior police officers be fired to prevent
them influencing the investigation.
   The Czech cabinet named to serve under Premier Frantisek Pitra,
a Communist, includes nine non-Communists and seven members of the
party. It is the first government of any kind in Czechoslovakia
since 1948 not to be dominated by Communists.
   Two ministers are from the Socialist Party and two from the
People's Party, both of which had been docile allies of the
Communists but are playing an increasingly independent role.
   After the government was announced, the People's Party demanded
an immediate change to give non-Communists more power. It also
demanded the party relinquish control of the Czech interior
ministry, which oversees the regional police.
   In a statement, the party said it wants 50 percent of cabinet
posts given to non-party experts, with the Communists and two other
parties sharing the other half.
   Dienstbier said Civic Forum endorsed the People's Party demands.
   Under Czechoslovakia's federal system, the Czech and Slovak
governments have responsibility for several areas in which the
opposition wants reforms, such as education, justice and culture.
Communists still dominate the Slovak regional government.
   Miroslav Toman, first deputy prime minister of the Czech
government, defended retention by Communists of the Interior
Ministry and other key portfolios such as finance, agriculture and
industry by suggesting other parties did not necessarily have
qualified candidates.
   Asked how soon the regional government wanted free elections, a
central demand of the opposition, he said it favored ``very swift
adoption'' of a new law.
   Late Tuesday, the regional party released the text of its
program for economic and political reform. Central Commitee member
Jan Siroky described it as ``a platform for the revival of the
Communist Party from the grassroots.''
   Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets Monday to
protest the new national Cabinet, which includes 16 Communists and
many holdovers from the last government. They also called for free
elections by July.
   The opposition has won astounding concessions from the
Communists since protests of police suppression of peaceful
demonstrators Nov. 17 led to a mass movement for democracy.
   Adamec agreed last week to name a new coalition government and
relinquish the party's 41-year hold on power. A day later,
Parliament voted to remove consitutional provisions that gave the
party a power monopoly.
   At Monday's rally, Vaclav Maly, an opposition spokesman, was
cheered loudly when he said Civic Forum and its Slovak counterpart,
Public Against Violence, would run candidates when free elections
are held.
   More cheers went up when other opposition members demanded the
truth about the Warsaw Pact invasion that crushed the ``Prague
Spring'' of reform in 1968.
   After the national Communist Party reversed 21 years of policy
Friday and declared the invasion a mistake, it was officially
condemned Monday by the Soviet Union and the four other Warsaw Pact
nations who participated. The statement was printed without comment
in official Czechoslovak dailies Tuesday.
   In a nationally televised address, national party leader Karel
Urbanek said he discussed the ``tragic events of August 1968'' with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the Warsaw Pact meeting
Monday in Moscow.
   ``The new party leadership fully identified itself with the
inspirational sources of the Prague Spring,'' Urbanek declared. He
said the party's new action program calls for the political
rehabilitation of those expelled from the party after the invasion.

New Yorker, has died. she was 76.
   Swenson, who lived here during the winter and in Sea Cliff,
N.Y., summers, died Monday at Peninsula General Hospital in
Salisbury, Md.
   The cause of death was not immediately known, her sister,
Margaret Swenson Woodbury of Provo, Utah, said Tuesday. Swenson had
high blood pressure and asthma, Woodbury said.

   She published nine volumes of poems. Besides the New Yorker, she
also wrote for Atlantic Monthly and Saturday Review.
   ``She wrote about natural things _ animals and the out-of-doors
and the latest in science technology and she wrote about places and
things she had seen around the world and about her family,''
Woodbury said.
   Swenson's latest work, ``In Other Words,'' was publishjed three
years ago. Swenson was awarded a $375,000 MacArthur Foundation
Fellowship two years ago, Woodbury said.
   Swenson lived with longtime companion and author R.R. Knudson.
   She is survived by four brothers and four sisters.

<HEAD>IRS Said Looking at Nancy Reagan's Use of Borrowed Dresses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service is investigating
to determine whether former President Reagan and his wife, Nancy,
owe taxes on designer gowns she borrowed, a government source said
Tuesday.
   The source, speaking on condition he not be identified, said the
IRS was acting at least partly on the basis of information from M.
Chris Blazakis, a freelance journalist who previously worked for
the designer Galanos.
   Galanos lent dresses to Mrs. Reagan.
   Blazakis, who is said to be writing a book about the Reagans,
could not be reached. He is reported to be living in New York, but
there was no answer at a Manhattan telephone listed to a C.
Blazakis.
   A report of the IRS investigation appeared in Tuesday's
Washington Post, quoting Blazakis as saying he shared ``detailed
information with the IRS'' and the agency has launched a
``comprehensive examination.''
   The Reagans' spokesman, Mark Weinberg, said from the former
president's office in Los Angeles that the Reagans were out of town
and he had not been able to ask them about the report.
   Wilson Fadely, a spokesman for the IRS, said, ``By law, we can't
comment, confirm or deny, whether anyone is under investigation.''
   The Reagans' tax attorney, Roy Miller of Los Angeles, did not
return a reporter's telephone call seeking comment.
   Jill Brett, a spokeswoman for the National Archives, said IRS
agents visited the Archives in October or November and examined a
large number of photographs from the Reagan White House, with the
Reagans' permission, and requested copies of some.
   ``They did not tell us what they were looking for, and we did
not ask,'' Ms. Brett said.
   The Post quoted sources as saying that the IRS had questioned
employees at Galanos Originals in Los Angeles and at U.S. Shoe
Corp., headquartered in Cincinnati, among others.
   Jim Crowe, an attorney for U.S. Shoe, said, ``We'd rather not
get involved in it. That matter really is between us and the IRS
and the IRS and Mrs. Reagan.''
   Paul Shaw, Galanos' business manager, also declined comment,
saying, ``I don't know what happened between Blazakis and Mr.
Galanos.'' Asked if he knew of an IRS investigation, he said he
regarded the matter as confidential.
   The Post quoted Blazakis as saying the Justice Department was
also investigating the allegations. Department spokesman David
Runkel said, ``I think we have been notified, but are not involved
in anything at this time.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said last year there was
``no illegality'' because the White House counsel's office had
determined that there were no tax consequences from the transaction.
   A.B. Culvahouse, a Washington attorney who was White House
counsel at the time, did not return a reporter's telephone call.
   David Berenson, chief Washington tax lawyer for the law firm of
Ernst and Young, said the tax questions involved are ``very gray.''
   ``There are a lot of cases saying that any use of property
without recompense has either gift or compensatory implications,''
Berenson said.
   On the other hand, he said, ``It's a question of whose benefit
this is for.'' He argued that the designers who loaned the dresses
might be the ones who received the benefit by having their gowns
worn by the first lady. He said it also might be difficult to
establish a fair market value.
   The Post said several tax experts whom it interviewed last year
said that the dresses by Galanos, Adolfo and other designers, some
of which were worth $20,000, should be regarded as interest-free
loans and therefore taxable income to Nancy Reagan.
   Mrs. Reagan has acknowledged borrowing the designer gowns during
her years in the White House, but former President Reagan did not
list them as loans on his government financial disclosure
statements or declare their value on the couple's income tax
returns.

   A 16-year-old boy shot a schoolmate in
the back of the head and then fatally shot himself on a bus
carrying 40 students to high school Tuesday, police said.
   Robert Butler of Clairton, a junior at Serra Catholic High
School in McKeesport, was pronounced dead at 8:40 a.m. at
McKeesport Hospital, said Police Chief Thomas Brletic.
   Adam Ference of Clairton, also a 16-year-old junior, was in
critical condition at Presbyterian-University Hospital in
Pittsburgh, Brletic said. A hospital spokesman said the family
asked that no information be released.
   Brletic said police have no idea why the shooting occurred,
although several students noticed that Butler seemed ``moody.''
   ``We're trying to understand why this young man would bring a
gun with him on a school bus, shoot a youngster sitting in front of
him and take his own life,'' the chief said.
   Counselors were sent to the school to talk to the students.
   Brletic said Butler boarded the bus at his normal stop and
pushed past several students to get to his usual seat. Ference
boarded afterward and sat directly in front of Butler.
   During the bus ride, Butler punched the back of the seat in
front of him, prompting Ference to turn around and ask why he had
done so, Brletic said. Butler did not answer, and no further words
were exchanged, he said.
   Minutes later, when the bus was about 100 yards from school,
Butler shot Ference with a .32-caliber revolver, then put the gun
to his temple and fired, killing himself, the chief said.
   The gun belonged to Butler's father, William Butler, a former
Clairton patrolman, Brletic said.
   After the shots, the students started screaming and the bus
driver pulled into the school entrance and stopped. Students fled
the bus.
   Butler was a good student and had no history of problems at
school, Brletic said.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union sharply warned West Germany at a
meeting of their foreign ministers on Tuesday that pushing for
German reunification at this time can only bring trouble, the
Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   It said Eduard Shevardnadze recalled Soviet experience with a
strong Germany during World War II in telling Hans-Dietrich
Genscher ``propaganda about a federation of the two Germanys can
only exacerbate turmoil in the current circumstances.''
   The official news agency quoted Shevardnadze as saying:
   ``An attempt to use difficulties in the reconstruction process
in socialist countries for one-sided, selfish goals, without taking
into account the long-term general European interests, can threaten
the accumulated positive developments, stability and peace on the
continent.''
   Genscher also met Tuesday with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to
discuss what was once unthinkable for the Soviets: German
reunification.
   Following the defeat of Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany, the German
state became divided into two nations _ communist East Germany, in
the Soviet sphere, and capitalistic, pro-Western West Germany.
   At the weekend summit in Malta, Gorbachev told President Bush
that ``reunification gave the Soviet Union some problems that could
push it too hard, too fast, could create some real tension,''
according to Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   Genscher told a news conference later he assured Gorbachev both
Germanys ``will keep in mind their responsibility for the security
of the whole of Europe.''
   For the Soviet Union, which says it lost 20 million people to
the Nazis in the war, theoretical queries on the prospect of a
reunited Germany have long brought flat rejection.
   Shevardnadze told Genscher, ``The current developments touch on
deep-rooted interests of the Soviet Union, the countries of the
Warsaw Pact and finally all Europeans. The Soviet people well
remember history and the tragic lesson of the Second World War. Our
public opinion is sensitive to everything relating to its result.
No one should forget this.''
   Gorbachev in recent weeks has tempered his previous clear
opposition as political upheaval in East Germany brought the
question to the forefront of international discussion, and West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl offered a detailed process for
possible reunification.
   While objecting to any immediate call for reunification,
Gorbachev has indicated a willingness to let history decide.
   Tass said Monday that, ``Despite the acuteness of the problem,
the Soviet Union is prepared to discuss it in the spirit of new
thinking, presupposing respect for the stand of the other.''
   But according to Tass, Shevardnadze's side of the discussion
that resulted was strongly worded. He said some of the 10 points in
Kohl's reunification plan sounded like orders to East Germany,
``demanding irreversible changes in its political and economic
system.''
   A separate Tass report on Gorbachev's comment to Genscher was
far milder. The president said that under the present circumstances
of rapid change in Europe and improving relations between East and
West, ``it is especially important to support international
stability and to strengthen security,'' Tass reported.
   ``This suggests self-restraint, responsibility and deliberation
in actions from all states, and loyal cooperation on the basis of
generally accepted principles,'' Tass added, paraphrasing Gorbachev.
   Genscher told reporters that he assured Gorbachev, ``There is
not going to be a separate German course.''
   He said German rapprochement will occur only within general
European rapprochement, and ``we will do everything to create
stable, cooperative structures'' to ensure the security of Europe.
   Genscher refused to discuss Gorbachev's response.
   Tass also said that Genscher and Shevardnadze shared their
desires to reach agreements on the reduction of strategic offensive
weapons and conventional armed forces, and on a ban on chemical
weapons.

   A longtime heroin user has accepted a
judge's offer to spend two years in a Zen Buddhist monastery
instead of going through a drug treatment program.
   Loudoun County (Va.) Circuit Judge James Chamblin on Monday gave
Keith Brian Scofield of Sterling, Va., the option of going through
his sixth drug treatment program or entering the Zen Studies
Society Mountain Monastery in Ulster County, about 70 miles
northwest of New York City.
   ``Conventional drug treatment sure doesn't produce many
winners,'' Scofield said Tuesday in a telephone interview from
Loudoun County Jail in Virginia. ``I've been to some of the best in
the country and believe me they just don't work.''
   After his release from the previous drug programs, ``I lasted
about a week'' before he went back on drugs, he said.
   The monastery's acting abbot, Junpo Dennis Kelly, said Scofield
is the first criminal drug user the retreat has agreed to take in.
But Kelly said several of the 20 people living at the monastery
turned to Buddhism to overcome drug addiction.
   ``In the '60s and '70s I experimented with a lot of drugs,''
experiences that should help him understand Scofield's problem,
Kelly said. ``I know right where he's coming from.''
   Scofield, 30, was convicted in November 1988 of heroin
possession and released on probation. He was arrested on a petty
larceny charge last June, and Chamblin sentenced him to five years
in prison for violating probation.
   All but six months of that sentence was suspended because
Chamblin planned to order Scofield to undergo drug treatment, said
Paul Maslakowski, Scofield's attorney.
   On Monday, Chamblin agreed to Scofield's request to let him
spend two years at the monastery instead of going through drug
treatment.
   ``The judge said `Get thee to a nunnery,''' said court
spokeswoman Fay Payne.
   While visiting Scofield in jail, his brother joked that ``they
ought to send me to a monastery instead of a drug treatment
center,'' he said. ``We laughed about it, but later when I was back
upstairs reading, I thought that ... I'd give it a try.''
   Scofield said he has been reading books on Zen Buddhism for
about a year. He said he has had a drug problem off and on since he
was 13.
   If Scofield violates monastery rules or leaves the retreat
before his two years are up, he probably will be sent back to jail,
Maslakowski said.
   ``It puts a lot of pressure on Keith,'' Maslakowski said ``When
a judge gives a guy a break like this, he doesn't have much
sympathy if he shows up before him again.''
   Probation officers will be allowed into the monastery to check
on Scofield, he said.
   Scofield will be released into the custody of his mother,
Josephine Regis, who will take him to the monastery, probably by
this weekend, Maslakowski said.
   His routine at the 1,400-acre retreat will include rising at
4:30 a.m., hard work through most of the day, vegetarian meals

   President Bush made three concessions at the
Malta summit that were overshadowed in the euphoria and confusion
surrounding the first-ever joint U.S.-Soviet presidential news
conference.
   Those steps met longstanding Soviet requests and marked a
political milestone for a man who had reacted cautiously to the
reforms of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Administration officials said Tuesday, however, that the fine
print still needed to be written on Bush's offers involving the
lifting of trade sanctions against Moscow and a halt in U.S.
production of chemical weapons.
   Although the summit produced no clear arms control
breakthroughs, and was not expected to, Bush gave Gorbachev these
welcome bits of news:
   _He would take steps to ease tariffs on Soviet exports to
America.
   _He would seek observer status for the Kremlin in a major
international trade group.
   _He was altering his previous, and for the Soviets unpalatable,
proposal on chemical weapons, seeking to sign a treaty for the June
summit to destroy most U.S. and Soviet chemical weapons stockpiles.
   Several major U.S. and Soviet steps are necessary before Bush
grants the Soviet Union most-favored-nation status, easing tariffs
on Soviet imports to the United States.
   First, the United States and the Soviets must reach a commercial
treaty, said a U.S. official who expects the American side ``to be
in talks with the Soviets in the next six or eight weeks.'' Bush
proposed that he and Gorbachev sign such a treaty at the summit
they are planning in America in the last two weeks of June.
   Second, Bush must waive provisions of a 1974 law that barred
most-favored-nation status for the Soviet Union until the Kremlin
eased its emigration policies. Soviet authorities have relaxed the
rules, and the emigration of Jews and other minorities is headed
for record levels this year.
   At Malta, however, Bush told Gorbachev he would not waive the
1974 law until the Soviet parliament passes legislation giving the
new emigration rules greater permanence, and the parliament is not
due back in session until late January.
   Administration lawyers say Bush can waive the law without
consulting Congress, but it is not clear whether the Senate or the
full Congress must approve a U.S.-Soviet commercial treaty,
according to U.S. officials who spoke on condition they not be
further identified.
   Once the sanctions are waived and the treaty signed, Bush plans
to ask Congress to lift a $300 million ceiling that it imposed on
U.S. government loans to the Soviet Union.
   Obtaining observer status for the Soviets on the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade may be just as complex.
   Bush told Gorbachev he wanted Moscow to study GATT to encourage
greater Soviet ``engagement with the international market economy.''
   Common Market leaders already have advocated Soviet observer
status in the 97-nation GATT, a status already enjoyed by Hungary
and China.
   The concession that Bush made on chemical weapons was designed
to speed progress on bilateral as well multilateral treaties,
officials said.
   Last September at the United Nations, Bush offered to destroy 80
percent of U.S. chemical weapon stockpiles if the Soviets reduced
to the same level. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
responded that his country was willing to destroy all its chemical
weapons.
   Further controversy developed over Bush's statement that the
United States planned to retain 2 percent of its chemical weapons
until the 10th year of a proposed multilateral convention calling
upon all nations to destroy their stocks within a decade.
   Administration officials later confirmed that this provision
meant that the United States would continue to make a new
generation of chemical weapons even after the multilateral
convention was signed, a provision that drew criticism from Moscow
and other capitals.
   Moreover, Bush said, the United States would not destroy its
last chemical weapons until all nations able to produce chemical
weapons signed the multilateral treaty, which is still under
negotiation.
   At Malta, Bush told Gorbachev he was willing to end U.S.
production of the new generation of weapons as soon as the
multilateral convention takes effect.
   Although that gesture is expected to speed work on both the
bilateral and the multilateral treaties, a great deal of work
remains to be done on both, particularly finding the means to make
sure that it is observed, said administration arms control
officials.

<HEAD>Record Price _ $3 million _ for 1,000-Year-old Hebrew Bible</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 1,000-year-old Hebrew Bible sold for a world
record auction price of $3.19 million Tuesday in London, Sotheby's
said.
   Yecheskel Toporowitch, identified only a resident of New York
and Israel, bought the Hebrew Bible, which is believed to have been
written in the Jewish community in Babylon in the 9th or 10th
century.
   Sotheby's said it was the highest price ever paid for a Hebrew
manuscript and the second highest price for any manuscript.
   In 1983, a group of German financiers paid a record $11.7
million for the 12th century Gospels of Henry the Lion.
   The Hebrew Bible was sold by the British Rail Pension Fund,
which bought it for $286,000 in 1978 as an investment at a
Switzerland sale.
   It had come from the library of the late David Solomon Sassoon,
a member of a wealthy Jewish merchant family from Baghdad, who
assembled a world-renown private library of western and oriental
manuscripts.
   The Bible's ownership is known since the 11th century from marks
inside it and is one of five primary works to establish the text of
the Hebrew Bible. It consists of 396 vellum leaves, each inscribed
in dark brown ink, except for the Psalms, which are in two columns.
   The pension fund sold three other Hebrew manuscripts, richly
illuminated with paintings, which also fetched high prices.
   The Rashba Bible, made in Spain and dated 1383, went anonymously
for $1.29 million to become the second-highest price for any Hebrew
manuscript.
   A volume of prayers written in Pesaro, Italy, in 1480 went for
$794,400 to an anonymous buyer who also paid $415,000 for an
incomplete Bible, made in Spain in 1468.
   A Latin prayer book made about 1260 in Amiens, France, and known
as the Du Boisrouvray Psalter, was bought by Paris dealer Pierre
Beres for $1.17 million.

<HEAD>Protest Group Vows Legal Action Against Navy</HEAD>

   The protest group Greenpeace on Tuesday
accused the Navy of ``maliciousness'' in ramming its flagship as it
protested the test launch of a Trident II missile.
   The Navy, which acknowledged Monday that it had ``shouldered''
the protest ship away from the test site, said Tuesday that it had
not rammed the vessel.
   ``We have a message for the Navy,'' Greenpeace USA Executive
Director Peter Bahouth told a news conference. ``We are going to
take legal action. They are going to have to pay us damages.''
   He declined to give details or say how much the group might seek
in damages for the alleged incident Monday in the Atlantic Ocean 50
miles off the Florida coast just before the submarine Tennessee
fired the $26.5 million missile.
   The Navy denied that it rammed the 887-ton ship Greenpeace. The
service said that it respected the group's right to protest but
that it also had a right under international law to protect itself
on the high seas.
   At the news conference, Greenpeace leaders showed videotapes of
two vessels identified as the Navy tugs Grasp and Kittiwake
spraying the decks of the Greenpeace and pulling alongside. The
tapes showed gaping holes in the hull of the Greenpeace; group
leaders said the gashes resulted from rammings by the tugs.
   The videotapes also showed Greenpeace activists in an inflatable
speedboat approach what appeared to be an antenna from a submerged
submarine. The group's leaders said the object was the radio mast
of the Tennessee.
   The group said Navy commandos cut the fuel lines of two
inflatable speedboats and returned them to the mother ship. No
commandos appeared on the videotape.
   At the Pentagon, spokesman Pete Williams said the ``Navy didn't
ram the Greenpeace boat.''
   He said that the United States, under international law,
``reserves and will exercise its right to protect its vessels and
crews engaged in lawful high-seas activities and protect them from
interference or other action by others that would endanger U.S.
vessels and their crews.''
   On Monday, the Navy said that, after repeated warnings, the tugs
had ``shouldered'' the Greenpeace ``out of the safety arc'' of the
test firing. Vice Adm. Roger Bacon, commander of the Atlantic
Submarine Fleet, said in Cape Canaveral, Fla., that the tugs had
used fire hoses against the Greenpeace and that the fuel line of
one inflatable speedboat had been cut after the other speedboat
broke down.
   The Navy said Monday that the Greenpeace had sustained a hole 1
foot in diameter.
   The protest was part of a ``nuclear-free seas'' campaign the
organization launched in 1987, according to Bahouth. The ship
Greenpeace replaced the Rainbow Warrior as the group's flagship
after the latter vessel was mined by French security agents while
it was protesting French nuclear tests in the Pacific Ocean.
   ``We do expect to mix it up with the Navy,'' said Greenpeace
leader William M. Arkin. ``That's the point of protesting. That is
why we were there. But we had never expected this kind of force,
this kind of maliciousness.''
   He said the two Navy vessels not only tore holes in the hull of
the Greenpeace but rammed it while a helicopter chartered by the
group was attempting to land on its decks. He said the Navy's
action in pouring water down its stacks could have caused an
explosion.

<HEAD>Sakharov Suggests Strike to Press for Removal of Party Monopoly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andrei Sakharov and some other legislators have
suggested a brief general strike to demand that the Soviet Union
end its constitutional guarantee of Communist Party power, as
Eastern European allies have done.
   The human rights activist and the others have not publicized
their idea of calling a strike of one or two hours in the week
before the next session of the Congress of People's Deputies.
   Six legislators proposed it at a meeting of the Inter-Regional
Deputies Group, an organization of several hundred legislators who
favor faster and more radical reforms. They hope to put the
question of rescinding Article 6 of the constitution on the agenda
when the Congress convenes Dec. 12.
   Article 6 makes the party the ``leading and guiding force of
Soviet society,'' in effect guaranteeing it a power monopoly.
   Poland, Hungary, East Germany and Czechoslovakia have removed
similar provisions from their constitutions.
   Early last month, the Supreme Soviet, the working legislature
within the Congress, voted on a proposal to put the question on the
larger body's agenda. It lost by a narrow margin.
   Vice President Anatoly I. Lukyanov said Tuesday: ``The Congress
is the highest body in the country and can take a decision on
whatever it wants. They can do as they see fit.''
   The Congress is the centerpiece of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's political reforms. Its 2,250 deputies were chosen in
March in the first competitive elections in more than 70 years.
   Lukyanov told a news briefing the Congress agenda, as approved
by the Supreme Soviet, will include the economy, changes in
election laws and a report on what is being done against organized
crime.
   He said ``the economy is the major item'' and a report on
efforts to stabilize and improve it will be be delivered by Premier
Nikolai Ryzhkov, with four days set aside for debate.
   The first Congress session began May 25 and was televised live
every day for two weeks, but Lukyanov said the next will be shown
only in the evening, on tape. He said hundreds of thousands of
workers stayed home last time to watch, and 20 percent of
production was lost.

   The United States should increase legal
immigration to fill expected worker shortages and provide 150,000
slots a year for residents now able to the communist nations of
Eastern Europe, a report recommended Tuesday.
   The report by two scholars at the American Enterprise Institute,
a think tank, suggested that more immigrants be ``pre-selected for
specific skills and occupations that are absent or in short supply
in this country.''
   Currently, most immigrants are admitted because they have family
members in the United States, according to authors Ben Wattenberg,
a senior fellow, and Karl Zinsmeister, an adjunct fellow at the
institute. Only 5 percent of immigrant visas now go to those with
an occupational sikll.
   The report said ``many researchers believe that America is
entering an era of long-term labor shortage,'' and concluded that
immigrants would go to regions and occupations where the demand was
greatest.
   Noting that ``thousands of talented persons'' want to leave
Eastern Europe, the report said that it's ``an appropriate moment
to sharply increase our acceptance of East European immigrants.''
   ``We propose a program of `liberty visas _ 150,000 legal slots
per year for 10 years'' for those leaving Eastern Europe, the
report said.
   Such people, the report added, have been ``doubly impeded''
because the United States would not let them in without having
relatives here and the communist states previously would not let
them out.

<TEXT>
   South Carolina opened an early
Christmas present Tuesday in the form of a $32 million federal
grant to repair highways damaged by Hurricane Hugo.
   ``Today marks a significant step in rebuilding this area of
South Carolina,'' Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner told Gov.
Carroll Campbell and a host of federal, state and local officials.
   ``The federal government is totally committed to help the people
of South Carolina,'' he added.
   The grant includes $25.5 million to build a new bridge from the
mainland to the Isle of Palms, just outside Charleston. It also
will pay for repairs made to the nearby Ben Sawyer Bridge to
Sullivans Island, as well as to the Battery Creek Bridge connecting
Parris Island to the coast about 70 miles southwest of Charleston.
   ``You can't get a better Christmas than this,'' said Sen. Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C.
   South Carolina has estimated that Hugo killed 29 people and
caused at least $4 billion in damage in the state when it rampaged
ashore with 135 mph winds on Sept. 21.
   The emergency aid will pay for cleaning up highway debris,
repairing Charleston's computerized traffic signal system and
repairing washouts, fences, lighting and highway signs in the 24
counties that were declared disaster areas.
   The grant also includes reimbursement for running ferries to
Sullivans Island and the Isle of Palms after the storm. The Ben
Sawyer Bridge, the only existing link between the islands and the
mainland, was knocked out of service for two weeks when the
hurricane threw one end of the span in to the Intracoastal Waterway.
   Skinner said the quick action on the emergency grant shows
``bureaucracy can be beaten.''
   He also said Washington would pay the full cost of all repairs
that are started within six months of the hurricane. The state
already has begun repairs on most damaged roads.
   Hollings said total emergency funds from the federal government
eventually could exceed the $32 million presented Tuesday.
   ``We're on our way back. You can't keep our South Carolinians
back,'' Republican Sen. Strom Thurmond told Skinner.
   Rep. Arthur Ravenel, R-S.C., said the state now needs federal
help to replace the Cooper River Bridge linking Charleston with
suburban Mount Pleasant. He urged Skinner to ``play it again, Sam''
and bring back money for that project.

   Scattered showers fell from Montana to Northern California on
Tuesday. Temperatures hit record lows in five Eastern cities and
record highs in Kansas and Nebraska.
   The showers, which stretched along a cold front and also
extended to northern Nevada, prompted an advisory for up to 6

Montana.
   The cold front brought a record 2.3 inches of rain to Astoria,

   Strong winds blew over the northern High Plains on Tuesday.
Morning winds gusted to 60 mph along Interstate 80 west of
Cheyenne, Wyo. A high wind warning was in effect for the mountains

   Low temperatures were in the single digits or below zero across
much of the north Atlantic Coast, and freezing temperatures were
reported as far south as Florida.
   The morning low for the Lower 48 states was 22 degrees below

<TEXT>
   A French mercenary in control of
this Indian Ocean nation denied Tuesday that he assassinated
President Ahmed Abdallah Abderrahmane.
   Various diplomatic sources have suggested Bob Denard either
directed or personally carried out the assassination Nov. 26 by
firing a rocket-propelled grenade through the window of the
presidential palace in Moroni, the capital.
   In Cairo, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, chairman of the
Organization of African Unity, expressed ``deep concern'' Tuesday
over the situation here and said continued mercenaries' control
represents ``a flagrant challenge'' to international law and an
``aggression on legitimacy.''
   ``I call on the international community to take all necessary
measures'' to right the situation in the Comoro Islands, a member
of the OAU, Mubarak said in a press statement he issued as OAU
chairmnan.
   ``I am not the assassin of President Abdallah,'' Denard said at
a news conference at the headquarters of the 500-man presidential
guard he commands.
   He led a coup in 1975 that ousted Abdallah from power and an
operation that returned him to the presidency in 1978.
   Denard was convicted of playing a role in a failed coup in the
West-Central African nation of Benin in 1977, and a Paris court
reopened the case Tuesday in an apparent bid to pressure him to
leave the Comoro Islands.
   Benin gained independence from France in 1960 and the Comoro
Islands in 1975.
   Diplomats said there had been no major crackdown or arrests
following Abdallah's assassination and confirmed that Denard and
two dozen white mercenaries under his command were in control of
the islands.
   ``The mercenaries ... are in effective control of the sceurity
situation, and the South African government is leading efforts to
encourage Bob Denard to go into exile,'' said the U.S. charge
d'affairs, Karl Danga.
   South Africa has major investments in the island.
   In the first major protest of Denard since Abdallah was slain,
hundreds of people jeered the mercenary as he left a mosque after
saying prayers Tuesday. The crowd chanted, ``Denard is an
assassin!'' and ``Mercenaries go home!''
   Diplomatic sources have said Denard is negotiating how much
money he can take with him if he leaves and whether his mercenaries
will be allowed to leave as well.
   Denard denied that. ``Why should I leave?'' he said.
   He acknowledged that South Africa had asked him to depart, but
added: ``That isn't good enough a reason.''
   The Court of Appeal in Paris ordered the lower Correctional
Tribunal to re-examine Denard's conspiracy conviction for
recruiting and leading 80 men to topple President Ahmed Kerekou of
Benin on Jan. 16, 1977.
   Denard was sentenced to death in absentia by a Benin court in
1987.
   After Denard returned Abdallah to power in 1978, a presidential
guard led by French and Belgian mercenaries kept him in office with
the tacit approval of France and South Africa.
   South Africa reportedly provided $5 million a year to the
islands, including $2 million to finance the presidential guard.

   A Virginia physician who disappeared last
month while in Philadelphia on business has told his family in a
letter that they could write to him at a post office box in Oregon,
police said Tuesday.
   Sgt. Theresa Young said the family of Dr. Todd Arcomano told
police they had received a letter from him on Monday. She said
police were continuing their investigation into his disappearance
to make sure the letter is valid.
   Arcomano, 32, of Arlington, Va., disappeared Nov. 7 after coming
to Philadelphia to take an examination for surgical certification.
He was a general surgeon at Arlington Hospital in suburban
Washington and was locally noted for performing an appendectomy on
Washington Redskins quarterback Doug Williams.
   His brother, Keith Arcomano of Long Branch, N.J., said Tuesday
the letter was sent to their parents, Dr. Nicholas and Ella Cecelia
Arcomano.
   ``Unfortunately, the letter was very vague,'' the brother said.
   It contained no special messages to any family members and did
not indicate when, or if, Arcomano intended to return to Virginia
and his medical practice, he said.
   ``We are satisfied that Todd is safe and not in any harm,'' the
brother said. ``We have been assured that he will contact us again
when he is ready.''
   Lt. Michael Cooney said investigators would try to contact
Arcomano through the post office box in Southbeach, Ore., to verify
his safety.
   Relatives of the Long Branch native said they found Arcomano's
shaving kit, luggage, books and the keys to his 1989 BMW in his
room at the Four Seasons Hotel in Philadelphia. The car was still
parked in the hotel lot.
   An open bottle of cola also was in the room and his books were
open, suggesting he had been studying for his exams. They also
found a handwritten note giving directions to the Amtrak 30th
Street Station.
   Arcomano had reserved the hotel room for only one night. Hotel
employees became suspicious after three days and notified
Arcomano's office.
   Arcomano, a graduate of Georgetown University Medical School,
was due at the family's home in New Jersey the weekend following
his disappearance for a birthday party for his father.

   Americans and other hotel guests
trapped in the financial district for four days praised the conduct
of rebel troops occupying their hotels, but were desperate Tuesday
to get out of the battle zone.
   Negotiations to evacuate the guests, including about 215
Americans, bogged down just as a power failure plunged the Makati
shopping and commercial district into darkness.
   Lt. Col. Rafael Galvez, a rebel leader, and Tourism
Undersecretary Rafael Alunan, the government negotiator, agreed to
resume talks Wednesday.
   Dempsey Pagan, an American businessman based in the Philippines,
said people in nearby condominiums were running out of food. He
said some dashed across Ayala Avenue at great risk to buy supplies
at the only open supermarket, opposite the Intercontinental Hotel.
   The rebels might be able to hold out ``forever,'' he said,
because ``the government cannot really bomb this place. In order to
kill the rebels, you have to bomb the whole of Makati, and they
know the government cannot do that. They have the financial center
of the country by the neck.''
   Ronald Manthey, a lawyer from Dallas, said: ``We're just trying
... to figure out what we can do to get out of the financial
district and this hotel.
   ``The rebels will not directly stop us from leaving the hotel.
But the rebels have very strong armament positions around the hotel
and are in constant fighting with the government forces, which have
also surrounded the entire district.''
   In Washington, the Bush administration expressed concern for the
Americans and said ``some uncertainty'' remained about their status.
   ``You can be assured that the Pentagon has contingency plans for
everything,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told
reporters, but he would not say what military steps the United
States might take.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said: ``We greatly
appreciate the restraint demonstrated so far by the Philippine
government forces, in light of our expressions of concern about the
safety of Americans.
   ``We hope that such restraint will continue on both sides, and
that agreement can be reached on arrangements to safely evacuate
innocent civilians.''
   About 15 male guests were in the Intercontinental lobby when
journalists entered with government negotiators seven hours after
the guests were supposed to have been evacuated Tuesday morning.
   About 20 journalists were driven to the hotel in an armored
vehicle captured by the rebels in fighting Sunday.
   ``What nobody in this hotel can understand is why, when
everybody is clamoring for a cease-fire, the government seems to
ignore the pleas,'' said a 24-year-old Briton, who asked that his
name not be used.
   Evacuation was delayed by sporadic automatic weapons fire as
loyalist advanced against the estimated 400 rebellious army Scout
Rangers holed up in more than 22 buildings.
   About 50 pieces of luggage were lined up in the lobby, ready for
loading into two dozen buses waiting to evacuate 350 guests, most
of whom waited in their rooms.
   Dim lights powered by the hotel generator shone in the lobby and
in a bar and restaurant on the ground floor. Two security guards in
blue uniforms stood at the front desk.
   Some guests asked the journalists about conflicting reports of
events on television and radio, their only sources of information
because newspapers had not been available since Sunday, the day
after rebels moved into the district.
   Carroll Greathouse of Stamford, Conn., said the hotel management
had been ``superb'' and the rebels ``behaved admirably.''
   ``The Rangers have conducted themselves as gentlemen with a low
profile, although they're upstairs on the roof,'' he said.
   Allan Campbell, 61, of Lancaster, Pa., and Peter Butler, 64, of
Washington, D.C., sat in a fourth-floor corridor talking with other
guests. They said they were with a Dallas-based company named IPAC
that had recruited 1,300 Filipinos to work at the U.S. naval base
on Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.
   The rebels seemed ``genuinely interested'' in getting the
foreigners out of the hotel, they said.
   Campbell described the long delay in evacuation as ``very, very
frustrating,'' and Butler said: ``Nobody seems to know what's going
on and communication is very poor.''
   He said a rebel captain had a long talk with them, making the
rebel case against President Corazon Aquino.
   In an impromptu news conference, Lt. Col. Galvez expressed the
hope that Filipinos would understand the ``pure intentions'' of the
mutineers.
   ``We also do not want bloodshed and we hope this will all come
to an end soon. We are willing to stop all of this,'' he declared,
but said the rebels wwould not surrender.
   Peter Sheldon, 50, of Australia said the previous four days had
been ``pretty harrowing.''
   Guests were told to go to the corridors when they heard
shooting, he said, and ``we don't know who we are hostages for, for
the rebels or for the soldiers.''

   Government and rebel forces declared
a temporary cease-fire Wednesday and began evacuating foreigners
from the embattled financial district where they had been trapped
for four days by fighting in the bloody attempt to oust President
Corazon Aquino.
   It was not known if Americans were being released. On Tuesday, a
rebel officer said all the estimated 215 Americans might not be set
free because of U.S. support for Mrs. Aquino.

<HEAD>Citizens' Report Blasts City Leadership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scathing report released Tuesday by a
citizens group says 20 years of stale, uninspired city leadership
has made this historic coastal city a ``seemingly underdeveloped
country.''
   The eight-page report titled ``Is Savannah Growing Senile?'' and
prepared by Renaissance Savannah is highly critical of the city's
elected officials, media and business leaders.
   Julie Smith, a Chatham County commissioner and co-chairperson of
the group, said the report was compiled from comments and
observations by members of Renaissance Savannah during the past 12
months.
   The year-old group identifies itself as a grassroots
organization representing all sectors of the city and aimed at
revitalizing Savannah.
   ``What's said here is what I think we've all muttered over beer
and cocktails,'' said Larry Lee, president of the Downtown
Neighborhood Association and a member of Renaissance Savannah.
   The report compares Savannah to a person suffering from
senility, saying both take refuge in the past.
   Of Mayor John Rousakis, who is serving his fifth four-year term,
it says, ``Our city has a mayor who is a ship without a rudder.
   ``Bring him a proposal, he'll say yes or no, or maybe. Then if
he says yes, you owe him. Some cities have mayors who don't wait
for someone to propose a solution _ they bring the parties
together, reconcile the differences and get agreement on making
something happen.''
   Rousakis questioned the validity of the report.
   ``It's obviously a political effort,'' he said. ``The '91 race
(for mayor) is two years away and this is the opening shot.''
   Chatham County Commission Chairman Robert McCorkle accused Ms.
Smith, a Republican, of trying to get black Savannah residents to
support the GOP.
   The report also criticized City Manager Don Mendonsa, saying he
``doesn't realize what an oppressive bureaucracy he has built.''
   ``Honest, hard-working and well respected ... he is one who
manages by control and not by growing creative, independent,
enthusiastic managers,'' it said. ``The result of his 20-plus-year
career in Savannah is an organization that avoids risk and makes
life difficult for many.''
   Mendonsa responded that, to his knowledge, none of the
Renaissance members ``has talked to me about anything.''
   The report said, ``A 20-year period with the same mayor, city
attorney and city manager will be up for grabs during 1991,'' and
added, that then ``The black community may be in a position to
exercise the influence it has long been denied.''
   The report said Savannah has comparatively few residents who
have four years of college and the leadership needs to be more
representative of its blue collar roots.
   Of the Savannah Area Chamber of Commerce, it said, ``The leaders
of the Chamber of Commerce have rarely heard, much less
comprehended, differing opinions within the community.''
   The report challenged journalists and news executives to ``move
their product beyond mediocrity and give attention both to what is
positive about Savannah and to that which would challenge our
elected leaders to better serve our community.''
   Don Harwood, general manager of the Savannah Morning News and
Savannah Evening Press, rejected the report as the opinion of a few
people.
   ``The media are very responsive and responsible in my opinion,''
he said.

   President Bush on Tuesday signed legislation
creating 733,400 acres of protected wilderness in Nevada and
opening an additional 2.4 million acres to multiple use under the
management of the Agriculture Department.
   The measure creates 13 new wilderness areas within Nevada and
adds to one other existing area. That would put a total of 2
percent of the state's land under wildernss protection, preventing
development and such uses as timber harvesting, mineral exploration
or intrusion by campers in vehicles.
   However, the legislation protects existing grazing rights for
ranchers on the wilderness land, and low-level military flights
over four of the new wilderness areas, said White House spokesman
Steve Hart.

   ``I just want to report that we have successfully evacuated the

   Max Motchmann, a West German expatriate who helped in the
negotiations, said the rebels and government forces agreed to a
cease-fire until the evacuation is complete. He expected the
operation to be complete by midday.
   He said rebels were allowing only two buses at a time to enter
the battle zone. They were shuttling back and forth between the
hotel district and a staging area a short distance away.

   Erich Honecker and other disgraced former
leaders were put under house arrest Tuesday, the government
disarmed the Communist Party's private army and the chiefs of the
once-feared secret police resigned.
   East Germans, furious about past corruption, surrounded secret
police offices in several cities to stop further destruction of
documents that could be used to prosecute Honecker, who was party
chief for 18 years, and his former lieutenants.
   Under Honecker, the secret police were the main instrument for
keeping people under control. The official news agency ADN reported
Tuesday night that its 19 top officials resigned but the new chief,
Lt. Gen. Wolfgang Schwanitz, would remain in office.
   Schwanitz has criticized the organizaton's past role in crushing
dissent.
   Guenter Wendland, the chief prosecutor, also resigned following
allegations that he was unfit to lead corruption investigations.
Wendland was a holdover from the Honecker era.
   Communist Party leaders appealed for calm to avoid ``anarchy and
chaos'' in a nation that, in two months, has seen the dismissal of
two sets of leaders, mass pro-democracy protests, the historic
opening of its borders and promises of free elections and other
reforms.
   The Interior Ministry said the goverment was disarming the
``fighting groups,'' party-run militias based in factories.
   It said the weapons taken away included automatic rifles,
rocket-propelled grenades, anti-aircraft guns and armored personnel
carriers.
   Western estimates said the militias had 3,000 active members,
but could draw on reserves of 500,000.
   On Monday, militia officers had urged the rank-and-file to break
their oath of loyalty to the Communist Party.
   In Czechoslovakia, the army began Saturday to disarm the
Communist Party's paramilitary People's Militia, which was created
40 years ago to protect factories from counterrevolutionaries.
Opposition leaders had demanded the militia be disbanded.
   East Germany's top lawyer, Wolfgang Vogel, was arrested Tuesday
on suspicion of ``criminal extortion,'' the official ADN news
agency said.
   However, early Wednesday, ADN said Vogel had been released and
the ``allegation of criminal extortion had proven to be unfounded.''
   It said the allegation concerned Vogel's representation of
fugitive East German official Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski.
   Prosecutors determined that Vogel ``during his representation of
Schalck-Golodkowski had done his duty as a lawyer, of which
upholding the pledge of secrecy is a part.''
   ADN said prosecutors also had apologized to Vogel.
   Vogel handled spectacular East-West spy and prisoner swaps for
years and was a confidant of Honecker. Honecker and several other
members of the old leadership are the main targets of the
corruption investigations. He has been expelled from the party and
three members of his Politburo are in prison.
   Authorities placed Honecker and other former top officials under
house arrest Tuesday in their luxurious Wandlitz compound north of
East Berlin. The compound has become a symbol of past corruption
and abuse.
   ``The former general secretary (of the Communist Party) and
president Erich Honecker is among those who are not allowed to
leave their houses in the elegant compound,'' ADN reported.
Wandlitz has 23 houses, once filled with Politburo members and
their families.
   The house arrests were an act of ``national self-defense'' and
resulted from ``the will of the people,'' said Harri Haarland, the
deputy chief prosecutor.
   The house arrests are intended to keep the former Politburo
members from fleeing the country. Schalck-Golodkowski, the former
top official for trade with the West, fled after allegations that
he was involved in huge weapons deals.
   ``All former Politburo members who after Oct. 19 were no longer
members of the Politburo and who are still in Wandlitz'' were under
house arrest, ADN said. Honecker lost his job in a major power
reshuffle on Oct. 18. His successor, Egon Krenz, resigned on Sunday.
   ADN did not specify the number under house arrest.
   Honecker, 77, has been in ill health following gall-bladder
surgery last summer, and had been a virtual recluse in Wandlitz
even before his arrest.
   There were growing reports of bands of angry citizens surging
toward local headquarters of the secret police, to prevent the
destruction of documents that could be used in criminal trials.
   About 2,000 East Germans tried to force their way into the
secret police headquarters in Suhl, and a delegation of the angry
citizens eventually was let inside, ADN said. It quoted local
secret police chief, Gerhard Lange, as saying documents there had
already been destroyed.
   Angry citizens also forced their way into the secret police
headquarters in the city of Erfurt, ADN added, while several
hundred citizens kept watch outside secret police headquarters in
the northern city of Rostock.
   In other developments Tuesday:
   _ The government said it is studying a possible prisoner
amnesty, in addition to the release of those imprisoned in years
and months past for trying to escape from East Germany. The
announcement did not specify if political prisoners were involved.
   _ West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief of staff announced
that Kohl will meet with East German Premier Hans Modrow in Dresden
on Dec. 19.
   _ East Germany lifted visa requirements and mandatory currency
exchanges for West Germans, according to Kohl aide Rudolf Seiters,
meeting one of Bonn's major conditions for improving ties with its
troubled Communist neighbor.

   Manila radio stations said about nine busloads of foreigners had
been taken out of the area, located in the fashionable suburb
Makati. It was unclear how many foreigners were aboard the vehicles.
   About 2,000 foreigners were believed trapped in the hotels and
apartments in the area, which the rebels seized Saturday on the
second day of their coup attempt.
   But officials said the figure was an estimate and they had no
firm idea how many foreigners were actually there.
   Safe passage for the trapped foreigners was delayed Tuesday,
although hundreds of others living in the district were able to
flee to safer areas amid the most serious coup attempt so far
against Mrs. Aquino, who took office in February 1986.
   Scores of Americans arrived Tuesday at the U.S. Seafront housing
compound, where U.S. Marines were on guard. Others moved to hotels
near Manila Bay, about five miles west of the fighting.
   At least 77 people have been killed and more than 540 wounded
since rebel soldiers launched the coup attempt Friday.
   Rafael Alunan, undersecretary of tourism, negotiated for hours
Tuesday with the leader of rebels in Makati. The talks at the
Intercontinental Hotel ended at sunset, and Alunan said they would
continue Wednesday. The rebels offered Monday to let the foreigners
leave.
   Capt. Albert Yen, one of the insurgents, said ``the intention is
not to release Americans.''
   ``U.S. meddling has caused the failure of the first wave of our
assault, so we hold them liable,'' Yen said. ``It is the
responsibility of the U.S. government if we take their nationals
hostage.''
   On Friday, U.S. F-4 Phantom jets flew air cover for loyalist
forces, without firing on the rebels, and prevented insurgents from
continuing air strikes from Villamor Air Base. They had seized the
base in the first hours of the coup.
   Yen said the rebellion was codenamed ``Seven Days and Seven
Nights in December,'' and would involve a seven-stage operation. He
said the takeover of the financial district, which began Saturday,
was the second stage.
   In Washington, the Bush administration expressed concern for the
trapped Americans and said ``some uncertainty'' remained about
their status.
   ``You can be assured that the Pentagon has contingency plans for
everything,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. He would
not say what additional military steps the United States might take.
   In addition to the 400 Scout Rangers in Makati, a similar number
of mutineers still occupied the Mactan Air Base in Cebu, 350 miles
south of Manila.
   Brig. Gen. Jose Commendador, leader of the Mactan rebels, said
Tuesday there would be a ``nationwide uprising by the military'' if
the government moved against them.
   The coast guard arrested five mutineers on a vessel that arrived
Tuesday from Bacolod, 300 miles south of Manila.
   Soldiers established roadblocks north of Manila because of
reports that rebel reinforcements were coming. Maj. Gen. Alfredo
Lim, the Manila police chief, issued ``shoot to kill'' orders for
mutineers who tried to enter the city in civilian clothes.
   In a statement issued Tuesday in Hong Kong, Vice President
Salvador Laurel said the government's resignation would allow for
``a new mandate'' and avert civil war. Although Laurel is vice
president, he broke with Mrs. Aquino in 1987 and has formed an
opposition party.
   Gov. Roberto Pagdanganan of Bulacan province said Sen. Neptali
Gonzalez, chairman of the pro-Aquino Struggle of the Democratic
Filipino Party, suggested in a meeting Monday with the president
and local officials that she dismiss her Cabinet.
   Pagdanganan said most of those present endorsed the proposal,
but Mrs. Aquino offered no opinion.
   Continued fighting has strained the economy and weakened public
confidence.
   Banks in Quezon City said withdrawals the last two days
surpassed the figures for all of November. Jose Concepcion,
secretary of Trade and Industry, announced that Mrs. Aquino had
imposed price ceilings on rice, chicken, pork and cooking fuel.

   Wolfgang Vogel's spectacular swaps of
American U-2 pilot Gary Powers and major Soviet dissident Natan
Sharansky made him an East German superlawyer during the Cold War,
but his ties to ousted Communist leaders led _briefly _ to his
arrest Tuesday.
   The official East German news agency ADN announced that Vogel
was arrested on suspicion of ``criminal extortion,'' but early
Wednesday ADN said he had been released, that the ``allegation of
criminal extortion had proven to be unfounded'' and that
prosecutors had apologized to him.
   ADN said the allegation concerned Vogel's representation of the
fugitive Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, but prosecutors had
determined that Vogel ``during his representation of
Schalck-Golodkowski had done his duty as a lawyer, of which
upholding the pledge of secrecy is a part.''
   For three decades, the 64-year old lawyer handled spy swaps,
negotiated the release of political prisoners and helped make sure
the dark doings of East Germany's ousted leaders stayed in the
shadows.
   Once one of only a few dozen private lawyers in all of East
Germany, Vogel for a while was just one of dozens of top Communist
Party officials under fire following reports of massive corruption.
   Vogel's international reputation got its start in 1962 with his
role in arranging the swap of Powers, the American pilot shot down
over Siberia in 1961, for Soviet master spy Rudolf Abel.
   He oversaw the spectacular February 1986 swap _ on a snowy
Glienicke Bridge at the edge of Berlin _ of Soviet human rights
activist Natan Sharansky and three Westerners held on spy charges
in the East for five East Germans convicted of spying in the West.
   Despite his prominent role, Vogel preferred to stay in the
shadows. It was not until 1984 that he gave his first interview to
Western television.
   Inside East Germany, Vogel was a source of hope for thousands of
East Germans imprisoned for political activities who hoped to gain
passage to West by being ``bought'' by the Bonn government.
   For years, East Germany disposed of thousands of its most
troublesome citizes by allowing them to emigrate to West Germany _
for a price that was often negotiated by Vogel.
   As the senior East German official responsible for
``humanitarian affairs'' after the Berlin Wall went up in 1961,
Vogel handled thousands of cases of East German political prisoners
who were able to go West as a result of his intervention.
   Vogel also bailed out the families of top Communist officials to
whom he was so closely linked.
   In 1984, he persuaded the niece of then-Prime Minister Willi
Stoph to return home from the East German Embassy in Prague,
Czechoslovakia, where she was seeking passage to the West. He
persuaded her to apply to leave from East Berlin so as not to
embarrass the party leadership.
   Her passage to West Germany was secured within days of her
return.
   Vogel was born in the Silesian village of Wilhelmsthal, ceded to
Poland after World War II. The son of strict Roman Catholic
parents, he studied law in Jena and Leipzig. He joined the party
only in 1981.
   A veteran of the war, Vogel practiced in the Justice Ministry of
the fledgling Communist state before setting up private practice in
East Berlin in 1954, one of only a few East German lawyers allowed
to do so.
   According to West German newspaper reports, Vogel had at least
one Mercedes-Benz car, went skiing in Austria, and vacationed in
Spain.

<HEAD>White House Plays Down Differences in Bush, Quayle Summit Views</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS graf17: ``I look,'' with two grafs from as-delivered speech</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The White House, dealing with aftershocks from
the Malta summit, attempted to quell criticism from conservatives
Tuesday and play down any differences between President Bush and
Vice President Dan Quayle on the Soviet Union.
   On another summit topic, the administration said the meeting
enabled Bush to look ahead to possible budget savings two years
from now as a result of likely arms reductions.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that if an
agreement is signed next year to slash long-range nuclear missiles,
``I think that could have an impact, certainly'' on the budget that
would be submitted the following January.
   Bush, on his first day back in the Oval Office, got a standing
ovation from his Cabinet, summoned to the White House for a report
on his two days of talks with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Bush ignored questions from reporters about Quayle, who has
offered a more guarded and skeptical post-summit assessment of the
Soviets than Bush has.
   Quayle, in an interview with The Washington Post, called the
Soviet Union ``a totalitarian government'' and said ``I don't think
they've changed much in foreign policy.''
   Bush, on the other hand, said after the summit, ``We stand at
the threshold of a brand new era of U.S.-Soviet relations.`` He
also said Gorbachev's endorsement of reforms in Eastern Europe
``absolutely mandates new thinking'' by the West.
   Explaining the difference, Bush's national security adviser,
Brent Scowcroft, said, ``We have an administration that is very
closely aligned but I think it probably not possible for people to
speak literally with one voice.''
   ``And there may from time to time be difference of perspective
but there's no difference in the substance of the policies we're
pursuing.''
   For months, Quayle has voiced a harder line than Bush toward the
Soviet Union. It has been suggested the vice president was
deliberately playing to the conservatives as part of a White House
strategy to keep their support.
   But Quayle said Tuesday that ``there's no good guy, bad guy
strategy'' between himself and Bush.
   Quayle, in an interview with Knight-Ridder newspaper editors and
reporters, tempered his comments to the Post, saying he should have
called the Soviet Union an authoritarian, rather than a
totalitarian, state.
   Quayle credited the Soviets with remarkable changes in economic
reforms and their campaign of openness, known as glasnost. ``Where
there has been a lack of `new thinking' on the part of the Soviet
Union is in the area of foreign policy, and particularly in Central
America,'' the vice president said.
   Bush and Quayle talked several times over the summit weekend,
and then discussed the Post interview when they met Tuesday
morning, officials said.
   ``Quayle has stated repeatedly that his No. 1 goal is to be a
loyal, effective vice president to George Bush. If he felt he were
in any way off the reservation, he would get back on,'' said Quayle
spokesman David Beckwith.
   In his first public comment since returning from Malta, Bush
said in remarks prepared for a banquet of the National Republican
Congressional Committee that he made clear to Gorbachev ``America
does not seek to exploit events in Eastern Europe'' but at the same
time was ``up front with President Gorbachev on Central America and
the destabilizing flow of arms into that region from nations
receiving Soviet support. Both of us agreed we don't have to
sacrifice candor to build a better relationship.''
   ``As long as these democratic changes keep moving inside the
Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe, I think the United States ought
to be out there trying to help, not in some kind of superior
manner, but trying to say, `Look. Here's what works,''' Bush told a
crowd of 600 at the $1,000-a-plate GOP dinner, straying extensively
from his prepared text.
   He noted that Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze has
said the Soviets are not looking for a ``bailout'' from the United
States. ``That's good because we don't have any money anyway,''
quipped Bush.
   Some conservatives have expressed unhappiness over the summit,
saying that Bush gave the Soviets economic concessions without
receiving anything in return, such as a commitment to keep
Moscow-made weapons out of Central America.
   Fitzwater minimized those objections. ``I think it's quite
natural to expect that when the president lays out as broad and
comprehensive a set of initiatives as he did there (in Malta), that
there are going to be those who have some concern about them.''
   ``And we certainly will be ready and willing to talk to anybody
about them,'' he said, ``but we don't anticipate huge
difficulties.''
   At the summit, Bush endorsed giving Moscow observer status at
the world's leading economic regulatory body and proposed June as a
target date for completing a trade agreement granting the Soviet
Union most-favored-nation status, which would result in an easing
of trade barriers.
   Fitzwater said the issue of economic cooperation was not linked
to any Soviet concessions.
   Bush, meanwhile, made a telephone call to British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher to offer assurances he wasn't taking sides
against her on the pace of the economic integration of Europe.
   Several major British newspapers had interpreted Bush's remarks
at a briefing Monday for NATO leaders as a rebuff that had isolated
Mrs. Thatcher from Britain's 11 partners in the European Economic
Community.
   Bush had told the allies that the reforms in Eastern Europe
required a ``continued, perhaps even intensified, effort of the 12
to integrate'' and become a magnet for the reform process.
   Scowcroft said Bush called Mrs. Thatcher ``to clarify some of
the items that were in the British press.'' Saying there was no
change in U.S. policy, Scowcroft said the administration supports
economic integration but that ``the details of it and the pace of
it (are) up to the Europeans, not the United States.''
   Mrs. Thatcher faces a lone battle at a summit this weekend of
the 12-nation European Economic Community against French-led plans
for monetary integration and community-wide rules on labor unions
and employment.

<HEAD>Tax Rights Advocates: Court Ruling Could Open Files</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court ruling was hailed
Tuesday as the wedge that could pry open the Internal Revenue
Service's files on taxpayers the agency takes to court.
   However, a spokeswoman for the IRS in Washington said the files
are already available to taxpayers upon request.
   ``This is a major decision, a major civil rights decision. The
appeals court has granted the taxpayer the right to know what the
secret files contain and to use the information in his own
defense,'' said Paul DesFosses of the National Coalition of IRS
Whistleblowers.
   In a telephone interview from his Pocatello, Idaho, office,
DesFosses said the coalition is a watchdog group of current and
former IRS employees.
   ``There's no telling how many innocent taxpayers have been
convicted of crimes in the past that they were innocent of,'' he
said.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans last week
ordered the IRS to open its files in a Dallas case of a father and
son accused of helping to prepare false tax returns and conspiring
to defraud the federal government.
   Stephen M. Buford, 36, now of Chicago, was convicted on all
counts. His father, Bob A. Buford, 61, of Dallas, was convicted of
conspiracy. They filed an appeal in 1988.
   The 5th Circuit also ordered a new trial for the Bufords, saying
the judge in the case gave erroneous instructions to the jury.
   The two men referred questions to their attorney, Michael Minns
of Houston.
   ``It's a major breakthrough,'' Minns said. ``It means a lot of
things to the individual taxpayer. If you want these confidential
records, you're entitled to them. If you're accused of something,
you have a right to these records.''
   The IRS authorized what are known as individual master files on
each taxpayer in 1984 as part of a five-year plan, said DesFosses,
who testified on behalf of the Bufords. The IRS files are kept in a
computer in West Virginia, he said.
   ``Unless you're familiar with it, it's something right out of
George Orwell,'' he said.
   The computer ``has everything you can possibly imagine in it
under your Social Security number,'' Minns said.
   The 5th Circuit opinion said each IRS file ``includes,
primarily, a breakdown of all information relevant to the tax
status of the individual,'' such as tax and refund payments, filing
status and number of children.
   DesFosses said the files also contain information on any
taxpayer activity that involves a government agency, such as
selling property or obtaining a building permit.
   In the Dallas trial, prosecutors claimed that Stephen Buford had
not filed his personal tax returns from 1980 to 1984, Minns said.
   Buford said he had filed, and he asked the IRS to let him see
his individual master file to prove it.
   The IRS refused to provide the file, portions of which are in
code, and instead provided handwritten notes it said summarized the
file.
   The U.S. District judge hearing the case ordered the IRS to let
him see the file to determine if Buford could use it in his
defense. However, the judge never looked at the file, according to
the opinion.
   On Nov. 29, the 5th Circuit ordered the judge to look at
Buford's file.
   ``If this reveals that Stephen actually did not file his
personal tax returns in the years 1980 through 1984, no harm was
done. If, on the other hand, it turns out that Stephen did file, as
he says, then he must be granted the use of that evidence at the
new trial which we direct,'' the 5th Circuit said.
   Although IRS records are open, DesFosses said the agency doesn't
open files to people who are charged with tax crimes. He claimed
the IRS has wrongly prosecuted taxpayers based on ``fraudulently
prepared handwritten assessments, not the original documents.''
   The appeals court ruling is significant because it means ``the
IRS may no longer use handwritten or secondary records. They are
going to have to use original records,'' DesFosses said.
   Ellen Murphy, public relations director for the IRS, said the
agency keeps tax information for 200 million accounts on its master
files and does not gather information surreptitiously on taxpayers.
   ``It does have confidential information in it. Your tax matters
are not subject to disclosure. But you can call or write and ask
for it. It's free,'' she said.
   The files are coded to reduce the amount of computer space the
records use, she said. Taxpayers can see the files under the
Freedom of Information Act and the privacy act, she said.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crash investigators said Tuesday that a
Colombian jet carrying 107 people disintegrated in a fireball two
weeks ago, moments after a bomb blew a hole in the fuselage and
flooded the passenger cabin with fuel.
   The disclosure came hours after a judge investigating drug
traffickers was assassinated, the fourth judge killed in 15 weeks.
   The government did not say who planted the bomb under a
strategically located seat in the 15th row of the Avianca Airlines
Boeing 727, bound for Cali from Bogota.
   But suspicion immediately fell on drug lords who targeted
schools, hotels, restaurants and other public buildings in bombings
throughout Colombia after the government declared war on illegal
drug operations last August. The 201 bombings have killed 29 people
and wounded 238.
   Authorities assume the traffickers are trying to force the
government to stop extraditing Colombian drug suspects. President
Virgilio Barco's administration has sent nine suspects to the
United States since launching its anti-narcotics offensive.
   Minister of Government Carlos Lemos told a news conference
Tuesday the airliner bomb ``is perhaps a sign of what lays ahead''
for Colombia. Lemos is acting as president while Barco is on a
state visit to Japan.
   Flight 203 exploded minutes after taking off from Bogota's
international airport on a Nov. 27 domestic flight, killing all
aboard.
   Investigators said a bomb blast ruptured the fuel tank in the
right wing.
   ``The bomb was placed strategically under seat 15F, which is
very close to the fuel tank that burst and caused the fire the
destroyed the aircraft,'' the director of the Civil Aviation
Authority, Yezid Castano, told reporters.
   ``Around an emergency door there is evidence of an outward force
of such power that objects inside the plane were blown out at
20,000 feet per second.''
   Police sought a mystery man suspected of planting the bomb,
Castano said. He said one of two men who had reserved seats 15E and
15F returned to the Avianca counter after passing through security.
   The man had purchased two tickets, one for himself in the name
of Julio Santodomingo, the other in the name of Alberto Prieto.
``Prieto'' stayed aboard. ``Santodomingo'' left the Avianca counter
and vanished.
   The real Julio Santodomingo is owner of Avianca Airlines.
   Telephone numbers left by the man being sought were those of
other people. On Tuesday, Judge Bernardo Jaramillo Uribe was shot
dead on a stroll in Medellin, hub of this South American country's
drug trade.
   Last June, Jaramillo ordered destroyed 770 pounds of cocaine and
five modern processing laboratories seized by police in Segovia,
175 miles northwest of Bogota.
   Jaramillo was also looking into the massacre of 43 people in
Segovia on Nov. 11, 1988. The government blamed a paramilitary
assassination team financed by drug traffickers.
   Another of his cases was the murder of Col. Franklin Quintero,
police chief in Antioquia state. Quintero was shot on Aug. 18 in
Medellin. Again, the government blamed drug traffickers.
   That same day, a leading presidential candidate, Sen. Luis
Carlos Galan, was murdered, and the government declared a major
drive against drug barons.
   The Avianca flight was bombed five days after police raided a
hideout they said belonged to Pablo Escobar, reputed leader of the
Medellin drug cartel. Police said that they almost caught Escobar,
who fled into the jungle while his bodyguards battled 300 police
and soldiers.
   An unidentified man who said he represented drug traffickers
told a radio network the Medellin cartel bombed the flight in
retaliation for the raid.

<TEXT>
   The head of Justice Denied, an advocacy group for
the wrongfully convicted, is being held on federal drug and
conspiracy charges after an FBI agent recognized his photograph
from a fund-raiser, authorities said Tuesday.
   A professor who studies crime and supported Justice Denied
questioned the FBI's timing and motivation in arresting the group's
president, private investigator Jim Humphreys.
   Humphreys, 40, was being held in Dallas' Lew Sterrett Justice
Center on 10 counts each of possession of cocaine and intent to
distribute cocaine, and one count of conspiracy, a jailer at the
center said.
   He was arrested Monday after an FBI agent noticed a newspaper
story about a Saturday fund-raiser for the newly formed Justice
Denied.
   The group is supported by Randall Dale Adams, who was freed from
prison after his murder conviction was examined in the film ``The
Thin Blue Line,'' and Lenell Geter, an engineer whose robbery
conviction was overturned in 1984 with Humphreys' help.
   ``We happened to see the story but we knew he (Humphreys) was
probably in this area,'' FBI spokesman Woody Specht said.
   The charges, filed Nov. 15, stem from 10 incidents during which
Humphreys allegedly sold between one gram and eight ounces of
cocaine in Oklahoma City in 1985. The charges are part of a
57-count indictment returned by an Oklahoma City grand jury last
month, Specht said.
   Oklahoma City FBI spokesman Dan Vogel said the indictment was
sealed and details could not be released.
   Humphreys' bond was set at $25,000 by Magistrate William F.
Sanders, Specht said.
   Ronald Huff, a professor of public policy and management at Ohio
State University, said Humphreys' arrest may represent a backlash
against the efforts of Justice Denied. Huff, who recently completed
a five-year study on wrongful convictions, attended the fund-raiser.
   ``There is some concern about vindictiveness in Dallas,'' Huff
said in a telephone interview. ``Jim Humphreys has played a key
role in helping prove the innocence of some of these people which
has caused him to be persona non grata.''
   Huff said the timing of the arrest just two days after the
fund-raiser was ``very curious.''
   ``It seems illogical to me why a fellow would put himself on TV
and allow a lot of photographs if he's wanted. It seems suspicious
to me on the surface,'' he said.
   Specht was not immediately available to respond to Huff's
comments, and other FBI officials referred all questions to Specht.
   Humphreys' investigative work helped clear Geter, an engineer
who spent 16 months in a Texas prison for a robbery before another
suspect was identified. Geter is chairman of Justice Denied's
advisory board.
   There was no answer Tuesday at Geter's home in Columbia, S.C.
   Also attending the fund-raiser was Adams, who spent 12 years
behind bars for the 1976 shooting death of a Dallas patrolman.
``The Thin Blue Line'' questioned the testimony of prosecution
witnesses in the case. A state appeals court later overturned the
conviction and authorities chose not to seek a retrial.
   Calls to the Justice Denied office weren't answered Tuesday.
   Edith Neely Crosley, treasurer of Justice Denied, told the
Dallas Times Herald she had not heard about Humphreys' arrest, but
felt it would not hurt the organization.
   ``There are too many people involved with it and they are too
dedicated to it. We will continue on,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   A Connecticut woman in whose
back yard police found ammunition and explosives buried was charged
with terrorism late Tuesday by Salvadoran authorities.
   Jennifer Casolo, 28, spent more than four hours behind closed
doors making a sworn deposition to military Judge Guillermo Romero.
   ``I'm being taken to the women's prison. It's a place I've taken
many delegations, a place where I've interviewed many prisoners. I
guess now I'll be on the other side,'' she told reporters when she
emerged from the judge's chambers.
   The judge avoided contact with reporters waiting at the court,
but Ms. Casolo and her lawyer, Salvador Ibarra, both said she had
been charged under the terrorism law with possession of weapons of
war.
   She faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.
   Ms. Casolo, a native of Thomaston, Conn., and a former Seattle
resident, has spent nearly five years here as the representative of
Christian Educational Seminars, a San Antonio-based organization
that arranges fact-finding tours for visiting Americans, including
congressmen.
   Her house was raided Nov. 25 by police who found more than
20,000 rounds of assault rifle ammunition, explosives and detonator
caps buried in her back yard.
   She has denied complicity with the leftist Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front, which is waging a 10-year-old war
against a succession of U.S.-backed governments. She has said she
rented the house where the munitions were found only three months
ago, and that she has been traveling much of that time.
   ``I have faith in all the people who have written me letters, in
their prayers. I can't say I have faith in the system to find me
innocent. But I believe my innocence will shine through,'' she said
before being driven off to prison.
   She had spent the previous 10 days under arrest at National
Police headquarters.
   Ms. Casolo was arrested in the middle of a major offensive the
guerrillas launched Nov. 11. The capital and countryside have been
relatively quiet in recent days, but the insurgents say the push,
which has claimed the lives of well over 1,000 rebels, soldiers and
civilians, will continue.
   Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark traveled to El
Salvador to assist in Ms. Casolo's defense. He said before leaving
for the United States late Tuesday that he thought her prospects
for acquittal were good.
   ``The accusations against me are false,'' said Ms. Casolo.
``This is a first step and the rest will be decided by the long
judicial process here.''
   Clark said he would return to help with future phases of the
trial. He had said shortly after arrival late last week that
deportation was probably Ms. Casolo's best bet.
   But she told reporters Tuesday: ``Let us prove our innocence
publicly. We're not going to go behind the scenes.''
   Guerrillas meanwhile took over two small neighborhoods on the
western side of the city before dawn Tuesday, held them for several
hours and then left, the armed forces said. The military press
office said one soldier was killed and five were wounded in the
fighting.
   ``Soldiers came in after the guerrillas went back to the
volcano,'' a resident of Escalon North said.
   A dusk-to-dawn curfew that has been reduced to 11 p.m. to 5 a.m.
in the capital remains in effect in Zacatecoluca, 25 miles
southeast of San Salvador, because of persistent fighting, the
armed forces said.

<HEAD>Arms Control Elsewhere Won't Affect Japan's Military Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   TOKY0 (AP) _ U.S.-Soviet arms-control agreements will not stop
the upgrading of Japan's military capability, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Taizo Watanabe said Tuesday.
   Watanabe said in reply to a question by foreign journalists that
Japan strongly supports progress toward arms reduction.
   He said Japan has been criticized for insufficiencies in its own
defense and that the military buildup that has been under way for
years ``is for the purpose of securing our self-defense.''
   ``It is separate from arms reductions from that point of view.
So our own efforts for improving our self-defense are not expected
to change at the moment.''
   Newspaper reports here said last week that Japan's next defense
budget will show a routine 6 percent growth.
   Watanabe had been asked whether arms-control developments
signaled at the U.S.-Soviet summit in Malta would affect Japan's
defense program.
   His reply demonstrated Japan's removal from rapidly improving
big-power relations in Europe and the different strategic situation
in the Far East.
   The Japanese taxpayer seems unlikely to get any early benefit
from an end of the Cold War. Washington is talking about
substantial cuts in military budgets, and U.S. Secretary of Defense
Dick Cheney said recently evidence exists that the Soviets have
reduced military spending.
   Japan, however, is looking for steady growth. The Asahi Shimbun
and other newspapers reported last week that the Finance Ministry
had agreed on an increase of just under 6 percent in the defense
budget for the fiscal year starting next April.
   Japan's constitution, imposed by U.S. occupation authorities
after World War II, disavows war and the use of military force.
   Japan depends for its defense on both its own military forces
and U.S. forces obligated by treaty to help Japan, Watanabe noted.
   ``We are very much concerned about this question of the position
of the United States on naval forces,'' he added.
   When President Bush said he and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev disagreed at Malta about reductions in naval forces, he
had in mind the vast Pacific.
   Under Gorbachev, the Soviet Union has suggested that Japan talk
about Soviet-Japanese military issues. Japan has refused, always
citing its obligation to the United States under the defense
treaty. The United States also rejects talking about naval
reductions in the Pacific.
   Japan's defense budget will be about $27.8 billion, roughly 1
percent of gross national product, Asahi said. The U.S. defense
budget is more than 10 times as large. The United States devotes
about 6 percent of its gross national product to defense.
   Japan has cool relations with Moscow and demands that the
Soviets return a group of islands off northern Japan that Soviet
troops took in the last days of World War II. The dispute is the
main issue blocking agreement on a peace treaty between the two
countries.

<TEXT>
   Jurors in the trial of the policeman whose shooting
of a black motorcyclist sparked three days of rioting must now
decide if the officer fired coldly and deliberately, or in
self-defense, attorneys said in final arguments Tuesday.
   The manslaughter trial of officer William Lozano, 31, went to
the jury late in the day. Dade County Circuit Judge John Farina
told jurors to elect a foreman and to begin deliberations Wednesday
morning after almost seven weeks of jury selection and testimony
closely followed by an entire city.
   The shooting resulted in three days of fires, looting and
violence. And police bought new anti-riot eqipment and put all
officers on notice in case the verdict touches off renewed racial
violence.
   Twice before in this decade, riots broke out when white officers
were acquitted in the slayings of blacks.
   Tuesday's final arguments were broadcast live on Miami radio and
television.
   But defense attorney Roy Black reminded jurors they should
concentrate only on the facts of the case, not on potential unrest
caused by their verdict.
   ``This case has nothing to do with racial prejudice,'' said
Black. ``Your verdict has meaning only in its truth to the case and
its effects on a police officer.''
   Assistant State Attorney Don Horn told the jurors Lozano had
violated the law and police policy when he shot Clement Lloyd, 23,
in the head on the night of Jan. 16.
   Lloyd and his 24-year-old passenger, Allan Blanchard, both
black, died _ Blanchard from injuries suffered in the subsequent
crash.
   ``He intentionally placed himself out there,'' said Horn of
Lozano's position near the path of the oncoming motorcycle. ``He
had time to pull the gun, aim the gun, concentrate on the
motorcycle and fire as it passed on his left.''
   In a rebuttal of Black's argument, Chief Assistant State
Attorney John Hogan, the lead prosecutor, told jurors they need not
find that Lozano acted out of malice, only that he was guilty of
negligence.
   Horn dismissed Lozano's testimony that he fired in self-defense,
noting conflicts with prosecution witnesses and his initial
statements to investigators.
   ``He's lying, he's lying. That's why he changed his story,''
Horn said. ``The story is not worthy of belief.''
   Horn said all the prosecution witnesses had heard the motorcycle
approaching from at least a block away, while Lozano claimed he
never noticed it until it was almost upon him.
   ``He stepped out there, he decided he was going to shoot, and he
shot,'' Horn said. ``All he had to do was step behind the police
car.''
   But defense attorney Black called the case a political attempt
to dampen ethnic unrest.
   ``He's sort of like a pawn caught up in forces beyond his
control,'' Black said.
   He called prosecution arguments that Lozano had the time and the
duty to retreat from the advancing motorcycle a threat to good law
enforcement.
   Five of the last seven officers killed in the Miami area died
because they did not draw quickly enough, he said.
   Black read from Lozano's job evaluations, which called him calm
in the face of confrontation.
   ``This is the man they would have you believe is some sort of a
bloodthirsty, trigger-happy police officer, but it's simply not
true,'' he said.
   Lozano is charged with two counts of manslaughter and faces a
maximum of 30 years in jail on each count.
   Jurors heard from almost 60 witnesses after testimony began Nov.
15. Jury selection took more than three weeks.
   The motorcycle shooting occurred on Martin Luther King's
birthday as Miami began a week of celebration leading up to the
Super Bowl. Lozano and his partner were stopped on a street in a
black neighborhood.
   Another police car was chasing Lloyd's motorcycle, which raced
past the street where Lozano stood. The officer fired one shot,
killing Lloyd instantly and sending the motorcycle crashing into a
car.
   Within an hour after the shooting, an angry crowd gathered at
the scene and began pelting officers with rocks and bottles.
   By the time the violence ended three days later, one looter had
been shot to death, 11 people were wounded and 13 buildings had
been burned down in the Overtown and Liberty City neighborhoods.

   The world's first recipient of a transplanted
heart, kidney and liver was upgraded from critical to serious
condition Tuesday and talked with her husband after her respirator
was removed, a hospital spokesman said.
   Cindy Martin, 26, of the eastern Pennsylvania town of Archbald,
was ``doing very well'' two days after the 21{ hour operation that
began Saturday night, said Frank Raczkiewicz, spokesman at
Presbyterian-University Hospital.
   ``Her organs look excellent,'' said Dr. John Armitage, who
performed the transplant.
   Raczkiewicz said Mrs. Martin spoke with her husband, John, after
she was removed from a respirator. Nurses said she was in good
spirits.
   The operation marked the first time doctors simultaneously
transplanted a liver, heart and kidney in a patient.
   Mrs. Martin is receiving a new Japanese anti-rejection drug,
FK-506, which is believed to be more effective than the traditional
anti-rejection drug, cyclosporine.
   Mrs. Martin suffers from familial cardiomyopathy, an inherited
heart disease. She received a heart transplant three years ago, but
her body rejected the heart, she developed hepatitis and her
kidneys failed.
   In Chicago, meanwhile, the nation's first living liver donor
said she felt ``real good'' a week after the operation.
   Teresa Smith, 29, sat in a wheelchair at her first public
appearance since she and her daughter, Alyssa, underwent the dual
operations Nov. 27.
   Mrs. Smith said she had seen her 21-month-old daughter several
times since the weekend. ``She usually wants me to hold her, which
I can't at this point,'' she said.
   Although the operations drew lots of attention, ``I don't feel
like a `first,''' she said. ``I feel like any parent who is looking
out for the best interests of her child.''
   Mrs. Smith will be discharged before the weekend, said Dr. Peter
Whitington, director of pediatric services at University of Chicago
Hospitals. And there is a 50 percent chance Alyssa will be released
in time to spend Christmas at home, he said.
   She remained in serious but stable condition. Her liver suffered
minor damage in a second operation to stop bleeding, but there are

   U.S. Embassy officials in Manila met a ``great
number'' of Americans on buses carrying trapped civilians to safety
from besieged downtown hotels, a State Department spokeswoman said
Tuesday night.
   ``We've heard that all the hotels have been evacuated,'' said
the spokeswoman, Mary Yates.
   She said the department was not sure what would happen next, but
``It just continues to be good news'' from Manila.
   Consular officers met the 30 buses being used in pairs on the
hotel shuttle at a reception center established at a shopping
center near the airport. ``They've seen a great number of
Americans,'' Yates said.
   But she said, ``We're not going to be able to get into numbers
for some time'' of how many Americans were evacuated.
   An estimated 215 Americans were among some 2,000 foreigners
trapped for four days in hotels by the military rebellion that had
killed at least 77 people.
   Before the government of Cory Aquino and the rebels established
a cease-fire to permit evacuation of the hotels, the Bush
administration had urged restraint on both sides.
   President Bush, who ordered U.S. jets to fly over rebel bases to
prevent their use on the first day of the coup attempt, was said to
be keeping options open. National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft
said that Aquino thus far had not requested additional U.S.
military support.
   There had been reports from Manila that insurgents seeking to
oust Aquino, unhappy over U.S. support for her government, might
not release trapped Americans.
   But a statement issued Wednesday said the insurgents' executive
committee decided late Tuesday to free all the Americans because
``these American tourists are not our enemy.''
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said there was ``no
indication'' that any of the Americans ``have been the targets of
attack.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater and other U.S. officials
sought to minimize the remaining threat left to Aquino, suggesting
she now clearly has the upper hand in the struggle. ``It's been a
gradual reassertion of control by the government,'' Fitzwater said.
   In Honolulu, Air Force Lt. Col. Tom Boyd, spokesman for the U.S.
Pacific Command, said there were no U.S. troop movements or plans
to deploy special units from Hawaii to deal with the situation in
Manila.
   Even at U.S. bases in the Philippines, military officials are
merely ``monitoring the situation,'' not setting up for more U.S.
involvement, he said. U.S. troops and their dependents in the
Philippines are under minimum travel restrictions, which means they
may travel to and from the bases and their homes off-base, but not
much else, Boyd said.

   National drug director William J. Bennett and
budget director Richard Darman are ``apart by more than a couple of
hundred million dollars'' on spending to fight drugs in 1991 and
President Bush may settle the dispute, an administration official
says.
   ``It's a big enough gap that it's likely to have to go to the
president,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The recently approved anti-drug budget for the 1990 fiscal year
totaled $8.8 billion, which Congress had boosted by $900 million
over Bush's request of $7.9 billion.
   ``I'd expect to see a real increase'' in 1991, not just an
adjustment for inflation, the official said in an interview Monday.

   A woman who was subjected as a child to Josef
Mengele's notorious experiments on twins said the Nazi medical data
gathered from her suffering should never be used in scientific
research.
   Eva Mozes Kor told her story Monday at a Boston University
conference on Nazi doctors and parallels in modern medicine. Some
in the audience of about 300 people wept and when she finished many
stood and cheered her.
   ``No one should benefit from brutal crimes,'' said Kor, a
Hungarian Jew and president of CANDLES, which stands for Children
of Auschwitz Nazi Deadly Lab Experiments.
   Some biomedical ethicists contend that the issue is moot,
because Nazi research already has been cited in American and
British journals. They argue that the data, despite its source,
have the potential to save human life.

   The Navy learned a lesson when
Greenpeace anti-nuclear protesters halted the submarine launch of a
Trident 2 missile in July, and it was ready for them this time.
   In a high seas drama 50 miles off the Florida coast on Monday,
Navy ships rammed and fire-hosed the 190-foot MV Greenpeace vessel
while helicopters buzzed two small high-speed rafts. Sailors in
motorized rafts cut the fuel lines of one Greenpeace raft before
towing both out of the launch safety zone.
   With their vessels helpless, about 25 Greenpeace activists could
only watch as the nuclear submarine Tennessee unleashed the Trident
2, the Navy's newest, most powerful weapon, on a successful test
launch.
   The 44-foot missile shot out of a tube in the sub's deck, broke
the sea's surface, ignited and hurled a dummy warhead package to an
ocean target several thousand miles away.

   The Bush administration is scrambling to
replace M. Danny Wall, who is resigning as the nation's top savings
and loan regulator after 2{ years of bitter struggle with Congress.
   Wall, characterizing his job as a ``thankless and perhaps
impossible task,'' resigned in a letter to President Bush on
Monday. He said he was leaving to spare his Office of Thrift
Supervision the disruption that would be caused by continuing his
fight for political survival.
   Until Thanksgiving, the House Banking Committee was holding
weekly hearings spotlighting Wall's failure to contain what could
become the nation's largest S&amp;L failure. The regulator was spending
much of his time responding to his critics.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady praised Wall for his
``public spirited'' decision to resign and said the department had
began the search for his successor.

investigate allegations that former Housing Secretary Samuel R.
Pierce violated the law.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh disclosed late Monday that he
had ordered the preliminary inquiry into allegations submitted last
month by 19 Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee.
   The department has 60 days to complete the preliminary inquiry.
Thornburgh's chief spokesman David Runkel said it began Saturday.
   Under the law, the inquiry by the Justice Department's public

<HEAD>CBS Examines West Point, ABC Plays a World Crisis Game</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On Thursday, CBS' ``48 Hours'' is taking at look
at West Point, while ABC's Ted Koppel has afoot an unusual
superpower game played by top Soviet and American officials, most
of them now out of office.
   It's an interesting double bill for what will be the 48th
anniversary of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. But the better show
is easily ABC's ``The Koppel Report: The Blue Conspiracy'' that
pre-empts ``PrimeTime Live.''
   The sort of TV exercise made possible by a grant from glasnost,
ABC's hour has its Soviet and American participants playing a
``crisis management game'' whose situations, but not the players'
reactions or decisions, are scripted.
   (Such exercises have in recent years become popular in the
government, the military, and in certain hatcheries that prepare
future diplomats for what the students are assured will be the real
world.)
   With the show's make-believe tensions starting on Dec. 7, 1991,
the initial crisis is a tad far-fetched. The president and vice
president are incapacited by a type of poison gas, called ``Blue
X.'' The gas was set off by parties unknown who used an explosive
made in Soviet-bloc countries.
   All this occurs just as guerrillas fighting the Soviet-backed
Afghan government have knocked out a key air base. They're using
chemical weapons supplied either by Iran or the United States, and
Afghan leaders are urgently requesting Soviet military help.
   Soviet officials, grappling with this, learn of the disabling of
the U.S. president. It leaves both them and the Americans facing
the questions of who is in charge in Washington and who attacked
this nation's leader.
   If you can accept the wobbly premise of the presidential
gassing, the show becomes a fascinating look at Soviet and American
crisis teams as they handle emergencies that, while separate,
affect each nation and could have what diplomats call the gravest
consequences, such as war.
   Members of each side in ABC's version of what official
Washington knows as a ``crisis avoidance exercise'' have faced the
real thing before.
   The American team includes Adm. William Crowe, retired chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as head of the U.S. team; Rep. Les
Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, as
White House chief of staff, and Rozanne Ridgeway, a former
assistant secretary of state on hand here as a make-believe deputy
secretary of state.
   With Koppel at one point reminding those who may be just tuning
in that ``the crisis is an imaginary one,'' the tensions quickly
rise, with ``wild cards,'' or unexpected developments, periodically
thrown in.
   These include a higher state of alert for the Navy's 6th Fleet
ordered by its commander, and an Air Force KC-135 tanker reported
missing after it refueled an American spy plane near the Soviet
Union's eastern coastline.
   As the exercise progresses, Koppel notes that each side, despite
its best intentions, is ``misreading one another's moves and
intentions...'' As one can imagine, that can easily lead to uh-oh
time for the whole world.
   It would be wrong, of course, to disclose in advance how things
come out. But it can be said that the revelation of who probably is
responsible for the president's gassing isn't too believeable.
   And, despite some mock newscasts and references to press reports
about the crisis, what happens with the press, particularly
American network television, in such high-stakes, confusing times
isn't fully developed here.
   Still, Koppel's one-hour game show definitely is worth a look.
   He has done this sort of thing before. And earlier this season,
``PrimeTime Live'' also gave it a try that failed. But each only
did it with Americans. That he now has the Soviets in the game is
remarkable of itself.
   Sad to say, CBS' earlier ``48 Hours'' report on how the Army's
future officers are being trained at West Point is a one-hour
exercise in cursory.
   The usual suspects are trotted out _ women as soldiers,
minorities, plebe harassment, and whether, in the context of the
current peacetime, today's cadets are tomorrow's bureacratic
managers, not warriors capable of leading men in combat should the
balloon go up.
   Despite a squad of five correspondents and anchor Dan Rather,
not much comes in the way of insights.
   It might have been wiser to use West Point as the starting point
for a show that examines a thought by the school's athletic
director, Col. Jim Anderson, whose decorations include the Combat
Infantryman's Badge.
   ``It won't take too many years,'' he says, ``before we won't
have any (active-duty) Vietnam veterans left, and we may in fact
have an Army that has nobody in it that has ever been in combat.''

<HEAD>Needed: Two Products For The '90s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The need for new products generally is filled
quickly in the United States, simply because competition is so keen
that companies cannot afford not to exploit an opportunity.
   The oat cereal experience illustrates the point, with dozens of
products appearing magically after consumers indicated that if oats
were nutritionally good for horses they were good for humans too.
   But in two of the most important areas of society the system
seems to have failed. It hasn't been able to market a truly
low-cost house, and it hasn't been able to present a widely
affordable health-care package.
   Both houses and health care continue to rise in price, with each
at one time or another spurting far beyond the level of general
price inflation. Each has unique impediments. Neither seems able to
benefit from volume production.
   In housing, it is possible to build a house at an affordable
price. Putting it on a piece of property is another matter, plagued
by high land costs and a bureaucracy of zoning, environmental,
health and building officials.
   Builders, the trades and engineers probably have done as much as
they can.
   Forty years ago the typical price of a new single-family home
was $9,500, with labor and materials accounting for nearly 70
percent of price.
   By 1969 the sale price was $26,000, and labor and materials were
down to 55 percent of that. In 1989, the typical price had soared
to $112,500, but labor and materials were down to 47 percent.
   Meanwhile, the percentage of price accounted for by the finished
lot had risen steadily, to 21 percent in 1969 from 11 percent in
1949. Intensive use of lots, as in cluster housing, then restrained
the percentage, but it reached 27 percent last year.
   Still another factor has added to the problem. High interest
rates have eliminated from the market many would-be buyers. Rates
are falling again, but with debts overhanding the economy there is
no assurance they won't rise again.
   Controlling health care costs runs into even more formidable
barriers, the most unmanageable of them involving the question: How
do you restrain spending when human lives are at stake, or more
simply, what price human life?
   The other problems are barely less awesome.
   Research saves lives, but it cannot be put on an assembly line.
The design and development of medical technology makes more
diagnostic machinery available each year, but at a huge cost.
Staffs no longer are willing to work for minimal wages. The
population is aging. New diseases, such as AIDS, make an
appearance. And insurance and litigation costs have become a new
and heavy cross to bare.
   If current cost trends continue, says the Conference Board
business research group, medical costs could rise to $1.5 trillion
by the year 2000, compared with $600 billion in 1989.
   Wendy Gray, employee benefits specialist for the Conference
Board, states that projections for the year 2005 ``suggests that
the Federal budget for Medicare will be greater than for Social
Security or defense.''
   The consequences are almost beyond comprehension.
   So threatening are these consequences that government has been
unable to deal with them. Business is so appalled that it is
attempting to cut benefits paid to employees, while employees are
trying seeking more from business.
   Perhaps you have wondered how the so-called peace dividend,
expected to follow a cooling of the arms race, might be spent.
   Wonder no more. If projections are correct, rising medical costs
would devour it in a few months.

<HEAD>A Decade of Scientific Accomplishment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   More than any other field of discovery, biology was the science
headliner of the 1980s _ the biology of the gene and the biology of
the planet.
   Researchers made brilliant strides in snipping and splicing
genes, in finding clues to the causes of disease. And they detected
an alarming fragility in the global environment, making discoveries
and embarking on research whose impact will be felt for years to
come.
   Here is a look at 10 top scientific advances of the past decade:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Superconductivity</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   In 1986, J. Georg Bednorz and K. Alex Mueller of IBM discovered
the first of a new class of materials that carried electricity
without resistance at temperatures higher than those of liquid
helium. In the new materials, superconductivity occurs at the
temperature of liquid nitrogen, making them more practical. The
discovery of the new class of materials earned Bednorz and Mueller
a Nobel Prize in 1987.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Fight Against AIDS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   A deadly and mysterious epidemic emerged in 1981. An intensive
search for its cause paid off two years later, when a team led by
Luc Montagnier of France's Pasteur Institute discovered a new virus
in patients suffering from the disease, acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, shortened to AIDS. Another team, headed by Robert C.
Gallo of the U.S. National Cancer Institute, learned to grow the
virus in the lab and proved that it caused AIDS. In 1985, cancer
institute doctors conducted the first human tests of the drug AZT.
It remains the mainstay of AIDS treatment.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Voyager Planetary Tour</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Humanity's most productive space exploration mission spanned the
1980s, as Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 toured the outer planets. The two
spacecraft, launched in 1977, explored Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn
in 1980 and 1981. Voyager 2 then visited Uranus in 1986 and Neptune
in 1989. The robot probes forced wholesale revision of astronomy
textbooks, snapping 81,000 photographs as they discovered more than
20 moons, numerous planet-orbiting rings of debris, sulfur
volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io and ice volcanoes on Neptune's moon
Triton.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Genetic Causes of Disease</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   In 1981, researchers discovered the first of a series of cancer
genes responsible for the development of tumors. Others were
discovered later, as were several anti-cancer genes that appear to
protect the body against cancer unless they are somehow altered.
Researchers have also identified the genetic causes of cystic
fibrosis and muscular dystrophy, an essential step toward
developing a cure for these previously mysterious ailments.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Cyclosporine</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   In 1980, transplant surgeons at several hospitals began
reporting promising results with a drug that stops the body's
natural tendency to reject new organs. The medicine, called
cyclosporine, was discovered by the drug firm Sandoz while it was
screening soil from Norway for possible antibiotics. Cyclosporine
was approved for routine use in the United States in 1983 and has
enabled doctors to routinely transplant hearts, livers and other
organs.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Ozone Hole Discovery</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   In 1985, researchers reported the discovery of what has come to
be called the ``ozone hole'' over Antarctica. The atmosphere's
ozone layer partly shields the Earth from the cancer-causing
ultraviolet rays of the sun. Chemical pollutants are gradually
destroying it. The discovery of the severe thinning of the ozone
layer over Antarctica helped bring attention to the worldwide
climate crisis, which includes not only ozone loss, but also global
warming, another feared consequence of atmospheric pollution.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Immunotherapy for Cancer</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Telephone calls flooded Dr. Steven Rosenberg's office at the
National Cancer Institute in December 1985 after he reported that
laboratory-altered human white blood cells attacked and shrank
tumors. This new technique is called immunotherapy. It turns the
body's own immune system against cancer. In 1989, Rosenberg and his
colleagues used a modified form of the technique that included a
first step toward human gene therapy _ introducing foreign genes
into patients.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Supernova Discovery</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   On Feb. 23, 1987, light reached Earth from a catastrophe that
happened about 163,000 years earlier: the collapse and explosion of
a star about 1 million trillion miles from Earth. Supernova 1987A
was the brightest exploding star since the one observed by Johannes
Kepler in 1604, and gave astronomers greater understanding of one
of the most violent events in the universe.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Artificial Heart</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   On Dec. 2, 1982, Barney Clark became the first person to receive
a permanent artificial heart. He lived 112 days. Almost two years
passed before the next was implanted in William Schroeder, on Nov.
25, 1984. Schroeder lived 620 days. Clark and Schroeder spent those
days tethered to a refrigerator-sized compressor. Although the
program was ultimately abandoned, it did demonstrate for the first
time that replacement of the heart was possible, if not yet
practical.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Mass Extinctions</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   In 1980, Luis and Walter Alvarez and colleagues published a
still controversial study proposing that a mountain-sized rock
struck the Earth 65 million years ago, killing the dinosaurs. David
Raup and J. John Sepkowski Jr. concluded in 1984 that mass
extinctions occur every 26 million years. One explanation is that
an undiscovered ``death star'' called Nemesis passes the Earth
periodically, causing a catastrophic shower of comets to strike the
Earth's surface.

   Adding up the expense _ financial and otherwise
_ of berthing the garbage barge, undoing the ``new Coke'' fiasco,
paying for Hollywood's flops, and making ketchup a condiment again
instead of a vegetable, mistakes of the 1980s cost ... hoo boy.
   To err was as human in this decade as in any, maybe more so. Ask
anyone who bought stocks the day before Black Monday. Ask the
Pentagon procurement guy who signed for that $7,622 coffeemaker.
Ask Gary Hart.
   Here are 20 flubs, slips, bloopers and clarifications of the
'80s, some more expensive, noisy and public than others:
   1. Most of the world hadn't heard of Islip, Long Island, before
March 1987, when a bargeload of trash set out on a trip to a
landfill. But then the seagoing junkpile was rebuffed by six states
and three nations. The Mexican Navy went on alert, and so did the
American T-shirt industry.
   Night-by-night, Johnny Carson plotted the gar-barge's
wanderings. Humorist Dave Barry envisioned it in the Persian Gulf,
fighting off an Iranian attack with swarms of ``courageous flies.''
   ``Islip's garbage has become the laughingstock of the Eastern
Seaboard,'' lamented the town's supervisor, Frank R. Jones.
   2. Nobody was laughing at Coca-Cola Co. in the wake of the
decision in 1985 to reformulate the soft drink that had become the
most popular in the world.
   The fizz on ``new Coke'' had barely stopped tickling before the
company came out with Coca-Cola Classic _ old stuff, new cans.
   ``Biggest marketing travesty ever,'' pronounced Jesse Meyers,
publisher of Beverage Digest, earlier this year.
   3. Kraft Co. could claim runnerup status for its 1989 promotion
offering a snazzy $17,000 van in a cheese contest, which instead
brought a vanload of lawsuits when a printing error made thousands
of people ``winners.'' They matched half a picture of a van in an
ad with the other half in a Kraft package.
   The company, which ended up offering cash prizes and four vans
instead of one, figured the mistake cost $4 million.
   Lawyers found a silver lining. Said one at the time: ``We have
five secretaries just taking the calls.''
   4. Ever heard of ``Caboblanco?'' Somebody came up with the idea
of remaking ``Casablanca'' with Charles Bronson playing Humphrey
Bogart's role. The 1980 film lost an estimated $8 million.
   In the same year, ``Xanadu,'' with Olivia Newton-John
roller-skating the role of a reincarnated Greek muse, cost a
reported $20 million to make, grossed $11 million.
   And whose idea was 1982's ``It Came from Hollywood'' _ a
sendup-pastiche of bad films? After costing something like $5
million, ``It Came ... and Went,'' said Variety.
   5. When Congress makes a mistake, fortunately it only takes a
vote to correct it. Take the 51 percent pay raise members proposed
to give members in 1989. Constituents proposed giving members
something else. The House voted the measure down, 380-to-48, in
February 1989.
   Nine months later, members held another vote, hiked pay, and
caught planes out of town.
   6. Another legislative issue, regulating buttocks exposure in
nightclubs, hamstrung the Denver City Council. The problem was a
legal definition (one proposal began, ``The area ... located around
the lower backbone between straight lines drawn from the outermost
point of the pelvis ...''), not to mention the public's concern
that council members had better things to do.
   In the end, they decided to sit on it.
   7. In 1986, a topless doughnut shop closed after one day in
Tampa, Fla.
   8. Rise and fall of a condiment: In 1981, ketchup briefly
thought it was a vegetable. ``Somebody got overambitious in the
bureaucracy,'' explained then-President Reagan after withdrawing
the Agriculture Department's school lunch regulation, equating the
two.
   9. A discount chain's television commercial in Seattle in 1986
offered a stereo system for ``299 bananas.'' How many customers do
you think took it literally and got stereos for the equivalent of
$40 to $60? Yup, a bunch.
   10. The government of Brunei gave $10 million to help the
Contras fight in Nicaragua, according to congressional testimony.
But in the typo of the decade, somebody hit the wrong key and the
loot ended up in the Swiss account of a lucky stranger.
   11. Clarification of the decade: ``I'm a comedian, not a
politician,'' said Jackie Mason, whose one-liners while working for
New York mayoral candidate Rudolph Giuliani's 1989 campaign amused
few. Giuliani lost, and Mason's television show, ``Chicken Soup,''
was canceled.
   12. Elvis is NOT dead, it was learned in the late '80s. In one
of several sightings, a shopper saw him in Felpausch's grocery
store in Vicksburg, Mich. ``E.P. Call Home'' bumper stickers
appeared. Incidentally, Elvis made $15 million from licensing and
records in 1988.
   13. ``Herb the Nerd'' was spotted in some Burger King ads in
1986, before the fast-food chain yanked its spokes-rube and later
changed ad agencies.
   14. ``Follow me around,'' Gary Hart told reporters in 1987. They
did. ``Let the people decide,'' the candidate said later. They did,
too.
   15. Retraction of the decade: In 1983, West Germany's ``Stern''
magazine announced the discovery of 60 volumes of diaries
supposedly written by Adolf Hitler. The forger wound up in jail.
   16. Whose mistake? Millions tuned in to watch Geraldo Rivera
open a vault owned by Al Capone; it contained some empty bottles.
The 1986 show was the highest-rated syndicated special in TV
history.
   17. ``Not Necessarily World News Tonight?'' In a 1989 evening
news broadcast, two ABC employees were shown exchanging a
briefcase. So what? Well, they weren't identified and the handoff
video went with a story on an alleged briefcase exchange between a
U.S. diplomat and an alleged Soviet agent. Tsk, tsk, the critics
said of the untagged ``re-creation'' of the unproven incident. Mea
culpa, said ABC.
   18. Bad day of the decade for one Brooklynite: July 14, 1989.
Making his getaway from a bank he had held up, the man was mugged.
His ill-gotten $2,100 was stolen. There's more: He reported the
mugging at the 62nd Street station house. ``Only a psychiatrist
would know why,'' said a spokesman for police, who charged him with
robbery.
   19. Theft was the charge a year earlier, when 90 copies of The
Billings (Mont.) Gazette were snatched. Police identified the
culprit as a radio personality who told them he wanted to vote for
himself in a newspaper contest asking readers to name their
favorite broadcaster.
   20. In 1988, an inmate at Mississippi State Penitentiary used
the prison computer to start processing his early release. He ended
up staying a while longer.

<HEAD>From `Voodoo' to Reaganomics; Creditor to Debtor; Bust to Boom</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy during the 1980s was a study
in contrasts: the deepest recession since the Great Depression
followed by the longest peacetime economic expansion in history.
   It was a decade in which the spiraling inflation, economic
stagnation and successive oil shocks of the 1970s were replaced by
new headaches _ huge budget and trade deficits, and fears the
United States was becoming a second-rate economic power.
   It was the decade when Americans went on a spending spree,
financed by foreign capital.
   The profligacy meant that the United States, the world's richest
creditor nation at the start of the 1980s, ended up as the largest
debtor nation, facing the threat of declining living standards as
U.S. wealth moves into foreigners' hands to pay the interest.
   Reaganomics, defined in vastly different ways by friend and foe,
dominated the decade. Ronald Reagan campaigned for the presidency
on a pledge of cutting tax rates, boosting defense spending and
balancing the budget, all at the same time.
   ``Voodoo economics,'' sniffed George Bush, Reagan's competitor
for the 1980 Republican nomination. Bush was proven correct, but in
winning the presidency in 1988, Bush took his own no-new-taxes
pledge.
   He promised to boost spending on education, environmental
cleanup and the war on drugs, all without a tax increase. He
promised a balanced budget, as well. It would be accomplished with
something called a flexible freeze, but Bush never got specific
about which programs he would put on ice.
   As a consequence, the federal government recorded a $152.1
billion deficit in 1989, Bush's first year in office, more than
double the deficit in 1980, Jimmy Carter's last year as president.
   The national debt, the accumulation of all the past deficits,
had not reached $1 trillion when Reagan took office. As the decade
ended, the national debt was closing in on $3 trillion; Reagan had
piled up more red ink than all of his predecessors put together.
   Despite that, Reagan held true to his promise to cut tax rates,
persuading Congress to slash the top personal rate from 70 percent
to 33 percent.
   Reagan also succeeded in slaying the inflation dragon. As the
decade began, the country was in its worst economic predicament
since the Great Depression, a long-simmering bout of inflation
fueled by successive oil shocks that had sent consumer prices into
double-digit territory, climbing by 12.5 percent in 1980 alone.
   Paul Volcker, serving as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board,
used high interest rates to dampen economic growth and whip
inflation, getting support for the task from Reagan. The medicine
worked, but not before interest rates hit levels not seen since the
Civil War, devastating the housing industry and shoving the country
into the steep 1981-82 recession.
   At its depth, 12 million Americans were out of work, the
unemployment rate hit 10.8 percent, its highest level since the
Depression, and news reports focused nightly on soup lines and
crowded public shelters.
   But the hard times have been followed by 84 months of
prosperity, a period of growth unmatched in peacetime and nearly
three times longer than the average expansion period.
   While growth was slowing as 1989 ended, economists held out hope
that falling interest rates would spur a rebound in economic
activity in 1990.
   Despite the long expansion, the percentage of Americans living
in poverty refused to budge below 13 percent, remaining higher
throughout the decade than it had been at any time during the
1970s. The gap between the wealthiest Americans and the poorest
also widened to its broadest range in 40 years.
   Critics blamed the high poverty rate on holes in the ``safety
net'' that David Stockman, Reagan's budget director, had erected to
protect the neediest from the pain of government budget cuts.
   It wasn't only people on welfare who were squeezed. The income
for a typical American family last year was $32,191, which meant
that even with more two-earner households and a long expansion,
family incomes had only made it back to where they had been in 1973.
   Democrats attributed the modest income gains to the fact that
high-paying industrial jobs were being replaced by minimum-wage
jobs in the service sector, transforming the country into a
``nation of hamburger flippers.''
   Nonsense, said Republicans, who pointed to the 20 million jobs
created since the recession ended in 1982, a level of job growth
that sent unemployment down close to 5 percent, the lowest it has
been since 1973.
   The modest wage gains didn't stop Americans from going on a
spending spree. The heavy consumer purchases and the huge
government budget deficits fueled the expansion.
   The trouble was that much of the demand was met by foreign
producers, as the country's trade deficit widened to historic
levels. The broadest measure of U.S. trade was in surplus as the
decade began, deficits in merchandise trade being more than covered
by Americans' earnings on their overseas investments.
   But a huge surge of imports, spurred by a strong dollar, pushed
the current account deficit to a record $154 billion in 1987, with
only modest improvement since that time.
   The billions of dollars flowing into foreign hands came back
into the United States as a wave of investments in everything from
high-rise office buildings to Hollywood movie studios. For the
first time since 1914, U.S. investments overseas were exceeded by
foreign investments in this country, presenting a host of problems
concerning how the interest owed to foreigners will be paid.
   But still, economists saw reasons for optimism in the 1990s. The
crumbling of the communist bloc was expected to produce a ``peace
dividend'' of lower defense spending that would help the federal
government balance its books.
   In addition, many analysts were looking for the low personal
savings rates of the 1980s to begin rising in the 1990s as the Baby
Boom generation moves into middle age.
   A larger pool of savings could spell big dividends for the
United States, lowering the cost of capital and allowing American
businesses to make the investments in research and modernization
that will be needed to keep up with the Japanese and other global
competitors.

   Americans took the '80s lite-ly. But after a grilled,
no-butter-please, oh-so-fresh redfish fillet with steamed baby
veggies, they ended dinner with rich, dark Belgian chocolate.
   We were obsessed with food, for comfort, health, status and
entertainment.
   Millions checked their cholesterol level, watched their fat
intake and exercised incessantly. Millions more kept McDonald's
billions ticking ever higher, found Wendy's beef, and got Domino's
pizzas in 30 minutes or else.
   Convenience was key for trendy yuppies and traditional families.
Takeout spread to three-star restaurants, and newfangled
super-supermarkets sprouted frozen gourmet entrees, zapped in the
more than 75 million microwave ovens sold in the 1980s.
   Americans kept dieting, some to the point of anorexia. Cracker
makers shunned tropical oils. Oat bran appeared in cookies and
popcorn.
   Fears for the safety of our food supply _ fed by salmonella,
listeriosis, preservatives and pesticides _ reached a frenzy over
two red grapes from Chile that contained cyanide.
   We drank more sparkling water and less hard liquor, and the
three-martini lunch lost ground to the power breakfast and even
high tea. ``Thank you for not smoking'' became ``Light up and
you're under arrest.'' We buckled up for safety and got tougher on
drunken drivers.
   Women who built careers in the '70s heard their biological
clocks ticking in the '80s and feared they would never be mothers,
leading to a boomlet mid-decade. These kids ate all-natural baby
food or specially designed TV dinners. Juice came in boxes.
   No pain, no gain, said aerobic Jane, who then turned to
low-impact. We jogged and then we walked.
   By the end of the '80s, we headed toward homey and hearty. But
it was a long, strange trip.
   From Mrs. Paul's fish sticks to Paul Prudhomme's blackened
redfish. From seeing and being seen at restaurants, to couch potato
takeout in front of the VCR, to home entertaining. From singles
bars to discos to health clubs to singles bars. From jelly beans to
pork rinds.
   Hot dogs were shunned, but a potentially poisonous blowfish from
Japan was $35 a portion at the sushi bar. We fell for David's rich
chocolate chip cookies, but then David went on a low-fat diet.
   Cornmeal mush _ called polenta and gussied up with truffles or
sun-dried tomatoes _ was hot. We ate flowers. We made pasta with
blue corn, black squid ink, chocolate, or red peppers.
   Real men ate no quiche, but learned to make a roux or
grilled-over-mesquite chicken, especially if it lived a free-range
life.
   In a decade of quality time and ``quality of life issues,'' we
ate quality, too _ at a price. Thirty-six dollars for a pound of
chocolates, $4 for a jar of mustard, $4.99 for a pound of
radicchio. A baked potato for $8.50 in a Manhattan restaurant.
   ``I always think of raspberry mustard. That was about the most
bizarre I heard of,'' said Julee Rosso, who with partner Sheila
Lukins rode the culinary wave with the Silver Palate.
   ``Foodies'' filled renovated kitchens with microwaves,
Cuisinarts, coffee makers, bagel slicers and $350 Japanese bread
bakers.
   Martha Stewart became an arbiter of taste, through her books on
lifestyle and line of kitchenware and decorating items at K mart.
   Chefs became celebrities: Frugal Gourmet Jeff Smith, California
cuisine goddess Alice Waters, Prudhomme and Justin Wilson. Wolfgang
Puck baked designer pizza _ with caviar and smoked salmon.
   But our attitude worried Julia Child: ``What's dangerous and
discouraging about this era is that people really are afraid of
their food. Sitting down to dinner is a trap, not something to
enjoy.''
   The trap was built from sound health warnings, which we tried to
heed. But ice cream with foreign-sounding names and flourless
chocolate cakes beckoned.
   We ate olive oil, everything Mediterranean and even took fish
oil capsules. Nouvelle was pushed aside by a new-found passion for
down-home American regional cooking and pasta, pasta and more pasta.
   Lite seemed to be the light at the end of the tunnel of calories.
   Less was more _ less cholesterol, less sodium, less fat. (Was
HDL or LDL the good cholesterol, anyway?) And for a while, in tony
restaurants, less food altogether. We could spend a small fortune
for art on a plate and go home hungry.
   Experts increasingly emphasized links between nutrition and
heart disease. The surgeon general urged Americans to cut down on
fats and eat more fruits and vegetables, fish, poultry and grains.
His report said 1.5 million people died in 1987 from diseases
related to diet.
   Still, we judged the book by its cover.
   Jane Fonda got more famous for sweating, Cher got more famous
for having _ or was it not having? _ cosmetic surgery. Millions
watched Oprah Winfrey show off her size 10 jeans and months later
acknowledge she'd gained back 17 pounds.
   We turned to starch blockers, fake fats and artificial
sweeteners, Retin-A and minoxidil, Nautilus, liquid fasts, and even
comedian-activist Dick Gregory's fat farms.
   And if every turn of the wheels on the exercise bike meant
getting rid of excess calories for some, for others it brought
excess _ in the form of a guilt-free Dove Bar _ that much closer.
   But excess did not have to be big in the 1980s.
   Cookbook author Ellen Brown found the worst excess of the decade
in baby squash blossoms stuffed with blue goat cheese: ``When there
are homeless people starving in the streets, we were worried about
how small we could grow everything.''

   Herbert Parmet once vowed to help keep Richard
Nixon from becoming president. Stephen Ambrose says that in 1974
all he wanted was to get Nixon out of office. Roger Morris was so
appalled by the invasion of Cambodia that he resigned from the
Nixon White House.
   Now all three have written books on the 37th president, and all
say the experience has increased their respect for Nixon _ even
though none of the three exonerates him for ethical failings.
   ``I think it was very important to see him as the very
sensitive, intelligent human being that he is,'' Parmet, a
historian whose previous books include a definitive work on
President Kennedy, said in a telephone interview.
   Ambrose, now at work on an account of the onslaught of criticism
that drove Nixon from office in the Watergate era, said, ``I can't
help but have a no-longer-secret admiration for his ability to
stand up to it, and fight back.''
   Morris is critical of Nixon's ethics, but says his book is an
even-handed portrait.
   Parmet, a professor of history at Queensborough Community
College in New York, worked six years on his one-volume biography,
``Richard Nixon and His America,'' scheduled for publication Jan.
15 by Little Brown.
   Ambrose, a historian who teaches at the University of New
Orleans, is writing the final volume of a three-volume biography.
The second volume, ``The Triumph of a Politician,'' was published
recently by Simon and Schuster.
   Morris, who has forged a reputation as an investigative
journalist since quitting the National Security Council staff in
1970, recently completed the first of a projected three volumes:
``Richard Milhous Nixon: The Rise of an American Politician,''
published by Henry Holt and Co.
   Thus, with four living ex-presidents on the scene for the first
time in more than a century, the one who is getting the lion's
share of the attention is the one who was driven from office. Nixon
resigned on Aug. 9, 1974, after revelations stemming from a botched
burglary at Democratic headquarters during his 1972 re-election
campaign.
   Nixon himself is putting finishing touches on the seventh book
he has written since his resignation. ``In the Arena: A Memoir of
Victory, Defeat and Renewal'' is scheduled for mid-April
publication by Simon and Schuster.
   Nixon's spokesman, John Taylor, said he does not believe the
former president has read any of the books about him. Nixon said in
a television interview last year that he never does.
   Nixon granted five interviews to Parmet, but declined to be
interviewed by Ambrose or Morris. Morris, who has written critical
books about Henry Kissinger and Alexander Haig, both top White
House aides in the Nixon years, said, ``I am sure he regarded me as
a critic and as an adversary.''
   Taylor said Parmet was recommended to Nixon by mutual friends
and the former president was ``aware of his high ranking in the
scholarly community.''
   Parmet, a Democrat whose works include ``JFK: The Presidency of
John F. Kennedy,'' said he thinks it was the interviews more than
anything that burnished his view of Nixon.
   ``I, for one, as many Americans, grew up with a view of Nixon
that was really based on a Herblock caricature,'' he said. The
heavy-jowled, stubbly and glowering figure portrayed by the
Washington Post editorial cartoonist ``was an unmitigated force of
evil,'' Parmet said.
   ``I promised my daughter once that he would never become
president; she still holds that against me,'' the historian said.
   ``I feel that I have gotten to understand Nixon based on the
research I have done and probably more emphatically on the
one-to-one personal encounters,'' he said. ``I began to see the
basis for ... how he felt himself in a constant underdog role.
   ``This has nothing to do, or very little to do, with policy. It
has a great deal to do with the understanding of the man.
Understanding does not necessarily lead to approval, but it does
help me to see things from his perspective, and I think that's very
important.''
   After he finished the book, Parmet said, he turned to his editor
at Little Brown, Ray Roberts, and asked, ``Do you think this is
sympathetic to Nixon or hostile?''
   Roberts said it was sympathetic, Parmet recalled.
   Ambrose, who wrote an admiring two-volume biography of Dwight
Eisenhower before taking on Nixon, said his revised estimate of the
first U.S. president to resign from office stemmed from ``the fact
he is not in active politics anymore and I am trying to look at him
as a historian rather than as a citizen.''
   ``I am giving the devil his due,'' he said.
   He interviewed former Nixon aides, including Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., and New York Times columnist William Safire, and
found they ``really like the guy and admire him.''
   ``I just had to rethink my own feelings about Nixon in the light
of what people whose opinion I respect felt about him,'' he said.
   ``And then I'm working right now on the year 1974, and I must
say that Nixon in adversity is more likable and more admirable than
Nixon in triumph. Now that doesn't mean that I have suddenly
decided that he was innocent. By no means. In fact, I think I
probably know as much as anybody except Nixon himself about how
guilty he was.
   ``Also I hadn't paid any attention in '74 to what Nixon was
doing other than Watergate. All I wanted was to get him out of
office.''
   After taking another look at Nixon's proposals on arms control,
welfare reform, federal aid to education and health care, he said,
``I just have to groan at what we lost'' when he resigned.
   Morris said his research ``gave me a great deal of added respect
for how good a politician he was. I think as a young man he was
quite superb, and would be good today.''
   But his studies did not soften Morris' view of Nixon's
California campaigns against Rep. Jerry Voorhis for the House in
1946 and Helen Gahagan Douglas for the Senate in 1950, often
criticized for red-baiting and character assassination.
   ``If anything the critics did not know the half,'' he said.
``Those campaigns were worse than even the critics thought.''
   ``He was a meticulous, painstaking, thorough, often brilliant,
very well organized, beautifully timed politician,'' said Morris.
``That doesn't say anything at all about his values. It doesn't
have anything to do with the compromise of his integrity, or dirty
money, or the honesty of his campaigning.''
   Yet Morris, a Democrat when he first met Nixon and went to work
for him, said: ``I think we ended up writing a very empathetic and
even-handed book about him and especially about his family. It is a
book I wouldn't hesitate to show to his mother or father if they
were still alive.''

<HEAD>Steel Importers Call for Change in Anti-Dumping Laws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Steel importers say fair-trade laws are being
abused to protect U.S. steel companies from foreign competition and
urged an international trading body to examine the issue.
   The importers pinned their criticism Monday on anti-dumping
laws, which are intended to prevent foreign companies from selling
in the United States at unfairly low prices.
   Foreign producers can run afoul of anti-dumping laws through no
fault of their own, simply because of a drop in the value of the
dollar, the American Institute for Imported Steel said at a New
York news conference.
   A consultant for the trade group said in an interview that
Commerce Department officials had admitted to him that they
selectively prosecuted foreign companies under anti-dumping laws as
a warning to others.
   ``They were actually proud of using the laws somewhat unevenly _
just to keep the foreign producers on their toes,'' said Hans
Mueller, an economics professor at Middle Tennessee State
University.
   A Commerce Department spokeswoman said she could not immediately
comment on the professor's statement.
   The trade group said U.S. anti-dumping laws should be reviewed
by the current Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, a multinational set of free-trade talks.
   The steel importers said they were pleased with the Bush
administration's commitment to free-trade principles and hoped it
would back the drive for changes in anti-dumping laws.
   The Bush administration lobbied against heavy restraints on
imported steel and succeeded in holding the renewal this fall to 2{
years, instead of five as U.S. steel makers had requested. Foreign
countries that eliminate subsidies will be given raises in their
quotas.
   In addition to importing steel, members of the trade group also
export some American-made steel. The institute said it supports the
Bush administration's commitment to worldwide elimination of
subsidies, reduction of tariffs and elimination of non-tariff
barriers.

<HEAD>American Companies Urged To Act Quickly To Exploit Perestroika</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American companies must move quickly to take
advantage of the opportunities offered by Soviet perestroika during
the coming years or fall further behind foreign competitors, says
the chairman of Pepsico Inc.
   ``If you want to go you better get there now, because if you
wait someone else will have the business,'' Don Kendall told
American executives attending a U.S.-Soviet business symposium
Monday.
   Kendall was one of several American and Soviet speakers at the
symposium produced by Business Week magazine, called ``The Opening
of the Soviet Market: Implications for Global Business.''
   Dennis Sokol, chairman of Medical Services Partners Inc. and
president of a Soviet-American medical consortium, said that of the
approximately 1,000 joint ventures created in the past year between
Soviet and foreign companies, fewer than 100 involve American
companies.
   Kendall, whose soft-drink company in 1972 produced the first
American consumer product sold in the Soviet Union, said that even
in the era of perestroika _ the political and economic
restructuring proposed by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev _
there are big obstacles for U.S. businesses.
   Among them are the difficulty of doing business in a
cash-starved nation where profits cannot easily be taken out of the
country. Full convertibility of the ruble, the main hindrance to
U.S. companies doing business in the Soviet Union, could take
longer than a decade, Kendall said.
   ``You need to start by acknowledging that Soviet change will
take time, lots of time,'' he said.
   Conference participants learned first-hand of the problems faced
in conducting business between the two nations _ members of a
Soviet delegation did not attend because visas were not issued on
time.
   Kendall praised the weekend summit in Malta between President
Bush and Gorbachev as a step toward helping perestroika succeed,
but urged the United States to loosen trade restrictions that now
hinder U.S.-Soviet commerce.
   He also called for most favored nation status for the Soviet
Union, which would lower tariffs on U.S. imports from the Soviets,
and for dropping conditions for granting the Soviets observer
status at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Sokol said the most serious problem facing U.S. companies in
entering the Soviet Union was the lack of hard currency.
   Nevertheless, joint venture opportunities abound in many areas
such as the medical supply field, where acute shortages exist, he
said. Soviet medical supply companies currently are able to meet
only 65 percent of demand, Sokol said.
   Soviet officials who did attend the symposium outlined a series
of problems facing their nation as it carries out perestroika,
including massive economic reforms.
   Vladamir Checklin, head of the Soviet Trade and Economic
Council, compared the current struggle between the old centralized
economic system and the emerging reforms with that of a patient
undergoing psychiatric treatment.
   ``As the therapy starts it brings out a lot of serious
diseases,'' he said. The first step to perestroika, Checklin said,
is that ``It's our problem. We have to do it ourselves.''
   Among the changes needed for the Soviets to compete in the
global economy, he said, is a reorientation of the manufacturing
sector.
   ``We haven't manufactured in the Soviet Union for Western
markets,'' he said. ``We need to change in order to compete.''
   Checklin also said a number of proposals would be taken up by
the new Soviet congress to further the reforms, including revising
tax policies and privatization of unprofitable businesses.
   ``The proof of the pudding is in the eating and many more U.S.
companies are liking this pudding,'' he said.

<HEAD>IBM Calls Analyst Meeting Amid Rumors of Job Cuts</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Meeting scheduled for 9:30 a.m. EST; Late PMs lead expected.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. called a
meeting for stock analysts amid speculation that the company was
going to announce job cuts and possibly one or more facility
closings.
   IBM declined to comment on the substance of the meeting
scheduled for today but a spokesman indicated it would be important.
   IBM has a 40-year tradition of no layoffs and a senior IBM
executive last week confirmed that the computer company would stick
to that. However, if the company closed an operation such as a
plant, office or distribution center, many employees might choose
to quit rather than accept a transfer to a distant location.
   Bob Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research Inc. in Phoenix,
predicted IBM might announce plans to eliminate about 20,000 jobs,
paying for the streamlining program with a charge of perhaps more
than $1 billion against fourth-quarter earnings.
   ``IBM has been competing with a layer of fat around the waist
for too long,'' Djurdjevic said. He said he thought trimming of
sales forces was more likely than facility closings.
   IBM normally reduces employment by offering financial incentives
to employees to quit or take early retirement. Earlier this year
the company began its third such program in three years, hoping to
trim 600 to 1,000 manufacturing jobs.
   IBM's stock rose $2.12{ a share to $99.25 Monday on the New York
Stock Exchange. The stock peaked at $175.87{ in August 1987.

<HEAD>LIN Board Recommends Accepting Revised McCaw Buyout Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After resisting earlier bids, LIN Broadcasting
Corp.'s board is recommending to its shareholders a revised $3.38
billion offer from McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. for
controlling interest in LIN.
   At the same time, LIN said Monday it had asked BellSouth Corp.
to terminate its agreement with LIN on combining the cellular phone
operations of the two companies.
   Spokeswoman Carlton Horton in Atlanta said BellSouth was
studying the request but did not expect to have any immediate
comment on it.
   Geoffrey Johnson, who follows the telecommunications industry
for Argus Research Corp., said BellSouth could come back with a
revision of its offer.
   ``This doesn't mean the BellSouth deal is dead,'' he said. ``I
would be fairly amazed if BellSouth walks away from this.''
   LIN, a New York-based cellular telephone, broadcasting and
publishing concern, had resisted McCaw's overtures since September,
when LIN reached an agreement with BellSouth on combining their
cellular interests.
   But LIN said Monday that McCaw submitted a revised buyout offer
Friday and the two sides ``conducted negotiations'' on it over the
weekend.
   LIN said BellSouth was invited to revise their cellular merger
agreement, but said the regional telephone company ``has not done
so at this time.''
   It said it could not enter a binding agreement with McCaw as
long as the merger agreement with BellSouth remains in effect.
   The Kirkland, Wash.-based McCaw is the largest U.S. cellular
telephone company, with nearly 50 million potential customers, but
it is seeking access to bigger markets in an effort to create a
national cellular network.
   The combined LIN and BellSouth cellular interests would have had
about 55 million potential customers, while a McCaw-LIN company
would have 70 million, including customers in five of the top 10
markets.
   ``Throughout this long process, our goal has has been to
maximize stockholder value,'' Donald A. Pels, LIN's president and
chief executive, said in a statement. ``The board's action in
recommending the revised McCaw offer is in accordance with that
goal.''
   The board's recommendation was announced after the stock market
closed.
   In national over-the-counter trading, LIN rose $1.50 a share to
close at $121.62{ while McCaw gained 75 cents a share to $39.25.
BellSouth rose 37{ cents a share to $54 in trading on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Under the new proposal, McCaw offered to buy 21.9 million shares
of LIN at $154.11 per share. With the 5.1 million LIN shares that
McCaw now owns, that would give McCaw just over 50 percent of LIN's
53.9 million common shares.
   Previously, McCaw offered to buy 22.5 million shares of LIN at
$150 per share.
   While each cash offer was worth $3.38 billion, McCaw said in the
revised proposal it would give LIN its nearly 5 percent interest in
a Los Angeles cellular franchise after the tender offer.
   As in the earlier offer, McCaw also would have LIN buy $425
million of McCaw stock and distribute it to LIN stockholders other
than McCaw.
   Under its agreement with BellSouth, LIN shareholders would get a
cash dividend of $42 a share, a 50 percent stake in the new
cellular company and stock in a new company that would consist of
LIN's seven television stations.
   Argus' Johnson said he estimated the value of the McCaw offer at
about $131 a share, up from $127.50 a share under its previous
offer due to inclusion of the Los Angeles cellular interest. He
valued the BellSouth offer at $124 a share.
   The terms of their agreement to merge cellular operations would
give BellSouth $54 million plus expenses if the agreement is
terminated.
   LIN had turned to BellSouth in September, coming up with the
plan to merge cellular interests after talks with McCaw broke down.
McCaw began its pursuit of LIN in early June.
   In Monday's announcement, LIN noted that as long as the
BellSouth merger agreement continues in effect, it cannot enter
into a binding agreement covering the new McCaw proposal.
   It added, however, that McCaw is ``irrevocably committed'' until
Feb. 28, 1990, to enter into a binding agreement with LIN as long
as LIN's board continues to recommend the McCaw transaction.
   If BellSouth does not terminate the merger agreement, LIN could
do so if LIN shareholders fail to approve it at a Jan 12
stockholders meeting called to consider the BellSouth deal.

   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner says
Exxon spent $1.9 billion cleaning up its Alaskan oil spill.
   Skinner, repeating his high praise for Exxon's cleanup of the
March 24 spill, characterized the amount as ``an unbelievable
number.''
   But Exxon spokesman Perry Smith in Alaska said the company has
only claimed ``over $1 billion'' in spending on the spill. Les
Rogers, a spokesman at Exxon central district headquarters in
Houston, Texas, said he knew of no other cost figure.
   Skinner, whose department includes the Coast Guard, has overseen
government response to the spill. He said the full story of Exxon's
efforts after the Exxon Valdez ran aground in March in Prince
William Sound has not been told.
   The ship spilled more than 10 million gallons of Alaskan crude
oil that spread over a many miles of scenic coastland.
   ``The last number I heard from Exxon Corp. is that they have
spent $1 billion, $900 million in their cleanup effort since the
accident,'' Skinner said.
   ``It should never have happened, but at least a very
substantial, good-faith effort has been made to clean up that
spill,'' he said.
   Smith said Exxon's expenses include ``over a billion dollars,''
including $160 million in claims paid to fishermen and others who
said they were harmed by the spill.
   Smith said no other breakdown of company spending was available.
He said expenses would include salaries for cleanup crews,
reimbursements to the Coast Guard for its work, equipment expenses
and fees for scientists and consultants.
   Skinner said nature is expected to contribute to the cleansing
of shorelines this winter.
   ``Next spring, we'll go up there and decide what remains to be
done, and they're committed to do whatever needs to be done,'' he
said, adding he expected the need to be considerably less than last
year.
   Smith, speaking for Exxon, said the company would wait to see
what the Coast Guard determines needs to be done in the spring,
``and we'll respond to them.''
   He said Exxon's response contrasted with operations after other
oil spills throughout the world ``where no effort close to that was
undertaken.''
   Environmentalists have been critical of the cleanup effort,
accusing the administration of letting the company off the hook
without examining long-term damage.
   The state of Alaska is suing Exxon, accusing it of negligence in
both the spill and the cleanup. Exxon has filed a countersuit,
alleging the state hindered the cleanup by opposing the use of
oil-dispersing chemicals.
   The Exxon Valdez captain, Joseph Hazelwood, faces trial Jan. 22
on three felony counts of criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges
of reckless endangerment, operating a vessel while intoxicated and
negligent discharge of oil. Exxon fired Hazelwood after the spill.

   A government proposal to curb the widely used
pesticide EBDC is prompting little enthusiasm among
environmentalists who say it doesn't go far enough, while the
industry is warning that consumers will have to pay more for poorer
quality fruits and vegetables.
   The Environmental Protection Agency proposed Monday to halt the
use of EBDCs on 45 food products, including tomatoes, potatoes,
bananas and lettuce.
   The family of pesticides, which has been linked to cancer, has
been used by farmers since the 1930s to combat fungus and mildew.
   The proposed restrictions would eliminate about 80 percent to 90
percent of the 18 million pounds of EBDCs used by American farmers.
But environmentalists complained the curbs would not go into effect
until early 1991 and would not cover 10 crops, including grapes,
onions and cranberries.
   ``The EPA appears unwilling to act swiftly and aggressively,''
said Janet Hathaway, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, the environmental group that earlier this year spawned a
consumer uproar by campaigning against the use of the
cancer-causing chemical Alar on apples.
   ``Even if EPA does what it is proposing ... the total risks from
legal uses of EBDCs is likely to be comparable to the cancer threat
posed by Alar,'' she said.
   The EPA announcement also prompted a rebuke from some members of
Congress.
   ``Tentative half steps will not do when what we need is a
wholesale reform of our pesticide laws. It will take years before
these pesticides will finally be taken off the market,'' said Sen.
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee.
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said he was troubled that
widespread EBDC use would continue for nearly two years as the EPA
goes through its regulatory procedures and he questioned whether
substitute chemicals will be safer.
   Laboratory tests have shown an EBDC byproduct called ETU causes
cancer in animals and likely causes cancer in human if lifelong
exposure is significant.
   Chronic exposure to EBDCs also raises the risks of birth defects
or thyroid disorders, health experts say.
   Manufacturers of EBDCs have said they plan to halt its use on 42
food products at the end of this year, accounting for about 40
percent to 50 percent of the EBDCs sold annually.
   But EPA Administrator William Reilly said Monday that the
industry action does not go far enough and that the fungicide also
should be prohibited on three other crops _ tomatoes, potatoes and
bananas _ which together account for nearly one-third of the EBDCs
used.
   While EBDCs for the most part do not pose a health threat on
individual food crops, they are so widely used ``the cumulative
risks has been determined to be unreasonable,'' the agency said.
   The EPA estimated the maximum risk of someone getting cancer
from a lifetime of exposure to EBDCs would be reduced to 3 in 1
million under the proposed curbs compared with 4 in 10,000 under
the chemical's current widespread use and a chance of 1 in 100,000
under the voluntary rollback of EBDC use already proposed by the
manufacturers.
   But a produce industry group, the Center for Produce Quality,
called EBDCs essential for growing crops and warned that decreased
use of the fungicide will mean higher produce prices and poorer
quality.
   ``Some alternative fungicides do exist and are approved for some
crops, but in many instances they are significantly less effective
or much more expensive than EBDCs,'' said John McClung of the
United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association.
   The produce industry has argued the EPA risk estimates are too
high because they reflect residues found in tests in the field and
not in stores. EBDC residues can easily wash off or decay with
time, said John Gardiner, an official of Du Pont Co., one of the
major EBDC manufacturers.
   He said preliminary results from marketbasket surveys indicate
much lower residue levels than the field tests.
   Environmentalists argue EBDCs are often present with other
cancer-causing pesticides on fruit and vegetables and studies
should take into account the cumulative effect.
   ``By conservative estimates,'' said Jay Feldman, of the National
Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides, ``there are 12 cancer
causing pesticides on apples, 10 on tomatoes, 13 on potatoes, three
on bananas and 11 on citrus fruits.''
   Under the EPA proposal, EBDCs would continue to be used on
grapes, wheat, cranberries, onions, sugar beets, sweet corn,
peanuts, almonds, asparagus and figs.
   The 45 other crops on which EBDCs are used are:
   Apples, apricots, bananas, barley, casaba melons, crenshaw
melons, cucumbers, eggplants, endives, lettuce, potatoes,
pineapples, pumpkins, green and dried beans, lima beans, broccoli,
Brussel sprouts, cabbage, cantaloupes, carrots, cauliflower,
celery, collards, field corn, cotton, crab apples, fennel, honeydew
melons, kale, kohlrabi, mustard greens, nectarines, oats, papayas,
peaches, pears, pecans, peppers, rhubarb, rye, squash, spinach,
tomatoes, turnips and watermelon.

   The economic incentives President Bush
proposed in Malta will allow Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
to claim an important symbolic victory, but they will do little to
help Gorbachev rescue his ailing economy, say U.S. experts on the
Soviet Union.
   Those analysts said they viewed Bush's weekend summit proposals
as an important first step in integrating the Soviets into the
global economic system.
   But they cautioned against looking for any big, immediate payoff
in terms of expanding Soviet trade or boosting Soviet living
standards.
   ``The Soviet economy is in very bad shape. The question is,
`Will this rouse that economy?' I am skeptical,'' said Marshall
Goldman, a Harvard professor and leading expert on the Soviet Union.
   ``The situaion is deteriorating in the Soviet Union,'' he said.
``You have got to turn around and show concrete results that will
end up on the table and that is just not happening.''
   In many ways, the Soviet economy is facing more dire problems
now than before Gorbachev launched his ``perestroika''
restructuring reforms. With winter approaching, the country is
plagued by strikes and severe shortages of many consumer items.
   Bush's economic proposals include:
   _Immediate start to negotiating a U.S.-Soviet trade agreement
with a goal of completion by June's planned summit in Washington
between the two leaders. That would also be the target for lifting
the 15-year-old high tariffs on Soviet goods imposed under the
Jackson-Vanik amendment that penalized the Soviets for their
restrictive emigration policies.
   _U.S. support for granting the Soviets observer status in the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the 97-country organization
that regulates world trade. The United States had previously
opposed Soviet requests for observer status in GATT, arguing that
the Soviet system was incompatible with GATT's free-trade
principles.
   _Recommendations that Congress lift a ban on providing trade
credits to the Soviet Union through the U.S. Export-Import Bank.
   _Negotiations leading to a U.S.-Soviet treaty that would
facilitate U.S. investments in the Soviet Union.
   While the proposals announced in Malta appear modest, economists
said they allowed Gorbachev to return to his own country with
symbolic victories showing concrete evidence of the Bush
administration's support for perestroika.
   ``This is a foot in the door for the Soviet Union,'' said Howard
Wachtel, an economics professor at American University. ``It sets
in motion a train of activity which had largely been cut off by
Stalin when he opted not to participate in Western economic
organizations after World War II.''
   In addition to observer status in GATT, the Soviets are
considering seeking admission to the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank. Admission in those organizations, still
considered to be far in the future, would open up a substantial
borrowing pool the Soviets could tap to support their economy.
   Bush seemed to be seeking to play down expectations for
immediate payoffs.
   In a news conference Monday in Brussels, Bush said the chances
Gorbachev would be allowed to participate in next year's economic
summit with the West's seven leading industrial countries were
``slim and none.''
   But Bush said his initiatives would help provide the Soviets
with important expertise on how market-based economies work.
   Dwayne O. Andreas, chief executive of the agricultural giant,
Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. of Decatur, Ill., said the lifting of
the high tariffs on Soviet products would allow the Soviets to sell
more goods here and should foster reciprocal actions by the Soviets
to purchase more American goods, particularly agricultural products.
   ``Unleashing the forces of free-enterprise (in the Soviet Union)
can't be anything but beneficial'' to prospects for world peace,
Andreas said.
   U.S. sales to the Soviet Union have totaled $3.22 billion so far
this year, primarily in agricultural products, while Soviet sales
in this country total $555 million.
   Economists said the summit agreements were not likely to boost
that total quickly although they saw opportunities for increasing
sales of such consumer items as vodka and Soviet furs.
   ``The Soviets don't have the money to buy a lot more in terms of
imports and they don't have all that much to export,'' said David
Wyss, chief financial economist for DRI-McGraw Hill.
   But Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Co., said it
would be wrong to judge the Malta summit a failure if it does not
produce quick economic results.
   ``Malta is a long-run affair with all kinds of great promise,''
he said. ``One should be cautious, but there are great hopes and
optimism that a new era is dawning.''

   Estonians soon will be saying the
equivalent of ``Charge it,'' as the tiny republic begins a venture
into plastic money that could lead to widespread use of credit
cards in the Soviet Union.
   Estonia's deputy prime minister, Viktor Rajevski, outlined a
three-step plan Monday that would bring Visa cards to Estonia
starting next year, then to the other Baltic republics, Latvia and
Lithuania, and finally to other Soviet republics.
   ``Launching plastic money is like a new philosophy in the Soviet
Union,'' Rajevksi said through an interpreter in an interview
during a visit with officials at Visa International headquarters.
``Mr. Gorbachev has supported the economic events in Estonia in his
speeches several times.''
   Estonia, the smallest of the Baltic states with a population of
1.6 million, is in the northwestern corner of the Soviet Union near
Finland. Its language is similar to Finnish. Rajevski described the
republic as a ``window to the West.''
   He said he envisions Estonia as a financial and commercial
center in Eastern Europe, with its banks issuing Visa cards for
other republics. Estonia already has three free economic zones and
was the first Soviet republic to establish the principle of a
self-funding economy.
   Toby Mitchell, of Visa International in London, said it was the
first time Visa had worked with a Soviet government to develop a
bank card program.
   The first Visa card in the Soviet Union was issued in July 1988
through Intourist, the commercial organization of the Soviet state
committee for foreign travel. Only a few thousand cards have since
been issued throughout the country.
   ``It's important for Visa to work with an entire economic unit
in the Soviet Union in providing a total regional payment
solution,'' Mitchell said. ``It gets us far deeper into the banking
system.''
   Estonia is attractive to Visa, Mitchell said, because it is the
most economically developed of the Soviet republics. Only 50 miles
from Helsinki, Finland, ``Estonia, culturally, is more western than
other Soviet states,'' he said. ``It is more likely to develop
Western products and practices quickly.
   ``And it is sufficiently small so that it provides an ideal
test-bed for the implementation of national card systems
elsewhere,'' he said. ``You can work with a million card program
whereas if you'd try any of the larger republics the numbers start
getting beyond any easy control.''
   Estonia has a tradition of testing economic reforms in the
Soviet Union, and Mitchell said it will be a long time before the
whole Soviet Union adopts sophisticated banking systems.
   ``The difference in cultures, the difference in economic and
social structures between the Central Asian republics and Baltic
republics is enormous but we hope that Estonia will provide the
model,'' Mitchell said.
   Under the plan, any Estonian with an income, regardless of age
or whether he or she is a student or retired, will be issued a Visa
card.
   The cards will be used primarily as debit or payment cards, as
they are throughout most of Europe, rather than as credit cards, as
they are in the United States. Money will be debited from
cardholder accounts as soon as purchases are made, but if the
accounts are overdrawn credit will be granted, with interest, for
three months.
   Estonians and others in the Soviet Union have large amounts of
savings because of the inadequacy of available consumer goods,
Rajevski said. Officials hope that as more goods are made available
through economic reforms, use of the Visa cards, instead of cash,
will make it easier for officials to regulate currency and avoid
devaluations.

   The dollar rose against all major foreign
currencies except the Canadian dollar today in thin European
trading, currency dealers said.
   Gold prices fell in Europe as much as $6.25 a troy ounce,
continuing a sharp decline on profit-taking, bullion dealers said.
   Markets were slowing as the year end approaches, with many
dealers saying they were unwilling to take positions which could
affect their profits or increase losses.
   ``It's getting very thin,'' a Frankfurt trader said. ``A lot of
banks are just stopping. It's getting very boring.''
   Toru Kanai, a currency analyst with New Japan Securities, Co.
said earlier trading in Tokyo was also quiet.
   ``Trading was very boring, and there is no news until Friday,
when the U.S. unemployment figures for November come out,'' he said.
   The markets hope the unemployment data will give an indication
of what the Federal Reserve's monetary policy will be, traders said.
   ``It's all a problem of interest rates and right now there's no
clear indication from the Fed,'' said a Milan trader.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.20 yen to a closing 143.68 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 143.70 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.7850 West German marks, up from 1.7808; 1.6050
Swiss francs, up from 1.5995; 6.0945 French francs, up from 6.0800;
2.0137 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0095; 1,314.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,312.00; 1.1635 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1640.
   In London, the dollar rose slightly against the British pound.
It cost $1.5636 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5638 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $402.35 a troy ounce,
down from $406.25 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $402.60.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $401.75, down from $408 bid late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $6.45 to close at a bid $402.86.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.54 a troy ounce from
Monday's $5.60.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index climbed to a
new high closing for the ninth time in 10 trading days today, while
the dollar edged up against the Japanese yen for the third
consecutive trading day.
   The dollar closed at 143.68 yen, up 0.20 yen from Monday's
143.48-yen finish. It opened at 143.70 yen and stayed in a narrow
range between 143.67 yen and 143.85 yen. The dollar now has gained
0.78 yen in three trading days.
   ``Today's trading was extremely thin,'' said a trader with
Mitsubishi Bank in Tokyo. Spot trading volume totaled $4.1 billion
as most market players remained on the sidelines awaiting the
release Friday of data on U.S. unemployment in November, he added.
   ``There was no major movement, although the fluctuation was kind
of nervous,'' he said on condition of anonymity.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues rose 190.30 points, or 0.51 percent, closing at 37,494.17.
The previous record of 37,303.87 was set Monday, when the index
climbed 171.19 points.
   In the last 10 trading days, the only pause in the succession of
record high closings for the index came Friday, when it declined
slightly after a seven-day climb.
   Stability on the foreign exchange market and expectations for
lower domestic short-term interest rates encouraged investors
today, dealers said.
   Yutaka Yoshino, a dealer with Nikko Securities Co., said,
``Today's dealings followed an uptrend from yesterday, when market
players believed East-West tensions had ended as a result of the
U.S.-Soviet summit meeting over the weekend.''
   Japanese investors see this relaxation as likely to provide new
business opportunities, he said.
   Institutional investors also were buying in efforts to wrap up
the year with increased profits, he added.
   Some investors were selling to take profits because of concern
over the speed of the index's rise, but this was more than offset
by buying based on optimism concerning interest rates and business
opportunities in the Eastern bloc, Yoshino said.
   An estimated 1.3 billion shares changed hands on the first
section, up from 1.2 billion the previous day. Among gainers were
steel, shipbuilding and electrical issues.

<HEAD>With PM-Wall Resigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of some key events in the
collapse of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, of Irvine,
Calif., expected to become the nation's largest S&amp;L failure at a
cost to taxpayers of $2 billion.
   _Feb. 22, 1984: American Continental Corp., a home-building
company formed six years earlier by Phoenix, Ariz., millionaire
Charles H. Keating Jr., buys Lincoln Savings and Loan for $51
million. The thrift embarks on a program of rapid growth by moving
out of residential lending and into junk bonds and risky direct
investments in real estate and commercial ventures.
   _March 12, 1986: The Federal Home Loan Bank in San Francisco,
suspicious of Lincoln's rapid growth and investment activity,
begins an examination.
   _April 2, 1987: Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz., John Glenn, D-Ohio, and John McCain, R-Ariz., meet with
Edwin Gray, then chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, in
DeConcini's office.
   _April 9, 1987: The four senators and Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr.,
D-Mich., meet with San Francisco examiners.
   _May 1, 1987: San Francisco examiners recommend that Lincoln,
although solvent, be seized for operating in an unsafe and unsound
manner and dissipating its assets.
   _July 1, 1987: M. Danny Wall, a former aide to Sen. Jake Garn of
Utah, the senior Republican on the Senate Banking Committee,
succeeds Gray as bank board chairman. Wall would have three
meetings with Keating: Sept. 24, 1987, Jan. 28, 1988, and Jan. 17,
1989. In August, Wall orders his staff to conduct an independent
review of the Lincoln examination.
   _May 20, 1988: The bank board in Washington signs a memorandum
of understanding with Lincoln. It provides for a new examination to
be conducted by officials in Washington, not San Francisco.
   _Nov. 22, 1988: The second bank board examination is concluded.
   _December 1988 through March 1989: Keating makes three attempts
to sell Lincoln. Sens. DeConcini and Cranston and Rep. Carroll
Hubbard, D-Ky., make calls to Wall on Lincoln's behalf. The bank
board eventually rejects the applications, saying because the
buyers all had ties in some way to Keating the sales would not be
arms-length transactions.
   _Feb. 14, 1989: The bank board begins a third examination of
Lincoln.
   _April 13, 1989: American Continental Corp. files for protection
under bankruptcy laws. A day later, the bank board seizes control
of Lincoln.
   _April 17, 1989: The bank board sends criminal referrals on
alleged fraud at Lincoln to U.S. attorneys and the FBI in Phoenix,
New York and Los Angeles.
   _May 12, 1989: Lincoln, in a lawsuit, alleges that the seizure
by regulators was illegal.
   _Sept. 15, 1989: The Resolution Trust Corp., a new agency with
jurisdiction over Lincoln, seeks $1.1 billion from Keating, his
relatives and associates in a fraud and racketeering suit alleging
Keating diverted depositors' money for his own use.
   _Oct. 17, 1989: Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the
House Banking Committee, launches the first of six hearings
investigating Lincoln's collapse. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
Chairman L. William Seidman estimates that taxpayers will have to
spend between $1.5 billion and $2 billion to protect Lincoln's
depositors.
   _Oct. 27, 1989: Gonzalez writes to President Bush suggesting
that Wall should ``step aside.''
   _Nov. 17, 1989: The Senate Ethics Committee decides to appoint
an outside counsel to investigate the actions of the five senators,
the first step in what could become a more extensive probe.
   _Nov. 21, 1989: Wall responds to his critics before Gonzalez's
committee.
   _Dec. 4, 1989: Wall announces his resignation, but says he will
stay on for an unspecified period to ease the transition for his
successor.

   When his handling of the Lincoln Savings and
Loan Association's financial troubles first came under fire 18
months ago, M. Danny Wall responded with typical bravado and
optimism.
   ``I will suffer the slings and arrows, but I will be damned if I
will violate my public trust,'' the nation's top savings and loan
regulator said, predicting that time would prove the wisdom of his
actions.
   But Monday, even the ever-optimistic Wall conceded he had run
out of time. He resigned as director of the Office of Thrift
Supervision, the agency created as part of the S&amp;L bailout package
passed by Congress this year.
   Wall, 50, a former top aide to Republican Sen. Jake Garn of
Utah, won the job as top cop of the troubled thrift industry 2{
years ago because of his political skills and backing.
   He blamed his downfall on politics as well, particularly those
of the House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas.
   ``The simplistic efforts to find a scapegoat to shoulder the
blame for the entire thrift crisis led various critics to join in
the hue and cry raised by the House Banking Committee chairman for
my departure from office,'' Wall said in his resignation letter to
President Bush.
   Many had wondered why M. Danny Wall _ the M. stands for Melvin _
wanted the job in the first place. It was no easy assignment,
regulating 3,100 savings and loans at a time when bad investments
had left many institutions broke and more at the brink of
insolvency.
   ``I like a challenge,'' was the stock response from Wall, a
balding man with a neatly trimmed beard and a penchant for
three-piece suits.
   Those who knew him said Wall sought the job because he wanted to
leave the shadows of Capitol Hill for a command of his own.
   ``The trouble is it's difficult to come out smelling well when
you command a garbage scow,'' said Kenneth Guenther, executive vice
president of the Independent Bankers Association of America.
   Wall's career in public service dates back 27 years, to Fargo,
N.D., where in 1962 he managed two Department of Housing and Urban
Development projects. He went on to a HUD-related post in Salt Lake
City, where he met Garn, soon to be the city's mayor.
   Garn came to the Senate in 1975. Wall came with him and rose to
be his top aide. When Republicans took control of the Senate in
1981, Garn became Banking Committee chairman; Wall its staff
director. In 1982, they pushed through Congress legislation
deregulating savings institutions.
   When the Democrats regained control of the Senate after the 1986
elections, Wall began lobbying to replace Edwin Gray as head of the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the forerunner of the Office of
Thrift Supervision.
   The White House was looking for someone with the political
skills to deal with Congress as evidence of massive financial
problems in the savings and loan industry grew.
   Wall, with Garn's backing, got the nomination and won easy
bipartisan support.
   Initial reaction was favorable; Wall won plaudits for being
accessible, a style symbolized by his decision to leave open the
heavy glass door to his office.
   ``If somebody wants to talk to me, I'm going to listen to
them,'' he said recently. ``You can't close your door to your
constituents.''
   But the honeymoon was short.
   As the industry's problems mounted, time and time again Wall was
forced to increase his estimate of the scope of the debacle,
damaging his credibility in Congress.
   Critics said Wall's strengths on Capitol Hill, where compromise
is the norm, were weaknesses at the bank board.
   ``You have to be a really tough person and you have to be
willing to sit down with a guy eyeball to eyeball and say, `I'm
going to take your business away from you,''' said Bert Ely, a
banking analyst who repeatedly has criticized Wall. ``I don't think
Danny had that in him.''
   Still others said his ties to the Senate left him vulnerable to
political pressure, particularly in the case of Lincoln, whose
owner, Charles Keating, enlisted a handful of senators to help him
lobby regulators.
   Wall denied those allegations to the end, telling Bush that
``neither political influence nor Lincoln's Charles Keating
affected my decision on Lincoln. Nor for that matter have I ever
made decisions for political reasons.''
   But he said the congressional scrutiny of his actions was
distracting his staff from their mission _ ``revitalizing the
thrift industry.''
   As a child, M. Danny Wall said he was raised not to run from a
fight. But he decided it was time to walk away, telling Bush:
   ``I am not willing to stand and fight at the expense of the
goals of your administration. ... I am not going to be a party to
such a handicap.''

   The latest victim of the turbulent junk
bond market may be the $225 million leveraged buyout of Michaels
Stores Inc., analysts said.
   ``To me, it looks like it is a dead deal,'' Dick Edelman, a
Southwest Securities Inc. analyst, said Monday.
   An investor group led by Fort Worth millionaire Robert Bass
failed to raise the bond financing needed to take Michaels Stores
private, the specialty retailer announced Friday.
   Despite a willingness by store management and the Bass group,
MSI Holdings, to complete the deal, analysts said it was unlikely
that the $150 million in junk bond and bank financing could be
arranged before the Dec. 31 expiration of the agreement. It was
also unclear whether either side would extend the deadline.
   ``The deal is technically dead at the end of the month,'' said
Michaels President B.B. Tuley. Regarding completion of the deal, he
said, ``I can't say if I am optimistic or pessimistic.''
   An extension of the agreement would depend on sales during the
fourth quarter, which includes the Christmas rush, Tuley said.
Fourth quarter sales comprise 40 percent of the company's revenue
and 60 percent to 70 percent of its operating profits annually.
   MSI Holdings, which offered investors $9.50 per share in cash
and $2.50 per share in preferred stock, is controlled by merchant
banker Grauer &amp; Wheat Investments and a Bass entity, Acadia
Partners LP. American Express and Equitable Life Assurance Society
are two of Acadia's partners.
   The investor group says it will continue to seek financing
through Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. of New York.
   Dennis Telzrow, an analyst at Eppler Guerin &amp; Turner Inc., said
the proposed buyout would heavily leverage the company, which may
be one reason why the Michaels deal is being viewed skeptically by
the market.
   ``We felt the financing was questionable because of the cash
flow coverage,'' Telzrow said. Under the $225 million buyout, the
company's debt to equity ratio would climb from 2-to-1 to about
4-or 5-to-1.
   About $75 million of the $150 million in debt would be junk
bonds, with the rest either bank financing or senior debt, said
Peter Grauer, co-chairman of Grauer &amp; Wheat Investments. A
financing commitment has already been obtained from Wells Fargo &amp;
Co. in San Francisco.
   A home decoration and arts and crafts retailer, Michaels
operates 121 stores in 17 states.

<HEAD>Mellon Agrees To Buy 54 Branches</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mellon Bank Corp. said today that it agreed to
acquire 54 branch offices from a subsidiary of Meritor Savings Bank
for around $335 million.
   The agreement to buy the offices of PSFS was approved by the
boards of directors of Mellon Bank (East), the Mellon unit
purchasing the branches, and by Philadelphia-based Meritor.
   Mellon will assume deposits of about $5.2 billion and acquire
assets of $4.9 billion from PSFS.
   The purchase price, subject to certain adjustments, is expected
to be about $335 million, but no less than $309 million, Mellon
said. It said it expects to finance the purchase by issuing a
combination of common stock, preferred stock and debt.
   After the transaction is completed, Mellon Bank (East) plans to
change its name to ``Mellon PSFS'' and operate all its Philadelphia
area branches under that name, Mellon said.
   The transaction will increase Mellon's deposit market share from
about 5 percent to about 14 percent in the Philadelphia market,
Mellon said.
   As of Sept. 30, Mellon Bank (East) had assets of $4.4 billion
and deposits of $3.1 billion at 66 branch offices.
   The $4.9 billion of assets being acquired include: $2.7 billion
of U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities, $1.5 billion
of one-to-four family mortgage loans, $400 million of other loans
and $300 million of liquid and fixed assets.
   The agreement is subject to regulatory approval.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Grain and soybean futures opened higher in quiet
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Prices across the board were expected to bounce back from
yesterday's selloff, with corn leading the way because of higher
than expected weekly export inspections. The inspections are an
indication of the amount of grain ready for export.
   There was an expectation that current corn prices could generate
additional export demand, said analyst Joel Karlin of Research
Department Inc.
   Wheat futures were higher following yesterday's announcement of
wheat purchases by the Soviet Union and Iraq.
   Continued dry conditions in winter wheat crop areas also was
expected to boost prices. Private forecasters on Monday had
predicted rain for the area.
   Soybean prices were expected to pressured by reports the weather
in South America is favorable to soybean development.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent to { cent higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.04\ a bushel; corn was \
cent to 1 cent higher with December at $2.33{ a bushel; oats were \
cent to { cent higher with December at $1.43{ a bushel; soybeans
were \ cent to 1{ cents higher with January at $5.73} a bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Pork futures received a boost from projections for mostly stable
wholesale pork product prices.
   Livestock futures were lifted by slightly higher prices paid for
boxed beef.
   Live cattle were .03 cent to .18 cent higher with December at
75.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .22 cent higher
with January at 82.85 cents a pound; hogs were .03 cent to .45 cent
higher with December at 50.90 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .08 cent to .30 cent higher with February at 56 cents a pound.
   Livestock futures settled higher and pork futures lower in
Monday's trading.

   Stock prices were higher but had eased off
earlier levels in moderately active trading today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 4.05 points to
2,757.68 at noon EST. The blue-chip indicator was 6.18 points
higher an hour earlier.
   Advancing issues outpaced decliners by about 7 to 6 on the New

   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 78.81 million

   Analysts said the market was lower at the opening but quickly
moved higher on the strength of a few key stocks, including
technology issues after International Business Machines Corp.

a $4 billion share buyback, a cutback of 10,000 jobs and a
fourth-quarter charge of $2.3 billion.
   ``The market started tiring out yesterday. IBM's announcement is

Geronimous, senior vice president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Strength in transportation stocks also was giving the market a

the best way
to protect American citizens, White House spokesman Marlin

   ``You can be assured that the Pentagon has contingency plans for
everything,'' Fitzwater said, while declining to elaborate on what
additional military steps the United States might take.
   On Friday, the first day of the coup attempt, U.S. F-4 Phantom
fighter jets flew air cover in support of pro-government forces
staging their sixth attempt to oust Mrs. Aquino since she was swept
to power in 1986.
   More than 74 people have been killed and more than 500 wounded
since rebels launched the bloodiest attempt yet to topple Mrs.
Aquino's administration. Rebels say the elected government has
failed to deal effectively with the country's Communist insurgency,
corruption, incompetence and economic problems.
   At least two people were killed and 15 wounded in today's
fighting, one of the dead a 6-year-old girl killed when a 60mm
mortar fired by the rebels slammed into a squatter settlement near
the Makati Medical Center.
   In addition to the 400 or so rebels entrenched in the Makati
financial district, a similar number still occupied Mactan Air Base
in Cebu, 350 miles south of Manila, despite an ultimatum to leave
the garrison by today.
   Tourism officials today prepared about 20 buses to go into
Makati to evacuate tourists to the airport, but heavy fighting
forced them to halt the convoy.
   After hours of negotiations with the rebels _ members of the
elite 1st Scout Ranger Regiment, government negotiators said the
evacuation would be delayed for at least a day.
   ``They've decided to postpone it for tomorrow because it's
nightfall and we don't want the tourists to be mistaken for
soldiers,'' said Rafael Alunan, undersecretary of tourism.
   The insurgents on Saturday moved into the district that is home
to many foreign diplomats and journalists, taking control of about
22 buildings.
   The U.S. Embassy and others urged their nationals to flee
Makati, even if they lived in areas not yet touched by the fighting.
   Scores of Americans arrived today at the U.S. Seafront housing
compound, which was guarded by U.S. Marines. Others moved to hotels
near Manila Bay, about five miles west of the fighting.
   The Philippine Plaza said 450 foreigners had checked into the
hotel by midafternoon.
   ``We're telling Americans that if they can get out safely, get
out,'' said U.S. Embassy spokesman Jerry Huchel. ``But if they
can't, stay where you are, but keep away from upper floors.''
   Huchel estimated that about 215 Americans were trapped in three
luxury hotels in Makati. The Manila Chronicle quoted military
reports as saying nine American servicemen from U.S.-run Clark Air
Base, 50 miles north of Manila, were among them.
   A statement distributed to news organizations in the name of
cashiered Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, a fugitive, said
the rebels did not want to hurt civilians.
   ``We would like to emphasize that what we are doing is for the
good of all the Filipino people for the longer term,'' the
statement said. ``We cannot continue with the present system in
which the political, economic and moral fiber of this country is
slowly and shamelessly rent apart by the Aquino regime under the
shameless support of the U.S. imperialists in the guise of
democracy.''
   Mutineers on Friday took over several military facilities and
bombed the presidential palace. With the U.S. air support,
government forces counterattacked and regained most positions.
   Honasan once supported Mrs. Aquino but led an August 1987
attempt to overthrow her.

   The White House said today it has begun
searching for a replacement for the embattled M. Danny Wall as the
nation's top savings and loan regulator but that the post would not
be filled until January.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater commented a day after
Wall announced in a letter to President Bush that he was quitting a
job he said amounted to a ``thankless and perhaps impossible
task.'' He said he was leaving to spare his Office of Thrift
Supervision the disruption that would be caused by continuing his
fight for political survival with Congress.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the administration
was conferring on the vacancy with Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady, to whom Wall reported; Michael Boskin, the chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisers; and members of Congress.
   Since Congress is in recess, ``it will be January before a new
director is in place,'' Fitzwater said.
   Wall set no date for his departure, saying he would stay on for
a transition period. He said he was looking forward to a job out of
government but had no specific position in mind.
   Early speculation on Wall's successor centered on three
experienced regulators. According to an industry source they are:
   _Richard F. Syron, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of
Boston and a former president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Boston.
   _William H. Roelle, a long-time official of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. in charge of S&amp;L rescue deals at the Resolution
Trust Corp.
   _William Taylor, a senior regulatory official at the Federal
Reserve Board serving as an adviser to the administration board
that oversees the RTC.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said although
all three men were well regarded by Treasury Department officials
who oversee Wall's agency, other candidates also could surface.
   Until Thanksgiving, the House Banking Committee was holding
weekly hearings spotlighting Wall's failure to contain what could
become the nation's largest S&amp;L failure. The regulator was spending
much of his time responding to his critics.
   Most recently, Wall has come under fire for his handling of
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, an Irvine, Calif., thrift
whose failure is expected to cost taxpayers up to $2.5 billion.
   House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, the
first to call for Wall's ouster, faulted the regulator for
rejecting a May 1987 recommendation from federal examiners in San
Francisco that Lincoln be seized.
   Wall said examiners had not produced the evidence needed to
legally justify the seizure, which occurred in April. At a packed
news conference, Wall said if he had it to do over again he might
have ordered the seizure and let the courts take the blame for
blocking it.
   ``It may indeed have been a no-win situation,'' he said.
   Even before Gonzalez began probing the Lincoln case, Wall
endured grueling congressional criticism for what proved to be
grossly low estimates of the size of the S&amp;L crisis and for a rash
of S&amp;L bailout deals in December 1988 driven by expiring tax
benefits.
   However, he is generally given credit for raising morale at his
agency and rebuilding its depleted ranks of examiners.
   Wall was ``wrong, but not corrupt,'' according to Rep. Jim
Leach, R-Iowa, a member of the banking panel.
   Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., also a member of the committee, said
Wall ``put politics first and good public policy second'' and used
``excessively bad judgment.''
   Gonzalez called for Wall's resignation in a letter to Bush in
October. In recent weeks the committee chairman was joined by
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, three
taxpayer-advocacy groups and several major newspapers.
   Neither Brady nor Bush defended Wall in public and, according to
government sources, White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray was pushing
for his ouster.
   Wall, however, said ``this has been completely at my
initiative'' and passed up several opportunities to criticize the
administration for lack of support. He said no one at the White
House asked him to leave.
   The regulator said he had offered to leave office last January,
but the administration, which then was drafting proposed S&amp;L
bailout legislation, wanted him to serve out his term through June
30, 1991.
   Wall reserved his most bitter remarks for Gonzalez, accusing the
committee chairman of orchestrating ``simplistic efforts to find a
scapegoat to shoulder the blame for the entire thrift crisis.'' He
said Gonzalez resorted to ``corruption of the truth and abandonment
of our historical devotion to fair play.''
   Gonzalez's committee heard from Wall for 10 hours in late
November but only after the committee had already conducted five
all-day sessions to hear from the agency's critics. The regulator
attacked what he called the ``deliberately lopsided presentation''
during the hearings.

<TEXT>
   Once a popular way of saving for the holidays, today's
``Christmas Clubs'' have gone the way of the one-horse open sleigh
in the sophisticated world of investments.
   The prevalence of savings products with more generous yields and
widespread reliance on credit cards have dampened many depositors'
desires to open up these traditional accounts.
   Many banks and thrifts also have stopped offering Christmas
Clubs because they've become too costly to maintain, while those
that still offer them no longer advertise to promote the service.
   Between 55 percent and 60 percent of the nation's credit unions,
though, still offer holiday clubs.
   ``We like to say that they're a fully matured product,'' said
Richard Arnold, national sales manager at Christmas Club A Corp.,
which created the concept in 1910, when a Carlisle, Pa., bank
organized a holiday savings program for schoolchildren.
   Even the Easton, Pa., company, which still markets club coupon
booklets to about 5,000 financial institutions nationwide, has been
shifting away from its namesake, printing everything from
tax-collection booklets for state governments to bill-payment
booklets for cable television.
   An estimated 23 million Americans hold some type of holiday
savings account, a number that has held relatively steady for a
number of years, according to Christmas Club A Corp. The average
annual savings total runs between $300 and $400.
   Christmas Clubs generally attract customers who can't afford
savings accounts that may require a minimum balance, or who need
the discipline of a forced savings plan. Many banks see holiday
accounts more as a service to their customer than a money maker.
   These clubs usually start in the fall, just as the holiday
season is about to begin and when many consumers realize they
should have saved more for gifts, and are aimed at accumulating
money for the following Christmas. Clubs typically permit weekly
deposits of as little as $5. Although there are no fees, early
withdrawal or failure to meet the deposit schedule may result in
interest penalties.
   Many banks have dropped coupon payment books, long associated
with these accounts, in favor of less costly electronic fund
transfers, which take an automatic deduction from checking or
savings.
   Either way, the returns on holiday clubs may conjure up more
images of Scrooge than Santa Claus.
   Some institutions don't even provide interest, offering instead
a stuffed animal, Christmas tree ornament or other premium when an
account is opened.
   For clubs that do pay interest, yields run slightly lower or
about the same as those on passbook savings accounts, which average
5.17 percent nationwide, or statement savings accounts, which
average 5.22 percent, according to Bank Rate Monitor, a North Palm
Beach, Fla.-based newsletter. Credit unions often pay slightly
higher rates on holiday club accounts than do banks and thrifts.
   But a more sophisticated investor with the self-discipline to
regularly put away money _ rather than running up credit card
balances _ can do better elsewhere.
   A $1,000 annual deposit in a Christmas Club would yield an
average $51.70. The same $1,000 invested in a one-year certificate
of deposit yielding 8.12 percent simple interest would earn $81.20,
according to Bank Rate Monitor.
   Bank deregulation, which marks its seventh anniversary
Wednesday, helped make Christmas Clubs less attractive because it
enabled financial institutions to offer more competitive, higher
yields on a wider variety of investment products, such as CDs or
money market accounts.
   ``Before deregulation ... when all banks and thrifts paid the
same rates on passbook accounts Christmas Clubs were annual
re-inventions of the wheel,'' said Robert K. Heady, Bank Rate
Monitor's publisher. ``Today, Santa is almost absent from bank
ads.''
   At Chemical Bank in New York, where only 1,000 of its depositors
have holiday club accounts, some branches don't even mention that
Christmas Clubs are available.
   ``There are certain branches where it's much more popular than
others. And those people will put up a very modest sign saying,
`Yes, we have holiday clubs,''' said Susan McLoughlin, assistant
vice president of Chemical's deposit products group.
   A recent study for Christmas Club A Corp. indicated a majority
of the holiday club savers kept up their accounts almost out of

   Stocks ended higher in thin trading on London's
Stock Exchange Tuesday, boosted by strength in the property sector,
some healthy earnings reports and a stronger pound.
   ``There is a continuation of the bullish sentiment we saw last
week, although it wasn't a particularly busy day,'' one dealer said.
   By the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 24.1 points, or 1.05 percent, at 2,327.5, well above its
early morning low of 2,301.2.
   The Financial Times 30-share index ended 13.8 points higher at
1,836.8. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 11.60 points to
close at 1,265.88.
   Volume totaled 428.5 million shares, down from 484.4 million
shares Monday.
   After a weak opening, shares rose on news that British Land PLC,
Britain's third largest property company, suspended trading of its
shares at 359 pence ($5.60) pending an announcement Wednesday that
involves proposals to maximize shareholder value. Traders
speculated the company may announce the sale of property.
   The news strengthened the property sector, recently the focus of
bearish sentiment because of Britain's high interest rates and
slowing economy.

   Stock prices fell in afternoon trading,
reflecting investor confusion about the direction of the economy,
analysts said.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 7.26 points to
2,746.37 at 2 p.m. EST. The blue-chip indicator was up 4.05 points
at noon.
   Declining issues outpaced advancers by about 5 to 4 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 789 issues down, 632 up and 512 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 115.32 million
shares.
   The market got an early boost from IBM's announcement of a major
restructuring. International Business Machines Corp. announced a $4
billion share buyback, a cutback of 10,000 jobs and a
fourth-quarter charge of $2.3 billion.
   But after drifting at slightly higher levels, the market
retreated shortly after midday.
   ``We have a very dull and down drifting market,'' said Alfred E.
Goldman, vice president of A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St Louis.
   Wall Street analysts said the economy and interest rates
continued to be the focal point of concern ahead of Friday's report
on November unemployment. Most recent economic data has pointed to
a slowdown in economic growth.

<HEAD>Interest Rates Soar, But Austral Still Loses Ground to Dollar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By OSCAR J. SERRAT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Banks offered interest rates as
high as 37 percent a month _ about seven times the rate of
inflation _ as the government tried Tuesday to prop up the austral,
Argentina's battered currency.
   Nevertheless, the dollar rose against the austral. At the close
of the business day, foreign exchange houses offered dollars for
995 australs apiece, about 7 percent higher than the opening rate
of 930-1.
   The official rate, set last July 9 and supposedly in effect
until next March, is 655-1. President Carlos Menem, Economy
Minister Nestor Rapanelli and Central Bank President Egidio
Iannella have insisted there will be no formal devaluation because
it would aggravate the country's inflation problem.
   The cost of living increase for November is projected at about 5
percent, a tremendous improvement over the 197 percent increase
last July, when Menem took office. However, the government had
anticipated an increase of only about 2 percent.
   The failure to meet that economic target and others, including a
major reduction in state spending and small wage increases to
organized labor, is cited by analysts for the month-long runup of
the dollar.
   The gap between the official and black market australs has been
50 percent or higher for nearly a week. That gap prompted Central
Bank officials to raise interest rates, which theoretically makes
australs more attractive to investors and raises their value
against the dollar.
   Top government officials continue to insist there is no reason
for the austral's de facto devaluation, and that they will not sell
currency reserves _ as former President Raul Alfonsin did last year
when confronted with a similar situation _ to drive down the dollar.
   Merchants, who often view the dollar as a barometer of future
inflation or political uncertainty, publicly have been urged not to
raise prices in an effort to maintain the value of their products
in dollar terms. Many have done so anyway.
   Interest rates that began to rise last Friday have gone so high
as to provoke worries they are drawing money away from investment
as well as from financial speculation. ``We're following this
process closely,'' Menem said Tuesday.
   Last week, interest rates were about 8 percent a month.
   The highest monthly rates of 37 percent were offered only to
large depositors.

<HEAD>Witness Says Boeing Maintained Secret Library of Classified Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: New throughout with testimony. ^By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. maintained a secret
library of classified documents through much of the 1970s at a
marketing office in Kent, Wash., a retired employee of the
aerospace giant testified today.
   The witness, Gloria Mahaffey, testified at the U.S. District
Court trial of Richard Lee Fowler, a onetime Boeing Co. employee
accused of illegally obtaining classified budget documents from the
Department of Defense.
   He has pleaded innocent to 39 felony counts, including
conspiracy, illegal conveyance of classified documents and mail
fraud.
   Ms. Mahaffey, who has been granted immunity from prosecution by
U.S. attorneys, said the documents were used by a ``very select
group of marketing managers for Boeing.''
   She said they were delivered to her by Fowler, among other
Boeing employees, but were not entered into a company log used to
keep track of classified documents.
   At times she obscured with correction fluid or covered with
small pieces of paper the classification stamp on the documents,
Ms. Mahaffey said.
   When the documents became obsolete, she said, she destroyed
them. ``I took them home and burned them in my fireplace, page by
page,'' she said.
   At one point in the mid 1970s, Ms. Mahaffey said, she was
ordered to destroy the documents in the library and to immediately
leave and lock her office.
   Instead, Ms. Mahaffey said, she volunteered to take the
documents home where they sat in her recreation room for about two
weeks. Eventually ``I was called to come back to work and open up
shop again,'' she said.
   Ms. Mahaffey testified that when she set up the library in Kent
in 1973 or 1974 she was told the data was ``commonly used
throughout the industry. The impression I had was that the
documents were not generally in the public domain but that other
companies had access.''
   Fowler worked at Boeing from 1978 until he was fired in 1986. He
could face 310 years in prison and fines of $225,000 if convicted.
   During the first day of testimony Monday, former Secretary of
Defense Frank Carlucci said it was well known around the Pentagon
that documents Fowler is accused of stealing ``were not releasable
documents.''
   But under cross-examination, Carlucci said that during his time
at the Department of Defense he did not believe defense contractors
were told directly that they couldn't have the documents.
   Carlucci said the documents Fowler is accused of taking were
among the ``most sensitive'' ones in the Pentagon outside of
intelligence documents.
   Lawyers for Fowler said Monday that their client did nothing
illegal and suggested he was being prosecuted because he refused to
name the Defense Department employees who gave him the documents.
   During opening arguments, defense lawyer John Bray said the
rules covering release of such documents ``are not clear, they are
not specific.''
   John Klein, an assistant U.S. attorney, told the jury Fowler
engaged in a conspiracy that included the ``unlawful acquisition,
conveyance, use, dissemination and destruction'' of classified
documents.
   Boeing pleaded guilty Nov. 13 to receiving classified documents
from Fowler and agreed to pay $5.2 million in fines and
restitution. In addition, Boeing chairman Frank Shrontz complied
with a judge's order to write a letter of contrition.
   The Air Force has suspended Boeing's 100-person Washington-area
office from bidding on contracts and has proposed a long-term
debarment of the branch office from contract bidding.

<HEAD>West German Mark Has Rallied on Eastern European Developments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sweeping political changes in Eastern Europe and
West Germany's own economic strength have boosted the West German
mark by nearly 4 percent over the past month, to its highest level
in nearly a year against the U.S. dollar.
   Analysts say the mark has strengthened amid speculation that
West Germany's central bank will raise interest rates to help curb
inflation, in anticipation that economic growth next year could be
faster than expected due to an influx of immigrants from East
Germany and Eastern Europe in general.
   The weekend resignation of East Germany's politburo propelled
the mark even higher against major foreign currencies.
   The mark has risen nearly 4 percent from early November when
East Germany opened the Berlin Wall and more than 14 percent from
the year's low of 2.0290 marks to the dollar on June 14.
   In Europe late Tuesday, the dollar was trading at 1.7790 marks,
compared with 1.8475 marks on Nov. 9.
   At first, the mark fell against the dollar on the dramatic news
that East Germany was opening the Berlin Wall and the rest of its
borders, because investors traditionally see the dollar as a safe
haven in times of political uncertainty.
   But the mark quickly recovered and started to climb.
   The influx of immigrants likely will boost growth in West
Germany's gross national product by up to half a percentage point
from earlier expectations, to 3 percent next year, said John
Calverley, a senior economist at American Express Bank Ltd. in
London.
   West Germany's gross national product this year was expected to
be up to 4 percent.
   ``The logic of it is you're going to have the immigrants of East
Germany and Eastern Europe coming to West Germany needing houses
and having demand for basic consumer goods,'' Calverley said.
   West Germany traditionally has pursued tight economic policies
to ensure low inflation, which is now running at an annual rate of
3 percent.
   The Bundesbank raised its benchmark interest rates by one
percentage point _ its fourth rate hike of the year _ on Oct. 5 and
other western European central banks followed suit the same day.
   The mark also has been strong because Germany's ``fundamentals''
are good. Economic growth is strong, inflation is under control,
and corporate profits are growing 15 percet this year on average,
said Rolf Schneider, head of the forecasting center at Dresdner
Bank in Frankfurt.
   Another factor in the mark's strength is that West Germany's
interest rates have been rising as American interest rates have
fallen, narrowing the differential, said Juergen Pfister, head of
economic research at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
   The mark's rise helps West Germany fight inflation by lowering
import prices, and boosts American exports to Europe, Calverley
said.
   But it likely will hurt West German exports, and that in turn
could slow the West German economy.
   ``German industry will becomes less competitive obviously from
the price point of view,'' said Dieter Wermuth, managing director
of Manufacturers Hanover Bank in Frankfurt.
   Export growth will fall to 8 percent next year from 14.5 percent
this year, Wermuth predicted.
   What also has helped the mark's rise against the dollar has been
weakness in the U.S. currency, in turn prompted by concerns about
the U.S. economic outlook. The mark also has risen strongly against
the yen and British pound, however.
   But some economists think the mark has moved too high and is due
for what traders call ``a downward correction,'' with investors
selling the currency to cash in the gains they have made during the
recent rally.
   Some experts also are skeptical that Eastern European consumer
buying will materialize or that the Bundesbank again will raise its
interest rates.
   But Schneider speculated that any retreat would be technical and
temporary.
   The mark already is considered the strongest currency in the
European Monetary System, which links nine of the 12 Common Market
currencies to prevent wide swings in their foreign exchange rates.
   The system is periodically realigned, and the mark's recent
strength increases the likelihood it will be revalued against the
other EMS currencies, a move Germany would welcome and France
likely would oppose, experts said.

   Stock prices fell today after a morning rally
fizzled amid profit-taking and investor confusion about the
direction of the economy, analysts said.
   Strength in the high technology sector helped pull the market
higher in early dealings after International Business Machines
Corp. announced a major restructuring. IBM said it planned a $4
billion share buyback, a cutback of 10,000 jobs and a
fourth-quarter charge of $2.3 billion.
   ``IBM is the highlight of the day,'' said Emmanuel Geronimous,
senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Takeover speculation also helped fuel early gains in other
blue-chip issues, including transportation stocks.
   But the blue-chip rally fizzled as the broader market lagged.
Stock prices retreated amid profit-taking as investors took
advantage of the market's recent gains, traders said.
   ``That's bound to happen. The market was going up with no real
conviction,'' said Charles Jensen, chief technical analyst for MKI
Securities Corp.
   Wall Street analysts said investor uncertainty about the economy
and interest rates remained in the background helping depress
prices ahead of Friday's report on November unemployment. Recent
economic data has pointed to a slowdown in economic growth.
   Observers say stock investors are hoping the unemployment data
confirms the slow-growth scenario and prompts the Federal Reserve
to take steps to lower interest rates to stimulate economic growth
and corporate earnings in 1990.

rose 0.26 cent to 64.05 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, adding to Monday's increase of 0.88 cent. Contracts for
delivery through April rose by 0.21 cent to 0.29 cent.
   Among other refined products traded on the New York Merc,
wholesale unleaded gasoline for January delivery closed 0.32 cent
higher at 52.84 after adding 0.41 cent on Monday. Later contracts
ended with similarly sized gains.
   The January contract for West Texas Intermediate, the main grade
of U.S. crude oil, rebounded 9 cents to close at $20.34 per
42-gallon barrel. On Monday the contract had fallen 5 cents. The
February through April contracts finished with slightly larger
increases.
   Energy analysts said there was no market-moving news and trading
volume was light to moderate. Traders continued to buy heating oil
on the assumption that cold weather around the United States and
shortages in Europe would boost demand.
   Analyst William Byers of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. said traders were
reluctant to establish significant new holdings ahead of the
American Petroleum Institute's weekly statistics, which were
released after the market closed.
   He said the API reported a surprisingly large buildup in crude
oil stocks but inventories of refined products were in line with
expectations.

<HEAD>Another Million Tons Authorized</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has been authorized to buy an additional
1 million metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, the
Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Acting Undersecretary John B. Campbell said the wheat will be
available to China under the department's Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to
36.7 bushels of wheat.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in
selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as subsidy.
   The subsidies have averaged from around $10 per ton, to more
than $40 per ton of wheat, or in the range of 27 cents to about
$1.10 per bushel.
   Campbell said 10,000 tons remained in the previous EEP
allocation for China announced last Feb. 27. That allocation was
for 2 million tons.
   China was the largest foreign buyer of U.S. wheat in the 1988-89
wheat marketing year that ended last May 31 with orders for nearly
8.1 million tons, all of it under the EEP program.
   Sales for 1989-90 total about 4.7 million tons, most of it
without subsidies.
   China is also the world's largest wheat producer this year with
an output estimated at 91 million tons. That compares with the
Soviet Union's harvest of 89 million tons this year and the U.S.
production of about 56 million tons.

<HEAD>Mellon Buys 54 PSFS Branches</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mellon Bank Corp., continuing its rebound
from hard financial times, said Tuesday it had agreed to pay buy 54
local branches of PSFS, the nation's oldest mutual savings bank.
   Meritor Savings Bank, which owns PSFS, is expected to get about
$335 million from Mellon for the branches. The move is the latest
in an asset-paring restructuring that Meritor started in 1987.
   The purchase will more than double Mellon's deposits in the
Philadelphia area to about $8.4 million, or 14.3 percent of the
market. CoreStates will lead the market with $8.99 million in
deposits upon completion of its purchase of First Pennsylvania,
expected in March.
   ``My guess is the Philadelphia market will go through more
consolidation. This puts us in a much more viable position,'' said
Frank V. Cahouet, chairman and chief executive of Mellon.
   Meritor's board approved the agreement at a meeting Monday,
Mellon officials said.
   Cahouet said the deal fits Mellon's strategy of increasing its
retail business. The Meritor branches will increase Mellon's retail
deposits by 36 percent to $19.588 billion.
   ``I'm glad to see Mellon thinks it's gotten out of the
turn-around, clean-up phase and is looking to expand,'' said
Kenneth F. Puglisi, a stock market analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &amp;
Woods.
   Last year, Mellon lost $65 million, or $3.65 per share. In 1987,
Mellon lost $844 million, or $31.19 per share, largely because of
provisions to cover bad loans to developing nations and the
slumping U.S. oil patch region.
   In the first nine months of this year, Mellon netted $204
million.
   Mellon said it expects to finance the purchase by issuing a
combination of common stock, preferred stock and debt in roughly
equal amounts. Cahouet said the bank is exploring its financing
options and the stock and debt issues are the most ``pessimistic or
conservative'' scenario.
   After the transaction is completed, Mellon's Philadelphia
subsidiary, Mellon Bank (East), plans to change its name to
``Mellon PSFS'' and plans to operate all its Philadelphia area
branches under that name, Mellon said.
   Mellon already has 66 branches in Philadelphia and suburban
counties. It will consider closing branches were there is
duplication but hasn't made any firm decisions, said Thomas F.
Donovan, chairman and chief executive of Mellon Bank (East).
   Donovan said normal attrition should cover any jobs lost in the
transaction. About 750 employees are expected to move from PSFS to
Mellon PSFS.
   ``We are constantly moving and shifting to see how best to
address the marketplace. It is very important to us to increase
market share in this area. Retail banking is very important to
Mellon,'' Cahouet said.
   The deal leaves Meritor with 29 branches, nearly all of them in
Philadelphia. The remaining branches will change their name to The
Philadelphia Savings Fund Society.
   Meritor, which hasn't seen an annual profit since 1986 and lost
$12.8 million in the third quarter of this year, has been paring
its operations in a restructuring effort that started in October
1987.
   Once the deal with Mellon is complete, Meritor's assets will
have dropped from a June 1987 high of $20.2 billion to about $8
billion, said Meritor spokesman Joseph M. Barrett.

   The dollar declined against most major
currencies Tuesday in quiet, featureless trading.
   Gold prices finished higher in the United States after falling
overseas. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a troy ounce of
gold bullion at $403.50 as of 4 p.m. EST, up from $401.20 late
Monday.
   Dealers said the foreign-exchange market was uninspired because
of a lack of news or new economic indicators after the recent surge
in the West German mark. They predicted little change for the rest
of this week.
   ``It's very much a holiday market,'' said Jeff Mondschein,
manager of foreign-exchange trading at Continental Illinois
National Bank &amp; Trust Co. in Chicago.
   Currency dealers overseas are said to be closing out trading
positions before the year end. Market volume tends to dry up toward
the end of the year, when dealers are hesitant to risk profits or
add to losses.
   Mondschein said traders are awaiting Friday's government report
on unemployment in November for an indication of U.S. economic
growth.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar finished at 143.68 Japanese yen, up from 143.48
yen on Monday. Later, in London, the dollar rose to 143.77 yen. By
the end of the trading day in New York, the dollar was quoted at
143.70 yen, up from 143.65 yen late Monday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.5715, more expensive for
buyers than late Monday's $1.5638. Later, in New York, a pound
fetched $1.5700, up from $1.5622 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.7775 West German marks, down from 1.7842; 1.5915
Swiss francs, down from 1.6065; 6.0670 French francs, down from
6.0915; 1,309.00 Italian lire, down from 1,314.50; and 1.1630
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1636.
   Dealers in Frankfurt said the mark should remain strong because
employment in West Germany in October reached 27.9 million, up
25,000 from September and the highest level in the republic's
40-year history.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.7790 West German marks, down from 1.7808; 1.5910
Swiss francs, down from 1.5995; 6.0675 French francs, down from
6.0800; 2.0100 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0095; 1,307.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,312.00; 1.1640 Canadian dollars, unchanged.
   Gold closed in London at a bid price of $404 a troy ounce, down
from $406.25 on Monday. The closing bid price in Zurich,
Switzerland, was $403.50, down from $408.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $402.95 bid, down from
$409.45.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery
closed at $403.50 a troy ounce, up from $401.10 late Monday.
   Silver closed in London at a bid price of $5.60 a troy ounce,
unchanged.
   On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery closed at
$5.533 a troy ounce, up from $5.509 late Monday.

<HEAD>Lack of Demand Sends Copper Lower</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices fell sharply Tuesday on New York's
Commodity Exchange as traders reacted to a downturn in demand for
the metal.
   In other markets, precious metal futures rebounded from Monday's
selloff, grain and soybeans futures were higher, while livestock
futures gained, hog futures closed mixed and energy futures climbed.
   Copper settled 1.35 cents to 2.40 cents lower with the contract
for delivery in December at $1.0620 a pound.
   Copper prices plunged at the opening bell and continued under
pressure throughout the day as traders failed to hold support
levels.
   Analyst Don Tierney of Stanley Bell &amp; Co. in New York said
consumption of copper is declining because of the softening
economic climate.
   Precious metal futures rebounded on the Comex as traders
operated on the belief that Monday's sharp decline was overdone,
Tierney said.
   Helping gold and silver prices was the weakening of the U.S.
dollar against the Swiss franc and the West German mark
   The advance also was helped by short-covering by European
investors who sold the market Monday.
   Gold was $2 to $2.40 higher with December at $403.50 a troy
ounce; silver was 2.4 cent to 3.5 cent higher wtih December at
$5.533 a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher in modest trading
on the Chicago Board of Trade as the market recovered some losses
sustained in the previous session.
   Corn futures led the trend upward in the aftermath of Monday's
U.S. Department of Agriculture weekly export inspections report,
which was higher than expected, said analyst Dale Gustafson of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   The inspections tally of 79 million bushels was well above trade
estimates for 67 million to 73 million. The inspections are an
indication of the amount of grain ready for export.
   Nearby wheat prices were lower, but the new crop futures gained
on reports that weather conditions in the winter wheat crop areas
continue on the dry side.
   Soybean futures trading continues sluggish, as a lack of export
sales dampens the market. Soybean prices also were pressured by
reports the weather in South America is favorable to soybean
development.
   Wheat was 1{ cent lower to 1{ cents higher with December at
$4.02{ a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 2{ cents higher with December
at $2.34{ cents a bushel; oats were a 1 cent to 2\ cents higher
with December at $1.44\ a bushel; soybeans were 2{ cents to 3{
cents higher with January at $5.75 cents a bushel.
   Livestock futures were higher and pork futures mixed on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Hog futures were lifted by firm cash prices, said analyst Tom
Morgan of Sterling Research Corp. in Arlington Heights, Ill. He
noted that pork bellies futures were pushed lower by concern over
the large levels of bellies moving into storage.
   Concern over a cold snap in the northern plains, which could
adversely affect feeding operations, helped to send livestock
futures higher, Morgan said.
   Prices also were helped by news the Soviet Union may be
interested in buying U.S. beef.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .35 cent higher with December at
75.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .35 cent higher
with January at 82.97 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .70 cent
higher with December at 51.22 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .22 cent to .70 cent lower with February at 55.15 cents a
pound.
   Energy futures were higher in moderate trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   There was little news to influence prices, and traders awaited
the release of American Petroleum Institute inventory figures, said
analyst Peter Beutel of Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
   API figures released after the close of trading, showed crude
oil stocks up 8.45 million barrels in the latest week and refined
product stocks up 2.89 million barrels.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 4 cents to 12 cents higher
with January at $20.34 cents a barrel; heating oil was .21 cent to
.29 cent higher with January at 64.05 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .28 cent to .44 cent higher with January at 52.84
cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Another Buyer Delays Purchase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Equimark Corp. Tuesday became the third
institution in recent weeks to delay previously announced buyouts
of insolvent Texas banks.
   Officials said they expect the deals still will go through, but
it's taking longer to put new values on the billions in dollars of
loans and other assets that have to be reviewed.
   Pittsburgh-based Equimark said it would be sometime in the next
three months before it completes its purchase of San Antonio-based
National Bancshares Corp. of Texas. Originally, the deal had been
expected to close by the end of the year.
   Last month, Deposit Guaranty Bank and Bank One Corp. both
announced delays in their takeovers of Texas American Banks and the
failed MCorp banks, respectively.
   In all three cases, the institutions said they had
underestimated the time needed to re-evaluate the insolvent banks'
holdings. The institutions say they are finding no additional
problems, and there is little chance the deals will have to be
renegotiated.
   David Barr, spokesman for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in
Washington, said, ``I don't think the problems are significant
enough that the deals will have to be restructured.
   ``Unexpected delays happen to arise,'' he said. ``We still
expect these deals to close. I'm not quite sure whether the FDIC
ever put a time frame on when we would like them to close.''
   Equimark announced July 21 it would buy National Bancshares,
putting up $31 million of its own money. The Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. pledged $250 million in assistance, another $86
million was to be raised privately and National Bancshares
shareholders will retain a 2 percent stake.
   The largest of the deals was Bank One Corp.'s June 28 agreement
to purchase the 20 failed former MCorp banks. The Ohio company said
it would ante up $500 million. FDIC Chairman William Seidman
estimated it would cost the government as much as $2 billion _ the
second costliest bank bailout in history.
   Bank One immediately took over management of the banks, naming
them Bank One Texas, and said it expected to close the purchase
within four to six months. On Nov. 9 the company said delays had
pushed the close until Jan. 17.
   Deposit Guaranty won its bid for Texas American Banks on July
20. The Dallas-based bank has raised $200 million to buy the banks
_ since renamed Team Bank _ and the government estimates it will
have to spend $900 million.
   Last week Deposit Guaranty said its closing also was delayed,
but would be completed at an unspecified date.
   Tuesday, Equimark Chairman Alan S. Fellheimer said, ``The
process of marking to current value all of the assets and
liabilities of NBC is very time consuming.''
   Michael E. Jehle, Equimark's chief financial officer, said
Equimark had found no additional problems in its review of the
bank, but the takeover had been complicated by the other
FDIC-assisted deals.
   ``All of them have a mark-to-market of billions and billions of
dollars (of assets) on very large banks all at the same time,'' he
said. ``It takes longer trying to do three at once.''
   Both Bank One and Deposit Guaranty cited similar problems.
   ``The problems are about the same level we expected,'' Deposit
Guaranty Chairman Ron Steinhart said Tuesday. ``It just takes
longer to get all the stuff down. ... when you were making loans in
36 different locations, with files in 36 different locations.''

   The stock market slumped Tuesday amid
profit-taking and ongoing investor uncertainty about the direction
of the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 11.95 points to
2,741.68.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 9 to 7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
831 issues down, 656 up and 506 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 154.64 million
shares, up from 150.36 million in the previous session.
   Strength in technology stocks revived a sagging market early in
the day after International Business Machines Corp. announced a
major restructuring. IBM said it planned a $4 billion share
buyback, a cutback of 10,000 jobs and a fourth-quarter charge of
$2.3 billion.
   But the market retreated just after midday, partly on
profit-taking as investors capitalized on recent gains. Wall Street
analysts said selling activity, like the buying activity that
preceded it, was concentrated in blue-chip issues while the broader
market languished.
   ``The market has had a nice little run. It got a little heavy so
it will trade off a little bit before it starts another run,'' said
W. Daniel Williams, equities analyst at Dillon Read &amp; Co.
   Tuesday's stock activity also was tinged with skepticism about
the outlook for the economy and corporate earnings, said Alfred E.
Goldman, equities analyst for A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   ``The market is in a very confused state and we have a tug o'
war going on,'' Goldman said.
   Investors on the one hand are bullish about the long-term
outlook for Eastern Europe and prospects that the Federal Reserve
will move to avoid a recession by lowering interest rates, Goldman
said.
   ``On the other side is a very unclear outlook for inflation and
corporate earnings,'' he said.
   Observers said investors were beginning to turn their attention
to Friday's November unemployment numbers, which could provide a
better indication of the economy's direction.
   Market participants are hoping the data confirms the slow-growth
scenario suggested by other recent economic reports, analysts said.
Further evidence of an economic slowdown could prompt the Federal
Reserve to lower interest rates, thereby stimulating economic
growth and corporate earnings in 1990.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 188.07 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $13.144 billion, or 0.39
percent, in value from Monday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
closed down 0.88 at 193.19.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, IBM rose ] to 99|,
Reebok advanced ~ to 18}, General Electric gained \ to 63] and
Alcoa added 1} to 75{. Hilton jumped 5{ to 99| amid speculation

moving up 2} to 182\ after Monday's news that investment group
Condor Partners raised its stake in United Airlines' parent to 11.8
percent and is holding talks with the company and its major unions.
   First Interstate Bancorp, the most active NYSE stock, fell { to
53\, Circle K lost 1 to 3{, Deere &amp; Co. slipped 2} to 56~ and
Philip Morris declined { to 42}.
   Among broader averages, Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell

<HEAD>Say Live Hog Trading Now Under Federal Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Suspected violations in live hog futures trading
at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are the latest focus of a
federal probe of the nation's largest commodities exchanges, a
newspaper reported Tuesday.
   Federal investigators have issued subpoenas to as many as seven
hog futures traders, the Chicago Sun-Times reported, citing
unidentified Merc members and attorneys.
   At least one of the traders had been questioned about suspected
trading violations that occurred as long ago as 1982, the newspaper
said.
   Ira Raphaelson, acting U.S. attorney, declined to comment
Tuesday on the report.
   Merc spokesman Andrew Yemma also declined comment.
   The federal investigation, which became known to the public in
January, initially focused on trading in the Merc's Japanese yen
and Swiss franc pits, and on trading in the soybean and U.S.
Treasury bond pits of the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The probe has so far resulted in the indictment of 47 traders
and one clerk. Of those, 14 people have pleaded guilty.
   Last week, in the first known expansion of the investigation out
of the four initial pits, at least nine traders in the Merc's
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 futures pit were subpoenaed to testify before
a federal grand jury.
   The live hog futures trading pit is the smallest of the pits so
far affected by the investigation. It draws only 40 or 50 traders
on a busy day _ less than a tenth as many as some of the more
active pits.

   International Business Machines Corp. announced
Tuesday it would cut another 10,000 U.S. jobs and repurchase $4
billion of its own stock in a two-pronged plan to reduce costs and
please shareholders.
   The world's biggest computer company also said it would set
aside $2.3 billion from its pre-tax profit to pay for the job cuts
and related steps. That will give IBM a net loss in the fourth
quarter and guarantee a decline in 1989 earnings compared to 1988.
   The company acknowledged that growth in its home market was
slower than expected as it announced its fourth job-cutting program
since 1986.
   IBM is being squeezed by sluggish spending by its customers,
increasing competition and the personal computer revolution, which
is cutting into sales of the big mainframes and minicomputers that
account for most of its profits.
   Unisys Corp. and Wang Laboratories Inc. are among the other
computer companies that have cut jobs this year. They, too, depend
heavily on larger computers for profits.
   John Akers, IBM's chairman and chief executive, told a roomful
of stock analysts Tuesday that the computer industry is ``under
stress _ some would say turmoil.''
   Cautious investors, burned by IBM's poor stock performance,
barely acknowledged the company's plan. The stock rose a slender
37{ cents a share to $99.62{ in New York Stock Exchange trading. It
rose $2.12{ a share Monday when speculation intensified that the
company planned job cuts.
   The stock remains far below its peak of $175.87{ in August 1987.
   IBM said it would reduce its staff without layoffs by limiting
hiring and offering incentives to employees to quit or retire.
   The company did not announce any closings of facilities and
Akers said no site closings were anticipated. However, some
operations at certain sites could be phased out.
   IBM expanded rapidly in the early 1980s but has been cutting
back since 1985, when it became apparent that the industry's rapid
15 percent annual growth was slowing.
   Tuesday's announcement was among the most dramatic measures yet
taken by the company to improve its profitability by cutting costs.
IBM said its growth overseas was strong, but the U.S. business
still was growing more slowly than desired.
   ``They have begun to face up to the realities of what the
outlook is for the U.S. market,'' said Barry Bosak, a Smith Barney,
Harris Upham &amp; Co. analyst. ``I think the ground rules changed
dramatically in the 1980s ... and the need to streamline
organizations is there.''
   The job cuts are intended to reduce the company's U.S. workforce
to 206,000 by the end of 1990, a reduction of more than 37,000 from
1985 levels. IBM had 387,000 employees worldwide at yearend 1988
and has been cutting jobs abroad as well.
   Akers said IBM intended to continue a no-layoff tradition that
has lasted more than 40 years because it helps the company maintain
a high-quality, flexible and dedicated workforce.
   He added, ``It's impossible to guarantee for all time full
employment under any and all circumstances.''
   Several analysts agreed that layoffs would be cheaper but would
damage morale.
   IBM said its $4 billion stock buyback, if completed, would bring
total repurchases since mid-1986 to more than $10.5 billion.
   The repurchase amounts to about 15 percent of the shares
outstanding in 1986 and is possibly the biggest buyback program
ever undertaken. General Electric Co. last month announced plans to
repurchase up to $10 billion of its stock over five years, the
largest program ever in a single announcement.
   A stock repurchase pleases investors because by taking shares
off the market it makes the remaining ones more valuable. It also
signals that the company is confident about its own stock.
   IBM's $2.3 billion pre-tax charge against fourth-quarter
earnings breaks down as follows:
   _$500 million for separation payments to people leaving the
company.
   _$500 million for accounting changes to recognize the shorter
useful life of IBM's investments in software and technology. The
shorter life is good because it shows the company has accelerated
its schedule of introducing new products.
   _$1.3 billion for restructuring, including consolidations,
capacity reductions and cuts in the valuation of special
investments such as share ownership in other companies.

<HEAD>Predicts Profits But No Immediate End to Bankruptcy Refuge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHEELING, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. probably
will remain profitable despite a downturn in the steel industry
next year, but there's no immediate end in sight to the company's
federal bankruptcy status, shareholders were told Tuesday.
   James L. Wareham, Wheeling-Pitt president and chief operating
officer, blamed the expected downturn on lower steel prices
throughout the industry.
   ``Industry analysts have different views of how deep the
downturn will be and how long it will last,'' Wareham said during
the company's annual stockholders meeting. ``We forecast a
relatively short down cycle.''
   William J. Scharffenberger, Wheeling-Pitt board chairman and
chief executive officer, said legal constraints would prevent the
steelmaker from emerging from U.S. Bankruptcy Court protection
before June 1990. The company filed for Chapter 11 protection on
April 16, 1985.
   Scharffenberger said several major factors remain to be settled,
including a new labor agreement with the United Steelworkers of
America, which he predicted will be forthcoming by January.
   Scharffenberger and Wareham refused to comment on the labor
negotiations, which continued Tuesday in Pittsburgh.
   Union officials have said previously that they are interested in
regaining some of the concessions made in the 1982 and 1985
contracts.
   Despite the expected downturn, Wareham said the company intends
to go ahead with about $100 million in improvements next year,
including clean air projects at Martins Ferry, Ohio, clean water
projects and upgrading of the 80-inch hot strip mill in
Steubenville, Ohio, and an automatic gauge control at Allenport, Pa.

<DATELINE>CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. has agreed
to pay $65,000 to Nevada and restrict its dealings in the state as
part of its guilty plea to federal counts of securities and mail
fraud.
   Sherwood Cook, deputy secretary of state for securities
regulation, said Tuesday the agreement will result in his office
dismissing its complaint that sought to revoke or suspend Drexel's
broker-dealer license in Nevada.
   Nevada moved against Drexel after the federal Securities and
Exchange Commission and Justice Department alleged the fraud.
Drexel pleaded guilty to six felony counts of securities and mail
fraud and agreed to pay $650 million in fines and restitution.
   Under terms of the agreement with the Nevada Securities
Division, Drexel agreed to pay $65,000 to the division and restrict
its business in the state until certain conditions have been met.
   Cook said Drexel also agreed to an independent consultant to
review its compliance with state securities law and regulations$
   In addition, he said, the company agreed to comply with terms of
the SEC injunction and agreement, and to cooperate with the state
in identifying any residents who may have suffered damages as a
result of Drexel's actions.

<HEAD>Georgia-Pacific Extends Offer To Buy Great Northern Until Dec. 11</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS last graf with 4 grafs to UPDATE with Great Northern filing
court papers seeking to block Georgia-Pacific's court moves.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Georgia-Pacific Corp. extended its $3.6 billion
offer to buy rival paper-maker Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. for one
week Tuesday, but officials of the target remained opposed to the
deal.
   The $63-a-share bid, originally set to expire at midnight EST
Monday, was extended by Georgia-Pacific until midnight Dec. 11.
   ``We feel, as we announced previously, that consummation of the
merger ... would violate applicable antitrust laws,'' said Great
Northern spokesman Stephen Hill.
   Officials of Norwalk, Conn.-based Great Northern have refused to
discuss the proposed merger with Georgia-Pacific, though the
chairman of the Atlanta company said Great Northern shareholders
already have indicated they favor the takeover.
   Georgia-Pacific Chairman T. Marshall Hahn said 32.3 million
shares of Great Northern stock already have been tendered since his
company made the takeover bid, representing nearly 59 percent of
total shares outstanding.
   ``That is a very substantial percentage, and we believe the
shareholders are sending the clear message to Great Northern's
board and management that they want our offer to be accepted,''
Hahn said.
   Hill said Great Northern did not view the tender in the same
light. ``As you know, people could withdraw that at any time,'' he
said.
   Great Northern stock was up 25 cents a share to $61.62{ in early
New York Stock Exchange trading Tuesday.
   Chad E. Brown, an industry analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. in New York, said Georgia-Pacific had no choice at this time
but to extend the offer.
   He noted that a number of matters _ Justice Department
clearance, a legal challenge to Maine's corporate takeover statute
and a challenge to Great Northern's anti-takeover provisions _ must
be resolved before Georgia-Pacific can proceed with the proposed
acquisition.
   ``Certain conditions hadn't been met,'' Brown said. ``The choice
was to withdraw and let it (the offer) expire. And that's not a
choice.''
   He said it is possible that the offer will be extended again
Dec. 11.
   Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific raised its offer from $58 a share
to $63 Nov. 19 after Great Northern's board rejected the original
Oct. 31 offer.
   Georgia-Pacific, meanwhile, filed a motion late Monday in U.S.
District Court in Portland, Maine, asking for a ruling in its
lawsuit challenging the ``poison pill'' anti-takeover provisions of
Great Northern's bylaws. Great Northern is incorporated in Maine.
   Georgia-Pacific said the poison pill violates the Maine Business
Corporation Act because it lets owners of stock in takeover targets
_ except for the hostile suitor _ buy moreshares at a 50 percent
discount.
   Great Northern filed an objection Tuesday to Georgia-Pacific's
request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary
injunction.
   Georgia-Pacific wants to stop Great Northern from changing its
financial structure to make itself more difficult to acquire,
unless it provides 72 hours notice, and also wants to move up a
shareholders meeting from March to within 30 days so shareholders
can vote quickly on the tender offer.
   Great Northern says Georgia-Pacific has shown no good reason to
move the meeting up, and it has said the 72-hour notice would not
give its directors enough flexibility to manage the company's
affairs.
   Great Northern had sales of $3.6 billion in 1988 from its paper
pulp, box, lumber and plywood operations. Georgia-Pacific had $9.5
billion in sales.

   Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. has raised the
commission it charges most individual customers by about 3 percent,
a spokesman said Tuesday.
   Prudential-Bache also said it has informed its 6,500 brokers it
was reducing the amount of commission revenue it shares with its
lowest-producing brokers.
   The moves are the latest cost-cutting measures by a Wall Street
firm during a sharp downturn in brokerage and investment banking
activity. Other firms have laid off workers and reduced commissions
paid to stockbrokers.
   Prudential-Bache said it did not expect the increased commission
charges to deter investors and said they were necessary because of
rising costs.
   Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in September raised retail and
institutional commission rates by about 4 percent.
   While it did not increase customer rates, Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. last month said it would cut stockbrokers' commissions by 1 to
2 percentage points in 1990.

<HEAD>Dollar Firm, Stock Prices Fall in Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar remained firm in early trading
against the Japanese yen Wednesday morning, while share prices on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell moderately.
   The dollar started trading at 143.72 yen, up 0.04 yen from
Tuesday's close here of 143.68 yen. It hardly budged from it close
of 143.73 yen overnight in New York.
   A dealer with the Bank of Tokyo said the dollar-yen exchange
rate remained in a narrow range because of a lack of fresh
market-affecting news.
   Many market players are awaiting the release of U.S.
unemployment figures for November, due out Friday in Washington,
said the dealer, who spoke anonymously.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which gained 190.30 points for a new high Tuesday, shed
139.15 points, or 0.37 percent, shortly after the market opened to
move to 37,355.02.

<HEAD>Analyst: Investors Wary of New UAL Buyout Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investors are reacting cautiously to reports that
the management of UAL Corp. has put together a revised employee
buyout plan for the parent of United Airlines, an analyst said
Tuesday.
   The caution is indicated by the failure of UAL stock to make the
huge leaps in value that characterized the stock shortly after
California investor Marvin Davis announced earlier this year he was
interested in acquiring UAL.
   Davis' $275-a-share, $6.19 billion offer for UAL was later
followed by one from a pilot-management group, which made a
$300-a-share, $6.75 billion.
   UAL stock was trading at a 52-week high of $294 a share in
October, when it appeared the pilot-management group's offer seemed
close to success.
   Samuel Buttrick, an analyst with Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. in New
York, said UAL stock has been on a roller coaster since the
collapse of the pilot-management buyout offer.
   UAL stock lost 40 percent of its value with the bid's collapse,
at one point trading around $145 a share, Buttrick said. UAL stock
closed Monday at $182.25 a share, up $2.75, in consolidated New
York Stock Exchange trading.
   ``It has been a very rocky road for UAL stock,'' Buttrick said,
noting its price rose when Coniston Partners announced its 9.7
percent stake in UAL, then fell as speculators became impatient
with the lack of positive news on a new management bid.
   Coniston Partners, a New York investment group, has threatened a
drive to oust 13 of UAL's 15 directors and create a five-member
board dominated by Coniston if the company's board fails to sell or
restructure UAL.
   UAL stock climbed $5.25 on Monday, following Coniston's
announcement it had increased its stake in the company to 11.8
percent and after reports of a revised employee buyout proposal
were circulated over the weekend.
   Analysts believe the board's buyout plan will value the company
at $210 to $240 a share, or a total of $4.75 billion to $5.42
billion.
   Buttrick said the rise in UAL stock price reflects a
confirmation of what everybody suspected was going on behind the
scenes.
   ``The answer as to why the price hasn't gone higher is that
there isn't a confirmed deal,'' he said.
   Bobbie Pilkington, a spokeswoman for the United chapter of the
Association of Flight Attendants, said Tuesday that a revised
buyout plan will be presented to the union on Wednesday.
   The session was to have been the start of a new round of
contract talks between the union and the airline. The flight
attendants have been working without a contract for two years.
   UAL management is believed to be seeking ironclad commitments
from lenders and the company's three major unions before publicly
announcing a revised buyout effort.
   The previous buyout attempt was led by United's management,
pilots and British Airways PLC. That bid failed in October when
lenders refused to finance it, citing the strong opposition of the
Machinists.
   Telephone calls to Machinist union headquarters for comment on
the revised buyout effort were not returned Tuesday.
   United pilots have long sought ownership of the carrier, the
nation's second-largest, and are believed to be working with
management on the new proposal.
   Spokeswoman Kathie Hardin of the United chapter of the Air Line
Pilots Association declined to comment Tuesday.

<HEAD>Du Pont Extortion Trial Begins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attorney for a man accused of
masterminding a $10 million extortion scheme against Du Pont Co.
denied Tuesday that his client attempted to sell trade secrets for
Lycra fabric back to the chemical giant.
   Richard Zappa, co-counsel for Bruno Skerianz, said in opening
arguments in Skerianz' U.S. District Court trial that Du Pont first
approached Skerianz about documents allegedly taken from the
company's Lycra plant in Mercedes, Argentina.
   Lycra is a spandex fiber used in clothing such as swimming suits
and leotards. Du Pont says it sold about $600 million of Lycra last
year.
   Skerianz, Raul Armando Giordano and Antonio Ruben Inigo are
charged with attempted extortion and conspiracy. If convicted, they
face up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   Zappa said Wilmington-based Du Pont wanted to eliminate
competition by entrapment; otherwise, it would have charged the
defendants with theft of the documents.
   He accused Du Pont of making the FBI and the U.S. attorney's
office its private police force to make an example of the
defendants to ward off anyone planning to compete in the spandex
market.
   Zappa said Skerianz could not be accused of extortion because he
never asked Du Pont for money. Instead, the company offered to pay
$10 million to get the documents back, according to Zappa.
   In his opening arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Edmond
Falgowski reviewed the scenario that led up to the arrests in
February.
   Falgowski said Skerianz would have sold the documents to a Du
Pont competitor had the company not agreed to pay.
   ``Unless Du Pont paid $10 million for its own technology, they
would sell trade secrets to competitors,'' Falgowski said.
   The three defendants are Argentine nationals and former
employees at the Mercedes plant. A fourth former employee, Jose
Maria Petrosino, is fighting extradition from Geneva, Switzerland.
   Maria I. Lorenzo de Bianchini, also a former employee, has
agreed to testify for the government in exchange for charges being
dropped against her.
   Girodano was a superintedent of Lycra operations and Inigo was a
maintenance supervisor at the plant. They had quit their jobs up to
three months before Du Pont was contacted about the documents in
December 1988.
   De Bianchini was a secretary in the Lycra information office.
She quit her job about the same time.
   All but Petrosino were arrested in Geneva in February when an
attempt to meet Du Pont officials to turn over the documents and
get the $10 million was aborted.

<HEAD>Newest French Train Sets World Rail Speed Record _ 299 Mph</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOURS, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The newest generation of France's
high-speed passenger trains established a world rail speed record
Tuesday when it topped out at 299.7 mph while racing through the
Loire Valley, the French national railroad said.
   The record-breaking TGV locomotive comprised two bullet-nosed
engines pulling four cars, down from the usual 10 cars, the Societe
Nationale des Chemins de Fer said.
   The train, which carried no passengers, broke the record of 253
mph set in May 1988 by an Inter-City Experimental locomotive in
West Germany.
   Tuesday's record was set on a section of track in the Loire, a
famed wine-growing region, that is due to come into service next
year with the TGV Atlantic service linking northwestern French
cities with the high-speed train.
   Normal top speed for the TGV Atlantic is 186 mph along specially
constructed track.
   Premier Michel Rocard inaugurated the first phase of the TGV
Atlantic service Sept. 20. The trains carry passengers between 12
cities in northwestern France and are due to expand south to the
Spanish border next September.
   The blue-and-silver trains represent the second generation of
the TGV service, which opened between Paris and the French Riviera
in 1981. The new trains are faster, ride more smoothly and are
equipped with telephones for business travelers.
