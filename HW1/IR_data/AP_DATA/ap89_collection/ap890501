   Annie Ackerman, 75, the powerful
political activist whose support was courted by candidates ranging
from condominum board members to a president, died Monday of cancer.
   Ms. Ackerman political activism included volunteer work for the
campaigns of the late Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago and
accelerated when she moved to a waterfront Florida condominium in
1969.
   Ms. Ackerman successfully roused retirees from political apathy
and mobilized them into powerful voting blocs. Famed for turnouts
ranging past 90 percent, they were dubbed ``condo commandos.''
   Her political friends included President Jimmy Carter, fellow
Democrats Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis, and nearly every
well-known Democratic politician in Florida.

   John Boyd, who fought off leftists to lead the
powerful British union of engineering workers, died Sunday. He was
71. A cause of death was not available.
   Boyd started his career as an engineering worker but began work
as a trade union organizer in 1946. He stepped up to the presidency
of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions in 1964.
   Boyd spent years fighting communists and left-wing elements for
control of the 1.5 million-member Amalgamated Union of Engineering
Workers. From 1975 to 1982, he served as general secretary of the
union, which is one of the largest in Britain.
   From 1967 to 1975, Boyd sat on the general council of the Trades
Union Congress, the national organization of unions. Boyd was a
director of the British Steel Corp. from 1981-86.
   A chairman of the Labor Party in 1967, he was knighted in 1979.

   A federal judge Monday struck down
Illinois' death penalty law, raising doubts about the fate of 121
prisoners on the state's Death Row, including serial killer John W.
Gacy.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Baker ruled that the 1977 law gives
prosecutors too much discretion in deciding when to seek the death
penalty, violating U.S. Supreme Court directives that capital
punishment not be imposed in an ``arbitrary and capricious'' manner.
   If sustained on appeal, the decision would invalidate the
sentences of the 121 men currently facing the death penalty in
Illinois. They include Gacy, convicted in 1980 of killing 33 young
men and boys in the worst multiple-killing case in U.S. history.
   Prosecutors said they were confident the ruling would be
overturned by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago.
   No one has been executed under the state's death penalty law,
which was upheld by the state Supreme Court in 1979.
   Judges threw out three earlier death sentences that emerged
through the appeals process in federal court, but Monday's ruling
was the first to address the constitutionality of the law.
   ``I think we knew that in some case, a (federal) judge would
rule specifically on the statute,'' said Theodore Gottfried, head
of the state appellate defender's office, which handles appeals for
death row inmates. ``We didn't know which case it would be.''
   First Assistant Attorney General Michael Ficaro defended the
death penalty law.
   ``The Illinois Supreme Court has dealt with that issue over 60
times,'' Ficaro said. ``We believe the statute is constitutional.''
   Jay Miller, director of the state's American Civil Liberties
Union chapter, said, ``We're delighted with any decision that finds
any death penalty law unconstitutional.
   ``We think they're all unconstitutional,'' Miller said. ``I
don't think there's any way to write a death penalty law that's
constitutional.''
   Legal experts agreed a ruling by the federal appelate court is
virtually a certainty. Should the U.S. Supreme Court decline to
review that ruling, it would in effect become the last word on the
law's validity.
   Baker's ruling came in the case of a double killer, Charles
Silagy, who demanded the death penalty after being convicted in
1980 of a double killing in Vermilion County.
   Silagy, who has been on death row since August 1980, had his
sentence appealed twice to the state Supreme Court and once to the
U.S. Supreme Court, but was unsuccessful until his case reached
Baker in one of the last stages of the death-penalty appeals
process.
   The state's capital punishment law allows a trial court to
consider a death sentence in certain circumstances, such as a
multiple killing, when requested by the prosecution.
   The state Supreme Court upheld the law in 4-3 ruling in 1979.
Dissenting Justice Howard C. Ryan, whose opinion was cited by
Baker, wrote:
   ``Our statute contains no directions or guidelines to minimize
the risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action by the
prosecutor in either requesting or in not requesting a (death
sentence) hearing.''

   The government began a new effort
Monday to rally NATO allies behind its proposal for superpower
talks on reducing short-range nuclear weapons, which has caused a
dispute with the United States and Britain.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher was quoted as saying
West Germany's argument must have ``special weight'' because it is
the alliance's front line, and a war with such battlefield-range
weapons would be fought on its territory.
   Both the United States and Britain say the negotiations proposed
by Chancellor Helmut Kohl might endanger Western security.
   The New York Times reported Tuesday that the elements of a
compromise have begun to emerge with a U.S. proposal submitted to
NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.
   Quoting unidentified diplomats from several nations, the
newspaper said Washington proposed Wednesday that the alliance
decide to upgrade the weapons and then announce unilateral
reductions. NATO would then challenge the Soviets to make cuts to
the lower levels.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Monday that the United States remains committed to a mixture of
NATO conventional and nuclear forces, called flexible response, as
a deterrent to attack.
   ``The West German position demonstrates the special strength
that NATO has,'' Fitzwater said. ``Our allies can debate quite
vigorously these issues, yet maintain the basic strength of our
unity.
   ``Our position remains that keeping the peace requires a strong
NATO alliance and a policy of flexible response.''
   Genscher's remarks were the first official West German comment
since a meeting Sunday in which Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of
Britain tried, but failed, to change Kohl's mind on the issue.
   In pursuit of support for the West German position, Kohl plans
to visit Rome on Tuesday and Genscher will go to Paris.
   Italy has said it agrees with West Germany that negotiations on
the short-range weapons should begin, but France has not made its
position clear. West Germany claims the support of seven of the 16
North Atlantic Treaty Orgnization members.
   In an interview with the Frankfurter Rundschau, Genscher was
quoted as saying: ``This is not a new demand that has only now been
made by us and other alliance partners. This concerns putting into
effect an intention which has already been stated in two alliance
decisions.''
   His ministry made copies of the interview available to other
news organizations before publication in the paper's Tuesday
editions.
   Genscher has noted previously the NATO decision at summits in
1987 and 1988 that negotiations on short-range nuclear weapons
should be held at some point. The United States and Britain say
this is not the time.
   ``Naturally the German view must have a special weight because
the Lance rockets are on our soil and because our army represents
the largest conventional contribution (in West Germany) to the
common Western security,'' Genscher said.
   West Germany's army has about 500,000 soldiers. Most of the
alliance's short-range Lance rockets are on its territory and would
be used there in a war.
   Kohl and Genscher say NATO should not pass up opportunities to
negotiate in important areas of disarmament, and they insist the
time is right for taking up the battlefield-range weapons. The
chancellor has said he wants the talks to begin ``soon,'' but has
not proposed a timetable.
   A West German government official said privately Monday the
chancellor was ``optimistic'' about a compromise.
   U.S. and British officials say starting negotiations now could
lead to elimination of the short-range weapons and increase the
threat from the Soviet bloc's superior conventional forces.
   After the meeting with Mrs. Thatcher on Sunday, Kohl said he
does not favor pulling the Lance missiles out of West Germany
``under the present circumstances.''
   Gen. John Galvin, the American who commands NATO forces in
Europe, was quoted as saying he did not believe there was
disagreement on strategy within the alliance.
   In an interview for publication Tuesday, the newspaper Die Welt
quoted Galvin as saying: ``Recent statements make it very clear
that there are no differences in the grand strategy. The importance
of nuclear deterrence is recognized.''

<HEAD>Political Aide's Suicide Spotlights Japan's Money Politics</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN MOFFAT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the prime minister's political secretary
committed suicide, many saw him as a victim of the money politics
entwined with Japanese culture and tradition.
   Beside such Western-style institutions as a parliament and free
elections, Japan has customs that demand exchanges of gifts and
favors and lingering ideals of absolute loyalty.
   Japanese politicians spend campaign money in a very personal
manner.
   Voters expect their representatives not only to bring
pork-barrel projects to the district, but to help their children
find jobs in Tokyo, attend weddings and send donations to funerals.
Political secretaries spend much of their time going to family
ceremonies and delivering obligatory gifts.
   Results of a survey published in the newspaper Asahi said a
legislator or his representative attends, on average, 26.5 funerals
a month.
   Ihei Aoki, for three decades Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's
closest aide, may have killed himself Wednesday because more than
$1 million in donations and loans he received from the Recruit Co.
helped bring down his boss, who had announced the day before he
would resign.
   ``The tragic case of Aoki's suicide pathetically calls for a
drastic reform of the money-oriented structure of politics,'' the
daily Yomiuri said in an editorial.
   Asahi said political aides ``function as `cloaks' that cover up
foul play.'' Of 13 politicians linked to the Recruit scandal, it
noted, six took donations in aides' names rather than their own.
   Political secretaries, who would be called legislative
assistants in the United States, carry a burden imposed by the
money-driven election system. Most spend hardly any time drafting
legislation, a job generally handled by bureaucrats.
   Aoki's main task as secretary to a top leader was ``to raise
money from big business and distribute it to legislators,'' said
Kotaru Nogami, chief political editor of the Kyodo News Service.
   Secretaries of legislators, in turn, pass some of the largesse
on to their districts.
   ``Basically, a secretary does everything and anything he is told
to do and he has to carry out any order to perfection, even though
specific guidelines are not given,'' said Chris Redl of Phoenix,
Ariz., a political secretary to a legislator of the governing
Liberal Democratic Party.
   When he began working in Japan, Redl said, he was surprised to
see aides in funny costumes dancing to entertain constituents at a
local festival.
   He said he was exhausted by the dawn-to-2-a.m. schedule of
courtesy calls and parties with supporters in the Hokkaido district
of his legislator, Shizuo Sato.
   ``I talked to another secretary who had to do this all the
time,'' the American said. ``He told me, `It's like the old days.
You have to be ready to die for your shogun.'''
   When Aoki killed himself, many people were reminded of the
suicide in 1976 of former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka's driver,
who had carried payoff money in the Lockheed scandal. Tanaka
eventually was convicted on a bribery charge.
   ``After the Lockheed scandal there was a lot of discussion of
political reform, but it was never carried out,'' Nogami said.
   A partial reform limited donations, but the Recruit case
revealed ways around it: buying many tickets to fund-raising
parties and selling shares at bargain prices before offering them
for public sale.
   Recruit was limited to contributing $115,000 a year to all
politicians. In three years, however, Takeshita alone got more than
$1.5 million from the company in donations, stock-sale profits,
loans and proceeds from ticket purchases. All of it went through
Aoki's hands.
   Such huge sums of money are needed, in part, because taxes cover
only a fraction of what it costs to run the parliament.
   ``The Recruit scandal was born of the system,'' said Sato, 47,
the young American's boss. He is a member of the governing party's
cmmittee on reform and wants more government funds so legislators
will be less dependent on contributions.
   In the tiny office the government provides, he told an
interviewer: ``The budget from the government allows for only two
aides. I have 15.''
   His monthly travel allowance of $500 covers just a quarter of
what he spends visiting his constituency.
   Sato depends on a patron, former Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone, for political funds, and in return backs Nakasone in
intra-party maneuvers.
   Patrons like Nakasone or Takeshita lead Liberal Democratic
factions that operate almost as separate parties, particularly in
raising money.
   Explaining how Japanese politicians spend campaign funds in
their districts, Sato said: ``It's different from America. A simple
television ad won't get votes. It's a matter of obligation and
human feelings.''
   Americans might see the exchanges of favors and money as graft
or vote-buying, but in Japan they generally are considered social
custom.
   Contributions by Recruit were at the top level of an
interlocking system of gifts and obligations stretching down to
ordinary citizens.
   Some Japanese say they don't mind politicians collecting large
amounts of money because they usually recirculate it rather than
enriching themselves.
   Giving gift envelopes of cash at weddings, funerals and bon
voyage parties, even between parents and children at the New Year,
is a matter of etiquette in Japan.
   A parliamentary survey indicated young legislators spent an
average of $274,000 a year on cash gifts for funerals, weddings,
community festivals and local clubs.
   ``When a politician gives money at a funeral, it's not because
he's a politician but because it's a matter of Japanese custom,''
Sato said. ``Now it may be necessary for us to distance ourselves
from Japanese habits.''
   Among reforms an advisory group suggested to Takeshita last week
was prohibiting parliament members from giving money at weddings
and funerals.

   It was quiet last week in
Northern Ireland, by the standards of a province in its 20th year
of ``the troubles.''
   A few children and elderly people were terrified by a mortar
attack on a police station, and police shot up a car, but there
were no additions to the 2,000-plus deaths caused by sectarian
violence since 1969.
   There were several attacks on police stations. Charges were
filed against alleged members of the Irish Republican Army, which
is largely Roman Catholic and fighting to unite Ireland, and the
Ulster Volunteer Force, which is Protestant and wants to keep the
province British.
   These are the stories of a quiet week:
   SUNDAY:
   Masked gunmen crash a house party in Londonderry at 2:30 a.m.
and fire four shots. Police say the homeowner was held with one gun
in his mouth and another to his head while being interrogated about
a guest who already had left. No one is injured and no group claims
responsibility.
   A 36-year-old woman is hit in the head as automatic gunfire
sprayed the Royal Ulster Constabulary's station at Clogher in the
western part of the province. She survives and there are no
injuries to police, who attribute the late-night attack to the IRA.
   MONDAY:
   IRA commandos fire three mortar rounds at the Ballynafeigh
police station in south Belfast as children walk to school. Elderly
residents are evacuated from their homes, past a can in which a
bomb explodes minutes later. No one is injured.
   A van used in the attack is stolen from Francis McCusker, who is
held captive by gunmen, along with his wife, Maureen, and two
children, for three hours during the attack.
   TUESDAY:
   A funeral is held for taxi driver William Thompson, 26, who was
shot to death the previous Friday night. The IRA claims Thompson
had been involved in sectarian killings.
   In Armagh, Dermot Carroll, 26, and Niall Carroll, 22, are
charged with setting off a homemade 50-pound bomb the previous
Friday while a British Army patrol was nearby.
   An 18-year-old man from west Belfast is shot in both ankles and
knees. Police say it appears to be a punishment shooting, the IRA's
way of dealing with people in the Catholic community whom it
considers criminals.
   The chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary agrees to
pay a ``four-figure'' settlement to a Catholic councilman from
Londonderry who claimed he was repeatedly assaulted while detained
in 1977.
   WEDNESDAY:
   Bombs explode at the Springfield Road police station and North
Howard Street army post, and shots are fired at security force
patrols in three other areas of Belfast. No casualties are reported.
   Alex Atwood, a member of the Belfast city council from the
Social Democratic and Labor Party, the largest Catholic political
party, says army tactics are creating tension in west Belfast.
``People talking to neighbors or passing the time of day on their
own doorstep have been treated with contempt by some patrol members
and subjected to verbal abuse.'' An army spokesman promises an
investigation.
   The McCuskers are charged with withholding information about
their stolen van.
   THURSDAY:
   The McCuskers are released on bail.
   FRIDAY:
   Police fire 30 shots at a stolen car that allegedly is driven
through a checkpoint in west Belfast at 1 a.m. Two occupants are
seriously injured. Councilor Alex Attwood of the SDLP says he fears
the incident reflects ``this hostility where people shoot first and
ask questions afterwards.''
   Ann Bernadette Cavanagh, 29, of Londonderry, appears in court on
charges of attempted murder of a police officer and possession of
grenades, guns and explosives.
   James Branagh, 45, of Ardoyne, is sentenced to five years in
prison after being convicted of membership in the IRA and
possessing a nail bomb and documents useful to terrorists.
Prosecutors say Branagh would leave his back door unlocked, knowing
the IRA was using his home to store weapons.
   A 25-year-old man is shot in a knee and both ankles in Belfast.
   SATURDAY:
   Police seize a suspected IRA arms cache, including a Soviet-made
flame thrower, in a woodland west of Londonderry.
   A 14-year-old east Belfast girl appears in court on charges of
stealing a semiautomatic Beretta shotgun and 174 cartridges. A
detective says the girl claimed, ``I only did it because I was
under threat.''

   First lady Barbara Bush has puppy love written
all over her face.
   Puppy love times six, that is.
   That's how many puppies first dog Millie gave birth to about a
month ago.
   ``I have not named the puppies,'' Mrs. Bush writes in a cover
story in this month's Life magazine. ``I know them intimately, but
I don't want to give them names and get attached because I want
everyone who gets one to name his or her puppy.''
   The English springer spaniel is a dog without bad habits, the
first lady notes.
   ``I never had a girl dog before. I had boy dogs all my married
life. George loves Millie, but she is attached to me,'' Mrs. Bush
says. ``She gets White House table scraps when the president slips
them to her. He gives her showers _ how else do you wash your dog?
Every week or two, we climb right in the shower with our dog.''
   Clean or not, there won't be any more puppies during the Bush
tenure at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.
   ``She won't have any more puppies, not because of her age (she's
only 3), but because I think you can ask a household to do this
only once. I would like more if I lived privately,'' Mrs. Bush said.

   The smell of marijuana wafted through the air,
and plenty of iced beer was on hand as about 2,000 people lined up
to buy tickets for The Who's reunion concert.
   During the weekend, some of the fans huddled under small tents,
braved rain and chilly temperatures outside Radio City Music Hall
for a shot at the tickets, priced from $75 to $2,000.
   Amy Yankowitz, a Manhattan legal secretary, claimed the first
spot in line by getting there Friday night. She slept through rain
showers, chased scalpers away from her spot and then learned that
the tickets were going to be issued by lottery.
   Promoters allowed those in line to draw a bracelet from a box.
The bracelets, numbered from one to 500, allowed the bearer to
return this morning and claim a place in line according to the
number drawn. Each person is limited to two tickets.
   The British rock band will be performing its rock opera
``Tommy'' in its entirety for the first time in 17 years.
   ``Is it worth it? Yeah, I worship this band!'' said Yankowitz,
who saw The Who perform at Shea Stadium in the group's farewell
tour in 1982.

his country roots in his latest album.
   ``Most folks are afraid, I think, after you've had some pop and

   The Robbinsville, N.C., native, who has been blind since birth,
said he was exposed to classical music at a Raleigh school.
   ``I was taught to play and to listen to and to observe all kinds
of things _ then I came to Nashville and they say you can only be
one thing,'' he said.
   ``There's all kinds of albums that I see in my future if we're
able to make them happen.''
   The new album, ``Stranger Things Have Happened,'' has already
yielded two hits, including ``Don't You Ever Get Tired of Hurting
Me,'' and ``Houston Solution.''
   Milsap's other hits include ``Stranger In My House'' and ``I'm a
Stand By My Woman Man.''

   Horsemen in armor, monks in brown robes
and four musketeers gathered near the Rio Grande to commemorate
what they say was the United States' first Thanksgiving
celebration, in 1598.
   The group took a step Sunday toward revising history with a
re-enactment of the fiesta held April 30, 1598 _ 23 years before
the Pilgrims celebrated in Massachusetts.
   While the 400 settlers led by Spanish aristocrat Juan de Onate
were celebrating, the Pilgrims were still in Europe, dreaming of a
place where they could worship freely.
   The El Paso Mission Trail Association sponsored the
re-enactment. In addition to the armored horsemen, Franciscan monks
and musketeers, it included a dozen sheep, a goat and a donkey to
represent the 7,000 head of livestock the original settlers brought
with them.
   No one is asking to move Thanksgiving from the fourth Thursday
in November to April 30, but organizers want people to know about
the 1598 feast.
   ``We don't want to fight against any tradition,'' said Ricardo
Marti-Fluxa, Spain's consul general in Houston. ``But we feel it
was a deprivation not to acknowledge the full history of the United
States of America.''
   Mission Trail president Sheldon Hall said he wants the
re-enactment to become an annual event in El Paso.
   The 130 men and 270 women and children in Onate's party started
out from central Mexico in early 1598 to settle along the Rio
Grande, according to the group's chronicler, Capt. Gaspar Perez de
Villagra. While crossing the vast Chihuahuan desert of northern
Mexico, the group ran out of water. Five days later and near death
by thirst, they reached the river April 20.
   According to the Perez de Villagra, the settlers rested for 10
days before holding a thanksgiving feast a few miles east of
present-day El Paso.
   ``We built a great bonfire and roasted the meat and fish, and
then all sat down to a repast the like of which we had never
enjoyed before,'' Perez de Villagra wrote.
   Onate then took formal possession of the Rio Grande basin in the
name of King Philip II of Spain _ an action called the ``toma'' _
and his party eventually settled near present-day Santa Fe, N.M.
   During the re-enactment, the ``settlers,'' led by the horsemen,
wandered around the grassy slopes of Chamizal National Memorial
near downtown El Paso and spied the river. National Park Service
rules prevented a re-enactment of the feast, but the actors
recreated Onate's toma, a solemn Mass led by the Franciscan monks
and a celebratory dance.
   About 1,000 people watched the pageant.

<TEXT>
   The riots that shook the kingdom have
turned Jordan's focus toward internal problems and made the country
less of a factor in the Israel-Palestinian controversy over the
future of the occupied territories.
   It has become increasingly clear that King Hussein was serious
last year when he vowed never to negotiate on behalf of the
Palestinians, saying it is a matter between Israel and the
Palestinians themselves.
   The king was bowing to the obvious: The Palestinian uprising on
the Israeli-occupied West Bank of the Jordan River, which he ruled
until 1967, showed he had little remaining loyalty there. It had
shifted to the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Even the idea of a confederation between Jordan and a
Palestinian state _ a proposal to make Palestinian independence
palatable to Israel _ seems only remotely possible these days.
   Hussein for months has said he will consider a confederation
only after a Palestinian state is created, and only if Palestinians
there and Jordanians in his country vote for it.
   Many old-line Jordanians, or East Bankers, oppose a
confederation because it could give Palestinians a larger say in
Jordanian affairs. Palestinians already make up half of Jordan's 3
million people.
   Palestinians were almost nowhere to be seen in the four days of
rioting that began on April 18 and rocked more than a dozen towns
and villages in southern Jordan, the bedrock of support for Hussein.
   The rioting, in which at least nine people were killed, was
sparked by government-imposed price increases but contained a cry
by East Bankers that Hussein pay attention to their problems and
give them a greater voice in running the country.
   Some have resented the prosperity and political prominence of
Palestinians, who were granted full citizenship when Jordan merged
with the West Bank in 1950. Some also hold a grudge from 1969 and
1970, when PLO guerrillas began to set up a state within a state in
Jordan, often harassing East Bankers at guerrilla roadblocks.
   Hussein's selection Thursday of Field Marshal Zeid Bin Shaker,
the former army commander, as prime minister partly answered that
plea.
   Bin Shaker, a man of Bedouin stock, commands wide loyalty in the
armed forces, which are still a favored occupation for Bedouin
youth. He also was prominent in crushing the guerrilla movement in
1970.
   He replaces Zaid Rifai, whose Jordanian birth was not enough in
the eyes of many East Bank eyes to compensate for his father's
Palestinian origins.
   Hussein will not renounce the Palestinians in Jordan itself. He
has woven them into the fabric of his society, along with smaller
immigrant groups such as Armenians and Circassians.
   But the king has demanded they act as Jordanians and his
security forces watch closely for any expressions of domestic
Palestinian nationalism.
   Israeli leaders still speak often of turning part of the West
Bank back to Jordan or putting it under the control of Jordanian
security forces.
   But hard-line Israelis refuse to give up any of the West Bank or
consider any form of Palestinian entity. They say there already is
a Palestine _ Jordan.
   However, some of the resentments that led to the recent rioting
demonstrate that Jordan is not a Palestinian state.
   No amount of introspection will keep Jordan from being an
essential player in Middle East peace maneuvering. It shares
Israel's longest border and is permanently threatened by a conflict
that has twice swamped Jordan with refugees.
   The king has vowed to maintain his support of the Palestinians
in the occupied lands and has been an important moderating force on
the PLO's negotiating demands. His abandonment of claims to the
West Bank helped push the PLO to focus its attention on ending
Israeli occupation there.
   And the Palestinian organization followed Hussein's longstanding
appeal that it formally endorse Israel's right to exist.
   That led the United States to open a dialogue with the PLO in
December and turn its gaze away from Jordan as the answer to the
41-year conflict.
   Hussein is urging Israelis to do the same.

   For years, residents of this rural
community wanted nothing to do with native son Woody Guthrie,
citing his writings in a Communist newspaper and his support for
the post-Depression labor movement.
   But detractors were nowhere to be found Saturday as more than
750 fans waited in line hours to see his son, Arlo, perform at a
benefit concert to commemorate the author of songs such as ``Bound
for Glory'' and ``This Land Is Your Land.''
   ``Thank you for being here,'' Arlo Guthrie told the more than
750 people present. ``And I know that my dad thanks you also, very
much, for this night. God bless you all.''
   The concert, Guthrie's first in his late father's hometown, was
a benefit performance to raise money for scholarships.
   For Arlo Guthrie, the concert was a homecoming of sorts to a
place he's visited many times but perhaps never really appreciated.
   ``I've been walking around the whole town feeling kind of
strange,'' he said. ``I have other folks here. My grandfather and a
lot of his folks grew up here, spent their lives here. I feel like
I have encountered my own roots and I'm real happy about that.''
   He spent much of his two-hour performance talking to the
audience and, at one point, took a moment to joke about the
controversy that has surrounded the memory of his father.
   ``I think a lot of good things are happening for my dad ... now
that he doesn't need it so much,'' Guthrie said.
   The younger Guthrie, known for songs such as ``Alice's
Restaurant'' and ``City of New Orleans,'' told the audience how he
asked his father to teach him the words to ``This Land Is Your
Land'' when classmates teased him for not knowing them.
   ``I remember he sat me down and he taught me some verses that
weren't in the schoolbook version. I didn't just go back to school,
I went back armed,'' he said.
   ``It never occurred to me in sixth grade that other people would
know that stuff. I thought that just went on in our house.''
   The celebration was an emotional experience for Guthrie, who
said many of his memories of his father are of the years before his
death when he had grown weak from a nervous disorder.
   ``I wish my folks were alive, especially my mom,'' he said.
``But at any rate, where they are now I know that they are looking
down and having a ball, laughing hysterically that this could
possibly go on here tonight.''
   Eighty-year-old Ramona Davidson attended the concert and said
she was happy her hometown honored Guthrie.
   ``It's about time all this has come to pass. Woody has come
home. It's just too bad Woody wasn't here to see all of this,'' she
said.

   Three days and 2,000 miles apart, two
little girls became victims of violence so shocking that disbelief
was the first response of many. Then came love.
   Two-year-old Carmina Salcido was found April 15 in a remote
county dump in Northern California's scenic wine country with her
throat slashed. Beside her lay the bodies of her two young sisters
who died of similar wounds inflicted the day before.
   Despite her wound, Carmina told a detective, ``Daddy cut me.''
   On April 17 in Indianapolis, 5-year-old Erin Bower's hand was
blown off when she reached for a tube of toothpaste while shopping
with her parents and 1-year-old sister at a K mart store. A pipe
bomb hidden in the pump-style container exploded.
   Erin was the victim of a random attack, while Carmina allegedly
suffered at the hand of her father. Yet the two girls are united by
an outpouring of love from strangers across the country.
   Carmina's hospital room was filled with gifts wheeled in on a
brand new, shiny red wagon when loved ones gathered April 24 to
celebrate her third birthday.
   The hospital was deluged with more than 500 toys. Clothing,
balloon bouquets and other gifts are piled so high in offices that
officials recently began urging well-wishers to contribute instead
to one of several trust funds established for Carmina.
   Her 28-year-old father, Ramon Salcido, is in jail awaiting trial
on murder charges in the deaths of her two sisters, mother,
grandmother and the grandmother's two young daughters, and a
co-worker of her father.
   In Indianapolis, about 20 federal and local investigators are
still trying to find the person who planted the bomb.
   Erin lost four fingers and half of her left hand in the
explosion, and the remainder of her hand was amputated the
following day. Although doctors removed the lens of her left eye
April 25, they are optimistic she will regain at least partial
sight in the eye. She was released from the hospital Friday.
   Methodist Hospital spokesman David Richards said so many gifts
and letters arrived for Erin that he couldn't even guess a number.
   ``She's become such a sort of touching and sad news event that
all the staff follow it carefully,'' Richards said. ``I've heard
many expressions of condolences.''
   Unlike Carmina, Erin's family remains intact.
   ``I'm just glad we have our little girl,'' Erin's mother,
Maureen Bower, told reporters. ``She doesn't have a hand, but she's
ours and she's got her same personality back. She's going to be
fine.''
   By contrast, the public barely knows Carmina. Family survivors
remain in seclusion, and the spunky little girl whose mother always
dressed her in beautiful party clothes remains under 24-hour guard
in the hospital to protect her privacy.
   The only available photo of Carmina is a small snapshot of her
sitting with her two sisters.
   Doctors believe Carmina will remain hospitalized for five more
weeks, but adoption offers have already poured in from across the
country, according to Mary Frost, a spokeswoman for Petaluma Valley
Hospital in the northern California town of Petaluma.
   Carmina's grandfather, Robert Richards, was the sole family
member to escape the attacks unharmed, and county officials report
that he has begun the formal process of asking to become Carmina's
guardian. They are hopeful that her permanent home will be selected
soon after her release from the hospital.

<HEAD>Book Shows Different Local Responses to AIDS-Infected Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David Kirp says he saw America at its best _
and its worst _ in the two years he spent studying the way
different communities reacted to children with AIDS.
   In his book ``Learning by Heart,'' Kirp offers a wrenching
account of the paths taken by nine communities forced to wrestle
with the dilemma of AIDS-infected children in school.
   From Kokomo, Ind., and Ocilla, Ga., which banished students in a
frenzy of irrational fears, to Swansea, Mass., and a Hispanic
neighborhood in Chicago, where understanding and reason triumphed,
``Learning By Heart'' is a mirror on humanity _ and sometimes
inhumanity.
   ``AIDS is a very powerful light on us,'' Kirp said in an
interview. ``How do we deal with a crisis that directly touches our
lives? Most of the time we don't get to make moral decisions.''
   His book, Kirp said, ``is really about America at its absolute
best and absolute most mean-spirited,''
   A newspaper columnist, magazine writer and professor of public
policy at Berkeley, Kirp said he ``had a fantasy I could write this
like politics and policy'' _ a dry treatise on how communities
behave.
   Instead, he found himself repeatedly on the verge of tears or
anger as he interviewed families and school administrators and
government officials. He even dreamed about one young AIDS victim
after a particularly affecting encounter.
   ``I didn't know what would lie ahead of me along the way,'' Kirp
said. ``But for all the sad moments when terrible things are
happening to good people, you find people who are behaving with
amazing nobility. They are really ordinary heroes.''
   Kirp did several drafts of the book, moving away from a
judgmental stance.
   Doctors can tell parents over and over that AIDS is transmitted
only through blood and semen, that classroom contact is virtually
risk-free, yet fear persists.
   Among the most trying tales was that of Ocilla, where white
administrators barred from school three black children with
AIDS-stricken relatives. Tests showed that none of the children
carried the virus, but the superintendent insisted there were no
absolutes in dealing with AIDS.
   ``You want an absolute, I'll give you one,'' Dr. Lynn Feldman, a
local health officer, shot back in frustration. ``You can't get
AIDS from someone who doesn't have it.''
   Teen-ager Ryan White's protracted fight to attend Kokomo schools
was one of the first involving an AIDS victim and one of the most
widely publicized. ``I tried not to add to the chorus of
condemnation,'' Kirp said. ``In 1984, when the story was breaking,
the unknowns were so great, the ifs and the fears. My real
unhappiness about the Kokomo story is that they got stuck there
(opposing Ryan's return) and could never get dislodged.''
   The Whites eventually moved away from Kokomo to a less hostile
setting. Ryan told his mother, ``I didn't want to die there.''
   The Swansea story was equally poignant but altogether different.
There, a popular teen-ager with a passion for baseball was welcomed
back by school administrators, health officials, schoolmates and
their parents after he contracted AIDS. ``They were better than
they had to be,'' wrote Kirp.
   The boy, Mark Hoyle, 13, eventually died _ but not before he
``returned to school, read `Macbeth' in English class, learned how
to bake a yellow cake in cooking class, and won the science fair
with an exhibit on the wonders of the human eye.''
   Kirp found some common threads in communities that reacted
nobly: well-informed school authorities and involved local doctors,
who held lots of meetings to educate parents and let them vent
their fears, and who talked about the ill child as ``one of us as
opposed to one of them.''
   The most spectacular example of tactics that backfired was in
New York City, where authorities let parents know exactly 48 hours
in advance that a second-grade AIDS victim would be attending
school somewhere in the vast anonymous metropolis. The result was
furious parents, a massive boycott and a court case ultimately
decided in favor of the city.
   At one point in his book, Kirp comments that ``it seems strange
that a question as basic as the rights of children with AIDS should
be decided locally.'' He concludes with criticism of the Reagan
administration, accusing the former president of a silence that set
cities and towns adrift as they tried to cope.
   ``The historians will wonder how it was that the nation's
president through much of the decade ... could have been mute on
AIDS for so long; and when he finally spoke out, could have been so
inarticulate,'' Kirp wrote. ``The right words from the president,
at the right moment, could have made all the difference.''
   Kirp recalled what happened to the three AIDS-stricken Ray boys
of Arcadia, Fla. Their home was burned to the ground in 1987 after
their parents had fought to enroll them in school.
   ``I just got furious thinking of that,'' Kirp said. ``What
happened in places like Arcadia and Kokomo made no sense. Powerful
signals from Washington could have changed attitudes. But there was
nobody in Washington communicating any sort of moral message.''

<HEAD>Tropical Oil Use Down in US Food Products</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The use of so-called tropical oils by U.S.
food manufacturers has fallen considerably in recent years, but the
Agriculture Department says it won't make much difference
economically.
   Imported products such as palm oil, palm kernel oil and coconut
oil have been attacked vigorously by many U.S. farm and consumer
interests because of their high levels of saturated fats and
possible effects on health.
   The department's Economic Research Service says the United
States used about 14.5 billion pounds of fats and oils in food
products in the last year but that only 550 million pounds, or 4
percent, were tropical oils.
   Soybean oil accounted for more than 10 billion pounds; corn oil,
950 million pounds; and cottonseed oil, 800 million. Animal fats _
lard and tallow _ totaled about 1.1 billion pounds. Other sources
of vegetable oil include sunflower seed and rapeseed.
   Major edible uses of fats and oils are salad and cooking oils;
baking and frying fats; and margarine.
   Economists Bob Cummings and Jim Schaub said that use of tropical
oils in the United States may average about 1.84 billion pounds
since 1985, but the portion used in food products is expected to
average only about 650 million pounds a year, down from the record
1.6 billion pounds in the mid-1970s.
   In 1986, the American Soybean Association, after watching palm
oil and other tropical oils nudge into the lucrative U.S. market,
launched a campaign highlighting the health benefits of soybean
oil's relatively low saturated fat content.
   Cummings and Schaub, writing in the May issue of Agricultural
Outlook magazine, said the soybean people were joined by the
National Heart Savers Association, which began promoting the use of
oils low in saturated fats.
   Tropical oil interests deny adverse health effects, and the
Malaysian Palm Oil Growers Council has mounted an information
campaign and has underwritten medical studies to support its case.
   But Cummings and Schaub said saturated fats ``have been linked
with high blood cholesterol levels and heart disease,'' citing last
year's report by the U.S. surgeon general recommending reduced
intake of dietary fats, especially saturated fats.
   Several major food companies have eliminated tropical oils in
all or most of their products, and others plan to follow.
   ``If edible use of tropical oils were cut 50 percent, the effect
on U.S. fats and oils markets would be marginal, because these oils
are only a small portion of total use,'' the economists said in
their report. ``Substitute oils would capture some of the small
market share held by tropical oils.''
   The report added: ``Prices also would be little affected. Those
manufacturers using large quantities of relatively low-priced palm
oil would experience the largest impact. Consumers would hardly be
affected, because tropical oils account for only a small part of
the price of finished food products.''
   Cummings and Schaub also said that a 50 percent reduction in
U.S. food use of tropical oils would have little effect on U.S.
imports and world trade, and the effect on suppliers such as
Malaysia would likewise be minor.

   A final order is expected to be issued soon by
the Agriculture Department clearing the way for a watermelon
checkoff plan to finance a national research and promotion program.
   The department's Agricultural Marketing Service said the next
steps after the formal order is to hold meetings and solicit
nominations for a 29-member board that will oversee the program.
Those nominations are expected to be submitted by the end of July.
   After a board is selected, a proposed spending budget will be
drawn up and submitted for review. The agency says it may be fall
or later before everything is wrapped up.
   In any case, the watermelon assessments _ which are mandatory
but can be refunded _ are expected to be ready for 1990 production.
   The assessments and the program were authorized by Congress in
the 1985 farm law. A referendum was held in February in which
approximately 52 percent of the growers and 56 percent of the
handlers approved the plan.
   Agency officials said an estimated 7,000 watermelon producers
and handlers would be covered by the checkoff program.
   The assessment, to be recommended by the board and then set by
USDA, can be levied at rate of up to two cents per 100 pounds of
watermelons sold by producers and two cents per 100 pounds for
handlers.
   All producers of watermelons having five acres or more and first
handlers are required to pay the assessment. A grower of five acres
or more who also handles watermelons would have to pay both
assessments.

   Sales of cut flowers, potted plants, greenery
and other commercially grown floriculture crops in 1988, a time of
severe drought in much of the nation, dropped 2 percent to an
estimated $2.24 billion, according to the Agriculture Department.
   An annual survey of 28 crops showed that wholesale values of cut
flowers increased 3 percent from 1987 to about $452 million, while
the value of potted flowering plants declined 3 percent to $494
million.
   Sales of foliage, including hanging baskets and potted foliage,
declined 7 percent to $477 million.
   The wholesale value of plants used for bedding and gardens
declined 2 percent to $724 million last year, the report said.

   Actress Whoopi Goldberg and LSD guru Timothy
Leary led a tribute to 1960s radical Abbie Hoffman, remembering him
as a tireless activist whose outrageous style helped turn public
opinion against the Vietnam War.
   Hoffman, 52, committed suicide April 12 at his Pennsylvania
home, coroner's officials said.
   More than 1,000 people gathered at the First Unitarian Church of
Los Angeles for Sunday's memorial. Others in attendance included
singer Jackson Browne, ``Platoon'' director Oliver Stone and
Pentagon Papers figure Daniel Ellsberg.
   Miss Goldberg, who is often associated with social activism,
said Hoffman taught her ``I can be part of the revolution without
having to hate, without having to hurt people and maim them.''
   ``God bless him,'' Miss Goldberg said. ``I'm going to keep him
alive in my heart.''
   Hoffman founded the radical Yippie movement in the 1960s and was
a defendant in the Chicago Seven trial, following violent clashes
between protesters and police outside the 1968 Democratic National
Convention.

<HEAD>Fight Over Owl Most Acrimonious Since Snail Darter</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not since the 1970s, when the snail darter
took a run at a dam on the Little Tennessee River, has the
Endangered Species Act been the focus of a dispute as acrimonious
as that surrounding the northern spotted owl.
   The Tellico Dam was eventually completed, but only after a
lengthy and bruising battle over the darter _ a tiny fish _ that
reached the U.S. Supreme Court, Congress and the Carter White House.
   At stake in the spotted owl showdown is the fate of some of the
oldest forests on earth and the role of logging, so rich a part of
the heritage of the Pacific Northwest, in the economic future of
Washington state, Oregon and northern California.
   A medium-sized, mostly nocturnal bird, the spotted owl is
fiercely territorial and nests almost exclusively in the
cathedral-like ancient forests of the Northwest. The trees in these
stands average 500 years in age with some of the giants up to 1,000
years old.
   When the first settlers arrived in the early 1800s, more than 20
million acres of old-growth forest dominated the landscape. No one
is quite sure how much remains with estimates ranging from 2
million acres to 6 million acres.
   But if current levels of logging continue over the next
half-century, the only suitable spotted owl habitat remaining may
be in wilderness areas and the national parks.
   Environmentalists have used the owl as part of a campaign aimed
at halting logging of these virgin stands of timber, the bulk of
which are on federal land.
   Old-growth timber is among the most coveted by the industry and
dozens of one-mill towns in the Northwest are economically
dependent on logs cut in federal forests.
   The National Forest Products Association claims that protection
of the owl could result in the elimination of 280,000 direct and
indirect jobs in the Northwest.
   Conservationists say those estimates are ``hysterical'' and peg
the job loss at about 2,300. They also insist that if all the
remaining spotted owl habitat is protected the timber harvest on
federal lands would be reduced no more than 25 percent over the
next 50 years.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, reversing a Reagan
administration decision that congressional investigators found was
based more on politics than biology, proposed last week that the
owl be protected as a threatened species under the Endangered
Species Act.
   The agency found that about 1,500 breeding pair of owls remain
and that without protection their numbers could be cut in half by
the year 2050.
   A species is considered threatened if it is ``likely to become
an endangered species in the foreseeable future throughout all or a
significant portion of its range.''
   The agency now has up to two years to decide whether to actually
list the owl. But once the recommendation is published in the
Federal Register in the next few weeks, federal agencies will be
required to consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service before
taking any action that would affect spotted owl habitat.
   Such actions could presumably include timber sales in the
national forests and logging of billions of board feet of timber
already under contract.
   Some have already suggested that the Endangered Species Act be
amended to exclude the spotted owl from listing, though few
lawmakers find the prospect politically palatable. Similar
suggestions were made when the battle over the snail darter was
raging.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan, in a comment that sent shock
waves through the environmental community, suggested the act might
be changed to take into account the economic impact of listing a
species.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service is now allowed to consider only
``biological factors'' when deciding whether to list a species.
   The congressional General Accounting Office found that top
Interior officials had pressured the Fish and Wildlife Service's
regional director in Portland, Ore., to reject a petition to list
the owl 16 months ago.
   This time, a spokesman for Lujan said, the decision was strictly
up to regional director Marvin Plenert.
   ``No one beat on me,'' Plenert said.
   Steve Goldstein, Lujan's spokesman, said that in such a ``highly
charged atmosphere it would have been inappropriate for us to do
anything but let the regional director make the decision.''
   However, he said, future decisions affecting the owl could
possibly be reviewed at a ``higher level.''
   Although they are pleased by the listing, conservationists are
still reserving judgment on the Bush administration's claim to
environmental respectability.
   ``From a political point of view this was inevitable,'' said
George Frampton, president of the Wilderness Society. ``Based on
the scientific evidence they had no choice. There would have been
an uproar if they hadn't.''
   Jim Pissot, a wildlife specialist with the National Audubon
Society, said there are indications that the regional director's
decision ``raised a few eyebrows'' within the Interior Department.
   ``But biologists and legal staff insisted this was their only
course of action,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   After discussing West Germany's
demand for early talks on cuts in short-range nuclear weapons,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of
Britain remained firmly divided on what has become a major NATO
dispute.
   Both leaders reported making little progress during an afternoon
of talks Sunday on an issue that has split the alliance, describing
their talks as frank and intensive.
   Kohl assured Mrs. Thatcher of his country's firm allegiance to
NATO, whose leaders meet in Brussels at the end of the month for a
summit.
   The West German leader's call last week for prompt superpower
negotiations on short-range nuclear weapons has placed him in a
battle of wills with Mrs. Thatcher and President Bush.
   ``We still have quite a lot of work to do,'' Kohl told reporters
during a joint news conference with Mrs. Thatcher after Sunday's
talks in this village west of the Rhine River city of Mannheim.
   However, Kohl said he thought the issue could be worked out
before the Brussels summit. Mrs. Thatcher also expressed optimism,
but stressed that all North Atlantic Treaty Organization nations
need to agree on a common position.
   The British leader said any suggestion of eliminating
short-range nuclear weapons in Europe is unacceptable and
dangerous. At one point, she appeared to question Kohl's position
on the issue.
   ``I'm sure Mr. Kohl will correct me if I have misunderstood him
on this issue,'' said Mrs. Thatcher.
   Kohl responded by having his interpreter read a line from his
speech to Parliament last week in which he rejected the total
elimination of the tactical nuclear weapons under the present
balance of military forces in Europe.
   Washington and London say talks on reducing short-range nuclear
arsenals should not begin as long as the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact has
a superiority in conventional forces. They also argue that it would
be hard to stop talks from ending in the total elimination of
short-range forces that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
advocates.
   The West Germans say superpower arms talks should be attempted
on a broad scale in light of the current disarmament climate in
Moscow. They remind their allies that most of NATO's short-range
nuclear weapons are based in West Germany and would be used
exclusively on German soil in the event of war.
   Critics of the West German position say it divides and weakens
the alliance at a time NATO must show unity on defense.
   Mrs. Thatcher said elimination of short-term weapons would mean
the ``Soviet Union will have achieved its objective of getting
land-based nuclear weapons out of Europe. This I believe would be
disastrous.''
   Throughout the 40-minute news conference, Mrs. Thatcher
repeatedly returned to the topic of flexible response and the
necessity of upgrading NATO's aging tactical weapons arsenal.
   ``Flexible response is not just something you mouth,'' Mrs.
Thatcher said. ``Strength must continue not only in words; strength
has to be translated into weaponry.''
   She added that the missiles must be upgraded ``because obsolete
weapons do not deter.''
   Under the flexible response policy, the allies could respond to
a Soviet bloc attack with either conventional or nuclear weapons.
   Kohl, faced with uncertain election prospects next year, wants
to delay until at least 1992 a decision on modernization and
deployment of the Lance short-range nuclear rockets.
   Recent polls show that the majority of West Germans no longer
believe the Soviet Union to be a military threat.
   Kohl, while reaffirming his commitment to NATO's flexible
response strategy, was also adamant that the West German position
on missile talks be acknowledged.
   He said he hoped a ``joint document which takes our special
situation into account'' could be prepared at the Brussels summit.
   ``And that has nothing at all to do with the Germans having
become unreliable or anything like that,'' Kohl said, referring to
suggestions that West Germany is no longer following agreed upon
NATO doctrine.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Gingrich Finds Transition to Statesman Isn't Easy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newt Gingrich seems to be taking out his
frustrations on the pavement as he sets off on a 6 a.m. walk down
Washington's Mall.
   The morning newspaper includes a poll showing that two-thirds of
Americans aren't paying much attention to the ethics problems of
House Speaker Jim Wright and just 37 percent know that he's a
Democrat. Gingrich, the newly elected No. 2 leader of House
Republicans, is annoyed.
   ``My party is simply not an aggressive, tough competitor
compared to the Democrats,'' he says, in full stride in hiking
boots and a sweatsuit as the sun begins to rise on the dogwoods and
azaleas on the Capitol lawn.
   ``Given a comparable problem at any given moment, Republicans
are slower and softer and vaguer. We are not in the habit of going
out and being tough. We're in the habit of being a minority.''
   What should the Republicans be doing in the case of Jim Wright,
who has been charged by the ethics committee with 69 violations of
House rules?
   ``Here's a chance to say over and over again, `It's sad, but you
can understand after 35 consecutive years of being in power why the
Democrats are having a hard time,''' Gingrich says, making his
favorite link between power and corruption.
   ``Republicans have a chance to communicate what's wrong with the
way the House is currently run. We're not using it. It's as though
somebody filled up a theater for us, and our side decided not to
perform.''
   Gingrich, the strident conservative whose complaint last year
launched the ethics case against Wright, seems to be having some
trouble making the transition from gadfly to statesman.
   The Georgia lawmaker has had some early successes in his new job
as GOP whip, lining up an organization that includes not only his
supporters but also some old-line moderates. And he demonstrated
vote-counting skills last week when he was one of the few to
foresee a chance to win a key budget vote on the House floor.
   But it has been difficult for him to follow the advice of senior
Republicans who have told him to sit out the Jim Wright affair.
   ``Everybody pretty much agrees that for right now it doesn't
serve anyone's interests to have Newt as the spokesman,'' says Rep.
Vin Weber, R-Minn., a close Gingrich ally. ``It's very delicate
right now. Members of the House may be asked to act as jurors. It's
very hard for him to play any kind of a role in that environment.
The country should not see Republican members of Congress as a
hanging jury.''
   Part of Gingrich's problem has been his inability to sell the
notion that there is a clear link between a politician's ideology
and his ethics. He has been striving to make that case in recent
weeks, pointing to big-city Democratic political machines as
evidence that the party's ethical problems extend beyond Washington.
   ``Ethics is in the long run a devastating issue if you're on the
wrong side of it,'' he says. An occasional jogger slows to stare at
this prematurely gray former history professor who is bustling
along the Mall, keeping up a steady patter of politics before
breakfast.
   ``Those Democrats who want to gamble that Jim Wright's little
problems will disappear are welcome to do it. But it's both
historically and morally wrong, and they're going to find that
politically it's a disaster.''
   ``Disaster'' seems to be one of Gingrich's favorite words, along
with ``profound,'' ``fundamental'' and the phrase, ``corrupt
liberal welfare state.''
   When pressed, Gingrich concedes that the Republicans have had
their own ethics problems _ Watergate, and more recently Deaver and
Meese _ which have been costly. But without elaborating, he insists
those have been less ``systematic'' than the moral shortcomings of
the other party. And he doesn't mention his own book promotion
deal, which is being brought to the ethics committee's attention by
House Democrats.
   ``It's almost impossible to convince the American people that
one party is the clean party and the other is the corrupt party,''
Weber says. ``They tend to view us all as the same. ... There is no
clear partisan advantage.''
   Despite his beliefs, Gingrich has been trying lately to suppress
his instinct to batter Wright publicly. And at a National Press
Club speech last week he wore a button that said, ``Moderates make
a difference.''
   ``I obviously am more cautious now that I'm whip because I don't
just speak for Newt Gingrich,'' he said. ``I speak for 174 other
Republicans in the House.''

   The case of a father accused of killing his
comatose son by disconnecting him from a respirator is going to
court, and two past cases fared very differently in the nation's
courtrooms.
   Rudy Linares, a 23-year-old house painter from west suburban
Cicero, is charged with first-degree murder in the death of his
severely brain-damaged son, Samuel, at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's
Medical Center.
   Police say Linares kept nurses in the pediatric intensive-care
unit at bay with a handgun while he disconnected the 16-month-old
boy's respirator Wednesday and cradled him until he was sure the
baby was dead.
   ``I think he was definitely in a state of irreversible
vegetative coma,'' said the boy's physician, Dr. Gilbert Goldman,
director of the pediatric intensive care unit. ``My opinion was
that recovery was not possible.''
   Yet the hospital refused the family's request that the
respirator be turned off, contending that Illinois law prohibits
withdrawing life-support unless the patient is already legally dead.
   Three years ago, a 25-year-old Miami father was sentenced to
life in prison for killing his comatose 3-year-old daughter, whom
he shot with a pistol as she lay in her hospital crib, eight months
after she had been injured in an accident.
   An Illinois case that began six years ago has a vastly different
history.
   In that case, charges against a Beecher veterinarian who
admitted crushing the head of his severely deformed newborn son
were dismissed by a judge after two juries failed to reach a
verdict.
   In both instances, the legal battles are dragging on.
   Charles Leroy Griffith of Miami is appealing his sentence, which
carries a mandatory 25-year term, in the hope of obtaining a new
trial in the shooting of his daughter, Joy.
   He never denied the act. The girl had been in a coma for eight
months after her head got caught between the foot rest and the seat
of a recliner chair, cutting off her air supply.
   ``I couldn't stop her from suffering,'' Griffith told the judge,
explaining his motive for ending his daughter's life. ``There was
nothing I could do. It drove me crazy ... at least she's not
suffering any more.''
   In Illinois, Cook County prosecutors are hoping to get a murder
charge reinstated against Daniel McKay, who pleaded temporary
insanity after slamming his newborn son to the floor of the
delivery room at Ingalls Memorial Hospital in Harvey.
   Circuit Judge Will E. Gierach dropped the charges after two
juries failed to reach a verdict.

<HEAD>Marilyn Quayle Following Own Agenda During Pacific Trip</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marilyn Quayle is keeping an
independent schedule and pursuing a separate agenda as she tours
the Pacific with her husband, Vice President Dan Quayle.
   In Australia, the Quayles' first stop on their 12-day trip, Mrs.
Quayle frequently went her own way.
   While Quayle visited a pub, she toured a children's hospital;
while he met with Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke, she went
sightseeing at the national art gallery; while he dropped by a
tennis clinic, she taught an elementary school class; and when he
teed off for golf, she signed up for a tennis lesson.
   ``If you want to go out and see the country, go with Marilyn,''
Quayle said at the beginning of the trip. He called her schedule
the ``more interesting'' of the two.
   Since Quayle assumed office a little over three months ago, Mrs.
Quayle, 39, has kept a low profile, rarely granting interviews and
jealously guarding her family's privacy.
   An attorney by training, Mrs. Quayle has not practiced her
profession in over a decade, though she told a group of school
children in Melbourne, Australia, that she wouldn't mind returning
to law.
   ``In my original job, I was a lawyer, but since my husband
became vice president, I've had a lot of duties to perform for
him,'' she said.
   ``So, I'm not sure I can practice law, although I would like
to.''
   Having apparently ruled out that career path for now, questions
have arisen over how Mrs. Quayle plans to define her new role.
   Barbara Bush, for instance, used the second lady's slot as a
platform to promote literacy, and Nancy Reagan pushed the ``Just
Say No'' program to fight drugs when she was first lady.
   Before the Quayles left on their trip, the vice president was
asked what role his wife would adopt.
   Quayle made light of the question, responding, ``She has a very
major cause, and a very major interest. ... A very complex and
consuming issue with her _ and that is me.''
   But on this trip, Mrs. Quayle made it clear she had her own
interests, interests which often kept her out of her husband's way
when he dealt with substantive topics such as grain exports.
   ``In addition to her official duties, she will also pursue her
interest in disaster relief and disaster preparedness,'' Mrs.
Quayle's office said in a statement explaining her trip schedule.
   In Canberra, Mrs. Quayle was briefed on Australia's national
disasters organization, a group that responds to floods, cyclones
and other such events.
   In Indonesia, Mrs. Quayle will travel from the capital to learn
about coping with volcanic eruptions, and in Singapore, she'll find
out about cleaning up oil spills.
   On her first foreign trip as the vice president's wife, Mrs.
Quayle seems to have adapted to her new status, whether standing
somberly by her husband's side at a war memorial or dancing with
him at a black-tie ball.
   During a tree-planting ceremony, Mrs. Quayle referred formally
to her husband, who says he likes to be called Dan, as ``the vice
president,'' and she has handed out souvenirs: Marilyn Quayle
signature key rings embossed with pictures of the vice presidential
mansion in Washington.
   But she doesn't seem entirely comfortable with the constant
media scrutiny.
   ``I've done my duty,'' she told reporters aboard Air Force Two
after chatting for about two minutes four days into the trip.
   In fact, Mrs. Quayle seems to have some ambivalence about her
role.
   Asked by a school child whether she ever thought she would be
the wife of the vice president, she replied: ``It wasn't on my
agenda.''

   The fate of a man who held hospital workers at
bay as he disconnected his comatose son from a life-support machine
is at the heart of a controversy over laws governing hopelessly ill
children.
   Rudy Linares has been released on bail after being charged with
first-degree murder for removing his severely brain-damaged,
16-month-old son from a life-support system.
   A tearful Linares, the father of two other children, cradled the
boy in his arms Wednesday until the child died.
   The boy was to be buried today in a private service at which his
father was expected to attend.
   Prosecutors, the hospital and the boy's doctor contend that laws
prohibit anyone from disconnecting mechanical life support, even
from severely brain-damaged youngsters who are not expected to ever
recover.
   On the other side are defense lawyers and other physicians and
attorneys who argue that the same laws, along with court rulings
and accepted practice, protect doctors and parents from criminal
liability when they decide to end futile treatment.
   ``It is our fervent hope that a case like this doesn't become a
precedent or a landmark, because the issues are so unclear, they
are so murky at this point,'' said Richard Scholz, the public
defender for Linares.
   Linares, 23, a house painter from suburban Cicero, and his
21-year-old wife, Tamara, had requested months ago that
life-support be withdrawn from their son, Samuel, who swallowed a
balloon at a birthday party in August and almost suffocated. But
hospital officials say the family did not seek the required court
order.
   Despite extensive medical efforts to revive him when the
accident occurred, the boy was ``definitely in a state of
irreversible vegetative coma,'' said his physician, Dr. Gilbert
Goldman. ``My opinion was that recovery was not possible.''
   But there was no legal precedent for turning off the respirator
that kept Samuel alive, said Goldman, director of pediatric
intensive care at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center.
   Max Brown, a hospital lawyer, said Goldman and the hospital
could have left themselves open to prosecution under Illinois
child-abuse laws or, worse, been charged with murdering the boy.
   ``He was not brain-dead,'' Brown said. ``He was not dead
according to any legally or medically accepted criteria.''
   Such a criterion is not required under any existing laws, said
Fenella Rouse, legal director of the Society for the Right to Die
in New York City.
   ``In a case like this for a child, withdrawing ventilator
support is not the least bit controversial,'' she said in a
telephone interview Friday.
   Courts in Florida, Michigan and Georgia have supported the
decisions of parents to end life-support in such cases, Ms. Rouse
said, and ``most importantly, nobody has ruled to the contrary.''
   Moreover, Linares is wrongly charged with murder for
disconnecting his son from the ventilator, she said.
   ``There's no doubt about it _ it's legal. It's just as legal for
the father to do it as for the hospital to do it,'' she said.
   Ms. Rouse noted that murder charges in a 1983 California case
against two physicians who withdrew life-support from an adult man
were struck down.
   ``I think it's conceivable he could be charged with trespass, or
illegal use of a handgun, or threatening behavior, but as far as I
understand criminal law, he cannot be charged with something like
this,'' she said of Linares.
   Prosecutors disagree.
   ``Under no circumstances does any person have the right to take
the life of another,'' said Cook County State's Attorney Cecil A.
Partee, who added he could understand the emotions of a distraught
parent in such a case.
   The Linares family had been advised early about the possibility
of obtaining an order in Cook County Circuit Court for the hospital
to disconnect the ventilator, and the hospital would have been
supportive, Brown said.
   ``Why they did not do that, I don't know,'' he said.
   Dr. Stanley Schade, chief of hematology at the University of
Illinois Hospital and chairman of its ethics committee, said some
legal authorities would say a court order is necessary for
withdrawal of life-support, but he believes dealing with the next
of kin is sufficient.
   But Brown said that just because something is done doesn't mean
it is legal.
   ``We don't like to be in the center of the storm like this, but
we are following the law and abiding by the law,'' he said. ``I
will be glad to change our hospital procedures, but the law has to
be changed first.''

   Radio and TV stations could help take
discussion of sex and AIDS out of the locker room and into the
nation's living rooms, but the language must be frank enough to
persuade skeptical teens to practice safe sex, broadcasters were
told.
   Panelists at a National Association of Broadcasters convention
said Sunday that broadcasters can expect heavy criticism from some
groups for public discussions of safe sex, but if they stick to
their guns they also can change minds.
   Americans need ``direct language about sexuality itself, about
sexual behavior, about sexual decision making so that it's not
euphemistic and abstract and something they can't mentally cue
into,'' said Mary Lee Tatum, a sex educator at George Mason
University.
   She said too often movies and television treat sex as a ``dirty
joke'' or as something in which people lose their reasoning
abilities in fits of passion. At the same time, kids are told by
authority figures to think before they have sex. They often don't
listen, she said.
   ``We're hindered by the fact that we think that any serious talk
about any kind of sexual behavior is pornographic,'' she said.
   Critics can be a ``potent force'' against frank public
discussions of sex, but another panelist, William Miller of KTVK-TV
in Phoenix, said it is important that broadcasters take a chance.
   ``These kinds of campaigns take a lot of guts because initially
you're really hit with an awful lot of rejection,'' Miller said.
   But, he said, ``broadcasters have a lot to do with determining
what's acceptable and what's not acceptable and how we talk to
people within our society.''
   He said his station found it difficult to find corporate backers
for an anti-AIDS campaign because ``there's a stigma with AIDS.
They were afraid of being the AIDS electric company ... the AIDS
convenience store.''
   But people's minds can be changed, Miller said, noting that a
Phoenix Catholic bishop's position on public service announcements
about condoms changed so that now he ``is one of the most
supportive people we have.''
   ``After you see some of these things on television it becomes
easier to talk about the subject. A lot of it is up to us,'' he
said.
   Tatum said educators are looking for good visual material on
AIDS and would welcome broadcasters' assistance.
   Toby Pate, marketing director at KPIX-TV in San Francisco, said
her station's Emmy Award-winning public service show, ``AIDS
Lifeline,'' is being distributed to stations in 55 cities and is
being used by schools.
   Reed Tuckson, public health commissioner for Washington D.C.,
said the rate of new AIDS cases is declining in areas with heavy
gay populations, while it is increasing in areas outside urban
centers.
   He said such statistics show the value of public education
campaigns.
   The panel discussion attracted less than 30 audience members at
this convention, which is being attended by nearly 50,000
broadcasters.
   One member of the audience, Delbert Lewis, also from the Phoenix
station, said he was ``angry'' that more broadcasters ``had not
taken this ball and run with it and expounding more on the AIDS
problem. ... We could do more,'' he said.
   Another audience member, Jordan Cohen of WFMJ in Youngstown,
Ohio, said ``the fact that this room is nowhere near full, not even
50 percent, shows that there still is maybe a lot of educating to
be done among our own.''
   An NAB official said the organization for the past 18 months has
been distributing AIDS spots and written material to radio and TV
stations, along with suggestions for possible campaigns.
   NAB also has been helping distribute material from Elizabeth
Taylor's anti-AIDS program, Americans for Aids Research, said Rory
Benson, an NAB vice president in charge of public service
activities.
   ``We didn't have any negative feedback,'' she said in an
interview.
   A new campaign to be launched before the end of the year will
allow stations to target high-risk groups with more explicit
material, she said.

   As the Northeast sweats out the prospect of
another summer of electricity shortages, much of the rest of the
country is nearly drowning in power.
   Government and industry officials say utilities in New England
and New York may be forced to impose ``brownouts,'' or brief
periods of reduced voltage, if this summer brings a heat wave as
intense as last year's.
   A power glut in other areas, meanwhile, is creating problems of
a different sort.
   Public Service Co. of New Mexico is drowning in surplus power.
Last month, state regulators in effect penalized the utility for
having invested in power projects that today are not needed. The
utility, facing financial peril, stopped paying dividends on its
stock.
   ``We still stand in a very precarious state,'' says Rick
Brinneman, a Public Service spokesman.
   The disparate power supplies raises a question of growing
urgency: Why can't regions with too much power send their surplus
to areas with shortages?
   The answer lies in the fragmented nature of America's electric
power grid.
   While it is physically possible to transfer power from one area
to another _ and it is done regularly between some Western states _
there is no nationally integrated transmission system and no master
plan for relieving regional bottlenecks.
   Ashley Brown, a member of the Ohio Public Utilities Commission,
calls the nation's inability to balance its regional power needs
``a travesty.''
   ``If you came from Mars and looked at the New England states ...
and at the Midwest, which we can say charitably is endowed with no
shortage of capacity, and you saw that we can't get power from one
place to another, there is no logical explanation for that,'' he
told a meeting of state utility regulators.
   Some officials say the Northeast's power squeeze may be even
more severe in a few years as growing demand for electricity
outstrips the region's stagnant supply.
   ``The near-term outlook for the electricity system in much of
the Northeast is grim'' unless the Shoreham nuclear plant in New
York and New Hampshire's Seabrook plant are activated, said Henson
Moore, the deputy energy secretary. Local opposition to the plants
makes their operation unlikely.
   In the Pacific Northwest, the Bonneville Power Administration
has so much excess electrical generating capacity that it is
holding back on conservation measures that could save power equal
to the yearly output of 1{ nuclear power plants.
   ``It would just exacerbate our surplus,'' says Lee Johnson of
the agency's Washington office.
   Electricity rates in much of the Northwest rose after a
consortium of utilities, after sinking $2.2 billion into a pair of
nuclear plants, abandoned them for lack of power demand. Northwest
consumers also are paying $14 million a year to keep two other
nuclear plants in mothballs.
   Despite the regional disparities, the United States as a whole
enjoys a comfortable balance between electricity supply and demand.
In 1987, the latest year for which such figures are available, the
nation's utilities had the capacity to provide 23 percent more
power than was needed. The margin of reserve power varied, however,
by region.
   A comprehensive study of the electric power industry, published
last month by Arthur Anderson &amp; Co. and the Cambridge Energy
Research Associates, said ``no single measure exists'' for
measuring the nation's power transfer capability.
   Some utilities are striking deals on their own. The Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, for example, put together a group of
Western utilities to build a coal-fired generating plant in Utah,
with one transmission line to serve Utah and Nevada and another to
supply power to Los Angeles.
   Larry Hobart, executive director of the American Public Power
Association, representing the nation's publicly owned utilities,
says the Los Angeles deal showed how long-distance power transfers
can help a major city avoid the environmental controversy and cost
of building new power plants in its own area.
   ``There are transactions taking place that wouldn't have been
dreamed of 10 years ago,'' Hobart said in an interview.
   But such arrangements are more difficult in the densely
populated Eastern states.
   The New Hampshire and West Virginia state governments have
proposed building a new power transmission line to provide the
Northeast with coal-fired power from West Virginia, but the
obstacles to winning agreement from the states in between are
formidable.
   Power transfers are gaining prominence in part because they are
an alternative to building new generating capacity. Utilities are
reluctant to commit the huge sums needed to build new plants,
largely because the memory of overbuilding in the 1970s _ before
energy demand slumped _ is still fresh.
   It's a financial trap that utilities such as Public Service Co.
of New Mexico are still struggling to escape. It sank $1.2 billion
into the Palo Verde nuclear project in Arizona _ the nation's
largest nuclear generating station _ in the 1970s when electricity
use was growing at a 7 percent annual clip. Demand fell before the
project was completed.
   ``It's an odd Catch-22,'' said Brinneman. ``You plan for the
very eventuality that the East is now going through,'' and yet a
utility can suffer dire consequences if that doesn't occur.

<HEAD>Fraternities Adopt ``No Grades, No Parties'' Rule To Help Image</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM KELLY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scott Leffel straddled a motor scooter
behind the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house and reflected on a future
prerequisite for fraternity parties at Washington State University:
good grades.
   ``I'm not too happy with it, actually,'' said Leffel, a
sophomore. ``It seems like the university is continually working
against us rather than with us.''
   But the ``no grades, no parties'' rule that will take effect
next year wasn't the brainstorm of a scheming college dean trying
to rid the campus of an ``Animal House.''
   The Greeks, often considered synonymous with parties, imposed
this rule on themselves to bolster their image and academic
standing.
   Beginning next spring semester, a fraternity will have to forgo
parties for two weeks for every 0.05 point that its grade-point
average for the preceding fall semester falls below the average GPA
for all male undergraduates.
   The rule, believed to be the first of its kind for an entire
campus fraternity system, was adopted by the Intrafraternity
Council on a 22-1 vote of chapter presidents. The 16,000-student
school has 25 fraternities with a total of 1,400 members.
   Council vice president Tom Gallagher said his fraternity, Lambda
Chi Alpha, would have been pinched if partying penalties had been
imposed based on last fall's grades. But that hasn't dampened his
enthusiasm for the rule he helped develop.
   Gallagher and council president Gary Downing said the policy
attracted much interest at a Western regional conference of
fraternities they attended recently in Oakland, Calif.
   ``The IFC leadership wanted to send a message that kind of flew
in the face of the stereotypical perception of Greeks, that all
they're here for is to party,'' said Jack Burns, fraternities
coordinator for the Residence Life and Housing office. He said he
wasn't aware of a similar campus-wide rule anywhere else.
   Some fraternity brothers question the correlation between grade
point average and keggers, though.
   ``Maybe the problem isn't just with the partying; maybe it's
with the teachers and stuff, you know?'' said Leffel of Sig Ep. ``I
mean, a lot of my TA's (teaching assistants) are from foreign
countries, and when I go in there to try and talk econ' I can't
even understand this guy.''
   ``You can party as much as you want and still make good
grades,'' said a member of Alpha Gamma Rho who was among a group
soaking up sunshine on the fraternity's lawn recently. ``It's just
a matter of budgeting your time.''
   Some fraternity members claim the university pressured the
fraternity council to adopt the rule, with some suggesting that
President Sam Smith is bent on making the campus dry.
   Smith dismisses those suggestions, although he praised the
council for its move.
   ``If we tried to put in a rule like this, it would be fought,''
Smith said.
   Under the new system, even a fraternity whose members get
straight F's won't have to abandon all merriment. The rules set a
maximum penalty of 10 party-free weeks. Penalized houses will get
to pick which weeks they'll spend on the social sidelines.
   Gary Downing of Delta Upsilon said that if the rule was in
effect this semester based on last fall's grades, 14 houses would
have been penalized, with three drawing the maximum of 10 weeks.
Delta Upsilon would have been forced to drop parties for two weeks,
he said.
   Enforcing those sanctions could be problematic, though, says Dan
Thumlert, a sophomore at Sigma Alpha Epsilon. Houses could avoid
any party ban just as many have gone around another recent rule
prohibiting buying kegs of beer with a house check, he said.
   ``You just do it through a private account,'' said Thumlert.
``And we've had more kegs this year than we had last year.''

<HEAD>Study Urges Strategy to Help US Electronics Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A broad-ranging study drafted by the Commerce
Department recommends a coordinated government policy to halt the
erosion of the U.S. electronics industry, department officials say.
   Jack McPhee, director of the Office of Computers and Business
Equipment, said the report calls for development of a coordinated
policy led by the Vice President's Council on Competitiveness.
   He said work on the study, which was requested by the House
Appropriations Committee, has been going on since last November.
   ``We are now putting the finishing touches on an initial draft
to run around the policy areas at Commerce, with the obvious
intention of eventually sending it to Congress after everybody has
concurred on what it should say,'' McPhee said.
   He noted that ``many of the things that we recommend or concur
with in the report are things that are under way or may be slightly
beyond where things are, whether it's antitrust, or research and
development policy, or science and engineering policy. ... It's a
very broad report.''
   McPhee declined to give further details on the study's findings,
saying the report was not ready for public release.
   The Council on Competitiveness, chaired by Vice President Dan
Quayle, was established in late March to review regulatory and
other issues bearing on U.S. competitiveness around the world. Its
members include Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady, budget director Richard Darman and
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher.
   William Krist, vice president for international trade of the
American Electronics Association, an industry group, said he had
reviewed a draft copy of the Commerce study.
   ``It portrays the electronics industry as a strong industry,
having had really good growth. But that masks a deep erosion of
competitive strength, because some other countries have increased
their market share at a much more substantial rate and we've lost
market share,'' he said.
   Krist noted that ``there's no simple solution to this. It's kind
of a web of problems. It (the study) deals with a lot of these _
trade problems, the cost of capital, erosion in the educational
base.''
   ``My impression of it is that it's a good report, and one
certainly I hope Congress will give a lot of really serious
attention to,'' he said.
   Oliver R. Smoot, executive vice president of another industry
group, the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers
Association, said that ``regardless of what surfaces in Commerce's
report, we have to keep in mind a fundamental fact about the
competitiveness of the U.S. electronics industry.
   ``In some product areas, U.S. companies used to have 100 percent
of the market share worldwide because they were the only ones that
made the items. But in that situation, any competition from a
foreign producer means the U.S. companies then have less than 100
percent.
   ``That's not inherently bad, but it's an early signal that the
companies affected by the change must make changes in order to stay
on top,'' he said.
   Alan McAdams, a Cornell University economist and specialist on
the electronics industry, said that in electronics ``our technology
base is being rapidly eroded and we are becoming increasingly
dependent upon foreign suppliers. We're getting close to the point
of no return, where we will have real difficulty in recovering and
re-establishing our own industry.''
   McAdams said he was particularly concerned over loss of U.S.
companies producing the sophisticated equipment needed to
manufacture computer chips. One of the last such companies in this
country, Perkin-Elmer Corp. of Norwalk, Conn., announced recently
that it would stop making the equipment.
   ``When Perkin-Elmer is gone, that's a real blow,'' he said.

<HEAD>Breathed to Discontinue `Bloom County' Aug. 6</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cartoonist Berke Breathed says he will
discontinue his Pulitzer Prize-winning comic strip ``Bloom County''
on Aug. 6, and begin a new, Sunday-only strip the next month.
   The announcement from the Washington Post Writers Group was
reported in today's edition of the Post. It quoted Breathed as
saying ``A good comic strip is no more eternal than a ripe melon.''
   ``Bloom County,'' featuring Opus the penguin and a cast of other
characters from the fictional locale, quickly became one of the
nation's most popular comic strips after its introduction in
December 1980. It is now carried by nearly 800 daily and college
newspapers.
   Breathed, 31, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished
cartooning in 1987.
   In the announcement, Breathed said: ``The ugly truth is that in
most cases, comics age less gracefully than their creators. `Bloom
County' is retiring before the stretch marks show.''
   The cartoonist declined to comment beyond the prepared statement.
   But William Dickinson, general manager and editorial director of
the Writers Group, which distributes `Bloom County,'' said Breathed
had been considering such a move for about a year.
   ``This was not an impetuous decision on Berke's part,''
Dickinson said. ``He thinks the strip may be past its peak in some
way, which isn't true, but that's his decision.''
   Dickinson declined to give details about the new strip planned
by Breathed. ``It will have a different name,'' he said. Asked if
any of the ``Bloom County'' characters might appear in the new
strip, he said, ``Apparently not, with maybe one exception.''
   He declined to elaborate.
   Six collections of ``Bloom County'' strips have been published
by Little, Brown and Co., with 4 million sold, the Writers Group
said.

<HEAD>Navy Planning to Reduce Nuclear Weapon Stockpile by 5 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three short-range nuclear weapons that account
for 5 percent of the total stockpile of U.S. warheads are headed
for the Navy scrap heap, officials say.
   The weapons originally were intended to provide a nuclear
deterrent against attacks on surface ships by Soviet warships and
submarines. But Navy strategists now believe they can protect U.S.
ships by other means.
   So, by 1991 the Navy will retire the ASROC nuclear depth charge,
the SUBROC missile and the Terrier missile, a total of 1,100
warheads, according to Navy officers and documents released under
the Freedom of Information Act.
   The decision to discard the weapons unilaterally was contained
in documents obtained by an independent analyst, William Arkin, and
first reported in Sunday editions of The New York Times. It was
confirmed Sunday by Navy officers who spoke on condition they not
be further identified.
   It was not clear why the Bush administration chose to take the
step without public announcement and apparently without seeking to
include the weapons in negotiations with the Soviet Union.
   The decision was prompted by the realization that the United
States has more aircraft carriers and large surface vessels than
the Soviet Union, and that such ships are vulnerable to nuclear
attack, said Navy officers.
   ``There is a recognition that if there is a nuclear war at sea,
we have got more to lose than the Russians,'' the Times quoted Vice
Admiral Henry C. Mustin, who retired last year after serving as
deputy chief of Naval Operations.
   ``The concept of a nuclear war at sea is a concept whose time as
passed. It is in the interest of the country to persuade that the
time has passed,'' Mustin said in the published report.
   Arkin said another reason for the decision appears to be a shift
in emphasis by the Navy from short-range weapons to nuclear-tipped
Tomahawk cruise missiles. The Tomahawk can fly below enemy radar
and strike targets, such as bomber airfields on the Soviet
mainland, at ranges up to 1,300 miles.
   The Soviet Union has been insisting that the United States agree
to limit or ban submarine-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles, but
under the Reagan administration the Navy balked. The issue is being
considered as part of a strategic review being conducted by the
Bush Administration, to be completed by May 10.
   The decision to retire the short-range nuclear weapons will not
affect strategic ballistic missiles stationed aboard Navy nuclear
submarines that form a key part of the U.S. nuclear triad, land,
air and sea-based weapons intended to deter a large-scale attack,
said Navy officers.
   The weapons that are being retired constitute part of the
American nuclear arsenal that has received little public attention
in the media or on Capitol Hill, compared to the extensive
discussions that have occurred on the cruise and ballistic systems.
   The ASROC nuclear depth charge, carried aboard U.S. destroyers,
cruisers and frigates involved in anti-submarine warfare, has a
range of up 6.2 miles.
   The SUBROC missile is carried by attack submarines, and is
designed to fly at supersonic speeds, then drop a nuclear charge
against enemy submarines.
   The Terrier anti-aircraft missile, which entered service in
1962, is fired from surface warships and has a range of up to 21.7
miles, according to Janes Fighting Ships, an independently
published military handbook.
   Arkin said in a telephone interview that the strategy behind the
decision was outlined in the Theater Nuclear Warfare Utilities
Study, conducted in January 1988, and supplied to him with
significant portions blacked out.
   As a result of the decision, said Arkin, ``scores'' of Navy
destroyers, frigates and attack submarines that had been
nuclear-armed will no longer carry nuclear weapons.
   It was not clear whether or how much money the Defense
Department will save by retiring the short-range weapons.

<HEAD>Navy Has No Comment On Report Iowa's No. 1 Gun Misfired First</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Navy spokesman has declined comment on a
report that there was a misfire in a gun at the USS Iowa's No. 1
turret shortly before the battleship's No. 2 turret exploded,
killing 47 sailors.
   ``While it is under investigation, we cannot comment one way or
another,'' Lt. Cmdr. John Marchi said Sunday, referring to the
inquiry into the fiery blast aboard the battleship.
   The Virginian-Pilot and The Ledger-Star of Norfolk, Va.,
reported Sunday that a survivor of the April 19 explosion, Petty
Officer Kendall L. Truitt, said the misfire occurred during gunnery
exercises just before the blast ripped through the No. 2 turret.
   ``Later, after the explosion and firefighting attempts, they
still had bullets in Turret One's gun,'' Truitt said.
   The newspaper also reported that survivors said 12 sailors in
the turret area survived the explosion. The Navy has said only 11
men lived.
   Capt. Fred P. Moosally, the commander of the ship, has said
there were no indications of any problems with the guns before the
explosion.
   The ship's weapon's control officer, Cmdr. Robert J. Kissinger,
said earlier this week the guns had passed a rigorous inspection
that morning. They had been fired last in early February, he said.
   The powder also had been inspected before the exercise,
Kissinger said.
   The newspaper quoted Truitt as saying quick action by Gunner's
Mate John M. Mullahy Jr. prevented the fire from spreading to the
ship's powder magazines.
   Truitt was contacted by the newspaper at his parents' home in
Illinois.
   The only survivors in the gun's area were those working at the
bottom level of the turret, in the nearby powder magazines and in a
narrow hallway that ringed the armored turret.
   Mullahy was on the turret's internal communications system when
the explosion occurred, the newspaper reported. Unable to raise
anyone on the upper decks of the six-deck turret, Mullahy opened
the blast-proof door between the magazine and the hallway, letting
in the three men who were outside, Truitt said.
   Then Mullahy opened the door to the ``powder flats,'' an area on
the turret's bottom level where powder is temporarily stored on its
way up to the guns, the newspaper reported.
   There were no lights, only a thick brown haze and a fire burning
to the right. The covers on several 110-pound bags of powder were
also burning, the newspaper said Mullahy told investigators.
   Mullahy quickly got out of the powder flats and left the
magazine, which Truitt ordered evacuated, locking the door behind
him.
   Once outside the magazine, Truitt said Mullahy threw emergency
switches to flood the area.
   Moosally has said he ordered the magazines flooded seven minutes
after the blast.

   A small four-door sedan nicknamed the
``Daewoo Racer'' is being exported to Czechoslovakia, the first
Korean-made automobile to be sold to a East European country,
officials said today.
   Daewoo Motor Co. said the first 494 of 3,000 cars to be exported
will be shipped aboard a Soviet Union carrier to the eastern Soviet
port of Vostochniy and then to Czechoslovakia via the
trans-Siberian railway.
   The car trade is part of a barter agreement under which
Czechoslovakia will pay for the cars and other goods, including
electronics, with crude oil from Libya, a spokesman for the company
said.
   The car will be sold by the state-run Motokov company.
Czechoslovakia is seen as a promising market as it annually imports
50,000 cars to fill domestic demand for 150,000 cars, Daewoo said.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose sharply against the Japanese yen
Monday and the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange finished at
yet another high.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at a record 33,793.17,
gaining 79.82 points, or 0.24 percent. The index had gained 212.52
points for a record closing of 33,713.35 on Friday.
   The dollar finished trading at 133.90 yen, up 1.41 yen from
Friday's 132.49-yen close. The currency started at 133.00 yen and
ranged between 132.98-133.90 yen.
   Traders said the dollar started higher in Tokyo following its
rise in New York overnight.
   Daiwa Bank's Takamasa Yamasaki said the dollar was strong though
the only economic factor to encourage dollar-buying was market
players' expectation that the central bank is unlikely to raise the
official interest rate soon.
   ``Participants were less inclined to buy the yen because their
expectation for the interest-rate hike seemed to have faded away,''
he said.
   He said the Bank of Japan conducted a rate check shortly after
the trading began, and then sold some $100 million by mid-morning
to halt the dollar's further rise.
   ``But $100 million would not be enough to reverse the current
uptrend of the dollar,'' he said, adding that the central bank was
only trying to discourage the market's dollar-buying mood.
   The Bank of Japan does not comment on its monetary activities.
   On the stock exchange market, ``trading was quiet mainly because
of the yen's weakness on the foreign exchange and a holiday week,''
said an analyst with Nomura Securities in Tokyo, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The index inched up as some participants bought issues including
steels and real estate, but most market players remained on the
sidelines, he said.
   Stock and exchange markets are to be closed for national
holidays on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.

   Confetti, a speech from President Bush and a
parade marked the celebration of George Washington's inauguration
200 years ago and the experiment in government it ushered in.
   ``Everyone here today can still feel the pulse of history, the
charge and power of that great moment, in the genesis of this
nation,'' Bush told more than 4,000 people Sunday at Federal Hall
for a re-enactment of the inauguration.
   There will be more bicentennial anniversaries, including one for
the passage of the Bill of Rights in 1991. But Sunday's events,
capping a week of festivities, commemorated the official beginning
of a new form of government that survives today.
   ``For all of the turmoil and transformation of the last 200
years, there is a great constancy to this office, and this
republic,'' Bush said. ``So much of the vision of that first great
president is reflected in the paths pursued by modern presidents.''
   After his speech, balloons were released, confetti and flowers
were dropped from skyscrapers and military bands kicked off a big
Wall-Street-to-Washington-Square parade, including military bands,
fife and drum corps and people in colonial garb.
   Protesters chanted during Bush's speech, hundreds of seats in a
special section went unclaimed and several thousand people outside
the section had to watch a sometimes balky large-screen TV screen
150 yards away.
   And when the stand-in for George Washington arrived in a fancy
carriage, he was greeted with polite applause, not the sustained
cheering that history books say occurred in 1789.
   But the sun shone, the speeches were short and many who watched
said they were moved.
   ``There is a sense of history _ the Constitution lives,'' said
Joan Marshall-Dutcher of King of Prussia, Pa., whose husband, David
Dutcher, played Washington's aide, Col. David Humphreys, in the
re-enactment.
   ``On every continent the people are demanding government by the
people,'' former Chief Justice Warren E. Burger declared to the
crowd. ``This is your Constitution. It is our Constitution. Let's
keep it.''
   ``It's a great thing to commemorate,'' said Chris McCarthy, 29,
of New York. ``It's so easy to take for granted that we have a
democracy. Something like this drives home the fact that we've had
it for so long.''
   Bush and his wife, Barbara, left the parade after a couple of
blocks to head back to Washington, D.C., leaving the parade to
George himself _ Philadelphia actor William Sommerfield who took
the oath in the re-enactment.
   On Saturday, thousands lined the shores to watch fireworks spin
through the sky on a rainy night.
   The rockets and flares painted the sky red, white and blue and
anyone with radios could hear a narration by Walter Cronkite.
   The weekend began with a parade of ships steaming into New York
harbor as cannon blasts greeted them. The biggest were the warship
USS Ticonderoga, and the USS MacDonaough, a guided missile
destroyer.
   The celebrations concluded late Sunday with a dinner-dance at
the Waldorf-Astoria that featured descendants of each of the 40
presidents.
   Hilles Timpson of Quogue on Long Island is the great
granddaughter of Martin Van Buren, president from 1837 to 1841, but
she said she did not feel as if her blood was especially
presidential.
   ``I don't think I have much of any kind. I'm always cold,'' she
said with a laugh.

<HEAD>Labor Groups Call For New Protests, Workers Battle Riot Police</HEAD>

   Militant labor groups called today for
major protests after the government arrested about 6,600 people in
blocking a May Day rally in Seoul. Workers and students battled
riot police in three cities.
   The National Headquarters for Labor Struggle, an alliance of
militant trade unions, said it would hold a major rally in the
southern port of Masan Thursday and warned there would be violence
if police attempt to forestall the meeting.
   Labor organizers also called on workers at more than 800
companies across the nation to stop work every afternoon through
Thursday to stage rallies.
   Police said today that about 6,600 people were arrested in Seoul
during the weekend after riot police blocked a rally Sunday called
by labor groups to mark May Day, the international day of the
worker that falls on May 1.
   Protesters battled riot police in running street clashes in
Seoul on Sunday after 20,000 troopers prevented protesters from
assembling.
   Riot police firing tear gas battled about 5,000 striking workers
in Masan and nearby Changwon today after protesters attempted to
stage a May Day rally, police said. Some protesters set fire to
wooden barricades to hold police back.
   About 20 workers were arrested, police said.
   Riot police also battled some 2,000 radical students in clashes
at three campuses in Seoul, police said. Students hurled firebombs
and rocks at riot police to protest the blocking of Sunday's rally.
   Police have already banned the May 4 rally in Masan and warned
that any attempt to stage an illegal protest would be blocked by
riot police. Police were put on top alert to block the
demonstration.
   Labor organizers claimed at least 50,000 workers would take part
in the Masan rally. Radical students and dissidents are also expect
to take part.
   South Korea has been hit by a wave of strikes for higher pay and
better working conditions. The government claims strikes have cost
the economy more than $3 billion in lost production this year and
has warned that labor unrest could cripple the economy and foment
political unrest.
   Opposition parties said today that they would charge in the
National Assembly this week that the government acted illegally in
blocking the Seoul rally. The opposition said it would call for
action against the senior government and police officials
responsible.
   The governing Democratic Justice Party is concerned the
opposition will use the incident to try and claim President Roh
Tae-woo's administration is not committed to ensuring basic rights.
   Many South Korean workers receive subsistence wages for very
long working weeks. A growing number of workers are demanding wage
hikes, better working conditions and a share in South Korea's
growing economic prosperity.
   The government is concerned about efforts by radical students
and dissidents to build a political alliance with striking workers
to challenge the Roh administration.
   The radical students and dissidents have been mounting violent
protests to demand the overthrow of the government, but they lack
public support because of their extremism and violent tactics.

<HEAD>Student Council Tenatively Reverses Resolution Asking ROTC Back</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harvard's undergraduate student council
has reversed its decision to ask ROTC back to the campus, declaring
an earlier vote a violation of the undergraduate constitution.
   But the debate is not over.
   The university forced Reserve Officers' Training Corps programs
from campus in 1969 by declaring the programs extracurricular
activities without special privileges. The move followed a building
takeover and student strike.
   Last week, the student council voted 41-24 to ask the
administration to negotiate with the military and bring ROTC back.
   Sunday night, about 400 students attended the meeting where the
council voted 43-39 against its week-old resolution.
   The resolution effectively said bringing ROTC back was in
violation of the student constitution because the program denies
membership and, therefore, scholarships to homosexual students.
   About 150 activists wearing pink arm bands and T-shirts
demonstrated outside before the meeting and chanted, ``2-4-6-8, no
to ROTC _ gay or straight!''
   During the debate, some students argued that barring ROTC may
deny economically disadvantaged students ROTC benefits.
   ``The issue is one of symbolism verses practicality,'' said
Garrett Price, who supported bringing ROTC back.
   Others said fewer than 20 of the 150 Harvard students who take
part in ROTC programs do so at nearby Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and receive less money from ROTC because their program
was not on campus.
   ``Harvard has a need-blind admissions policy,'' said Deepak
Bhargava, a ROTC opponent. ``If it's not living up to this policy,
we should force it to do so.''
   Although the council reversed itself Sunday, members next week
will consider the measure that would approve ROTC on campus if the
military did not bar homosexuals.

<HEAD>India Again Postpones Ballistic Missile Test-firing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHANDIPUR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   India today postponed the test-firing of
its first intermediate-range ballistic missile for a second time
after a leak was discovered in the rocket's liquid fuel propellant,
military sources said.
   A military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
scientists detected the leak minutes before the scheduled launch
time and attempts to repair it quickly were abandoned three hours
later.
   On April 20, firing of the missile, named ``Agni'', was canceled
after a last-minute hitch in the ignition system.
   The military official said senior defense officers and
scientists had not yet decided when a third attempt would be made.
   The 7.5-ton missile has a range of 1,550 miles, Indian military
experts say. It was to be boosted in the first stage by a solid
propellant engine and in the second stage by a liquid fuel motor.
   A successful launch would make India the sixth nation in the
world to demonstrate ballistic missile capability. The others are
the United States, the Soviet Union, France, Britain and China.
   The Agni _ fire in the Hindi language _ was to have been
launched from the Chandipur test range on the Bay of Bengal about
750 miles southeast of New Delhi. The postponement was met by
cheers and blowing of conch shells by many of the 12,000 villagers
who were temporarily evacuated from their homes around the launch
site.
   The villagers fear they will be permanently shifted from their
homes if the missile launch is successful and the test range is
used for more firings.
   Agni is the fourth missile India has developed since the
Integrated Guided Missile Development Program started in 1983.
   India has already test-fired three surface-to-surface and
surface-to-air missiles with ranges from 20 to 155 miles.
   Defense experts say Agni's one-ton payload enables it to carry a
nuclear warhead, although New Delhi has said its demonstrated
nuclear capability is for peaceful purposes such as generating
power.
   India exploded a nuclear device 15 years ago, and Western
nuclear experts believe scientists can assemble an atomic weapon in
one week.
   The test-firing of the Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile is
intended to be only ``a technology demonstration of the country's
capabilities,'' according to the government.

<HEAD>Sergio Leone, Father Of Spaghetti Western, Dead At 60</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sergio Leone, the Italian director whose widely
imitated films included ``The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' and
spawned the spaghetti western genre, has died at age 60.
   He died early Sunday of a heart attack at home.
   Leone's career spanned four decades but he is best known for the
handful of westerns he made in Italy during the 1960s, typically
featuring terse, gunslinging loners dueling on a spare and
sun-scorched landscape.
   His films made an international film star of Clint Eastwood.
   Leone, the son of a film director Vincenzo Leone, began his film
career in 1948 as an assistant on Vittorio De Sica's ``Bicycle
Thief.''
   He went on to be assistant director on dozens of films,
including ``Ben Hur'' and ``The Last Days of Pompeii,'' working
with such Hollywood directors as William Wyler and Fred Zinneman.
   The first film Leone directed was ``The Colossus of Rhodes,''
one of a series of popular mythological films made in Rome in the
1950s. The film won him a wide following and a flood of offers to
direct similar films.
   But the American westerns he saw as a child were what captured
his imagination and in the early 1960s he began to make ``A Fistful
of Dollars.'' Leone paid attention to historical detail and
attracted a solid cast led by Eastwood, then an American television
cowboy. Leone released the film in 1964 and it was a box-office
smash despite the prevailing opinion that the western genre was in
decline.
   Eastwood recalled Sunday in California that Leone used the
pseudonym Rob Robertson to release the movie because ``in those
days people didn't want those Italian westerns.''
   Leone's next film was ``For a Few Dollars More'' in 1965 and
``The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' in 1966.
   ``The universal attraction of the western is that it is a great
fable, a myth like Achilles,'' he told an interviewer in 1968.
``For me personally, the attraction is the joy of making justice
... without asking permission _ bang, bang.''
   After the three westerns, Leone began work on a saga about
American gangsters in the early 1900s. But he fell in love with a
film he had co-written, ``Once Upon A Time in the West,'' and
directed it himself, working with a cast that included Henry Fonda
and Charles Bronson. He followed it with yet another Western,
``Duck You Sucker'' in 1972.
   Leone had trouble in the 1970s finding producers who would foot
the bill for his lavish productions and turned to producing other
people's films.
   Finally, in 1983, he managed to finish ``Once Upon A Time in
America,'' an impressionistic film using flashbacks and
flash-forwards. The movie was praised at the Cannes film festival
and was a hit in France and Italy, but it was drastically cut for
its U.S. release and got lukewarm reviews.
   Leone had been planning to direct a blockbuster film about the
siege of Leningrad by German troops during World War II.
   The directgor, who made his home in both Italy and France, is
survived by his wife, Carla, and his children Raffaela, Francesca
and Andrea. Funeral services were scheduled for Wednesday.

<HEAD>`Family Ties' Finale Episode Taped</HEAD>

   Cast members of ``Family Ties'' celebrated the
taping of their 176th and final episode, culminating seven years as
the Keaton family on one of television's most popular comedy series.
   ``It's going to be awhile before it really hits,'' said Michael
J. Fox, who played Alex P. Keaton, the politically conservative
oldest child.
   ``I think it's going to hit us around September when we would be
coming back to work _ the same as a retired athlete would say when
the football season starts next year and I'm not in spring
training,'' Fox said Sunday night at a party celebrating the NBC-TV
show.
   In the final, one-hour episode to be broadcast May 14, Alex
fulfills his longtime dream of landing a job with a Wall Street
brokerage firm and prepares to leave home.
   ``I will miss the entity of `Family Ties,''' said Justine
Bateman, who played Mallory Keaton, Alex's sister whose main
interests were fashion and shopping. ``It was an incredible
chemical combination and reaction. I don't think anyone remembers
the recipe. Actually, the recipe was hard work, good work and just
class and nice dispositions.''
   The show, which debuted in September 1982, featured Michael
Gross as their father, Steven Keaton, and Meredith Baxter Birney as
his wife, Elyse.
   The parents, former flower children of the 1960s, confronted the
materialistic nature of Alex and Mallory, and younger daughter
Jennifer's struggle to grow up.
   Jennifer, played by Tina Yothers, lost her role as baby of the
family in the fifth season when son Andrew, played by Brian
Bonsall, was born.
   While there was comedy, the show also tackled serious subjects
such as teen-age pregnancy, death and divorce.
   The series, which often ranked among the highest rated shows,
won three Emmy Awards for the 1986-87 season, including Fox as
outstanding lead actor in a comedy series. An award for outstanding
writing in a comedy series went to creator Gary David Goldberg and
co-executive producer Alan Uger for a special one-hour show, ``A,
My Name is Alex,'' in which Alex struggled to cope with a friend's
accidental death.
   Gross said he will miss his character as well as the cast
members.
   ``I've enjoyed Steven. It's been fun living with him,'' he said,
``and I hope I've even learned a few things from him _ patience and
understanding and all those other things I have in a rather shorter
supply than he does. But I'm going to miss my co-workers.''

<HEAD>MIT Department Heads Cast Doubt on Utah Fusion Experiment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   University of Utah researchers who claim a major
breakthrough in cold fusion apparently misinterpreted crucial data
and may not have achieved fusion, according to two Massachusetts
Institute of Technology scientists.
   In a paper they plan to present to the American Physical Society
in Baltimore tonight, the MIT scientists question the reported
level of neutrons emitted during the Utah experiment. A release of
neutrons could be a sign that fusion was taking place.
   ``We're asserting that their neutron emission was below what
they thought it was, including the possibilty that it could have
been none at all,'' Ronald R. Parker, director of MIT's Plasma
Fusion Center, said early today.
   Utah chemist B. Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann of England's
University of Southampton announced on March 23 they had produced
fusion in a jar at room temperature.
   The report has aroused hopes of a cheap and virtually limitless
supply of clean energy, but it also has elicited skepticism from
many scientists who doubt fusion could take place at anything but
extremely high temperatures.
   Parker said MIT researchers have been working for weeks to
verify the Utah experiments, but their results didn't hold up when
measured against a standard known as a Neutron Capture Gamma
Spectrum.
   ``If (fusion) occurred at all, it was far below what they
deduced from their measurements,'' Parker said.
   Part of the problem, Parker said, is that Pons and Fleischmann
did not directly measure the neutrons released in their experiment.
   ``The measurement they made was an indirect measurement, not of
neutrons directly but of gamma rays produced by neutrons,'' Parker
said.
   ``The neutrons were taken by many to be an indication that real
fusion was taking place,'' he said. ``And when you remove the
neutrons or vastly lower their rate of emission, then I think this
(lessens) the possibility that fusion has taken place. But doesn't
completely rule it out.''
   Parker conducted his research along with Ronald Ballinger, head
of MIT's Materials Science and Engineering and Nuclear Engineering
departments.
   Parker called their findings ``a warning to not accept all the
claims at face value and not to expect that there's an overnight
path to nirvana as far as energy is concerned.''

   The stand-in for George Washington at the
bicentennial of his inauguration was an actor playing Washington.
   And a descendant of the nation's first president who
participated in the weekend's festivities is a Washington trying to
be an actor.
   Stern-faced Philadelphia actor William Sommerfield, who took the
oath in Sunday's re-enactment of Washington's inauguration, tried
to be as much like the nation's first president as possible even
when crowds seemed unsure whether to laugh or applaud.
   But 24-year-old John Washington, whose great, great, great,
great, great, great uncle was Washington says he doesn't know
whether his bloodline and name is an asset or a curse as he pursues
acting in Los Angeles.
   And more than once, he said, he's considered changing his last
name so it will no longer be a factor.
   Washington said he began having mixed feelings about his
heritage after he appeared in 1984 in a television miniseries about
his uncle. He played Washington's brother.
   ``The only reason I'd get in to see people is my agent would
say, `He's related to George Washington,''' Washington recalled
before a dinner-dance at the Waldorf-Astoria on Sunday night for
descendants of presidents.
   He termed it ``bizarre nepotism.''
   ``I was so humiliated,'' said Washington, who has appeared on
television in small parts several times this year.
   At the inauguration parade Sunday afternoon, people asked him
``Who are you?''
   ``I lied and said, `Kennedy,''' he said. ``I thought I'd get
more respect. It was my impression people didn't care about George
Washington anymore.''
   He said the Washington name also didn't help some of his
relatives.
   One Washington descendant ran for Congress in the state of
Washington with the motto, ``Send Washington to Washington for
Washington.''
   ``He lost,'' Washington said.

<HEAD>Dollar Up Sharply, Nikkei Hits New High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar closed sharply higher against the
Japanese yen today despite central bank efforts to check its rise,
and the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index finished at a new high.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 79.82 points, or 0.24
percent, closing at 33,793.17. The index had gained 212.52 points
to set a 33,713.35 record close on Friday.
   The dollar closed at 133.90 yen, up 1.41 yen from Friday's close
of 132.49 yen. It opened at 133.00 yen and ranged between 132.98
yen and 133.90 yen.
   Traders said the Bank of Japan bought about $300 million in
efforts to brake the dollar's rise against the yen.
   But Minori Takeuchi of Chemical Bank said the central bank's
intervention encouraged dollar buying instead of pushing the
currency down.
   ``Until the BOJ intervened, trading was rather quiet, with
little fluctuation in the rate,'' she said.
   ``Because the BOJ's dollar-buying didn't work at all, investors
were reconfirmed in their feeling of the dollar's strength and
continued to buy it,'' Ms. Takeuchi added.
   She said the market's demand for the dollar is still strong
because market players expect no immediate change in U.S. economic
policies.
   On the stock market, Daiwa Securities dealer Kenji Ishizuka said
the market's main index rose in the afternoon session as
institutional investors bought about 20,000 shares of each of the
225 issues in the index.
   He said reduced concerns about an immediate interest rise in
Japan encouraged buying. Media reports have said the central bank
might raise its official interest rate by 0.5 percentage point to 3
percent, but many in the market now expect that this will not
happen soon. Higher domestic interest rates generally discourage
stock buying.
   Trading was relatively active, Ishizuka said, with first section
volume estimated at 900 million shares. Friday's volume was 1.1
billion. Among the gainers were steel, ship building and
supermarket issues.
   The markets will be open Tuesday, but then will close until next
Monday for a series of national holidays known in Japan as ``Golden
Week.''

<HEAD>`Ghetto,' A Play by Joshua Sobol, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 3 grafs with comments from other critics; No PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two months after 50,000 of the 70,000 Eastern
European Jews living in the Vilna Ghetto of Poland during World War
II were slaughtered, a theater company was started by some of the
survivors.
   It was an extraordinary event _ the founding of an artistic
community at the height of the Holocaust to keep alive the spirits
as well as the lives of those still trapped by its horrors.
   The story of the theater's birth in 1942 and its death two years
later is told disjointedly in Joshua Sobol's ``Ghetto'' which
opened Sunday at Broadway's Circle in the Square Theater. The play,
even with the addition of songs and music, is heavy on philosophic
discussion and short on dramatic continuity and character
development.
   That might seem strange, considering the thousands of
unspeakable tragedies that occurred in Vilna. But Sobol is more
concerned with historical events than individuals. The events _
some real and some imaginary _ are told in flashback by Srulik, a
ventriloquist and the artistic director of the fabled theater. His
remembrances make for some striking images but confusing story
lines.
   Director Gedalia Besser captures the audience's attention
immediately as Srulik, as an old man, sits on stage in a hospital
wheelchair and remembers. Suddenly, the back wall falls, and
mountains of bags containing the clothes of dead Jews tumble to the
floor as a prison wall topped with barbed wire rises in its place.
It's a mesmerizing beginning to the play, and an image that not's
topped during the rest of the evening.
   In the ghetto, Srulik carries a ventriloquist's dummy, played by
a real actor, Gordon Joseph Weiss. Weiss is made up to look like
the lascivious master of ceremonies in the musical ``Cabaret.'' The
dummy is the one occupant of the ghetto who talks back to the Nazi
officers, particularly the commandant, Kittel, played with sneering
ferocity by Stephen McHattie.
   It's Kittel who has the idea for the theater company, and he
orders Jacob Gens, the Zionist leader of the Jewish police in the
ghetto, to carry it out. The play eventually becomes an argument
about the existence of the company between Gens and other members
of the ghetto, particularly Hermann Kruk, founder of the ghetto
library.
   Gens is a practical man who will sacrifice some Jews so others
can be saved. If only Jews who work can be kept alive, he will give
them jobs in the theater. But Kruk is appalled at the idea and
proclaims, ``In a cemetery there can be no theater.''
   George Hearn as the realistic Gens and Jarlath Conroy as the
more cultured Kruk enunciate their arguments well, but not much is
learned about them from the play except their opposite stands on
the theater company.
   Avner Eisenberg, best known as the clown Avner the Eccentric,
plays Srulik. He isn't given much of an opportunity to develop his
character, even though the story is told through his eyes. Srulik
serves primarily as an excuse for announcing the various excerpts
of the company's theatrical productions which are shown only in
brief segments.
   There are a few interesting characters, particularly a cabaret
singer played with heart-breaking desperation by Helen Schneider.
She sings the songs, both original numbers from the ghetto theater
as well as new material written by William Schimmel, with
authenticity. And Donal Donnelly has some incisive moments as a
tailor who helps organize workers to mend German uniforms and which
helps keep them alive.
   Sobol's play, translated by David Lan, never develops
dramatically once the ghetto residents establish the theater
company. It goes from incident to incident without shedding more
light on the characters or why they participated in it.
   The theater finally was closed down by the Nazis in 1944, which
the play depicts in a bloody and unsatisfactory finale. Even after
more than two and a half hours, the audience is left wondering
about the inhabitants of Vilna, marveling at their determination to
survive, but wanting to know a lot more about what they were really
like than ``Ghetto'' manages to tell.
   In other reviews, The New York Times' Frank Rich said the
presentation is lifeless and is ``aiding rather than combating
historical amnesia.''
   In the Daily News, Howard Kissel said the play ``has moments in
which harsh images come to life. But for long stretches it is
curiously uninvolving.''
   Clive Barnes, writing in the New York Post, said ``Sobol has
theatricalized this fragmentary morality play with great skill.''

<HEAD>Safety No Longer Top Priority At Chernobyl, Soviet Official Laments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The local Communist Party chief is complaining
that safety standards have eased at the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant and well-trained specialists are in short supply at the
facility.
   Grigory I. Revenko, first secretary of the Kiev region, says in
an article in Sunday's Pravda that workers still are searching for
the best way to seal the plant's No. 4 reactor, which exploded and
spewed radiation three years ago last week in the world's worst
nuclear accident.
   After the April 26, 1986 accident, which killed at least 31
people, the reactor was encased in concrete to prevent further
radiation leaks.
   Revenko, a Ukrainian who was recently elected to the new Soviet
parliament, did not say why additional measures were needed to seal
the reactor.
   While that work continues, however, ``Problems with the safe
operation of the station more and more are being moved back to
second priority,'' Revenko wrote in the Communist Party daily.
   ``The understanding of the acuteness of the problems, including
those concerning the safety of the station, has dulled. We consider
this unacceptable and demand decisive intervention by'' the
government, he said.
   Other reactors at the plant are working and reportedly have
generated more than 40 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity since
the accident.
   Revenko, 53, said Chernobyl workers either have not received the
equipment and high-quality spare parts they need or have received
them after long delays. He also said scientists and technical
specialists throughout the country are poorly coordinating their
work on eliminating the accident's consequences.
   In addition, he said, the Atomic Energy Ministry is not sending
enough workers capable of coping with the special problems at the
plant.
   The three-column article said it was taking too long to build
housing and other buildings for Chernobyl plant workers in a new
town, Slavutich, and that an off-limits, contaminated zone around
the plant is being poorly managed.
   Recent Soviet news reports have said thousands more people will
be evacuated because their land is contaminated by Chernobyl
radiation and that deformed animals are routinely born on
contaminated Ukrainian farms.
   The reports also have complained that despite the Kremlin's
policy of greater openness, the government recently adopted a rule
forbidding disclosure of the illnesses people suffer from Chernobyl
contamination.
   Soviet public opinion turned against nuclear power after the
accident, and several nuclear power projects have been scrapped
around the country.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Severe thunderstorms bashed Texas with hail as big as baseballs
and a reprise of winter weather dumped snow on Colorado, while rain
soaked the Southeast.
   The storms and heavy hail were centered over central Texas.
Baseball-size hail crashed in and around Tin Top, Breckenridge,
Mason and Mountain Home, and 3-inch hail pelted Cool. Golf
ball-size hail peppered Kerrville for almost 10 minutes and
completely covered the ground.
   Snow hit part of the plains and mountains of Colorado on Sunday.
Almost 4 inches fell in Denver by the evening, and flights at
Stapleton International Airport were delayed up to an hour earlier
in the day. Colorado Springs also got up to 4 inches.
   Rain was widespread across much of the Ohio and Tennessee
valleys and the southern Appalachians, with locally heavy rain
expected to continue in the latter region. Flash flood watches were
in effect from northeast Georgia across eastern Tennessee and much
of North Carolina to southwest Virginia and southern West Virginia.
   Pope Air Force Base at Fayetteville, N.C., recorded over 2\
inches of rain in the six hours ended at 2 a.m. EDT.
   An area of low pressure over the Gulf of Mexico was spreading
showers and thunderstorms into the eastern Gulf Coast.
   Light rain was falling behind a cold front from south central
Iowa into northeast Kansas. Rain also was falling in Oregon and the
northern California coast.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
portions of the southern Plains across the lower Mississippi Valley
and the Gulf Coast to the southern Atlantic Coast states. Scattered
rain was predicted from Missouri across the middle Mississippi and
Ohio valleys to New York and Pennsylvania, and in the Pacific
Northwest, Idaho and northeast Nevada. Rain was forecast to be
widespread over the central Appalachians and the mid-Atlantic
states.
   Highs were expected to be in the 40s and 50s from the Great
Lakes across the upper Mississippi Valley and Nebraska to eastern
Colorado; the 80s from the southern Atlantic Coast across the Gulf
Coast and southern Texas to interior portions of central
California; the 80s and 90s in the desert Southwest; and the 60s
and 70s in much of the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 21 degrees at Custer,
S.D., to 80 degrees at Glendale, Ariz., and Key West, Fla.

<TEXT>
   Japanese and U.S. ships searched off southwestern
Japan today for two U.S. sailors missing from a Navy submarine
after a wave washed them overboard while they were standing watch,
officials said.
   A third sailor also washed overboard before dawn Sunday was
spotted by a rescue plane and saved by his ship, the 2,145-ton
Barbel, the U.S. Forces Media Liaison Office said in a statement.
   The rescued sailor's condition was not given, and U.S. military
spokesman Master Gunnery Sgt. Jake Rodrigues said he had no further
information.
   ``The three crew members were standing watch on the sail during
surface operations in international waters when the accident
occurred at 2:30 a.m.,'' the statement said.
   Yoshikazu Nakamura of the Maritime Safety Agency's office in
Kagoshima prefecture said there probably were numerous big waves at
the time because a fog and strong-wind alert was in effect for the
area.
   The Navy statement said the submarine was off Japan's
southernmost main island of Kyushu, about 650 miles southwest of
Tokyo.
   Nakamura said there was no way to determine the height of any
waves or the wind speed.
   Kiyoshi Harada, a spokesman for the maritime agency, said three
Japanese aircraft and four vessels, including three Japanese patrol
boats, searched today for the missing sailors.
   A Japanese defense official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that before the accident, the submarine surfaced
because it was taking on water from a hatch. He refused to
elaborate.
   A U.S. Navy spokesman denied that. ``We have no information that
there is anything wrong with the Barbel, and it is taking part in
the search,'' Lt. Jeff Gradeck said.
   The diesel-powered Barbel, built in 1956 and equipped with six
torpedo tubes in its bow, has a crew of 77, said a U.S. military
official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The official said the 219-foot Barbel belongs to the last class
of non-nuclear combat submarines built by the Navy.

<HEAD>Tens of Thousands March in Traditional May Day Parade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviets marked May Day today with a parade through
Red Square that focused on efforts to encourage economic growth,
carry out competitive elections and clean up the environment.
   In its broadcast of the annual workers' celebrations, state-run
television paid tribute to those killed in a pro-independence
demonstration in Soviet Georgia last month as well as to the
victims of the Armenian earthquake and a fire aboard a nuclear
submarine.
   No parades were held in the Armenian and Georgian capitals this
May Day out of respect for the dead, the official news agency Tass
reported.
   In Moscow, the mood was upbeat and the weather was balmy and
bright, with the emphasis on progress and only general references
to international issues, such as signs extolling peace.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and members of the Communist
Party's ruling Politburo stood atop Lenin's tomb to view the
festivities as thousands upon thousands of marchers passed through
Red Square waving banners, pushing floats and releasing
helium-filled balloons.
   Raisa Gorbachev, the president's wife, was nowhere to be seen.
The Gorbachevs' daughter, Irina, and granddaughter, Oksana, were in
a stand reserved for VIPs.
   U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock and other Western diplomats who
boycotted the parade to protest the 1979 Soviet intervention in
Afghanistan were in their places with the diplomatic corps today.
They returned last year after the Soviets announced they would
withdraw their troops _ a withdrawal completed in February.
   In a section reserved for government dignitaries stood Boris N.
Yeltsin, the Communist leader ousted from his post as Moscow party
boss and removed from the Politburo but elected to represent the
Soviet capital in the new parliament that meets May 25.
   Also present were members of a Chinese delegation in Moscow to
prepare for Gorbachev's visit to Beijing this month for the first
Soviet-Chinese summit in 30 years.
   The May Day parade, unlike the one each Revolution Day, Nov. 7,
is not a military affair, but Soviet television interviewed a
missile commander on the square, Col. Gen. Yuri A. Yashin, who said
defense industries now devote 40 percent of their production to
making consumer goods for civilians and plan to increase that share
to 60 percent in coming years.
   ``It's mostly things like refrigerators, cars, washing machines,
agricultural machinery,'' Yashin said, reflecting official policy
to commit more resources to producing consumer goods for a
product-starved domestic market. He said the Soviets have destroyed
860 missiles under the U.S.-Soviet treaty to eliminate
intermediate-range nuclear weapons.
   Yashin also said the first military bases, covering nearly
10,000 acres, have been turned over to the civil sector for farming.
   Hundreds of signs and red banners held aloft by what Tass said
were 150,000 marchers stressed the virtue of work. The signs
carried by the marchers also boosted perestroika, Gorbachev's
program to modernize Soviet society; a campaign to make the
Communist state a nation of laws; and recent parliamentary
elections for the new Congress of People's Deputies.
   Also this year, there was increased attention to environmental
concerns. ``To the coming generations: a clean planet,'' pledged
one banner.
   Access to Red Square is severely restricted for such events, and
the vast majority of Soviets who saw the two-hour parade did so on
television, which augmented its coverage with prerecorded segments,
including one on the importance of cleaning up the water supply and
conserving natural resources.

   Two trains from a brand-new roller
coaster bumped into each other on opening day at entertainer Dolly
Parton's Dollywood theme park, slightly injuring 18 riders, a
spokesman said.
   Sensor devices that activate the braking system of the new
``Thunder Express'' were realigned after Saturday's accident, said
Dan Rohman, marketing director for the Smoky Mountain amusement
park that Miss Parton opened four years ago. The ride worked
without problem Sunday, he said.
   Eighteen riders were treated and released at Sevier Medical
Center after the accident, said nursing director Rosemary Lehuray.
   The accident occurred when a train loaded with 15 riders failed
to slow enough as it was returning to the loading zone. It bumped
into another train loaded with 20 people, said Rohman.
   The $2 million ride carried an estimated 7,000 people Saturday,
the first day the park was open this season, Rohman said.
   Miss Parton performed at the park Saturday and Sunday. Rohman
said he didn't believe that she was aware of the mishap.

<TEXT>
   As a teen-ager in Poland during World War II,
Irene Opdyke risked death at the hands of the Gestapo by hiding 12
Jewish friends in the basement and attic of a German officer's
villa where she worked.
   All survived the Holocaust, as did countless others who were
saved because Mrs. Opdyke shared information overheard from Gestapo
officers planning roundups in Jewish communities.
   Last week, an old war debt was repaid.
   Administrators at the Jewish Home for the Aged in the San
Fernando Valley community of Reseda waived admissions policies and
admitted Ms. Opdyke's 80-year-old husband, William, to their
Alzheimer's disease unit.
   ``We violated all the rules _ he's not from our region, we are
sectarian, we are so short of beds _ but there are certain times
when there are no rules. This is one of those times,'' Executive
Director Sheldon Blumenthal said. ``In caring for Bill, we are
repaying a debt to her. We owe her.''
   Opdyke is one of only a few non-Jews at the 875-bed facility
that provides communal living for old people.
   Mrs. Opdyke, 68, said she vowed to help her Jewish friends when
she saw the way Hitler's army treated Jews during the 1939 invasion
of Poland. She called it ``a nightmare that changed my life.''
   ``I saw a man with a white beard and a little white hat, running
carrying a Torah,'' she said. ``Little ones were screaming `Mama!
Mama!' I saw a soldier pull a baby out of its mother's arms and
throw him to the ground. Later, I heard shooting. They were killing
innocent people.''
   While working as a housekeeping for a German major, she hid
Jewish friends for nearly eight months, sometimes in the home's
attic, other times in the basement.
   Recently, as Ms. Opdyke's husband began suffering from the
advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, administrators at the
Jewish Home for the Aged said they felt a special obligation to
care for him.
   ``She risked her life and this is the return we want to give
her,'' said Dena Schulman, spokeswoman for the home.

   The death toll from the tornado that
ripped through central Bangladesh passed 800 today when searchers
found 14 bodies in the ruins of houses and two other people died of
injuries, officials said.
   They said the bodies were found in the district of Manikganj, 25
miles northwest of Dakar, which bore the brunt of the storm.
   At least two people critically injured by the tornado died in
Dhaka's Medical College Hospital, officials at the Tornado Control
Room said. They spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The deaths increased the number of people killed to 802. At
least 12,000 people were injured and 130,000 left homeless after
the tornado raged through Manikganj on Wednesday night, sending
people, houses, trees and electric poles flying.
   Residents say the storm caused more than 1,000 deaths because
400 people officially listed as missing are feared killed.
   Survivors face shortges of drinking water, food and medicines,
rescue officials said.
   ``Diarrhea may spread in an epidemic form unless supply of pure
drinking water improves,'' one official said on condition of
anonymity. He said at least 100 people have been treated for
diarrhea.
   ``Decomposing bodies lying in pools and ponds have polluted the
water,'' said relief worker Mohammad Nasim.
   At least 300 wells have been drilled in Manikganj district to
supply safe water and another 100 will be sunk in the next few
days, officials said.
   Meanwhile, Britain announced aid of $85,000 for tornado victims,
the government-owned news agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sanstha
reported. And Pakistan is sending a plane with relief supplies, it
said.
   The tornado, accompanied by hailstones and showers, came hours
after President Hussain Muhammad Ershad led nationwide prayers for
rains to ease a two-month-long drought.
   The drought threatened to destroy half the 5.6 million ton
spring crop in the ground, Agriculture Ministry officials said.
Agriculture, almost entirely dependent on rainfall, is the main
occupation of most of the nation's 110 million people.
   Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries with an average
annual income of $160 a person, alternates between flood and
drought.
   Summer floods last year left four-fifths of the country under
water and killed at least 1,400 people. In November, cyclones
claimed another 1,100 lives.

<TEXT>
   Eight leaders of underground political groups
remained in custody today, a day after being arrested while selling
their magazines on the Arbat pedestrian mall, an activist said.
   The eight dissidents probably will stay under ``preventive
arrest'' through the two-day May Day holiday that ends Tuesday,
said Yuri Mityunov, a member of the self-styled opposition party
Democratic Union.
   Leaders of the Democratic Union, Express-Chronicle, Free
Migration, Debate, and Trust groups were detained Sunday after
ignoring police calls to disperse.
   ``Down with the fascists!'' one man yelled at police as they
grabbed the activists.
   In their publications and in telephone calls to Western
reporters, the groups declared Sunday a ``samizdat holiday.''
``Samizdat'' is Russian for self-published and is used to describe
underground newspapers and magazines.
   On Sunday, the dissidents perched atop concrete planters outside
the Vakhtangov theater on Arbat Street, silently holding makeshift
bulletin boards bearing copies of their publications.
   Thousands of onlookers strolled along the mall in the 70 degree
weather and peeked at the publications. The most sensational of the
newspapers was a copy of the Communist Party daily Pravda that had
pasted to it cartoons lampooning Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin.
One cartoon portrayed Lenin as a devil.
   A policeman announced through a megaphone that the gathering was
not sanctioned, and he ordered the dissidents to disperse. About 15
minutes later, officers moved in.
   The Democratic Union, formed in May, seeks multiparty elections,
independent trade unions, a new constitution and the withdrawal of
Soviet troops from Eastern Europe.

Show</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oceanographers have recovered Jason, the errant
submersible robot that took a dive last week, but have decided to
give its understudy, Medea, the starring role in an underwater show.
   Jason, a high-tech, propeller-driven submersible equipped with
video cameras and maneuverable arms, was retrieved from the bottom
of the Mediterranean Sea on Saturday. It sank 2,100 feet to the
ocean floor Wednesday when its cable to the support ship Star
Hercules snapped.
   Meanwhile, the submersible Medea, which was used to recover
Jason, was expected to take center stage today as the first of
250,000 students in 12 cities across the United States and Canada
hook up via two-way satellite with marine explorers off the coast
of Italy.
   Over the next two weeks, museum officials and elementary and
high school students will watch via satellite as Medea inspects the
wreckage of a sunken Spanish galleon.
   Medea is a six-foot-long, one-ton platform carrying three
television cameras, two color and one black-and-white. Unlike
Jason, it is not remotely operated with its own propulsion system;
it is towed behind a surface craft and its cameras operate as it
passes a target.
   Organizers had hoped Jason would be able to go on with the show,
but Sonya Hagopian of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, a
sponsor of the program, said Jason will undergo a complete
evaluation before returning to service.
   ``Jason will probably be going back in, but not right away,''
Hagopian said Sunday from Cape Cod. ``It could be a matter of just
a few days.''
   About 2,000 museum officials, teachers and technicians were
testing a satellite hookup last week when Jason, the younger
brother of the robot that first rummaged through the Titanic's
wreckage, unceremoneously sank on its debut mission.
   Hagopian said that while most of the damage to Jason appeared to
be cosmetic, technicians planned to run it through a series of
tests before returning it to the water.
   ``I understand that there is minimal damage to it. It is still
very usable. It's not bad at all,'' she said. ``On a scale of one
to 10, with one being minimal damage, I'd say we're at a one.''
   The May 1-14 project's sponsors include Woods Hole, Turner
Broadcasting System, the National Geographic Society and Electronic
Data Systems.
   Participating museums, mostly science and natural history
museums, are in Boston; Denver; Detroit; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago;
Dallas; Memphis, Tenn.; Philadelphia; Rochester, N.Y.; Sarasota,
Fla.; Washington, D.C.; and Victoria, British Columbia.

<TEXT>
   Syrian and Christian forces battled with
mortar and tank fire in the hills above Beirut today, killing two
people and wounding seven, the first casualties in a 3-day-old
truce called by the Arab League.
   Fighting raged from nightfall Sunday to daybreak today in the
mountaintop town of Souk el-Gharb, where Syrian troops and Druse
militiamen surrounded a Christian army garrison, police said.
   Mortar and tank cannon rounds crashed in Christian and Druse
villages around Souk el-Gharb, wounding seven villagers, police
said.
   Two Lebanese soldiers also died in the fighting, the first
fatalities reported by officials since a truce went into effect
Friday in an Arab League-mediated attempt to halt eight weeks of
bloodshed.
   ``This is the gravest violation of the truce. It's worse than
the sporadic bombardment of the coastline of the Christian enclave
in the past two days,'' according to a police spokesman said.
   ``The coastal shelling underlined the dispute over blockaded
seaports, but the fighting in Souk el-Gharb has wider dimensions
that could undermine the Arab League's peace plan altogether,'' he
said. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Souk el-Gharb sits atop a strategic network of mountain roads
leading from the Druse hinterland southeast of Beirut to the
Christian heartland north and northeast of the capital. If the
Christian-controlled town falls to the allied Syrians and Druse,
Christians would lose the central mountain stronghold shielding
their 310-square-mile enclave.
   The latest casualties increased the overall toll to 275 people
killed and 1,000 wounded since March 6, when army commander Gen.
Michel Aoun's 20,000 mainly Christian troops blocked illegal Moslem
militia-run ports. The Syrian-Druse alliance responded by
blockading the Christian enclave.
   A spokesman at Aoun's command claimed the Syrian army and
militiamen of Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist
Party were ``trying to provoke us into a mass retaliation to
undermine the Arab League's cease-fire.''
   ``But the general is determined to strip them from that excuse.
We're not responding,'' said the spokesman, who requested anonymity.
   He said Aoun's army was merely defending front positions and was
not shelling Moslem residential areas or distant Syrian targets.
   Jumblatt, meanwhile, issued a May Day statement calling for
Aoun's removal from power as a condition for peace.
   ``It's impossible to reach a compromise with Michel Aoun. He
must be removed or toppled,'' said Jumblatt. ``This must be clear
to all other Christian leaderships.''
   The political and military wrangling underlined a dispute over
the second provision of the latest cease-fire that calls for the
lifting of air, land and sea blockades.
   Aoun, who heads a Christian military Cabinet in Lebanon's dual
government, refused to call off the blockade of illegal harbors,
which he says deprive the state of $100 million yearly in lost
taxes. He said his gunboats and helicopter gunships were applying
Lebanese laws.
   But the rival Moslem Cabinet under acting Prime Minister Salim
Hoss has insisted Aoun's blockade be lifted.

   A car rounding a steep curve in the
driving rain crashed into a tractor-trailer, killing six of the
car's eight occupants, state police said.
   Four of the dead in Sunday's crash were children. A 47-year-old
woman was in extremely critical condition at North Fulton Medical
Center and a 10-year-old girl was in critical condition at Scottish
Rite Hospital in DeKalb County, hospital spokesmen said today.
   The driver of the truck was unhurt, said Georgia State Patrol
Cpl. Mike Nash.
   Nash said the accident occurred about 2:40 p.m. on a state road,
during ``a torrential downpour.'' The car was descending a hill and
rounding a curve when the driver ``evidently lost it and got over
in front of the tractor-trailer,'' he said.
   The Forsyth County sheriff's office identified the victims as
Sherry Rogers Thompson, 21, the driver; her brother, Gerald Kevin
Rogers, 27; Tiffany Rogers, 3; Ashley Thompson, 3; and Jamie
Rogers, 6, all of Cumming, and Francesca Rogers, 3, of
Lawrenceville.

   Student protest leaders today denounced meetings
government officials held with students as insincere attempts to
placate the students without seriously addressing the democratic
reforms they seek.
   Several student leaders, meanwhile, said they have been warned
to stop planning a protest Thursday, the 70th anniversary of
China's first democratic movement.
   Two Cabinet ministers met students today, the third day of
meetings to discuss student demands for reforms including a free
press and an end to official privileges and corruption.
   Some students complained the government has snubbed their
independent group, the United Association of Beijing Universities,
by refusing to allow it to represent the student movement in the
talks. The government says the group is illegal.
   ``We don't recognize this `dialogue,''' said a spokesman for the
group, which has been leading two weeks of protests including the
largest protest marches in 40 years of communist rule and a
week-old class boycott.
   ``We demand a dialogue based on the principles of equality and
openness, conducted directly between democratically chosen student
representatives and government decision-makers,'' he said at a news
conference. The student did not want his name used for fear of
government reprisals.
   Wang Dan, a student leader at Beijing University, the nation's
most prestigious school, called for establishment of a nationwide
independent student group and indefinite continuation of the class
boycott by about 75,000 students in Beijing and nearby Tianjin.
   On Monday, the minister of metallurgical industry, Qi Yuanjing,
met students at the Beijing College of Science and Technology, and
Minister of the Aeronautics and Astronautics Industry, Lin
Zhongtang, met students from the Beijing Aeronautical Institute,
state-run radio reported.
   Officials acknowledged to students that government decisions
often are made too quickly and without sufficient study, the radio
reported.
   At the first meetings, the government selected 45 students to
meet Education Minister He Dongchang and other senior officials
Saturday and 29 students to meet Sunday with Beijing Mayor Chen
Xitong and city party chief Li Ximing.
   Officials at the meetings insisted they share students'
opposition to worsening corruption, but urged them to ``calm
down,'' halt plans for new marches and end the class boycott.
   The Guangming Daily, China's national newspaper for
intellectuals, praised the meetings as expressions of ``socialist
democracy'' and channels for ``clearing up misunderstandings and
suspicion.''
   Students, however, complained they were only allowed to ask
questions and there was no give-and-take.
   ``The government answers to student questions illustrated their
lack of sincerity,'' the United Association spokesman said. He
accused the government of trying to ``deceive public opinion'' by
making an appearance of conceding to student demands.
   ``Students, we risked bloodshed and danger to get as far as we
have!'' said a poster at the People's University. ``Please continue
your efforts.''
   China's Communist Party, meanwhile, marked the international
labor holiday May Day today by appealing to workers in editorials
and speeches to resist ``forces of instability.''
   So far there has been no large-scale organized support among
workers for the student marches. But workers have cheered on
student protesters and voiced support for demands for an end to
official corruption.
   Although the government toned down its initial harsh criticism
of the student movement after tens of thousands of Beijing citizens
applauded a student march Thursday, it has continued to claim an
unspecified ``handful of people'' are illegally plotting revolution.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle said today
he had a productive meeting with Cambodian resistance leader Prince
Norodom Sihanouk, but the two did not broach the subject of U.S.
military aid.
   ``It was a good meeting,'' Quayle said after the 45-minute
session with Sihanouk. ``I had not met him before.'
   Aides to the vice president arranged the meeting with Sihanouk
after learning that the two would be in Jakarta at the same time.
   Quayle, who arrived here today after five days in Australia,
also held discussions throughout the day with a host of
Indonesians, including President Suharto and three human rights
activists.
   Quayle said that in his meeting with Sihanouk, he did not talk
about the possibility of providing military assistance to Cambodian
resistance forces, although that option is under consideration in
Washington.
   ``We talked about the process and moving the process forward and
what coalition may or may not be, who the players are and what some
of the expectations would be,'' the vice president told reporters.
   Cambodia's future _ and U.S. policy toward the country _ is one
of the top items on Quayle's agenda during his 12-day trip to the
Pacific region. Vietnam has said it plans to end its military
occupation of its Southeast Asian neighbor this fall.
   The United States supports having Sihanouk lead an interim
government until elections can be scheduled in Cambodia. Others
jockeying to run the country include factions led by Hun Sen, the
head of the Vietnamese puppet government in Phnom Penh; the Khmer
Rouge and an anti-communist group headed by Son Sann.
   Both Hun Sen and Son Sann were in Jakarta for meetings with
Sihanouk.
   While the United States has yet to clearly define its policy
toward Cambodia, Quayle and his aides have firmly rejected a
takeover by the Khmer Rouge, the Chinese-backed group that was
responsible for killing as many as 1.5 million people in the late
1970s.
   Sihanouk has called for an international conference in Paris
that would devise an enforcement mechanism for the withdrawal of
Vietnamese troops and the transition toward an elected government.
   A senior aide to Quayle said that in his meetings with Suharto,
the vice president reiterated that the United States wants to
follow the lead of its Asian allies in devising its policy toward
Cambodia.
   Washington does not want to do ``anything that is
counterproductive,'' said the aide, who asked to remain anonymous.
   Quayle also discussed trade with the Indonesian leader and said
the United States is interested in human rights issues such as the
situation in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony annexed by
Indonesia in 1975.
   While the United States views Indonesia as a reliable ally, it
wants to see Jakarta develop more openness on the political side as
well as economically.
   Underscoring his commitment to human rights, Quayle met with
three local activists to hear their concerns. The vice president
did not agree with all of the activists' issues, but he ``listened
and received material about individual cases'' of alleged human
rights abuses, the Quayle aide said.
   More than 30 members of Congress asked the vice president last
week to raise the human rights issue with the Indonesians,
especially to pursue reports that the country is holding as many as
400 political prisoners.
   Quayle and his wife Marilyn, leaves for Singapore on Tuesday
before heading to Thailand and Alaska, where he will view the
cleanup operation from the devastating March 24 oil spill of the
tanker Exxon Valdez.

<HEAD>Attacks On Collaborators Ordered By PLO Officials Abroad</HEAD>

   PLO officials abroad approve most of the orders
to kill Arabs suspected of collaborating with Israel after
underground ``trials'' are conducted by local Palestinian
activists, Palestinian sources said today.
   The PLO headquarters in Tunis had no immediate comment on the
report.
   In the latest attack on an alleged collaborator, Ahed Ramini, a
30-year-old Palestinian, was fatally stabbed today by attackers in
the occupied West Bank city of Tulkarem, Arab reports said.
   His death brought to 41 the number of alleged collaborators
killed since the Palestinian uprising began nearly 16 months ago,
most the victims of attackers who support the Palestine Liberation
Organization. More than 60 alleged collaborators have been wounded.
   In recent weeks, the Palestinian underground has established a
clandestine system to conduct what they say are trials of those
accused of cooperating with Israel's military government in the
occupied West Bank and occupied Gaza Strip.
   Palestinian sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
so-called trials included testimony from witnesses, and that notes
or tape recordings were made of the proceedings.
   ``As the Palestinian organization becomes more disciplined,
there have been situations where people have been pulled in and
questioned. Testimony has been taken as well as confessions, which
are tape recorded and signed,'' said one Palestinian believed to
have close contacts with underground activists.
   On the basis of such statements, recommendations were forwarded
to PLO officials abroad, said another source, adding that a ``black
list'' had been compiled of Palestinians who informed or worked
with Israeli military authorities.
   The Palestinian sources said the orders to kill the alleged
collaborators were approved by a Moslem clergyman who was deported
by Israel from the West Bank in 1980 and is now believed to be
based in Iraq.
   The sources said orders are relayed via coded messages broadcast
by Baghdad Radio.
   An Israeli military official who spoke on condition of anonymity
said the PLO had encouraged and cooperated in attacks on
Palestinians who had dealings with Israel or adopted anti-PLO
positions. He also confirmed the clergyman was involved in
approving such reprisals.
   According to Israeli government figures, 960 attacks were
carried out between December 1987 and mid-April, most of them
warnings such as firebombs hurled at houses or cars.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said there was a ``wave of terror''
being waged to intimidate moderates who might otherwise support
Israel's proposal to hold elections in the occupied territories to
choose Palestinian negotiators.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel told reporters April was
the bloodiest month for Palestinian attacks on Palestinians with at
least 10 killed. He was unable to cite evidence that Palestinians
were killed for political beliefs but contended the attacks had a
chilling effect on diplomatic efforts.
   ``It is impossible to convince people to start working on the
elections in this atmosphere,'' Liel said, confirming newspaper
reports that Arens complained to U.S. Ambassador William Brown that
terror was being used to thwart Israel's attempts to find
Palestinian partners for dialogue.
   Palestinians denied the killings were designed to rein in
dissidents and said collaborators were punished because they
endangered the lives of underground activists who were sought by
Israeli authorities.
   One source said the United National Leadership of the Uprising,
which guides the revolt against Israeli occupation, had issued an
internal memo recently stressing that no reprisals could be taken
against collaborators without permission of the underground.
   ``If anything, there are less attacks as a result,'' said one
Palestinian.
   A leaflet distributed in Nablus today and signed by Fatah,
Yasser Arafat's PLO faction, vowed to ``strangle anyone who will
think of interfering with the intefadeh (uprising) and those who
collaborate.''

   Technicians today replaced two
faulty fuel system parts aboard space shuttle Atlantis, and NASA
hoped to be able to reschedule the once-aborted launch attempt for
as early as Thursday.
   Space agency spokeswoman Lisa Malone said a new pump and 4-inch
fuel line were installed and were being prepared for pressure, leak
and other checks.
   ``The work is going very well,'' she said today.
   Shuttle managers scheduled a meeting this afternoon to consider
a new launch date. Earlier they had said the earliest possible
liftoff date was Friday, but with the work progressing smoothly
they said today that a Thursday afternoon liftoff was a possibility.
   Because of the shifting positions of Earth and Venus, there is
only a 32-day launch opportunity for sending the $550 million
Magellan spacecraft in Atlantis' cargo bay toward Venus.
   If the shuttle can't get off the ground by May 28, the mission
would have to be put off for two years, at a cost of $100 million,
until the two planets are again aligned properly.
   The launch was scrubbed last Friday just 31 seconds before the
planned liftoff when controllers noted a sudden power surge on a
fuel pump that recirculates liquid hydrogen propellant for one of
the three main engines.
   Engineers later discovered a tiny leak in a 4-inch-diameter fuel
line that carries hydrogen from the external fuel tank to the
shuttle.
   Had the countdown continued, a computer designed to detect such
problems would have stopped the engines from firing and the five
astronauts would have been safe, according to the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   Workers on Sunday erected scaffolding and platforms around
Atlantis, removed access panels and unhooked, insulation, wiring
and other equipment as they began removing the bad parts.
   Two of the astronauts, commander David Walker and pilot Ronald
Grabe, practiced shuttle landings in a training aircraft Sunday and
then flew to their home base in Houston. Mission specialists Mary
Cleave, Mark Lee and Norman Thagard returned to Houston on Saturday.
   At the Johnson Space Center in Houston, the astronauts will keep
sharp by rehearsing aspects of the flight in a shuttle simulator.
   Six hours after launching the astronauts are to release the
Magellan from Atlantis' cargo bay, starting it on a 450-day journey
to Venus. The 7,600-pound craft is to orbit the planet and map up
to 90 percent of its cloud-veiled surface with a high resolution
radar system.
   The images, relayed to Earth and enhanced by computer, could
tell scientists much about the history of Venus and why it evolved
so differently than its sister planet Earth.

   Paraguayans voted today for a
president and congress to replace the 34-year regime of Gen.
Alfredo Stroessner, who was toppled in a Feb. 3 coup.
   Gen. Andres Rodriguez, the candidate of the ruling Colorado
Party and the man who ousted Stroessner, was expected to easily
defeat former exile Domingo Laino and six other rivals. The
Colorados were expected to retain control of congress.
   Laino denounced election irregularities, such as a lack of
indelible ink at some stations to prevent double voting and a voter
registration list that favored the ruling party.
   But he said this morning that some flaws were unavoidable and if
fraud was not ``generalized'' his party, the country's second
biggest, would accept the results.
   Voters interviewed shortly after polls opened at 7 a.m. (8 a.m.
EDT) said the elections were as free as any they had voted in.
   Voting was conducted in privacy and the ballots of all eight
parties were available, said architect Ricardo Facetti. ``That
didn't use to happen'' in the days when Paraguayans were encouraged
to vote for Stroessner and the Colorado Party.
   ``Before, I wouldn't even have talked with you. What if a
policeman saw?'' said Cesar Ramon Gonzalez, 57, a retired public
accountant. ``Now the atmosphere is completely different.''
   Polls indicate Rodriguez will receive as much as 70 percent of
the vote.
   Stroessner, 76, seized power in a 1954 coup and brooked little
opposition during his lengthy rule, arranging to be elected every
five years. He was unseated on Feb. 3 and sent into Brazilian exile.
   The 65-year-old Rodriguez has been hailed by Paraguayans for
toppling Stroessner, but opposition parties _ banned under
Stroessner _ have complained they were not given enough time to
prepare for today's elections.
   Eight parties have fielded candidates in the voting for
president, 36 senators and 72 deputies to finish the five-year
terms begun by Stroessner and congress following elections in
February 1988.
   The parties are responsible for providing their own ballots and
presidential candidate Fernando Vera said his opposition
Revolutionary Febrerista Party was not sure its ballots would be
available at all of the more than 10,000 polling places nationwide.
   ``We've distributed our ballots to the main places, but I'm not
sure we've gotten through'' to smaller, more remote villages in the
nation of 4 million, he said.
   The Colorado Party has controlled the government for 42 years
and Rodriguez has broadened his base by improving relations among
its factions as well as with foreign governments and the Roman
Catholic Church, to which most Paraguayans at least nominally
belong.
   At a campaign rally Saturday night, Rodriguez repeated his
pledge to complete only Stroessner's term and to hand over power in
August 1993 to ``my successor, freely elected by the people at the
ballot box.''
   The opposition contends the Colorados will benefit from dated
voter registration lists. Even the Central Electoral Board says
that up to 600,000 names on the list of 2.2 million may be invalid.
   The main campaign issue has been who can best move a country
that has never had a democratic government in that direction.
   Rodriguez has broadened civil liberties and pledged to reform
the constitution, electoral laws and penal code.
   The polls were to open at 7 a.m. and close at 4 p.m. with
unofficial results expected tonight. Paraguayans ages 18 to 60 are
required by law to vote. Violators face small fines.

   Pope John Paul II celebrated an
open air Mass in an impoverished farming region today and said that
despite tough economic times the faithful should not use artificial
birth control.
   ``While it appears necessary to be aware of family planning,
couples...should use natural methods,'' the pope told the 100,000
people who gathered for the Mass.
   The Roman Catholic Church approves only what it calls natural
family planning, or abstinence during a woman's fertile period.
   Many Western nations have pressured Third World countries to
control their population explosions, which hinder economic growth
and are a chief factor in environmental degradation.
   The pope said that although the church's teachings seem
difficult, natural methods will work and the faithful should reject
``contraceptive imperialism.''
   John Paul arrived 90 minutes late for his last Mass on this
Indian Ocean island. Fog had closed the airport 240 miles south of
the capital of Antananarivo.
   After the Mass, the pope flew back to the capital and boarded an
Air Madagascar Boeing 737 for the hour's flight to the French
island of Reunion, the second of four stops on his fifth African
tour. On Tuesday he travels to Zambia then Malawi.
   President Didier Ratsiraka called the pope's visit ``a source of
comfort for those who are suffering'' in this impoverished country.
   In Fianarantsoa, the pope blessed 100 lepers who kneeled in a
sandy field near the airport before saying Mass from a raised,
wooden altar covered by a canopy.
   The pope today spoke of the serious environmental problems
facing Madagascar and other developing countries and reaffirmed his
call Sunday for an international effort to safeguard the
environment.
   ``From the north to the south of your great island, I have been
able to admire the beauty, diverse richness of the Earth and its
fruit. And yet the way it is being used risks its degradation and
sterilization.''
   Saving this 225,000-square-mile island that split from the
African mainland more than 150 million years ago has become a
priority of many international environmental groups.
   Ninety percent of the island's plants and animals are found
nowhere else, including hundreds of species of orchids and 29
species of lemurs, small primates whose name derives from the Latin
word for ghost because of their nocturnal habits.
   The destructive farming methods of the island's population,
constantly seeking fresh terrain to plant rice and other crops, has
caused widespread deforestation.
   The Mozambique channel, off the island's west coast, is so red
from the infusion of soil washed in by erosion that it is clearly
recognizable to astronauts circling the globe.
   On Sunday, the pope spoke on the environmental threat to a
gathering of foreign diplomats. He said he supports international
efforts to halt the dumping of toxic wastes in poor countries and
development that endangers the world's remaining rain forests.
   Also Sunday, the pontiff beatified a Malagasy woman credited
with keeping the faith alive 100 years ago after the queen had
banned all Roman Catholic services. Beatification is a first step
toward possible sainthood.
   The church has been openly critical of Madagascar's government.
Since a communist revolution in 1975, the country's economy has
declined and recently, the government made policy alterations to
assure foreign aid.

   Attackers firing from a
passing car today shot and killed anti-apartheid activist David
Webster outside his home, friends said.
   Police confirmed a white man was killed in a shooting incident
at Webster's home in the Johannesburg neighborhood of Troyeville
but declined to release other details.
   Webster, 44, was a lecturer in social anthropology at the
University of the Witwatersrand and a prominent member of several
anti-apartheid organizations. He led campaigns against the
government's policy of detention without trial.
   Glenda, his former wife, told the independent South African
Press Association that Webster was opening the back door of a van
when shots were fired by men in a car. She said he had just
returned from buying plants at a nursery.
   Audrey Coleman, a colleague of Webster's and a fellow activist,
said she was certain the killing was politically motivated.
   Mohammed Valli Moosa, a former detainee now serving as
unofficial spokesman for major anti-apartheid groups, said in a
statement: ``We are deeply shocked by this blatant assassination of
our dear comrade ...
   ``We are concerned that his death comes as a result of
unflinching opposition to the system of apartheid,'' Valli Moosa
said of South Africa's policy of legal race discrimination. ``The
only beneficiaries of his death are those who have an interest in
perpetuating this evil system.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to restudy, in
a case involving the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, what limits
should be placed on campaign spending by political groups that
incorporate themselves.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Michigan officials that
is supported by the Federal Election Commission.
   The Michigan Chamber of Commerce has about 8,000 dues-paying
members, about three-fourths of them corporations.
   The chamber planned in 1985 to place a paid advertisement in the
Grand Rapids Press in support of Richard Bandstra, a Republican
candidate for the state House of Representatives.
   Fearing the ad would be considered illegal under Michigan's
Campaign Finance Act, the business group filed a federal lawsuit
seeking to have the law declared unconstitutional. The chamber said
the act violates its free-speech rights.
   The state law generally prohibits corporations from spending in
behalf of political candidates and carries a maximum $10,000 fine.
   The law permits a corporation to make such expenditures if it
sets up a special fund, or political action committee, that is
required to keep records and disclose the names of contributors.
   The Chamber of Commerce has such a fund. However, it wanted to
pay for the newspaper ad for Bandstra out of its general treasury,
which is exempt from the record-keeping and reporting requirements
of the state campaign finance law.
   A federal judge ruled that the chamber may not spend money from
its general treasury in behalf of a political candidate. The judge
said the state campaign finance act, aimed at heading off
corruption of the political process, applied to the chamber's
activities.
   But the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last September
overturned the judge's decision.
   ``We conclude that indirect expenditures made by a
non-traditional corporation, like the Michigan Chamber of Commerce,
formed for essentially ideological purposes and to disseminate
economic and political ideas and not to amass capital, do not pose
the threat or appearance of corruption,'' the appeals court said.
   The appeals court relied heavily on a 1986 Supreme Court
decision limiting the federal government's power to regulate
corporate political spending.
   The justices said then that the Federal Election Campaign Act of
1971 violates freedom of speech when applied to corporations formed
primarily to influence public opinion, not to make a profit.
   The high court ruled in favor of a Massachusetts group formed to
protest the legalization of abortion.
   The 1986 ruling said corporations formed to promote political
ideas, that have no shareholders and are not established by
business corporations or labor unions, should not be subject to the
federal campaign spending law.
   The 6th Circuit court said the Michigan Chamber of Commerce fits
that description.
   The appeals court also said there was no danger the chamber's
corporate members will use the business group ``as a conduit for
massive undisclosed corporate political spending.''
   Anyone contributing more than $100 to a political candidate _
through the chamber or otherwise _ still must file a report
disclosing that spending under state law, the appeals court said.
   In a dissenting opinion, Judge Gilbert Merritt said the ruling
allows corporate giants, such as General Motors, Ford and Chrysler,
to funnel large sums of money through the chamber to favorite
candidates without revealing the spending.
   The Federal Election Commission joined Michigan officials in
urging the Supreme Court to overturn the appeals court ruling.
   The decision, if applied to federal law, ``would substantially
undermine congressionally mandated limitations upon the use of
corporate wealth to influence the outcome of federal elections,''
the FEC said.
   The case is Austin vs. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 88-1569.

<HEAD>Missing American Woman Found After Televised Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. sailor who disappeared from a military base
in Naples nine months ago was found alive today, hours after her
father made a televised appeal for information on her fate, Italian
authorities said.
   A highway patrolman spotted Jennifer Muir, 22, a U.S. Navy petty
officer third class, on a roadside outside Villa San Giovanni in
southern Calabria about 4 a.m. and recognized her from a magazine
article previewing the television program, said police Col.
Antonino Di Vincenzo.
   Ms. Muir's father, Thomas Muir, an IBM engineer from Trumbull,
Conn., appeared on the state-run RAI-TV Sunday night on the
premiere of a show that decribes missing persons and appeals for
help in finding them.
   Italian police had suspected foul play in her disappearance.
   ``She's fine and has been reunited with her father,'' said Di
Vincenzo from his office in police headquarters in Reggio Calabria.
   He said the woman had apparently been living for some time in
Villa San Giovanni with a man.
   In Naples, Navy spokesman Lt. Paul Weishaupt said Italian
authorities informed the Navy they took an American woman into
custody who identified herself as Jennifer Muir.
   He said U.S. investigators haven't seen her yet but that she
answered questions by telephone ``that indicate very strongly she
is indeed Jennifer Muir.''
   Ms. Muir, assigned to the U.S. Military Sealift Command in
Naples, disappeared July 29, 1988.
   In October, an Italian magistrate named an American seaman as
being a suspect in her murder and the concealment of a body. He
later was turned over to American custody. No charges have been
filed, according to Weishaupt.
   The Navy spokesman said the woman was being brought to Naples
where she would first be questioned by an Italian magistrate before
being turned over to U.S. military officials.

<HEAD>Court to Study Goodyear's Use of Foreign Laws to Ease Tax Bite</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to hear a Bush
administration appeal aimed at allowing the government to collect
potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes from
multinational corporations.
   In a case involving Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., the court said
it will review a ruling that allows multinationals to use foreign
tax laws to reduce their U.S. taxes.
   The case stems from operations of Goodyear's British subsidiary
in the early 1970s.
   The Ohio-based corporation's subsidiary incurred net losses in
1972 and 1973 _ at least under British tax law. The subsidiary's
1973 loss included British tax deductions that were not allowed
under American tax law.
   As a result, the British government refunded to the subsidiary
the tax payments it made there for 1970 and 1971.
   The refunds prompted the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to
recompute the taxes it said Goodyear owed in this country.
   Multinationals are entitled to claim a share of taxes paid by
subsidiaries overseas as credits against U.S. taxes.
   In the Goodyear case, since American law did not recognize the
1973 deductions permitted the company in Great Britain the
corporation's loss was converted into a profit.
   The redetermination had the further effect of wiping out, for
U.S. tax purposes, the foreign tax credits previously allowed in
1970 and 1971.
   As a result, the IRS assessed Goodyear $791,240 in taxes and
interest for 1970 and 1971.
   Goodyear then sued in the U.S. Claims Court, saying the IRS
erred in applying American law instead of British law to determine
the company's accumulated profits.
   The claims court ruled against Goodyear. But a federal appeals
court here reversed the decision last August.
   The appeals court said a multinational company is entitled to
use a foreign nation's tax laws to determine accumulated profits
made by a subsidiary in that country.
   Administration officials said the ruling could have ``enormous
importance'' for U.S. tax revenues.
   Justice Department lawyers, in the appeal acted on today, said
more than 25,000 foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies are doing
business in more than 100 countries. The government said its most
recent figures show the companies claimed more than $9 billion in
foreign tax credits in 1982.
   The IRS is reviewing $150 million in claimed refunds in such
cases and expects the appeals court ruling will prompt an
additional $750 million in refund claims.
   The government appeal conceded that the impact of the appeals
court ruling has been blunted by a 1986 change in U.S. tax law that
may mean multinationals no longer will be able to use a foreign
country's calculation of its accumulated profits for most future
tax payments here.
   The case is U.S. vs. Goodyear, 88-1474.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Looks At Synanon Tax Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today appeared to clear the
way for a federal trial against nine current and former Synanon
Foundation figures accused of illegally conspiring to regain the
group's tax-exempt status.
   The justices sent the case back to a federal appeals court for
restudy in light of their March 28 ruling that criminal defendants
may not immediately appeal a judge's refusal to dismiss an
indictment for alleged grand jury abuses by prosecutors.
   The Synanon Foundation figures had sought to throw out an
indictment that charges them with destroying evidence of violent
activities at the California-based organization.
   The defendants said the 1985 indictment should be dismissed
because of prosecutorial misconduct.
   Synanon was founded by Charles Dederich some 30 years ago as a
non-profit center for rehabilitating drug and alcohol users. In the
late 1970s it became embroiled in allegations of violence, threats,
and harassment of former members and opponents.
   Dederich has been accused of converting the organization into a
violent cult. In October 1978, Paul Morantz, a California lawyer
representing two former Synanon members in a suit against Synanon,
was bitten by a rattlesnake he found in his mailbox.
   Dederich and two other Synanon members pleaded no contest to
charges of conspiracy to murder Morantz.
   The indictment involved in the case acted on today did not name
Dederich. But it said nine others, including his daughter, Cecelia
Jason Dederich, altered or destroyed evidence that could undermine
Synanon's claim to be a charitable, non-violent foundation.
   The indictment said they plotted to deceive the Internal Revenue
Service, which had revoked Synanon's tax-exempt status. The
foundation, later called Synanon Church, faces millions of dollars
in tax liens.
   The indictment said destroyed documents and tapes had evidence
of violence against perceived enemies of Synanon, acquisition of an
arsenal of guns, diversion of Synanon money into private hands and
so-called ``love matches'' and other activities of sexual
promiscuity.
   The nine defendants said the government engaged in misconduct by
using University of California Professor Richard Ofshe as a witness
before the grand jury that indicted them.
   The grand jury was not told that Ofshe was suing Synanon for
millions of dollars and that Ofshe was allowed to listen to tape
recordings to help identify individuals who were indicted, the
defendants said.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last July said, ``The
prosecutor's failure to disclose Ofshe's source of potential bias
was a breach of duty to the grand jury. However, it does not by
itself justify dismissal of the indictment.''
   The other defendants named in the indictment are Synanon counsel
Philip C. Bourdette, former counsel Dan L. Garrett Jr., David
Benjamin, Elizabeth Missakian, Steven Simon, Miriam Bourdette, Dan
Sorkin, and Sybil Schiff.
   The case is Benjamin vs. U.S., 88-1290.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Licensing Fees for Nuclear Plants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today allowed the government
to impose annual licensing fees of around $1 million for nuclear
power plants.
   The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal by 29
companies that own or operate nuclear reactors.
   The licensing fee for nuclear plants was adopted by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission under a 1986 budget bill passed by Congress.
   The measure, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act,
authorizes the NRC to pay for one-third of its annual budget by
assessing such fees.
   The commission imposed a fee of $950,000 last year on each
holder of a nuclear plant license. The fee is expected to be more
than $1 million for the current fiscal year.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here upheld the fee last May.
The appeals court rejected arguments that the fee should be tied
directly to services the NRC performs for the benefit of a
particular nuclear plant.
   The appeals court also said the fee is a constitutional
delegation of Congress' power to impose taxes.
   The appeals court said Congress may delegate ``the tax power
where adequate standards are set for implementation of
congressional intent.''
   The fee bears a reasonable relationship to regulatory services
performed by the NRC, the appeals court added.
   The justices last week unanimously upheld federal ``safety user
fees'' imposed on pipelines that transport natural gas and
hazardous liquids.
   The case acted on today is Florida Power &amp; Light vs. U.S.,
88-234.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Refuses To Hear Hawaiian Asbestos Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to hear an
appeal by Hawaii officials seeking to recover from asbestos
manufacturers the cost of removing the product from public schools
in the state.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings from Pennsylvania
that included Hawaii in a so-called class-action settlement of
claims against the asbestos companies.
   Hawaii officials said they were not given a proper opportunity
to remove themselves from the class-action court settlement in
which thousands of school districts are eligible to receive money
from an asbestos clean-up fund.
   Hawaii wants to be excused from the general lawsuit so that it
can sue two manufacturers, Proko Industries Inc. and Owens-Illinois
Inc., for millions of dollars in Hawaii state courts.
   Hawaii officials said they first learned of the class-action
settlement pending before a federal judge in Pennsylvania in May
1987.
   At that time, they were told they had until Aug. 1, 1987, to
notify the judge they did not wish to be a part of the settlement
group, thereby preserving their right to sue separately.
   The officials said they were not alerted to a change in the
deadline that moved it up to June 22, 1987, and later extended for
a month. As a result, they said, they failed to notify the federal
judge that they wished to opt out of the settlement.
   The officials also contended that the settlement violates the
Constitution's 11th Amendment that limits federal court authority
over states.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals based in Philadelphia
ruled against Hawaii last October.
   The case is Hawaii vs. Proko Industries, 88-1484.

   The publisher of two sports magazines, Football
News and Basketball Weekly, has apologized for remarks he wrote
belittling the dedication of black athletes.
   ``I regret sending the letter and apologize to all those people
who were offended by its contents,'' publisher Roger Stanton said
Sunday. ``This is not the real Roger Stanton talking.''
   Stanton's statement came after a letter Stanton wrote to NBC
anchorman Tom Brokaw was published by the Detroit Free Press. The
two-page note discussed the recently broadcast NBC program called
``Black Athletes: Fact and Fiction.''
   In the letter, Stanton, 60, said the network avoided the points
that black athletes ``lack discipline'' and are more prone to
``emotional swings than the white athlete,'' and ``are not willing
to pay the price'' to succeed in professions other than in sports.
   The newspaper said that Stanton had sent a copy of the letter to
its sports broadcasting columnist. Stanton admitted sending the
letter but said he never intended for it to be published.
   Stanton cited his record as a sports publisher in his apology.
   ``For the entire 40 years of my sports journalism career, I have
been fair to everyone, and my publications, Football News and
Basketball Weekly, have given fair treatment to all athletes,
coaches and administrators, regardless or race, creed or color,''
Stanton said.
   Football News, which Stanton took over in 1962, publishes 20
times a year and lists a paid circulation of 150,000 per year.
Basketball Weekly has a circulation of 40,000.

<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge today set a July 10 trial
date for a former CIA agent charged with lying to obstruct
inquiries into his role in the Iran-Contra affair.
   U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton scheduled the trial after
Joseph F. Fernandez pleaded innocent to four charges that he lied
and obstructed the inquiries of a presidential commission and the
CIA's inspector general.
   Fernandez, who operated under the pseudonym Tomas Castillo when
he was the CIA's station chief in Costa Rica, was allowed to post a
$1,000 personal-recognizance bond pending trial.
   The former CIA agent is accused of lying about his role in
setting up an airstrip in Costa Rica used for transhipping supplies
to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   The indictment charges that the false statements obstructed
inquiries by the presidential Iran-Contra commission headed by
former Sen. John Tower, R-Texas, and the CIA's inspector general.
   Each of the four charges carries a five-year prison sentence and
a $250,000 fine upon conviction.
   An indictment brought last year against Fernandez in Washington
was dismissed last fall after prosecutors conceded that the proper
jurisdiction for the case was across the Potomac River in Virginia.
   The charges arise from statements Fernandez made during
questioning at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va.
   Fernandez was arraigned as a federal court jury in Washington
was preparing to resume deliberating 12 related Iran-Contra charges
against former National Security Council aide Oliver L. North.

   The Israeli army has released a
Palestinian-American who was detained for more than two weeks
without charge or trial, his lawyer and a U.S. consular official
said today.
   Jafer Hamayel, 25, an accounting student at Puerto Rico's
Inter-American University, was freed Friday, said Donna Sherman, an
official at the U.S. Consulate in Arab east Jerusalem.
   Hamayel disappeared April 13 after being summoned to the Israeli
military headquarters in the occupied West Bank town of Ramallah.
Israeli authorities never confirmed Hamayel's detention to his
family, his lawyer or U.S. officials.
   He was one of two American citizens in Israeli custody.
   The other Palestinian-American, 15-year-old Mansour Abed
Al-Samad, pleaded innocent Sunday to charges of stoning an army
patrol in the occupied territories. He has been in custody for
three months.
   Sherman said she was unsure why Hamayel was held and said he was
never informed of any charges. Hamayel's attorney, Jonathan Kuttab,
confirmed his client's release and said he also did not know why he
was held.
   The Israeli army said they have no record of Hamayel's detention
and thus could not comment on the case.
   Hamayel, a native of Kufr Malik north of Jerusalem, obtained
U.S. citizenship several months ago after spending the last six
years in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where his parents have lived since
1966.
   Before he left the West Bank in 1983, he spent three months in
prison for raising illegal Palestinian flags and scribbling PLO
slogans on walls.
   On April 4 he returned to renew his Israeli-issued identity
card, without which he would lose his right to live in the West
Bank.
   He was summoned to military headquarters in nearby Ramallah, and
a local man said later he saw Hamayel being held in a tent jail at
the headquarters.

   The Disney-MGM Studios theme park
opened to the public today with a ceremony complete with comedian
Bob Hope and a shower of gifts for the first family to enter the
$400 million attraction.
   ``It's overwhelming. We never expected anything like this,''
said Allan Gutierrez of York, Pa., who camped outside the
turnstiles with his family since 2 a.m., six hours before the gates
opened.
   Gutierrez, his wife, two teen-age daughters and father-in-law
were honored by Hope and Disney Chairman Michael Eisner at an
outdoor stage at the end of re-created Hollywood Boulevard and in
front of the Chinese Theater.
   Costumed performers sang and danced, several hundred white doves
were released overhead and fireworks lit up the cloudy skies as the
Gutierrez family was introduced to opening-day visitors.
   There were no official estimates of the crowd, but Disney had
anticipated that by the end of the day today, at least 15,000
people would visit the attraction blending movie and TV production
with a backstage tour and other activities for the public.
   The theme of the park is the golden age of Hollywood in the
1930s and 1940s. It is Walt Disney World's third major attraction,
after the original Magic Kingdom and Epcot Center nearby.
   Hope quipped that this was ``the largest theme park run by
actors and cartoon characters _ unless you want to count
Washington, D.C.''
   The Gutierrez family received lifetime passes to Disney
attractions worldwide, silver-colored Mickey Mouse ears and a
9-inch statuette called Mouse-ker, patterned after moviedom's Oscar
award.
   ``We didn't known anything about a first family. We just wanted
to be here early to be sure and see everything today before we go
home,'' said Mrs. Gutierrez.
   Eisner told the crowd that the park is ``dedicated to Hollywood
... a world that never was and always will be.''

   The judge at Oliver North's trial said today
the news media's attempt to force disclosure of a sealed document
concerning a 1985 missile shipment may imperil the case against the
former White House aide.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell commented at a hearing
shortly before the jury of nine women and three men began its ninth
day of deliberations
   At a hearing, Gesell said he thinks the issues raised by 10 news
organizations seeking access to the document are ``very, very
broad.''
   ``If you prevail in this matter,'' Gesell told a lawyer for the
10 news organizations, ``one possibility is I must discharge the
jury.''
   At issue is a stipulation summarizing highly secret intelligence
intercepts that tracked a CIA-assisted November 1985 shipment of
Hawk missiles to Iran. The intercepts were gathered by the National
Security Agency.
   North's lawyers used the document in his defense, referring to
it in open court. In a highly unusual move, the document was given
to the jury for its deliberations, but Gesell has kept it under
seal from the public. Ten news organizations, including The
Associated Press, went to court April 21 in an attempt to force its
release.
   The Justice Department, acting on behalf of the U.S.
intelligence community, says release of the information would
jeoparidize national security.
   Timothy B. Dyk, representing the 10 news organizations, said the
issues raised by the matter are narrow ones and pointed out that
``only one document'' is involved.
   Gesell replied that ``it's the only document I treated this way
after 14 months of dealing with over a million documents.''
   The document shows that top U.S. officials knew at the time of
the November 1985 shipment that Hawk missiles were aboard the
aircraft.
   On April 22, Gesell rejected the disclosure motion, saying the
stipulation ``is a classified document.''
   The news organizations appealed. An appeals court panel Friday
sent the matter back to Gesell, calling for a hearing on national
security issues involved, saying it cannot make a decision without
having such a record.
   North is charged with creating a false chronology that says no
one in the U.S. government knew until January 1986 that Hawks were
aboard the November 1985 shipment.
   Part of North's defense was to show that CIA Director William
Casey and national security adviser John Poindexter were aware at
the time from the intercepts what was aboard, yet arranged the
false story that no one knew.
   North is accused of lying to Congress to cover up his role in
secretly assisting the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, and lying to the
attorney general about the diversion of funds to the Contras from
the Reagan administration's secret arms sales to Iran.
   He also faces charges that he accepted a $13,800 home security
system and converted $4,300 in traveler's checks from a Contra
leader to his own use.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge today refused to stop the
federal government from requiring Atlantic and Gulf Coast shrimpers
to equip their nets with a device intended to preserve sea turtles
in danger of extinction.
   Louisiana Attorney General William Guste had filed suit on
behalf of Gulf Coast shrimpers, who say the ``turtle excluder
devices,'' commonly called TEDs, are dangerous to pull, unnecessary
and reduce their catch.
   Environmentalists maintain the devices will help save the
endangered Kemp's ridley sea turtle from extinction by reducing the
number of turtles caught by the shrimpers.
   U.S. District Judge Patrick Carr issued his ruling today after
holding a rare telephone hearing Friday on Guste's request for a
temporary restraining order to block the requirement.
   ``Congress has the power and authority to suspend the
enforcement of the use of TEDs until further studies are made, but
chose not to do so,'' Carr wrote in his brief ruling. ``The courts
have no such power or authority.''
   ``If this law isn't changed, it will mean that the entire
shrimping industry is out of business,'' Tee John Mialjevich,
president of Concerned Shrimpers, said Saturday.
   ``It's not that we don't want to save turtles, it's that we want
to feed our families.''
   Mialjevich said his group represents 2,000 shrimpers from North
Carolina to Brownsville, Texas.
   TEDs fit into the mouth of trawls, a type of net, and have trap
doors that let turtles escape. Shrimpers argue that they are too
easily clogged with debris and that a significant portion of their
catch escapes with the turtles.
   Shrimpers won a 60-day reprieve from hefty fines that were to
have gone into effect today for boats not equipped with TEDs.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher last week told the Coast
Guard to issue only warnings through June 30 _ instead of fines of
up to $10,000 _ to violators along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts.
   Shrimpers disclaim responsibility for most of the 11,000 turtle
deaths estimated by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Administration each year.
   Ted Shepard, director of the 400-member Louisiana Shrimpers
Association, which is also fighting the TEDs, said that Kemp's sea
turtles are uncommon in the areas that his Louisiana members fish,
adding, ``They're in the Atlantic and off the coast of Florida.''
   Shrimpers have proposed alternatives, Mialjevich said, including
a $25 fee on shrimping licences each year dedicated to hatching and
growing the turtles.

   Tornadoes touched down across
the Florida Panhandle today, but no one was hurt and there was
little damage, officials said.
   One twister hit Eglin Air Force Base, a spokesman said.
   ``We've had some roofs damaged and windows blown in,'' said Lt.
Col. Sam Giammo. He said the buildings hit included aircraft
hangars, dormitories and office buildings.
   Outside the base near Florida's western tip, officials confirmed
a tornado touched down near the Valparaiso police station.
   ``The damage there was light,'' said Hank Christen, director of
emergency management for Okaloosa County. ``There was a shed
destroyed. There was a window broken and some wires down.''
   A Walton County house lost its roof, but ``as far as we know no
one was injured,'' said Angie Henderson of Walton County civil
defense. She said there were reports of trees blown down and roofs
torn off barns near DeFuniak Springs.
   Another twister hit near the Riviera subdivision in Santa Rosa
County. ``There were large trees that covered the highway and there
was some structural house damage,'' said Pat Wadkins, dispatcher
for county emergency services.

   A minister, his wife and two of their
daughters were discovered shot to death in the church parsonage as
the congregation sang hymns next door.
   ``The whole county's shook,'' said Dan Richard, 27, a member of
the Olive Branch Church of the United Brethren in Christ, where
Robert Pelley was pastor. ``People don't know whether to stay at
home alone or in groups.''
   Investigators believe the four were slain Saturday. The
one-story frame house was locked and without signs of forced entry,
said St. Joesph County sheriff's Cpl. Charles Feirrell.
   The body of Pelley, 38, was found in the hallway Sunday morning,
and the bodies of Dawn Pelley, 32, and their daughters Janel, 8,
and Jolene, 6, were discovered in a family room, Feirrell said.
   The Pelleys' three other children, ages 10, 14 and 17, were not
home when the attack occurred, police said.
   Autopsies were being conducted, and all appeared to have been
shot at close range by the same weapon, Feirrell said.
   He said today that it appeared that the attack was not a sex
crime, but ``we're not discounting anything.'' There have been no
arrests. The deaths were apparently not a murder-suicide; no weapon
was found at the scene, he said.
   ``Indications are that robbery and burglary are not the motives
of this homicide,'' Feirrell said. ``He have some ideas of a
motive, but we're not going to discuss this yet.''
   The bodies were discovered by church trustee David Hathaway on
Sunday morning as the increasingly worried members of the church
conducted services in his absence, said 48-year-old Roger Schafer,
one of the nearly 70 members of the church.
   Just as a group finished singing ``Jesus Brings Me A Song,''
Hathaway and two other parishioners who had entered the parsonage
returned with the news, Schafer said.
   Many members remained at the church into the night, watching
investigators remove the bodies and consoling each other.
   ``It's just a small country church and everyone's real close,''
said Schafer.

<HEAD>Court Says Indiana Inmate Has Right to Have Suit Tried</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today revived an Indiana
prison inmate's lawsuit, ruling unanimously that the suit should
not have been automatically ruled ``frivolous.''
   The justices said a federal trial judge was wrong in finding
Harry Williams Sr.'s suit frivolous because it failed to state a
claim on which a court could grant Williams some relief.
   Such a failure to comply with the federal rules of civil
procedure does not automatically make a lawsuit frivolous, Justice
Thurgood Marshall wrote for the court.
   Williams, an inmate at the Indiana State Reformatory, sued
various prison officials in 1986.
   His complaint said he had been diagnosed by a doctor at the
Indiana State Prison as having a small brain tumor that affected
his equilibrium and he should be excused from all work details.
   Williams' suit said that when he was transferred to the
reformatory, doctors refused to treat the tumor and officials
assigned him to do garment-manufacturing work.
   When he refused to continue working, the reformatory
disciplinary board responded by transferring him to a less
desirable cellhouse.
   The suit, however, did not allege ``deliberate indifference'' on
the part of prison doctors or officials _ a necessary allegation in
such cases when prison inmates allege cruel and unusual punishment.
   The case is Neitzke vs. Williams, 87-1882.

<HEAD>Government Extends Cease-Fire With Rebel Forces</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RODOLFO GARCIA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sandinista government has extended
for the 11th time a month-long unilateral cease-fire on offensive
operations.
   A statement from the president's press office Sunday said the
government was extending the cease-fire to achieve ``firm and
lasting peace in the region.''
   The statement, broadcast over the government-controlled Voice of
Nicaragua radio, said the extension of the cease-fire was agreed to
during meetings among the five Central American presidents in
February.
   At the two-day meeting in El Salvador, President Daniel Ortega
agreed to push for democratic reforms in his country and moved up
presidential elections by 10 months, to February 1990. The
presidents also agreed to come up with a plan for dismantling the
anti-Sandinista rebel forces, known as the Contras.
   Referring to the rebels, the government statement said extending
the cease-fire would ``create conditions for the demobilization,
relocation or repatriation of the Nicaraguans who have been
involved directly or indirectly in armed activities.''
   Some 11,000 Contra rebels, along with their families, live in
Honduran camps near the Nicaraguan border.
   Nicaragua signed a temporary cease-fire with the Contras in
March last year and the truce was to be the basis for a permanent
peace accord but talks to extend it stalled. The Sandinistas have
unilaterally extended the temporary cease-fire monthly since June,
when the original one expired.
   The government statement said the cease-fire extension ``would
not affect the general plans for defending the nation or repelling
criminal attacks by the mercenary forces, which continue to bloody
our country.''
   Despite the cease-fire, Sandinista officials and the rebels
continue to blame each other for offensive attacks.
   Meanwhile, the weekend edition of the Sandinista party newspaper
Barricada quoted Sandinista army Lt. Col. Ricardo Wheelock, chief
of intelligence, as saying fighting between government and
guerrilla forces increased in recent months.
   Wheelock told the newspaper that during the first four months of
this year, there were 403 rebel attacks, resulting in 43 Sandinista
deaths and 75 injuries. Three Sandinistas were reported missing.
   Wheelock said the rebel forces, in ``attacks they have
provoked'', have suffered 193 deaths. He said the Sandinista army
captured another 89 rebels during the four-month period.

<HEAD>High Court Says Lawyers Can't Be Forced In Non-Criminal Federal Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers may not be forced by federal law to
represent poor people in non-criminal federal cases, the Supreme
Court ruled today.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court ruled in favor of John A. Mallard, an
attorney from rural Fairfield, Iowa, who specializes in business
cases. He had refused a federal judge's order to represent prison
inmates in a civil rights suit because he said he felt unqualified
for the assignment.
   ``We do not mean to question, let alone denigrate, lawyers'
ethical obligation to assist those who are too poor to afford
counsel,'' said Justice William J. Brennan for the court.
   ``In a time when the need for legal services among the poor is
growing and public funding for such services has not kept pace,
lawyers' ethical obligation to volunteer their time and skills ...
is manifest,'' he said.
   But Brennan said the federal law is clear: lawyers may be
requested to help _ not forced to do so.
   The federal law authorizing legal help for poor people in civil
cases specifically says a judge may ``request'' any attorney take
the case, Brennan noted.
   He was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice
Byron R. White, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens said Congress
may have used the word ``request'' but actually meant
``respectfully command.''
   ``In my opinion, Congress gave its endorsement to these judicial
requests, assuming that it would be unthinkable for a lawyer to
decline without an adequate reason,'' Stevens said.
   He was joined by Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun
and Sandra Day O'Connor.
   Mallard, who argued his own case before the high court last
February, had been ordered to represent two current inmates and a
former inmate at the Iowa state prison in Fort Madison.
   The inmates said prison guards and officials filed false
disciplinary reports against them, physically mistreated them and
endangered their lives by revealing they were informants.
   A federal judge picked Mallard in 1987 to represent them from a
list of more than 100 lawyers compiled by the Legal Services Corp.
of Iowa and the state's bar association.
   In addition to saying he lacked experience in trial work,
Mallard said the federal courts do not have power to require an
unwilling attorney to represent someone in a civil case.
   The possible penalties Mallard faced for his refusal to take the
prison cases were not discussed. But presumably he could have been
held in contempt and fined or even jailed had the Supreme Court
rejected his appeal.
   Courts routinely assign lawyers to represent indigent defendants
in criminal cases and the lawyers are paid, at taxpayer expense,
generally a fraction of what they would receive normally.
   In civil rights cases, lawyers are paid expenses and may receive
a share of any damages won by their clients.
   U.S. District Harold D. Vietor had denied Mallard's motion to be
excused from the inmates' suit. The judge said Mallard was
competent and had trial experience.
   The case is Mallard vs. U.S. District Court, 87-1490.

   A funeral today for a brain-damaged baby who died
after his father disconnected his respirator has stirred memories
among parents who have faced the impending death of a youngster
they know will never get well.
   Samuel Linares, who had been severely brain-damaged and comatose
since swallowing a balloon last August at a birthday party, was
remembered at a private visitation Sunday and a funeral today
attended by about 80 mourners.
   The 16-month-old's father, Rudy Linares, is charged with
first-degree murder. Police say Linares, 23, held off hospital
workers at gunpoint, unhooked his son's respirator and cradled the
boy until he died.
   He said later that he did it `` because I loved my son ... I
love my wife.''
   Free on bond, Linares attended the boy's private funeral today
at Mary Queen of Heaven Church in suburban Cicero. He and his wife,
Tamara, sat in the front pew with their other two small children.
   ``Over and over again, we ask why, and there is no answer. Not
all the priests, all the bishops, all the popes, all the moralists,
can answer the question why,'' the Rev. John R. Price said in his
eulogy.
   The boy's death has prompted an outpouring of calls from parents
whose children have died. Though some said they were disturbed by
Linares' methods, many sympathized with the emotions that drove him.
   And the boy's physician, Dr. Gilbert Goldman, director of the
pediatric intensive care unit at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's
Medical Center, said mercy should be used in dealing with the
father.
   ``I kept telling the dad (Linares), `I know it's terrible, but
it won't last much longer'' Goldman said of the boy's coma. He said
Samuel beat medical odds by staying alive so long.
   Susan Maher, a parent, said she understands what Linares went
through during those months. Her daughter, Elizabeth, spent the
first two years of her life at the University of Illinois Hospital
in Chicago, the victim of cerebral palsy and chronic lung disease.
   Ms. Maher said there were times she considered unplugging
Elizabeth's life-support equipment.
   ``A lot of times there is hardly anybody else in the hospital
unit,'' she said. ``You could do it. It enters your mind when you
feel you're being selfish by making a child suffer.''
   Ms. Maher didn't do it and Elizabeth, now 7, lives at home with
the aid of a ventilator.
   Ms. Maher said she hopes Linares' wife, Tamara, ``understands
her husband. What they have now is each other. They will have to
really love each other very much right now.''

   A couple's claim that a second infant
daughter was kidnapped has led to intense new scrutiny of the
unsolved 1986 abduction and death of their first daughter,
authorities say.
   ``What are the chances of somebody breaking into your house and
taking your small infant child once in your life? You figure out
the odds and then figure out the odds that it could happen a second
time in a completely different city,'' said Police Sgt. Billy
Lawrence. ``But I'm not trying to say anything.''
   Robert and Paula Sims reported that their 6-week-old daughter,
Heather, was missing after a masked gunman confronted Mrs. Sims
outside the family's home Saturday night, according to police.
   Mrs. Sims said the man ordered her inside and struck her
unconscious, according to a statement that police released Sunday.
   Authorities said Sims reported that he returned home from work
and found his wife unconscious. They said he revived her, found
Heather missing from her bassinet and discovered that their
15-month-old son was asleep in his room.
   In the previous case, Mrs. Sims reported that a masked gunman
entered her home on the night of June 17, 1986, ordered her to lie
down and took her 13-day-old daughter, Loralei.
   Loralei's remains were discovered five days later in woods about
150 feet from the couple's home in the Jersey County town of
Brighton, about 10 miles from Alton. No cause of death was ever
determined and no one was ever arrested, authorities said.
   At the time of both abductions, Sims was at work, the couple
told police.
   Jersey County Sheriff Frank Yocom said investigators took the
first case to a grand jury, and the Simses both invoked their
rights against self-incrimination under the Constitution's Fifth
Amendment.
   Lawrence said police ``were up all night'' Saturday
investigating the new report.
   Asked about the similarity of the abduction accounts by Mrs.
Sims, Lawrence said: ``You can read one and know what the other one
said.''
   Mrs. Sims, 27 at the time of the first abduction, and her
husband, then 34, have an unlisted telephone number and could not
be reached for comment.

   Police today charged a 22-year-old
civil servant with murdering a man during a 15-minute shooting
spree in an English coastal town. Fourteen other people were
injured in the rampage.
   Police said Robert Sartin was charged with killing 41-year-old
Kenneth Mackintosh. They said Sartin would appear in magistrates
court later today.
   Witnesses said the gunman strolled through the streets of
Monkseaton, a fashionable suburb of the Whitley Bay seaside resort
in northeast England, firing a double-barreled shotgun at anyone
within range.
   The victims Sunday included several churchgoers returning home,
a cyclist, a couple driving by in a car, a man mowing his lawn, a
woman who opened her front door and others who peered out their
windows, officials said.
   North Tyneside Hospital spokesman Michael Scargill said six of
those wounded were hospitalized, three in serious condition.
   The first ambulance officers on the scene came under fire.
   ``He was having a go at any person he met,'' said Ken Heads,
superintendent of the Northumbria ambulance service.
   ``I have never seen anyone so calm and totally in control _ he
was like a robot,'' said a resident, 40-year-old Jane Boyd.
   Witnesses said the gunman was dressed all in black, with dark
sunglasses and his hair in a pony tail. They said he wore an
ammunition belt around his waist, had a hunting knife strapped to
one leg, and stalked the streets, pausing only to shoot and reload.
   The gunman, who had driven to the suburb just before midday,
drove away after the rampage. An unarmed policeman chased him in an
unmarked car and arrested him without incident outside a pub.
   News reports said the suspect lived with his parents a mile from
the shooting scene. A policeman stood guard outside their home
today.
   Press Association, the British news agency, quoted the gunman's
brother as saying ``All I can say is that he is such a loving and
caring lad.'' The agency did not identify the brother.
   The tabloid Sun said the gunman regularly went clay-pigeon
shooting with his father and quoted a neighbor identified as Harry
Stephenson as saying, ``You couldn't hope to meet a more pleasant
young man.''
   Police said Mackintosh was a telephone company employee who was
married and had two children. He was returning from church when he
was gunned down.
   ``He just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time,''
Detective Superintendent Bob Bention told a news conference today.
``The man who was killed was not known to the gunman and we believe
the same applies to the people who have been injured.''
   Eric Holloway, a 47-year-old engineer, said he and his wife,
Heather, and son, Adam, 6, were driving in their car when the
gunman took aim at them. They escaped injury.
   ``He was as cool as a cucumber, sauntering along as though he
was out for a stroll,'' Holloway said.
   The Rev. Tom Grant said parishioners leaving his morning service
at St. Andrew's United Reformed Church heard a shot and saw a woman
fall to the ground opposite the church.
   One parishioner tried to help the woman but was forced to run
for cover when more shots were heard, Grant said.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, the Cabinet minister responsible
for law and order, ordered a full report on the incident from
police, and the Police Federation called for even tighter gun
control laws.
   The rampage was similar to the massacre of 16 people in the
southern town of Hungerford on Aug. 19, 1987, by Michael Ryan, who
killed himself after being trapped by police.
   The bloodbath shocked Britain, where most police are not armed.
Britain's already strict gun control laws later were tightened to
outlaw sawed-off shotguns, mortars and semiautomatic rifles like
the one Ryan used.
   Police said the gun used in Sunday's shooting was licensed, but
not to the gunman.

Dan Quayle, spent the day on her own, visiting a 9th century
Buddhist temple, a sultan's palace and two projects that deal with
preventing natural and ecological disasters.
   On her first trip overseas with her husband, Mrs. Quayle has
highlighted the issue she hopes to spotlight _ disasters.
   ``It is something that strikes a chord,'' Mrs. Quayle said,
explaining that Americans have often reached out to people
suffering from natural disasters.
   The 39-year-old Mrs. Quayle is trained as a lawyer, a profession
she says she thinks of going back to but that might be doubtful
while her husband holds the vice presidency, she said.
   But Mrs. Quayle said she intends in her new role to ``dispel the
myth that went on for so long that when you put a wedding ring on
... the brain stops,'' she said.
   Before she decided to adopt disasters as her focus of interest,
Mrs. Quayle said she talked with first lady Barbara Bush. ``The
only person I talked to was the most important person, Barbara
Bush,'' Mrs. Quayle said.
   She added that Mrs. Bush was encouraging about her interest and,
``Basically, she said, go for it.''
   Asked if she feared upstaging Mrs. Bush, Mrs. Quayle said, ``How
can you overshadow her, really.''
   Mrs. Quayle told reporters traveling with her to this city in
the middle of Java Island that she hopes to educate Americans
around the country about disaster relief, but she has to watch her
dollars and cents.
   ``I have no official capacity, nobody pays for me. ... I don't
have a plane, I don't have anything,'' she said. So, Mrs. Quayle
said, she would try to make speeches in the United States when
invited by various groups.
   In this bustling city, Mrs. Quayle visited a center where people
are trained to cope with volcanic eruptions. Indonesia, a densely
populated nation of islands, has about 130 active volcanoes, 18
percent of the world's.
   Then she stopped by a village where the local people, many of
them young children, cheered and clapped. The village, Keji, is the
site of a project funded by the U.S. Agency for International
Development where villagers are taught to recognize insects that
naturally destroy those bugs that damage crops.
   Officials explained to Mrs. Quayle how the ladybug, for
instance, is the farmer's friend.
   Clare Wolfowitz, wife of U.S. Ambassador Paul Wolfowitz, called
Mrs. Quayle's visit ``a tremendous shot in the arm for officials
promoting economic development in Indonesia.''
   ``Our AID people were excited to have her see this at the top of
the list,'' Mrs. Wolfowitz said.
   Then Mrs. Quayle toured the 9th century Buddhist temple at
Bobobudur, which has 10 terraces and is considered one of the
greatest Buddhist temples in the world.
   Mrs. Quayle also toured the palace of a sultan here, viewing his
daggers, hand-carved puppets and elaborate belts, among other
things.
   Quayle, who remained in Jakarta for high-level meetings with
government officials, was jealous of her schedule, Mrs. Quayle
said. When Quayle saw her itinerary, she said he said, ``Can't I
come?''

   Flash floods that have struck central South
Yemen since March 19 have killed 53 people and injured 50, it was
reported Monday.
   It was the first official casualty toll cited in the three weeks
of intermittent flooding, the worst in years to hit the
impoverished Red Sea state.
   Mohammed Salem Badinar, secretary of the South Yemen parliament,
told the Qatari newspaper Al-Raya that 3,066 houses and 625 miles
of roads were destroyed in the flooding. In addition, about 48,000
acres of farm land were inundated, destroying 60 percent of the
grain and fruit crop, Badinar said.
   He did not say how many were left homeless by the floods.
Earlier reports from South Yemen put the number of homeless at
between 50,000 and 100,000.

<HEAD>Labor Dept. Proposes $1.15 Million In Fines For Explosion That Killed

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Labor Department today cited two
contractors for safety and health violations and proposed $1.15
million in fines for a methane gas explosion that killed three
workers in a sewer tunnel project.
   S.A. Healy of McCook, Ill., the main contractor for the project,
was cited for 68 willful violations carrying fines of $680,000 in
connection with last November's fatal blast. CH2M Hill, of
Corvallis, Ore., hired to supervise the project, was cited for 47
willful violations carrying penalties of $470,000.
   Both companies have 15 days to appeal the citations and
penalties to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration,
said Mike Connors, regional administrator of OSHA's Chicago office.
   The proposed fine of $10,000 per willful violation was the
maximum allowed, Connors said.
   Willful violations are the most serious issued by OSHA and are
based on a finding that the contractors knew that a dangerous
condition violated safety standards and made no effort to correct
it, Connors said.
   ``These penalties are one of the largest I am aware of for the
region and certainly the largest that I am aware of for a tunnel
project,'' he said.
   OSHA investigators believe they have located the exact cause of
the Nov. 10 explosion but Connors declined to release that
information, citing concerns about future litigation.
   Criminal negligence charges could also be filed against the
contractors, he said.
   The citations accused the two contractors of failing to train
workers about the proper response when methane is detected in a
tunnel, using inappropriate electrical equipment and wiring methods
for a ``gassy'' tunnel, failing to have adequate ventilation for
the tunnel, and keeping inadeqauate records of air monitoring in
the tunnel.
   OSHA's investigation concluded that the two contractors were
directly responsible for the deaths of the three workers, he said.

   Five boys were charged with killing a
9-year-old classmate who refused to give them his pocket money,
police said Monday.
   The youths grabbed Suh Kwang-chan outside his school in rural
Kohung on Friday and demanded he give them the equivalent of 15
cents, police said. When Suh refused, they tied his hands, took him
to a mountain, beat him with bamboo sticks and buried him alive,
police said.
   Suh died of suffocation and his body was found by a villager,
police said.
   The names of the accused were withheld and police said they
would be dealt with in juvenile courts.
   Newspapers quoted Suh's mother, Shin Dong-shim, as saying her
son had been afraid to go to school because of bullying from other
children. She said Suh complained his classmates had tried to force
him to hand over pocket money or steal, news reports said.

   Rallies turned into riots today in Turkey, South Korea and the
Philippines and dozens of marchers were arrested in Czechoslovakia
as workers worldwide took part in May Day celebrations.
   Chinese authorities urged workers to refrain from joining
pro-democracy unrest, the Soviets held their traditional parade in
Red Square and anti-government protesters in Poland clashed with
police in Wroclaw and Gdansk.
   In Turkey, 36 people were injured in battles with security
forces during outlawed May Day marches in Istanbul, the Anatolia
news agency reported.
   An 18-year-old man's brain stopped functioning after he was shot
in the head during the protest, a hospital official said. Earlier,
the man was reported dead.
   The agency said police fired in the air when they were attacked
by a group of stone-hurling protesters in Taksim square. Officials
banned the holiday because they said it is a Marxist tradition.
   In the Philippines, baton-wielding police fired tear gas to
break up crowds trying to march to the U.S. Embassy in Manila after
a rally in which union leaders threatened a nationwide strike to
press for a higher minimum wage.
   In South Korea, riot police firing tear gas battled about 5,000
striking workers in Masan and nearby Changwon after protesters
tried to stage a May Day rally, police said. About 20 workers were
arrested.
   
   Police said about 6,600 people were arrested in Seoul after
police blocked a rally Sunday called by labor groups to mark May
Day.
   In Czechoslovakia, at least three dozen people were arrested
today during anti-government protests during the Communist party's
May Day parade in Prague.
   Protests erupted at the start and end of the official May Day
rally addressed by Communist leader Milos Jakes, with at least 600
people demanding more freedom and the release of political
prisoners.
   One protester was arrested as he carried a poster of Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. British Broadcasting Corp.
correspondent Misha Glenny was arrested during the protest, held
five hours and fined $10 for not carrying identification papers.
   In Poland, an estimated 70,000 to 100,000 Solidarity supporters
celebrated the legalization of their once-outlawed labor movement
and a new series of social reforms with a huge victory parade in
Warsaw to mark May Day.
   About 20,000 people showed up for the more subdued official
observances nearby.
   In Wroclaw, police with clubs used tear gas and water cannons to
break up a rally organized by the militant splinter group Fighting
Solidarity and the banned Polish Socialist Party-Democratic
Revolution, said an opposition spokeswoman, Maria Pinior, in that
city.
   In Gdansk, baton-swinging riot squads attacked a protesters from
several banned groups who were taking part in a rally, said
Solidarity spokeswoman Joanna Wojciechowicz. She said street
fighting lasted several hours.
   In West Germany, about 1,000 leftist protesters hurled rocks at
police, smashed car windows and looted stores in West Berlin on
Monday in a violent May Day demonstration.
   Elsewhere in the country, union leaders said more than 600,000
people turned out for peaceful trade union-sponsored May Day
rallies nationwide.
   In East Berlin, at least five dissidents were reported arrested
in Communist East Germany for staging demonstrations alongside
official celebrations, dissident sources said.
   In China, where authorities are struggling with a student
movement for democratic reforms, the Communist Party marked May day
by appealing to workers to resist forces of social instability.
   Soviets marked May Day today with a huge parade through Red
Square that focused on efforts to encourage economic growth, carry
out competitive elections and clean up the environment.
   In its broadcast of the annual workers' celebrations, state-run
television paid tribute to those killed in a pro-independence
demonstration in Soviet Georgia last month as well as to the
victims of the Armenian earthquake and a fire aboard a nuclear
submarine.
   In Madrid, Spain, an estimated 300,000 Socialist and Communist
trade union members marched together today, presenting a common May
Day front against government economic policies for the first time
since the Socialists won a parliamentary majority in 1982.

   An Israeli human rights group said today that
April was the second-bloodiest month of the Palestinian revolt,
with at least 34 Palestinians killed in clashes with Israeli troops
in the occupied lands.
   A 30-year-old man was stabbed to death today in the occupied
West Bank by fellow Palestinians after being accused of
collaborating with Israel's Shin Bet security service, Arab reports
said.
   Palestinians throughout the territories held May Day
demonstrations in celebration of the international labor holiday,
and shouted pro-PLO and pro-communist slogans.
   Arab reports said four Palestinians were shot and wounded in
clashes with soldiers in the occupied Gaza Strip. The victims
included a 10-year-old boy who was shot in the head, the reports
said.
   The Jerusalem-based Israeli Information Center for Human Rights
in the Territories said 33 of the Palestinians killed in April died
of gunshot wounds suffered in clashes with troops or paramilitary
police. The other person died of beating injuries inflicted by
soldiers, it said.
   The center, founded by a number of left-wing parties and peace
movements, said the worst month of the uprising was April 1988,
when 44 Palestinians were killed.
   The center said a total of 423 Palestinians have died since the
uprising began 16 months ago to protest Israeli rule of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The Associated Press death count, based on Arab hospital
reports, also listed 34 Palestinians killed by army gunfire last
month, plus seven more killed as suspected collaborators.
   The AP count shows a total of 457 Palestinians killed in the
revolt; the figure includes Arabs killed by Palestinians as
suspected collaborators. Eighteen Israelis also have died in the
uprising.
   An army spokesman disputed the figures, saying 28 Palestinians
were killed during April and that the figure was higher in several
previous months. According to army figures, a total of 351
Palestinians have died in clashes with soldiers.
   In the West Bank city of Tulkarem today, masked youths entered a
photo studio owned by Ahed Ramini and stabbed him several times,
Arab reports and Israel radio said. The army said it was checking
Arab reports that he died on the way to the hospital.
   Ramini's death would bring to more than 40 the number of Arabs
killed as suspected collaborators during the uprising.
   Ariel Sharon, a right-wing Cabinet minister, criticized the army
for arresting a Jewish settler in the death of a 14-year-old
Palestinian during a stone-throwing clash in the West Bank city of
Hebron.
   During a Cabinet debate Sunday, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin
rejected right-wing demands that settlers be allowed to fire more
liberally when their cars are stoned.
   Sharon told army radio today: ``The detention of a Jew who was
defending his life while being attacked, under these present
cirumstances when attacks on Jews are everyday events, is something
that is grave and unnecessary.''
   ``To investigate if need be, yes. To detain, no,'' he said.
   The settler, Chaim Ben Lulu, was released on $3,880 bail today
after fellow settlers maintained a two-day vigil outside military
government headquarters in Hebron.
   Israel radio reported Ben Lulu was freed after a hearing before
Jerusalem Magistrate Dalia Koval and quoted her as saying the
settler apparently acted in self-defense when he fired his pistol
Saturday. Israeli media reports said he fired after Palestinian
youths stoned his car.
   Ben Lulu has not been charged, but remains under investigation,
police said.
   Hebron, a city of 79,000 Palestinians where settlers live in two
tiny enclaves, is a frequent site of friction between Jews and
Arabs.
   Most Jewish settlements in the occupied lands are located away
from Arab population centers. More than 70,000 settlers live in the
occupied lands amid 1.7 million Palestinians.

   An activist veterans group, contending there
still are U.S. war prisoners in Indochina, is seeking a country
that will offer asylum to anyone who brings out a living POW, a
spokesman for the group said Monday.
   Ted Sampley, head of the National Steering Committee for
American War Veterans, said the organization believes it can get an
American out within six months after asylum is guaranteed.
   The group has written officials of the Australian, British,
Canadian, New Zealand, French and Swedish embassies asking that
they offer a guarantee since the United States has not.
   U.S. officials have criticized independent efforts to find POWs
in Southeast Asia, saying they jeopardize official efforts to
resolve the POW-MIA issue.
   Two members of Sampley's organization were held prisoner for 41
days in Laos last year after they entered the country to publicize
a reward of more than $2 million offered by several members of
Congress for the safe return of a prisoner of war.
   Earlier, the veterans group put $2,000 worth of Vietnamese,
Laotian and other currency in plastic bags and floated the bags
down the Mekong River with notices of the reward.
   While U.S. officials say they have seen no proof that missing
soldiers remain alive in Vietnam, Laos or Cambodia, they do not
rule out the possibility. About 2,400 U.S. servicemen are listed as
missing in action in Southheast Asia.
   Sampley said as many as 100 still could be alive in Vietnam and
scores more in other communist-controlled countries in the region.
   He said an affiliate organization, Homecoming II, has had
contact with an officer of an Indochinese country who is willing to
bring out an American POW if he and others who would come with him
can be assured of political asylum as well as the reward.
   Sampley said he could not give the name of the officer, his
country or any other details about him for fear he might be
arrested.
   The American would be brought out within 180 days after asylum
is guaranteed, said Sampley, who has a construction business in
Kinston, N.C.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, brought down by a
scandal that reached the top of business and politics, is expected
to ask former Foreign Minister Masayoshi Ito to replace him,
government sources said Monday.
   Takeshita said a week ago he would resign, but the choice of a
successor as leader of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, and
thus as prime minister, has been put off until he returns Sunday
from a nine-day trip to Southeast Asia.
   After Takeshita's announcement, party secretary-general Shintaro
Abe and Keizo Obuchi, the chief Cabinet secretary, informally asked
Ito to take the job. Ito, who is 75 and diabetic, said he would not
take the job because of his age and health.
   The government sources said privately Monday, however, that the
party would have ``no other choice ... but to persuade'' Ito, who
they described as the only candidate on whom all party factions
could agree.
   Ito has a clean reputation and most other party leaders have
been linked to the scandal centered on Recruit Co., an information
and publishing conglomerate. He now is chairman of the Executive
Council, the party's policy-making body.
   Masaya Ito, a critic of the political scene who is not related
to the former foreign minister, said the offer of succession ``is
no more than asking him to lend his clean image without actual
political power.''
   ``It sounds to me no more than an insult for a senior politician
like Ito,'' said the critic, who was an aide to the late Prime
Minister Hayato Ikeda. ``It is apparent that the current party
leadership is trying to remain in control by appointing Ito and
other senior officials. No dignified politician would take such an
offer.''
   Whoever the Liberal Democrats choose will become prime minister
because of their large majority in Parliament. The party has
rejected opposition demands to call elections so voters can pass
judgment on the scandal and an unpopular 3 percent sales tax that
took effect April 1.
   Takeshita said he was resigning to take responsibility for the
scandal. He is to step down after Parliament passes the 1989
budget, which has been approved by the lower house.
   Fourteen people have been arrested on bribery and other charges
so far in the Recruit case, and three Cabinet members were forced
to step down before Takeshita's announcement.
   Recruit sold stocks in a subsidiary to about 160 influential
politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen at bargain prices before
the shares were offered for public sale. The price soared when the
stock went on the market and the buyers made huge profits.
   Prosecutors contend that, in some cases, the deals amounted to
bribes in exchange for favors to the company.
   The prime minister has acknowledged getting more than $1 million
in political donations from Recruit and that an aide, who committed
suicide the day after Takeshita announced his resignation, received
a loan of about $376,000 from the company.

   Thousands of prehistoric Indian
petroglyphs etched into dark, basalt rock have survived for
hundreds and hundreds of years, but time no longer is on their side.
   The once-remote volcanic ridge they adorn on Albuquerque's west
side is in danger of being swallowed by civilization.
   ``If we don't get the federal authorization from Congress this
year the pressures of development and vandalism are so intense out
there we may be losing the opportunity,'' said Ike Eastvold, a
leader in a move to have Congress create a national monument to
preserve the carvings of humans and animals. ``It really is the
11th hour.''
   Evidence of the threat to the petroglphs is all around the
17-mile escarpment, created by lava flows that began 190,000 years
ago.
   Houses and roads creep closer. One path to the area passes
mounds of rubbish. Some drawings have been marred by spray paint or
damaged by gunshots.
   The drawings are the work of early Pueblo Indians who lived in
the area between 1300 and 1650 A.D. Spanish settlers arriving the
area in the 1500s added their own petroglyphs.
   ``This is the largest concentration of rock art in the world in
a major city,'' said Eastvold.
   He said preserving the more material elements of a culture such
as architecture is not enough. ``The art and religion are what made
them live,'' Eastvold said.
   He said the petroglyphs are even more exciting because they were
done by the ancestors of the present Pueblo Indians of New Mexico
and eastern Arizona, meaning they still are part of a living
culture.
   Eastvold said the petroglyphs also are artistically appealing.
   New Mexico's two U.S. senators, Republican Pete Domenici and
Democrat Jeff Bingaman, have introduced legislation to establish
the monument.
   They conducted an Energy and Natural Resources Committee public
lands subcommittee hearing Friday in Albuquerque to hear from
federal, state and local officials, developers, conservationists
and Indian leaders.
   Those who spoke at the hearing indicated support for the
monument.
   John E. Cook, regional director of the National Park Service,
said at the hearing that if Congress fails to take action within
two years the land will become degraded to the point it could no
longer be considered for monument status.
   Eastvold, head of the group Friends of the Albuquerque
Petroglyphs, said he believes that if the national monument is not
created most of the land will be lost to development.
   ``You would probably end up with little bits and pieces
preserved in an inadequate manner,'' he said.
   The bill introduced by Domenici and Bingaman, and an identical
measure introduced in the House by Rep. Steve Schiff, R-N.M., calls
for the national monument to include 7,100 acres.
   About 4,300 acres of land already is publicly owned. The total
value of the land that would have to be acquired is estimated at
$90 million, with $50 million coming from the federal government
and the remaining $40 million from the city and state. The state
and city already have made provisions for a portion of their
commitments.
   In addition to preserving the estimated 15,000 carvings,
proponents say the monument would draw 400,000 visitors and
generate $5 million in revenue for the city and its businesses in
the first year alone.
   Domenici believes that what should be stressed is not so much
the cost of doing the project but the cost of not doing it because
the drawings would continue to be degraded until they are lost
forever.
   Bingaman agreed.
   ``I think the longer you go into the future the more important
it's going to have been that people at this time took the
opportunity to set some land aside and preserve some of these
petroglyphs,'' he said.

   The commander of a Newport-based frigate
that collided with another ship 12 days ago has been relieved of
his duties on the frigate, a Navy spokeswoman said Monday.
   Commander Lewis Athow, who was in charge of the USS Trippe, was
suspended after a preliminary investigation and temporarily
assigned to Naval Surface Group Four in Newport, spokeswoman Mary
Silvia said.
   Commander John C. Dranchak has been desginated interim
commanding officer until a permanent relief can report to the
Trippe, which would take two weeks, Silvia said.
   The Trippe collided with the USS Platte off the coast of Florida
on April 19, causing minor flooding and one minor injury to a
Platte crewman. It was during those exercises that the USS Iowa
exploded in an unrelated accident, killing 47 crewmen.
   Silva would not say why Athow was suspended. An investigation
was continuing, she said.
   The Trippe is in Charleston, S.C., for repairs.

<HEAD>Famed French Wine House Sending Recork Task Force To U.S.</HEAD>

   The legendary French wine house Chateau
Lafite-Rothschild is sending a task force to the United States to
recork _ at no charge _ older bottles of the fabulously expensive
Bordeaux.
   Starting Tuesday in New York, the experts will recork some 2,000
bottles of 1962, or older, vintages. The group also will visit
Boston, Atlanta, Miami and Dallas.
   The Lafite team, which was in San Francisco last year, took
reservations for the recorking service through next January. The
demand, said the company, was ``tremendous.''
   An 1806 vintage _ the same year Napoleon ordered the blockade of
Britain and construction of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris _ will be
among the wines to be recorked. A bottle from that year once sold
for $31,000.
   ``There is no charge for this service,'' said David S. Milligan,
president of Seagram Chateau &amp; Estate Wines Co., the major Lafite
importer in this country. ``The chateau does it as the most
remarkable after-sale service in the industry.''
   Milligan would say only that the 1806 is owned by a collector in
Boston whose identity he couldn't disclose.
   The recorking is carried out by Lafite because, as the wine
experts say, ``wine is only as good as its cork.'' Old corks can
become dry, which allows air to seep into the bottle and can cause
wine to spoil.
   Recorking is especially needed for the nobler wines of the
world, made with the view that a very good bottle may not reach the
most drinkable period for years, even decades and generations.
   A minimum of 15 years is often recommended before a given
vintage of Lafite should be consumed. The 1961 vintage, for
instance, wasn't ready for drinking until last year _ 27 years.
   ``As the Rothschilds have tended over a century of vintages at
Lafite, they have determined that their bottles should be recorked
about every 25 years or so,'' said Milligan. ``Even the finest cork
has limited lifespan, and keeping the cork in good condition is
essential to protect the wine.''

   A thief with a sweet tooth who
nabbed a painted chocolate wafer and a marzipan witch may have
bitten off more than he could chew.
   The chef said the candy is priceless, and police have classified
the case as grand theft.
   Pastry chef Anneke Jans and her mother, Phyllis Sherohman, were
gone a short time Sunday from a culinary trade show _ just long
enough for the thief to make off with Miss Jans' creations.
   The painting of a turkey on the chocolate wafer and the
5-inch-tall marzipan witch cost Miss Jans about $1,000 each in
supplies and labor. Sentimental value makes them priceless, she
said.
   ``I just fell apart when I saw (them) missing,'' said Miss Jans,

   Student protest leaders Monday blasted government
meetings with selected students as a sham, accusing officials of
trying to co-opt students without agreeing to democratic reforms.
   Student activists also said they had been warned to stop
planning a protest for May 4, the 70th anniversary of China's first
democratic movement.
   They called for the establishment of a nationwide independent
student union and indefinite continuation of the class boycott
begun last week by about 75,000 students in Beijing and nearby
Tianjin. Classes were out Monday to celebrate the May Day holiday.
   High-ranking government officials from two ministries met with
students for a third day to discuss student calls for more
democracy, the state-run radio said.
   On the steps of Beijing University's library, a spokesman for
the indepedent student association said the group had rejected the
talks.
   Meetings between the government and students began over the
weekend in a government effort to quell two weeks of student
demonstrations. The protests culminated Thursday when 150,000
students and their supporters participated in the biggest march in
40 years of communist rule.
   The students want a fundamental reform of China's tightly
controlled political system, including a free press and an end to
widespread corruption and nepotism.
   ``We demand a dialogue based on the principles of equality and
openness, conducted directly between democratically chosen student
representatives and government decision-makers,'' said the
spokesman for the United Association of Beijing Universities.
   He said the association wants the government to recognize it as
a legal entity and conduct its talks with association
representatives.
   On Saturday, two student leaders from the association were
invited to the first meeting. After that, all representatives
appear to have been from officially appointed student unions.
   On Monday, the Guangming Daily, a national newspaper for
intellectuals, praised the meetings. It called them an example of
``socialist democracy'' and said they were a way of ``clearing up
misunderstandings and suspicion.''
   Many students disagreed.
   Students particularly were upset when Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong
and city's Communist Party chief Li Ximing said they made $81 a
month, about three times the average monthly salary.
   ``They forgot to add their free cars and all their free meals,''
said one student.
   ``They also forgot their free apartments, fancy trips and
bottles of Maotai,'' said another.
   ``The government answers to student questions illustrated their
lack of sincerity,'' the association spokesman said. He accused the
government of trying to ``deceive public opinion'' by appearing to
concede to student demands.
   Student leaders at the Beijing Normal College declared on their
campus loudspeaker: ``Until we have a dialogue with the government
that meets our demands, we won't return to class.''
   ``Students, we risked bloodshed and danger to get as far as we
have,'' said a poster at the People's University. ``Please continue
your efforts.''
   On Monday, four of the seven leaders of the association, said
they were under pressure to stop organizing a protest for May 4.
   Ou Yang, a student leader from Qinghua University, said teachers
from his college on Sunday night warned him to confine his
activities to inside the Qinghua gates.
   Wu'er Kaixi, president of the association, said officials at
Beijing Normal College had informed him through friends that he
should stop his activities. He said he was afraid of arrest.
   Another two leaders said they planned to stay close to their
dormitories and restrict their organizing activities.
   A student-run loudspeaker at Wu'er's school broadcast an open
letter to his mother Monday.
   ``Mother,'' the letter went, ``I am not wrong. But perhaps for
the sake of many more mothers and fathers in the future, you might
have to lose your son.
   ``You always taught me to be courageous and speak out for my
beliefs. That is what I am doing.''
   The government harshly criticized the student movement last
week, calling it a plot to overthrow the government.
   It toned down its criticism after tens of thousands of Beijing
citizens applauded the student march Thursday, but it continues to
claim that an unspecified ``handful of people'' illegally are
plotting revolution.
   On Monday, two groups of students met with Qi Yuanjing, minister
of the Metallurgical Industry, and Lin Zhongtang, minister of the
Aeronautics and Astronautics Industry, the radio said.
   Selected students also met with State Education Minister He
Dongchang and high-ranking officials from the Beijing city
goverment.
   The meetings with government ministers were an indication of how
seriously the government regards the recent student unrest.
   The government apparently hopes it can split most of Beijing's
students from the leaders of the independent student association
and their calls for fundamental change.
   Indeed, throughout the meetings, officials have made no promises
to change state policy. They have acknowledged some student
complaints but mostly have urged students to ``calm down.''

   A long time before George and Barbara Bush
lived in the White House, they lived in a white house. Now that
house just got whiter.
   The first couple's first Midland residence was repainted over
the weekend as part of a massive home-renovation project. About
2,500 to 3,000 volunteers used more than 700 gallons of paint to
refurbish about 150 homes. The spruce-up project was the 18th
annual observance in Midland of ``Christmas in April,'' known
locally as CIA.
   The Bushes lived in the residence in the 1940s and '50s. An
elderly woman who lives there now was unable to maintain it,
organization officials say.
   ``What did Bush say about the 10,000 points of light?'' asked
the Rev. Allen Whitman of The Episcopal Church of the Holy
Trinity's Mission Outreach Council, as he stood on a ladder outside
the former Bush home. ``It's ironic a light should be at one of his
own homes.''
   Another point of light, in the form of a glob of white paint,
dried on Whitman's glasses as he spoke.

   Rosie the Duck can have her ducklings anywhere
she chooses, officials say, and the mallard has decided to set up
her nest alongside a downtown high-rise.
   Because the duck enjoys the protection of the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, she and her 12 eggs cannot be moved from a
planter near the Chicago River to a safer location. It's against
the law, at least until hunting season opens in the fall.
   ``You can't touch her, harm her, or take her,'' declared a
government agent who viewed her Friday.
   Indeed, the duck is protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act
between the United States, Mexico and Canada. Anyone who touches
the bird could be fined $2,000 or be sentenced to up to one year in
jail, said the agent.
   Some Rosie watchers had sought to move the duck to a safer, more
secluded spot along the Chicago River below.
   Tishman Speyer Properties, which owns the commercial high-rise,
ordered security guards to keep an eye on the duck after a
maintenance worker found the nest in mid-April.
   ``She seems rather calm and happy there,'' said Paul Collins, a
guard who patrols the nesting site.
   Rosie's eggs are due to hatch this week.

<HEAD>Governor: Budget Cuts Will `Go Beyond Common Sense'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY COATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Budget cuts forced by voter rejection of
a tax package will ``go beyond common sense,'' Gov. Buddy Roemer
said Monday as the administration studied closing some universities
and hospitals.
   Rejection in Saturday's referendum means the state will have a
projected $720 million deficit when the new fiscal year begins July
1, Roemer said.
   Even with passage of the package, the administration would have
been forced to cut spending by $200 million, including reducing a
charity hospital to an outpatient clinic and laying off 4,100 state
employees, Roemer said.
   ``Now we must go beyond that. The cuts will be deeper than I
wanted, deeper than common sense, but we will not do business as
usual,'' Roemer said wearily at an impromptu news conference.
   The governor referred to projecting oil prices high enough to
balance the budget on paper, a routine practice until Roemer took
office in March 1988.
   With high oil price projections, the state ended each year with
massive deficits which had accumulated to $900 million by the time
he took over.
   Each increase of $1 a barrel in the price of oil, sustained for
a year, means around $28 million in extra state tax revenue.
   Roemer said the state realistically could increase the
projection from $15 to $17 a barrel since the price of Louisiana
oil at this time is about $18, ``but you're only talking about $60
million if we do that.''
   The tradition of having oil companies and other big businesses
pay a big share of state revenues in Louisiana dates back to the
days of populist Gov. Huey Long in the 1920s and 1930s.
   Roemer's plan would have shifted the tax burden away from big
business, putting more of a load on individuals through the income
tax. It would have reduced sales taxes and given businesses
incentives to move to Louisiana and expand.
   The plan also included a $1.4 billion program to improve
highways, airports and shipping ports, funded by a gasoline tax
increase of 4 cents a gallon.
   Romer touted his plan as a way to bring jobs to Louisiana, which
has the highest unemployment rate in the nation at 9.6 percent, and
to end the state's dependence on the oil industry.
   ``We had a number of (industrial) prospects that had anticipated
fiscal reform to open new plants,'' Roemer said. ``I had to call
them this morning and talk it through. It's not all good news.
We'll hang on to what we can.''
   The Legislature could extend for another year a temporary
suspension of sales tax exemptions on food, drugs and utilities
that was put into effect last summer to stave off bankruptcy,
Roemer said. Allowing that suspension to expire on June 30 would
leave a $500 million hole in the budget, he said.
   Roemer said he didn't want to talk about specifics of what
universities or hospitals might have to be closed.
   ``You'll know as soon as we know,'' he said.
   Rep. Robert Adley, chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee and a close adviser to the governor, had said earlier in
the day that his phone ``was ringing off the hook this morning.
They're (lawmakers) scared. Reality is setting in and they don't
want to lose institutions in their districts.''
   Meanwhile, state Rep. David Duke, perhaps the most vocal
legislative opponent of the tax package, said lawmakers might want
to extend sales tax increases to avoid closure of charity hospitals
and universities.
   Throughout the tax referendum campaign, Duke said the people
``don't want any more taxes. None.''
   ``I'll hold an olive branch out to him (the governor),'' said
Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader. ``We've got to solve the
financial problems. The Legislature might be willing to restore
some of the temporary taxes if it comes to that. We still have some
time to play with this thing.''

   Ads for ``Mississippi Burning'' adorn
the lobby of the town's only theater, but the manager says there's
been little interest in the film based loosely on the 1964 slayings
of three civil rights workers nearby.
   ``I've had the advertisement up for a couple of weeks _ that
it's coming May 24 _ and I can only recall a couple of people who
had comments,'' said Shelly Steiger, whose family has owned and
operated the Ellis Theater in the town of 7,000 for 35 years.
   Mayor Charles McClain said most of the talk in town now involved
plans for a special memorial program June 21 to honor the three
civil rights workers.
   ``Mississippi Burning,'' starring Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe,
is a fictionalized account of federal investigation of the murders
of Andrew Goodman, James Earl Chaney and Michael Schwerner in
Neshoba County. Their bodies were found in an earthen dam near
Philadelphia six weeks after their deaths on June 21, 1964.
   The Orion Pictures release has received praise from movie
critics, but harsh criticism from people who were involved in the
civil rights movement, particularly blacks who see the movie giving
too much credit to the FBI.
   ``I'm sure if there were people here who were real interested in
the movie, they have already gone to a town where it has been
shown,'' said Steiger.
   The film was shown earlier this year in Jackson, about 80 miles
southwest, and in Meridian, about 40 miles east.
   Steigher said his theater seats about 500 people, which means
2,500 people could see the movie during its five-day run.
   ``Of course, that would mean a sellout every night and it's been
a long time since that has happened,'' he said.
   McClain said he also had not heard too many comments about the
movie.
   The mayor said he had seen the film and thought it ``just piled
everything on one locality when at the time it was spread out
across the state and the South.''
   He said Philadelphia had good race relations and ``I thought
they really didn't give our city a very fair presentation, even for
1964.''

   After complaining to police for nearly
four months to shut down a crack house on her block, Terri
Tillman-Brown said officers raided the wrong house _ hers.
   Police with a search warrant on Friday broke through the front
door of Tillman-Brown's home while she was away, according to
neighbors.
   The undercover officers ransacked her home, left her front door
broken and open, and her dog running free outside, Tillman-Brown
said. They also opened a sealed bag of cremated ashes she said she
had been keeping for a friend's burial. Some of the ashes spilled
onto her bed, she said.
   The police apparently found none of the cocaine and drug
paraphernalia the search warrant said they were seeking. Police
declined immediate comment.
   ``I called the police today and they told me they can't help me
till Monday,'' Tillman-Brown said over the weekend.
   Tillman-Brown, a 38-year-old accountant for the state, said the
raid occurred four days after the drug dealers were evicted from a
house next door. She said she had complained to police about the
nearby drug activity almost weekly since they moved in in January.

   Attackers ambushed a second United Nations
food convoy in southern Sudan, spraying the lead vehicle with small
arms fire, U.N. officials said Monday.
   No one was hit in Friday's attack near Kapoeta and the convoy
arrived Sunday at its destination in Torit with 300 tons of food,
said World Food Program spokesman Paul Mitchell.
   It is the second ambush of a U.N. convoy in less than two weeks
near Kapoeta, a garrison town held by the rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army.
   Eight armed rebel escorts were killed April 18 when the first
Operation Lifeline Sudan convoy to Torit was hit by a rocket and
automatic weapons fire.
   The United Nations temporarily suspended operations on the
overland route between Kapoeta and Torit, and last week's convoy
was the first to make a new attempt.
   Mitchell said they will stop using the route again and any
further supplies will be sent to Torit through Uganda.
   The $132 million operation hopes to save 100,000 lives in Sudan,
where officials estimate as many as 500,000 people died from
drought, flood and war-induced famine last year.
   U.N. officials concede that political, logistical and other
problems will prevent them delivering more than than half their
115,500-ton goal of supplies before seasonal rains cut off outlying
villages.
   Mitchell said 27 trucks set out in Friday's convoy from
Lokichoggio, in northern Kenyan, and were 12 miles outside Kapoeta
when attacked.
   ``It was small arms fire from the bush,'' Mitchell said. ``They
didn't see anybody and it's hard to say who they (the attackers)
were or how many there were.''
   Government troops for years have battled rebels demanding more
autonomy in southern Sudan, but both sides agreed in March to allow
safe passage for relief food. Other gunmen in the south include
nomadic tribal warriors and government-sponsored militiamen.
   Nils Enquist, Operation Lifeline's logistics coordinator, said
between six and 10 bullets struck the vehicle.
   ``It was carrying a driver and the convoy leader and it is only
by the grace of God they weren't hurt,'' Enquist said. ``The trucks
following the lead vehicle weren't shot at.''
   He identified the convoy leader as Gerard Vigay, a World Food
Program employee from France, and the driver as an unnamed Kenyan.
   Mitchell said the convoy halted briefly as armed rebel guards
unsuccesfully sought the attackers.

   Many Americans see Latin American communism as a
rising danger to the United States, while the threat from communism
in other nations is viewed with less alarm, a Media
General-Associated Press poll has found.
   Forty-four percent in the survey saw communism in Latin America
as more of a threat to U.S. security than it has been in the past.
Only about 15 percent said the same for the Soviet Union, China and
Eastern Europe.
   The poll's respondents said overwhelmingly that capitalism holds
greater influence than communism in the world today, 62 percent to
23 percent, with the rest undecided. But only one in five said
communism is on the decline.
   Instead, among those with an opinion, 27 percent said communism
was on the rise in the world and 46 percent said it was holding
steady. The poll of 1,108 adults March 6-15 had a 3-point margin of
error.
   With a Sino-Soviet summit planned this month, respondents said
by a narrow margin that closer relations between the Soviet Union
and China posed a threat to the United States, 49 percent to 41
percent, with the rest unsure.
   About half favored closer U.S. trade with the Soviet Union to
encourage democratic reforms there. A third were opposed on grounds
that U.S. trade would only support the current system; the rest
were undecided.
   Greater trade with the Soviets was supported equally by
Republicans and Democrats. But there was a political split on Latin
America: Conservatives and Republicans were considerably more
likely than liberals and Democrats to see communism there as an
increasing threat.
   Liberals also were more confident in another measure: 71 percent
said capitalism has more influence than communism in the world,
while just 57 percent of conservatives agreed.
   Better-educated Americans and men were more likely to perceive
changes in communism and to view communist nations as a decreasing
threat to the United States. Thirty-six percent of those with
postgraduate work said communism is on the decline, for example,
while just 13 percent of high school graduates held that view.
   The greatest agreement was on changes in communism. Seventy
percent said most communist countries are less likely now to follow
Soviet policies, and 67 percent said most communist nations are
giving their people more freedom.
   A 58 percent majority saw the Soviet Union as moving away from
its centralized communist economic system; 47 percent said the same
of China and 45 percent saw such movement in some Eastern European
nations.
   Just 7 percent said communism was less of a threat in Latin
America than it has been in the past; 30 percent rated it about the
same, 9 percent said it never has been a threat and the rest had no
answer. Marxists rule in Nicaragua; communists rule in Cuba and are
waging insurgencies in Colombia, El Salvador, Peru and other Latin
American nations.
   Communism elsewhere was viewed with less suspicion. Just 14
percent saw communism in the Soviet Union as more of a threat to
the United States than it has been in the past, while 38 percent
saw it as less of a threat.
   Similarly, Chinese communism was seen as more of a threat by 15
percent and less of a threat by 34 percent. Communism in Eastern
Europe also was seen as more of a danger by 15 percent, and as less
of one by 28 percent.

   Iran's deputy foreign minister says
Tehran soon will buy weapons from the Soviet Union and is
negotiating with other unidentified countries for advanced fighter
bombers, the government press reported Monday.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted
Ali Mohammad Besharati as saying Iran must diversify its
arms-purchasing sources.
   ``If we depend on one particular country or bloc, then they take
advantage of the situation ... They want to impose their own
ideology on us,'' he said. His comments were published in an
interview with the English-language daily Tehran Times, the agency
said.
   Besharati said in ``extensive talks'' with Soviet officials
``all related issues have been finalized.''
   He did not disclose what kind of Soviet weapons Iran will
acquire or the cost. But the Iranians are known to be seeking to
upgrade and rebuild their air force and armored divisions following
the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the eight-year war with Iraq.
   Recently, the Iranians have turned increasingly to the East bloc
for much of their military hardware as relations between Tehran and
Moscow warmed.
   Speculation the Soviets would start supplying the Iranians with
sophisticated weapons systems, possibly including aircraft and
tanks, was heightened when Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze visited Tehran in February.
   The Soviets were Iraq's main weapons supplier during the war and
are participating in a major defense exhibition in Baghdad that
ends Tuesday. But Iran purchased large amounts of Soviet-designed
weapons systems, mainly through North Korea and China.
   ``The Soviets are not prepared to go too far as far as the
Iranians are concerned,'' said Hans-Heino Kopietz, a military
specialist with the London-based International Institute for
Strategic Studies.
   ``They want to play footsy with both sides. Just how much
hardware they will provide the Iranians themselves is questionable.
They don't want to be seen to be tipping the balance, but it makes
sense that they should do something in this regard,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
   The Moscow-Tehran rapprochement was accelerated by the halt in
the gulf war and the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, where
Tehran supports Moslem guerrillass fighting Kabul's communist
government.
   Before the 1979 reolution, Iran's military was armed almost
exclusively with U.S. weaponry bought by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi
before he was toppled.
   A U.S.-led embargo did much to prevent the Iranians acquiring
spare parts and replacements for that equipment.
   By the end of the war, Iran's once-powerful air power was
reduced to an estimated 60 operational combat jets. Before the war,
Iran had 447 combat aircraft, all of them U.S.-supplied. They
included 199 F-4 Phantoms, 166 F-5 Eagles and 77 F-14 advanced
interceptors.
   The Iranian agency quoted Besharati as saying: ``We have gone
into negotiations with various countries, outside the Soviet Union,
for the purchase of fighter bombers.
   ``Very soon, you will see fighter bombers flying ... which are
other than those of the United States and the Soviet Unions,'' he
said without elaboration.
   The Iranians claim they soon will build their own combat jets.
But Western analysts believe these will be Chinese-supplied F-6 and
F-7 jets, Beijing's versions of the MiG-19 and MiG-21, shipped in
parts to be assembled in Iran.
   U.S. Defense Department sources have reported that Tehran's
links with the Warsaw Pact countries for arms supplies have
improved prospects for co-producation deals under which Iran could
build Soviet bloc weapons under license.
   They estimate Iran is spending up to $5 billion a year on its
forces.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of people marched
through the capital Monday to celebrate May Day and the rebirth of
Solidarity in the union's biggest show of strength since it
regained legal status.
   While the Warsaw march was generally peaceful, troops used
clubs, water cannons and tear gas to crush other demonstrations in
Gdansk and Wroclaw, dissident sources said. A minor clash was
reported in Warsaw later Monday.
   An estimated 100,000 people took part in the Solidarity march
from northern Warsaw and the rally afterward. The Communist Party's
official May Day rally nearby was more subdued and drew about
20,000 people.
   Red-and-white Solidarity banners vied for attention with the red
flags displayed by Communist Party faithful.
   Union supporters marched in a procession that took nearly an
hour to pass a single point. Chants of ``Down with communism!''
``Soviets go home!'' ``Free elections!'' and ``Solidarity must
win!'' echoed off the buildings of narrow streets.
   The march began with about 30,000 people and was tripled in size
by the time it reached a park on the banks of the Vistula River
near Warsaw's center.
   Participants trumpeted last month's accord with the government,
which resulted in Solidarity's legalization after an eight-year ban
and provisions allowing non-communists to participate in coming
parliamentary elections.
   Warsaw Solidarity leader Zbigniew Bujak introduced the union's
candidates to the two legislative houses.
   ``We not only can organize uprisings ... We can also build a
normal democratic order,'' he told the crowd.
   The Solidarity gathering was by far the union's biggest since it
regained legal status on April 17. Participants signed nominating
petitions for union-backed candidates to the two chambers of the
congress, the Senate and the Seijm.
   Some radical factions of Solidarity that joined the rally called
for boycotting the June elections. ``The Sejm and Senate Are Yours,
the Factories Are Ours,'' read one banner.
   But the crowd loudly booed Seweryn Jaworkski, a leader of a
splinter faction supporting a boycott, when he was allowed to
speak. The crowd instead began to chant the name of Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa.
   The government, faced with a crumbling economy, agreed to give
the Solidarity-led opposition a greater voice in order to win
workers' cooperation on economic reforms.
   ``We have entered a path of substantial reforms. We have dared
to do an extraordinary thing,'' Polish leader Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski told the participants in the official May Day rally in
Victory Square.
   ``Let's therefore close the Polish book of sorrows and
bitterness,'' he said. ``What the country needs most is peace and
joint action.''
   Police used tear gas, water cannons and clubs to crush a rally
in Wroclaw organized by the splinter group Fighting Solidarity and
the banned Polish Socialist Party-Democratic Revolution, said
opposition spokeswoman Maria Pinior.
   In Gdansk, riot police with batons attacked participants in a
rally that included several banned groups, said Solidarity
spokeswoman Joanna Wojciechowicz. The street fighting lasted for
several hours, she said.
   There was no information available on arrests or injuries.
   Earlier, at a rally of about 1,000 people in Gdanski, Walesa was
accused of betraying the movement he founded by Anna Walentynowicz,
a woman whose firing from the Gdansk shipyard caused the strike
that led to Solidarity's formation in 1980.
   Ms. Walentynowicz denounced Walesa's agreement with authorities
on social and economic reform.
   Warsaw's main Solidarity events were peaceful, but later in the
day at least one small clash took place between police and about
100 militant young marchers in central Warsaw. Police charged the
rock-throwing demonstrators and dispersed them.

   Former arms negotiator Paul Warnke criticized
the Bush administration on Monday for failing to assert leadership
and avert an argument raging in the NATO alliance over short-range
nuclear weapons.
   ``There has been no American leadership whatsoever,'' said
Warnke, and as a result, ``we have a very sharp dispute over a
silly issue.''
   Warnke, chief arms negotiator for then-President Carter,
recommended that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization stick to
agreements reached in the alliance in 1987 and 1988 to modernize
U.S. Lance tactical missiles in West Germany.
   At the same time, Warnke said, NATO should open negotiations
with the Soviet Union about eliminating the entire class of nuclear
missiles with ranges of under 300 miles and therefore not subject
to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force pact, which took effect
last year.
   The dispute over modernizing short-range nuclear weapons has
pitted West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl against British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher and President Bush.
   Kohl and Thatcher held what they called frank and intensive
talks on the issue Sunday in Deidesheim, West Germany, but parted
in disagreement.
   ``We still have quite a lot of work to do,'' Kohl said after the
meeting, although predicting that an agreement was possible before
a NATO summit in Brussels, Belgium, this month.
   Kohl, whose party faces tough elections next year, wants NATO to
begin negotiations with the Soviet bloc on the issue and to delay
until at least 1992 a decision on Lance modernization.
   Thatcher said eliminating short-range nuclear weapons would mean
that the ``Soviet Union will have achieved its objective of getting
land-based nuclear weapons out of Europe. This, I believe, would be
disastrous.''
   Warnke said NATO could finesse the issue by entering
negotiations while stipulating that the Western alliance would not
eliminate its short-range nuclear weapons until the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact sharply reduced its conventional forces in Europe,
thereby removing the threat that the Lance is intended to deal
with, said Warnke.
   ``The existing short-range force should not be a priority,''
Warnke said at a breakfast meeting with reporters. ``It does not
seem to me that we need either to eliminate or modernize tactical
nuclear systems.''
   ``They can only be used if the Russians invade Western Euroupe.
... You are not going to blow up the men's room in the Kremlin''
with the Lance, which cannot reach beyond German borders, said
Warnke, who was assistant secretary of defense from 1967 through
1969 and the head of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in
1977 and 1978.
   Warnke also urged the Bush adminstration to move more quickly to
take advantage of conventional arms concesssions made by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who last December announced a cut
of 500,000 troops in Soviet forces and the withdrawal of 50,000
Soviet troops from Eastern Europe.

<HEAD>Pope Attacks `Contraceptive Imperialism,' Arrives on French Isle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ST. DENIS, Reunion (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II flew to this French
Indian Ocean island Monday after urging his flock in the
impoverished African nation of Madagascar to reject ``contraceptive
imperialism'' and abortion.
   The pope arrived on this volcanic island, about 450 miles east
of Madagascar, on the second stop of a nine-day tour that will also
take him to the African nations of Zambia and Malawi.
   He was greeted at the airport by French Prime Minister Michel
Rocard and a French military band playing the Marseillaise.
   John Paul then rode in his glass-enclosed popemobile to the
municipal building to meet privately with Rocard and address
political and church officials. He later spoke to local clergy at
the 19th century cathedral and had dinner with bishops from
Reunion, Mauritius and the Seyechelles.
   Earlier Monday, John Paul concluded a three-day visit to
Madagascar with an open-air Mass for about 100,000 people in
Fianarantsoa, a wine-producing town in the south of the island.
   He devoted much of his homily to birth control, a pressing issue
in Madagascar, where the average citizen earns $250 a year and the
population of 11 million is growing at an annual rate of 3 percent.
   Only one in 100 married women in Madagascar uses contraception,
according to the World Watch Institute, and Western aid agencies
have sought to promote the use of artificial birth control.
   ``The power to transmit life must be respected,'' said the
white-robed pontiff, speaking in French from a wooden altar
overlooking a dirt field near the airport.
   ``You cannot let yourselves be won over by the increasing
tendency to consider it (child-bearing) secondary, or even to want
to prevent human fertility from expressing itself.''
   The pope said that, if it is necessary for couples to choose
family planning, they must follow ``methods that respect nature.''
   He was referring to the only method approved by the Roman
Catholic Church, natural family planning based on abstinence during
a woman's fertile period.
   ``The teaching of the church seems difficult. But many couples
testify that it is possible to follow it and that it is even a
liberation compared to what we call `contraceptive imperialism.'''
   John Paul also decried abortion, saying families must ``respect
the life of the child from conception.''
   ``Do not accept that abortion is commonplace. Take care of the
fragile but human life of the unborn child ... the dignity of man
is at stake.''
   Before the ceremony, the pope blessed lepers kneeling in the
sand at the foot of the altar, patting each of them on the head.
They came from a nearby leper clinic founded in 1912 by a Polish
Jesuit missionary, Jan Beyzym.
   ``I would like to say to those suffering from leprosy and other
illnesses ... how much the church wants to bring them consolation
and comfort. How much she loves them.''
   Addressing officials in St. Denis, John Paul told islanders they
should ``rethink certain ways of life.'' He didn't elaborate but
local church officials have expressed concern about consumerisim
and materialism as well as superstition, exorcism and satanic cults.
   Reunion, covering 970 square miles, has been a French Overseas
Department since 1946. It is the richest of the countries on the
pope's trip as a tourist attraction and sugar exporter and also has
the highest percentage of Catholics _ 90 percent of the 500,000
population.
   Seventy percent of its people are descendants of the African
slaves brought to the island by the French in the 1600s.

<HEAD>U.S. Protests Illegal Driftnet Fishing by Taiwanese</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department has told the Taiwanese
that their relationship with the United States could suffer unless
they curb illegal driftnet fishing in the North Pacific, a U.S.
official said Monday.
   Ed Wolfe, ambassador for oceans and fisheries, said he delivered
a note of protest to an official of the Taiwanese Coordinating
Council for North American Affairs and warned of the possible
fallout if the government of Taiwan fails to negotiate a driftnet
fishing agreement with the United States.
   ``I delivered a forceful message regarding the potential serious
consequences of recent illegal fishing activities and the lack of
Taiwanese cooperation on driftnet negotiations, specifically the
enforcement aspect of those negotiations,'' said Wolfe.
   Wolfe said he told the Taiwanese that the fishing issue has
attracted interest at the ``highest levels'' of the State
Department and called for an ``immediate resumption of negotiations
to avoid potential bilateral foreign policy problems.''
   The meeting Friday came about a week after the Coast Guard
boarded a Taiwanese ship suspected of illegal driftnet fishing for
salmon in the North Pacific.
   The ship was spotted 450 miles outside the legal driftnet
fishing zone in waters where the Taiwanese government itself has
banned driftnetting. The ship allegedly cut its net and fled after
being spotted by the cutter Jarvis.
   The Jarvis shadowed the vessel for almost 700 miles before
receiving permission from the Taiwanese government to board.
   Wolfe said Monday that a fish scale and fin found on the ship
have been sent to a National Marine Fisheries Service laboratory to
see if they were from a salmon of North American origin.
   American fishermen claim vessels from Taiwan, South Korea and
Japan use driftnets to illegally snare millions of tons of salmon
under the guise of squid fishing. Fishing groups have said the
illegal fishing has already hurt salmon runs in Alaska, Washington
state and Oregon.
   Driftnets can stretch 35 miles in length and cover more than
30,000 square miles of ocean on any given day. Environmentalist
claim the nets are responsible for the deaths of thousands of
porpoises, seals, seabirds and other marine life annually.

<HEAD>First Taiwan Delegation Visits China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials from Taiwan arrived Monday on the first
visit to China by a Nationalist Chinese delegation since the
communists won the civil war in 1949 and Chiang Kai-shek's forces
fled to the island.
   The 12-member delegation led by Finance Minister Shirley Kuo
will attend the three-day annual meeting of the Asian Development
Bank that begins in the Chinese capital Thursday.
   ``We're happy that Taipei-China, like any other member of the
bank, will be able to attend this 22nd annual meeting of the ADB,''
said bank spokesman Reynaldo Pacheko.
   Ms. Kuo and the other delegation members went straight to the
hotel where the conference will be held.
   Taipei officials have said the delegation's only purpose is to
fulfill Taiwan's obligations as a founding member of the Asian
Development Bank and no official meetings will be held with the
Communist government.
   Since the defeat in 1949, the Nationalists have had a policy of
no contacts with mainland authorities. The bank meeting, however,
continues a practice of raising the level of exchange that began
with a softening of Taiwan's approach two years ago.
   Taiwan lifted restrictions on visits to the mainland late last
year and several thousand people have traveled to China for
reunions, tourism or business. Indirect trade has grown rapidly,
reaching an estimated $2.7 billion last year.
   Last month, young Taiwanese gymnasts became the first athletes
from the island to compete on the mainland, opening the way for
Taiwan's participation in the 1990 Asian Games in Beijing.
   Only 23 countries recognize Taiwan, while 136 have diplomatic
ties with the Beijing government.
   The Asian Development Bank, a regional development institution
established in 1966, is the only major international organization
in which Taiwan holds membership. It had to accept a name change
from Republic of China to Taipei- China when the 47-member
organization admitted China in 1986.
   Many in Taiwan, including members of the ruling party, see
adherence to the official policy of no contact as an attempt to
avoid the impression of eagerness until Taiwan is assured the
communists will consider it more than a local government.
   ``If this is not an official contact, then what is it?''
legislator Huang Ho-ching, a liberal member of the Nationalist
Party, said before the delegation left Taiwan.
   As a joke, he offered to give Ms. Kuo a pair of gloves so she
could shake hands with Chinese delegates without violating the
government's directive against direct contact.
   Early in April, Taiwan proposed that China be considered a
single nation with two governments, one in Beijing and the other in
Taipei. That would allow the island to rejoin international
organizations as an equal.
   Beijing rejected the idea, saying it would require abandonment
of the one-China policy.

   Auditorium lights dimmed and thousands of
youngsters nationwide went silent Monday when a $7 million science
project whisked them to the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea, live
and in color.
   Television screens showed them the satellite-relayed view of a
camera-equipped submersible robot being towed over the ocean floor.
It was the first of two weeks of live broadcasts to an expected
250,000 students at 13 museums from British Columbia to Florida.
   The project suffered a temporary setback last week when the
7-foot-long robot Jason, a newer version of the camera-carrying
submersible that explored the sunken ocean liner Titanic, sank
among the ruins of an ancient Roman trading ship off the coast of
Italy.
   The cable used to lower the million-dollar Jason and its mobile
garage or transporter, Argo, snapped and the pair plunged 2,100
feet to the soft, silty ocean floor.
   Organizers said the show would go on _ with or without Jason.
The robot was resurrected apparently undamaged Saturday but still
wasn't used in Monday's 40-minute broadcast.
   Jason has propellers and can be remotely guided in and around
underwater objects. Its replacement Monday, Medea, was merely a
sophisticated camera platform that is towed over a target area from
the surface.
   In addition to the underwater shots, expedition leader Robert
Ballard, discoverer of the Titanic, talked to the students from the
bridge of the support ship Star Hercules in the Mediterranean. He
took questions from students at three of the 13 participating
museums, narrated live footage of underwater volcanoes and
introduced films on satellite technology and the ancient Greek
voyager Jason, for whom the 20th-century undersea robot was named.
   ``Our journey to the Mediterranean has been anything but
uneventful,'' Ballard said in recounting Jason's mishap. ``The
voyage became a nonstop exercise in problem-solving.''
   During weeks of lessons and classroom discussion, the students
have developed an affection for the little robot explorer.
   The biggest laugh of the morning came when a boy identified only
as Kenneth, a grade-school student from Memphis, Tenn., got to
question Ballard.
   ``Is Jason alright?'' he asked.
   ``Jason is fine,'' Ballard said. ``His pride's a little hurt but
luckily none of his instrumentation is.''
   Greg Tardiff, a seventh grader from Beverly, Mass., said word of
Jason's loss last week spread rapidly through the Shore Country Day
School.
   ``We were crushed,'' the 13-year-old said. ``We thought the
whole thing would be called off.''
   Paul Fontaine of Boston's Museum of Science said he was
``thrilled'' with the show's premiere, although disappointed that
the slightly less than state-of-the-art stand-in took Jason's place.
   ``Jason is the superior robot and probably could have picked a
bigger variety of images,'' he said. ``But it was still a pretty
impressive show.''
   For some of the kids, too, the show wasn't quite the same
without Jason.
   ``The teachers said it was going to be so real that it would
seem like the water could come right off the screen,'' said
10-year-old Almas Rathod of the Walter J. Paton School in
Shrewsbury, Mass. ``It wasn't like that.''
   But classmate Barry Lyall said it met his expectations.
   ``It's much more interesting than hearing about it in a
classroom,'' the 9-year-old native of Scotland said. ``It was the
next best thing to being there.''
   The project sponsors include Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution , Turner Broadcasting System Inc., the National
Geographic Society and Electronic Data Systems.
   In addition to Woods Hole, participating museums are The Boston
Museum of Science; the Museum of Natural History in Denver; the
Detroit Science Center; the Discovery Place in Charlotte, N.C.; the
Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago; The Science Place in
Dallas; Memphis (Tenn.) Pink Palace Museum; The Franklin Institute
in Philadelphia; the Rochester (N.Y.) Museum and Science Center;
Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota, Fla.; National Geographic
Society Grosvenor Auditorium in Washington; and the Royal British
Columbia Museum in Victoria, British Columbia.

<HEAD>Rebels Announce Monthlong Cease-Fire</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of Sudan's southern rebel
movement announced Monday a conditional monthlong cease-fire, which
he called a goodwill gesture toward ending a six-year civil war.
   John Garang, a renegade army colonel who leads the rebels, said
the unilateral truce will hold only as long as the government
carries out no troop movements in the war-torn south. This includes
reinforcing beleaguered army forces in the region, he said.
   There was no immediate government response to his offer, which
follows weeks of successes for the rebel Sudan People's Liberation
Army. Several government garrisons, including in the largest
southern town of Juba, are under severe pressure.
   In a statement broadcast by clandestine Radio SPLA, Garang said
he has ordered his forces to ``remain in their present positions''
throughout May.
   Army troops must do likewise, he said, but added a formula could
be worked out to allow provision of non-military supplies.
   ``Our people are suffering. It is our responsibility to end the
war,'' he said on the broadcast from Ethiopia and monitored in
Khartoum, the Sudanese capital.
   The United Nations in April began a relief operation to ease a
war-induced famine and the flight of potential victims. Garang
refused overtures to declare a ``month of tranquillity'' in the
south, but he did agree to allow passage of goods through specified
corridors.
   Unidentified attackers twice have ambushed U.N. food convoys
since then.
   On Monday, ambushers sprayed a vehicle with small arms fire near
the rebel-held town of Kapoeta. On April 18, a convoy was hit by a
rocket and automatic weapons fire, also near Kapoeta. Eight armed
rebel escorts were killed in that attack.
   Garang said the cease-fire will be extended if necessary and
called on the Sudanese government to reciprocate.
   He said his fighters will ``wait for the government to implement
the requirements of the Sudanese peace initiative, after which a
comprehensive cease-fire will be worked out.''
   In November, the rebels signed an agreement with the Democratic
Unionist Party calling for the suspension of harsh Islamic laws and
a constitutional conference of all political powers.
   Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi initially refused to submit the
agreement to his Cabinet for endorsement. After pressure from the
army and professional organizations and trade unions, he formed a
new, broader-based government and won parliament's approval to
suspend the 1,400-year-old Islamic penal code.
   The rebels started fighting in 1983 against the Moslem-dominated
government, demanding social and economic reforms for the minority
Christians and animists of the south.

   A white anti-apartheid
activist was shot and killed Monday outside his home by an
assailant firing from a passing car, police said.
   Colleagues said they had no doubt that David Webster, 44, was
assassinated because of his political activities.
   Webster, a lecturer in social anthropology at the University of
the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and a prominent member of several
anti-apartheid organizations, was a leading opponent of the
government's policy of detention without trial and held periodic
tea parties for the families of detained black activists.
   Police said Webster died almost instantly after he was hit in
the back by a bullet fired from a heavy-caliber weapon outside his
home in the Johannesburg neighborhood of Troyeville. Nothing was
known about the assailant, police added
   With Webster at the time was Maggie Friedman, a friend and
fellow member of the Human Rights Commission, a Johannesburg-based
monitoring group established by anti-apartheid activists last year.
She said Webster was shot after they had returned from buying
plants at a nursery.
   She said she heard a noise from a passing car which she thought
had backfired, then saw Webster stagger and tell her: ``I've been
shot with a shotgun. Get an ambulance.''
   ``It is clear to me that his killing was a highly professional
job,'' she said. ``I find it frightening that those who opposed him
were prepared to go to such lengths to eliminate someone.''
   Dozens of black activists have been killed in recent years in
unsolved murders. The Five Freedoms Forum, a human rights groups
with which Webster worked, described Monday's killing as one of the
first assassinations of a white activist.
   ``We are deeply shocked by this blatant assassination of our
dear comrade,'' said Mohammed Valli Moosa, a former detainee who
serves as unofficial spokesman for major anti-apartheid groups.
   ``We are concerned that his death comes as a result of
unflinching opposition to the system of apartheid,'' Valli Moosa
said. ``The only beneficiaries of his death are those who have an
interest in perpetuating this evil system.''

<HEAD>Scientists Abort Missile Launch</HEAD>

   Scientists on Monday aborted the launch
of India's first medium-range ballistic missile seconds before it
was to lift off when computers detected an error in one of the
rocket's systems, officials said.
   One military official said a problem developed in the liquid
fuel propellant of the $6 million missile and there would have been
``a big disaster'' had the countdown reached zero.
   It was the second time in 11 days that scientists postponed the
test-firing of the missile, which experts say has the capability to
carry a nuclear warhead.
   The postponement was met by cheers and the blowing of conch
shells by many of the 12,000 villagers who were temporarily
evacuated from their homes around the launch site in this eastern
Indian town overlooking the Bay of Bengal.
   A government statement issued at the remote seaside missile
center said the launch was called off when computers detected the
data error.
   ``It is not a major fault,'' said V.S. Arunachalam, scientific
adviser to the Defense Ministry and head of India's missile program
at the launch site.
   But a military official said scientists detected a leak in the
missile's liquid fuel propellant 11 seconds before the scheduled
firing.
   ``Had the scientists counted to zero it would have ended in a
big disaster,'' the official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   A previous attempt to fire the missile on April 20 was called
off because of a snag in the ignition system.
   Military sources said the missile would likely be dismantled and
every part checked before a third attempt is made.
   Scientists will postpone the launch for at least one week, the
sources said.
   Before the launch, angry residents said prayers and held special
ceremonies beseeching Hindu gods and goddesses to prevent the
missile from being fired. The villagers fear they will be
permanently shifted from their homes if the missile launch is
successful and the test range is used for more firings.
   The 7{-ton surface-to-surface missile has a range of 1,550
miles, Indian military experts say. Its first stage is boosted by a
solid fuel propellant engine and its second stage is powered by a
liquid fuel engine.
   The range is sufficient to hit targets as far as Iran in the
west, Hong Kong in the east, China in the north and islands around
the equator in the south, Western military officials said.
   The missile, named ``Agni,'' or ``fire'' in Hindi, can hit any
target in neighboring Pakistan, India's longstanding adversary. The
two countries have fought three wars in the past 42 years.
   Defense experts said the one-ton payload capability is more than
enough for the missile to carry a nuclear warhead.
   India has said its nuclear capacity will be used only for
peaceful purposes. But Western military experts in New Delhi said
if India ever uses the missile in a war, it might not carry a
conventional warhead.
   ``You need accuracy or a point target if you are using a
conventional warhead,'' said one Western analyst, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``But if you are using a nuclear warhead,
the exact target does not matter.''
   India exploded a nuclear device 15 years ago, and Western
experts estimate it would take Indian scientists one week to
assemble a nuclear device.

<HEAD>Bush Says He Hopes Gorbachev's Reforms Succeed, White House Brushes
Aside Cheney Comments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Monday he hopes Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev succeeds in his economic reforms, and
the White House brushed aside Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's
prediction that Gorbachev would fail.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Cheney's remarks,
in a weekend broadcast interview, were merely his own ``personal
observations'' and did not reflect the views of the administration,
which has adopted a public posture of trying to encourage Soviet
reforms.
   Bush, speaking to the annual meeting of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, said, ``Even the socialist world is beginning to see that
socialism isn't just another economic system _ it's the death of
economics. And there is a new breeze blowing.''
   Bush said he told Gorbachev last year ``we wanted to see
perestroika (economic reforms) succeed in the Soviet Union. And
likewise, we want to see success for the economic reforms in
China.''
   The president did not mention Cheney or his remarks. Fitzwater
said he did not think Bush talked about the Soviet reforms because
of Cheney's comments. Rather, Fitzwater said, ``it was a natural
fit'' in a speech about economics.
   The White House and State Department joined forces to
disassociate the administration from Cheney, who had said of
Gorbachev, ``If I had to guess today, I would guess he ultimately
would fail.''
   In the broadcast interview, the Pentagon secretary predicted
Gorbachev then would be replaced by someone ``far more hostile''
toward the West.
   Last Tuesday, Cheney made similar remarks during testimony
before the House Armed Services Committee. He predicted ``a very
real likelihood'' that Gorbachev's reform plans would fail and that
the Soviet leader may either be forced to change course or hand
over power.
   Cheney told Congress that as a result, the United States and its
NATO allies must resist the temptation to respond to Gorbachev's
proposals for reducing arsenals and troop strengths and stick to
the policies it has advocated until now.
   In his speech, Bush said reform efforts in the Soviet Union,
China and other socialist countries were part of ``an exciting
trend and in my view it will continue.''
   ``Whenever in the world there is economic reform, the United
States should be hoping that that reform succeeds. Economic reform,
with its emphasis on incentive and market economics, leads to more
freedom,'' Bush said.
   He joked that the May Day parade in Moscow had included a
delegation from the Soviet Economic Planning Ministry _ 200
economists marching along yelling ``May Day, May Day.''
   However, Bush said, ``Today that is beginning to change.''
   At the White House, Fitzwater said, ``The administration's
position on the Soviet Union, whether expressed by President Bush,
Secretary Baker or Secretary Cheney, reflects the view that we want
reform to succeed.''
   Fitzwater, asked about Cheney's comments, said: ``I don't know
what his motivation was. In reading it (the transcript), it looks
like it was just a question that came up in the interview when he
offered his personal observations. I'm sure it wasn't part of any
grand strategy.''
   He said Bush had not talked with Cheney about the matter.
   On another subject, Fitzwater said the White House did not plan
to release documents that would buttress Bush's contention that
there was no link between his March 1985 meeting in Honduras and
that country's support for the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   Bush and others involved in that meeting ``have all said there
was no quid pro quo associated with the vice president's trip to
Honduras. However, there is no campaign to publicize information,''
Fitzwater said.
   On Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell,
D-Maine, said he has not changed his mind about the need for a
review of whether the Reagan White House withheld documents or
other key information from the congressional investigation of the
secret arms sales to Iran and aid to the Contras.
   ``We'll have the Intelligence Committee look into that,''
Mitchell said. ``Questions have arisen that I think ought to be
answered.... I think the Intelligence Committee will make a
thorough review of the matter.''

   Mourners gathered Monday at a funeral for a
brain-damaged baby who died after his father disconnected his life
support, while the father's attorneys worked on his defense against
a charge of murder.
   Sixteen-month-old Samuel Linares was buried in a white casket
adorned with angels, after a 45-minute funeral service attended by
about 80 mourners at a church just blocks from the family's home in
this suburb west of Chicago.
   ``I am sure God weeps when he sees what happened to Samuel,''
the Rev. John R. Price, pastor of Mary Queen of Heaven Church, said
in his eulogy.
   ``We think we can control our destiny ... and then something
like this happens _ death comes, pain and suffering come,'' Price
said. ``And then we know in a flash ... that we can't control our
lives. We know that not all the doctors, and the physicians, or the
machines could control, could lift, the burden of Samuel and his
family.''
   Police said Rudy Linares kept staffers in a Chicago hospital at
bay with a gun Wednesday, tearfully disonnected the child's
life-support equipment and held the baby in his arms until he died.
   The baby had been comatose since swallowing a balloon last
August and doctors said he was in a vegetative state with no
improvement expected.
   Linares, 23, was charged with murder but was free on $75,000
bond.
   Linares and his wife, Tamara, sat in the front pew of the church
Monday with their other two small children. His face was downcast
and his shoulders hunched during much of the service, and his wife
cried when they followed the tiny casket out of the church.
   Public defenders Richard Scholz and Philip Mullane met Friday
with prosecutors and Cook County Judge Thomas R. Fitzgerald and
agreed that none of the Linares' relatives would be required to
testify until Wednesday, after the funeral.
   On Monday, Fitzgerald refused to quash a subpoena that would
require Mrs. Linares to testify before a grand jury.
   ``Mrs. Linares will be expected to testify Wednesday,'' said
Lisa Howard, spokeswoman for the Cook County state's attorney's
office.

   Workers strode through Red Square in a tightly
controlled May Day march Monday, but Soviet Armenians defied a ban
and rallied in their capital, thanking the world for helping them
dig out of a deadly earthquake.
   Thousands of Armenians gathered in Yerevan to express gratitude
for foreign aid that followed the Dec. 7 earthquake that killed an
estimated 25,000 people, the government newspaper Izvestia reported.
   Authorities had banned the traditional celebrations in Yerevan
and in Tbilisi, the capital of the Soviet republic of Georgia,
because of pro-independance unrest in both cities and because of
the Armenian earthquake.
   Armenian activist Rafael Popoyan said the Yerevan march was
massive but peaceful. He said participants demanded freedom for
jailed members of a group leading the effort to annex
Nagorno-Karabakh, a disputed region in the neighboring republic of
Azerbaijan.
   In Kishinev, capital of the republic of Moldavia, youths
boycotted a rally after student activists were refused their own
column in that city's parade, Izvestia said.
   The tiny republic on the Romanian border has been the scene of
several demonstrations and some violence in recent months as
activists have pressed for greater independence from Moscow.
   In Moscow, howver, the mood was decidedly upbeat under bright
skies, with the traditional Red Square parade highlighting the
official tribute to workers of the world.
   The emphasis was on progress at home, and there were no direct
references to international issues or the Soviet troop withdrawal
from Afghanistan.
   Access to Red Square is severely restricted for such events, and
the vast majority of Soviets who saw the two-hour parade did so via
television.
   In an article coinciding with the holiday, the daily newspaper
Socialist Industry charged Monday that Soviet trade unions are mere
government puppets that don't protect workers' rights.
   The newspaper, which specializes in labor and economics, called
for giving labor organizations greater independence.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and members of the Communist
Party's ruling Politburo stood atop Lenin's tomb to view
festivities as thousands of marchers passed through Red Square
waving banners, pushing floats and releasing helium-filled balloons.
   His wife, Raisa, was absent from the festivities that she has
attended in the past. There was no explanation.
   In a section reserved for government dignitaries stood Boris N.
Yeltsin, the maverick ousted as Moscow party boss and removed from
the Politburo last year. He made a remarkable comeback by winning a
popular election to represent Moscow in the new parliament that
meets May 25.
   Signs and banners boosted ``perestroika,'' Gorbachev's program
to overhaul and modernize Soviet society. There also was increased
attention paid to the environment.
   ``To the coming generations: a clean planet,'' pledged one
banner.
   In one solemn passage, the parade announcer called for
participants to remember those who died in Armenia, Georgia and the
Soviet submarine accident last month in the Norwegian Sea.
   ``It seems that one can hear at the square even now echoes of
requiems that have not died away in Armenia and Georgia,'' he said,
``and the cold sea has not yet dried its salty tears mourning those
heroes, submariners, who perished ...''
   Yerevan has been under curfew for more than six months to curb
ethnic rivalries that killed more than 90 people in Armennia and
Azerbaijan last year. About 20 people died in pro-independence
unrest in Tbilisi last month, and 42 sailors were killed in the
submarine tragedy.

<TEXT>
   Forty American and Soviet poets and short
story writers celebrated glasnost on Monday by announcing the
publication of a 345-page anthology of some of their best works,
which author Bel Kaufman called ``an exchange of our common
humanity.''
   The English-language edition of the book, titled ``The Human
Experience,'' is published domestically by Alfred A. Knopf for
$19.95. The Russian-language version will be sold to Soviet readers
for two rubles each, or about $3.30.
   Published under the auspices of the Quaker U.S.@U.S.S.R.
Committee, a Philadelphia-based organization that promotes contacts
between the two countries, the anthology is the first joint
Soviet-American venture in publishing fiction.
   Contributing American writers and poets include John Updike,
Joyce Carol Oates, Garrison Keillor, Alice Walker, John Sayles and
Stanley Kunitz. Their Soviet counterparts include Evgeny
Yevtushenko, Tatiana Tolstaya, Alexander Kushner and Vasily Belov.
   ``The book has to do with our common feelings _ love, hate,
envy, worry about our children, life and death,'' Ms. Kaufman told
a news conference at the National Press Club. ``That's what will
bring us together, more than politics or polemics.''
   Soviet publisher George Andjaparidze said the anthology will
allow the people of both countries ``to get to know each other and
understand each other'' in sharing such mundane concerns as
``getting up with the alarm clock every morning, finding a job,
falling in love.''
   ``There is nothing in this book about politics or ideology,'' he
said.
   Jay Worrall Jr., clerk of the Quaker committee, said the book
owes much to Mikhail S. Gorbachev's glasnost policy of opening up
Soviet society and culture.
   ``We owe it all to Gorbachev and the Quakers,'' said
Andjaparidze, who is editor of the Khudozhestvennaya Literatura
publishing house in Moscow.
   Some of the writers represented in the book, 20 from each
country, will begin three days of informal consultations Tuesday at
the Quaker meeting house in Washington.
   Among their other scheduled activities are receptions at the
Folger Shakespeare Library and the Soviet Embassy and a poetry
reading at the Library of Congress.
   Prominent Soviet literary figure Tatiana Kudryaviseva said the
easiest American writers to translate into Russian are John
Cheever, whose prose is ``crystal clear,'' and William Styron,
whose literary style reminds her of the great Russian novelist Leo
Tolstoy.
   She said it is more difficult to translate the works of Donald
Barthelme and Joyce Carol Oates because of their unusual literary
images and use of American slang.
   In a foreword to the book, Styron wrote that the joint literary
project ``may be symbolic of an even greater and more lasting
solidarity, as America and the Soviet Union choose friendship over
the folly of perpetual strife.''
   In a separate foreword, Soviet novelist Daniil Granin wrote that
``feeling the oneness of the earth and recognizing your own
thoughts and feelings in other people is the best pathway to
trust.''

   Israeli professors Monday protested the
15-month closure of Palestinian universities and called the measure
an unwarranted collective punishment that threatens peace efforts.
   ``Even though closing the universities doesn't kill or maim, it
causes serious injury to the fabric of any society,'' said Ruth
Gavison, a law professor at Hebrew University. ``It disturbs life
in a way that is far reaching.''
   Israeli military authorities closed Bethlehem University on Oct.
29, 1987, and by February 1988 had shut the remaining Palestinian
universities in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. About 18,000
students are affected.
   Authorities called the colleges breeding grounds for
anti-Israeli protests.
   But the 1,200 professors from Israeli universities said the
closures threatened efforts to find moderate Palestinians with
which to negotiate an end to their 16-month uprising. At least 457
Arabs and 18 Israelis have died in clashes, mostly in the occupied
territories.
   ``Universities are the only place the moderate elements of the
Palestinian community can develop,'' said Hava Lazarus-Yafeh, a
professor of Asian and African studies at Hebrew University.
   ``Otherwise Palestinian leaders grow in prisons ... and leaders
who grow in jail tend to be more violent,'' she said.
   State-run primary and secondary schools in the West Bank have
also been closed for all but a few weeks since Feb. 4, 1988.
Kindergarten, first- and second-grade classes in some private
schools were allowed to reopen earlier this year.
   Authorities barred home study for university students and
refused to allow them to use college facilities such as
laboratories or libraries, said David Kretzmer, a Hebrew University
law professor. Recently, a West Bank university was refused
permission to open its Library, he said.
   ``It is hard to understand how opening a library to librarians
could endanger security,'' Kretzmer said.
   Hebrew University's Ms. Gavison called the closures a
``far-reaching collective measure.''
   ``Necessary security measures should be taken not against
institutions but against those individuals who have may have
violated order,'' she said.
   The longterm closures violate international statutes, such as
the Geneva Convention, which governs the treatment of people under
occupation, Kretzmer said.
   He said that a 1982 Israeli Supreme Court ruling determined
military closures of Palestinian schools could not surpass a
reasonable period.

<TEXT>
   Cambodia's Vietnamese-installed
government has changed the country's name and flag, and invited its
banished prince to return home and help rule.
   In nearby Indonesia, resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk
welcomed the concessions and appeared ready to make a few of his
own to end the 10-year conflict.
   ``It seems that we are at the end of the tunnel. We are going to
make progress on the way toward a settlement,'' Sihanouk said on
Monday, the eve of new peace talks.
   Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia invited Sihanouk to abandon
his Khmer Rouge allies and ``join us.''
   The official Cambodian news agency SPK Monday quoted Hun Sen as
promising Sihanouk will have real power if he returns to Phnom
Penh. The comments, made at a Phnom Penh news conference Saturday,
appeared tailored for the peace talks in Jakarta, which now are
expected to last longer than a day.
   Hun Sen stopped in Bangkok on his way to Jakarta on Monday and
told reporters the changes are concessions to help settle the war.
He too said he was confident of success in the talks with Sihanouk.
   He said that on Sunday, the National Assembly unanimously
adopted constitutional amendments changing the ``People's Republic
of Kampuchea'' to ``The State of Cambodia.''
   Hun Sen sported a model of the new flag: the top half is red,
the bottom is blue and a gold image of Angkor Wat temple is in the
center. A new national anthem and coat of arms also are in the
works, he said.
   His government was installed by Vietnamese forces that invaded
the country in late 1978 and toppled the brutal Khmer Rouge regime.
It is battling a coalition of three guerrilla groups led by
Sihanouk.
   Diplomats say the changes are to strengthen the government's
domestic and international support as it begins to confront the
resistance without the help of Vietnam.
   Hanoi announced last month that it will withdraw its troops by
Sept. 30 to encourage a political settlement in Cambodia.
   Sihanouk and other resistance officials in the past have
demanded not only changing the country's name and flag, but also
dismantling the government before general elections.
   On Monday, Sihanouk said he would not insist on this, or U.N.
supervision of the Vietnamese withdrawal, so long as an adequate
power-sharing formula can be found.
   He also appeared to drop a call for Hun Sen to join a four-party
government that would include Sihanouk's non-communist followers,
anti-communists under former Premier Son Sann and the communist
Khmer Rouge.
   ``I had a good feeling when I left Phnom Penh that Prince
Norodom has already offered two concessions. If this is true, it
could lead to a political settlement,'' Hun Sen told reporters.
   Although he called on Sihanouk to join his government and
abandon the Khmer Rouge, Hun Sen also stressed the prince's options
are few.
   ``We have traveled 10 years without Sihanouk. We started with
empty hands and have established material and technical bases,''
Hun Sen said.
   The country was known as the Kingdom of Cambodia when Sihanouk
led it to independence from the French in 1953. Sihanouk ruled
until he was toppled in a 1970 coup by Marshal Lon Nol, who changed
the name to the Khmer Republic.
   The Khmer Rouge changed it to Democratic Kampuchea when they won
a civil war and overthrew Lon Nol's U.S.-backed government in April
1975. The Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people in
attempts to fashion a peasant society along fanatical communist
lines.
   The United Nations does not recognize the pro-Vietnamese
government. Instead it seats the guerrilla coalition formed in
1982, called the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea.

   The United States averted a potentially
serious rift in U.S.-Japanese relations by going ahead with the
controversial agreement for the two countries to develop jointly a
new jet fighter for Japan, the new American ambassador to Tokyo
said Monday.
   Ambassador Michael Armacost told reporters that despite
persistent, strong objections to the project on Capitol Hill, ``I'm
confident it will meet with the acquiescence of our Congress.''
   President Bush announced Friday that the United States intends
to proceed with the FSX fighter program because it is ``in the
strategic and commercial interests of the United States.''
   After taking office in January, Bush ordered a review of the $7
billion project negotiated under his predecessor, Ronald Reagan.
Critics in Congress and the Commerce Department have said it
amounts to a giveaway of U.S. high technology and have said Japan
should make an ``off-the-shelf'' aircraft purchase, as do other
nations that are U.S. customers.
   Armacost brought up the negative side of scrapping the agreement
in an appearance at the Washington Foreign Press Center on the eve
of his departure for Japan, where he is due next week.
   Proceeding with the FSX project ``is important from our
standpoint because of what it avoided, namely (America and Japan)
going down separate tracks,'' he said. ``It avoids what could have
been an important breach in our relationship if this deal had gone
awry.''
   The FSX agreement ``is a good arrangement for both our
governments. We have had coproduction in past, but major
codevelopment is in a sense the first'' such arrangement with
Japan, said Armacost, a former undersecretary of state for
political affairs.
   ``I hope this will be a model of the flow of two-way technology
which is quite appropriate to a more mature relationship between
our countries in this field,'' the ambassador said.
   The White House said Monday that, with Japan, Bush ``has been
very tough in demanding equity for the United States in terms of
its commercial interests,'' and he ``was successful in getting
everything he asked for.'' Friday's announcement said U.S.
companies would be guaranteed about 40 percent of the production
work on the planned 130 new fighters while certain computer codes
from the U.S. F-16 jet, which provides the model for the FSX, would
be withheld.

<HEAD>County's Land Giveaway Plan Turning Sour</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INTERNATIONAL FALLS, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A northern Minnesota county's
attempt to boost its population with a land giveaway program
brought thousands of responses from around the world.
   It also brought complaints and legal snags that threaten the
program.
   ``We're getting tremendous pressure to shut down the program,''
said Bruce Biggins, the Koochiching County commissioner who heads
the homestead authority. ``We got into it in good faith, but we've
taken a tremendous amount of flak.''
   Among the problems are resentment from longtime county
residents; far less available land than originally planned;
reluctance by bankers to make construction loans and an
overwhelming demand.
   ``You have a whole lot of people out there really, really
desperate for a new way of life,'' said Larry Chezick, a county
commissioner. ``It frankly swamped us. We didn't field-test it
before the media got onto it.''
   The international publicity of the program drew people to the
area who had not received approval to homestead. Last winter, three
homesteading hopefuls from Colorado were arrested trying to break
into an empty farmhouse. Another time, two Germans wandered into
the local Job Service office, saying they intended to homestead and
needed work.
   ``On paper, the whole idea looks good, but the reality doesn't
live up to it,'' said Sheriff Bill Elliott, who received calls from
police officers around the country who were interested in the
program.
   For a while, the homesteading office had to hire receptionists
who could speak German to handle the overseas requests.
   More than 10,000 people asked for information about the program,
about one-fourth of whom sent $10 to receive an application. About
250 people followed through with an application, and only two
homesteaders have received their 40-acre parcels.
   Tom Johnson Jr., 24, one of the homesteaders, said he had
trouble finding bank financing for the house he wants to build. The
land can't be used as collateral because under the program
homesteaders do not receive title to it until they live there for
10 years.
   ``We've tried to get that across to them since the beginning,''
said Marlys Raboin, senior vice president of First American Bank in
International Falls. ``If you can't finance the property, the
program just isn't workable.''
   The program has turned out to be unworkable in other ways
because homesteaders were mistakenly told that about 50,000 acres
of tax-forfeited county lands and state lands were available. But
it was later discovered that most of the state land can't be given
away because it's held in trust.
   Officials say now it is not clear exactly how much land they are
entitled to give away.
   Some sites also might have mineral leases or significant
waterfront property that could prevent them from being given away,
said Dennis Hummitzch, the county's land commissioner.
   Program officials said they were extremely selective in choosing
participants, but some local residents have their doubts.

<HEAD>Customs Announces Proposal in Drive to Prevent Smuggling by Air and
Sea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Customs Service proposed on Monday that
the government, unions and airline and shipping industries unite in
a drive to prevent drug smuggling by air and sea.
   It would be ``the first time that industry, labor and government
have joined together to put together a plan to combat drug
smuggling,'' Customs Commissioner William von Raab said before
meeting with representatives of about 100 air and sea carriers
where the plan was outlined.
   Von Raab estimated that 30 percent of the cocaine coming into
the country is entering in containers. He said he expected that to
reach 50 percent in the next two years and up to 80 percent to 90
percent by 1992 because of a crackdown on other forms of
trafficking.
   The plan seeks to ``prevent drugs from being put on board'' at
foreign ports, said Lou Razzino, the agency's program manager for
narcotics interdiction in commercial cargo. ``Prevent is the key
word. Up until now, we've been talking interdiction,'' he added.
   At the meeting, a longshoremen's union leader said union members
might refuse to unload any cargo from drug-producing countries if
they don't curtail the illegal trafficking.
   John Bowers, president of the International Longshoreman's
Association, said some foreign countries don't even care ``whether
drugs are going on these ships.''
   He added that his members are ``saying that if they think they
can use those ships as the dumping grounds in the United States for
their drugs, then we're going to put on a boycott. ... We know we'd
lose wages. We'd rather lose wages than lose our children.''
   He declined to say what criteria the union would use to refuse
to unload ships. He noted that longshoremen had refused for 25
years to unload cargo from the Soviet Union and recently paid $9
million in fines because the union lost a Supreme Court decision
over the boycott.
   The proposal outlined Monday calls for industries to impose
strict security standards at foreign and domestic terminals and
facilities and aboard their carriers. Customs would provide
security training, surveys of foreign and domestic sites and help
in identifying potential smuggling opportunities.
   Compliance with the voluntary agreement will be considered in
assessing penalties or seizing a vehicle found to have illegal
drugs after the pact is signed.
   The cost to each carrier has not been determined.
   Under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, penalties for carrying
illegal drugs went up to $1,000 per ounce of heroin and cocaine and
$500 per ounce of marijuana. The law also authorized seizure of the
carrier.
   Some carriers' representatives wanted a tariff imposed that
would cover their costs for new security measures the agreement
would demand, so they would remain competitive with carriers that
don't participate. Razzino said, however, that such a decision
would be up to Congress.

<HEAD>Paper Blisters Soviet Labor Unions on May Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet trade unions serve to promote the
government and the status quo instead of workers' rights, a
newspaper said Monday in an article that injected some criticism of
official bodies into May Day's labor pageantry.
   Under the headline ``What do we need a union for?'' economist
Alexander Auzan compared the country's unions to a grandmother
``who makes a lot of fuss, interferes in everything, but who no one
really listens to.''
   The trade unions have been turned into ``a government
maidservant concerned not with defending the interests of the
workers, but only with maintaining peace and quiet and an imitation
of `mass support,''' Auzan wrote in Socialist Industry, the Soviet
daily.
   Many Western unions long have said their Soviet counterparts
have been co-opted by the government.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev urged labor unions in 1987 to be
more vigorous in defending rank-and-file workers. But increasing
numbers of critics say the unions should prod bureaucrats more
aggressively to improve housing, salaries and working conditions.
   Although some Soviet labor officials acknowledge failings of
their unions, they have publicly ruled out forming independent
trade organizations like Poland's Solidarity.
   In his article, Auzan said unions should be given more
independence and suggested they be decentralized.
   Unions should act as information clearing houses on vacancies
and dislocated workers, set up retraining centers, and guarantee
unemployment benefits, the economist said.
   He also called for union representatives elected to a new
national Congress of People's Deputies to press for a strike law to
clarify what job actions are legal.
   In his criticisms of unions, Auzan said union leaders never
``fly urgently to the scene of a strike conflict or act as
mediators between workers and government organs.''
   Even though most strikes are prohibited, there have been
increasing reports of workers walking off their jobs to demand
higher pay or to protest working conditions.
   The economist also complained that membership in trade unions is
``practically universally obligatory,'' and he said many
bookkeepers automatically deduct union dues from the salaries even
of non-members.
   ``Enough of paying tribute to the union bureaucracy!'' he wrote.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greenpeace asked the Soviet Union on Monday to
seek world help to recover from the bottom of the Norwegian Sea,
one mile down, a wrecked submarine and its two nuclear reactors and
nuclear weapons.
   A technical report commissioned by the environmental
organization said the Soviet submarine on April 7 took ``a
significant amount of highly active and toxic radioactive
materials'' to the bottom, 5,296 feet beneath the surface.
   ``If the submarine is not recovered intact then it is, in our
opinion, inevitable that all of this material will disperse to the
marine environment,'' said the report by the independent nuclear
engineering consultants John Large and Associates Ltd. of London.
   Forty-two seamen were killed and 27 survived when the vessel,
armed with two nuclear torpedoes and reportedly fueled by uranium
235, caught fire and sank 120 miles southwest of Norway's Bear
Island.
   The report said the nuclear reactors may have contained up to 20
million curies of radioactivity and the reactor hull parts 1
million curies. Greenpeace said its figures are conservative
because they do not include the radioactivity of the reactors'
liquid metal coolant or the toxic plutonium of the torpedoes.
   The No. 4 reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, by
comparison, emitted an estimated 50 million curies of radiation
after it caught fire in the Soviet Union in April 1986.
   The report said much of the radioactive material aboard the Mike
Class submarine will continue to emit radiation and be harmful to
marine and human life for many tens of thousands of years.
   ``This vast quantity of radioactivity is mainly from highly
active materials which will remain highly toxic to organisms almost
indefinitely,'' said Greenpeace spokesman Damian Durrant.
   ``Inevitably, they will be released and a proportion absorbed
into the marine food chains, through fisheries and toward man. The
only question is when the reactors breach and this process begins.''
   Director Johan Baarli of the Norwegian National Institute of
Radiation Protection said in response to the report, ``There is no
reason to doubt that the sub's reactor is in its containment.
According to all information we have, there is no radiation
leakage.''
   The institute said last month that tests showed the submarine's
reactors and weapons have apparently withstood tremendous water
pressure. Water samples collected near the submarine showed no
radiation that could be attributed to it, the institute said.
   The Soviet news agency Tass quoted Deputy Prime Minister Igor
Belovsov last month as saying a decision on whether to raise the
submarine is months away.
   The report does not discuss the possible impact of leaked
radioactivity on the marine environment.
   ``This requires a further study dependent on the provision of
more information from the Soviet Union, as requested by Greenpeace
as well as the Norwegian government, but which neither have thus
far received,'' Greenpeace said.
   The report noted that when the United States tried to raise a
Soviet Golf Class nuclear submarine in 1974 the vessel broke in
half.
   It said recovery should not be regarded as a ``quick technical
fix for this or future nuclear submarine accidents'' and called for
elimination of all 544 military nuclear reactors from ships and
submarines worldwide.

   The United States on Monday reaffirmed its
insistence on the improvement of short-range nuclear missiles in
West Germany despite the opposition of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
his government.
   There was no hint of compromise in the statement read by
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler at the State Department. She denied,
however, that U.S. officials were irritated with Kohl for trying to
delay the modernization of the Lance missiles and artillery and for
demanding U.S. negotiations with the Soviet Union to reduce the
nuclear arsenal.
   ``Secretary (James A.) Baker is not upset,'' the U.S. official
said.
   The rift was not healed during a weekend meeting in West Germany
between Kohl and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, an
ardent proponent of extending the range of the missiles as a way of
deterring Soviet attack.
   ``We, of course, share the view of the United Kingdom that it
would be a mistake to engage in negotiations on SNF (Short-range
Nuclear Forces),'' Ms. Tutwiler said. ``We also share the United
Kingdom view that we need to maintain an up-to-date land-based
nuclear deterrent in Europe.''
   She continued: ``We have a difference of opinion with other
members of the (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) alliance and we
will be seeking to resolve the issue...''
   The statement's reference to ground-based missiles appeared to
rule out a compromise under which the Lances in West German might
be scaled back or withdrawn and their place in NATO strategy taken
by air-launched cruise missiles.
   It also suggested the West Germans have some support within NATO.
   The dispute is causing strains in the alliance and could put a
damper on President Bush's summit meeting in Brussels May 29-30
with the leaders of the 15 other NATO countries.
   Baker is due in Brussels on May 12 for previously scheduled
talks with NATO officials and will discuss the tactical nuclear
issue with Western foreign ministers.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, asked about the
impasse, said, ``our position remains that keeping the peace
requires a strong NATO alliance, and a policy of flexible response.
We believe the vast Soviet superiority and Warsaw Pact conventional
forces must be reduced before we can discuss reductions in short
range nuclear weapons.''
   ``The West German position demonstrates the special strength
that NATO has,'' Fitzwater said. ``Our allies can debate quite
vigorously these issues, yet maintain the basic strength of our
unity.''
   But, he continued, ``we believe very strongly in our position;
we believe very strongly that flexible response is essential to the
peace of Europe.''
   The New York Times quoted unnamed Bush administration officials
on Sunday as saying the Kohl government was threatening NATO's
unity by pressing for speeding negotiations with the Soviets on the
missiles and artillery. The newspaper said the officials had grown
increasingly irritated with Kohl for trying to line up other
European nations against the United States.
   Behind the scenes the two sides are jockeying for support.
   The Associated Press disclosed last week that all U.S.
ambassadors in NATO capitals were instructed to outline the U.S.
position to the host governments to try to win them over. West
Germany is using the same approach.

<HEAD>Peruvian Guerrillas Kill Three Players at Soccer Match</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUANCAYO, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas shot and killed three
players at an amateur soccer match, police reported Monday, and the
government announced it was prolonging an anti-guerrilla state of
emergency.
   Police said a group of Shining Path guerrillas disrupted a
soccer match Sunday between neighboring villages in Cullpa, on
Huancayo's western outskirts, and ordered 100 spectators and
players to attend a lecture in the village square. The three men
were shot when they refused to go along, police said.
   Extension of the state of emergency comes during the deadliest
reign of violence so far in Peru's nine-year fight against leftist
guerrillas. Nearly 1,000 people have been killed this year,
including 86 on Friday.
   The measures take force when the current decree expires
Wednesday. They affect Lima and parts of seven highland and jungle
states where more than half of Peru's 21 million people live.
   States of emergency suspend citizens' rights to travel and meet
freely, and permit government forces to conduct searches without
warrants and hold suspects for 15 days without filing charges.
   The military can also assume direct political and police control
in emergency zones.
   In 1982 Ayacucho, 235 miles southeast of Lima, became the first
area placed under a state of emergency to resist the Mao-inspired
Shining Path group, which began its insurgency two years earlier.
   The fighting spread, claiming more than 14,000 lives and
prompting the government to extend the emergency zones.

<TEXT>
   A witness against the defendant in the
``Night Stalker'' serial murder trial failed to tell the whole
truth, the prosecutor in the case disclosed Monday.
   The unexpected move by Deputy District Attorney P. Philip Halpin
stalled the opening of Richard Ramirez's defense case as Halpin won
permission to reopen his case to question the witness again.
   Jurors were told ``something has come up'' to abort Monday's
court session and were instructed to return Tuesday, when the
witness is to appear.
   Ramirez, 29, a drifter from El Paso, Texas, is charged with 13
gruesome murders and 30 related felonies in a string of nighttime
attacks that terrified southern California in the summer of 1985.
   Halpin said the omitted testimony is ``nothing spectacular. ...
It's not significant evidence.'' But he said he was duty-bound to
reveal the omission, which he discovered after he rested his case
April 13 and the judge ordered a two-week recess.
   Halpin, who had called 137 people to testify since opening his
case Jan. 30, refused to identify the witness or describe the
missing evidence. He said only that the witness told him ``the
testimony was withheld to protect someone, to protect a woman.''
   Ramirez had expected his attorney, Daniel Hernandez, to deliver
his opening statement to the jury.
   ``If the district attorney is going to stop the procedures for
this one witness, it must be very significant,'' Hernandez said
outside court.
   But his co-counsel, Ray Clark, said it was not unusual to find
out that a witness didn't tell the whole truth. ``Most witnesses
fudge,'' he said.
   Halpin said the witness is not a victim or survivor of the Night
Stalker attacks of 1985. He said that during the recess he asked
that a few witnesses be interviewed again by investigators.
   ``There ware a couple of things concerning me,'' he said, ``a
lot of hearsay floating around.''
   He added: ``I don't think the testimony is going to change
anything in this case.''

<TEXT>
   Disney-MGM Studios opened its $400
million theme park on Monday, hoping to lure the nostalgic to its
version of Hollywood's golden era and thrill-seekers to rides that
will take them to places like Catastrophe Canyon.
   The 135-acre complex blends filmmaking with backstage studio
tours and ride-through, walk-through attractions. Movie and TV
production began last summer on its three sprawling sound studios
and backlot street scenes.
   The new attraction on the entertainment giant's 43-square-mile
Central Florida resort complements its other two theme parks: the
Magic Kingdom and Epcot Center. It has its own admission fee: $29
for adults and $23 for children 3 to 9.
   Disney Chairman Michael Eisner and comedian Bob Hope were on
hand to do the opening day honors on an outdoor stage in front of a
re-creation of Grauman's Chinese Theater on Hollywood Boulevard.
   ``It's the largest theme park run by actors, or cartoon
characters, unless you want to count Washington D.C.,'' joked Hope.
   ``The world you have entered was created by the Walt Disney
Company and is dedicated to Hollywood ... a world that never was
and always will be,'' Eisner told the crowd.
   A Pennsylvania carpenter and his family led the way through the
gates as the first visitors at the Florida attraction.
   ``We wanted to be first and beat the crowd but never expected
anything like this,'' said Allan Gutierrez, 37, as he and his wife,
two daughters and father-in-law strolled into the park.
   ``It's incredible,'' said Mary Gutierrez, 37, about their
back-to-back appearances on national television and meetings with a
gamut of Hollywood stars attending the grand-opening ceremonies.
   Disney officials would not disclose attendance figures, but at
least 15,000 were expected for opening day. Most attractions were
crowded, and Disney officials had to close the parking lot at 9:15
a.m., just an hour after opening. The lot was reopened at 2 p.m.
   Disney hopes to attract 3 million to 5 million visitors a year.
   The grand opening followed a star-studded weekend of parties and
previews for 3,000 journalists and family members, plus thousands
of other invited guests.
   Some 40 movie and television stars attended a Saturday night
gala and paraded down the park's Hollywood Boulevard in vintage
automobiles Saturday night. Among them were Bette Midler, Lauren
Bacall, George Burns, Audrey Hepburn, Betty White and Kevin Costner.
   At the same time Disney was opening a new park, Eisner announced
another project: a second nighttime entertainment attraction to be
called Disney Boardwalk. It will have restaurants, retail shops and
nightclubs reminiscent of Atlantic City in the 1930s and 1940s.
Boardwalk is expected to open in 1992.
   The ambience is nostalgic, and the architecture is art deco,
similar to oldtime Miami and the newly restored South Miami Beach
area.
   Major park features, in addition to the two-hour backstage tour,
include The Great Movie Ride, the Indiana Jones Epic Stunt
Spectacular theater show, Catastrophe Canyon, a Monster Sound Show
and an Animation Center.
   Disney had a full year's jump on a similar, but larger, complex
that will be operated by Universal Studios Florida just a few miles
down the road. The $500 million attraction is an outgrowth of the
Universal Studio Tour in California and is owned by MCA Inc.
   Movie and television production began there last fall and its
tour portion is to open next May.
   Officials of both parks downplay any talk of intense rivalry,
although Eisner was once accused of stealing the idea of a studio
tour from MCA. Eisner said over the weekend any bitterness between
the two entertainment companies was ``a false media situation.''

<HEAD>Congress to Take Close Look at Request for More B-1 Money</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers said Monday that Congress, painfully
aware of the more than $20 billion invested in the B-1 bomber, will
take a close look at an Air Force request for an additional $1.2
billion to correct major flaws.
   ``It doesn't make a lot of sense not to make the B-1 work if you
can do it,'' said Rep. Marvin Leath, D-Texas, a member of the House
Armed Services Committee. ``We really have to put the arm on the
Air Force.''
   The service has proposed spending the extra $1.2 billion over
five years to improve the B-1, the swing-wing plane resurrected by
then-President Reagan in 1981 as the answer to the aging of the
nation's force of nuclear-armed bombers.
   The B-1B fleet has experienced major problems. Three of the
original 100 ordered by Reagan have crashed and two months ago the
General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress,
concluded that the cost of planned improvements could be nearly
$400 million for each bomber.
   The GAO cited problems with the aircraft's defense system and
also troubles with fuel leaks.
   In a memorandum circulated to members of the House Armed
Services procurement subcommittee last week, committee chairman Les
Aspin, D-Wis., questioned whether spending more money would solve
the fleet's problems.
   ``Even when these fixes are made, the plane will fall far short
of the original electronic countermeasure specifications. We'll
have to decide if improvement planned is worth the money,'' Aspin
said.
   Congress will review the request within the next two months as
part of the defense authorization process.
   Rep. Andy Ireland, R-Fla., a member of the Armed Services
Committee, said the country has spent more than $20 billion on the
fleet, and abandoning that investment would be difficult.
   ``We do have 97 already invested. We need to finish them up
again under close scrutiny,'' said Ireland.
   The Florida Republican said the B-1 ``performs substantially as
expected in a lot, a lot of ways,'' but an ``area of skepticism
needs to prevail.''
   In addition to the funding request for the B-1, the Air Force
also has proposed shifting nearly $300 million for procurement of
the B-2 stealth bomber to research and development on the aircraft.
   ``We have to take a long, hard look at the B-2,'' said Leath.
``That thing is going to consume tons and tons of money, and I'm
not sure at this point after going through the B-1 if we're up to
that.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has already proposed pushing back
production of the B-2 to 1993, and almost $4.1 billion is being cut
from the fiscal 1990 and 1991 budgets for the radar-evading plane.
Recent estimates of $500 million per plane would make it the most
expensive in history.

   City officials fed up with unruly Grateful
Dead fans and drug use at weekend concerts said they will try to
ban future appearances by the rock band.
   About 100 people were arrested during concerts Friday, Saturday
and Sunday for various offenses, most involving drug possession,
police said. ``All of the LSD and other drugs we confiscated was
just incredible,'' said police Sgt. Al Murray.
   Hundreds of fans turned up without tickets to see the sold-out
concert Saturday. Police declared an emergency and called in
reinforcements from other cities when about 100 fans tried to storm
the Irving Meadows amphitheater, which seats about 15,000 people.
   Several officers were hit with flying objects, but no one was
seriously hurt, Sgt. Steve Olson said.
   ``They were a mob out of control,'' said City Councilman Cameron
Cosgrove.
   Dennis McNally, manager for the Grateful Dead, said Monday he
saw no problems.
   ``The Grateful Dead is a large and sometimes rambunctious
traveling circus, and we work hard to makes sure the things we do
are in the spirit of good neighbors,'' McNally said. ``When it
fails, we try to make it better.''
   Cosgrove and Mayor Larry Agran said they will investigate
whether the city has the right to ban the band.
   The Grateful Dead has been recording since the 1960s and have
inspired devotees, who call themselves dead heads, to follow the
band across the country.

   U.S. and Japanese searchers combed waters off the
southern island of Kyushu for two crewmen of a U.S. Navy submarine
who were washed overboard Monday by a wave during predawn surface
operations.
   Navy officials said the diesel-powered Barbel was carrying out a
routine mission earlier in the day when a wave crashed onto its
desk, sweeping away three crewmen. They gave no details on what the
operation involved.
   One of the crewmen, identified by the Navy as Lt. Richard
Davenport of Norfolk, Va., was rescued by the submarine soon
afterward. Medical personnel on the submarine were treating him for
mild hypothermia, U.S. military spokesman Master Gunnery Sgt. Jake
Rodrigues said.
   The missing men were identified as fireman apprentice James
David Lear of Washburn, Ill. and Lt. Walter Gray Womble II of
Virginia Beach, Va.
   The three crewmen were standing watch without life jackets
because the seas looked relatively calm, Navy officers said.
   Kiyoshi Harada, spokesman for Japan's Maritime Safety Agency,
said the accident occurred about 31 miles southwest of Noma Cape in
Kagoshima Prefecture, or state. The area off Japan's southernmost
main island is about 650 miles southwest of Tokyo.
   Fog and high-wind alerts were in effect at the time of the
accident, but the height of the waves and wind speed are not known,
according to Yoshikazu Nakamura of the local branch of the Maritime
Self-Defense Force.
   The Barbel and another U.S. vessel joined several Japanese ships
and airplanes in the search that went on into Monday night,
officials of both countries said.
   A Japanese Defense Agency official said the submarine had
surfaced before the accident because it was taking on water from a
hatch. He spoke on condition of anonymity and refused to elaborate.
   But a U.S. Navy spokesman based in Yokosuka denied that report.
``We have no information that there is anything wrong with the
Barbel,'' said Navy Lt. Jeff Gradeck.
   However, a Pentagon spokesman said the submarine had some
electrical problems after the wave that hit the men also washed
into its conning tower, which is used as an entrance. The damage
was quickly repaired, said Lt. Cmdr. Jim Kudla, a Pentagon
spokesman.
   The Barbel, built in 1956, is equipped with six torpedo tubes
and normally carries a crew of 77, U.S. military officials said.
The 219-foot-long, 2,145-ton vessel belongs to the last non-nuclear
combat submarine class built by the Navy.

<TEXT>
   Afghan government commanders have issued
Soviet-made gas masks to their troops in the besieged city of
Jalalabad, according to a telephone reports from guerrilla leader.
   Gen. Abdul Rahim Wardak, military commander of the National
Islamic Front of Afghanistan, conveyed the information by telephone
from Peshawar, Pakistan, on April 25 to Marin Strmecki, a
Washington-based analyst who recently returned from Jalalabad.
   ``He informed me by telephone that the Afghan government troops
had been issued gas masks and other chemical warfare equipment, for
example, protective suits and the launchers for chemical warfare
shells,'' Strmecki said Monday.
   The troops, loyal to the Soviet-backed government in Kabul, have
not used chemical weapons to break the siege, said Strmecki, an
aide to former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
   Some reports have implied the failure of the attack against
Jalalabad, involving an estimated 15,000 anti-communist Mujahedeen
guerrillas and a slightly smaller force loyal to the Soviet-backed
government.
   The city, in eastern Afghanistan, was viewed as a gateway to
Kabul.
   Another recent visitor to Afghanistan, Charles Schnabel,
assistant to Rep. Charles Wilson, D-Texas, said he saw Soviet-made
gas masks during a trip to other parts of Afghanistan that ended
last Dec. 13.
   ``I was going to bring some back, but I got tired of carrying
them. These were a long way inside Afghanistan,'' said Schnabel.
   The congressional aide said he heard numerous reports of the use
of chemical weapons, but found no eyewitnesses and did not believe
government troops would use them to defend Jalalabad.
   ``If your back is to the wall, you might do something like that.
There appears to me to a stalemate. So it doesn't appear to me that
they would use it,'' he said.
   Strmecki did not depict the battle as a stalemate, and forecast
a Mujahedeen victory.
   Wardak reported the Mujahedeen ``are slowly and inexorably
tightening a ring around Jalalabad,'' and are within three miles of
the city center, Strmecki said.
   Strmecki said he had visited the eastern and northern edges of
Jalalabad on March 12, six days after Mujahedeen began their siege.
   Government forces, he said, were inflicting heavy casualties on
the guerrillas with high altitude bombing runs by MiG-27 fighters
and converted Antonov-12 transport planes operating above the range
of U.S.-supplied Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, said Strmecki.
   The Jalalabad airport has been closed since the siege began, and
government resupply efforts have been confined to about 20 or 25
helicopter deliveries per day, he said.

   Speaker Jim Wright, now defending himself
against House ethics charges, in 1985 inserted in Congress'
official journal his effusive endorsement of a home video program
sold by a company employing his wife.
   In the endorsement, later used by the company for promotional
material, Wright praised the program as ``a marvelously useful home
video tool.''
   Congressional rules generally bar members from receiving
benefits as a result of improperly exerting their position, and
guidelines caution lawmakers against becoming so ``affiliated with
a particular enterprise'' that it creates an appearance of
impropriety.
   The speaker, who is defending himself against charges that he
broke House rules 69 times over the past decade, has argued
recently that the career of his wife, Betty, is totally separate
from his work as a member of Congress.
   But in the Dec. 9, 1985 edition of the Congressional Record,
Wright inserted a 350-word endorsement of the Pacific Institute's
family video series that Mrs. Wright had helped develop. He did not
mention her $36,000-a-year job at the Seattle, Wash., company or
role in its production.
   ``It was a nice gesture. We didn't ask for it,'' said Jack
Fitterer, the company's chief operating officer. ``We were
pleasantly surprised.''
   Asked Monday about the incident, Wright said he would have no
comment.
   In the endorsement, Wright calls the marketing of the video ``a
heartening development indeed'' and notes that the series is
``available at a nominal price within the range of most American
families.'' The tapes sold for $34.95 each.
   He also terms the taped motivational program ``a marvelously
useful home video tool to promote togetherness and really
productive family conversation.''
   Wright adds: ``From its base in Seattle, Wash., the Pacific
Institute has drawn upon the skills of professional educators and
specialists in personal and family development to perfect a series
of 21 home video programs .... The institute promises to make these
services available widely throughout the country.''
   The company later reprinted Wright's Congressional Record
comments as promotional material for its video series.
   Any member of Congress is free to insert material into the
Congressional Record, which is the daily journal of Congress'
official floor activities. But the rules generally bar any member
from receiving benefits ``which would occur by virtue of influence
improperly exerted from his position in the Congress.''
   The guidelines also caution lawmakers not to become ``too
closely affiliated with a particular enterprise'' to prevent the
appearance that the rule is being broken. They say further that
``communications should be drafted so that they do not lend
themselves to misinterpretation as an official endorsement from the
Congress.''
   And the rules specifically bar members from letting their
congressional stationery be used by outsiders for commercial
promotions.
   In addition to charging Wright with 69 instances of House rules
violations, the ethics panel is continuing to investigate a Texas
gas well deal that brought huge profits to Wright's blind trust in
a short period last year. Wright's ties to the Pacific Institute
and his wife's employment are not currently subjects of the ethics
probe.
   It is not known whether the committee was previously aware of
Wright's submission of the promotional material to the Record,
first reported Monday by the Wall Street Journal.
   But Betty Wright's employment by another company, the investment
partnership she and her husband had with Fort Worth real estate
developer George Mallick and his wife Marlene, is central to the
ethics probe. The panel found reason to believe that $18,000-a-year
job from 1981 through 1984 was nothing more than a conduit for
gifts from Mallick to the Wrights.
   Mrs. Wright's employment at the two companies overlapped for
several months.
   She was hired by Pacific Institute founder Lou Tice in September
1984, and she worked for the company for $36,000 a year through
1987. During that time, Tice met numerous corporate executives and
lobbyists through the Wrights, including at an appearance in 1985
at the annual retreat of House Democrats to the Greenbrier resort
in West Virginia.
   Mrs. Wright also ran one of Tice's motivational seminars for
Wright's congressional staff during the time she worked for the
company, according to people who attended the two-day session in a
Capitol meeting room.
   Tice's motivational message is based on the ``power of positive
thinking'' model often used in sales. He encourages people to boost
their own self-image, ``visualize'' their possibilities and screen
out negative thoughts. Wright himself is said by colleagues to be
an strong adherent of Tice's message.
   In a related development, five Texans subpoenaed to testify
before the ethics panel on Wednesday about a gas drilling venture
attacked the report of committee counsel Richard Phelan as
misleading.
   In a report issued by their Washington lawyer, Stanley Brand,
the group argued that a geological formation struck by the well
continues to be promising even though the well so far has been
unable to produce commercial quantities of gas or oil.
   The report states that Phelan, in characterizing the lucrative
sale of Wright's share in the venture as a gift, has shown ``a
fundamental misunderstanding of the oil business.'' The remaining
partners in the venture plan to spend $2 million more to drill
again because they estimate some $88 million in recoverable oil and
gas is present in their leased tract near the Louisiana-Texas line.
   Brand said the group, which includes San Antonio financier
Morris Jaffe and his son, M.D. Jaffe, has not yet decided whether
to honor the ethics committee's subpoena calling for them to
testify on Wednesday and Thursday.

<HEAD>Arafat Expects Paris Visit to Aid Peace</HEAD>

   Yasser Arafat said he expects his first
official visit to Paris on Tuesday to give Middle East peace
efforts a ``push forward.''
   The Palestine Liberation Organization chairman said in an
interview Monday he has ``great confidence'' in Francois
Mitterrand, the French president, as ``a man of principles and a
supporter of the cause of justice.''
   He criticized French Jewish leaders who have protested the visit
and declared: ``I'm sure those who are interested in seeing peace
prevail will change their minds and support the visit, which will
certainly give further impetus to peace moves.''
   Jewish groups have said they will mount protests during the
two-day visit. Arafat will meet with Mitterrand, Premier Michel
Rocard and Foreign Minister Roland Dumas.
   He will be accompanied by Farouk Kaddoumi, head of the PLO
political department; Yasser Abed-Rabbo, the information director,
and Mohammed Milhem and Mahmoud Darwish, members of the Executive
Committee.
   Kaddoumi acts as the PLO foreign minister and Abed-Rabbo has led
the PLO team in meetings with the United States in Tunis.
   PLO sources said Arafat's media adviser, Bassam Abu Sharif, and
spokesman Ahmed Abdel-Rahman also would make the trip to Paris.
   Washington ended its 13-year ban on dealings with the PLO in
December and initiated a dialogue after Arafat renounced terrorism
and recognized Israel's right to exist.
   The changed U.S. attitude and nearly 17 months of Palestinian
rebellion against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip have helped alter Western Europe's perception of the PLO.
Several countries have begun direct contacts.
   Arafat said in the interview, at his heavily guarded military
headquarters in Baghdad: ``I will discuss with President Mitterrand
everything ... including our peace initiatives.
   ``I will be ready to hear from him his ideas on the Middle East
and the Palestinian issue in particular. I have great expectations
that my visit to France and my meetings there will push forward the
peace efforts in the region.''
   In Paris, about 2,000 police were mobilized for the visit,
authorities said. Sharpshooters were stationed on rooftops and
helicopters patrolled overhead.
   Simultaneous demonstrations were planned for Tuesday evening,
one by Arafat supporters and the other by Jewish protesters.
   Premier Rocard told journalists Sunday night the protocol would
not equal that accorded a chief of state because Arafat ``is
neither a head of state nor a prime minister. He is being treated
according to his level of dignity.''
   Neither Mitterrand nor Rocard will meet Arafat at Orly airport,
for example.
   An independent Palestinian state was declared last November at a
meeting of the Palestine National Council, which acts as the PLO
legislature.
   On Monday, the Israeli Foreign Ministry complained that the
insignia adopted for it features a map incorporating most of Israel.
   ``It is worrying,'' a ministry official said privately. ``They
say they want the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Now they introduce
a logo, and it includes Israel.''
   He gave reporters copies of two letters with the insignia, one
signed by Arafat and the other by Nabil Ramlawi, PLO representative
to the United Nations in Geneva.
   In the insignia's center is a map that includes the West Bank,
Gaza Strip and all of Israel except the Golan Heights.
   Israel captured the three territories in the 1967 Middle East
war. It annexed the Golan Heights, taken from Syria, in December
1981.

   President Bush is expected to name one of the
State Department's most experienced Latin American hands as
ambassador to the Organization of American States as part of a plan
to revitalize that 31-member institution, U.S. officials said
Monday.
   Luigi Einaudi, 52, director of policy planning at the State
Department since 1977, is in line to replace former Ambassador
Richard McCormack in the OAS post, said the officials, who asked
not to be identified.
   Einaudi has been a right hand man to the last six assistant
secretaries of state for inter-American affairs. He was once
described by former Secretary of State George P. Shultz as ``the
State Department's leading expert on U.S.-Latin American
relations.''
   At one time, the OAS was the principal forum for hemispheric
debate but it has declined in importance over the past generation.
The officials said Secretary of State James A. Baker III envisions
a more active role for the OAS in narcotics control and other areas.
   In response to a budget crisis that was partly brought on by the
U.S. failure to pay its promised share, the OAS has negotiated
early retirement for about 300 employees over the past several
weeks, which is about 30 per cent of the workforce, the officials
said.

   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ordered its
outlets in 26 states Monday to restock Listerine pulled from
shelves over the weekend after a woman said the mouthwash burned
her mouth.
   Officials at Wal-Mart headquarters in Bentonville began
notifying managers of the chain's 1,279 stores to return thousands
of bottles of the mouthwash to shelves after extensive testing by
manufacturer Warner-Lambert Co.
   Warner-Lambert rushed the unused portion of the suspect bottle
through analysis Sunday night at its New Jersey laboratory, and
conducted more tests early Monday. The tests found only normal
product ingredients.
   The mouthwash was removed from Wal-Mart shelves Saturday.
   ``We believed from the beginning this was an isolated incident.
However, we chose not to take any chances,'' said Don Fields,
Wal-Mart's executive vice president for merchandising. ``The safety
and well-being of our customers come first.''
   Listerine was expected to be back on the shelves of all Wal-Mart
stores by Monday night, said company spokesman Don Shinkle.
   Wal-Mart officials have not determined how much removing the
mouthwash had cost the company, Shinkle said. He said no one was
second-guessing the decision to do so.
   ``We stand by our decision and feel it was the thing to do,''
Shinkle said. ``Our customers would more than agree with that.''
   The woman, whom company officials have declined to identify,
complained Saturday that her mouth was red and irritated after
using Listerine she bought at a Wal-Mart Store in Rogers, Ark. She
sought treatment from a dentist and ``is fine,'' Shinkle said.
   Barry S. Cohen, a spokesman for Warner-Lambert in Morris Plains,
N.J., said no other problems had been reported with Listerine,
which is made at a plant in Lititz, Pa.
   ``It's a 125-year-old product. It's shipped around the country.
If there's some problem with the product we would have received
other calls, but we haven't,'' Cohen said.
   No ingredient in Listerine would cause burns, even when mixed in
excessive amounts, Cohen said. The mouthwash is marketed as an
antiseptic, however, and can cause an astringent, tingly sensation.
   Wal-Mart has stores in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado,
Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico,
North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas,
Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

   The number of Palestinians killed by soldiers
in April was the second highest monthly total of the long uprising
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, an Israeli human rights
group said Monday.
   Also Monday, Palestinian sources said PLO officials abroad
approve most orders to kill Arabs suspected of collaborating with
Israel.
   The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the
Territories said soldiers killed 34 Palestinians in April, but the
army disputed the figure. The organization said the monthly total
was second only to 44 killed in April 1988.
   Doctors at Mukassad hospital in Jerusalem said 10-year-old Samir
Merai died Monday of a wound suffered Wednesday in a confrontation
with soldiers at the Tulkarem refugee camp in the West Bank.
   They said he was hit by a plastic bullet that penetrated his eye
and lodged in his brain. The army said it was checking the report.
   Ahed Ramini, a 30-year-old Palestinian was stabbed to death
Monday as an alleged collaborator with Israel.
   A military spokesman confirmed Ramini was killed by masked
youths in Tulkarem town and said the circumstances were being
investigated. The army put the town under curfew, ordering all
30,000 residents to remain at home.
   Chaim Ben Lulu, a 52-year-old Jewish settler arrested in
connection with the shooting death of a 14-year-old Palestinian,
was released on bail of about $13,880.
   Police said he still could be charged in the attack, which
occurred Friday in the West Bank city of Hebron.
   ``I clearly acted in self-defense,'' Ben Lulu said on Israel
radio after his release. Newspapers had quoted him earlier as
saying he fired into the air.
   Palestinians and Israeli Arabs used May Day on Monday to
demonstrate for an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank
and Gaza. About 2,000 people marched in Nazareth.
   Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse about 50
marchers in Arab east Jerusalem, slightly injuring three.
Authorities said the demonstrators did not have a permit and 15
were arrested.
   Arab reports said soldiers wounded 15 Palestinians in the West
Bank and Gaza, including a 16-year-old boy with a serious chest
wound. The army confirmed three people were wounded.
   The human rights center, founded by leftist parties and peace
movements, said 33 of the Palestinian fatalities in April were
caused by gunshot wounds and the 34th died of beating injuries
inflicted by soldiers.
   An army spokesman said 28 Palestinians were killed and death
tolls were higher in several other months.
   According to the human rights group, 423 Palestinians have been
killed by army gunfire in the uprising. The army figure is 351.
   An Associated Press count shows 458 Palestinian deaths,
including 41 people killed by other Palestinians as suspected
collaborators. Eighteen Israelis also have died.
   Alon Liel, Foreign Ministry spokesman, said at least 10 alleged
collaborators were killed in April, ``the bloodiest month from the
point of view of Palestinian attacks on Palestinians.''
   ``It isn't a coincidence that it came in the month after (Prime
Minister Yitzhak) Shamir suggested elections in the territories''
to chose Palestinians to negotiate an interim peace agreement, he
said.
   Liel said he did not know if any of the victims supported
Shamir's election plan. Palestinian sources say those slain by
other Palestinians are killed for informing and other acts of
collaboration, not for their political beliefs.
   Palestinian sources said local Palestinian activists conduct
underground ``trials'' of Arabs suspected of collaborating with
Israel, and then PLO officials abroad approve most orders to kill
those found guilty.
   The PLO headquarters in Tunis had no immediate comment on the
report.
   The Palestinian sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the orders to kill the alleged collaborators were made by a
Moslem clergyman believed to be based in Iraq.
   The sources said orders are relayed via coded messages broadcast
by Baghdad Radio.
   Israeli soldiers detained a former Jordanian Parliament member,
Farouq Hamdallah, for ``security reasons,'' said the army without
elaborating.
   Israel radio said Hamdallah was detained after endorsing
Palestinian attacks on Arab collaborators in a newspaper interview
this week.
   Hamdallah, of the West Bank town of Anabta, was one of 30
Palestinians who represented the territory in the Jordanian
legislature from 1984 to 1988.

   An American sailor who vanished from a U.S.
base in Naples nine months ago and was feared dead turned up alive
Monday, hours after her photograph appeared on television, Italian
authorities said.
   A highway patrolman saw Jennifer Muir, a 22-year-old Navy petty
officer third class, on a roadside outside Villa San Giovanni in
southern Calabria at about 4 a.m. and recognized her, said police
Col. Antonino Di Vincenzo.
   The ANSA news agency said another patrolman also saw the show
about missing persons broadcast Sunday night by RAI-TV. On it, Miss
Muir's father Thomas, an IBM engineer from Trumbull, Conn.,
appealed for help in finding her.
   She vanished July 29 from a U.S. military base in Naples and
Italian police originally suspected foul play.
   Di Vincenzo said Monday from police headquarters in Reggio
Calabria: ``She's fine and has been reunited with her father.''
   He said Miss Muir apparently had been living with a man in Villa
San Giovanni, in the toe of the Italian boot.
   Police brought her to Naples on Monday evening for questioning
by a magistrate before being turned over to U.S. military
authorities, ANSA said.
   Lt. Paul Weishaupt, a U.S. Navy spokesman in Naples, said
earlier that Italian authorities informed the Navy they had an
American woman in custody who identified herself as Jennifer Muir.
   Miss Muir had been assigned to the U.S. Military Sealift Command
in Naples.
   In October, an Italian magistrate named an American seaman as
being suspected of murder and concealing a body. He was delivered
to U.S. custody later and no charges have been filed, Weishaupt
said.

   Police on Monday charged a
22-year-old civil servant with murder in a shooting spree that
killed one man and wounded 14 people in a coastal town.
   Lawmakers called for tightening Britain's already strict gun
control laws following the 15-minute shotgun rampage Sunday
afternoon.
   Police arrested Robert Sartin, 22, shortly after the attack in
Monkseaton, a fashionable suburb of the Whitley Bay seaside resort
in northeast England. Dressed in black and wearing sunglasses and
an ammunition belt, the gunman walked the streets shooting
indiscriminately, witnesses said.
   Kenneth Mackintosh, 41, married and the father of two children,
was killed. Four of the 14 wounded remained hospitalized Monday,
three in serious condition.
   On Monday, police granted the suspect a five-minute visit with
his parents, then announced his identity and said he was charged
with the slaying of Mackintosh.
   Detective Superintendent Bob Benton told reporters Sartin
probably will be charged with other offenses later.
   A neighbor of Sartin said she was ``absolutely stunned'' to hear
of the young man's arrest. The woman, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said ``he was always a nice boy. ... He has never given
any trouble here.''
   Police said the shotgun found in his car during his arrest was
licensed to his father.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, the Cabinet minister responsible
for law and order, asked for a police report into the shootings.
   Britain's gun laws were tightened following the country's worst
mass murder in August 1987. Gun collector Michael Ryan ran through
Hungerford, 60 miles west of London, killing 16 people, including
his mother, before turning his gun on himself.
   The new laws banned sawed-off shotguns, mortars and self-loading
rifles, a high-powered weapon similar to that used by Ryan.
   Britons were already prohibited from owning such automatic
weapons as machine guns and must obtain a license to own other
weapons. Applicants for gun licenses must satisfy police they have
a good reason to own each firearm and its ammunition, a suitable
place to use them and can store them securely to prevent theft.
   But police and lawmakers said Monday that too many loopholes
remain in the law.
   ``It's far too easy for people to get ahold of shotguns,'' said
Alan Eastwood, chairman of the Police Federation, which represents
more than 120,000 police officers.
   Lawmaker David Winnick of the opposition Labor Party said the
government should make it more difficult for individuals to obtain
a license to own a shotgun. His colleague, Ted Leadbitter, called
for a ban on individuals owning any firearms for private use.
   However, Anthony Beaumont-Dark, member of Parliament for the
governing Conservative Party, cautioned against a ``knee-jerk
reaction.''
   The British Association for Shooting and Conservation said
tighter laws were not the answer.
   ``There are nearly a million legitimate shotgun holders in
Britain,'' said director John Swift. ``One man dressed in black
leather with a knife strapped to his thigh has nothing to do with
those ordinary men and women who take part in country shooting.''

   The United States averted a potentially
serious rift in U.S.-Japanese relations by going ahead with the
controversial agreement for the two countries to develop jointly a
new jet fighter for Japan, the new American ambassador to Tokyo
said Monday.
   Ambassador Michael Armacost told reporters that despite
persistent, strong objections to the project on Capitol Hill, ``I'm
confident it will meet with the acquiescence of our Congress.''
   President Bush announced Friday that the United States intends
to proceed with the FSX fighter program because it is ``in the
strategic and commercial interests of the United States.''
   After taking office in January, Bush ordered a review of the $7
billion project negotiated under his predecessor, Ronald Reagan.
Critics in Congress and the Commerce Department have said it
amounts to a giveaway of U.S. high technology and have said Japan
should make an ``off-the-shelf'' aircraft purchase, as do other
nations that are U.S. customers.
   Armacost brought up the negative side of scrapping the agreement
in an appearance at the Washington Foreign Press Center on the eve
of his departure for Japan, where he is due next week.
   Proceeding with the FSX project ``is important from our
standpoint because of what it avoided, namely (America and Japan)
going down separate tracks,'' he said. ``It avoids what could have
been an important breach in our relationship if this deal had gone
awry.''
   The FSX agreement ``is a good arrangement for both our
governments. We have had coproduction in past, but major
codevelopment is in a sense the first'' such arrangement with
Japan, said Armacost, a former undersecretary of state for
political affairs.
   ``I hope this will be a model of the flow of two-way technology
which is quite appropriate to a more mature relationship between
our countries in this field,'' the ambassador said.
   The White House said Monday that, with Japan, Bush ``has been
very tough in demanding equity for the United States in terms of
its commercial interests,'' and he ``was successful in getting
everything he asked for.'' Friday's announcement said U.S.
companies would be guaranteed about 40 percent of the production
work on the planned 130 new fighters while certain computer codes
from the U.S. F-16 jet, which provides the model for the FSX, would
be withheld.

<HEAD>Political Activist Annie Ackerman Dead At 75</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORTH MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Annie Ackerman, the powerful
political activist whose support was courted by candidates ranging
from condominum board members to a president, died Monday after an
eight-year battle with cancer. She was 75.
   Ms. Ackerman died in her sleep at her condominium early Monday,
said her daughter, Kay Fleisher of Plantation.
   Her political friends included President Jimmy Carter, fellow
Democrats Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis, and nearly every
well-known Democratic politician in Florida.
   Ms. Ackerman successfully roused retirees from political apathy
and mobilized them into powerful voting blocs. Famed for turnouts
ranging past 90 percent, they were dubbed ``condo commandos.''
   ``She articulated the values and aspirations of tens of
thousands of people who moved to northeast Dade County for their
retirement,'' said state Rep. Mike Abrams, a Democrat and a
strategist for national and statewide political candidates.
   ``She kind of embodied their continued interest in the community
they live in,'' Abrams said. ``It would have been so easy for all
these people to come to Florida and just retire. Instead, they
became a force of leadership.''
   At age 5, Ms. Ackerman joined her father on a garment workers'
picket line, beginning a life of political activism that included
volunteer work for the campaigns of the late Mayor Richard Daley of
Chicago and accelerated when she and her husband moved to a
waterfront Florida condominium in 1969.
   ``She recognized a void, a need for community involvement, and
she filled that void,'' Ms. Fleisher said. ``She was never afraid
to speak her mind and the community is far better off today than
when she arrived.''
   Although she was most visible during electoral campaigns, Ms.
Ackerman marshaled protests and campaigns on issues ranging from
water pollution to condominium reform.
   Her husband, Irving, a retired insurance executive from Chicago,
died six years ago.
   Besides Ms. Fleisher, she is survived by a daughter, Annette
Ansel, and a son, Alan Ackerman, both of Chicago, eight
grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

<HEAD>Eight Youths On Hunger Strike in Soviet Georgia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight men from Soviet Georgia were holding a
hunger strike in a Tbilisi hospital and demanding an antidote to
gas used by soldiers to quell a nationalist demonstration, a
Georgian activist said Monday.
   The men, ranging in age from 19 to 26, have been fasting since
Friday, said David Nadiradze, a member of a Georgian
pro-independence group. He said they also are demanding an
inspection by the International Red Cross.
   Nadiradze said in a telephone interview that the strike aimed to
``defend the poisoned people,'' referring to the dozens of Tbilisi
residents still hospitalized with symptoms that Georgian health
officials say resemble the effects of nerve gas.
   At least 20 people died and 1,100 were injured in ethnic unrest
in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, on April 9. Georgian activists
say the soldiers attacked a peaceful demonstration with shovels,
clubs and chemicals.
   Soviet officials have acknowledged tear gas was used on some
protesters, but they deny nerve gas or other lethal chemical
weapons were turned on the demonstrators.
   Members of a citizen's commission investigating the
confrontation and doctors treating victims say a second gas that
paralyzes the central nervous system was used.
   Georgia's Communist Party chief, Givi Gumbaridze, said some
victims died of gas poisoning.
   The southern republic's minister of internal affairs, Shota
Gorgodze, on Monday denied a military officer's claim that soldiers
and their families have been beaten and their apartments stoned
because citizens blame them for the April 9 confrontation.
   Pravda quoted Gorgodze as saying that his ministry had received
eight reports of attacks against soldiers, and all turned out to be
false. He said no official complaints had come in of attacks
against families, and rumors to that effect proved wrong.
   Gen. I.N. Rodionov, commander of the Caucasus military district,
said Saturday that people in Tbilisi are blaming Red Army soldiers
for the clash and taking revenge on their families.
   He pointed out the troops involved belonged to the Interior
Ministry and suggested they should wear special uniforms that would
help identify them.
   Demonstrations in Georgia first began April 4 when protesters
criticized calls from members of the republic's ethnic Abkhazian
minority to break away because of alleged discrimination by
Georgians.
   Other protesters have demanded Georgia secede from the Soviet
Union because of alleged interference from the central government.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Expansion of private and public health
insurance to the nation's 37 million uninsured is ill-advised
because it doesn't target people who need help most and doesn't
curtail spiraling health care costs, a former health adviser to
President Bush said Monday.
   The testimony from Deborah Steelman, a Washington lawyer and
formerly chief health adviser to the Bush, came as the Senate Labor
and Human Resources opened hearings on the measure introduced by
the panel's chairman, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and Rep. Henry
A. Waxman, D-Calif.
   While Steelman now has no formal ties with the Bush
administration, she is widely regarded as an expert on health
financing issues and the criticism she laid out of the
Kennedy-Waxman bill amounted to a blueprint of the strong
opposition to the legislation that is likely to produce protracted
debate.
   ``This bill offers no proposals to counteract a dangerous trend:
Over the last 15 years, health-care expenditures in the United
States have risen at an average annual rate of 12 percent,'' she
said.
   Kennedy has acknowledged that his bill does not try to get at
the larger issue of across-the-board health cost control, but says
that shouldn't be used as a reason to oppose it.
   Kennedy and other proponents maintain it would be unfair to wait
until broad-based programs to control costs are developed before
extending health care to the uninsured.
   The Massachusetts Democrat has acknowledged that his bill
probably would cost an additional $12 billion a year when fully
phased in about 10 years, but argues that costs should not stand in
the way of a nation taking care of its ill and injured.
   Steelman, however, predicted ``there will be great fanfare over
minor increases totaling less than $500 million nationwide'' and
questioned where the support would come for such massive
expenditures as envisioned by the Kennedy bill.
   ``We have not seen any domestic program increases of this since
at either the state or federal level, since the early 70's,'' she
said.
   She said there are variety of ways to deal with the problem of
the medically insured, but argued that Kennedy's bill tries to do
too much through a government program.
   ``Obviously, the proper role of government and the first
priority of a program for the uninsured must be to cover low-income
individuals through a carefully targeted improved and expanded
Medicaid program,'' she said.
   The bill was supported by a panel of four individuals who
recounted their difficulties in paying medical bills on low
salaries and by representatives of th American Public Welfare
Association, the National Association of Public Hospitals, and the
American Diabetes Association.

<TEXT>
   Native and civil rights groups demand
the state police minister resign because of a manhunt for an
aborigine suspect in which an innocent man was fatally shot and
officers staged a fake arrest.
   An aboriginal activist group even put up posters Monday saying
the New South Wales police minister, Ted Pickering, should be shot.
   The way police conducted their search for a John Porter,
suspected of wounding two officers in Sydney a week ago, has
angered the state ombudsman and political opposition as well as
aboriginal and civil rights organizations.
   Aborigines, already chafing at the slow pace of a government
inquiry into more than 100 black deaths in police custody, accused
authorities of conducting a witch hunt in the search for Porter.
Aboriginal activists claim most of the deaths since 1980 have been
due to police brutality.
   Police Commissioner John Avery urged the suspect to surrender to
avert further bloodshed. He said investigating officers were
``abundantly aware that every move they make will come under
microscopic scrutiny.''
   ``I don't want the suspect to feel too harried or pursued or
he's going to react violently, and that means more lives will be
lost,'' Avery said. ``What we want is to resolve this peacefully
without any more people being killed.''
   Porter's family said he should not surrender.
   Jenny Davies, 28, common-law wife of the suspect's brother,
said: ``If he showed his face, police would shoot him dead. They
wouldn't give him a chance. They would shoot him on sight for sure.
One innocent man has already been shot dead by police over this.''
   Police say Porter emptied an automatic pistol at two policemen
who thought he was trying to steal a car in Sydney a week ago, then
eluded pursuit in the city and is being hunted on a national scale.
   One of the policemen, Alan McQueen, 26, was in critical
condition Monday after surgeons removed a lung, a kidney and part
of his liver. The other wounded man, 19-year Jason Donnelly, was
discharged after treatment for a stomach wound.
   When the hunt began in earnest, ``it was a bad week in Sydney
for colored men with dreadlock hair,'' the Morning Herald said.
Blacks with Rastafarian hairstyles complained of police harassment.
   Officers rounded up dozens of people for questioning, in one
case stopping a car carrying three men from Tonga. One was found to
be in Australia illegally and was deported.
   On Thursday, police stormed the home of David Gundy and fatally
shot the unarmed aborigine. Police initially said Gundy, who was in
bed, lunged at them and went for a gun, but then contradicted the
original statement.
   Richard McDonald, a neighbor, said he overheard a detective
saying: ``I was sure it was him (Porter). He was around the same
size.''
   Another neighbor, Brian Walsh, was awakened by the sound of
police kicking in Gundy's door.
   That same day, police raided six houses in Sydney and Brisbane,
in Queensland state. They fired five stun grenades into the empty
home of Porter's brother and faked an arrest that was filmed for
the evening television news, then told the media it was a hoax.
   The Gundy shooting brought calls for Pickering's resignation and
demands for a Royal Commission of Inquiry, the highest
investigation available, into police conduct.
   On Monday, an aboriginal group calling itself the Coalition
Against Legalized Murder, or CALM, distributed posters in Sydney
that showed Pickering's head framed in a gunsight and said someone
should ``upgrade'' Premier Nick Greiner's government ``with a
bullet.''
   Pickering said he was considering legal action.

<TEXT>
   Syrian forces pounded the coast north of
Beirut on Monday after a night of tank and mortar battles with
Christian army units outside the city despite a three-day truce.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt demanded Christians topple their
Gen. Michel Aoun as a condition for peace, and Aoun charged the
Syrian-Druse alliance broke the cease-fire organized Friday by the
Arab League.
   Police said two Lebanese soldiers were killed and seven
civilians wounded in overnight fighting around the Christian
garrison town of Souk el-Gharb _ the first casualties since Friday.
   Jumblatt's spokesman announced in Damascus, Syria, that
Christian shells Monday killed one of their militiamen and wounded
two.
   This brings the toll to 276 people killed and 1,002 wounded
since March 8, when fighting erupted.
   Rocket-propelled grenades and anti-aircraft fire crackled Monday
across the abandoned commercial district straddling Beirut's port.
   ``This ominous escalation ... threatens plans by the Arab League
to dispatch a pan-Arab observer force to Lebanon to monitor the
truce,'' said a police spokesman who cannot be identified under
regulations.
   Despite the fighting, neither side appears to consider the truce
irretrievable.
   Beirut radio stations said Lakhdar Ibrahimi, the Algerian envoy
of Arab League Secretary-General Chedli Klibi, was due in Beirut
within 24 hours to finalize deployment of the multinational Arab
observer force.
   The police spokesman said at least 45 shells and rockets
exploded on a 10-mile strip of beach between Byblos and Jounieh
ports, paralyzing shipping activity.
   An Aoun spokesman said his units ``fired back in self-defense''
in Souk el-Gharb and Beirut port, but did not respond to shelling
of the Christian coastline.
   Souk el-Gharb sits atop a strategic network of mountain roads.
If it falls, the Moslems will be poised to flush out the Christians
from mountain strongholds protecting their 310-square-mile enclave.
Syrian army troops and the Druse militia outnumber Aoun's mainly
Christian army by 3-1.
   Jumblatt issued a May Day statement saying: ``It's impossible to
reach a compromise with Michel Aoun. He must be removed or
toppled.''
   Aoun, who also heads the Christian Cabinet in Lebanon's dual
government, has refused to call off the blockade of three illegal
harbors run by Moslem militias, which triggered the fighting.
   Although the Arab League cease-fire plan provides for lifting
air, sea and land blockades, Aoun contends his gunboats and
helicopter gunships are ``applying Lebanese laws.''
   The rival Moslem Cabinet under Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss
has insisted raising the blockade ``is an integral part of the Arab
League's peace plan. Without it there will be no cease-fire.''
   Aoun imposed the blockade in a bid to restore state authority
and recoup lost annual taxes of $100 million.
   The rival Cabinets emerged in September after outgoing President
Amin Gemayel and Parliament was unable to elect a new leader.
   The French navy tanker Penhors returned to Lebanese waters
Monday with 15,000 tons of fuel from the European Economic
Community to boost rationed electricty in Beirut.
   The rival Cabinets said the tanker will unload 75 percent of the
shipment in the Christian port of Zouk and the rest in the Moslem
oil terminal of Zahrani.
   Christian radio stations later said the Syrian bombardment
prevented the Penhors from approaching Zouk.
   Police and the French Embassy withheld comment. But Hoss, who
had pledged to the 12-nation trade bloc that no shelling would
occur when the Penhors approached, apologized.
   ``I feel bound to extend my apology to the European Community
for being unable to honor my obligations due to surprise
developments that caused a delay in the unloading operation,'' he
said in a statement.

<HEAD>FDA Panel Recommends Approval of AIDS Drug</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Food and Drug Administration advisory
committee on Monday recommended approval of an aerosolized version
of a drug that helps prevent a life-threatening pneumonia in AIDS
patients.
   The FDA is expected to follow the recommendation and approve an
aerosol version of pentamidine within weeks, said an FDA source who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Aerosolized pentamidine has been widely available to AIDS
patients since the FDA in February allowed its distribution to be
expanded as an experimental medication under government review.
   However, many insurance plans do not cover experimental drugs.
FDA approval would allow nearly universal reimbursement for AIDS
patients using the drug.
   The advisory committee recommended approval of aerosolized
pentamidine for preventing initial and recurring bouts of
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, which causes an estimated 60
percent of AIDS deaths.
   Pentamidine was approved five years ago for use as an injectable
drug to treat those already suffering from pneumocycstis. The spray
version would make it easier to take into the lungs where the
pneumonia infection first shows up.
   The FDA estimated that 50,000 patients with AIDS could benefit
from the treatment.
   The recommendation was based largely on data collected from a
recent clinical trial conducted by the San Francisco Community
Consortium, a group of physicians who treat AIDS patients.
   The trial, which compared the safety of different doses of
aerosolized pentamidine, found that the drug ``did not provide
complete protection, but did significantly reduce the incidence of
this pneumonia,'' the FDA said.
   LyphoMed Inc. of Rosemont, Ill., the leading supplier of
injectable pentamidine, is asking to be licensed to supply the
aerosol version.

<HEAD>Prisoners Riot to Protest Jail Conditions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARRINGTON, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prisoners rampaged through two cell
wings of a jail Monday, and dozens conducted a rooftop protest of
living conditions, prison officers reported.
   The Risley remand center, designed to hold just over 500 men in
single cells, now accommodates 600 men and 140 women awaiting
trial. It is near Warrington, 10 miles east of Liverpool on the
northwest coast.
   Trouble began Sunday night when 17 prisoners tried to overpower
guards who were unlocking cells in B wing for an exercise period,
authorities said.
   Scores of men wrecked furniture and water pipes. A similar
incident began in D wing Monday when it was announced that visits
would be canceled because of the violence, officials said.
   They said B wing was under control Monday night but up to 40
inmates remained on the roof of D wing. Several who hurled objects
from the roof at prison officers wore hoods to hide their faces.
   Three cell areas were wrecked and both wings were flooded by
water from the broken pipes, said Graham Harrison, chairman of the
Risley branch of the Prison Officers' Association.
   Four guards suffered minor injuries to fingers or ribs but no
prisoners were injured, he said.
   Two guards locked themselves in a second-floor cell when the
prisoners broke out, their colleagues said. Rioters tried to enter
the cell to get at the men, but other officers rescued them by
breaking through an outside wall with sledgehammers, they said.
   Banners on the roof repeated common complaints about conditions
in the jail.
   A report last year by the Inspector of Prisons described
conditions at Risley as ``squalid and barbarous.'' The
investigation was conducted after seven suicides were reported at
the jail in 18 months.
   Several prisoner protests, including rooftop demonstrations,
have occurred since.
   Harrison said 250 inmates were moved from Risley to nearby jails
Monday because their cells were smashed.
   ``Most of those who have been moved out have not been involved
in the trouble, but we had to move them because they had nowhere to
sleep,'' he said.

   Thunderstorms rumbled through the Southeast on Monday and heavy
rains drenched much of the East, flooding parts of North Carolina
and Kentucky and washing out two small bridges in Indiana.
   A tornado touched down in southeast Georgia near Leesburg, but
there were no reports of damage.
   A thunderstorm whipped up strong winds south of Lake City, Fla.,
that uprooted trees and produced small hail. Thunderstorm winds
also caused damage in Acree, Ga.
   Thunderstorms and showers extended Monday afternoon from
northern Florida to eastern Alabama, Georgia, the Carolinas,
eastern Tennessee, eastern Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia,
Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio and
southern New York. Scattered rain fell from eastern Iowa to
northeast Minneosta and northwest Illinois.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included more than 2 inches at Atlanta, and more than an 1{ inches
at Troy, Ala., Dothan, Ala., and Cape Hatteras, N.C.
   Heavy thunderstorm rains washed out two small bridges near
Hartsville in southeastern Indiana, and many roads were underwater.
   Rain also caused flooding in the southeast Kentucky towns of
Letcher, Whitesburg and Jenkins, and in Raleigh, N.C.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III called
Monday on Panama's Defense Forces to ensure next Sunday's elections
are fair by blocking what he said are Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's
efforts to rig the balloting through ``massive fraud.''
   Baker issued the unusual appeal in a State Department speech but
left unclear the precise steps he believes the Defense Forces
should take in defiance of their commander.
   Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said later that Baker feels all
institutions in Panama, including the Defense Forces, should do
what is necessary to promote an honest outcome next Sunday.
   Speaking to the Council of the Americas, a business group, Baker
said the military forces are the key to a free election.
   ``They can fulfill their constitutional duty as professional
soldiers and allow the elections to proceed freely and fairly. Or
they can face the consequences of the path on which Gen. Noriega
has placed them,'' Baker said.
   Asked for elaboration, Ms. Tutwiler said Baker was merely
pointing out that all of the people and institutions in Panama,
including the Defense Forces, ``are paying a price because of the
isolation and economic crisis'' resulting from Noriega's rule.
   Meanwhile, four U.S. senators, two from each party, wound up a
visit to Panama and predicted that ``we are about to see a totally
fraudulent election.''
   In a statement, they said they had learned Noriega's government
will be the only organization permitted to count the votes, that
the Panamanian Defense Force which he commands will be responsible
for safeguarding the ballots, that no exit polling will be
permitted and that following the government tally, all ballots will
be burned.
   In a letter, the senators urged the Organization of American
States to demand that Noriega permit the election to be ``free,
fair and open'' and said they were concerned that the continuation
of undemocratic government in Panama ``would also likely result in
a situation dangerous for hemispheric peace.''
   Signing the letter were Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz.; Connie Mack,
R-Fla.; Bob Graham, D-Fla.; and Chuck Robb, D-Va.
   Baker's comments were part of a stepped-up administration effort
to call attention to what officials believe is an effort by Noriega
to stay in power through manipulation of voter lists and other
devices.
   The administration hopes to weaken Noriega as much as possible
by discrediting the election process in advance.
   The principal contest Sunday matches Carlos Duque, a Noriega
ally who is the presidential nominee of a coalition of
pro-government parties, against an opposition slate headed by
Guillermo David Endara.
   Free elections could usher in a new era for financially strapped
Panama, Baker said, but he contended Noriega is preparing for a
``massive fraud and to restrict the presence of international
observers and press.''
   Baker reaffirmed the longstanding U.S. position that there will
be no accommodation with a Noriega-dominated government. With the
help of the Defense Forces, he said, there is still time for the
Panamanians to save their country from the ``increasing destruction
wrought by the Noriega dictatorship.''
   Baker's remarks followed by three days Panamanian charges in the
U.N. Security Council that the United States has interfered in the
election by supplying millions of dollars to opposition candidates
and by sending commandos, special weapons and helicopters to Panama.
   Baker also warned the Soviet Union not to become ideologically
or militarily involved in Central America.
   ``Together with the other democracies, we must send a clear
message to others outside this hemisphere: This is not a dumping
ground for their arms or their failed ideologies.''
   He said the Soviet Union now has an opportunity ``to demonstrate
its so-called new thinking and to demonstrate it in Central
America.''

<HEAD>Sir John Boyd, Former Union Leader, Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir John Boyd, a miner's son who fought off
leftists to lead the powerful British union of engineering workers,
has died. He was 71.
   Boyd died Sunday at his home in Eastbourne, Sussex County, south
of London, the British Broadcasting Corp. said.
   A chairman of the Labor Party in 1967, he was knighted in 1979.
   Boyd started his career as an engineering worker but began work
as a trade union organizer in 1946. He stepped up to the presidency
of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions in 1964.
   Boyd spent years fighting communists and left-wing elements for
control of the 1.5 million-member Amalgamated Union of Engineering
Workers.
   From 1975 to 1982, he served as general secretary of the union,
which is one of the largest in Britain. It includes jobs ranging
from professional electrical engineers to manual workers such as
mechanics.
   He believed that the well-being of workers is tied to the health
of the economy.
   ``We no longer represent a hungry mob of people crying out for
bread,'' he once said, adding that union members ``know that if our
economy breaks down, they will break down with it.''
   From 1967 to 1975, Boyd sat on the general council of the Trades
Union Congress, the national organization of unions. Boyd was a
director of the British Steel Corp. from 1981-86.
   He was married and had two daughters. No information on funeral
services was immediately available.

<BYLINE>New Jersey Students Ask U.N.: Is A Nickel Too Much to Save the
Earth? ^By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A paper lunch tray might cost 5 cents more
than a plastic model that harms the environment, but students who
rid their schools of plastic trays said Monday it was worth a
nickel to help save the Earth.
   Several West Milford, N.J. students told of their successful
anti-plastics battle at U.N. headquarters. They appeared before
hundreds of students at a daylong forum sponsored by the U.N.
Environment Program.
   ``Our battle cry was, `Put your money where your mouth is,'''
said 15-year-old Tanja Vogt, who launched the campaign.
   A majority of the students at West Milford High School and
Macopin Middle School agreed with her and paid an extra nickel for
their cafeteria lunches to be served on cardboard trays.
   The campaign against polystyrene products began when the
teen-ager, inspired by Thomas Paine's revolutionary pamphlet
``Common Sense,'' wrote a civics paper calling for their ban.
Environmentalists say the products, unlike paper, take many years
to break down.
   ``In October, I read an article in our local paper that stated
despite threats to all life, the (school) board continues to use
polystyrene trays in the school cafeteria,'' she said.
   ``The reason given was pure economics. Paper trays cost 5 cents
more than polystyrene.
   ``I was disgusted. I knew the environment was worth an extra
nickel, and I was very confident that my peers would agree,'' she
said.
   For one week last autumn, the schools gave the students a
choice: pay $1.20 for lunch on plastic, or $1.25 for a meal on a
paper tray.
   Seventy-two percent of the high school students and 86 percent
of the middle school students paid the extra nickel for paper trays.
   The Board of Education voted in December to stop purchasing
polystyrene for the township's schools, effective Feb. 1.
   The students have launched a letter-writing campaign to persuade
every school in New Jersey to abolish the use of foam plastics.
   Kurtiz Schneid, 16, said the success of the anti-plastics
campaign led to formation of a West Milford ecology club and to new
initiatives.
   ``I personally visited our local McDonald's dressed as Ronald
McToxic to emphasize our opposition to foam packaging,'' he said.

   Actor-comedian Robin Williams married his
son's former nanny in a private ceremony in Lake Tahoe, a publicist
announced Monday.
   Just a few close friends attended the ceremony Sunday for
Williams, 36, and Marsha Garces, said his publicist, Mark

30s.
   Williams, who starred in television's ``Mork and Mindy'' and
films including ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' and ``The World According

   Williams and his former wife, who filed for divorce last year,
share custody of the boy.

<TEXT>
   A leading Soviet dissident, dismissing
Moscow's reform campaign as a one-sided attempt to save a failed
system, predicted on Monday that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
policies will lead to ``a terrible clash ... bloodshed of huge
proportions.''
   But turmoil inside the Soviet Union could lead Moscow to release
its grip on such eastern European nations as Poland and Hungary,
Vladimir Bukovsky told a forum of democratic leaders from around
the world.
   Bukovsky, who was jailed and sentenced to internal exile in the
Soviet Union, then released in 1976 after an international campaign
on his behalf, now heads the Center for Democracy in the U.S.S.R, a
New York-based human rights group.
   He spoke before the annual conference of the National Endowment
for Democracy, which brought to Washington advocates of democracy
from Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America to present
report cards on what many of the speakers called ``a universal
democratic revolution.''
   The endowment is a U.S.-financed, private-sector attempt to
foster democracy as an alternative to totalitarian and
authoritarian regimes.
   Speaking at the forum in the meeting room of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, Bukovsky contended that in spite of the
widespread impression that genuine reform is taking place in the
Soviet Union, ``the politburo has not moved toward democracy.''
   ``Perestroika is no attempt to establish a free market
economy,'' Bukovsky said. ``Glasnost does not mean the same as
freedom of speech.''
   ``This is an attempt to square a circle, to find a form of
socialism that can survive,'' he said. ``But you cannot square a
circle.''
   Bukovsky predicted ``a terrible clash in the Soviet Union
between the people and the government, bloodshed of huge
proportions.''
   He said the process has already started with the bloody
suppression of demonstrations in Soviet Georgia and the arrest of
nationalists in Soviet Armenia.
   Citing what he said are other signs of a crackdown, Bukovsky
added: ``The good news is that when there is turmoil in the Soviet
system, some countries like Hungary and Poland may have a chance to
get out.''
   He said the West is confused about Gorbachev and his aims and
mistakenly wants to help him with economic credits.
   Instead, he said, the West should be supporting the democratic
opposition inside the Soviet Union because ``the more cohesive and
organized the opposition is, the less likely the government is to
repress it.''
   But Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said it is clear to him there is
a ``new element'' in the Soviet leadership, which is ``prepared to
make major compromises.''
   ``We've got to deal with them,'' Lantos said. ``We are trying to
urge them to establish a social compact with all elements of their
own society.''
   But Bukovsky replied the West is ``doing nothing'' to help the
Soviet Union's democratic forces.
   He asserted that billions of dollars of economic credits, mostly
from West Germany, are flowing into the Kremlin's coffers.
   ``This will prop up the Soviet regime and help them not to
reform,'' he said.
   He suggested that the West allocate 10 percent of any credits
given to the Soviet Union to democratic forces there.

<HEAD>No Right To Lawyer Before Breath Test In Massachusetts, Court Rules</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A motorist suspected of drunken driving has no
constitutional right to an attorney before deciding whether to take
a breath test, the state Supreme Court ruled Monday.
   In a decision overturning a Worcester County judge, the high
court said it could find nothing in the federal or state
constitutions compelling ``the conclusion that a defendant has the
right to counsel before deciding whether to submit to a
Breathalyzer test.''
   In a unanimous opinion, the high court said ``the moment at
which a person must decide to take or to refuse to take a
Breathalyzer test is not a critical stage in the criminal process.''
   Refusal to take the test results in suspension of a driver's
license for 120 days.
   The decision stemmed from an appeal by the Worcester County
district attorney's office in central Massachusetts in a case
involving Roy D. Brazelton, a Worcester-area resident arrested in
1987 for operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol.
   Brazelton was taken to the Worcester police station and booked,
and was advised of his Miranda rights and his right to take a
breath test or blood alcohol test.
   When an officer told Brazelton he couldn't call his attorney
until after he had decided whether to take the breath test,
Brazelton refused the examination.
   District Judge Thomas F. Sullivan Jr. dismissed the charges
against Brazelton on grounds that he should have been allowed to
call his attorney first, saying ``it would not have caused an
unreasonable delay in the administration'' of the test.
   But the high court, in voiding Sullivan's order and remanding
Brazelton's case to trial, said ``formidable practical problems''
could arise if the lower court's ruling stood. For instance, the
justices said, ``If an attorney is not available, a delay may ensue
and the test results may then be stale and inaccurate.''
   Brazelton's attorney, Herbert F. Travers III, said that because
courts in other states have been divided on the question, ``at
least on 14th Amendment (due process) grounds, it may be a proper
issue for determination by the (U.S.) Supreme Court.''
   It was the first time the high court had been asked to decide on
the right to counsel before a breath test.
   Some courts in other states, such as Alaska, have found the
right to counsel on breath tests in their state laws, state
constitutions or the U.S. Constitution.

<TEXT>
   Archbishop Robin Eames, the Anglican
primate of Ireland, made a special appeal Monday for the release of
an Irishman and 14 other foreigners held hostage in Lebanon.
   Eames is among 27 Anglican church leaders attending a weeklong
conference in this Mediterranean tourist resort about 110 miles
from Lebanon.
   ``May I appeal to anyone who has control of Brian Keenan to
release him. To do so would win respect from the world outside,''
Eames said in a written appeal.
   Keenan, 38, from Belfast, Northern Ireland, an English-language
teacher at the American University of Beirut, disappeared while
walking to work on April 11, 1986.
   No organization claimed his abduction, but he is believed held
by pro-Iranian Moslem fundamentalists in Moslem-controlled west
Beirut where 14 other foreigners are also held.
   The other hostages are nine Americans, three Britons _ including
Anglican special envoy Terry Waite _ an Italian and a Belgian.
American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press, was seized on March 16, 1985, and is the longest
held hostage.
   Eames said that ``as a churchman from Brian's home country I
have joined with the other Anglican primates in urging the release
of all hostages.
   ``I write these words in the earnest hope that they may be read
by someone who is in contact with Brian at this time ... In God's
name and in the name of justice and peace I appeal for his
release.''
   The archbishops represent 70 million Anglicans worldwide. Such
meetings are held every three years.

   Police broke up anti-government
protests Monday at an official May Day parade in the capital,
punching some people and detaining at least 76, unofficial sources
said. At least two people were reported injured.
   Several prominent dissidents, including Stanislav Devaty of the
independent Charter 77 movement, and British journalist Misha
Glenny were among those detained, the sources said. Devaty was
recently freed from jail after a hunger strike.
   Protests broke out at the start and close of a 90-minute parade
opened by Communist Party leader Milos Jakes. At least 600 people
shouted demands for more freedom and the release of people they
view as political prisoners, including playwright Vaclav Havel.
   At the beginning of the parade for the day to honor labor, about
100 people unfurled banners supporting Charter 77.
   ``Let Us Live!'' they yelled when police called for them to
disperse. When told their demonstration was illegal, they shouted
back, ``Long Live the First of May!'' and shouted, ``This is
dialogue?''
   Officials have been holding dialogues with young people since
last January, when police used force to end a week of protests.
   Police detained at least 76 people in Prague during Monday's
protests, activist Anna Sabatova said. She said 18 other people
were detained in the city of Brno, but she gave no details.
   Most of those detained were released by early evening.
   Glenny, central Europe correspondent for the British
Broadcasting Corp., said he was punched once in the face after
uniformed police detained him. He said authorities also smashed his
tape reporder on the ground and took his cassette.
   He was held for five hours and released after being fined $10
for not carrying identification papers. Newly arrived at his post,
he was not due to receive official accreditation until Tuesday.
   In London, the Foreign Office said it would protest to
Czechoslovakia about his arrest and treatment.
   Glenny said he was taken to a nearby police station with about
20 other people. He said one of them, peace activist Tomas Tvaroch,
suffered a concussion when police grabbed him and punched him in
the head and back.
   The bulk of the protesters eventually dispersed when hundreds of
security forces marched toward them.
   While embracing economic reform, Jakes and the other Communist
leaders have not endorsed political changes promoted by President
Mikhail Gorbachev in the Soviet Union. This country's current
leadership was installed after the Soviets led a Warsaw Pact
invasion to crush party reforms in 1968.
   Jakes reiterated in his speech opening Monday's rally that
authorities in Czechoslovakia would not allow ``unrest and tension
in society'' or anti-Communist projects under the guise of reform.

   Claims for a record $115.5 million
lottery jackpot were filed Monday by three more potential winners,
including a woman who didn't want any publicity because she feared
the reaction in her drug-infested neighborhood.
   All three are women from Philadelphia: Blanche Downing, 55;
Betty Rubin, a housewife; and Angeline Pavloski, a 69-year-old
retired waitress who plans to split her prize with her brother,
George DeLorenzo.
   Ms. Downing told lottery officials her neighborhood ``has lots
of cocaine activity'' and she fears for her safety now that she has
apparently won a Pennsylvania Super 7 lottery prize worth $8.3
million, to be distributed over the next 26 years.
   She was accompanied by a former Philadelphia policeman and two
other friends. They quickly walked out of lottery headquarters
after filing the claim, trying to duck photographers, and climbed
into a car. She declined to answer reporters' questions.
   Lottery spokeswoman Terry Murphy said the lottery suggested Ms.
Downing not return to her neighborhood.
   ``We realize the position she's in,'' Ms. Murphy said.
   In order to claim her winnings, Ms. Downing had to agree to
allow her name to be used.
   If tickets held by her and the other claimaints prove to be
winners, the first checks will be issued next week, Ms. Murphy
said. The ticket validation process, which started Monday for all
11 of 14 winning tickets presented so far, will be completed
sometime this week, the spokeswoman said. Each annual payment will
be $317,524.67, before taxes.
   Ms. Murphy said lottery officials took a call from a woman in
Maryland who said she had the winning numbers, but wouldn't file a
claim until later in the week. Winners have a year from the date of
the drawing to file a claim.
   Asked why she waited until Monday to file her claim, Mrs. Rubin
said: ``We just had other things to do.''
   Neither Mrs. Rubin, who refused to give her age, nor Mrs.
Pavloski said they had any plans for the money.
   Mrs. Pavloski was sick last week and didn't check her tickets
until Friday, three days after the winning numbers were drawn.
   She said she has played the lottery since its introduction in
1972.
   ``I always said to myself one of these days I'm going to hit
real good. And I never knew I was going to hit this big,'' Mrs.
Pavloski said.
   The $115.5 million jackpot was a North American record. The
previous record was $69.9 million in Illinois, split by four
winning tickets April 15.

<DATELINE>DAKAR, Senegal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of expatriate Senegalese and
Mauritanians flew to their homelands Monday in an airlift aimed at
ending a wave of violence that has left hundreds dead.
   About 55 Mauritanians were reported killed Friday and Saturday
in Dakar and the provinces by angry Senegalese seeking revenge for
the deaths of hundreds of their countrymen in neighboring
Mauritania earlier last week.
   Unconfirmed reports said as many as 400 Senegalese were killed
April 24-25 in Nouakchott, Mauritania's capital, in a wave of
violence that began over a land dispute. Nouakchott is 375 miles
north of Dakar.
   States of emergency and curfews were in effect in both West
African nations' capitals, but vandalism continued in Dakar. The
French news agency Agence France-Presse reported bands of pillagers
attacked the shops of some Lebanese merchants after all
Mauritanian-owned shops were burned or vacated.
   Officials said the airlift, which started in full Sunday, had
carried about 8,720 Senegalese home from neighboring Mauritania by
midday Monday and about 5,785 Mauritanians back home from Senegal.
   France, Spain and Morocco were assisting in the airlift. Planes
were making an average of four round trips per day, airport
officials said.
   Among the Senegalese brought back from Mauritania, some had
their sex organs or limbs mutilated, and most of the corpses
brought home had been decapitated, reporters said.
   Senegalese officials began a program to integrate the returning
citizens and provide measures to fill the vacuum created by the
departure of the Mauritanians, who ran 80 percent of the small
businesses in this country.
   ``Absolute priority is being accorded to the distribution of
basic foodstuffs in Dakar as well as the provinces,'' the Commerce
Ministry said in a statement.
   The violence was prompted by the killing of two Senegalese April
9 in a border village in a dispute over grazing rights between
Mauritanian shepherds and Senegalese peasants.
   Mauritania straddles Arab north and black West Africa.
Two-thirds of its 2 million people are Moors of Arab-Berber
extraction. The rest are black, mostly from the southern river
region. Nearly all of Senegal's 7 million people are black.
   The dispute concerns the right of Senegalese to farm on a
Senegal River island. After both countries became independent from
France in 1960, the black Toucouleur people of Senegal continued to
farm the Mauritanian side they had considered their own for
generations.
   Moors to the north, traditionally nomadic herders, did not farm.
   But the recent completion of two dams on the river has opened up
new farmland, spurred Mauritanian interest in agriculture and
prompted them to force Senegalese off the land.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews March 6-15 with 1,108 adults in the
continental United States. Phone numbers were selected randomly and
interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent
birthday, a random phenomenon.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that if
every adult American were asked the same questions, the results
theoretically would be within 3 points of the poll's results, 19
times out of 20. The error margin is larger for subgroups.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this
poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:

<HEAD>Gore Bill Would Regulate Chemicals that Hurt Ozone Layer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer products that release chemicals into
the air which ``rip up the earth's protective ozone layer'' would
be regulated and those with non-essential uses would be phased out
under legislation introduced Monday by Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn.
   Gore's bill is aimed at products ranging from leaking automobile
air conditioners to noise horns to some types of fire extinguishers.
   Gore also introduced separate legislation to phase out, within
five years, the most dangerous ozone-destroying chemicals and to
impose a manufacturer's tax on them.
   An Ozone Layer Conservation Trust Fund would be established to
find alternatives to such chemicals as chloroflurocarbons and halon
which have been shown to deplete the ozone layer of the
stratosphere.
   ``We know that these chemicals are ripping up the earth's
protective ozone layer and contributing to the greenhouse effect,''
Gore said in a statement.
   ``We know that if we immediately stopped all use, the problems
they've already created would linger on for decades,'' he said.
``Hesitation simply cannot be tolerated. We must move as quickly as
possible to stop the destruction.''
   He said that ``simple, common sense solutions'' are available
now for application every day.
   ``For example, changing the way we service automobile air
conditioners, labeling and eventually stopping the production of
non-essential consumer products such as noise horns or party
streamers or certain cleaning fluids,'' Gore said.
   He said U.S. legislation can serve as a catalyst for efforts to
eliminate the threat to the ozone layer by nations around the world.
   ``My purpose is to sound an alarm loudly and clearly _ of
imminent and grave danger _ and to describe a strategy for
confronting this crisis with changes in our collective behavior and
thinking which, if made, can forestall and prevent the horrendous
prospect of an ecological collapse,'' he said.

<HEAD>Court Hands Piscopo Defeat In Divorce Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comedian Joe Piscopo suffered a legal
defeat Monday when a state appeals court upheld most of a divorce
judgment in which his ex-wife received about $500,000 in joint
assets and custody of their only child.
   The three-judge panel also ruled it was not unreasonable to
require Piscopo to pay $40,000 a year in child support, and
rejected his argument that his ex-wife should not have been allowed
to move to Florida with his son.
   The movie actor and former ``Saturday Night Live'' regular's
ex-wife, Nancy Piscopo Hayes, has remarried since the 1988 divorce
decree. Their son is 10 years old.
   The appeals court also upheld an award to Mrs. Hayes of $50,000,
which was half the value placed on Piscopo's celebrity status.
   ``We're disappointed that the Appellate Division did not reverse
the trial court, especially on the issue of Joe's son being removed
to Florida,'' said Piscopo's attorney, Francis Donahue.
   Donahue said he would discuss with Piscopo whether to take the
case to the state Supreme Court. Piscopo, a former resident of
Alpine, now lives in Sneden's Landing, N.Y.
   Mrs. Hayes' attorney, Charles Abut, said his client was ``very
pleased and hopes that with this ruling the litigation can be put
to a rest and the child, who's the most important asset of this
marriage, can be allowed to develop normally outside the court
system.''
   Abut also defended the $40,000-a-year child-support judgment.
   `The testimony was that Mr. Piscopo in the last year before the
trial was making $700,000 to $800,000, so a child support award of
$40,000 is very reasonable,'' he said.
   The appellate court relied largely on established matrimonial
law in ruling that the couple's assets should be evenly divided and
that Mrs. Hayes should receive about $500,000 in property and money.
   The court noted she had largely supported the couple while
Piscopo finished college and started his comedy career.
   During the first decade of the marriage, until he landed the
``Saturday Night Live'' role in 1980, she also assisted his career
by typing his scripts and helping him learn his lines.
   The court rejected arguments that the mother's move to Florida
was detrimental to the child.
   The court cited trial testimony that indicated there is a great
deal of animosity by Piscopo toward his ex-wife, and that he had
expressed such views in front of the child.
   The court also noted Piscopo's arguments that the child and
their relationship will suffer from being far away from his father.
   The court ruled there is no evidence the child will suffer from
the move and that Piscopo has ample personal resources to keep up a
weekly visitation schedule. It noted that in January alone, Piscopo
traveled to seven cities in four states to make appearances.
   The court also agreed with the Superior Court judge's ruling
that the Florida living arrangements add some structure to the
comedian's visits with his son.
   ``The trial judge found, and (Piscopo) admitted that he
frequently went to Joey's school unannounced and took Joey out of
school; that he frequently made the child choose which parent
should take him from school; and that he asked the child `hundreds
of times' if he wanted to go to Florida,'' the court ruled.

   Police investigated a report Monday that a
masked gunman abducted a baby girl from a couple who made the same
complaint three years ago about another daughter who was found dead
yards from their house.
   On Saturday, Robert and Paula Sims reported their 6-week-old
daughter, Heather, missing from her bassinet after a masked gunman
knocked Mrs. Sims unconscious, police said.
   The report was identical to one filed in 1986 in nearby Brighton
when the Sims' 13-day-old daughter, Loralei, turned up missing. Her
body was found five days later about 150 feet from the Sims' house.
No arrest was made although the parents were considered supsects.
   ``What are the chances of somebody breaking into your house and
taking your small infant child once in your life?'' said police
Sgt. Billy Lawrence. ``You figure out the odds, and then figure out
the odds that it could happen a second time in a completely
different city. But I'm not trying to say anything.''
   The Sims have an unlisted telephone number and could not
immediately be reached. Madison County State's Attorney Bill Haine
also did not immediately return telephone calls.
   On Monday, police in this Mississippi River city across from St.
Louis said they were still treating Heather's disappearance as a
reported kidnapping.
   ``We are doing everything we can possibly do, but we have no
idea where the child is,'' said police Sgt. Bud Pyatt.
   ``We were told (Mrs. Sims) was approached by a male outside the
home, forced back inside the house and knocked unconscious,'' said
Pyatt. ``But we have no information other than what was obtained
yesterday.''
   Sgt. Rick McCain of the Alton Police said there was ``no
physical evidence'' that Mrs. Sims had been struck.
   ``There is nothing that disproves their allegations,'' said
McCain. ``But we are not discounting the information from the other
case.''
   The reported timing of the abductions was nearly identical. In
1986, Mrs. Sims said she was knocked out about 10:20 p.m. On
Saturday, she told police the assailant struck at 10:30 p.m. as she
took out the trash.
   Police said a 15-month-old son was sleeping in the house at the
time Mrs. Sims said Heather was abducted, but the boy was not
disturbed. No valuables were reported missing.
   Mrs. Sims told police her husband arrived home Saturday night
about an hour after she was knocked out and revived her.
   Police searched around the Sims home on Sunday, and Pyatt said
investigators might broaden the search.
   Sims' brother-in-law, Herb Condray, of Cottage Hills, said
police had advised the couple to make no public statement about the
case. ``They told the parents to let the police handle it and
that's what they're doing,'' he said.
   The family lived in Brighton, about 10 miles north of Alton, in
1986 when Mrs. Sims, then 27, reported a masked gunman entered her
home, ordered her to lie down, and took Loralei from her bassinet.
   In each case, Sims was at work at the time his daughters
disappeared. Sims works at Laclede Steel Co. in Alton.
   Jersey County Sheriff Frank Yocom said Sims and his wife were
suspects in Loralei's death. But the couple declined to testify
before a grand jury investigation, citing their constitutional
right for protection against self-incrimination, and the panel took
no action, Yocom said.
   Loralei's disappearance touched off an intensive search.
Leaflets with the infant's picture were distributed and the parents
pleaded for help finding their daughter. When her body was found
five days later it was so decomposed a cause of death could not be
determined.
   Sims and his wife insisted in 1986 they had nothing to do with
Loralei's disappearance and death.
   The couple moved to the two-story frame home in Alton about two
years ago. Sims, then 34, installed a tall chainlink fence around
the front yard shortly after moving to Alton, neighbors said.

<HEAD>State Resumes Job Safety Enforcement After Nearly Two Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State inspectors resumed investigations of
accidents and safety complaints at businesses on Monday, nearly two
years after Gov. George Deukmejian virtually dismantled their
agency.
   ``All 21 district offices around the state opened for business
today,'' said Richard Stephens, said spokesman for the state
Industrial Relations Department that oversees the California
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or Cal-OSHA.
   The agency is being restored under terms of a statewide ballot
measure last November that reversed the Republican governor's
decision.
   In July 1987, Deukmejian cut most of the funding for the $7
million state-run program as a cost-saving measure. His action
turned over to the federal government the responsibility for
monitoring job safety in the private sector, where 10.5 million
Californians work.
   All that remained of Cal-OSHA was an inspection program for
California's 1.7 million state and local government workers.
   But a coalition of labor, environmental, business, medical and
education groups spearheaded Proposition 97 to restore Cal-OSHA,
saying the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration
provided workers with far fewer protections than the state agency.
Voters passed the initiative by a margin of 54 percent to 46
percent.
   Under a federal-state agreement announced last month, inspectors
for both agencies will police worker safety in California for the
next five months as the state Department of Industrial Relations
brings Cal-OSHA back to life.
   As the state program returns to full strength, the federal
presence will be phased out so the state can assume full control on
Oct. 1.
   ``They'll have some growing pains, but we anticipate (Cal-OSHA)
will be back on stream very rapidly,'' said Richard Munn of the
Associated General Contractors of California, which pushed for
restoring Cal-OSHA.
   About 140 state inspectors were on the job Monday, with the
number scheduled to climb gradually to 214, Stephens said. State
inspectors will respond to all complaints of unsafe working
conditions in the private sector.
   During the transition, the federal OSHA will continue to conduct
regularly scheduled inspections in selected industries.
   Frank Strasheim, regional chief for federal OSHA, said his staff
will retain jurisdiction over complaints received before May 1.
   Federal inspectors will retain responsibility for the safety of
people who work at federal installations or aboard ships in federal
waters.

   Worshipers at a rural church gathered to
mourn Monday at the parsonage where their minister, his wife and
two children were found shot to death.
   ``It's just a small country church and everyone's real close,''
said Roger Schafer, a member of the congregation.
   The minister's son, 17-year-old Jeff Pelley, returned to the
house briefly to retrieve his belongings, then crossed the gravel
parking lot of the church to console grieving members of the small
congregation before leaving with friends.
   The bodies of the Rev. Robert L. Pelley, 38, his 32-year-old
wife, Dawn, and daughters Janel, 8, and Jolene, 6, were found
Sunday morning after the family failed to appear for services at
the Olive Branch Church of the United Brethen in Christ.
   Police have ruled out burglary or theft, as well as
murder-suicide. They have refused to discuss any motives they may
be aware of.
   The four victims all apparently were shot at close range with
the same weapon, said St. Joseph County sheriff's Sgt. Charles
Feirrell.
   Results from autopsies were not expected before Tuesday, said
Feirrell.
   The Pelleys had married after their first spouses died,
congregation members said. Jeff Pelley and Jackie Pelley, 14, were
Pelley's children from his first marriage, and 10-year-old Jessica,
Janel and Jolene were Ms. Pelley's children.
   Jeff Pelley was at an amusement park north of Chicago for a high
school prom celebration when the slayings occurred, Feirrell said.
His sister, Jackie, was attending church camp for the weekend, and
stepsister Jessica stayed overnight with friends.
   The Rev. Don Merrilatt, a United Brethren pastor from a nearby
town, said Pelley had just written a paper on merging broken
families for a counseling course the two attended at a church
college. He said Pelley had talked about friction among the
children in the new family, but declined to elaborate.
   However, church member Beatrice Roush, 66, said she babysat
frequently for the Pelley's younger children and noticed no signs
of strain. ``They all got along fine,'' she said.
   The Pelleys had been married about five years, and had produced
no children of their own.
   At least 20 members of the congregation gathered Monday at the
church in Lakeville, which sits about halfway between Fort Wayne
and Chicago. Members of neighboring churches brought dishes of cold
cuts and salads.
   ``You have a bond here that a lot of times you don't find in a
bigger church,'' said Richard Thorpe, a former pastor at the church
who came from his home in nearby Kendallville.
   On Sunday, when Pelley failed to appear for the 9:30 a.m.
service, the nearly 70 congregants there thought he might be
playing a joke, Schafer said. Another church member began the
service, but all grew increasingly worried as Ms. Pelley and the
children failed to appear.
   Church trustee David Hathaway went to the parsonage and found
the bodies.

<HEAD>`Flash Gordon' Wolf Runs Wild, Eats Pet Rabbit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A white wolf that ran wild in an affluent
residential area and ate a pet rabbit belongs to Sam J. Jones, who
played comic book hero Flash Gordon in a 1980 movie, animal
regulation officials said Monday.
   ``We believe he purchased it as a pup from a breeder so it was
raised in a sort of domestic environment. But still, you can't have
them,'' said Lt. Marshall Vernon of the city's West Valley Animal
Shelter.
   The 100-pound wolf, a full-grown female named Hurricane, was
captured April 14 near the Encino Reservoir in the San Fernando
Valley.
   Residents of the hillside neighborhood had complained that a
huge white dog had been roaming the area for about two months and
gobbled down a rabbit.
   Vernon said the predator is probably an endangered gray wolf,
which lives in the wild in Alaska and Minnesota.
   It is illegal to keep wolves within city limits without a
permit. The misdemeanor offense is punishable by a fine of up to
$500 and six months in jail, but there were no immediate plans to
prosecute Jones, Vernon said.
   In addition to ``Flash Gordon,'' Jones appeared in ``10,'' in
1979, ``My Chauffeur,'' in 1986 and in the TV series ``Hardcastle
and McCormick'' and ``Hunter.''
   Jones' personal manager, Stan Kamens, said he had no knowledge
of the matter and would have no comment.
   Hurricane apparently lived on the run by hunting wild rabbits,
ground squirrels, opossums and quail in the uninhabited brush
around the reservoir, which abuts the Santa Monica Mountains.
   A bait trap cage was set for Hurricane, who was described as
``very shy and withdrawn'' by Thomas R. Walsh, animal regulation
district supervisor.
   ``We want to give the wolf to some type of a sanctuary that can
handle that type of animal. We just don't want to send it
anywhere,'' he said. ``She's not going back to the owner.''

<TEXT>
   At least 25 imprisoned Tamil rebels
overpowered Indian soldiers guarding a jail in northern Sri Lanka
on Monday and escaped with weapons and ammunition, residents said.
   Residents and witnesses to the breakout at Vavuniya town, 135
miles north of Colombo, said other Tamils apparently created a
diversion by firing at a nearby Indian sentry post.
   An Indian High Commission spokeswoman could not confirm the
break, the first by Tamil separatists since Indian troops began
peacekeeping operations in 1987. The spokeswoman cannot be
identified under briefing rules.
   In other violence:
   _Ambushers thought to be Sinhalese exploded a mine under a
passing police patrol jeep in Polonnawara and then fired automatic
weapons, killing four policemen and wounding two, military
officials said. The town is 100 miles northeast of Colombo. The
officials cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   _Three gunmen believed to be Tamil rebels killed Mutthiah
Panchalingam, 52, the senior administrator of Jaffna district, in a
village outside Jaffna town, 185 miles north of Colombo, military
officials said.
   Jaffna has been headquarters of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, a rebel group spearheading the separatist campaign that has
claimed 10,000 lives.
   But a Tamil Tiger leader in Colombo, speaking on condition of
anonymity, denied the group was responsible for Panchalingam's
death.
   A senior Tiger leader is holding talks with the government to
end the separatist war.
   Previous government peace overtures to Tamil rebels touched off
a violent backlash by Sinhalese militants, who complained that
offers made in the India-sponsored peace accord of July 1987
conceded too much to the Tamils and who then launched their own
agitation against the government.
   Sinhalese form 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
dominate the government and the military. Tamils make up 18
perecent and claim they are discriminated in jobs and education by
the Sinhalese.
   Indian soldiers are deployed in the island's north and east to
enforce the 1987 accord and disarm Tamils who have fought for six
years for a separate nation.

   An explosion blamed on ethnic
Albanian militants rocked an electric tower Monday in the restive
province of Kosovo, an official report said.
   The bomb went off underneath the power line at 5 a.m. near the
town of Podujevo, about 20 miles north of the provincial capital of
Pristina, the state news agency Tanjug said.
   No injuries were reported.
   The agency said the attack was mounted by ethnic Albanian
``nationalists and separatists'' who had ``continued their hostile
activities even on May Day.''
   In the same report, the news agency said grafitti was found in a
village near Podujevo which contained ``hostile slogans from the
position of Albanian nationalism and separatism.''
   Tanjug said the slogans denounced Slobodan Milosevic, the
Communist Party leader in the republic of Serbia. The southern
province of Kosovo, though technically autonomous, is an
administrative part of Serbia.
   Minority Slavs in the province have clashed with majority ethnic
Albanians for many years. The Slavs have demonstrated to support a
drive by Milosevic to increase Serbian control of the province.
   The ethnic tensions fueled riots in March that killed at least
25 people.

   Poles shouted ``Down with communism!'' at a May Day march in
Warsaw, Soviet Armenians defied a ban on demonstrations, and
rallies became riots in South Korea and Czechoslovakia as workers
Monday marked their worldwide holiday.
   Clashes in Turkey left 36 people injured, riot squads fired tear
gas when leftists tried to march on the U.S. Embassy in the
Philippines, and thousands burned U.S. flags in Honduras.
   The Soviet Union held a traditional parade through Red Square,
China used the occasion to try to ease a burgeoning student
uprising, and a man holding a poster of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev was dragged away by police in Czechoslovakia.
   Around the world, thousands gathered on the international labor
day to celebrate their gains with banners and balloons, or protest
their losses with hurled rocks and smashed windows.
   Up to 100,000 Solidarity supporters marched through Warsaw in
the union's first legal May Day gathering since it was suppressed
eight years ago. Workers chanted ``Down with communism!'' during
the impressive show of strength.
   ``We not only can organize uprisings ... we can also build a
normal democratric order,'' Warsaw Solidarity leader Zbigniew Bujak
told the crowd, referring to recent reforms that resulted in
Solidarity's legalization and opposition participation in elections.
   Warsaw's main events were peaceful, but violent clashes were
reported in the cities of Wroclaw and Gdansk when militant
Solidarity splinter groups held demonstrations in those cities,
dissident sources said. Street fighting in Gdansk lasted several
hours.
   In the Philippines, police swung truncheons and fired tear gas
to break up crowds marching to the U.S. Embassy in Manila after a
rally in which union leaders threatened a nationwide strike to
press for a higher minimum wage.
   Riot police in South Korea fired tear gas in a battle with about
5,000 striking workers in Masan and nearby Changwon after
protesters tried to stage a May Day rally, police said. About 200
workers were arrested.
   Police said about 6,600 people were arrested in Seoul when
police blocked a rally Sunday called by labor groups to mark May
Day.
   In Czechoslovakia, at least 76 people were arrested Monday for
taking part in anti-government protests that broke out during the
official May Day parade in Prague. One protester was arrested as he
carried a poster of Gorbachev, whose reforms go further than those
desired by Czechoslovakia's leaders.
   An additional 18 were arrested during rallies in the city of
Brno, said activist Anna Sabatova.
   BBC reporter Misha Glenny said he was punched in the face and
held for five hours as he photographed an arrest in Prague.
Britain's Foreign Office said it would protest to Czechoslovakia.
   In the Soviet Union, an activist in the Soviet republic of
Armenia said residents in the capital, Yerevan, defied a ban and
held a large, peaceful rally.
   May Day celebrations were banned in the Yerevan and Tbilisi,
capital of Soviet Georgia, because of recent pro-independence
unrest in both cities and the devastating earthquake in Armenia.
   The mood was festive in Moscow under sunny skies during the
traditional May Day parade through Red Square. Gorbachev and other
officials stood atop Lenin's tomb as thousands of marchers waved
colorful banners, pushed floats and floated balloons.
   In Turkey, 36 people were injured in battles with security
forces during outlawed May Day marches in Istanbul, the Anatolia
news agency reported. Eight of them were wounded by gunfire,
including one man who was shot in the head.
   Officials banned the holiday because they said it was a Marxist
tradition. The Interior Ministry said 400 people were detained in
Istanbul during unauthorized marches and another 500 in the Aegean
coastal city of Izmir.
   In West Berlin, police used water cannon, tear gas and
truncheons against at least 2,000 militant protesters who hurled
fire bombs, looted stores and smashed windows in violent May Day
skirmishes that continued into late Monday. Police said small,
roving groups of masked protesters firebombed parked cars in the
Kreuzberg district, with several cars catching fire and exploding.
They said a policeman was knocked down and beaten and his service
pistol was stolen.
   In communist East Berlin, at least five dissidents were arrested
for staging demonstrations alongside official celebrations,
dissident sources said.
   In China, where authorities are struggling with a student
movement for democratic reforms, the Communist Party marked May Day
by appealing to workers to resist forces of social instability.
   In Japan, police said 1.1 million people took part in May Day
rallies. Some evolved into peaceful protests against the
stock-profiteering scandal that has shaken the government and
prompted the resignation of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.
   In Honduras, more than 50,000 people demonstrated in six cities
and burned U.S. flags to protest the U.S. military presence in the
country and Washington's support for the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Pro-government and opposition labor leaders at separate rallies
in Managua demanded that U.S. trade embargoes on Nicaragua be
lifted. Alvin Guthrie, president of the opposition Confederation
for Labor Unification, said those who suffer ``are not the
Sandinista leaders, but the workers and the people.''
   In Chile, military ruler Augusto Pinochet raised the monthly
mimimum wage to $72, up $10 from the previous minimum but below the
$112 sought by labor unions.
   In Mexico City, troops kept opposition groups from joining a
government-organized rally in the Zocalo, the city's main plaza.
After about 150,000 pro-government unionists ended their parade, at
least 30,000 dissident unionists and other demonstrators were
allowed into the Zocalo to listen to speeches from their leaders.
   Blue wire fences, soldiers armed with automatic rifles and
police on horseback and with dogs held back the dissidents through
the morning.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
threatened Monday to withhold U.S. financial contributions to the
World Health Organization if it votes to admit the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   ``He feels very strongly about this,'' said Margaret Tutwiler,
the State Department spokeswoman, in announcing Baker's position.
   She said if threat of a cutoff did not deter the 166-member WHO
from admitting the PLO at a meeting next week in Geneva the United
States would consider other, unspecified steps.
   The head of the U.N. agency was expected at the State Department
on Tuesday to plead for continued U.S. financial support. Dr.
Hiroshi Nakajima, a Japanese physician, said in Geneva on Saturday
he had tried to persuade PLO chairman Yasser Arafat to withdraw the
application.
   Gordon Brown, the U.S. deputy ambassador to Tunisia, informed
Hakim Ballaoui of the PLO of the decision at a meeting Monday in
Carthage that focused on WHO membership. Asked if the dispute would
curtail the dialogue the United States began with the PLO in
December, the U.S. official said ``there is no hint of that.''
   The talks were based on a U.S. judgment that Arafat had
renounced terrorism and had accepted Israel's right to exist. The
statement read by Ms. Tutwiler in behalf of Baker made no reference
to terrorism.
   ``The United States vigorously opposes the admission of the PLO
to membership in the World Health Organization or any other U.N.
agency,'' it said. ``We have worked and will continue to work to
convince others of the harm that the PLO's admission would cause to
the Middle East peace process and to the U.N. system.''
   It added: ``Political questions such as this should not be
raised in specialized agencies because such politicization detracts
from the important technical work of these organizations.
   ``To emphasize the depth of our concern, I will recommend to the
president that the United States make no further contributions,
voluntary or assessed, to any international organization which
makes any change in the PLO's present status as an observer
organization.''
   The United States bears about 25 percent of the burden of World
Health Organization expenses. This amounted to about $150 million
in the last two years.
   More than 50 senators have signed a letter to Baker saying they
favored cutting off funds to the WHO or any other U.N. agency that
admitted Arafat's organization, which is recognized by all 21 Arab
governments as the sole, legitimate representative of the
Palestinian people.
   Last year, the PLO declared statehood on land held by Israel.
President Bush last month said he was opposed to an independent
Palestinian state.
   ``We do not recognize them as a state, nor do we believe they
meet the criteria of being a state,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   The U.S. official acknowledged ``it is a very tough decision''
to threaten a cutoff of financial support to the world health group.
   Seymour D. Reich, chairman of the Conference of Presidents of
Major American Jewish Organizations, said he was gratified by
Baker's statement ``which underscores the seriousness with which
our country views this issue.''
   Reich said the PLO was trying to gain ``back-door admission'' to
the United Nations itself. ``Should the PLO succeed,'' he said, ``a
dangerous precedent will be set.''
   But Clovis Maksoud, director of the League of Arab States, said
if the U.S. does carry through with its threat, it would be
``making, perhaps unwittingly, the peace process hostage to the
most intransigent of Israeli policies. Admitting Palestine to WHO
contributes, in our opinion, to its universality, and therefore
effectiveness.''

<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon officials Monday released a revised
plan for cleansing 364 miles of Alaskan coastline fouled by the
nation's largest oil spill, but said their proposal requires a
suspension of local environmental laws.
   The plan makes no provisions for continuing the cleanup beyond
mid-September, and notes that 191 miles of lightly oiled coastline
may not be cleaned mechanically at all, but be allowed to be washed
naturally by the environment.
   ``It is expected that this will be the case for all lightly
oiled Gulf of Alaska sites,'' said the two-part, 60-page report.
   ``We are going to have to take a hard look at that,'' responded
Bill Lamoreaux, the ranking state environmental official monitoring
the cleanup.
   Since March 24, when an Exxon tanker struck a reef outside
Valdez and poured more than 10 million gallons of North Slope crude
into Prince William Sound, Exxon has financed cleanup crews
fighting the spreading sludge. Signs of the spill have been sighted
about 500 miles southwest of Valdez.
   The oil company's strategy, which was submitted to state and
federal authorities only hours before a deadline expired, divides
Alaska's oil-tainted shores into four categories _ from the most
heavily polluted to those that are ``only lightly oiled.''
   It covers polluted areas within Prince William Sound, as well as
those outside the immediate spill zone, and calls for nearly 3,400
workers to participate in the cleanup.
   The worst areas _ three miles of sludge-covered beaches on
several small islands _ would be targeted immediately, with the
others scheduled for gradual cleansing through Sept. 15.
   Exxon's plan calls for the recovered waste to be strained for
usable oil that can be refined, and said the oil-laced wastewater
could be treated at the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.'s disposal
plant in Valdez.
   The gunk and sludge that resists treatment or salvage will be
burned or buried, according to the Exxon study. Both methods likely
will require exemptions from local environmental laws.
   Coast Guard Adm. Paul A. Yost Jr., the ranking federal official
tracking the cleanup, told reporters in Sacramento, Calif. that he
would decide whether to approve the proposal within a week.
   Before the plan was released, Yost said he wanted much more
detail than Exxon's original cleanup plan, which included nothing
on polluted areas outside the sound.
   Yost is scheduled to arrive in Valdez on Tuesday to review the
latest plan.
   Meanwhile, tar and sludge from the Valdez spill fouled the
beaches of Alaska's wild Katmai National Park, drenching hundreds
of sea otters and birds and threatening the huge brown bears
prowling the refuge.
   The damage stretches along 260 miles of rocky, rugged coastline
southwestward from Cape Douglas some 500 miles from Valdez, park
superintendent Ray Bane said Monday.
   ``The oil has made landfall in large quantities in Katmai Bay
and Hallo Bay. There is a heavy impact. We have seen several
hundred sea otters swimming in oil. The oil has had an impact on
virtually the entire coastline of the park,'' Bane said.
   The 4 million-acre park also is a haven for brown bears, a
coastal cousin of the grizzly. ``A number of bears have been seen
walking in the vicinity of the beaches. We have one verified
sighting of a bear walking through the oil,'' Bane said.
   Bane said an aerial survey showed an amorphous oil patch 10
miles wide and more than 20 miles long in the Shelikof Strait,
which is located along the migration route used by whales.
   Exxon is feeling the effects of the spill far beyond Alaska
waters. Several groups throughout the country have called for a
boycott Tuesday of Exxon products.
   In Anchorage, a group called the Boycott Exxon Alliance has
scheduled a rally in front of Exxon's Alaska headquarters.
   The attorneys general of Idaho, Oregon and Washington state
scheduled a news conference Tuesday to call for a federal
investigation into the sharp rise in the price of gasoline since
the spill.
   The oil industry blames the spill and crude oil prices that have
risen $7 a barrel since January for higher prices at the gas pumps.
   Exxon also received sharp criticism from the federal government,
which accused the company of ``foot-dragging'' in the construction
of a second facility in Seward to aid in the cleanup of sea otters
fouled by the oil. The animals depend on their thick fur for
insulation against the cold water but the oil ruins the insulation
effect.
   Exxon says the center will open Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Former French Premier Jacques Chirac
took a sentimental journey through this college town Monday on the
first day of a nine-day cross-country trip.
   Chirac, who recently began his third term as mayor of Paris,
planned the trip as a way of ``staying in touch with the major
players in the United States,'' spokesman Pierre Lellouche said.
   Chirac plans to meet with President Bush. He is scheduled to
meet this week in New York with former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger and U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar before
traveling to Los Angeles, where he plans to visit former President
Reagan and dine with such actors as Gregory Peck and Jane Fonda.
   ``I prefer the East Coast and my daughter likes the West Coast,
so we're doing both,'' said Chirac. His daughter Claude, 25, was
among a dozen French advisers and journalists along for the trip.
   Chirac attended a luncheon at the John F. Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard University before wandering awhile along the
Cambridge streets he first haunted in 1952 as a summer student at
Harvard's business school.
   Chirac, 56, smiled as familiar sights jogged his memory. He
recalled the giddiness of his first visit to the United States and
the American woman he fell in love with while working as a soda
jerk at the old Howard Johnson's in Harvard Square.
   ``It was a wonderful time,'' he said. ``It pleases me to relive
it.''
   More recently, times have been tougher for Chirac, head of
France's neo-Gaullist party, who lost his bid last year to unseat
socialist President Francois Mitterand.
   Not only did the conservative candidate lose the May 1988 race,
his party also lost its majority coalition in the National
Assembly, forcing him to resign as prime minister.
   Chirac had held the posts of prime minister and Paris mayor
simultaneously. It is not uncommon for French officials to hold two
important elected jobs.
   Lellouche said Chirac has emerged from a post-election letdown,
during which he was relatively withdrawn.
   ``This is a man who was defeated,'' the spokesman said. ``It's a
time of opposition, and a time of learning.''
   Later Monday, Chirac spoke in French to an audience of about 150
students, faculty and members of the local French community at
Harvard's Center for European Studies.

   Vice President Dan Quayle repeated his
support for Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk on
Monday, but the vice president and his aides said a meeting between
the two had brought no changes in U.S. policy toward that country.
   Quayle, spending a day here after touring Australia, met for 45
minutes with Sihanouk. The vice president also talked about trade
issues and human rights with Indonesian President Suharto.
   But much of the day's focus was on the meeting with Sihanouk,
who is visiting Indonesia along with the leaders of two other
factions hopeful of running Cambodia after the promised fall
withdrawal of Vietnamese occupation troops.
   The fourth group vying for control in Cambodia is the Khmer
Rouge, a Chinese-backed organization that was responsible for
killing as many as 1.5-million Cambodians from 1975 to 1979. Quayle
and other U.S. officials have said they will not tolerate a
Cambodian government dominated by the Khmer Rouge.
   Meantime, Cambodia's Vietnamese-installed government has changed
the country's name and flag, and invited Sihanouk to return home
and help rule.
   Sihanouk welcomed the concessions and appeared ready to make a
few of his own to end the 10-year conflict. ``It seems that we are
at the end of the tunnel. We are going to make progress on the way
toward a settlement,'' Sihanouk said.
   Quayle has said that the United States is considering giving
military aid to Sihanouk and possibly the other non-communist
Cambodian faction, headed by Son Sann.
   But Quayle said such aid did not come up in his discussions with
Sihanouk.
   Asked if U.S. military aid might be overt or covert, Quayle
responded there was a mixed view on the subject _ ``mixed being
some overt, some covert.''
   What he and Sihanouk did discuss, Quayle said, was ``the process
and moving the process forward and timetables and ... who the
players are and what some of the expectations would be.''
   Sihanouk supports an international conference on Cambodia that
could lead to an enforcement mechanism to monitor the withdrawal of
the Vietnamese and to cope with a transition government until
elections are held.
   The United States backs making Sihanouk the interim leader until
free elections can be held.
   Later, at a news conference before leaving Indonesia, Quayle
said, the United States remains totally opposed to giving the Khmer
Roupe any controlling role in Cambodia.
   ``It's a non-starter from the very beginning,'' he said. ``We
don't believe that Khmer rouge offer anything...but mass murder,''
   An aide to Quayle, speaking on condition he remain anonymous,
said that Quayle will relay his information to Bush and that it
might be several months before the United States decides whether to
alter its policy toward Cambodia.
   With Suharto, Quayle took up human rights issues, particularly
allegations that Indonesia has more than 400 political prisoners
and has used repressive tactics in East Timor, a former Portuguese
colony annexed by Indonesia in 1975. Some 30 members of Congress
had urged Quayle to take up the human rights issue.
   In addition, Quayle met with three human rights activists,
including Shamet Bratanata.
   With Suharto, Quayle advocated that Indonesia practice
``political development'' as well as economic development.
   Other issues that were brought up with officials of Indonesia,
considered a strong U.S. ally, were trade and space.
   On Tuesday Quayle heads for Singapore and then on to Thailand,
the last two overseas stops on his 12-day trip.

   Pro-government and opposition labor
leaders at separate May Day rallies demanded Monday that the United
States lift its trade embargo on Nicaragua.
   ``We're asking that the United States lift the embargo because
those who suffer are not the Sandinista leaders, but the workers
and the people of Nicaragua,'' said Alvin Guthrie, president of the
opposition Confederation for Labor Unification.
   He spoke to about 4,000 demonstrators opposing the leftist
Sandinista government who later marched for two hours through
working-class neighborhoods of Managua under a sweltering midday
sun.
   Earlier Monday, about 20,000 pro-government demonstrators
gathered at the Plaza de la Revolucion in Managua's former downtown
area, destroyed by a 1972 earthquake.
   Lucio Jimenez, secretary-general of the Sandinista Workers
Union, condemned the 4-year-old U.S. economic blockade and accused
``reactionary Nicaraguan capitalists'' of impeding the country's
industries.
   He praised the government's call to investors to help reactivate
Nicaragua's paralyzed economy, warning them this was their chance
``for continuing to live or disappear.''
   Victor Tirado, one of the nine members of the Sandinista
National Directorate, told the rally peace won't come to Nicaragua
until the United States stops supporting the Nicaraguan rebels,
known as Contras. Last month Congress approved a $49.7 million
package of non-lethal aid for the Contras, most of whom are living
in jungle camps in neighboring Honduras.
   The United States cut off all financial aid to Nicaragua in 1981
after alleging the Sandinista government was supporting leftist
insurgents in El Salvador. In 1985, then-President Reagan imposed a
commercial embargo on this Central American country, saying
Nicaragua had established close military ties with Cuba and the
Soviet Union.
   Private buiness people say the embargo isn't halting the flow of
U.S.-made goods to Nicaragua and only makes parts and equipment
more expensive to acquire because they have to route the items
through a third country.
   Economists say the government's 3-month-old austerity program is
showing results in slowing hyperinflation that topped 20,000
percent in 1988. But they say those same measures have created a
recession that could prove fatal to the economy if allowed to
continue into the planting season. The season traditionally starts
in mid-May, the beginning of the rainy season.
   President Daniel Ortega is on a 10-country European tour to ask
for more financial aid for Nicaragua. Sweden, the main West
European supporter of the 10-year-old Sandinista revolution, has
organized a Stockholm conference May 11-12 so Ortega can present
his case before potential donors.

   After discussing West Germany's
demand for early talks on cuts in short-range nuclear weapons,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of
Britain remained firmly divided on what has become a major NATO
dispute.
   Both leaders reported making little progress during an afternoon
of talks Sunday on an issue that has split the alliance, describing
their talks as frank and intensive.
   Kohl assured Mrs. Thatcher of his country's firm allegiance to
NATO, whose leaders meet in Brussels at the end of the month for a
summit.
   The West German leader's call last week for prompt superpower
negotiations on short-range nuclear weapons has placed him in a
battle of wills with Mrs. Thatcher and President Bush.

   Many Americans regard communism in Latin America
as a growing threat to U.S. security, but most view communism
elsewhere with far less suspicion, a Media General-Associated Press
poll has found.
   Communists today marked May Day, the international workers'
holiday, with parades and other shows of solidarity. But
respondents to the national poll said by nearly a 3-1 margin that
capitalism holds more sway in the world than communism.
   Overwhelming majorities viewed communist nations as loosening
social restrictions and eschewing Soviet direction. And many saw
communist countries as retreating from their government-controlled
economic systems.
   Even with the perceptions that communism is changing, however,
the poll did not find a sense that communism is fading. Just two in
10 said it is on the decline around the world.

   Voters' rejection of Gov. Buddy Roemer's
tax plan will mean the likely closures of hospitals and
universities and the layoffs of thousands of state employees, his
chief of staff says.
   Voters on Saturday rejected the plan by 55-45 percent, according
to unofficial returns.
   With rejection, the state faces a $700 million deficit in the
fiscal year beginning July 1. Roemer, who traveled around the state
for six weeks trying to to sell the plan, faces questions about his
political future just 13 months after he took office as a reformer
promising a ``new Louisiana.''
   Roemer's plan would have shifted the tax burden away from big
business, putting more of a load on individuals through the income
tax. It would have reduced sales taxes and given businesses
incentives to move to Louisiana and expand.

   Polls indicate that presidential candidate Gen. Andres Rodriguez
of the ruling Colorado Party will receive at least 70 percent of
the vote. He has run the country since deposing Gen. Alfredo
Stroessner in a coup on Feb. 3.
   ``We are conscious that we are participating in elections that
are marked by flaws, but we're doing it because we want a peaceful
transition, not a violent one,'' the leading opposition candidate,
Domingo Laino, said Sunday.
   His party is the biggest and best organized after the Colorados
and is projected to come in second in the voting.

Hit with `Nothing Sacred' ^By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>

   George F. Walker doesn't hesitate to confess his
amusement and elation at his success in his chosen field of drama.
   ``I just laughed out loud on the subway,'' he said, recalling a
recent ride in his hometown of Toronto. ``I'm a playwright _ and I
have children to support.''
   He laughed again.
   The bearded, 41-year-old Walker never has had as successful a
year as the past one, with ``Nothing Sacred'' a staple on the
repertory theater circuit from Los Angeles' Mark Taper Forum to the
Hartford Stage Company in Connecticut. Time magazine named it one
of the 10 best plays of 1988, although it has yet to be performed
in New York.
   The play is his 18th, yet Walker recalled that when his first
play was produced it was only the second play he had ever seen.
   ``I was just attracted to the idea that you could fill it up any
way you want,'' he said to explain his attraction to the theater.
   The jovial, soft-spoken Walker was in Ottawa for the opening of
``Nothing Sacred,'' in a production very similar to its Toronto
origin, at Canada's modern National Arts Center.
   Walker keeps the 19th century Russian setting for his version of
Ivan Turgenev's ``Fathers and Sons,'' but insists that it now is
very much a modern, Canadian work.
   He first read the original when he was 17 and said he thinks he
was in a bit of a trance when he wrote his version.
   ``I never meant it to be an adaptation,'' he said over lunch
before opening night in Ottawa. ``I wrote it in 10 to 11 days.''
   Walker wanted to bill the play as ``inspired by Turgenev,'' but
then decided that would be ``hokey.''
   ``Mostly I thought, `if I just let it come through me, so the
language would be, without being forced, for actors living now.'''
   Literature was the starting point for ``Nothing Sacred'' just as
other inspirations have come from something read in the newspaper
or a conversation with a friend.
   ``I'm sure if Ivan were alive, he'd be on my side,'' Walker said
about criticism of his adaptation.
   Much of his earlier work was of a more eccentric tone, in line
with his development in the Toronto alternative theater scene of
the '70s. The appeal of the theater, he said, is its access, that
the multimillion dollar budgets required for movies generally are
not needed to create plays.
   Thinking back 12 or 15 years to his early career, Walker again
laughed at the contrast to the days when the crowds were smaller
and the theaters less established.
   ``When you're used to seeing 200 or 300 people come in, and then
you see 800 or 900,'' he joked. ``Where are we going to put them
all?''
   Walker's Toronto agent, Ralph Zimmerman, astutely pitched
``Nothing Sacred'' last year to American repertory theaters, and
there's been some sniping that the success has as much to do with
the politics of regional theater as it does with the play.
   Time, reviewing the Los Angeles production, said he
``persuasively makes the debate among student anarchists in 1860s
Russia echo that among Marxist collegians of 1960s America.''
   The New York Times gave a decidedly mixed review to the
production of ``Nothing Sacred'' at Hartford Stage, saying Walker
assumed too much artistic license for a project that could have
used a bit more reverence.
   On the other hand, Walker believes it's time for the dominant
role of New York reviews to be re-evaluated in light of the
changing theater scene that is less concentrated on Broadway.
   The playwright also said many Canadians gripe about the lack of
knowledge in the United States about their country, but he chalked
that off to a result of Americans' self-preoccupation.
   ``They don't know Canada is up here feeling insecure about its
culture,'' he said. ``They (Americans) are generous: `Come in. Be
one of us.' I've never felt, `you intruder.' It's kind of positive
in its own way.''
   Some comment has been made that Walker is an example of a
classic Canadian case, of gaining legitimacy at home only after
being discovered in the United States. But he believes his steady
career in Toronto was quite established before productions started
of his plays in U.S. theaters.
   ``I think the message Canadians always had was that we didn't
need to develop our own,'' he said, recalling the days when
Canadian theater was dominated by imports from Broadway or London.
``Somewhere along the line you go, `Hey, wait. I can do that too.'
''
   And, for those Canadians who didn't hear about him until
``Nothing Sacred'' appeared on Time's Top 10 list, Walker said
simply: ``That's OK. I read Time.''

<HEAD>Single Women Stalk Mr. Right in West German Comedy Hit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN FISCHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The story of four single women
who look for the perfect prince but have to kiss a lot of frogs
along the way is the latest hit comedy movie in West Germany.
   The movie also blasts others in West Germany's young social
scene, from yuppies who marry only for tax breaks to far-out
leftist activists.
   The movie ``Beim naechsten Mann wird alles anders'' (``With the
Next Man Everything Will Be Different'') is based on a best-selling
book of the same title by writer Eva Heller, who has also published
collections of satirical cartoons.
   The film, released in January, was rated No. 5 on the hit movie
list published by the Hamburg-based weekly magazine Stern in its
March 2 issue. That made ``Beim naechsten Mann'' the second-highest
ranked West German movie on the list after ``Herbstmilch,'' the
poignant tale of a young Bavarian farm woman during the Nazi era.
   Movies focusing on women are still unusual in West Germany,
despite the success in recent years of woman directors such as
Doris Doerrie, whose 1985 film ``Maenner'' (``Men'') was an
international hit.
   The heroine of the movie is Constanze Wechselburger, a film
student who sees herself as intellectual, political and prominent
in the feminist movement, even though she spends most of her time
hunting for men.
   The film opens with a chaotic battle between Constanze and her
boyfriend, Albert, a young doctor whom she eventually dumps for
allegedly being both bourgeois and cheap. Albert criticizes
Constanze for her wastefulness, cutting open a discarded toothpaste
tube with a scalpel to show there was enough toothpaste left for
several more brushings.
   Constanze is quick to retaliate. ``This is what I think of your
cheap Christmas present,'' she yells, flushing her own gift to
Albert, an expensive watch, down the toilet.
   Constanze confides her troubles to her girlfriends over numerous
glasses of wine, most frequently in a local bar called the Cafe
Kaputt.
   ``I'm looking for a relationship that is built on an
intellectual basis, not a material one,'' she says. She also
insists on ``emotional freedom,'' rejecting marriage as a bourgeois
institution.
   Ironically, she lands in the arms of a married man. Film
instructor Gottfried Schachtschnabel, a veteran of the 1960s
student revolts, sports a three-day beard and pretentious leftist
political attitudes.
   He, too, rejects the notion of marriage, but doesn't bother
getting divorced. He ``forgets'' to inform his girlfriends about
his status, and defends himself when he's caught.
   ``Marx was married, too. And he had an affair with his
housekeeper. We can only learn from that,'' he tells Constanze.
   There's also Sieglinde, a social-climbing dental assistant whose
yuppie boyfriend marries her for tax savings; the old-fashioned
Birgit, who looks for her dream man in the want ads; and Julia, a
psychologist who also falls prey to Schachtschnabel.
   It's a film with which West Germans can apparently both laugh
and identify. ``The characters may be cliches, but everybody
recognizes a few things that are true in real life, aspects he can
relate to,'' Angela Marquis of the film's Berlin-based production
company said in a recent interview.
   Although the film focuses on women and the title indicates
disappointment with men, it is not just a work for feminists, she
said.
   ``The story is really about curiosity, not disappointment,''
Marquis said. ``Both men and women are often bored with what they
have and think another relationship would be better. But, as the
film shows, that isn't always the case.''
   By the end of the film Constanze succumbs to bourgeois society
and gets married after all. She chooses Albert, deciding that
thriftiness is not the worst vice in the world.

<HEAD>Group to Help Gamblers Formed in Spain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD LORANT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manuel Melgarejo is trying to cool the
fever in a country where gambling is a major sport, musical slot
machines abound and nearly everyone takes a flyer on El Gordo, the
fat Christmas lottery.
   His shoestring version of Gamblers Anonymous is called the
Madrid Association of Recovering Gamblers. The telephone has been
ringing constantly since he mentioned the number on a radio program
and told listeners with gambling problems to call.
   In the four months since, he says, the membership has grown from
nearly zero to more than 200. An estimated 50,000 addicted gamblers
live in and around the capital.
   ``It's hang up, answer, hang up, answer,'' said Melgarejo, a
reformed gambler who blamed the addiction for ruining his first
marriage.
   He interrupted the interview at a temporary office in a Madrid
Roman Catholic church to talk with a middle-aged woman who walked
in off the street to confess an addiction to slot machines.
   Spain has 420,000 ``habitual gamblers,'' 3 percent of the adult
population, according to the National Gambling Commission. They are
caught in a tradition that goes back at least to 1763, when King
Carlos III started the world's longest-running public lottery.
   ``The difference between `habitual gamblers' and `addicts' is
basically a semantic one,'' said Santiago Mendioroz, head of
gambling commission.
   Spaniards placed $29 billion in bets last year, according to the
commission. It regulates state-run lotteries and sports pools, and
casinos, bingo halls and slot machines, which were legalized in
1977 after a 53-year ban.
   Mendioroz said the government's take from lotteries, pools and
fees last year was more than $2.2 billion.
   Press reports say Spain ranks second in the world in gambling
expenditures per capita, behind the United States and ahead of the
Philippines. Mendioroz says there are ``no reliable figures, but
because of the slot machines in bars and restaurants gambling is
omnipresent.''
   Slots, which blare bits of music as reminders of their presence,
are found in 80 percent of the more than 200,000 bars and cafes,
commission figures indicate. Mendioroz said Spain has 310,000 of
the machines.
   One sure sign of a gambling problem, he said, is that 8,000
people have asked his commission not to let them into casinos and
bingo halls.
   He described the number as surprisingly high considering the
custom in this Roman Catholic country of hiding such failings.
   ``Gambling is considered a vice, almost a sin, and the person
who has that problem is very reluctant to admit it,'' he said.
   Melgarejo, a 44-year-old insurance agent, devotes much of his
time to unpaid missionary work with gamblers. He says 18 years of
gambling cost him his first wife, ``10 or 12 jobs'' and about
$217,000.
   Last year he spent three months at the Cordoba Association of
Recovering Gamblers and managed to conquer the habit. His
organization and the original self-help group in Cordoba are the
only two in Spain, but Melgarejo said a national federation may
result if enough others are formed.
   He believes the Spanish character encourages gambling.
   ``It's like Don Quixote,'' he said. ``The Spaniard ... is a
romantic. He believes in fantasy, in destiny. He thinks he can
solve a lifetime's worth of problems with one stroke of luck.''

<HEAD>Story of Spanish-language Radio Pioneer Told in New Film</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With about 200 stations now programming in
Spanish to the tune of $176 million in advertising revenue last
year, U.S. Hispanic radio is booming.
   But the sound wasn't always sweet, as seen in the new film,
``Break of Dawn.''
   The movie, released in selected Southwestern cities, re-creates
the story of Spanish radio pioneer Pedro J. Gonzalez, who was
imprisoned after his on-air protests of Depression-era deportations
of Mexicans.
   ``It's a story about justice prevailing over injustice,'' said
producer Jude Pauline Eberhard. Set in Los Angeles in the 1920s and
'30s, the film tells how Gonzalez was paroled after being sent to
San Quentin on trumped up rape charges following his advocacy
broadcasts.
   Gonzalez parlayed his musical talents and eye for business into
a popular Spanish-language radio program. But it ended when he was
sent to prison on charges that were later recanted by the woman who
had allegedly been raped.
   Mexican recording star Oscar Chavez plays Gonzalez, portraying
him as he first translates radio commercials into Spanish, then
sings with his guitar and, finally, pays a station for early
morning airtime. Gonzalez and his wife sold advertising on the
show, making a profit on the difference.
   Called ``Los Madrugadores'' (``The Early Risers''), the Los
Angeles-based program developed a strong following among Hispanics
with a mix of live music, discussion of issues and commercials.
   Now 94, Gonzalez lives with his wife, Maria, in Northern
California and was a consultant for the film, said Isaac
Artenstein, who wrote and directed the movie.
   To insure realism, Artenstein used both Spanish and English
dialogue. ``You can't have Pedro talking and singing in English if
you say he was the first (radio broadcaster) in Spanish,'' said
Artenstein.
   But the bilingual approach can pose distribution problems.
Eberhard said exhibitors are shying away from the film because they
don't know whether to market it as an English or Spanish movie.
``It's scary for the distributors because of the natural language
flow,'' she said.
   Though he changed some characters' names, Artenstein said that
all of the film's main roles are based on real people, including an
activist Mexican consul, a district attorney who helps frame
Gonzalez, and a teen-age girl who falsely accuses Gonzalez of
raping her.
   Courtroom testimony in the film is taken from Gonzalez' trial
transcripts unearthed by a law library archivist. Artenstein said
Los Angeles' Spanish-language daily, La Opinion, also had extensive
coverage of Gonzalez' case, but the English-language media did not
have one story.
   ``Break of Dawn,'' which was shot for $850,000, also stars Maria
Rojo as Gonzalez' wife. Others in the film include Tony Plana, Pepe
Serna, Peter Henry Schroeder, Kamala Lopez, Valarie Wildman and
Socorro Valdez. The film was independently produced by San
Diego-based Cinewest Productions.
   Los Angeles is now the nation's largest Hispanic media market,
with $32.7 million spent on Spanish-language radio advertising in
1988, according to Hispanic Business magazine. Seven radio stations
and two television stations now air Spanish broadcasts full time in
the city.
   It is a far cry from the days when Gonzalez and his wife had to
pay stations in advance for pre-dawn airtime.

<HEAD>The Book On Wright</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The book they're throwing at Jim Wright is
more than twice as long as the one that got the speaker of the
House into trouble in the first place.
   It's a government-tan paperback with the uninviting title
``Report of the Special Outside Counsel in the Matter of James C.
Wright, Jr.'' and it runs 279 pages.
   Wright's lucrative ``Reflections of a Public Man'' was 117
pages, a lightweight by comparison but a moneymaker. It made Wright
$54,642.25 in what the House Ethics Committee charges were actually
disguised honorarium payments that violated House limits.
   Wright says he never considered the book purchases to be speech
payments. But the report recounts 11 cases in which the speaker, up
against House limits on honoraria, made appearances before groups
ranging from the fertilizer industry to cranberry growers who then
bought books instead of paying speech fees.
   His so-called royalty was 55 percent, $3.25 a copy on a book
that was priced at $5.95. According to the report, some of the
interests that paid for books didn't bother to take any.
   The speaker would have been better off if he'd quit the book
business after one of his earlier works was published, even though
it didn't do nearly as well financially. The title of that one:
``Congress and Conscience.''
   Richard J. Phelan of Chicago, outside counsel to the ethics
committee, put together the Wright report, accusing the speaker of
116 violations of House rules. The committee voted to charge Wright
with 69 of them, shelving the other 47. The Phelan report covers
them all.
   The accusations the committee voted to pursue center on the book
deal and on gifts and benefits Wright received from his friend and
business associate, George Mallick, a Fort Worth businessman.
   But some of the most striking sections of the Phelan report
cover alleged violations the committee is not pressing, involving
Wright's interventions with federal savings and loan regulators in
behalf of Texas interests, among friends and political fundraisers.
   That happened early in the savings and loan crisis that now
carries a price tag estimate at $126 billion over the next decade.
Wright's early involvement, in 1986, delayed action that might have
started the government dealing with the process.
   Republicans contend the cost of solving the S&amp;L crisis would
have been cut by half if the government had started closing down
insolvent institutions and paying off insured depositors two years
earlier. But the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. didn't
have the money to do it.
   Wright, then majority leader, delayed House action on a bill to
provide it while he pressed with S&amp;L regulators about their
dealings with a Texas S&amp;L operator. Edwin Gray, chairman of the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, was said to figure that the only way
to get the action on bill his agenda needed was to do what Wright
wanted. So he changed supervisors at an S&amp;L that was under board
control.
   The Phelan report likened that to blackmail.
   The S&amp;L bill was stalled for a week. It passed the House, but
didn't make it through the Senate before Congress adjourned.
Legislation to replenish the insurance fund didn't become law until
August, 1987.
   Wright also intervened in behalf of Thomas M. Gaubert, ousted by
federal regulators as chairman of an insolvent S&amp;L, and barred from
getting back into the business under an agreement he had made with
the bank board. Gaubert, who was treasurer of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, said he had been unfairly
pressured into accepting the agreement, and wanted it rescinded.
   Wright called Gray. Eventually, the bank board chairman named a
special counsel to review handling of the Gaubert case, even though
he told the ethics committee he had no reason to doubt the original
handling. The bank board still didn't have it's recapitalization
bill. ``... We had to have passage of the legislation and I had ...
Jim Wright making it clear that I was to talk to his friend, his
buddy,'' Gray said.
   Soon after that, in November, 1986, Gray got another call from
Wright, this one to complain more generally about the way S&amp;Ls were
being treated in Texas. In that call, Gray testified, Wright said
that a top Texas regulator for the bank board was a homosexual who
``had established a ring of homosexual lawyers in Texas at various
law firms'' and was forcing people to deal with the Federal Home
Loan Bank of Dallas through those lawyers.
   Gray said Wright asked him to get rid of the man.
   ``And I said, `No. I was the one who recruited him. I think very
highly of him. He is doing what I want him to do.' ''
   While Phelan recommended that Wright be charged with rules
violations in the S&amp;L cases, a divided committee didn't do so.
   That probably reflects legislators' sensitivity about their own,
presumably more restrained interventions with executive agencies in
behalf of constituents. It is part of the job. And as Phelan noted,
there is no House rule expressly defining undue influence.

<HEAD>A Stock List From Main Street</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock lists are forever offered from Wall
Street, one of the reasons being that Wall Street and its
institutions and brokers have an increasingly shorter time horizon
and an ever-changing focus.
   Here's a list that's different. It's from Main Street, prepared
by serious amateurs who believe in fundamental analysis rather than
hunches, and long-term investing rather than short-term trading.
   The National Association of Investors Corp. has just released
its Top 100 stocks, which it says is made up of the most widely
held companies among individual investors and investment clubs
around the country.
   Heading the list are Wal-Mart Stores, American Family, PepsiCo,
McDonald's and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, four of which were
also in the top five a year ago. The newcomer, McDonald's, jumped
from 16th place.
   Advancing the furthest, suggesting individual and club investors
believe the shares have good long-term futures, were Rollins
Environmental, from 80 to 34; Upjohn, from 92 to 51; and Eastman
Kodak, at 31 a newcomer to the list.
   Ken Janke, NAIC president, observes that while the market's
horizon seems to be getting shorter and its turnover greater, and
that many stocks seem to be chosen because of publicity, the NAIC's
membership sticks to long-term goals.
   Fundamental to its investment concept is that company
performance should be studied thoroughly before any commitment is
made, and that the investment should be made primarily in companies
growing more rapidly than the economy.
   In operating a portfolio, it believes that regular investments,
even if in small amounts, are necessary in order to offset the
unpredictable ups and downs of the market, and that dividends
should be reinvested.
   The effectiveness of that approach has been demonstrated in
learned theses and simple comparisons, but most effectively in the
lives of club members who have paid tuitions, bought homes, taken
trips and retired on their investments.
   Janke said a review of 1,600 responses _ NAIC has 135,000
members _ identified at least two significant trends about
individual investing habits.
   First, he said, amateur and individual investors are taking
their investing even more seriously than in the past, placing more
emphasis on facts and fundamentals rather than on hearsay or gossip.
   A developing trend, according to Janke, is the growing use of
dividend reinvestment plans to help build club holdings and keep
commission costs low. More than one-quarter of clubs appeared to be
using such plans, he said.
   Close to a thousand companies offer reinvestment plans, in which
dividends are transferred to the shareholder's account with the
company. In addition, most plans allow additional monthly or
quarterly amounts to be sent directly to the company, thereby
eliminating or greatly reducing brokerage costs.
   Philip Keating, president of NAIC's Southeast Florida Council,
comments that the disciplined, fundamentalist, long-term
perspective of members is often made difficult by the media and
professional and institutional investors.
   He claims the media and professional investors, whom he
described as ``the herd on the street'' and the ``flock on the
block,'' promote the notion of in-out trading and distract from
fundamental considerations.
   ``Wall Street changes its opinion on stocks many times more
often than the real long-term fundamentals of the underlying
companies change,'' he said in an analysis of the Top 100 in
``Better Investing,'' NAIC's monthly magazine.
   Copies of the report are available at $2 from the National
Association of Investors Corp., 1515 E. Eleven Mile Road, Royal
Oak, Mich. 48067. Annual membership of $31 includes the magazine
and the NAIC Investors Manual.

   In the temporary Navajo Tribal Council
office, one clock runs five minutes faster than another a few feet
away, an unintended symbol of a government thrown out of sync by
the alleged corruption of its chairman.
   Peter MacDonald, who had held the highest office of the
200,000-member tribe with one interruption since 1971, was voted
out by the tribal council in February following allegations that he
demanded kickbacks.
   The 60-year-old MacDonald, who says he's innocent, has lived for
years like a potentate in plain view of Indians whose austere
circumstances are proverbial. And yet while he rode in limousines
and flew to Europe, Hawaii and the Super Bowl, he also promised
economic development _ a vision of herdsmen becoming technicians.
   After spending $650,000 to remodel his offices following his
January 1987 inauguration, MacDonald was secure in his fourth term
until January when the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Indian
Affairs began investigating corruption in tribal governments.
   Witness after witness told of MacDonald demanding kickbacks. His
son, Peter ``Rocky'' MacDonald Jr., testified after receiving
immunity from prosecution, using a code term in speaking of
under-the-table payments to his father as ``golf balls.''
   When the 88-member Tribal Council began its winter meeting in
early February, it rebelled.
   On Feb. 17, a Friday night after many MacDonald supporters had
left, the dissidents voted 49-13 to place him and Vice Chairman
Johnny Thompson on administrative leave.
   The majority picked Leonard Haskie as interim chairman on March
10 and has stood united since, giving rise to th name ``49ers.''
   ``The joke around here is that it's the 49ers versus the
Stealers,'' said Cecil Jones of Chinle.
   Past Navajo leaders ``usually were very wealthy men, but I
wouldn't say they compare to MacDonald,'' said Duane Beyal,
Haskie's press secretary and chief assistant to former chairman
Peterson Zah. ``With them, they were counting herds of sheep; with
MacDonald, it's the green stuff.''
   In visits to some of the 109 reservation chapters, or wards,
MacDonald has maintained his innocence. He has refused repeated
Associated Press requests for interviews and declined to respond in
writing to a list of questions.
   Although the Navajo Supreme Court upheld the council action,
MacDonald refused to stop giving orders or vacate what Haskie calls
``the Mahogany Palace'' wing of the administration building.
   ``I am innocent. And I am entitled under the law to be presumed
innocent. But the Tribal Council could care less,'' MacDonald wrote
in an opinion piece for the Gallup (N.M.) Independent.
   He has acknowledged taking ``gifts'' from contractors but argues
gift exchanges are a time-honored way of doing business by Indian
chiefs. To Haskie, that's a distortion of Indian tradition.
   ``Those gifts were tokens to establish a longterm friendship
with an individual, not hundreds of thousands of dollars but small
things _ bracelets, moccasins, a shawl,'' Haskie said.
   No one knows how much MacDonald realized from the tribe's 1987
purchase of the Big Boquillas Ranch, a 491,000-acre spread in
north-central Arizona. Phoenix real estate broker Byron ``Bud''
Brown testified that he arranged for a Scottsdale oilman to buy the
ranch for $26.2 million and sell it a few hours later to the
Navajos for $33.4 million.
   Brown said he gave MacDonald $50,000 in cash and the use of a
BMW sedan, along with paying off a $25,000 loan; dissidents claim
MacDonald may have received one-tenth of the profit. A federal
grand jury in Phoenix is investigating the allegations.
   In 1975, MacDonald was indicted on fraud and income-tax-evasion
charges. A deadlocked U.S. District Court jury in May 1977 failed
to reach a verdict, and the judge ordered a directed verdict of
acquittal.
   The longtime tribal leader is not without defenders.
   ``Mr. MacDonald is a very strong statesman for Indian people
across the country,'' said Donald Benally, chairman of the
council's Advisory Committee until Haskie named a new panel.
   ``I think we would have really made a big stride in our economic
development if Mr. MacDonald would've gone on without any political
interruptions.''
   MacDonald, an electrical engineer, worked in the aerospace
industry in Southern California before he returned to the
reservation, where people still live in traditional, five-sided,
log-and-mud hogans tucked into remote canyons or squatting atop
wind-swept mesas.
   The native of Teec Nos Pos, a tiny community less than five
miles from both Utah and New Mexico in the Four Corners heartland
of Navajo tradition, served three terms as chairman before Zah won
the 1982 election.
   Four years later, MacDonald defeated Zah by about 750 votes out
of 61,000 cast.
   Haskie said he doesn't know whether he'll run for the
$55,000-a-year position in 1990. He added that he expects the
chairmanship to have less power when he leaves office.
   ``I never sought this job; it just happened so fast,'' said the
43-year-old civil engineer.
   Haskie has persuaded the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs and
Citibank Corp. of Arizona that he is legally in charge.
   John H. Stevens, the BIA's Navajo Area director, said courts had
upheld the council majority's action despite MacDonald's claim that
a two-thirds majority was needed to remove him from office.
   Noting that Citibank had decided to honor Haskie's signature on
checks, Stevens strengthened Haskie's hand on April 6 by empowering
him to allocate contracts controlling $91 million in federal funds
for such purposes as Navajo police work, forest management, fire
and judicial services.
   Stevens, a San Carlos Apache who grew up in Arizona, views the
council's action as a legal housecleaning, but MacDonald has
claimed that the BIA is trying to undermine tribal sovereignty.
   ``This happens in foreign countries, not the Navajo nation,''
said council delegate Anderson Tully of Teesto. ``They are copying
communistic countries.''
   John Chapela, a Window Rock attorney who claims to have gathered
37,000 signatures in a drive to recall MacDonald, has visited about
25 chapters to show the Senate videotapes.
   ``Mr. MacDonald is his own downfall,'' said Chapela, whom
MacDonald has fired from three tribal positions. He said MacDonald
is ``our best salesman of the need for a constitution'' that would
ensure accountability and spell out procedures for removing leaders.
   MacDonald rejects a constitution as ``an Anglo form of
government.'' And Haskie said tailoring a constitution to tribal
needs would ``require extensive discussion, debates and public
hearings.''
   Meanwhile, the uncertainty continues.
   Paula Martin, director of the Navajo ethics office, said she
believes many people remain neutral about MacDonald, with few
recognizing Haskie as a legitimate successor.
   ``I think there should be a new election for chairman,'' she
said.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Torture is an ancient practice, but the science
of rehabilitating its victims has just started receiving serious
attention in the past few years. This nation's most ambitious
effort at treating the victims' psychological as well as physical
wounds has been undertaken at a private non-profit clinic in
Minneapolis.

   At a clinic in a small stucco house near the
University of Minnesota, doctors make a point of wearing street
clothes instead of white coats, and patient files are stored in a
bank vault.
   Medical instruments are kept out of sight, along with scissors
and other sharp objects. A psychologist may counsel a patient one
day and take him to the dentist the next; the whine of a drill or
sight of a needle can cause terror.
   This is a story about people whose personalities have been taken
apart, piece by piece, and the people who try to put them back
together. The stucco house with its mismatched furniture, colorful
artwork and donated plants is the Center for Victims of Torture,
the nation's most ambitious attempt to rehabilitate torture
survivors.
   The psychologists, doctors and others who work here face a
distinct disadvantage: Torture is ancient, but this is a science
still inventing itself. ``We are designing the car while riding in
it,'' Linda Valerian says.
   Though still a long way from the research, training, treatment
and education institute envisioned by a governor's task force, the
private, non-profit center already is looked to for leadership by a
dozen groups trying to launch similar programs in Los Angeles, San
Francisco and Elizabeth, N.J. In June, representatives of each
group will travel to Minneapolis for four days of workshops.
   The conference will focus on treatment of trauma because medical
research on torture survivors has yet to be done. The 10 doctors,
psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers at the Minneapolis
outpatient clinic have borrowed from the treatment of rape victims,
Vietnam veterans and others.
   Executive director Douglas Johnson thinks torture victims are
more profoundly damaged by their experience. ``If you were raped or
mugged, you would still have some hope of rescue,'' he says. ``But
being tortured by your government means losing all recourse.
There's a sense of abandonment to evil.''
   Nearly three-fourths of the center's clients suffer from
post-traumatic stress disorder, the disease of combat soldiers,
rape victims and earthquake survivors. Symptoms include nightmares,
flashbacks, loss of memory, inability to concentrate, and
uncontrollable outbursts of anger.
   In the beginning, client assessments were kept to a minimum, for
fear that too many questions would trigger memories of
interrogation. ``For most people though, we've found the process
was actually comforting,'' says Johnson, whose staff has begun
compiling information as a prelude to serious research. The center
also is raising money to renovate a much larger building the state
is donating to enable the program to expand.
   So far, 147 survivors and their relatives have been treated at
the center. They have come from 21 countries, including Cambodia,
Ethiopia, South Africa, El Salvador, Honduras, Iran and Vietnam.
Eventually, the center hopes to treat 100 a year.
   Nearly all now live in Minnesota. With its myriad church and
state refugee programs, the state has the highest per capita
refugee population in the nation: 39,000 out of 6 million
residents, not counting Central American and other illegal aliens.
All told, Johnson thinks there could be as many as 6,000 torture
survivors among them. Los Angeles could have 50,000 or more, he
says.
   Minnesota's clinic, established with the help of Gov. Rudy
Perpich in 1985, is one of two full-service torture-treatment
facilities in the United States. Chicago's Marjorie Kovler Center
for the Treatment of Survivors of Torture opened in 1987, five
years after Copenhagen established the first center. Others are
operating in Toronto and Paris.
   Typically, anywhere from one to 10 years pass before a client
finds his way to Minneapolis for treatment. The physical evidence
may be long gone, but the invisible, psychic wounds have yet to
heal.
   The victims' initial interview with Barbara Chester, the
clinical director, may mark the first time they have ever discussed
their experience. Some have trouble remembering; others can bring
themselves to speak of it only in the third person, relaying tales
of horror that happened to ``others.''
   ``It's hard for a nation of Donahue-watchers to understand the
reticence of torture survivors,'' says Chester, a psychologist.
``In the Third World, life is much more personal. Some things are
simply not talked about.''
   Women who were sexually abused by their captors may view
themselves as pariahs, she says. ``There's also the stigma that you
must have told them something, you must have joined the enemy, to
be still alive.''
   Torture victims may not see the connection between the beatings
of three years ago and the anxieties of today. But such delays
aren't unusual. ``You're so busy surviving, it may not be until you
rest for a moment that this comes out,'' Chester says.
   Center physician Neal Holtan has learned not to mince words: ``I
may ask point-blank if they've ever been tortured.'' Often, even
when the answer is yes, the response is an unequivocal no. In some
of the world's prisons, he says, ``it's considered normal to be
beaten up every day.''
   When the long-repressed symptoms do surface, the most mundane
encounters, the most common objects, can cause panic. ``A knock on
the door, a ring of a bell, the turning on of a light bulb can
trigger bad memories,'' says University of Minnesota law professor
David Weissbrodt, a board member of both Amnesty International and
the center.
   Center staffers wear street clothes because many clients are
afraid of uniforms. ``Even the sight of a mailman can upset them,''
Chester says.
   For clients' protection, files are stored in a bank vault. For
their comfort, the stucco house is unmarked. And when the center
opened, four Buddhist monks ceremoniously chased evil spirits out
of each room.
   Psychologist Rosa Garcia-Peltoniemi and her colleagues probe
gently. ``We are careful not to play the role of interrogator, and
we watch out for anything institutional in the atmosphere of the
place.'' She looks at her donated office furniture and sighs. ``I
worry that my chairs are too drab.''
   Garcia-Peltoniemi, who came to America as a Cuban refugee in
1970, is especially attuned to her clients' adjustment problems. In
their native countries, they may have been students, professionals
or tribesmen. In America, they lose those identities.
   ``Refugees in America are also exposed to more risk than the
average person,'' she says. ``They may live in poor neighborhoods
with drugs, crime, assaults. For refugees who've been traumatized,
another incident can have a powerful effect.''

   For those kept alive by the American dream, the reality can be
daunting. ``They may feel angry at the political asylum process,''
says Chester. ``They may feel that Americans should know what's
happened. There's very little recognition of their terrible grief
and loss.''
   The World Medical Association defines torture as ``the
deliberate, systematic or wanton infliction of physical or mental
suffering by one or more persons acting alone or on the orders of
any authority to force another person to yield information, to make
a confession, or for any other reason.''
   Reports of torture have surfaced in 90 countries, according to
Amnesty International, the worldwide human rights organization. By
its count, torture is systematic in 30 countries, a serious problem
in another 30.
   Historians have tracked the institutionalization of torture to
the Greeks and the Romans, who used it to extract confessions from
slaves. Torture spread through the criminal justice system.
Eventually it was used against citizens as well as slaves.
   The pattern has stayed consistent through the ages, Chester
says. ``A small group of disenfranchised people are tortured for
state security reasons. It begins there, but it doesn't end there.
Invariably, torture spreads.''
   The notion of torture as truth serum has long since been
disproved; extreme pain is likely to elicit whatever a torturer
wants to hear.
   But information isn't necessarily the objective, Johnson says.
``The real purpose of torture is to dismantle the personality,
leaving an empty husk. It is to leave the person ineffective,
afraid to act, unable to lead, a warning to the rest of the
community.''
   To those ends, it is chillingly effective, he says. ``No one can
withstand modern torture.''
   Torture victims may be forced to witness mock executions; to
watch loved ones being tortured; to swallow or inject massive doses
of drugs that carry terrible side effects; to breathe water _ or
worse.
   Overstimulation and sensory deprivation are common:
intermittent, uncontrollable blasts of noise piped into cells;
hooded prisoners made to stand naked in brightly lit cells for
interminable periods; cells flooded with cold water, making sleep
impossible. Frequent cell changes heighten helplessness.
   ``Imagine how you would feel if every time you came home the
furniture was moved and there were new people living in your
house,'' says Pat Rengel, chief legislative counsel for Amnesty
International-U.S. ``People become totally insecure _ there's no
feeling of control.''
   Disorientation, overstimulation and sensory deprivation are
among the hard-to-detect, psychological methods that are replacing
the blunt-force trauma of the past. One reason for the change is
the world's heightened awareness of human rights abuses. Another is
the heightened awareness of the workings of the human mind.
   ``Since we know so much more about the psychology of the human
being,'' Rengel says, ``it opens the door to people who want to do
other than good.''
   A decade ago, it was possible to identify the country
responsible on the basis of a victim's injuries. Today's methods
are more uniform.
   ``You don't need to be in a highly sophisticated setting to use
electricity to torture people,'' says Rengel. Even in remote areas,
she says, ``people can charge up a field battery and take it
along.''
   In some cases, electric shock is administered under a doctor's
supervision. ``There's evidence of health professionals'
involvement in Uruguay, Argentina and Chile,'' Johnson says. ``In
Europe, there's evidence that doctors and psychologists are
involved in designing prisons to keep people disoriented.''
   Some techniques are more subtle _ and more devastating. One
woman was made to choose between two forms of torture, thereby
becoming a participant.
   Often, a torturer persuades a victim that following certain
rules will result in rewards, such as a visit from relatives, or an
extra ration of food. But the rules change constantly.
   ``They want you to think you have some control. But you can
never figure out the magic words,'' says Valerian, who has
testified at immigration hearings as an expert witness on human
rights abuses.
   After weeks, months or years, the ordeal is over. Freedom is
restored, often as capriciously as it was taken away. Some
survivors manage to slip out of the country. ``The escapes in many
cases are as dangerous as the imprisonment,'' Chester says.
   Nearly 80 percent of the center's clients find work, although
``most people wind up with survival jobs,'' says Leigh
Bristol-Kagan, a social worker. She says some are highly
indecisive, a holdover from imprisonment, when wrong decisions held
weighty consequences. Low tolerance for stress is common, as are
troubled relationships within suvivors' families.
   Problems with immigration judges are common. ``Because they have
divorced themselves from their emotions, clients have gone in and
in great detail, related what happened to them in a monotone,''
Johnson says. ``The judge doesn't believe them.'' The center often
calls upon the Minnesota Lawyers Project, a sister organization,
for help.
   About 30 percent of the clients are on anti-depressants. Many
are plagued by real or imagined pains, crying spells and feelings
of hopelessness, panic, guilt and shame. Also common is ``psychic
numbing,'' a sense of detachment from others and an inability to
experience pleasure.
   ``We think strong people tend to drive deep in themselves and
protect some part of themselves, to wall it off, divorce themselves
from their bodies, in terms of joy and relaxation as well as
pain,'' Johnson says.
   ``If their sexuality or their emotions are being used against
them, they divorce themselves from that. It gets them through, but
when the torture is over, that part of them remains dysfunctional.''
   The Minneapolis clinic has a budget of $350,000 this year,
compared to $195,000 in 1988. The money comes from foundation
grants and private donations; clients pay no fees for their
treatment.
   Some seek only medical care, others request long-term treatment.
Invariably, things get worse before they get better; how much
better remains to be seen. ``We dramatically help a few patients
and miserably fail a few,'' Holtan says. ``Most fall into the
middle ground.''
   Still, the mood at the center is hopeful. Torture victims who
seek treatment tend to be intelligent and motivated, staff members
say.
   ``What we see here are the survivors,'' says Chester. ``We are
constantly amazed.''

   Transforming an ordinary citizen into a
skilled torturer is easier than one might think, says a longtime
Amnesty International volunteer.
   Linda Valerian, who is also a fund-raiser and coordinator of
volunteers for Minnesota's Center for Victims of Torture, has
testified at immigration hearings as an expert witness on human
rights abuses. She gained some of her insights from a former
Salvadoran torturer, whom she interviewed at length.
   Valerian remembers him as ``charming and likable. He was most
concerned that I would be upset by what he had to say.'' The
torturer, who'd escaped to the United States, agreed to be
interviewed to clear his conscience, she says.
   His recruiters used a common technique. ``Part of the training
involved propaganda induction sessions,'' Valerian says. ``He'd
been told that World War III had started. Communists were secretly
infiltrating the country, using it as a beachhead to take over the
Western world.
   ``It was imperative that he be made to believe these people were
holding the fate of the Western world in their hands.''
   In reality, the victims had been chosen at random, Valerian
says. ``He saw elderly men, pregnant women and kids. Still, he had
no idea they weren't communists.''
   As part of his indoctrination, the torturer was himself tortured.
   ``The torturers are often beaten three times a day, sexually
humiliated and punished arbitrarily,'' Valerian says. ``This
normalization of violence is the key. The training lasts nine
months. This man from the back of his waist to his knees was one
giant callus from canings with broom handles.''
   At the same time new recruits are being beaten, Valerian says,
``they're taught that they're the ones who are informed as to
what's really going on. They're the elite.
   ``There are people who do enjoy it. There's the power. The
perks. The promise of a job for life. They're given cars. And
they're paid very well, with liquor and drugs for the asking. A lot
of the torture is done under the influence.''
   The Salvadoran came from a family of 14 in a rural area. ``They
were very poor and always hungry,'' Valerian says.
   For a time, he did all that was asked of him. ``He finally began
to wonder when one of his superiors told him to cut the head off
the body of someone they'd murdered and place it on his body as a
warning to others,'' Valerian says. ``He couldn't do it. He
couldn't bring himself to mutilate a dead body.''
   Then he saw a commanding officer cut the finger off a corpse _
he wanted the dead man's ring.
   ``He said, `That's crazy. We're acting like animals.''' Valerian
says. ``He escaped the next day.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ From Vietnam westward to Laos and Cambodia lie
the remains of more than 2,300 Americans listed as missing in
action since the war ended 14 years ago. Now the communist
government has opened the doors wide for Americans to come in and
search for their dead, apparently in hopes that more cooperation
with the West will lead to more sorely needed economic aid. The
third of three articles.

   On that day in 1967 when the skies
filled with U.S. warplanes raining bombs, a former North Vietnamese
militiaman remembers burying an American airman who was shot down
in a rice paddy.
   On a recent spring day, Bui Van Lai, now 52, along with 10 other
Vietnamese men and a group of Americans, were digging for the
remains of the missing flier on the land that is now a cornfield
grazed by water buffalo.
   In Vietnam's paddies and peaceful fields sprinkled with violets,
in the foreboding triple-canopy jungles, in the chilling waters of
the South China Sea, from Vietnam westward to Laos and Cambodia,
lie the remains of more than 2,300 other Americans also listed as
missing in action.
   For 431 of the missing, their final resting place is apparently
at sea, off the coast of Vietnam, more than half of them from Navy
carriers. An 82-day undersea recovery operation using divers and
special barges 16 years ago was unsuccessful, although some
wreckage was found.
   Now, after more than a decade of basking in a bittersweet
victory in self-imposed isolation, communist Vietnam is welcoming
Americans back in increasing numbers to search for their fallen
comrades, and even joining them in their effort. What Vietnam wants
in return is badly needed American aid for a country that won the
war but couldn't manage the peace.
   Even Vietnam's top official for MIAs, Nguyen Can, accompanies
the joint U.S.-Vietnamese excavation team as Bui Van Lai leads them
through the mud of Ha Son Binh, a wilderness 45 miles west of Hanoi.
   Farmers who once were victims of U.S. air attacks gather in
curiosity around the searchers as they map the plot of land where
the American pilot is believed buried.
   Quach Thuc, 68, her teeth rotten from Vietnamese chewing
tobacco, points to the sky. ``I saw the crash,'' she says. ``I
didn't want to look. I ran away.''
   The second crewman in the plane was captured, spent six years in
a prison camp, and was freed by North Vietnam along with 590 other
Americans during ``Operation Homecoming'' in 1973.
   Today, the Americans come armed not with laser bombs, but with
compasses, tape measures, trowels, dental picks and whisk brooms,
the tools of the archaeologist. Their mission is to preserve the
skeletal remains for their journey home.
   Each bone is measured, its position sketched and photographed
and then reassembled in a lab, just the way it was found, for
identification.
   ``I want the whole bone because I can make the best, most
scientific statement,'' says Peter Miller, a forensic
anthropologist and archaeologist with the U.S. Central
Identification Laboratory in Hawaii. ``If there are teeth in that
jaw, that jaw is going to be fragile. Therefore, I'd better be
careful how I dig it out because I want the dentist back in the lab
to have a whole set of teeth.''
   The laboratory has a computerized data base on every tooth of
every missing American who fought in Vietnam, so if the teeth are
recovered they can be matched with the X-rays.
   The Joint Casualty Resolution Center in Hawaii, which searches
for MIAs, has all of the information on the crash, including the
site and names of the missing airmen, based on eyewitness reports
of other pilots and on informants such as Bui Van Lai. From bone
fragments alone, Miller can determine the race, sex and age of the
victim.
   But on this day and the next, the searchers are unable to find
the American remains, even though they uncovered some pieces of
wreckage. Time has altered the terrain and played tricks with Bui
Van Lai's memory. The searchers must move on, but Miller hopes to
try again another time.
   While other U.S. and Vietnamese search teams crisscross the
countryside in U.S.-made vans, the families back home keep alive
their last link to the lost. Some 3,600 of them belong to the
National League of Families, which was founded in 1970 to push for
the return of any Americans still alive, the fullest possible
accounting of those still missing and the repatriation of remains.
   ``The league's position is that Americans are still held, a
policy based on history of the issue, known discrepancy cases and
the intelligence information which supports our view,'' says Ann
Mills Griffiths, executive director of the league, who has a
brother among the MIAs.
   ``The vast majority of family members believe Americans are
alive,'' Mrs. Griffiths says. ``They don't necessarily personalize
it for themselves, saying `I believe my husband's alive.' They say,
`I believe Americans are alive. I'm not sure about my own
relatives.'''
   For many families, the mental torture never ends until the
fallen are buried.
   ``It is a human trait to hope that individual is alive unless
you have some indication that man is dead,'' Mrs. Griffiths says.
``Even though it's sad to lose someone you love, if he's buried
with military honors, it's done with for you. It's over.''
   All of the MIAs except one, Air Force Col. Charles E. Shelton, a
native of Owensboro, Ky., have been legally declared dead, so the
family can collect benefits. Just under half the MIAs were declared
killed at the time of the battle, based on eyewitness reports, but
heavy fire or other circumstances prevented recovery of their
remains.
   Shelton was shot down in the mountains of Laos on his 33rd
birthday 24 years ago. U.S. rescuers contacted him by radio on the
ground and he indicated he was in good condition. Villagers and
defectors told authorities he was taken prisoner by communist
Laotian forces.
   Shelton is among the so-called ``discrepancy cases,'' in Vietnam
and Laos, in which some Americans were alive when last seen and the
United States has reason to believe they were taken into captivity
or turned over to communist authorities.

   Over the years, Shelton has been promoted from captain to
colonel, his wife, Marian, has turned 55, and his five children
have grown up, including one son who was ordained a Catholic priest.
   While authorities say his official status as America's only POW
in Vietnam is symbolic of U.S. determination to make sure every MIA
is accounted for, his wife believes he is still alive and waits for
his return, cherishing the memory of their first meeting on the
tennis courts in Owensboro when she was 13 and he was 14.
   ``I think God gives all of us a cross to bear,'' says Mrs.
Shelton, who lives in San Diego.
   Vietnam has repeatedly denied it is holding live American
prisoners or is storing in morgues the remains of MIAs, returning
them when it suits its political purposes.
   ``We have not been able to prove anyone is still alive, but
given the information we continue to receive, we cannot rule out or
ignore that possibility, so we are going to continue to pursue the
issue,'' says Lt. Col. Keith Schneider, a spokesman for the
Pentagon.
   The United States has received more than 1,100 firsthand reports
of sightings of live Americans. In 63 percent of the cases,
Schneider says, the Americans had been in Indochina but had
returned home and are not missing in action. Twenty-one percent
were fabrications. The other 16 percent are under continuing
investigation.
   Can says some Vietnamese people have been giving out false
information on POWs and trafficking in MIA remains by digging up
Vietnamese graves and trying to pass them off as the remains of
Americans in the mistaken belief that they will be rewarded with
entry into the United States.
   ``What good is it for us to keep one or two American MIA
prisoners?'' asks Can. ``What good is it for us to hold remains if
we return to the United States nearly 600 POWs. Living prisoners of
war are much more valuable if we choose to use them as leverage.''
   Schneider and Mrs. Griffiths both say that since retired Gen.
John W. Vessey Jr., President Reagan's emissary, held high-level
talks with the Vietnamese in Hanoi in August 1987, there has been
increased cooperation.
   That is evident in the field, where Vietnam has allowed more
American searchers to come in, including forensic anthropologists.
   But still there is a long way to go. Vietnam, Laos and China
have turned over the remains of fewer than 300 Americans. No
remains have been returned from Cambodia, where 83 Americans are
listed as missing. Like Vietnam, the United States has no
diplomatic relations with Cambodia, whose government is under the
control of the Vietnamese.
   Can says the Vietnamese have been trying to settle the issue as
fast as they can. But Vietnam's speed depends on the cooperation
the Vessey mission pledged in helping the country obtain
humanitarian aid from non-government organizations for disabled
veterans and children.
   ``On their part,'' Can says, ``they will have to help us in
solving the humanitarian concerns of Vietnam.''
   By law, the United States is forbidden to give Vietnam any
financial or material assistance. But it does contribute indirectly
by keeping non-government charitable organizations informed of
Vietnam's needs and by making it easier for the organizations to
satisfy complicated regulations in sending goods and people to
Vietnam.
   For the families of the missing, the vigil is never ending. Some
of their children are now older than their fathers were when they
were lost.
   One family, Rosella and Walter Fitts, have stayed close to their
home in Abington, Mass., near Boston, for nearly 20 years except to
attend meetings of the National League of Families in Washington,
and to speak in New England to keep alive the MIA-POW issue.
   ``We haven't been out socially in over 18 years,'' says Fitts, a
66-year-old bulldozer operator. ``We never go anywhere. I'm afraid
a phone call will come or a car will come in the driveway with some
information.''
   The Fittses' son, Richard, a Special Forces Green Beret
sergeant, has been missing since Nov. 30, 1968. He was only 21 at
the time, married and a father. Now his only son is 22, older than
his father was when he was reported missing. His wife didn't
remarry until a year ago.
   In March, the call the Fitts had waited for came. Military
officials told Mrs. Fitts that a U.S. excavation team had uncovered
an undetermined number of human remains at a site in Laos where a
helicopter believed carrying her son and six other military men had
crashed in November 1968. The remains have been sent to the U.S.
Central Identification Laboratory.
   But Marian Shelton, Rosella and Walter Fitts, and others like
them resist the finality of death.
   ``I've had that feeling right from the beginning that he was
alive,'' says Mrs. Fitts. ``I just can't get rid of that feeling. I
had a dream of seeing him in a cave alive way back.''
   Fitts says he had hopes his son was alive and suspected he was
being held in Laos by the communist Laotian government. ``They're
not dashed,'' he says. ``We play the waiting game again.''
   Even if the Central Identification Laboratory confirms the
remains are those of his son, Fitts says, he would get a second
independent opinion. ``I would hate to give up and then have him
walk up the driveway.''
   Fitts clings to the green beret his son sent him for Father's
Day in 1968, shortly before he left for Vietnam, and to an
accompanying letter on a piece of yellow lined paper.
   ``... When you hold that beret in your hands, you hold me
because we are part of each other ... Please take care if it, Dad
... Treat it like your own son, Dad, because, believe it or not,
the beret you hold in front of you is your son.''
   Every morning and every evening, the Fittses hold the beret in
their hands.
   ``The minute you pick it up, you just feel him, that he's right
there,'' says Mrs. Fitts.

   Hollywood of late has been preoccupied with
reliving the Vietnam war, but at least one of the central players
in that controversial conflict says he hasn't been the least bit
interested in reviewing any celluloid versions of those turbulent
times.
   ``I was there,'' says Nguyen Cao Ky. ``I know what happened.''
   Ky, who was prime minister of South Vietnam in the mid-1960s,
made this observation recently in an interview at his seafood
packing plant next to the dark, sluggish waters of Bayou Caillou.
   It is in this remote little Cajun community, he says, that he
hopes to end an exile odyssey which began nearly 35 years ago, when
he and 1 million of his countrymen fled south following France's
defeat at Dien Bien Phu in 1954.
   ``I grew up in North Vietnam, near Hanoi,'' he said. ``When I
was 20 I was recruited by the French colonial government to fight
the communist insurgents. I began my military career in 1949 as an
infantry officer in North Vietnam and later received flight
training in Algeria and Paris.''
   Ky's flight to Saigon in 1954 marked the first stop of the
odyssey. Two decades later, after losing again to the communists,
Ky went into exile for the second time, this time in the United
States.
   Now, he says, he hardly ever thinks about those days, when Ho
Chi Minh City was still called Saigon and he was the supreme
commander of South Vietnam.
   ``I am a Confucian,'' he adds, by way of explanation. ``We
believe there are times of joy and times of sadness; what will be,
will be. But it's true that I did have absolute power when I was
made premier, after Ngo Dinh Diem was forced out in 1965. You may
recall there was no congressional body in South Vietnam at that
time. For more than two years, my word was the absolute law.''
   At that time Ky _ who still is slim and young-looking at 59 _
was a dashing young fighter pilot. He favored flashy flight suits,
carried a pair of pearl-handled pistols and frequently appeared,
thus garbed, in U.S. news magazine photo layouts.
   In fact, Ky and his wife, then a glamorous airline hostess who
was fond of cowgirl outfits, often were depicted as a ``fun
couple'' who were representing our side in an unpleasant little,
U.S.-backed adventure that would contain communism in Southeast
Asia. History proved otherwise, of course, and Ky's government
since has been given mixed reviews, as has the U.S. involvement in
Vietnam.
   Asked about reports of civil rights abuses during his time as
premier, Ky smiles sadly. But the smile quickly disappears when he
is asked about rumors he stashed millions of dollars worth of gold
and jewels during his tenure as premier.
   ``My wife and I had only about $30,000 when we came to this
country in 1975,'' he says. ``And when I left South Vietnam, on the
day Saigon fell, I took nothing with me except my uniform and the
helicopter which I flew to a U.S. warship. I had managed to get my
wife and family on a flight out just two days earlier, while Nguyen
Van Thieu, who had succeeded me as premier in 1967, fled with his
family weeks before Saigon fell.''
   He adds, ``That is why I am the only South Vietnamese leader
today who is able to go freely among our people in exile. They know
I was a patriot who fought to the last.''
   Author Neil Sheehan, whose book on the Vietnam war, ``A Bright
Shining Lie,'' recently won the Pulitzer Prize, remembers Ky and
Thieu as ``corrupt Young Turks'' who rose to power in South Vietnam
as U.S involvement dramatically increased. Ky flatly denies the
characterization.
   ``I have a clear conscience,'' he says. ``It's true I had power,
but I'm proud to be able to say that it did not corrupt me. If I
had stolen millions of dollars I could live like a king in this
country, but obviously I don't live like a king. Believe me, I was
a soldier fighting for freedom, not a politician interested in
power and money.''
   Former Gen. William C. Westmoreland, who commanded the U.S.
forces in Vietnam throughout most of the `60s, says he remembers Ky
as an honest soldier who was revered by his pilots and officers in
the South Vietnamese Air Force.

   ``I saw Ky a few months ago in New Orleans, at a reunion of
soldiers who fought in Vietnam,'' Westmoreland said when contacted
recently at his home in Charleston, S.C. ``I always thought of Gen.
Ky as a committed military man and it's obvious that the men who
served with him still hold him in very high regard.''
   Westmoreland concedes he had heard rumors of gold being shipped
out of South Vietnam, but says he never heard of Ky being connected
with any such stories.
   In Dulac, Ky is the president of Southern Gulf Seafood
Processors, Inc. The operation consists of a small packing plant
which processes shrimp and tuna caught by Vietnamese fishermen.
   Ky, who moved to Dulac several months ago, leases the processing
plant from a bank in nearby Houma. His earlier business venture in
this country, a small liquor store-delicatessen in Orange County,
Calif., ended in bankruptcy.
   Ky has generally tried to keep a low profile since coming to
this country. He says he has gotten some financial support from
other Vietnamese here and in turn works in behalf of Vietnamese
refugees.
   ``I have spent most of my time working with and trying to help
the Vietnamese people who came to the United States as refugees,''
he says. ``That's why I am in Louisiana. I found I like the fishing
business and have an opportunity to help my people here and make a
living at the same time.''
   In 1984, his association with refugee groups led columnist Jack
Anderson to brand Ky, whose wife and family still live in
California, as a leader of Vietnamese criminal elements in this
country. Anderson said Ky had smuggled $8 million in gold and
jewels from South Vietnam.
   ``I was stunned,'' Ky recalls. ``There was absolutely no truth
in that column. If there had been the U.S. government would have
taken some action by now, don't you think?''
   Ky says he had considered suing Anderson for libel but was
advised against it by Westmoreland, who participated in an
unsuccessful libel suit against CBS several years ago.
   ``Westmoreland said he found libel suits are hard to prove and
you end up spending a lot of money,'' Ky says.
   Ky has found contentment in Dulac, a fishing community 80 miles
southwest of New Orleans. He says the south Louisiana climate
reminds him of Southeast Asia, complete with French-speaking
natives, mosquitoes and plenty of Vietnamese to socialize with.
   ``Right now I'm busy trying to make a living with this
processing plant and a fishing boat I bought three years ago,'' he
says. ``I'm also involved in an effort to form a fishing co-op that
would benefit the shrimpers in this area.
   ``Since I've been here I've tried to help the Vietnamese
fishermen with marketing their catches and with personal details
such as housing, obtaining proper licenses and insurance and such.
I feel I can be a liaison between them and the established
community here.''
   He also spends part of his time commuting back and forth between
Dulac and Southern California, where his youngest daughter recently
graduated from law school.
   ``My five children have made the adjustment very well,'' he
says. ``They have become Americanized and my oldest son has married
an Italian girl. But, coming to this country has been harder for my
wife, who stays in California to be near her children and
grandchildren.''
   Ky says he enjoys associating with the Vietnamese fishermen, who
now comprise 65 percent of the shrimpers in the area.
   ``They see me, not as a general, but as another fisherman, and
as a friend,'' he said.
   Asked whether he still dreams of returning to Vietnam, he
replies, ``Yes, sometimes, but I realize it's not possible the way
things are now.''
   He said his main regret was not coming to this country during
the war to promote and explain South Vietnam's cause to the
American people.
   ``I have found the American people to be very fair and
open-minded,'' he says. ``But I had no idea how the American public
opinion was turning against the war. I only knew what the generals
and the U.S. ambassador and the CIA were telling me. Back then, to
me, they were America.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Since it was built almost two centuries ago, the
White House has been slathered with at least 39 layers of paint,
hiding intricate carving in its stone and causing the stone itself
to deteriorate. That plus age, weather and some clumsy restorations
efforts in the past have left the president's mansion in bad need
of repair. Now they're trying to get this old house spruced up in
time for its 200th birthday.

   On a muddy hilltop in Rock Creek Park, Vincent
Palumbo picks his way among the mossy, broken blocks of sandstone
that once were part of the nation's Capitol.
   Brush grows over the weathered pile. A fallen tree blocks his
path.
   With a hammer and a chisel, Palumbo breaks off a sample from one
stone, then shakes his head and turns away. He tries another, this
time marking it with a bold splash of orange dye.
   This stone will now become part of the White House.
   Palumbo's work this day is one step in the complicated process
of restoring the stones of the presidential mansion, some of them
intricately carved, to their original glory in time for the White
House bicentennial in 1992.
   The $2.4 million project includes the removal of at least 39
accumulated layers of paint that have been slathered onto the
building over almost two centuries.
   The National Park Service, which maintains the White House and
its grounds, awarded the contract to Stone Carving and Restoration
Enterprises Inc. of Washington.
   Overseeing the work as technical adviser is Palumbo, master
carver of Washington Cathedral, the seat of the capital diocese of
the Episcopal Church and one of the city's landmarks.
   Palumbo, who came to this country from his native Italy at age
26, has worked on the unfinished cathedral as a stonecarver since
1961. He succeeded his father as master carver after his father's
death in 1966.
   Several years ago, Rex Scouten, then the head usher of the White
House, asked Palumbo to repair a fireplace. Later he was asked to
restore the columns of the North Portico when it was repainted in
1984. The East wall of the building had been restored in 1980.
   In the current project, the remaining sandstone walls are being
exposed for the first time since 1797, when the White House was
first painted.
   In an interview in his shop at the cathedral, surrounded by
gargoyles and blocks of marble, Palumbo says, ``It's a national
thing. There is some kind of pride in being involved in restoring
the residence of the president of the great nation. Here you have
this immigrant who came over with almost nothing, and to be called
to restore the White House is a great honor.''
   The restoration, officials say, is much needed.
   Until 1980, the White House had been repainted about every four
years. After a study requested by Scouten and the National Park
Service in 1976, the Bureau of Standards recommended that all the
paint be chemically removed. Each section of wall is left bare for
several months to allow the porous surface to dry. In the meantime,
damaged stonework is restored.
   The sandstone for the White House was quarried from Aquia Creek
in northern Virginia.
   The cornerstone was laid in 1792 and the walls were built and
decorated from 1794 to 1798, the work being done by 10 to 12
stonecutters from Scotland.
   ``The walls represented the finest stonework yet produced in the
United States, and portions of them survive today, the only
examples of 18th-century craftsmanship that remain in the
building,'' architectural historian William Seale wrote in his 1986
book, ``The President's House.''
   ``It's still a good solid building,'' Palumbo says as he guides
a visitor along a scaffolding on the North wall. ``It's just that
the surface of the stone has been corroded.''
   Gary Walters, who succeeded Scouten as chief usher, agrees. The
Coast and Geodetic Survey examined the house in 1976 and attested
that it was stable and not moving.
   Removal of the paint has disclosed both beauty and damage that
were not known to be there.
   ``There are 39 layers of paint that are identifiable,'' Walters
says. ``There may have been more than that. They just took the
paintbrushes and crammed the paint in there and we'd find it 3@8 of
an inch thick in some of this stonecarving. It just hid a lot of
this.''

<TEXT>WASHINGTON: of this.''    Carved swags of foliage, dogwood blossoms,
fish scale designs and roses surround the windows. Rich scrollwork tops
the Ionic columns.    But time, weather, the successive layers of paint
and some clumsy restoration efforts along the way dealt unkindly with the
Scotsmen's work.    Just west of the main entrance on the Pennsylvania
Avenue side of the residence, the keystone of an architrave, an arch-like
stone window frame, cracked. Rainwater seeped in and froze. The resulting
collapse caused a separation of nearly an inch between two of the windowframe
blocks.    The ornamental border of the window is also blackened, believed
to have been caused when the British burned the White House in 1812. 
  Most of the damage is less dramatic _ a piece missing here and there
from a moulding, a crack in a ledge, a damaged rosette under a windowsill.
   Some broken dentils, the teeth-like blocks that project under the cornice,
had been rebuilt by being encased with lead, apparently in a restoration
carried out when President Theodore Roosevelt had the West Wing built in
1901.    The lead boxes held the moisture inside rather than letting it
escape. ``I took off one of those boxes and the stone was just like mud,
like mud,'' Palumbo says. All of the stones had to be replaced.    All
in all, the work has added up to more than they expected. Congress has
appropriated $2.4 million for the job, and Walters says more money may
be needed.    Walters is saving chunks of crumbling stone to take with
him to the next appropriations hearing.    The stone being used in the
restoration was removed from the Capitol during an expansion project in
1960 and 1961. It was quarried from Aquia Creek at the same time as the
White House sandstone.    This is the stone that the Park Service keeps
in its maintenance yard in Rock Creek Park.    ``Coming from the same
quarry at the same time, it's the same density and has all the same characteristics,''
says Jim McDaniel, White House liaison officer for the Park Service.
``It's as authentic as you can get.''    However, Walters says, ``one
of the problems is that the big blocks of stone have been sitting there
so long, and they weren't in the greatest of shape when they were taken
off anyway.'' Palumbo estimates that about half of the stone is not usable.
   ``Anybody would say this is no good,'' says Palumbo, pointing to a
battered block lying outside the North wall, trucked there after he marked
it in the maintenance yard. ``But I go in the middle. This is a very good
piece of stone inside. Very tight veined. Not porous. It will give you
a very smooth face, very smooth.''    The veteran stonecutter likens the
process to removing the bark from a tree to find the good wood.    At
the White House, he makes blue chalk marks on the wall to show sections
that need to be replaced. A cardboard pattern is cut to fit, and the new
piece hewn from the good stone.    ``The paint has sealed the stone,''
he says. ``Stone needs to breathe, too. After they remove the paint, you
will be surprised at the nice little foliage that will come out that people
never knew was there.''    Palumbo recommends that the paint be stripped
from the structure every 10 years and the stone be left exposed to the
air for five or six months.    On this day, the master carver had clambered
under a clear plastic tarpaulin erected to protect the bare wall and was
watching as Matteo Gennaro, who also worked on the project at the Capitol
nearly two decades ago, labored with a carbide tool and an air hammer.
   ``You've got to chip away little by little, so it takes time, even
with the air compressor,'' Palumbo says. ``If you want to do the job in
an accurate way, want to do what you are supposed to do, restoration is
very slow motion work.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Like diapers, razors, and even wristwatches,
contact lenses have joined the growing ranks of throwaway items.
Cheaper lenses now can be worn for a week or two and tossed in the
trash. If they hurt your eye, just take them out and put in a new

<TEXT>
   Soft contact lenses, those floppy pieces
of plastic that help people see without wearing eyeglasses, have
reached a popular American culture benchmark. They've become
disposable.
   That could mean a lot of changes involving the way people view
the little lenses that make things clearer for 23 million Americans.
   Hundreds of thousands of people are already wearing disposable
lenses, even though up to now they've been available only on a
limited basis. Eye doctors are flocking to lectures about them, and
consumers are wondering what's going on.
   ``They've really captured the interest of the American public,''
says Dr. Scott MacRae, an ophthalmologist from Portland, Ore., who
is also a consultant to the Food and Drug Administration for
ophthalmic devices.
   He speaks from experience. He wears a disposable lens in his
right eye.
   ``I don't think we've ever seen anything, in my experience, that
gained this kind of acceptance,'' says Hal Johnson, president of
professional products at Bausch &amp; Lomb, the nation's leading seller
of contact lenses. ``We're in high gear. And I mean high gear.''
   It hasn't been too long ago that basketball games were stopped
while players scoured the floor for a missing contact lens. Most
people still coddle and clean their lenses, treating them like tiny
treasures.
   They even buy insurance policies to protect them from loss or
damage.
   Now, along come some lenses that can be worn for a week or two
and tossed in the trash. If they hurt your eye, just take them out
and put in a new pair. No more expensive cleaning solutions. No
more tender-loving care.
   Is ``wear 'em and toss 'em'' the wave of the future?
   Probably not, say officials at Bausch &amp; Lomb and other eye care
experts.
   The main reason is that most of the most of the lenses available
can only be worn by patients who are nearsighted. Another negative
factor is the cost _ between $300 and $500 per year.
   Disposable contacts were introduced in the United States in July
1987 by Vistakon Inc., a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson, which up
until March was the only maker of a disposable lens with national
distribution. Vistakon's throwaway lenses are called Accuvue.
   Bausch &amp; Lomb started selling disposable contacts nationally in
March and CIBA Vision, the second-leading maker, has started
selling disposable contacts in California that can be worn by both
nearsighted and farsighted people.
   CIBA's Kim Little says lenses, called NewVues, should be
available nationally later this year.
   Johnson says Bausch &amp; Lomb expects that between 10 percent and
20 percent of all contact lens wearers in the country will switch
to disposable lenses.
   But even that small percentage will have astounding business
implications for the contact lens industry.
   Consider that a patient who normally would have walked into an
optometrist's office and left with a new pair of lenses could now
walk away with u to 52 pairs of lenses.
   The average disposable customer, using either a one-week or a
two-week replacement schedule, will use 39 pairs of lenses a year.
   That means that instead of selling four million lenses a year to
the roughly 2 million disposable customers, eye doctors will sell
156 million lenses a year.
   Bausch &amp; Lomb is expanding its three largest contact lens
manufacturing plants, including the renovation of an area in
Rochester, roughly the size of two football fields, that will be
devoted to the company's SeeQuence line of disposable lenses.
   This flurry of activity is all possible because Bausch &amp; Lomb
and Vistakon have been able to dramatically lower the cost of
making a contact lens.
   Irving Aarons, a stock analyst for Arthur D. Little in
Cambridge, Mass., estimates that Bausch &amp; Lomb can make a
disposable lens for less than $1, maybe as low as 75 cents. It
sells two lenses for $5 to practitioners, who turn around and sell
them for $7 to $10.

<TEXT>
   The company's standard lens costs about $1.30 to make and is
sold for between $15 to $30, Aarons says. Practitioners will sell
each of those lenses for $40 to $50.
   ``They're selling a smaller number of lenses for a wider margin
now. But with disposables, they'll be selling a huge number of
lenses for a smaller margin,'' Aarons says.
   More important than the business implications, disposable
contact lenses are going to play a key role in ushering in a whole
new era in eye care among the many wearers of contact lenses in the
United States.
   ``One of the things that we're seeing is that with the
introduction of disposable lenses people are understanding that
frequent lens replacement is a viable option,'' says David Archer,
director of marketing for Bausch &amp; Lomb's professional products
division.
   The average contact lens wearer replaces one lens a year, Archer
says, and usually suffers some discomfort or some difficulty with a
lens before deciding to replace it.
   If people begin to think that contact lenses are expendable, he
says, they will be more likely to replace them, as often as every
week or at least once a year.
   The only real difference between a daily-wear soft contact lens
and a disposable lens is the recommended wearing time. Both are
made of flexible plastic.
   Disposable lenses and extended-wear lenses are slightly thinner
than daily-wear lenses, making them slightly more comfortable but
slightly less durable.
   The label on the disposable lens container notes the lenses are
only FDA approved for a maximum of two weeks at a time. Doctors
were concerned that people wouldn't comply with the recommended
wearing time, but so far studies are indicating that the compliance
rate is very high.
   As far as cost, Bausch &amp; Lomb has streamlined the technique used
to make a contact lens and can now manufacture lenses 70 percent
faster than several years ago. The increased volume has allowed the
price to fall.
   Bausch &amp; Lomb also offers a frequent lens replacement program
that allows patients to get new lenses at different intervals, such
as once a month or once every three months, and requires them to
stick the discarded lenses on a card and mail them back to the
company to insure compliance.
   Archer likens it to the dental care industry's effort that
started three decades ago to promote the benefits of regular
checkups and teeth cleaning to prevent tooth decay.
   Dr. Augustus Falcone, a Rochester optometrist who specializes in
contact lenses, agrees with Archer.
   ``If you tell a patient about being able to change lenses every
week, it starts the negotiation,'' Falcone says. ``OK, you don't
want to change your lenses every week. How about every month? How
about every three months? Whatever they pick is better than what
they have now.''
   Studies have shown that frequent replacement of lenses _ at
intervals suggested by eye doctors _ can greatly reduce the risk of
getting a severe eye injury from a contact lens, MacRae says.
   ``If disposable lenses get people to change their lenses more
often, then they've probably done a good thing,'' he says.
   But MacRae, and many other eye doctors, still are not convinced
that extended-wear contact lenses, like disposable contacts, are
completely safe, no matter how often you replace them.
   He said a new study of 22,000 extended-wear contact lens wearers
indicates that they are three to five times more likely to suffer a
serious eye injury than someone who takes his lenses out at night.
   ``We don't know why this is, but my hunch is that an
extended-wear user doesn't get enough oxygen to the cornea and this
can cause problems,'' MacRae says.
   Falcone learned about the disposability of contact lenses nine
years ago when professional golfer Calvin Peete came to him in the
middle of a golf tournament in Rochester because he had torn a
contact lens.
   ``He could have won $24,000 and he had to withdraw because of a
little piece of plastic,'' Falcone says. ``I mean, holy mackerel,
what's a lens. So I started sending him fistfuls of lenses.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The Rev. William Abney remembers how the DeBarge
youngsters would captivate the audience as they sang in the choir
at his Bethel Pentecostal Church. But, he says, they weren't able
to cope with their rapid rise to fame as Motown recording artists.
Today the once-promising DeBarge singing group has split up, three
having been convicted on drug charges.

   Just five years ago, the singing
DeBarge family was at the top of the pop music world, promising to
be one of Motown's brightest lights of the 1980s.
   The four brothers and a sister, with their silky harmonies first
perfected while singing in their uncle's church choir, were often
compared with the Jackson Five.
   Further, there were five more talented siblings who also were
either already in the music business or were waiting in the wings.
   Since then, three of the siblings have been convicted of drug
charges and at least two others have had other brushes with the law.
   Only one, El DeBarge, has remained in the musical spotlight.
   Etterlene DeBarge Rodriguez, the mother of 10 and grandmother of
15, blames drugs.
   ``In every life a little rain must fall, and this rain happened
to be drugs,'' she says. ``They had a calling, but they deviated
because they were young and very talented. There are so many vices
out there to destroy you.''
   Seated next to her recently in the family's stylish Grand Rapids
home was son Jonathon, better known as ``Chico.'' Just two years
after gaining national attention with his self-titled, pop-funk
album on the Motown label, Chico was on his way to prison.
   Last June, at the same time he was planning a European concert
tour, the 22-year-old singer-songwriter was stopped by federal
authorities at Detroit Metropolitan Airport after returning from
Los Angeles. They found 2.2 pounds of cocaine in his bag and that
of a companion.
   Brother Robert, 33, who gained notoriety in the late 1970s and
early '80s with the now-defunct soul group Switch, also was
convicted in the case.
   Robert began serving a five-year, three-month prison term in
February. On April 12, Chico began a five-year, eight-month
sentence.
   In the past few years, Mrs. Rodriguez also has seen son El
convicted of creating a disturbance for the beating of a Calvin
College student after she reportedly resisted his advances.
   She has seen son Tommy spend time in jail for cocaine
convictions and son Robert arrested for allegedly telling a
stewardess he was carrying a bomb.
   Rodriguez believes the arrest of Robert was a ``blessing in
disguise'' because of what she says was a longtime drug habit.
   Rodriguez says her home is a gift from son El, as is the new
Cadillac in the driveway. In the garage is a new black Jaguar El
has just bought for himself.
   The Rev. William Abney remembers how the family would captivate
the audience as they sang in the choir at his Bethel Pentecostal
Church in Grand Rapids.
   But, he says, they weren't able to cope with their rapid rise to
fame.
   ``It was like putting an ice-cold piece of glass into burning
hot water,'' Abney says. ``It'll crack.''
   Fame came first to Robert and Tommy in the late 1970s and early
'80s with the group Switch, which had a contract with Motown.
   The family struck gold again with Motown in the early '80s when
siblings El, Bunny, James, Mark and Randy hit the top of the soul
charts and then crossed over to pop with a series of hits: ``Time
Will Reveal,'' ``Rhythm of the Night'' and ``All This Love.''
   With fame, however, came varying levels of success and the
pressures of being in the spotlight. By 1986, the group had
disbanded and El and Bunny wound up solo artists for Motown.
   The family is now spread across the country. El commutes between
California and Michigan with brother Tommy, who plays bass in his
group. Marty, James and Randy are trying to get another recording
contract and Bunny also is hoping to record again, Rodriguez says.
   The youngest DeBarges, 19-year-old twins Carol and Darrell,
aren't budding musicians, though Darrell wrote some songs on El's
new album, ``Real Love,'' which has been rising on the Billboard
charts since it was released in February.
   In fact, almost every member of the family had some part in the
new album.
   ``We're still together, just not market-wise,'' Chico says.
   Chico believes the music business and aggressive record
companies are at the root of many performers' problems.
   ``The business is very deceitful,'' he says. ``It will deceive
you and bring you up to where you can't handle things.''
   Traci Jordan, vice president of publicity for Motown, which has
signed Chico through 1992, would not discuss Chico or any other
member of the DeBarge family.
   Dennis Hunt, black-music critic for the Los Angeles Times, was
less reticent to critique the family's music.
   ``As a family, they never took off as people expected,'' he
says. ``El seemed to be the most talented one. When he left, the
others didn't seem to fare quite as well.''
   Hunt says the DeBarge family problems were well-known in the
music community.
   ``People knew about their strange activities,'' he says. ``I
can't think of any group there were more rumors about.''
   Hunt is pessimistic about the group's future.
   ``There is nothing to indicate any niche for them now or in the
future,'' he says. ``The main route to success for black musicians
is through dance music, and that's taken more by women than men.''
   Chico says he intends to write songs in prison about his
experiences, but when he gets out he probably will turn to gospel
music.
   That pleases his mother.
   ``I never wanted my children to be stars,'' she says. ``But they
were young and talented and there are a lot of temptations out
there.''

   Actress Joanne Woodward is turning historian,
tapping memories to re-create a revolution in American acting led
by the late Lee Strasberg and the Group Theater.
   ``For a long time I'd wanted to do something about the Group
Theater,'' she says. ``I didn't quite know what. When Lee died, I
suddenly panicked and said, `Pretty soon there won't be anybody
left to tell the tale.'''
   Now, she is hosting ``Broadway's Dreamers: the Legacy of the
Group Theater,'' the first program in the fourth season of the
``American Masters'' series on PBS. It will be televised on June 26.
   For Miss Woodward, it is the end product of five years of
interviews, wedged into a busy career, which accounts for her
changing hair colors and styles on-screen. There is also archival
footage of the 1931-41 Group Theater.
   What surprised her most about her interview subjects, she says,
``is their depth of involvement and how immediate it was. They
remembered everything like it was yesterday. It is 50 years ago and
they're saying, `Lee said this and I said this.'''
   Founders of the Group Theater were Strasberg, who taught method
acting, director Harold Clurman and casting director Cheryl
Crawford. They were dismayed at the lack of real life in the
drawing room comedies of the 1920s. So they created the Group
Theater to perform original American plays which would mirror _ and
they hoped would change _ the life of their times.
   In the Depression they banded together with 28 actors who agreed
to use an ensemble approach to acting. Most were in their 20s.
   Katharine Hepburn, interviewed briefly during the show, says
that at 21 she attended one planning meeting for the Group Theater
and declined to join. She said she told them, ``I want to be a
star.''
   Miss Woodward says, ``I'd heard that story for years. I always
kind of thought it was apocryphal.''
   Elia Kazan recalls joining, as an apprentice, the second year.
Instead of the Group Theater paying him, he paid $20 a week. When
he ran out of money, he waited tables. John Garfield joined in 1934.
   Miss Woodward is shown, in 1987, directing ``Golden Boy'' in
Williamstown, Mass., during the 90-minute TV show. The Group
Theater first performed that Clifford Odets play in 1937.
   ``Young actors (in Williamstown) had a hard time. You had to
explore that naive passion,'' Miss Woodward says. ``That kind of
naivete I think disappeared in World War II.''
   The person seen most in the show is Robert Lewis, an original
Group Theater member who now teaches acting. ``Bobby remembers
everything in detail,'' Miss Woodward says. ``When in doubt we cut
to Bobby. Isn't he funny?''
   The actress studied acting with Sanford Meisner, an original
member of the Group Theater. Her husband, Paul Newman, studied with
Strasberg.
   She would like to have made the show more theatrical. ``I had
visions of Bobby going with me to some of the camps where they
worked in the summer. There was not time nor money.
   ``My dream is now to do a film about the Group Theater. I'm
convinced there is a great deal more to be said. I would direct it.
I think that whole period is fascinating. It has never really been
examined. I would imagine one would have to dramatize it, in a
fictitious way. There are still, surprisingly enough, quite a few
people around who were actively involved.''
   The Group Theater did change American theater. For one thing, in
1933 it presented ``Men in White,'' Broadway's first hospital play.
Now hospitals have become a staple of theater, film and soap opera.
   After the Group Theater dissolved, some one-time members were
called before the House Un-American Activities Committee. Some
careers were ruined.
   The 14-week ``American Masters'' season, presented by WNET-New
York, focuses on people in the creative arts who have shaped
American and world culture.
   Miss Woodward has a busy summer ahead. Daughter Clea gets
married. Then Mr. Newman and Mrs. Newman will rehearse their title
roles in a James Ivory-Ismail Merchant film, ``Mr. Bridge and Mrs.
Bridge.''
   She also attends Sarah Lawrence College. ``I went to college for
two years. I started back about 1974. It's going to be the longest
BA anybody has ever known. You don't major at Sarah Lawrence. I
just take lots of things. I'm taking playwriting. It's great fun.''
   Returning to the subject of the Group Theater, she says, ``More
than anything else, it refocused the life of the American theater.
Author Joseph Campbell talks about following your bliss. They
followed their bliss.
   ``There may have been more brilliant theater movements, like
Orson Welles', or more intellectually amazing, like Eva Le
Gallienne's. There was none that more desired change or were more
passionate for the truth.''

   With a wicked smile and a wicked song,
Christopher Mason lampoons the ladies and gents of the upper crust.
   He sings about the foibles, follies and fads of high-powered,
high-society folk like Ivana (Trump), Nancy (Reagan), David
(Rockefeller), Brooke (Astor) and William (Paley). And they love it.
   In less than two years, the sprite-like, 27-year-old Mason has
gone from private party entertainer to budding cabaret star. Now
he's appearing through May at the fabled Oak Room in the Algonquin
Hotel where he's singing not only about people like Mrs. Trump and
her yacht and Mrs. Reagan and her new life in California, but about
such topics as the water shortage and trash TV. He's a combination
of Cole Porter and Tom Lehrer with a bit of Noel Coward thrown in
for good measure.
   ``I write the words and the music. I play the piano and sing,''
Mason explains. ``So if the evening is terrible, it's all my
fault.''
   It was never hard to get Mason to perform. He was born in
England, the son of an opera singer and a civil servant. At the age
of 3, he saw ``The Sound of Music,'' came home, sat down at the
piano and played every song from the show _ with one finger.
   ``I used to drive all of my piano teachers crazy because I'd be
playing Chopin or Beethoven, and I'd always think of what I thought
was a nicer way of finishing a phrase,'' he says, recalling his
precocious childhood.
   At Cambridge, Mason majored in English and art history, but when
he came to New York, he worked long hours for little pay in public
relations and fund-raising. But he got to observe the rich at close
quarters. He also got to attend parties, lots of them.
   ``When there was nothing left to revive a party, I was thrown
toward the piano to play and sing,'' he says. ``People said, `Why
don't you do this all the time?'''
   He finally did. His big break came last May when he was hired by
fashion designer Mario ``the Prince of Chintz'' Buatta to play for
a society dinner at the New York Public Library.
   Mason wrote five new songs for the occasion. ``If you are
burning with the love of learning, write a check to the public
library,'' he crooned in his best fund-raising voice. But he also
wrote songs about Brooke Astor and Annette Reed, two of the biggest
supporters of the library. The ditties suggested that Mrs. Astor
change her first name from Brooke to Book and Mrs. Reed spell her
last name R-e-a-d.
   Mason was a big success, and people began calling to ask if he'd
appear at their parties, playing original songs.
   ``I was terrified of asking for money,'' he says. ``I'm English,
so I'm terrible at dealing with money.''
   At first, Mason would immediately say yes to a job and then ask
about the fee. Often it was less than $500. Today, he has an agent
at William Morris and his price for an evening's work can go as
high as $3,000.
   He serenaded Mrs. Trump last summer aboard the Trump Princess,
her husband's $30 million yacht.
   Mason writes during regular, 9-to-5 office hours, but finds
pressure the best tonic for non-productivity.
   ``The idea of a deadline and a check at the end of it is
irresistible for writing new songs,'' he says.
   Some of his best songs have been born on airplanes and trains.
   For the reopening of Blair House in Washington, Mason wrote a
song about it on a cocktail napkin, while he was flying from New
York to the nation's capital.
   And for his Algonquin engagement, Mason has written different
types of songs.
   ``God knows, not everybody is interested in society's
darlings,'' he says. ``So I've written a love song or two. As well
as one number about the former president called `The Reagans at
Home in Bel Air.'''
   Mason suddenly begins reciting:
   ``The Secret Service is awfully nervous
   ``They can't think what to do.
   ``They are meant to take care of the Reagans
   ``But the Reagans seem awfully blue.
   ``They are finding it hard to adjust to being ordinary folk
   ``And the pressure's not fair.
   ``Though their friends bought them quite a swell house.
   ``It's no fun being the Reagans at home in Bel Air.''
   Mason also is working on a musical called ``How To Bag a
Billionaire,'' a look at today's version of what used to be called
golddiggers, those women who want to marry for money and not
necessarily love.
   ``I'm selfishly writing the whole thing, the book and songs, but
I won't be in it,'' he says.
   The show has been delayed while Mason completes his Algonquin
engagement, and he tries to juggle all his offers from the rich and
the famous.
   ``I find myself now invited to all the big parties _ the
serious, social parties, which is a peculiar thing,'' Mason says.
``I spend time with these people. They must be aware that I am
watching them every second to see how they are behaving. Maybe
people think they are flirting with danger in a very acceptable way
by having me around.''

   ``Clara's Heart'' (Warner Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated
PG-13)
   
   Clara Mayfield is a brutally direct woman who colors her human
   relationships with a good deal of common sense,
self-righteousness and tenacity. She also has an overwhelming
humanity about her, and that specialness attracts people to her
like a magnet.
   Clara is a vibrant and rich role, one that critics last year
said could easily turn around Whoopi Goldberg's dismal film career
after such losers as ``Burglar,'' ``Jumpin' Jack Flash'' and
``Fatal Beauty.''
   Robert Mulligan (``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' ``Inside Daisy
Clover'') restrains Goldberg in his direction of this family
melodrama, allowing none of the bits and business that have become
the trademarks of her wealth of comic stage characters. That
restraint is essential to Clara herself, a Jamaican with a dark
secret.
   Clara enters the lives of the affluent Hart family from
Maryland's Eastern Shore, shortly after the crib death of their
daughter. Leona (Kathleen Quinlan) and Bill (Michael Ontkean) have
gone to Jamaica to help get over the tragedy. Clara is their hotel
maid.
   She coaxes Leona out of her depression and encourages her to get
on with life. Leona decides to bring her back to Maryland _ she
can't quite function without Clara's island sensibilities. But son
David takes an immediate dislike to Clara and accuses his parents _
rightfully so _ of bringing her home so they won't have to deal
with him. The Harts are in the process of a divorce.
   Clara eventually wins over David to the point where he'd rather
spend his weekends in Baltimore with Clara and her West Indian
friends than with his parents. He also picks up Clara's island
patois.
   But his dependency on Clara ultimately leads to her dark
revelation. And it is here that the movie falters. There is no
build-up to this awful experience in her life, and its unfolding is
an abrupt twist. And with the tale, there remain loose ends:
Letters hidden in a suitcase and found by David are never
explained; the father of Clara's child also is a mystery.
   Still, ``Clara's Heart'' is a warm movie with many lessons to
tell, if one is willing to listen. It's a movie that works better
on the small screen than it did theatrically. Its force is aided by
Goldberg's performance and a noteworthy movie debut of Neil Patrick
Harris as David. There's also a lilting score by Dave Grusin, but
once again Hollywood fails in geography: Steel music and calypso
are products of Trinidad, not Jamaica.

   ``Running on Empty'' (Warner Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated
PG-13)
   
   What ever happened to all those Weather people from the late
1960s and early '70s, all those revolutionaries who bombed
government buildings and corporations with government contracts?
All those radicals who may have killed innocents in the name of
freedom and liberty?
   They went underground. But underground is as ordinary as the
family next door.
   ``Running on Empty'' looks at such a family, who have been
wanted by the FBI for their part in a bombing in which a security
guard was accidently killed. The young couple made one mistake,
though. Not only did they take their young son, Danny, with them as
they fled, they also conceived another child while underground,
Harry.
   Cut to the '80s. Danny (River Phoenix) is a 17-year-old musical
prodigy. What to do. If he stays with his parents, as they want him
to, he must give up all ambitions in music and indeed give up his
own destiny. If he leaves them and heads for the Juilliard School,
he will never be able to see them again unless they surrender to
authorities.
   There is much tenderness in this movie, especially from
Christine Lahti as the mother. Judd Hirsch's father seems somewhat
outmoded in his '60s politics and '60s perceptions. He's also a
little selfish. He's not a very likeable man until the end, and
resolution of the movie.
   Naomi Foner has a tight and gripping screenplay, and Sidney
Lumet's direction is powerful.
   It's a nice movie for the entire family because ``Running on
Empty'' is ultimately about family.

   ``The Great Lawn'' (Columbia) _ Ross Traut and Steve Rodby
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   That could be a typo in the title of the debut album by the
quasi-jazz duo of electric guitarist Ross Traut and bassist Steve
Rodby. ``The Great Yawn'' would be more like it.
   The record is appealing for its sparse texture, but once the
novelty of these simple instrumental arrangements wears off,
there's little to sustain a listener's attention.
   ``The Great Lawn'' is most reminiscent of Pat Metheny _ Traut
and Rodby have both played with him. But Traut isn't nearly as
inventive a guitarist; he rarely strays far from the melody.
   And Traut and Rodby seem to be waiting for each other to take
charge. As a result, the energy level peaks at about a two on a
10-point scale. The most animated the duo gets is when Rodby
occasionally slaps his bass.
   One wonders how much the label, Columbia, had to do with the
artists' cautious approach to their debut. The company hails the
record as spanning ``many musical categories _ Jazz, New Age, Pop,
R&amp;B ... and Beautiful.'' With Traut and Rodby trying to please so
many audiences, it's a wonder they were able to come up with any
notes at all.
   ``The Great Lawn'' is OK as background music, but bring a book
along.

   ``Mr. Jordan'' (Atlantic) _ Julian Lennon
   
   You're Julian Lennon, and you've got two image problems to
dispel.
   One is that you're a wimp. The other is you sound too much like
your late father.
   The surprising vigor of Lennon's third album, ``Mr. Jordan,''
takes care of the first problem. And the new deep voice Lennon
unveils handles the second.
   But now he sounds like David Bowie.
   Really. It's uncanny, on the songs ``Now You're in Heaven'' and
``I Want You to Know,'' how much Lennon sounds like the late-period
Bowie. Sounding too much like someone else, of course, is never a
good sign for a musician.
   Actually, you should be glad you're not Julian Lennon. He's not
to be envied. To be the son of such an icon and emerge with your
head on straight is a victory in itself. To follow in your dad's
footsteps and have at least nominal success is quite an achievement.
   But let's face it, Julian Lennon really should find another line
of work. Lennon has no real style and precious little to say. ``Mr.
Jordan'' proves only that he can surround himself with adept
professionals and not be embarrassed.
   One wonders if the louder guitars and harsher rhythms on ``Mr.
Jordan'' show Lennon's true inclinations as a rocker or his
Zelig-like response to those who said he should toughen his sound.
   ``I Get Up,'' with lively back-up vocals, is the best effort
here. But even on this song Lennon sees fit to include an Elvis
Presley impersonation. Who's next?
   The more aggressive approach sounds better than the ponderous
sweetness of Lennon's first two albums. But only nominally. And
don't look to Julian Lennon for any sparkling originality.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Costner Turns Director and Finds His Roots</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kevin Costner, clad in his customary costume
of jeans, T-shirt, sweater and day-old beard, arrived late for an
interview but presented a valid excuse: He had been picking up tips
on film directing from movie giant Steven Spielberg.
   ``I need all the help I can get, and who could be a better
teacher?'' remarked Costner, who starts directing himself in a film
next July.
   Costner's modest office at Raleigh studios, where he once worked
as a laborer, displays evidence of the new project. On the walls
are dozens of note-pad pages detailing each scene of the film, as
yet untitled. Next he plans to storyboard _ an artist's concept of
each camera angle.
   ``I need to have that backup,'' he explained. ``I'll leave a
window for new things to come in (during filming). I need to
communicate to many people what I'm trying to do. Those ideas can
be built upon.''
   Costner gave no specifics on what he had learned from Spielberg,
but said both men had been ``dancing around each other'' in search
of a mutual project. ``The only time I worked for Steven was when I
did an `Amazing Stories' for him,'' the actor said, referring to
the old TV show.
   Three years ago, Costner was known mostly for playing the corpse
in ``The Big Chill.'' Then came ``Silverado,'' ``The Untouchables''
and ``No Way Out.'' For his new film, ``Field of Dreams,'' he
reportedly was paid $2.5 million. So why take on the added labor of
directing his next film?
   ``I have to maintain interest in what I'm doing. This particular
subject generates a certain amount of interest for me. When this
project was born, it was not on the surface a very commercial
movie. Yet I believe it's very commercial.
   ``The theme of it is people who want to talk to each other but
can't, because of the language barrier (between white settlers and
Indians). It's a period piece set in the 1860s. This is not a movie
to set the record straight, or to reinvent what happened. It's just
a theatrical piece, but it's more than that, too. There's a lot of
action in it.''
   There's not much action in ``Field of Dreams,'' a baseball
fantasy which some critics have described as Capra-esque. Costner
plays an Iowa farmer who heeds a mystery voice and builds a
baseball diamond in his cornfield; soon the ghosts of the infamous
Chicago Black Sox team show up to play.
   Costner acknowledged that the script, based on the novel
``Shoeless Joe'' by W.P. Kinsella, was a tough sell.
Writer-director Phil Alden Robinson worked on it for six years
before getting it made.
   ``I didn't have to be convinced of it,'' Costner remarked. ``The
minute I read it, I thought that I would want to do this movie.
   ``Why? I don't know. I make movies, and you need to have
subjects. The amount of movies I'll do in my life are numbered;
it's a finite number. As a script passes over me, it has to reach
me emotionally. I don't care what genre it is, comedy or action or
something else. Those don't dictate what I'll do. But it just has
to have a certain amount of poignancy.
   ```Field of Dreams' did. It also had what I'm always looking
for: other strong, strong characters. So I knew that we would be
able to attract good actors.'' Among them: James Earl Jones, Burt
Lancaster, Amy Madigan, Ray Liotta.
   Costner was born in a Los Angeles suburb, son of a power lineman
who was part-Cherokee (which helps explain his next project). His
father's work required repeated moves, and Costner recalls of
school, ``I was always on the outside.'' He studied marketing at
California State University, Fullerton, but also acted in a
community theater.
   After marrying his college sweetheart, Cindy Silva, a former
Snow White at Disneyland, Kevin quit a marketing job to try
Hollywood. He spent six years as a set worker at Raleigh Studios,
studying at night in acting workshops. After his flashback scene
was cut from ``The Big Chill,'' Lawrence Kasdan cast him as the
hell-raising gunslinger in ``Silverado.'' He clicked immediately.
   Because he believes he should support all his films, Costner did
the New York media whirl for ``Field of Dreams.'' He readily admits
that he doesn't enjoy it. He is an extremely private man, yet he
doesn't dwell on his loss of privacy.
   ``As many doors that close to you, there are others that open
up,'' he reasoned. ``I don't think anybody has been able to resolve
the privacy issue. You still see people who have a certain amount
of fame and don't know how to deal with it.
   ``There's no good answer for when something that is unique to an
individual _ their privacy _ is taken away. ... When you experience
the loss of that, it's something you'll never ever get back in your
life. There's no reason to cry or to pout.
   ``It's something I'll never get back. It's like my daughter as
she grows older, she'll never be a baby again. You have to enjoy
those times. My son just started to walk. We probably will not have
any more children, so there will never be another helpless,
helpless child. That phase is gone.''
   The Costners recently bought a getaway home in Santa Barbara,
but their main residence is not on the trendy West Side, but in La
Canada, a few miles from the Pasadena Rose Bowl.
   ``We bought our first home in Pasadena,'' he said. ``A lot of
our friends are out there, so we can keep those relationships up.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Artist's Once-Scorned Work Now Hot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OCEAN SPRINGS, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Down a dusty shell road and through
a tangle of azalea blossoms and magnolia trees, the little cottage
stands quietly these days. The tempest of Walter Anderson's life is
over; only the beauty lives on. ``He was an amazing man and I guess
there were a lot who didn't understand him,'' said his daughter,
Mary Pickard. ``He had a sad life in so many ways, but when I look
at his work I think he must have reached his own peace. I don't see
how he could have been sad and done such happy work.''
   Even here in his hometown, where residents once demanded that
one of his greatest works be painted over, the eccentric artist has
finally found favor.
   Pickard, 51, who has been the curator of her father's work for
the last 11 years, regularly leads visitors through the cottage.
Psychiatrists, psychologists, environmentalists, scientists and
artists come to see the massive body of work Anderson left behind.
   ``It really pleases me that such a variety of people have become
interested in his work,'' Pickard said.
   After being hospitalized in 1937 for a nervous breakdown,
Anderson left his wife and four children and lived alone in the
three-room cottage tucked away on the family compound in this
sleepy Gulf Coast town.
   His love of Horn Island, an uninhabited barrier island 12 miles
off shore, led to an intense study of the plants and animals of the
island that he recorded in his detailed logs, paintings and
drawings.
   ``He felt that the artist had an obligation to call attention to
the world around him. As far back as the 1940s he felt that man and
the world around him were going in opposite directions,'' Pickard
said.
   Anderson was the first to notice that the eggs of the brown
pelican were not hatching and to blame wastes from the Mississippi
River for it, Pickard said.
   In the last 15 years of his life, he spent most of his time
alone on Horn Island, rowing there in a wooden skiff which he would
turn over and use for shelter. To study the creatures of the Gulf
Coast more carefully, Anderson would submerge himself up to his
nose in the swamps and bayous around the area, staying there for
hours while snakes and alligators swam past him and birds and bugs
flew over him.
   It was not until his death at the age of 62 in 1965 that the
full range and immensity of his work was discovered.
   An avid reader, he left behind at least 9,000 illustrative
drawings. He had done 300 linoleum blocks from which he printed
drawings he would then paint and sell for $1 per foot.
   Most of his wood sculptures have disappeared with time. Anderson
left them in the woods around his cottage, and they were destroyed
by storms, Pickard said. Most of the furniture he designed and
built has also been lost.
   He also worked in ceramics, textiles and did a number of oils.
But he has become best known for the small watercolors he did of
the plants and animals of the Gulf Coast area.
   The paintings, elaborate in detail and rich in color, were done
on typing paper and the few he sold during his life went for no
more than $25, Pickard said. Today they sell for $3,500 to $6,000,
according to Courtney Blossman, president of the Friends of Walter
Anderson, a group that plans to break ground for a $1.2 million
Anderson museum in June.
   The mural which he painted on the walls of the town community
center, which many residents wanted painted over, will be the
centerpiece of the museum, Blossman said.
   ``It's amazing, but it's true. Some people were very upset with
the mural when he painted it, '' Blossman said. ``It was appraised
for $1 million 10 years ago. I'm sure it would be much higher now.''
   The mural depicts the history of the area on one side of the
building, and what Anderson saw as the ``seven seasons'' of the
Gulf Coast on the other.
   He charged the town $1 to paint it on the then-new structure in
1950 and worked on it for two years.
   ``I've heard he was never paid the dollar he asked,'' said
Pickard. ``People treated him terribly over it. He always said it
wasn't finished. He quit working on it because people would come at
all hours and bother him _ make fun of it and talk about it.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Frisbee and Rock 'n' Roll</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the bassist and songwriting partner of George
Michael, Deon Estus is used to playing to capacity crowds. But the
Detroit native has also learned to appreciate an empty arena.
   Estus, who now has a hit single of his own with ``Heaven Help
Me,'' likes to arrive early for the evening's concert so he can
pursue his favorite hobby: Frisbee.
   ``On the road I carry about 40 Frisbees with kneepads and
gloves,'' he said. ``As they set up the equipment before the show,
either in the stadium or outside the arena, there are no people
around. When we played the Orange Bowl in Florida, we had a ball.
Everybody joined in.''
   Between playing for one of the world's most successful recording
artists and making his debut solo album, ``Spell,'' Estus has
needed to stay in shape. He is already at work on another record
and will collaborate with Michael on the singer's next project, a
double LP.
   ``We understand each other,'' said Estus, who referred to the
singer as his best friend. ``We get along, we go out and have
dinner. It's very easy to sit down and come up with a song. We just
sit down and write good music. He's very professional and so am I.
He's not in competition with me.''
   Estus, whose parents both hold graduate degrees in music, had
any number of instruments to chose from as a child, remembering the
drums, bass, guitars and piano his father brought home. He quickly
mastered them all but admitted to having no such luck playing the
saxophone.
   ``I got rid of it, eventually,'' Estus said. ``It just used to
kill me. It just wasn't for me. It sounded like people when they
screech chalk on the blackboard.''
   Estus settled on the bass and was playing professionally by age
12.
   ``I used to play house parties in the summer and got 20 bucks
each time. That was a lot of dough.''
   Detroit in the 1960s was home to the Motown record label and
Estus took full advantage of the local talent. He became friends
with Marvin Gaye but turned down the opportunity to play on the
late singer's last album, ``Midnight Love,'' released in 1982.
   ``That was a time when I was busy recording. I didn't have any
idea he'd be leaving us so fast,'' said Estus, referring to Gaye's
murder in 1984. ``I thought I'd see him again. Everybody had
troubles but I didn't sense that anything like that would happen.''
   Estus referred to Motown bassist James Jamerson as ``my
teacher.'' Jamerson, who died in 1983, was instrumental to the
Motown sound, creating memorable bass lines on such hits as ``Reach
Out I'll Be There'' and ``Ain't No Mountain High Enough.''
   ``He's the man who brought syncopation to the bass,'' Estus
said. ```My Cherie Amour.' Listen to the bass parts on that. He was
a mindblower. I just never heard bass put like that _ the
expression. When you listen to records today you hear his
influence.''
   Estus' first band was ``Brainstorm,'' which toured in support of
the Whispers and the Brothers Johnson among other groups. He moved
to Europe in the early '80s, and lived in Belgium and Ireland
before eventually settling in London, his current home.
   ``I think I've been influenced by everywhere I've been,'' Estus
said.
   ``Dublin, for instance. When I first worked there I'd listen to
these local bands. The harmonies were really tricky. I was
listening to this rhythm and thought this was the thing closest to
black music I'd heard. I learned a great deal from it.''
   Estus was the silent partner of ``Wham!,'' the British band that
featured Michael and Andrew Ridgeley and had hits in the mid-'80s
with ``Careless Whisper'' and ``I'm Your Man.''
   After Wham! broke up, Estus stayed with Michael, working on the
singer's best-selling ``Faith'' LP. He found time, however, to
record ``Spell'' and served as Michael's opening act on the world
tour.
   ``Heaven Help Me,'' which features Michael on backing vocals, is
a catchy mid-tempo ballad, but Estus rated the title song of
``Spell'' as his favorite.
   ``I got a chance to produce it and I like the orchestration.
It's a fun song, a strong song. Some songs on `Spell' are more
danceable than others, some are poppy, some are soulful.''
   He appeared unconcerned that having a hit record of his own
could jeopardize the partnership with Michael.
   ``If I had a No. 1 album and he had a No. 3 album and he asked
me to open for him, I would say, `Yes.' If this album sold 2 or 3
million, I would still play with him. It's just dealing with egos.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Virginia Woolf as Incest Survivor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENEVA COLLINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   We know Virginia Woolf the writer, who gave us
such ground-breaking novels as ``To the Lighthouse,'' ``Mrs.
Dalloway'' and ``The Waves.''
   We know Virginia Woolf the feminist, who wrote the influential
essay ``A Room of One's Own,'' and Virginia Woolf the pacifist, who
created ``Thoughts on Peace in an Air Raid.''
   We know Virginia Woolf the diarist, who logged the minutiae of
her tortured life, and Virginia Woolf the suicide, who put a heavy
stone in her pocket and waded into the River Ouse.
   But until now we have known very little about the Virginia Woolf
who was sexually abused throughout her youth. A noted Woolf
scholar, Louise DeSalvo, provides us with the first complete
portrait of that woman in ``Virginia Woolf: The Impact of Childhood
Sexual Abuse on Her Life and Work'' (Beacon Press, $22.95).
   That Woolf had been abused was no secret _ she talked about it
in speeches, letters, conversations and memoirs. But previous
biographers have virtually ignored its impact on her life, treating
it as an aberration in an otherwise happy Victorian household or
perhaps even a hallucination of her ``madness.''
   DeSalvo, a professor of English at Hunter College of the City
University of New York, is the first academician to thoroughly
examine the abuse in light of modern-day research on incest
survivors.
   ``It's not as if it was hidden as a topic in any of the
biographies that have come before,'' DeSalvo said in a recent
interview at her Hunter office. ``But the major change is that in
the last 10 years the work on incest and child abuse as a field has
been so monumental that it enabled someone like me to use that work
and to read her life in the context of what we now know the effect
of incest and child abuse are.''
   A brief outline of Virginia Woolf's family and the abuse
suffered, based on Woolf's diaries, letters and recorded
conversations with others:
   Julia Duckworth and Sir Leslie Stephen, Virginia Woolf's
parents, had each been married before they wed in 1878. Gerald,
Stella and George Duckworth were children of Julia's previous
marriage; Laura Stephen was a child of Sir Leslie's first marriage.
Julia and Leslie Stephen had four children together: Vanessa,
Thoby, Virginia and Adrian.
   Woolf's mother died when she was 13 and about that time her
step-brother, George, 14 years her senior, began sexually molesting
her and her sister, Vanessa. The abuse continued until Woolf was in
her early 20s and stopped only when she had a nervous breakdown
after her father died and the household was broken up. Stella,
Woolf's step-sister who took over the running of the household
after their mother's death, may have become her step-father's lover
after his wife died.
   Late in her life, Woolf, in a period of intense self-analysis
while writing her autobiography, suddenly remembered an incident
that had apparently been repressed of being molested by her other
step-brother, Gerald, when she was 6, in which he broke her hymen.
DeSalvo thinks Woolf was devastated by the realization that the
abuse began far earlier than she had believed.
   There is plenty of other evidence of the household as a
dysfunctional family: Woolf had an erotic relationship with her
sister, Vanessa, that lasted into their 20s; Woolf's step-sister,
Laura, whom the family considered mentally deficient, was locked up
in a distant room in the house for years before being trundled off
to an asylum; Woolf's brother, Thoby, threw himself out of a window
when he was 15; Woolf had an affair with Vanessa's first husband;
after her divorce, Vanessa took up with the homosexual lover of her
brother, Adrian. The list of family entanglements goes on and on
and continues into the next generation.
   DeSalvo reread everything that Woolf wrote _ every novel, diary,
letter, essay and fragment that has been preserved in the United
States and Great Britain _ and isolated every reference to Woolf's
childhood or her fictional depictions of children.
   ``It was when I did that that it was all thrown into stark
relief, and I saw what she was trying to say,'' said DeSalvo.
   Once she learned how incest survivors talk about their
experiences, DeSalvo said Woolf's sometimes puzzling language
suddenly made sense. In a letter to Vanessa's husband, for example,
Woolf writes almost flippantly about the sexual abuse the two
suffered. DeSalvo said that is an example of ``inappropriate
response'' that victims of incest often use as a defense mechanism.
   ``The key to my own beginning to be able to figure it out was
learning what the language of incest survivors is, learning the
verbal strategies. How survivors of incest tend to create inflated
pictures of their parents. ...
   ``I couldn't figure out, for example, for the longest time why
Woolf wrote these revered portraits of her father. If you take them
straight, that's one thing, but if you read how incest survivers
typically talk about the family constellation, it makes an enormous
amount of sense.''
   One of the points DeSalvo makes in her book is that some of the
symptoms of the bouts of ``madness'' Woolf suffered throughout her
life _ depression, nervousness, irritability, tantrums _ are likely
responses to the sexual abuse rather than the congenital condition
it is often treated as.
   DeSalvo was asked whether she ever thought Woolf, with her
history of instability, was perhaps an ``unreliable narrator.'' The
memory of the abuse by Gerald when she was 6, for example, did not
surface until Woolf was in her 50s. Can her memory be trusted?
   ``One of the biggest issues that always comes up in incestuous
abuse is the extent to which people falsify memories. The paradigm
used to be Freudian (the theory that patients' reports of sexual
abuse were figments of their imaginations and based on desire). ...
All the recent work that has been done on incest survivors suggest
rather the opposite _ that any memories are authentic, and the
reason experts say this is that it is so disastrous, even today, to
be labeled an incest survivor that no one would falsify that.''
   DeSalvo is the editor of ``Melymbrosia,'' an early version of
Woolf's novel ``The Voyage Out,'' which she constructed from
manuscripts, and co-editor with Mitchell Leaska of ``Vita
Sackville-West's Letters to Virginia Woolf.'' She has also written
a book on Nathaniel Hawthorne.
   DeSalvo's new book, as disturbing as the subject matter is,
should be heralded for both its painstakingly thorough research and
the delicate and fair handling of such a sensitive subject. This is
a scholarly, not a titillating work. At the same time, it is
enormously readable and imbued with the fascination and admiration
that DeSalvo has for one of the greatest writers of this century.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Barbara Mandrell Revives Memories Of Accident</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Entertainer Barbara Mandrell curtailed
her career as she recovered from the physical and emotional
injuries of an automobile accident. She also tried to forget the
tragedy, which claimed the life of a young man.
   Now, though, she's revived those memories in her upcoming
autobiography for Bantam Books, ``Never Say Never.''
   ``Until this book, I have never shared these things except with
my neurosurgeon and my attorney,'' the 40-year-old singer said in
an interview.
   ``Other than this book, I have kind of reached a point where I'm
tired of being asked about it. I chose to forget it. But the
tragedy was part of my life, and I had to put it in. In order for
people to know me, I felt I must tell the down side. The chapter on
the crash was very difficult to do.''
   Mandrell was involved in a two-car collision north of Nashville
on Sept. 11, 1984. She suffered a concussion and fractures to her
leg and ankle. Her two children also were hurt, but not seriously.
However, the driver of the other car, a 19-year-old college
student, died.
   The book is being written with author George Vecsey, who helped
country queen Loretta Lynn write her ``Coal Miner's Daughter.''
   Finishing the autobiography is just one of a multitude of
projects for the singer who's been a recording artist for 20 years.
   Her second gospel album, ``Precious Memories,'' has just been
released. Her Las Vegas-style show, regarded as one of the best
among country music-oriented performers, is undergoing its annual
fine-tuning. She has had one week-long stint performing in Las
Vegas this year and has two more scheduled.
   ``My throat won't take more than a week at a time,'' she said.
   And she is selecting songs for another country album due out in
the fall.
   ``I'm working a lot more this year,'' she said. ``I told my
agent that except for January and July, to book me three days a
month. But some of those three days turned into a week.''
   She's rarely been off the TV screen since her network variety
show that began in 1980 and lasted two seasons, ``Barbara Mandrell
and the Mandrell Sisters.'' She's done a half dozen specials with
comedian Bob Hope, including his most recent one in March. And
she's been in countless other TV specials, ranging from appearances
with former President and Mrs. Reagan to one celebrating the
Special Olympics.
   ``I just said no to two more recently,'' she said.
   One of them was to be taped during a week she and her family had
set aside for camping.
   ``My priorities were to be a mommy and wife that week,'' she
said.
   Her gospel album is a follow-up to her previous gospel-oriented
``He Set My Life to Music,'' which won a Grammy Award in 1983. The
new one includes such gospel standards as ``Peace in the Valley,''
``Old Rugged Cross,'' ``Just a Closer Walk With Thee'' and ``I Love
to Tell the Story.''
   ``It was hard to narrow it down to the 20 we picked,'' Mandrell
said. ``I had the best time doing this album. For any Christian,
especially one who sings for a living, the feeling is very special.
   ``These are songs that I feel are mine and you feel are yours.
They belong to each of us. We grew up singing them. I had so many
memories as I recorded them, of singing them in church or singing
along to the radio.
   ``This was a nice, unexpected pleasure. Now I'll have these on
record for the rest of my life. When I'm gone, my children and
grandchildren will have them.''
   She has a persistent passion for another hit record to join her
others: ``I Was Country (When Country Wasn't Cool),'' ``Married,
But Not to Each Other,'' ``Only a Lonely Heart Knows,'' ``Sleeping
Single in a Double Bed'' and ``If Loving You Is Wrong (I Don't Want
to Be Right).''
   ``It's a never-ending desire. My biggest goal is to stay close
enough in tune with what the public wants in order to earn the
career they are giving me. I've never been satisfied with me. I
always want to be better and I pray I never lose that desire.
   ``We're chomping at the bit to make my show better. I compete
with me.''

<HEAD>World's Busiest AIDS Testing Lab Showing Its Age</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists at the world's busiest AIDS
testing laboratory face not only blood samples contaminated with a
deadly disease, but peeling paint, exploding lightbulbs and a sink
with no drain.
   There's even a sign on the elevator warning not to use it; it
gets stuck.
   New York, a leader in AIDS testing and research in this country
largely because it has more AIDS patients than any other state,
does most of this key scientific work in a laboratory built in 1917.
   Potholes line the driveway leading to the three-story brick
building, where gleaming computers sit alongside equipment rusted
with age. Exposed wires run along walls and paint peels from the
ceiling.
   ``It's kind of ironic,'' said Colleen Flood, a bacteriologist
who runs the program that tests newborns for presence of the
AIDS-related human immunovirus (HIV). ``We're down here doing work
that's at the forefront. When people come in here ... they say,
`How can you work in such a dilapidated lab?'''
   Flood and her colleagues have learned to adjust to a job that
brings with it certain measures of pride and indignity. They took
the job partly because it is more exciting than routine lab work,
but they deal with a disease that still comes with a taint and work
in conditions that can't match private labs.
   Virtually any testing needed to combat a public health emergency
in New York eventually finds its way to the New Scotland Avenue
Laboratory here, said Donald Berns, director of the Health
Department division of clinical sciences.
   When medical waste began washing up on beaches last summer, it
was bagged and sent to Berns for examination. When there was an
outbreak of salmonella in eggs, they were brought to New Scotland
Avenue.
   AIDS is overwhelmingly the state's most pressing health
epidemic. It had 20,476 confirmed cases by the end of 1988,
one-fourth the national total, and some 300,000 New Yorkers are
thought to be infected with the related HIV virus, a possible
precursor of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   The state conducts nearly 750,000 AIDS-related tests a year
here, including a half-million HIV tests. That's more than any
other laboratory anywhere, Berns said. The military conducts more
than 600,000 HIV tests a year at a Miami lab.
   Hundreds of blood vials a day are delivered by mail to the
laboratory, where they're placed in a black bin for sorting. Each
vial is assigned a number and information about the test subject is
typed into a computer. Of the 138 laboratory employees, 20 deal
exclusively with AIDS testing.
   Five white freezers hum in one of many small rooms. Each
contains 20,000 blood serum samples, part of the state's research
stockpile. Each sample taken since the beginning of the AIDS
epidemic is kept here as a ready resource for tests done on the
disease.
   The freezers stand next to a rusted sink covered with a
cardboard sign: ``Do not use sink. No drain.''
   It's one of dozens of little reminders of the building's
limitations. The elevators were installed before the Roaring '20s.
The ovens where glass was made for test tubes and beakers have been
dormant for years, so outdated the equipment isn't safe, said Russ
Toombs, the lab's operations director.
   Mold sometimes grows on the ceilings, said researcher Diana
Schoonmaker. Lights occasionally flicker and bulbs have exploded
during power surges.
   Schoonmaker was one of 15 workers who tested positive in 1983
for exposure to tuberculosis, one of many viruses tested there.
Each worker was treated with antibiotics for a year and none
developed the disease. But it scared them.
   ``It's frustrating to me,'' Berns said of the building. ``It's a
real problem to have to deal with this. But the quality of the
people make up for a lot of the problems you have.''
   Flood, 28, said her fiance, a high school teacher, didn't want
her to take the lab job because of fears about the AIDS virus.
Neither did her parents.
   ``After a while they figured that I was intelligent enough to
know that if there was any risk involved then I wouldn't take it,''
she said.
   Rosalyn Moore, who also tests blood samples for AIDS, said she
thinks twice about telling acquaintances what she does. Usually she
just tells them she works in a laboratory, without going into
specifics.
   The employees are strict about wearing rubber gloves and white
coats and say they don't worry too much about the danger. But like
their superiors, they'd like a better place to work.
   ``With New York state and all its wealth, it seems they could
provide a little better working atmosphere,'' said Mike Neal, a
bacteriologist.
   There's never been an accident involving the AIDS virus, Berns
said. The HIV virus is not ``a hardy virus,'' and quickly dies when
exposed to air.
   He wouldn't characterize the building as dangerous, ``but I also
would be dishonest if I didn't say the potential for accidents is
far higher here.''
   Modern laboratories are sealed so germs can't escape from floor
to floor. New Scotland's ventilation system is less modern _
windows are opened, often in the winter because of inconsistent
heating _ and it's believed this contributed to the TB virus
exposure six years ago, Berns said.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo has called the lab ``obsolete, deteriorating
and incapable of meeting modern federal standards for biosafety,''
and asked the Legislature for $75 million to rebuild it and six

money is tight in New York this year, with Cuomo saying he had to
deal with a potential $2.6 billion deficit as he prepared a budget
proposal for the fiscal year that began April 1.
   ``You stretch a rubber band as far as you can,'' Berns said.
``This rubber band has been stretched to the point of breaking.''

<TEXT>
   A fighter plane that combines long-range
supersonic cruise capability with a greatly enhanced ability to
dogfight at and above the speed of sound has long been an elusive
dream of aircraft designers.
   After 5{ years of research the solution to that engineering
enigma may be near at NASA's Langley Research Center, where
aeronautical visionaries believe they have seen the future in
something called the ``vortex flap.''
   The flap, with a distinctive, sharp downward angle, is designed
to improve the agility of swept-wing jets. Highly swept wings
assure the speed needed for sustained supersonic flight, but
unswept wings are preferable for the lift necessary for combat
maneuvers and short takeoffs and landings.
   The vortex flap ``would give you the best of both worlds,'' said
Ronald H. Smith, a 30-year veteran of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration who is flight project engineer for the vortex
flap experiment.
   The acute deflection of the wing's leading edge purposely
detaches the airflow over the wing and forms a tornado-like vortex
on the flap. This creates a suction that reduces drag _ the force
that resists an object's movement through the air _ during
high-speed maneuvering.
   ``This is a way to allow swept-wing airplanes to maneuver
better,'' said Smith, who has worked on X-15 rocket planes, the
YF-12 interceptor from which the SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance
plane was derived, and the FA-18 fighter.
   With the vortex flap, maneuverability would be significantly
increased at speeds of .8 to 1.2 Mach, where most dogfighting is
done, he said. Flight tests with a delta-wing F-106B test aircraft,
have found the greatest reduction of drag _ 20 percent to 30
percent _ at .9 Mach.
   With reduced drag, a plane would need less thrust. The payoff
would be a smaller, lighter engine and a plane that could faster
and farther on less fuel. Such planes would not require
afterburners needed by today's fighters to reach and maintain
supersonic flight, but which guzzle fuel.
   ``Fighters today concentrate on maneuvering,'' Smith said.
``They are not aerodynamically efficient in supersonic speeds and
don't have appreciable supersonic endurance.''
   He said the vortex flap could be used on the Navy's F-14 fighter
and the Air Force's F-111 and B-1 bombers, which have wings that
can be swept back. It could not be used on the more conventional
F-15, F-16 and FA-18 fighters.
   Another application would be on swept-wing supersonic transports
like the French-British Concorde or the American SST project that
was canceled in 1971 because of its cost and noise, Smith said.
That ``isn't our main focus but it would benefit from our research.
The vortex flap would translate into noise reduction'' because of
smaller engines and lack of afterburners, he said.
   NASA research pilot Philip W. Brown said the first flight of the
F-106B with the vortex flap last Aug. 2 was about what he expected.
   ``I was thinking it probably would be reasonably well-behaved
because we had done high-speed taxi tests. It turned out it was
better than predicted. The simulator was a lot harder to fly,''
said Brown, a former Navy fighter pilot.
   Some flight stability was lost by adding the flap to the F-106B,
a 1960s vintage fighter, but the plane is only slightly more
demanding to fly than without the flap, he said.
   Flight testing will continue for another 1{ years. It follows
five years of study encompassing nearly 3,000 hours of wind tunnel
tests.
   A fighter with supersonic endurance and transsonic maneuvering
ability would have a clear edge, said NASA engineer James B.
Hallissy, the principal investigator of the flap. ``It would be
able to get to a target faster and the enemy would have less
response time...
   ``If you can fly faster than the other guy, you can catch him if
he's running from you, and he can't catch you. The more speed you
can sustain the better off you are.''

<HEAD>Scientists Turn From Ancient Bones To Modern Crimes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doug Ubelaker used to examine
skeletons for clues to the way people lived thousands of years ago.
Now he's trying to figure out from bodies found along highways how
eight women died just months ago.
   Using calipers to measure bones and clay to reconstruct faces,
the Smithsonian Institution anthropologist brought here by a
frustrated prosecutor has helped identify the victims, women
between ages 25 and 36 with histories of drug use or prostitution.
A ninth body was sent to Ubelaker last week.
   His work has not led to the arrest of a suspected serial killer.
But he may have cleared an innocent man: Sources close to the
investigation say his conclusion that two of the women were
murdered between mid-summer and late fall led prosecutors to rule
out a suspect who had been in jail on other charges.
   An expert in the emerging field of forensic anthropology,
Ubelaker, 42, is one of about 40 U.S. anthropologists who work
regularly with police, applying knowledge of ancient skeletons to
the grisly business of solving murders.
   ``Anthropologists like myself spend their careers looking at the
bones of people who lived long ago, trying to figure out what
diseases they had, how tall they were, who they were related to,
what problems they had, how well they were adapted to their
environment,'' he said. ``It turns out, though, that the techniques
that we use to study these past populations are the same as those
needed to analyze modern remains in criminal cases.''
   Few anthropologists are willing to make the switch from cold
science to cold blood, which takes ``tremendous intestinal
fortitude'' as well as keen observational skills, said Walter H.
Birkby, a professor of forensic anthropology at the University of
Arizona in Tucson.
   Birkby, a pioneer in the field, got hooked when police found a
decomposed body and took it to a University of Kansas laboratory in
1962. At first, he was repulsed by the body, which was ``so ripe
the officers couldn't put it in their car; they wrapped it in a
plastic bag and tied it to the bumper.''
   He and other graduate students boiled the remains to the bone,
carefully measured the skeleton, and concluded it was a young
woman, who had apparently been murdered. Birkby doesn't remember if
the killer was caught; he does recall thinking, ``This is real
detective work.''
   In cases in which a body is found mostly intact, police usually
call in a forensic pathologist, a physician trained in
crime-solving techniques. But if the body has decomposed and little
is left but a skeleton, they increasingly turn to someone with a
doctorate in physical anthropology.
   ``Other people may be better with flesh, but when it comes to
bones, we're the experts,'' said Professor Alison Galloway, a
forensic anthropologist at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville.
   Forensic anthropologists can measure the width of pelvic bones
to determine sex, use microscopic pieces of a thigh bone to
calculate age, and make a clay model of a face based on the shape
of the skull.
   Dental records still are one of the surest ways to identify a
body, but they often are not available. So Birkby and others
developed skull-photo superimposition, in which they project a
photograph of a missing person onto a skull to see whether it fits.
   Although many Americans have mixed blood, Galloway said, it
often is possible to determine race _ black, white or Asian _ from
the shape of the skull, teeth and leg bones. Blacks, for example,
tend to have projecting jaw bones and ridges above the eyes. Whites
have receding cheek bones and narrow noses, and Asians have
shovel-shaped incisors and more curved leg bones.
   A careful examination of a skeleton often reveals not only the
type of murder weapon but also its precise characteristics. In a
previous Massachusetts case, Ubelaker told police he was nearly
certain, from some oddly chipped rib bones, that a young woman had
been killed by a long-bladed knife with a bent tip. A knife
matching that description was later found near the murder scene.
   Calculating when a person died is often trickier, involving
rough estimates of the rate of decay based on the body's location
and exposure to moisture, sun and animals, Galloway said.
   In about 15 percent of the cases referred to him by the FBI,
Ubelaker said, the remains aren't even human _ they are bones from
dogs or deer, oddly melted pieces of plastic, or something else.

<HEAD>Researchers Try To Develop Artificial Oyster Reefs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marine researchers hoping to boost oyster
production in the Gulf of Mexico are experimenting with reefs of
coal ash and cement.
   Oyster fishermen used to dump the shells back into the water,
providing a nice hard bed that the oysters could anchor to, but
they since discovered there was a market for the shells in
road-building and calcium supplements.
   ``If the baby oyster falls on something hard, then he attaches
to it and forms a shell; if he fall on the mud bottom, then he
dies,'' said Mississippi Power Co. spokesman John Hutchinson.
   The utility, which has a steady supply of ash, is working with
Mississippi State University and state agencies on an aggregate of
ash and cement mixed and molded into baseball-sized pellets.
Clusters of pellets form the reefs. Adult oysters were put into
four ponds with artificial reefs several weeks ago.
   Results may not come for a year, the time it takes for oysters
to mature.
   But in a study in Delaware, ``we saw no difference in mortality
in oyster growth or ash and concrete versus oyster growth on clam
shells,'' said Kent Price, associate dean of marine studies at the
University of Delaware.
   Preliminary figures also indicate the artificial beds could be
cheaper than buying clam shells, which are dredged from lakes
Pontchartrain and Maurepas in Louisiana _ a practice decried by
environmentalists. Mississippi $150,000 last year putting clam
shells in the Gulf and $12,500 on oyster shells, Price said.
   Researchers expect the aggregate to cost $9 to $10 per ton,
compared with $15 a ton for shells, Hutchinson said. ``If we can't
beat the price of the clam shells, then we've priced ourselves out
of the market.''

<HEAD>Johns Hopkins University $20 Million Heart Disease Study</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAGERSTOWN, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers will be looking for 5,000
older recruits for a $20 million, four-year study of the causes of
heart disease and strokes _ blamed for more than half the deaths of
people aged 65 and older.
   The Johns Hopkins University Researchers, funded by the National
Institutes of Health, will be recruiting people 65 and older in
Washington County, Md.; Forsyth County, N.C.; Allegheny County,
Pa.; and Sacramento County, Calif.
   ``It's only recently that we understand that getting older
doesn't have to be associated with these diseases,'' said Dr. Linda
Fried, who will lead the study. ``There is room to prevent these
diseases and enhance the health of older adults. That is really
what the goal of this study is.''
   The four sites were chosen because they had a stable population
of people ages 65 and over, and had enough trained medical
personnel to do the tests, said Dr. Teri Manolio of the National
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.
   Participants will be given a physical and asked about their
eating and health habits and medical and reproductive history.
Researchers will measure heartbeats, breathing, blood sugar and
cholesterol, and will determine whether there is any narrowing of
arteries linking the heart and brain. Participants will be
contacted every six months by telephone and in person. After three
years, they will be asked to have a follow-up examination.
   Fried said initial test results would be compiled within two
years. Final research results are expected to be released in four
years.

<HEAD>Money Won't Buy Happiness, But Lowers Stress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE DRESSLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Money may not buy happiness, but a study
suggests that it certainly can reduce stress.
   Sheldon Cohen, a psychology professor at Carnegie Mellon
University, analyzed the results of a Louis Harris and Associates
Inc. telephone survey of 960 men and 1,427 women aged 18 or older.
The Harris pollsters used a Perceived Stress Scale developed by
Cohen and colleagues.
   They found that stress tends to decrease as age and household
income increase, Cohen said. ``There's a nice relationship between
income and stress level. Generally, the lower your income, the
higher your stress level. The more money you make, the less stress
you report... The people who seem to be best off are in the $45,000
to $50,000 a year range.''
   Cohen's scale measures how much stress people feel based on
their answers to multiple choice questions about how often they
experience certain thoughts and feelings. One key question asks:
``In the last month, how often have you felt difficulties were
piling up so high that you could not overcome them?''
   ``The scale makes some assumptions about what stress really
is,'' Cohen said. ``Stress is when you're overloaded and you feel
you can't deal with the demands in your life. What you think and
feel is really what matters.''
   Harris used Cohen's scale to conduct the survey for the U.S.
Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion in 1983. Harris
gave Cohen acess to the data about two years later, and he analyzed
the results for nearly three years.
   He found that women tend to feel more stress than men;
professionals and managers report less stress than blue-collar
workers; the more educated people are, the less stress they report;
white people report less stress than blacks; People who are married
or living with a mate and those whose spouse died are less stressed
than those who are single, divorced or separated.
   Those who reported more stress in the study also reported more
symptoms of illness and went to the doctor and smoked more often,
Cohen said. Married people tended to be healthier than non-married
people.

   A number of religious groups are creating their
own versions of the Yellow Pages telephone directories that exclude
business owners who don't belong to the faith, arousing complaints
of discrimination.
   The Christian Pages, for example, looks like a slimmer version
of the commercial advertising directories published by the regional
phone companies and other publishers. It follows the usual format
of yellow newsprint and black-and-red type.
   ``The Christian Pages directory is designed to assist born-again
Christians in locating members of the Body of Christ should you
desire to do business with one another,'' the guide's introduction
says.
   The welcome invokes Galatians 6:10, a New Testament verse that
reads: ``As we therefore have opportunity, let us do good unto all
men, especially those who are of the household of faith.''
   ``There's definitely a demand and a need for it,'' said Bob
Hover, who has published the 75,000-circulation phone book for 300
Michigan churches since 1980. ``For me, this is a ministry. It's a
way for me to serve the Lord and be a blessing to the Christian
community.''
   Advertisers are required to sign a statement of faith in Christ,
Hover said. Business owners professing other faiths are refused
space.
   ``Anybody who's truly a Christian obviously has very high
standards,'' he said, adding that recent scandals involving
evangelists haven't hurt business. ``There's an advantage to doing
business with a person who truly believes.''
   But others see such directories as a way of shutting out those
who aren't seen as believers.
   ``There's no doubt that anything that's an exclusive listing is
divisive to the public,'' said Elliot Wright, senior vice president
for programs at the National Conference of Christians and Jews in
New York. ``I happen to be a Methodist and we put out a catalogue.
But it's stuff that Methodist churches need.
   ``Other than those kinds of approaches, our position is it's
just not a neighborly thing to do.''
   The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith views Hover's work
more as a curse than a blessing, said Jill Kahn, assistant legal
affairs director at the Jewish group's Washington, D.C.,
headquarters.
   ``We think that simply by advertising in that grouping, they're
sending a very powerful `Buy Christian' message _ and that we find
unacceptable,'' she said.
   A Christian directory in Los Angeles went bankrupt in 1977 after
a judge awarded damages to two Jewish businessmen who sued after
being denied advertising space, Kahn said.
   That guide violated California's civil rights act, which bans
religious-based trade conspiracies, Kahn said. Michigan and most
other states lack such specific laws, she said.
   Owners of some Jewish business directories have been warned
against overstepping their bounds, Kahn said. Most advertise only
items used in religious observances.
   Richard Lobenthal, the Anti-Defamation League's Michigan
director, said he objects to ``an innuendo in this sort of
advertising that nobody is honest or reputable unless they are
born-again Christians.''
   ``Some of the solicitations are absurd,'' Lobenthal said. ``No
one's ever been able to persuade me that there's anything religious
about a tune-up.''
   The National Council of Churches hasn't grappled with the issue
of religious business directories, said Carol Fouke, a spokeswoman
for the New York-based group.
   Baltimore-based Shepherd's Guide, which publishes Christian
directories from Maine to Florida, is the Christian Pages' latest
competition in the battle for believers' profits.
   Other religious organizations target buyers instead of sellers.
Michigan-based Christian Consumers Association promises its 14,000
members ``Christian buying power.''
   Churches and families pay $586 for a 20-year membership,
President Jerry Amster said. In exchange, the organization hunts
for the lowest price on everything from mattresses to marriage
counseling.
   ``As a group, we can negotiate better prices,'' Amster said. ``I
think it's very demeaning for a minister to go into a furniture
showroom and haggle.''
   In 1988, the group served as a go-between for more than $6
million worth of transactions, he said.
   ``We're treated differently,'' Amster said. ``It's not because
we're Christians. It's because we spend $6 million a year.''

<HEAD>Companies' Budget For Capital Spending Rises</HEAD>

   U.S. companies' appropriations for spending on
new plant and equipment rose 33 percent in the last quarter of 1988
from the third quarter, the Conference Board said in a report for
release today.
   The budget authorizations rose to $53.7 billion in the fourth
quarter from $40.3 billion in the preceding quarter and $30.8
billion in the fourth quarter of 1987, the business-supported
research organization said.
   Appropriations are considered a good indicator of how high
capital spending will be. They are the first step, preceding the
ordering of equipment, the letting of construction contracts and
actual spending.
   The petroleum industry led all sectors with a 157 percent
increase in appropriations from the preceding quarter.
   ``The best guess is that business investment this year will very
sharply outpace the overall growth in the economy,'' Ken Goldstein,
a Conference Board economist, said in a statement.

<HEAD>Purchasing Managers Say April Economic Growth Rose Modestly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's economy continued to grown in April
at a somewhat faster pace than in March, but at about the same rate
as in the first quarter, the nation's purchasing managers said in a
report for release today.
   The levels of production and new orders both registered
increases last month after posting declines in the rate of growth
in March, according to the National Association of Purchasing
Management.
   Inventory buying did not fuel the pace of the growth, as
inventories declined for the fourth consecutive month, said the
group, based in Tempe, Ariz.
   New export orders increased at the highest rate since December,
after registering three consecutive months of lower rates of
growth. Of the 67 percent of the members who said they export, 28
percent reported better export orders in April, up sharply from 22
percent in both February and March.
   The 4 percent who reported lower export orders is down sharply
from the 9 percent who said so in March.
   ``The economy entered the second quarter on a higher note than
it ended the first quarter,'' said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the
industry group.
   ``A surprising increase in new export orders appears to have
fueled the brisk rebound from March's sharply lower growth.
Nevertheless, most other indicators signal a moderate rate of
growth in the economy in the months ahead,'' he said in a statement.
   The group's Purchasing Managers' Index climbed to 53 percent in
April, a healthy increase from 50.4 percent in March. This was the
33rd consecutive month this leading indicator registered over 50
percent. A reading above 50 percent indicates the economy is
generally expanding; below 50, the economy is generally contracting.
   Bretz said the index averaged 52.4 percent in the first four
months of 1989. If that average continues the rest of the year, it
would be consistent with real rate of growth in gross national
product of about 2.5 percent, he said.

   Two dots converge on a computer screen in the
cockpit and a voice warns ``climb, climb'' in a mandatory
anti-collision system planned for the nation's airliners.
   The little round computer screen to be added to airliner
cockpits, with its ping-pong-ball images and its limited
vocabulary, may not look like much to a generation numbed by
Nintendo computer games.
   But ``TCASII'' is the latest acronym in aviation safety.
   At more than $100,000 each, the second generation of the Traffic
Alert Collision Avoidance System is also the latest pricey option
for the corporate jet.
   The system allows pilots to see the proximity of up to 30
aircraft around them, warns verbally when one gets too close and
even announces in a computer voice exactly what the pilots should
do to avoid a collision: ``climb, climb'' or ``descend, descend.''
   The collision avoidance system operates independently of
ground-based Air Traffic Control operations and would serve as a
backup to warn pilots of any problem that might be missed by the
controller.
   Attention has been focused on possible midair collisions
recently, with nine operational errors involving close-flying
aircraft handled by a major southern California facility which
brought National Transportation Safety Board warnings last week and
reports of two near misses by airliners flying over New York.
   Only the smallest planes, with no radar beacons to show their
location, would be invisible to the new system.
   In a recent demonstration in the skies over northern Virginia, a
Sabreliner 65 piloted by Tommy Littlejohn, flight operations
director for TCAS manufacturer Bendix-King, came within a quarter
mile horizontally and 600 feet vertically of an oncoming Beechcraft
Baron that was part of the demonstration.
   Passengers inside the plane saw the Baron flash by after
Littlejohn followed the voice command and climbed several hundred
feet for a safe separation.
   ``Once you fly with it, you don't want to fly without it,'' said
M. Ace Card, Bendix-King program manager for TCAS, who was aboard
the Sabreliner.
   Systems built by Honeywell Inc. tested successfully in two
Northwest Airlines planes, according to pilot Robert G. Buley.
``For the most part, the results turned out to be more than
acceptable to the crews that will have to use the system day to
day,'' Buley said in a report for a trade publication.
   Congress has required installation of TCASII in all U.S.
airliners built to carry more than 30 passengers by the end of 1991.
   Rep. Ron Packard, R-Calif., introduced a bill last week to phase
in the installation starting with 25 percent of each airline's
fleet by the end of 1990, 50 percent a year later and the rest by
the end of 1993. It would order the Federal Aviation Administration
to analyze operation of the system in the first year in case any
changes are needed.
   But airline industry officials say they need at least until the
end of 1994 to install the systems in 4,500 domestic airliners.
More than 1,200 foreign airliners that fly U.S. skies also would be
required to have the anti-collision device.
   ``The timetable's too tight,'' said Tim Neale, spokesman for the
Air Transport Association, which represents the airline industry.
``We've got so much going on that the airlines don't feel they can
get all the planes done in that time without tremendous disruptions
in service.''
   He noted pending requirements to replace parts on aging
airliners, a law that orders installation of equipment to warn
against strong wind changes around airports, increases in air
travel and a limited number of airline mechanics to do the work.
   ``We think you need to crawl before you can run,'' Neale said,
adding that no test of the system has determined what will happen
when large numbers of airliners, all with the units filling their
cockpits with a chorus of traffic advisories, are flying in the
same area. ``You might get a domino effect,'' he said.
   Neale said the airlines support the idea of phasing in the
systems and having a one-year test period. But he said they would
oppose the bill, which is to be the subject of a congressional
hearing on Thursday, if it requires full installation by the end of
1993.
   Carriers have begun placing orders for the anti-collision system
with three manufacturers competing in a potentially $700 million
market: Allied-Signal Aerospace Co.'s Bendix-King Air Transport
Avionics Division, the Air Transport Systems Division of Honeywell
Inc., and the Collins divisions of Rockwell International.
   New orders are expected to be announced within the next few
days, according to industry sources.
   The TCASII system consists of a sophisticated transponder that
has already been installed on some aircraft, antennae, and a
computer that analyzes and displays the movement of nearby planes.
The transponder sends out a signal to other aircraft as well as
ground controllers.
   ``The system has no bugs,'' said Don Dodgen of Honeywell.
   If two computers meet, he said, orders to the pilots will be
reconciled automatically: if one plane is told to climb, the other
will be advised to descend or stay on course.
   While industry experts believe TCASII with its ``climb'' and
``descend'' commands offers enough to prevent nearly all midair
collisions, an even more complex system has been developed,
TCASIII, that also will include horizontal capabilities.
   Dodgen said that even though Honeywell is testing such a system
on an FAA airliner, it is not likely to be approved for
installation on commercial planes for several years, and then only
on models off the assembly line, since it would require major
modification for older airliners.

<HEAD>Peabody Loses Arizona Tax Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coal company seeking more than $42 million
in refunds on Arizona state taxes it paid for mining operations on
the Navajo and Hopi Indian reservations lost a Supreme Court appeal
today.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that Arizona's
transaction privilege tax properly was imposed on the Peabody Coal
Co.'s on-reservation mining.
   Lawyers for Peabody, which is based in Flagstaff, Ariz., argued
that the tax infringes on tribal sovereignty and is pre-empted by
federal law.
   State courts rejected those arguments after finding that the
taxes imposed no burden on the tribes.
   Under lease agreements, Peabody mines coal from Navajo tribal
land at the Kayenta Mine and from the Navajo-Hopi joint-use tribal
land at the Black Mesa Mine.
   Virtually all of the coal mined at the two sites is sold to
electric power consortiums under contracts that reimburse Peabody
for all state privilege taxes it pays.
   From 1970 through 1979, Peabody paid the state tax without
protest.
   But the company's lawsuit against the state and its Department
of Revenue sought refunds for taxes paid from 1980 through 1985
under protest.
   Lawyers for the coal company said that by 1986 the amount in
controversy was about $42 million. With interest, that sum has
grown.
   The case is Peabody Coal vs. Arizona, 88-1399.

   The stock market suffered a broad setback today,
faced with evidence of persistent strength in the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 18.14 points to
2,400.66 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 8 to 3 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 333 up, 896
down and 475 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 43.57 million shares at
midmorning.
   Analysts said investors were caught off guard by signs of a
pickup in business activity, as reported by the National
Association of Purchasing Management.
   The trade group said the pace of business tracked by its members
stepped up in April to a brisk pace.
   That came as unwelcome news to stock and bond traders who had
been banking on a continued slowing in the economy, in keeping with
the Federal Reserve's aim of restraining inflation.
   The news sent interest rates higher in the credit markets.
Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite
direction from interest rates, fell about $5 for each $1,000 in
face value.
   Among the blue chips, International Business Machines dropped 1
to 113[; Eastman Kodak | to 47]; Ford Motor \ to 47{, and American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph ] to 34{.
   Ogilvy Group jumped 16{ to 48{ in over-the-counter trading. WPP
Group PLC proposed a $45-a-share offer for the advertising firm,
and traders quickly began to speculate about the possibility of a
higher bid.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.98 to 172.15. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .40 at 344.68.

   The average Japanese worker's monthly wage climbed
3.6 percent after adjustment for inflation in the last fiscal year,
the highest real growth rate in 14 years, the Labor Ministry said
Monday.
   The wage rose to 343,716 yen, or $2,565, in the fiscal year

   The last time real growth in wages was higher was fiscal 1974,
when it was 5.9 percent.
   The wage figure, including twice-a-year bonuses, overtime pay
and various allowances such as housing, covers about 21 million
workers in firms with more than 30 employees.
   The official said the average number of hours worked fell 0.8
percent last year to 2,100. The Labor Ministry has set a target of
reducing annual average working hours to 1,800 by 1992.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to review a
challenge to the partial merger of Detroit's two daily newspapers.
   The justices said they will judge the validity of former
Attorney General Edwin Meese's decision to allow the newspapers to
form a joint operating agreement.
   A decision is not expected until sometime in 1990.
   The partial merger is being challenged by a group of Michigan
readers and advertisers.
   The federal Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970 law authorizes
the attorney general to give financially failing newspapers an
exemption from federal antitrust laws.
   Under the joint operating agreement, The Detroit Free Press and
The Detroit News would combine their business, advertising and
production departments but maintain separate news and editorial
staffs.
   The high court, by a 7-2 vote, cleared the way for the deal
March 20 when it set aside an earlier postponement ordered by
Justice William J. Brennan.
   Only Justices Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens voted in
March to continue the postponement. But it takes the votes of four
justices to grant review to a formal appeal.
   After the March vote, lawyers for the newspapers said they would
await the outcome of the formal appeal, which was acted on today.
   A federal appeals court panel here voted 2-1 last January to
uphold Meese's decision to allow the partial merger. The full
appeals court split 5-4 last February in refusing to review the
three-judge panel's ruling.
   Opponents to the joint operating agreement, calling themselves
Michigan Citizens for an Independent Press, contend that the Free
Press, owned by Knight-Ridder Inc., is not a failing newspaper even
though it lost $10 million a year between 1981 and 1986.
   The opponents say the Free Press and News, which lost $50
million in the same period, were unprofitable solely because both
papers cut prices in an unsuccessful effort to force each other out
of business.
   ``The losses the papers have suffered are the product of
vigorous competition,'' said the appeal acted on today.
   It contended that the Detroit deal ``threatens the independence
of papers in the 25 cities that have competing dailies, since it
provides a roadmap for profitable papers to obtain a JOA, and the
monopoly profits that can be obtained in a non-competitive market.''
   But in urging the justices to reject the challenge, Bush
administration lawyers cited the ``variety of considerations'' that
went into Meese's decision.
   ``A newspaper in another city could hardly use this case as a
guide for obtaining the attorney general's approval for a JOA,''
the government lawyers said.
   Gannett Co., which owns the News, is the nation's largest
newspaper publishing group. Knight-Ridder is the second largest.
   Knight-Ridder has said it might close the Free Press if the
joint operating agreement is not consummated.
   ``This process has been an extraordinary lesson in patience,''
Free Press Publisher David Lawrence said after the court acted
today. ``The people of the Free Press have already waited more than
three years to assure this newspaper's future.
   ``I remain confident that what is at stake is vital to the
people of Michigan, and confident that what is proposed is fully
justified.''
   News Publisher Robert Giles referred calls for comment to
Gannett headquarters in Arlington, Va., where spokeswoman Sheila
Gibbons declined comment.
   ``We're delighted,'' said David Vladeck, attorney for Public
Citizen, an advocacy group that handled the legal work on the
challenge to the business agreement.
   Public Citizen had not only argued the agreement would threaten
newspaper competition in other cities but that a lower court's
ruling had set precedents for administrative law that would greatly
restrict judicial review of executive actions.
   ``I suspect that the fact that this case presented both issues
made it doubly appealing to the court,'' Vladeck said.
   Under the 100-year agreement, the News would receive 55 percent
of the merged company's profits during the first year but that
percentage would drop to 50 percent by the seventh year.
   Thereafter, the profits would be evenly divided.
   The case is Michigan Citizens For an Independent Press vs.
Thornburgh, 88-1640.

<TEXT>
   Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade Inc. has reached a
definitive agreement with Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Inc. to have
some of its ice cream made at Dreyer's Indiana plant, the companies
announced Monday.
   James Miller, general manager for Ben &amp; Jerry's, said the
company has exhausted its capacity and that demand for the ice
cream is far outstripping supply. He said the company is not
interested in building a third plant in the state right now.
   Under a three-year agreement, Dreyer's will manufacture Ben &amp;
Jerry's products at Dreyers' Fort Wayne, Ind., plant using Vermont
dairy products.
   Dreyer's, an Oakland-Calif.-based company, makes and distributes
ice cream and other dairy-based products, including Ben &amp; Jerry's
in Midwest and West Coast markets.
   By 1992, Miller said, about 3.5 million gallons of ice cream
will be produced in Indiana; the Waterbury-based company currently
sells 5 million gallons annually, and projects it will be selling 8
million gallons a year by 1992.
   The company currently operates two Vermont plants, one in
Waterbury and one in Springfield. The Waterbury plant, built in
1985, produces ice cream in pint packages and bulk ice cream for
franchise shops. The Springfield plant makes ice cream novelties.
   Miller said it would not be economically feasible for the
company to convert parts of the plant for producing pints.
   Since partners Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield opened shop in an
old filling station in Burlington in 1978, Ben &amp; Jerry's has grown
into a $40 million corporation.
   Miller said the company is not moving any of its Vermont
operations to Indiana. The decision reflects the current limits of
both its factory and management staff, he said.
   ``Because of our rapid growth, we didn't have the strength up
and down our management to take on another plant,'' he said.
Mnaufacturing staff at the new plant will be Dreyers' employees, he
said, but quality control staff will be hired by Ben &amp; Jerry's.
   The new arrangement will also help Ben &amp; Jerry's' marketing
strategy, enabling the company to move more easily into major
markets west of the Mississippi, especially California.

   A sharply divided Supreme Court ruled today
the burden is on employers to disprove sexual stereotyping when
they are accused of discriminating against women.
   By a 6-3 vote, the justices ordered further lower court hearings
in a suit against the accounting firm Price Waterhouse by Ann
Hopkins, who said she was denied a partnership because of ``macho''
attitudes that she did not behave sufficiently ladylike.
   Today's ruling also is a partial victory for Price Waterhouse.
The court overturned a lower court ruling that would have placed an
even heavier burden of proof on the company.
   Moreover, only four of the justices agreed on the standards that
should govern lawsuits alleging sexual stereoptyping.
   The absence of a court majority enunciating clear guidelines is
likely to sow confusion among lower courts when deciding such cases.
   Justice William J. Brennan, in the court's main opinion, said
when someone ``proves that her gender played a motivating part in
an employment decision, the defendant may avoid a finding of
liability only by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that
it would have made the same decision even if it had not taken the
plantiff's gender into account.''
   Joining his opinion were Justices Thurgood Marshall, John Paul
Stevens and Harry A. Blackmun.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, in a separate concurring opinion,
agreed that in the case of Price Waterhouse, ``the burden of
persuasion should shift to the employer to demonstrate by a
preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same
decision concerning Ann Hopkins' candidacy absent consideration of
her gender.''
   But O'Connor said she does not favor ``the strong medicine'' of
forcing employers to bear the burden of proof in all such cases.
   Justice Byron R. White also concurred in today's result. But in
a separate opinion he said he would not require an employer to
submit ``objective evidence'' to disprove sexual bias in such cases.
   As long as ``the employer credibly testifies that the action
would have been taken for legitimate reasons alone, this should be
ample proof,'' White said.
   The three dissenters are Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy. They voted to kill
Ms. Hopkins' suit.
   Kennedy, in his opinion for the three, said there was ample
evidence that Price Waterhouse did not discriminate against her
intentionally.
   Ms. Hopkins quit Price Waterhouse, one of the nation's so-called
``Big Eight'' accounting firms, after she was denied promotion to
partnership in 1983 _ a move that would have made her a part owner.
   She later became a consultant to the World Bank.
   In other actions today, the Supreme Court:
   _Agreed to review a challenge to review to the partial merger of
Detroit's two daily newspapers. The justices said they will judge
the validity of former Attorney General Edwin Meese's decision to
allow the newspapers to form a joint operating agreement.
   _Agreed to hear a Bush administration apeal aimed at allowing
the government to collect potentially hundreds of millions of
dollars in taxes from multinational corporations.
   _Refused to hear an appeal by Hawaii officials seeking to
recover from asbestos manufacturers the cost of removing the
product from public schools in the state.
   In the sex bias case, Ms. Hopkins had joined Price Waterhouse in
1978 and was nominated for parntership in 1982, the only woman
among 88 candidates for partnership that year.
   She had been very successful in getting business for the
company, winning government contracts worth between $34 million and
$44 million.
   Both her critics and supporters at Price Watershouse said she
sometimes was overly agreessive, too harsh, impatient with her
staff and very demanding.
   One critic suggested she needed to take a ``course at charm
school.''
   A partner who supported her for promotion told her she would
stand a better chance of getting ahead if she would ``walk more
femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear
make-up, have her hair styled and wear jewelry.''
   Ms. Hopkins sued Price Waterhouse on grounds it violated Title
VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibiting on-the-job
discrimination. She said sexual stereotyping, unconscious or
otherwise, cost her a partnership.
   Professinal partnerships are covered by the 1964 law under a
1984 Supreme Court ruling.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled in 1987 that while
there appeared to be mixed motives in denying Ms. Hopkins a
partnership, Price Waterhouse was unable to prove that
``impermissible bias was not the determinative factor'' for the
decision.
   The appeals court said an employer must show by ``clear and
convincing evidence'' they did not practice bias.
   The Supreme Court today did not go that far.
   The ``clear and convincing'' standard usually means that to
successfully defend against a lawsuit, a company must show that the
overwhelming evidence is in its favor.
   By contrast, the ``preponderance'' standard adopted today means
Price Waterhouse can win if it can show more than half the evidence
is in its favor.
   The case is Price Waterhouse vs. Hopkins, 87-1167.

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened mostly
higher today on the Chicago Board of Trade in the wake of forecasts
for below-average rainfall during the next three months.
   The National Weather Service's 30- to 90-day forecast released
Friday predicts most western crop areas, including western
Illinois, Missouri, Iowa and Minnesota, will be drier than normal
through July.
   Wheat prices opened lower as uncertainty continues over the Bush
administration's position on continuing subsidized grain sales to
foreign countries.
   Today is a holiday in most of the world, and that could slow
trading in the pits.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent lower to { cent higher with
the contract for delivery in May at $4.17\ a bushel; corn was 2\
cents to 3} cents higher with May at $2.72{ a bushel; oats were 1}
cents to 2{ cents higher with May at $1.80{ a bushel; soybeans were
5 cents to 7} cents with May at $7.27 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercaantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .07 cent to .27 cent higher with June at 71.72

<TEXT>
   Some of the people getting nearly
$17 an hour to mop up the largest oil spill in U.S. history are
unhappy with how the mess is being handled and 20 quit their jobs.
   ``We don't even know who our supervisors are,'' said Chris
Christoffersen, who had been staying aboard the USS Juneau.
   The vessel serves as a floating hotel for the more than 300
clean-up workers laboring _ sometimes one rock at a time _ to get
oil off Smith Island's once-picturesque shoreline.
   Christoffersen was one of 20 workers taken back to Valdez during
the weekend after quitting. As they lined up to leave, new workers
arrived.
   Valdez has been the center of the cleanup since March 24, when
the Exxon Valdez went aground in Prince William Sound and spilled
more than 10 million gallons of crude.
   The oil, which has spread across hundreds of square miles,
during the weekend reached the beaches of Katmai National Park, a
brown bear refuge about 275 miles southwest of Valdez.
   Authorities said today they are shifting a large clean-up dredge
southward from Prince William Sound to follow the drifting oil.
They also plan to bring in high-powered warm-water guns to cleanse
the rugged shoreline.
   ``Over the last two days ... we've discovered a very large
amount of oil debris inside of Shelikof Straits,'' park
superintendent Ray Bane said. The 30-mile-wide strait lies between
Kodiak Island and the Alaska Peninsula.
   ``The impact stretches from Shaw Island, on the north side of
Cape Douglas, all the way to our southern boundary, and now we've
had reports it's been found in Wild Bay, south of us,'' Bane said.
   Today was the deadline for Exxon to provide the state with a
plan for waste disposal and the cleaning of Gulf of Alaska
shorelines.
   ``We want to see a documented plan, a well-documented plan, with
the equipment and people, showing how they are going to dispose of
that oil,'' said Barbara Holian, spokeswoman for the Alaska
Department of Environmental Conservation. ``We want to know what
they are going to do with that oily waste.''
   ``There is some talk of using a hazardous waste incinerator on a
barge brought up from Washington,'' she said. ``There are different
kinds of incinerators and a hazardous waste incinerator has more
safeguards built into it. ... We are trying to safeguard the air
quality.''
   Meantime, some people like Christoffersen are getting fed up
with what they see as an exercise in futility. He also said people
are getting bored by being stuck on the ship.
   An Exxon official said any mistakes or confusion were a natural
part of getting the vessel into operation.
   The Juneau, a 569-foot amphibious dock landing ship armed with
guns 3 inches in diameter, is anchored at an estimated cost of
$150,000 a day.
   The Navy ship arrived last week with more than 1,000 crew and
workers aboard. Operations started Thursday, but fizzled Friday
when seas rose to 7 feet and winds were to 38 mph. Work resumed
Saturday.
   Several workers remained aboard, unable to go ashore for lack of
equipment. One group that labeled itself ``The Forgotten 14'' had
not worked since Wednesday.
   The workers spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``They said they would fire us,'' said a 25-year-old fishing
guide.
   He and the others said they were being paid overtime at $25 an
hour Saturday to do nothing. ``We get paid the same as the people
out there working.''
   ``I'm here because I don't know if I'll have a fishing season,''
he said. ``I thought I'd get my money now. I don't know where my
fish are.''
   Others complained about the lack of activity.
   ``At first, the days started out like weeks and now they're like
years,'' said one worker.
   The Juneau's captain, Ted Willandt, said that after the first
day, Exxon reported a section of beach measuring 300-by-45 feet was
about 30 percent cleaned.``They have to go over it at least two
more times to get it clean,'' Willandt said.
   The company has promised to clean 300 miles of coastline within
Prince William Sound by Sept. 15.
   Workers are putting in 12-hour days, working 14 days and getting
seven off, Exxon's Victor Blanco said from his office aboard a
barge tied alongside the Juneau.
   Blanco, who is heading the Smith Island effort, attributed the
complaints to startup problems.
   ``It was hard the first day. The conditions out here are
tough,'' he said. ``It's tough work.
   He said Exxon was trying to make the crews happy aboard ship. He
said in addition to televisions, the company planned a free store
and had paid for double rations of food.
   ``To have happy campers, you have to feed them well,'' he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to hear
Eastman Kodak Co.'s appeal of a federal court ruling that the
company infringed on instant film and camera patents held by
Polaroid Corp.
   Kodak argued that the 1985 ruling should be thrown out because
U.S. District Judge Rya Zobel, who presided over the trial, had a
conflict of interest in the case.
   A federal appeals court that earlier heard Kodak's appeal noted
that Zobel announced to both companies in 1981 that her
mother-in-law owned Kodak shares and that Kodak raised no
objection. The appeals court said that it was not until 1988, well
after Zobel's liability ruling against Kodak, that the company
objected.
   Since the Supreme Court refuses to hear the case, the federal
appeal's court ruling against Kodak is the final word.
   In Boston, opening arguments began today in the trial to
determine the damages Kodak must pay Polaroid.
   By copying Polaroid's technology, Kodak forced its rival to sell
some cameras below cost and enormously damaged the instant
photography market, Polaroid lawyers said.
   The trial before Judge A. David Mazzone in U.S. District Court
is expected by many securities analysts to result in Kodak paying
Polaroid about $1 billion, which would be the largest patent damage
award in history.
   The trial is expected to take four to six months.
   ``You start talking and I'll start listening, and as the famous
saying goes, I hope you finish before I do,'' Mazzone told the
Kodak and Polaroid lawyers.
   Polaroid attorney Herbert F. Schwartz argued that Polaroid was
entitled to $3.9 billion in lost profits because of Kodak's sales
of instant cameras and film between 1976 and 1986.
   In addition, Schwartz argued that Polaroid is entitled to
interest and triple punitive damages, bringing the total to just
under $12 billion.
   In a previous trial, a judge ruled in October 1985 that Kodak
had violated seven of Polaroid's key patents on instant film and
cameras _ and booted Kodak out of the instant photography business,
saddling it with $600 million of losses and an estimated $200
million worth of useless manufacturing equipment.
   The only issue in the current trial is the value of the damage
caused by Kodak.
   Rochester, N.Y.-based Kodak argues that the most Polaroid should
get is $177 million, representing a 5 percent royalty on all the
instant film and cameras that Kodak sold from 1976 to 1986.
   Lawyers said the record award in a patent infringement lawsuit
was approximately $200 million that Hughes Tool Co. received from
Dresser Industries in 1986.
   A multibillion-dollar verdict could force Kodak to make layoffs,
take on huge debt and sell subsidiaries to raise cash. It could
leave the company unable to make the investments it needs to
compete with Japanese film makers.
   If the award is near the top of the possible range, it could
even force Kodak into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, just as Texaco Inc.
was forced to reorganize when a jury ordered it to pay $10.3
billion to Pennzoil Co. four years ago. Texaco emerged from Chapter
11 a year ago after paying Pennzoil $3 billion in cash to settle
the case.
   But securities analysts say a Chapter 11 filing is unlikely.
Most Wall Street brokerage houses are predicting an award of about
$1 billion, and traders say the stock prices of both companies
already reflect that expectation.
   ``We're not going to see another Texaco here,'' said Peter
Enderlin, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   Polaroid, which recently spent $1.1 billion to buy back stock
and fend off a hostile takeover by Shamrock Holdings Inc., is
expected to use part of any award to lower its corporate debt.
   Alex Henderson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., said he reckoned Polaroid's stock price probably will rise or
fall about $1 for every $100 million of the award that is above or
below Wall Street's expectations.

<HEAD>OPEC Expected To Raise Output</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC is expected to raise its production
quota in June to help return bloated prices to the cartel's
$18-a-barrel target level, Iraq's oil minister said Monday.
   The Middle East Economic Survey quoted Issam Abdul-Rahim
al-Chalabi as saying that an increase in the output ceiling should
end overproduction by some of the organization's 13 members.
   Chalabi said that the increase is expected to be formalized at a
June meeting of OPEC ministers and take effect in the second half
of the year. A new output level has not been decided, the minister
said. However, industry observers expect an increase of about 1.5
million barrels a day.
   Last November, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
set a production quota of 18.5 million barrels a day in an effort
to raise world oil prices, which had fallen to $10 to $12 a barrel.
At the time, the cartel was producing in excess of 22 million
barrels, far more than the market could absorb.
   Since then, oil prices have nearly doubled, although several
OPEC members are producing above their quotas, putting the cartel
above its self-imposed limit. OPEC does not want to see prices too
high lest they encourage non-OPEC producers to increase production.
   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have both demanded higher
quotas and the U.A.E. has consistantly been overproducing since
November, oil sources have reported.
   Chalabi warned, however, that there could be no going back on
the principle of equal quotas for Iraq and Iran which fought an
eight-year war ending in cease-fire last August. He said Iraq will
not even discuss the matter.
   ``We watch very closely whatever production figures come out of
Iran,'' he said.
   ``If in actual terms there is going to be any production
increase or quota violation by Iran, then that will be treated
differently by Iraq.''
   Chalabi said Iraq's current refining capacity is 600,000 barels
a day and internal consumption is running at about 300,000 barrels
a day.

<TEXT>
   Voters' rejection of Gov. Buddy Roemer's
tax plan will mean the likely closures of hospitals and
universities and the layoffs of thousands of state employees, the
governor said today.
   ``We don't have all the specifics yet. We'll let you know as
soon as we can,'' an obviously weary Roemer told reporters at an
impromptu news conference.
   The governor was closeted late into the night Sunday with
advisers to decide how to approach a budget that is now $700
million short of balance for the new fiscal year beginning July 1.
   Voters on Saturday rejected the plan by 55 percent to 45
percent, according to unofficial returns.
   Roemer, who traveled around the state for six weeks trying to to
sell the plan, faces questions about his political future just 13
months after he took office as a reformer promising a ``new
Louisiana.''
   ``I'm not worried about that. I'm concerned about this state,''
Roemer said, fielding questions on the Capitol steps. ``There will
be a referendum on Buddy Roemer in 2{ years.''
   Roemer's plan would have shifted the tax burden away from big
business, putting more of a load on individuals through the income
tax. It would have reduced sales taxes and given businesses
incentives to move to Louisiana and expand.
   The plan also included a $1.4 billion program to improve
highways, airports and shipping ports, funded by a gasoline tax
increase of 4 cents a gallon.
   Roemer touted his plan as a way to bring jobs to Louisiana,
which has the nation's highest unemployment rate at 9.6 percent,
and to end the state's dependence on the oil industry.
   The oil, gas and chemical industry paid more than half of the
state taxes for nearly 50 years until its collapse in 1982.
   Since then, state government has hovered near bankruptcy.
   ``I never worked harder in my life to try to turn this around,''
the Democratic governor said. ``We're going to keep building, but
not as fast as I wanted to.''
   ``This plan will tell America that we've changed, that we're
ready to pay our way,'' Roemer said repeatedly during his trips
around the state.
   Opponents condemned it as nothing more than a huge tax increase
and said Roemer had not reduced spending as promised during his
1987 campaign, when he unseated Edwin Edwards.
   Rep. David Duke, an outspoken critic of the plan, said its
defeat was ``going to make a real change in Louisiana.'' He called
on Roemer to work with legislators in tightening spending and
making major changes in its welfare programs.
   Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader elected as a Republican to a
suburban New Orleans seat on an anti-tax plank in February,
compared the referendum's outcome to his own victory. ``Every day
that passes, I'm more and more in awe of the intelligence and the
good sense in our state,'' he said.
   Even with passage of the plan, the Legislature would have been
forced to cut spending by $200 million to keep the budget balanced.
   Roemer met all day Sunday with his closest advisers on how to
cut the budget.
   ``The people want closures. I really believe that,'' Rep. Robert
Adley, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said as he
left the meeting at the governor's mansion. ``They sent us a signal
that we haven't done enough.
   ``It could be from one to several universities or more.
Hospitals could be from three to five,'' the Democrat said. ``Right
now we're trying to find every way in the world that a degree of
services can be rendered.''
   Louisiana has 18 public universities and eight charity hospitals.
   ``The people sent a signal that they want more cuts,'' added
Steve Cochran, Roemer's chief of staff. ``I'm not sure what goes
through the minds of citizens when they think of budget cuts. They
think of waste, of extras. Unfortunately, to live within the
limitations set here, we'll probably have to do more than the
average citizen expects.''
   Cochran said thousands of the state's 80,000 employees likely
would lose their jobs. The administration would determine within a
week all specific cuts, he said.
   ``When you close institutions, that means people lose jobs,'' he
said.
   As for Roemer's political future, political consultant and
pollster Ed Renwick of Loyola University said the governor was
``badly wounded, but not critically wounded.''
   Silas Lee, a Loyola University political scientist, said,
``Roemer couldn't sell his plan to blue-collar whites, many of whom
think David Duke is on the ball, and he couldn't sell it to blacks,
who didn't think there would really be thousands of jobs for them.''

<TEXT>
   The oil and gas rig count continued its seesaw
pattern, dropping by 16 this week to total 751, Baker Hughes Inc.
reported.
   Last week, the number of working oil and gas rigs had increased
by nine to 767, the company said Monday. A year ago, the count
totaled 880.
   Baker Hughes' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively
producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Oklahoma was the big loser
this week with its count dropping by 14. Last week, Oklahoma's
count had increased by 11.
   Texas, North Dakota and Kansas each lost two rigs, while
Colorado, New Mexico and Louisiana all lost one.
   California's count increased by five, Ohio gained two and
Wyoming's rig count increased by one.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction spending, hit by a sharp drop in
the highway category, suffered its third consecutive monthly
decline in March, the first time building activity has shown such
weakness since just before the last recession, the government said
Monday.
   The Commerce Department said that spending on public and private
building projects declined by 0.3 percent in March, following even
larger declines of 0.8 percent in February and 0.7 percent in
January.
   The February decline represented a sharp revision from the
original report a month ago, when the government had reported that
construction spending was unchanged from the January level.
   The three consecutive declines pushed activity down to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $413.5 billion.
   It marked the longest string of setbacks since five months of
declines from February through June of 1981, right before the start
of the 1981-82 recession.
   Construction, because of its sensitivity to high interest rates,
has often been one of the sectors leading the country into a
downturn.
   Michael Sumichrast, an economist and publisher of a construction
newsletter, said that history could well repeat itself unless the
Federal Reserve soon relents and stops pushing interest rates up in
an effort to fight inflation.
   Economists have been looking for building activity to be weak
this year because of the Fed's campaign to push interest rates
higher as a way of fighting inflation by dampening economic
activity.
   ``There is no strength anywhere in construction,'' Sumichrast
said. ``We have problems with overbuilding, high interest rates and
a sharp run-up in prices of single-family homes.''
   The weakness in March resulted from a 9.1 percent plunge in
public construction, which fell to an annual rate of $74.1 billion.
Much of that decline reflected an 18.8 percent drop in spending for
highways and streets, the biggest government category.
   Construction of new housing units was down as well, dropping 1.4
percent to an annual rate of $143.3 billion. Spending on
single-family homes fell by 1.7 percent to an annual rate of $120.1
billion while multi-family construction was up 0.9 percent to a
rate of $23.3 billion.
   Non-residential construction rose by 4.1 percent to an annual
rate of $101.9 billion, reflecting strength in factory
construction, which surged by 12.1 percent and hotel construction,
which was up 7 percent.
   But Sumichrast said he believed this was a temporary spurt in
activity. For the year as a whole, he predicted that construction
in the non-residential category would drop by about 6 percent from
the 1988 level, led by continued weakness in office construction.

<HEAD>Wall: Thrift Industry Not Ready To Die</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny
Wall said Monday that reports of the savings and loan industry's
death have been greatly exaggerated.
   ``Don't get caught up that the industry is some sort of a
dinosaur,'' he told the Society of American Business Editors and
Writers. ``The industry is doing well within the healthy sector.''
   Speaking in typical optimistic fashion, Wall said that 88
percent of the nation's 3,000 S&amp;Ls, representing 92 percent of the
industy's assets, are considered solvent, and Congress is working
to dispose of the rest.
   Troubled thrifts accounted for the bulk of the $12.1 billion in
industrywide losses in 1988, with Texas institutions again emerging
as the biggest losers.
   ``The future of the industry is being made ever clear ... as
legislative discussion continues,'' Wall said. ``Congress continues
to be supportive of the thrift industry and in its purpose.''
   He said that he expected a thrift bailout bill to pass through
Congress by mid-June.
   Last week, the Senate overwhelmingly approved a record $157
billion bailout and reform bill for the S&amp;L industry after
toughening provisions that would require S&amp;L owners to put more of
their own money at risk to stay in business. Similar S&amp;L
legislation is pending in the House.

   Peter L. Scott, the chairman, president and
chief executive officer of Emhart Corp., on Monday was named
chairman of Black &amp; Decker Corp., which completed a tender offer
for Emhart last Friday.
   Achim Knust, Emhart's executive vice president and chief
financial officer, will hold the same positions at Black &amp; Decker,
the power tool maker said. Nolan D. Archibald will continue as
president and chief executive officer of Black &amp; Decker.
   Three other executive vice presidents will be Raymond A. DeVita
of Emhart and Dennis G. Heiner and George M. Sherman, both already
with Black &amp; Decker.
   ``As a team, they combine the best of Black &amp; Decker and the
best of Emhart,'' Archibald said. ``The expertise of these leaders
and the continuity of their leadership not only will help ensure a
smooth transition as we combine the two companies, but also will
provide a competitive advantage in our businesses.''
   Emhart, of Hartford, Conn., agreed to be acquired by Black &amp;
Decker, which is based in the Baltimore suburb of Towson, for $2.8
billion.

<HEAD>Justices Reject Challenge to Dallas Cable System</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today turned away a cable
television dispute from Dallas, in which the city was held liable
for violating the free-speech rights of a non-franchised company.
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear the city's appeal
in a case still pending in a federal trial court.
   Video International Productions Inc. (VIP) sued the city and
Warner-Amex Cable Communications Inc., the sole franchised cable TV
company in Dallas, for allegedly trying to put VIP out of business.
   A federal court jury awarded VIP $4.4 million in damages, but
major portions of that judgment were overturned by the presiding
judge.
   U.S. District Judge Sidney Fitzwater threw out all claims
against Warner-Amex and claims that the city had interfered
improperly with a contract to sell VIP.
   But the judge upheld the jury's findings that the city violated
VIP's free-speech rights and federal antitrust law. He also ruled
that the city was immune from punitive damages.
   In all, the dollar amount of VIP's legal victory was cut to
$200,000.
   Both VIP and Dallas city officials appealed, and the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals last Oct. 31 ruled that the city was
legally liable to VIP.
   But the appeals court sent the dispute back to Fitzwater for a
new trial on the amount of damages to be paid.
   ``We are unable to discern a reasonable explanation for the
jury's wide-ranging verdicts,'' the appeals court said.
   The case is Dallas vs. Video International Productions, 88-1488.

<DATELINE>SOMERS POINT, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The national chain of Chi-Chi's
Mexican restaurants is suing a local eatery named Chi Chi's that
specializes in crab imperial, not tacos.
   The small-town Chi Chi's _ without a hyphen in between _ was
named in 1968 after the nickname of the previous owner's wife.
Chi-Chi's Inc., a chain of 190 Mexican restaurants headquartered in
Louisville, Ky., opened its first restaurant in Minneapolis in 1976.
   ``We are just a family operation,'' said Jack Bittner, the new
owner who operates the landmark Somers Point restaurant with his
wife, Jillian. ``They're a national company telling little old us
that we can't use the name that we had long before they ever came
along.''
   Bittner's attorney, Allen Vernon of Ocean City, will not say
whether Chi Chi's in Somers Point ever trademarked its name. He
said, however, that he is confident his clients will be successful
when their case comes to U.S. District Court in Camden in July.
   ``We have a long-standing prior uninterrupted use of the name,''
he said Monday.
   But the attorney representing Chi-Chi's Inc., James Rothschild
of Morristown, said, ``There is precedent supporting us.''
   In its lawsuit, Chi-Chi's Inc. claims that the Bittners' use of
the name is ``calculated to confuse, mislead, deceive and
perpetrate a fraud upon the public in New Jersey.''
   The Kentucky company has three restaurants in the state.
Chi-Chi's Inc. seeks to have the Bittners barred from using the
name and made to pay damages.
   ``We have a substantial national chain that has built a
tremendous amount of good will and we feel it's wrong for them to
utilize our name,'' Rothschild said.

<HEAD>Highway Safety Experted cited for contempt in release of documents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national highway safety expert was cited for
contempt for releasing documents about General Motors Corp. crash
tests that had been sealed in Milwaukee County Circuit Court.
   Circuit Judge Francis T. Wasielewski has ordered that David Biss
pay a $2,000 fine for releasing the documents to the ABC television
network's ``20-20'' news show.
   The judge last week ordered that the money be paid to the
emergency trauma center at the Milwaukee County Medical Complex.
   Biss formerly was an official with the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration and now is a private consultant. He was hired
as an expert by lawyers representing a man from Monroe, Wis., who
is seeking unspecified damages from GM in a November 1985 car
accident that left him a quadriplegic.
   The accident victim, David B. McGuire, says he was seated in the
center of the back seat of a 1981 Chevrolet Chevette when the car
collided head-on with a pickup truck on Wisconsin 69 in Dane County.
   McGuire says he was injured when he was thrust into the front of
the car, which was equipped with only two rear seat belts.
   His lawsuit, scheduled to go to trial Oct. 9, contends that, if
he had had a seat belt, he would not have been injured.
   Biss admitted that he turned over to a producer for the ABC news
program last summer an internal document from GM that was under a
protective court seal.
   As an expert witness in the McGuire trial, Biss was allowed to
view the document during the period in which lawyers gather
information from the other side.
   The document contained the results of a 1976 test by GM that it
said showed that passengers strapped in rear lap belts undergo four
times the force required to cause serious injury in head-on
collisions.
   The ``20-20'' program used the document in a July 1988 broadcast
in which it said GM and other automakers failed to install shoulder
belts in the back seats of automobiles, even though the companies
knew that shoulder belts were safer than lap belts alone.

   The Supreme Court's decision Monday to review
the partial merger of two Detroit newspapers will force
Knight-Ridder Inc. to determine how much longer it can absorb
losses from its Detroit Free Press, analysts said.
   By agreeing to hear arguments on the proposed joint operating
agreement (JOA), the court set the stage for its first review of
the 19-year-old Newspaper Preservation Act. A decision is not
expected until next year.
   The Detroit News, owned by Gannett Co. Inc., and the Free Press
agreed in 1986 to merge the newspapers' production, circulation and
business operations and to split profits and losses equally for
most of the 100-year arrangement.
   Knight-Ridder's president and chief executive officer, James K.
Battn, said the organization would plan over the coming days what
to do next.
   Batten said Knight-Ridder continues ``to believe strongly in the
fairness and justice of our case on behalf of a JOA in Detroit.''
   Gannett, through spokeswoman Sheila Gibbons, said it was
``reviewing the decision'' and would have no further comment.
   Both newspapers have been losing money for years, and
Knight-Ridder has said it will close the smaller Free Press unless
the partial merger goes through.
   ``Knight-Ridder's decision would be based upon its reading of
the length of time and the likelihood ... of this thing
happening,'' said John S. Reidy, communications industry analyst
with the New York brokerage house Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   ``Clearly, from their point of view, they would like to
eliminate the cash drain of the Free Press. ... On the other hand,
if they wait it out, then they'll have half interest in a JOA,
which will earn considerably more for them than the loss last year.
So it is a tough decision,'' Reidy said.
   The Free Press lost $18.5 million in 1988, Knight-Ridder said in
court filings earlier this year. Gannett has released no annual
loss figures for the News, but Knight-Ridder in testimony has
estimated the News' losses at $75 million from 1979 through 1987.
   The newspapers have said closing the Free Press would cost 2,200
jobs while a joint operating agreement would mean a total of 600 to
800 jobs lost at the two papers.
   Free Press employees at a staff meeting took news of the Supreme
Court's decision with a calm patience.
   ``We've been punched around so many times. It's like, okay,
we'll waltz with it again,'' said Neal Rubin, a feature writer.
   The partial merger, designed to retain newspaper competition
through an exemption to federal antitrust laws, was approved by the
Justice Department last year but was tied up by court challenges
from an organization of newspaper readers and advertisers, Michigan
Citizens for an Independent Press, and the Washington-based
advocacy group Public Citizen.
   They argued that the newspapers' losses resulted from management
decisions rather than being inherent in the Detroit media market
and that if the deal were approved, any well-off newspaper
publishing group could deliberately create conditions for an
antitrust exemption.
   Bush administration attorneys countered that a ``variety of
considerations'' had been behind the Justice Department's decision.
``A newspaper in another city could hardly use this case as a guide
for obtaining the attorney general's approval for a JOA,'' the
government lawyers said.
   William Schultz, a lawyer for Public Citizen, predicted
far-reaching results from the court's decision to hear arguments.
   ``It is the first test the court has heard under the Newspaper
Preservation Act. It is likely it will decide the meaning of the
act and the scope of the act for the future,'' Schultz said.
   A federal appeals court panel in Washington voted 2-1 in January
to uphold the Justice Department's decision to allow the partial
merger. The full appeals court then split 5-4 in February in
refusing to review the three-judge panel's ruling.
   The Supreme Court, by a 7-2 vote, cleared the way for the deal
March 20 when it set aside an earlier postponement ordered by
Justice William J. Brennan.
   Only Justices Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens voted in
March to continue the postponement; the votes of four justices are
needed to grant review to a formal appeal.
   When the court's stay was lifted, Knight-Ridder proposed
proceeding with the partial merger. Gannett declined to do so.
   No stay is in effect, and the newspapers would have the option
of merging while awaiting the Supreme Court's decision on the case.
   Gannett, based in Arlington, Va., is the nation's largest
newspaper publishing group. Knight-Ridder, headquartered in Miami,
is the second largest.

   That came as unwelcome news to stock and bond traders who had
been banking on a continued slowing in the economy, in keeping with
the Federal Reserve's aim of restraining inflation.
   The news sent interest rates higher in the credit markets.
Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite

   Grain and soybean futures prices rose strongly
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to long-range
forecasts of below-average rainfall in several grain-producing
states.
   The National Weather Service on Friday released 30- and 90-day
forecasts that predicted a return to dry conditions in the western
half of the Farm Belt, including Iowa and Illinois.
   The forecasts fueled talk of a return of drought conditions,
pushing up prices across the board.
   ``It was a very typical weather-related price movement,'' said
Ted Mao, a grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New
York. ``There is a lot of uncertainty in the market, and the market
should reflect that uncertainty into the summer.''
   Wheat was strong because of severe weather conditions, and
despite continued uncertainty over the Bush administration's
position on continuing subsidized grain sales to foreign countries.
   Prices were helped by rumors that the Bush administration could
make a decision soon that would allow the Soviet Union to purchase
up to 3 million metric tons of grain.
   At the close, wheat was 4 cents to 6\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.23} a bushel; corn was 4\ cents
to 5} cents higher with May at $2.74 a bushel; oats were 4 cents to
6} cents higher with May at $1.84{ a bushel; soybeans were 12{

   G. Heileman Brewing Co. is being
reorganized into four distinct divisions, a move a company
spokesmen said Monday will allow the brewery to capitalize on its
regional strengths.
   The reorganization is based on geography, with the four
divisions being East, Midwest, Texas and West. The divisional
presidents will report to Murray Cutbush, president and chief
operating officer of Heileman, who will remain in La Crosse.
   Cutbush said the brewery's new structure ``will allow the
company to further develop and intensify the strategy that has made
the G. Heileman Brewing Co. the nation's premiere regional brewer.''
   Cutbush added: ``Our involvement with the local community and
our local network of wholesalers in each region will be increased.
This certainly strengthens our position entering the peak summer
selling season and will enable us to aggressively pursue regional
marketing and sales opportunities.''

<HEAD>Arco Profit Up 76 Percent On Gains From Lyondell Stock Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atlantic Richfield Co. said Monday its profit
rose 76 percent in the first quarter, due largely to gains from the
sale of a half interest in its Lyondell Petrochemical Co.
   Without that gain and other one-time charges against earnings,
net income in the quarter would have risen only 3.5 percent, said
Lodwrick M. Cook, Arco's chairman and chief executive officer.
   For the three-month period ended March 31, Arco's net earnings
totaled $704 million, or $4 per share, up from $401 million, or
$2.20 a share, in the first quarter of 1988. Revenue fell to $3.96
billion, down 14 percent from $4.61 billion a year earlier.
   The results included a $634 million after-tax gain from the sale
of 53.75 percent interest in Lyondell in January.
   Cook, who reported the results at the company's annual
shareholders meeting, said that discounting one-time gains and
charges, profit would have been $415 million.
   The gains were partially offset by $345 in after-tax charges for
unspecified environmental expenses, anticipated losses on the
planned sale of Arco Solar Inc. and a charge related to the sale of
the company's aluminum operation in 1985.
   Cook also said that the March oil spill in Alaska, which forced
a temporary halt to shipments from the port of Valdez, cost the
company about $10 million after taxes.
   Arco spokesman Albert Greenstein said the loss stemmed from a
combination of reduced production and lower oil flow through the
Alaska pipeline over a 12-day period after the March 24 spill.
   ``About 3.2 million barrels net to Arco was not delivered,''
said Albert Greenstein. ``So when you look at reduced deliveries to
Arco and reduced production _ we had to reduce production in one of
our refineries _ the overall after-tax loss was $10 million. Most
of that relates to loss of delivered crude.''

   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the

<HEAD>Dollar Strengthens As Intervention Has Little Impact</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Most European financial markets were closed Monday for a holiday.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar wound up higher against all major
currencies in a thin market Monday as an unexpectedly strong
economic assessment from the nation's purchasing managers triggered
buying.
   Gold prices barely budged. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a bid of $377.45 for a troy ounce of gold at 4 p.m. EDT, 5
cents lower than Friday's late bid.
   Victor Polce, a vice president at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., said
intervention by a few central banks had little lasting effect on
the dollar's movement.
   Trading volume was light in the United States. Most major
European financial markets were closed for a holiday. Individual
transactions have more of an impact on exchange rates in a market
in which relatively fewer trades are taking place.
   Foreign exchange dealers attributed part of the dollar's
strength to a monthly survey by the National Association of
Purchasing Management, which suggested economic growth regained
momentum in April.
   The purchasing managers' index, which measures new orders,
production, vendor deliveries, inventory and employment, went up to
53 percent in April after falling to 50.4 percent in March. Last
month's growth rate was roughly the same as the first quarter's
pace.
   An implication of the purchasing managers' survey was that
economic activity may not be slowing enough to induce the Federal
Reserve to ease its grip on credit. This would mean interest rates
would remain at current levels.
   Rising interest rates in the United States this year have
enhanced the appeal of dollar-denominated investments.
   Here are late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's
late rates: 134.125 Japanse yen, up from 133.05; 1.89065 West
German marks, up from 1.8810; 1.6870 Swiss francs, up from 1.6755;
6.375 French francs, up from 6.3580; 1,383.25 Italian lire, up from
1,377.00; and 1.18725 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1853.
   The dollar strengthened against the British pound in New York
trading. Sterling was quoted at $1.6798, less expensive for buyers
than Friday's late rate of $1.6855.
   Gold prices were little changed in U.S. dealings. There were no
quotes available from overseas.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery edged up to $378.20 a troy ounce from Friday's settlement
of $377.90.
   Silver bullion for current delivery settled at $5.646 a troy
ounce on New York's Comex compared to $5.601 on Friday.

<HEAD>P.A. Bergner To Acquire Carson Pirie Scott For $454 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Midwest department store operators Carson Pirie
Scott &amp; Co. and P.A. Bergner announced Monday they have agreed to
merge, with Bergner acquiring Carson for about $454 million.
   ``This merger fulfills our long-term objective to have a major
presence in the Chicago area,'' said Alan R. Anderson, Bergner's
chief executive officer and board chairman.
   The announcement wraps up a month-long courtship of
Chicago-based Carson that began in mid-April when Bergner made a
$282 million buyout offer worth about $20 a share. That bid was
rejected, as was the sweetened offer one week later of $24 a share.
   ``Together, the Bergner family of stores _ Bergner's, Boston
Store and Carson's _ will constitute one of the largest
department-store operations in the Midwest and will be No. 1 in
sales,'' said Anderson, who added the Carson's stores would
continue to operate under the Carson Pirie Scott name.
   At an afternoon news conference, however, he said some of
Carson's subsidiary stores _ including the County Seat and Arcadia
stores _ will be offered for sale.
   Anderson also said there were no plans to release any of
Carson's employees but that Peter S. Willmott, Carson's chairman
and chief executive officer, would resign.
   Willmott called the linkage of the two retail chains ``the
beginning of another stage in the company's ongoing 135-year-old
history'' and said it would serve shareholders' best interests.
   ``It had been my strong personal preference to continue the
two-year restructuring program we began in 1987 and to remain an
independent, focused retailer,'' said Willmott.
   The company fended off a 1986 takeover attempt by Chicago-based
Baytree Investors Inc.
   Carson lost $38.8 million in the fiscal year that ended in
January, partly because of problems integrating the Donaldson's
stores it bought in 1987 in Minnesota. Two years ago, the company
finished $26.7 million in the red.
   Willmott said the merger with Bergner's ``will combine two
companies with similar strategic objectives and will give Carson's
and Bergner's a stronger position in the highly competitive Midwest
market. Carson Pirie Scott's valuable name and position in the
retail industry will be maintained.''
   Carson Pirie Scott operates 33 stores under its own name. They
are located in Chicago, central Illinois, northwest Indiana,
Minnesota and Iowa. It also operates 391 County Seat specialty
stores, mostly in Midwest and Sunbelt states, and 23 Arcadia shops,
primarily in Chicago.
   With the acquisition, Bergner's _ a Swiss-owned chain that has
operated in the Midwest for 100 years and has 33 stores in Illinois
and Wisconsin _ will become one of the top 15 U.S. department-store
operations with consolidated revenue of about $1 billion. Bergner,
owned by the Maus and Nordmann families of Switzerland, has
headquarters in Milwaukee for its U.S. holdings.
   Under the agreement approved by boards of both companies, a
Bergner's subsidiary will begin a tender offer within five business
days for all the outstanding Carson's shares for $27.50 each. Based
on 16.5 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis, the
takeover will cost $453.75 million.
   Shares not acquired in the tender offer will be acquired in cash
in a subsequent merger.
   Merrill Lynch Capital Markets is advising Carson's, and Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. and Finance Co. are advising Bergner's.

<BYLINE>Gloomy Weather Forecasts Force Grains Higher ^By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices rose strongly Monday on the
Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to long-range forecasts of
below-average rainfall in several grain-producing states.
   On other markets, gasoline and crude oil prices rallied; cattle
and hogs were up, and gold and silver prices gained moderately.
   Wheat settled 4 cents to 6\ cents higher with the contract for
delivery in May at $4.23} a bushel; corn was 4\ cents to 5} cents
higher with May at $2.74 a bushel; oats were 5 cents to 6{ cents
higher with May at $1.84{ a bushel; soybeans were 12} cents to 17}
cents higher with May at $7.35\ a bushel.
   The increased grain and soybean prices came on the heels of the
30- and 90-day forecasts released Friday by the National Weather
Service, which predicted a return to dry conditions in the western
half of the Farm Belt, including Iowa and Illinois.
   The forecasts fueled talk of a return of drought conditions,
pushing up prices across the board.
   ``It was a very typical weather-related price movement,'' said
Ted Mao, a grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., in
New York. ``There is a lot of uncertainty in the market, and the
market should reflect that uncertainty into the summer.''
   Wheat finished strong despite doubt over the Bush
administration's position on continuing subsidized grain sales to
foreign countries.
   Mao noted that a lot of people are questioning the export
subsidy program, which finances cheap wheat sales to certain
nations, in the light of its costs and the prospect of a poor wheat
crop.
   Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday that Bush will soon
have a decision of a new grain sale to the Soviets.
   Petroleum prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed
mixed in light trading because of the May Day holiday celebrated in
Europe and Asia.
   Crude oil and gasoline moved up as buyers took advantage of
lower prices, while heating oil prices dropped in a selloff.
   Jim Ritterbusch, an analyst with Carson Petroleum Co. in
Chicago, said traders who sold their gasoline contracts last week
were buying the fuel and selling heating oil, betting that gasoline
prices would rise.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 12 cents to 24 cents
higher with June at $20.66 a barrel; heating oil was .18 cent to
.31 cent lower with June at 49.46 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .45 cent to 1.39 cents higher with June at 72.61 cents a gallon.
   Cattle and hogs were up and pork bellies down on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange in moderate trading.
   ``There's little I can tell you about the market,'' said Charlie
Richardson, an analyst with Lind-Waldock &amp; Co. in Denver. ``It has
given no clear direction.''
   Richardson said some traders are selling because they expect
more cattle and hogs will be brought to market, while others are
buying because they expect a decrease in deliveries.
   Live cattle settled .02 cent to .37 cent higher, with June at
71.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .22 cent lower to .10 cent
higher with May at 76.30 cents a pound; hogs were .02 cent lower to
.30 cent higher with June at 46.92 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .13 cent to 2 cents lower with May at 30.87 cents a
pound.
   Gold and silver futures settled slightly higher on New York's
Commodities Exchange as traders cashed in on what is thought to be
an oversold market.
   Despite the rise in prices, the market remains bearish because
of the lowering of the inflation mentality, said James Steel, an
analyst for Refco Inc. in New York.
   Without the threat of inflation there is little reason for
investors to buy gold.
   Gold settled 20 cents to 80 cents higher with May at $378.20 a
troy ounce; silver was 4.5 cents to 6 cents higher with May at
$5.646 a troy ounce.

   Hitachi Ltd. and General Motors
Corp.'s Electronics Data Systems unit said Monday they have formed
a joint venture company that will operate National Advanced
Systems, which they bought from National Semiconductor Corp. for
$398 million.
   National Advanced Systems, which markets Hitachi's mainframe
computers and peripheral equipment, will operate as a subsidiary of
the joint venture, called Hitachi Data Systems Corp.
   The agreement to buy NAS was announced two months ago and was
completed on Friday.
   Gary B. Moore, a 16-year veteran of Dallas-based EDS, was
appointed president and chief executive officer of Hitachi Data
Systems.
   David N. Martin, president of NAS, said he will not be joining
the new company.
   ``Dave Martin has earned our respect for his tenure at the helm
of NAS,'' Moore said. ``During that time, NAS grew from a company
with slightly more than $300 million in annual revenues to sales
approaching the billion dollar mark today.''
   Hitachi owns 80 percent and EDS 20 percent of the new joint
venture.

   Consumer confidence in the U.S. economy remains
strong despite growing indications of a slowdown caused by rising
interest rates, the Conference Board business research group
reported Monday.
   Its monthly Consumer Confidence Index, which tracks the spending
plans and perceptions about the economy in 5,000 households
nationwide, totaled 116.3 points in April, down only slightly from
the 117.7 figure in March. The index is calculated on a 1985 base
year of 100 points.
   An analysis of the latest index showed 28.8 percent of
respondents believe current business conditions are good, unchanged
from a month earlier, and 34.7 percent believe jobs are plentiful,
slightly higher than the March percentage.
   Respondents were slightly less optimistic about the next six
months, however. Only 16.5 percent anticipate an improvement in
business conditions, vs. 18 percent who said so a month earlier.
   The index also showed only 3.1 percent of respondents plan to
purchase a home, unchanged from March, reflecting continued concern
with rising interest rates and the resulting higher cost of
financing a mortgage.
   Nonetheless, the Conference Board said in its analysis, the
index showed consumer confidence remained resiliently high.
   ``The consumer's sustained sense of well-being is justified, at
least for the moment, by the continuing vigor of the economy,''
said Fabian Linden, executive director of the group's consumer
research center.
   The Conference Board, based in New York, describes itself as a
worldwide business network of companies and executives in more than
50 nations that conducts research and provides forums for
exchanging information.

<TEXT>
   Tenneco Inc.'s earnings soared 73 percent in the
first three months of 1989, and officials said Monday the results
reflected favorably on the company's decision last year to get out
of the risky oil business.
   The Houston-based company earned $109 million, or 82 cents per
common share, in the 1989 first quarter on revenues of $3.3 billion.
   For the same period last year, Tenneco earned $63 million, or 38
cents per share, on revenues of $3.2 billion. Those results
included $53 million from discontinued operations.
   Tenneco sold its oil and gas operations last year to a number of
firms for a total of $7.3 billion.
   During the first quarter this year, the company's natural gas
pipelines posted earnings of $112 million, compared to $87 million
in the same period last year.
   The increase resulted primarily from improved earnings in the
non-federally regulated sectors of intrastate pipelines, methanol
and natural gas liquids, and other non-jurisdicational marketing
areas.
   Tenneco's shipbuilding division had a decline in earnings, going
from $34 million in the 1988 first quarter to $30 million this
quarter. The company said the decline was caused by lower margins
on naval construction.
   Tenneco had an overall loss in its other divisions, which
include farm and construction equipment, automotive parts,
packaging and chemicals and minerals.

<HEAD>Tough New Provision's Effective Date Delayed Until Oct. 1</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 2 grafs with Levin reax. Also moved on general news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration on Monday delayed
until Oct. 1 the effective date of a tough new tax provision aimed
at ensuring that employers' health insurance plans do not
discriminate in favor of higher-paid workers.
   ``The cost of compliance with Section 89 (of the Internal
Revenue Code) as it presently stands is excessive,'' Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady told a Chamber of Commerce meeting. ``The
law needs to be changed and we stand ready to encourage, support
and work with Congress to revise and improve it.''
   Brady's announcement of the three-month delay in the deadline
for employers to comply with the law was greeted by loud applause
from the business audience. Business has made repeal or
modification of the Section 89 law as major goal this year.
   The law, proposed by the Reagan administration, was enacted as
part of the 1986 tax overhaul. It requires employers to conduct a
lengthy series of complex tests to demonstrate that their
tax-deductible employee benefits, especially health insurance, are
not weighted against workers making less than $50,000 a year.
   Paperwork required by the law is so voluminous that some
employers are threatening to withdraw health insurance coverage for
all employees.
   Brady's announcement came on the eve of a public hearing on the
disputed section by the House Ways and Means Committee. Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill, the committee chairman, and most members of
the committee have signed a bill to significantly relax the testing
requirements on employers.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, also has called for overhaul of the provision.
   ``We have ... asked the Congress to work with the administration
to find ways to revise Section 89 to make its requirements less
burdensome on business,'' Brady said. The regulations issued by the
Internal Revenue Service ``impose unreasonable compliance burdens
on business,'' he added.
   The Section 89 rules went into effect on Jan. 1 but the IRS
waived compliance requirements until July 1 and agreed that no
employer would be penalized if a good-faith effort to follow the
rules were made the remainder of 1989.
   Under Rostenkowski's bill, employers that provide a health plan
would have to offer coverage costing workers $10 a week or less
($25 or less for a family plan) to 90 percent of employees.
Higher-paid workers would be taxed on the value of coverage that
was better than provided other employees.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said the Treasury Department's
decision was ``only a first step in cleaning up the administrative
nightmare associated'' with the tax provision.
   ``This should give employers the assurance that the IRS won't
rush into enforcing this flawed provision, and it should give the
Congress time to consider options ranging from substantial
simplification to outright repeal,'' Levin said.

<HEAD>30 Seconds of Radio Silence Set May 26</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Virtually all commercial radio stations
in the country will go silent for 30 seconds on May 26,
broadcasters said Monday, as part of a campaign to show the
importance of radio in daily life.
   The 30 seconds of dead air time _ ``The day the radio stopped''
_ will mark the beginning of a $100 million campaign with the
theme: ``Radio. What would life be without it.''
   The booming voice of actor James Earl Jones will tell listeners
that ``for the next 30 seconds this station and others would like
you to imagine your life without radio. Imagine if all your days
sounded like this. ...''
   Following the 30 seconds of silence, Jones will say: ``Thirty
seconds seems like a long time, doesn't it? Now think how radio
fills that silence for you.''
   The radio campaign was announced at the National Association of
Broadcasters convention. The NAB also inducted veteran sportscaster
Red Barber and pioneer Spanish-language broadcaster Nathan Safir
into the NAB's Broadcasting Hall of Fame.
   The radio awareness campaign is a joint effort by NAB and the
Radio Advertising Bureau.
   RAB President Warren Potash said: ``The campaign is intended to
increase awareness and appreciation for radio with advertisers and
opinion makers and to remind us all that radio's influence is large
and powerful.''
   The bottom line, he added, ``is to increase radio's share of
advertising dollars.''
   The campaign also will include on-air commercials and newspaper
and magazine ads.
   NAB President Eddie Fritts said ``this unprecedented collective
action by commercial radio stations marks a new marketing era''
based on psychological research that shows ``radio is a vital part
of people's daily lives that they take for granted.''
   Fritts said 228 million Americans listen to radio an average of
three hours and seven minutes a day. Follow-up surveys will
determine if the campaign has increased awareness of radio.
   Jerry Lyman, president of Radio Ventures L.P., said 10,000
stations are expected to go silent at 7:42 a.m. local time across
the country.
   ``Not everyone has committed'' at this time, said Steve Berger,
president of Nationwide Communications. But Lyman said he had heard
of only one station owner so far saying he would not participate.
   Lyman said broadcasters expect to hear a few complaints from
listeners when their radios go silent.
   ``We want a reaction,'' Lyman added.
   Barber and Safir were honored for their contributions to radio
over the years.
   Barber began announcing baseball on radio in 1934 with the
Cincinnati Reds. He later did play-by-play for the Brooklyn Dodgers
and New York Yankees and worked in 13 World Series broadcasts.
   Safir is vice president and general manager of KCOR in San
Antonio, Texas. He began a two-hour Spanish-language program on
KSTA in San Antonio in 1940 and produced and announced
Spanish-language programs for Armed Services Radio during World War
II.
   He also is vice president of Tichnor Media, the largest group of
Spanish-language radio stations in the country.

<TEXT>
   The House Banking Committee on Monday beat
back several efforts to weaken measures demanded by the Bush
Administration to make owners of savings and loan banks put more of
their own money at risk in exchange for federal insurance of
deposits.
   As Jesse Jackson lobbied committee members to make S&amp;Ls devote
more of their lending for low-income housing and inner-city
redevelopment, the panel rejected attempts to continue past
accounting techniques that had allowed many S&amp;Ls to operate with no
real ``tangible'' capital.
   The key vote was on an amendment by Rep. Thomas Ridge, D-Pa., to
give regulators authority to continue so-called ``good will''
exemptions from cash tangible capital requirements wanted by the
administration and approved by the committee last week.
   Ridge's amendment was defeated by a 28-23 vote after opponents
said good will is ``fake capital'' and said it is worthless as a
resource to make sure that S&amp;L owners have to pay before taxpayers
do in any future bailouts.
   Also defeated on an voice vote was an amendment by Rep. Steve
Bartlett, R-Texas, that would have allowed the ``good will''
exemptions negotiated by S&amp;L owners in pre-1985 mergers to account
for one-fourth of an S&amp;L's tangible capital requirements unti 1993.
   Instead, the committee placed new restrictions on the industry's
ability to rapidly increase their growth through so-called brokered
deposits _ one factor blamed for the $100 billion magnitude of the
S&amp;L crisis.
   On a voice vote, it adopted an amendment by Rep. Stephen Neal,
D-N.C., requiring both banks and S&amp;Ls with capital levels below
federal standards to get prior approval before seeking brokered
deposits in blocks of $100,000.
   ``In many instances, real high-flyer savings and loans attracted
large deposits with high interest rates and used them to make risky
loans,'' Neal said.
   When those loans went bad, many S&amp;Ls tried to ``grow their way
out of trouble'' by seeking more brokered deposits at even higher
interest rates for even riskier loans ``and we wound up with a much
bigger tab because of it,'' said Rep. Richard Lehman, D-Calif.
   Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mullins called the
committee's actions Monday ``another good day'' for the
administration's bailout plan. He said the committee rejected
``resorting to acounting devices to water down'' Bush's proposed
capital standards.
   The effort, however, is likely to arise again when the bill
reaches the House floor. Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., chairman of
the powerful House Rules Committee, expressed strong support for
``good will'' accounting in a letter last week.
   ``We're trying to be tough and fair, and not just tough,'' said
Ridge, who cited hundreds of S&amp;Ls in Illinois, Pennsylvania, New
York, New Jersey and Ohio that lost much of their tangible capital
in the early 1980s by taking over failed thrifts at the urging of
the federal government.
   The committee chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas _ who
with a coalition of senior Repubicans and young Democrats on the
committee has been leading the administration's fight for reforms
against mostly young GOP lawmakers who want to weaken them _ said
good will is worthless as capital.
   ``It cannot be converted to cash to offset losses,'' he said.
``When there is not capital or (only) fake capital, the losses fall
to the insurance funds and the taxpayers.''
   In exchange for taking over failed thrifts in the early 1980s
and covering their losses, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corp. _ itself near insolvency _ granted healthy S&amp;Ls more than $20
billion in ``good will'' exemptions lasting up to 40 years from
normal capital requirements.
   But the institutions that pitched in with that aid by using much
of their own capital to effectively rescue the government's
insurance fund then face possible extinction by the new standards
wanted by Bush, Gonzalez and other reformers.
   ``I understand that these institutions have a problem,'' said
Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who has been carrying much of the
administration's case. ``But so do we.
   ``We're asking for $100 billion from taxpayers and flushing it
down the drain,'' Schumer said. ``And if you don't legislate
against the 5 percent to 10 percent who would go back to the same
practices that got us here, we'll be back where we are today.''
   The Bush administration originally proposed ending the
exemptions gradually over 10 years in an effort to make S&amp;L owners
put more of their own money at risk.
   The Senate two weeks ago extended the good-will phaseout to 25
years. But it said S&amp;Ls must show that by June 1991 they have $1.50
in tangible capital for every $100 of loans in their portfolios
that could be seized before federal insurance funds are tapped to
cover depositors' losses.
   The House Banking Committee voted to toughen that requirement
last week, saying that S&amp;Ls must have at least $3 of tangible
capital for every $100 of loans by January 1995.
   Jackson spent more than two hours in offices off the committee's
hearing room lobbying its members on behalf of amendments to raise
corporate taxes to pay for the bailout and make S&amp;Ls increase their
lending to minorities and for inner city projects.
   Specifically, Jackson supports a proposed amendment by Reps.
Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., and Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., that would
finance the bailout by raising the alternative capital income tax
from its present 20 percent to 25 percent and tax all capital gains
above $175,000 a year at 33 percent.
   The amendment has minuscule support and was not even introduced
in the Senate as an alternative to President Bush's elaborate
financing plan to prevent the cost of the bailout from adding to
the federal deficit and aggravating the need for higher taxes.
   Bush's plan would raise an immediate $50 billion for the bailout
through the creation of an off-budget bond underwriter at an
estimated cost to taxpayers of $200 billion to $250 billion over
the next 30 years.
   ``This `Read my lips' slogan that he's adhering to is the most
costly slogan in history,'' Jackson said. ``The Reagan-Bush
administration got us into trouble by disregarding their charge and
mandate to regulate.''

   The U.S. Labor Department proposed $1.15
million in fines for two contractors cited Monday for 115 safety
violations in a methane gas explosion last year that killed three
sewer tunnel workers.
   S.A. Healy Co. of McCook, Ill., was cited for 68 willful
violations carrying fines of $680,000; CH2M Hill Central Inc. of
Corvallis, Ore., was cited for 47 willful violations carrying
penalties of $470,000.
   Healy, the main contractor for the project, and CH2M, hired to
supervise construction on the tunnel, have 15 days to appeal the
citations and penalties to the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, said Mike Connors, regional administrator of OSHA's
Chicago office.
   Healy President George Malina said in a statement that his
company had cooperated with OSHA's investigation and the citations
were ``not a verdict but rather a starting point.''
   ``We intend to vigorously defend against the OSHA citations and
look forward to presenting all the facts,'' he said.
   CH2M said in a statement the company was ``surprised and
distressed'' by the citations and that all equipment listed in the
47 citations belonged to the contractor.
   ``The responsibilities of CH2M Hill as program manager do not
include supervising or performing any of the construction'' on the
project, the statement said.
   Connors said his agency's investigation found that electrical
power had not been turned off after workers were evacuated from the
tunnel Nov. 10 after dangerously high levels of methane were
detected.
   Tony Bell, 25, of Sturgeon Bay, Wis.; Ron Kohne, 49, of Big
Sandy, Tenn.; and Rick Sochacki, 34, of South Holland, Ill.; were
killed by a explosion after they re-entered the tunnel to check
methane levels.
   Work has not resumed at the tunnel, but spokesmen for the
project have said they hope work might resume later this month.

<HEAD>Japanese Company Buys Celebrity Site For More Than $100 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Hotel Bel-Air, haunt of movie stars and
the Hollywood elite, was sold Monday to a Japanese company for more
than $100 million by its Texas owner.
   The price for the rambling, low-rise landmark works out to more
than $1 million per room, a record for hotel sales that real estate
experts say is unlikely to be surpassed any time soon.
   It demonstrates Japanese investors' continued appetite for such
``trophy'' real estate as prestigious big-city office buildings and
resort property.
   Dallas oil heiress Caroline Hunt, through her Rosewood Property
Co., announced that the Bel-Air had been sold to Sekitei Kaihatsu,
a 95-year-old Tokyo company that operates hotels, resorts and
restaurants in Japan.
   Rosewood said the landmark, which had been on the market for
about two months, sold for more than $100 million, but didn't
reveal the precise amount.
   Rosewood will continue to operate the hotel, it said.
   The Bel-Air's restaurant ranks with the nearby Polo Lounge in
Beverly Hills among the city's chic dining spots. Recent diners
have ranged from entertainers Mel Gibson, Kathleen Turner and
William Hurt to CBS executive Bud Grant and Walt Disney Co. chief
Michael Eisner.
   One-time hotel resident Tony Curtis once called the hotel the
best wife he'd ever had.
   The Hotel Bel-Air, which sits on Los Angeles' tony west side not
far from the UCLA campus, has room rates ranging from $195 to
$1,300 per night, with an average of $375 a night. Occupancy
averages 90 percent, compared with a national average of 68 percent.
   Ms. Hunt's company bought the mission-style hotel and its
11-acre grounds in 1982 for $22.7 million and spent $20 million
renovating it and adding 30 rooms, for a total of 92 rooms.
   The previous record per-room price for a hotel was $200 million,
or more than $750,000 a room, paid for the Beverly Hills Hotel by
the Sultan of Brunei in 1987.
   Last week, another Japanese company completed purchase of the
nearby Riviera golf and tennis club for more than $100 million.

<HEAD>Labor Department Sues Shearson For Alleged Misuse Of Teamsters Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Monday sued a brokerage
firm, an investment manager and several trustees of $561 million in
Teamsters union benefit funds for allegedly abusing their positions
for financial gain through stock deals and other transactions.
   Among the allegations in the Labor Department suit is that the
Utica, N.Y., office of the brokerage firm Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. manipulated stock purchases for the funds to benefit other
clients.
   Shearson, investment manager Stein Roe and Farnham Inc. and
several of their agents were charged with violating federal pension
laws by causing the Teamsters funds to engage in prohibited
financial transactions.
   A copy of the complaint was released by Labor Department
officials in Washington after normal business hours Monday and
attempts to reach Shearson and Stein Roe officials were
unsuccessful.
   A telephone call to Shearson's Utica office was not answered and
a woman who answered the phone at Stein Roe in New York said there
was no one available to comment.
   Included in the alleged abuses were ``stock parking'' schemes in
which Shearson, acting through three of its employees, set up an
account in its Utica office that it used to purchase stocks with
the funds' assets.
   Instead of immediately transferring the stocks to the funds, the
suit alleged that Shearson ``parked'' them for a period of time to
determine their short-term profitability and used accounting tricks
to transfer securities that had increased in value to the accounts
of friends, relatives and customers of two former Shearson brokers
who handled the Teamsters account.
   One of the former brokers, George Inserra, allegedly used his
knowledge of the funds' investment plans to benefit some of his
individual clients by purchasing stock for them just before the
funds made large purchases of the same stock. Inserra then
allegedly sold the individual clients' stock at the higher prices
caused by the bulk purchase.
   Shearson and Stein Roe also allegedly benefited through fee
arrangements with banks issuing certificates of deposits to the
union funds. Shearson allegedly concealed indirect fees on assets
invested in the certificates; Stein Roe allegedly was paid to
manage those investments but performed no services.
   The funds involved are the New York State Teamsters Conference
Pension and Retirement Fund, the Upstate Teamsters Pension and
Retirement Fund and the New York State Teamsters Council Health and
Hospital Fund. Together they have about 65,000 participants and had
$561,231,396 in cumulative assets as of the end of 1985, the Labor
Department said.
   Eight current and former trustees of the funds were named as
defendants for allegedly violating their fiduciary responsibily to
the plans.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Syracuse, N.Y., seeks
a court order requiring the defendants to determine and restore
with interest all losses incurred by the funds because of improper
activities.
   It also seeks court-appointed monitors to review the practices
of Shearson and Stein Roe and an order prohibiting four current and
former employees of Shearson and Stein Roe from involvement in
pension plans covered by the federal Employee Retirement Income
Security Act.

<HEAD>Congressman Wants Bush to Block Takeover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANE E. ALLEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. James J. Florio, D-N.J., suggested Monday
that President George Bush safeguard national security by blocking
the proposed acquisition of American mineral interests by a South
African-linked company, but government lawyers said the president
lacks the authority to intervene.
   ``By allowing this takeover we are undercutting the
effectiveness of our country's anti-apartheid policy,'' Florio
wrote in a letter requesting that Bush act under a provision of the
1988 trade bill that the New Jersey congressman co-authored with
Sen. J. James Exon, D-Neb.
   Florio asked that Bush investigate a $6 billion takeover offer
made by Minorco, a Luxembourg-based holding company controlled by
South African interests.
   Minorco wants to acquire Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, a
London-based mining company whose American holdings include
Associated Minerals USA and the Newmont Mining Co. _ producers of
gold, rutile, zircon, monazite, and other strategic minerals with
military and nuclear applications.
   Florio said he's concerned the deal could increase South
Africa's control over production of the minerals.
   ``I believe this takeover raises important security questions
for the U.S., which may not have been adequately considered
previously, when this matter was under review by the inter-agency
Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States,'' said
Florio, chairman of the subcommittee on commerce, consumer
protection and competitiveness.
   However, Steve Canner, staff chairman of the inter-agency
committee, said the panel had fully reviewed the merger and decided
against proceeding with an investigation.
   ``If the committee decides not to go forward, that's it,'' he
said.
   According to documents supplied by the Treasury Department,
government attorneys reviewed the deal's potential impact on
strategic metals as well as anti-apartheid laws before concluding
``the transaction posed no threat to the U.S. national security.''
   Government attorneys said Monday that based on the legislative
history that accompanied the trade bill and the executive order
implementing the bill, once the 30-day review period ended without
a decision to proceed to an investigation, action under Exon-Florio
had concluded and the president had no authority to resurrect the
issue.
   Minorco, which is 60 percent owned by Anglo American Corp. of
South Africa and De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., is the largest
producer of gold in the non-communist world. Gold Fields is the
world's second-largest gold concern.

<HEAD>Wholesale Gasoline Rallies Anew</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 5 grafs on BP raising its Alaskan crude price.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The energy futures market turned mixed in light
trading Monday, with gasoline and crude oil rising in price and
home heating oil continuing to decline.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for
wholesale unleaded gasoline settled 1.39 cents higher at 72.61
cents a gallon. The May contract, which expired on Friday, had lost
3.91 cents.
   The June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, rose 24 cents to $20.66 a 42-gallon barrel,
after falling 50 cents on Friday.
   June heating oil, which gained 0.34 cent Friday, closed 0.31
cent lower at 49.46 cents a gallon. Heating oil has been on the
decline in reaction to the warmer weather.
   Andrew Lebow, an energy analyst at E.D.&amp;F. Man International
Futures Inc., attributed the rise in gasoline to strong
fundamentals, which, in turn, helped push up crude prices.
   ``We're motoring into the driving season and ... approaching the
Memorial Day holiday,'' he said.
   Gasoline has been the market's star performer recently due to
concerns of tight supplies for the summer driving season. Those
concerns escalated following the Exxon oil spill off the Alaskan
coast in March and a North Sea explosion recently.
   In a related move Monday, BP Exploration raised the price of
North Slope Alaskan crude by more than $2 a barrel, pushing the it
to its highest level in more than three years.
   The increase is partly attributable to the Prince William Sound
oil spill and interruptions of production in the North Sea, said
Chuck Lodgsdon, Alaska's chief petroleum economist.
   BP set its May contract price at $19.77 on the Gulf Coast and
$19.33 on the West Coast. The difference reflects a variation in
transportation costs.
   The prices represented a $2.25 a barrel increase on the Gulf
Coast and $2.20 more on the West Coast.
   BP is the only North Slope producer that makes its prices
public, but other North Slope producers usually follow BP's lead.

<HEAD>Fed Official: Repeal of Interstate Banking Ban Would Even Competition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR H. ROTSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Repealing the barriers to interstate banking
would remove handicaps on the industry in the national and
international marketplace, a member of the Federal Reserve's Board
of Governors said Monday.
   A repeal of such barriers ``could do much to level the global
playing field and to restore American banks to prominence around
the world,'' H. Robert Heller told the Bankers' Association for
Foreign Trade at its annual conference.
   Heller also said repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, which bars
banks from engaging in securities activities, would benefit
investors and borrowers and give customers better access to the
securities markets.
   He said American banks are retrenching in the world market,
while those in Japan and Western Europe keep enlarging their share.
   American banks' international lending is down almost 15 percent,
to about $100 billion, from its 1983 peak of $121 billion, while
Japanese lending has gone from $28 billion to $129 billion, German
and Swiss lending has more than doubled and British lending has
expanded by nearly 50 percent, he said.
   In addition, Heller said, Japanese dominance has extended to the
U.S. market, to no small extent ``because no bank is permitted to
have a nationwide presence in the United States.''
   He said it might be argued more accurately that California and
New York banks are competing against Japanese and German banks.
   ``At year-end 1987, 111 Japanese banks held over 40 percent of
the deposits in the 500 largest banks in the world. Ninety U.S.
banks were in the top 500, but they accounted for only 11 percent
of total deposits.
   ``No U.S. bank is among the largest 25 banks in the world, and
Japanese banks occupy the top 10 positions,'' he said.
   Heller said removing the barriers to interstate banking also
would ``result in more diversified and safer instutitions _ a
highly desirable result in these difficult times.''
   He said that while the presence of American banks abroad has
decreased, the reverse is true in this country, where 259 foreign
banks operate through subsidiaries, branches and agencies, with
combined assets of more than $600 billion, about 20 percent of
total United States banking assets.
   He said international banking has increased twice as fast as
world trade over the past 25 years and four times as fast as world
gross national product.
   He said a new agreement on risk-based capital signed by a dozen
major industrial nations, known as the Basle Accord, should help
redress inequities among banks incorporated in different nations by
establishing uniform capital standards for banks that are
internationally active.
   As for the banking and securities issue, Heller said the Fed
will review the situation within a year ``with an eye toward
allowing bank holding companies to engage in underwriting and
trading equity securities.''
   The Fed recently granted limited securities powers to bank
holding companies.
   He said fulfillment of Europe's move toward a unified banking
market and a uniform regulatory environment ``could mean the
creation of the largest unified banking market in the world.''
   However, a top European Commission official told the group
separately Monday they need not fear a ``fortress Europe'' or
reciprocity that would shut them out when the European Community's
trade barriers fall in 1992.
   Sir Leon Brittan, vice president of the commission, said the
commission's objective is a liberalized, competitive market as open
as possible to the world.
   As long as European Community institutions are not discriminated
against and genuinely have access to American markets, bankers in
this country have nothing to fear, he said.
   But a West German banking official said the EC should consider
imposing reciprocity sanctions on Japan to put pressure on that
country to open its banking markets and to liberalize trade, much
as American and British banks have done with some success.
   Martin Kohlhaussen, a director of Commerzbank in West Germany,
said reciprocity is of ``absolutely no problem'' to American
institutions in his country because of good banking relations.
``Our relations with Japan, however, have not always been of this
character,'' he said.
   Kohlhaussen said West Germany has used the reciprocity argument
against Japan to press Japan for access to its market.
   He said that Japan often bring up the image of ``Fortress
Europe, probably to divert attention from `Fortress Japan.'''
Washington have been assuaged of their fears about a ``European
fortress.''
   But he added that the United States represented ``a fortress
where the doors were open, but when you came in, there were a whole
lot of compartments, a whole lot of rooms that were locked up, one
against the other.''

<HEAD>Board Of Trade Commissions Study Of Dual Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Board of Trade on Monday said it has
hired a university professor to study dual trading at the world's
largest commodites futures exchange.
   Sanford J. Grossman of Princeton University will conduct the
dual trading study in connection with the Board of Trade's own
review of trading practices.
   Dual trading, which refers to a trader buying or selling futures
contracts for himself and for customers, has come under attack as a
conflict of interest.
   The announcement comes three months after disclosures of a
federal investigation into suspected fraud at the Board of Trade
and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   ``The Chicago Board of Trade has dedicated itself to evaluating
all aspects of trading practices and market surveillance,'' said
Karsten ``Cash'' Mahlmann, chairman of the exchange.
``Commissioning this study is another step in this process.''
   One complaint is that dual trading creates a situation that
allows a trader to first trade his own account in a way that would
profit from price swings resulting from filing the customer's
order. That action would violate law.
   Grossman's study of dual trading will be conducted in two parts,
officials said, with the first _ explaining how the practice works
_ completed by July. The second study, based on observing traders
in the pits making dual trades, is due in 1990.
   Grossman was a contributor to a report on the 1987 stock market
crash commissioned by the New York Stock Exchange.
   Mahlmann said the Board of Trade ``has received many letters and
other expressions of concern from commercial customers in our
markets, requesting that we maintain the practice of dual trading.
They understand the benefits it provides.''
   The exchange, at the request of the Commodities Futures Trading
Commission, had conducted its own study of dual trading. The study
concluded the practice results in a better price for customer and
adds to the liquidity of the market.
   The study also contended that customers can choose to trade with
a broker who does not trade for himself.
   Brokers and traders at the Merc and the Board of Trade have been
under investigation for two years by federal agents who suspect
customers may have been defrauded of millions of dollars. No
charges have resulted from the investigation.

<TEXT>
   The top officers of Sun State Savings and Loan
Association descended to the lobby of their thrift Monday in an
attempt to talk customers out of pulling their deposits from the
struggling S&amp;L.
   In some cases, they were successful, said Sun State spokesman
Michael Million.
   ``We had as many standing in line to make deposits or cash
checks or do some other kind of transaction as we did for
withdrawals,'' Million said.
   ``Monday is our busiest day anyway, and when you add to that
that people are concerned about the news that they heard over the
weekend, most people were quite satisfied when they heard our
answers.''
   On Friday, Sun State announced a $63.5 million annual loss, the
resignation of its two top executives, the reduction of
stockholders' equity to a negative $17.3 million, and the signing
of a ``supervisory agreement'' under which the S&amp;L acknowledged
that grounds might exist for a federal takeover.
   Federal regulators have required Sun State to maintain at least
$34 million in working capital. Friday's announcement also said the
thrift had only $7 million.
   Million said new Chairman Thomas E. Arnold and new Vice Chairman
Robert F. Amos were successful in persuading some depositors not to
withdraw their money.
   ``You could say it (the effort) is extraordinary, but not in
light of a $63 million loss,'' Million said.

<HEAD>N.Y. Fed President Takes Swipe At Junk Bond King</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Federal Reserve official took an impromptu
swipe Monday at Henry Kravis, the king of leveraged buyouts.
   E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York, noted that Kravis had won an award for leadership in business
in 1988 from Columbia Business School's alumni association.
   ``It raises in my mind a question about your definition of
business,'' Corrigan said at the alumni association's 1989 awards
dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria.
   The unprepared remark drew murmurs from the black-tie audience.
   In his speech, Corrigan said the nation should but more emphasis
on mechanical and electrical engineering and less on what he called
financial engineering.
   Across town at the New York Hilton, Kravis was defending
leveraged buyouts as keynote speaker at the annual dinner of the
Harvard Business School of Greater New York.
   Kravis is a founding partner of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.,
which led such debt-financed deals as the record $24.53 billion
takeover of RJR Nabisco Inc.
   ``I see LBOs as one tactic, among others, to free U.S. business
from the paralyzing clutches of hidebound corporate bureaucracies
and to increase our competitive position in the world economy,''
Kravis said.
   At Columbia's dinner, Corrigan received an award for leadership
in government, while Charles E. Exley Jr., chairman and chief
executive of NCR Corp., got the award for leadership in business
and W. Edwards Deming, the quality control guru, received a
lifetime achievement award for public service.
