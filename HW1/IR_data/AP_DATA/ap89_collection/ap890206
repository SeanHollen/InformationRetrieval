   American John Hull, a well-known
supporter of Nicaraguan rebels, remained in custody for drug and
weapons charges Monday after a court denied his request for release
on bond.
   The Superior Penal Court of Alajuela told The Associated Press on
Monday that it rejected Hull's request to be released on $12,500
bond.
   Judge Maximo Esquivel, head of the court issuing the ruling,
refused to comment on the decision.
   Hull, 69, has been held since he was arrested Jan. 13. Officials
also said he was being investigated on charges of spying for the
U.S.-backed rebels, known as the Contras.
   Hull remained in custody a Costa Rican hospital where he was
taken Jan. 24 after suffering a heart attack in his jail cell.
   Matias Quesada, director of Hospital Mexico, said Monday that
Hull was recuperating and in stable condition.
   Elda Zuniga, Hull's attorney, claims her client is the victim of
political persecution and that his arrest was unconstitutional.
   Hull, a former Indiana resident, has lived in Costa Rica for 20
years.
   He has denied any drug trafficking connections. He said in 1986
that authorities twice raided his home in unsuccessful attempts to
find evidence of gun-running and drug smuggling.
   Hull has acknowledged permitting the Contras to use his ranch
property for their activities before the Iran-Contra case broke in
1986. In the case, Reagan administration officials sent arms to Iran
for money to be sent to the Contras.
   Witnesses testifying before Congress on illegal arms shipments to
the Contras have said Hull's ranch was a way station for gun
smugglers and cocaine traffickers.
   Hull was not among 13 men indicted in Spetember in Miami on
charges of running an illegal arms network for the Contras. Reports
said Hull was granted immunity by the special prosecutor in the case.
   Convicted cocaine pilot Gary Betzner has testified that Hull once
met his plane when it landed on the ranch to exchange Contra arms
for Colombian cocaine.

   Actress Robin Givens has signed a divorce
agreement that will end her stormy marriage to heavyweight boxing
champion Mike Tyson, her attorney said Monday.
   They plan to file for divorse in the Dominican Republic and the
divorce should be final within 45 days, said lawyer Raoul Felder.
   A no-fault divorce _ in which both parties agree that they should
be divorced _ can be obtained in the Dominican Republic by either
husband or wife following an overnight stay in the country, said
Felder.
   Residency requirements are more stringent in other places, he
said.
   ``Theoretically, either one of them could go there tomorrow and
get it,'' he said.
   However, he said, because both of them have prior commitments,
the Dominican divorce will not be sought until at least 30 days from
now.
   Felder described the agreement, which Tyson signed last week and
Ms. Givens signed Sunday night, this way: ``Basically, she will keep
what was hers, including all of her jewelry, and he will keep what
is his.''
   Felder declined to discuss the settlement in detail. Asked who
would get the couple's New Jersey mansion, he said, ``She never
wanted it.''
   In a statement Ms. Givens released through her publicist Larry
Weinberg, she said she and her family would be rooting for Tyson
when he fights British boxer Frank Bruno on Feb. 25.
   She also said: ``In view of the fact that Michael has honored our
personal agreement not to further publicly discuss our matter, nor
the terms of the agreement, I will do no less. This is the last
statement I will have on our personal lives.''
   Earlier Monday, Felder said he would know by the end of the week
whether Ms. Givens had signed the agreement, but later in the day he
acknowledged that she had signed it Sunday evening.
   He said he originally didn't want to confirm the agreement had
been signed because of a technical glitch in the paperwork, but he
later decided to confirm that Ms. Givens had signed the agreement to
clear up conflicting reports.
   Ms. Givens appears in the TV series, ``Head of the Class.''

   Hundreds of new pupils have entered
the battered classrooms of Pace Community College, signaling the
rebirth of a private high school that was once a showpiece of U.S.
investment in black education.
   When Pace opened in 1982, the $6-million, tan brick building
gleamed like a well-endowed institution in a wealthy American
suburb. Despite the grassy, 22-acre campus separating it from
Soweto's dirt streets and shabby bungalows, the school now seems to
belong to an inner-city slum.
   Offering commercial studies as an alternative to Soweto's rundown
state schools, Pace suffered during the 1984-87 period of nationwide
black unrest and school boycotts against apartheid. Militants
advocating ``people's education'' tagged Pace as elitist. Politics
and violence distracted the students and few passed their exams. The
school closed for several months.
   Principals came and went, vandals invaded the building, U.S.
companies that had built the school withdrew their support, the
staff served without pay, and enrollment shrank.
   As the new term began Jan. 25, the roof leaked and the telephone
didn't work. Toilets and lockers were broken. Books, chairs and
teachers were scarce.
   Two derelict cars stood in the driveway. Weeds had grown
waist-high in the tennis courts. A handwritten note taped on a
classoom door recalled an extracurricular struggle: ``Don't push us,
turkeys, `cause you'll never get away with it.''
   But Pace has human assets: Wilkinson Kambule, 68, the new
principal, and Lekgau Mathabathe, 63, chairman of a new school board
composed entirely of Soweto residents. Both were school principals
in Soweto in 1976, and from their schools came leaders of student
riots against Afrikaans-language instruction imposed by the
white-minority government.
   Both resigned to support the student protest, Kambule becoming a
university mathematics teacher, Mathabathe joining a food-processing
company.
   Kambule retains a reputation as an insirational teacher who gets
results, and his arrival at Pace in mid-1988 was particularly
welcomed by Sowetans.
   ``Parents have confidence. Children started coming back from
private schools in Johannesburg,'' Kambule said in an interview.
``I'm budgeting for the full number of 600 students and I've had to
send hundreds away.''
   Some of Pace's U.S. corporate backers have divested and left
South Africa, but those that remain are showing renewed interest.
   ``We no longer have any say in running the school but we have
recommended to our members that they become involved financially
again,'' said Adrian Botha, executive director of the American
Chamber of Commerce in South Africa. ``One company has already
appointed a fund raiser for Pace.''
   Students are required to pay only half their annual fees of 3,000
rand ($1,250) and company donations are expected to make up the
balance. Mathabathe said Pace needs 60,000 rands ($25,000) a month
to stay open, and much more to renovate the building and increase
salaries.
   The school increasingly has encouraged community involvement.
Civic groups use the gymnasium, and the auditorium is rented out for
church services, wedding receptions and taxi drivers' meetings.
   But Kambule emphasized that Pace's goal remains the same: to
provide a superior education to blacks seeking middle-management
business jobs. The first Pace students to take final high school
exams under Kambule's direction numbered only 55 but 31 passed, by
far the best percentage of any Soweto school last year.
   ``I'm interested in children setting out on their own for the
future, through education,'' Kambule said. ``I tell them, `Don't
call me principal, I'm your employee, I'm in your service.' But
there's lots of discipline.''
   He appears to have ended Pace's political isolation from Soweto's
young militants.
   ``People have been asking for alternative education. I explain
that this is an alternative school,'' Kambule said.
   ``Politics in the school aren't over. The revolution is still on.
But they shouldn't treat us like they treat a government school.''
   Kambule said he allowed a youth group to use the auditorium last
year to celebrate the birthday of the imprisoned black leader Nelson
Mandela.
   ``They came to me afterward and said, `We didn't think you'd let
us.' I replied, `Why not? It's your school.'''

<HEAD>For Mexico's Cartoonists, the President Is Mickey Mouse</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The president, the military and the Virgin of
Guadalupe used to be off-limits for Mexican political cartoonists.
Now only the generals and the Virgin are taboo.
   The best of Mexico's cartoonists say what others can't _ or
won't. Their razor-sharp commentaries sparkle on gray pages awash in
windy pro-government prose.
   ``They are in the vanguard of free expression in Mexico,'' said
Carlos Monsivais, one of Mexico's most outspoken, acerbic social
analysts. ``They get away with things I never could.''
   The political ferment of 1988, a year of unprecedented losses at
the polls for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, sparked
a wave of graphic daring.
   More than one artist has depicted Mexico's diminutive, jug-eared,
balding new chief executive, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, as a
Disneyesque rodent named Mickey.
   ``They are tough, very tough,'' Monsivais said approvingly,
although President Salinas seems to be getting a bit more cartoon
respect than he did as candidate and president-elect.
   Jerry Robinson, head of the New York-based Cartoonists and
Writers Syndicate, agrees that something special is afoot.
   ``Mexico has a fantastically high number of exceptional
cartoonists,'' said Robinson, who syndicates many of Mexico's best.
``They are high-caliber graphic artists. It makes their work very,
very effective.''
   Rogelio Naranjo's razor-sharp pen has been on the cutting edge
for years. Day by day, stroke by ironic stroke, Naranjo has chiseled
away at the pretensions, foibles, hypocrisies and taboos that have
buttressed a one-party government for 60 years. He's honed a sixth
sense for what he can get away with in his 22 years of political
cartooning.
   ``It's like a mystical thing in my work. I navigate the line that
divides what is possible and what isn't,'' he said. When it comes to
government policy, now ``there are very few limits.''
   Government austerity programs and Mexico's crippling foreign debt
provoke some of the bitterest commentary.
   Naranjo resorted, literally, to gallows humor, depicting a plump
man representing the World Bank picking the pocket of a starved,
barefoot and hanged worker.
   Bulmaro Castellanos, who draws under the monicker Magu, showed
Salinas, architect of an austerity pact that controlled wages and
prices, as a crazed workman armed with a chainsaw standing over a
bloody body skewered by the pact.
   The generals are another story. Both official censorship and
self-censorship have a long history in Mexico, where few care to
rouse the military and endanger decades of civilian rule.
   ``The army is the most taboo thing,'' Naranjo said. ``Everyone
assumes the army is a great power in Mexico that can influence the
government in a radical and substantial manner.''
   As for the Virgin of Guadalupe, even Naranjo, who has lampooned
the pope, says such a revered symbol cannot be used to make a point.
A museum exhibit that included irreverent paintings of Mexico's
patron saint was shuttered after a public outcry.
   Although most of their satire is directed at the ruling
establishment, the cartoonists do take occasional pokes at the
opposition. Efren Maldonado showed opposition leader Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas as a giant head supported by a magic carpet in the image of
former President Lazaro Cardenas, Cuauhtemoc's father and a national
hero.
   Cartoonists such as Naranjo and Helio Flores began stretching the
limits of the possible as founders of the cheeky humor magazine La
Garrapata in 1968, a year of political upheaval in much of the
world, including Mexico.
   ``The notion of reverence disappeared,'' Monsivais said.
   In a show of impatience with the one-party status quo, thousands
took to the streets. The unrest lasted only a few months, until the
army opened fire on a demonstration in Mexico City, killing scores.
   Not long after the massacre, La Garrapata co-founder Eduardo del
Rio, who signs himself Rius, was kidnapped by uniformed men and
forced to stand next to an empty grave in front of what turned out
to be a mock firing squad.
   Subsequent administrations began slowly opening a safety valve
that included tolerance for press freedom.
   The Mexican chief executive was traditionally above reproach, no
matter how unpopular. Even now Maldonado, the first cartoonist to
put Dumbo ears on Salinas, insists he intends no disrepect.
   Flores remembers a cartoon of President Jose Lopez Portillo, who
left office to almost universal relief in 1982. ``He was drawn as
Hamlet _ but very, very handsome, very athletic,'' Flores said.
   With Salinas, cartoonists have gone far beyond making fun of his
ears and his austere economics, attacking the very legitimacy of his
presidency. His election was marred by accusations of fraud and
Cardenas still claims that he won.
   The most audacious cartoons appear in El Universal, a mainline
newspaper that gave significant space to the opposition in 1988, and
in two publications born after 1968: La Jornada, a liberal daily,
and the feisty weekly Proceso.
   But both Naranjo and Flores, who just won his second Gran Prix
from the International Salon of Cartoon, say even El Universal
sometimes refuses a cartoon it considers too daring.
   After the July 6 presidential election, which many say the ruling
party rigged, Flores did a sketch portraying Salinas as Dr.
Caligari, the eerie protagonist of a classic silent horror film.
   El Universal rejected it without explanation, he said. The
cartoon later ran in an opposition paper.

   The mayor of Bucharest has been replaced
after less than a year in office, the Romanian state news agency
said in a terse report that gave no reason for the personnel change.
   Constantin Radu, who had also headed the ruling Communist Party
in the capital, ``was given other tasks,'' Agerpres reported Monday
without details.
   Barbu Petrescu, 63, a former deputy premier, was named to replace
him in both posts, the news agency said.
   Radu's ouster comes at a time of widespread food and energy
shortages in Romania's capital. But the announcement came as a
surprise, Western diplomats in Bucharest said, since Radu was named
mayor in May.
   Radu, previously deputy premier for construction and investment,
apparently oversaw construction in Bucharest of a giant party
headquarters and apartments for the party elite.
   About 30 churches or synagogues were destroyed or moved to make
way for the project. Hundreds of old private homes were also pulled
down.

   Police tipped off by U.S. and Italian investigators
found 1,038 pounds of cocaine, France's largest seizure of the drug,
in a yacht being towed across the country, the Interior Ministry
said.
   Three men were arrested Monday during the search of the 40-foot
yacht at Nevers, 150 miles southeast of Paris, and police in
Marseille arrested four other men, the ministry said. Those arrested
were not immediately charged and they were not identified.
   The yacht arrived in the northwestern port city of Le Havre last
month needing repairs after an Atlantic crossing, the ministry said
in a statement. It was loaded on a trailer to be towed to Cannes on
the Mediterranean.
   The previous record cocaine seizure in France was 880 pounds in
December 1987 on a plane on the Caribbean island of Marie Galante
near Guadeloupe.

   Here is a transcript of President Bush's news
conference Monday.
   Bush: Well, for more than half a century the U.S. has operated a
deposit insurance program that provides direct government protection
to the savings of our citizens.
   This program has enabled tens of millions of Americans to save
with confidence.
   In all the time since creation of the deposit insurance, savers
have not lost one dollar of insured deposits, and I am determined
that they never will.
   Deposit insurance has always been intended to be self-funded.
   And this means that the banks, the savings and loans, and credit
unions that are insured pay a small amount of their assets each year
into a fund that's used to protect depositors.
   In every case these funds are spent to protect the depositors,
not the institutions that fail.
   For the last 20 years, conditions in our financial markets have
grown steadily more complex, and a portion of the savings and loan
industry has encountered steadily growing problems.
   These financial difficulties have led to a continuous erosion of
the strength of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation,
FSLIC.
   Economic conditions have played a major role in this situation.
   However, unconscionable risk-taking, fraud, and outright
criminality have also been factors.
   Because of the accumulation of loses at hundreds of these thrift
institutions, additional resources must be devoted to cleaning up
this problem.
   We intend to restore our entire deposit insurance system to
complete health.
   While the issues are complex and the difficulties manifold, we
will make the hard choices, not run from them.
   We will see that the guarantee to depositors is forever honored,
and we will see to it that the system is reformed comprehensively so
that the situation is not repeated again.
   To do this, I am today announcing a comprehensive and
wide-ranging set of proposals.
   The secretary of the treasury, Nicholas Brady, will describe
these proposals to you in detail in a few minutes.
   However, I think it's important to summarize some of the major
points.
   The proposals include four major elements.
   First, currently insolvent savings institutions will be placed
under the joint management of the FDIC and FSLIC, pursuant to
existing law.
   This will enable us to control future risk-taking and to begin
reducing ongoing losses.
   Second, the regulatory mechanism will be substantially overhauled
to enable it to more effectively limit risk-taking.
   The FDIC would become the insurance agency for both banks and
thrifts under this system, although there's no comingling of funds.
   The insurer will have the authority to set minimum standards for
capital and accounting.
   Uniform disclosure standards will also be implemented.
   The chartering agency for thrifts would come under the general
oversight of the secretary of the treasury.
   Third, we will create a financing corporation to issue $50
billion in bonds to finance the cost of resolving failed
institutions which will supplement approximately $40 billion that
has already been spent.
   All of the principal of these bonds and a portion of the interest
on them will be paid from industry sources.

   However, the balance would be paid from on-budget outlays of
general revenues.
   Hopefully, some of these revenues will be recovered in the future
through sale of assets and recovery of funds from the wrongdoers.
   Fourth, we plan to increase the budget of the Justice Department
by approximately $50 million to enable it to create a nationwide
program to seek out and punish those that have committed wrongdoing
in the management of these failed institutions.
   These funds will result in almost doubling the personnel devoted
to the apprehension and prosecution of individuals committing fraud
in our financial markets.
   As you can see, these proposals are based upon several overriding
principles.
   First, I will not support any new fee on depositors.
   Second, we should preserve the overall federal budget structure
and not allow the misdeeds and the wrongdoings of savings and loan
executives and the inadequacy of their regulation to significantly
alter our overall budget priorities.
   And third, I have concluded that this proposal, if promptly
enacted, will enable our system to prevent any repetition of this
situation.
   And fourth, I've decided to attack this problem head-on, with
every available resource of our government, because it is a national
problem.
   I've directed that the combined resources of our federal agencies
be brought together in a team effort to resolve the problem.
   And fifth, I believe that banks and thrifts should pay the real
cost of providing the deposit insurance protection.
   The price the FDIC charges banks for their insurance has not been
increased since 1935.
   We propose to increase the bank insurance premium by less than 7
cents per $100 of insurance protection that they receive.
   Every penny collected would be used to strengthen the FDIC so
that the taxpayers will not be called on to rescue it a few years
from now.
   And I make you a solemn pledge that we will make every effort to
recover assets diverted from these institutions and to place behind
bars those who have caused losses through criminal behavior.
   Let those who would take advantage of the public trust and put at
risk the savings of American families anticipate that we will seek
them out, pursue them, and demand the most severe penalty.
   In closing, I want to just say a word to the small savers of
America.
   Across this great land, families and individuals work and save,
and we hope to encourage even greater rates of savings to promote a
brighter future for our children.
   Your government has stood behind the safety of insured deposits
before.
   It does today, and it will do so at all times in the future.
   Every insured deposit will be backed by the full faith and credit
of the United States of America, which means it will be _ that it
will be absolutely protected.
   For the future, we will seek to achieve a safe, sound and
profitable banking system.
   However, integrity and prudence must share an equal position with
competition in our financial markets.
   Clean markets are an absolute prerequisite to a free economy and
to the public confidence that is its most important ingredient.
   I've determined to face this problem squarely and to ask for your
support in putting it behind us.
   I have ordered that the resources of the executive branch be
brought to bear on cleaning up this problem.
   I have personally met with the leadership of Congress on this
issue.
   My administration will work cooperatively with Congress as the
legislation that we will submit in a few days' time is considered.
   I call on the Congress to join me in a determined effort to
resolve this threat to the American financial system permanently,
and to do so without delay.

   I welcome the leaders that are with me here on this platform.
   I think their support says a lot about the efficacy of our
proposal.
   And now I propose to take just a few questions.
   On the technical aspects, I will defer to these people and then
I'll be glad to turn this over to Secretary Brady.
   I believe we start with Helen and then Terry and then get going.
   Q. Mr. Pesident, are you guaranteeing that the extra costs,
premium increases and so forth, will not be passed on to the
depositors, taxpayers? And also, what is your responsibility in this
debacle? I mean the Reagan-Bush deal for deregulation of business
and banking?
   A. On the first place, we're not guaranteeing that.
   I would hope that wouldn't happen, but there's no guarantee what
the institutions will do.
   Secondly, there's enough to be said for everybody in this
together trying to solve this problem.
   So I can't equate any personal _ I'm not inclined to go into any
personal blame, simply to say that we've got to solve this problem
and we're on the path to doing that.
   Yeah, Terry.
   Q. Mr. President, the House votes tomorrow on that controversial
pay raise plan. And the Senate has already voted against it. Would
you sign a bill that vetoes the pay raise, not only for the members
of Congress, but also for federal judges and other high officials in
the government?
   A. I said I support it.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, there is a feeling that part of this problem is
attributable to deregulation of the financial industry. In
retrospect, do you think that deregulation might have gone too far
in the last 10 years or so? And, in the future, is your marching
order to your administration to be a little more careful in
regulating this particular industry?
   A. Jerry, I don't know the answer.
   I'd be most interested to know what our experts here feel about
whether _ how much of the problem could be attributed to
deregulation.
   I just don't know the answer to your question.
   So, I can't reply.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, you have placed considerable stress in these
early days of your presidency on ethics and propriety, yet in recent
days there's this controversy on Capitol Hill concerning the
propriety of Senator Tower's alleged behavior, and questions raised
over the weekend about the financial arrangements on the private
funds of the man in charge of ethis, your counsel Boyden Gray, and
other questions involving members of the administration, or
members-to-be of the administration. And I wonder sir, what's
happened here? Is it too harsh behavior on our part, too lax
behavior on your part? What?
   A. I don't think anything has happened.
   I learned long ago in public life not to make judgments based on
allegations.
   But having said that, I want to have my administration aspire to
the highest possible ethical standards.
   And we have appointed a commission to go out there now and try to
detail what these standards should be.
   And we are in a new era on these matters; matters that might have
been approved and looked at one way may have a different perception
today.
   And, so, what I want to do is finalize our standards and then
urge everybody in all branches of government to aspire to those
standards.

   But I do think, Rick, that it's fair that we not reach judgment
on Senate hearings before the Senate hearings are concluded, because
it's very hard to filter out fact from fiction, spurious allegation
from fact.
   And I am not about to make a judgment based on a sensationalized
newspaper story.
   I'm simply not going to do that.
   That wouldn't be fair, and I'm not sure how ethical it would be.
   So let's wait and see.
   This _ you're referring to the Tower matter up there.
   That matter has been looked at by the FBI.
   The committee now has that.
   They have the responsibility to make determination.
   And I'll be very interested to see what they say.
   But I am not going to make conclusions _ jump to conclusions
based on stories that may or may not have any validity at all.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, even if, as your spokesman says you do, you
continue to back Senator Tower for the position, there are those,
you've heard, who say that the best thing he could do for you is to
step aside, because even if confirmed, he then would become
``damaged goods,'' weaker in administering, a very, very tough job
on your behalf. How do you respond to that suggestion?
   A. Well, I think people would not want a person to step aside,
given rumor, particularly if the rumor is baseless.
   And the process _ what _ the problem is the process is taking a
little longer than I would like, and yet, I think the Senate has got
to do what they're doing _ looking at these allegations very
carefully.
   But, you know, as I said here at this same podium a while back,
the American people are basically fair.
   And, if these allegations prove to be allegations without fact
behind them, I think the people are going to say, ``Wait a minute.
What went on here? How come it was all this _ we'd read this one
day, and then kind of a puff of smoke the next?''
   And, so, I don't think, in your substantive question though, that
if it proves _ if the Senate committee gives its endorsement to the
senator, particularly after all of these allegations, that there is
any danger at all of damage to his credibility or his ability to do
the job.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, there are new and substantive allegations that
Senator Tower lost control over the highly classified security
documents and computer disks that were used in Geneva under his
watch. If those allegations prove to be founded, would you then
withdraw his nomination?
   A. I would not answer hypothetical questions of that nature.
   You're telling me something that I haven't heard before.
   And, we did have access to FBI reports.
   So, if this matter is now before the Congress, let them
investigate it.
   But, I can't go into a hypothesis.
   All I would be doing would be adding to, I think, speculation
that is not helpful at this juncture.
   Q. But, sir, will you pursue these allegations in the executive
branch? Are you going to track what the FBI is looking into? Are you
going to personally surveil these kinds of allegations yourself?
   A. Every rumor and every innuendo? No.
   But, if you make _ if there's some substantive allegation of this
nature, of course it would concern me.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, back to S&amp;Ls, if we might. Millions _
(laughter) _ millions of Americans save alternatively. That is, they
put their funds in mutual funds, stocks, and that kind of thing. As
I read it, you've now outlined a plan that places a lot of the S&amp;L
bailout on the backs of the general treasury. How fair is that?
   A. We've got a major problem and something has to be done.
   And this is the fairest system that the best minds in this
administration can come up with.
   And, so, I'd _ I, again, would ask you to ask the specifics of
the treasury burden to the chairman of the Federal Reserve or the
secretary of the treasury.
   Ask how they see that.

   But, look, as I've said, there is no easy answer to this.
   All I want to do is make a sound proposal, work to put it into
effect, and have that proposal such that the country won't have to
face this problem again.
   Yes, Dave?
   Q. Mr. President, you said you dropped the deposit fee idea. But
this plan you've given us has an increase in premimums that may be
paid by consumers as well as a large amount of taxpayer's money.
Isn't that the same thing _ consumers and taxpayers are still going
to have to pay the price for this?
   A. Well, as I indicated earlier on, there is no guarantee of
passing this on to the consumer, nor is there a guarantee it won't
be passed on.
   But this arrangement has been there since _ for 50 years.
   And you might argue whether it's been passed on or not, I just
don't know; I haven't seen the flow-through in the industry.
   But nothing is without pain when you come to solve a problem of
this magnitude.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, you've talked to several members of Congress in
various receptions and dinners and personal conversations over the
past couple of weeks, in many of them you discussed your plan for
this problem. What is your feeling for the reception that it's going
to get on Capitol Hill and of the selling job that it will make you
have to get it passed?
   A. We may have a big selling job.
   But I've been encouraged so far with the spirit epitomized by the
members of Congress, particularly at the joint leadership meeting
the other day.
   We didn't go into every detail of this; these plans were still
being formulated and I wanted to get their views.
   I was encouraged by what Bill Seidman told me earlier on about
how he _ what he felt the receptivity of the plan will be.
   But I don't think it's fair to the Congress to say that they have
signaled to me that they are going to be enthusiastic on this plan,
although I hope they are.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President _
   A. I'm going to take about three more, and then turn this over to
these gentlemen here who are prepared to go into as much detail as
you want.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, on these allegations that surround Tower now,
at least variations on the theme surfaced early in the transition _
allegations of womanizing and taking money from defense contractors,
that sort of thing. Have you satisfied yourself that he is still the
nominee you want? And can you give us, at this time, a wholehearted
endorsement of Tower?
   A. Yes, I can, and I will right now, because some of the very
same allegations that were floated that long ago apparently have
been looked at and examined by the best possible examiners _ I'm
talking about the FBI _ and found to be groundless.
   So, therefore, I'm not about to change my view.
   Now if somebody comes up with facts, I hope I'm not narrow-minded
enough that I wouldn't take a look, but I am not going to deal in
the kinds of rumors that I've seen reported and then knocked down,
and then reported and then knocked down.
   Yes?

<HEAD>Barbara Bush's View of the White House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two weeks after moving into the most
prestigious home in America, Barbara Bush cannot conceal her
excitement.
   For starters, there's the collection of presidential china:
``Grover Cleveland at lunch today ... Abraham Lincoln yesterday. Can
you believe that?''
   There's more. ``The views are pretty spectacular,'' she says,
noting she can gaze directly at the Oval Office from her
second-floor office in the White House. ``See, I can see him right
there,'' Mrs. Bush says, pointing across the Rose Garden to the
office occupied by her husband, President Bush.
   In the Lincoln Bedroom, Mrs. Bush shows off a felt-covered frame
that contains one of only five copies of the Gettysburg Address.
``This is the only one signed and dated. You can read that. ...
Isn't that amazing?
   ``The Library of Congress man who was up here one day _ I showed
it to him and he looked absolutely green.''
   A canopy bed on the second-floor ``was where the four presidents
before Reagan slept,'' Mrs. Bush says as she leads a visitor on a
tour of the presidential residence. ``Pretty grand, huh?''
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Mrs. Bush said she
``felt right at home from the very first moment.''
   Her husband, she said, is ``exactly the same'' and has not
changed since moving up from vice president under Ronald Reagan.
However, she said everyone else has changed and ``everybody treats
you differently when you're president.''
   ``When you're vice president and certainly vice president's wife,
you get away with many more things than you do when you're
president,'' Mrs. Bush said. ``Everything you say becomes major and
it is major. He is the president of the United States.''
   She said her husband has an ``enormous job. ... Has he
philosophized about it? No. But he's absolutely determined to do the
best he can.
   ``I see my job as trying to take some of that pressure off him,''
Mrs. Bush said.
   ``I see that as my job ... to try to not talk about those
problems and also _ do not talk when he's working. I mean, I think
that's a big part of it,'' she said.
   ``Because he knows with me, I hope, that he can curl up with his
problems and study them and he's not going to have me badgering him
about something else.
   ``I really do not lobby George Bush,'' his wife said. ``I don't
lobby anyone.''
   A lot of people try to skirt regular channels and send letters
intended for the president to Mrs. Bush in hopes she'll pass it on.
``I just don't give them to him,'' she said.
   Despite the intense demands of his office, Bush does not seem
weighed down by the job, his wife said.
   ``I should tell you `yes' but no _ he sleeps like a baby,'' she
said. ``Because he knows he's human. I mean, he's been around the
presidency so long that I think he really feels he can do the best
job that can be done.''
   She said Bush awakens every morning about 6 a.m. and has coffee
and juice in bed while reading morning newspapers _ about five in
all _ and scanning the White House news summary. He also watches
morning television shows before leaving for the Oval Office about 7
a.m.
   Mrs. Bush said the president returns to the residence between 6
p.m. and 6:30 p.m. ``It's so much earlier (than when he was vice
president) because he doesn't have that drive home. I mean, it's
wonderful,'' the first lady said.
   Describing a typical evening at home, she said, ``We'd sit in our
little room, private room, watch the television, have dinner. Then
he'd go to his office and I'd go to mine, probably.''
   Most nights, she said, they use the china service from Woodrow
Wilson's presidency but ``we can do anything we want. Isn't that
fun?''
   She said Bush as president is working ``exactly the same''
routine he followed as vice president. ``I mean, George Bush was
born, I think, on this schedule.''
   Does he bring work home?
   ``Yes, he always has,'' his wife said. ``He does a lot of
reading. And he does an awful lot of personal writing. He brings
home mail, works on it. He gets his little briefcase sent up ahead,
full of work.''
   Typically, they go to bed between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m., Mrs. Bush
said. She said she walked their dog, Millie, at 10 p.m. on a recent
night. The president, suffering from what Mrs. Bush said was the
flu, ``was asleep at that moment.''

<HEAD>Broader Civil Rights Agenda with Reagan Gone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Affordable housing, the minimum wage and other
issues not tied directly to fighting racial bias are moving onto the
shopping list of civil rights forces as they gear up for the
post-Reagan era on Capitol Hill.
   ``The traditional notion of what a civil rights bill is is sort
of going through a change,'' says Jane O'Grady, a labor official and
legislative chairwoman of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.
   Issues that civil rights advocates group under the heading of
economic justice, often dealing with labor and welfare, are
prominent on the list.
   Civil rights for the disabled, legal services for the poor and
mandatory leave from work for parents of newborns and sick children
are all priorities for the Leadership Conference, an umbrella group
that takes in virtually the entire civil rights community.
   The new emphasis represents not so much a change in direction as
a return to issues that were largely ignored while civil rights
forces skirmished with the Reagan administration throughout much of
the 1980s.
   Not all of the new priorities are economic. For example, civil
rights advocates continue to press for easier voter registration and
they are preparing to fight English-only legislation that would bar
bilingual education programs for Hispanics.
   ``It is an aggressive and ambitious agenda,'' says Ralph Neas,
executive director of the Leadership Conference. ``But we are
confident that the 101st Congress will pass it. We hope that the
Bush administration will play a constructive role.''
   As usual, civil rights advocates are watching carefully to see if
President Bush will name federal judges inclined toward moderate
positions or hard-line conservatives who might challenge the legal
changes of the past three decades.
   Judicial nominations are always a chief concern of civil rights
groups. They count the defeat of outspoken conservative Robert Bork
for the Supreme Court as one of their most important victories of
the Reagan era.
   But the showdown over Bork represented only one in a series of
Capitol Hill victories for civil rights forces over the last eight
years.
   ``The Congress prevented the right wing from passing any major
items on its legislative agenda and, furthermore, the Congress
during the Reagan years passed many important civil rights
initiatives,'' says Neas.
   The conference points with pride to the success of last year's
bill to toughen fair housing enforcement, recent victories on South
Africa sanctions legislation and the Martin Luther King holiday,
plus the congressional override of President Reagan's veto of the
Civil Rights Restoration Act.
   That legislation came in response to the Supreme Court's Grove
City decision, in which the justices held that the government could
not deny federal aid to one program merely because of discrimination
in an unrelated program operated by the same institution.
   In fact, Congress has passed so many measures urged by civil
rights advocates that they now say some of the most pressing needs
lie outside the legislative arena. That is especially so with the
departure of Edwin Meese III as attorney general and William
Bradford Reynolds, the longtime head of the civil rights division in
the Reagan Justice Department.
   A recent report from the Citizens Commission on Civil Rights, a
17-member panel of former federal officials, was sharply critical of
the department's enforcement record in the Reagan era.
   It said, for example, that the Reagan Justice Department filed
about 10 housing bias cases annually, half the number under the
Nixon and Carter administrations.
   ``I think the question of enforcement of civil rights laws will
be stronger, because I think that with Reagan gone, there will be no
great voice of weakening,'' says Benjamin Hooks, executive director
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
and chairman of the Leadership Conference.
   There may be some reluctance to move forward with civil rights
legislation until President Bush indicates what he might accept.
   ``I think that's just a sensible thing to do,'' says Rep. Don
Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's civil
rights and civil liberties subcommittee.
   Meanwhile, he envisions hearings in the year ahead to determine
just how well the existing civil rights laws are being enforced.
Additional sessions of his panel will take up the long-festering
question of whether college entrance examinations are skewed toward
whites and thus place minority students at an unfair disadvantage.
   The Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which would
ban discrimination on the basis of gender, remains a cause dear to
women's groups and many civil rights advocates. Edwards says,
however, that the measure will not be brought to the floor unless
there is enough support to pass it.

   President Bush defended the ethical conduct of
high-ranking officials in his administration Monday but said he
might have to tighten standards and make ``our people bend over
backwards'' so they avoid even the appearance of conflict of
interest.
   Bush's statement came as C. Boyden Gray, his longtime counsel and
chief ethics adviser, reversed an earlier decision and resigned as
chairman of a multimillion-dollar communications company.
   Last week, Dr. Louis Sullivan, the president's nominee as
secretary of health and human services, asked if he could take a
paid sabbatical leave from the Morehouse College School of Medicine
while serving in the Cabinet. Sullivan said later he would forfeit
his accumulated sabbatical pay, estimated at $300,000.
   Bush said both officials had acted properly and gone beyond what
was actually required.
   The president also defended former Sen. John Tower of Texas, his
nominee to be secretary of defense, against new allegations of
womanizing and drinking, as well as other matters. Asked if would
still endorse Tower, Bush said, ``Yes, I can and I will right now.''
   He said some of the allegations about Tower have been examined by
the FBI and found to be groundless. However, Bush said, ``If
somebody comes up with facts, I hope I'm not narrow-minded enough
that I wouldn't take another look.''
   Bush said all of Gray's actions had been reviewed and approved by
the Office of Government Ethics as he served for eight years as
Bush's counsel during his vice presidency.
   However, Bush said, ``We are in a new era on these matters.
Matters that might have been approved and looked at one way, may
have a different perception today. ... So, I think it might be
different now. I have to approach it differently as president.''
   Bush said that when it comes to the appearance of conflict of
interest, ``I'd like our people to bend over backwards ... as far as
we possibly can.''
   On the other hand, Bush said he didn't want to go overboard.
   ``I don't want to have the standards set in such an irresponsible
way that good people just throw up their hands and say, `Look, who
needs that kind f grief, who needs it, why should I have to give up
all my whatever it is _ a health plan from XYZ company?'
   ``And yet,'' he added, ``we're in a different time now. We're in
a time when we've got to set these standards as high as possible.''
   Spurred by publicity about his finances, Gray announced he was
stepping down as chairman of the family-owned Summit Communications
Group, Inc., and putting his personal assets _ estimated at $10
million _ into a blind trust.
   The Office of Government Ethics is investigating whether Gray
should have reported $89,000 in income from the company in 1985 and
1986, The New York Times reported in Tuesday's editions.
   A reporter for the newspaper had raised the issue Monday, and the
office said later in the day that it was investigating, the Times
said. Gray did not return a telephone call from the reporter seeking
comment on why the money was not reported, the Times said.
   Gray deferred receiving the income, his financial adviser John
Sheets told the Times. But deferred income had to be reported in the
year it is earned, said Donald Campbell, deputy director of the
ethics office, according to the newspaper.
   Earlier, Gray had said he would remain as head of the firm but
would refuse a salary, complying with rules announced by Bush last
July during the presidential campaign. Gray changed his mind and
decided to resign after consulting with the leaders of Bush's new
ethics commission and seeing his financial background become
front-page news.
   ``He has done nothing wrong,'' said White House press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater. ``There's been no conflict of interest. He has not
profited or benefited in any way from his government service but the
issue has been raised now in the press and so he simply wanted to
take care of it.''
   Gray is the latest Bush appointee to find himself in the
spotlight after questions about his ethical or personal conduct.
   Allegations about drinking and womanizing by Tower resulted in a
delay on a confirmation vote by the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   Sullivan sought a ruling on whether he could accept $300,000 in
sabbatical pay earned as head of the Morehouse School of Medicine
while taking a leave to serve in the Cabinet. Saying he wanted to
avoid even the appearance of any conflict of interest, Sullivan said
he would forfeit the sabbatical pay.
   Rejecting the notion the Bush administration was having problems
with ethics, Fitzwater said, ``It's the president's spotlight of
focus on this matter that's caused everyone to be so ultrasensitive
about every little thing. And so be it.''
   Talking about Gray and Sullivan, Fitzwater said, ``There was no
real problem in either case but to avoid the appearance of conflict
and to get on with the business, they said, `Fine, do it.'''
   He said Gray's decision was prompted in part by stories in The
New York Times and Washington Post which noted that the Reagan White
House had a policy banning employees from serving in board
chairmanships and from earning outside income. ``Rather than try to
let that fester, you simply deal with it and go on,'' Fitzwater said.
   Although Gray worked in the Reagan administration, he was not
bound by those rules because he was employed by then-Vice President
Bush, whose policy was more lenient.
   Over the past eight years, Gray was paid hundreds of thousands of
dollars for serving as chairman of the company that owns more at
least a dozen radio stations and has about 130,000 cable television
subscribers in the South.

<HEAD>Diplomatic Stalemate Dims Hopes For Getting MIA Remains From Cambodia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year ago, the hopes of families of U.S.
servicemen shot down over Cambodia during the Vietnam War were
buoyed by Phnom Penh's declaration that it was prepared to hand over
the remains of 83 airmen to American officials.
   But a diplomatic stalemate, which some congressmen blame largely
on State Department inaction, has prevented the return of the bodies
and dimmed hopes for a return any time soon.
   ``They've made these gestures in the last year to turn remains
over and so far the good faith hasn't been followed up on,'' said
Rep. John G. Rowland, R-Conn. ``There's (the remains of) 80 American
soldiers over there ... and we're tripping over bureaucracy.''
   During a January 1988 trip to Southeast Asia, Reps. Robert C.
Smith, R-N.H., Frank McCloskey, D-Ind., and Rowland were told by Tep
Henn, Cambodia's ambassador to Vietnam, that the Cambodian
government had the bodies of the American servicemen and would
return them to U.S. officials. The condition: the administration
would have to make the request directly.
   The lawmakers lobbied the State Department and enlisted the help
of senior legislators, including the late Rep. Bill Nichols, D-Ala.,
chairman of the House Armed Services investigations subcommittee.
   But the administration agreed only to send a message through a
third party, the International Red Cross. The United States does not
recognize the Cambodian regime of Premier Hun Sen, installed by
Vietnam after Pol Pot and his brutal Khmer Rouge regime were driven
from power by Vietnamese forces in late 1978.
   ``We do not have diplomatic relations (with Phnom Penh) and we
don't recognize it, so any diplomatic approach would be
inappropriate,'' said Alex Almasov, an east Asian specialist at the
State Department.
   The congressional critics point to diplomatic contact with
Vietnam over soldiers missing-in-action there.
   ``We don't recognize Vietnam but we're constantly interacting
with them,'' Rowland said. ``Half the Congress has been over there''
as well as special U.S. emissaries.
   ``We've picked up remains from Libya and they're not exactly our
friends either,'' he said. ``We allowed them to get some political
mileage.''
   While Cambodia is essentially a satellite of Vietnam, diplomatic
contact with Phnom Penh is a more delicate matter than dealing with
Hanoi, which is largely accepted despite the lack of diplomatic ties.
   In Cambodia, three rebel groups including the Khmer Rouge headed
by Pol Pot and two others supported by U.S. aid have been fighting
to overthrow the Vietnam-installed government. With Vietnam's pledge
to withdraw its troops from Cambodia, Hun Sen is desperately seeking
legitimacy for his government. Earlier this year he visited Bangkok
for the first time for negotiations with Thai leaders to seek a
resolution to the 10-year conflict.
   State Department officials fear that the Phnom Penh government
would simply use U.S. contact over the MIA issue as a political tool.
   ``Obviously what the Phnom Penh regime wants from us is some sort
of diplomatic approach that would confer some sort of legitimacy on
them,'' Almasov said. ``Since we feel the MIA issue is a
humanitarian one and since we have made it clear that we are
prepared at any time to receive the remains they say they have, we
feel they should respond positively.''
   The GOP congressmen say they are well aware of Hun Sen's
political motivations, but they believe that direct contact over the
remains alone would not seriously affect American foreign policy in
Southeast Asia.
   ``I have no desire to build him up and give him credibility ...
but my God, we have to be willing to at least talk to the people,''
Smith said.
   He added that State Department officials ``think it will shake
our credibility in the region and insult Indonesia and Thailand. I
don't.''
   The congressmen believe Phnom Penh is genuinely willing to turn
over the remains.
   ``They have clearly seen the positive exposure Vietnam has gotten
by turning remains over. I think they would like to duplicate
that,'' Rowland said.
   Hun Sen recently reiterated his willingness to discuss the MIA
issue with U.S. officials. But Rowland predicted that Cambodian
leaders would hold out for direct U.S. contact so they can ``get
more bang for their effort.''

   President Bush will meet in Tokyo later this
month with King Hussein of Jordan and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, and then at the White House in the spring with them and
Israel Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, according to State Department
officials.
   The Tokyo talks will be held when Bush and the two Arab leaders
attend the funeral of Emperor Hirohito of Japan. Details of the
separate visits to Washington by Hussein, Mubarak and Shamir will be
worked out over the next few weeks, U.S. officials speaking on
condition of anonymity said Sunday.
   The main topics are the future of restive Palestinians on the
Israeli-held West Bank and in Gaza, and the role the United States
will try to play in settling the 40-year-old Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Hirohito's funeral, which will draw scores of world leaders to
Tokyo, is accelerating Bush's introduction to murky Middle East
diplomacy. U.S. policy is now under review by the new
administration, but Secretary of State James Baker III said at his
confirmation hearing last month that he is opposed to the
establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
   Hussein, Mubarak and Shamir all notified the new administration
separately that they would like to visit Washington in the spring,
which could drive Bush to an early decision on how to approach the
Palestinian problem and Israel's troubles with its Arab neighbors.
   After a slow start, the Reagan administration tried to steer
Israel and Lebanon toward a peace settlement, but that was undercut
by Syria. The administration then tried to set up Arab-Israeli
negotiations, but despite four trips to the region by former
Secretary of State George Shultz, the effort failed. Shamir and
Hussein both rejected U.S. proposals for peace talks while Yasser
Arafat, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization, kept
Palestinians from meeting with Shultz.
   In one of its final acts, the Reagan administration broke a
13-year freeze and opened talks with the PLO, but there are no
indications this has improved prospects for a settlement or an
easing of violence in the Israeli-held territories.
   Hussein, Mubarak and Shamir would make separate visits to
Washington. The State Department officials said they all asked to be
received in the spring and timetables were being worked out.
   Administration officials on Jan. 28 opened informal talks with
Congress on possible arms sales to Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Israel.
There were no items on the list for Jordan, which Congress since
1985 has excluded until the kingdom shows willingness to negotiate
with Israel, to whom it lost the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war.
   Jordanian Prime Minister Zaid Rifai was asked in an interview
published Sunday in the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Watan whether he
thought the United States would offer a new Middle East peace
initiative.
   ``We're fed up with initiatives,'' Rifai said. ``The basis for a
settlement and the solutions are there, and agreed upon
internationally, with the exception of the Israeli stance. And
regrettably they (Israel) are supported by the American stance.''

   John White was chairman of the Democratic Party
when he first got to know Ron Brown and Paul Kirk. ``They were
around the office all the time, mostly with a press release
demanding my resignation.''
   White, a sandy-haired Texan, was Jimmy Carter's handpicked choice
to head the party.
   Brown and Kirk were aides to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy who was
opposing the incumbent president's bid for renomination.
   This was down and dirty, no-holds-barred politics. ``I'll whip
his ass,'' the president of the United States had said of the
Massachusetts senator who bore one of the most famous names in
American politics.
   But White was an old pro and Brown and Kirk were budding young
pros.
   ``Hell, they were so nice about it, I just got so I would invite
them in for a cup of coffee,'' recalled White. ``We just got to
where we liked each other. I knew what they were doing and they knew
what I was doing.''
   Six years later, Kirk became Democratic Party chairman and on
Friday the 47-year-old Brown will succeed him in that post. That
transition will take place when the Democratic National Committee
meets at a Washington hotel a few miles from the White House, a
building where only one Democrat has resided during the past 20
years.
   When Brown began his quest for the chairmanship his opponents
portrayed him as ``Jesse's man,'' a reference to his role in Jesse
Jackson's presidential campaign.
   And if not Jesse's man, then ``Teddy's man,'' a reference to his
earlier involvement with Kennedy.
   ``Ultra liberal,'' was the assessment of the Alabama party
chairman. The wrong symbol, said many party officials, at a time
when the electorate seemed more comfortable with conservative views.
   Yet, none of that criticism stuck and one by one Brown's four
opponents in the chairmanship race dropped out and endorsed him.
   In part, he succeeded because the only label that has stuck
firmly on Brown is ``Washington insider.''
   ``He's nobody's man but his own,'' said Kennedy. ``Ron could say
no to me or to Jesse Jackson or to anyone else if he believed that
whatever was requested wasn't in the interests of the party.''
   From his childhood, Brown has bridged two very different worlds.
He grew up in Harlem, but his parents sent him to predominantly
white private schools on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
   He attended Middlebury College in Vermont where he was one of
only a handful of black students. When he joined Sigma Phi Epsilon
fraternity, the house was stripped of its national membership for
violating the whites-only charter.
   At St. John's University Law School, one of his professors was
Mario Cuomo.
   Brown ran the Washington office of the Urban League before
joining Kennedy's staff and becoming a senior aide on his
presidential campaign. Later, he became general counsel of the
Senate Judiciary Committee which Kennedy chaired.
   Big-time, big-money law beckoned and Brown now is a partner in
one of the capital's biggest, most politically active firms.
   That was the period he also became deputy chairman of the
Democratic National Committee. Once again, he was seen as ``Teddy's
man'' at the DNC, the party official who would look after the
senator's interests in advance of the 1984 presidential campaign.
   Chuck Campion was at the DNC as Walter Mondale's man. Campion
recalled that instead of becoming rivals they became friends _ an
outcome typical of Brown's career.
   His law practice prospered with clients that included the
Japanese electronics industry and the government of Haiti. So did
his establishment credentials. He is a member of the Middlebury
Board of Trustees and chairman of the advisory committee for the
Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.
   During a visit to Middlebury last fall, a student asked Brown for
advice on pursuing a political career.
   His response offered an insight to his careful operating style:
   ``Keep a diary. Write down the names of people you meet and then
keep track of them. Remember them when you meet them again.
Connections are important.''
   A little ironic coming from a man whose connections were used
against him in his most prominent effort to strike out on his own in
politics.
   When Kennedy didn't run in 1984, Brown stayed on the sidelines.
That was the campaign in which Jackson emerged as a force in
Democratic Party politics.
   Four years later, Jackson was rebuffed when he tried to get Brown
to head his 1988 presidential campaign.
   As the campaign approached the end of the primary season, the
Jackson forces began looking ahead to the Democratic National
Convention that would take place in Atlanta in July. It was clear
that Michael Dukakis would be the presidential nominee, but Jackson
and his followers had a full agenda.
   Jim Hightower, the populist agriculture commissioner from Texas,
was the choice of Jackson aides to head their convention operation.
   But then Ann Lewis, a top adviser to Jackson, suggested Brown.
   ``Ron knew the players and knew the territory; Jim didn't,'' said
White, who also was advising Jackson.
   To the relief of most Democrats, Brown agreed to take on the job.
   ``There was a rather tense atmosphere going into the
convention,'' recalled Paul Brountas, chairman of the Dukakis
campaign. ``The Reverend Jackson had started a bus caravan in
Chicago which picked up speed and people on the way to the
convention _ this was after several weeks where Reverend Jackson was
hitting Dukakis pretty hard, building an expectation that Jackson
deserved more than he had received.
   ``None of that created an environment which assured any kind of
unity,'' Brountas said.
   Brown and Brountas met privately on the Saturday before the
convention and the Jackson aide showed up with a list of his
concerns.
   By the time their meeting ended, Brountas said, ``I understood
where he was coming from and I was able to respond to most of them
and give an indication where I was coming from.''
   There would be more meetings including one that included Dukakis
and Jackson. The result was a convention that ended on a note of
harmony.
   During his visit to Middlebury, Brown said the Jackson candidacy
showed that ``the issue of race has become less of a factor in
American politics.''
   Brown's accession to the chairmanship of his party may confirm
that assessment _ or may offer new evidence of how strong a factor
race continues to be.

<HEAD>Drug Czar Assesses the Problem in Detroit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug czar-designate William J. Bennett took a
close look at ``the heart of the problem'' with a two-hour tour of
Detroit, a visit that ``underlined the urgency of working fast to
make things better.''
   ``We have a deadly serious issue on our hands,'' he said Sunday
in a telephone interview from the Detroit airport. ``It's
compelling. This was fact-finding for me, very preliminary, to find
out what people on the ground are facing.
   ``They emphasized what I was looking at was the heart of the
problem,'' he said. ``Downtown Detroit is as bad as it gets
anywhere.''
   Last year, Detroit recorded 629 homicides, an 8.3 percent drop
from the 686 homicides in 1987, according to city police statistics.
The city figures did not indicate how many of them were drug-related.
   An analysis of FBI crime statistics by the Detroit Free Press
showed Washington was the only city last year with a higher ratio of
murders per 100,000 people.
   The visit didn't result in any specific plans for how the war
against drugs should be waged or how he should handle his new job,
said Bennett, who has been nominated by President Bush to become
director of national drug control policy.
   ``I've got to work all parts of it,'' he said. ``What I saw today
only underlined the urgency of working fast to make things better.
It must get better.''
   Detroit Police Cmdr. Joel Gilliam told him, ``One index showing
we are winning the battle will be when the price goes up and purity
goes down, but prices are down and purity is up,'' Bennett recalled.
   Whether drug trafficking was going on during the tour was a
matter of opinion. Bennett said he didn't see any. But the officers
accompanying him _ Gilliam, who is chief of staff to Detroit Police
Chief William Hart, and Sgt. Bruce Ford _ said they did.
   ``My eyes aren't sufficiently expert, discerning yet'' to spot
the drug deals, he said. ``It was also Sunday afternoon, not
Saturday night.''
   Bennett deferred questions on what the drug budget should be,
saying that six months after he is confirmed by the Senate _
hearings begin March 1 _ he will have completed a national drug
strategy and ``that will have budget implications.''
   He said he plans additional fact-finding tours, but he refused to
disclose which cities he might visit.
   Bennett went to Detroit because of a speaking engagement at
Cranbrook School, a private school in the wealthy suburb of
Bloomfield Hills, Mich. The talk had been scheduled before Bush
nominated him to the drug czar post.
   ``I told them when I got to the podium that I've just been in
downtown Detroit and now I'm in one of the loveliest places in
America. I feel like I'm getting the bends.''

<TEXT>
   Cutting into line at a bus stop or into
a ticket line at a subway or train station is now punishable by fine
in South Korea.
   So is displaying ``visibly unpleasant living things'' such as
snakes or worms for sale on the street.
   The formerly simply discourteous, or distasteful, practices are
on a new list of petty offenses _ with transgressors subject to an
official warning and a $5.75 fine. The new list was released last
weekend by the National Assembly and its additions are expected to
become law.
   Other new offenses include luring customers to buy ``supernatural
potions'' by claiming they can cure and prevent illness.
   Also new to the list of 21 petty offenses is disobeying officials
in times of emergency, such as a snowstorm, fire or traffic
accident, and neglecting one's duty for public safety, such as
making sure street lamps are turned on.
   Turning off lights at public gatherings and failing to repair a
house that is dangerous to passersby, or a structure that may fall
over, will draw also fines.

   It's a mail carrier's nightmare, a magazine
lover's delight. Someone is ordering magazine subscriptions by the
dozens for five city officials in this increasingly literate
northern Ohio town.
   ``It's pretty entertaining,'' said city Service Director Charles
Ramer, who has received 70 subscriptions from the anonymous donor.
``There is always something to read. ... There are a lot of
magazines that I never knew existed.''
   Although some of the magazines have been obscure, most are fairly
well-known. They include Time, Popular Photography, Working Woman,
People, Sassy, Men's Health, Life, Consumer Reports, and Ladies'
Home Journal.
   ``If the magazines had been weird magazines, I would have been
more concerned, but they weren't,'' said Mayor William Lamb, who's
received about a dozen subscriptions.
   The officials have asked the magazines' publishers to cancel the
subscriptions, and in most cases the companies have complied.
   Some magazines have arrived with cards telling the new and
surprised reader that the subscription is a gift. For example, City
Council President Wilda Bell got a card saying Lamb had given her a
subscription.
   ``It's a nuisance,'' said Lamb, who later was billed for the
subscription. ``People keep coming up to me and thanking me for
sending them a magazine, and I have to tell them that I didn't send
it. ... I like Wilda, but not $109 worth.''

   As gingerbread men go, the one at Kinsley's
Market in nearby Brodheadsville is very big.
   But at 12 feet tall, it's not big enough for the Guinness Book of
World Records. And if it were big enough, it still wouldn't make the
book because Guinness doesn't have a category for gingerbread men.
   ``It's disappointing to us,'' said Kathy Lockwitch, assistant
manager at Kinsley's bakery. ``If we would have known, we would have
attempted something else or we wouldn't have bothered.''
   Lockwitch said bakery manager Jerry Laiso called Guinness before
he and Lockwitch made the giant cookie. She says he was told that
Guinness would consider their claim after they had made their
gingerbread man.
   But Cyd Smith, assistant editor at Guinness, said she told a
Kinsley employee that there was no category for a gingerbread man
and little chance that Guinness would add the category.
   ``People sometimes don't want to hear what you're saying,'' she
said. ``They don't want to hear, `No,' because they're determined to
do their thing.''
   It took 300 pounds of gingerbread mix, 280 pounds of icing, 600
egg whites and nearly 100 hours to create the giant cookie. ``With
all the attention and publicity we got, we thought we were in,''
Lockwitch said.
   But late last month, Kinsley's received a letter from Guiness
explaining the book's position. Adding insult to injury, the letter
added that Kinsley's had no claim on the world record anyway because
a chef in Buffalo, N.Y., created a 24-foot gingerbread man in 1987.

<HEAD>Arrests In Amish Robberies In Tennessee Soothe Outraged Residents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN GEORGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAWRENCEBURG, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents are expressing relief
because of the arrests of five people who are accused of holding up
Amish farmers at gunpoint as they milked cows, drove buggies or made
harnesses.
   ``Two of these men have confessed, and we've recovered some of
the billfolds taken in the holdups,'' said Lawrence County Sheriff
Tom Pyrdum. ``I feel we've got all the people involved.''
   For many folks, life here centers on a job at the Murray-Ohio
bicycle plant, the community's largest employer, or raising cattle
and growing soybeans and corn.
   They picnic at the David Crockett State Park, named for the Alamo
hero whose presence permeates this town of 12,000 in the Tennessee
hills south of Nashville. A statue honoring Crockett, who once
operated a gristmill here, stands in the heart of downtown, and
billboards extol the David Crockett Motel and Mini-Warehouses.
   The town typically is so peaceful that it attracted a group of
Amish who left Pennsylvania in the winter of 1944.
   But that serenity was shattered last month when armed robbers
began sticking up the Amish as they milked cows in barns or drove
their buggies.
   The holdups began Jan. 22 when two Amish farmers were robbed of
$85 by three armed men in masks and camouflage outfits who burst
into a barn in nearby Ethridge.
   Five days later, three Amish men were robbed of about $140 in two
separate holdups when a man leaped into their buggies, brandished a
gun and demanded cash.
   On Jan. 30, two men, one of them carrying a sawed-off shotgun,
took $300 from an Amish harnessmaker as he worked in his shop on a
farm north of Ethridge.
   Residents were outraged by the robberies.
   ``The people who live here know the (Amish) and do business with
them,'' said District Attorney General Mike Bottoms. ``They don't
ever cause anybody any trouble. ... They mind their own business and
raise their families.''
   The Amish, a conservative offshoot of the Mennonite Church, are
noted for a lifestyle that's dogmatic in its simplicity.
   The women wear long dresses and bonnets; the men black, round
hats, with dark blue jackets and pants. They disdain buttons as a
sign of vanity.
   Among themselves, they still speak German, accounting for a
persistent accent in their English. They refuse to own telephones or
automobiles, although they will ride buses or occasionally in a car.
   And they believe in non-violence, which authorities said has made
them easy prey for bandits.
   ``People don't like to see the Amish picked on,'' said Bob Moore,
who works for the Lawrence County Ambulance Service. ``At the same
time, it makes people angry that they don't do anything to fight
back.''
   The recent holdups, as well as the unsolved Jan. 29 robbery and
stabbing death of an elderly non-Amish man in Ethridge, prompted
Pyrdum's investigators to work around the clock.
   The break came, Pyrdum said, when they were able to link a
partial license plate number to the description of a pickup truck
used in the harness shop robbery.
   On Thursday, deputies arrested Michael McConnell, 24, and his
nephews, Rodney J.D. Smith, 18, and James E. Smith Jr., 22, all from
Lawrenceburg, and charged them with various counts of armed robbery.
Each was being held on $250,000 bond.
   Two Lawrenceburg juveniles, ages 16 and 17, also were arrested.
Bottoms said the state has filed a motion to have them tried as
adults.
   Although the Amish have been reluctant in the past to file
charges, neither Pyrdum nor Bottoms said they expect any problem
bringing the case to trial.
   ``We don't have a lot of cases with the (Amish), but when we do
they'll come and testify truthfully,'' said Bottoms. ``I don't have
any doubt that they'll continue to cooperate with us.''
   The arrests brought a welcome sense of relief to the Amish,
although many were reticent.
   ``I'm glad they were caught. It was correct to assist the
sheriff's department in order to stop the robbing,'' said a
67-year-old Amish farmer who spoke on the condition that his name
not be used.

   Ballerina Natalia Makarova says her first trip to
the Soviet Union since defecting 19 years ago was better than she
could have dreamed, despite the sadness of having to leave her
mother again.
   ``The welcome I received was beyond any expectation. It couldn't
even have been like that in my dreams,'' Makarova said on her
arrival Sunday at Heathrow Airport.
   The 48-year-old ballerina defected in 1970 to perform modern
dances not staged in the Soviet Union. During her two-week visit,
she appeared in her native Leningrad three times with the Kirov
Ballet, where she rose to fame in the 1950s and '60s.
   Makarova also saw her mother for the first time since defecting.
``It was sad in the end because I had to leave. But I live in hope
that we will see each other again,'' she said.

   Hedda Nussbaum, the battered former companion of
convicted child killer Joel Steinberg, says she wants to ``reach out
and help battered women.''
   ``I hope I've begun to do that,'' Ms. Nussbaum was quoted as
saying in this week's People magazine. ``I've gotten over a hundred
letters of support; only three of them were negative.''
   Ms. Nussbaum related her comments to Naomi Weiss, a former
college classmate who got in touch with her several months after
Lisa Steinberg, Ms. Nussbaum's 6-year-old illegally adopted
daughter, died in November 1987.
   Ms. Nussbaum was the prosecution's star witness against
Steinberg, testifying that the disbarred attorney beat her and Lisa.
But Ms. Nussbaum's credibility was questioned by jurors, who last
week convicted Steinberg of manslaughter but acquitted him of
second-degree murder.
   Ms. Nussbaum said her advice to battered women is to get out
before there is a tragedy, even though she doubts she would have
listened to such advice herself.
   ``You never think it can happen to you. I still don't really
understand how it did,'' she said.

   Former University of Georgia football coach
Vince Dooley says he has decided against running for governor after
getting a brief taste of life on the campaign trail.
   ``I was getting pretty tired, speaking at a breakfast, a lunch, a
dinner _ waking up (to) another lunch, another dinner,'' Dooley said
at a news conference Sunday. ``I started to wonder, `Do I really
want to do this?'''
   Instead, Dooley said he will remain as the university's athletic
director, a position he has held since 1979.
   Dooley announced in December he was stepping down as football
coach after 25 years and was considering entering the 1990
gubernatorial race. He had met with political consultants and
reportedly was assembling a campaign organization.
   Dooley, 56, said he began having doubts a few weeks ago about
waging a campaign.

   Pravda reported that the last Soviet
soldier had left the capital, but several hundred Red Army troops
guarded Kabul's airport on Monday as military transports flew in
grain and other supplies.
   The Communist Party daily also reported that Soviet troops would
move Monday out of the main military complex at Shindand, in western
Afghanistan. The paper said Soviet defensive checkpoints along the
withdrawal route from the capital had been removed as far as 50
miles north of Kabul.
   ``Yesterday, the last Soviet soldier left Kabul,'' Pravda said in
Monday's report.
   However, several hundred Soviet soldiers were seen at the airport
today. Soviet officials said about 1,000 Soviet soldiers were still
at the airport on the outskirts of the city.
   They said the last convoy left the capital on Saturday.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
troops at the airport are assisting the supply airlift into the city
and are not expected to pull out until Feb. 12 or Feb. 14.
   The officials said troops were still moving up the Salang
Highway, the only land route north from Kabul to the Soviet border.
They said the troop movement was slow and there had been avalanches
and some casualties, but no rebel attacks.
   On Sunday, Radio Moscow quoted the commander of Soviet forces in
Afghanistan, Gen. Boris Gromov, as saying the withdrawal was
proceeding according to schedule.
   ``He said that the column of Soviet troops did not come under
fire. ... There were snow slides during the withdrawal, though, and
three men were killed and one was injured by them,'' the radio
reported.
   In Kabul on Sunday, President Najib told about 10,000 members of
the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan that his Marxist
government will survive the rebel onslaught despite the Soviet
pullout after more than nine years of occupation.
   ``God is with us. The people are with us. We will win the war,''
Najib told about 10,000 members of the People's Democratic Party of
Afghanistan, who gathered in freezing temperatures near the
presidential palace.
   Soviet and Afghan officials said during the weekend there were
about 1,000 Soviet soldiers still in Afghanistan and that they could
be gone as early as Wednesday.
   In neighboring Pakistan, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze extended talks on the civil war. Guerrilla sources said
he would meet Monday with the Moslem insurgents fighting the
Soviet-backed Afghan government.
   Leaders of the Iran- and Pakistan-based resistance signed a
cooperation pact Sunday in the Iranian capital, Iran's foreign
minister, Ali Akbar Velayati said. The agreement could boost the
guerrillas' chances of taking over in Afghanistan and creating an
Islamic republic once the Soviets are gone.
   Najib's rally, broadcast on national television, was staged
largely for the dozens of foreign journalists in Afghanistan for the
Soviet withdrawal.
   ``The Russian armies are leaving the country and we will defend
ourselves,'' said the 43-year-old Najib, dressed in combat fatigues.
``We have to be strong. We have to unite.''
   As he spoke, more than a dozen giant Soviet transport planes
streaked off in different directions, spewing flares designed to
deflect heat-seeking missiles fired by the guerrillas, or mujahedeen.
   The Soviet Union sent troops into Afghanistan in December 1979 to
replace one Marxist regime with another and stayed to help fight the
U.S.- and Pakistani-backed insurgents.
   Under a U.N.-mediated agreement, Moscow agreed last year to
withdraw all its troops out by Feb. 15.
   The Soviets began their pullout in May and resumed it January,
when convoys of tanks, trucks and armored personnel carriers started
heading up the Salang Highway toward the Soviet border 260 miles
away.
   The Pravda report said that in the western sector, two columns
had left Shindand heading towards Kushka on the Soviet border.
   ``On Feb. 6, Soviet units will leave shindand,'' Pravda said.
   ``On Monday, the first meeting to welcome the columns crossing to
the Soviet bank will take place in Termez in southern Uzbekistan''
it said.
   The guerrilla leaders began arriving in Islamabad, Pakistan, on
Sunday night to confer before meeting with Shevardnadze, guerrilla
sources said.
   Velayati refused to give details of the guerrilla accord signed
in Iran. The Afghan guerrillas are split into two groups: the
minority Shiite alliance, based in Iran, and the larger Sunni
coalition in Pakistan.
   ``They finally signed an agreement for cooperation about a future
government for Afghanistan,'' he told The Associated Press.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
said it was believed the two groups agreed on the number of seats
that will be offered in the 480-member Shura assembly to Shiite
representatives.

<HEAD>Antarctic Oil Spill Creates ``The Experiment Nobody Wanted''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After decades of studying wildlife in an
unspoiled area of Antarctica, scientists have begun a new, unwelcome
line of research: the effects of an oil spill.
   ``This disaster is the experiment nobody wanted,'' said National
Science Foundation spokesman Jack Talmadge.
   By Tuesday, American cleanup crews are expected to reach the area
affected by the sinking of an oil-laden supply ship, which ran
aground Jan. 28 off the Antarctic Peninsula.
   Scientists have already seen oil-covered and apparently lethargic
seals, three dead penguins and disappearances of young nesting
birds, said Ted DeLaca, chief scientist of the foundation's division
of polar programs.
   Thirty-eight of 40 penguins checked Friday bore traces of oil.
Thousands of dead and dying krill, shrimplike crustaceans that are a
key food for bigger animals, have shown up on beaches, DeLaca told
reporters by telephone from Palmer Station, a research outpost near
the spill.
   ``All the principle (penguin) rookeries here are now surrounded
by fuel oil,'' he said. ``What its effect could be on the birds is
anybody's guess.''
   Adelie penguin chicks are expected to leave their nests for the
first time in a few days, swimming into contaminated waters. Other
birds are being exposed to the oil as they land on water or dive
into it to feed.
   Scientists are concerned that birds may freeze to death if the
oil disrupts their natural insulation, or be poisoned if they
swallow oil while preening themselves or eating oil-covered prey.
   The spill struck an area that has ``the largest and most diverse
plant and animal populations of the continent,'' said Polly Penhale,
manager of the science foundation's polar biology and medicine
program.
   Apart from the large seal population, about 30,000 sea birds live
there, including Adelie and chinstrap penguins, cormorants, kelp
gulls and giant petrels, she said.
   Scientists have studied wildlife in the area for more than 20
years, but now the pristine nature of the area has been altered.
   ``The paths of research that have been followed down there have
been forever changed,'' said Talmadge. ``I think if you're a
scientist in the year 2035, you've got to remember there was an oil
spill.''
   DeLaca said the highly sensitive environment ``has been
compromised in a way that we can't even evaluate right now.''
   Langdon Quetin, research biologist at the University of
California in Santa Barbara, said if the oil spill causes dramatic
damage or long-term effects on plants and animals, ``then we can't
really depend on the area as a natural uncontaminated laboratory.''
   ``That really is unfortunate, to say the least, because it is one
of the few areas in the Antarctic we have good logistics to,'' he
said. ``It will be the ruination of a good laboratory, at least in
the near future, at least as a natural uncontaminated study area.''
   Some scientists are particularly concerned about fish and other
organisms kept in tanks at Palmer Station, which marine botanist
Mike Neushul of the University of California at Santa Barbara calls
``probably the best marine biology laboratory in the Antarctic.''
   The tanks draw water from the nearby harbor, and if oil
contaminates that supply, the experiments might have to be stopped.
Nobody knows yet whether that will be a problem, Penhale said.
   Neushul said one factor boding poorly for the area's wildlife is
that the spill involved fuel oil, which is ``much more toxic than
crude oil'' because it can damage biological tissue.
   Neushul, who investigated a spill of partially refined oil off
the Baja California coast some 30 years ago, said the effects of
that spill lasted 17 years.
   In addition, recovery in Antarctica may be prolonged because
bacteria there will need a long time to break the oil down, said
Paul Dayton, professor of marine ecology at the Scripps Institute of
Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif.

   The road to Kabul is littered
with burned-out Afghan army tanks, trucks and security posts
abandoned by retreating communist forces.
   Dotted along the highway leading from the Pakistani border to the
Afghan capital about 120 miles to the west are signs of the collapse
of the Afghan army in the area as Moslem insurgents move in.
   Guerrilla commanders say Afghan government forces began to
disintegrate after Soviet troops pulled out of the area late last
year under a total withdrawal plan now in its final days.
   ``The communists are all gone. They are running for their
lives,'' said one guerrilla commander.
   Tanks and armored personnel carriers destroyed by guerrilla
rockets stood abandoned in the center of the highway or lie in
roadside ditches. Trucks and radio command vehicles stood where
their crews abandoned them.
   Senior guerrilla commanders told a visiting journalist over the
weekend that Afghan army forces in the area are surrounded in the
major city of Jalalabad and a few outlying towns. They claim
government troops are demoralized, that just a handful of diehard
communists want to fight.
   The Afghan army is composed mainly of ill-trained conscripts who
are unwilling to fight for the Soviet-backed Kabul government.
Western intelligence estimates put its strength nationwide at 30,000
troops.
   Afghan army units around Jalalabad have put up little resistance
as the Red Army withdraws after nine years of propping up the Kabul
regime.
   Commander Abdul Zaher said the guerrillas expect Jalalabad to
surrender soon when its supplies run out, but would attack if the
garrison tried to hold out. The guerrillas, he said, wanted to avoid
civilian casualties.
   The only sign of fighting were a few salvos from government
artillery in the distance around Jalalabad, which is about 90 miles
east of Kabul. Guerrilla commanders said 12,000 insurgents were
surrounding Jalalabad, but there was little fighting.
   ``When the communist government is destroyed the fighting will
end,'' said Khial Nur, a commander of the guerrillas, most of whom
are based in Pakistan. The insurgents are aided chiefly by Pakistan
and the United States.
   An Afghan army prisoner dressed in a ragged green uniform
appeared dazed and shocked as guerrillas helped him walk to their
base. ``He does not want to fight. We will look after him,'' said
one guerrilla.
   Some of the abandoned Afghan army bases and security posts along
the Kabul highway bore signs of heavy fighting. Walls had been
shatteered by mortar and rocket fire and were pocked with
machine-gun bullets.
   Other installations were undamaged and appeared to have been
abandoned without a fight.
   At Landhi Khyber, guerrillas relaxed in a sprawling Afghan army
base. Green Islamic flags with crossed swords fluttered from the top
of the barracks and guerrillas prayed in the courtyard.
   The burned-out wrecks of about 20 Afghan army trucks littered
what was once the motor pool. A few bits of green and khaki army
clothing lay on the ground, flung away by fleeing soldiers.
   At Gerde Ghous, about 20 miles east of Jalalabad, guerrillas
showed off a captured barracks they said once housed 1,200
government militia troops. Buildings were pocked with bullet holes.
Two shattered tanks stood on the nearby highway, their guns pointing
blindly into the air.
   Guerrillas had crawled their names and Islamic slogans on
captured army posts. ``Long live Islamic holy war,'' said a slogan
at Ghazi Abad.
   Insurgents wearing traditional baggy Afghan trousers, long shirts
and turbans perched on gutted tanks, yelling greetings to bands of
compatriots who roared up the highway in trucks and buses. Islamic
flags and posters were plastered on the wrecked army vehicles.
   ``Dushman, dushman,'' beaming guerrillas shouted as they pointed
to the tanks and other wrecked vehicles, using the Pushtu word for
enemy.
   All of the wrecked and abandoned army vehicles were Soviet-made.
Operating instructions in Russian on metal plates were still bolted
inside the turrets of burned out T-54 and T-55 tanks.
   Captured army trucks still in working condition were being used
by the guerrillas to ferry men and supplies towards Jalalabad.
Islamic banners fluttered from the trucks and pictures of guerrilla
leaders were plastered on windshields.
   Bands of guerrilla fighters with bandoliers of bullets across
their chests and machine guns and rifles hanging from their
shoulders stood guard in every village and hamlet along the highway.
   ``We are happy. Soon we will have Islamic government and
Afghanistan will be free,'' said one of the guerrillas.

<HEAD>Bush's First Trip To Canada, Acid Rain To Top Agenda</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canadians looking for assurance that their country
won't be ignored by Washington now that a free trade agreement
between the two countries is in place should be cheered by President
Bush's visit to Ottawa this week.
   Bush continues a pattern set by Ronald Reagan in making his first
presidential trip abroad to Canada.
   There have been hints that Bush's half-day meeting Friday with
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney will be just the first of several 1989
sessions, an increase from the recent pattern of annual meetings.
   Canadians often complain that Americans ignore or take for
granted their northern neighbor and fail to recognize that their
trade relationship is the largest of any two countries in the world.
   After a heated election campaign last fall that attracted an
unusual amount of international attention, Mulroney's Progressive
Conservative Party won a second consecutive majority government.
That cleared the way for the free trade agreement with the United
States that he and Reagan signed in January 1988 to take effect on
New Year's Day, as scheduled.
   The pact phases out all remaining tariffs between the two
countries over a 10-year period, sets up panels to resolve disputes
and eases barriers to investment and trade in energy and services.
   Opponents had argued that Canada risked being overpowered by the
vastly greater population and economic power of the United States.
   Labor groups in Canada are now gearing up to bring attention to
the closings of any plants that can be blamed on the trade pact.
Although the pact's supporters forecast a net increase of 250,000
jobs in Canada over 10 years, they concede some plant closings will
take place as business and industry restructure for the larger North
American market.
   The summit Friday is expected to be largely a formal affair that
will set the stage for future working sessions. The top issue for
discussion is certain to be acid rain.
   William K. Reilly, Bush's choice for head of the Environmental
Protection Agency, attracted widespread attention in Canada with his
comments about acid rain at his nomination hearing in Washington.
   In a major shift from Reagan's policy, Reilly said legislation to
curb acid rain is ``first out of the box'' for the Bush
administration. The Reagan administration did not propose
legislation to strengthen the Clean Air Act.
   Canada has been pressing for an agreement on a timetable to
reduce to specified levels coal-fired power plant emissions that
damage forests and lakes.
   Mulroney, who shared with Reagan an Irish heritage and
conservative outlook, has called Bush a ``great friend of Canada.''
The prime minister said during the fall campaign that he expected
his good relationship with Washington to produce an agreement on
acid rain.
   Michael Hawes, a political scientist at Queen's University in
Kingston, Ontario, said the Bush visit won't necessarily be praised
here just because it is his first.
   ``I don't think we're going to think of this as anything but
ordinary that he should do this,'' Hawes, who specializes in
Canadian-U.S. relations, said in a telephone interview.
   If Bush had chosen another destination for his first trip,
however, it would have touched off a chorus of complaints, Hawes
said.

<HEAD>USDA, Chrysler Joint Venture Puts Scenic Byway Program In High Gear</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department is about to announce
a joint venture with the Plymouth division of Chrysler Motors to
help put its recreational ``scenic byway'' program into overdrive.
   Billed as a ``pioneering partnership'' between Plymouth and the
department's Forest Service, the details are expected to be
announced Thursday at a joint news conference, followed by a
reception at USDA's interior patio.
   The scenic byway program began last year with the designation of
a 26-mile stretch of U.S. Highway 64 in southeastern Tennessee. A
number of others have since been designated, and officials say
various groups have worked with USDA to place interpretive signs,
develop brochures and provide facilities to help make driving
through national forest more enjoyable.
   But the addition of Chrysler's Plymouth division is being counted
on by USDA officials to pump new life into the scenic byways program
and, hopefully, become a showcase of private sector participation.
   A private, non-profit Forest Education Foundation in Santa Ana,
Calif., is the prime mover in Plymouth's involvement, says Forest
Service spokeswoman Marty Longan. The group is also the Skier
Education Foundation.
   Longan said that one of the main goals of Plymouth involvement is
to ``increase public awareness of scenic byways'' through national
promotions.
   There has been talk that the campaign might include Plymouth
dealer promotions and prizes, although Longan said she wasn't
certain this had been settled. National forest offices might be
involved, too, she said.
   ``We've done lots of partnerships, or cooperative agreements,
with non-profit organizations,'' she said. ``That's what most of our
experience has been in the past. This is probably the first real big
one that we've had with a private corporation.''
   There has been grumbling among some USDA professionals who think
the high-visibility and direct role of Chrysler Motors is not
appropriate, although commercial products and private companies have
had a long association with department promotional efforts.
   Most of the time in the past the identities of companies and
brand names have been downplayed, as in large displays of groceries
to represent family food expenditures. Generic promotion of pizza,
ice cream and other foods are other examples.
   But USDA lawyers are not fearful that the Forest Service is doing
anything wrong in its scenic byways arrangement with Chrysler.
   J. Michael Kelly, associate general counsel, said he had not been
asked for an opinion on the agency's program with the automaker, nor
had he had an opportunity to study the plan.
   But very often, he said, private sector efforts are channeled
through a foundation, usually one that is non-profit, so that a
government agency can say truthfully that it doesn't do business
directly with the foundation. Thus, there is no conflict of interest.
   ``In this case, I have no idea what business USDA, if any, might
do with the Plymouth division of Chrysler Motors,'' Kelly said in a
telephone interview. ``No doubt, in USDA's many fleets of
automobiles there are probably some Chyrsler cars and trucks.''
   But Chrysler is contributing through a foundation and ``that
generally passes ethical muster and doesn't raise any significant
questions,'' he said.

   A report to the Soil Conservation Service says
the agency's field personnel should be rewarded for providing
exceptional service to small farmers who have limited resources.
   The report was the result of a study by the University of
Maryland, Eastern Shore, on the impact of the 1985 farm law on
``limited-resource farmers.'' The study was based on interviews with
1,390 farmers who farm 50 acres or less in Alabama, Florida,
Maryland, North Carolina and Texas.
   Farmers with household incomes of less than $25,000 a year were
considered limited-resource farmers.
   The 1985 law requires farmers to have a conservation plan
completed by Dec. 31, 1989, if they are to continue farming highly
erodible cropland and still receive USDA benefits, including price
supports and emergency aid.
   According to the study, only 25 percent of those surveyed had
conservation plans, and 23 percent had never heard of a conservation
plan.
   ``Only 5 percent of the limited-resource farmers, many of whom
farm marginal land, felt they have a severe erosion problem,'' the
agency said.
   The report's findings and recommendations were sent to the SCS at
the Agriculture Department.
   To raise the consciousness of SCS personnel for the special
concerns of these farmers, the agency should use its award and
evaluation system ``to recognize and award those working with
limited-resource farmers in an exceptional manner,'' the report said.

   Singapore's consumers import nearly all their
fruit, and the favorite is the orange, says the Agriculture
Department.
   IN 1987, 45,205 metric tons of oranges were imported, two-fifths,
from the United States and about a fifth from Australia, USDA
agricultural trade officer Geoffrey Wiggin reported from Singapore,
which is a fraction the size of Rhode Island.
   Apples are popular, too, he said in the February issue of
AgExporter magazine. The 1987 apple imports totaled 31,091 tones, a
fourth from the United States.

   The dollar rose Monday, while share prices closed at
another record high on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar opened higher at 129.75 yen, then edged down to finish
the day at 129.70 yen, up 0.43 yen from Friday's closing of 129.27
yen. It ranged during the day between 129.70 and 130.01 yen.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, a 178.48-point gainer Friday, added another 142.97 points,
or 0.45 percent, to close at 31,828.75, a new high.
   The index was lower at the end of the morning session but rose in
the afternoon as investors began buying construction issues, said an
analyst with Nomura Securities who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In currency dealings, the dollar opened higher after similar
trends in overseas markets overnight, dealers said.
   It gained ground as market players bought the currency in an
attempt to test the strength of the coordination among the Group of
Seven member countries, who met Friday in Washington, said a dealer
with a major commercial bank in Tokyo, who spoke anonymously.
   Finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of
Seven industrialzed countries ended their meeting with pledges to
continue close economic policy coordination and seek ways to reduce
the world's huge international debts, while accepting the current
exchange rates.
   The group includes the United States, Japan, Britain, France,
West Germany, Italy and Canada.
   A Bank of Tokyo dealer said the dollar's sharp rise is unlikely,
as other financial markets in Asia, including Hong Kong and
Singapore, were closed Monday for the Chinese Lunar New Year
holiday. They will reopen on Thursday, Feb. 9.

   ``A Nation at Risk,'' the landmark federal report
that condemned mediocrity in America's schools nearly six years ago,
shocked the nation into a flurry of reform.
   But three new reports describing the sad state of U.S. students'
abilities in mathematics might be even more cause for alarm.
   On the surface, the reports released last week revealed little we
haven't heard before.
   Repeatedly during the last decade, international comparisons have
shown U.S. students lagging behind other youngsters in math.
   ``A World of Differences,'' a report by the Educational Testing
Service assessing 24,000 13-year-olds in six countries, found South
Koreans doing best among students from Ireland, England, Canada, and
Spain.
   U.S. pupils scored dead last.
   A report by the National Research Council, ``Everybody Counts: A
Report to the Nation on the Future of Mathematics Education,''
concluded that the nation desperately needs to agree on how math
should be taught. But it noted that compared with Japan or Korea,
math reform has consistently gotten nowhere in the United States
largely because our decentralized national school structure makes
consensus building so difficult.
   ``The top-down systems have beaten us hands down,'' the report
concluded.
   A survey conducted by the University of Michigan compared math
achievement levels of first- and fifth-graders in the Chicago area
and Beijing, China. It found American youngsters performing
significantly worse than their Chinese counterparts.
   Interestingly, that survey also found that the American parents
would be satisfied if their children scored a 70 on a math test. The
Chinese parents had higher aspirations: Their children would need to
score in the 90s to please them.
   But the larger significance of these latest reports lays in two
other findings: Students scoring highest did the most homework and
watched the least television. Koreans ranked first in math homework,
with 45 percent doing at least one to two hours a week; U.S.
students ranked last, with 28 percent doing that amount.
   If homework is indeed so central to better math scores, and if
mathematical know-how is really as crucial as everyone insists it is
to America's economic competitiveness, America may be in more
trouble than realized.
   It's common sense that students who do the most homework usually
have the strongest belief that hard work pays off. But some U.S.
educators wonder whether these math scores demonstrate that American
youngsters have grown soft on hard work.
   ``I think it's a cultural phenomenon in this country,'' said
Scott Thomson, executive director of the National Association of
Secondary School Principals. ``We don't recognize the importance of
studying math or studying tough subjects.
   ``The countries that are most successful, like Japan or Korea,
say right up front that it takes hard work and long hours and
grinding it out. We as a nation tend to be impatient with
everything, including studying.''
   Put bluntly: With math, as with no other subject, there's simply
no faking it. The answer's right or wrong. You either took the time
at home to memorize and drill and practice, or you didn't.
   But equally important, homework and a wholesome home environment
are inseparable. Merely requiring teachers to assign more is like
pushing on a string. Homework won't get done by the student who is
hungry or unhealthy, or chronically unhappy in single-family home
environments where parents are uninvolved in their youngsters'
education.
   Chronically weak math scores, then, indicate problems not just
with our schools, but our society _ problems that won't be solved
merely by tinkering with curricula or teaching methods, though such
changes may well be in order.
   It means that there is probably no quick fix for low math scores,
and schools can't solve the problem alone.
   Given its exactitude, mathematics is one of the truest
bellwethers of the nation's progress in educating children for the
21st century. In that sense, these reports contain plenty to worry
about.

   As a broiling summer day dissolved into a
sultry night at New York's Coxsackie state prison, Joseph Puma
waited to see if five prison guards held hostage by prisoners would
make it out alive.
   After 14 hours, about midnight, the inmates released their
hostages.
   ``This guy came out _ a friend of mine _ he was bloody, beaten,
battered and he wore inmate clothing. He just collapsed in my arms,
crying,'' said Puma, head of the state prison guards' union.
   Puma saw the pain in the faces of the guards and their families
and came up with an idea: The union, through Lloyd's of London,
established a ``captivity coverage'' insurance plan, with benefits
to be paid to survivors of prison uprisings.
   It's believed to be the first time an insurance company has
allowed such a policy, said Nels Carlson, a Lloyd's underwriter.
   Union members held hostage at least 12 hours would be paid a sum
equal to half their annual salary. In the case of death or injury,
the insurance benefit paid to the guard or his family would be twice
the salary. A New York prison guard's average annual pay: $27,500.
   ``It's kind of like your life insurance, where you hope it never
gets paid out, but it happens,'' said Hardy Rauch, director of
standards and accreditation for the American Correctional
Association in Laurel, Md. ``The concept is quite nice. It's an idea
that could very easily be expanded to other states.''
   It's appropriate the idea should come from New York, a state
still haunted by the 1971 riot at Attica, America's bloodiest prison
uprising. Inmates took 39 hostages in a four-day standoff that ended
in furious gunfire. Forty-three inmates and prison employees died.
   No one died in August's Coxsackie uprising, but it changed the
lives of the five guards involved.
   The guards were watching a group of 32 prisoners with
disciplinary problems _ the baddest of the bad _ when they were
overpowered.
   The five guards were blindfolded and moved from cell to cell
while their captors negotiated with authorities. A knife and razor
blades were held to their throats and one guard was told his finger
would be cut off if he didn't relinquish his wedding ring. All were
beaten.
   ``It's probably the biggest fear of a security officer,'' Puma
said. ``You're reversing the roles and now these sick and deranged
people are in charge of your every move.''
   Citing pending court cases and the trauma, the five former
hostages wouldn't talk about their experiences. None of them still
works as a guard.
   Psychological reactions to being taken hostage can range from a
slight depression that lasts a few days to becoming completely
dysfunctional, said Dr. Robin Inwald, a New York City psychologist
who has studied the reactions of former prison hostages.
   ``It's controversial as to when they should go back into the
prisons,'' she added. ``Going back is important to recover the
feeling of being in control of your life.''
   Some never go back. Of 17 guards who were held for 2{ days at New
York state's Sing Sing prison in 1982, only one is still working in
the prisons, said Chuck Booth, a spokesman for the guards' union.
   ``It's not something they want to talk about,'' Jimmy Mann, union
chief at Attica, said of the three guards still working there who
were taken hostage in 1971. ``They've accepted it.''
   None of the guards from Coxsackie, Attica or Sing Sing are
eligible to claim money from the union's policy, which cost about
$100,000, Puma said.
   The union leader has promised that dues won't be raised to pay
for the new insurance. But he said it might be on the bargaining
table when the union's contract with the state expires.
   Puma called the insurance ``go-fishing money.'' He said it will
enable former hostages to take time off or search for a new job with
fewer worries about feeding their family.
   ``These hostage situations do not happen every day _ thank God _
but when they do happen it's the worst thing that can happen to a
person,'' he said. ``Let's do a little something extra for them.''

<HEAD>Dollar, Stocks Up In Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar gained against the Japanese yen today,
and the Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading index rose to another record
high,
   The dollar closed at 129.70 yen, 0.43 yen higher than Friday's
close of 129.27 yen. It opened at 129.75 yen and traded in a range
between 129.70 yen and 130.01 yen.
   The higher opening in Tokyo, following the dollar's climb in New
York, was prompted by U.S. employment figures announced on Friday,
said a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The U.S. jobless rate in January rose to 5.4 percent from
December's 5.3 percent, but an increase of 408,000 in
non-agricultural employees from December encouraged dollar-buying by
market players who took the figure as indicating continuous growth
in the U.S. economy, he added.
   Dollar-buying also was encouraged by a meeting in Washington
Friday of the finance ministers of seven major industrial nations,
who accepted current exchange rates, the dealer said.
   Japanese Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama told a news conference
today that representatives of the seven also agreed to strengthen
policy coordination. The seven are the United States, Japan,
Britain, France, West Germany, Italy and Canada.
   The Bank of Tokyo dealer said the dollar's recent upward trend is
quite strong, based on such factors as high interest rates in the
United States. High U.S. interest rates make dollar-denominated
investments more attractive.
   But the U.S. currency's movement was expected to be limited as
other financial markts in Asia, including those in Hong Kong and
Singapore, were closed today for the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday.
They will reopen Thursday.
   On the stock market, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained
142.97 points, or 0.45 percent, closing at 31,828.75. The index's
previous record was Friday's 31,685.78 finish.
   A morning gain picked up speed in afternoon trading as investors
began buying construction issues such as cement, said an analyst
with Nomura Securities.
   Despite some profit-taking in the morning, the index rose
steadily in the afternoon as currency trading became stabilized, he
added.
   In active trading, volume on the first section was estimated at
1.3 billion shares.

<HEAD>Avant-Garde Exhibit Shut Down After Artists Break Taboo On Performance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police temporarily closed Communist China's
largest avant-garde art exhibit ever because organizers allowed
performance art _ which culminated in the firing of two BBs into a
sculpture, an organizer said today.
   Fei Dawei said the show would most likely reopen on Friday after
the end of the Spring Festival, China's four-day long lunar New Year
holiday.
   He said he did not believe the order was a sign of a new
crackdown on art.
   ``They are just punishing us for the trouble we caused,'' he
said. ``I think the political element here is very small.''
   Fei said a woman wanted in connection with Sunday's shooting
incident had been detained by police later that day.
   The woman, Xiao Lu, an artist from Hangzhou, was initially
believed to have shot her own work of art, a phone booth, located on
the first floor of the China Art Gallery.
   But Fei said police determined that her boyfriend, Tang Song,
actually fired two BBs into the work. Police detained Tang at the
show and found Ms. Xiao later.
   ``What we know now is that they walked into the gallery, she
handed him the gun and he shot her artwork,'' he said. ``It was a
performance art piece. Together they were attempting to negate
modern civilization.''
   Modern art has not been popular with the Chinese government
because its abstract and chaotic forms did not serve the interests
of the ruling Communist Party. Recently, however, the government has
allowed exhibitions of once banned art forms, such as nudes, as long
as the exhibitions can pay for themselves.
   Organizers of the avant-garde show have tried for three years to
put it together. It was approved last year only after they had
raised all the money.
   The shooting of the phone booth was the last of several
performance art pieces done in the gallery in defiance of a ban on
such art.
   Fei said museum officials banned the pieces because they said it
might ``cause chaos in society.''
   One artist sold shrimp to protest ``the commercialization of
art.'' Three others, wrapped from head to toe in white cloth, walked
around the gallery.
   Another took off some of his clothes and began sitting on several
eggs.
   And one strolled around the gallery tossing handful of change and
condoms on the floor.
   Museum officials ordered these artists to stop their performances
but none were arrested. Police did confiscate the identity cards of
the three who walked around the gallery covered in cloth.
   Fei said he understood why police were punishing the organizers.
   ``As organizers, we are responsible,'' he said. ``They are
closing the show now because the masses are on vacation and they all
want to see it. We will lose a good portion of our spectators this
way.''
   After the show was closed Sunday, hundreds of spectators and
artists spilled into the courtyard in front of the China Art Gallery.
   At one point, two carloads of riot police, wearing helmets and
toting automatic weapons and teargas cannisters, drove into the
crowd. They left immediately after their cars were surrounded by
curious onlookers.
   ``That must be performance art, too,'' said one artist.
   The museum is closed Mondays. The show is scheduled to run to
Feb. 19.

   Jethro Burns, the mandolin-playing half of
the country music duo Homer and Jethro who combined cornball humor
with brilliant muscianship, has died at age 69.
   Burns died at his Evanston home Saturday night after a long bout
with cancer, said his son, John C. Burns.
   ``He had a good time, he made a lot of people happy,'' said his
sone, also a musician. ``That's what he was all about.''
   ``I'm not exactly sure what I do,'' Burns once said. ``However,
lots of folks have said I'm really good at it.''
   Burns and guitarist Homer Haynes, who died in 1971, gained fame
as a hillbilly duo that made fun of popular songs and put on a
hayseed music act that also turned out complicated acoustical
numbers.
   Folk singer John Prine, who played with Burns in the late 1970s
and early 1980s and now performs with his son, said Burns was known
for his musical as well as comedic ability.
   ``It always seemed to me that he had so much talent _ natural
talent _ on the instrument that that's why he was able to joke all
the time,'' Prine said. ``He could just pick it up and play it like
you never heard anybody play before. ... He just had it.''
   Homer and Jethro won a Grammy award for the best comedy
performance of 1959 with ``The Battle of Kookamonga,'' a parody of
the ``The Battle of New Orleans.''
   The team also appeared in television commercials for Kellogg's
Corn Flakes.
   Burns was a regular on the television show ``Hee-Haw,'' and
played many times on the radio program ``A Prairie Home Companion,''
John Burns said.
   The duo's most popular album was ``Homer and Jethro at the
Country Club,'' a live comedy-music album from the early 1960s. But
the work that enjoyed the most recent popularity was an instrumental
jazz album from the same era called ``Playing It Straight,'' John
Burns said.
   ``They became pretty popular because they had this crossover
thing, this oddball, cornball kind of thing,'' he said. ``But they
wore these $300 silk suits _ they were extremely proficient at jazz
and swing.''
   Homer, whose real name was Henry D. Haynes, and Jethro, whose
real name was Kenneth C. Burns, were boyhood friends in Knoxville,
Tenn., where they began playing music together.
   Their act took off after World War II, when they became part of
the ``Midwestern Hayride'' on a radio station in Cincinnati, where
they worked with such greats as Chet Atkins.
   Besides his son, Burns is survived by his wife, Lois; his
daughter, Terry; and two grandchildren. Funeral services will be
private, the son said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joseph Raposo, co-creator of the children's
television program ``Sesame Street'' and a five-time Grammy
award-winning composer, has died at age 51.
   Raposo died Sunday from complications of lymphoma at Lawrence
Hospital in Bronxville, north of New York City. He would have turned
52 Wednesday.
   Raposo created the award-winning ``Sesame Street'' with Jim
Henson and Jon Stone, and was the show's longtime musical director
and composer of its theme song.
   His songs were recorded by Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand and
Ray Charles and included ``Sing,'' ``You Will Be My Music,'' ``It's
Not Easy Being Green'' and ``Here's to the Winners.''
   Raposo produced several gold and platinum records and received an
Oscar nomination for composing the music for the 1981 film, ``The
Great Muppet Caper.''
   He was co-author of the hit Broadway play, ``You're a Good Man,
Charlie Brown'' and of another public television show, ``Electric
Company.''
   In addition, Raposo arranged concerts for Fred Astaire and
collaborated with Richard Rodgers.
   He endured one of his few failures in 1986 when the play,
``Raggedy Ann,'' for which he wrote the music and lyrics, folded
after an abbreviated run on Broadway. The play had been a success in
the Soviet Union under one of the first cultural agreements under
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's openness policy.
   Raposo conducted seminars in musical composition at Harvard
University and Yale University, where he told his students to
``master the technical aspects of music'' and to read poetry.
   The son of Joseph and Mary Raposo, he was born in Fall River,
Mass., in 1937. His father was a noted music teacher.
   After graduating from Harvard in 1958, Raposo studied composition
with Nadia Boulanger in Paris.
   On a Boston Pops recording of his songs, Raposo is quoted as
saying: ``Ever since growing up in Massachusetts, my feet have been
in the classics, my head in the theater and television, my heart
with the lovers and children, and my home in Boston.''
   Raposo is survived by his parents; his wife, Pat Collins, who is
arts and entertainment editor at television station WWOR, and their
two children, Elizabeth, 12, and Andrew, 8. He also is survived by
two sons from a previous marriage, Joseph, 24, and Nicolas, 20.
   Funeral services were scheduled for noon Wednesday at the Reform
Church of Bronxville. A memorial service was to be scheduled at a
later date.

   Scott Novak's luck catching walleyes won
him top prizes in a weekend ice-fishing contest, but the outing
turned tragic a few hours later for him and three fellow teen-agers
encamped on frozen Harpt Lake.
   All four were found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning Sunday in
the wooden shanty where they had tried to keep warm with propane
heaters as temperatures dipped below zero during the weekend contest.
   ``It was too airtight,'' said Sandy Koller, whose 16-year-old
daughter, Sarah, was among the victims found in the newly built
shack.
   Mishicot High School, where all four teen-agers were students,
planned to bring in extra counselors and hold a faculty meeting
before school today to help other students cope with the tragedy,
said Principal Terry Vanhimbergen.
   ``We're seeing some reaction from kids already,'' he said.
   Novak, 17, captured first-, second- and third-place in the
contest by catching the three largest fish, said August Stueck, a
contest organizer.
   His third-place catch was registered with contest officials at
11:50 p.m. Saturday _ less than seven hours before the bodies were
found.
   The teens were overcome by carbon monoxide fumes from two
portable propane heaters and a propane hot plate left running in the
shanty, said Detective Leo Jadowski of the Manitowoc County
Sheriff's Department.
   The unpainted 7-foot-by-6{-foot wooden shanty was one of more
than 50 such shelters on the frozen 70-acre lake about 85 miles
north of Milwaukee. Temperatures near Manitowoc ranged from 16 below
and 5 below zero overnight.
   The victims were identified as Novak, Miss Koller, Cory A.
Throndson, 16, and Shawn Shoulak, 16, said Rita Schultz, a sheriff's
department dispatcher.
   ``The cause of death for all four victims was lethal doses of
carbon monoxide,'' Jadowski said. ``It's a small ice shanty unit and
the carbon monoxide must have filled it.''
   Some of the fumes in the shanty also may have come from the
corner of a synthetic sleeping bag that brushed against a heater and
melted, officials said.
   Mrs. Koller said the four teen-agers and other friends taking
part in the contest had been going from one shanty to another much
of the night, checking for possible catches at each tip-up _ an
apparatus that holds a hook and line and hoists a flag when a fish
bites.
   She said she had not been worried about her daughter because her
husband and 18-year-old son also were on the lake, and she knew her
daughter was with her friends and relatives.
   ``The parents all knew that these kids were out there,'' said
Jadowski. ``They were good kids, very fishing- and hunting-oriented,
so they had the blessings of their parents and the parents knew
exactly where they were.''
   Sarah's brother, Scott, and another friend found the four victims
about 6:10 a.m., Mrs. Koller said.
   ``The girl's father was in the shack right next door. He tried
mouth-to-mouth'' resuscitation, said Mary Lee Stueck, another
contest organizer.
   The sporting group observed a moment of silence and members bowed
their heads and prayed for the dead teens during the club's award
ceremony Sunday night, August Stueck said.

<HEAD>Study Finds ABC's `Nightline' Slanted Toward White Conservatives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ted Koppel said he welcomed a study released
today that found his late-night news show, ``Nightline,'' favors
white conservative men as guests, but he added the report's authors
were wrong to criticize the show.
   The guest list merely reflects the government that ``Nightline''
covers, he said.
   The study of almost 2,500 guests on more than 850 episodes of the
ABC-TV show found that 89 percent were men and 92 percent were white.
   It also found that the 9-year-old news interview program
virtually ignored labor unions, environmental and consumer
advocates, anti-war activists, the working class and those who
oppose U.S. foreign policy.
   ``I like studies like this,'' Koppel said. ``I'm happy to see
them, whether they are from the right or the left. They do give us
an opportunity to re-examine what we do, how we do it.
   ``And sometimes it's quite true we get into a rut.''
   The survey, commissioned by the liberal media watchdog group
Fairness &amp; Accuracy In Reporting, was conducted by Boston College
sociologists William Hoynes and David Croteau.
   ``Nightline,'' which has won two dozen Emmys and is seen by more
than 5 million viewers nightly, is widely perceived as one of
television's most influential news programs.
   The findings challenge ``Nightline's'' reputation for
impartiality, said Jeff Cohen, executive director of FAIR.
   ``When you see the same pattern week after week, it becomes a
political bias,'' Cohen said.
   Although welcoming the study, Koppel challenged its implications.
   ``I think FAIR makes a great mistake ... (when it concludes) that
simply by looking at a guest list, you know what the substance of
that program was,'' Koppel said. ``We are accused of putting on the
establishment. Yes, we are guilty. That is what we do.''
   He said his guest selections simply reflected former President
Reagan's conservative appointees and that a liberal administration
would yield a biased guest record in the opposite political
direction.
   ``What you do is bring on the architects of U.S. foreign policy
and hold them to account, which is what we try to do on this
broadcast,'' Koppel said.
   ``And never is it suggested that I might ask (the guests) a tough
question once in a while. Never is it even suggested that if you
want to critique U.S. foreign policy, you don't bring on the
opponents of U.S. foreign policy and let them speak their minds.''
   ``Nightline'' Executive Producer Richard Kaplan also criticized
the study, but conceded that it pointed out a narrow focus regarding
guests.
   Kaplan said he gave copies of the report to his staff.
   The study examined 40 months of ``Nightline'' episodes from
January 1985 to April 1988.
   The analysis showed that the show's most frequent guests were all
conservative leaders.
   Former secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and Alexander Haig
topped the list with 14 appearances each, followed by television
evangelist Jerry Falwell and former State Department official
Elliott Abrams with 12 appearances each.

<TEXT>
   Pakistan's military chief says the
country has test-fired its first homemade long-range
surface-to-surface missile and plans to manufacture its own tank
within two years, official media reported today.
   Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg said two missiles with
ranges of 50 miles and 180 miles respectively and a capability to
carry payloads in excess of 1,000 pounds were tested, the
government-controlled Pakistan Times.
   Beg reportedly made the disclosure Sunday at a military academy
seminar in Rawalpindi, and did not say when the missiles were tested.
   Last summer, western media reports said Pakistan had developed
long-range surface-to-surface missiles. At the time, the government
refused to confirm or deny those reports.
   A retired army general who spoke on condition of anonymity said
the missile, which now gives Pakistan the capability to hit Indian
targets, represents the evolution of the country's defense systems.
   ``These things don't happen suddenly,'' he said.
   The Washington Post reported a year ago that India, Pakistan's
estranged neighbor, had tested the Prithvi, a short-to-medium range
surface-to-surface missile capable of carrying a 2,200-pound warhead
more than 90 miles.
   Relations between India and Pakistan relations began to warm up
with the election last November of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
   At a December summit of Asian leaders in Islamabad, she and Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India signed an agreement not to attack
each other's nuclear facilities in accordance with what they said
was a new commitment to improved relations.
   Beg also told the National Defense College that Pakistan should
produce its first homemade tank within two years, the Pakistan Times
said.
   The reported announcement came as Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze visited Islamabad for crucial talks on Afghanistan with
Pakistani officials. India and the Soviet Union are allies.
   In December, the Kremlin gave the ruling Communists in
Afghanistan long-range Scud missiles capable of hitting targets
100-175 miles away.
   Pakistan, which has 3 million refugees from the Afghan war, has
supported the U.S.-backed Afghan guerrillas who have been fighting
the Soviet-supported government in Kabul since Marxists seized power
there in 1978.

ordinary pilgrims from across India _ began immersing themselves at
the confluence of two sacred rivers today.
   Today's bathing is the high point of the seven-week Kumbh Mela
festival, which according to the Guinness Book of World Records is
the largest religious gathering on Earth.
   The ceremonial bathing began at 4 a.m. with the blowing of conch
shells and the chanting of hymns by the faithful, who believe a dip
in the rivers on this astrologically auspicious day will free them
from the cycle of reincarnation and allow them to achieve salavation.
   Hindus believe that Lord Brahma, creator of the world in the
Hindu religion and a member of the supreme trinity in the pantheon
of Hindu gods, awakens at 4 a.m. and therefore the day should start
at that hour.
   The Kumbh Mela is celebrated every 12 years, according to the
lunar calendar, at the time of a rare planetary convergence: Jupiter
in Taurus, the sun and moon in Capricorn, and a series of
complicated calculations of Hindu astrology.
   But today takes on added significance, for it is also the day of
the new moon, another good omen.
   Two people died in the early hours of the mass bathing. A
50-year-old man collapsed on the river bank after his bath and soon
died, and a woman drowned when her boat capsized, according to a
police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity. In 1954, about
800 pilgrims died in a stampede at the holy festival.
   ``Either these people are crazy or there must be something we
can't see or understand,'' said Nina Marshall, a 23-year-old student
from Berkeley, Calif. who was among dozens of Americans that came to
see the religious spectacle.
   ``It is vibrating,'' she said, pointing to the barefoot pilgrims
trekking to the junction of the Ganges and Jamuna rivers.
   For the faithful, the bathing is often a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.
   ``I planned this trip five years back when we had a good crop,''
said Sarju Mahato, a farmer from Bihar state, as he tended the
blisters on his two sons' feet. ``We saved money and came here.''
   The festival takes the name Kumbh Mela from a story in Hindu
mythology in which a god seized a pot of nectar that made gods
invincible in their war against the demons. ``Kumbh'' means pot, and
``mela'' means fair.
   A drop of nectar from the pot is thought to have fallen at
Allahabad where the Ganges and Jamuna rivers come together. A bath
at the exact spot where the nectar fell is supposed to bring
salvation from the cycle of birth and rebirth.
   The bathing at the Kumbh Mela began with processions of holy men,
their order determined from days of yore according to the importance
of their sects, dipping at the confluence of the Ganges, the Yamuna
and the mythical Swaraswati.
   The Swaraswati cannot be seen, but Hindus believe it flows
beneath the Earth's surface where the two other rivers meet.
   There was color everywhere _ a profusion of saffron, scarlet,
white and gold robes.
   Some holy men wore only loincloths. Some had their foreheads
smeared with vermilion and sandalwood paste, and some wore garlands
of basil wreaths around their necks, wrists and arms.
   Some had shaven heads, others matted hair tied in knots atop
their heads.
   The ``nagas,'' or naked recluses, smeared their bodies with
ashes. They wore garlands of marigolds around their necks and blew
conch shells to drive away evil spirits.
   They danced holding spears, lances, staffs and small rocks
representing some of the Hindu faith's 32 million gods and goddesses.
   There were camels draped in brightly embroidered cloths, adorned
with feathers, beads and mirrors, with bells on their feet that
tinkled when they walked.
   Some pilgrims pulled chariots holding the holiest of the holy
men, who offered blessings to the others.
   The bathing followed the initiation of new nagas. Young men are
inducted into the naked order only once every 12 years during the
Kumbh Mela.
   On Sunday, 1,500 nagas-to-be shaved their heads, burned their
clothing and performed their last rites.
   ``From this moment they have renounced the material world and
since they will not depend on anyone anymore, they themselves
perform their last rites as if they are already dead from this
world,'' explained M.P. Ashnata, the fair's chief spokesman.

<HEAD>Lesbian Lovers Reunited After 3{-Year Separation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 3{-year separation has ended for Sharon
Kowalski and Karen Thompson, lovers forced apart following a 1983
automobile accident that left Miss Kowalski severely brain-damaged
and in her father's custody.
   ``It's been a pretty emotional reunion,'' Ms. Thompson said
Sunday in a telephone interview from Kowalski's bedside at a
hospital in Duluth. ``We've had a wonderful weekend and she wants me
to be here as often as possible.''
   Ms. Thompson, a St. Cloud State University professor who lived
with Kowalski for four years before the November 1983 accident, last
saw Kowalski on Aug. 19, 1985, when Donald Kowalski used his power
as his daughter's guardian to deny her visiting rights.
   Kowalski, 58, a retired taconite miner, said Ms. Thompson's
visits were detrimental to his daughter, sending her into
depression. He said he doubted Ms. Thompson had a lesbian
relationship with his daughter and denied visitation partly because
he feared Ms. Thompson would sexually abuse his daughter.
   Kowalski and Ms. Thompson have been fighting in court over who
should be able to care for Miss Kowalski since she came out of a
coma five months after the accident, which was caused by a drunken
driver.
   She has been in various nursing homes and hospitals since the
accident and has lost the use of her limbs with the exception of the
fingers on her right hand. She whispers, but communicates most of
the time by shaking her head, or typing on a computer.
   Ms. Thompson has charged that Donald Kowalski and his wife,
Della, have not provided adequate care even though it has been
directed by a physician. The Kowalskis say Ms. Thompson exaggerates
their daughter's ability to communicate and her potential for
rehabilitation.
   Ms. Thompson, 41, was allowed to see Miss Kowalski, 32, under an
order from St. Louis County District Court Judge Robert Campbell.
The judge has consistently upheld Kowalski's guardianship rights,
but in December he overruled Kowalski by ordering a re-evaluaton of
Miss Kowalski to determine how soundly she thinks and what her
potential is to express her feelings about who should care for her.
   According to the judge's order, anyone would be allowed to see
her if she ``reliably requested'' to see them. Ms. Thompson was
granted supervised visits because Miss Kowalski ``reliably''
requested to see her in interviews with a psychiatrist, Ms. Thompson
said.
   ``It's really good to have private time with Sharon again,'' she
said. ``I think Sharon is soon going to let everyone know that she
can control her own future.''
   Donald Kowalski said he was angered that Thompson was allowed to
visit his daughter.
   ``It's just not right what they're doing but there's nothing I
can do,'' Kowalski said. ``She (Thompson) has been proven harmful to
Sharon.
   ``I don't believe Sharon reliably wants to see Karen Thompson.''

   The dollar rose in early European trading today
after last week's meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized
countries failed to break the market's bullish sentiment, foreign
currency dealers said. Gold prices also rose.
   Trading was thin, as Chinese New Year celebrations in Asia and
carnival celebrations in parts of West Germany kept many operators
out of the market, dealers said.
   They said the market is ready to buy dollars because inconclusive
comments from the Group of Seven industrialized countries in
Washington did not convince it to do otherwise.
   However, they said, the general bullishness is dampened by fears
that central banks might stage another round of concerted
interventions.
   ``The central banks have failed to reverse the trend, all they
can do is slow down the momentum,'' said one dealer at a Swiss bank
in Frankfurt. ``The market's inclination to take in dollars is still
very strong.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.43 yen to close at 129.70. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 129.85 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday:
   _1.8855 West German marks, up from 1.8805
   _1.6015 Swiss francs, up from 1.5983
   _6.4135 French francs, up from 6.3950
   _2.1302 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1240
   _1,376.40 Italian lire, up from 1,374.50
   _$1.1837 Canadian, down from $1.1885
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7317, cheaper for buyers
than $1.7410 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $390.65 a troy ounce, up
from $388.25 bid late Friday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $390.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $390.30, up from $389.90 bid late
Friday.
   Financial markets were closed in Hong Kong today for the Chinese
Lunar New Year holiday. They will reopen on Thursday.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.81 a troy ounce,
down from Friday's $5.83.

the final miles to the border. He filed this report.

<TEXT>
   A convoy of Soviet troops roared home
today from Afghanistan to a brass-band reception, waving flags and
stuffing red carnations into the muzzles of their submachine guns to
mark the end of their country's involvement in the war.
   The 350th Parachute Regiment, which had been stationed in
Afghanistan since 1984, rumbled across the Friendship Bridge
spanning the Amu River and into Termez, red flags waving and
headlights lit.
   Soviet officials brought about 150 foreign correspondents to this
border town in Soviet Uzbekistan for the welcoming ceremonies, or
one for every two soldiers who returned.
   The 300 paratroopers, commanded by Lt. Col. Alexander Skachkov,
were presented with red carnations, which they pushed down the
barrels of the weapons on their armored vehicles and into the
muzzles of their guns.
   A 20-piece military band played the national anthem and martial
airs.
   The tanks, armored personnel carriers and armored cars that
carried the returning soldiers held banners proclaiming ``Peace to
you, Afghanistan'' and ``The order of the fatherland has been
fulfilled.''
   Among the hundreds of Termez residents to meet the returning
airborne regiment was Maria Sabriba, who found her grandson, Eldar
Galiev, in its ranks.
   The diminutive woman's face lit up as she told reporters she had
seen her grandson. She said he had written a letter saying he was in
Mongolia rather than Afghanistan so that she wouldn't worry about
him.
   ``At least he's healthy,'' she said, beaming.
   The convoy was one of the last rolling north to the border as the
Soviets extricate themselves from their more than nine-year
involvement in the Afghan war. Under a U.N.-brokered accord signed
last year, all Soviet troops are to be withdrawn from Afghanistan by
Feb. 15.
   The Kremlin intervened in 1979 to prop up the Marxist government
in Kabul, but its troops fought to a costly stalemate. The Soviets
say more than 13,000 Red Army soldiers were killed in the conflict
and many troops and veterans express anger and frustration at the
outcome.
   Valery Sudarenkov, first deputy prime minister of Uzbekistan,
welcomed the soldiers home, saying: ``We wish you to join the front
ranks of those fighting for revolutionary change'' in Soviet society.
   But as the convoy logged its last miles in Afghanistan on Sunday,
soldiers expressed ambivalence about the purpose of their military
intervention and uncertainty about the shaky pro-Soviet government
they left behind.
   ``The Soviet policy in Afghanistan brought nothing,'' said tank
commander Andrei Yevryolin, speaking to foreign reporters who rode
for an hour atop his tank.
   At a military outpost near the northern Afghan city of
Mazar-i-Sharif, 30-year-old Capt. Arkady Anonich bluntly answered
``No'' when asked if he thought the local people supported the
government of President Najib.
   He told journalists the Kremlin's decision to send soldiers to
Afghanistan had been ``ill-considered.
   ``There should have been another way to settle this conflict,''
he said.

<HEAD>Proposed Denver Airport Still Having Problem Getting Off The Ground</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed $3 billion airport, which survived one
election and appeared ready to fly last spring, has run into
turbulence again.
   The new airport, which would be the first such major project
planned in the United States since Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport opened in 1974, is again the subject of debate, and faces
the threat of a second referendum.
   Meanwhile, federal investigators are looking into the dealings of
some land developers associated with the project.
   ``I am frustrated with this state and this community not getting
its act together. We can debate ourselves to the tail end of the
line,'' said Gov. Roy Romer.
   ``My frustration with the city of Denver is, for God's sake,
you've been working on this for seven years and sent me and some
others out to represent you to a neighboring county (Adams) and
then, whoops, the rug came out from under us.''
   Romer and other proponents, including Denver Mayor Federico Pena,
contend the airport, scheduled for a July groundbreaking, will ease
a projected national air transportation crush and boost Colorado's
sagging economy. Stapleton International Airport is too small and
has a flawed runway design, they say.
   Opponents, including the two major airlines that serve Denver,
have called the new airport a waste of money engineered by ``fat
cats,'' and point to declining traffic at Stapleton in the last two
years.
   The squabbling could cost the city federal funds that would help
build the airport. The city has asked the federal government for
$500 million to help offset the estimated $1.7 billion cost of the
first phase of construction.
   Adams County voters agreed last May to annex land northeast of
Denver to the city for the airport. Pena ordered a national
advertising campaign that boasted, ``The world's largest airport is
now off the ground,'' and promised the new airport would be
operational by the mid-1990s.
   Three months later, the city sued Continental and United airlines
for judicial approval to use Stapleton revenue to help finance the
new airport.
   And then in January, former Denver Democratic Party Chairman Dick
Young and former state Sen. Bill Chenoweth spoke out against the
city's plans, reviving the opposition and threatening to start a
petition drive to put the issue to a vote. A newspaper poll showed
most residents favored a second referendum.
   Young said the decision to build the new airport instead of
expanding Stapleton was made ``in the closed rooms and the
boardrooms and the hidden rooms, by the people who are going to make
the money off what I consider the greatest boondoggle of all time.''
   At the heart of the investigation by the FBI and the
Transportation Department is an alleged cash payment of $2,500 to
former Adams County Commissioner Steve Cramer from a developer weeks
before Cramer helped rezone a key parcel of land near the new site.
   Cramer denied receiving the payment, and said the decision-making
that went into the airport plan was too complex to be manipulated.
   The Denver City Council has scheduled a Feb. 21 vote on whether
to endorse the new airport.
   The airport ultimately will need approval from the Federal
Aviation Administration, which also would provide federal funding.
The FAA has supported construction of the new airport to help ease
future crowding in the nation's transportation system.
   The FAA released a draft environmental impact statement last week
that approved the new airport based on Environmental Protection
Agency findings.
   The EPA said it still had some reservations about the new site,
including the possibility of increased air pollution.
   FAA officials said they expected to issue a final environmental
impact statement this summer, and will decide before then whether to
approve Denver's airport layout plans.

   Frigid air cloaked the nation today, turning highways into icy
demolition derby courses, leaving snow in unlikely places and
forcing a camp of nudists in Texas to decide they couldn't bare it.
   The arctic front that spilled out of Alaska last week remained
stalled over virtually the entire nation, forcing temperatures below
normal just about everywhere but Florida. Forecasters said relief is
at least several days away.
   In Arkansas, churches canceled Sunday services to spare
worshipers the danger of traveling on icy roads. Public schools
throughout central and northern Texas, as well as at least two Texas
colleges, canceled classes today for the same reason.
   The weather has contributed to at least 40 deaths in the lower 48
states since the air spread from Alaska on Tuesday.
   Among the latest victims were three people killed Sunday night on
icy roads in Kentucky and a man who froze to death beneath a freeway
overpass in Salt Lake City earlier in the day.
   Accidents on slick roads also were blamed for four deaths in
Louisiana, including two people who died when an 18-wheel truck spun
out of control on an icy bridge just east of Monroe and rammed their
vehicles.
   In addition, four teen-agers competing in a Wisconsin ice-fishing
derby were found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning Sunday after they
left propane heaters running overnight in a wooden shanty. The
overnight temperature near frozen Harpt Lake was about 16 below zero.
   A Texas boy died at a Grand Junction, Colo., hospital late Sunday
after being trapped beneath an avalanche earlier in the day. Two
other boys were buried but managed to escape from the snowslide at
Mount Crested Butte in the central Rockies.
   At 2 a.m. EST today, the nation's low was minus 44 degrees at
Craig, Colo. In California, Sacramento's 29 degrees early today
broke a 90-year-old record for the date and San Francisco's 35
degrees shattered a 100-year-old record. Elsewhere, it was 1 degree
in Chicago, Denver and Minneapolis-St. Paul, 5 in St. Louis, 6 in
Albuquerque, N.M. and 8 in Salt Lake City.
   On Sunday, low temperature records were reached in at least 26
cities, from the Pacific to the Plains.
   In Denver, it was 24 below zero, the city's coldest temperature
in 26 years. At 1 p.m., the thermometer crept to 1 degree, breaking
a 70-hour streak of subzero cold. The nation's low Sunday was 46
below zero at Wisdom, Mont.
   It was minus 21 at South Lake Tahoe, Calif., and parts of the San
Francisco Bay area remained coated in snow, astonishing longtime
residents.
   ``You could only find a scene like this on a postcard,'' said
Timothy Waters, a 77-year-old ranch resident at the Point Reyes
National Seashore just north of the Golden Gate. ``It's just
extraordinarily beautiful. Our family can't remember snow like this
in 40 years.''
   Persistent snow in Chicago forced the temporary closure of Midway
Airport and the closure of two runways at O'Hare International
Airport, causing 40 flight cancellations and numerous delays.
   ``It just won't stop,'' complained Kirsten Svare, a spokeswoman
for Chicago's Department of Streets and Sanitation. ``It just keeps
coming.''
   Cool, drizzly weather in New Orleans didn't stop 11 scheduled
Mardi Gras parades, but it did contribute to sales of hot drinks in
Bourbon Street bars.
   ``Thank God it did get a little bit colder,'' said Toni Reyes,
manager of the Seaport Bar. ``As soon as it rained, it pushed
everyone inside.''
   Freezing rain was reported early today across the Eastern
seaboard from Delaware to Virginia, and south and west across Ohio,
Kentucky, Tennessee, northern Mississippi and into the Texas Gulf
Coast and central Texas.
   In Decatur, Texas, 60 miles northwest of Dallas, members of the
Bluebonnet Nudist Park couldn't keep their clothes off Sunday as
temperatures were in the teens and low 20s.
   ``Unfortunately, we nudists have to put it on hold for a few
days,'' said manager Arthur Moss. ``As nudists, we're generally a
sensible lot.''
   Nudists and sensible conformists will be bundling up for at least
the next few days, according to Harry Gordon of the National Weather
Service's Severe Storms Forecast Center in Kansas City, Mo.
   However, he added, storms brewing in the Southwest could spell
relief of sorts for the rest of the country later in the week.
   If the storms begin to push north and east, they could bring more
seasonable temperatures to the middle of the country, Gordon said,
but they also would bring more snow or rain.
   As Karl Williams of the weather service in Chicago said: ``Who
knows? ... When it snows it snows, and when it doesn't, it doesn't.''

<HEAD>Private Citizen Reagan Celebrates 78th Birthday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former President Ronald Reagan, busy lining up
work and visiting old haunts since leaving office two weeks ago, is
celebrating his 78th birthday today with a talk to college students
and a private party.
   He planned to detail his retirement plans during a 20-minute
speech at the University of Southern California _ his first public
appearance since a spirited airport homecoming rally Jan. 20.
   Tonight, he planned to celebrate his birthday with his wife,
Nancy, and about 100 friends at a private party at the ritzy Bistro
Gardens restaurant in Beverly Hills.
   ``The change of address hasn't caused any slowing down of their
schedule,'' said Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg. ``They are very
active and on the go.''
   The former president has already signed a book deal worth up to
$7 million, lined up a $50,000-per-speech lecture contract and
opened his Century City offices, where a variety of offers are
pouring in.
   Social demands include a Feb. 23 Palm Springs gala honoring
Elizabeth Taylor and a private welcome home dinner Feb. 25.
   About 200 friends will toast the Reagan return at Syrian-born
businessman's Mouaffak Al Midani's secluded nine-acre Beverly Hills
estate.
   Midani has expressed interest in Mrs. Reagan's anti-drug crusade,
Weinberg said, and money is still needed for a proposed Nancy Reagan
Center for drug rehabilitation in the San Fernando Valley.
   So far, the Reagans have shunned the reclusive lifestyle of many
celebrities and have ventured away from their Bel-Air home to dine
at upscale Chasen's, attend Sunday church services or visit friends.
   Secret Service agents drive Reagan the five miles from his $2.5
million hillside home to Century City, where he takes a private
elevator to his office suite and spends about six hours daily at his
desk.
   Reagan is reportedly fielding corporate board membership offers
from MCA and the Los Angeles Dodgers. He also is being sought for
radio, television and motion pictures, although longtime friend
Irving ``Swifty'' Lazar dismissed as ``ridiculous'' the possibility
that the former actor would make a cinematic comeback.
   Currently, Reagan's memoirs are his top priority. The
ex-president promised his Simon &amp; Schuster book would be ``an honest
and straightforward look at where we have been, with some thoughts
on where we're going.''

<HEAD>Snow Stretches From New Mexico to New York</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The big winter chill extended its grip on the country early
today, spreading snow from New Mexico to New York, and from North
Dakota to Arkansas.
   Freezing rain and sleet covered the storm's rim from the Texas
Gulf Coast to Delaware and rain was scattered from southeast
Louisiana to northern Georgia and the Carolinas, leaving Florida
virtually the only state unaffected by the system that poured down
from Alaska last week.
   A winter storm warning was posted for north-central New Mexico
this morning for locally heavy snow, cold temperatures and gusty
winds. Advisories for snow and wind were posted for the Texas and
Oklahoma panhandles, northeast and western New Mexico, east central
Arizona, and south central Colorado, and an advisory for blowing and
drifting snow covered northeast Montana.
   Wind chill advisories were posted for northwest Kansas, the
Nebraska Panhandle, southeast and central Wyoming, and northeast
California.
   Warnings for freezing rain or sleet stretched from eastern Texas
through portions of Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee,
Kentucky and southern Indiana and Ohio.
   Snow accumulations were moderate in most places Sunday, although
6 to 8 inches fell in parts of southeast Wisconsin.
   Snow was falling early today in much of New York state, Maryland,
northern Ohio, Indiana, western Kntucky, western Tennessee, Indiana,
Michigan, Wisconsin, from northern Minnesota to Montana and northern
Wyoming, northern Arkansas, southern Colorado, the Texas Panhandle
and northern New Mexicon.
   Today's forecast called for snow to fall in the southern Rockies,
western Texas, the central Plains, the Ohio Valley, the Middle
Atlantic States and much of New England. Scattered snow also was
expected in the central and northern Rockies, northern Plains and
the Great Lakes region. Freezing rain and sleet was predicted for
southern and eastern Texas, northern and western portions of
Mississippi and Louisiana, and West Virginia, where snow also was
likely. Rain was forecast for southeast Louisiana, Alabama and along
the Atlantic Coast from Georgia to southern portions of Maryland and
Delaware.
   Highs were expected to remain below zero in southeast Idaho and
the northern and central Rockies; in the single digits and teens in
northern Maine, the upper Great Lakes, much of the Plains, much of
Nevada and Utah, eastern portions of Washington and Oregon and
western portions of Idaho; in the 40s and 50s from the central and
southern Pacific Coast across southern Arizona to western Texas, and
from southeast Alabama across southern Georgia to the South Carolina
coast, and to reach the 80s in the Florida Peninsula. Highs
elsewhere were expected to be in the 20s and 30s.
   At 2 a.m. EST, temperatures ranged from 44 degrees below zero at
Craig, Colo., to 75 degrees at Key West, Fla.
   Other reports:
   _East: Atlanta 52 foggy; Boston 22 cloudy; Buffalo 19 snow;
Charleston, S.C. 54 drizzle; Cincinnati 14 snow; Cleveland 25 snow;
Detroit 18 snow; Miami 71 fair; New York 26 freezing drizzle;

<HEAD>Karpov Eliminates Hjartarson In Chess Candidates Quarterfinal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former world champion Anatoly Karpov of the Soviet
Union and Iceland's Johann Hjartarson played to a draw in game five
of the World Chess Championship Candidates quarterfinal, giving
Karpov enough points to win the match.
   Hjartarson, a 25-year-old grandmaster, settled for a draw after
the 32nd move Sunday. In a draw, each player receives one-half
point, giving Karpov, 37, the 3{ points needed to win the match.
Hjartarson finished with 1{ points.
   Karpov receives $50,000 for the victory, while Hjartarson gets
$30,000. Karpov now advances to the semifinals to play Artur
Yusupov, the only other Soviet citizen who competed in the
quarterfinals.
   Chess grandmaster Joel Benjamin called the fifth game ``the best
game of the match.''
   ``Johann played aggressively, with more spirit than in earlier
games, hoping to get back in the match with a win,'' Benjamin said.
   Benjamin and other chess analysts said Karpov, as Black, used a
strategy known as the Zaitsev Variation to the Ruy Lopez and was
able to thwart Hjartarson's attempts to set up an attacking
formation. In the final position, Hjartarson had difficulties, but
in view of the match situation, Karpov accepted the draw when
offered.
   The winner of the Candidates series will challenge world champion
Garri Kasparov for his world title in 1990. Two other quarterfinals
matches are being played, while the fourth was won by British
Grandmaster Jonathan Speelman.
   The Karpov-Hjartarson match began Jan. 28. The first game ended
in a draw, Karpov won the second and third matches and the fourth
match was a draw.

<HEAD>Klanwatch Report Says Skinheads Revive White Supremacist Movement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rise in racist violence by young
``skinheads'' shows that ``hate crime is a bigger problem than we
ever suspected,'' the head of a national monitoring group says.
   Pat Clark, the director of Klanwatch, said skinheads helped
revive the white supremacist movement in 1988. A report released by
her group today said white youth gangs attacked blacks, homosexuals,
Jews, Asians, Hispanics and Indians last year.
   Blacks were victims of 56 percent of the hate crimes reported to
Klanwatch in 1988; Jews were victims of 27 percent. The other 17
percent fell into other categories, the report said.
   The report also said skinheads were linked to murders in
Portland, Ore., San Jose, Calif., Las Vegas and Reno, Nev., and
two-thirds of the racial assaults documented by Klanwatch last year.
   Klanwatch monitors white supremacist activities for the Southern
Poverty Law Center.
   The report gives a representative sample of hate crimes during
1988, including 193 incidents in 35 states. But statistics in the
report are incomplete since no national data collection system
exists, said Ms. Clark.
   She said the lack of national data has tended to disguise the
threat of violence. However, she said, ``the tremendous rise in
skinhead crime, as well as the evidence from states who do have data
collection laws, clearly shows hate crime is a bigger problem than
we ever suspected.''
   The report cited a growing recruitment campaign by white
supremacist groups.
   Old guard racists are organizing violent teen gangs into a
national network, the report said. Although many skinheads reject
racism, a hard-core group openly espouses white supremacy and
violence.
   ``Not since the height of Klan activity during the civil rights
era has there been a white supremacist group so obsessed with
violence or so reckless in its disregard for the law,'' according to
the report.
   In the slayings in Portland and Reno, black men were killed by
assailants who apparently picked their victims at random, the report
said.
   In San Jose, Klanwatch said, a 24-year-old white man was fatally
stabbed when he attempted to step between a skinhead and a black man
at a party after the skinhead began making racial slurs.
   In Las Vegas, two skinheads who shared an obsession with Satanism
walked into a convenience store and fatally shot the 21-year-old
clerk in the face for no apparent reason, the report said.
   It added that the racist gangs ``represent a unique and
frightening phenomenon in the history of white supremacism in
America.''
   ``Police in urban areas around the country were confronted last
year with a violent new generation of racists whose weapons include
baseball bats and their own heavy steel-toed boots, and whose crimes
ranged from gang beatings to murder,'' Ms. Clark said.

   A 14-year-old boy whose body was found in a
trash bin behind his home apparently was shot accidentally while he
and two friends were playing with a pistol, police said.
   The body of Lamont Plain was found Sunday morning by his mother,
Judy Plain, who became worried when he failed to come home the night
before.
   Homicide Sgt. Tom Godfrey said the three boys apparently had been
examining the pistol the previous evening at a nearby home when the
gun discharged, striking Lamont in the side of the head.
   ``His friends cleaned up the blood and then carried him to the
dumpster,'' Godfrey said.
   The teen-ager's friends _ ages 14 and 15 _ were taken to the
Juvenile Detention Center and booked under the juvenile code on
suspicion of tampering with evidence.

<HEAD>Soviet Foreign Minister Says Talks on War Failed</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Afghanistan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN WILDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze said today his talks with Pakistani officials failed to
come up with a solution for peacefully ending the Afghan war, but he
said Soviet soldiers would not re-enter the battle.
   Shevardnadze also told a news conference before leavng for the
airport that his visit helped pave the way for a continuing dialogue
with Pakistan, which with the United States has backed Moslem rebels
fighting Afghanistan's Soviet-backed government.
   Shevardnadze spoke as the last Red Army units were reported on
their way home after nine years of involvement in the civil war
between the Kabul government and the guerrillas, who call themselves
mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors.
   Under a U.N. accord, all Soviet troops are to be out of the
country by Feb. 15.
   Contrary to reports from guerrilla sources, who said Sunday the
Soviet official would meet with the Pakistani-based guerrillas,
Shevardnadze said no such meeting occurred. Asked why not, he said:
``I never expressed any desire, any request to meet with the
mujahedeen. There was no request from their side, either.''
   He said any attempt to form a stable government in Kabul
following the Soviet troop withdrawal would fail if it doesn't
include the Marxists.
   ``Whether you like it or not, the PDPA is the most powerful force
in Afghanistan,'' he said.
   Shevardnadze also pledged Moscow's continued support of the Kabul
government but he ruled out any reintroduction of Soviet troops.
   ``If new complications happen, if there is continued and rising
tension, ... we will have to recall that the Soviet Union has
obligations to the Republic of Afghanistan,'' Shevardnadze said.
   He added: ``We are not thinking of any Soviet re-entry into
Afghanistan.''
   Shevardnadze said the last Red Army troops would be out of the
country within a week.
   The communists seized power in Afghanistan in a 1978 coup. Soviet
forces intervened in 1979 to replace one pro-Moscow government with
another, then remained to fight the growing insurgency by Moslem
guerrillas.
   Shevardnadze's visit, the first to Pakistan by a Soviet of his
rank, was seen as a last-ditch effort to forge a political solution
to the war before the Soviet pullout.
   Afghan President Najib has insisted his forces are strong and
able to defend the country.
   However, the rebels claim Najib's mainly conscripted army is
demoralized and will defect to the rebels in large numbers once the
Soviets are gone.
   Shevardnadze, who arrived early Sunday, had talks with his
Pakistani counterpart, Sahabzada Yaqub Khan, as well as Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan.

<HEAD>Report: Profits from Parties Did Not Reach Charities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boston Society of Young Professionals has
staged eight fund-raising parties in the last 18 months but often
failed to donate the profits to the charities in whose name the
parties were conducted, according to a published report.
   The society, a loose-knit group of stockbrokers, lawyers and
other professionals, is under investigation by Attorney General
James Shannon after two charities complained they had received no
money, the Boston Sunday Herald reported.
   A Suffolk Superior Court judge ordered a bank account for the
society frozen last week, but there was no money in that account,
according to Assistant Attorney General Joanna Soris, who is
handling the case.
   The eight parties grossed up to $75,000, but the amount donated
to charity was $3,565, or about 5 percent of the gross proceeds, the
newspaper reported.
   ``Our concern is to break even, and if we have any money left
over, we give it to charity,'' Jeffrey Southmayd, 29, who heads the
society, told the paper. There was no answer at Southmayd's home
Sunday.
   The attorney general's investigation is still in the discovery
process, and Soris said no decision has been made yet as to whether
statements for the bank account should be subpoenaed.
   ``It's not our goal to chill charitable giving,'' said Soris. But
a charitable party, she said, ``should be a cooperative effort. And
you have to have the charity's interest first.''
   Hundreds of young professional singles flocked to the parties,
which were billed as benefits for charities including the Jimmy
Fund, the U.S. Olympic Swim Team, the American Cancer Society, and
the Pine Street Inn.
   Businesses also donated drinks and hotel rooms on the assumption
that proceeds from the functions would go to charity, the newspaper
reported.
   A benefit party for the Special Olympics last month raised $1,300
for the charity, but only after a Boston-based Special Olympics
official, Karyl Resnick, threatened the society with legal action.
   Resnick called the society's methods ``underhanded.'' She said:
``They weren't on the up-and-up with us. People were thinking they
made a donation to a charity when in fact they were paying for these
people to have a big shindig.''
   The party had promised the opportunity to meet such stars as
former Bruin Bobby Orr and former Yankee Tommy John. But Resnick
said, ``there was not one celebrity there.''
   At a Super Bowl party held last month to benefit the Pine Street
Inn, only 105 of the 250 guests paid admission, the Herald said. The
event grossed $3,225 but expenses were $6,000, resulting in a net
loss of $2,775, the newspaper said.
   The Quality Inn donated a room worth $2,000 and a $600 drinks
discount for the party, on the assumption that proceeds would
benefit the Pine Street Inn, said the hotel's food and beverage
director, Bert Patterson. However the Pine Street Inn has received
no donation, the Herald said.
   The Pine Street Inn and the American Cancer Society were not
informed in advance that their names would be used for the events,
the newspaper said. Public charities law forbids the unauthorized
use of a charity's name in connection with any solicitation.

<TEXT>
   China said today that Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev will visit from May 15 to May 18 for the first summit
between the two countries since they split over ideology and
strategy 30 years ago.
   The official Xinhua News Agency also issued a joint
Chinese-Soviet statement on Cambodia containing points of agreement
between Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and his Chinese
counterpart, Qian Qichen, in meetings here last week.
   In the statement, both leaders said they support a Vietnamese
troop pullout from Cambodia by September, with ``strict
international supervision'' and an end to Chinese aid to Cambodia's
anti-Vietnamese guerrillas.
   They said they still differed over the composition of a
transitional government in Cambodia from the current
Vietnamese-installed Hun Sen regime to a popularly elected
government. Xinhua said the two sides will continue to discuss their
differences.
   China apparently considers the Cambodian problem close enough to
resolution to go ahead with a Chinese-Soviet summit. One of its
conditions for a summit has been a Vietnamese withdrawal from
Cambodia after a decade of occupation.
   The Soviet news agency Tass announced Sunday the summit would be
held May 15-18. Xinhua did not say why the Chinese Foreign Ministry
waited more than 24 hours after Shevardnadze ended his visit to
announced the date.
   The summit between Gorbachev and Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping
will officially normalize relations that turned hostile in 1960.
   Trade, cultural and other exchanges have increased sharply in the
past few years, especially since Gorbachev became Soviet Communist
Party head in 1985, but China has held back on normalizing political
ties.
   Aside from Cambodia, two other Chinese conditions also seem
resolved: the Soviet Union is to complete its troop withdrawal from
Afghanistan this month, and it has pledged to sharply reduce its
troop presence along the Chinese border.

<HEAD>Negotiators Begin 14th Round of Bases Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greek and American officials today began
another round of talks on the future of four U.S. military bases
here.
   The officials refused comment on the start of the four-day talks,
the 14th since negotiations began in late 1987. Little progress has
been made in the negotiations.
   A five-year operating agreement for the installations expired
December 20. Under terms of the old accord, the United States has 17
months to reach a new agreement or dismantle the bases.
   Government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos said at the end of last
month's talks that negotiators were no further than the ``preamble''
stage of a new accord and that a ``disagreement of views continues
to be observable.''
   The resignation last week of Rear Adm. Christos Limberis from the
Greek negotiating team was expected to create further delays until
his replacement is found. Limberis, chief of naval operations, is
being groomed to take over as naval chief of staff, military sources
said.
   Another reason for the slow pace is the socialist government's
insistence that a new agreement provide assurances the United States
will help solve the country's disputes with Turkey.
   The two neighboring Western Alliance members have been at odds
over military control of the Aegean sea, its seabed mineral rights
and the Cyprus problem.
   American officials have said they don't want to involve regional
politics in the bilateral talks.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou, beset by a series of embarassing
financial scandals, is also expected to use the bases issue to
attract leftist votes in the June elections.
   Papandreou has already said he plans to shut down one of the
bases adjacent to Athens International Airport and hold a referendum
on the remaining installations.
   Four major U.S. bases have been operating here since the early
1950s. Two are near Athens and two are on the island of Crete.

   Five East Germans fled to Bavaria
over the weekend, but a sixth person who tried to escape over the
Berlin Wall was caught after border guards opened fire, West German
police said today.
   Bavarian border police said two East German workers, ages 21 and
23, fled over the border into Bavaria early Saturday, apparently
unnoticed by guards.
   Three more East Germans, between the ages 16 and 38, fled their
country's fortified border barriers into Bavaria late Sunday, a
police statement said.
   West Berlin police said a witness on the western side of the wall
reported hearing about 10 shots fired by East German guards to foil
another escape attempt.
   The witness saw a man near the border barriers being warned to
remain standing before hearing the shots, police said. According to
authorities, the witness told police the man lay on the ground
before he was picked up by guards and taken away in a car.
   Police said it was not known if the man was injured.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the teachers' union said he
would recommend a strike vote this week because contract talks with
the nation's second-largest school district are at a standstill.
   ``It was an absolute waste of time,'' said Wayne Johnson,
president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, after eight hours of
negotiations ended Sunday night.
   Johnson said the talks narrowed differences on pay hikes but
failed to solve the escalating labor dispute.
   State mediator Draza Mrvichin had brought representatives from
the union and Los Angeles Unified School District together at noon
Sunday in hopes of settling the labor dispute, which is beginning to
be felt by the district's nearly 600,000 pupils. Talks broke off at
midevening.
   Teachers have been working without a contract since June.
   Johnson said union members would vote on a strike this week and
predicted a strike was imminent. But he was not specific on the
timing of any possible strike, which would be the first in the city
since 1970.
   The stalemate has triggered student protests and threats of
lawsuits by parents. On Friday, teachers withheld thousands of
student grades from the district, passing them out instead on union
report cards.
   Negotiations are scheduled to resume Wednesday.
   Teachers had sought a 12 percent pay raise this year, while the
district offered a 17.4 percent hike over three years.
   During the talks, the union offered to reduce its 1988-89 school
year salary increase demand from 12 percent to 11 percent for the
year, with a 10 percent hike next school year.
   The district, meanwhile, raised its offer to 20 percent over
three years, and possibly as much as 24 percent, with an 8 percent
increase the first year, officials said.
   Board President Roberta Weintraub said the board's new offer
would raise beginning teachers' salaries to $28,000. Top pay would
be $50,000.
   ``As far as I can see, it's our last offer. I can't see anything
beyond this,'' she said.

   A Park Avenue physician says he's still getting
new patients despite allegations that his prescription of cocaine to
treat pain is medically unsound.
   The New York Daily News reported Sunday that the state Health
Department has been investigating Dr. Milton Reder, 89, for
administering cocaine to patients without a physical examination or
referrals.
   Health Department officials have said the amount of cocaine Reder
administers, through cotton-tipped swabs placed in the nose, is
roughly equivalent to a dose of street cocaine and could lead to
addiction.
   The New York County Medical Society contends the treatment has
``no basis in scientific medicine.''
   ``Why should these people suffer?'' Reder asked Sunday. ``I've
got about 20 new people who want to be treated.'' He said his phone
``didn't stop ringing'' after the story appeared.
   Reder's patients have included singer Sonny Bono and comedian
David Brenner.
   Bono, mayor of Palm Springs, Calif., said Sunday he was unaware
whether Reder used cocaine to cure his excruciating back pain in
1968, but had no qualms about recommending him to friends.
   ``I guarantee you'd get less drugs from him than you would from a
general (doctor),'' Bono said in a telephone interview from his home.
   Bono said he had recommended the treatment to Brenner, who had
chronic back pain.
   ``I don't think it's any illegitimate practice. ... He's not
trying to turn you into an addict or anything like that,'' Bono said.
   Reder calls cocaine ``the best local anesthetic there is'' but
says he'll shift to another substance if necessary.

<TEXT>
   Percy Hoskins, a crime reporter who became a
legendary figure in British newspapers, has died at age 84.
   His death Sunday in a hospital at Hove on the south coast was
announced by the Daily Express, where he worked for half a century.
   Hoskins started on Fleet Street on the Evening Standard in 1924
and had many scoops in big crime stories.
   He was best known for his work in 1956 on the case of Dr. John
Bodkin Adams, who was accused of killing rich, elderly patients with
drugs so he could collect from their wills.
   After a rival newspaper broke the story that the doctor was a
suspect, Hoskins became convinced Adams was innocent and helped in
his defense. Adams was acquitted of the murder of one female patient
in a trial in 1957.
   After that, Adams sent a card to Hoskins every year thanking him
for ``another year of my life,'' and left the reporter about $1,500
when he died in 1983.
   Hoskins' contacts in Scotland Yard helped his newspaper confirm a
tip in 1982 that jobless drifter Michael Fagan had scaled the
Buckingham Palace walls, woken up Queen Elizabeth II and sat
chatting with her on her bed.
   Hoskins was a friend of J. Edgar Hoover and of singer Bing
Crosby, who sometimes put on impromptu shows at Hoskins' apartment
in exclusive Park Lane.

   Ernestine Morais and her classmates were
having as much fun grabbing for beads as anyone at the Carnival
parade. But they came for a serious lesson.
   ``This is one of our biggest confidence builders. Mardi Gras is
the ultimate,'' said Joanne Fernandez, director of the Louisiana
Center for the Blind. ``If you can travel through a Mardi Gras
crowd, you can go through any crowd and you can go to any place.''
   And even though they couldn't see the gaudy floats or the plastic
beads and aluminum doubloons thrown from them, the members of her
group were having a blast.
   ``It's a lot of fun. Time just to cut loose and anything goes,''
said Ms. Morais, of Central, Calif. ``California has nothing on New
Orleans. We look like we're throwing a tea party compared to down
here.''
   The 15 students and seven staff members were among thousands
braving the cold weather Sunday for the 11 parades that rolled
through the New Orleans area.
   Crowds surged into the French Quarter between parades, ready to
rock on Bourbon Street. Bar and restaurant owners said the chilly
weather was helping them by pushing people indoor.
   Police expect this will be the city's biggest Mardi Gras, with
1.7 million revelers lining the streets and jamming the French
Quarter on Fat Tuesday, the last blowout before the solemn season of
Lent. Authorities said 1.5 million people attended the 1988
celebrations.
   One reveler was killed early today, shot by robbers when he
refused to give up his money, police said. The man was from Baton
Rouge, but his name was not immediately released.
   He was shot about 1 a.m. in the city's central business district
and died later at Charity Hospital. Police were seeking three men
who witnesses said fled the robbery scene in a car.
   Despite a misty fog Sunday, the crowd was 10 deep for the popular
Bacchus parade, led by comedian Billy Crystal as this year's god of
wine and revelry. He threw handfuls of aluminum doubloons to the sea
of arms waving beseechingly below, stopping only to pull out a video
camera to shoot pictures of the crowd.
   It was cloudy and drizzling with temperatures in the 40s, and the
National Weather Service predicted slightly colder temperatures for
today and Tuesday. Two parades compete tonight with fireworks as
Rex, styled King of Carnival by one of New Orleans' oldest parading
groups, arrives by riverboat in the French Quarter.
   The long Carnival celebration began Saturday, highlighted by the
``super parade'' of Endymion with celebrity riders _ singers Daryl
Hall and John Oates and child television star Fred Savage of ``The
Wonder Years'' _ on floats.
   During the weekend parades, three people were injured, but not
seriously, authorities said.

<HEAD>China Welcomes Year Of The Snake</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Fewer firecrackers than past years lit Beijing's
smoggy sky to greet the Year of the Snake early today, but city
residents didn't stint on traditional feasting and drinking.
   People jammed stores over the weekend, preparing for the Lunar
New Year which the communist government dubs Spring Festival in an
effort to rid the holiday of traditional superstitions.
   The Year of the Snake, for example, is regarded as unpredictable
because the reptile is considered cunning.
   As the clock struck midnight, colored rockets and sparklers burst
from every street. The cacaphony lasted half an hour, but it was
only a dim echo of fireworks fusillades of the past, which went on
for hours.
   The government sharply cut back the fireworks supply this year,
allocating 30 percent less to Beijing to try to reduce fires and
accidents. Beijing also banned firecrackers from central Tiananmen
Square and hundreds of other public locations. Shanghai banned them
altogether from the downtown area.
   Lunar New Year is China's combination of Christmas and New
Year's: a time for visiting family, feasting, giving gifts and
reflection. Last year, the Year of the Dragon, brought the highest
inflation in more than three decades, the country's worst drought in
memory and the most deadly earthquake since the last dragon year,
1976.
   Top officials are using Spring Festival parties to deliver pep
talks about China's economic woes.
   President Yang Shangkun urged a tea party of 1,700 army officers
in eastern Nanking to ``join hands with the (Communist) party,
government and civilians in overcoming difficulties China has
encountered in its ongoing reform.''
   Transport officials estimate 800 million train and plane trips
will be made over the four-day holiday period that started Sunday.
   Beijing railway officials this year decided to entertain the
hundreds of travelers likely to be stuck in the train station New
Year's Eve, waiting for connecting trains or unable to get tickets.
Travelers crowded around appreciatively to watch singers and
comedians perform in the cavernous station's entry hall.
   ``We make this trip every year, but usually we get an earlier
start,'' said a man traveling with his wife, daughter and four other
relatives to the southwestern city of Chengdu.
   They sat surrounded by bags of provisions for the 36-hour train
ride in a hard-seat car, followed by a two-hour bus ride and daylong
hike to his parents' rural mountain home.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said millions of viewers spent
Sunday night watching a four-hour television extravaganza featuring
top singers, comedians and dancers.
   ``The evening party on the screen has become an indispensable
item for about 600 million Chinese people,'' it said.

<TEXT>
   Representatives of Solidarity and the
government today began unprecedented talks on the future of the
trade union movement and changes in Poland's political system.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa led his 25-member delegation into
the conference hall and grinned as he took his seat at the round,
pine table.
   Just before 2 p.m., Polish television began a special live
broadcast to show the 57 representatives of the government,
Solidarity, the official trade union OPZZ, the Peasants' Party, the
Democratic Party and the Roman Catholic Church taking their seats in
the Namiestnikowski palace.
   ``We were brought together here by the sense of responsibility
for the future of our motherland. We are all responsible for the
Poland to be,'' Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak told the
participants, the state-run PAP news agency reported.
   PAP said the talks officially began at 2:23 p.m., when television
concluded its coverage.
   The talks are the first between Solidarity as an organization and
the government since the union was suppressed by the martial law
crackdown in December 1981. It was outlawed a year later.
   Official representatives included Kiszczak, Politburo member
Stanislaw Ciosek, and Alfred Miodowicz, the leader of the official
trade union alliance OPZZ.
   Walesa was accompanied by his close adviser, Tadeusz Mazowiecki,
and Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, the Solidarity leader in the southwestern
city of Wroclaw.
   Walesa said earlier he was optimistic about the talks.
   ``I'm happy I'm in Warsaw. And I will be even more happy if we
break the first ice. ... I'm an optimist,'' he said. ``Today, we
will discuss general problems, but solutions to the main problems
will be made at the technical tables.''
   Kiszczak first proposed the talks in August 1988, while strikes
spread across Poland in the country's worst labor unrest in seven
years.
   The crucial issues concern the reinstatement of Solidarity and
electoral reforms that could allow the opposition representation in
government.
   ``We would like Solidarity to be legalized as quickly as possible
and we would like it done all at once,'' said historian Bronislaw
Geremek, a Solidarity delegate to the talks.
   Solidarity actvists remain skeptical about the outcome of the
talks and reluctant to accept a political role.
   Both sides agree that compromise is urgently needed if the Poles
are to extract themselves from end an economic crisis that has
spawned 60 percent inflaction and chronic consumer shortages.
   Poland is trying to cope with a $39 billion foreign debt, an
obsolete industrial base and the exodus of many talented young
people to the West.
   Kiszczak and Walesa met six times to set up the talks, but Walesa
refused to commit Solidarity until authorities agreed to legalize
the union.
   In a dramatic reversal of its stand against the movement it
banned in 1982, the Communist Party's governing Central Committee
last month approved a plan to conditionally reinstate Solidarity.
   The union movement's leaders then agreed to take part in the
talks.
   Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski has suggested Solidarity
observe a strike moratorium as part of the agreement to legalize the
union.
   ``We won't abandon the right to strike, but we declare Solidarity
will search at any cost to avoid strikes,'' Geremek said. ``We
accept that conflict must be avoided, but we cannot accept it at the
loss of our identity.''
   The authorities have signaled a willingness to allow
representatives of the ``constructive opposition'' to run for
parliament, but the opposition does not believe that the Communists
have any intention of sharing power.
   Hence, opposition leaders say they would be reluctant to run for
parliament or accept Cabinet posts.
   ``The party demands Solidarity be a trade union, but it insists
Solidarity become politically engaged,'' Geremek said. ``The key
problem on the elections will be between those who want to reproduce
their power and those who want free elections.''
   Solidarity also says it wants to discuss reform of the legal
system to create a more independent judiciary, freedom of clubs and
associations, access to the mass media, democratization of local
government at smaller round tables.
   Both sides have expressed the desire to conclude the talks
quickly.

   A truck driver with the rock group Bon
Jovi was shot once during a drug deal that apparently turned bad,
police said today.
   Thomas Edward Mullin, 28, of Churchville, Pa., was treated and
released at Tallahassee Memorial Regional Medical Center, said Sgt.
Mitch Miller.
   ``It was not life-threatening,'' said Miller.
   According to the account police said Mullin gave them, he was
searching for some marijuana shortly after 9 p.m. Sunday when a man
offered to sell him some crack cocaine near the Tallahassee-Leon
County Civic Center, where the rock group had had a performance.
   He refused, the apparently disgruntled dealer asked ``What do you
want?'', produced a handgun and began shooting. Five shots hit the
semi-tractor Mullin was driving, one penetrating the driver's door
and hitting Mullin, said Miller.
   ``As he was backing out, he heard about five shots. He said he
felt numb in his left side, but he was in such a hurry to get out he
didn't think about it,'' the police sergeant said.
   Mullin then returned to the civic center and contacted police. He
had a minor wound in the buttocks.
   No charges were expected against the driver, even though Mullin
could have been charged with solicitation to commit a felony, said
Miller.
   ``In this situation, I want to say it would be pouring salt into
his wound, but he's learned his lesson,'' he said.
   When officers were sent to check out the parking lot where the
shooting occurred, no one could be found.

<HEAD>First Woman in Harvard's History Appointed to School's Governing
Board</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Washington lawyer has become the first
woman ever appointed to Harvard University's governing board in the
school's 353-year history, a school spokesman said today.
   The Harvard Overseers on Sunday afternoon unanimously approved
the appointment of Judith Richards Hope to the Harvard Corporation,
the school's governing board.
   Hope, 48, is an attorney specializing in transportation law for
the Los Angeles-based firm of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky and Walker.
She is the daughter-in-law of comedian Bob Hope. She met her
husband, Anthony J. Hope, while both were students at Harvard Law
School in the early 1960s, and they have a son who is a Harvard
sophomore.
   The appointment was reported in today's Harvard Crimson, the
school's student newspaper. School spokesman Peter Costa confirmed
the story this morning.
   Hope, a 1960 graduate of Wellesley College, served as a domestic
policy adviser to President Gerald Ford. Last year, she served as
general counsel to the presidential campaign of Sen. Robert Dole and
in 1984 she served as cochair of Lawyers for Reagan-Bush.
   The seven-member Harvard Corporation makes its own appointments,
contingent upon formal approval of the alumni-elected overseers.
Traditionally, the overseers approve such appointments, the
newspaper said.
   The Harvard Corporation has the ultimate say on all matters of
university policy, including academic appointments and investment of
Harvard's nearly $4 billion endowment.

<HEAD>Energy Companies Urged To Strengthen Defenses Against Terrorism</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts one graf with 1987 security test after 14th graf, Less
vulnerable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department is privately urging
energy companies to take extra precautions against terrorism, in
part out of concern that Libya or Iran might strike at key U.S.
energy facilities.
   In addition, the National Security Council has created a special
interagency task force to assess the vulnerability of domestic
energy systems and to study possible U.S. responses to a wide
variety of energy emergencies at home and abroad.
   ``Energy-related terrorism in the United States would be a
particularly significant threat'' in a military crisis involving the
Soviet Union, said an internal Energy Department report obtained by
The Associated Press.
   ``However, even in the absence of a superpower confrontation,
there is the possibility that potential Third World adversaries
could sponsor attacks on the energy infrastructure in the United
States,'' the report said.
   The report was prepared in December 1987 to describe the early
stages of the department's accelerated effort to improve national
energy security. It was deemed too sensitive to make public,
although a sanitized version was presented to Congress last year,
and a similarly limited edition was published last month.
   Electric power companies, considered the most vulnerable segment
of the energy industry, have begun acting on the Energy Department's
anti-terrorism warnings, according to sources familiar with ongoing
discussions between industry and government.
   But other energy businesses, including the oil industry, have
been reluctant to join the program, according to the sources, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The report said a natural disaster such as an earthquake or
disruptions of world oil supplies are more likely to cause a
national energy emergency, but that a terrorist incident would be
more serious.
   Among the initiatives taken to improve coordination with private
energy companies was a program of special security training for
company officials at the Energy Department's Central Training
Academy at Albuquerque, N.M., the report said.
   A key reason for the initiative, according to department
officials and documents, is growing concern about
``techno-terrorism,'' the use of hard-to-detect plastic explosives,
hand-held missiles, electronic surveillance gear or other
sophisticated devices to carry out politically motivated acts of
sabotage.
   The heightened alert also reflects a fear of retaliatory strikes
by Libya and Iran, countries accused by the United States of
supporting terrorism, the sources said. American bombers attacked
Libya in April 1986, and Iranian oil facilities in the Persian Gulf
were hit by U.S. forces in October 1987 and April 1988.
   Taking its cue from the Energy Department, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission last December imposed new measures to strengthen
protection against possible terrorist attacks at the few facilities
it oversees that handle weapon-grade nuclear materials. However, the
measures were not applied to nuclear power plants, which also are
under NRC jurisdiction.
   The Energy Department report said the most vulnerable segment of
the energy system is the electric power grid, which is stretched
across long distances in many remote, unprotected areas. Repairing
or replacing critical power plant components such as generating
stations can take weeks or months, it said.
   Less vulnerable, but still a source of concern, are oil
refineries and offshore production facilities, oil and natural gas
pipelines and coal transport links.
   In 1987, an Army Special Forces team acting as terrorists staged
a moch attack that ``knocked out'' power substations, an emergency
operations center and valves of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in
Louisiana and Texas. The Energy Department says it is tightening
security for the oil stored against an embargo.
   The report noted that serious power disruptions have been carried
out by terrorist organizations in Western Europe and parts of Africa
and South America.
   ``In the past, these attacks generally were poorly designed and
executed, but recent attacks by the same organizations have shown a
higher level of technology and better planning,'' the report said.
   Edward V. Badolato, deputy assistant secretary for energy
emergencies, told Congress last year that the Energy Department
began passing on intelligence agency ``threat advisories'' in 1987
to key industry trade organizations. He gave no details, however.
   Badolato declined to be interviewed on the subject. He is
scheduled to testify about the program Wednesday before the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee.
   The internal Energy Department document said the threat
advisories are transmitted to organizations such as the American
Petroleum Institute, the American Gas Association, the National Coal
Association and the North American Electric Reliability Council. The
groups then pass on the warning to their members, the report said.
   A source said the advisories are issued during a heightened state
of international alert, such as the July 1988 downing of a civilian
Iranian airliner by the USS Vincennes.
   Gene Gorzelnik, director of communication at the electric
council, confirmed that his organization was working with the Energy
Department to assess security but would provide no details.
   ``It feels as if anything that is said about it ... may give them
(terrorists) some hints or bring others out of the woodwork,''
Gorzelnik said.
   Officials said some industry executives have raised concern about
possible antitrust and conflict-of-interest problems in cooperating
directly with the government.
   ``As far as the oil industry is concerned there are some major
concerns about antitrust,'' said Marshall W. Nichols, executive
director of the National Petroleum Council.
   Robert Kupperman, a leading private authority on energy-related
terrorism, said a successful terrorist attack on U.S. facilities is
``immensely feasible,'' but that industry executives are balking at
the Energy Department program because they ``don't want to admit
their vulnerabilities.''
   ``They're being dragged into it by the scruffs of their necks,''
he said.

   One normally docile elephant took three
people on a wild ride through a zoo and then plunged into a lake
with them, and a second elsehwhere in Florida killed a trainer it
liked and then walked calmly away.
   Trainers did not know what spooked either animal.
   A 4-ton, 15-year-old female elephant used for paid rides at the
Southwest Florida Fair at Fort Myers broke loose from a petting zoo,
tore through a crowded midway and plunged into a lake while carrying
three terrified riders, one of them 4 years old.
   ``We were afraid he was going to kill us _ stomp on us,'' said
Consolacion Cruz of Alva, who was aboard the elephant with her young
godson and his 18-year-old aunt.
   At least eight people were sent to local hospitals Saturday with
minor back injuries and grease burns from fryers in toppled
concession stands.
   Joe Frisco, an elephant caretaker, managed to grab a chest strap
and slow the elephant until she stepped on a water tube. Water shot
up, spooking the elephant again. She crashed into another stand
before Frisco was able to stop the animal and guide her back to the
corral.
   ``She had to be hit with a pellet gun or something. She'd never
done this before in 15 years,'' said Frisco.
   At Busch Gardens at Tampa, trainer Joseph Allen was returning a
17-year-old, 3-ton male elephant to its barn Sunday when he was
knocked down and the animal used its head to crush him, said Sgt.
James Preston.
   ``Either he fell over the threshold of the barn door or the
elephant pushed him. We'll never know,'' said Busch spokeswoman
Glenda Gilmore.
   The elephant then pulled up its head and walked back into the
yard, she said.
   ``The elephant was tame, but not trained to do tricks,'' Gilmore
said. ``The elephant knew him, and the elephant liked him.''
   The elephant has been at Busch Gardens for about four months. It
is one of two males among the 22 Asian elephants at the park,
Gilmore said.
   Allen, 33, a 12-year park veteran, died at Tampa General Hospital
of multiple injuries, a hospital spokesman said.
   The accident, which occurred out of public view, was the first
fatality caused by an animal at the 30-year-old African theme park,
said Gilmore. In November, a 400-pound Bengal tiger seriously mauled
a caretaker.

<HEAD>High Court Reprimands Wheel For Misconduct</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former judge convicted last year of
perjury as part of a scandal involving three state Supreme Court
justices was reprimanded publicly by the court after finding her
also guilty of judicial misconduct.
   The Supreme Court on Friday accepted a recommendation by the
Judicial Conduct Board that former Chittenden County Assistant Judge
Jane Wheel be found guilty of failing to conduct herself in a manner
befitting a judge. The public reprimand is the harshest punishment
possible because she is no longer a judge.
   Wheel and former justices William Hill, Thomas Hayes and Ernest
Gibson III were charged in January 1987 with 25 counts of
misconduct. The case has caused a major backlog in the Supreme Court
as the justices disqualified themselves from hundreds of cases in
order to avoid potential conflicts of interest.
   The charges included allegations that Wheel and Hill had their
arms around each other in an inappropriate display of affection in
the courthouse, and that the justices tried to block an attorney
general's investigation of allegations that Wheel falsified pay
vouchers and used county funds to throw a party for Hayes.
   Wheel and the three justices denied any wrongdoing. The case
against Hayes was dropped when he died; the one against Gibson was
dropped when he conceded some of his actions could have been
construed as inappropriate. The conduct board in March found Hill
guilty of five counts of misconduct and dismissed six others; the
Supreme Court has not acted on his case.
   Wheel was convicted last year of three counts of perjury brought
because of the probe into the pay vouchers. She was sentenced in
June to 45 days in jail and 1,500 hours' community service. The
sentence is delayed pending appeal.
   In the misconduct case, conduct board prosecutors and Wheel
agreed in November that she would not contest the single
discourteous behavior charge and the prosecutors would drop all
others. The board said it would accept the plea agreement because
the judiciary had endured enough scandal.
   Wheel, who was voted out of office in 1986, maintains her
innocence and stipulated only that others might have construed her
actions as inappropriate, according to her attorney, Leonard Wing.

<TEXT>
   An Israeli teen-ager avoided airport security
booths at Ben-Gurion International Airport and boarded a jet bound
for Paris before being caught without a ticket, an airport spokesman
said today.
   The security breach occurred Sunday morning as former
intelligence agents and airline officials from around the world
gathered outside Tel Aviv for an Israeli-sponsored conference on
aviation security.
   Airport Authority spokesman Menachem Eyal said the 16-uear-old
boy who walked into the airport and onto the plane did not carry a
weapon and apparently meant no harm but was ``apparently deranged.''
   Eyal said the youth was caught by stewards when he failed to
produce a ticket or boarding pass after boarding the Boeing 707.
Eyal said the aircraft belonged to the Israeli Arkia Company.
   The boy was turned over to police, Eyal added.
   ``We are still investigating what happened. It is clear that
something very wrong happened, an apparent security breach. We will
take the necessary steps against whomever is found guilty,'' Eyal
said.
   It was the second such incident at an Israeli airport in two
months.
   In December, a 3-year-old girl wandered onto a civilian plane at
an air force base in southern Israel that is also used for charter
flights. She was caught moments before the plane took off for
Copenhagen.
   At the conference near Tel Aviv, titled the ``First International
Seminar on Aviation Security,'' leading anti-terrorist experts and
police from the United States are expected to deliberate methods to
improve protection from hijackings and bombings.
   The issue of airport security has been particularly sensitive
since the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland. All
259 people on the jet and 11 people on the ground died.

<HEAD>Productivity Unchanged In Fourth Quarter; Up 1.4 Percent For 1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The productivity of American workers increased
1.4 percent last year, the government said today, matching the
average gains of the six previous years but falling short of the
growth needed to meet the forecast on which President Bush is basing
his budget.
   Increased productivity _ getting each worker to produce more each
hour he or she is on the job _ is vital to economic growth without
inflation, particularly given the current squeeze in the labor
market.
   But the Labor Department reported non-farm productivity was
unchanged in the fourth quarter of 1988 and was up 1.4 percent for
the year. That marked an improvement over 1987 but was exactly in
line with the 1.4 percent annual average in productivity gains since
the end of the 1981-82 recession.
   Output in the non-farm sector was up 5.1 percent for the year,
but average hours worked climbed 3.6 percent, the department's
Bureau of Labor Statistics reported.
   Manufacturers reported a 3.2 percent productivity gain for 1988,
down from 3.4 percent in 1987. Productivity in the business sector
dropped 2.0 percent in the final quarter of 1988 and ended the year
up 1.0 percent.
   The productivity report came as the Federal Reserve Board
prepared to set monetary goals for 1989 and as Bush readied his
budget proposals for delivery to Congress later this week.
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is expected to seek to tighten the
central bank's reins on credit to ease inflation. That would run
counter to the economic forecast of nearly 3 percent annual growth
that former President Reagan included in his final budget and that
Bush has adopted for his amended spending plan.
   One possible way for the economy to grow at 3 percent a year or
more without an inflationary surge in wages would be through
significant productivity gains, something on which the Reagan-Bush
economic forecast relies.
   The forecast assumes productivity gains averaging 1.9 percent a
year, which along with the projected growth of the labor force would
allow for potential economic growth of 3.2 percent a year.
   Some economists have attacked the rosy projections of the
budget's economic forecast. They say productivity gains, which
averaged just 0.6 percent a year between 1973 and 1981 and 1.4
percent since then, are too difficult to predict.

   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens today accused the

   In Jerusalem, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets on the
main shopping street of the city's Arab sector to disperse several
dozen Palestinian stone-throwers who smashed cars and shop windows.
A teen-ager was reported injured.
   ``Two days ago, we had an example of a terrorist act by a branch
of the PLO,'' Arens said in a speech to the New York-based
Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.
   He cited a clash Saturday in which Israeli troops killed five
Palestinian fighters on the northern border of Israel's
self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon.
   The radical PLO factions of George Habash's Marxist Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine and the Syrian-backed Palestinian
Liberation Front said their guerrillas were on a mission to attack
Israeli positions.
   Arens said the action ``clearly and unequivocally violated'' U.S.
conditions for opening talks with the PLO after a 13-year boycott.
   ``I presume that in Washington, they also noticed what happened.
But, to the extent that somebody there may not have noticed, we will
draw his attention to it,'' Arens added on Israel Radio, after the
speech.
   A Foreign Ministry official later said, ``Israel is calling on
the United States to reconsider the dialogue considering that the
PLO, the Habash faction, took responsibility for the attempt to
penetrate Israel.''
   U.S. officials shocked Israel by opening talks with the PLO in
December after PLO chairman Yasser Arafat renounced terrorism and
said he accepted Israel.
   Israel argues the PLO has not changed its objective of destroying
the Jewish state. Israeli officials note Arafat's mainstream Fatah
faction has refrained from attacks but express doubt that Arafat can
control other, more militant PLO factions.
   Seymour Reich, head of the Jewish conference of presidents, said
he, too, would pressure the Bush administration to end contacts with
the PLO.
   ``I'm not sure the administration is prepared to cut off the
dialogue yet,'' Reich said on Israel Radio. ``But we're going to
press them on these issues and remind them that ... these terrorist
acts are continuing.''
   In a speech Sunday, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Israel
would never allow a Palestinian state to exist and branded
Palestinian people ``brutal, wild, alien invaders in the land of
Israel.''
   In the occupied territories, meanwhile, Israeli troops today shot
a 15-year-old Palestinian girl in the thigh, Arab hospital officials
said. Gaza Strip residents were on strike for a second day to
protest the deaths Saturday of two Palestinian youths shot in
clashes with troops. Merchants shuttered their shops and students
went home.
   The army said it was checking the report about the girl's injury.
   Since the December 1987 start of the uprising, 373 Palestinians
and 15 Israelis have been killed.

   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said
today Iran will continue to export its Islamic revolution, but not
by force, and that better relations with the United States are
possible only if Washington changes its hostile stance.
   ``We have a concept and we are going to continue the policy to
export the revolution,'' Velayati told a news conference. ``But this
doesn't mean we're going to export the revolution with a gun.''
   He also said Iran and Iraq will resume direct peace talks to end
their eight-year war ``soon,'' but that there would be no progress
unless Iraqi troops were withdrawn from Iranian territory.
   Iran has been restoring relations with Western countries and its
Arab neighbors as part of a policy aimed at ending a decade of
self-imposed isolation.
   But the Tehran hierarchy is deeply divided over the issue of
restoring links with the United States, severed in 1979.
   ``Except for the Palestine-occupying regime and the racist South
African regime, and precluding American sabotage, we desire good
relations with other countries of the world,'' Velayati said.
   Speaking in the Foreign Ministry's ornate audience hall in front
of a life-sized portrait of Iranian spiritual leader Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, Velayati said the export of Iran's revolution
would be ``cultural.''
   ``As you do in Western countries, you're trying to make other
people in the world to be Western-oriented,'' he said. ``We're going
to do the same on the basis of our Islamic beliefs and concepts.''
   The news conference was attended by scores of foreign
correspondents in Tehran to cover celebrations marking the 10th
anniversary of the revolution.
   Tehran's so-called pragmatists, led by Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani, have made it clear that with the Aug. 20 cease-fire in
Iran's war with Iraq, Iran has backed off the militant export of its
fundamentalist revolution.
   Velayati said the peace talks were deadlocked and ``will be
useless'' unless Iraq withdraws its troops from Iranian territory.
   ``If Iraq adopts a stubborn attitude and refuses to retreat, the
talks will get nowhere,'' he said.
   Velayati gave no date for resuming direct talks with Iraq, which
broke off in November over the issue of troop withdrawals.
   However, he and Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz are due in New
York this week for talks with U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar.
   The Iranians have charged that Iraq still holds about 390 square
miles of their territory.
   Iraq has refused to withdraw until it gets a guarantee of freedom
of navigation in the Persian Gulf and until the Shatt-al-Arab
waterway, its main passage to the gulf, is cleared of sunken ships
and other war debris.

<HEAD>Proposal Would Deny Parole To Illiterate Inmates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State officials are studying a proposal to deny
parole to illiterate inmates in an effort to motivate them to learn
to read, Gov. Roy Romer says.
   ``I believe we have got to overcome the problem of illiteracy,''
Romer said in an interview with The Denver Post published today.
``We've got people in prison we need to rehabilitate, and one of the
tools for rehabilitation is learning to read.
   ``I'm trying to think of ways we can motivate or discipline
people into using that time to acquire the skill of reading.''
   If Colorado cannot constitutionally require literacy as a
condition for release, Romer said, he hopes to develop other
incentives.
   Of Colorado's 6,000 prison inmates, 55 percent do not have a high
school degree or its equivalent. More than 27 percent read below a
seventh-grade level, according to a survey of 2,938 inmates
conducted a year ago.
   Experts believe many ex-convicts wind up back behind bars because
they don't have the skills to get and keep a good job.
   One proposal would require that illiterate inmates successfully
complete literacy classes before they are allowed to take
higher-paying prison jobs, said Herman Abeyta of the corrections
department.
   At the present, prisoners enrolled in academic programs earn just
56 cents a day while those with jobs earn 80 cents a day or more.
   Under a pilot program established by the legislature in 1988, 100
inmates at Buena Vista Correctional Facility and Colorado Women's
Correctional Facility earn an extra four days a month off their
sentences for participating in literacy programs.
   ``People are staying in the programs longer than they were before
without any incentives,'' Abeyta said. ``Money and reduction in time
are the two big issues in prison.''

<TEXT>
   The last Red Army convoys abandoned
their garrisons and headed north for home today, Soviet officials
said, bringing to an end a nine-year mission that cost more than
13,000 Soviet lives.
   Hundreds of Soviet troops guarded the airport of the war-weary
Afghan capital as military transports ferried in loads of grain and
other supplies to help ease food shortages caused by guerrilla
blockades.
   In Moscow, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda reported ``the
last Soviet soldier left Kabul'' on Sunday. But Soviet officials in
the city said about 1,000 troops would remain at the airport until
the end of the week.
   In neighboring Pakistan, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze met with Pakistani officials but said today the talks
failed to find a way to peacefully end the Afghan war. He said the
Soviets will continue to support Afghanistan's Marxist government
but would not send troops back into the country.
   Under a U.N.-brokered accord, all Soviets forces are to be out by
Feb. 15.
   Soviet diplomats said Red Army troops in the western city of
Shindand left their garrison, the remaining Soviet military complex
in the country.
   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
soldiers headed over the weekend toward Herat to meet a convoy there
and were expected to reach the Soviet border Wednesday or Thursday.
   Pravda said Soviet troops had by Sunday removed defensive
checkpoints on the Salang Highway to about 50 miles north of Kabul
at the end of a tunnel that cuts through some of the roughest
terrain on the withdrawal route.
   Pravda said insurgents did not fire on Soviet convoys on the
highway, the only land route to the Soviet border from Kabul. But
four avalanches crashed down on retreating columns Sunday, killing
three Soviet soldiers and injuring a fourth, the paper said.
   Three officers were also injured by ``terrorist grenades'' in a
Kabul suburb Sunday as the Soviets handed over motor vehicles to the
Afghans, the newspaper said.
   In the Soviet border city of Termez, where a Soviet airborne
regiment arrived from Afganistan today, military spokesman Lt. Col.
Igor Korolev said the last remaining Red Army soldiers were on the
move toward the border.
   He said Soviet soldiers were moving out of Balkh, Samangan,
Baglan, Parvan and Herat provinces.
   The troops of the 350th Parachute Regiment were greeted by
thousands of residents, servicemen and relatives as they roared
across the Friendship Bridge over the Amu River into Termez. The
unit had been stationed in Afghanistan since 1984.
   Along the road behind the Kabul airport, meanwhile, several
Soviet soldiers manned bunker checkpoints, nervously clutching
rifles.
   Andrei, a 20-year-old soldier from Moldavia, said the troops
would be flown home sometime before Feb. 15. He said they had not
been told exactly when.
   Tass today reported that heavy shelling by guerrillas in Kabul
province killed eight people. It said one person was killed and two
wounded in shelling in the cities of Gardiz and Khost in Paktia
province.
   Rockets and rocket-propelled grenades also hit residential areas
in the city of Herat and the airport in the southern city of
Kandahar, Tass said.
   With the Soviet pullout, those cities are held by the conscript
army of President Najib, a force guerrilla commanders say is
demoralized and crippled by desertion.
   The highest-ranking French diplomat in Kabul, Charge d'Affaires
Raymond Petit, his wife and three Austrian diplomats left the
capital today for New Delhi. Also on the flight were relatives of
Yugoslav, East German and Vietnamese diplomats.
   Shevardnadze said his talks in Pakistan failed because insurgents
refuse to share power with Najib. He told a news conference that
Moscow would continue to support the Kabul government.
   ``If new complications happen, if there is continued fighting,
the Soviet Union has obligations to that country,'' he said.
However, the Soviet envoy added, ``We are not thinking of any Soviet
re-entry into Afghanistan.''
   The Soviet Union sent troops into Afghanistan in December 1979 to
replace one Marxist regime with another and stayed to help fight the
U.S.- and Pakistani-backed insurgents. The Kremlin says more than
13,000 Soviet troops were killed and 35,000 wounded in the conflict.

   Fifteen Armenians with crushed limbs,
skulls and bones are in the United States today for treatment of
their injuries suffered in December's devastating earthquake.
   The Armenians arrived Sunday at John F. Kennedy International
Airport in New York City and were sent to hospitals in New York,
Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Missouri, said Steve Norman, a
spokesman for AmeriCares, a New Canaan-based relief agency.
   Norman said it was the first airlift to the United States of
injured children and adults from Soviet Armenia, where an earthquake
in December killed tens of thousands.
   AmeriCares chartered a jet to bring the injured Armenians, who
range in age form 2{ to 41, to New York and has arranged
transportation within the United States. The Washington, D.C.-based
Armenian Assembly of America secured volunteers in various cities
where the patients are staying to visit and watch over them.
   Doctors are donating their time, and hospitals are donating their
cost of care, Norman said. The injured Armenians largely need
orthopedic and reconstructive surgery and treatment.
   ``One young guy managed to get out of a school because he had
been a little difficult and he was sent home,'' Norman said. All the
children in the school died when the building collapsed. The boy
``survived but his home also collapsed,'' Norman said.
   Two doctors from Connecticut _ Laurence Kirwan, who practices in
Norwalk and Greenwich, and Neil Kahanovitz of Greenwich, who
practices at the Joint Diseases and Orthopedic Institute in New York
City _ went to Armenia to examine patients and are coordinating the
victims' treatment in the United States, Norman said.
   Other hospitals where patients were sent are: St. Vincent's in
Erie, Pa., Hershey Hospital in Hershey, Pa., Children's Hospital and
Menora Hospital in Kansas City, Mo., and several in New York City.
   AmeriCares has sent 300,000 pounds of supplies, largely medicine
and medical equipment donate by U.S. companies, to Armenia since the
quake, Norman said.

   The judge at Oliver North's trial scheduled a
closed-door hearing today reportedly to hear concerns of the
intelligence community about classified information in the
Iran-Contra case.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell scheduled the hearing as
the jury selection process resumed and the judge added two people to
the pool of prospective jurors, bringing the total to 34.
   He rejected three others, including a woman who knew someone who
was on a grand jury that has investigated the Iran-Contra affair.
Another woman rejected for the pool said she ``heard it in passing.
It was all over the news.''
   One woman sent into the jury pool is an office clerk who said she
recalled seeking a July 1987 magazine with North's picture on the
cover, but didn't recognize North in the courtroom and when asked
whether she had heard of him said, ``No, I never have.''
   Another woman approved for the jury pool said she had seen North
on television in his Marine uniform. That drew objections from North
attorney Barry Simon, who suggested she had been exposed to the
fired White House aide's immunized congressional testimony in 1987.
Gesell, however, said that ``while she saw, she did not listen'' to
what was being said.
   Gesell scheduled the closed-door hearing at the request of the
head of the prosecution team, John Keker, who apparently was acting
on behalf of the intelligence community in the Bush administration.
   Gesell said only that the hearing would deal with objections by
the office of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh ``to one of my
earlier orders.'' It was understood that the matter pertained to
classified information.
   Keker said Walsh and a representative of the Justice Department
wanted to be at the hearing, to which Gesell readily agreed,
responding: ``I have been trying to get the Department of Justice
here without too much success.''
   Last Thursday, Keker asked on behalf of the Justice Department
and intelligence agencies that they be provided with four seats in
the courtroom during the trial. Gesell agreed, but said he was
concerned that ``security gurus'' would try to run the case.
   The National Security Agency made strong objections late last
month to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh over classified
information that would be presented in the case and said it
warranted blocking the trial. Thornburgh rejected the NSA's
suggestion.
   Gesell's remarks today came as 39 additional prospective jurors
were sworn in, some of whom will undergo questioning on how much
they know about North and the Iran-Contra affair. If they were not
exposed to North's immunized congressional testimony in 1987, they
likely will be placed in a pool from which a jury is to be chosen
later this week.
   
   Thirty-four people have been approved for the jury pool since the
trial began last Tuesday and Gesell wants to have a group of 45 from
which to choose 12 jurors and six alternates.
   The jury pool's lack of knowledge, and interest, in the
Iran-Contra affair marks them as unusual. Out of the first 104
jurors who came into the courtroom, just 31 said they hadn't
watched, listened or read about North's 1987 testimony to Congress
in which he detailed many of the activities for which he is now
accused of crimes.
   A number of the prospective jurors who were approved for the jury
pool by Gesell have said they recall hearing somewhere about
shredding of documents in connection with the Iran-Contra affair or
North, but recall nothing more than that.
   Three counts of the 12 criminal charges against North allege that
he destroyed documents to conceal aid to the Contras and the Reagan
administration's sale of arms to Iran.
   Most of the prospective jurors said they simply glance at
front-page newspaper headlines and switch channels or don't pay
attention when the news comes on.
   They said they are too busy with jobs or occupied with other
interests to have paid much attention to the biggest foreign policy
debacle of the Reagan administration.
   Most are blue- or pink-collar workers, several with the
government, while several others are unemployed or retired. One
woman is holding down two jobs.
   Of the first 25 prospective jurors, a dozen finished the 12th
grade, one has a master's degree, two others finished college and
another has some college education.
   Their occupations range from cement finisher to mental health
administrator.
   North is accused of allegedly concealing from Congress in 1985
and 1986 his efforts on behalf of the Nicaraguan Contras and of
covering up from the attorney general the National Security
Council's role in diverting money from the Iran arms sales to the
Contras.
   North also is accused of illegally accepting a $13,800 security
system at his home from co-defendant Richard Secord, converting to
his own use at least $4,300 in traveler's checks from Contra leader
Adolfo Calero and conspiring to defraud the Treasury of tax revenue
in connection with contributions to the Contras.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson said today
his Rainbow Coalition has signed an agreement with Soviet officials
to have an international telethon to raise resources for
earthquake-devastated Armenia.
   Jackson, who returned recently from a six-day visit to the Soviet
Union, said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' that he found
conditions in Armenia in the wake of the Dec. 7 quake ``really
incomprehensible.''
   ``We've signed an agreement between the Rainbow Coalition, the
minister of culture, the minister of radio and television to have an
international telethon on June 10,'' Jackson said from Chicago. The
program would link Armenia, Moscow and ``perhaps Britain, and
America to raise resources to build churches, houses, hospitals and
schools.''
   The Rainbow Coalition is Jackson's national political group,
so-called because its aim is to encompass people of every race.
   What is needed right now, Jackson said, ``is prefabricated
housing. And just as many people have sent trees to Israel as a
concrete way of making a statement, people or groups may want to
send prefabricated housing to Armenia. Or they may want to send
direct contributions to the church.''
   The aftermath of the earthquake, he said, is ``an excellent
opportunity for us as a nation to penetrate and to build good will
within the Soviet Union and between our two countries.''
   Jackson said that during his visit, ``I made an appeal on the
basis of human rights to release some Soviet Jews, and they released
four while we were there.'' He did not elaborate. Last Thursday he
said in Moscow that he did not know the names of four Jewish
refuseniks granted permission to leave the country.
   However, his spokesman, Frank Watkins, said today in Chicago that
the four are Boris Vladimirovich Kagan of Leningrad, Alexander
Veniaminovich Mestechkin of Moscow, Evgenia Abramovna Feldshtein of
Moscow and Vladimir Mihailovich Civkin of Leningrad.
   Watkins said the four have been given permission to leave the
Soviet Union. Eric Easter, a press aide who accompanied Jackson to
Moscow, said Soviet officials did not say when the four would be
allowed to leave the country, but they would be given freedom of
movement immediately.
   The former Democratic presidential candidate said the earthquake
presents ``a challenge to glasnost or openness in the Soviet Union,
to their restructuring of their priorities.''
   ``I think we must monitor their words, we must verify their
commitments, we must also match their deeds as they move toward
disarmament and move toward Third World development and ending Third
World conflicts,'' Jackson said.
   ``I think it's a tremendous opportunity and we ought to match it
and seize it.''

   CBS, still trying to find an audience for its
youth-appeal drama ``TV 101,'' is moving the show for the third
time, the network announced today.
   The network also announced that a new series, ``Hard Time on
Planet Earth,'' will premiere March 1 in the Wednesday time period
occupied by ``TV 101.'' It will star Martin Kove, who was in
``Cagney &amp; Lacey,'' as an extraterrestrial convict sentenced to live
on Earth in human form.
   ``TV 101,'' a critically praised but low-rated series starring
Sam Robards as a high school journalism teacher who launches an
in-school video news show, moves to Saturday night, as of Feb. 25.
Currently occupying that time slot is a limited run show, ``The
Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.''
   The series, produced by Grant Tinker's GTG Entertainment, started
the season on Tuesday night. It is the only survivor among GTG's
three network series to premiered this season. ``The Van Dyke Show''
and ``Raising Miranda,'' also on CBS, were canceled.

   Fire marshals charged a woman with murder after
she allegedly doused her husband with paint thinner and set him on
fire during an argument over her alleged use of crack, authorities
said.
   Gary Tate, 41, died Sunday at New York Hospital, where he was
taken after the incident Saturday in a hall outside the couple's
apartment in the borough of Brooklyn, said a Fire Department
spokesman, John Mulligan.
   His 38-year-old wife, Jessie, was also at the hospital with burns
to her right hand and arm, he said. She was placed under guard at
the hospital's burn center, where she was listed in stable condition.
   The fire marshal's office charged Mrs. Tate with second-degree
murder, second-degree arson and second-degree assault, said
Firefighter Al Brown.
   ``Their whole dispute was about her alleged smoking (of) crack,''
Mulligan said.
   Mrs. Tate apparently became so enraged during the argument that
she doused her husband ``from head to foot'' and ignited a rolled-up
paper bag, which she used as a torch to set him on fire, Mulligan
said.
   Tate ran into their apartment, where he jumped into the bathtub
and turned on the water to put out the flames, but he suffered burns
over 96 percent of his body, Mulligan said.

   A workman was killed Monday when he was hit
by heavy lifting equipment used in construction of the English
Channel tunnel, police said.
   David John Simes, 36, of Dover, is the second workman to be
killed on the English construction site.
   Tony Knowles, a spokesman for the company digging the tunnel,
said the accident involved heavy lifting gear which moves the
tunnel's concrete lining blocks.
   A government-appointed committee is investigating the Jan. 24
death of a 19-year-old tunnel worker who was crushed by a train
carrying chalk waste from the tunnel face a half-mile from Dover.
   The proposed 34-mile tunnel, 24 miles of which is underwater,
consists of two one-way rail tunnels and a smaller service tunnel
between them. It is being dug simultaneously from England and France
under the English Channel, and is scheduled to open in 1993.

   Two children drowned and 6,000 people were
left homeless after torrential rain collapsed their mud houses,
police said Monday.
   The children were swept into a water-filled pothole in a suburb
of Lusaka, the capital, said district police commander Zunga
Siakalima.
   The heaviest rains recorded since 1978 destroyed homes in suburbs
and shanty towns around the capital, Siakalima said.
   More than 10 inches of rain was recorded in Lusaka over a
five-day period ending Saturday. The rain has fallen almost
continuously since then.
   Most of the destroyed homes were built with bricks of hardened
mud under a state plan that allows city residents to rent land and
build their own houses without complying with normal building
regulations.
   Officials of Zambia's ruling party were organizing relief efforts
for the homeless, Siakalima said.

   South Korean opposition leader Kim Dae Jung
thanked Pope John Paul II on Monday for an intervention he says
saved him from a 1980 death sentence, news agencies reported.
   The pope received Kim and a delegation of 43 South Koreans at the
Vatican. Many in the delegation were parliamentarians.
   The South Korean government commuted Kim's sentence in 1982 to 20
years. He was released from jail later that year for humanitarian
reasons.
   In an interview with the Italian news agency ANSA on Sunday, Kim
said the pope intervened secretly with the South Korean government
to spare his life. ANSA reported that during their meeting Monday,
Kim thanked the pope.
   The Vatican did not issue any description of the meeting and its
official text of the pope's speech to the Korean delegation made no
mention of Kim's death sentence.
   The pope is expected to attend the International Eucharistic
Congress in Seoul in October.

   Turkey signed a contract Monday with a
Canadian-led consortium for the construction of a subway in the
capital.
   The consortium, led by the Canadian Urban Transit Development
Company, includes the Turkish firm Gama-Guris.
   Mayor Mehmet Altinsoy said the first part of the subway system
will be built in four years and will be 8.7 miles long. Trains will
run between the downtown district of Kizilay and the western
suburban areas of Batikent.
   The construction will cost $350 million, Altinsoy said.
   There will be 12 stations on the line, which is expected to carry
about 600,000 commuters daily in this city of 3 million people.
Plans eventually call for the subway to extend to 32 miles by 2015,
when the city's population is expected to reach 5 million.
   Premier Turgut Ozal and visiting Canadian Foreign Trade Minister
John C. Crosbie attended the signing ceremony.

   In most Cajun towns, masked horsemen celebrate
Mardi Gras as they have for hundreds of years, with a riotous ride
from farm to farm to scare up some chickens and other ingredients
for a huge pot of gumbo.
   But in Tee-Mamou, a town of about 400 people deep in Cajun
country, the ``courir du Mardi Gras'' has used trucks since 1919 _
the year the horses died.
   ``They were running pretty hard, it was rek,''
said Larry G. Miller, Tee-Mamou-Iota Mardis Gras Folklife Festival
Association's folklikind of a long tfe director. ``They ended up running
across a
blue norther that was blowing in right at the end of their run.
   ``They got to the farmhouse to do their gumbo, and tied the
horses up.''
   When they went out later, about two-thirds of the 28 horses had
died from pneumonia brought on by the sudden chill after a long, hot
run.
   ``It sobered up a lot of mardi gras early and it busted up the
dance,'' said Miller, using ``mardi gras'' as folks do in these
parts, to mean those who participate in the drunken ride.
   Since that night in Tee-Mamou, a town so small it seldom shows up
on maps of Acadia Parish, the courir has been made by truck _ a
flatbed at first, and now on a specially made wagon drawn by a
pickup. My Miller said, ``The only words that are both in
their song and our song is `We come from England.' That's kind of
curious.''
   That reference in French-speaking southern Louisiana may be to
England's tradition of costumed peasants begging in hard times or to
the Acadians' flight from Nova Scotia after it became English
territory, he said.
   After the chant and some dancing, things get really wild.
   ``They break out and run all over the place, chasing chickens and
getting whatever charity they can get out of the farmhouse,'' said
Larry Miller.
   ``They'll frequently go in to scare the womenfolks or children.
It's kind of customary for the women and teen-age girls to be
deathly afraid of the mardi gras. And little boys as well,'' he
said. ``It's kind of an ongoing thing from generation to generation.
You grow up scared of the mardi gras.
   ``Later on you become one of them.''

   President Bush's point man for ethics policy,
C. Boyden Gray, is resigning as chairman of a multimillion-dollar
communications company to avoid any appearance of conflict of
interest, the White House said today.
   Gray, Bush's official legal counsel since 1981, previously had
said he would remain as chairman of the family-owned Summit
Communications Group, Inc. but would refuse a salary.
   He resigned, effective today, after consulting with the heads of
Bush's new ethics commission, said White House Press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater said the action was prompted in part by news accounts
over the weekend in The New York Times and The Washington Post that
pointed out that the Reagan White House had a policy that forbade
employees from serving in such chairmanships or earnign outside
income.
   Fitzwater said there would have been ``nothing inappropriate''
about Gray keeping the post in the Bush administration. But he said
Gray was advised to resign by former Attorney General Griffin Bell
and federal appeals Judge Malcolm Wilkie, chairman and vice
chairman, respectively, of the newly created President's Commission
on Federal Ethics Law Reform.
   ``The duties of the White House counsel are sufficiently broad
that it would be constructive to resign such a directorship to avoid
any possibility of even the appearance of conflict,'' Fitzwater told
reporters.
   He said Gray also would be putting his personal assets into a
blind trust. The Washington Post estimated Gray's investments at $10
million.
   Bush has made a major point in his presidency of stressing high
ethical standards for government employees, and said he wants
tougher ethical rules than those he inherited from his predecessor,
President Reagan.
   ``Boyden Gray has the president's highest trust and confidence
and he will remain the primary adviser to the presidnet on ethical
matters,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bush was aware that every year for the past eight years when Gray
worked for him as vice president the Office of Government Ethics
reviewed and approved Gray's financial disclosure forms, he said.
   The Reagan White House had a policy that no White House officials
should accept outside earned income or serve on the boards of
outside corporations, Frank Q. Nebeker, director of the Office of
Government Ethics, said Sunday. This policy was mentioned in a 1983
written advisory opinion by the ethics office that was distributed
to all government ethics officials, including Gray, the Times said.
   Gray was not bound by those rules when he worked for the vice
president, whose policy was more lenient, and he was paid several
hundred thousand dollars over the eight years for serving as
chairman of the company that owns at least a dozen radio stations
and has about 130,000 cable subscribers in the South.
   He reported the income on his financial disclosure forms. More
recent forms have also disclosed payments for his work as
co-executor of the estate of his father, who died in 1982.
   Gray told the newspapers that he stopped accepting payment from
Summit for his work at the beginning of the year.
   ``Due to my promotion and due to the policies enunciated by
(Bush) during the presidential campaign, I cannot and I will not
take outside income and so have instructed the family company,'' he
said.
   Bush made a campaign pledge in July that his appointees would not
accept any outside income, but he did not address the problem of
serving on outside corporations' boards.
   Last week, Bush appointed an eight-member commission to review
government ethical standards, including conflict-of-interest law.
Bush has not yet named a White House ethics officer, but Gray has
been serving informally in that role since before the inauguration.
   Gray, who has an unpublished telephone number, could not be
reached for comment Sunday, according to the White House. His
deputy, John P. Schmitz, as suffering from back problems and was
unavailable, said Schmitz' mother.
   Gray told the Post that he has avoided conflict-of-interest
problems by recusing himself since 1981 from any matters concerning
communications. He also said he had no conflict because he was not
Summit's chief executive or operating officer. He said he devoted
four to six days a year to overseeing the company.
   Ninty-three percent of the company's stock is owned by a trust
administered by Gray and his brothers, the Times reported.
   Nebeker declined to say what Gray should do about his
chairmanship of Summit to meet White House ethics standards, saying:
``I'm not prepared to make any suggestions to him at all.''
   Peter F. Watson, who worked with Gray on presidential transition
matters, defended Gray on Sunday.
   ``All I can say is, during the several meetings I participated in
with him and his staff dealing with ethics issues, I have never seen
anybody more concerned not only with strict compliance with ethics
issues but indeed, nobody was more sensitive as to the appearance
issues as well,'' Watson said.
   ``Specific communications issues did come up during transition
and he immediately advised everyone in the room that he was not to
be involved in those issues,'' said Watson, an attorney who now
works for the Overseas Private Investment Corp. ``I personally
witnessed him removing himself from any deliberations for
appointments on the FCC.''
   Timothy Muris, who worked on the FCC transition, also attested
Sunday to Gray's recusal from communications matters. ``Boyden never
had any conversations with me about the FCC,'' he said.
   Nebeker said he met with Gray on numerous occasions after the
November election and before the inauguration to discuss matters
concerning ethics and Gray's financial disclosure.
   ``I apprised him of the existence of the 15 percent rule,'' a law
under which officials above a certain salary are prohibited from
earning an amount equal to more than 15 percent of their government
salary in outside earned income such as wages or other compensation,
Nebeker said. Interest and dividends are not included.
   Nebeker said that while Gray had not been at that level before,
``he's at it now'' because his salary has increased.

   The public outcry over the proposed 51 percent
pay increase for members of Congress should hardly be surprising.
   Americans have been objecting to congressional pay raises for
nearly all of the 200-year history of the Senate and House of
Representatives.
   Alexis de Tocqueville, a close observer of American life, offered
an explanation in his 1835 study, ``Democracy in America.''
   His conclusion: Democracies are far more stingy than other forms
of government when it comes to paying high-ranking officials.
   Part of the reason, de Tocqueville wrote, is that a salary level
which seems inadequate to the official receiving it ``appears
enormous to him whose wants do not extend beyond the necessities of
life.''
   ``When he reflects on own humble dwelling and the small earnings
of his hard toil, he remembers all he could do with a salary which
you judge insufficient, and he is startled and almost frightened at
the view of so much wealth,'' he said.
   More than 150 years later, little has changed.
   ``We have never had a satisfactory method for setting
compensation for high government officials,'' says Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine. ``We still do not.
   ``If contemporary public opinion were the sole determinant, the
pay of members of Congress today would be the same as it was in
1789.''
   The root of the problem is in the Constitution.
   Article I, Section 6 provides: ``Senators and Representatives
shall receive a compensation for their services, to be ascertained
by law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.''
   That sounds well enough in theory.
   But in practice it leaves the question of congressional pay
levels up to Congress itself, posing an always sensitive,
uncomfortabe and sometimes politically explosive problem.
   Some of the framers of the Constitution thought it would give
members of Congress a license to steal. Others argued that pressure
from incensed constituents would rein in greedy impulses.
   The issue has always been approached gingerly at best.
   ``Bringing up the pay raise issue is about as welcome in a
legislative body as a skunk is at a Sunday school picnic,'' says
Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa.
   The first major American squabble over a proposal to raise the
pay of members of Congress arose in 1816 and it set back the early
political career of Daniel Webster, who later was to become a famous
orator, senator, and secretary of state.
   From the convening of the 1st Congress in 1789 until 1816, a
27-year span, members of Congress were paid at the rate of $6 a day
_ with attempts made from time to time to dock the pay of absentees.
   In 1816 Congress ended the day-by-day payments and adopted an
annual salary of $1,500 a year.
   The result: public outrage.
   Nine members of Congress resigned and several were defeated in
the 1816 elections.
   Webster was one of those ousted in the pay-raise revolt.
   It took him until 1822 to persuade the voters to send him back to
Capitol Hill.
   The $1,500 annual salary also was a casualty; It was repealed in
1817 and the next year congressional pay was set at $8 a day.
   Eight dollars a day remained congressional pay for the next 38
years.
   The idea of an annual salary finally prevailed in 1854 when the
compensation for members was set at $3,000 a year.
   Congressional pay rose to $5,000 a year in 1865.
   But when Congress acted in 1871 to boost the total to $7,500
annually, the voters rebelled again.
   The higher salary had been made retroactive to the beginning of
the 42nd Congress two years earlier, in effect giving members a lump
sum windfall of $5,000.
   Congress already was besieged by accusations of corruption. The
new pay increase brought cries of ``salary grab'' and ``back-pay
steal.''
   Members could not take the heat and when the 43rd Congress
convened dozens of bills were introduced to repeal the increase.
   Congressional salaries soon were rolled back to the $5,000 level
where they remained until 1907, a period of 33 years.
   Congressional pay was cut twice during the Depression of the
1930s.
   Salaries, which had reached $10,000 by 1925, were reduced to
$9,000 in 1932 and to $8,500 the next year. But they have been
growing slowly ever since.
   The present congressional salary: $89,500.
   The proposal by an independent commission: Increase it to
$135,000 to more nearly approach the compensation offered in the
private sector to lawyers, corporate executives and others with
similar responsibilities.
   The Senate has already rejected the raise, 95-0. The House may or
may not act.
   The prospects _ as usual _ are highly uncertain.

<TEXT>
   A new program to help first-time Michigan
home-buyers meet their down payments will be formally proposed this
week, Gov. James Blanchard said today.
   In his State of the State speech Tuesday, Blanchard said, he will
propose the Home Ownership Savings Trust program, similar to the
state's program to help parents save for their children's college
costs.
   ``I think this program will not only work, but sweep the
country,'' Blanchard said.
   The program will let would-be first-time buyers of homes invest
small sums each month in Michigan revenue bonds for three to 10
years. They would earn tax-free interest on their savings.
   When enrolling in the program, they would declare what price
range house they were seeking and would save toward a down payment
for a house in that range.
   The state would guarantee them enough money for a down payment on
a house in the declared price range, no matter how much housing
prices might increase during the time the would-be buyers are
saving, the governor said.
   The plan is modeled after the Michigan Education Trust, in which
parents invest with the state for their offsprings' college
educations. The state then covers costs at state universities,
regardless of how much tuition may increase by the time the children
are old enough for college.
   In his address Tuesday, Blanchard will also outline a
``workfare'' program aimed at getting able-bodied persons age 18 to
25 off the dole.
   ``This is not a budget-cutting measure. It's a long-term
investment,'' Babcock said. ``If we don't do something to have these
people enter the labor market, they have a greater chance of
long-term dependency.''

<HEAD>Aircraft Broker Tells Senate Panel of Kickback Demand From Navajo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Houston aircraft broker told a Senate
investigative panel today that Navajo officials sought a $45,000
kickback from him in 1987 when he tried to sell them two planes.
   Drex Hansen, president of American West Aircraft Corp., said he
wasn't told who would get the alleged kickback, but believed Navajo
Chairman Peter MacDonald would eventually receive at least some of
the money.
   ``I don't believe it would have gone directly to him,'' Hansen
said. ``I do believe he would have benefited by it.''
   Hansen told members of the investigative panel of the Senate
Select Committee on Indian Affairs that the deal, to sell two King
Air twin-engine turboprop passenger planes, was never made. The
committee has been holding hearings since last week on accusations
of corruption in federal Indian programs and on reservations.
   Hansen also said the Navajo would not pay him $89,269 they owed
him for several charter flights his company provided for MacDonald
and his family until he threatened to tell the FBI about the alleged
kickback request.
   He said after making the threat, he worked out an arrangement
with Navajo officials under which they paid him $64,269 for the
flights.
   Hansen said his company arranged seven or eight charter flights
for MacDonald and his family, who live on the Navajo reservation in
northeastern Arizona, including trips to Boston to attend a
daughter's graduation from Harvard.
   MacDonald has consistently denied allegations of impropriety
raised at the hearings.

   A twisted old oak tree dripping with moss
and overlooking a pasture south of this small rural farming
community has become something of a landmark.
   There's no marker or sign to ``The Shoe Tree,'' but you can't
miss it.
   Nailed to the thick trunk is a wide assortment of footgear, all
in pairs. The collection stretches from near the ground to high
above the reach of a normal person.
   Work boots. Cowboy boots. Women's spike heels. Even a pair of
baby running shoes. Most of them obviously have been well used.
Residents say they started showing up about two years ago and now
there are about 20 pairs.
   One resident, Pam Herman, said the first shoes were placed by the
tree as a joke between a young man and a girl he was courting.
   They eventually married and moved away, but Herman says they
still come back to keep the shoe tree well-stocked.
   ``You never know what people are going to do around here,''
Herman said.

asks Buddy Leger.
   Commercials featuring the dancing, singing California raisins
have helped boost consumption by 13 percent and Leger wants to do
the same for watermelons. He's co-chairman of the National
Watermelon Association's research and promotion committee.
   Watermelon growers and handlers in 48 states will vote by Feb. 21
on a proposed U.S. marketing order that would authorize an
assessment of 2 cents per hundred pounds to promote the crop.
   ``Advertising is the name of the game. We're just trying to bring
the consumer's attention to a good product,'' Leger says.

   Imagine a combination of ``Pee Wee's Playhouse''
on wheels and Chevy Chase stepping out to peddle copies of his
latest movie.
   That's something like the ``U.S.A. Rest Stop Movie Tour.''
   Creators of the feature-length video ``Only A Buck'' left their
home base in Spokane, Wash., in early November to hawk their movie
from the Brickmobile _ a brick-sided motor home.
   They set up shop at rest stops, traffic jams, street corners and
gas stations _ anywhere that they're allowed to stop for more than
five minutes.
   ``The point all along has been to make a name, maybe find a
distributor or get this elevated to the status of cult film,''
explained writer-producer-director Gerry Cook.
   ``Only A Buck,'' about a TV news cameraman who sets out to make
his own movie, was a surprise hit at New York's Independent Feature
Project and was one of only two films from the project accepted into
Robert Redford's prestigious United States Film Festival last year.
A videotape of ``Only A Buck'' goes for $19.95.
   Shunning the traditional movie-distribution route has produced
more than its share of odd moments.
   ``The day we left, we were all of a half-hour out of Spokane and
we come onto a wreck ... trucks jack-knifed all over the place,'''
Cook recalled during a recent three-week stopover in the Chicago
area.
   Then ``all of a sudden Peter (Hunrichs, actor-composer) jumps out
of the back of the truck wearing a helmet with a flashing light on
top, and yelling, `Blue-light special!' like they do at K mart.
   ``Well, none of these truckers were in what you'd call in a good
mood. But looking on the bright side, I recall he did find one
buyer.''

<HEAD>Pentagon Says Illicit Drug Use in the Armed Forces Declines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The illicit use of drugs in the U.S. armed
forces has declined even more than had been indicated last summer by
preliminary results of a worldwide survey, the Pentagon said Monday.
   Use of marijuana declined from 6.5 percent in 1985 to 2.9 percent
last year, while use of other illicit drugs dropped from 5.8 percent
in 1985 to 3.1 percent in 1988, the Defense Department said in a
statement.
   The overall figure for the use of any drug dropped from 9 percent
in 1985 to 4.8 percent in 1988, the Pentagon said.
   Cigarette smoking and heavy alcohol use also declined, and the
survey ``found that almost 80 percent of military personnel took
some action within the past year to improve their nutrition,'' the
Pentagon added.
   Last July, based on some preliminary results from the same
survey, the Pentagon projected 1988's overall illegal drug use rate
at 5.5 percent. The additional drop to a rate of 4.8 percent is
based on final tabulations of statistics from military outposts
around the world, the Pentagon said.
   The 1988 survey is the fourth conducted since 1980, when the
Pentagon began attacking a drug problem within the ranks that had
become almost out of control. In 1980, the Defense Department
discovered more than a quarter of its military personnel _ 27.6
percent _ admitted using drugs illegally.
   The Pentagon responded with a variety of tougher disciplinary
sanctions, including dismissal from the service, and launched a
program that now subjects every man and woman in the military to
random urine testing for drugs.
   The worldwide surveys are not part of the disciplinary program,
however. They are conducted every three years in strict
confidentiality to chart what, if any, progress is being made.
   As finally tabulated, the 1988 survey concluded that ``cigarette
smoking and use of other tobacco products dropped significantly
between 1980 and 1988.''
   ``Cigarette use declined from 51 percent in 1980 to 40.9 percent
in 1988. Heavy smoking, smoking one or more packs a day, declined
from 34.2 percent in 1980 to 22.7 percent.''
   On the use of alcohol, the level of heavy drinking _ defined as
consumption of five or more drinks at least once a week _ also
continued an eight-year decline. In 1980, the survey found 14.1
percent acknowledging heavy alcohol use. That figure is now down to
8.2 percent, the Pentagon said.
   The 1988 survey, conducted for the Pentagon by the Research
Triangle Institute, involved the completion of lengthy
questionnaries by 18,673 men and women in the service.

   President Andres Rodriguez today denied
reports linking him to drug trafficking and said he will try to
curtail cocaine shipments through his country.
   Also today, Rodriguez's office announced that elections to choose
a new president and Congress will be held May 1.
   The army general, who took power in a coup Friday, also said his
overthrow of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner was necessary for the sake of
the country, but he said Stroessner might be allowed to return from
exile in the future.
   Stroessner, who ruled for 34 years as president and
commander-in-chief of the armed forces, left Paraguay on Sunday to
the jeers of ``Dictator Get Out!'' He was in a remote farming town
in central Brazil, and the Brazilian Foreign Ministry said today he
would remain there indefinitely.
   ``I detest drugs,'' Rodriguez said. ``I swear as a Catholic and
as a family man, I swear on my children, I have no connections with
drugs,'' Rodriguez told The Associated Press.
   At a news conference earlier at the National Palace, he said
allegations he protects or sponsors drug shipments ``were spread by
people trying to defame me.''
   He said he would cooperate with foreign governments and agencies,
including the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, to curtail the
flow of illegal drugs through Paraguay.
   Rodriguez said he ousted Stroessner because the general ``was not
producing good results for his party, which had trusted him.''
   The remark was an apparent reference to jockeying for power and
infighting between pro-Stroessner militants within the ruling
Colorado Party and those who wanted to distance the group somewhat
from the 76-year-old Stroessner.
   Rodriguez, 65, added, ``(He) was not a dictator. His situation is
being studied by the court system. He could come back in two or
three years. He has gone for a rest in Brazil.''
   He dismissed reports from diplomatic sources and local media that
casualties from fighting during the coup topped 300. ``Believe me,
total casualties _ dead plus injured _ do not exceed 50,'' he said.
   The government has issued no official tally
   As soon as Rodriguez was sworn in Friday, talk began about
allegations he allowed drug traffickers to use Paraguay to move
cocaine out of South America.
   The Buenos Aires Herald commented in an editorial Saturday:
``There are reasons to link him (Rodriguez) to the rampant
corruption and even the drug trafficking under the Stroessner
regime.... Yesterday's events (the coup) might not improve the
system and could even make things worse if Rodriguez becomes the
Manuel Noriega of the region.''
   Noriega, Panama's military ruler, was indicated on drug
trafficking charges in the United States last year. He has denied
the allegations.
   A high-ranking foreign diplomat acknowledged rumors that
Rodriguez allowed traffickers to use an airstrip he owns near the
border with Bolivia, but said: ``Absolutely no proof of that has
ever been offered.''
   Stroessner flew to Campinas, 290 miles southwest of Rio de
Janeiro, then took a Brazilian air force plane to the rural town of
Itumbiara, 800 miles northwest of Rio, a Brazilian Foreign Ministry
communique said.
   The deposed dictator, accompanied by a son and daughter-in-law,
three security guards, a Brazilian diplomat and 12 aides, was
staying in a guest house owned by the government-run Furnas electric
company, the communique said.
   Brazilian Ambassador Orlando Carbonar told The Associated Press
that his nation granted Stroessner asylum on humanitarian grounds.
Stroessner owns a beachfront mansion in the Atlantic coastal resort
of Guaratuba.
   The new government quickly promised democratic reforms, including
allowing opposition parties to participate in elections.
   One opposition leader suggested that elections be delayed because
his group and others needed time to organize to have any chance of
defeating the entrenched Colorado Party, which has been in power
since 1940.
   ``If Gen. Rodriguez is realistic, he should stay in power for a
minimum of two years and make changes in the electoral law that will
permit the organization of parties, and then call elections on the
basis of equality,'' said Fernando Levi Rufinelli of the Liberal
Party.

<HEAD>Paraguayan Press Conference: Armed MPs, Nervous Aides &amp; Confusion</HEAD>

   Apparently, no one told the president's
military police about his press conference.
   So, it was a little surprising Monday when the raucous reporters
who were invited into Lopez Palace for the first news conference
with a Paraguayan leader in anyone's memory ran headlong into the
armed guards outside an ornate ballroom.
   Brandishing their Brazilian-made assault rifles, the guards in
green uniforms, white helmets and ascots chased the correspondents
away from the ballroom, the site of the news conference.
   Soon, however, the nervous aides to President Andres Rodriguez,
who seized power in a military coup four days ago, cleared up the
mixup with the guards. The reporters were led into the ballroom.
   There, amid colonial-style chandeliers, historic oil paintings
and the oriental rugs was a table and a large, upholstered chair for
the president from which to preside at the unprecedented news
conference.
   Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, the dictator overthrown Friday by
Rodriguez, never held an actual news conference in his nearly 35
years in power. He rarely would meet with small groups of
journalists but old-time Paraguayans could not recall any former
leader taking direct, uncensored questions from reporters.
   Perhaps that was why the Paraguayans seemed so unprepared.
   There was no microphone or public address system for the
president, no place for tape recorders and no platform for TV
cameras.
   The journalists furiously began stringing wires and cables, and
they jostled for places around the table. Furniture was rearranged,
and reporters who couldn't get near the nment officials pleaded. ``Get
away from the table! Leave the
chairs along!'' But the reporters, who had gathered at the downtown
palace at 6 a.m. and had waited hours for the news conference,
jammed in closer.
   Authorities then announced Rodriguez would meet with reporters in
small groups downstairs in his office.
   That sent the pack _ swearing in several languages _ surging out
of the ballroom and back toward the red-carpeted staircase.
   Once more, the MPs moved in. Finally, journalists in bunches of
five to 10 got to meet Rodriguez.
   Standing behind a mahogany desk, wearing a dark business suit and
fiddling with gold-framed glasses, the 65-year-old general calmly
answered touchy questions on drug trafficking, political
persecution, car theft and harboring international criminals.
   His edgy aides, apparently thinking that anything simmilar under
Stroessner would have meant bad consequences for the questioner,
stared stoically at the walls.
   But Rodriguez smiled and thanked the journalists warmly for
coming. Pleading fatigue, the aides said he could not meet with
about 50 to 75 more correspondents still jammed in the entrance hall.
   There was no word about the next presidential news conference.

   France's foreign minister obtained an assurance
from officials in Iran that some foreign hostages held in Lebanon
will soon be freed, the official Kuwait News Agency reported today.
   KUNA, quoting diplomats traveling with Foreign Minister Roland
Dumas, said ``he obtained a promise from responsible officials there
(Tehran) that a number of Western hostages held in Lebanon will be
released within a short period.''
   The diplomats did not elaborate, KUNA said.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati told a Tehran news
conference shortly before Dumas left that France and Iran had agreed
``to forget the past and think of expanding mutual ties in the
future.''
   But Velayati also accused France of not keeping a promise to free
Anis Naccache, the leader of a pro-Iranian hit squad jailed for
attempting to assassinate a former Iranian prime minister.
   Dumas flew to Kuwait after a two-day visit to Iran, the first by
a ranking French official since the 1979 Islamic revolution toppled
the pro-Western monarchy.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that Dumas
said leaving Iran his talks had been ``very fruitful.''
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Dumas as saying the
discussions had covered ways of settling disputes between the two
countries and ending strains in relations.
   There are 15 foreigners held hostage in Lebanon, and most are
believed held by pro-Iranian extremists.
   The hostages are nine Americans, an Italian, a Belgian, an
Irishman and three Britons. The hostage held longest is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.
He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   A Coast Guard cutter has been dispatched to tow a
Taiwanese ship that was abandoned north of Midway Island after it
burned last June and was left to drift, Coast Guard officials said
today.
   The 250-foot Zhe-Sheng had drifted more than 2,000 nautical miles
(about 2,300 miles) to a sea lane off the Washington coast, where it
was spotted by the Arco Juneau early Sunday.
   The ship was about 400 miles off Cape Flattery, which is the
extreme northwest tip of Washington state, according to Seaman
Angela Cropper of the Coast Guard Ofice in Seatte.
   The Coast Guard had confirmed that the ship was abandoned after a
fire on board last June, and left to drift about 300 miles north of
Midway Island, Ms. Cropper said.
   Crews of a Coast Guard reconnaissance plane from Sacramento,
Calif., and a jet from a base in Astoria, Ore., reported that the
ship appeared to have burned near the stern. There was no sign of
anyone aboard.
   The Coast Guard dispatched the 210-foot cutter Active to the
abandoned vessel and the ship was expected to arrive at the scene
this afternoon, Petty Officer Craig Herlihy said.
   The cutter will probably tow the Zhe-Sheng out of the waterways,
Ms. Cropper said.
   After the crew of the Active investigates, the Coast Guard likely
will get permission from the owners to sink the abandoned ship to
prevent it from becoming a hazard to navigation, Herlihy said.
   The Coast Guard was trying to find the owners of the vessel, he
said.

   Andre Cayette, a lawyer turned moviemaker who was
known for his films on crime and justice, has died at the age of 80.
   Cayette died at his home Sunday night of heart failure.
   In 1950, Cayette's ``Justice est Faite'' (``Justice is Done'')
won the Golden Lion award at the Venice film festival.
   He later made more films focusing on the weaknesses or errors of
the judicial system, notably ``Nous Sommes Tous des Assassins''
(``We Are All Murderers'') in 1951.
   ``His entire work is a long plea for justice to be more human,
less blindly following rules and rites that sometimes make it
pitiless if not inept,'' the newspaper Le Monde said of Cayatte.

<TEXT>
   A man accused of slaying 14 family
members before he went on a rampage in an Arkansas town and killed
two other people went on trial today as jury selection got under way.
   R. Gene Simmons, 48, already is on death row after his murder
conviction in May for the Dec. 28, 1987, shooting of two people in
Russellville, including a woman said to have refused his romantic
advances.
   The new trial is for the shooting and strangulation deaths of
Simmons' wife, Becky, 46; their seven children; two of the
children's spouses; and four of Simmons' grandchildren, one of whom
relatives say he fathered by one of his daughters. They were killed
in the days before the shootings at Russellville.
   Officials had summoned 90 persons today as potential jurors. By
noon, two had been chosen for the jury, a 22-year-old housewife and
a 76-year-old retired civilian employee of the Air Force.
   One of the 90 didn't make it to court this morning, and three
others were excused during preliminary questioning. Jury selection
was continuing.
   The current trial was moved from Russellville to Clarksville
because of pretrial publicity. Circuit Judge John S. Patterson
addressed that issue when he asked the potential jurors, ``Is there
anybody who has not heard anything about this case?'' Nobody raised
their hand.
   Patterson told them he realized that he ``cannot make you just
wipe things out of your mind and forget it,'' but that courtroom
verdicts must be based upon a higher quality of evidence than what
is reported in the media.
   Earlier today, the defense made an unsuccessful motion to let the
jury decide whether the deaths of Simmons' relatives were part of
the same criminal episode as the shootings in Russellville.
   The defense had argued that to try Simmons for the 14 killings,
after he has already been convicted of the two deaths in
Russellville, violates his right not to be tried twice for the same
crime. Patterson denied the motion to let the jury decide the issue,
just as he had earlier rejected the argument himself.
   Simmons was arrested in Russellville after a 40-minute shooting
spree in which he wielded two .22-caliber revolvers, wounding six
people at four businesses. Two of those victims died.
   Authorities went to Simmons' house and, after several hours,
broke into the house because the only door was barred from the
inside but no one answered. They found five bodies in the house. The
next day, they dug up seven bodies from a grave and found two more
bodies, both babies, in the trunks of cars parked on Simmons' land.
   It was the worst mass murder in state history and one of the
worst in U.S. history.
   Prosecutor John Bynum said he would ask for the death penalty.
   Patterson, who presided over Simmons' earlier trial, will preside
again and has decided that the prospective jurors will be questioned
one-by-one to help ensure that a fair jury is chosen. He followed
the same procedure in Simmons' trial in Ozark, where a jury was
chosen in 1{ days.
   Defense lawyers Robert E. ``Doc'' Irwin and John C. Harris said
jury selection in the new trial may take three days.
   ``Not only can you not find 12 people in Johnson County who
haven't heard about the case, you can't find 12 people in Arkansas,
or maybe even the United States,'' Harris said.
   At the end of his first trial, Simmons startled Patterson by
waiving the right to appeal and asking to be executed as soon as
possible.
   ``Let the torture and suffering in me end,'' Simmons said.
   But his June 27 execution date was set aside because a Roman
Catholic priest opposed to capital punishment, the Rev. Joseph
Franz, filed motions contending that Simmons was incompetent, that
his decision to waive his appeal rights was not a knowing and
intelligent act and that an appeal was mandatory.
   The state Supreme Court turned down Franz on all three points,
ruling that appeals were not mandatory if the defendant wanted to
waive them and that Simmons was both competent to do so and did so
knowingly and intelligently.
   A federal court in Little Rock is considering one aspect of
Franz's argument: whether the waiver was a knowing and intelligent
act.

   House Speaker Jim Wright, bowing to opponents
of a 51 percent congressional pay raise, announced today he would
order a roll call vote on the issue Tuesdy before the boost can take
effect.
   ``The majority has spoken and the majority will speak even more
emphatically tomorrow ... The majority will rule,'' he said.
   Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., chairman of the House Democratic
Caucus, predicted their would be ``no pay raise, no change'' in the
lawmakers' $89,500 salary.
   Wright, D-Texas, made the announcement from the House floor after
opponents of the $45,500 increase won a key procedural vote on the
subject, defeating an effort by the Democratic leadership to adjourn
the House until Tuesday.
   An attempt to adjourn is normally such a routine procedure that
it does not require a roll call vote. But in this case one was
ordered, and its rejected on a 238-88 vote that showed opponents
held the upper hand.
   The pay raise is scheduled to take effect at 12:01 a.m. on
Wednesday. The Senate already has voted against the raise.
   The vote and Wright's subsequent announcement came after Majority
Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., who was presiding over the day's House
session, refused to recognize a pay-raise opponent who wanted to
introduce a resolution calling for a vote on the hike.
   That set the stage for more than 30 minutes of barbed debate
between the two sides.
   Rep. Arthur S. Ravenel, R-S.C., said the House was engaging in a
``shameful pay raise conspiracy'' by taking a money without voting
for it.
   But Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., accused unnamed House members of
``hypocrisy'' by speaking out publicly against the raise and
indicating privately that they wanted the money.
   Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said she was going to be watching
public opponents of the raise carefully to see whether they pocket
the money. ``I hope the press will be watching,'' added Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich.
   The proposed congressional pay is part of a package that would
increase the salaries of federal judges as well as senior officials
and managers in the executive branch. For members of the House and
the Senate, the increase would amount to a raise from $89,500 to
$135,000 a year.
   It was not immediately clear whether the vote that Wright set for
Tuesday would affect the recommended increases for judges and
administration officials.
   Wright's decision to order the vote capped a remarkable retreat
for the speaker.
   As recently as last week he insisted there would be no vote on
the pay raise. He attempted to lessen the political damage by
spreading the word that the House would vote swiftly on legislation
that would ban payment for honoraria for speeches and impose other
curtailments on outside compensation.
   Later in the week, he conducted a private survey of House members
and said the results showed they did not want a vote before the
raise took effect. Despite that, random surveys by The Associated
Press and other organizations showed that sentiment was in favor of
a vote.
   By late last week, Wright had said he would seek to scale the 50
percent pay raise back to 30 percent while banning honoraria.
   Throughout the maneuvering, House Republican leaders lent their
silent support to Wright's efforts to avoid a vote. Minority Leader
Robert Michel, R-Ill., sat silently in his seat on the House floor
during today's debate and vote.
   The Senate voted 95-5 last Thursday to reject the entire raise
for Congress and other top federal officials, but it will become law
automatically Wednesday under a special procedure unless the House
also turns it down.
   The raise would apply to Congress, top Bush administration
political appointees and judges, but the Constitution prevents
reduction of judges' pay once they receive a raise.
   Under Wright's proposal to let the raise become law,
rank-and-file lawmakers would see their salaries rise Wednesday from
$89,500 to $135,000. The speaker's plan would scale that back to
$116,350.
   The Senate already has voted to offset the 51 percent raise
partially by banning honoraria while the higher pay is in effect.
The House plans to pass its own package to ban speaking fees and
limit other outside income.
   Public reaction to the congressional pay raise has been
overwhelmingly negative. Dozens of protesters shouting ``No pay
hike,'' ``Read our lips'' and ``Hey Mr. Speaker, haven't you heard,
50 percent is quite absurd,'' Sunday night met Democratic House
members returning to Union Station from a weekend retreat at the
luxurious Greenbrier resort in West Virginia.
   The lawmakers had earlier wondered aloud whether any strategy
would satisfy the public _ and let them keep a pay raise.
   ``It'll sort of be like Andy Warhol said: We'll be rich for 15
minutes,'' said Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y.
   While lawmakers wrestle with their own pay this week, they'll
also be working on solutions to protect the money that millions of
Americans have in shaky savings and loans. About 350 insolvent S&amp;Ls
remain operating after regulators ``rescued'' 205 last year with
promissory notes and loss guarantees.
   Bush met over the weekend with his top advisers on the S&amp;L issue,
and while he gave no clue to his intentions, administration
officials said an announcement could come early this week.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee, meanwhile, is expected to
vote by midweek on the nomination of former Sen. John G. Tower to be
secretary of defense. The vote will take place after the panel
receives an FBI report on what congressional sources say are new
allegations of drinking and womanizing by the Texas Republican.
   The 51 percent pay raise for Congress and executive branch
political appointees could remain in effect for some time if the two
houses are unable to resolve their differences.
   Wright emphasized last week that his 30 percent rollback wouldn't
be an increase at all _ but a dollar-for-dollar tradeoff _ for House
members who have been pocketing the honoraria maximum of $26,850 _
30 percent of salary. A Common Cause study showed that 108 House
members were at or near the limit in 1987.
   While the 51 percent raise is law, House members giving up the
maximum honoraria would gain $18,650 a year in the trade. Since
senators have been allowed to retain 40 percent of their salary in
honoraria _ $35,800 _ those at the maximum would gain $9,700
annually from the full raise.

   Historian and two-time Pulitzer
Prize-winner Barbara Tuchman was in critical condition Monday in
Greenwich Hospital, a spokeswoman said.
   Tuchman, 77, of Greenwich, was admitted Saturday, said hospital
spokeswoman Vicki Pitluk. She said Tuchman's family asked officials
not to disclose the nature of her illness.
   Tuchman's latest book, ``The First Salute,'' a look at the
American Revolution and the Dutch revolution that preceded it by 200
years, has been on The New York Times best seller list for more than
nine weeks.
   She won the Pulitzer for history for ``The Guns of August'' in
1962, and for ``Stilwell and the American Experience in China'' in
1971.
   She also wrote ``The Proud Tower,'' a story of Europe before
World War I, and ``A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century,''
which traced the tumult of the period by following the career of a
feudal lord.
   Tuchman said at an October book signing that she had not given
any thought to her next book.
   ``I don't really need a new project now,'' Tuchman said. ``I need
a good, long rest, really.''

   C. Bruce Solomonson, son-in-law of the
late Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, was sentenced to nearly four
years in prison today and ordered to pay back insurance companies he
was found guilty of defrauding.
   ``I just want to express to my family and friends my sincere
apologies for all the pain and suffering I have caused them,''
Solomonson told U.S. District Court Judge Edward Devitt before
sentencing. ``I'm an honest man, a loyal man and I never intended to
cause harm to them.''
   Solomonson, 47, was convicted in December on nine counts of
fraud. Prosecution witnesses testified he diverted more than $1.5
million from his two Edina insurance agencies to his personal use.
   The jury found that he altered company books to hide the illegal
transactions. He was found guilty of one count of bank fraud and
eight counts of mail fraud.
   Devitt ordered Solomonson to pay $616,761 as full restitution to
seven insurance companies which Devitt said ``are victims of
defendant's crimes.'' Solomonson brokered insurance for the seven
companies. In addition to the money taken from the insurance
companies, he was convicted of taking money from the partners in his
insurance agencies.
   Devitt sentenced Solomonson to 46 months on each of the nine
counts, but ordered that they be served concurrently. He also
imposed five years' probation, and said Solomonson won't be eligible
for probation unless he complies with the restitution order.
   Solomonson's wife, the former Nancy Humphrey, and his
mother-in-law, Muriel Humphrey Brown, and other family members
attended the sentencing hearing. The late Hubert Humphrey, a
longtime Democratic U.S. senator as well as vice president under
Lyndon Johnson, died in 1978.
   Assistant U.S. District Attorney Henry Shea asked for a stiff
sentence, but did not specify the length of sentence he desired.

<HEAD>Rehnquist Calls for Reform To Stop Execution Delays ^Eds: For release
at 4 p.m. EST.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist called Monday
for reform in a death penalty system that he said invites delays in
executions that extend for years.
   Rehnquist, in a speech prepared for the American Bar Association,
acknowledged that federal courts have overturned many state
convictions in death-penalty cases. The NAACP legal defense and
educational fund says about 40 percent of state death penalty
convictions and sentences are overturned by federal courts.
   ``But to my mind the flaw in the present system is not that
capital sentences are set aside by federal courts, but that
litigation ultimately resolved in favor of the states takes
literally years and years and years,'' Rehnquist said.
   The chief justice cited the most recent execution in the country,
that of serial killer Ted Bundy in Florida on Jan. 24, as an example
of a system of death penalty appeals that is often ``chaotic and
drawn out unnecessarily.''
   Rehnquist noted that the Supreme Court turned down three separate
emergency pleas in Bundy's behalf hours before he was put to death.
   ``All three of these actions were being prosecuted simultaneously
on the day before the execution of a prisoner who had been on death
row for nine years,'' he said. ``Surely it would be a bold person to
say that this system could not be improved.''
   Rehnquist, renewing an appeal he made about a year ago to a
conference of state chief justices, urged the ABA to support reform
of the death penalty appeal process.
   Retired Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell was appointed by
Rehnquist to head a committee of federal judges looking into the
question, and the ABA also has a panel studying the issue.
   Rehnquist said he is not calling for a drastic curtailing of the
right of convicted killers to appeal to the federal courts for help
_ a process known as federal habeas corpus.
   Rather, the chief justice said, he is seeking ``modest changes
which will impose some structure'' on a system in which the average
time elapsed between the commission of a crime and execution is
eight years nationally and more than 13 years in some states. There
are more than 2,000 prisoners on death row nationwide.
   Since 1976, when the Supreme Court allowed states to reinstate
the death penalty, there have been 106 executions nationwide.
   More than 11,000 federal court appeals were filed last year in
death penalty cases.
   Rehnquist endorsed a requirement that all such appeals be
consolidated in ``one petition and filed within a reasonable time''
after state court appeals have been exhausted. He also said states
could promote speedier resolution of death penalty cases by giving
incentives for lawyers to represent those filing federal appeals.
   On another subject, Rehnquist reiterated his endorsement of a 50
percent increase in pay for federal judges that will take effect
Wednesday unless blocked before then by both houses of Congress. The
judicial pay increase is part of a package that includes a similar
hike for members of Congress.
   ``These increases simply restore to federal judges the purchasing
power that has been eaten away by inflation over the past 20
years,'' Rehnquist said. ``They are essential if we are to continue
to attract from the financially greener fields of private practice
the sort of experienced and capable lawyers whom we want as judges.''
   Rehnquist also proposed some changes aimed at reducing the
workload for the federal courts.
   For example, he said someone from one state suing someone from
another state should not have an automatic right to take the case to
federal court on that basis.

<HEAD>Productivity Unchanged In Fourth Quarter; Up 1.4 Percent For 1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By John King</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American workers increased their productivity
by 1.4 percent last year, the government reported Monday, an
improvement over 1987 that nonetheless revived doubts about economic
projections at the heart of President Bush's spending plans.
   The 1.4 percent gain in non-farm business productivity was up
from 0.8 percent in 1987 and matched the average 1.4 percent annual
gain experienced since the end of the 1981-82 recession, the Labor
Department reported.
   Increased productivity _ getting each worker to produce more each
hour he or she is on the job _ is vital to economic growth without
inflation, particularly given the current squeeze in the labor
market.
   Total business productivity, including farming, fell at a 2.0
percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1988 because of a drop
in farm productivity. Manufacturers reported a 3.2 percent increase
in productivity last year, down from 3.4 percent in 1987, the Labor
Department said.
   In his final budget, former President Reagan forecasted a 1.2
percent productivity gain in 1989, a 1.8 percent rise in 1990, a 2
percent jump in 1991 and 2.1 percent increases the next three years.
That forecast, adopted by Bush fiscal advisers, calls for average
annual productivity gains of 1.9 percent for 1989-1994. But analysts
said there was nothing in the 1988 productivity report to suggest
that type of improvement would occur, particularly at a time of slow
labor force growth.
   Meeting those targets would be essential to reaching the more
than 3 percent average annual economic growth called for in the
budget forecast without a significant increase in inflation. Indeed,
the budget blueprint assumes higher productivity and lower
inflation, something most analysts say is improbable.
   ``Nobody believes that forecast, not even the guys who wrote
it,'' said Michael Evans, president of Evans Economics of
Washington. ``There really is no chance of productivity doubling in
the next few years, under any conceivable circumstances that I can
see.''
   Evans attributed the overall productivity gain in 1988 to the
rapid economic expansion early in the year, citing unchanged
productivity in the fourth quarter and the smaller 0.7 percent
change in the final quarter compared to the same period of 1987.
   ``That is extremely sluggish growth in productivity,'' said Evans.
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan last week also
questioned the likelihood of 3 percent or higher annual economic
growth and declining inflation as assumed in the budget forecast.
Greenspan is expected to move to tighten the central bank's reins on
credit _ thereby slowing economic growth _ when its Open Market
Committee meets this week to set 1989 monetary targets.
   If, as expected, the Fed moves to slow economic growth to about
2.5 percent a year, productivity would be affected as well and gains
in the next five years likely will average 1.4 percent as they have
the past six years, said economist Roger Brinner of Data Resources
Inc., a Lexington, Mass.,-based forecasting firm.
   ``What happens when the economy slows down is that you get a
cyclical reduction in productivity,'' Brinner said. ``That's a
problem for the Bush administration.''

   Four men were rescued from a cave
Monday after being stranded for nearly 17 hours when their only
flashlight stopped operating, police said.
   The men were cold and hungry but uninjured when members of the
Chattanooga Police Rescue Squad found them about 10 a.m., said
police spokesman Vince Dean.
   The men, all 22 years old, went into Airplane Cave below Raccoon
Mountain about 5 p.m. Sunday, apparently intending to stay no more
than an hour, Dean said.
   But soon the batteries in the flashlight went dead, so they
decided to wait in the dark until their families became worried and
sent for help, he said.
   ``They were not experienced (cavers),'' said the police spokesman.
   They were identified as Steven Brooks, Clayton Waller, Manual
Watson and George Beason, all from Chattanooga, said Dean.

   Avant-garde theater producer and director
Aldo Trionfo died Monday of an apparent heart attack at his home. He
was 68.
   Trionfo had survived three earlier heart attacks, which had
limited his activities during recent years.
   Born Feb. 5, 1921, to a Jewish family living in Genoa, Trionfo
spent his early school years in his hometown. His family later fled
to Switzerland to escape Nazi persecution.
   After receiving an engineering degree at Lausanne, Trionfo
returned to Genoa, where he became interested in cinema. He later
gave up cinema for the stage, and in 1957 founded the Borsa
d'Arlecchino _ or Harlequin Exchange _ a cafe theater where he
presented his first experimental productions.
   Among the works he interpreted were ``Drums in the Night'' by
Brecht and ``Titus Andronicus'' by Shakespeare.
   He served as artistic director of the Turin theater from 1972 to
1976.
   Trionfo, who was not married, is survived by a sister.

   A stripper who said she performed sex acts while
television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart watched denied Monday that she
made up her story to cash in on publicity surrounding a similar
story last year.
   Catherine Mary Kampen said she received anonymous offers of hush
money to stop publication of the allegations, which appeared last
week in Penthouse magazine, and received threats before and after
publication.
   Swaggart said last week there was no truth to the story and
Kampen's employer called it a ``pornographic fairy tale'' invented
for financial gain.
   ``Every word that's written in this magazine is true,'' Kampen
declared Monday at a news conference.
   She and a magazine spokeswoman declined to say how much she
received for her cooperation, but Kampen said, ``It was such a small
sum of money that it really is inconsequential.''
   Swaggart last February confessed to an undisclosed sin involving
a prostitute and was later defrocked by the Assemblies of God
ministry.
   She said she offered to tell her story to reporter Art Harris for
free, and did not receive the money until long after she talked to
him in the spring of 1988.
   ``If I was going to make something up, to cash in on something, I
surely wouldn't have made this up,'' she said at a news conference
at Penthouse offices, noting that the story ``does not exactly put
me in a good light.''

<HEAD>Former Refuseniks Ask For Pollard Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Soviet political prisoners appealed to
President Bush on Monday to pardon Jonathan Pollard and his wife,
who were convicted in a spy case involving Israel.
   ``Please grant them their freedom and, should they wish to come
to Israel, we will gratefully receive them into our community,''
said their petition.
   The appeal was presented to the U.S. Consulate in West Jerusalem
at a rally that drew around 50 people, about half of them former
Soviet refuseniks _ Jews who have been denied emigration.
   The rally was sponsored by the Organization of Soviet Prisoners
of Zion, a group uniting immigrants who have been in Soviet prisons
for Zionist activity.
   ``Jonathan Pollard understood the tragic history of our people
and acted with desperate urgency to protect the people of Israel,''
the petition said. ``His course of action, though unwise, was not
intended to hurt his country but to prevent another tragedy for the
remaining Jewish people.''
   Yosef Begun, the former refusenik who waged a 17-year battle to
emigrate and spent a decade in and out of jail, stood near Ida
Nudel, known as the ``guardian angel'' of refuseniks before her 1987
emigration. They held a sign with portraits of Pollard and his wife,
Anne Henderson-Pollard.
   The appeal was the latest in a series from Israel seeking freedom
for Polland and his wife. Last month, the Israeli parliament passed
a resolution urging they be freed.
   Miss Nudel said on Israel army radio the Pollards were ``hostages
in a foreign country'' and appealed for better medical treatment for
Mrs. Henderson-Pollard.
   Pollard, arrested in 1985, is serving a life sentence in the
United States for selling top-secret military documents to Israel.
His wife was sentenced in March 1987 to five years in prison for
conspiracy to receive embezzled government property.
   She has suffered from a chronic digestive tract disease and was
transferred last month to a prison hospital in Rochester, Minn.,
after collapsing at a minimum-security prison in Danbury, Conn.
Relatives have alleged she did not receive proper treatment.
   The demonstrators, who also included 20 Americans in Israel as
volunteers with the B'nai Brith organization, carried placards
reading ``Jonathan didn't harm the U.S. Why, then, the maximum
sentence?'' and ``Was Anne's five-year sentence meant to be a death
sentence?''

<HEAD>Bond Program Would Help Young Families Afford Homes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   First-time homebuyers would be guaranteed a
down payment by investing in state bonds under a program Gov. James
Blanchard said Monday is designed to give everyone a crack at the
American dream.
   ``Anything government can do to help the next generation realize
their dreams is extremely important. I think this program will not
only work, but sweep the country,'' Blanchard said of the Home
Ownership Savings Trust Program he plans to announce Tuesday night
in his State of the State address.
   Details of the program still are being worked out, but Blanchard
said the goal of the program he hopes will begin this year is to
help young families save the 5 percent or 10 percent down payment
they need to buy a house.
   Prospective homeowners would give the state a lump sum or make
monthly payments to buy tax-free bonds, like an $800 million issue
approved by voters in November for environmental cleanup and parks.
At the end of a contract that could range from three to 10 years,
the families would have enough for a down payment for a house in a
price range they chose at the outset. If prices go up faster than
expected, the state would make up the difference; if they go up
slower, the state would keep the difference.
   The approachh is similar to the Michigan Education Trust, in
which parents pay a lump sum to guarantee their child's tuition at
one of 15 universities or 29 community colleges. Officials estimate
college tuition could ach $25,000 in 18 years; It cost about $6,800
to enroll a newborn in the trust last year. More than 40,000
children were enrolled for a total investment of $265 million.
   State Department of Treasury officials believe the program can be
started without approval from the Legislature.
   ``The state is not spending money at all. You're guaranteeing,
that's all,'' Blanchard said. ``In this case, you're also using
tax-free bonds that we would have to pay for anyway.
   ``Usually, tax-free bonds are sold in denominations of $5,000,
$10,000 or $100,000. In this program, we're going to sell them in
small units so young couples can buy them and have the tax-free
status of the interest earned.''
   The program will help reverse the trend of declining home
ownership among young couples and a declining rate of savings, he
said. ``It deals with a whole range of problems I've seen in our
society. We've got a whole new generation of people that may not
have the same opportunities that we have.''

   Kitty Dukakis, the wife of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis,
has entered an alcohol treatment program, according to a statement
issued by the governor today that blamed the problem on the letdown
after his failed presidential campaign.
   Mrs. Dukakis, 52, has had a history of addictions and chemical
dependency but was never known to be dependent on alcohol until the
statement was released this afternoon.
   In July 1987, Mrs. Dukakis announced that she had recovered from
a 26-year dependency on diet pills. The governor's wife said she had
conquered her addiction to amphetamines, which she hid from her
husband, after undergoing treatment at a Minnesota facility in 1982.
   Dukakis said today that his wife entered the Edgehill Newport
facility in Newport, R.I., Sunday evening and will stay there for
about 30 days.
   ``Until shortly after election day on Nov. 8, Kitty had never had
a problem with alcohol,'' Dukakis said.
   ``Unfortunately, a combination of physical exhaustion, the stress
of the campaign effort and the post-election letdown all combined to
create a situation in which, on a limited number of occasions while
at home, she has used alcohol in excessive quantities,'' the
governor said.
   Dukakis' press office did not answer questions about the
statement but said the governor would hold a news conference later
today.
   Dukakis, who last month abruptly announced that he would not seek
a fourth term as govenor, said in his statement that Mrs. Dukakis
decided to enter the well-known clinic voluntarily and said he and
his family supported her decision.
   ``We know how loved and respected she is both here in the
commonwealth and across the nation _ and she is grateful for the
love and support she has received from so many good and decent
people,'' Dukakis said.
   Mrs. Dukakis, who won high marks as a political campaigner during
her husband's 1988 presidential effort, has been prominent in the
fight to educate youngsters against the perils of drug and alcohol
abuse.
   Since the presidential defeat, Mrs. Dukakis has launched a new
career as an author and lecturer and has not appeared at her
husband's side on several occasions when she might have been
expected.
   On Jan. 3, for example, when Dukakis made the surprise
announcement that he would not seek a fourth term as governor, some
observers remarked on the fact that Mrs. Dukakis was not present.
   Last week, the governor and first lady celebrated the birth of
their first grandchild _ Alexandra Jane Dukakis, the daughter of
John and Lisa Dukakis.
   In July 1987, Mrs. Dukakis _ with her husband at her side _
revealed that she had been drug-free for five years after seeking
treatment at the Hazelton Center in Centre City, Minn.
   Mrs. Dukakis said she began taking mild amphetamines in 1956 as a
teen-ager to control her weight. She continued the practice
secretively for two decades and said her husband did not know of her
dependency when they married in June 1963.
   The governor first discovered her drug problem in 1974. Mrs.
Dukakis said they discussed the issue and that she stopped taking
the pills for a while.
   In 1982, Dukakis discovered that his wife was again taking pills,
and the couple decided that Mrs. Dukakis should seek the clinic's
help. She entered the 30-day Minnesota program on July 14, 1982.
   In 1982, the public was told that Mrs. Dukakis was suffering from
hepatitis.
   When she announced in 1987 the real reason for her disappearance
from the public scene five years earlier, she said: ``after five
years of being chemical-free, I feel strong and confident in myself
and what I've done. And secondly, and as important or more
important, one of the tenets of recovering is helping other people.
It's important for me to talk about this publicly, to try to help
other people who have the same kind of dependency.''
   Edgehill Newport was founded in 1980 and is described as the
largest private alcohol treatment center in New England.
   New patients are put through a detoxification center, then
transferred to other rooms for the balance of the 28-day program. It
includes intensive counseling and emphasis on rest and proper diet.

   The post office is among the nation's oldest in an original site
and has been used several times as a movie location because of its
old-fashioned look. But stardom doesn't turn the head of its
postmaster, who once refused to let a film crew take down the
American flag flying over the building.
   Now it's combination-lock boxes, hand-sorter slots and original
hand canceler will all soon be part of the past. Land for a new
building has been selected about 500 feet to the north, and the
postal department is getting ready to take bids.
   Postmaster Reba Nolan says she hates to move out of the colorful
general store that draws visitors from across the nation, but she
says a new building is an absolute necessity for this East Texas
town of about 400.
   ``We're bursting out the seams,'' Mrs. Nolan said last week.
``I'm literally crawling over the mail to get out the door.''
   But Mrs. Nolan, who has been postmaster four years, says she
hopes the general store's owners will keep the post office intact as
a well-preserved page of American history.
   Mrs. Nolan still cancels Jonesville mail with the post office's
original hand canceler. Also intact is an old-fashioned service
window with metal bars that has been featured in several movies.
   The post office was once saved from closing by Mrs. Nolan's
predecessor, Emma Vaughan.
   Mrs. Vaughan, whose husband owns the general store and still
operates it, said she took the job in 1949 after learning she was
the only one in town with a Civil Service rating.
   ``I had to take it because I was the only one that was
qualified,'' Mrs. Vaughan said. ``We knew that if it closed, we'd
never get another one. I agreed to keep it for six months _ but I
stayed 38 years.''
   She initially made $1,000 annually as the Jonesville postmaster.
Mrs. Vaughan said her salary had increased 25-fold by the time she
retired.
   Mrs. Vaughan said she hates to see progress force the post office
out of her husband's store but said her family is part of the reason
it has to move.
   ``My son owns an oil company and his mail volume has really
increased,'' she said.
   Mrs. Nolan is only the fourth Jonesville postmaster since World
War I. She had a run-in several years ago with the people filming a
remake of ``The Long Hot Summer,'' which starred Don Johnson, Cybill
Shepherd and Jason Robards.
   She said she let the production crew pretty much have the run of
the post office, but drew a hard line when she saw them taking down
the post office's American flag.
   They explained the halyard was clanging against the flagpole in a
brisk Texas wind and was ruining the movie's sound track. They
begged her to let them take it down, but she was staunch in her
refusal.
   ``I told them they could just have someone shinny up the pole and
hold it down if they wanted it quiet, but it wasn't coming down,''
she said.

<HEAD>Groups Seek Reappraisal of 1956 Revolt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Official and independent groups Monday
increased pressure on Hungarian leaders to accept a Communist Party
reformer's appraisal of the 1956 revolt as a popular uprising.
   MTI state news agency carried statements giving unqualified
backing to Politburo member Imre Pozsgay. He stunned Hungarians nine
days ago when he said in a radio interview the 1956 revolt, crushed
by Soviet tanks, was a popular uprising.
   For three decades, the revolt officially has been branded a
counterrevolution instigated from abroad to destroy communism.
Pozsgay's statement touched off differences with other party leaders.
   MTI released statements of the official Hungarian Writers' Union
and revived Smallholders' Party as well as of an alliance of 15
independent political groups, including the Union of Young Democrats
and Hungarian Democratic Forum.
   They appear designed to bolster Pozsgay, after the reformer was
rebuked by party chief Karoly Grosz, other senior officials and the
Ferenc Muennich Society, a club of conservative communists opposing
Hungary's fast-moving reform movement.
   Apparently reacting to his critics in the party, Pozsgay toned
down his statement Saturday, telling a workers' meeting ``popular
uprising ... is not a final formula or a verdict but one recommended
... in the spirit of reconciliation with the people.''
   Pozsgay has to answer for his stand at a special Central
Committee meeting Friday.
   The Smallholders said they consider October 1956 ``as a national
uprising and a revolution against Stalinism,'' and find Pozsgay's
reappraisal ``a compromise acceptable for society.''
   The other independent groups said political cooperation with the
communists is conceivable only ``if there is a just historical
appraisal and a revised outlook on the popular uprising unleashed in
1956 against the Stalinist party state.''
   Over the weekend, the daughter of revolt leader Imre Nagy and
widows of two Nagy colleagues executed for their part in the 1956
uprising, appeared on television for the first time in 32 years.
They called for a public reburial of their relatives.
   Nagy was executed by the Soviets, whom the Hungarian leadership
invited to crush the revolt.
   The official Hungarian Roman Catholic weekly Uj Ember, meanwhile,
reported that the 1948 trial and life sentencing of the late
Cardinal Jozsef Mindszenty was rigged.
   Uj Ember said published documents show his trial ``was carried
out according to a pre-planned and prepared concept.''
   The former primate of the Hungarian Catholic Church was arrested
in 1948 as an enemy of communism and, following a humiliating trial,
was sentenced to life imprisonment under false charges of high
treason.
   In 1956, the cardinal was freed from prison by Hungarian
revolutionaries. After the uprising, he found permanent shelter in
the U.S. Legation in Budapest.
   In 1971, under an agreement between the Vatican and the Hungarian
government, Mindszenty left his asylum at the American mission and
after a short stay in Rome settled in Vienna, where he died in May
1975 at age 83.

   Outdated state laws aimed at preventing child
abuse have allowed some organizations to act as illegal police
forces, glorified gun clubs and fronts for drug rings, the state
attorney general said Monday.
   Legislators should repeal the 1875 law that authorizes creation
of societies for the prevention of cruelty to children, Attorney
General Robert Abrams said in his report on a year-long
investigation.
   ``Many of them have become para-police organizations with no
legitimate purpose having to do with children at all,'' Abrams said.
   Some groups have cars and uniforms, patrolling the streets and
arresting people for traffic violations, according to the report.
Members deceive people into thinking they're police officers and
have caches of firearms. Federal drug agents taped a conversation of
a Sullivan County member bragging that he uses SPCC credentials to
make drug dealing easier, the attorney general said.
   The 1875 law was passed at a time when government agencies played
no role in child protection. Lawmakers gave SPCC officers peace
officer status, meaning they can carry handguns and make arrests,
and gave them the right to enforce ``all laws relating to or
affecting children,'' said Abrams' report.
   New York has 24 licensed SPCCs. Seven, all formed before 1920,
act as social service agencies and don't use peace officer powers.
The remainder, all but one formed after 1972, ``either have a
distinct law enforcement orientation ... or do nothing at all,''
Abrams said. Five of these have dissolved and five are in the
process. There are only three such societies outside New York.
   Abrams said groups in Nassau County and Brooklyn have
applications pending for new SPCC's, but he's opposing them in
court. He is calling for the deletion of SPCC agents from the list
of peace officers, and is proposing that the state Department of
Social Services be given the authority to supervise all SPCC's.
   Among the problems detailed in the report were:
   _A Westchester County society that searched a 16-year-old boy at
gunpoint and bound him to a chair overnight. Abrams obtained an
injunction barring that group from detaining suspects anywhere but
in jails.
   _A Suffolk County society was investigating the illegal sale of
alcohol to minors in bars.
   _Long Island society members pulled cars over on New York City
highways, in one case drawing guns and telling the person they were
police.
   _A Sullivan County society member said in a tape-recorded
conversation that his status gave him access to weapons and less
scrutiny when stopped by police. He was arrested on charges of
selling cocaine to an undercover federal agent.
   Investigators found no evidence that any organizations obstructed
child abuse investigations. If someone with a legitimate abuse
complaint calls one of the societies, they're generally told to
contact a social service agency.
   Kenneth Ellman, head of the Westchester County SPCC, criticized
Abrams and said the state needed more SPCC services, not less. These
organizations give people an option when other state agencies have
failed, he said.

<HEAD>Millions Take a Dip for Salvation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALLAHABAD, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of barefoot Hindus from across
India jostled and pushed their way to take a dip at the confluence
of two sacred rivers Monday in hopes it would bring them eternal
salvation.
   An estimated 15 million people bathed at river banks in this
central Indian city during the day, many starting as early as 4
a.m., authorities said.
   Hindus believe that Lord Brahma, the creator of the Earth and one
of the ruling trinity of a pantheon of gods and goddesses, awakes at
that hour.
   The bathing is the high point of the seven-week Kumbh Mela
festival, which according to the Guinness Book of World Records is
the largest religious gathering on Earth.
   ``The grand show was a grand success,'' said Ravindra Gupta, the
chief administrator of Allahabad. ``It was a difficult day for us
but it's over.''
   His relief came from the fact that the fair _ a logistical
nightmare at the best of times _ had ended without any major
problems.
   Stampedes and armed confrontations between different Hindu sects
have claimed hundreds of lives in previous fairs. In 1954, at least
800 people died in a stampede.
   Police said four people died Monday. Two were drowned when their
boat capsized in midstream and two others died of natural causes,
said Superintendent Vibhuti Narain Rai.
   Authorities make arrangements for the supply of 13,000 gallons of
milk, 10 tons of butter and 5 tons of cheese to the pilgrims every
day. Allahabad city officials have also stockpiled 10,000 tons of
wheat, 4,000 tons of rice and 2,000 tons of sugar.
   The Kumbh Mela is celebrated every 12 years when a rare planetary
configuration occurs: Jupiter in Taurus, the sun and moon in
Capricorn, and a series of complicated calculations of Hindu
astrology.
   Monday is considered the climax of the festival, which started
Jan. 14, because it is also the day of the new moon, another good
omen.
   The festival takes its name of Kumbh Mela from Hindu mythology
when the gods seized a pot of nectar that made them invincible in
their war against the demons.
   A drop of nectar from the gods' pot is thought to have fallen at
Allahabad where the Ganges and Jamuna rivers come together. A bath
at the spot where the nectar fell is supposed to bring salvation
from the cycle of birth and rebirth.
   The pilgrims were a diverse lot. Holy men from Himalayan cave
homes and naked recluses from forest dens came to the river banks in
chariots and on camels draped with brightly embroidered cloths.
   Most trekked to the bathing spots but some came on horseback and
the more affluent in Mercedes salons.
   The bathing at the Kumbh Mela began with processions of holy men,
their order determined from days of yore according to the importance
of their sects, dipping at the confluence of the Ganges, the Yamuna
and the mythical Swaraswati. The Swaraswati cannot be seen, but
Hindus believe it flows beneath the Earth's surface where the two
other rivers meet.
   The rivers turned muddy brown and foul smelling as more bathers
immersed themselves. Many used empty liquor bottles and pots to
carry the holy water home.
   ``Either these people are crazy or there must be something we
can't see or understand,'' said Nina Marshall, 23, of Berkeley,
Calif.
   ``It is vibrating,'' she said, pointing to the barefoot pilgrims
walking to the junction of the Ganges and Jamuna rivers. She was
among dozens of Americans who had come to see the unique religious
spectacle.
   For the faithful, the bathing is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
   ``I planned this trip five years back when we had a good crop,''
said Sarju Mahato, a farmer from Bihar state, as he tended the
blisters on his two sons' feet. ``We saved money and came here.''
   Ganesh Dasgupta, a railroad worker from Calcutta, brought his
family of six and said with satisfaction: ``I have got what I
wanted. A bath here is equal to visiting all the pilgrim centers in
the country.''

<HEAD>Iran Says It Will Use Diplomacy to Export Revolution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EFTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran will use diplomacy to export its Islamic
revolution, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said Monday, but he
appeared unwilling to use that persuasion on Tehran's biggest foes,
Washington and Iraq.
   Iran will hold direct peace talks with Iraq ``soon,'' but they
will make no progress unless Iraqi troops withdraw from Iranian
territory, Velayati told a news conference.
   He also said better relations with the United States are possible
only if Washington changes its hostile posture toward Iran's
revolution.
   ``We have a concept and we are going to continue the policy to
export the revolution,'' said Velayati. ``But this doesn't mean
we're going to export the revolution with a gun.
   ``You're trying to make other people in the world to be
Western-oriented,'' he told scores of foreign reporters in Tehran
for 10th anniversary celebrations of the revolution. ``We're going
to do the same on the basis of our Islamic beliefs and concepts,''
he said.
   Iran has been restoring relations with Western countries and its
gulf neighbors in a new open-door policy aimed at ending a decade of
self-imposed isolation.
   ``Except for the Palestine-occupying regime (Israel) and the
racist South African regime, and precluding American sabotage, we
desire good relations with other countries of the world,'' Velayati
said.
   The Tehran hierarchy is deeply divided over restoring links with
the United States, severed in 1979.
   Tehran's so-called pragmatists have united, however, to make it
clear Iran has backed off the militant export of its fundamentalist
revolution since the Aug. 20 U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in Iran's
eight-year war with Iraq.
   Velayati said peace talks with Iraq were effectively deadlocked,
and Baghdad was making no effort to get them going again.
   ``If Iraq adopts a stubborn attitude and refuses to retreat the
talks will get nowhere,'' he said.
   He gave no date for resuming the talks, deadlocked since last
November over the issue of troop withdrawals.
   Both Velayati and Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz are due in
New York this week for talks with U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar that could bring the two face-to-face.
   Meanwhile, Aziz sent a letter to Perez de Cuellar saying Iraq
rejects any Iranian preconditions for resuming talks, the official
Iraqi News Agency reported Monday.
   INA reported the letter said Iraq is ready to cooperate with the
secretary-general in a ``constructive manner'' to break the
deadlock. Aziz accused Iran of neglecting its obligations under the
U.N. cease-fire resolution by insisting on a troop withdrawal.
   Iran claims Iraq still holds 390 square miles of its territory.
   Iraq refuses to withdraw without a guarantee of freedom of
navigation in the gulf.
   Airlines that suspended their flights because of the war have
begun to fly back to Iran and Iraq.
   Alitalia, the Italian airline, announced Monday it is resuming
separate weekly flights to Tehran and Baghdad this week.
   Tehran has been spruced up for the revolution's anniversary.
Buildings are draped in flags and sparkle at night with cascades of
colored lights in sharp contrast to celebrations during the war,
when blackouts were in effect to combat Iraqi missile strikes.

<TEXT>
   The author of a landmark law limiting trade
with the Soviet Union is proposing a relaxation of the curbs in
light of the Kremlin's agreement to allow more Jewish emigration,
according to a letter released Monday.
   The letter by Charles Vanik, a former congressman from Ohio who
co-sponsored the 1974 Jackson-Vanik Amendment, reflects a fledgling
movement among legislators and Jewish groups for a reassessment of
restrictions on trade with the Soviets.
   The Jan. 30 letter from Vanik, now in private law practice, was
written to Edgar Bronfman, president of the World Jewish Congress. A
copy was obtained from the organization.
   The group is one of several prominent Jewish organizations
advocating a re-examination of the 1974 amendment that imposes high
tariffs on imports from any Communist country denying its citizens
the right to emigrate.
   The amendment, which had been originated by the late senator
Henry Jackson, was designed to stop Soviet restrictions on Jews
seeking to emigrate and has served as leverage in the hands of
successive administrations in their dealings with Moscow.
   The amendment allows the president to recommend to Congress a
waiver of the restrictions for at least 18 months if the Soviets or
other Communist countries stop their emigration restrictions. Over
the years, Poland, Hungary and Romania have benefited from such
waivers.
   Critics of the amendment argue that whatever improvements have
occurred since then in Soviet emigration policy have been the result
of internal reforms in the Soviet Union or developments in
superpower arms control negotiations rather than the Jackson-Vanik
law.
   ``I disagree,'' Vanik said in an interview. ``I think the
amendment has done many people a great deal of good.''
   Seeking to take advantage of the economic openness to outsiders
instituted by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, U.S. business
leaders have in recent months launched a campaign to form joint
ventures that would give them a foothold in the largely untapped
Soviet market.
   Vanik and other experts agree that a waiver of the Jackson-Vanik
bill would not result in much immediate trade but would improve
overall relations and the climate for doing business. ``It's a way
of sending them a signal, saying we're encouraged by what you're
doing, keep it up,'' Vanik said.
   But the push for a waiver, which is written into the amendment,
would have to come from the Jewish community, which has been the
main proponent and beneficiary of the bill, Vanik said.
   The World Jewish Congress projects that at the current level of
emigration, some 38,000 Jews will be allowed to leave the Soviet
Union this year. This compares with the record 51,320 allowed out in
1979 and a record low of some 900 in 1986.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., who has a large Jewish constituency,
said in a recent speech that it was ``only a matter of time'' until
the waiver is enacted if the emigration levels maintain their
current pace.
   Organization officials say they will formally consider their
position regarding a waiver of the Jackson-Vanik law at a May 7
meeting in Montreal, Canada. But they indicate that if the Soviets
allow direct flights of emigrants from Moscow to Israel, ``that
would create the environment for immediate Jewish support of a
Jackson-Vanik waiver,'' said Executive Director Elan Steinberg.
   The Soviets, who broke off relations with Israel in 1967, have
refused to allow direct flights, sending the Jewish emigres to Rome
or Vienna. Israel has complained that this practice allows Jews to
proceed from Europe to the United States, Canada and other points
rather than going to the Jewish state.
   The new administration has yet to take a stand on the subject.
State Department spokesman Charles Redman reiterated the view of the
Reagan administration that ``this is the kind of thing, were it to
happen, would require a very strong consensus among the
administration, Congress and the American people.''

<HEAD>Government Bans Display of Weapons at Neo-Nazi Rallies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Monday
cracked down for the first time on the country's most powerful white
extremist group, banning the display of firearms at meetings of the
Afrikaner Resistance Movement.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok imposed the ban on the
neo-Nazi group under the same emergency regulations used to restrict
many anti-apartheid movements.
   Meetings of the resistance movement, known by its Afrikaans
initials as the AWB, were ``characterized by emotion-laden speeches
... in which remarks about the use of violence were uttered,'' Vlok
said.
   ``Often, statements are made at such gatherings which disrupt the
relationship between the different races and kindle a climate of
animosity and polarization,'' he said.
   The movement was founded in 1973 and does not disclose its
membership, but regularly draws thousands of whites to its rallies.
Many members wear swastika-like emblems on their khaki uniforms, and
the group's leader, Eugene TerreBlanche, often ends fiery speeches
with a Hitler-style salute.
   At a leadership meeting Jan. 21 in Pretoria, where TerreBlanche
loyalists repudiated a challenge to his leadership, the chief
instructor of the the group's paramilitary unit was on guard outside
the auditorium with an automatic rifle slung over his shoulder.
   Vlok's statement said dissension within the movement ``has
increased the possibility of violence.''
   The minister also said the government was considering broader
steps, including a ban on possession of weapons at all political and
cultural gatherings. At present, many whites and a handful of blacks
have permits which allow them to carry weapons virtually anywhere.
   The challenge to TerreBlanche's leadership began in December
after he was accused of having an extramarital relationship with
Jani Allan, a former model who writes a column for the nationally
circulated Sunday Times.
   TerreBlanche, who is married, has denied any improper
relationship with Ms. Allan.
   Four senior members of the movement demanded his resignation, and
one of them accused TerreBlanche of womanizing and excessive
drinking _ charges TerreBlanche denied.
   The government recently has been criticized for failing to take
tough action against extreme-right whites involved in a series of
racist incidents across the country.
   Last year, the government banned a small white-supremacist group
called the White Liberation Movement, and was accused of lacking the
courage to act against the more powerful movement.
   The group contends the government's limited political reforms
will lead to a takeover by the disenfranchised black majority.

   An attorney who recommended 15 other
women to serve on Harvard College's governing board said Monday she
doesn't know who offered the nomination that made her the first
female member in 352 years.
   ``I'm really in awe,'' Judith Richards Hope said in a telephone
interview from Los Angeles. ``It's such an august body, I really was
surprised.
   ``Nobody has told me why I was selected.''
   Mrs. Hope, 48, is a federal appellate judge nominee whose name
was mentioned last year as a possible successor to Attorney General
Edwin Meese. She also is the daughter-in-law of comedian Bob Hope
and the mother of a 19-year-old Harvard sophomore, Zachary Hope.
   Harvard's Board of Overseers on Sunday unanimously approved Mrs.
Hope's appointment to the Presidents and Fellows of Harvard. That
panel, whose members serve without pay for unlimited terms, makes
day-to-day decisions on educational, financial and institutional
policies.
   She said Harvard executives asked her nine months ago to propose
women, preferably lawyers, who might be considered for the vacancy
left by former Time Inc. Chairman Andrew Heiskell, who served for 10
years. She provided the names of about 15 distinguished women but
didn't include herself among them.
   ``I am particularly delighted to announce the election of a woman
to the corporation,'' said Harvard President Derek Bok. ``Our
10-month nationwide search brought to the attention of the board an
outstanding group of men and women. Of them all, Mrs. Hope appeared
to possess the special combination of training, experience and
personal attributes that we were seeking.''
   Mrs. Hope is an Ohio native who graduated from Wellesley College
in 1961 and from Harvard Law School in 1964. She is a partner in the
law firm Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &amp; Walker with offices in
Washington and Los Angeles.
   She was associate director of the White House Domestic Council
under President Gerald Ford, and vice chairman of the President's
Commission on Organized Crime during the Reagan administration. Last
year, she served as general counsel to the presidential campaign of
Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kan., and in 1984 she served as national
co-chairman of Lawyers for Reagan-Bush.

   President Bush, presiding at a swearing-in
ceremony for Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, on Monday
urged a stronger international effort to stop ``terrorism in the
skies.''
   Bush praised Skinner as ``a miracle worker of sorts'' for his
achievements as chairman of the Regional Transportation Authority of
Northeastern Illinois.
   And, he said the Chicago lawyer, who flies himself, would ``bring
a pilot's perspective'' to the job.
   ``We won't rest until every possible step has been taken to make
air travel in America as safe as it possibly can be,'' Bush said at
a ceremony in an auditorium at the Federal Aviation Administration.
   He said Skinner would head the U.S. delegation to a special
session of the Council of the International Civil Aviation
Organization next week in Montreal to deal with what Bush termed
``an area critical to safe skies.''
   ``He has my mandate to do all he can at that meeting to hasten
the day when the international community puts an end to terrorism in
the skies,'' Bush said.
   Skinner, in brief remarks, vowed to work to develop ``a
transportation system for the 21st Century.''
   In a separate swearing-in ceremony for U.S. Trade Representative
Carla Hills, Bush vowed that his administration would resist
protectionism, work forcefully to open more foreign markets to U.S.
goods and to bear in mind that ``our major trading partners are not
our enemies but our allies.''
   He said he agreed with Mrs. Hills' contention, made during her
Senate confirmation hearings, that trade issues should be approached
``with a crowbar and a handshake.''
   Bush jokingly waved a crowbar he presented to the trade official
at the ceremony in the Old Executive Office Building.

<TEXT>
   Talks that began Monday between Solidarity
and the government likely will produce results, some experts say,
because the once-bitter enemies now have no choice but to agree.
   For the first time since the Communist Party consolidated power
after World War II, a cross-section of the opposition has begun to
negotiate openly with authorities over how Poland should be
governed, how its political system should be reformed and how its
economy should be managed.
   ``I am proud that such an unprecedented event in socialist
countries is taking place in Poland,'' said Wanda Paluszewska, an
engineer standing outside the palace where the talks are being held.
``This may be really the last chance which may save Poland from
bloodshed.''
   The opposition is represented by Solidarity chief Lech Walesa,
scholars, writers and intellectuals. The pro-Solidarity delegation
numbers 25.
   There are 57 seats at the round table built specially for the
talks, and the rest are filled by representatives of the ruling
Communist Party, two Communist-allied groups, government officials,
members of the official OPZZ trade union alliance, intellectuals
linked to the party and three Roman Catholic Church officials.
   Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, who as interior minister is Poland's top
police officer, is the host.
   ``I am an optimist by nature. I believe that the debates ... will
be successful,'' he said before the talks began.
   Although authorities vowed after the 1981 martial-law crackdown
that Solidarity would never be allowed to operate legally again, the
talks are aimed at achieving just that.
   Officials, faced with a deteriorating economy and tired of the
political stalemate with Solidarity, decided in bitter debate at a
party meeting last month to make peace with the opposition.
   They said they hoped the decision would win them public support
as they seek further economic sacrifices from a weary populace. They
also anticipate a larger measure of sympathy from potential lenders
in the West.
   Poland desperately needs money for investments but Western loans,
even for small commercial transactions, virtually ceased after the
martial-law decree.
   As the price for legalizing Solidarity, authorities want the
opposition to back economic reforms and to participate in the
Communist-dominated government and parliament.
   It is this demand that causes the greatest uneasiness among
Solidarity veterans. Walesa has vowed not to accept any compromise
that would inhibit the union's independence.
   ``I think it is of historic significance,'' Michael Mandelbaum,
an expert on East-West relations with the Council on Foreign
Relations, said of the talks during an interview in New York last
week.
   Noting that the Cold War began when the communists seized power
in Poland after World War II, he said cooperation between the Polish
government and the opposition could help ease East-West tensions.
   Economic pressures make the move toward national agreement a
necessity, Mandelbaum said.
   ``If things go on, Poland would be a Third World country. This
awareness has forced political changes,'' he said.
   Charles Gati, an eastern European expert and professor at Union
College in New York, said Polish authorities seem ``ready to reverse
themselves and come to terms with Polish political realities, and it
is wonderful news.''
   ``Poland cannot be governed without Solidarity,'' he said. ``It
can be ruled, with some difficulty, without Solidarity.''
   But, Gati added, Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski ``has
learned that ruling by itself is simply not enough.''
   He cited several factors leading to the government's decision to
sit down with Solidarity: strong support in society for Solidarity,
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's commitment to reform, the
continued decline of the economy and the appointment of a new prime
minister, mieczyslaw f. Rakowski, in a government shakeup last fall.
   Gati said Rakowski is ``as shrewd at they come,'' and recognizes
the logic of talking with Solidarity.

   Angry relatives of Flight 103 victims accused the
federal government and Pan American World Airways on Monday of
negligence before the bombing that killed 270 people and of
insensitivity afterward.
   Thirty relatives, some with photographs of their lost loved ones
pinned to their clothes, chiefly demanded an accounting of why the
government had not made public a terrorist threat that such a flight
would be bombed.
   The group also demanded the resignation of Alan McArtor, chief of
the Federal Aviation Administration, saying he had failed to
maintain security, and asked that Congress investigate the
circumstances of the Pan Am attack.
   But in an outpouring of emotion and frustration, the relatives
voiced a litany of other complaints, ranging from their inability to
recover their loved ones' personal effects to the handling of the
victims' remains.
   Colleen Hermann, of Huntington, N.Y., described how her family
watched as 10 caskets, one containing her brother's body, were
unloaded by forklift from a plane in a livestock cargo area at John
F. Kennedy International Airport.
   ``There was no representative of Pan Am there. No one even spoke
English,'' she said tearfully at a news conference. ``And that is
how my brother came home.''
   The relatives, in a statement, complained of ``utter silence'' by
high government officials _ no condolence, no attendance at memorial
services, no answers to letters. They suggested officials were
seeking to conceal mishandling of the threat that preceded the
bombing.
   ``I am outraged that the most democratic country in the world, so
they claim, keeps information from people to choose when to die,''
said Marina De Larracoechea, whose sister was killed on the flight.
``A life for an airline ticket is an extremely high price to pay.''
   The government told airlines and embassies of a threat that
terrorists would bomb a U.S. flight from Frankfurt in December, but
it did not warn the public. Officials said they get such unconfirmed
threats on a daily basis and would cripple the airline industry by
announcing them publicly.
   The relatives called that policy ``immoral and possibly
criminal.'' While the FAA receives perhaps 500 threats annually,
fewer than 25 are considered ``high-level'' threats, as the
Frankfurt threat apparently was, they said.
   The relatives angrily suggested that the government had widely
advised federal employees not to take flights such as Pan Am 103,
noting that it had more than 150 empty seats at the height of the
busy Christmas season.
   The New York-bound flight, which originated in Frankfurt and
changed to a larger plane in London, exploded over Lockerbie,
Scotland, on Dec. 21. All 259 aboard died, as did 11 on the ground.
   Pamela Hanlon, a Pan Am spokeswoman, noted that the threat had
not identified a specific flight and that Pan Am had increased its
security after receiving the warning. She said the number of vacant
seats wasn't unusual.
   Ms. Hanlon said Pan Am had assigned each family an individual
company official to serve as its liaison. She said she had not known
of the specific complaint by Ms. Hermann on the handling of her
brother's remains.
   An FAA spokesman did not return two telephone messages. At the
State Department, spokeswoman Francis Jones said she wanted to see
the relatives' statement before commenting.

<HEAD>Mugabe Calls For Tougher Sanctions And Bigger U.N.-Namibia Force</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANGUS SHAW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Robert Mugabe on Monday called
for tougher economic sanctions on South Africa and urged the United
Nations to increase the strength of its peacekeeping force for
Namibia.
   The Zimbabwean leader told foreign ministers from the
eight-nation Commonwealth Committee on South Africa that the
international campaign for comprehensive and mandatory sanctions
aimed at ending Pretoria's legal system of racial separation must be
intensified.
   ``Friends, allies and sympathizers of Pretoria must be told
clearly that the Commonwealth will not allow this call to be
suppressed by anyone, until South Africa is ready to dismantle her
evil system,'' said Mugabe, who also is current chairman of the
101-nation Non-Aligned Movement.
   He was opening a three-day meeting of the Commonwealth committee
seeking ways to increase external pressure on South Africa's
government and bolster black-governed neighbors threatened by South
African destabilization.
   Several of South Africa's neighbors are members of the 48-member
Commonwealth, a loose association of Britain and its former
colonies. Britain is not a member of the committee because Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher opposes sanctions.
   Mugabe applauded the U.S.-brokered peace plan plotting
independence for Namibia, also known as South-West Africa, after
U.N.-sponsored elections in November.
   But he said African nations remain ``deeply suspicious'' of South
Africa's part in the agreement, which Angola and Cuba also signed,
and fear attempts to weaken the U.N. role in the territory Pretoria
has administered since World War 1.
   ``South Africa must never be allowed to manipulate the election
processes directly or indirectly in her favor. All loopholes must
therefore be closed to her,'' he said.
   ``Any optimism this agreement may have generated must be tempered
by anxiety about potential hurdles and land mines,'' Mugabe said.
   The Zimbabwean is an outspoken critic of suggestions favored by
the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council to reduce
the Namibia peacekeeping force from 7,500 to 4,650 men to save costs.
   Britain, China, France, the Soviet Union and the United States
pay 58 percent of all peacekeeping costs.
   Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal told the session
that reducing the force will save the five about $160 million.
   This was the cost of about seven fighter aircraft or two hours of
the collective military spending of the five major powers, Ramphal
said.
   He described the proposed cuts as an emasculation of the U.N.'s
role in Nambia.
   Joe Clark, Canada's external affairs minister and chairman of the
Commonwealth group, said the meeting will review ways to strengthen
the international arms embargo against Pretoria, measures against
South Africa in world money markets and the effects of sanctions on
African nations dependent on South Africa for trade and transport
links.
   Other members of the committee are Australia, Guyana, India,
Nigeria, Tanzania and Zambia.

<HEAD>Housing Association Urges Tax Increase to Ease Housing Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Association of Housing and
Redevelopment Officials urged President Bush on Monday to support a
tax increase as a way to correct what it said is a crisis in housing.
   ``It is now time to recognize the severity of the fiscal deficit
and its pervasive impact on all aspects of the quality of life in
our communities,'' said Helen L. Sause of San Francisco, president
of the association.
   ``The only way to address it is to increase revenues,'' she said
at a news conference. ``Unless this action is taken, no one will
seriously address the need to adequately fund domestic programs.''
   The association, which is holding its annual winter meeting in
Washington, represents more than 2,700 local housing and community
development agencies across the country.
   She cited a 70 percent reduction in federal funding for housing
since 1980, the loss of the $4 billion general revenue sharing
program to local governments, and the loss of tax incentives for
building low-income housing as a result of the 1986 tax law changes,
as ``devastating'' the supply of housing.
   She said the increasing numbers of homeless families and
households living in substandard housing are evidence of a crisis in
housing.
   In calling for higher taxes, the association declined to suggest
a specific proposal for raising taxes or to say how much money
should be raised through higher taxes.

<HEAD>Israel Asks United States To Stop PLO Dialogue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel formally asked the United States on
Monday to stop its dialogue with the Palestine Liberation
Organization in view of an attempt by Palestinian guerrillas to
infiltrate the northern Israeli border, sources said.
   The request was submitted by an Israeli diplomat to the State
Department's Bureau of Near East Affairs, which handles the Middle
East, said the sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   In Israel, Defense Minister Moshe Arens accused the PLO of
violating its December pledge to renounce all acts of terrorism.
   In a speech to the Conference of Presidents of Major American
Jewish Organizations, Arens cited a clash Saturday in which Israeli
troops killed five Palestinians on the northern border of Israel's
self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon.
   The radical PLO factions of George Habash's Marxist Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine and the Syrian-backed Palestinian
Liberation Front took responsibility for trying to attack Israeli
positions.
   Last December, the United States overturned a 13-year ban on
talks with the PLO after the organization's chief, Yasser Arafat,
promised to stop all acts of terrorism and declared that his
organization recognizes Israel.
   The U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, Robert Pelletreau. met with PLO
officials Dec. 14 and twice more since then, the State Department
said.
   Department spokesman Charles Redman, said ``we're looking into''
whether Saturday's attack violates Arafat's non-violence pledge.
Other officials said the United States was seeking additional
information about the clash.
   The complaint came as Israel's military chief of staff, Lt. Gen.
Dan Shomron, began a visit to Washington as the guest of the Defense
Department. Shomron has been quoted as telling the Israeli
government in closed-door session that the PLO has kept its promise
and refrained from attacking Israelis in south Lebanon or along the
border.
   But other officials contend that while Arafat's mainstream Fatah
group may be adhering to the non-violence pledge, other, more
militant factions within the PLO are escaping Arafat's control.
   Shomron is scheduled to meet with Pentagon officials and to tour
Army, Navy and Air Force installations.

   A survey of catfish farmers shows that 1988
sales totaled $284.8 million, up 17 percent from 1987, the
Agriculture Department said Monday.
   More than 1,900 catfish farmers in 17 states were surveyed. The
sales included about $265 million from production units and $20
million from hatchery operations.
   As of Jan. 1, catfish hatchery inventories included 1.35 million
broodfish, 85 million stockers and 365 million fingerlings, the
report said. Production units had 3.77 million large fish weighing
more than three pounds each; 147 million food-size, three-quarters
of a pound to three pounds; 261 million stockers and 516 million
fingerlings.
   Here are total sales by states, with 1987 in the first column and
1988 in the second, in thousands of dollars. Georgia and Idaho are
included as ``other'' states but not broken down individually.

<HEAD>Black Leaders Say Miami Divisions Stall Progress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lack of unity in Miami's black leadership must be
overcome before real progress can be made in the Overtown and
Liberty City neighborhoods that erupted into violence last month,
community leaders say.
   ``Black leadership in Miami is a myth,'' said Garth Reeves, 69,
publisher of the Miami Times, a newspaper that serves the black
community. ``We don't have any organized leadership. A lot of people
have their own agendas, but it's fractured.''
   As a result, he said, ``we're powerless.''
   John Due, director of Metro-Dade's Community Relations Board,
said he doesn't know what people are talking about when they refer
to the ``black community.''
   ``I call it the non-community,'' he said.
   But unlike Reeves, Due said he thinks he knows why there is a
leadership vacuum. ``We're all migrants,'' he said. ``We're all from
somewhere else. We have no shared childhoods to develop trust and
loyalty and extended families.''
   He noted that after the 1980 and 1982 riots, white leaders called
in prominent national black leaders such as Andrew Young and Jesse
Jackson to help deal with the situation.
   But he said blacks must now organize at all levels.
   ``We've got to have the street leaders there too,'' he said.
``You know, the king of the pool hall.''
   The fractured nature of Miami's black leadership was evident a
week after the riots, when Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., came to
Overtown to hear from local residents. Ray Fauntroy, president of
the Miami chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,
the sponsor of the event, wanted to bar the media from the meeting.
   But City Commissioner Miller Dawkins and some other black leaders
were opposed and threatened to walk out if the media ban were
enacted. After some heated discussion, then reporters and cameras
were allowed to stay.
   Just an hour earlier, a new black organization, People United for
Justice, held its own event _ a ``rally for justice'' at the
Metro-Dade Justice building. Only about a dozen participants showed
up but organizer Billy Hardeman shrugged it off.
   ``That's not important,'' he said. ``It's the message, not the
numbers, that are important. Eventually, the numbers will come.''
   Bill Perry, president of the Overtown Advisory Board, a
long-standing committee of Overtown leaders, agreed that black
leadership is ``unfocused'' and said it amounts to a real problem.
   Yet he said he resents the new faces that have emerged since the
recent riots. ``It's annoying. There are a lot of egos and prima
donnas,'' Perry said.
   The Rev. Willie Sims, pastor of the New Mount Zion Baptist Church
in Liberty City, said he welcomes new blood ``as long as it is not
from out of town.''
   Sims was especially critical of the visit by a controversial New
York City black activist, the Rev. Al Sharpton, during the week of
the riots. ``We don't need any publicity seekers,'' he said.
   Sims suggested that Miami's black leadership problem may stem
from the fact that the city's black communities are so spread out
geographically.
   ``It would be impossible for any one individual to lay claim to
the entire black community,'' he said.
   But not all prominent Miami blacks will admit that there is a
leadership problem.
   ``We've got black leaders who are doing it every day, Miller
Dawkins, (Dade County Commissioner) Barbara Carey, the Urban
League,'' said T. Willard Fair, president of the Urban League of
Greater Miami. ``We were all here before the riots and we'll all be
here after the riots. We'll ignore the Johnny-come-latelys.''

   The premiere installment of CBS's critically

``The Sex Tapes.''
   The first night of the four-night, eight-hour miniseries scored a

Sex Tapes'' had a 17.0 rating and 25 share. ABC offered the hit
theatrical film starring Bette Midler, ``Ruthless People,'' and got
a 14.2 and 21.
   The rating is a percentage of total homes with television in the

   ``Lonesome Dove,'' starring Robert Duvall, Tommy Lee Jones and
Anjelica Huston and based on the 1985 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel
by Larry McMurtry, airs through Wednesday.

   Conservation planning to protect highly
erodible land from erosion has edged close to the two-thirds mark,
give or take a few percentage points, the Agriculture Department
said Monday.
   As of Jan. 1, according to the department's Soil Conservation
Service, plans were completed for 89.2 million acres, or slightly
less than 63 percent of the estimated 141.7 million acres.
   SCS chief Wilson Scaling said in his agency's statement, however,
``We met our goal of having conservation plans on 65 percent of
highly erodible land by Jan. 1.''
   Asked about the discrepancy between Scaling's claim and the Jan.
1 figures provided by the agency, officials said the 141.7 million
acres were an estimate that is expected to be adjusted to about 136
million acres at some point.
   Thus, said spokeswoman Leslie Wilder, the goal for having 65
percent of the plans done by Jan. 1 had been met.
   To remain eligible for USDA programs, including crop price
supports and other benefits, farmers who operate highly erodible
cropland must have a conservation plan approved by Dec. 31, 1989.
   As of Jan. 1, conservation plans have been implemented on 25.2
million acres, or 18 percent of the land.

   People gazed through iron fences at a
former palace on Monday, some with rosaries in their hands, hoping
for signs that the government and opposition leaders inside were
reaching agreement on the nation's future.
   ``People are standing around with tears in their eyes because
they know the fate of Poland is being decided,'' a middle-aged woman
said. ``We are all experiencing it. We are praying.''
   Hundreds were outside when the 57 delegates of the government,
Roman Catholic church and political opposition arrived at midday for
negotiations that could bring political and economic reforms and
restore legal status to the independent trade union Solidarity.
   A few people lingered in the darkening chill of late afternoon,
staring at the glow of light from the two-story meeting hall in the
17th century palace, which once belonged to the Radziwill family.
   An occasional worker stopped briefly on the way home. There were
some journalists, policemen, teen-agers muffling giggles.
   ``It is a positive event In the history of Poland ... that both
sides are beginning to be aware of the consequences ... if they
don't come to an agreement,'' said Piotr Rolkiewicz, a 56-year-old
scientist.
   Wanda Paluszewska, an electronics engineer, added: ``This is
really the last chance to save Poland from bloodshed.''
   After the first day, conferees said talks would resume Wednesday
with working groups addressing economic, social, labor and political
problems that led the communist authorities to propose the
negotiations.
   State television showed ranking government officials shaking
hands with such opposition leaders as Lech Walesa, the shipyard
electrician who founded Solidarity in 1980 and won the Nobel Peace
Prize three years later.
   ``I think Walesa is the man who enjoys authentic authority among
people and his talks will finally give some positive results,''
Rolkiewicz said. ``Society is waiting. The point is not to take
revenge, but to repair this People's Republic of ours.''

<HEAD>Fruit Farmer Suggests Making Home For Retarded Man</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A fruit farmer has offered to take in a
retarded man who has spent 32 years in a state mental hospital after
being mistakenly ruled insane, a judge said Monday.
   The judge had planned to announce the fate of the man, Bernt
Murphy, 51, at a hearing Monday, but put off his decision to
consider the new offer. The Utah Supreme Court ordered Murphy freed,
ruling he was wrongly judged insane in 1957 after first confessing
to a murder and then recanting.
   A committee appointed by Third District Judge Pat B. Brian
already had made recommendations on Murphy's future. Brian said he
wants the committe to study the new offer, and he will decide Feb.
22 where Murphy should live.
   The farmer, Reid Wayman, 61, a retired school teacher, said he
has employed five mentally retarded men over the past 24 years, one
of which remains at the farm, living in a mobile home.
   ``I was looking around for someone to keep this boy company,''
Wayman said, referring to the handicapped man who lives and works on
his farm. He said he did not consider Murphy dangerous.
   ``I gather from what I've read and what I've been told that it's
past history. The incident was one that was not intentional,'' he
said.
   The Utah Supreme Court ruled last June that Murphy should be
freed from the Utah State Hospital in Provo, where he was sent
following the 1957 rape and beating of a 5-year-old girl.
   During questioning about that crime, Murphy, then 19, admitted to
the 1955 murder of a 23-year-old mentally retarded woman he had
known at the Utah State Training School for the mentally retarded in
American Fork.
   Murphy later denied killing the woman. He was found incompetent
to stand trial and the murder was never solved.
   His attorney, Brooke Wells, has said Murphy has the mental
capacity of an 8-year-old and should fare well in a group home with
other retarded adults. But state officials have said Murphy still is
capable of violent behavior.
   ``He has not been a model client,'' said John Lesnan, program
specialist in the state Division of Mental Health. ``It has been an
ongoing series of events, not sporadic, that have convinced us he
could be dangerous.
   ``His episodes have ranged from minor, like making threats, to
very serious, like physical aggression that requires several people
to restrain him,'' Lesnan said.
   When questioned after the hearing Monday about whether he wanted
to leave the Provo institution, Murphy replied, ``Yes, I do, real
bad. I've got friends inside and outside.
   ``Right now I'm starting to hate it more worser,'' he said,
adding he would be happy living on a ranch because he grew up
ranching and farming.
   George Brinkerhoff, Murphy's treatment coordinator at the mental
hospital, said that if conditions were right at Wayman's ranch
perhaps that would be the best choice.
   Social Services officials have said there are three other
choices. They include placing Murphy in a house or apartment under
24-hour supervision; a small group home with other retarded adults,
and a semi-independent apartment setting with staff members housed
on either side of those living quarters.

   However, the balance would be paid from on-budget outlays of
general revenues.
   Hopefully, some of these revenues will be recovered in the future
through sale of assets and recovery of funds from the wrongdoers.
   Fourth, we plan to increase the budget of the Justice Department
by approximately $50 million to enable it to create a nationwide
program to seek out and punish those that have committed wrongdoing
in the management of these failed institutions.
   These funds will result in almost doubling the personnel devoted
to the apprehension and prosecution of individuals committing fraud
in our financial markets.
   As you can see, these proposals are based upon several overriding
principles.
   First, I will not support any new fee on depositors.
   Second, we should preserve the overall federal budget structure
and not allow the misdeeds and the wrongdoings of savings and loan
executives and the inadequacy of their regulation to significantly
alter our overall budget priorities.
   And third, I have concluded that this proposal, if promptly
enacted, will enable our system to prevent any repetition of this
situation.
   And fourth, I've decided to attack this problem head-on, with
every available resource of our government, because it is a national
problem.
   I've directed that the combined resources of our federal agencies
be brought together in a team effort to resolve the problem.
   And fifth, I believe that banks and thrifts should pay the real
cost of providing the deposit insurance protection.
   The price the FDIC charges banks for their insurance has not been
increased since 1935.
   We propose to increase the bank insurance premium by less than 7
cents per $100 of insurance protection that they receive.
   Every penny collected would be used to strengthen the FDIC so
that the taxpayers will not be called on to rescue it a few years
from now.
   And I make you a solemn pledge that we will make every effort to
recover assets diverted from these institutions and to place behind
bars those who have caused losses through criminal behavior.
   Let those who would take advantage of the public trust and put at
risk the savings of American families anticipate that we will seek
them out, pursue them, and demand the most severe penalty.
   In closing, I want to just say a word to the small savers of
America.
   Across this great land, families and individuals work and save,
and we hope to encourage even greater rates of savings to promote a
brighter future for our children.
   Your government has stood behind the safety of insured deposits
before.
   It does today, and it will do so at all times in the future.
   Every insured deposit will be backed by the full faith and credit
of the United States of America, which means it will be _ that it
will be absolutely protected.
   For the future, we will seek to achieve a safe, sound and
profitable banking system.
   However, integrity and prudence must share an equal position with
competition in our financial markets.
   Clean markets are an absolute prerequisite to a free economy and
to the public confidence that is its most important ingredient.
   I've determined to face this problem squarely and to ask for your
support in putting it behind us.
   I have ordered that the resources of the executive branch be
brought to bear on cleaning up this problem.
   I have personally met with the leadership of Congress on this
issue.
   My administration will work cooperatively with Congress as the
legislation that we will submit in a few days' time is considered.
   I call on the Congress to join me in a determined effort to
resolve this threat to the American financial system permanently,
and to do so without delay.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Andres Rodriguez, who seized power
in a violent coup last week, denied links with the drug traffic and
announced Monday that elections will be held May 1, with only
communists excluded.
   Four cronies of ousted President Alfredo Stroessner, who ruled
Paraguay for nearly 35 years until the coup, were accused of using
public funds and graft to obtain ``luxurious mansions, expensive
apartments abroad and sumptuous automobiles.''
   Reporters asked the general about casualties during eight hours
of fighting Thursday night and early Friday that ousted Stroessner.
   ``Believe me, total casualties _ dead plus wounded _ do not
exceed 50,'' Rodriguez replied. Earlier estimates by embassies and
civilian witnesses put the number of dead alone at nearly 300, but
no official figures have been released.
   Rodriguez also said Congress has been dissolved and that the new
president would take office immediately upon election. Some
opposition leaders said they didn't have enough time to prepare for
the election.
   Stroessner was given asylum in neighboring Brazil and was staying
in Itumbiara, a remote city 270 miles southeast of Brasilia. He is
living in a house owned by the government power company, which
operates a dam on the nearby Paranaiba River.
   At the first presidential news conference Paraguayans could
remember, Rodriguez said rumors of his involvement with the drug
trade ``were spread by people trying to defame me.
   ``I detest drugs,'' he told reporters let into his office in
small groups. ``I swear as a Catholic and as a family man; I swear
on my children, I have no connections with drugs.''
   Paraguay has become a way station for cocaine produced in
neighboring Bolivia. Foreign diplomats, academics and media reports
have linked Rodriguez with traffickers, but no proof has been
presented and no charges have been filed.
   Asked whether he would cooperate with the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration, he said Paraguay ``will cooperate with all foreign
governments and agencies, including the United States, and the more
help we get the better. We will fight together.''
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
U.S. relations with Paraguay will depend on the actions of the
government on creating democracy, respecting human rights and
suppressing narcotics trafficking and cultivation. ``We will be
watching closely the extent to which the provisional government
allows opposition parties to campaign and the media to broadcast the
positions of the candidates and their parties,'' he said.
   Rodriguez, a 65-year-old cavalry general, said Stroessner ``was
not a dictator.''
   ``If the Colorado Party elected him for so many years, it must
have been because of confidence in him,'' he said. After seizing
power in 1954, Stroessner held elections every five years and won by
landslides.
   ``Stroessner's legal situation is being studied by the court
system,'' Rodriguez added. ``He could come back in two or three
years. He has gone for a rest in Brazil.''
   Asked what prompted the coup, Rodriguez said: ``In recent times
he was not producing good results for his party, which had trusted
him.''
   Rodriguez did not explain the remark, but he appeared to be
speaking of an internal struggle between Stroessner supporters and
``traditionalists'' who wanted to draw a distinction between the
101-year-old party and the dictator.
   Rodriguez also said several Stroessner henchmen ``are under
arrest and their cases will be brought before civil or military
courts.''
   A lawyer, Pedro Abilio Rolon, filed a citizen's suit in Supreme
Court on Monday against the former ministers of the interior,
justice and public health and Stroessner's private secretary, Mario
Abdo Benitez.
   He accused them of misusing public funds and accepting bribes.
   Thirty-five former government and Colorado Party officials were
arrested after the coup.
   The ruling Colorado Party said it would hold a convention soon to
choose new leaders and candidates for the general elections.
   The setting of an election date so quickly caught opposition
leaders off guard. Several said they didn't think they could
organize in time, and early elections gave a tremendous edge to the
Colorado Party.
   ``This date was arrived at without consultation,'' said Domingo
Laino, leader of what is thought to be Paraguay's biggest opposition
group, the Authentic Radical Liberal Party. ``I personally can't
even be a candidate for anything because I'm not registered.
   ``In the past, we've called for electoral abstention,'' he said.
``Our people are not registered on the voter lists. It seems to us
that this (early election) could be interpreted as a trap.''
   Rodriguez said all parties ``except those that are communist''
would be allowed to enter candidates. ``Our constitution doesn't
consider the Communist Party to be democratic,'' he said.
   Several Colorado Party leaders have indicated its candidate for
president might be Luis Maria Argana, the foreign minister in the
provisional government Rodriguez appointed.
   When asked whether he might be a candidate himself, Rodriguez
smiled and said: ``The Colorado Party, not I, selects the candidate.
I am simply a soldier, not a politician. However, if I can be useful
to my country, I will do what I am asked.''

   Discovery's astronauts ran through
emergency drills at the launch pad Monday, and their commander said
he was confident engine pump problems would be resolved in time for
a mid-March launch.
   Pad safety personnel briefed Commander Michael Coats and his four
crewmates on escape routes and other procedures in case there is a
fire or other problem on the pad during the countdown.
   Included was a demonstration of a basket filled with ballast
zipping down a 1,200-foot ``slide for life'' wire that runs from the
spacecraft cabin level 195 feet above the ground. This is the
quickest escape measure, and, at the bottom, the astronauts have a
choice of entering a concrete underground bunker or driving away in
a tank-like vehicle.
   At the base of the launch pad, technicians were removing the
turbopumps from Discovery's three main engines. They will be
replaced by three new pumps because of two tiny cracks discovered in
a pump bearing shaft following the December flight of the shuttle
Atlantis.
   The decision to replace Discovery's pumps has delayed the launch
from Feb. 23 until March 10 at the earliest.
   Officials said last week that if Discovery does not get off the
only available shuttle launch pad by March 18, the mission might
have to be delayed until later in the year.
   That's because the following shuttle mission, that of Atlantis,
has only a 30-day period starting April 28 during which its crew can
dispatch the Magellan spacecraft to probe the planet Venus.
   NASA wants to preserve that entire launch window if possible,
because Venus will not come into position as a target again until
1991.
   Coats told reporters after Monday's escape drills that he is
confident about a mid-March launch.
   ``We were discouraged about a week ago, because the first
analysis indicated it might take too long a time to get the new
pumps and that there would be no way we could launch in March,'' he
said. ``Now everybody we've talked is very optimistic. We're
confident they've got a good fix on it now.''
   Arnold Aldrich, the ageny's national space transportation system
director, said in Washington on Monday he is confident of launching
Discovery without affecting the Atlantis launch.
   ``We believe this work has proceeded well since we started to
build up the new pumps and, barring any hiccup, we believe we can
well support an adequate launch window to launch STS-29 (Discovery)
and still give full coverage to the window for Magellan,'' he said.
   Aldrich said if Discovery is close to launching but can't make it
by March 18, officials would consider launching Atlantis later in
its window.
   He said NASA is aiming currently to launch Discovery by March 14,
and that a firm date will be set March 3 following a two-day launch
readiness review.
   On Tuesday, astronaut Coats and his crew will don their bulky
spacesuits and climb aboard Discovery for the final two hours of a
countdown rehearsal.

   After five days of interviewing prospective
jurors, the judge in Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial said Monday
that he expects the selection process to end Tuesday with a jury
being impaneled.
   ``I expect to be able to put a jury into the box tomorrow,'' said
U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell after declaring six more
people to be qualified to sit on the jury.
   The number deemed qualified by Gesell stood at 29 women and 9 men
_ all black, except for one white woman.
   Gesell also ordered that the jury will not be sequestered _ kept
apart from family and normal life to avoid contact with news reports
about the trial, expected to last up to five months.
   The minimum needed for the panel was 40, under this arithmetic:
There will be 12 jurors and six alternates. The defense will be able
to reject 10 members of the panel without stating a cause; the
prosecutors 6. In addition, each side can have three alternates
excused.
   Gesell is aiming for a pool of more than 40, a number that allows
for any last-minute dropouts for reasons of illness or financial
hardship. The normal challenges to jurors for ``cause'' have been
taken care of in the course of individual questioning that began
last Tuesday.
   Gesell said originally he wanted the panel to have 50 members,
but he reduced that number to 45 last week and said at the end of
the court day Monday he wanted at least 44. More prospective jurors
will be questioned Tuesday from a pool of 40 to be brought in.
   North's lawyers had asked that the jurors be sequestered. In his
written order, Gesell did not state a reason for turning them down,
saying only that ``the court does not presently intend to sequester
the jury.''
   North is accused of 12 crimes carrying a maximum of 60 years in
prison.
   After the court day, Gesell held a closed-door session to hear
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh. Gesell said only that it was
``concerning his classified document problems.''
   The National Security Agency strongly objected last month to
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh about classified information to be
presented in the case and said it warranted blocking the trial.
Thornburgh rejected the NSA's suggestion.
   Only those prospective jurors who say they heard, read or saw
none of North's extensive televised Iran-Contra testimony before
Congress in 1987 are being admitted into the jury pool. So far
North's defense has voted against nearly all those chosen on one
ground or other.
   ``I understand your position _ everybody is disqualified,''
Gesell told North lawyer Barry Simon on Monday.
   Under the rules of the court, the defense later will be allowed
to remove 10 people from the pool and the prosecution 6 without
stating a reason. Each side also gets three each of such peremptory
challenges when it comes to choosing the alternates. The jury will
be composed of 12 jurors and 6 alternates.
   One woman accepted for the jury pool is an office clerk who said
she recalled seeing a July 1987 magazine with North's picture on the
cover, but didn't recognize North in the courtroom and when asked
whether she had heard of him said, ``No, I never have.''
   Five prospective jurors were excused in rapid order Monday
morning, one because her boyfriend was on the grand jury that
indicted North.
   Another who was excused told the judge that what she can recall
from the hearings is only vague. She said she had the television on
``but I was listening and not listening.'' Her dismissal came when
she said she head heard on television that there had been shredding
of documents and lying to Congress.
   The charges against North include lying to Congress in 1985 and
1986 about his efforts on behalf of the Nicaraguan Contras and lying
to the attorney general about the National Security Council's role
in diverting money from the Iran arms sales to the Contras.

   Kitty Dukakis, the wife of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis,
is being treated for alcohol problems triggered by her husband's
loss to George Bush in the 1988 presidential election, the governor
said Monday.
   Mrs. Dukakis was not known to be dependent on alcohol until the
governor's statement, but she has had a history of addiction to diet
pills. She entered a Minnesota treatment center in 1982, where she
said she conquered her dependency.
   ``Until shortly after Election Day on Nov. 8, Kitty had never had
a problem with alcohol,'' Dukakis said in a statement.
   He said that since the presidential campaign Mrs. Dukakis, 52,
used alcohol ``in excessive quantities ... on a limited number of
occasions while at home.''
   ``As she has now discovered, whether it comes in a bottle or is
solid, if you are chemically dependent, you are chemically
dependent,'' Dukakis said at a news conference.
   Dukakis, who does not smoke and rarely drinks even a glass of
wine, said his wife had entered the Edgehill Newport facility in
Newport, R.I., on Sunday and will stay there about a month.
   ``She recognizes it. It was her decision to go into treatment,''
Dukakis said, adding that he and their children supported her choice.
   ``It is a disease from which you never recover; you're always
recovering,'' he said, calling her alcohol problem another
manifestation of her underlying chemical dependency.
   Mrs. Dukakis said in July 1987, early in her husband's
presidential campaign, that she had recovered five years earlier
from a 26-year addiction to mild amphetamines she began taking as a
teen-ager to control her weight.
   She won praise for her candor and became an active campaigner,
often appearing as a surrogate for Dukakis.
   The couple was at home in suburban Brookline during the weekend,
and there was no specific incident or accident that prompted the
decision to seek treatment, according to Dukakis spokesman James
Dorsey.
   Mrs. Dukakis' problem was caused by ``a combination of physical
exhaustion, the stress of the campaign effort and the post-election
letdown,'' the governor said.
   ``We know how loved and respected she is both here in the
commonwealth and across the nation _ and she is grateful for the
love and support she has received from so many good and decent
people,'' Dukakis said.
   Dorsey said the problem _ which he refused to characterize as
alcoholism _ flared up in the three months since the election and
did not involve a renewed use of drugs other than alcohol.
   Mrs. Dukakis has been prominent in the fight to educate
youngsters against the perils of drug and alcohol abuse.
   Since the presidential defeat, Mrs. Dukakis has launched a career
as an author and lecturer and has not appeared at her husband's side
on several occasions when she might have been expected.
   On Jan. 3, for example, when Dukakis made the surprise
announcement that he would not seek a fourth term as governor, some
observers remarked on the fact that Mrs. Dukakis was not present.
Dukakis left open the possibility that he would run for the White
House again in 1992.
   In 1983, Mrs. Dukakis took the lead in the state's ``Great
American Smokeout'' and announced that she was quitting cigarettes
after smoking since age 14. But she quickly became a chronic quitter.
   Dukakis said that when his wife gets out of Edgehill, ``I expect
that she will resume a very active and busy schedule.''

   The government's top delegate to historic
talks with the opposition opened the first session Monday by
offering to legalize Solidarity if the union agrees to economic and
political reforms.
   Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, seated opposite
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, called for the opposition to
participate in Poland's government.
   Fifty-seven delegates from the government, the opposition and the
Roman Catholic Church gathered for the talks at the ornate Council
of Ministers Palace, the building where the Warsaw Pact was created.
   The delegates met for about three hours and issued a short
communique that said talks by three ``working groups'' would resume
Wednesday. One group will consider economic and social policies,
another political reforms and the third the issue of allowing more
than one union to exist.
   ``We were brought together here by the sense of responsibility
for the future of our motherland. We are all responsible for the
Poland to be,'' Kiszczak told the participants, the state-run news
agency PAP reported.
   ``We must accept the philosophy of necessity alongside that of
the gradual character of transformations,'' he said. ``As it goes
for trade union pluralism, there is no question if, but the point is
how.''
   ``We demand Solidarity. We have the right to it,'' Walesa said in
his speech, PAP reported.
   Walesa blamed Poland's economic and political crisis on a lack of
freedoms, but said he sensed the government was ready for change,
state-run TV reported.
   ``We know the country is in ruins. But it has not been ruined by
gnomes, but by the system of carrying out power which has been
depriving people of their rights and wasting the fruits of their
labor,'' Walesa said.
   ``The time of social and political monopoly is ending. We need a
restructuring that will turn the one-party state into a state of the
nation and the society,'' he said.
   Known as the round table, the talks are the first between
Solidarity and the government since the union was suppressed by the
martial-law crackdown in December 1981.
   ``If we work out at the round table ... a confirmed consensus on
the idea of non-confrontational elections as well as support for
planned political and economic reforms, there will be an immediate
possibility'' to allow more than one trade union to exist at a given
factory, Kiszczak said.
   Kiszczak called for changes in electoral laws and a new
parliament that would ``represent a coalition of forces.''
   Solidarity has expressed willingness to see the opposition enter
parliament. But it is reluctant to endorse opposition participation
in a Cabinet that, despite reform, is likely to be dominated by the
Communist Party.
   Kiszczak, a member of the ruling Politburo, said if Solidarity
were legalized, it ``cannot return to old ruts, becoming the source
of anarchy and tensions.''
   Walesa ``accepted all of Kiszczak's suggestions in the name of
the side he represents,'' Polish TV reported.
   ``We are saying words, but Poland needs facts, new, brave
actions. ... All Poles will take account of our every word and every
decision and also, and maybe first of all, our lack of decisions,''
Walesa was quoted as saying.
   ``The biggest problem we have to fight now is the catastrophe of
the Polish economy,'' he said.
   Both sides agree that compromise is essential if Poland is to
overcome its huge $38.9 billion debt and chronic consumer shortages.
   The talks were given heavy TV coverage throughout the night and
the Communist Party daily Trybuna Ludu came out with an extra
evening edition.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban told reporters that authorities
were satisfied with the session.
   The speeches ``showed a rather convergent way of thinking about
the future and about the changes necessary in Poland,'' Urban said.
   Kiszczak proposed the talks in August 1988 during the country's
worst wave of strikes in seven years, but Walesa refused to commit
Solidarity until the authorities agreed to legalize the union.
   In a dramatic reversal of its seven-year stand against
Solidarity, the Communist Party Central Committee on Jan. 18
approved such a plan. Four days later, the union said it was willing
to talk.
   The participants represent the major political and social forces
in the country and include the official trade union OPZZ, the
Peasants' Party and the Roman Catholic Church.
   Hundreds of cheering Solidarity supporters waved at the union
delegation outside the palace.
   Polish TV carried a live broadcast of the delegates taking their
seats. Walesa led the Solidarity delegation into the palace, and
grinned after he took his seat at the pine table specially built for
the talks.
   Opposition activists expect the talks to continue for about six
weeks.

   I welcome the leaders that are with me here on this platform.
   I think their support says a lot about the efficacy of our
proposal.
   And now I propose to take just a few questions.
   On the technical aspects, I will defer to these people and then
I'll be glad to turn this over to Secretary Brady.
   I believe we start with Helen and then Terry and then get going.
   Q. Mr. President, are you guaranteeing that the extra costs,
premium increases and so forth, will not be passed on to the
depositors, taxpayers? And also, what is your responsibility in this
debacle? I mean the Reagan-Bush deal for deregulation of business
and banking?
   A. On the first place, we're not guaranteeing that.
   I would hope that wouldn't happen, but there's no guarantee what
the institutions will do.
   Secondly, there's enough to be said for everybody in this
together trying to solve this problem.
   So I can't equate any personal _ I'm not inclined to go into any
personal blame, simply to say that we've got to solve this problem
and we're on the path to doing that.
   Yeah, Terry.
   Q. Mr. President, the House votes tomorrow on that controversial
pay raise plan. And the Senate has already voted against it. Would
you sign a bill that vetoes the pay raise, not only for the members
of Congress, but also for federal judges and other high officials in
the government?
   A. I said I support it.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, there is a feeling that part of this problem is
attributable to deregulation of the financial industry. In
retrospect, do you think that deregulation might have gone too far
in the last 10 years or so? And, in the future, is your marching
order to your administration to be a little more careful in
regulating this particular industry?
   A. Jerry, I don't know the answer.
   I'd be most interested to know what our experts here feel about
whether _ how much of the problem could be attributed to
deregulation.
   I just don't know the answer to your question.
   So, I can't reply.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, you have placed considerable stress in these
early days of your presidency on ethics and propriety, yet in recent
days there's this controversy on Capitol Hill concerning the
propriety of Senator Tower's alleged behavior, and questions raised
over the weekend about the financial arrangements on the private
funds of the man in charge of ethis, your counsel Boyden Gray, and
other questions involving members of the administration, or
members-to-be of the administration. And I wonder sir, what's
happened here? Is it too harsh behavior on our part, too lax
behavior on your part? What?
   A. I don't think anything has happened.
   I learned long ago in public life not to make judgments based on
allegations.
   But having said that, I want to have my administration aspire to
the highest possible ethical standards.
   And we have appointed a commission to go out there now and try to
detail what these standards should be.
   And we are in a new era on these matters; matters that might have
been approved and looked at one way may have a different perception
today.
   And, so, what I want to do is finalize our standards and then
urge everybody in all branches of government to aspire to those
standards.

<HEAD>Company Official Says 100 Companies Involved In Libyan Chemical Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of a state-owned company
linked to construction of an alleged chemical weapons plant in Libya
was quoted as saying Monday that scores of Western companies
unwittingly helped build it.
   But the official, Ernst Pieper, president of the Salzgitter AG
concern, did not name any of the companies, Der Spiegel newsmagazine
reported.
   ``According to our current information, in addition to us, about
100 German, European and American companies were involved in the
Pharma 150, and in such a way that none appears to have had an
overview of the entire project,'' Der Spiegel quoted Pieper as
saying.
   Pharma 150 was the code name used for the factory in Rabta, south
of Tripoli, which U.S. officials say is a chemical weapons plant.
Libya says the plant makes pharmaceuticals.
   A Salzgitter subsidiary delivered switching equipment worth
$540,000 to the Rabta plant, as well as blueprints and piping.
Pieper was quoted as saying in the Spiegel interview that Salzgitter
was duped into delivering the equipment by Imhausen-Chemie, a West
German company based in Lahr.
   Imhausen-Chemie is the target of a criminal probe into its
dealings with Libya.
   Pieper was quoted as saying his company believed the equipment
was going to a plant in Hong Kong that Imhausen-Chemie allegedly set
up to conceal its dealings with Libya. The equipment never reached
Hong Kong and is suspected of having been diverted to Libya.
   ``The disguise appears to have been so perfect that none of the
many companies involved realized at the time who was behind the
project and where the deliveries where going to,'' Pieper was quoted
as saying.
   The Salzgitter president said in Der Spiegel he did not believe
that Imhausen-Chemie knew how to build a chemical weapons plant.
   ``Salzgitter does not possess any know-how to build poison gas
factories,'' he was quoted as saying. ``I am convinced that Imhausen
is also not capable of doing so. A third party must have done that
in Rabta.''
   Salzgitter is based in a town in Lower Saxony by the same name.

<HEAD>U.N. Says 500,000 in Sudan Need Food</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 500,000 people will need
emergency food relief in the southern Sudan this year, but a U.N.
agency is having trouble delivering shipments, officials said Monday.
   The World Food Program said it is facing ``tremendous logistical
problems in moving desperately needed relief food to the southern
provinces'' of the war-torn country due to bad roads and lack of
proper equipment.
   The agency, the food aid arm of the United Nations, said its
first overland shipment of food in more than four months recently
arrived in the town of Kaya near the Ugandan border. It consisted of
220 tons of corn aboard 16 trucks.
   The agency suspended ground shipments late last year after 11
drivers were killed when Sudanese rebels attacked a truck convoy in
September.
   The agency said it was organizing a second truck convoy to carry
another 400 tons of corn to Kaya.
   In a statement issued in Italy, the agency said more than 150,000
refugees have flocked to camps in Juba, about 90 miles north of
Kaya. It said they need 2,000 tons of food monthly, but that an even
greater amount must be delivered and stockpiled before roads are
made impassable by the start of the rainy season in late April or
early May.
   ``If overland transport proves insufficient to fulfill needs,
(the World Food Program) may consider initiating a new airlift to
Juba,'' the agency's statement said.
   The agency ended an airlift to the provincial capital in December
after delivering 3,700 tons of food, but several other
organizations, including the European Community and the
International Committee of the Red Cross, are continuing flights.
   The U.N. agency said little or no food has been delivered to more
than 200,000 refugees in Bahr el Ghazal and Upper Nile Provinces,
both far north of the Ugandan and Kenyan borders. It said 500,000
Sudanese will need emergency food this year.

<TEXT>
   But I do think, Rick, that it's fair that we not reach judgment
on Senate hearings before the Senate hearings are concluded, because
it's very hard to filter out fact from fiction, spurious allegation
from fact.
   And I am not about to make a judgment based on a sensationalized
newspaper story.
   I'm simply not going to do that.
   That wouldn't be fair, and I'm not sure how ethical it would be.
   So let's wait and see.
   This _ you're referring to the Tower matter up there.
   That matter has been looked at by the FBI.
   The committee now has that.
   They have the responsibility to make determination.
   And I'll be very interested to see what they say.
   But I am not going to make conclusions _ jump to conclusions
based on stories that may or may not have any validity at all.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, even if, as your spokesman says you do, you
continue to back Senator Tower for the position, there are those,
you've heard, who say that the best thing he could do for you is to
step aside, because even if confirmed, he then would become
``damaged goods,'' weaker in administering, a very, very tough job
on your behalf. How do you respond to that suggestion?
   A. Well, I think people would not want a person to step aside,
given rumor, particularly if the rumor is baseless.
   And the process _ what _ the problem is the process is taking a
little longer than I would like, and yet, I think the Senate has got
to do what they're doing _ looking at these allegations very
carefully.
   But, you know, as I said here at this same podium a while back,
the American people are basically fair.
   And, if these allegations prove to be allegations without fact
behind them, I think the people are going to say, ``Wait a minute.
What went on here? How come it was all this _ we'd read this one
day, and then kind of a puff of smoke the next?''
   And, so, I don't think, in your substantive question though, that
if it proves _ if the Senate committee gives its endorsement to the
senator, particularly after all of these allegations, that there is
any danger at all of damage to his credibility or his ability to do
the job.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, there are new and substantive allegations that
Senator Tower lost control over the highly classified security
documents and computer disks that were used in Geneva under his
watch. If those allegations prove to be founded, would you then
withdraw his nomination?
   A. I would not answer hypothetical questions of that nature.
   You're telling me something that I haven't heard before.
   And, we did have access to FBI reports.
   So, if this matter is now before the Congress, let them
investigate it.
   But, I can't go into a hypothesis.
   All I would be doing would be adding to, I think, speculation
that is not helpful at this juncture.
   Q. But, sir, will you pursue these allegations in the executive
branch? Are you going to track what the FBI is looking into? Are you
going to personally surveil these kinds of allegations yourself?
   A. Every rumor and every innuendo? No.
   But, if you make _ if there's some substantive allegation of this
nature, of course it would concern me.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, back to S&amp;Ls, if we might. Millions _
(laughter) _ millions of Americans save alternatively. That is, they
put their funds in mutual funds, stocks, and that kind of thing. As
I read it, you've now outlined a plan that places a lot of the S&amp;L
bailout on the backs of the general treasury. How fair is that?
   A. We've got a major problem and something has to be done.
   And this is the fairest system that the best minds in this
administration can come up with.
   And, so, I'd _ I, again, would ask you to ask the specifics of
the treasury burden to the chairman of the Federal Reserve or the
secretary of the treasury.
   Ask how they see that.

   But, look, as I've said, there is no easy answer to this.
   All I want to do is make a sound proposal, work to put it into
effect, and have that proposal such that the country won't have to
face this problem again.
   Yes, Dave?
   Q. Mr. President, you said you dropped the deposit fee idea. But
this plan you've given us has an increase in premimums that may be
paid by consumers as well as a large amount of taxpayer's money.
Isn't that the same thing _ consumers and taxpayers are still going
to have to pay the price for this?
   A. Well, as I indicated earlier on, there is no guarantee of
passing this on to the consumer, nor is there a guarantee it won't
be passed on.
   But this arrangement has been there since _ for 50 years.
   And you might argue whether it's been passed on or not, I just
don't know; I haven't seen the flow-through in the industry.
   But nothing is without pain when you come to solve a problem of
this magnitude.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, you've talked to several members of Congress in
various receptions and dinners and personal conversations over the
past couple of weeks, in many of them you discussed your plan for
this problem. What is your feeling for the reception that it's going
to get on Capitol Hill and of the selling job that it will make you
have to get it passed?
   A. We may have a big selling job.
   But I've been encouraged so far with the spirit epitomized by the
members of Congress, particularly at the joint leadership meeting
the other day.
   We didn't go into every detail of this; these plans were still
being formulated and I wanted to get their views.
   I was encouraged by what Bill Seidman told me earlier on about
how he _ what he felt the receptivity of the plan will be.
   But I don't think it's fair to the Congress to say that they have
signaled to me that they are going to be enthusiastic on this plan,
although I hope they are.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President _
   A. I'm going to take about three more, and then turn this over to
these gentlemen here who are prepared to go into as much detail as
you want.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, on these allegations that surround Tower now,
at least variations on the theme surfaced early in the transition _
allegations of womanizing and taking money from defense contractors,
that sort of thing. Have you satisfied yourself that he is still the
nominee you want? And can you give us, at this time, a wholehearted
endorsement of Tower?
   A. Yes, I can, and I will right now, because some of the very
same allegations that were floated that long ago apparently have
been looked at and examined by the best possible examiners _ I'm
talking about the FBI _ and found to be groundless.
   So, therefore, I'm not about to change my view.
   Now if somebody comes up with facts, I hope I'm not narrow-minded
enough that I wouldn't take a look, but I am not going to deal in
the kinds of rumors that I've seen reported and then knocked down,
and then reported and then knocked down.
   Yes?

<HEAD>Experts Praise Mrs. Dukakis for Quick Treatment of Drinking Problem</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Kitty Dukakis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alcoholism experts praised Kitty Dukakis on Monday
for seeking treatment of alcohol abuse after a relatively brief bout
of heavy drinking following her husband's loss of the presidential
election.
   Doctors attributed the family's quick action, in part, to their
awareness of addiction problems following Mrs. Dukakis's earlier
struggle with a dependence on diet pills.
   ``For a public figure, who knows any revelation about problems is
going to be widely publicized, it takes great courage to seek
treatment,'' said Dr. Domenic Ciraulo of New England Medical Center
in Boston.
   ``This is a family that certainly knows about substance abuse,''
he said. ``It's unusual to seek help so early, but it shows they
know the signs of trouble so well.''
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis said Monday that his wife
had been admitted to a private hospital in Newport, R.I. He said she
had never had a drinking problem until shortly after the Nov. 8
election, which Dukakis, the Democratic nominee, lost to George Bush.
   ``Unfortunately, a combination of physical exhaustion, the stress
of the campaign effort and the post-election letdown all combined to
create a situation in which, on a limited number of occasions while
at home, she has used alcohol in excessive quantities,'' the
governor said.
   Mrs. Dukakis was treated in 1982 for a 26-year reliance on
amphetamine diet pills.
   Dr. Peter Nathan, director of the Rutgers Centers for Alcohol
Studies in Piscataway, N.J., said that if the drinking only began in
November, there probably has not been time for Mrs. Dukakis to
become physically dependent on alcohol.
   ``If what the governor says is accurate, they have been quite
courageous in deciding to do something about this early,'' Nathan
said. ``The odds are far better that they will be able to get it
under control, and there won't be any permanent consequences.''
   Dr. Patricia Sutker of the Veterans Administration Medical Center
in New Orleans said that seeking treatment for alcohol abuse does
not necessarily mean someone is an alcoholic.
   ``You could go in because you don't like the fact that you drank
heavily on a few occasions,'' she said. ``You want to nip it in the
bud. She might not be an alcoholic and wants to go in for some
stress management.''
   Several experts said that people who already have had one form of
addiction are susceptible to developing another.
   ``Drug switching does occur, and the drug that's easiest to
switch into is alcohol,'' said Dr. Roger Weiss of McLean Hospital in
Belmont, Mass. ``It's easy to get, cheap, legal and the most
socially acceptable.''
   The experts discounted the once popular notion that some people
have addictive personalities. Instead, they said that abusers of
drugs and alcohol tend to have little in common except their
addiction.
   Ciraulo said people may turn to a variety of mood-altering
substances as a way of coping with their problems.
   ``As a way to deal with stress and pain, alcohol or any other
drug is an effective way on a temporary basis to relieve it,'' he
said. Some people may also ``experience depression or psychological
pain more intensively than others and then use drugs or alcohol as a
way to treat their own pain.''

   Q. Mr. President, there have been hints that Gorbachev may
propose a test to defuse the situation in Central America. I wonder
if you see the possibility of superpower deals in Central America
and, if so, what you _ if you could suggest what would be acceptable
to you?
   A. I don't know about a deal, but I can see a possibility of
cooperation in Central America, because I would like the Soviets to
understand that we have very special interests in this hemisphere,
particularly in Central America, and that our commitment to
democracy and to freedom and free elections and these principles is
unshakable.
   And I don't think they really have substantive interests in this
part of the world, certainly none that rival ours.
   So, I would like to think they would understand that.
   And there are so many areas where we could demonstrate a new
spirit of cooperation, and this would clearly be one of them.
   So, I'd like to think that is the way that the matter would be
approached by the Soviets.
   Yeah, a follow-up.
   Q. Could I follow up and ask you whether an understanding on
Central America, whether you'd be willing to include abandonment of
aid to the Contras as part of such an understanding?
   A. I wouldn't make a deal on that with the Soviets, nor would
that come up.
   I don't believe you'd ever have a _ I can't see a situation of
that nature arising, knowing, as I do, what will be negotiated and
discussed with the _ so I think that's a _ so hypothetical as to not
even be a possibility of any kind.
   Yeah, Charles, and then I do have to run.
   Q. Mr. President, we still don't know what the taxpayer's burden
is in here out of this $40 billion and cents, first from S&amp;L funds
and the shortfall from treasury funds. How big is it, and have you,
in going through your budget, had to knock out some things to pay
for this?
   A. We've had to knock out a lot of things on the overall budget
for a lot of different reasons, but I'd like to leave this to Dick
for the questioning, to give the specific amounts.
   It is shared, as I've indicated, and he can give you the amounts
that are involved.

<HEAD>Eds: New thruout with Dole, Mitchell comment; further on plans for
Tuesday votes.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The speaker of the House, Jim Wright, caved in
Monday to opponents of a 51 percent congressional pay raise,
conceding ``the majority has spoken'' in demanding a vote that will
likely keep senators and representatives from getting any increase.
   Wright set the vote for Tuesday. The Senate was expected to
quickly give its assent and sent legislation halting the raise, due
to take effect at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday, to President Bush. Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole said he expects Bush to sign it.
   The vote, Wright said, will be on ``a simple resolution of
disapproval'' of the raises, which would also affect federal judges
and top executive branch officials.
   Wright had planned to let the raise take effect Wednesday, then
have the House vote the next day to scale it back to 30 percent.
Members of Congress would have seen their annual salaries jump, at
least temporarily, from $89,500 to $135,000.
   The speaker relented after opponents won a dramatic vote to keep
the issue alive on the House floor. He said the chamber will vote
Tuesday and promised, ``The majority will rule.''
   The resolution would then go to the Senate, which voted 95-5
Thursday for a differently worded rejection measure.
   That chamber's majority leader, Sen. George J. Mitchell, D-Maine,
said he ``hopes and expects to bring up whatever the House sends
over'' and send it to the president before the raise becomes law,
according to Mitchell aides.
   Bush, at a late afternoon news conference, was asked, ``Would you
sign a bill that vetoes the pay raise, not only for the members of
Congress, but also for federal judges and other high officials in
the government?''
   He answered, in an apparent reference to the pay raise, ``I said
I would support it.''
   But Mitchell's Republican counterpart, Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
told reporters:
   ``I understand he'll sign it. He needs to do it by midnight so
the judiciary doesn't get a big step while everybody else is being
stepped on.''
   The Constitution forbids raises for judges from being reduced
once they take effect.
   Wright's turnaround came after pay raise opponents mustered a
238-88 majority against a House Democratic leadership motion to
adjourn.
   ``The majority has spoken, and the majority will speak
emphatically,'' Wright said afterwords.
   One leading opponent of the raise, consumer advocate Ralph Nader,
said Wright's capitulation showed he had realized ``that the power
of the people is greater than the power of his tyranny in (trying
to) close down the House of Representatives until the members got
their salary increase.''
   The chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, Rep. Bill Gray,
D-Pa., predicted there would be ``no pay raise, no change'' in the
lawmakers' salary. Gray also said he doubted the House would move to
ban speaking fees and other honoraria _ a plan favored by Wright in
return for the raise.
   Gray said members feared a vote to end Monday's debate and
adjourn ``was going to be interpreted as a vote on the pay raise.''
He said any vote to increase lawmakers' salary now would fail. Even
``if it's a vote on 4 percent, it ain't going to pass,'' Gray added.
   ``This pay raise is dead,'' said Rep. Thomas Tauke, R-Iowa, an
architect of the opposition strategy.
   Tauke, however, said he expects Congress to take up the issue
later, along with a review of honoraria, often paid to members by
special interests seeking to influence legislation.
   The vote and Wright's subsequent announcement came after Majority
Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., presiding over Monday's session,
refused to recognize a pay-raise opponent who wanted to introduce a
resolution calling for a vote on the hike.
   That set the stage for more than 30 minutes of barbed debate
between the two sides.
   From the start, the House electronic tote board showed the
adjournment motion, by House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif.,
was losing.
   Wright last week conducted a private survey of House members and
said the results showed they did not want a vote before the raise
took effect. Despite that, random surveys by The Associated Press
and other organizations showed sentiment in favor of a vote.
   A weekend Gallup poll indicated overwhelming public opposition to
the pay raise. The Gallup organization asked 1,001 adults from
Friday through Sunday whether they favored or opposed increasing
congressional pay from $89,500 to $135,000. The results, with a 4
percent margin of error, showed 82 percent opposed it with only 15
percent in favor.
   Meanwhile, the president of the American Bar Association,
addressing the group's convention in Denver, urged members to call
their congressmen to register their support for the pay raise for
judges. Robert Raven, the association's president, then gave his
listeners the phone number of the congressional switchboard.
   Besides the raise for members of Congress, the presidential
commission proposed:
   _Increasing the president's pay from $200,000 to $350,000 and the
vice president's from $115,000 to $175,000. The raises would not
affect President Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle.
   _Raising the salaries of top federal officials, now in the range
of $75,500 to $99,500, to a range of $115,000 to $155,000.
   _Hiking the salary of the chief justice from $115,000 to $175,000
and the salaries of associate justices of the Supreme Court from
$110,000 to $165,000.
   _Raising the pay of federal appellate judges from $95,000 to
$140,000 and that of federal district judges from $89,500 to
$135,000.
   Retired congressmen, presidents, vice presidents, top federal
officials and other federal judges would also receive higher
pensions under the commission's proposal.

<HEAD>Bush Calls for Superpower Cooperation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Monday there is a chance
for ``a new spirit of cooperation'' between the Soviet Union and the
United States in solving Central American problems.
   Bush was asked at a news conference if he foresees a deal with
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to resolve the region's problems,
which include a superpower dispute over leftist-ruled Sandinista.
   The Soviets help supply the Sandinista while the United States
provides aid to the anti-Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   Bush said he wouldn't make a deal on Contra aid, but added, ``I
can see a possibility of cooperation in Central America.''
   The Soviets don't have ``substantive interest in that part of the
world, certainly none that rival ours. So I would like to think they
would understand that,'' Bush said. ``And there are so many areas
where we could demonstrate a new spirit of cooperation and this
would clearly be one of them.''
   The United States has an ``unshakable'' commitment to democracy,
freedom and free elections in the five-nation region, he said.
   Bush hasn't spelled out his Central American policies,
particularly the Contra aid question and the fighting in neighboring
El Salvador between the U.S.-backed government and leftist rebels.
   Bush said he is reviewing the policy of his predecessor Ronald
Reagan, which involved unswerving support for military aid to the
Contras.
   But officials have said no Contra aid will be sought in the near
future and the administration is willing to support regional efforts
toward a diplomatic solution to the Contra war.
   Bush and Secretary of States James Baker haven't yet named a new
assistant secretary of state for Latin America.
   Baker has settled on Bernard Aronson, a Democrat who helped the
Reagan administration win Contra aid, but the appointment hasn't
been announced, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The previous holder of the post, Elliott Abrams, discussed
Nicaragua during several meetings with Soviet officials, but no
substantive action ever came of the meetings.
   The United States has continually objected to the Soviet supply
of weaponry to Nicaragua's leftist government, saying the shipments
continued through 1988, even after U.S. arms to the Contras were
stopped.
   Vice President Dan Quayle visited the region last week and met
with presidents of the four Central American democracies _ El
Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala.
   The United States refuses to meet with Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega on the grounds that he should conduct talks first with
the Contras.
   Quayle said the administration supports the regional effort by
the five presidents to reach a diplomatic solution.
   Bush sent a message last week to the Salvadoran military and the
government, urging human rights improvements. Quayle deplored human
rights violations from the leftist guerillas and the right wing
factions, and indicated that unless El Salvador improves its record,
U.S. aid to the country would likely be jeopardized.

   The chief of U.N. peacekeeping operations
protested to Israel about the expulsion of dozens of Lebanese by a
predominantly Christian militia serving Israel in a border
``security zone.''
   The South Lebanon Army militia, trained and supplied by Israel,
helps Israeli soldiers patrol the zone just inside Lebanon and helps
them fight Moslem guerrillas hostile to Israel.
   At least 70 Lebanese have been expelled from the zone in the past
month, apparently because they refused to cooperate with the militia.
   Marrack Goulding, undersecretary-general in charge of
peacekeeping operations, complained over the weekend about the
expulsions and tension between peacekeepers and Israel to Johanan
Bein, the Israeli U.N. ambassador, U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani
said Monday.
   No appropriate officials were at the Israeli mission Monday to
respond.
   Ambassador Rachid Fakhoury of Lebanon released a letter to
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on Monday complaining of
Israel's activities in south Lebanon.
   ``Terrorism, blockade, harassment, deprivation of freedoms,
raids, expulsion, demolition of homes, torture, imprisonment and
pressures are essential elements of daily life even in the areas
controlled by the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon,'' he said.
   ``Not one week goes by without the Israeli army expelling groups
or individuals from the region.''

   Biologists Edward B. Lewis of the California
Institute of Technology and John B. Gurdon of Britain's Cambridge
University were awarded the 1989 Wolf Prize in medicine Monday for
their work in molecular biology.
   The $100,000 prize will be presented to them in May.
   Lewis, 70, a native of Wilkes Barre, Pa., was recognized for his
studies of genes in fruit flies that serve as master plans for the
insects' growth and might help explain some birth defects in humans.
   Lewis has been a professor of biology at Caltech for 40 years, is
a graduate of the University of Minnesota and a past president of
the Genetics Society of America.
   Working with the Drosophila fly, Lewis identified a group of
genes known as the bithorax complex in the cell nucleus, the
foundation said.
   The genes work at the earliest stages of an embryo's development
to control formation of a fly's head, chest and abdomen, as well as
formation of wings and other organs included in those body segments,
Lewis said.
   Homeo boxes, which are portions of homeotic genes, ``haven't
changed much since the fly'' and are found in mice and humans, in
which they also help direct formation of the head, chest and
abdomen, he added.
   Thus, some basic and very ancient parts of genes that control
anatomy are shared by flies, mice and humans, Lewis said.
   Gurdon, 55, a native of Dippenhall, Hampshire, and a graduate of
Christ Church College, Oxford, has been at Cambridge since 1972.
   The professor of cell biology was cited for his work with frogs.
He found that certain cells taken from the organs of a mature animal
contain all the genetic information necessary to produce a frog, the
foundation said. He showed such cells could be made to develop into
tadpoles.
   The Wolf Foundation was set up in 1975 by Ricardo Wolf, a
German-born chemist who emigrated to Cuba and later served as its
ambassador to Israel. He died in Israel in 1981.

   Listen, thank you all very much.
   And now I'm going to turn this over to Secretary Brady.
   And then I _ in order, I guess, they'll refer to each of these
others.
   Huh?
   Q. Mr. President, one more word for the word for the small _
   Q. _ back here, Mr. President?
   A. What was that substantive question? (Laughter.)
   Q. All the way in the back! We didn't see you get back in this
area.
   A. We didn't get that far back, no.
   But if there's been an egregious offense to those in the back
benches, I will take one parting question, and inasmuch as you
raised it, fire away.
   Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Back on the ethics issue,
a couple of your prospective _
   A. Mindful that the last question always does get you in great
trouble. Go ahead. (Laughter.)
   Q. A couple of your prospective nominees _ one of your
prospective nominees and your counsel have just recently changed
their minds on matters that would have violated the ethics rules
under the Reagan administration. Did you have difficulty in getting
the word out that times would be tougher under your administration?
   A. No, I don't think so.
   For example, if you're referring to the Boyden Gray matter, which
I think you are, that matter was reviewed every single year by the
Office of Government Ethics.
   And he was deemed in compliance every single year.
   But now we've got a new ball game here.
   He's the general counsel here in the White House, and I'm the
president.
   And I've set out rhetorically the highest possible standards and
we're trying to back that up by findings from this commission.
   And so, I do think that _ that we've got _ we've got to be very
careful about perceptions of impropriety when it comes to conflict
of interest, not rumors or innuendoes of one sort or another.
   I don't think you can _ I should deal in those things.
   But when it comes to perceived conflicts of interest, I'd like
our people to bend over backwards.
   And I think that's what has happened in both the question of Lou
Sullivan, whether he's entitled to _ all he did was ask, ``Am I
entitled to continue these arrangements with this small university?''
   And all Boyden did, in my view now, is to try to go a step beyond
what the government ethics office has said to avoid the perception
of impropriety.
   But _ so, I think it might be different now.
   I have to approach it differently as president, not that you have
lower standards, but I just think that again, this whole question of
perception, we've got to look at it very, very carefully.
   But I want to be fair.
   I do not want to have the loudest charge, no matter how
irresponsible, be that that sets the standards.
   We've got to achieve more objective standards.
   And that's why I'm putting a lot of faith in the _ hope to put a
lot of faith in the findings of Judge Wilkey and former Attorney
General Griffin Bell.
   And they will be looking at all these matters in terms of
reality, and then to some degree I'm sure, in terms of perception.

<TEXT>
   So, what might be legal and what might be perfectly sound
ethically might have to be altered, given this new approach because
of perception.
   It's a delicate one.
   I don't want to have the standards set in such an irresponsible
way that good people just throw up their hands and say, ``Look, who
needs that kind of grief? Who needs it? Why should I have to give up
all my whatever it is, my health plan from the XYZ Company?''
   And yet, on the other hand, we're in a different time now; we're
in a time when we've got to try to set these standards as high as
possible.
   So, I think Dr. Sullivan did the right thing in asking what was
proper.
   I think Boyden Gray did the correct thing every year in asking
what was proper and reviewing his own personal holdings in a family
company with the ethics office, but now, taking another step because
of perception in this case.
   So, we've got to reach _ we've got to work with these individuals
to find the proper answer, and we've got to work with the commission
to try to codify these standards.
   Q. Sir, if I might follow up, you said during the campaign very
clearly that your staffers would not take outside income. I wonder
why they need a legal opinion to understand that.
   A. They had a legal opinion saying it was perfectly proper from
this family company.
   And so, now we're changing that and saying, ``Look, there's this
different perception problem here in this new era, so let's bend
over as far backwards as we possibly can to recognize that.''
   Thank you all very much.
   Q. What about leveraged buyouts, Mr. President?
   A. There's your LBO man right there. (Referring to Brady.)
   (Laughter.)

<UNK>Timman Wins Fifth Game Against Portisch, Ties Match</UNK>
<DATELINE>ANTWERP, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jan Timman of Holland fought back from a
losing position with black on Monday to defeat Lajos Portisch of
Hungary in the fifth game in his World Chess Championship Candidates
quarterfinal.
   With only one more game to go, Timman's victory tied the match at
2.5-2.5. Portisch won the third encounter in the six-game match last
week, and the other three games played so far ended in draws.
   The 37-year-old Dutchman's performance in Monday's action was not
the sort that will earn his win a place in chess theory books.
   Needing at least a draw to keep alive his chances against the
51-year-old Hungarian, Timman chose a somewhat unusual variation of
the Modern Defense in an apparent effort to offset his opponent's
opening advantage.
   But Portisch, one of the world's greatest opening theoreticians,
played as if he had seen it all before.
   With a series of strong, confident moves, he built up a vastly
superior position, sacrificing an exchange to blast a trail for his
center pawns on their advance to eventual promotion.
   ``My God'', was all Timman's West German second, Vlastimil Hort,
could say when he studied the position after the first twenty moves.
   Dutch grandmaster Genna Sosonko was more explicit.
   ``It's sad,'' he commented, ``but all black can do now is hope
for white to make a mistake. It would not be the first time Portisch
gets nervous when he seems to be winning.''
   For 10 moves, however, the Hungarian did just fine, steadily
working on his pawn advance and increasing the pressure on black's
hedged-in troops.
   But when the crucial moment came and one of his advanced pawns
was on the verge of reaching the eighth rank, Portisch made a
serious error, allowing Timman to return the exchange and even out
completely.
   A few moves later, it was Timman who had the upper hand, and he
made no mistakes. A black pawn, supported by queen and bishop,
reached the second rank, and Portisch had to weaken his position in
order to block it.
   Timman was at his best in this stage, exploiting white's
weaknesses to the full and gradually gaining command of the whole
board.
   Portisch soldiered on for a while, but resigned at his 47th, when
he stood to lose a piece.
   The Hungarian will be playing black in Wednesday's sixth game of
the match, which will go into overtime with a two-game extension if
neither player manages a win.
   In case the extension fails to produce a winner, a series of
sudden-death rapid games at increasing speeds will have to decide
the outcome of the contest.
   The winner of the Candidates series will challenge world champion
Garri Kasparov for his world title in 1990.

   Afghanistan's former king says he is willing to help
form a new government and prevent a bloodbath after the Soviets
complete their troop withdrawal, his spokesman said Monday.
   Mohammed Zaher Shah said urgent measures were necessary to
promote national unity in Afghanistan and prevent ``dissension,
civil war and unnecessary bloodshed,'' in a message read to The
Associated Press by his spokesman and brother-in-law, Gen. Abdul
Wali.
   ``Now that the Afghan nation is about to achieve the aims of its
heroic struggle, I wish to reiterate yet again that I am prepared to
render, without any claim or precondition, any service to my country
which would reflect the will of the majority of my compatriots,''
said Zaher Shah, who has lived in exile in Rome since being
overthrown in 1973.
   Afghan rebel groups known as mujahedeen, or Islamic ``holy
warriors,'' have been arguing over the process toward forming a
transitional government to succeed the Soviet-backed regime. They
have scheduled a meeting in Pakistan on Friday that is intended to
pave the way for elections among Afghan refugees for representatives
that will form an all-Islamic government.
   The former king urged all sides to reject ``short-term political
goals and personal gains'' and work together to rebuild the country
in a political process free from ``pressure, intimidation,
discrimination, privilege or foreign interference.''
   Speculation about a possible role for the former king has been
brewing for more than a year. In December, Zaher Shah met in Rome
with Yuri Vorontsov, a Soviet envoy who has been seeking to promote
a peace settlement in Afghanistan.
   While Zaher Shah still has a following in Afghanistan, some
Moslem rebel groups oppose his return.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979, fighting
anti-Marxist Moslem guerrillas backed by the United States and
Pakistan. The Soviet withdrawal, which begin in May under a
U.N.-mediated agreement, is to be completed by Feb. 15.
   Zaher Shah lost his throne in July 1973 when his cousin and
former prime minister, Mohammed Daud, seized power in a coup. The
king was in Italy at the time for treatment of rheumatism.

<HEAD>Committee Recommends Changes in Law to Permit Nazi Trials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of Britain who are suspected of being
Nazi war criminals could be tried quickly if the government enacted
simple changes in the law, a parliamentary committee said Monday.
   Nazi-hunters have accused Britain of delaying action on fugitive
Nazis and their collaborators, including a Lithuanian-born man the
Simon Wiesenthal Center of Los Angeles says was involved in killing
thousands of Jews.
   The War Crimes Group, with members from all parties, said British
laws could be amended within six months to give courts jurisdiction
over war crimes committed abroad by people who were not British
citizens at the time.
   Parliament has amended laws to allow prosecution of hijackers,
terrorists and others who committed ``sufficiently grave'' crimes
abroad and later obtained citizenship, the committee said.
   ``The crimes under consideration, principally those of murder,
manslaughter and genocide, were all criminal `according to the
general principles of law recognized by civilized nations' at the
time of their commission,'' according to the 71-page report.
   It said Australia and Canada had enacted such laws since 1987 in
order to prosecute war criminals.
   The government is expected to complete an investigation next
month of allegations that Nazis who committed war crimes in World
War II are living in Britain. Investigators also are considering
whether the law can be amended to allow prosecution.
   Philip Rubenstein, secretary of the committee, said it fears the
government will delay action for two or three years even though
amending the statutes requires ``extremely minor legislation.'' The
report said 250 people are being investigated for possible war
crimes.
   Last summer, the Wiesenthal Center gave the government a list of
13 alleged war criminals it said had come to Britain. The Home
Office said it would try to trace the men, Russians now aged 63-89
whose names were first submitted by the Soviet ambassador in
November 1947.
   The Wiesenthal center has identified 400 alleged war criminals in
eight Western countries. The most publicized British case is of
Antanas Gecas, born in Lithuania and now living in Scotland, who
acknowledges witnessing killings but denies involvement.

   President Bush on Monday stood by John Tower,
his embattled nominee to be secretary of defense, and said the
former Texas senator shouldn't have to withdraw because of rumors
about his personal life.
   The confirmation process ``is taking a little longer than I would
like, and yet I think the Senate has got to do what they're doing --
looking at these allegations very carefully,'' Bush said.
   Bush added that if any rumors or innuendo turn out to be ``a
substantive allegation of this nature, of course it would concern
me.''
   He said he still endorses Tower, but added, ``If somebody comes
up with facts, I hope I'm not narrow-minded enough that I wouldn't
take a look. But I am not going to deal in the kinds of rumors that
I've seen reported and then knocked down and then reported and then
knocked down.''
   Tower has subject of allegations that he is a womanizer and has a
drinking problem.
   The administration said FBI investigations into the matter had
turned up nothing that would prevent Tower from carrying out his
task as head of the Pentagon.
   But the Senate Armed Services Committee last week put off a
Thursday vote on Tower 's confirmation, saying two new allegations
came up that had to be checked out.
   Although Bush said the FBI report was delivered Monday to the
committee, the panel's chairman, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and ranking
Republican, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said they hadn't seen any such
document.
   Nunn said, ``We have not had anything delivered to us, and we are
awaiting on it, so the status quo is right where it was.'' Asked
about Bush's statement, Nunn elaborated that ``we've done some
talking back and forth but we've received no report whatsoever.''
   Bush refused to speculate about the Tower rumors. ``If this
matter is now before the Congress, let them investigate it. But I
can't go into a hypothesis. All I would be doing would be adding to,
I think, speculation that is not helpful at this juncture,'' Bush
said.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said at a news
conference that Tower's confirmation chances had probably not been
hurt by delay in a vote.
   ``We should get the nomination out,'' Dole said. ``If we
investigated every rumor about every senator, we wouldn't have a
quorum around this place. I checked as late as 4 p.m. and I haven't
learned anything new. The FBI should wrap up its investigation by
tomorrow morning.''
   Asked about suggestions from some quarters Tower should withdraw,
Bush said, ``I think people would not want a person to step aside,
given rumor, particularly if the rumor is baseless.''
   Tower participated in White House sessions on the defense budget,
both on Saturday and again Monday, said White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said.

   Israel formally asked the United States on
Monday to stop talking to the PLO, and top leaders began a campaign
to convince the U.S. administration that PLO chairman Yasser Arafat
broke a pledge to end terrorism.
   An Israeli diplomat delivered the request to the State
Department's Bureau of Near East Affairs, sources in Washington said
on condition of anonymity.
   Israeli leaders cited the case of five Palestinian guerrillas
killed Saturday night by Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon, near the
Israeli border. Israel's embassy in Washington submitted information
``identifying details and additional facts linking the PLO to that
squad,'' Israel Television said.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said ``we're looking
into'' whether the encounter Saturday violated Arafat's renunciation
of terrorism. Other officials said the United States was seeking
additional information.
   In Jerusalem, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens accused the Palestine
Liberation Organization of breaking a promise to refrain from terror
and gave the firefight as evidence.
   In a speech to American Jewish leaders, he said Israel was urging
the United States to reconsider its dialogue with the PLO on grounds
the conditions for such contact had been ``clearly and unequivocally
violated.''
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said threats by Arafat against
Palestinians who might negotiate with Israel were ``the worst terror
... more important even than an attempt to infiltrate from Lebanon.''
   On the main shopping street of Arab east Jerusalem, police fired
rubber bullets, tear gas and a water cannon to subdue dozens of
Palestinian stone throwers who smashed cars and shop windows.
   Arab witnesses said the demonstrators blocked the street with
blazing tires and overturned garbage bins. Israel radio said two
police officers suffered minor injuries.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, soldiers shot and wounded a
15-year-old Palestinian girl in the leg during clashes, Arab doctors
said. The army said it was checking the report.
   Also Monday, assailants set fire to the Israeli tax office in the
occupied West Bank town of Qalqiliya, an army official said. The top
floor of the two-story building was gutted, the official said.
   Hamas, a Moslem fundamentalist group, claimed responsibility for
the attack in slogans sprayed on city walls. Tax boycotts are part
of the Palestinians 14-month uprising against Israeli occupation of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The revolt, which has taken the lives of 374 Palestinians and 15
Israelis, was largely responsible for the more moderate stance
Arafat stance that led the United States to open a dialogue with the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   U.S. officials opened talks with the PLO in December after Arafat
renounced terrorism and said he accepted Israel. Israeli officials
were shocked at the U.S. move, which ended a 13-year boycott.
   The Jewish state considers the PLO a terrorist group and refuses
to talk with it.
   The army said the guerrillas slain Saturday were en route to
carry out an attack against targets inside Israel. The guerrillas
had hand grenades, a pistol equipped with a silencer and wire
cutters, army officials said.
   Three were identified as members of the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist PLO faction, and the other two as
members of the radical Palestine Liberation Front.
   On Sunday, the groups issued a statement saying the target was
within the Israeli security security zone in south Lebanon.
   But on Monday, Israel radio reported they issued another
statement that said the failed attack was ``an answer to the
attempts by some Palestinian leaders to put an end to military
struggle against Zionism.''
   The statement reportedly said the two groups would not stop
anti-Israeli attacks from Lebanon as instructed by Arafat.
   Arens, in a speech before the Conference of Presidents of Major
American Jewish Organizations, said the U.S. conditions for a
dialogue with the PLO ``as they were set forth by the State
Department have been clearly and unequivocally violated.''
   ``I presume that in Washington they also noticed what happened,
but to the extent that somebody there may not have noticed, we will
draw his attention to it,'' Arens said.
   Seymour Reich, head of the U.S. group, said the Jewish leaders
would pressure the Bush administration to end contacts with the PLO.
   ``I'm not sure the administration is prepared to cut off the
dialogue yet,'' Reich said. ``But we're going to press on them these
issues.''
   Israel's Supreme Court, meanwhile, ruled that military officials
can be forced to disclose secret evidence against Palestinians
facing deportation, an Israeli defense lawyer said.
   The ruling came on an appeal by Balal Shakshir, a Palestinian
from the West Bank city of Nablus who was ordered deported last
year, said Leah Tzemel, one of his lawyers.
   In previous appeals, military prosecutors did not have to show
the defendant evidence against him if the Defense Ministry said the
information was classified. Shakshir's appeal is continuing.
   Since the uprising began, 49 Palestinians have been deported to
Lebanon from the occupied lands.

   The last military convoys rolled north
toward the border Monday, Soviet officials said, more than a week
before the deadline for the Red Army to leave a frustrating war in
which it lost more than 13,000 men.
   A Soviet military spokesman said less than 20,000 Soviet soldiers
remain in Afghanistan and that they were moving toward the border on
Monday.
   But in Kabul, hundreds of Soviet soldiers still guarded the
airport, where military transports brought in food and fuel to ease
shortages caused by a blockade of the capital by Moslem guerrillas
who surround it.
   In Moscow, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda said ``the last
Soviet soldier left Kabul'' on Sunday. Soviet officials in the
Afghan capital, however, said about 1,000 Red Army troopers would
remain at the airport until the end of next week.
   Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister, met with
officials in neighboring Pakistan but did not find a way to end the
11-year-old civil war peacefully. He said Monday the Soviets would
continue supporting the Marxist government in Kabul but would not
send troops back into the country.
   Soviet envoy Yuli Vorontsov left Tehran after talks with Afghan
guerrillas leaders in Iran, Afghanistan's neighbor on the west.
   He said he hoped ``all political forces'' would join a coalition
government after the Soviets are gone, Iran's official news agency
reported, but the insurgents have consistently refused such
proposals.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April
1978, and Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979,
growing in numbers to an estimated 115,000 by the time the
withdrawal began May 15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement.
   All are to be out of the country by Feb. 15. The Kremlin says
more than 13,000 Soviet soldiers were killed and 35,000 wounded in
the nine years.
   Soviet diplomats said Monday all Red Army soldiers in Shindand
left their garrison, the last Soviet military complex in the
country. They said the soldiers headed out of the western city over
the weekend to meet a convoy at Herat and were expected at the
border Wednesday or Thursday.
   Pravda said Soviet troops had moved defensive checkpoints on the
Salang Highway to about 50 miles north of Kabul at a tunnel through
some of the roughest terrain of 260-mile withdrawal route.
   Pravda said insurgents did not attack Soviet convoys on the
Salang, the only land route to the Soviet border from the capital,
but four avalanches crashed down on retreating columns Sunday. It
reported three soldiers killed and one injured.
   ``Terrorist grenades'' wounded three Soviet officers who were
handing over vehicles to the Afghan army Sunday in a Kabul suburb,
the paper said.
   At Termez, a Soviet border city where an airborne regiment
arrived Monday from Afganistan, Lt. Col. Igor Korolev said the last
Red Army soldiers were moving toward the border.
   The military spokesman said a total of 20,000 troops were still
in the provinces of Balkh, Samangan, Baglan and Parvan _ between
Kabul and the Soviet border to the north _ and in the northwestern
Afghan province of Herat.
   Thousands of residents, servicemen and relatives greeted the men
of the 350th Parachute Regiment as they came across the Friendship
Bridge over the Amu River into Termez. The unit had been in
Afghanistan since 1984.
   A brass band played. Soldiers waved flags and stuffed red
carnations into the muzzles of their submachine guns.
   On the road behind the Kabul airport, by contrast, several young
Soviets clutched their rifles nervously as they manned checkpoint
bunkers.
   Andrei, a 20-year-old from Moldavia, said he and the others would
be flown home before Feb. 15 but had not been told exactly when.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said guerrilla shelling
killed eight people in Kabul province. It said one person was killed
and two were wounded in the cities of Gardiz and Khost in Paktia
province.
   Rockets and rocket-propelled grenades hit residential areas in
Herat and the airport at Kandahar in the south, the agency said.
   Guerrillas control nearly the Afghan countryside and, when the
Soviets are gone, holding the cities will be left to Afghanistan's
conscript army. The insurgents predict the Marxist regime of
President Najib, who uses only one name, will collapse quickly.
   A plane leaving Kabul on Monday took Charge d'Affaires Roymond
Petit, the highest-ranking French diplomat, his wife and three
Austrian diplomats to New Delhi.
   Also aboard were relatives of Yugoslav, East German and
Vietnamese diplomats. The last remaining U.S. diplomats left last
week.
   Ian Mackley, who had been Britain's senior diplomat in Kabul,
said in the Indian capital the simplest solution would be for Najib
``to be on the last plane out with the last Russian.''

   The White House asked Congress on Monday to
reschedule confirmation hearings for Louis Sullivan, the Health and
Human Services secretary-designate, in the wake of his decision to
forfeit nearly $300,000 from his medical school presidency.
   No hearing date had been set by late Monday afternoon.
   The move by the administration signaled that the White House is
satisfied with Sullivan's financial disclosure and the FBI
background check, which had been cited earlier as reasons to
postpone a previously scheduled hearing.
   The hearing was put back on track after Sullivan decided to forgo
$297,000 in funds due him from his contract with the Morehouse
School of Medicine in Atlanta, which he founded and heads as
president.
   In a White House statement issued last weekend, Sullivan said he
had agreed to take an unpaid leave of absence to avoid any
appearance of a conflict of interest between the HHS job and
Morehouse, which receives about $5.8 million a year in federal funds.
   Sullivan had originally asked the White House for permission to
take a paid sabbatical from Morehouse. After having worked at
Morehouse for 13 years, he was entitled to a two-year leave at half
pay _ about $200,000 total, according to a senior administration
official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   The Office of Government Ethics at first glance approved the
request, but later reversed itself because the school's sabbatical
policy did not apply uniform standards to everyone at the school
regardless of their situation, the source said.
   Sullivan, however, had another source of potential income from
Morehouse that met with approval of the ethics office, the White
House counsel's office and the Justice Department, the source said.
That was a severance clause in his five-year contract as president,
on which he has 20 months left. Under that clause, he was entitled
to pay for those 20 months _ $297,000 _ if he severed his ties with
the school, the official said.
   Sullivan decided to take the severance pay and cut his ties with
Morehouse, the official said, explaining that the Atlanta doctor
``is not someone with a lot of independent means'' and wants to keep
his Atlanta home during his tenure in Washington.
   However, after news reports appeared about a possible
arrangement, Sullivan felt he was ``taking a beating in the press''
and decided ``on balance it was just not worth it,'' the source said.
   Sullivan now plans to borrow money and his wife, a lawyer, will
go back to work to make ends meet, the official said.
   In Atlanta, Sullivan earned $172,000 a year as Morehouse
president. As HHS secretary, he would make $99,500, though that
could go up to $155,000 if Congress approves a pending pay raise.
   Sullivan's decision to forgo the money surprised many in the
nation's capital, though ethics officials say it is not unusual for
people entering government to give up large sums of money due them
from former employers.
   ``There are government people who give up unbelieveable sums to
take government positions ... because they are afraid it could
create a problem for them,'' said Don Campbell, deputy director of
the Office of Government Ethics. ``It happens with frequency.''
   However, there are also people at Sullivan's level who do take
large sums from former employers, ``deferred income'' that is
legally theirs because it had been earned before they came to the
government or money afforded them in a contract buyout clause, for
example.
   The new agriculture secretary, Clayton K. Yeutter, last year
while he was U.S. trade representative received $561,602 from the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange for an annual installment for deferred
earnings plus the after-tax proceeds of a lump sum distribution.
Yeutter had been president of the exchange before joining the Reagan
Cabinet.
   Sullivan, however, feared that his leave from Morehouse, combined
with controversy over his statements about abortion and the FBI's
focus on his connection to a Georgia politician convicted of
extortion, could affect his crediblity and that of the Bush
administration, the source said.
   The official quoted Sullivan as saying that he ``simply accepted
this as unfortunate, but this is a cost of becoming part of the
government.''
   On Capitol Hill, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee, which will hold Sullivan's confirmation
hearing, praised the nominee, saying his decision to give up the
funds ``shows a major personal commitment to public service.''
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said he admired Sullivan for his
decision, but said no one should be pressured to give up funds to
which they are legally entitled.
   ``We have so much pressure in the government, only those born
with two gold spoons in their mouth will be able to serve around
here pretty soon,'' he said. ``It is impossible for me to understand
this pressure that comes on people who were not born wealthy and who
have earned a certain right.''

   A convoy of Soviet paratroopers came home
from Afghanistan on Monday to a bittersweet brass-band welcome, and
a military spokesman said 20,000 Soviet soldiers remain in the
country.
   The 350th Parachute Regiment, which had been stationed in
Afghanistan since 1984, rumbled across the Friendship Bridge
spanning the Amu River and into Termez, red flags waving and
headlights shining on the 60 tanks and armored personnel carriers.
   A 20-piece military band played the Soviet national anthem and
martial airs.
   The 300 paratroopers, commanded by Lt. Col. Alexander Skachkov,
were presented with red carnations, which they pushed down the
barrels of the weapons on their armored vehicles and into the
muzzles of their submachine guns.
   That sign of peace marked the end of their involvement in the
conflict that took the lives of more than 13,000 Soviet soldiers and
injured 35,000 others.
   Soviet officials brought about 150 foreign correspondents to this
border town in Soviet Uzbekistan for the welcoming ceremonies.
   Despite the publicity effort, the welcome was a relatively
low-level affair. The highest-ranking official to speak was Valery
Sudarenkov, first deputy prime minister of Uzbekistan.
   Hayratan, Afghanistan, on the other side of the river is the
terminus of the Salang Highway from Kabul, the main withdrawal route
of the Soviet soldiers.
   Convoy after convoy of withdrawing soldiers reached the border
area in the past week. But Uzbekistan officials bused in hundreds of
school children and workers to give an official welcome to the 350th
Parachute Regiment.
   The workers and students were entertained with loud popular
music, including American artist Stevie Wonder's ``I Just Called to
Say I Love You,'' and ate food provided by several dozen specially
installed stands.
   A freight train carrying military equipment could be seen
crossing the bridge before the spectators pressed to the edge of the
reviewing stand to catch the first glimpse of the returning warriors.
   Just before the welcome, military spokesman Lt. Col. Igor Korolev
said the last remaining Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan were on the
move toward the border.
   Korolev said that as of 8 a.m. Monday, ``more than 30,000
soldiers have left in the second half of the withdrawal.''
   The Soviet Union withdrew half of its 100,000 soldiers from
Afghanistan by Aug. 15 and must complete the second half of the
pullout by Feb. 15, under a U.N.-brokered agreement. The Kremlin
intervened militarily in Afghanistan in December 1979.
   Korolev said fewer than 20,000 Soviet soldiers remained in Balkh,
Samangan, Baglan, Parvan and Herat provinces, and that they were
moving toward the border on Monday.
   Herat, as well as the four north-central provinces between Kabul
and the border, are along main withdrawal routes.
   The soldiers are returning to a society where the opposition of
many to the Afghanistan war and indifference to their service have
caused returning soldiers difficulty in adjusting.
   Dozens of people in the crowd in Termez were searching for
familiar faces among the group of returning Afghanistan veterans.
One of the few who were successful was Maria Sabriba, who found her
grandson, Eldar Galiev.
   The diminutive grandmother's face lit up as she told reporters
she had seen her grandson. She said he had written a letter saying
he was in Mongolia, rather than Afghanistan, so that she wouldn't
worry about him.
   ``At least he's healthy,'' she said, beaming.
   Sudarenkov, the Uzbekistan official, said, ``We wish you to join
the front ranks of those fighting for revolutionary change'' in
Soviet society.
   The tanks, armored personnel carriers and armored cars that
carried the returning soldiers held banners proclaiming ``peace to
you, Afghanistan'' and ``the order of the fatherland has been
fulfilled.''

   A huge arctic air mass chilled much of the nation Monday as 33
communities posted record low temperatures and roads in the South
turned into sheets of ice.
   Freezing rain fell from south Texas to the Tennessee Valley,
closing roads near Laredo, Texas; in Brazoria County, Texas; and
Interstate 20 in some areas from Monroe, La., to Vicksburg, Miss.
Trucks jackknifed and traffic accidents were reported on Interstate
55 north of Winona, Miss.
   The coldest temperature readings in the country were over the
central Rockies and the Intermountain region, between the Rockies
and the Sierra Nevada and the mountains of eastern Oregon and
Washington.
   The mercury plunged to 54 below at Logan Canyon, Utah, minus 51
at Craig, Colo., minus 47 at Maybell, Colo., minus 46 at Woodruff,
Utah, and minus 42 at Randolph, Utah.
   The record low temperatures Monday included Ely, Nev., which
dropped to 30 below zero, its coldest on record for any date.
   Other all-time lows were 47 below zero at Roosevelt, Utah,
erasing the previous record of 32 below, and 33 below at Richfield,
Utah.
   Temperature records for the date included Abilene, Texas, 9
degrees; Bakersfield, Calif., 27; Boise, Idaho, 11; Casper, Wyo.,
minus 20; Eugene, Ore., 8; Oakland, Calif., 34; Portland, Ore., 15;
Reno, Nev., minus 15; Sacramento, Calif., 28; Salt Lake City, minus
14; San Francisco, 31; and Seattle, 18.
   New Mexico's northern ski areas received 1 to 7 feet of snow over
the weekend.
   A band of snow developed from north-central Oklahoma to central
Missouri into central Illinois. At noon, nearly 4 inches had
accumulated at Columbia, Mo.
   The arctic air flowing across the warmer waters of the lower
Great Lakes continued producing snow. One to 3 inches of snow fell
over northeast Ohio, and a heavy snow warning was in effect Monday
night.
   Freezing drizzle, sleet and snow fell over portions of New
England, while the Gulf Coast region and southern Atlantic states
had rain and some thunderstorms.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 12
degrees below zero at Evanston, Wyo., to 86 degrees at Fort Myers,
Fla.
   The low in the nation Monday morning was 54 degrees below zero at
Logan Canyon, Utah.
   The forecast for Tuesday was snow from the northern portions of
the lower Mississippi Valley and Missouri across much of the Ohio
Valley and central Appalachians to New York. A band of freezing
drizzle was to extend from south central Texas across northern
Mississippi into middle Tennessee. Rain was expected over the
central Gulf Coast region, Alabama and the southern and middle
Atlantic Coast states.
   High temperatures were to be in the single digits over eastern
North Dakota, northwest Minnesota and much of the central
Intermountain region; in the teens and 20s over much of the northern
Intermountain region, the northern and central Rockies, the northern
and central Plains, the northern half of the southern Plains, much
of the upper and middle Mississippi Valley, Arkansas, the Great
Lakes and northern New England; in the 50s over coastal sections of
southern California and southern Arizona; from the 50s to the 70s
over southeast Alabama, northwest Florida, Georgia and South
Carolina; and in the 80s over much of the Florida peninsula. Much of
the remainder of the nation was to have high temperatures in the 30s
and 40s.

<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration on Monday
formally approved the expanded use of an aerosol version of the drug
pentamidine to fight a life-threatening pneumonia that strikes AIDS
patients.
   Under the new rules, the FDA has approved the experimental use of
aerosol pentamidine for AIDS patients who have had at least one
episode of penumocystic carinii pneumonia, or who have white blood
cell counts that are at or below 200 per cubic millimeter.
   The FDA action recommends the use of aerosol pentamidine every
four weeks as a preventive measure against the AIDS-related
pneumonia. The injectable form of the drug was approved in 1984 for
patients who already had the pneumonia.
   FDA approval came after a San Francisco study showed that using
aerosol pentamidine lowered the incidence of the pneumonia among
AIDS patients.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that renders the body unable to resist other diseases and
infections. It is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV.
   A white blood cell called T4 helper is the primary immune cell
attacked by HIV. Most healthy people have T4 helper cell counts of
1,000 per cubic millimeter.
   Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia is the most common infection that
kills AIDS patients.

   Thousands of ethnic Albanians left
work Monday in Kosovo province to protest alleged anti-Albanian
policies in some parts of Yugoslavia, according to reports by the
official news agency and other sources.
   The strikes, and rallies that appeared to defy a ban on mass
gatherings in Kosovo, followed weekend protests by more than 1,500
employees of the Trepca lead-zinc mine near Titova Mitrovica in the
southern province.
   Ethnic Albanians are 85 percent of the people in southern
province, which adjoins Albania. The Trepca miners held a meeting to
protest what they describe as growing anti-Albanian sentiment fed by
official media in Serbia, the nation's largest republic.
   Kosovo is an autonomous province within Serbia, which says it
needs more control over the Albanian-dominated region to protect its
Slavic minority.
   Up to 100,000 ethnic Albanians demonstrated in Pristina, capital
of Kosovo, in November against the dismissal of some top provincial
officials as demanded by Serbia's leaders.
   After five days of the largest rallies in Kosovo's history,
police put an indefinite ban on mass gatherings.
   Informed sources in Pristina said the protests Monday involved at
least 3,000 ethnic Albanian employees in about 15 factories and
mines.
   Yugoslavia's official news agency, Tanjug, said protesters
denounced Serbian allegations that ethnic Albanians are separatists
whose ultimate goal is making Kosovo part of Albania.
   They also protested the dismissal of Azem Vlasi, an ethnic
Albanian, from the policy-making Central Committee of the national
Communist Party, Tanjug reported.

   The nation's largest organization of lawyers went
on record Monday in favor of legislation to bar discrimination
against homosexuals.
   The American Bar Association, which twice before rejected similar
proposals, endorsed a resolution supporting federal, state and local
legislation ``prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation in employment, housing and public accommodations.''
   The ABA's House of Delegates, the policy-making body for the
350,000-member lawyers' organization, voted 251-121 to adopt the
resolution.
   Members said the action will have important symbolic and
practical impact in influencing lawmakers to adopt gay-right
measures.
   The House of Delegates also approved, by voice vote, a proposal
calling for increased federal regulation of the insurance industry.
   The proposal urges passage of federal legislation repealing the
antitrust exemption the insurance industry was granted by Congress
in 1945.
   The ABA resolution is a response to the so-called liability
crisis in which lawyers and insurance companies have blamed each
other for the skyrocketing costs of liability insurance.
   Proponents of the gay-rights resolution noted that many states
and cities already have legislation to protect the rights of
homosexuals.
   Many states and cities already have legislation to protect the
rights of homosexuals.
   Laws banning discrimination in public employment based on sexual
orientation have been adopted by California, Illinois, Maryland,
Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington state. Many cities have
enacted more sweeping protection.
   In a debate that was at times emotional, proponents of the
gay-rights measure said the ABA is behind the times in speaking out
in behalf of homosexual rights.
   ``It's a question of basic human rights,'' said Alexander Forger,
a lawyer from New York City. ``What we do here today is simply make
a statement in favor of decency and human rights, a compassionate
voice for social justice.''
   But opponents of the resolution said the ABA is taking sides with
``perversion'' and the corruption of children.
   The ABA is ``encouraging a federal statute that will invade the
rights of every American,'' said Augustine Smythe of Charleston, S.C.
   ``We shouldn't ram it down people's throats with a federal
statute,'' he said.
   Joe Stamper of Antlers, Okla., said the resolution endorses
homosexual conduct. ``A majority of Americans looks with distaste on
perversity that violates our religious precepts,'' he said.
   The ABA's House of Delegates rejected a similar proposal by nine
votes in 1985 and by 24 votes in 1983. In 1987, the group approved a
resolution condemning crimes of violence based on prejudice against
the victim's race, religion, sexual orientation or minority status.
Supporters of the gay-rights proposal emphasized that homosexuality
is not a matter of choice for most.
   They also said there is no scientific evidence to show
homosexuals are more likely than heterosexuals to molest children.
   Alice Richmond of Boston said, ``It's important to me to separate
out conduct that would be offensive, whether by heterosexuals or
homosexuals.'' She said that when she was in the sixth grade she
succeeded in getting a male teacher fired for making sexual advances
to her. Endorsing equal treatment for homosexuals does not mean
condoning conduct that would be offensive or illegal, she said.
   Earlier Monday, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist called for
measures to limit the time in which death row inmates may challenge
in federal court their convictions and death sentences.
   Rehnquist said such a limit should be combined with expanded
legal help for those accused of capital crimes to ensure that
constitutional challenges to death penalty sentences are handled
more efficiently.

<HEAD>Nicaragua Proposes Joint U.S.-Central American Drug Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   UNITED NATIONS - Nicaragua's foreign minister on Monday proposed
a joint U.S.-Central American campaign to wipe out the ``diabolical
scourge'' of drug trafficking in the region.
   Miguel d'Escoto met reporters after talking to Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar about a proposed international military
observer force to police the Central American peace plan.
   D'Escoto is leading a meeting Wednesday and Thursday of foreign
ministers of Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, Guatemala and El
Salvador, which signed the 1987 peace plan.
   ``We will be proposing an agreement between the Central American
republics and the United States on the elimination of illegal drug
trafficking,'' said d'Escoto.
   ``This is a scourge on the world; we were very, very happy to see
the priority that President Bush gave to this issue in his inaugural
address,'' he said.
   The United States backs the rebels seeking to overthrow the
leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua. But the Nicaraguan
government has spoken in favor of improving relations with the
United States since the change in U.S. administrations last month.
   D'Escoto said Nicaragua is volunteering to draft an agreement
that would be submitted to the other Central American countries and
the United States, followed by a meeting of those involved in
Managua.
   D'Escoto would not provide other details of the proposal and
declined to say whether Nicaragua would be prepared to share
intelligence data or coast guard duties with the United States.
   ``We would be proposing to go as far as we should go in order to
really stamp out this diabolical sourge to humanity,'' he said.
   Panama, which is ruled by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noreiga, is
considered part of South America, not Central America.
   Noreiga has been charged with drug trafficking in U.S. federal
courts, but says the charges are false and are an attempt to lay the
groundwork for abrogating the treaty under which control of the
Panama Canal will pass from the United States to Panama.
   Nicaragua has defended Noriega, saying he is a victim of U.S.
persecution intended to undermine Panama's sovereignty.
   The Central American foreign ministers are meeting in New York to
set the agenda for a summit meeting of their five presidents Feb.
13-14 in El Salvador to try to revive the peace plan.
   The peace initiative, which calls for democratic reforms in
Central American countries, has stalled over the lack of full
compliance by its signers.

<HEAD>Marcos Still Critical But Improving</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exiled Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
remained in critical but stable condition Monday, after marked
improvement over the weekend, according to a hospital spokeswoman.
   The 71-year-old Marcos recognized family and friends and was able
to respond to simple commands, such as to raise his right hand, said
St. Francis Medical Center spokeswoman Norma Kop.
   Marcos remained in the intensive care unit attached to a
respirator to regulate his breathing, Kop said.
   ``He's still in critical, but he's showing signs of
improvement,'' she said. ``He's more alert.''
   Marcos has been hospitalized since Jan. 15 with pneumonia and
bronchial asthma. While in the hospital, he suffered a collapsed
lung, which was reinflated, and underwent a tracheotomy to relieve
the buildup of fluids in his lungs.
   Along with his wife, Imelda, Marcos was indicted last October on
federal racketeering charges accusing him of plundering his
homeland's economy and stashing much of the money in the United
States. A hearing this week in New York to decide whether he is
healthy enough to stand trial has been postponed until March 6.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Debra Livingston confirmed that the
hearing before U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan, had been put off
at the defense' request.
   Ms. Livingston would not comment on why the defense had sought a
delay, saying it was not on the public record.
   Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent to the charges and is free on $5
million bail.
   Philippine Vice President Salvador Laurel visited Marcos on
Thursday in the hospital and said Marcos should be forgiven and
allowed to die in his homeland, where he ruled for 20 years.
   Philippine President Corazon Aquino has refused to meet with
Laurel and receive a message from Marcos.
   ``It is not a matter of me not wanting to talk to him, but I feel
since he says this is a matter of great import to the Filipino
people, I think he should inform the people directly instead of with
me because people might have the wrong impressions that we are
keeping something from them,'' Mrs. Aquino said Monday in Manila.
   Marcos was ousted in a February 1986 civilian-military revolt and
has lived in Hawaiian exile since, with Mrs. Aquino forbidding his
return.

<HEAD>Johnny Paycheck's Sentence Confirmed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HILLSBORO, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Country singer Johnny Paycheck, after
pleading to a judge for mercy, was taken to jail Monday to begin
serving a 7-to-9{-year sentence for his conviction in a 1985 tavern
shooting.
   It was Paycheck's second sentencing in the case and was the same
term he received at the original May 1986 sentencing.
   Paycheck, 50, a native of nearby Greenfield, pleaded for
leniency, saying he needs to earn money in concerts because his wife
has cancer, they have no health insurance and he is paying cash for
her medical treatments.
   ``If I'm taken away, my wife will be dead in six months,''
Paycheck told Judge Darrell Hottle in Highland County Common Pleas
Court in southwest Ohio.
   But Hottle, after hearing testimony from Paycheck and four
character witnesses, gave Paycheck the same term that he ordered in
1986. The 4th Ohio District Court of Appeals ordered the
resentencing hearing, saying Paycheck should be given a chance to
present testimony that might persuade the judge to shorten the
sentence.
   Paycheck, whose real name is Donnie Lytle, was convicted of
aggravated assault, tampering with evidence _ for discarding the
handgun he used _ and use of a firearm during a felony.
   Paycheck was handcuffed after his sentencing and taken to a
Hillsboro-area jail to await his transfer later this week to a state
prison.
   Tennessee songwriter Kenneth McDuffy, testifying Monday for
Paycheck, said he had known Paycheck since 1963 and described him as
a humanitarian. McDuffy and fellow witness Billy Burns, a
publisher-producer, said Paycheck was involved in producing a gospel
album to raise money for the fight against AIDS.
   Paycheck, who now lives in Cadiz, Ky., had been free on $50,000
bond. The singer is best known for his 1978 hit, ``Take This Job and
Shove It.''

<HEAD>Manley Says U.S. Relations Take Precedence Over Cuba</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Socialist Michael Manley, expected to
defeat conservative Prime Minister Edward Seaga in this week's
election, said Monday he would restore diplomatic relations with
Cuba but give higher priority to U.S. ties.
   Manley said he wants a ``new beginning'' with the United States
and and would visit Washington before restoring ties with Fidel
Castro's communist government.
   The 64-year-old former prime minister, in an interview at his
Kingston home with seven foreign correspondents, said he saw clear
opportunities for cooperation with the United States, including
cracking down on drug trafficking through Jamaica.
   An opinion poll published Sunday put Manley's left-leaning
People's National Party 14 points ahead of Seaga's center-right
Jamaica Labor Party, 57 percent to 43 percent.
   Thursday's voting will be the first nationally contested election
since 1980, when 700 people were killed in politically related
violence during a nine-month campaign. At least eight people have
been killed and scores injured in political attacks since this
campaign opened Jan. 15.
   Police said eight people were wounded in three separate shootings
Sunday night in and near Kingston, the capital. Six people were
attacked leaving a political meeting. Two others, a 22-ear-old man
and a 15-year-old boy, were hit by shots fired from passing buses
carrying political supporters.
   Nevertheless, the violence has not been anywhere near as intense
or widespread as it was in 1980.
   Manley's party boycotted the last election, in 1983, in a dispute
over voter registration lists. At the time, Seaga, one of the Reagan
administration's closest allies in the Caribbean, was riding a wave
of popularity following his outspoken support of the 1983 U.S.
invasion of Grenada. The boycott left Seaga's party with all 60
seats in Parliament.
   Manley, who was prime minister for eight years during the 1970s,
said he was confident of winning at least 40 parliamentary seats to
Seaga's 20.
   Manley reiterated his pledge to restore diplomatic relations with
neighboring Cuba, but he said he would not bring back droves of
Cuban doctors and builders, as he did in the 1970s.
   Manley's close ties with Cuba alienated the United States and
foreign investors, leading to economic decline. Seaga broke
relations with Cuba shortly after taking office for the first time
in 1980.
   Asked about his image as a radical-turned-moderate, Manley
rejected the notion he espoused far-left views.
   ``I never was what you call a hard-line socialist,'' said Manley,
who is vice president of the influential movement Socialist
International. ``I've always belonged to that broad family of social
democracy.
   ``What I really am, if you want to know, is a hard-line
democrat,'' he continued. ``But not Democrat vs. Republican.
Democrat in the sense that I really believe, my abiding commitment,
is to the democratic process.''

<HEAD>Nicaragua Devalues Currency For Third Time This Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leftist Sandinista government
devalued the currency and raised prices for petroleum products on
Monday for the third time this year.
   The devaluation of the cordoba is part of economic measures
designed to contain hyperinflation, which reached 20,000 percent in
1988.
   The official rate of exchange for the cordoba went from 2,300 to
the U.S. dollar to 2,700.
   The cordoba was devalued Jan. 4 from 920 to 2,000 per dollar at
the official rate of exchange, and then from 2,000 to the dollar to
2,300 Jan. 25.
   The dollar continued trading at 5,200 cordobas on the black
market and 4,500 cordobas in the so-called parallel market. The
government-authorized parallel market complements the official one
and serves to provide dollars for non-essential imports.
   As the cordoba is devalued, prices for petroleum products have
been rising proportionately. Nicaragua has no petroleum resources of
its own and must import all its crude oil, mostly from Soviet bloc
countries.
   Diesel fuel went from 3,500 cordobas a gallon to 4,100 a gallon
after Monday's devaluation; and gasoline rose from 4,800 cordobas a
gallon to 5,600.
   Meanwhile, the official Sandinista newspaper Barricada quoted
Finance Minister William Hupper as saying tax laws will be applied
rigorously this year and tax evaders will be prosecuted.
   President Daniel Ortega on Jan. 30 announced his government's
1989 economic plan, which included budget cuts of more than 40
percent and the laying off of at least 30,000 government workers.
   Opposition leaders and private businessmen say these measures
will not be effective unless the government works out a political
accord with them.
   Nicaragua's economy has been hurt by eight years of war with the
U.S.-backed Contra rebels, a U.S. trade embargo in force since 1985,
and Hurricane Joan, which struck this Central American country last
October and inflicted heavy damage on agriculture.
   The Sandinistas and the Contras signed a temporary cease-fire in
March 1988, which the government has been extending on a
month-by-month basis. The U.S. Congress stopped military aid to the
Contras in February 1988.

<HEAD>Freight Workers Make A Killing On Stock Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employees of the National Freight Consortium who
bought stock in their company in 1982 for about 4 cents a share saw
their fortunes soar Monday when it began trading on the London stock
exchange at 100 times that price.
   News reports said one mechanic, who was not identified, had $3.8
million worth of stock at Monday's prices.
   About 10,000 typists, truck drivers and managers bought into the
struggling freight transport giant when the government sold it off
in an early privatization seven years ago.
   In 1982, the workers ignored union advice, skeptical financial
experts and a severe recession in road transport to raise $92.5
million to buy their firm. Some emptied their savings accounts,
mortgaged their homes, or borrowed the money.
   Year after year of expansion and success followed, and on Monday
their shares sold for a closing price of $4.32 a share.
   At the closing price, the company once known as the lame-duck
road transport arm of British Railways was valued at $1.38 billion.
   Previously the company's shares _ all but 17 percent held by
staff, workers, retired workers and relatives _ have been traded on
an internal market. It was that ``private exchange'' that set
Monday's starting price of $3.20.
   Before the flotation the shares were standing at $3.20, but with
most of the workers refusing to sell, demand for the new stock sent
the price shooting up.
   Only a few of the investors, including the mystery mechanic and
chairman Sir Peter Thompson, will be millionaires.
   Four hundred other workers are believed to hold stock that rose
to be worth at least $432,500 during the years since the
privatization.
   On Monday's bumper profits, their stock is now worth $583,875.

   An American Airlines
Airbus A-300 passenger jet ran off the runway Monday just before
taking off from the U.S. Virgin Islands, an airport official said.
No injuries were reported.
   ``The nose wheels ran off the runway ... while taxiing out,''
said Virgin Islands Port Authority spokeswoman Winnifred Neiblum.
   It was not immediately known why the plane ran off the runway at
St. Thomas' Cyril E. King Airport.
   In a telephone interview from American Airlines's headquarters in
Fort Worth, Texas, spokesman Dave Tracy said 167 passengers were
aboard the plane, which was stopping at St. Croix before its final
destination to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport.
   ``The passengers were accommodated on other aircraft,'' said
Tracy, adding the plane was taken out of service after the incident.
   Neiblum said all passengers were evacuated from the plane, which
she said went off the western end of the runway, not far from the
ocean.
   However, air traffic controller Susan Ganley said the plane was
never near the water. She said it looked like a malfunction caused
it to go off course.
   ``He (the pilot) applied power and the plane did not go straight.
The nose wheel went off to the side,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Banks and foreign exchange houses
were ordered closed Monday as the government grappled with how to
lower interest rates while keeping the currency stable.
   The Economy Ministry ordered the closings late Sunday night after
a week in which the austral fell to 17.59 to the dollar on the open
market, monthly interest rates to 17 percent or more, and the
Central Bank lost nearly $500 million in foreign exchange.
   The government ordered a 2.5 percent devaluation in the official
value of the austral, to 14.41 australs to the dollar, effective
Tuesday, when the banks and foreign exchanges were scheduled to
reopen.
   Also beginning Tuesday, the Central Bank _ which has spent at
least $1 billion in recent months in an effort to hold down the
dollar _ no longer will make dollars available on the free market.
   The former commercial rate, which was higher and at which the
government used to sell dollars and make a profit, will be replaced
by a ``special'' rate equal to the official rate plus 25 percent _
i.e., 18.01 australs per dollar beginning Tuesday.
   The free rate will be whatever the market will bear. The Central
Bank no longer with try to keep the ``black market'' value of the
dollar within 20 percent of the official value.
   The problem, as always, is inflation, which was an unexpectedly
high 8.9 percent in January, a rise from December's 6.8 percent and
November's 5.7 percent, and an indication that despite strenuous
efforts the government is losing control.
   In August, President Raul Alfonsin implemented a program of
voluntary wage and price controls, budget cuts and regular
mini-devaluations in the austral.
   To persuade Argentines not to trade their money for dollars,
which deprives the banking system of funds and drives up interest
rates, the Central Bank made plenty of dollars available. Interest
rates were kept attractively high though well below levels of last
July and August.
   Through November the plan seemed to work. Inflation and monthly
interest rates both returned to single digits, the dollar rose
modestly and, of crucial importance, Argentines' purchasing power
recovered from the months when it lagged behind inflation. National
elections are set for May 14.
   Critics said any improvement was illusory because it was obvious
the dollar was undervalued, and as soon as that was common
knowledge, speculators would buy dollars in anticipation of profits.
   One indication that was near was Argentines' huge rush to buy
airline tickets, figuring that as they were denominated in dollars,
they could be bought at a substantial discount.
   By the government's tallies, the austral lost 42 percent of its
value since September, while the dollar rose by only about 27
percent.
   Middle-class Argentines who ordinarily might have vacationed at
the Atlantic coastal resort Mar del Plata 250 miles south of Buenos
Aires decided to vacation in Brazil. Tickets to Cuba also were
particularly cheap and popular.

   A man accused of killing 14 relatives in
a Christmastime rampage went on trial Monday for the slayings, even
though he has said he is ready to die for his convictions of two
other murders.
   Two of the 89 potential jurors were excused during preliminary
questioning Monday. After that, individual questioning began to
select a panel for the trial of R. Gene Simmons.
   Earlier Monday, Circuit Court Judge John S. Patterson denied a
motion to let the jury decide whether the deaths of Simmons'
relatives were part of the same criminal episode in which two people
were killed in Russellville on Dec. 28, 1987. Simmons, 48, was
convicted May 12 for those slayings and sentenced to death. He told
Patterson he was ready to die and did not want his sentence appealed.
   Eight prospective jurors were excused by Patterson; four said
they thought Simmons was guilty. One of those excused, Robert E.
Humphrey, said: ``I think he ought to get 30 days in the electric
chair. And the do-gooders who intervened last time when he asked to
be executed ought to have to hold his hand.''
   Four jurors were selected Monday.
   The state indicated it would call 20 witnesses in the current
trial. The defense indicated it would call three.
   Simmons' first trial was moved to Ozark because of publicity in
Russellville, and the second trial was moved to Clarksville for the
same reason. Patterson addressed that issue when he asked the
potential jurors, ``Is there anybody who has not heard anything
about this case?''
   Nobody raised their hand.
   Patterson told the jury that he realized that ``the court cannot
make you just wipe things out of your mind and forget it,'' but that
verdicts must be based upon a higher quality of evidence than what
is sometimes reported by the media.
   The new trial is for the shooting and strangulation deaths of
Simmons' wife, Becky, 46; their seven children; two of the
children's spouses; and four of Simmons' grandchildren, one of whom
relatives say he fathered by incest with one of his daughters.
   Patterson also presided over Simmons' earlier trial.
   Simmons surrendered after the shooting spree that left two people
dead and authorities then went to his home 14 miles north of
Russellville. They found five bodies. The next day, they discovered
seven bodies in a grave and found the bodies of two babies in the
trunks of cars.
   Prosecutor John Bynum said he would ask for the death penalty.
The jury could give Simmons life imprisonment without parole.

   A Mardi Gras tourist who told robbers he had
no money was fatally shot Monday about two blocks from a parade
route, police said.
   The victim, Randy Robichaux, 37, of Baton Rouge, was an employee
at Louisiana State University who came to New Orleans to see the
Bacchus parade Sunday night, police said.
   The shooting occured the day before Mardi Gras, the culmination
of pre-Lenten festivities. The city's Carnival parades began two
weeks ago.
   A companion told police that he and Robichaux were about two
blocks from the parade route about 1 a.m. when three men in a car
drove up and repeatedly demanded money. The parade had been over for
a couple of hours.
   When Robichaux said he had no money, one of the men got out and
shot him in the chest, according to police. Robichaux died later at
a hospital.
   Robichaux was in charge of running four dormitories at the
university; co-workers said he also made the campus Mardi Gras
parade into a major event.
   Police said the city's central business district is heavily
patrolled during Carnival, but that many people put themselves in
danger by parking in remote parts of the area and walking back to
their cars in the early hours.
   But police said shootings during attempted robberies are highly
unusual at Mardi Gras.
   The shooting was not the only weekend violence connected with
Carnival.
   Two float riders suffered minor injuries when they were hit by
objects thrown at them, police spokeswoman Yvonne Bechet said.
   A third person, Richard Rowell, 24, of Kenner, was injured when
he fell about 12 feet from the float he was on. He was in
satisfactory condition at Tulane Medical Center, Bechet said.
   A month of parades and balls comes to an end at midnight on Mardi
Gras, or Fat Tuesday, when Carnival season ends and Lent brings six
weeks of repentance to this predominantly Catholic city.
   About 1.5 million to 1.7 million people are expected to be in New
Orleans' streets Tuesday for the celebration.

<HEAD>Police Arrest Opposition Leader Who Called for Nationwide Strike</HEAD>

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Police on Monday arrested one of
three opposition leaders who called for a 48-hour general strike to
protest the rule of Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.
   Rockefeller Guerre, leader of the small Union of Democratic
Patriots party, was arrested at his home in the northern suburb of
Delmas and taken to police headquarters in Port-au-Prince, said his
wife, Huguette Guerre.
   ``They said that this act was part of a round-up, that my husband
was not the only one concerned,'' Mrs. Guerre told The Associated
Press.
   Independent station Radio Metropole said police confirmed the
arrest.
   Police did not say how long he would be held or why he was
arrested.
   Guerre and opposition leaders Sylvio Claude and Louis Dejoie in a
joint statement Friday called for a general strike Wednesday and
Thursday which they said ``will have the force of a referendum
against Avril.''
   The three said they would boycott Avril's ``democratic forum'' on
Thursday in which government and political leaders are to discuss
the powers of an electoral board that is to supervise future
elections.
   They say Haiti's constitution already provides for an
independently appointed Electoral Council with total control over
elections.
   ``The Avril government is in the process of establishing a
dictatorship. It intends to arrest all leaders who are opposed to
his regime,'' Claude said after hearing of Guerre's arrest.
   Conservative politician Hubert de Ronceray and the Autonomous
Central of Haitian Workers, the largest union, announced their
support for the strike. The union has called two successful strikes
in the last three months.
   ``The arrest (of Guerre) is outrageous and is an indication of
Avril's Duvalierist commitmen,'' Dejoie said in a telephone
interview from his home in Puerto Rico.
   Avril came to power in a Sept. 17 coup by rank-and-file soldiers
who ousted former ruler Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, demanding a return to
democratic rule. Namphy came to power in 1986 when former dictator
Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to France.

<HEAD>Sentencing Hearing Begins For 25 Blacks Convicted Of Murder</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UPINGTON, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sentencing hearing began Monday
for 25 blacks who could face the death penalty for their alleged
complicity in the mob killing of a policeman.
   The so-called Upington 25 are believed to be the largest group
ever convicted in a South African murder trial.
   Their case is similar to that of the ``Sharpeville Six,'' a group
of blacks reprieved from the gallows last year by President P.W.
Botha following a storm of international protest.
   In both instances, the prosecution was unable to show that most
of the defendants physically contributed to the killing. However,
the judges found the defendants guilty under the doctrine of common
purpose, which holds them responsible because they were part of a
crowd that intended to kill the victim.
   The Upington 25 were convicted of murder last year for the Nov.
13, 1985, killing of a black policeman, Lucas Sethwala, who was
assaulted and set alight by members of the mob after they chased him
from his house.
   Evidence presented at the trial identified four of the 25 as the
men primarily responsible for the assault that killed Sethwala.
Judge J.J. Basson convicted the remaining 21 because he said they
shared the same intent.
   The group began attacking Sethwala and his house after police
broke up a rally protesting a rent increase and other grievances.
Black activists have attacked hundreds of black policemen in recent
years, saying they are collaborators with the white-led government.
   The Upington 25 have received scant publicity because the town is
located in the isolated northwestern part of South Africa.
   However, when the sentencing hearing began Monday morning the
packed courthouse included both South African and foreign
journalists. It was not immediately clear how many days the hearing
would last.
   During the hearing, defense lawyers will call expert witnesses to
argue that the judge should not impose the death sentence because of
extenuating social and political factors.
   The Upington 25 range in age from 21 to 64 and include three
women. All are from Paballello, a black township on the edge of
Upington.
   The Sharpeville Six, five men and a woman, are serving prison
terms ranging from 18 years to 25 years, which were imposed when
Botha commuted their death sentences.
   Botha has never explained his decision to intervene, although
most observers said the extensive international pressure persuaded
him to block the executions.

<TEXT>
   A son-in-law of the late Hubert H.
Humphrey was sentenced Monday to nearly four years in prison and
ordered to pay more than $600,000 restitution to insurance companies.
   ``I just want to express to my family and friends my sincere
apologies for all the pain and suffering I have caused them,'' C.
Bruce Solomonson told U.S. District Court Judge Edward Devitt before
sentencing.
   ``I'm an honest man, a loyal man and I never intended to cause
harm to them. I plead for leniency in this matter,'' Solomonson said.
   Defense attorney Joe Walters of Minneapolis added, ``Words cannot
express the full extent of his sorrow to his mother-in-law and the
Humphrey family.''
   Devitt ordered Solomonson to pay $616,761 to seven insurance
companies and sentenced him to 46 months in jail. Solomonson is to
start his sentence March 6.
   Assistant U.S. District Attorney Henry Shea asked for a stiff
sentence, but gave no specifics.
   Solomonson, 47, was convicted in December for diverting $1.5
million from his two insurance agencies for personal use. The jury
found that he altered company books to hide the illegal transactions.
   Neither Solomonson nor members of his family would comment after
the sentencing.

<HEAD>Annual Tibetan Religious Ceremony Canceled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have canceled the Great Prayer
Festival, a sacred annual event in Tibet that last year was the
scene of anti-Chinese violence that claimed more than 20 lives.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Monday the festival in the
Tibetan capital of Lhasa was canceled by the Tibet branch of the
Buddhist Association of China and other Buddhist organizations.
   The decision was made after ``taking into consideration the
opinions of the majority of lamas,'' Xinhua said. It said related
religious activities could be conducted in monasteries.
   The festival, which begins the eighth day of the first month of
the Tibetan calendar, usually takes place in February and March.
   The Xinhua report did not say whether the riots last March were
responsible for the decision to cancel this year's festival.
   It also did not mention whether the Jan. 28 death of the Panchen
Lama, Tibetan Buddhism's second-most revered man after the exiled
Dalai Lama, was related to the cancellation.
   On March 5, the final day of the 10-day event, Buddhist monks
broke up the ceremonies by shouting anti-Chinese, pro-independence
slogans, starting riots that led to an estimated 24 deaths.
   Chinese authorities said one policeman was killed in the riots.
Twenty-five rioters were given prison terms.
   Chinese authorities hailed the opening of last year's festival as
an example of how religious freedom is now protected in China and as
a sign that Lhasa had returned to normal following riots the
previous September and October.
   The Great Prayer Festival, which dates back to 1409, was halted
by the communists in 1960, a year after a failed uprising drove the
Dalai Lama into exile, and not held again until 1986.

   Anti-government rebels ambushed a train
near Mozambique's border with South Africa, killing 11 people and
wounding 16, the national news agency reported Monday.
   The attack occurred Sunday afternoon near Movene, about nine
miles from the South African border and 33 miles northwest of the
capital of Maputo, the AIM news agency reported.
   AIM quoted one survivor as saying that the attackers opened fire
with bazookas and light arms. The passengers were mostly women,
children and some Mozambican miners who work in South Africa, one
passenger told AIM.
   Rebels of Mozambique National Resistance have been fighting since
1977 in a bid to undermine the country's Marxist government.
   No government acknowledges supporting the rebels, but their
hit-and-run attacks on both civilian and military targets have
seriously disrupted the economy and is the main cause of a
nationwide food shortage.

   Up to 7 feet of snow surprised New Mexico ski area owners Monday
and closed roads, while the spread of the arctic cold wave turned
highways into dangerous skating rinks with snow and freezing rain
from the deep South to the Northeast.
   A week after the arctic air that stunned Alaska crossed Canada
into the Lower 48, thermometers dropped to 49 degrees below zero at
Craig, Colo., with an unofficial minus 52 at nearby Hayden, Colo.,
and San Francisco hit a low of 31 degrees, lowest for February since
record-keeping began in 1872.
   Icy roads caused accidents and slowed commuters from Texas and
Mississippi to Kentucky and Pennsylvania to metropolitan New York
City.
   At least 56 deaths have been blamed on the weather since Jan. 31,
most of them in traffic accidents or from hypothermia. In Austin,
Texas, a paraplegic found dead Sunday apparently had gotten out of
his car and into a wheelchair, which then slid down an icy ramp the
man was unable to climb, police said.
   In Garden City, Kan., a couple and two of their children died
Monday in an early-morning mobile home fire that started when an
electric blanket wrapped around water pipes ignited the underside of
the trailer, authorities said.
   Thirty-three cities posted record low temperatures Monday,
according to the National Weather Service. Ely, Nev., dropped to 30
below zero, its coldest on record for any date.
   Other all-time records were 47 below zero at Roosevelt, Utah,
erasing the previous record of 32 below, and 33 below at Richfield,
Utah.
   Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus declared eastern Clark County a weather
disaster area as ranchers fought to rescue thousands of cattle and
sheep buried in snow drifts.
   The Civil Air Patrol discovered Al Laird's herd of 980 sheep
buried in drifts as deep as 15 feet. Laird's wife, Pearl, said the
family may be able to save 150 of them.
   Four-wheel-drive vehicles were used Monday to rescue more than 20
people from a hilltop country club near Austin, Texas, where they
had been stranded since Saturday by icy roads. Humane Society
members had gone to the Barton Creek Country Club on Saturday for a
fundraiser, said Michele Kaufman, chairwoman of the event.
   ``We had a great time and raised a lot of money,'' Ms. Kaufman
said.
   Stuck at the country club with them was an owl, a falcon, a
turtle weighing several hundred pounds and Peter Gros of ``Mutual of
Omaha's Wild Kingdom.''
   Freezing rain was reported early Monday across the Eastern
seaboard and south and west across Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee,
Mississippi and into the Texas Gulf Coast and central Texas.
Baltimore police were told to respond only to emergency calls
because even their cars were sliding into curbs and posts.
   Northern and central Mississippi had power outages, downed trees
and mounting traffic accidents, and ice closed major bridges and
fallen trees blocked some secondary roads.
   ``We've got a solid sheet of ice, and there's little chance of
relief,'' said John Prather, a spokesman for the Mississippi Highway
Patrol office at Batesville.
   Schools and numerous businesses were closed as far south as the
Jackson area of central Mississippi by icy roads and power outages.
   Heavy snow closed parts of highways Monday in northern and
central New Mexico, caused scattered power outages and closed
schools in more than a dozen towns.
   ``I don't think we've ever had a bigger storm,'' said Judy
Miller, owner of the Enchanted Forest Cross Country Ski Area at Red
River, which got 2 feet of snow. ``This is the first time in 25
years that we've had to close our ski area down because of the
weather.''
   The Red River ski area in northern New Mexico got 7 feet of snow
over the weekend, mostly on Sunday, and the nearby Angel Fire resort
got 6 feet, according to the Ski New Mexico agency.
   On Sunday, wind estimated at 80 mph blew railroad cars off tracks
near Abo, N.M., west of Mountainair, said Santa Fe Railway
superintendent John Ish. No injuries were reported, Ish said.
   About 20 school districts in northern Texas were closed Monday
after the Lone Star Gas Co. enacted emergency natural gas
conservation measures to ensure sufficient supplies for home and
business heat.
   Natural gas problems also affected Las Vegas. The record-tying
low of 19 degrees at Las Vegas coincided with a malfunction in a
compressor station, and Southwest Gas Co. officials issued an urgent
plea Monday for people to cut back on gas use or to expect forced
reductions. It also cut off service to some large industrial
customers; large hotels were expected to switch to auxiliary fuel
such as oil.
   More than 6 inches of snow fell on much of Illinois, providing
some encouragement for farmers who feared the shortage of winter
moisture was a harbinger of another drought.
   ``The farmers are looking for this _ this is like money in the
bank for them,'' said meteorologist Frank Wachowski of the National
Weather Service.
   But the snowfall also caused headaches for Chicago's Street and
Sanitation Department after 200 backup workers didn't respond to
messages left on answering machines or with relatives over the
weekend. Officials made plans to discipline the workers.
   Major city school districts in Oregon opened their doors Monday
for the first time since Tuesday as temperatures moderated, but the
warming trend was potentially bad news for boat owners.
   Deputy Dennis Stewart of the Multnomah County sheriff's office
River Patrol said pleasure boats and houseboats on the Columbia and
Willamette rivers ``are all frozen in now, but they will sink when
it thaws.''

   All 33 foreigners on trial for refusing to be
fingerprinted under Japan's Alien Registration Law said Monday they
will reject a planned amnesty marking Emperor Hirohito's funeral.
   The 30 Koreans, two Americans and one Chinese said the amnesty
would leave them unable to challenge the controversial law in court.
   The law's opponents say it violates the human rights of Japan's
approximately 870,000 foreign residents by requiring them to be
fingerprinted and carry an alien registration card at all times.
   ``The government has declared an amnesty that will in the name of
the late emperor dismiss our court cases and nullify all attempts at
legal redress,'' the group said in a statement. ``Not only is the
government denying us due process _ the right to a fair trial and
the right to appeal _ it is also trying to silence us, hide the past
and distort history.''
   Many of Japan's foreign residents are Koreans or Chinese whose
parents or grandparents were brought forcibly to Japan as laborers
while their countries were controlled by Japan before and during
World War II.
   Foreigners born in Japan do not automatically receive Japanese
citizenship and often face discrimination in schools, housing,
marriage and employment.
   Government officials say they plan to pardon about 30,000 people
for minor criminal offenses, including violations of the Alien
Registration Law, to commemorate Emperor Hirohito's funeral on Feb.
24.
   ``The court is one of the few places where Koreans and Chinese
can challenge the law,'' said Robert Ricketts of Scottsdale, Ariz.,
one of the Americans in the group. ``When I was found guilty of
violating the law, I was told I have the right to appeal, but now
I'm told I don't have that right. ... It's an attempt by the
government to get rid of these trials, which have attracted a lot of
attention in Japan and overseas.''
   In its statement, the group charged that militarists used
Hirohito and the emperor system to rally national support for
colonizing neighboring countries and killing millions of people in
World War II.
   ``We are challenging not only the alien registration system
itself, but also the imperial ideology that undergirds it and that
continues to legitimize and perpetuate ethnic discrimination and
oppression in postwar Japan,'' the group said.
   Conviction under the law carries a penalty of up to a year in
prison and a $1,500 fine.

<HEAD>Japanese Officials Hope For Co-production Despite Congressional Concerns</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Japanese officials discounted U.S. congressional
concerns Monday and said they hope to proceed with co-production of
a jet fighter by General Dynamics and the Japanese company that
built the famous Zero during World War II.
   Some U.S. senators say the project will mean giving away U.S.
high technology that might allow Japan to compete against the
American aerospace industry. U.S. officials pushed for last year's
co-production agreement to offset Japan's trade surplus.
   ``The two sides spent a long time working on the agreement, and I
believe it's a good agreement,'' a Foreign Ministry official said on
condition of anonymity. ``I hope we can proceed with development as
scheduled.''
   During Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's visit last week to
Washington, five U.S. senators urged President Bush to review the
agreement to use the U.S. F-16 built by General Dynamics as the
basis of Japan's future mainstay fighter jet, called the FSX.
   Japanese officials said Japan originally planned to develop the
$40 million plane on its own.
   ``We've told the U.S. government that we don't need any
technology (for the plane) from the United States,'' said a high
defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We had
hoped to develop it alone, but because of U.S. requests, we agreed
to co-development of the plane.''
   He said the F-16 technology ``would probably make the project go
more smoothly'' but ``it isn't clear how much it will actually
benefit Japan.''
   Under the current agreement, reached after several years of
negotiations, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is to head development,
using technology from Japan and from the F-16.
   The American company is to act as a subcontractor to Mitsubishi
and receive about 35-45 percent of the work, funded entirely by the
Japanese government.
   The Japanese technology likely to be used in the plane includes
sophisticated radar, advanced materials and a special control system
used to maneuver short additional wings, called canards, which allow
the plane to move horizontally or vertically without any change in
the angle of the plane's body.
   Initially, 130 of the planes are to be built, with a possible
follow-up order of about 100 more. Each FSX will cost $40 million,
defense officials say.
   Although Japan has made several types of aircraft, including the
YS-11 civilian transport plane, its aviation industry remains small.
   During World War II, the nation turned out 25,000 military
aircraft a year, including the famous Mitsubishi Zero fighter, but
after Japan's defeat, U.S. occupation forces closed down the
industry until 1952, when Japanese companies began servicing U.S.
planes during the Korean War.
   Since then, the industry has relied heavily on defense contracts,
including the development of Japan's current fighter jet, the F-1,
and production of F-15 fighters under license from McDonnell Douglas
of the United States.

   President Gen. Ibrahim Babangida dissolved
the Armed Forces Ruling Council on Monday and said he will rule
personally until a new council is named next week. He gave no reason
for the decision.
   Babangida set up the 28-member council after seizing power in a
barracks coup in August 1985. It had been the West African nation's
highest ruling body.
   The president told reporters Monday that the council will be
reconstituted next week and its first task will be to form a
Cabinet. He refused to identify who will make up the new council but
said it will include no civilians.
   Babangida said earlier he was planning a Cabinet reshuffle but
had given no indication the ruling council itself would be
dismantled.
   Babangida also announced Monday that he planned to form an
assembly of the armed forces to discuss their role in the transition
to civilian rule, scheduled to be completed in 1992.
   In the past few months, complaints have grown about the rising
cost of living in Africa's most populous nation. Labor unions have
threatened nationwide strikes in protest of government-ordered cuts
in fringe benefits and salaries.
   The military government has imposed a stringent austerity plan to
try to get out of a deep recession caused partly by lower oil
prices. Nigeria's main export earnings come from petroleum exports.

   Iran has launched its first domestic-built
hovercraft, named ``Yunus'' after the Hebrew prophet Jonah who was
swallowed by a whale, the official Islamic News Agency reported
Monday.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the 27-foot-long and
14-foot-wide craft was designed and produced by the
``self-sufficiency industry of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards.''
   It said the hovercraft, launched on Lake Mahrlu in the southern
Fars province, can carry 12 people, transport loads up to one ton
and reach a top speed of 38 mph.
   The agency quoted a Revolutionary Guards spokesman as saying a
similar hovercraft manufactured elsewhere would cost around
$250,000, but noted that he gave no details of production costs.
   Iran developed industrial ``self-sufficiency'' programs during
the eight-year war with Iraq to counter difficulties in obtaining
spare parts and high prices on the international arms market.
   It claimed to have launched a home-designed and produced
submarine and to be working on prototypes of other sophisticated
craft.

   The homeless man accused of strangling a pregnant
doctor told police ``a voice'' ordered him to kill the pathologist,
according to court papers filed Monday.
   Dr. Kathryn Hinnant, 33, was raped, sodomized and strangled with
a wire in her small office Jan. 7 at Bellevue Hospital.
   Shortly after his arrest, Steven Smith, 22, told a detective that
during the attack, ``She asked me, Why am I doing this?'' according
to the detective's report.
   The detective, David Argenzio, reported that he asked Smith what
his response was. After a pause, he asked again.
   ``He stated to me, `It was just something I had to do,''' the
detective reported.
   The exchange took place while Smith ``talked continuously'' in a
room at Kings County Hospital Jan. 9, ``sometimes about things
unrelated to the murder,'' Argenzio's report said.
   ``But most of the time he went on about how he had to do it
because something inside of him makes him do it,'' the report said.
   Smith said that if someone had given him psychiatric help, the
slaying wouldn't have occurred and ``the lady would still be
alive,'' the detective reported.
   The crime reminded Smith of an incident involving his girlfriend
in South Carolina, the report said.
   Argenzio quoted Smith as saying that a voice had told him to stab
his girlfriend, but he had forgotten where he put his knife, so he
beat her. She survived the beating.
   ``He went on to say that is why he knew he had to strangle the
lady because (of) ... something inside of him, like a low voice
telling him.''
   Smith has pleaded innocent to charges of second-degree murder,
first-degree rape, sodomy and first-degree robbery.
   Defense lawyer Marvyn Kornberg said he will probably present a
psychiatric defense for Smith, a mental outpatient at Kings County
Hospital for three years. Kornberg said Smith is under suicide watch
at all times at the hospital.

   Cartoonist Doug Marlette, whose work brought The
Atlanta Constitution a share of its first Pulitzer Prize in 20
years, resigned Monday to join Newsday.
   Marlette was brought to the Atlanta newspaper from The Charlotte
(N.C.) Observer by former Constitution Editor Bill Kovach. Kovach
resigned three months ago in a dispute with senior executives.
   Constitution Editorial Page Editor Tom Teepen said he knew of no
disputes particularly involving the cartoonist. ``There have not
been any clashes here over cartoons,'' Teepen said.
   But the 39-year-old Marlette said in his resignation letter that
he had been upset by Kovach's departure.
   ``As a native Southerner, I came here inspired by the vision of
Bill Kovach for world-class journalism in this region so richly
deserving of it,'' Marlette wrote. ``Tragically, that dream was
thwarted. Like many Southerners before me, I head north with a sense
of sadness and longing for what might have been.''
   Marlette, in an interview Monday with WSB-TV in Atlanta, made no
mention of any disputes or other problems.
   ``Leaving is a very sad ... thing. I feel real ambivalence about
it,'' he said. ``At the same time, I'm excited about the
opportunity.''
   Marlette's 1987 work at both the Observer and the Constitution
won a 1988 Pulitzer Prize.
   ``Obviously, the addition of an exceptional talent such as Doug
Marlette to the editorial pages of Newsday and New York Newsday will
strengthen what we believe to be the best viewpoints in the New York
area,'' said Robert M. Johnson, publisher of Newsday, in a statement.
   Newsday has three editorial cartoonists.
   Marlette will begin work for Newsday, based on New York's Long
Island, in ``around three weeks,'' Teepen said, adding that he was
not sure if the cartoonist would produce any more drawings for the
Constitution while he prepares to move.
   ``We'll be bringing in a good editorial cartoonist,'' Teepen
said. ``We're looking at some folks.''
   Marlette also writes the syndicated comic strip, ``Kudzu.'' He
was the first cartoonist to win a Nieman Fellowship at Harvard
University.

   The road to Kabul is littered

abandoned by retreating communist forces.
   Dotted along the highway leading from the Pakistani border to the
Afghan capital about 120 miles to the west are signs of the collapse
of the Afghan army in the area as Moslem insurgents move in.
   Guerrilla commanders say Afghan government forces began to
disintegrate after Soviet troops pulled out of the area late last

   The Energy Department is privately urging
energy companies to take extra precautions against terrorism, in
part out of concern that Libya or Iran might strike at key U.S.
energy facilities.
   In addition, the National Security Council has created a special
interagency task force to assess the vulnerability of domestic
energy systems and to study possible U.S. responses to a wide
variety of energy emergencies at home and abroad.
   ``Energy-related terrorism in the United States would be a
particularly significant threat'' in a military crisis involving the
Soviet Union, said an internal Energy Department report obtained by
The Associated Press.
   ``However, even in the absence of a superpower confrontation,
there is the possibility that potential Third World adversaries
could sponsor attacks on the energy infrastructure in the United
States,'' the report said.

   As a broiling summer day dissolved into a
sultry night at New York's Coxsackie state prison, Joseph Puma
waited to see if five prison guards held hostage by prisoners would
make it out alive.
   After 14 hours, about midnight, the inmates released their
hostages.
   ``This guy came out _ a friend of mine _ he was bloody, beaten,
battered and he wore inmate clothing. He just collapsed in my arms,
crying,'' said Puma, head of the state prison guards' union.
   Puma saw the pain in the faces of the guards and their families
and came up with an idea: The union, through Lloyd's of London,
established a ``captivity coverage'' insurance plan, with benefits
to be paid to survivors of prison uprisings.
   It's believed to be the first time an insurance company has
allowed such a policy, said Nels Carlson, a Lloyd's underwriter.
   Union members held hostage at least 12 hours would be paid a sum
equal to half their annual salary. In the case of death or injury,
the insurance benefit paid to the guard or his family would be twice
the salary. A New York prison guard's average annual pay: $27,500.
   ``It's kind of like your life insurance, where you hope it never
gets paid out, but it happens,'' said Hardy Rauch, director of
standards and accreditation for the American Correctional
Association in Laurel, Md. ``The concept is quite nice. It's an idea
that could very easily be expanded to other states.''

   For starters, there's the collection of presidential china:
``Grover Cleveland at lunch today ... Abraham Lincoln yesterday. Can

   There's more. ``The views are pretty spectacular,'' she says,
noting she can gaze directly at the Oval Office from her
second-floor office in the White House. ``See, I can see him right
there,'' Mrs. Bush says, pointing across the Rose Garden to the
office occupied by her husband, President Bush.
   In the Lincoln Bedroom, Mrs. Bush shows off a felt-covered frame
that contains one of only five copies of the Gettysburg Address.
``This is the only one signed and dated. You can read that. ...
Isn't that amazing?
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Mrs. Bush said she
``felt right at home from the very first moment.''

   The whole family helped out when Dican
Hadjy Kabakjian began moonlighting in his basement in 1924,
stretching his physics professor's salary and riding the crest of a
promising new cancer treatment.
   Kabakjian was a great man and a brilliant scientist, said one
neighbor in the middle-class suburb of towering trees, stately old
houses, quiet dead-end streets and back yards big enough for great
games of hide-and-go-seek.
   The business in the basement of the three-story, stucco-and-frame
Victorian duplex helped get the Kabakjians through the Depression.
   It also did something else: it made theirs the only single
residence on the government's list of the most toxic waste sites in
America.
   For two decades, until Kabakjian died in 1945, the family
supplied doctors and hospitals with radium-tipped needles to insert
near cancerous tumors.
   ``I'd take the raw stuff and cook it until you get these radium
crystals,'' said Kabakjian's daughter, Alice Kabakjian Lewis, 74.
Her sister Louise would weigh the crushed crystals and pack them
into platinum needles. The physicist's sons Armen and Raymond worked
during vacations. Dicranouhi Kabakjian helped her husband when she
wasn't keeping his house. Daughter Lillian kept the books.
   There was no fear of radiation then; far from it. Two decades
after it was discovered, radium was hailed as a miracle treatment
for everything from cancer to tonsilitis. It would be years before
scientists learned that radium decays into radon gas that can cause
cancer. The disease may not show up for 40 years.
   Someone living in the house 16 hours a day for their whole life
stood a one-in-three chance of cancer, said Victor Janosik, who is
managing the cleanup for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
   Raymond Kabakjian died at 65 of abdominal cancer, in 1977. His
son, Raymond Jr., died of bladder cancer in 1983, at age 37. William
Dooner, who delivered radium, died in 1984 at age 71 of cancer of
the head and lungs.
   Dican Kabakjian didn't develop cancer. He died in 1945, at 70, of
emphysema probably caused by fumes from the acid he used to process
the radium ore.
   The Tallant family bought the house in 1949 and lived there until
moving into a bigger place in 1961. Anna Tallant died of breast
cancer in 1969, at 54.
   The ``hot house'' came to light in 1962 during a search for
forgotten radium sites. In 1964, authorities spent $200,000 to
decontaminate it. They declared success after removing furniture,
dishes, rugs and clothing, and after replacing windows, walls, sinks
and a concrete basement floor. That September the couple who owned
it, Harry and Mary Kizirian, moved back in.
   But in 1983, during a survey of sites that might be eligible for
federal cleanup assistance, the EPA found radon levels in the
basement 10 times higher than allowable and gamma radiation, similar
to X-rays, 3{ times higher.
   In 1985, the house was put on the EPA's Superfund list.
   Last August, white-suited workers equipped with oxygen masks,
vacuums and Geiger counters arrived. They dismantled the house board
by board and brick by brick. All but 1{ bricks had been contaminated
with radium.
   The trees where neighborhood children played were uprooted;
squirrels had scampered up them carrying radioactivity from the
ground where Kabakjian dumped workshop waste. The yard was dug up,
too, leaving a 9-foot-deep pit.
   About 240 feet of sewer line running down the street is
contaminated and will have to be replaced. None of the surrounding
houses have been found to be contaminated, but six lots showed
higher-than-normal radioactivity, pushing the cleanup cost from $7.5
million to $9.5 million.
   ``I don't feel a great deal of anxiety about radiation,'' said
Georgianna Gretzenberg. The back door of the house she and her
husband bought in 1987 is 20 to 30 yards from the chain-link fence
that surrounds the empty lot and from the trailers where workers are
checked for contamination. The free-standing garage they planned to
turn into a studio may be lost to the cleanup.
   ``It's sad to see the neighborhood ripped up. For me, it's more
that,'' said Mrs. Gretzenberg, who had a healthy baby boy six months
ago. ``My biggest concern is they won't finish. I hope it will be
done so we can go back to doing what you do in suburbia.''
   Helen Click, who has lived behind the house for 23 years, said,
``We were told as long as it's not in our house, we shouldn't be
concerned.''
   Richard Kizirian, whose family bought the house from the
Tallants, wonders if the radium can be blamed for illnesses that
afflicted his family, including sores that developed on his father's
legs before he died.
   ``That's the $64 question. Our understanding is the long-term
effects of radiation have not been proven,'' said Kizirian. He has
considered suing, but isn't sure who to sue, and lawyers say he's
lucky the EPA paid for the cleanup.
   The costs included $140,000 paid to the Kizirians and the
Basehore family, who lived in the other side of the duplex. The
families retain ownership of the land, which will be filled and
landscaped when the work is done this summer.
   Kizirian said that given its history, he doubts anyone will buy,
so he and the other heirs to his parents' estate might donate it to
the town.
   Nancy Basehore, who is in her 70s, declined to talk at length
about her experiences, but considers Kabakjian to be a great man.
She hasn't decided what to do when the property can be occupied
again, either.
   ``Once the EPA finishes they'll certify they don't have a
radiation problem,'' said George Bochanski, a borough councilman and
former Environmental Protection Agency spokesman. ``That's more than
some of us can say.''
   Penny Flaherty, who rents the house next door, grew vegetables
the summer of 1987, but Kabakjian's legacy worried her. ``It was
funny, I grew them and brought them in, but I had qualms about
eating them and threw them out.''

<HEAD>The Chocolate War: Vicious School Days</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After reaching the 11th grade, Keith Gordon
dropped out of school. So when at the age of 27 he had a chance to
direct his first movie, ``The Chocolate War,'' he drew upon a very
different kind of education.
   Gordon, who had acted in ``Dressed to Kill'' and ``All That
Jazz'' among other films, remembered his conversations with such
directors as Brian DePalma and John Carpenter.
   ``That was film school, working with those people,'' he said. ``I
think there's no medium that's more immediate; it's just beginning
to be scratched.
   DePalma (``Body Double,'' ``The Untouchables'') directed Gordon
in ``Dressed to Kill'' and ``Home Movies.''
   ``Brian's really a brilliant stylist,'' Gordon said. ``He really
took the time to explain to me why he picked a certain lens. ...
That was Brian's contribution.''
   And from Carpenter (``Christine''), Gordon took some pointers on
how to keep a film crew happy.
   ``Carpenter showed me how a set should be run. John never yells.
His theory is, `life is short and if we're not going to have a good
time, you might as well pack and go home.'''
   The turning point for Gordon came 20 years ago, when he saw
Stanley Kubrick's science-fiction classic, ``2001: A Space Odyssey.''
   ``I thought, `OK, that's what I'm doing.' I was haunted by it,
had nightmares by it. I started going to off-beat things, foreign
films. I found myself obsessed by stories that didn't have neat
answers, that made me question things.''
   Gordon worked in the film library at the Museum of Modern Art,
going through the museum's archives, and began appearing in school
plays. But by the time he was in high school, he was ready to move
on.
   ``I never did well with rules,'' said the director, just 16 when
he left school.
   His professional acting career had already begun the year before
when he joined the National Playwright's Conference at the Eugene
O'Neill Theatre. He worked in stage, television and films over the
next few years but dreamed of being on the other side of the camera.
   ``It was always in my heart to direct,'' Gordon said. ``To be
honest, I thought I would be 45 or 50, not 27.''
   ``The Chocolate War'' is based on Robert Cormier's best-selling
novel, which gives a lurid account of life at a Catholic school in
Washington. Gordon, recalling his own unhappy experiences in school,
was attracted to the issues dealt with in the book.
   ``I carried this book around in my head for 10 years. I wondered
if stuff in the book was unrealistically harsh or vicious but I met
people who had been sexually molested and repeatedly beaten up _
stuff where your mouth is hanging open.''
   For years the book was passed around all the major studios, but
when the rights finally became available, Gordon quickly snapped
them up and persuaded Jonathan Krane, an independent producer, to
back the project.
   ``The crew was young. My cinematographer was only a few years
older than me,'' said Gordon, who completed filming in just 24
shooting days, for a cost of $700,000.
   ``The Chocolate War'' stars John Glover as the sadistic Brother
Leon, Wally Ward as the ruthless leader of a student gang and Ilan
Mitchell-Smith as a freshman caught up the school's vicious
atmosphere.
   Following the example of Carpenter, Gordon made sure the crew,
working on a limited budget, was properly appreciated.
   ``I'm almost proudest that we had a great time. Almost everybody
who worked on that film said he never had more fun. On that kind of
money, you'd be better be ... sure that they have a good time. Any
director that doesn't avail himself of the talent around him is a
fool.''
   He was tested early in the project. One day, after shooting for
15 hours, Gordon could sense that ``the natives were restless.''
   ``I made a speech, bought pizzas and shook everybody's hands. I
made sure they were heard. I made the producer give everybody an
extra $100 for such a long day.''
   When filming was over, Gordon gave himself high marks for his
performance on the set.
   ``I was surprised how much fun it was. I expected to be more
miserable, more panic struck,'' he said. ``I discovered I'm pretty
good in panic situations. Parking tickets I get nervous breakdowns,
but on the set I was very clear-headed.''
   Gordon seems unlikely to drop out of the film world.
   ``Ultimately, you're realizing your own vision,'' he said. ``It's
collaborative, but also very personal. Film involves literature,
music, acting and lighting. It's a wonderful chance to stretch
yourself in every direction at once.''

<HEAD>Priest Helps Jews Document Their Presence in Italy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a basement along the Tiber River, a Roman Catholic
priest is poring over thousands of dusty, worm-eaten books in a
project to preserve precious remnants of Jewish culture in Italy.
   The collection of some 20,000 books, manuscripts and magazines
helps document the vitality of what may be the oldest Jewish
community in the West, with its roots believed to predate the
Christian era.
   But like other remnants, such as ancient synagogues and
catacombs, much of the written record has deteriorated or been
shipped to Israel for safekeeping.
   Now, however, through a combination of grants, a Nobel
Prize-winner's contribution and volunteer work by the Rev. Pier
Francesco Fumagalli, the books will be cataloged, restored and made
available to the public in the new National Jewish Library and
Heritage Center when it opens in Rome within a year or so.
   ``As long as there are Jews in Italy they are entitled to their
heritage,'' said Tullia Zevi, the driving force behind the project.
   Mrs. Zevi is president of the Union of Italian Jewish
Communities, which represents the country's 40,000 Jews.
   Having successfully pressed for a turnover of the Jewish
catacombs from Vatican to Italian government jurisdiction five years
ago, she next set her sights on placing collections of Jewish books
from around Italy under one roof in Rome.
   Unable to afford a lay library expert, she turned to Fumagalli,
one of Italy's leading Judaic scholars who worked for eight years at
the 400-year-old Ambrosiano Library in Milan. He is a member of the
Vatican's Commission for Relations with Judaism.
   He spends Monday afternoons working with four Jewish university
students in the basement of Rome's Jewish school to cataloge the
books stacked in metal cabinets and protected from further decay by
a humidifier.
   Several thousand are in very bad shape, with their bindings worn
off, pages yellowed and damaged by worms.
   ``It's a mutually enriching experience,'' he said, noting that
the Jewish press in Italy dates to the late 1400s.
   ``Culture is a measure of the vitality of a people.''
   He said Italy's Jewish press was the oldest in Europe. A Jewish
press began in Spain about the same time as Italy's but closed down
when Jews were expelled by Spain's Catholic rulers in 1492.
   About 80 percent of the books in Italy are in Hebrew, many of
those from the collection of the Rabbinical College in Rome.
   Others have come from Siena, Florence, Ferrara, Pisa and such
towns as Pitigliano, near Viterbo, where there are no longer any
Jews.
   In addition to prayer books and books on Jewish history and
customs, there are publications and documents put out by the various
communities that provide a glimpse of Jewish life in Italy through
the centuries.
   The government provided $460,000 for restoration of the library
site, a former mechanic's workshop about 50 yards from the school
and facing the monumental ochre-colored main synagogue across the
Tiber.
   Rita Levi-Montalcini, the Italian-American scientist, who is
Jewish, contributed what Mrs. Zevi called a ``slice'' of the
$145,000 cash prize that came with winning the Nobel Prize for
medicine in 1986. The money allows the community to pay the students
about $300 a month for their work with the library.
   Olivetti, the business machine company, donated a computer for
the book cataloging.
   The Jewish presence in Rome is believed to date back 2,000 years.
Its history was heavily conditioned by the papacy. In 1555, Pope
Paul IV confined Rome's Jews to a ghetto that stood until papal rule
ended in Rome in 1870.
   But according to Mrs. Zevi, Jews lost faith in Italy only after
the enactment of the racial laws by Benito Mussolini's fascist
dictatorship in 1938, which foreshadowed deportions to Nazi death
camps.
   More than 8,000 Jews were deported and only around 900 returned.
   Mrs. Zevi said many of those who emigrated on their own never
came back while those who survived shipped valuable items to Israel.
   But attitudes appear to be changing. Italian Jews were heartened
by the broad support from politicians at a recent convention
examining the damage done by Mussolini's racial laws.
   By the same token, Italian towns have shown an interest in
restoring synagogues and other Jewish remnants.
   ``This is a 99 percent Catholic country,'' Mrs. Zevi said. ``It
prides itself on being pluralistic. We are the ones who can supply
the pluralism.''

<HEAD>War Shattered Town in Mozambique Struggles to Rebuild</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MELINDA HAM</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILANGE, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two and a half years ago, 60,000
people lived in Milange, then a lively place with night clubs and
shops and prospering from a large tea estate.
   But then Mozambique's guerrilla war came to Milange and today
only 5,000 remain; the others fled to safety in Malawi, just two
miles away; the night clubs and shops are heavily damaged, the tea
estate razed. Grass pokes through potholes in the wide avenues.
   The destruction was wrought by the guerrillas who are trying to
overthrow the southern African country's Marxist government. They
occupied Milange in September, 1986. Government forces drove them
into the bush last June.
   Now government troops are supervising the reconstruction of the
town in northern Mozambique's fertile Zambezia province.
   But reconstruction is slow. The rebels control much of the bush,
isolating Milange and leaving it dependent on international aid
brought in from Malawi.
   A school and clinic have been rebuilt, but only three teachers
are available for 1,500 children in the school and one medical
assistant with scarcely any medicines runs the clinic.
   The Mozambique Department of Agriculture has begun rehabilitating
the tea estate. It plans to bring equipment from other tea-growing
regions and envisions some 500 workers reviving production that is
so vital to the town's economy.
   The United Nations High Commission for Refugees is distributing
seeds for cassava, groundnuts (peanuts) and maize (corn) to
encourage Mozambican refugees in Malawi to return to their abandoned
homes.
   An estimated 640,000 Mozambicans have fled into Malawi in recent
years because of food shortages and the war between the government
and the Mozambique National Resistance, known by its Portuguese
acronoym ReNaMo.
   The guerrillas took up arms in 1977 in an attempt to install a
pro-Western government in Mozambique, a Portuguese colony until
independence in 1975.
   The refugees in Malawi are among an estimated 1.2 million
Mozambicans who have taken refuge in neighboring countries. But aid
officials say those in Malawi are slowly starting to return home,
with 500 leaving in December, many headed for Milange.
   One recently returned refugee said he fled to Malawi when he
heard the rebels were coming.
   ``Those who stayed were beaten, and the women _ young or old _
were raped,'' said the father of five, who spoke only on condition
of anonymity. ``I have come home because I feel safe with the
Frelimo (government) soldiers and I want to plant my fields.''
   Little effort has been made to rebuild Milange's derelict town
center. Instead, poeple have built grass huts on the edge of their
fields around the town.
   A bulldozer, lent by aid donors, is clearing an airstrip for
light planes to bring relief supplies.
   Milange is gradually coming back, but defense from rebel attacks
is still a main concern.
   ``We will liquidate the armed bandits and construct freedom and
progress,'' says a government poster on the wall of Milange's vacant
hotel.

<HEAD>Black Street Vendors Become Economic Force in South Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kleinbooi Matsegeng is a
typical black South African businessman. His premises are the
sidewalk and he's spent much of his 15 years as a street vendor
trying to dodge the police.
   Now, times are good. Matsegeng obtained a license in 1987 and
sells an array of goods in a zone where vendors can operate freely.
He is able to pay four helpers with income that has risen tenfold
since he began peddling paper bags in 1974.
   Matsegeng and entrepreneurs like him personify the booming
``informal sector'' of South Africa's economy _ hundreds of
thousands of blacks who work for themselves outside the more
structured, white-dominated realm of paychecks, job applications and
tax forms.
   No one knows the exact scope of the informal sector, but experts
believe it represents perhaps one-fourth of the country's economic
activity and provides a living for at least a million blacks.
   President P.W. Botha has acknowledged the informal sector's role
in creating jobs. Last year, he presented three mobile hot-dog
stands to street vendors in Pretoria and sampled stew at a sidewalk
stall.
   Street vendors, known in South Africa as hawkers, peddle
everything from hair spray to handcrafts, sausages to sunglasses.
Recently they have begun to work collectively to increase their
economic influence.
   About 16,000 hawkers and owners of ``spaza shops'' _ small,
unlicensed grocery stores operated inside homes in black townships _
have joined the African Council of Hawkers and Informal Businesses.
   The council was founded in 1986 by Lawrence Mavundla, 30, a
former shop steward for the National Union of Mineworkers, who was
fired from a gold mine during a 1985 strike. Later that year, he saw
some hawkers being chased by police and decided to form an
organization to represent their interests.
   ``One old woman who could not run fast enough was caught, her
goods destroyed and she was thrown in the back of a van,'' he
recalled. ``I thought this should not happen to people who are
trying to make an honest living.''
   The council, financed by membership dues of 10 rand ($4) a month,
has a staff of 17. It campigns to ease licensing restrictions,
provides legal aid to hawkers who face fines, and negotiates with
businesses in hopes they will become more supportive of hawking.
   Hawkers are regulated by local authorities, and many of the 700
municipal governments maintain bans or tough restrictions. But
Mavundla's council has helped achieve major reforms in Johannesburg,
the largest city.
   Hawkers now can obtain licenses in two days, rather than six
months, he said, leading to an increase of licensed hawkers from 250
a few years ago to 9,600 now.
   Johannesburg recently opened its central business district to
hawkers after years of exclusion and has created ``free hawking''
zones where traders like Matsegeng can operate.
   The city has scrapped requirements that hawkers have storage
facilities and advertise in newspapers in order to qualify for a
license.
   Now, Johannesburg's hawkers can operate as close as 100 yards
from a store selling similar goods, in contrast to 400 yards before.
They can stay in one place for two hours; before, they had to move
every 20 minutes.
   ``The established business community is our biggest problem,''
Mavundla said in an interview. ``Retailers see hawkers as a threat,
a pressure group coming to take their customers away.''
   ``They need to see there's a benefit for themselves,'' he added.
``The more competition there is, the more business there will be. We
can provide jobs and help the economy grow.''
   The council's ultimate aim is give more economic power to blacks
and to help poor, uneducated people provide for themselves in a
society where 5 million whites dominate 26 million blacks
economically as well as politically.
   ``Economics is going to succeed where politics have failed to
find solutions,'' said Mavundla.
   The council's publicity director, Vicky Sussens, said hawkers are
receiving increasing cooperation from wholesalers and manufacturers,
even though they fear reprisals from retailers.
   She added that wholesalers and manufacturers realize their future
is selling to blacks.
   ``There is more respect now. They see hawkers as businessmen, not
just someone trying to eke out a living like a beggar.''
   Successful hawkers such as Matsegeng can earn 1,200 rand ($500) a
month, double the wages of a typical black mineworker. Those
operating out of houses often earn even more.
   Police harassment of hawkers has declined but remains a problem,
said Mavundla. He said hawkers commonly spend 60 rand ($25) a week
bribing policemen to avoid fines or confiscation of goods, either of
which can wipe out a week's earnings.
   Government leaders praise the informal sector, ``but they're only
saying it for political gain,'' Mavundla said. ``They're not really
serious.''
   Louise Tager, a law professor who has studied the informal
sector, says it is flourishing because of restrictions on formal
black business development in townships, such as lack of approved
sites and bans on using homes as business
   ``Its existence is evidence that no legislation, however harsh,
can totally extinguish the entreprenurial spirit,'' she wrote.

<TEXT>
   Ask freshman Rep. Ben Jones how he feels about
the 51 percent congressional pay raise and he'll tell you to read
his lips. Then he'll twist them into contortions defying translation.
   Jones, the TV actor-turned-Georgia politician, demonstrated that
evasion technique at a black-tie dinner the other night. It was
comedy with a message.
   The 101st Congress is in a political and parliamentary maze on
pay, an issue that has nagged senators and representatives since the
first.
   While he backed this raise, President Bush said that in a perfect
world the members of Congress would vote on salaries instead of
operating under a system of raises by remote control. That vision of
perfection is not widely shared at the Capitol.
   For 200 years, setting pay has been a headache for members, who
fear voter retribution for approving their own raises. For the last
20, the Senate and House have sought political shelter in a system
designed to spare them votes on their own salaries.
   Using one of the best-tested of political hedges, Congress turned
the pay dilemma over to a commission. That usually means getting
somebody else to cope with a high-risk issue, preferably somebody
who doesn't have to run for re-election.
   That process was supposed to make Congress a spectator when
salary commissions proposed pay increases for House and Senate, the
federal courts and the top tier of the executive branch. The
president can accept, reject or modify before sending the pay
recommendation on to Congress, which gets the raise unless both
houses vote no within 30 days.
   That sounded foolproof. It isn't.
   It led to intramural bickering at the Capitol, since the Senate
often has had free, politically-popular votes against pay raises
that took effect anyhow for lack of House rejection. That seemed to
be happening again, but the game plan came apart in the House
because of widespread public opposition to the $45,500 raise the
commission recommended.
   Congressional pay is a ready-made issue for an election
challenger _ who, if elected, comes to see the need for higher
salaries in a new light.
   That instinct showed when Republicans tried to use ``yet another
whopping pay increase'' as a 1989 fundraising issue. But they had to
drop it because President Reagan recommended the raise and President
Bush endorsed it, both coupling support with a ban on the
speechmaking fees many members have used to supplement their pay.
   The pay commission said the increase is needed to restore a 35
percent drop in the spending power of congressional, judicial and
top executive branch salaries during the past 20 years. Debate
seldom centers on the merits of an increase, although the size of
this one has made it particularly vulnerable to voter wrath.
   Congress has tried again and again to find a system that would
calm the salary issue. There have been proposals to turn the issue
over to a permanent, independent panel; even to have the Supreme
Court set congressional salaries.
   Nor is there new business in the call for reform as the price of
a pay raise. President Ford said his endorsement of a 1977 raise was
based on ``a firm commitment to a new code of conduct'' that was to
have included a ban on moneymaking speeches. The raise took effect
without the ban.
   One salary commission called the whole business a prolonged
adventure in futility. Prolonged indeed. The first Congress, in
1789, got $6 a day. That was raised to $1,500 a year in 1816,
stirring a voter rebellion that ousted incumbents including Daniel
Webster. That led to repeal and an $8 daily wage.
   When the Bill of Rights was proposed, so was a constitutional
amendment forbidding any Congress from raising its pay until after
the next election. It never was ratified. The assumption was that
House and Senate would vote on their salaries, and that their
constituents would be the final judges.
   Now the sytem avoids pay votes.
   Lloyd Cutler, chairman of the salary commission, said that's the
way it should be. In advocating a raise without a direct vote,
Cutler, a Washington lawyer and former Democratic White House
counsel, said utility infielders who bat .200 are being paid more
than judges and members of Congress.
   Some are. But they do have to risk going to bat.

   A posh retreat laid out more than 800 years ago
for emperors awaits President and Mrs. Bush when they come to China
Feb. 25. The guesthouse has 26 rooms in its two stories and costs
$20,000 a night for regular guests.
   An electric massage chair and whirlpool bath is in the main
bedroom.
   The Diaoyutai State Guesthouse stands almost as a contradiction
to the austerity of today's China.
   ``Yes, we are socialist,'' explains Sun Guotong, one of the
officials who run the place, ``but for heads of state you must have
such things.''
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union will stay
there when he visits in May. So will Prince Charles and Princess
Diana when they come in November.
   The 26-room guesthouse on the complex, simply called No. 18, was
remodeled for Queen Elizabeth II when she visited Beijing in 1986.
   The Chinese government pays the bill for official and state
guests such as these, but others have to come up with $20,000 a
night.
   Diaoyutai, which means ``fishing terrace,'' sits on 100 acres of
pine groves where peacocks wander and swans grace a pond.
   The complex is made up of 15 large guest villas. No. 18 is the
most sumptuous.
   From its gold-plated bathroom fixtures and silk-covered walls to
its displays of ancient bronzeware and gold cloisonne, the villa
radiates luxury and elitism in a grubby, gray city where
egalitarianism so lately was in style.
   But ideology seems to stop at the gates to Diaoyutai. Even during
the extreme leftist Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, Chairman Mao
Tse-tung's wife, Jiang Qing, relaxed in villa No. 17 by watching
Western movies.
   China's shifting foreign policy can be charted, however, from the
guest list. In 1959, when the separate villas were built, most of
the guests were communist comrades.
   Now, Director Cheng Shaoliang said, most guests are Americans and
Japanese.
   The Vietnamese revolutionary Ho Chi Minh, Soviet leader Nikita S.
Khrushchev, President Francois Mitterrand of France and Presidents
Richard M. Nixon, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan were among the
parade of world leaders who stayed at Diaoyutai.
   ``Other hotels in Beijing may be more convenient _ guests can
come and go more freely,'' Cheng said in a recent interview. ``But
we offer quiet and security they can't match.''
   Diaoyutai's telephone operators are ordered not to connect calls
to guests if the caller doesn't know their room number. The police
who stand at attention at the compound's gates admit only cars whose
license plates have been cleared in advance.
   For the guests, however, almost anything is possible. Cheng tells
a story of a guest years ago who wanted water chestnuts during the
winter, when they were out of season. The guesthouse sent Peoples'
Liberation Army soldiers to a nearby lake to cut through the ice and
try to find some, he said.
   ``Now we wouldn't do that,'' Cheng said. But almost. Diaoyutai
sends its own trucks to the coast to pick up fresh shrimp and has
special ingredients flown in from all over the country.
   It pays 1,000 yuan ($270) a pound for a rare herb necessary for a
special scallop soup.
   ``Hotels won't do that,'' Cheng said.
   With that kind of overhead, rates start surprisingly low at $140
a night for a standard room. Presidential suites cost $500 a night.
   But the fanciest villas, No. 12 and No. 18, must be rented in
their entirety for $20,000 a night.
   Among other recent users of No. 18 were Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi of India and Armand Hammer, the American industrialist.
   Prince Charles and Princess Diana are booked for Nov. 1.
   No. 18's presidential suite includes separate his-and-her
bedrooms and bathrooms, each thickly carpeted and decorated with
costly art works.
   ``He'' gets the electric massage chair and whirlpool bath.
``She'' gets a sunken tub with brass rails.
   To help cover its annual 28-million-yuan ($7.5-million) budget,
Diaoyutai began selectively accepting non-VIP tourists and
businessmen in 1980 and opened a club for locally based foreign
businessmen last year.
   But non-VIPs need connections to get a room reservation.
   ``People can't come in off the street,'' said Sun Guotong,
Cheng's deputy.
   The club, with a $40,000 membership fee, also is intended only
for ``the leading people,'' Sun said.
   ``If a lot of people come, the air is not so fresh,'' he added,
while walking through the deserted exercise room, three-lane bowling
alley and billiards room. The indoor swimming pool is only four feet
deep _ ``very safe'' for visiting leaders, Sun said.
   He paused in front of a green felt-covered table used for playing
the Chinese tile game of mahjong and pushed back the pieces to
reveal a mechanism that automatically lines up tiles for each new
game.
   Mahjong in China is practically synonymous with gambling, which
is illegal. Do guests gamble?
   ``I don't know,'' Sun said diplomatically.

<HEAD>Guatemalan Priest Presses for Land Reform Despite Dangers</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<UNK>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>TIQUISATE, Guatemala (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   His role models are the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. and Bishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador, two
assassinated civil rights activists.
   He nearly followed them full circle in September when attackers
opened fire on his car, killing his bodyguard-driver and wounding
his adopted son.
   The Rev. Andres Giron, a 42-year-old Roman Catholic priest,
hasn't stopped what he's been doing _ pressing for land reform and
seeking permission from the Vatican to run for president of this
Central American country.
   But that doesn't mean he is fearless.
   ``I'm afraid,'' he said. ``Sometimes I think it's better to be a
live burro than a dead thoroughbred.''
   Giron, a U.S.-educated priest who taught in the slums of Memphis,
Tenn., in the 1960s and marched with Martin Luther King in the
city's garbage workers strike, continues to pursue land reform even
though it can be mortally dangerous to do so.
   His father and four other relatives were among the estimated
100,000 people killed in political violence during the late 1970s
and early 1980s. Local and international human rights groups blame
government security forces for the vast majority of the killings.
The slaughter of suspected leftists quelled a stubborn, decades-old
insurgency, though pockets of guerrilla activity remain.
   Giron spent 1981-83 in the United States because of threats on
his life here.
   ``In Guatemala, land is the source of power. No land, no power,''
he said in an interview beneath an almond tree next to his church in
Tiquisate, 55 miles southwest of Guatemala City.
   Two bodyguards, one with a submachine-gun and the other cradling
a shotgun, leaned against the priest's car nearby. Giron had just
said Mass for about 200 parishioners, among them eight adolescent
girls dressed in white lace and finery for their First Communion.
   He told them in the homily that his Christian duty, and theirs,
included ``denouncing the terrible things going on in this country;
that officials are stealing, that the army is killing people.''
   He exhorted them to act as yeast in the firgurative bread of
society, to contribute to a rising up.
   Giron has enlivened a political scene already focused on 1990
presidential elections.
   He said he intends to use the National Campesino Association he
formed in 1986 as the base for a political party. The party will
challenge the centrist Christian Democrats and rightists who have
dominated partisan politics since the return to civilian government
in 1986.
   The peasant organization represents 120,000 people, he said.
   Ultra-conservatives, who with the armed forces ran the country
throughout its modern history, consider Giron a subversive. Some
have called for his arrest.
   ``This country needs a spark to ignite a revolution, and I want
to be part of that revolution,'' he said.
   The priest calculates that 71 percent of Guatemala's arable land
is owned by 1 percent of its population. Others dispute that figure.
But there is agreement that land distribution is among the most
skewed in the hemisphere, favoring a small group at the expense of
poor Indian peasants who make up nearly 60 percent of the population.
   According to the U.S. Agency for International Development
(USAID), enough uncultivated land is available on big estates to
provide five-acre plots to each of the estimated 500,000 heads of
peasant households with no land at all.
   Challenging the gentry's hold on land has always been dangerous.
   President Jacobo Arbenz began the country's first and only land
reform in the early 1950s and his initiative galvanized rightist
opposition. Military officers supported by the U.S. Central
Intelligency Agency overthrew Arbenz in 1954 and returned all
expropriated holdings to their previous owners, among them the
U.S.-based United Fruit Co.
   USAID subsequently described Arbenz's reform plan as ``moderate
and progressive''
   Giron does not have a detailed plan yet for redistributing land.
But he describes his philosophy as radical. He envisions a Guatemala
with no landless peasants, a place where country people have enough
land to grow the food they need.
   ``It can't be done in one year, or even two, because people have
to be educated. But I would make a real revolution here, and they
(the landholders) know it,'' said Giron.
   Giron, who supported the successful presidenical candidacy of
Vinicio Cerezo in the 1985 election, said he has letters from the
president in which the Christian Democrat committed himself to land
reform.
   Cerezo has made no such commitment publicly, but he has supported
programs to aid small farmers. He also has used government funds to
buy about 11,000 acres of land to divide among some 3,000 peasant
families.
   ``All that has been done has been done very timidly,'' said
Giron, who with some followers invaded and occupied fallow farmland
in 1986. The government bought the parcel and sold it to the
peasants at subsidized prices.
   Giron's campesino association runs three cooperative farms on
such land bought cheaply from the government.
   He said Cerezo probably would have pursued small-scale
redistribution had it not been for a coup attempt last May.
   The military high command backed Cerezo's government and put the
rebellion down. But the civilian administration, which had been
barely able to assert authority against the military in the best of
times, became even more conditioned by and dependent upon military
tutelage.
   ``May was it for Vinicio,'' said Giron.
   Rightists contend that breaking up large holdings would hurt
production of hard currency-earning mainstays of the economy _
coffee, sugar, bananas and cotton.
   ``Even in good export years, people are dying of hunger,''
responds Giron. ``I'm not in favor of destroying the productive
apparatus. I'm smart enough to know we can't live without dollars.
   ``But I can't go along with a system under which a small group of
the privileged live like kings while most people live like beggars.''
   Some have suggested Giron harbors a death wish.
   ``How can they say I want to be martyred?'' he said. ``It's a
risk, but it's a risk I'm willing to take. But that doesn't mean I
want to die.
   ``What the hell,'' he added, switching from Spanish to the
colloquial English he picked up in Memphis. ``I don't want to die. I
wanna live.''

<HEAD>Few Convictions So Far of Philippines Mutineers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN GUERRERO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only 52 of 500 or so soldiers accused
of trying to overthrow President Corazon Aquino's government have
been convicted so far, despite her vow to punish them to the fullest
that the law allows.
   Military records indicate 108 have been acquitted.
   Sources close to the Judge Advocate General's Office predict most
of the accused will either be acquitted or receive light sentences
unless Mrs. Aquino applies pressure on the military justice system.
   Military courts have charged at least 488 officers and enlisted
men with involvement in six coup attempts since Mrs. Aquino took
power in an uprising against President Ferdinand E. Marcos in
February, 1986.
   No reliable figures are available on the actual number of
soldiers involved in the coup attempts, including a mutiny Aug. 28,
1987, when at least 53 people were killed and more than 300 wounded.
   But military officials say at least 2,000 mutineers took part
that last and the most serious attempted coup. Hundreds more were
involved in five others.
   Many lower-ranking enlisted men were quietly released without
charge because they were simply following orders. Others escaped,
including former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, who led the
mutiny in August, 1987.
   So far, the stiffest sentence _ 12 years at hard labor _ was
given to Col. Oscar Canlas, leader of the takeover of a private
television station in Manila in January, 1987.
   Although the sentence called for hard labor, sources close to the
military say Canlas, who was convicted last May, is being held in
relative comfort _ with access to tennis courts and other amenities
_ at a military garrison pending completion of a review of his
conviction.
   In December, 41 soldiers were acquitted of taking part in an
attack in April 1987 on Fort Bonifacio, headquarters of the
Philippine army. The military said they were freed because of lack
of witnesses, although sources said prosecutors had sworn statements
from witnesses linking most of them to the attack.
   The acquittals have led to charges in the Philippine press of a
military whitewash. In a recent editorial, the independent
Philippine Daily Inquirer said the acquittals reflect an ``esprit de
corps'' in the military that ``assumes the form of a closed club,
the members of which in each other's eyes can do no wrong.''
   A Western diplomat with links to the Philippine military said he
suspects the courts will go easy on defendants to avoid worsening
factionalism in the 160,000-member armed forces.
   ``I don't think anyone will be put up against the wall,'' said
the diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``There may be a
few who get punished, but I suspect most will get off lightly in the
spirit of national reconciliation.''
   A military lawyer, also insisting on anonymity, acknowledged that
personal ties and the ``brotherhood of arms'' often influence
court-martial boards, which are trying the soldiers.
   ``Before we write our decision on that piece of paper, our
conscience asks us, `Can you live with this? Can you live with the
thought that you sentenced a guy to be killed _ a guy in your same
uniform and the establishment?''' he said.
   ``Then my heart tells me _ do this.'' He gave a thumbs up sign
for acquittal.
   In such an atmosphere, military lawyers say it will take pressure
from the Aquino administration to overcome widespread sentiment for
acquittals or light sentences.
   Another military lawyer, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the military justice system had become accustomed to
presidential pressure during the 20-year Marcos administration.
   He said that during some major trials in the 1970s, Marcos
himself would monitor proceedings via closed-circuit television and
telephone prosecutors with detailed instructions on arguing the
cases.
   ``That's not done now anymore,'' the lawyer said. ``But if they
(in the Aquino government) want these guys convicted, they will have
to orchestrate it. Give us directives.''

<HEAD>`Vino Novello' _ New Wine _ is Boon to Italy's Wine Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FLORENCE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's ``vino novello'' _ Italy's version of
France's Beaujolias nouveau _ and it has proved a boon to a wine
industry that had been in the doldrums.
   The ``new wine'' was the idea of Piero Antinori, the nobleman and
wine baron, and another producer in 1975 when a flood of low-grade
Chianti had customers turning up their noses at the rustic,
straw-covered red wine flasks.
   The two producers came up dressed-up variation of Chianti called
``vino novello,'' ready for drinking just about six weeks after
harvesting.
   Today, the wine is booming, with production in 1988 estimated 30
million bottles. The Italian wine industry is looking at novello and
other young wines as a way out of the crisis brought on by quality
problems, a tainting scandal and declining demand.
   ``It's been an immense success,'' said Antinori, his gray eyes
twinkling, as he sipped a glass of novello in the 16th-century
Antinori Palace in Florence. ``I was really surprised.''
   Italy is the world's largest wine producer, and its citizens have
a long tradition of washing down hearty meals with equally hearty
amounts of wine.
   But in recent years, domestic consumption has plunged _ from 99
quarts per-capita in 1977 to 63 quarts in 1986, according to
statistics of the European Economic Community.
   Officials say a similar drop is occurring throughout the
Mediterranean as people in busy industrial centers abandon long
lunches.
   ``The basic customs have changed,'' shrugs Ezio Rivella, managing
director of Villa Banfi wines. ``The worker used to do peasant work,
ate badly, and drank wine for energy to work. That doesn't exist
anymore.''
   But that's not all. Italians are increasingly gulping soft drinks
and beer, or simply cutting back on wine in the interest of their
diets.
   ``I even drank mineral water at lunch today,'' Rivella said.
   The change in demand has battered Italian winemakers whose
incomes are also suffering from a worldwide wine glut and a methanol
poisoning scandal in 1986 that crippled Italian exports.
   In an effort to appeal to a more affluent society, winemakers
have come up with a river of new offerings such as novello, fragrant
whites, sparkling wines and fruity reds.
   ``People now want wines that are lighter and fresher,'' says
Antonella Abeti of the Novello Wine Institute, a regulatory body.
Even in the land of pasta, she says, ``people just aren't eating
heavy anymore.''
   Since Antinori and another company, Gaja, began making novello in
1975, 129 other Italian wineries have followed suit _ most in the
past two years.
   Sales of vino novello in 1987, the lastest year for which figures
are available, reached $19 million, according to the Vicenza Fair of
novello producers. An average bottle costs the equivalent of about
$4 in Italy.
   Italians have long produced a harvest wine. But until the French
introduced sophisticated equipment for fermenting young wines three
decades ago, Italian novello was somewhat bitter and did not travel
well.
   It took the publicity-driven success of French Beaujolais nouveau
to persuade the Italians to start mass-producing their own novello.
   Like Beaujolais nouveau, novello not only is ready to drink in
about six weeks, it is made by putting whole grapes into oxygen-free
vats, where the fruit releases carbon dioxide that in turn breaks
down the grapes to produce a fresh, fragrant wine.
   But Italian novello is drier and tarter than Beaujolais nouveau
because of a greater variety of grapes and the addition of some
traditionally fermented wine.
   ``Vino novello represents an important development,'' said
Antinori, whose family has made wine since the 14th century.
   ``But it's not even so much in income. It has perhaps changed
some of the image of young wines. It's also been a help for regions
that have had an image problem.''
   One of those regions was Tuscany, the home of Chianti. In the
late 1960s and 1970s, the quality of much Chianti declined as small
grape plots were supplanted by large estates that planted high-yield
grapes.
   Producers hope that the young wines that have helped revive their
own image will now open up foreign markets.
   While still the largest exporter of wine to the United States and
other large nations, Italy has seen its exports drop from 520
million gallons in 1982 to 312 million gallons in 1987, according to
the most recent government figures.
   Much of the drop stemmed from the methanol scandal, which killed
two dozen people. Another factor was the increasing sophistication
of consumers who turned away from the inexpensive, fizzy wines Italy
traditionally exported.
   What part novello will play in helping Italy recoup its foreign
market is still unclear. It is more expensive than Beaujolais
nouveau and there is neither strict government regulation of how the
wine is made nor preparations for a major foreign advertising
campaign.
   ``The reality of Italian novello wine is becoming stronger and
stronger,'' Antinori said. ``But there's one handicap: novello is an
Italian reality. It hasn't yet crossed the borders.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The vast abandoned steelworks around Pittsburgh
and elsewhere in the Rust Belt are undergoing a metamorphosis, a
``greening of the valley'' as one local planner put it. The grimy
mills are being torn down to make way for industrial parks,
high-tech centers, and even amusement parks, with local governments
putting up much of the money.

   LTV Steel's once-mighty Aliquippa Works,
which hugs the Ohio River for seven miles west of Pittsburgh,
finally is being torn down, yard by rusty yard, and union boss Rich
Vallecorsa is shedding no tears.
   About 8,000 workers once toiled at the plant, turning limestone,
iron ore and coal into America's pipe, wire and tin plate. Only
about 900 workers remain in two small mills that have managed to
prove their profitability in the fickle 1980s.
   But Vallecorsa, president of United Steelworkers Local 1211,
won't fight for the old plant.
   ``Why raise people's hopes? As long as the mill is standing
there, rotting away, there's a false sense of hope it is going to
start again,'' he says.
   Along the 80-mile-long steel valley of the Ohio and Monongahela
rivers, closed plants are being demolished in preparation for their
metamorphosis as industrial parks, high-tech centers and even
amusement parks.
   From Chicago to Buffalo, large manufacturing plants are
undergoing similar transformations.
   ``It's like the greening of the valley,'' says Steve Barrouk,
director of the Allegheny County Industrial Development Authority.
``We're changing from gray to green essentially. We're looking at
open space, clean, light industrial development and some heavier
activity.''
   From 1979 to 1987 more than 67,000 jobs in basic steel and 63,000
jobs in heavy manufacturing were lost in the Pittsburgh area.
Companies closed within days, sometimes overnight, leaving behind
eerie, ghost town-like plants where coats still hung on hooks and
lunch boxes waited to be opened.
   While social service agencies tried to help the displaced
workers, planners turned their attention to the shuttered plants
themselves.
   In particular, they looked at mills in the Monongahela Valley
south of Pittsburgh, the cradle of America's steel industry. For
psychological and economic reasons, they believed the change had to
begin there or the valley, so dependent on steel for so many
decades, would wither.
   ``Around the end of the '70s and the early '80s, we were
experiencing a major shutdown every week,'' Barrouk says. ``The
magnitude was such that it was almost impossible to respond in any
way you thought was adequate.
   ``There were a lot of major facilities in private, corporate
hands, and the companies were not interested in being landlords.''
   Public and private entrepreneurs with a vision stepped in.
Although there's no general, long-term plan for the region, a quiet
renaissance in real estate has emerged. Some examples:
   _Just six miles from downtown Pittsburgh, USX Corp.'s century-old
Homestead Works is being turned into a new alloy of light
manufacturing plants, offices and a riverfront playground with water
slides, a boardwalk and a sandy beach.
   _Within five minutes of downtown Pittsburgh, the former J&amp;L Steel
Corp.'s Hazelwood plant is becoming the city's version of
California's Silicon Valley. Bulldozers have cleared the way for the
Pittsburgh Technology Center, a site for developing robots, computer
programs and research into biotechnology.
   _In Glassport, about 10 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, the former
Copperweld Corp. wire manufacturing plant is the home of 14
companies producing windows, ball bearings, steel rods and
futuristic airbuses.
   _In neighboring McKeesport and Duquesne, USX Corp. last year
turned its National and Duquesne works over to Barrouk's agency in
what is believed to be the nation's largest transfer of industrial
property to local governmental agencies for redevelopment.
   At an international conference on urban renewal, a team of
experts led by Britain's Prince Charles descended upon the valley
last year to examine ways to revitalize the area. In general, their
ideas validated what some private and public developers already had
planned or begun.
   Not everyone has been receptive.
   Those who believe basic steel can bounce back say demolishing
plants such as Homestead is akin to hammering the last nail in the
coffin of the nation's old-fashioned, integrated mills and the
communities that became dependent on them.
   ``In many cases, these facilities were horrendously managed,''
says Bob Erickson of the Steel Valley Authority, which is trying to
maintain steelmaking in the Mon Valley.
   With leaner, smaller operations that can respond more quickly to
changes in the market, some doomed plants still could be producing
steel profitably, Erickson says. In some cases, steel is even being
manufactured on a limited scale at plants that are being demolished,
such as Aliquippa.
   Others, however, point to study after study that have determined
that steelmaking at many of the facilities is no longer feasible.
The future for the sites, they say, is to offer a more diverse mix
of goods and services.
   ``We're going to get jobs back,'' Barrouk says. ``But instead of
one manufacturer that has a club of influence on a community, we're
talking about dozens of manufacturers.''
   Erickson questions whether such sites are truly marketable.
   ``They're unattractive,'' he says. ``They have high taxes, poor
access, bad public service and bad school systems. The locations
aren't conducive to light industry or high technology without a lot
of work being done.''
   Kelly Park, whose company is developing the Homestead Works,
acknowledges it will take millions of dollars to clean the sites of
pollutants and build roads, bridges and sewer and water lines. But
he says once the stage is set, there will be plenty of interested
actors.

   ``You take 100 acres in the Mon Valley and put in sewer and water
lines and it will fill up,'' says Park, vice president of the
Cleveland-based Park Corp.
   For the past year, giant shears have been nibbling away at Andrew
Carnegie's citadel of steel and smoke in Homestead, slowly
demolishing the plant that once employed 15,000 and supplied massive
amounts of armor plate in World War II.
   The Park Corp., which liquidates and recycles industrial
property, bought most of the 3{-mile-long plant from USX for more
than $2.75 million. Kennywood Park, an amusement park, bought the
rest.
   ``If this development happens as we anticipate, I can imagine
streets here with names like Open Hearth Avenue,'' Park says. ``This
is going to be a real showplace, with heavy and light manufacturing
and some commercial and recreational ventures.''
   A brick building that was the site of the bloody 1892 labor
dispute pitting Carnegie's Pinkerton guards against striking
steelworkers _ a battle that set the unionization of steel workers
back 50 years _ may be preserved as an historic landmark.
   A community-based credit union plans to construct a $1 million
building on a former parking lot.
   Park also may restart two mills within the plant, and a local
investment group is trying to buy part of the plant and produce
steel for use in farm equipment, cars and major appliances.
   At one end of the site, bulldozers are clearing brush and debris
and regrading land for the water park, scheduled to open this July.
   Kennywood President Carl Hughes says the park is the brainchild
of an associate who felt that Pittsburgh, nearly 400 miles from the
ocean, needed a beach.
   Not only was the Homestead property available, but it has a
gentle slope and offers a view across the river of a densely wooded
hillside.
   ``I think people are going to be astounded when they see this,''
Hughes says. ``It's such a sylvan setting. It's almost impossible to
imagine it's an old steel mill.''
   Hughes says the park will feature 18 water slides, a boardwalk,
wading pool and a channel for floaters _ this in the midst of a
rough-and-tumble town known more for its food banks and soup
kitchens than recreation.
   If it's successful, he plans to build a large marina and floating
restaurant.
   A few miles upstream, Glassport's fortunes sank with heavy
manufacturing. And in the mid-80s, when the county bought
Copperweld's vacant Glassport plant, the economic climate for
start-up companies didn't appear too bright.
   ``When we walked through the plant, it was the eeriest feeling
because the papers were still on the desks, jackets were still hung
on hooks. Lunch boxes weren't even opened,'' Barrouk says. ``People
were given one-day notice when they left that place. It was like a
neutron bomb. It was just like walking through a ghost town.''
   Using public funds, the county and an incubator group bought the
1-mile-long facility in 1984 for $600,000 and spent $2.5 million to
renovate it.
   Officials hoped they could find tenants within five years. It
took less than two.
   The site houses 13 companies employing about 200 people, most of
whom were hired locally, and the county is considering buying
adjacent property.
   The activity has pumped some life into Glassport itself, says Ron
Stuart, who manages the facility.
   ``Where the restaurants were closed before, people now have
lunch. Rite-Aid is putting in a brand new drugstore down the street
_ the first new building Glassport has seen since Hitler was a
corporal,'' he says.
   Heady with Glassport's success, the county last November bought
two landmark steel mills _ USX Corp.'s National Works in McKeesport
and its sister plant, the Duquesne Works, across the river.
   The 360-acre package cost the county $3.6 million, which won't be
paid until the land is redeveloped and sold.
   Barrouk estimates the cost of redevelopment could reach $40
million.
   In Pittsburgh, the Jones &amp; Laughlin steel mill _ once a symbol of
the city's grimy past _ is perhaps one of the best examples of the
city's clean, new future.
   In 1983, the city and county bought 52 acres for $4 million and,
in conjunction with the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon
University, are redeveloping it to make room for the Pittsburgh
Technology Center, a high-tech industrial park.
   A master plan adopted last year calls for each university o
develop a portion within six to seven years.
   ``We took a calculated gamble,'' says Evans Stoddard of the
city's Urban Redevelopment Authority.
   Stoddard says the high cost of developing the land _ more than
$500,000 an acre _ necessitated public financing.
   ``There's no private developer in the world that's going to do
that,'' he says. ``The only way that can be done is with substantial
subsidy.''
   Stoddard is convinced such ventures are necessary for areas like
Pittsburgh and the Mon Valley to prosper into the next century.
   ``There's a sense of urgency on everyone's part that we have to
get started with this economic transformation and prepare for the
next century,'' he says. ``We can't look back.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Can cancer cells be altered by chemicals to
behave more like normal cells and thus become less lethal? Some
researchers think that's a possibility and recent experiments have
been encouraging. ``We've got gold here,'' said one, ``if we can
mine it appropriately and exploit it.''

   Early experiments with cancer patients are
showing tantalizing results for an unusual therapy: Rather than
killing cancer cells, it seeks to mature them into less recklesse body.
   By prodding cancerous cells out of their immature state of wild
reproduction and toward a more normal specialized form, the
treatment aims to sto
denizens of thp the uncontrolled growth that characterizes
cancer.
   Researchers hope that approach will let them attack cancer cells
that resist current drugs and reduce the serious side effects of
chemotherapy.
   Big obstacles remain before ``differentiation therapy'' could
become part of standard treatment, scientists say. But even
observers not involved in the recent human trials in Europe, Asia
and the United States say they see reason for hope.
   ``As a basic idea, it'sappear anyway.
   Apart from issues of therapy, scientists are looking for help
from basic research. Better drugs may result if researchers can
define just what signals trigger differentiation in normal and
cancerous cells.
   One target for study is oncogenes, malfunctioning versions of
some normal genes, which turn a cell cancerous. Another possibility
has been discovered only recently: suppressor genes, or
anti-oncogenes, which appear to inhibit the transformation to cancer.
   International collaborations of scientists and physicians are now
studying differentiation factors, and the cooperation should shorten
the time needed to develop the potential, says Waxman, who helps
organize annual meetings of differentiation researchers.
   Despite the unanswered questions, researchers say they believe
differentiation drugs may one day play a significant part in the
battle against cancer.
   ``We've got gold here,'' Sartorelli says, ``if we can mine it
appropriately and exploit it.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ After his first book about a sensational murder
case, Joe McGinniss was deluged with letters from people wanting him
to look into other killings. Most of the letters he didn't read. But
he did read one that led him to write ``Blind Faith.'' For
McGinniss, there will be no more books about murders.

   Joe McGinniss says his new book, ``Blind Faith,''
is the last one he will write about a murder case. He's running out
of empathy.
   ``I think my capacity for empathy is over. There is nothing worse
than a writer not feeling as sorry as he should for the people who
are hurting,'' says McGinniss, author of the best-selling ``Fatal
Vision,'' about Jeffrey MacDonald, a Green Beret officer convicted
of killing his pregnant wife and two small children.
   ``Blind Faith'' examines the case of a Toms River, N.J.,
insurance salesman, Robert O. Marshall, deeply in debt from gambling
losses and enamored of the town Jezebel.
   So Marshall decides to hire a hit man to kill his wife, ``the
beautiful Maria'' as he always called her, collect the $1.5 million
in life insurance he had bought for her, then convince his three
teen-age sons that they, too, could learn to love their new
``mother.''
   The book, already bought as a miniseries, is a compelling yarn
that involves hints of corruption in New Jersey, two imported hit
men from Louisiana, forged insurance policies and a town that within
24 hours after the murder turns its back on a pillar of the
community, a leader in the country club set, chairman of United Way.
   ``It was just the opposite of the MacDonald case,'' McGinniss
says. ``All of MacDonald's friends rallied around, convinced he was
innocent.''
   The MacDonald case proved a legal nightmare for McGinniss.
MacDonald sued and McGinniss agreed to pay $325,000 in an
out-of-court settlement. However, following complicated litigation,
MacDonald collected only $50,000 for himself, plus $92,000 in legal
fees. A judge ordered that some of the money should go to the mother
of his murdered wife as well as MacDonald's mother.
   McGinniss maintains that he, too, believed the Green Beret
innocent until he started to examine the evidence. He then
concluded, and let his book reflect, that MacDonald was indeed the
man who wiped out his family.
   Except for the principals, McGinniss uses pseudonyms in ``Blind
Faith'' for the other characters, although the real names are all
part of the public record.
   Considered an ideal couple with three blond sons, the Marshalls
were teasingly called Ken and Barbie by their friends.
   McGinniss says he sort of stumbled onto the book when a Toms
River woman, a stranger to him, wrote him a long letter shortly
after the murder.
   ``She had about 90 percent of it right two months after the
murder,'' he says. ``The letter was very compelling.''
   McGinniss says he doesn't know why he even read the letter. After
``Fatal Vision'' went on the air in 1984 as a two-part miniseries,
he was deluged with letters from people asking him to write a book
about some murder or the other.
   ``I got hundreds of letters from people whose second cousin was
murdered or from someone who was beaten up in a barroom brawl and
they wanted me to write a book about it,'' he says. ``I was just
throwing them away.
   ``What first interested me about the Marshall case was what kind
of a place was this where a guy who had lived there 20 years, this
pillar of the community, was automatically presumed guilty by his
friends within 24 hours of the murder.
   ``I was also interested in doing something about the social mores
of a town in the '80s, particularly a town that didn't have any kind
of distinctive identity. It seemed to be a town transformed by
materialism.
   ``It was also a book about these three boys and how they coped
when they learned their mother, truly beloved by them, was dead and
then they heard their father is a suspect and then they see him
convicted.''
   McGinniss' first book, ``The Selling of the President,'' became a
best seller 20 years ago when he was 26. The book chronicled how
Richard Nixon defeated the late Hubert H. Humphrey.
   ``The difference between illusion and reality has always been a
theme of mine,'' McGinniss says. ``Here the illusion was Good
Housekeeping come to life. Maria bought that whole ideal, that she
was an ornament attached to the husband, that her job was to give
them a happy home. For that, she paid with her life.''
   For the children _ 13, 16 and 17 at the time of the murder _ it
was a fairy-tale life of Mustangs and Jeeps, swim meets and country
club lunches with Mom and Dad.
   ``This is not a story about their father,'' McGinniss says. ``I'm
not interested in exploring the recesses of his mind like I was with
MacDonald. I'm interested in the story of how these kids grappled
with the worst sort of shock. There was a monster under their bed
and it was their father. And they had to look him in the eye and not
blink. It stripped them of every illusion they ever had.''
   The youngest boy, John, still does not believe his father is
guilty.

   ``When I talked to them John was still desperately clinging like
a little boy lost at sea to the only thing he had left,'' McGinniss
says.
   The other two, Chris and Roby, believe their father had their
mother killed, a mother who put notes in their lunches, always
kissed them goodbye, and fixed them pancakes for breakfast even when
they got up at 11 a.m. She was Super Mom. They will not answer their
father's letters nor speak to him.
   ``They feel their father is already dead,'' says McGinniss.
   The father is on death row in Trenton, N.J., awaiting the outcome
of appeals. He still proclaims his innocence, clinging to a story
that he pulled into a secluded rest stop on the Jersey State Parkway
to check on a leaking tire and someone hit him over the head and
then shot Maria, leaving two bullet holes so close you could cover
them with a 50-cent coin. Marshall claims he was robbed of his
Atlantic City winnings and then staggered onto the highway to get
help.
   The tire, which was slashed after it was parked, showed no
evidence of a slow leak and there were brightly lit places within a
few miles he could have stopped.
   Then there was the mistress he planned to marry. He had bought
yet another life insurance policy, this one for $100,000, that very
day. Maria's signature had been forged on various documents to raise
cash
   Prosecutors presented evidence linking him to the Louisiana hired
guns. One of them was granted immunity to testify. The other,
accused of being the actual shooter, was acquitted by the jury that
found Marshall guilty. Another man, who acted as go-between during
the negotiations, received a life sentence for conspiracy to commit
murder.
   McGinniss hints in the book that the prosecutor's office could
have taken another tack which would have involved more people, but
he won't say much more about it.
   ``If I wanted to write a book about organized crime in New
Jersey, I could have, but I think it would have been less
interesting than what these boys are going through,'' he says.
``Political corruption is everywhere. What is unique is the
situation these three kids find themselves in. Their love has kept
them very close even though they all viewed the case differently at
first.''
   Chris was the first to feel his father was guilty. Roby was next,
spurred on by a jail house call in which his father asked him to lie
the next day on the witness stand. Roby would not do it.
   The children received some of the insurance money, as the heirs,
and will receive more. Roby is moving to California to help with the
miniseries based on the book.
   ``Although this was another murder, it was completely different
from `Fatal Vision,''' McGinniss says. ``The town of Toms River was
sort of a metaphor for the blind faith we all have in the American
dream. But how thin is that veneer? How much of what passes for
social intercourse in America is sheer hypocrisy? Toms River is a
good example of this superficialty of cocktail and dinner parties
and country clubs where everybody finds it necessary to stay on top.
I didn't feel like I was repeating myself.''
   McGinniss says his next book will be about Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, the man. He has been negotiating with Kennedy, but does not
yet know whether Kennedy will cooperate with him.
   ``I want to do this because I have no sense of what it must be
like to have had this extraordinary life, of being the little
brother and having everything handed to you and then become the
family spokesman,'' McGinniss says. ``This will not be a book about
Chappaquiddick. It will be about the man and his life.''
   After ``The Selling of the President,'' McGinniss tried his hand
at a novel, ``The Dream Team,'' not one of his great successes, but
he says he will do another novel some day.
   He wrote ``Heroes'' in 1975 and lived in Alaska for one year to
write ``Going to Extremes,'' published in 1980. He has also taught
fiction and non-fiction writing at Bennington College.
   McGinniss and his wife, Nancy Doherty, live in a small town in
western Massachusetts and have two children. He also has three
children from a previous marriage.
   ``Blind Faith'' was selected by Book-of-the-Month Club and
Reader's Digest Condensed Books. Additional subsidiary rights
include a seven-figure reprint sale to New American Library, serial
rights to ``Rolling Stone'' and ``Ladies' Home Journal,'' and film
rights to NBC-TV for a four-hour miniseries.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ There was a time when Louisiana's Cajuns were
spanked at school if they spoke French. All that has changed in a
resurgence of pride in Cajun culture, a culture that is celebrated
in the ``Rendez-Vous Des Cajuns,'' a two-hour program of music and
humor that is broadcast live every Saturday night from a restored
vaudeville theater. No English is spoken there.

   The foot-stomping and fiddling inside the old
Eunice vaudeville theater spoke of a packed house for the Cajun
version of Prairie Home Companion.
   They lined up around the block, ignoring a tornado watch and
gully-washing rain to purchase tickets for a show where no English
was spoken except for brief opening remarks by a uniformed park
ranger.
   For more than a year now, the crowds have been filling the
700-seat Liberty Theater every Saturday night for a live two-hour
show broadcast locally, regionally and at several points in the
nation on a delayed basis.
   The music, the humor and the recitations of spicy recipes by
guest chefs are in Cajun French, which is based on a language spoken
in the 18th century.
   The Acadians were exiled from Nova Scotia by the British in 1755
and 10 years later many had found their way to the swampy coasts and
inland prairies of south Louisiana. Others went to inland Canada and
Maine.
   ``The tape of this show is being sent to public radio in Maine
and New Brunswick,'' says Mayor Curtis Joubert, who led a local
movement to save the three-story brick Liberty Theater from
destruction once it finally closed as a movie house in 1982.
   Built in 1924, the Liberty was the tiny town's chief window into
a world filled with vaudeville comedians, actors, singers and
ultimately the movies.
   Joubert, a retired high school principal and veteran politician,
sweet-talked the citizens into buying the building. Next, he used
his charms on the National Park Service, which entered into a joint
venture with Eunice.
   Town residents helped restore the gaudy grandeur of the old
theater, tearing down rotted curtains that had covered original
ceiling-to-floor murals, one a painted Carmen dancing with a
tambourine. Moldings were regilded, chandeliers cleaned and floors
scrubbed of more than 50 years of accumulated wax and dirt,
revealing sparkling green-and-white ceramic-pieced floors.
   An old organ with wooden pipes, now valued by the Historical
Organ Society at $25,000, was found under a pile of debris.
   The theater is part of the Jean Lafitte National Park, which is a
series of places scattered around south Louisiana, including the New
Orleans French Quarter.
   Construction was set to begin earlier this month on a $3 million
Acadian Culture Center, adjacent to the theater. It is scheduled to
open sometime next year.
   The Jean Lafitte National Park chose the Liberty Theater as a
site for an interpretive center for the Prairie Cajun culture. The
city signed a cooperative agreement with the National Park Service
which uses the theater for its living history presentations.
   ``That the city of Eunice is now the site for a national park
boggles the minds of many of the people in this rural area,''
Joubert says.
   Also, a state-of-the-art sound system is being installed that
will allow larger radio stations to air the program.
   ``They demand quality sound and we'll have it,'' Joubert says.
   The heart of the Liberty is the ``Rendez-Vous Des Cajuns,'' which
features Cajun bands, from the famous to youngsters just getting
started on the traditional sound that was isolated along with the
French heritage until the late 1960s.
   ``In my generation we were spanked at school if we spoke
French,'' recalls Joubert. ``There was a sense of shame in being
Cajun. We kept the music to ourselves.''
   In less than 20 years, the state has brought back that heritage
with a bang, offering French courses in elementary schools with many
teachers from France. Chefs have traveled the world touting the food.
   No one represents the new wave of Cajun culture better than Dr.
Barry Ancelet, the 37-year-old humorist who hosts the show, boasts
Joubert.
   Ancelet is a specialist in folklore at the University of
Southwestern Louisiana and did his doctoral dissertation on Cajun
humor.
   ``I would die in English because the tone of voice, the melody
and the vocal pattern are so important in humor,'' Ancelet says.
``The humor here is not the slick Johnny Carson type. It's more
earthy and rural. There's a lot of hunting and fishing stories. And
here they poke fun at prominent people in the community.''
   When the show started in the summer of 1987, Ancelet says he was
pleasantly surprised to find that the 20 percent to 25 percent of
the audience who didn't speak the language were laughing.
   ``We'll get someone in from Wyoming or Tennessee who will nudge
the fellow next to him and ask what I said. The Cajun must be
interpreting well because the tourist laughs. They'll get into a
conversation, get to know each other. There's a twofold victory
here. The tourist gets his money's worth. He came down here to see
Cajun culture. In the Liberty, he talks with them, dances with them.
The Cajun sees that his native knowledge is thereby valued. He feels
good about himself.''
   Ancelet says he sees the show as an extension of his classroom.
   ``I call it guerrilla academics. I have the opportunity to talk
to 700 people and while they are being entertained I get to slip
information to them about who they are, where they came from, why
they are the way they are.''
   The show stirs some of the younger people, especially musicians,
to learn the French language.
   ``The musicians are learning that it's not just enough to mouth
French words,'' Ancelet says. ``They need to understand what the
words mean to make the song live.''
   A local committee whose members' identities are kept secret to
avoid pressure chooses the bands for each show from a long list of
applicants.
   ``The committee tries to encourage new talent and yet bring in
the well-known bands from time to time,'' the mayor says. ``We'll
never run out of musicians.''
   Until the Liberty Theater opened, the younger generation didn't
get much opportunity to hear Cajun music because the bands were
performing in nightclubs, he says.
   ``We've been portrayed so many times as a bunch of drunks falling
off horses at Mardi Gras,'' he says. ``Here's a soft drink and
popcorn crowd on Saturday night, a family-oriented crowd enjoying
life and the good things we have to offer in Acadiana.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The committee that chose the new president of
Brown University was looking for someone with a record of academic
excellence, says the head of the panel, ``and it wouldn't hurt if
they could also raise money and walk on water.'' The man they chose
was Vartan Gregorian, a veteran educator with a flair for healing
ailing budgets.

   Vartan Gregorian is an ebullient Armenian
who rejuvenated the New York Public Library in a flurry of fund
raising. Brown University is a 224-year-old Ivy League institution
with dwindling donations and an iconoclastic curriculum.
   Brown, with an enrollment of 7,000, has a $370 million endowment,
the lowest among Ivy League colleges. Massachusett's Harvard
University, by comparison, has a $3 billion endowment.
   Gregorian, who will be inaugurated as Brown's 16th president on
April 9, is a curly-haired, round-faced workaholic who rescued the
New York library from a financial crisis by raising nearly $500
million in his seven years there.
   ``I've always favored the underdog,'' says Gregorian, 54. ``Brown
has always had to do more with less.''
   Gregorian, who took over the duties of former president Howard R.
Swearer on Jan. 1, has 22 years experience as a teacher and as a
provost at the University of Pennsylvania. But he acknowledges that
his fund-raising ability ``was not held against him.''
   Brown, now in the final year of a three-year fund-raising drive,
saw gifts drop from $51.3 million in 1986-87 to $35.1 million in
1987-88, according to Samuel Babbit, vice president for development.
   While he may become involved in fund-raising, Gregorian says his
``primary obligation will be to the academic welfare of the
institution.''
   ``It's the educational challenge that has brought me here,'' he
says.
   Brown was one of the first major colleges in the turbulent 1960s
to do away with most general requirements. Today, it's one of the
last to resist returning to the more traditional program of core
courses.
   Gregorian, who holds a doctorate in history and humanities from
Stanford University, is concerned with the over-specialization among
students at many colleges.
   He wants college not only to ``give students training, but to
give them an education; not just an education but to instill them
with culture _ with breadth of scope, so they can adapt in these
difficult times to a fast-changing world.''
   ``Curriculum is not a frozen document,'' Gregorian says. He plans
to study records for the full 19 years of the ``new'' curriculum
before deciding if he will change its direction.
   ``Brown's success is the flexibility of its curriculum as it
enables students to respond to their needs,'' he says. ``This
one-dimensional or narrow professionalism reduces people's
intellectual curiosity and brings a narrow range.
   ``We must teach people how to cope, not with success alone, but
with adversity and failure. Out of failure and adversity there is a
lot you learn.''
   Gregorian knows of both. He left the University of Pennsylvania
for the library in 1981 after being passed over for the university's
presidency.
   A native of Iran who was educated in Beirut, he says he missed
academia during his time in New York.
   ``One of the things I missed in the years at the library, I
didn't have time to read or write,'' says Gregorian, the author of
three books. ``One of the tragedies is to sit on the mountain of
knowledge and not have time to get to it.''
   Gregorian, who plans to teach a freshman course so he can set
``an example that teaching and leadership are not mutually
exclusive,'' says his first priority will be faculty recruitment,
nationally and internationally.
   ``Two-thirds of the American professors will be retiring in the
next 10 years,'' he says.
   While Gregorian will focus on the faculty, his reputation is with
the students.
   A faculty adviser to two dormitories at Penn, he often dined with
the students. He says he hopes to continue that practice at Brown.
   ``I'll be getting to know the students, whether they'd like to
know me...,'' he jokes.
   Officials on the Brown search committee, which chose Gregorian
among 200 applicants, looked for a scholar-educator, according to
committee head Martha Nussbaum, a philosophy professor.
   ``We wanted to find someone who had experience doing research and
a high level of excellence _ and it wouldn't hurt if they could also
raise money and walk on water,'' she says.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Among the cruelest ironies of AIDS are its
innocent victims, inheritors of a fatal, incurable disease, and the
scorn of those who fear its contagion. Here is the story of Jason,
one of those.

   A lonely yellow stick character, arms
outstretched, looks down at 8-year-old Jason Robertson from a poster
in his kitchen.
   ``I have AIDS,'' the poster says. ``Please hug me. I can't make
you sick.''
   As if it were Jason speaking.
   Jason suffers from AIDS-related complex, or ARC, a disease that
often precedes the fatal full-blown acquired immune deficiency
syndrome. At school, he was isolated in a trailer next door to the
classroom, and his only real friend was a tattered doll named Mick.
   Jason's story is similar to the plight of Indiana's Ryan White,
an AIDS victim shunned at school and forced to leave town.
   Jason is the only student in the school trailer.
   He has endured a lawsuit and a move from nearby Granite City to
this tiny, Southern Illinois community in search of peace. Phone
calls playing funeral music and taunts added to the scorn.
   Now his mother, Tammie, father, Al, and 10-year-old sister,
Melissa, are picking up the pieces after a struggle that turned
neighbor against neighbor in a battle over Jason's future.
   Jason weighs only 46 pounds and stands about 4 feet tall. His
most striking features are his big brown eyes. A quiet boy, he
answers most questions with few words.
   ``I like good people,'' Jason says. ``I like to go places.''
   When he grows up, he says, he wants to be a police officer.
   Jason was born with hemophilia, a condition in which the blood
fails to clot properly. He also had stomach problems and a shortened
esophagus _ problems that were corrected by surgery.
   But he underwent hundreds of blood transfusions, and at least one
of them involved tainted blood products that brought the deadly AIDS
virus into his body. In March 1986, Jason was diagnosed with ARC.
   That was the beginning. Now the family, its former school
district and neighbors wish they had done some things differently.
   Fearing he would endanger other children, his mother pulled him
from kindergarten in Granite City and a district tutor taught him at
home until November 1987.
   That's when the Robertsons and the school district agreed that
Jason should be taught in a special trailer 50 feet from regular
classes.
   Jason started school 15 minutes before the other students every
day and left 15 minutes later than they did. He was not allowed on
the playground.
   School officials say they told Mrs. Robertson that Jason probably
would be placed in regular classes at the school of 750 in the fall
of 1988 because his health had improved.
   But Mrs. Robertson contends the district made the offer only
after the American Civil Liberties Union, at her request, filed a
lawsuit on Jason's behalf in April.
   On May 5, a federal judge ordered Jason back into regular
classes. But the ruling touched off protests from parents in Granite
City, a steel town of 36,800 across the Mississippi River from St.
Louis.
   Angry parents chanted, ``Back to the trailer!'' upon his arrival.
   Drew Callender, 29, says he got into the fight because of anger
and fear for his children's safety. ``I did say some foolish
things.'' He also founded an informal group of protesting parents
called ``SAVE,'' the Society Against Virus Environment.
   ``It's a fear of not knowing,'' he says.
   Mrs. Robertson says she got up to three telephone calls a day
from protesters, threatening her and Jason. People hurled epithets
on the street. ``Home had become a war zone, and I felt like I was
dying inside,'' she says.

   Her former neighbors insist they never heard anyone harass the
Robertson family, and they say the family had an unlisted phone
number.
   ``If she would have just kept her mouth shut instead of going and
going and going, she wouldn't have any problem,'' says Maggie
Rigsby, 68, a former next-door neighbor of the Robertsons.
   ``She just couldn't stay out of the TV and the newspaper and it
just made a mess,'' she says. ``I don't think people should be
harassed, but she asked for a lot of this stuff.''
   Ms. Rigsby, who lives with her 8-year-old granddaughter, says she
would not want her to get near Jason. She opposed his entry into
regular classes. ``It's too contagious, and I don't know enough
about it.''
   ``Nobody harassed her in this neighborhood,'' says Alice Perkins,
34, who lived next door to the family for nearly 10 years. ``There
was no vigilante group.
   ``She's trying to write a book and she wants a grand finale about
Granite City. I'm glad she's moved because someone else can have all
this fun that we had.''
   With family permission, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch printed the
phone number.
   To protest state cuts in funding for hemophiliacs, Mrs. Robertson
contacted two newspapers, including the Post-Dispatch, and the
family's life became public record.
   ``I did not comprehend that it would be this big of an issue,''
says Mrs. Robertson. ``Maybe we made some mistakes. I was doing what
was best for my kids.''
   Stu Mills, the Granite City district's supervisor of special
educational programs, described her as ``volatile.'' She often
initiated confrontations. But he said he had sympathy for any parent
in Mrs. Robertson's situation.
   He said that the mother of an AIDS child thinks she has special
license to say whatever she wants, even characterizing one town as
the good guys and the other the bad.
   Mrs. Robertson says the family decided to leave Granite City
after a man accosted her and hit her on the head with a stick.
   They moved to South Roxana, a oil refinery town of 2,300 nearby,
to the home where Jason's father, who manages a plastics company,
grew up. It was a good move for Jason.
   ``He just smiles all over,'' says Sharon Waters, a teacher's aide
and registered nurse hired for Jason's second-grade room at the
375-student South Roxana Elementary School.
   ``His little eyes just dance; they talk more than he does,'' she
says. ``I think he's happy. Just to see him play, like when he gets
the right answer, he gets real excited.''
   At first, she said, Jason didn't know how to deal with his
classmates, because he had had only limited contact with children
his age for nearly two years. But they encouraged him and in days he
made friends.
   South Roxana Principal Dorothy Stickels calls Jason an ``average
second-grader'' in a class of 24. His writing has improved and he
seldom misses school, she said. ``I see him every morning with his
back pack and a smile on his face.''
   But the school lost eight students because of Jason's attendance.
Fear of AIDS again.
   Jason's mother says her new neighbors are quick to offer support.
``They said, `We want you to stop running. Make this your home.'''
she said.
   Many of the new neighbors seem knowledgeable about AIDS, which
cripples the body's defenses against disease and leaves the victim
prey to infections and cancer. It is both incurable and fatal, but
cannot be spread casually. It can be passed on by contact with
infected blood or by sexual contact.
   Jason doesn't talk often about his disease, or his experience in
Granite City, his mother says, although his hurt has spilled over to
the family's new life in South Roxana. Once, hurt, he was crying and
asked, ``Doesn't God know I am sick?''
   It hasn't been easy for Jason's sister either. Frustrated and
confused, she needed counseling.
   Now, Jason feels more at home. His kitchen poster ends with the
words, ``Love may be the hardest thing to get.''

   The Rev. Bobby Joe Stuckey takes over his
father's television evengelism empire in HBO's ``Glory, Glory'' and
is soon up to his halo in trouble, just like...well, some recent
headline-makers.
   But Richard Thomas, who stars as Bobby Joe, insists that the
script for the 3{-hour musical comedy was written long before Jim
and Tammy Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart became household names.
   ``The script's been around for a while,'' says Thomas,
best-remembered as John Boy on the TV series ``The Waltons.'' ``We
filmed it last summer in Toronto. It more or less started as an
examination of the phenomenon of television evangelism.''
   The story originated in 1981 with co-executive producer Bonny
Dore, who had worked briefly with evangelist Oral Roberts in
polishing his broadcasts.
   ``If I felt the film was taking cheap shots at someone's faith I
never would have done it,'' Thomas says. At the center, Stuckey is a
man of true faith but he's been seduced into straying. He can speak
for the importance of spirituality, but all institutions are subject
to compromise and corruption.''
   The movie, directed by Lindsay Anderson (``The Whales of
August,'' ``O Lucky Man'') will premiere on Sunday.
   Bobby Joe is a biblical scholar totally lacking in the star
quality his father used to turn his little church into a television
empire. He's earnest but dull, and the ratings start to tumble. In
desperation, he turns to a down-and-out rock singer who becomes the
charismatic Sister Ruth. The ratings and the donations reach
unprecedented levels with Sister Ruth.
   But behind the altar, unknown to Bobby Joe, she's leading a life
of Sodom and Gamorrah. He's deeply in love with her, and when it
comes crashing down he's the candidate for a pillar of salt.
   Ellen Greene stars as Sister Ruth, Winston Rekert as an
investigative reporter, James Whitmore as a church elder and Barry
Morse as Bobby Joe's father, the Rev. Dan Stuckey.
   ``When they called me they said the part was for a nice,
clean-cut preacher,'' Thomas says. ``Some things you do because
they're radically different from what you've done before. Some you
do because they're familiar. This was familiar, but I liked the way
it was written. It's satire without taking cheap shots.
   ``He compromises himself with this woman, and before he knows it
he's trapped in a web of deceit and conspiracy.''
   In February, Thomas goes to the Hartford Stage in Connecticut for
``Peer Gynt.'' He will appear in a new translation of Henrik Ibsen's
seven-hour play, which will be presented over two nights. The
six-week run will keep him there until May.
   ``I played `Hamlet' there in 1987,'' Thomas says. ``That's
Shakespeare's longest play and this is a thousand lines longer than
`Hamlet.' Many people consider the play to be Ibsen's masterpiece.''
   Thomas spends much of his time teaching classes at colleges
across the country.
   ``And, with any luck, I'll get another TV movie or two,'' he
says. ``That's how it works out. I don't have the most expensive
habits. A TV movie will take care of my expenses so I can do theater
and teach. Then when I'm at home it's a full-time job for my wife
and I to look after four kids.''
   Thomas left ``The Waltons'' in 1977. The immensely popular series
that ran on CBS from 1972-81 was based on Earl Hamner's
reminiscences about his boyhood in Virginia, in 1977.
   ``I'd love it if we had a reunion show,'' Thomas says, ``but only
Earl could write it. He's a sly fox with a deliciously wicked sense
of humor. He's as much a country bumpkin as Donald Trump.''
   As for another series, Thomas says he would certainly consider
it. ``But a series takes up so much of your time it would have to be
something I absolutely loved,'' he says. ``I prefer plays, but I'm
an actor. The material comes first. If it's right I'll go anywhere
and work in any medium.
   ``I have been lucky as an actor. I've always gotten work. I've
never had to wait by the phone. Too many actors regard the theater
as some place you go to stretch, as though it was an aerobics class.
Or they say it's their duty to go back, as though it were an
obligation like having tea with a maiden aunt. When people see me in
a film they see my work. But when they see me on stage they see me
work.''
   Thomas recently observed 30 years as a professional actor. He
made his debut in 1958 at the age of 7 in ``Sunrise at Campobello.''
He played the youngest of Franklin Roosevelt's children, John. That
same year he made his television debut in ``A Christmas Tree'' for
the Hallmark Hall of Fame.

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a large, unfinished room on the third
floor of a downtown office tower, a stocky, intense man sits on a
piano bench and stares at a cardboard stage setting.
   Three actors work their way through a scene as the man follows
their movements. He listens to their voices and checks their
reactions to each other.
   The scene is repeated, again and again. Between repetitions, the
observer, shadowed by an interpreter, jumps up and walks over to the
makeshift scenery to demonstrate what he wants.
   Director Yuri Yeremin, who doesn't speak English, is rehearsing
an American cast, which doesn't speak Russian, in a hit Soviet play
at the Hartford Stage Company. The rehearsal process, which will
last four weeks, is slow but cordial. It's theatrical glasnost in
the making, a unique cultural collaboration made possible by the
thaw in Soviet-American relations.
   The Hartford Stage experiment occurred after its artistic
director Mark Lamos traveled to the Soviet Union last year to direct
a Soviet production of Eugene O'Neill's ``Desire Under the Elms'' at
Moscow's Pushkin Drama Theater which Yeremin runs. It was a first
for an American director. Now Yeremin has returned the favor.
   The drama he is directing is Alexander Chervinsky's ``The Paper
Gramophone.'' It is on view at the Hartford Stage through March 18.
Before the recent liberalization of Soviet life under Mikhail
Gorbachev, the play couldn't have been performed in the Soviet Union
in its original version.
   ``The Paper Gramophone,'' which is set in the Stalinist era of
1948, deals with the awkward romance between a young girl and a
naval cadet. Chervinsky's play was written as a film script in 1980
but never was produced because of its criticism of Stalin.
   With Yeremin's help, Chervinsky adapted ``The Paper Gramophone''
for the stage eight years ago. It opened at the Central Academy
Theater of the Soviet Army in Moscow, but was closed quickly by
Soviet authorities.
   Changes were made in script, and the play was allowed to reopen.
   ``The press was so good that it is still running,'' said Yeremin,
speaking through an interpreter. ``The Paper Gramophone'' remains in
the repertory of the Central Academy Theater where it is performed
several times each month.
   ``During those years of stagnation, the theater was probably the
only place where you could hear a word of truth,'' Yeremin says.
   For the American version, Yeremin has rewritten the play again,
going back to the original screenplay. He has also made it clearer
for American audiences who aren't familiar with the details of
Soviet life and politics.
   Yeremin found some details of American theater rehearsal and
production different, to say the least. One he even found
``painful.'' In the Soviet Union, the artistic director of a theater
rules. He chooses the actors from his own company for specific
roles. There are no auditions.
   ``On the one hand, I like auditions a great deal because the
director has more choice,'' Yeremin says. ``You can look for what
you really need. On the other hand, I think the theater is a family.
So there are other considerations _not just whether the actors fit a
given role, but also that you speak the same language, you have the
same asthetic and the same creative outlook. To me, a production is
always an ensemble. In the Soviet Union, it was easily solved
because we have worked together for years.''
   That wasn't the case in Hartford, where Yeremin chose two
unknowns, Ann Dowd and Ray Virta, for the romantic leads. He was
pleased with the quality of the actors who auditioned and was
particularly taken with Miss Dowd and Virta who, the director says,
``looks very Russian.''
   During the rehearsal session, the director, the actors, the
Hartford Stage production team and the theater's dramaturg Greg
Leaming sit at a long table. Miss Dowd, Virta and a third cast
member, Kathleen Chalfant, go over another scene.
   Yeremin urges Virta to improvise. The actor complies,
embellishing a speech by the young man. The director also tells the
dramaturge different dialogue is needed to clarify a situation.
   The script, on this third day of rehearsal, remains very fluid.
Although he makes the final decision, Yeremin likes to have input
from his actors and, with the author's permission, has them create
their own dialogue.
   ``I think it is very unfortunate that in many instances the actor
is turned into nothing but a performer,'' the director says. ``It's
as if we are denying the actors the authorship of their creativity.''
   Yeremin has even improvised with the work of one of the world's
greatest authors, Anton Chekhov, adapting his short story, ``Ward
Number Six,'' for the stage by allowing actors to improvise for 90
minutes based on specific ideas and topics from the story.
   Yeremin feels ``The Paper Gramophone'' has universal appeal,
transcending its Soviet origins, and that's why he chose it for
American audiences.
   ``I found that in the fates of the people who inhabit this play
there is much in common with people everywhere,'' he says. ``It is a
story of first love, great dreams and the tragic pressure of the
time and the breaking through to other spiritual spaces, shall we
say. The play is full of humor but next to the comedy, there's
tragedy.''
   The idea of an exchange of Soviet and American directors evolved
in 1986 when Yeremin took over the Puskin Theater. He thought it
would be interesting to have an O'Neill play directed by an
American. Through an organization called the Theater International
Exchange Service and its director Edith Markson, he found Lamos.
   ``I never thought that Soviet actors could come up with a
production in four and a half weeks,'' says Yeremin, referring to
Lamos' 1988 production of O'Neill at the Pushkin.
   In the Soviet Union, directors rehearse a lot longer, Yeremin
says. It's an average of six months but sometimes longer, depending
on when the director thinks his production is ready for an audience.
   At the Pushkin Theater, where a season of three or four plays
usually runs from about the middle of September until the end of
May, Yeremin has just opened a production of ``Possessed'' by Camus,
based on the Dostoyevsky novel. When he returns to Moscow, he will
continue rehearsals of his next production, ``The Gospel According
to Mikhail,'' based on several chapters from the Bulgakov novel,
``The Master and Margarita.''
   ``I have no hobbies, no other interests,'' the 44-year-old
Yeremin says. ``Directing is all that concerns me. Only theater.
Everything that doesn't have anything to do with theater bores me to
tears, except life itself, which is the food of what art is.''

   An American inventor and wildlife
researchers at Kruger National Park say they have achieved a major
breakthrough in conservation _ an immunization system that can stop
epidemics in free-ranging animals.
   The breakthrough is the bio-bullet, a vaccine in a biodegradable
projectile that can be fired by an air rifle from a helicopter. It
has been used for three years to immunize animals ranging from
warthogs to elephants against diseases that have nearly wiped out
species in the park, a 7,800-square-mile reserve.
   Anthrax is endemic in the northern part of the park, an area
where 200 rare roan antelope roam. Before 1970, when the park began
an inoculation program by firing disposable darts at the animals
from the air, severe outbreaks had affected most of the herd animals.
   ``If we have another major outbreak, we have a method now of
controlling the epidemic,'' said Valerius de Vos, head of research
at Kruger. ``I consider this a major breakthrough. ... It will be
used widely in the future.''
   How widely depends to some extent on politics. While South
Africa's wildlife management program is regarded as the best on the
continent, its experts seldom visit other African countries where
similar problems exist. Black African governments restrict contact
with South Africa because of apartheid, its system of racial
separation.
   ``It's a pity,'' de Vos said. ``The rest of Africa needs us and
we need them. We've got expertise and we need interaction.''
   For instance, the numbers of endangered black rhinos are
increasing in South Africa but declining elsewhere. Due to South
African conservation efforts, the white rhino was removed from the
endangered category worldwide.
   Representatives of private wildlife groups sometimes come to
South Africa, and exchanges take place by mail, but many Western
universities won't send copies of research papers to Kruger's
scientists.
   Gus Mills, the chief predator researcher, made a tape recording
of hyena territorial cries and plays it from a jeep at night.
   ``All the hyena in the area come around to listen and we can
count them,'' he said. ``I've sent my tape to Kenya and now Kenyan
hyenas are listening to South African hyenas.''
   De Vos said the air-rifle that fires the bio-bullet can be
locally produced, but not the bullet itself. He worries what
sanctions could disrupt the immunization program.
   There has been talk of banning shipments of four-wheel drive
vehicles to South Africa from Japan, because they have military
potential.
   ``That's going to affect us,'' de Vos said. ``I don't know what
we're going to do, but I guess we can keep going with two-wheel
drive vehicles.''
   In 1973 de Vos and his team began inoculating large mammals by
firing dart-syringes from the air. Disadvantages included large
numbers of plastic darts left on the ground, and the time and cost
of manufacturing the syringes.
   De Vos found Fred Paul, an inventor from White Bear Lake, Minn.,
who had developed the bio-bullet and used it to vaccinate domestic
livestock and wild bighorn sheep. Paul came to Kruger Park to assist
the research, which includingfiring different-sized bullets at
varying velocities until the right size and shape were determined.
   The bullet can be fired rapidly, allowing marksmen to inoculate
about 1,500 animals a day with 80 percent accuracy. The material, a
cellulose polymer, dissolves inside the animal, releasing the
vaccine.
   Vaccinating 1,500 animals a day with 80 percent accuracy is
``impressive, to say the least. ... That's a lot of animals,'' said
Maurice LeFranc, director of the Institute for Wildlife Research, a
branch of National Wildlife Federation in the United States.
   The South African park lends itself to such an effort because it
has wide open spaces and concentrations of animals, LeFranc said in
Vienna, Va.
   The project illustrates the place that South African wildlife
researchers have in the forefront of species preservation and the
National Park Board's philosophy about when to let nature take its
course and when man should intervene.
   ``South Africa has taken a real strong leadership in the
preservation and conservation of their wildlife,'' said Dr. Werner
Heuschele, an endangered species specialist at the San Diego Zoo in
California. ``Some of their game parks are among the best managed in
the world.''
   One researcher at Kruger is capturing impala to find a cure for a
human-caused stress disease that occurs when antelope are chased for
long distances and caught in a net. In the wild, predators chase
impalas only for short distances.
   The main form of research at Kruger is surveillance _ taking
aerial photos of vegetation, counting animals, taking blood levels
of elephants to see if car exhaust affects them. The data is fed
into computers to help determine what projects are needed in the
park, a fenced area the size of Massachusetts.
   Roads affect the natural spread of fire, so controlled fires are
set deliberately. Fenced animals cannot migrate during drought, so
dams are built.
   In the early 1970s, wildebeest rapidly diminished. A new fence
around the park had cut off one herd's traditional migration route,
and heavy rainfall encouraged long grass, rather than the short
grass the wildebeest like.
   Managers could have set fires to eliminate the tall grass.
Instead, they decided to kill off lions and hyenas who preyed on the
wildebeest.
   To prevent the need for such action in the future, Mills and his
team spend two weeks at a time following lions, cheetah and
leopards, to monitor their eating habits.
   ``Are they depressing the prey in large numbers or living in
harmony with their environment?'' Mills says researchers want to
know.
   Although anthrax and foot-and-mouth disease are natural African
diseases, they are controlled because it would take 20 to 30 years
for the herds to recover after an endemic.
   ``Drastic fluctuations in animal populations are part of nature,
but we can't afford that,'' said de Vos.
   ``We cull (shoot) buffalo and elephant, and sometimes hippo.
These are species that can outgrow the system. The rest of the
animals are controlled by the system. Drought, predation, disease
all act as controls. For the buffalo and elephant the main predator
in the past was man. We have taken man out of it, so now we're
bringing man back in, in a controlled way.''

   Scientists at Kruger
National Park are recruiting tourists to help them track, count and
conserve the African wild dog, the most endangered large carnivore
on the continent.
   The big-eared dogs have intricately patterned coats, each one
distinct enough so individual animals can be identified from
photographs. Once scientists know how many wild dogs there are and
how they move, they will begin drawing up conservation plans.
   South Africa's National Parks Board and the private Endangered
Wildlife Trust have started a contest to get tourists to take
pictures of the animals and send the prints in with information on
location, pack size and number of young.
   About 1,000 photographs have been entered in the contest, which
began in January and runs through July.
   The first prize is a free trip to a South African national park
and the runner-up prizes are photo equipment.
   ``We could drive through the park for a month and never see one
wild dog, but probably every day someone somewhere in the park sees
them. They stay close to the road and they are not scared of
vehicles,'' said Gus Mills, head of predator research at the park.
   He said he believes there are about 300 in the park, the biggest
group in Africa. Others are in Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia and parts
of East Africa.
   ``They move long distances and seem sometimes to go out of the
park. When that happens, they get into trouble,'' said Mills.
   Since wild dog packs hunt by day and don't fear humans, they are
easy targets for farmers protecting their livestock. Mills said a
farmer whose land borders the park recently shot 20 dogs.
   ``People have an exaggerated hatred for wild dogs; it's somewhat
like the way the wolf is regarded in America,'' Mills said.
   Wild dogs travel in packs of up to 25 and need to kill three or
four impala to feed their members.
   Only one female and male in each pack breed, with the female
producing 10 to 15 pups and all members helping to raise the litter.

<TEXT>
   After a year of scientific debate,
archaeologists still can't figure out how to keep the Sphinx from
falling apart.
   It's been almost six months since workmen made emergency repairs
and replaced a stone that fell Feb. 7, 1988, from the crouching
lion's right shoulder.
   But the experts can't decide what to do next.
   ``Scholars from Egypt and around the world have given us good
advice, but not one has been able to come up with a sure way to save
our wonderful Sphinx,'' said Sayed Tawfik, Egypt's top
archaeological official.
   As chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization, Tawfik is
caretaker of Egypt's enormous treasurehouse of the past.
   ``In all the world there's only one Sphinx like this,'' he said.
``We love him and don't want to do anything to injure him. This is
why we have an international panel studying where to go from here.''
   The Sphinx, with its wide-eyed stare and smug expression, has
undergone the jabs and probes of restorers almost since anonymous
artisans sculpted the half-man, half-beast 4,600 years ago at the
base of Giza's pyramids plateau.
   None of the intermittent remedies has been able to stop
occasional rock falls.
   Major falls touch off political uproars in Cairo.
   A tumbling rock in 1982 cost the job of the antiquities chairman
at that time.
   Last year's rockfall brought the departure of Ahmed Kadry,
pressured out of office because of a vocal and highly public row
with his boss, Farouk Hosni, the minister of culture. Tawfik was
appointed to replace him in December.
   Such sensitivity illustrates the Sphinx's monumental importance
to the Egyptians. Ancient Egypt was a cat-worshiping country, and
the Sphinx remains a very personal and popular cat.
   At times mostly buried in desert sand, at times not, the Sphinx
has survived into the late 20th century as one of world's best-known
relics, although bruised and battered.
   Nobody knows how or why or when it lost its nose and pharaoh's
beard, but they are the most obvious reminders of the unseen
stresses at work.
   Tawfik said he believes the ancient stonemasons knew the Sphinx
wouldn't survive as long as the pyramids of Giza, which form a
backdrop against the horizon.
   Some of the Sphinx's building blocks are as strong as those of
the pyramids, he said, but others, especially in the neck, shoulder
and rear haunches, are weaker.
   ``Perhaps they knew after 4,000 years or so the Sphinx couldn't
survive any longer,'' said Tawfik, an archaeology professor. ``I
think the Sphinx is a decoration of Giza Plateau, a unique one, not
a monument for eternity as were other monuments.''
   The first known effort to help the Sphinx was 3,400 years ago. As
recorded in stone, the prince who would become Pharaoh Tuthmosis IV
followed an order that came to him in a dream during a daytime nap
to remove the sand from the Sphinx. He did so and, as promised in
the dream, the Sphinx repaid him by arranging for him to usurp the
throne of Egypt.
   Fourteen centuries later, Roman technicians performed emergency
restorations at a time when the pyramids and the Sphinx already were
drawing tourists from around the Mediterranean.
   In modern times, foreign and Egyptian teams have had a go at
stopping the decay. Applying mudpacks to remove salt clusters and
injecting glue down its throat didn't work. More drastic suggestions
like reburying the monument in sand or encasing it in glass arise
from time to time.
   In the year since the stone fell, experts from Egypt, Germany,
Italy, France, the United States and other countries have given
advice on how to proceed.
   Egyptian geologists are studying rock samples. Specialists are
monitoring desert winds that blast the Sphinx. Pollution experts are
studying the effects of dirty air. Water and soil technicians are
testing the water table level on and near Giza Plateau, checking
whether subterranean water is causing salt to weaken the limestone.
   Even so, the Giza Plateau's antiquities director, Zahi Hawass,
remains optimistic.
   ``I believe for the first time in its history we are able to save
the Sphinx,'' Hawass said, explaining that advanced scientific
findings in many fields are being applied to archaeological work.
   But for the Sphinx, he said, time is passing fast.
   ``He's like a suffering old man who needs an operation. But what
kind? When the rock fell (last year), it was kind of a red flag,''
Hawass said. ``At that time the government appointed a committee to
decide what to do. We're still meeting.''
   And it will continue to meet, he said, until it comes up with a
plan that won't repeat the earlier restoration efforts that harmed
the Sphinx more than they helped.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Physical Evidence,'' ``Mississippi Burning''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   ``Physical Evidence'':
   
   Hollywood in the late 1940s and early '50s offered a series of
films in which the hardboiled detective sifted through unsavory
characters and wandered a labyrinthine route to uncover the real
perpetrator of a heinous crime.
   The stars were usually Humphrey Bogart, Dick Powell or Robert
Mitchum. The author was often Raymond Chandler or a Chandler clone.
The plots were as interwoven as macrame. In ``The Big Sleep,''
Howard Hawks even accomplished a miracle: a flashback within a
flashback within a flashback.
   ``Physical Evidence'' is an update of that genre, but with a 1989
touch. The real protaganist is a woman lawyer. The
Bogart-Powell-Mitchum figure is a defrocked cop so ineffectual that
he spends the final shootout flat on his back, wounded.
   Jenny Hudson (Theresa Russell) is a public defender who resents
assignment of all the good cases to male lawyers. She demands a
headlined defendant, a suspended police detective (Burt Reynolds)
accused of murdering a shady night club owner.
   Everyone believes Reynolds did it _ everyone except Russell. She
leaps into the investigation, putting herself at peril from the many
desperate figures who had good reason to knock off the club owner.
She also finds herself torn between the slovenly but appealing
Reynolds and her stockbroker housemate, Ted McGinley.
   You can take your pick of suspects: Kenneth Welsh as a smooth
mobster; Ray Baker, a cop on the take; Tom O'Brien, the deceased
man's unmourning son; Kay Lenz, perhaps a blackmail victim. And more.
   These films are usually more fun in the playing than in the
payoff, and ``Physical Evidence'' is no exception. Bill Phillips'
script provides a climactic body count of six and no great surprises.
   Michael Crichton, generally associated with science fiction
(``Westworld,'' ``Coma''), directed the film with a fast pace and an
eye for offbeat characters. Some of his observations are wry,
particularly the yuppie lifestyle of Russell and McGinley.
   The opening sequence is a corker: a would-be suicide ends up
dangling from a bridge with a corpse in his hands. Unfortunately,
that is the most exciting part of the movie.
   Reynolds has admitted that ``Physical Evidence'' represents a
change of character for him; he plays a not too lovable ex-cop who
has lost control of his life and his destiny. He pulls it off in
good style, retaining the cynical wisecracks while exhibiting more
character than he has since ``Deliverance.''
   Theresa Russell, impressive as the husband killer in ``Black
Widow,'' remains totally in charge of her role as the dedicated
lawyer. Ned Beatty plays the devious prosecutor in his usual style,
and the rest of the cast offer an intriguing gallery of no-goods.
   The Columbia Pictures release was produced by Martin Ransohoff
and is enhanced by a Henry Mancini score. The rating is R for
language and violence.
   Running time: 99 minutes.

   ``Mississippi Burning'':
   
   In the summer of 1964, young men and women from around the nation
poured into Mississippi to take part in ``Freedom Summer,'' a
concerted effort to register black voters in the segregated state.
One was 20-year-old Andrew Goodman, a student at Queens College. On
June 21, Goodman and two members of CORE (Congress of Racial
Equality), Michael Schwerner and James Chaney, drove to the town of
Lawndale where a black church had been burned. They never returned.
   They were stopped for speeding near Philadelphia and jailed for
several hours on bogus charges. After being released that night, the
workers failed to call in. After an extensive search, involving the
FBI and 200 sailors, and a tip from a ``Mr. X,'' the bodies were
discovered Aug. 4 on a farm outside of Philadelphia.
   A fictionalized account of the murder of those three young
volunteers is unraveled in Alan Parker's ``Mississippi Burning.''
The movie is by no means an accurate or riveting account of that
strange and horrendous period in American history. Rather, it is a
detective story that boils down to the typical Hollywood good
cop-bad cop treatment. It is male bonding redux.
   Parker focuses on two FBI agents sent to Mississippi to
investigate the disappearance of the civil rights workers. Ward
(Willem Dafoe) is the upstanding, neatly suited partner who plays
things by the book. Anderson (Gene Hackman) is a redneck and a
maverick. He does things his way and has a short fuse.
   Their search, and Anderson's seething tensions are relentless.
Through plot twists that suspend belief, they discover the bodies
and peel away the facade of white Southern virtue, exposing it as an
ugly, oozing canker sore. Parker almost has his audience cheering
for the wonderful FBI. Bring back Efrem Zimbalist Jr. Canonize J.
Edgar Hoover.
   But the reality is that the FBI was more a harassment to blacks
and sympathetic whites during the civil rights struggle than heroic
knight. The movie also overlooks those who were at the very helm of
the movement and who led and suffered through that summer. Blacks
are mere pimples on the landscape in Parker's thinking; they stand
by and do nothing. They have no passions, no aggressions, no
thoughts.
   The strength of ``Mississippi Burning'' is not its shallow look
at segregation, but its performances, especially by Hackman. His
portrayal of Anderson is perhaps the best in his career. He
steamrolls through the movie with volcanic force, filling the
theater with a crackling tension. Dafoe is, by necessity, the
antithesis, and he delivers well.
   Taken as a detective film, ``Mississippi Burning'' (the FBI file
name for the case), is a fine piece of entertainment. But don't
expect a credible history lesson.
   The Orion Pictures release was produced by Frederick Zollo and
Robert F. Colesberry. The movie is rated R.

   ``Horse Feathers'' (MCA Home Video. VHS-Beta, $29.95. No Rating)
   
   Even in this era of glasnost, ``Horse Feathers'' proves that Marx
still reigns supreme: Marx a la Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Zeppo.
   Marxism according to Minnie's Boys was always more akin to
anarchism, of course, starting with the title of this 1932 classic
which naturally bears no relationship whatsoever to the film's
goings-on.
   ``Horse Feathers'' takes us to Huxley College, a school so
desperate for a winning football season that it names Professor
Quincy Adams Wagstaff as its president. The good professor, played
by Groucho, quickly spells out his program for the school's revival
in one of the funniest musical bits ever filmed:
   ``I don't know what they have to say,
   ``It makes no difference anyway,
   ``Whatever it is, I'm against it!
   ``No matter what it is or who commenc'd it,
   ``I'm against it!''
   As with all Marx Brothers movies, it gives away nothing to say
that insanity prevails, Huxley whips the bad guys on the football
field and Groucho, Harpo and Chico commit trigamy with the campus
femme fatale known as ``the college widow.''
   For trivia collectors, said widow is played by Thelma Todd, a
comedian who in real life died a violent underworld-related death
three years after this movie was made.
   With the madcap S.J. Perelman as scriptwriter along with Bert
Kalmer and Harry Ruby, ``Horse Feathers'' was destined to be one of
the funniest Marx Brothers films, which is to say, one of the
funniest by anyone at anytime. It easily ranks with the Marx's
``Monkey Business'' and ``Duck Soup.''
   Groucho, always at the center of the antics, is perhaps a little
nastier than usual and that's just how we like it. Watch his scene
in the canoe, for example, wooeing the comely Todd with his guitar.
   Enough said. ``Horse Feathers'' is 69 minutes of non-stop
hilarity.

   ``Slipping Into Darkness'' (Virgin Vision. VHS-Beta, $79.95.
Rated R)
   
   This movie is so bad there isn't a funny way to review it. And
there's something scary, too. Read the box:
   ``Three bored college girls are looking for excitement in a
one-horse town when a careless joyride ends in the gruesome death of
a young boy. Because no one admits responsibility, the boy's brother
swears to solve the crime.''
   Right.
   You get this odious piece of anti-female trash thinking, ``Well,
hey, it looks schlocky and stupid but at least I'll see shock horror
beach party sex biker bimbos on parade.'' And pasteboard characters,
ludicrous situations and unrealistic behavior that's kind of a
savage ``Carry On...'' movie.
   This utterly mean, nasty, hateful movie reeks with contempt for
women and sullen hatred for men. The objects of its sexual violence
are stupid or perverse women and the objects of its mutilating
butchery are men.
   Then you find out that a woman, Eleanor Gaver, wrote and directed
it.
   This movie is pornography without the dignity of honest exercise.

   ``Reach For The Sky'' (Atlantic) _ Ratt
   ``Quiet Riot'' (Pasha) _ Quiet Riot
   
   Why is it that guys in heavy metal bands always have permed hair?
Maybe it's the decibels of sound they crank out of their guitars, or
maybe it's just to get a little variety in their lives.
   Because there sure isn't much variety in the music.
   Of these two heavy metal bands, Ratt's effort is the more
imaginative _ the band actually uses horns and a harmonica on one
bluesy tune, ``Way Cool Jr.'' And Quiet Riot, with a revamped
lineup, is the more pop-oriented; ``I'm Fallin''' is actually kind
of bouncy.
   But otherwise, the music and lyrics follow the well-worn,
tyrannosaurus-like heavy metal footsteps on both ``Reach for the
Sky'' and ``Quiet Riot.''
   There's the loud, foursquare thump-thump-thump-thump of the bass
and drums, the themes of sex, domination, misogyny, partyin' and
wonderin' why that evil woman up and left. There's the guitar solos
_ always guitar solos _ reaching ever new levels of speed and
showing off the soloist's digital dexterity. And the high, scratchy
vocals from the stud-lead singers over it all.
   No deviation is allowed from the heavy metal form, and Ratt and
Quiet Riot don't dare take a chance.
   While they sing about being the ``King of the Hill'' (Quiet
Riot), or lay down the law on ``Bottom Line'' (Ratt), they remain
shackled to the limits of their music. Like the hair on their heads,
it's permanent.

   Smetana ``Ma Vlast'' (My Country) a Supraphon compact disk. Jiri
Belohlavek conducting the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra.
   
   This recording of Smetana's cycle of symphonic poems was made
from a live performance during the Prague spring music festival last
year. The orchestra and conductor, who obviously know their stuff,
offer authentic and exciting interpretations of the music, some of
it familiar and some not so. It's nice to hear the more popular
excerpts _ the ``Moldau'' and ``From Bohemia's Woods and Fields'' _
set in the context of the other pieces, all of which retell the
glory and downfall of the Bohemian people.
   
   From CBS Masterworks, some recent entries in the Digital Masters
Series, compact disk versions of previously released recordings:
   
   _ Tchaikovsky: The Great Symphonies. The Vienna Philharmonic
conducted by Lorin Maazel. This three-disk collection offers
vibrant, muscular renditions of the brooding Russian master's 4th,
5th and 6th Symphonies. Because of the additional playing time
gained in the transfer from LP to compact disk, each symphony comes
with a bonus. No. 4 includes Prokofiev's ``Lieutenant Kije Suite'';
No. 5 is paired with Prokofiev's Symphony No. 1 (The Classical
Symphony); and No. 6 is followed by two Tchaikovsky hardy perennials
_ the Marche Slav and the 1812 Overture.
   
   _ Beethoven Symphonies No. 7 and 8, crisp, authoritative
performances by the English Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Michael

   In her first two American films, Italian-born
Valeria Golino has had a dizzying contrast of lovers: Pee-wee Herman
and Tom Cruise.
   First came ``Pee-wee's Big Top,'' in which she played the circus
aerialist who wins the heart of the little guy in the tight suit.
The comedy didn't exactly overload the nation's box offices, but her
next film did. In ``Rain Man,'' the season's reigning box-office
champ, she is Cruise's secretary and bedmate.
   Golino, 22, is unexpectedly modest about her work in ``Rain Man.''
   ``I am proud to be in the movie, but I am not in it very much,''
the dark beauty said. ``But that is good. The relation is between
the two of them (Cruise and Dustin Hoffman). That's what the movie
is about: the relationship of two brothers. If I was there all the
time, I would have been in an awkward position. Or I would have had
to be arguing with (Cruise) all the time. So I had to leave.''
   Golino worked in the Los Angeles scenes, as well as the locations
in Cincinnati and Las Vegas, but she missed the middle portion in
Oklahoma.
   ``There was something about Cincinnati that I liked: the people,
the architecture,'' she commented. ``Las Vegas? It was fun, but two
weeks and a half in Caesar's Palace was too much. There is something
about the sound that gets you. You go in the rooms and you're like
in a cage. There are things on the windows to keep people from
jumping out. But you can have fun.''
   Valeria Golino's ascent to stardom appears to have resulted from
a series of happy accidents.
   ``I started as a model in Rome when I was 14{ or 15,'' she said.
``I was not planning to be an actress. Then I met (director) Lina
Wertmuller, and she said, `You are going to be in this movie.' It
was not an easy thing for me. To work with someone like Lina, who is
a wild woman, for the first time, it was kind of shocking.
   ``I said, `I thought this was glamour, and this is hell!' She was
very tough to me. She is very affectionate, also very severe. But
after the first movie, I decided this was what I wanted to do.''
   She appeared in 11 Italian films, earning the Venice Film
Festival's Golden Lion for ``Love Story.'' The producers of ``Big
Top Pee-wee'' saw one of her films and brought her to Hollywood for
a screen test.
   ``When I came here, I didn't know who Pee-wee Herman was or
Randal Kleiser, the director,'' she recalled. ``In the beginning I
didn't want to do the movie; I had never done comedy before.
   ``Then I saw Pee-wee's first movie, and there was something about
him that made me say, `I can do this.' There was something about the
way he moved, his character, that was so different, so original. I
said, `That's not going to be ``Police Academy.'' It's going to be a
comedy.'''
   How did she land ``Rain Man''?
   ``In the most traditional way possible. My agent called me and
said, `There is a movie with Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman.' I said,
`What?' He said, `The role is written for an American girl. Now
they're not sure. Let's give it a try.'''
   The actress made a good impression on the casting director. She
read scenes twice for the director, Barry Levinson, then with Tom
Cruise. Having finished ``Big Top Pee-wee,'' she flew home to Rome,
then was asked to return to read once more with Cruise, then with
Cruise and Hoffman.
   ``I've never done so much reading for such a small role,'' she
said. The script was rewritten to accommodate her accent; since
Cruise imported Italian cars, she could logically be his
secretary-interpreter.
   How was working with Cruise?
   ``It was much more interesting than I imagined,'' she said. ``For
the first moment I met him, I understood that this guy was great. He
wasn't like anything I thought before. Always we have big prejudice
when someone has big success: He must be an unbearable human being.
So I found myself in front of a nice _ in the most full meaning of
the word _ really nice guy, a gentleman.''
   And Hoffman?
   ``Unfortunately, the only thing I got to work with him on was in
the elevator (where she tries to teach him to dance). It was a
delicate scene to do because it could have looked very easily like
seduction. It was a naive way of trying to make him happy because
his date hadn't arrived.
   ``Dustin, like DeNiro, is one of the totems of films. Even though
I had a small role, it was worth it to be around him to see how he
moved, how he reacted. To me it was like going to acting school.''
   Golino, who speaks English as well as Greek, French and her
native Italian, recently completed ``Torrents of Spring'' with
Timothy Hutton. Even though she is now in demand, she doesn't plan
to settle in Hollywood.
   ``I like to work here, but I wouldn't want to live here,'' she
said. ``I always want to know I can go home to Rome and Europe.''

<HEAD>The Artists: A Glimpse at Composers' Lives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Austrian composer Gustav Mahler was plagued by
depression, self-pity and writer's block as a young man, according
to Mahler letters recently acquired by Jerusalem's Hebrew University.
   Letters by German composer Felix Mendelssohn, also part of the
new collection, show he couldn't handle money, but was a family man
who wrote glowing descriptions of his wife nursing their son.
   Some of the letters have never been published. ``They will now
enlighten several aspects of the composers' lives,'' said Iaacov
Ghelman, head of the university's music department.
   In addition to 67 letters by Mendelssohn and 46 by Mahler, the
correspondence also includes communications from Jacques Offenbach,
Ernst Bloch, Giacomo Meyerbeer, Jacques Halevy and Arnold
Schoenberg. The letters were donated by the widow of New York
collector Otto Lobbenberg.
   The letters written by the young Mahler, who was born July 7,
1860 as the son of a Jewish peddler in Austrian Bohemia, reveal a
man in emotional turmoil.
   Writing to Anton Krisper, a friend from composing class at the
Vienna Conservatory, the 19-year-old Mahler described in a Feb. 14,
1880, letter how he procrastinated instead of composing.
   ``I spent most of my time to indulge in sweet suffering in the
most wasteful way. ... I lived in my dreams and dreamt while
awake,'' Mahler wrote, adding later: ``I'll have to taste all the
sorrows of this world, and won't be spared a single one.''
   Mahler's letters to Krisper, most written in the spring of 1880,
are filled with yearning for the absent friend.
   Sitting in their old haunt, Vienna's Cafe Imperial, Mahler wrote
an undated letter on cafe stationary: ``I just arrived in Vienna and
immediately went to the place where we shared so much suffering and
joy. My thoughts only revolve around you.''
   On March 14, 1880, he wrote to Krisper: ``I'm so lonely, and I
don't know how much longer I will be able to bear it.''
   Mahler's early years were also marked by restlessness. ``I've
been in Vienna for three months, and in addition to various hotels,
have already lived in five apartments. You can imagine what that
does to my work,'' Mahler wrote to Krisper in January 1883.
   ``Again, the crying of some little kid is bothering me,'' Mahler
wrote of his abode at the time, adding that despite the
distractions, he had completed the first act of ``Ruebezahl,'' an
opera for which he composed some music in the 1880s.
   Mahler initially made his name not as a composer, but as a
conductor, leading orchestras in Prague, Leipzig, Budapest, Hamburg
and Vienna. In between conducting, he composed nine symphonies (the
10th unfinished) as well as several songs and song cycles.
   The letters of Mahler in later years contained in the collection
focus more on business than on his personal life as he arranged
concerts, hired artists and quarreled with theater directors.
   But in a Dec. 9, 1893, letter to Natalie Bauer-Lechner, a friend,
Mahler expressed deep concern for his younger brother, Otto, whom he
supported financially and tried to advance as a musician.
   ``Dear Natalie,'' wrote Mahler, the second of 14 children and the
oldest of six to survive childhood. ``Today I received a letter from
Otto in which, with his usual grandeur, he told me with dignity that
I insulted him, and that he could no longer accept my support.''
   Mahler asked Natalie to find out discreetly whether Otto would
manage. ``I can't very well answer him since this is the way he
feels, but I don't want him to go hungry or suffer,'' Mahler wrote.
   Otto committed suicide two years later in Vienna.
   The climax of Mahler's career came in 1897 when he was named
conductor of the Vienna Court Opera. He was baptized a Catholic just
before the appointment because at the time non-Catholics were barred
from holding important official positions.
   In his letters, Mahler made no reference to either religion,
suggesting that the conversion for him was just a formality.
   Mendelssohn, a member of an illustrious German Jewish family, was
baptized as a 7-year-old in 1816, along with his three siblings. His
parents converted to Christianity six years later.
   As an outward sign of conversion, the family added the surname
Bartholdy which, according to music publications, was that of the
owners of a garden site purchased by a Mendelssohn's uncle.
   When Mendelssohn gave a series of concerts in London in 1829, he
got in trouble with his father because concert flyers only referred
to him as Mendelssohn.
   Apparently his father, Abraham, was anxious that the original
surname by itself sounded too Jewish and he suggested at one time to
his son that it be dropped altogether. The younger Mendelssohn
responded in a letter dated July 16, 1829 that his English sponsors
had promised to print the full name, Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, but then
reneged.
   ``I'm convinced it wasn't my fault,'' he wrote. ``I won't ignore
your orders, but I certainly didn't do it on purpose.''
   Mendelssohn described how after his arrival in England he was
touted in a local magazine as the grandson of Moses Mendelssohn, the
famous philospher of the Englightenment.
   ``From this moment, all the musicians called me Mendelssohn, and
asked me about my grandfather and his works,'' he wrote. ``The
people I met asked me about him and said nice things about him.''
   While proud of his family heritage, Mendelssohn's new religion
also found an expression both in his work and private life. He wrote
choral music and six organ sonatas, and in one undated letter
expressed his appreciation for spiritual music, praising a choir
concert he attended in England.
   The performance ``recalled to me the effect of chorals when sung
by the whole congregation and in a crowded church,'' he wrote.
``Being so free from any harshness of tone and shrieking sound,
(something) one should not expect from such a mass of voices.''
   In another letter, Mendelssohn asked an unnamed friend to be
godfather to one of his sons, showing he apparently accepted his
baptism as permanent. Several of the letters show Mendelssohn as a
loving father and husband who took his family responsibilities
seriously.
   On Feb. 2, 1838, one day before his 29th birthday, Mendelssohn
wrote to German diplomat Karl Klingemann, a friend since the 1820s,
to express his joy at the birth of a son.
   ``I wanted to tell you how I feel when my little son cries, and
when Cecile holds him to her breast and looks at him calmly ... and
she is so healthy and charming and good like an angel,'' he wrote.
   The obligations of fatherhood sparked a burst of creative energy
in Mendelssohn, a prodigy who composed one of his most famous works,
the overture to ``A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' at age 17.
   ``I'm in the middle of writing (composing), and I have to be
industrious in these years to get ahead. I have obligations and also
the desire to do it,'' Mendelssohn wrote to Klingemann. ``I could
finish a new oratorium in one year.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Bobby Brown Takes His Perogative</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bobby Brown had completed recording sessions in
Los Angeles for his second solo album but felt something was
missing. Seeking inspiration, he and producer Gene Griffin headed
for New York. The result was ``My Perogative,'' a No. 1 smash off
the million-selling ``Don't Be Cruel.''
   ``I felt my album was lacking a strong, aggressive song and I
thought, `Where better than New York to come up with it,''' said
Brown, an original member of New Edition, one of the hottest groups
of the 1980s.
   ``A lot of things had been said about Bobby Brown, why was he
doing this (a solo career). It's my way of expressing to people it's
your perogative to do as you want but make sure what you do is the
right thing.''
   Brown has erased any doubts about his decision to leave New
Edition in 1987. Although he had originally planned to return to the
group after one album, the success of ``Don't Be Cruel'' and his
first solo record, ``King of Stage,'' have established him as a
major star in his own right.
   ``None of these songs could have come by New Edition,'' Brown
said. ``I wanted to express more of me. In a group you're limited.
You have different roles''
   Brown grew up in the same Boston ghetto of Roxbury as fellow New
Edition members Ralph Tresvant, Michael Bivins, Ricky Bell and
Ronnie DeVoe. They began singing together in 1981 when Brown was
just 13, and made their debut in a matinee performance at Boston's
High Hat club.
   ``We sang a Jackson Five number,'' Brown recalled. ``It was the
start of something big. We enjoyed performing together and we used
to go around to the matinee clubs. We were the ones out of the
neighborthood who took the time to try and do something better for
ourselves.
   The Jackson Five would loom large in the early days of New
Edition. Not only were they both five-man vocal groups barely into
their teens, but New Edition's breakthrough hit in 1983, ``Candy
Girl,'' had an uncanny resemblance to Jackson 5 songs such as
``ABC'' and ``The Love You Save.''
   The groups had something else in common: fans, devoted ones.
   ``In one town, it got totally out of hand and we all ended up in
the hospital,'' Brown said. ``We were going to the show and when our
car pulled up a gentleman we thought was with the organizers told us
to go through this door.
   ``But it was the wrong door. The audience turned around and saw
us and they started chasing us. We were terrified.''
   There were further hit records and sold-out shows, but New
Edition would run into legal problems when producer Maurice Starr
filed suit, claiming he had legal rights to the group's name.
Although a Boston judge ruled in New Edition's favor, Brown decided
in 1987 to go out on his own.
   ``It was time for a direction change,'' Brown said. ``I loved the
group and we will be friends forever but I would catch myself going
into my own thing at times on stage. I have a real energetic type of
personality. They were going for all-American boys so to speak. I
wanted to express more to my audience.''
   But Brown admitted that the decision took its toll emotionally.
   ``Yeah, it was tough. It took a lot of going over, a lot of
getting used to. It wasn't an easy decision by no means. They took
it as well as could be expected. We left in good standing.''
   His first solo album came out in 1987 and contained the single,
``Girl Friend,'' which topped the R&amp;B charts. But on stage, at
least, some adjusting was necessary.
   ``I went on a tour with Ready for the World. I got up there and I
was going through a New Edition song like `Mr. Telephone Man' and I
would start anticipating that Ralph would come in for his part,'' he
said. ``It didn't take me a real long time to get over that
feeling.''
   ``Don't Be Cruel,'' a mixture of uptempo tracks and ballads, has
established Brown as a major crossover artist at a time, ironically,
that New Edition's latest album is also topping the charts. The
singer's desire to let people see the ``real'' Bobby Brown was
tested by the title track.
   ``The people in the studio had seen a girl I had brought to the
rehearsals,'' Brown said. ``They got a feeling that she was being
cruel to me. The song was devised around that. I knew it was a good
tune.''
   But Brown didn't anticipate the song reaching the Top 5 or the
album becoming one of the year's biggest sellers. The singer called
it a ``pleasant surprise.''
   ``To tell you the truth, I was hoping for a single platinum. That
would have been a feat that I would have loved to have attained. Now
being multi-platinum is inconceivable. I'm still overwhelmed at the
numbers.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Bharati Mukherjee Speaks for America's New Immigrants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENEVA COLLINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They are not the tired, poor, huddled masses
yearning to breathe free. They are Oxford-educated professors from
India, wealthy families chased from Idi Amin's Uganda, factory
owners fleeing Afghanistan's upheavals. They are America's new
immigrants, arriving via Concorde, not a refugee boat.
   They have found a voice in Bharati Mukherjee, a self-described
Hindu Bengali Brahmin who was raised in affluence in Bombay, India,
educated in British and Swiss schools before receiving a master's
and doctorate at the University of Iowa, and who last year became an
American citizen.
   In January, her sixth book, ``The Middleman and Other Stories''
(Grove Press, $15.95), won the prestigious National Book Critics
Circle Award. The honor has been gratifying for two reasons, she
said in a recent interview.
   First, it has put the book, published last spring, back on the
shelves. But far more importantly, she said, it has shown a
``marvelous curiosity and adventurousness'' on the part of the
literary establishment to select such an unconventional book.
   ``A country that allows a writer from a minority community or a
marginalized group to be included as a voice in mainstream American
literature _ now that's a tribute to the country,'' said Mukherjee,
a slight, thoughtful woman with a relaxed laugh and exquisite poise
during the interview at The Associated Press offices.
   She was asked if she chose the title ``The Middleman'' because
immigrants are, in effect, middlemen _ shuttling between their
native and adopted countries.
   ``Immigrants are middlemen, and I also feel that America is going
through transition, that the country has changed since the 1970s
with the fast influx of immigrants from non-traditional countries,''
she said. ``We are in many ways similar to the European, and
especially the Jewish, influx of 30 to 40 years ago. But in many
significant ways, we who are coming from Asia and the Caribbean are
very dissimilar, very distinct. ...
   ``For many of my characters, as it was for me, coming to America
is a social comedown. I had a life of ease and privilege which I
have chosen to not to want to continue by living in the United
States _ a social demotion. I'll never have that kind of money and
physical comfort in this country.''
   Mukherjee, 48, who has lived in North America for 28 years, has
wholeheartedly embraced the United States. She said she thinks of
this collection of short stories as ``my tribute to America. This is
finally my very American book, and I want the exuberance to reflect
the kind of exuberance that this country has released in me that
none of the countries I have lived in have.''
   While studying at the University of Iowa, Mukherjee met and
married Clark Blaise, a novelist, and the two moved to Canada in
1968 to teach and write. They both became Canadian citizens, but
left that country in the late '70s because of racial prejudice and
physical harassment of foreigners there. The couple came to the
United States and now live in New York City, where Mukherjee teaches
full-time at Queens College and part-time at Columbia and New York
universities.
   She has written two novels, ``The Tiger's Daughter'' and
``Wife,'' and a previous collection of short stories, ``Darkness.''
She also has collaborated on two non-fiction books with her husband,
``Days and Nights in Calcutta'' and ``The Sorrow and the Terror.''
The latter is about the 1985 Air India flight that crashed over
Ireland, killing 329 people.
   ``The Middleman'' is a departure for her because she now feels
comfortable adopting the persona of white Americans when needed. In
fact, this collection's power lies in the enormous range of
characters and locales so convincingly portrayed _ a Vietnam vet who
becomes a hired killer in Florida, a Trinidad woman who sneaks into
America from Canada and finds work as an au pair, a Sri Lankan high
school teacher who gets stranded in West Germany, a young woman from
a close Italian family trying to introduce her Afghan lover to her
blue-collar parents.
   ``When I'm with Ro I feel I am looking at America through the
wrong end of a telescope,'' thinks the woman with the Afghan lover
in the story ``Orbiting.''
   ``He makes it sound like a police state, with sudden raids,
papers, detention centers, deportations, and torture and death
waiting in the wings.''
   Other characters see America as Disneyland, a nation of infinite
plenty where adults act like overfed children.
   Mukherjee said she is not surprised at Americans' ignorance of
events and geography beyond their borders. ``I remember as a kid in
Calcutta, where we had to know street names in London and Paris ...
because real life was lived elsewhere, and whatever life we lived
was somewhat devalued by colonialism and post-colonialism. I envied
Americans their insularity.''
   America will learn about the rest of the world when geopolitical
events force it to, she predicted. And perhaps the literary world's
recognition of ``The Middleman'' is a small step toward increasing
understanding of this new and different generation of immigrants.
   ``The people I'm writing about have had no voice in American
literature,'' she said. ``And I think one of my tasks becomes
sensitizing editors of magazines, saying, `Look, we all exist out
there. The people you sit next to on the No. 7 train have enormous
stories to tell.'''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Hank Williams Jr. And Father Team Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a rare contemplative moment for
country music thunderbolt Hank Williams Jr., he paused in his west
Tennessee office and stared at the picture of his parents. He winked
at his mother, then fixed his admiring gaze on his dad.
   ``Well,'' he said to the large photo showing his famous father.
``It looks like I've got a new singing partner and you're No. 1
again.''
   Hank Williams Sr., a country music legend who died in 1953, and
Hank Williams Jr. are finally a duet. Through the magic of
technology, they sing together on the current song ``There's a Tear
in My Beer.''
   The previously unreleased song by the elder Williams was recently
discovered, improved technologically and vocals by his 39-year-old
son were added. The result is one of the most anticipated country
music releases in years.
   ``It's a wonderful feeling to be singing along with him _
something I never thought possible,'' Williams said in an interview.
``To me, you are looking at two rockabilly stars that finally got
together for one hot shot. It's just a very contented feeling.''
   That's an apt description of Williams' entire career these days.
He's country music's No. 1 act right now, having been voted
entertainer of the year two straight times by the Country Music
Association.
   He has a whopping five albums on the country music charts,
including his ``Greatest Hits, Vol. 1,'' which has sold 2 million
copies.
   His concerts _ 2{ hour marathons _ have set attendance records in
several cities. Agents have said he commands up to $100,000 per show.
   His music reveals him to be an enduring explorer singing blues,
hard-core country and rock 'n' roll. His concerts tingle with fury
as he charges around stage, singing his blue-collar anthems and
rapping with raucous fans who shout their salutes.
   His bold baritone celebrates the South with such songs as ``Dixie
on My Mind,'' ``If Heaven Ain't a Lot Like Dixie'' and ``If the
South Woulda Won.''
   But his music is not entirely provincial. His ``A Country Boy Can
Survive'' is about world tensions. ``Something to Believe In'' is
about the struggles of the common man.
   He performs his high-voltage music by playing an array of
instruments including guitar, banjo, fiddle, piano, steel guitar,
harmonica and drums.
   ``I write songs that most of my fans can relate to, about
everyday life,'' he said. ``I play six-seven instruments on stage,
and they know if you are enjoying what you are doing.''
   He's also had a turbo-charged lifestyle, having survived cocaine
use, suicide attempts and a 500-foot fall off a Montana mountain in
1975 that required a year of anguished recovery. His ever present
beard and sunglasses hide the stubborn scars. A spiffy cowboy hat
tops off his commanding 6-foot-2 frame which tapers to gleaming
cowboy boots.
   ``I don't sit around the penthouse and polish my nails,'' he said.
   Williams, who was just 3 when his father died, has recorded more
than 50 albums. At one point in 1982, he had an unprecedented nine
LPs on the country music charts.
   He made his first public performance at age 8 and was appearing
on the road not long thereafter. He is a high school dropout. This
year marks his 25th year as a recording artist.
   ``I'm proud of it,'' he said. ``The longevity has been good. It's
hard to imagine all the good things that have happened in (just) the
past eight years. And I aim high.''
   He inherited a famous name from his father, who in the early
1950s was country music's top star with hits including ``Your
Cheatin' Heart,'' ``I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry'' and ``Hey Good
Lookin'.''
   But it wasn't until this decade that the younger Williams decided
to carve his own style and not be a clone of his father.
   ``I just started doing what I wanted to do not that long ago,''
he said. ``All that before doesn't count in my book; I was just a
kid; it was do this, do that. I was not that enamored with the music
business then. It was all built in for me.''
   He has used music videos to good advantage, enlisting rock 'n'
roll stars Van Halen, comedians Cheech and Chong and pro football
stars among dozens of other celebrities who have appeared in them.
   ``I call 'em up and say this is Bocephus (his nickname). I say do
you want to do this thing. They say, `yes.' It amazes me,'' he said.
   He recently pondered what his father would say about his career.
   ``He'd say, `Boy, I knew you was going to do it all the time. I'm
so proud of you; you got out there and did it the way you wanted
to.' I think he would be pretty happy over it.''

<HEAD>Scientists Studying Antarctic Ice Cap Holes For Climate Effects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mysterious holes that periodically form in the
ice covering Antarctic seas may serve as vents for excess heat and
trapped gas, helping to shape the Earth's climate and influencing
the ``greenhouse effect.''
   These ice-free regions, some as large as France, weren't
discovered until 1974 when scientists began examining new satellite
images of Antarctica and the frozen ocean encircling it. Scientists
don't know if the holes called polynyas existed before then or even
how frequently they develop in the vast ice cover.
   Teams of scientists from the Soviet Union, the United States and
West Germany have worked since 1981 to figure out how the holes
form, what role they play in ocean circulation and how they affect
the climate.
   Polynya (pronounced ``pa-lean-yah''') is a Russian word used to
identify an area in an ice field that is persistently free of ice,
said Arnold Gordon, a professor of physical oceanography at Columbia
University in New York.
   Some oceanographers believe the Antarctic polynyas might play a
role in the greenhouse effect that could have dire consequences in
the coming century.
   As the world's largest oceans converge in an area unofficially
named the Southern Ocean they expel heat from the tropical sun and
probably some carbon dioxide from decaying fish and plants into the
atmosphere, oceanographers say.
   ``This Antarctic zone region is very important to the global
climate because this is where the ocean loses heat to the
atmosphere,'' said Gordon, an authority on polynyas. Scientists
believe that during the winter the polynyas act like vents to
eliminate excess heat, and provide outlets for excess carbon dioxide
that could kill marine life.
   Some scientists believe the greenhouse effect is caused by excess
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from tropical deforestation and
burning fossil fuels.
   Polynyas, by venting carbon dioxide, also may be ``acting like
our burning of fossil fuels and putting more CO2 in the atmosphere
and contributing to the greenhouse effect warming of the climate,''
Gordon said.
   ``That's why it's most critical that we know in the future what
causes the polynya, what effect the heat and CO2 flux has on the
greenhouse effect and how might that be changed in the future as the
earth's atmosphere warms up.''
   In a search for those answers, Gordon has visited Antarctica
twice during the Southern Hemisphere's winter. He went in 1981 with
Soviet scientists from the Arctic-Antarctic Research Institute in
Leningrad, and in 1986 with a West German team from the Alfred
Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven.
U.S., Soviet and West German scientists plan this summer to sample
ice and water at varying depths near a large underwater ridge called
Maud Rise.
   Scientists believe this ridge and others in the ocean floor may
help create polynyas by pushing warmer water from the bottom up to
the ice cover, where it melts the ice or prevents it from forming,
Gordon said.
   Polynyas also may develop because of the Antarctic region's role
in global ocean circulation, Gordon and Josefino C. Comiso, a
physical scientist with the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, reported in Scientific American.
   ``The exchanges of energy, water and gases between the ocean and
the atmosphere around Antarctica have a major role in determining
the large-scale motion, temperature and chemical composition of the
ocean and atmosphere throughout the globe,'' Gordon and Comiso said
in their June report.
   When the sun warms the oceans in the tropics and sub-tropics,
``the warm water mixes downward by vertical turbulence _ the heat
from the upper layers is carried down by turbulence to the deep
ocean,'' Gordon says. The warm water is drawn to Antartica by a
complex process called wind-induced vertical upwelling: as the wind
blows the upper 300 feet of water northward from Antarctica, it is
replaced by the warmer, deeper water, ``like a giant conveyer belt.''
   Scientists have identified two types of polynyas in the ice
blanket that can cover an area up to twice the size of the
continental United States.
   Coastal polynyas ``are essentially sea-ice factories,'' Gordon
and Comiso wrote. They develop when strong local winds blow ice away
from the shoreline and remain unfrozen as warm water surges up from
the bottom. ``This exposes an area of open ocean on which more ice
can form, continuing the process.''
   Open-ocean polynyas form in the middle of the vast ice cover on
the ocean around Antarctica and could ``have a great effect on the
chemistry and climate of the atmosphere and the deep ocean
worldwide,'' Gordon and Comiso wrote. But they ``occur irregularly
and at this point are unpredictable,'' Gordon said.
   Scientists believe small polynyas _ about 40 square miles _
probably form for several weeks during the Antarctic winter and then
inexplicably disappear, but they've also discovered much larger
holes in the ice.
   ``They are so big that you cannot really think they do not have
any impact at all'' on the Earth's climate, Comiso said in a
telephone interview.
   In 1974, oceanographers found a polynya about the size of France
in the Weddell Sea's ice cover. During the summer, the ice melted,
as it usually does, but in the winter of 1975 the giant polynya
mysteriously reformed in just about the same area. It disappeared
again during the summer and reappeared in 1976. In 1977, it didn't
return. Smaller polynyas have developed for several weeks since then
in the same area, but the mammoth one hasn't returned.
   Another large polynya _ 36,000 square kilometers _ has been
observed since in the Cosmonaut Sea, also in an area of a large
undersea ridge, Gordon said.
   ``The real question,'' he said, ``is what causes these really big
ones, because those are the ones that will have a major impact on
the climate.''

<HEAD>Surgeon Hopes to Use Robot For Surgery By Remote Control</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WOODY BAIRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A robot surgeon that mimics and
``downsizes'' human movements could be more precise than the doctors
guiding it, says a surgeon who hopes one day to perform the most
delicate eye operations by remote control.
   Dr. Steve Charles, who has been working on his robot for about a
year, expects in another year to have equipment ready for testing on
dummy eyes in the operating room. Charles, 46, says he has spent
about $300,000 so far.
   ``Nobody else now is working on robotics operated by a human
being where it mimics his motions but downsizes them,'' he said.
   Charles' system, which uses three groups of machines and
supporting computers, would allow a doctor to view his patient's eye
on a TV screen while performing surgical movements with tools
similar in concept to joysticks used for video games. Small
mechanical arms would actually perform the surgery.
   ``One (group) would be analogous to a person's head and eye
muscles that positions the microscope,'' he said. ``The other two
robots position the surgical tools to work on a dummy head with
dummy eyes in it.''
   Charles, an engineering student in undergraduate school,
specializes in microsurgery that can require removal of tiny scars
from a patient's retina. He said the equipment could be adapted to
other delicate surgery, as well.
   ``Robots that are manually operated now are for things like
fixing up nuclear reactors, picking up submarine parts at the bottom
of the ocean or black boxes after airplane crashes, the hazardous
environment stuff,'' Charles said. ``They're like great big
gorillas. Now, we'll have a guy that is more precise than the most
precise watchmaker or surgeon ever was.''
   He hopes his robot also will let a surgeon operate on a patient
hundreds or thousands of miles away _ in remote areas or on a space
station, for example. A medical team would be required on the scene
to set up the equipment and monitor the patient, but the surgeon
could be elsewhere.
   Charles has set up the Center for Engineering Applications to
pursue his robot project and signed up Roy Williams, an electrical
engineer to handle the day-to-day lab work. The project has
attracted assistance from engineers and physicians around the
country, including specialists with the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration and the Air Force, he said.
   Charles, a member of the surgical staff at Baptist Hospital here,
has gotten a $300,000 grant from the Baptist Memorial Health Care
Foundation and is looking for further assistance from government
grants or foundations.
   ``It's the kind of thing that will never get finished,'' he said.
``It will be evolving with better performance every year. We
anticipate a budget that ultimately will approach the range of $3
million to $4 million a year.
   ``This is public domain stuff. This is not an entrepreneurial
effort on my part.''
   Much of the progress on developing the equipment will depend on
continued advances in small-motor technology and related fields, he
said. Specialists in those areas say research on small-motor
technology is a growth industry.

<HEAD>Winemaking Still an Art, Science Convention Told</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California wines, among the most manipulated
in the world, are heavily in debt to science for their quality.
   Winemaking, of course, will always be an art, said Barry Jackson,
president of thhe Harmony Wine Co. ``A winemaker is primarily a
stylist.''
   It remains for the winemaker to arrive at the crucial decisions:
when to harvest, what type of grape, how long to age it and whether
in steel or wood, Jackson told the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.
   Still, science has opened new understanding of the way grapes
grow and how they can flavor the wine, said Don Williams of Robert
Mondavi Winery. ``We've only recently learned that we can control
flavor at the grape level.''
   In the next few years, said Williams, California's traditional
bushy vines during the growing season might be replaced by
configurations including narrow leaf-walls _ to better control the
sunlight received by the vines.
   Before and during the growing season, winemakers will go into the
vineyards to try to engineer vines and leaves for sunlight and shade
to produce grapes with character, color, varietal intensity, flavor
and aroma.
   For example, a sunlight-starved vine will produce overly
herbaceous wines; grapes that have gotten lots of sun produce
brighter wines with berry flavors.
   Other elements in wine flavor aren't so easily explained. A few
years ago, at a Napa Valley tasting, judges found a wine with
overtones of eucalyptus _ they learned that a large stand of
eucalyptus trees grew near the vineyard.

<HEAD>Scientists Investigating Applications Of Solar Pump</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A solar-powered pump thhat tracks the
sun through the sky with an array of mirrors could be useful for
irrigating fields and in out-of-the-way places where maintenance is
difficult.
   A 36-square-foot array could provide power to pump 16,000 gallons
of water a day, enough to irrigate 5 to 10 acres, said Khanh Dinh of
Alachua, who began developing the pump after he left Vietnam in 1975
and got a $75,000 National Aeronautics and Space Administration
grant for the project in 1982.
   Vietnamese farmers need an effective way to irrigate rice paddies
without using diesel-fueled pumps.
   Dinh said his pump would cost about $5,000, compared with about
$1,000 for a diesel pump. Over 10 years, he estimated the diesel
pump would cost $13,000 in fuel and maintenance; the solar pump
would need little maintenance.
   University of Florida researchers are monitoring Dinh's pump
before hooking it to an actual irrigation system. Irrigating farm
fields requires a constanst flow of water, which is difficult for a
solar system, said Dorota Haman, an assistant professor in the
Agricultural Engineering Department.
   Agricultural engineering professor C. Direlle Baird said much
work needs to be done before the pump would be effective for
irrigation. A battery system to store energy for when the sun is
obscured might be too costly, he said.
   Dihn said his design effectively doubles the collection
capability of the solar panels. He also sees potential uses outside
agriculture.
   The South Florida Water Management District is considering a
solar pump in the Everglades, where diesel and electric pumps are
difficult to maintain.

<HEAD>Expedition To Vietnam Planned To Study Cranes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARABOO, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of scientists is heading later this
month to Vietnam to study the world's tallest flying bird, the Sarus
crane, as it moves slowly back into its war-ravaged Mekong Delta
habitat.
   The cranes, some of them six feet tall, have been returning to a
wetlands 200 miles west of Ho Chi Minh City that had been drained
and bombed during the Vietnam War, said International Crane
Foundation director George Archibald.
   During the Feb. 28-March 15 expedition, Archibald and other
scientists hope to use banding to determine where the birds fly to
breed in spring and summer.
   Archibald visited Vietnam last winter, and scientists from the
University of Hanoi visited Baraboo in September to learn about the
foundation.
   ``What Wisconsin is doing to protect wildlife is all very new for
them. For example, they didn't know there are certain protected
areas where people can't go. Now they understand the habitat has to
be properly managed,'' he said.

<HEAD>Sex Therapists Face Ethical Dilemma With AIDS-Infected Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AIDS is forcing sex therapists to confront new
ethical issues in deciding how to treat patients who also are
infected by the virus.
   ``Do we as physicians have the right to withhold treatment of
sexual dysfunction in patients who have a potentially lethal
disease?'' Dr. Brenda Lightfoote-Young, of the Sepulveda Veterans
Administration Hospital, asked in January's issue of The Western
Journal of Medicine.
   The ethical dilemma was illustrated by the case of a 55-year-old
AIDS-infected man who was unable to have an erection because of
circulation problems stemming from diabetes. Before the man's AIDS
infection was diagnosed, a sex therapy clinic had promised him a
device that would help him achieve and maintain erections so he
could have sex. After it was revealed the man carried the acquired
immune deficiency syndrome virus, he complained that clinic staff
members were stalling him.
   ``This patient had frequented bathhouses before his positive
(AIDS) test and was ambivalent regarding his sexual practices in the
future,'' Lightfoote-Young wrote in a letter to the journal. ``He
made no commitment ... to use his newly functional penis inside a
condom.''
   The man got the device after promising to wear a condom and
inform any sex partners that he was infected, she said in an
interview.
   His case not only raises the question of whether doctors should
withhold treatment for such people's sexual disorders, but also
whether treatment should be provided only if patients promise to
engage only ``safe'' sexual activities that won't spread the virus
to other people.
   Among the questions it raises, said Lightfoote-Young, are, ``By
what measure can we be responsible if a patient does infect another
person while using a device to enhance sexual function?
   ``If we do not treat sexual dysfunction in (AIDS-infected)
patients, are we infringing upon the rights of the individual, as
this patient alleged?
   ``And what of society and our responsibility to the health of
potential partners? Are the patient's verbal assurances sufficient,
or does there need to be a formal psychiatric assessment of a
patient's stability and reliability?''

<HEAD>Scientists Trace Salmon Runs For Catch, Conservation</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS lead to restore dropped letter in dateline</HEAD>

   Under a bright winter sun off Apple Cove
Point in Puget Sound, Miss Melanie's crew hauled in the seine and
dumped a catch of chum salmon on the deck. The net was far from
full, but there was no disappointment.
   These salmon were meant for laboratories, not dinner tables, and
the crew would be paid no matter the size of the catch. They only
needed 200 chum under the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission
contract.
   The fish were cut into samples instead of steaks so biologists
can learn more about the dozens of runs of chum returning to Puget
Sound streams, and so fisheries managers can try to maximize the
catch on strong runs, and protect weak stocks by ordering closures
for specific times and places.
   The northern sound, where it meets Admiralty Inlet is ``a big
stock area, with a wide mix of different species of salmon from
different parts of Puget Sound and Hood Canal,'' said biologist Mike
Messenger. ``Nobody really has a handle on what that mixture is.''
   Aboard the 55-foot Miss Melanie, the chum were hefted onto a
cutting table. Susan Bishop, the Indian fisheries commission's
biologist in charge, sliced the fish. ``We collect scales, record
the length of the fish and its sex, as well as take tissue samples.
We take muscle tissue, and heart and liver tissue.''
   The salmon species _ chinook or king, coho or silver, sockeye,
pink and chum _ sex and age go into a database used to determine the
catches that will be allowed next season. Test fisheries conducted
during the seasons between spring and fall will allow catch limits
to be changed mid-season.
   Besides that primary information, collection of biological
samples gives scientists much more complete data on the
stream-by-stream abundance of salmon runs, through a process called
``genetic stock identification.''
   The samples are quickly frozen on dry ice and taken to a state
Department of Fisheries lab, where they are pureed together in a
blender. The proteins are removed and put in a dyed gel, and an
electrical field is applied. The proteins leave distinctive patterns
in the gel because each accepts a charge differntly.
   With chum, stocks from each stream of origin have differing
proteins, so the numbers of fish from each stream can be calculated.
The ``base line'' for comparisons is established from chum salmon
collected from the rivers.
   ``You can break it down into fine details,'' said Ms. Bishop.
``For instance, you can break it down to the Nisqually River.''
   But salmon run estimates will remain an imprecise science with a
resource that travels thousands of miles over years before it
returns to a home stream.
   ``They won't hold still so we can count 'em,'' said Dennis
Austin, chief of harvest management for the Department of Fisheries.
``It's not like a bunch of oysters.''
   Genetic stock identification is only one of the tools used to
track fish through their life cycle from stream to ocean to stream.
Others include tagging with coded wires inserted in the fishes'
snouts, and ``otolith banding,'' which is marking the fishes'
equivalent of the inner ear for later ``reading.''
   GSI works especially well for chum because it can be used for
wild or free-spawning fish, and most chum are not hatchery stock.
However, some salmon, including sockeye, have little differences in
proteins and are thus poor candidates for the process, said Ms.
Bishop.
   However, the chum study has confirmed tagging studies showing
movement of various Puget Sound stocks of the species, she said. In
some cases, especially with depressed stocks, ``it shows we're doing
the right thing.''

   The findings of a survey of purchasing executives
indicated the economy continued to grow in January, but at a slower
rate than in previous months.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management, which tracks
the economy through its monthly survey of its members, said Sunday
its Purchasing Managers Index dropped sharply last month, to 53.2

   The nation's jobless rate inched up to 5.4
percent last month even as the economy created 408,000 new jobs, the
government said.
   Analysts said Friday the report indicates the economy may be
growing too quickly and predicted the Federal Reserve would move to
rein it in.
   January's unemployment rate was up 0.1 percentage point to 5.4
percent, the Labor Department said. But that masked the job gains
and the fact that a record 62.9 percent of working-age Americans
were at work.

   Federal authorities are reportedly increasing
their pressure on traders and brokers in an effort to win
cooperation in their investigation of fraud in the world's two
largest commodities exchanges.
   The U.S. attorney's office in Chicago has shown some futures
traders evidence of at least one type of trading offense and has
invited them to share information in exchange for immunity from
prosecution, reduced charges or a recommendation for a lenient
sentence, attorneys for some of those subpoenaed over the past two
weeks said Friday.
   The pressure increasingly applied being to selected traders and
brokers is helping to sharpen the focus of the government's two-year
undercover investigation of the Chicago Board of the Trade and the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the lawyers said.

   Share prices were lower at midday Monday, although
off the day's worst levels, as dealers questioned the market's

   Some dealers said the slide in share prices was kicked off by a
large early morning sell program. Others said shares dropped as the

   Either way, they said the market's retrenchment after a rise of
nearly 15 percent since the beginning of the year was not cause for
worry.

   Delta Air Lines and American Airlines have
announced a partnership in a new global computerized reservations
system to put an end to criticism of their own systems.
   The two airlines, who currently have the only major single-owner
reservations systems, announced Sunday that the system should
stimulate competition and ``eliminate government criticism'' of the
single-airline computerized reservations systems.
   Each airline will contribute its existing system to the new joint
venture _ American's SABRE and Delta's DATAS II.
   ``We have always maintained that the criticism (of
single-airline-owned systems) is unjustified,'' American Chairman
Robert L. Crandall said in a statement. ``On the other hand, we
would prefer to run our business rather than run a debating contest,
and we think this is a good solution for all _ our customers, our
employees and our critics.''
   Computerized reservation systems are used worldwide for reserving
airline seats, rental cars and lodging, as well as for other travel
services and management information services.
   Presently there are five such systems in the United States and
six elsewhere around the world.
   Under the American-Delta partnership, each will own 50 percent of
what Delta Chairman Ronald W. Allen termed ``the world's premier CRS
system.'' Other international and domestic airlines will have a
chance to buy in.
   ``Delta's investment in the new partnership will allow it to
become a major player in the global marketplace for travel
information,'' Allen said in a statement.
   Max D. Hopper, American's senior vice president for information
services, will be chairman of the partnership. The company will be
based in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, home of American and its
corprate parent, AMR Corp.
   The new company will contract with American's SABRE Computer
Services for computing and communications. Atlanta-based Delta,
whose DATAS II system is smaller, will pay American $650 million,
half this year and half next.

   The stock market was narrowly mixed today,
continuing the indecisive pattern of the past few sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.43 to 2,332.68 in
the first half hour of trading.
   But losers slightly outnumbered gainers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 444 up, 488 down and 511

   Volume on the Big Board came to 20.71 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said traders were leery of bidding very aggressively for
stocks, suspecting that the market was due for a pause after its
winter-long rally.
   Some observers argue that the market's early-1989 gains may have
stemmed largely from the so-called ``January effect,'' which tends
to push prices higher at the start of the year as tax selling
pressures abate.
   Traders also appeared a little confused about the state of the
economy. A Labor Department report last week showed strong growth in
payroll employment for January.
   But a monthly survey of purchasing executives indicated that
growth slowed in January from the rapid pace it set in December.

<HEAD>American Airlines in Multibillion Pact for McDonnell Douglas Jets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines will buy up to 60 new
McDonnell Douglas jets in a multibillion dollar contract that will
enable the carrier to retire many of its older wide-body jets, news
reports of the deal said today.
   Airline spokesman Ed Stewart told The Associated Press the
airline would have a major announcement Tuesday morning and declined
to elaborate. But unidentified industry sources quoted by the Dallas
Morning News and Wall Street Journal said American officials would
unveil the aircraft order then.
   The accounts said American is expected to order between 50 and 60
MD-11 wide-body jets, which carry around 320 passengers. The MD-11s
have a list price of $100 million, but American's actual purchase
price will probably be in the range of $80 million-$85 million per
plane, according to industry estimates.
   The MD-11 announcement is expected to include a handful of firm
orders for the aircraft, with the remainder in options to buy.
   American also has negotiated the purchase of as many as 100
MD-80s, a smaller twinjet manufactured by McDonnell Douglas that
sells for about $20 million apiece. But wasn't clear whether the
carrier would announce an order for that plane as well.
   Such an order marks a major victory for McDonnell Douglas in the
intense competition with larger rival Boeing Co. and the aggressive
European consortium Airbus Industrie.
   American, based in Fort Worth, Texas, is one of the biggest U.S.
carriers and McDonnell Douglas's most important customer.
   The airline has been in the market for new aircraft in part to
replace older planes in its fleet. Public concern has been growing
over U.S. airlines' aging fleets following several incidents during
the past year that suggest wear-and-tear on old airplanes can erode
their safety.
   American will use some of the MD-11s to replace DC-10s now in its
fleet. The DC-10 was the predecessor of the MD-11.

   Pennzoil Co. disclosed it has acquired an 8
percent stake in Burlington Resources Inc., a large natural gas and
mining company, revealing for the first time how it might spend its
$3 billion takeover cache.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading today, Burlington's
stock soared $8.62{ to $47.87{ a share, from $39.25 on Friday.
   Pennzoil spokesman Bob Harper said Sunday his company filed
documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday
because it had exceeded 5 percent ownership of the stock of another
company.
   ``We're going to review the situation from time to time, and we
may sell all or part of the stock,'' Harper said.
   Pennzoil said it purchased almost 8.6 million shares of
Burlington stock for about $300 million and another 3.4 million
shares as a result of a distribution by Burlington Northern Inc.
   Burlington Resources, a Seattle-based diversified resource and
energy holding company, was spun off last year from Burlington
Northern.
   A spokesman for Burlington Resources could not be reached
immediately by telephone.
   Harper said Pennzoil is not looking to force a ``merger,
reorganization, liquidation, sale or transfer of a material amount
of assets, or any change of management'' in Burlington Resources.
   On Feb. 1, Pennzoil acquired 355,000 shares of Burlington
Resources stock for an average price of $39.35 per share.
   Harper said Pennzoil was able to purchase the stock with part of
the $3 billion settlement it obtained last year following the
four-year legal battle with Texaco Inc. over the disputed ownership
of Getty Oil Co.
   Among some of Burlington Resources' operations are: Meridian Oil
Inc., an independent oil and gas producer; El Paso Natural Gas Co.,
owner and operator of a 22,000-mile interstate natural gas
transmission system; and, Plum Creek Timber Co. Inc., a timber and
forest products company.
   In splitting off Burlington Resources, Burlington Northern kept
as its major asset the Burlington Northern Railroad, the nation's
largest railroad system.
   On Dec. 15, Burlington Resources' board of directors adopted a
shareholder rights plan to protect against unwanted attempts to
acquire control of the company. At the time, company officials said
there was no known takeover effort under way.
   The plan provided for distribution of one preferred stock
purchase right as a dividend for each outstanding share of common
stock. The rights could be exercised only if a person or group
acquires 20 percent or more of the voting power of Burlington
Resources or announces a tender offer that would result in 20
percent ownership.

   Futures prices of grain and soybeans opened mostly
lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade on perceptions that
Friday's late rally had been largely unwarranted.
   The runup late in Friday's trading session was sparked by reports
that the Soviet Union had ordered the evacuation of 20 Ukrainian
villages in an area contaminated with radiation from the 1986
Chernobyl nuclear accident.
   ``You heard the word Chernobyl and everybody started to buy'' on
fears of a new radiation leak and contamination of Soviet crops,
said Victor Lespinasse, a grain trader with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. in Chicago.
   But cooler heads prevailed this morning as traders realized there
had been no new radiation leakage and no cause for alarm.
   Heavy weekend snowfall in the Corn Belt was another bearish
factor in the corn and soybean markets.
   In early trading, wheat was 1\ cents to 2\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.28 a bushel; corn was } cent to

   Live cattle were .33 cent lower to .07 cent higher with February
at 75.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .20

cent to .72 cent lower with February at 43.30 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .35 cent to .50 cent lower with February at 40.45
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures closed mostly higher on Friday.

<HEAD>Thinking Long Term</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If financial and economic proposals by Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady are representative of the Bush
administration's goals, then eyes will be focused on the long term.
   Long term is a concept that had been trampled and forgotten by
American business. In government, financial crises made
implementation impossible. At the consumer level it showed up as
spending rather than saving.
   To change such ingrained attitudes is an enormous challenge, made
even more difficult by two related symptoms of the recent past: a
deterioration of quality, and a tendency of Americans to prefer
consumption to production.
   Making it easier, however, is the fact that in some respects the
change already is in motion.
   A bit of background:
   After the easy days of the 1960s, some American industries went
to sleep, assured that they were the best and that it was up to
others to catch them. The ``others,'' such as the Japanese, caught
them and then outperformed them.
   With the pressure on, many U.S. manufacturers sought desperately
to keep sales and earnings from shrinking by resorting to
expedients. Thinking became short term to meet the immediate
challenge. Quality suffered.
   Adding to the pressure was the new attitude on Wall Street, which
stressed immediate profits rather than long-term strength. It made
investing for the long term all the more difficult. Traders wanted
results now _ not later.
   Runaway inflation worsened things, shortening the focus even
more. And rising interest rates created an almost impossible
situation. How could anyone focus on a long term that couldn't be
foreseen? Short-term survival was in.
   Eventually, American industry and government and individuals had
to face the music. While opportunists and exploiters of the
situation could benefit for the short term, such as by borrowing and
repaying in cheap dollars, the general public and its institutions
were being weakened to collapse.
   Faced with the inevitable, industry caught hold of itself, bit
the bullet, took its short-term losses, invested in capital
improvements whose payoff was years into the future, raised quality
and sought to become more competitive.
   For many companies _ automotive concerns, for example _ it paid
off, and once again they are healthy. Higher quality has been built
not just into physical facilities but into the thinking of workers
and executives.
   Unions helped, recognizing that the only way to reclaim jobs lost
to foreign companies was to restrain wages and cooperate in raising
productivity. And, as inflation cooled, realistic plans for the
future could be made again.
   The process, though under way, still has a long way to go.
   The investing scene has been a notable laggard, with corporate
raiders still seeking instant profits versus long-term performance,
and brokers urging investors to trade on short-term news rather than
investing for the future.
   In the consumer area, there is still a tendency to live beyond
means, as shown by the persistence of installment debt and a savings
rate that remains relatively low. But that too has begun to change,
and some analysts forecast a steady increase in savings as the
so-called baby-boomer generation ages.
   If there is indeed a growing tendency to think longer term today,
it seemingly couldn't be hurt by a lift from public policy.
   Among other things, Brady would consider lowering the capital
gains tax on long-term investments to just 15 percent, compared with
28 percent to 33 percent now, hoping thereby to encourage long-term
investing.
   Pension fund managers, who sit on the largest mound of financial
assets in the world, would be encouraged in ways not yet made clear
to invest for long-term rewards. And leveraged buyouts would somehow
be curtailed or discouraged.
   Whether these particular techniques will work is likely to be
debated vigorously.
   But it isn't likely that there'll be much debate about the long
term versus short term issue itself. Those bad old days are still
fresh enough to serve as a warning.

<HEAD>Rig Count Drops by 17, Totals 780</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and natural gas rigs
dropped this week by 17 to total 780 as the count continued its
see-saw activity, industry watcher Baker Hughes Inc. reported.
   Last week the number of rigs rose by eight to total 797 while
plummeting by 51 the week before. The previous three weeks the count
declined twice by 32 and once by 36, all following a two-week
increase of 25 rigs.
   A year ago, the number of rigs totaled 986, Baker Hughes said
Monday.
   The decline follows normal seasonal patterns, according to Baker
Hughes economist Ike Kerridge. The count usually drops off during
late December through late March or early April, he said.
   The count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity
and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of
last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per
42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the
rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began
compiling figures.
   The lowest level last year was the reported 880 rigs on May 2.
   Among major oil producing states, California and Oklahoma saw a
decline at four, followed by Ohio, two; and Michigan, New Mexico,
North Dakota, Pennsylvania and Texas, one each.
   Colorado, Kansas and Louisiana had gains of two each while
Wyoming had one.

<HEAD>Mexico Decides Against $3.5 Billion US Loan Although Offer Still
Open</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A U.S. offer of a $3.5 billion emergency loan
remains open, officials said Monday, even though Mexico has decided
not to borrow the money and is trying to renegotiate payments on its
crippling foreign debt.
   Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe was beginning talks in Washington,
armed with what aides described as a ``menu of options'' for
repaying the $106 billion Mexico owes foreign creditors.
   Late Sunday, the Treasury Department issued a brief statement
saying Mexico would not use the $3.5 billion short-term loan the
U.S. offered in October.
   The money, the largest single U.S. loan ever offered to a
debt-burdened nation, was intended as a cushion against political
and economic instablity during a change in administrations.
   U.S. officials said the money is still available if Mexico wants
it.
   ``The offer does not expire until April,'' U.S. embassy spokesman
Steve Telkins said in a telephone interview.
   The Treasury Department statement said Mexico didn't need the
$3.5 billion short-term loan because the Bank of Mexico's
international reserves stopped falling in December. It did not
elaborate.
   The loan was aimed at helping Mexico weather the sensitive months
before the Dec. 1 inauguration of President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari.
   A change of administrations in Mexico historically has been
marked by a drain on capital caused by businesses and the wealthy,
who fear changes in economic policies and send money abroad as a
protection. The United States wanted to help Mexico avoid the
pressure such an exodus puts on the peso currency, which has been
devalued severely over the past several years.
   The bank has said about $1.6 billion has returned to Mexico in
recent months.
   The loan also was intended to tide Mexico over until it could
renegotiate new credit packages with the International Monetary Fund
and other world lending institutions.
   Salinas is facing widespread public impatience with a 7-year-old
economic crisis that has stagnated growth and halved the average
worker's buying power.
   Voters gave him the smallest victory margin in 60 years of his
ruling party's history in the July 6 election and even this slim
victory was clouded by widespread allegations of fraud.
   Salinas has said renegotiating the debt is his top priority and
that payments must be cut enough to let Mexico's economy start
growing again.
   Mexico has been devoting the equivalent of nearly six per cent of
its gross national product to satisfy debt payments. Last year the
payments, most of them interest, came to about $13 billion.
   About 40 percent of the foreign debt, the second-largest in the
developing world after Brazil's, is owed to U.S. banks.
   There was no official comment from the Treasury Department Monday
on what options Aspe planned to present to creditors in Washington,
but news reports said that among the ideas under consideration were
debt-for-investment swaps, in which creditor banks would exchange
some debt for an equity stake in Mexican businesses.

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which started 1989 with
five consecutive weeks of gains, fell 9.82 to 2,321.43 by 2 p.m.
today on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading

   Investors also appeared a little confused about the state of the
economy. A Labor Department report last week showed strong growth in
payroll employment for January.
   But a monthly survey of purchasing executives indicated that
growth slowed in January from the rapid pace it set in December.

<HEAD>Restructuring Costs Result In 1988 Loss For Manville</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manville Corp., which emerged from Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection in November, on Monday reported it lost $1.31
billion in the fourth quarter because of costs from its
restructuring.
   The loss in the final quarter of the year compared with a $59.98
million shortfall in the same period of 1987.
   The results of the latest quarter reflected a $1.3 billion charge
from Manville's Chapter 11 reorganization.
   Manville President Tom Stephens said in a statement the company
expected the charge as ``the price we knew we had to pay to put our
asbestos financial obligations behind us.''
   The company filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws in
1982 because of claims from people who suffered illnesses because of
contact with asbestos.
   Without the charge, Manville said it would have lost $26.3
million in the fourth quarter.
   Manville reported fourth-quarter sales of $522.1 million, up from
$486 million a year earlier.
   For the full year, Manville reported a loss of nearly $1.3
billion, compared to earnings of $72.6 million, or 61 cents per
share, in all of 1987.
   The full-year loss also included a $139 million pre-tax charge
for environmental cleanup costs, and a $107 million charge for an
accounting change.
   Without the charges, Manville said it would have earned nearly
$96 million in 1988.
   Full-year sales totaled $2.06 billion, up from $1.94 billion.

<HEAD>London Shares Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices fell sharply Monday on the London
Stock Exchange, depressed largely by data showing British retail
sales were higher in December than had been initially reported.
   The data, which dispelled some hopes of an early cut in domestic
interest rates, added to profit-taking pressure, which followed the
market's surge of about 250 points since the start of the year.
   At the close of trading the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was down 25.6 points, or 1.23 percent, at 2,044.3. A
weak opening on Wall Street helped drag the London index down as
much as 26.4 points in the late afternoon.
   Volume was moderate, with 561.5 million shares changing hands,
well below Friday's turnover of 768.7 million shares.
   The market's recent strong rise has been partly due to
indications of a slowdown in consumer demand, which in turn helped
to inspire hopes of a cut in British interest rates, perhaps around
the time of the fiscal 1990 budget presentation in March.
   Those hopes were at least partly dispelled by a revision to the
December retail sales figures, which were adjusted upward to a gain
of 0.3 percent from a preliminary reported decline of 0.1 percent.
   The narrower Financial Times 30-share index was down 20.8 points
at 1,668.2.
   The Financial Times 500-share index closed at 1,155.17, down
12.61.

   President Bush's plan to bail out the savings
and loan industry will include a temporary hike in insurance
premiums paid by banks and S&amp;Ls as well as a revamped regulatory
structure, an industry official said today.
   Earlier, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush would
announce his plan to resolve the S&amp;L crisis at a late-afternoon news
conference and would not propose that depositors be required to pay
a fee.
   Banks have been given assurances that the money raised by the
higher premiums will go into their own insurance fund and will not
directly pay for the S&amp;L problem, said the source, who was briefed
by White House aides but declined to be identified.
   However, for budget purposes, the money raised by the premiums
will count as revenue. Thus, in an arrangement envisioned by White
House budget director Richard Darman, the government would be able
to spend several billions of taxpayer dollars a year without adding
to the budget deficit, a government official said.
   Insurance premiums are currently 83 cents per $1,000 for banks
and $2.08 for S&amp;Ls. The increase mentioned, at least before Bush
reviewed the plan, would bring the premiums to about $1.80 per
$1,000 for banks and $2.50 for S&amp;Ls. That would raise about half the
$7 billion to $9 billion needed each year.
   Another element of the plan would merge the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., which insures bank deposits, with the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. A new five-member board would
oversee the two insurance funds.
   Meanwhile, a separate three-member board chaired by the secretary
of the Treasury would control the spending of the new money raised
to close or sell the 350 insolvent S&amp;Ls remaining open.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board will lose control of the S&amp;L
insurance fund and it will be brought into the Treasury Department
in a system similar to the one used for banks, where the regulatory
agency, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is part of
the Treasury.
   A presidential aide, Richard C. Breeden, and Federal Reserve
Board Chairman Alan Greenspan advocate this arrangement, which will
be strongly opposed by the S&amp;L industry which wants to keep its
regulator independent of other government controls, the industry
official said.
   ``The president will propose a permanent and comprehensive
solution to the S&amp;L situation ... as well as a financing arrangement
that does not include depositor fees,'' spokesman Fitzwater said
earlier.
   The plan ``will deal with problem thrifts as well as the
foundation for future stability in the industry,'' he said.
   ``The president will propose reforms in the federal regulatory
structure ... (and) he will assure all Americans that the full faith
and credit of the United States government stands behind their
deposits and that the American banking system remains sound,'' the
spokesman said.
   Fitzwater said the administration had conferred with
congressional leaders and said, ``We think there'll be general
support for this proposal.''
   Another financing problem is how to sell the bonds without
inflating the government's already huge $2.7 trillion national debt.
   A way around that is to cover the principal of the bonds with
several billion dollars in retained earnings at the regional Federal
Home Loan Banks, which are owned by the industry. That way, only the
annual interest paid on the bonds would be ``on-budget.''
   However the money is raised, Congress and the administration are
sure to assume more control over how it is spent. Members of
Congress have complained bitterly about S&amp;L regulators' power to
write promissory notes committing the government to vast
expenditures that the regulators cannot pay _ in effect writing
checks that Congress later will be forced to cover with
appropriations.
   Other likely recommendation would require S&amp;L owners to put up
more of their own money, force S&amp;Ls to keep more cash reserves for
liquidity, limit the amount they can loan to a single borrower and
more strictly control who can buy or start an S&amp;L.

<TEXT>
   After more than two years of taunts, feints and
jabs, Eastern Airlines management and its largest union are standing
toe-to-toe with a potential slugfest threatening the money-losing
carrier's survival.
   The National Mediation Board, a year after entering Eastern
contract talks with its Machinists union, last week declared an
impasse and began a 30-day cooling-off period that ends March 3.
   If no settlement is reached by then, the company would impose its
last contract offer _ $150 million in salary cuts _ and the
8,500-member union, representing more than one-fourth of Eastern
employees, would be allowed to strike.
   The two sides are $200 million apart, with the Machinists' last
offer seeking a $50 million raise. But money is only part of the
confrontation marked by deep philosophical differences.
   Veteran Eastern Machinistsleader Charles E. Bryan, the District
100 president, has tried unsuccessfully to engineer an
employee-controlled takeover, believing that a company whose workers
have a say in decision-making and a stake in profits will work
efficiently and productively. He believes his workers have been
paying for poor management for years and have current management
that doesn't care about Eastern's future.
   The Eastern management put in place by Houston-based Texas Air
Corp. since it took over the carrier 2{ years ago seeks a lean
operation with the shots called by corporate executives. They see an
airline with good routes, experience and overall good structure that
needs to reduce operating costs _ mainly labor _ to turn around
after losing $1 billion the past decade.
   Bryan played a leading role in bringing down former Eastern
leader Frank Borman, the Apollo astronaut replaced after Texas Air
bought Eastern in an 11th-hour deal in February 1986.
   But Eastern's new management features airline experience directed
by Frank Lorenzo, a bottom-line entrepreneur who got rid of
Continental Airlines' unions after taking over that airline.
   Bryan went to the floor of the Eastern shareholders' meeting
arguing against the Texas Air takeover, and he has been the focus
since of widespread Eastern labor opposition to the new management,
whose style has aggravated traditionally tense labor relations at
Eastern.
   The Machinists, pilots and flight attendants unions have tried to
head off management at any pass, waging myriad lawsuits and
grievances and lobbying politicians.
   But recent months have seen events going the cost-cutting
management's way.
   It won court approval for 4,000 layoffs and major route cuts last
year, along with the $365 million sale of its profitable Northeast
shuttle to New York developer Donald Trump. The Department of
Transportation refused to reopen last year's probe that concluded
Eastern was operated safely.
   Management has been lobbying for months for declaration of an
impasse, insisting that Bryan and the IAM won't seriously negotiate
until they are faced with a deadline.
   Bryan says management has been trying to provoke a strike and
will try to break the strike and bust Eastern's unions. Bryan said
that he'll work for a settlement, but his union will be ready for a
``wing-ding of a strike.''
   The National Mediation Board's lead mediator, Harry Bickford, has
met with both sides separately in recent days and is expected to
continue such ``shuttle diplomacy.'' If talks get to the final 10
days, NMB Chairman Walter C. Wallace will jawbone the two sides in
``super-mediation,'' participants expect.
   It seems unlikely there will be any settlement before the final
few hours, putting pressure on travel agents. But Eastern management
is counting on strong frequent-flier business travel to stick with
the airline despite uncertainty.
   Eastern has been to the brink before. In 1983, the Machinists
went to the final days of a cooling-off period before a settlement
was reached. In 1986, strikes and bankruptcy were hours away when
deals were cut to avoid selling Eastern.

<HEAD>Grains, Soybean Futures Tumble In Surprising Sell-Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices of corn and soybeans fell sharply
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade, resuming a trend that had been
interrupted in Friday's session by unwarranted fears of a radiation
leak in the Soviet Union.
   Wheat and oat futures also closed lower.
   Grain futures gave back all the gains posted Friday, when a late
rally was sparked by reports that the Soviet Union had ordered the
evacuation of 20 Ukrainian villages in an agricultural area
contaminated with radiation from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident.
   The mere mention of the Chernobyl incident apparently was enough
to prompt heavy buying of U.S. grain futures on Friday. But the
realization that there had been no new radiation leakage was a key
factor in Monday's sell-off, analysts said.
   Analysts said heavy weekend snow in the Corn Belt, which will add
badly needed moisture to the soil, also contributed to Monday's
decline.
   At the close of trading, wheat was 1 cent to 4{ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in March at $4.25} a bushel; corn was 4}
cents to 6 cents lower with March at $2.66\ a bushel; oats were 4
cents to 4} cents lower with March at $2.14{ a bushel; soybeans were
11 cents to 16{ cents lower with March at $7.54 a bushel.

   Satellites will continue to be competitive with
undersea fiber optic cables for communications between continents
over the next 15 years, according to a study released Monday by a
satellite company.
   The study by Communications Satellite Corp. disproves the notion
that fiber optic cables are destined to drive satellites out of
business, said Richard McGraw, a company spokesman.
   Comsat, a private company based in Washington, D.C., that
provides satellite service, is the U.S. government's representative
to the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization.
   The study covered the period from 1995 to 2005. Comsat said that
was as far into the future as it could make realistic predictions.
   McGraw said Comsat was sensitive to appearances that it would tip
the findings in favor of satellites and had actually given the
benefit of the doubt to fiber optics in cost comparisons.

   Stock prices retreated Monday amid some evident
doubts about the staying power of the market's recent rally.
   But activity remained lively in stocks of several companies
involved in takeover news or rumors.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which started 1989 with
five consecutive weeks of gains, fell 10.18 to 2,321.07.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
636 up, 786 down and 517 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 150.98 million
shares, down from 172.98 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 178.50 million shares.
   Analysts said traders were leery of bidding very aggressively for
stocks, suspecting that the market was due for a pause after its
winter-long rally.
   Some observers argue that the market's early-1989 gains may have
stemmed largely from the so-called ``January effect,'' which tends
to push prices higher at the start of the year as tax selling
pressures abate.
   In theory at least, this positive influence is now subsiding.
   Investors also appeared a little confused about the state of the
economy. A Labor Department report last week showed strong growth in
payroll employment for January.
   But a monthly survey of purchasing executives indicated that
growth slowed in January from the rapid pace it set in December.
   Burlington Resources jumped 9~ to 49[ as the most active NYSE
issue. Pennzoil Co. said it had acquired 8 percent of the company's

   Formica Corp. climbed 4} to 21{. The company agreed to an
$18-a-share buyout by an investor group, and speculation mounted

   De Soto Inc. gained 8{ to 49{ on word that an investment group

   The dollar fell Monday against several major
foreign currencies but edged up against the British pound and
Japanese yen in a mixed session marked by more dollar sales by the
central banks.
   Foreign-exchange dealers in Europe said the absence of any strong
policy statements arising from the Group of Seven industrialized
nations meeting in Washington Friday provided the foundation for a
further strengthening of the dollar.
   The bullishness was dampened by intervention from the Federal
Reserve, West German Bundesbank and other European central banks,
which sold dollars to stem the U.S. currency's rise.
   The dollar edged up again after the central banks' intervention
ended, but then went into an afternoon slide and ended the day near
its lows, according to Ian Spence, chief currency dealer for
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.43 yen to close at 129.70. Later in London it was
quoted at 129.60 yen. In New York the dollar edged up to 129.41 yen
from 129.40 on Friday.
   In London, one pound cost $1.7345, cheaper for buyers than the
$1.7410 exchange rate late Friday. The pound also fell against the
dollar in New York to $1.7366 from $1.7420.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Friday, included: 1.8725 West German marks, down from 1.8790; 1.5898
Swiss francs, down from 1.5949; 1.1823 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1833; 6.3705 French francs, down from 6.3880; and 1,366.5 Italian
lire, down from 1,371.8.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday,
included: 1.8810 West German marks, up from 1.8805; 1.5969 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5983; 6.3950 French francs, unchanged; 2.1200
Dutch guilders, down from 2.1240; 1,370.50 Italian lire, down from
1,374.50; 1.1840 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1885.
   Gold prices were mixed. Gold bullion traded in London at a late
bid price of $388.95 a troy ounce, up from $388.25 bid late Friday.
In Zurich, Switzerland, the bid price was $387.50, down from $389.90
bid late Friday.
   Financial markets were closed in Hong Kong on Monday for the
Chinese Lunar New Year holiday. They reopen Thursday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $394 a troy ounce from $393.10 on Friday. Later,
Republic National Bank of New York said gold bullion was bid at
$391.90 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up from $391.50 late Friday.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.82 a troy ounce,
down from Friday's $5.83. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery rose to $5.897 a troy ounce from $5.835 on Friday.

<HEAD>Pork Futures Collapse On Milder-Than-Expected Weather</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pork futures prices collapsed Monday in a disappointed reaction
to indications that wintry conditions in the Midwest had not slowed
the movement of hogs to packing houses.
   In other markets, orange-juice futures continued to decline;
grain and soybean futures fell sharply; precious metals advanced;
and energy futures weakened.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live hog futures finished .50
cent to 1.42 cents lower with the contract for delivery in February
at 42.70 cents a pound. Most contracts for future delivery of frozen
pork bellies plummeted the permitted daily limit of 2 cents with
February settling at 38.82 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures fared much better. Live cattle settled .40 cent
lower to .10 cent higher with February at 75.40 cents a pound;
feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .40 cent higher with March at
84.47 cents a pound.
   Expectations for a cold-weather slump in hog marketings turned
out to be a bust for speculators who had bid pork futures up sharply
on Friday.
   Instead of a decline, packers reported that hog marketings over
the weekend and on Monday were higher than both week-ago and
year-ago levels. The hog flow in Iowa and southern Minnesota, for
example, totaled 120,000 head on Monday, compared with 110,000 a
week earlier and 95,000 a year ago.
   Spot-market prices for hogs plunged by as much as 3 cents a pound
and the futures market followed suit with pork-belly contracts
leading the way.
   ``That's what happens when you don't get enough of a storm,''
said Tom O'Hare, a livestock-market analyst in New York with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   The plunging pork prices led to some weakness in the cattle
market, but many cattle traders were reluctant to sell ahead of
Wednesday's national cattle inventory report from the Agriculture
Department.
   That report is expected to show the nation's cattle herd as of
Jan. 1 at its lowest level since 1960, said Charles Levitt, senior
livestock analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago.
   Weather-related selling also hit orange-juice futures on the New
York Cotton Exchange.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice settled 4 cents to 4.6 cents
lower with March at $1.354 a pound as fears of a freeze in the
Florida citrus groves continued to ease.
   Corn and soybean futures fell sharply on the Chicago Board of
Trade, resuming a trend that had been interrupted in Friday's
session by unwarranted fears of a radiation leak in the Soviet Union.
   Wheat and oat futures also closed lower.
   Grain futures gave back all the gains posted Friday, when a late
rally was sparked by reports that the Soviet Union had ordered the
evacuation of 20 Ukrainian villages in an agricultural area
contaminated with radiation from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident.
   The mere mention of the Chernobyl incident apparently was enough
to prompt heavy buying of U.S. grain futures on Friday. But the
realization that there had been no new radiation leakage was a key
factor in Monday's sell-off, analysts said.
   Wheat settled } cent to 4{ cents lower with March at $4.25} a
bushel; corn was 4} cents to 6 cents lower with March at $2.66{ a
bushel; oats were 4 cents to 4} cents lower with March at $2.14{ a
bushel; soybeans were 12 cents to 16\ cents lower with March at
$7.54\ a bushel.
   Gold and silver futures advanced on New York's Commodity Exchange
in active late buying after being down for most of the session.
   Gold settled 40 cents to 90 cents higher with April at $396.90 a
troy ounce; silver was 6 cents to 6.5 cents higher with February at
$5.897 a troy ounce.
   Most energy futures retreated in mostly technical selling on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 15 cents to 23 cents
lower with March at $17.38 a barrel; heating oil was .31 cent lower
to .05 cent higher with March at 50.36 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .51 cent lower to .01 cent higher with March at 48.74
cents a gallon.

<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices were mostly lower in light
trading Monday, influenced in part by OPEC-related concerns.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, settled
15 cents lower at $17.38 a barrel after seesawing last week.
   Other contract months also declined.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the March contract
for domestic heating oil rose 0.5 cent to 50.36 cents a gallon but
other contract months fell.
   Unleaded gasoline for March delivery closed 0.43 cent lower at
48.74 cents a gallon with other contract months ending the day mixed.
   Analysts said prices were little influenced by the cold weather,
despite rumors of refinery slowdowns in southern Texas. They said
the cold weather arrived late in the season, after most buyers had
already purchased their winter stocks.
   Jim Fiedler, vice president of E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures
Inc., attributed much of the price decline to technical factors.
   ``They're looking for a new support level, probably heading down
to $17,'' Fiedler said.
   Prices also came under pressure from a report by the Middle East
Economic Survey, a respected industry publication, that Iran had a
large buildup of unsold inventory that it was looking to get rid of,
said Nauman Barakat, vice president of energy investments at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``My own opinion is that Iran won't dump it, but the question is,
what will they do with it?'' Barakat said.
   Since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries lowered
its production by some 4 million barrels a day to 18.5 million
barrels on Jan. 1, market observers have expressed concern over the
whereabouts of all the excess oil.
   Many had expected world oil prices to remain soft while the
oversupply came on the market. Instead, prices have soared over the
last several weeks, leaving analysts to wonder what happened to the
excess.
   Monday's report on Iran was one of the first to confirm existence
of the excess petroleum.

<HEAD>Pennzoil Says Purchase of Burlington Stock Is Investment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA TOLLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pennzoil Co.'s disclosure of a stake in Burlington
Resources Inc. raised speculation Monday that the oil company has
found a way to spend a big chunk of the $3 billion cache won from a
protracted battle with Texaco Inc.
   Although Pennzoil said it had acquired about 12 million shares of
Burlington as an investment, or about an 8 percent interest, the
company did not rule out future transactions.
   ``We may dispose of all our part (of the stock) or we may buy
additional shares,'' Pennzoil spokesman Bob Harper said.
   Harper said Houston-based Pennzoil is not looking to force a
``merger, reorganization, liquidation, sale or transfer of a
material amount of assets, or any change of management'' in
Burlington, a large Seattle-based diversified resource and energy
holding company.
   On the New York Stock Exchange Monday, Burlington's stock soared
$9.87{ a share to $49.12{ compared with Friday's close. Pennzoil
closed up $1.50 at $83.25 a share.
   Pennzoil filed documents with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on Friday because it had exceeded 5 percent ownership of
Burlington stock, Harper said. Under SEC rules, any investment in a
publicly held company that passes the 5 percent threshhold must be
reported to the federal agency.
   Pennzoil disclosed it had bought nearly 8.6 million shares of
Burlington Resources stock for about $300 million and got 3.4
million more shares as a result of a distribution by Burlington
Northern Inc. In addition, Pennzoil purchased another 355,000 shares
earlier this month, the company said.
   Burlington Resources was spun off last year from Burlington
Northern.
   The stock acquisition was an investment, but Pennzoil said in its
SEC filing it will take ``actions deemed appropriate'' pending its
continued review of Burlington's business affairs.
   A spokesman for Burlington Resources did not return telephone
calls Monday.
   Industry observers have been waiting to see how Pennzoil would
spend the $3 billion settlement it received last April from Texaco
to end the companies' four-year legal battle over Texaco's
acquisition of Getty Oil Co.
   Prior to the Burlington stock purchase, Pennzoil's only major
investment since the Texaco settlement had been the $250 million
purchase of Facet Enterprise Inc. of Oklahoma City. Facet
manufactures automotive parts and oil-field equipment.
   One analyst said Monday that Pennzoil's stock acquisition doesn't
mean Burlington is an actual takeover target.
   ``Their move is perplexing,'' said Paul Kuklinski of Cowen &amp; Co.
in Boston. ``It is not clear to me if this is anything more than an
investment. Typically, when a company acquires this size of stock,
the intention is fairly evident, but not this time.''
   Kuklinski said that in the past, Pennzoil has acquired fairly
good amounts of stock for investment purposes and not followed
through with takeover attempts.
   In addition, Burlington has some attractive assets it would be
expensive to buy, he said.
   But other analysts said they believe Pennzoil is positioning
itself for a takeover _ whether by accumulating more stock on the
open market or by making an offer _ before Burlington has the
opportunity to put up more barriers.
   Burlington has shown little interest in being acquired,
installing a ``poison pill'' and other takeover defenses in
December. The pill, designed to make an unwelcome takeover
prohibitively expensive, would be triggered when a hostile bidder
acquired 20 percent or more of the voting power of Burlington
Resources.
   ``The cat is in the bag. I'm sure they won't sit on their hands
on this one. I think they will actively pursue something one way or
another,'' said Ron Londe, an analyst with A.G. Edwards in St. Louis.
   Londe said Pennzoil likely won't take the whole company, but
``gas reserves are first on the menu.''
   Burlington is believed to hold the largest natural gas reserves
in the United States outside of the major oil companies, with a
nearly 18-year supply, compared with an industry average of 10 years.
   A merger of Pennzoil and Burlington would propel the company into
a position just under the majors in natural gas reserves, Londe said.
   ``They would have 5.8 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves _ that
means a lot,'' he said.
   Burlington Resources' largest units include El Paso Natural Gas
Co., which consists of a 22,000-mile interstate gas transmission
system extending from West Texas to California and Meridian Oil Co.,
one of the nation's largest independent oil and gas companies.
   Burlington also has extensive mining operations, including gold,
and more than a million acres of timberland.
   Analysts valued Burlington Resources stock at between $49 and $51
a share.

   GMI Management &amp; Engineering Institute said
Monday it will use a $2 million grant from the Mott Foundation to
create an endowment fund benefiting minority students.
   The fund mainly will finance scholarships and also may be used

schools, the statement said.
   The grant was expected to help GMI expand its current minority
enrollment of 13.6 percent. Total enrollment currently exceeds 2,600.
   GMI was founded in 1919 by General Motors Corp. and became
independent in 1982. It offers bachelor of science degrees in
mechanical, industrial, electrical and manufacturing systems
engineering and management systems in five-year programs. A master's
degree is offered in manufacturing management.
   GMI students alternate 12-week periods of classroom and
laboratory studies with work experience at about 600 business and

<HEAD>GM Announces Dividends, Stock Split</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp.'s board of directors on
Monday declared a 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a 100 percent
dividend on GM $1 2-3 par value common stock.
   Directors in New York declared the stock split after approving a
20 percent increase in the per-share dividend on the common stock,
GM said in a statement.
   The board also increased the per-share dividend on Class E and
Class H common stock by 41 percent and 64 percent, respectively, the
statement said.
   Dividends for the first quarter of 1989 came to $1.50 per share
of $1 2-3 par value common stock, 24 cents per share of Class E and
18 cents per share of Class H, payable March 10 to shareholders of
record Feb. 16, the statement said. The dividend resulting from the
2-for-1 split was payable March 31 to shareholders of record Feb.
17, it said.
   ``The fact that GM can take these actions ... is further
important evidence of the great strength of the company and in
particular the continued success of GM's reindustrialization
program,'' GM Chairman Roger B. Smith said.
   ``The stock dividend is expected to make GM $1 2-3 common stock
more affordable for individual investors following the stock's
significant appreciation over the past year,'' Smith said.
   To reflect the split, the GM board increased the number of $1 2-3
common shares covered by its stock repurchase program from 64
million to 128 million, the statement said. GM announced the program
in March 1987 and had repurchased 27.8 million shares on a
post-split basis through Dec. 31, 1988, it said.
   GM said it has completed its initial repurchase of 5 million
Class E shares and has bought 1.9 million of 5 million shares under
a second Class E repurchase program begun in May 1988.
   Through December 1988, GM had obtained 3 million of 10 million
Class H shares under a repurchase program begun in March 1987 the
statement said.
   GM also has continued repurchasing shares in each of the three
categories of stocks to meet benefit plan requirements, the
statement said.

<HEAD>Fourth-Quarter Earnings Fall 32 Percent, Huge Loss For Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   LTV Corp., the troubled aerospace-steelmaker, said
Monday its profit dropped 32 percent in the fourth-quarter,
primarily because of a charge involving an accounting change for
medical and life insurance benefits.
   For the year, the company said it lost $3.15 billion, mainly due
to special charges taken earlier in the year. The company has been
operating under bankruptcy court protection for more than two years
while it struggles to find a formula to cut expenses and pay
creditors.
   The company said fourth-quarter results were hurt by a $33.8
million charge relating to medical and life insurance benefits.
   It said other factors contributing to the fourth-quarter profit
decline included a steep drop in aerospace and defense earnings,
absence of operating income from the Warren, Ohio, steel facility it
sold last June and exclusion of results for the steel bar division,
which will be sold.
   For the quarter, after-tax profit totaled $95.3 million, or 67
cents per share, compared with $140.6 million, or $1.01 per share,
in 1987.
   Fourth-quarter revenue fell 16.1 percent to $1.67 billion from
$1.99 billion a year earlier.
   The company's huge 1988 loss contrasts to a profit of $502.6
million, or $3.67 a share, in the previous year.
   Revenue for the year fell 3 percent to $7.32 billion from $7.58
billion in 1987.
   LTV officials said the annual loss resulted in part from Chapter
11-related, non-cash special charges of $1.35 billion taken earlier
in 1988. It also included a one-time, non-cash charge of $2.26
billion taken in the third quarter for what the company anticipates
will be its potential liability in health insurance costs of 118,000
current and retired employees.
   ``While special charges led to a net loss, overall operating
results continued to show a positive trend,'' said Raymond A. Hay,
LTV chairman and chief executive. ``They demonstrate that LTV's
businesses are sound and that the company is taking the right steps
to make its operations efficient and competitive.
   ``The deferral of interest, pension and other costs while in
Chapter 11 continues to be the major factor contributing to positive
results,'' Hay said. ``However, strong demand for steel and improved
steel prices were also important contributors for both the quarter
and the year.''

<HEAD>Securities Analysts Generally Applaud Bush Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite some reservations, securities analysts
generally applauded President Bush's announcement Monday of a
savings and loan industry bailout plan that includes higher federal
insurance premiums for banks as well as thrifts.
   ``It's something the whole system can live with,'' James Wilson,
an analyst with Sutro &amp; Co. in San Francisco, said of the deposit
insurance premium hike, a key part of Bush's proposal.
   Under Bush's plan, the higher premiums would be used to help pay
the interest on $50 billion in bonds to finance the bailout of
insolvent thrifts.
   ``It's a big dollar figure, but it's an enormous industry _ the
effect on individual depositors or homebuyers isn't going to be
enough for them to notice signficantly,'' Wilson said.
   Allan Bortel, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in San
Francisco, said ``the premiums that are being increased are very
small _ it doesn't raise much more money each year from savings
instiutions.''
   ``It doesn't seem to be onerous for the S&amp;Ls,'' he said.
   But James Marks, of SNL Securities in Hoboken, N.J., said the
proposed increase could force some shaky thrifts over the edge.
   ``They can't afford to pay as much as they are now,'' Marks said.
``To increase them...could force thrifts that would otherwise have
survived into insolvency.''
   The analysts said banks and thrifts could be expected to pass on
at least a portion of their costs to consumers, possibly in the form
of lower interest rates on savings accounts or in higher service or
loan charges.
   But the analysts did not expect depositors to withdraw money from
S&amp;Ls because of the possibility they might ultimately pay for the
higher premiums.
   ``With the rise in short-term interest rates, money market funds
are extremely attractive right now,'' Marks said. ``People are
looking at what they can get, but it has nothing to do with this.''
   Analysts said people who are concerned about the safety of their
money will leave it in thrifts because those deposits are
federally-insured while money market funds are not, making them
slightly riskier.
   Bush also recommended combining the Federal Savings &amp; Loan
Insurance Corp. which insures deposits at thrifts, with the
insurance fund for banks, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., while
keeping each agency's funds separate.
   The president proposed regulatory changes, including steps to
reduce the type of risky investments that got the industry into
difficulty. He also suggested that insolvent savings and loan
institutions be placed under the joint control of the FDIC and FSLIC.
   ``You have a much larger staff they can work with at the FDIC,
some of them quite experienced in real estate,'' a trouble spot for
many thrifts, Sutro said.
   Overall, the analysts were pleased that the government was trying
to end the thrift crisis, which has seen hundreds of S&amp;Ls forced
into insolvency.
   But, said Wilson, ``To some degree, it's almost too little too
late.'' Most of the problems that led to thrift bailouts _ such as
mismanagement or fraud at some institutions and the economic
depression in the Southwest _ have already happened, he said.
   However, the plan should be ``more expeditious in solving the
current problems,'' Wilson said.
   Shearson's Bortel called Bush's proposals a step in the right
direction but said they did not provide enough money for the
hundreds of savings institutions that still are short of funds.

   President Bush's proposed rescue package for
the savings and loan industry, while praised as a good starting
point, raised immediate questions on Monday concerning the huge
burden being placed on taxpayers.
   Members of Congress and the financial industry said the plan is
likely to be substantially modified before winningcongressional
approval although officials gave Bush credit for moving quickly to
address the crisis.
   ``The president deserves credit for at least putting a plan on
the table,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. and a member of the
House Banking Committee. ``He faced up to a difficult problem that
President Reagan spent a year ducking.''
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole said Bush's proposal ``gives us
a starting point. We'll probably have a lot of people who don't like
this plan.''
   Dole himself raised questions about the amount of the tab
taxpayers will be asked to shoulder. Bush's budget director, Richard
Darman, estimated that the cost in direct taxpayer funds would
amount to $39.9 billion over the next 10 years.
   Dole called that figure ``a little high. It would begin to crowd
some of these other programs Congress wants, like education, the
environment. ... I would propose we shrink the taxpayer impact.''
   Barney Beeksman, chairman of the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions, the largest lobbying group for the S&amp;L industry, said
in a statement he was glad Bush dropped his proposal to impose a
premium tax on depositors but he said the league had reservations
about other parts of the plan.
   ``We are neither endorsing nor rejecting it,'' Beeksman said.
``There are components of the president's proposal that would be
burdensome to our industry if adopted, but we see today's proposal
as a first step only.''
   Bud Koch, chairman of the National Council of Savings
Institutions, another S&amp;L trade association, said his organization
was unhappy because Bush's plan would not eliminate the discrepancy
between S&amp;Ls and banks over the amount they pay in deposit insurance
premiums.
   ``The basic inequalities that the healthy S&amp;Ls have lived under
for four years are still there,'' said Koch, the president of First
Federal Savings Bank of Cleveland.
   The American Bankers Association said in a statement that it was
glad that the nation's banks were not being asked to pay to resolve
the S&amp;L crisis.
   ``The burden to fund this crisis will fall largely on the savings
and loans, themselves, where it belongs,'' said C.G. Holthus,
president-elect of the ABA. ``We are encouraged that apparently
banks and their customers will not be asked to bail out the S&amp;Ls.''
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan appeared at Bush's news
conference where the plan was unveiled and in a statement issued
later expressed support for the proposal.
   ``This comprehensive package of measures to strengthen the thrift
industry, and depository institutions generally, should assure that
the problems that occurred in the savings and loans will not happen
again,'' Greenspan said in a statement.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, chairman of the House Banking Committee,
said he was withholding judgment on Bush's proposal until it was
analyzed.
   But he praised Bush and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady ``for
their sensitivity to the seriousness of the problem and for
presenting, under pressure, a formal proposal worthy of careful and
most serious consideration.''
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich., the chairman of the Senate
Banking Committee, promised to move the legislation quickly.
   ``I think the proposal is by and large a sensible proposal,'' he
said. ``I think the structural reforms make sense'' and the proposed
changes in the law would ``put an end to the excessive practices''
that have led so many S&amp;Ls to failure.
   But Riegle said the taxpayer cost was ``a substantial amount of
money.'' He said he was concerned federal programs such as fighting
drugs and helping education not be hurt as a result.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, praised Bush and said he supported the
solution, even though any answer to a $50 billion problem wasn't
something you'd want to embrace and ``kiss on the mouth.''
   ``I think you're going to see some real bipartisanship here,'' he
said. ``I think we have a reasonable proposal before us.''
   Rep. Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he had some questions on
specifics, such as including credit unions in the premium increases,
but believed ``the major portion of it will fly.''
   Rep. John J. LaFalce, D-N.Y., a member of the banking committee,
said he had some concerns but overall the plan was praiseworthy.
   ``There is no solution without cost and without pain,'' he said.
``This plan tries to ensure that both are fairly shared.''

<HEAD>Talley to Sell Air Bag Business to TRW</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Talley Industries Inc. announced Monday it has
agreed to sell TRW Inc. its air-bag business for $85 million and a
share of royalties on technology over the next 12 years.
   The transaction could be worth $125 million, Talley Chairman
William H. Mallender said.
   Talley has developed the air-bag modules in nearby Mesa, Ariz. It
has reserved the right to cancel the royalty entitlement any time
after the first two years in exchange for about $38 million in cash,
before adjustments, Mallender said.
   ``If TRW is as successful as we believe it will be, this
transaction should allow Talley to receive the same or greater
return as it would if we had kept the air-bag company, without any
attendant risk or additional capital investment,'' he said.
   In August 1987, Talley and TRW, headquartered in Cleveland,
signed a long-term contract for Talley to supply TRW 100 percent of
its requirements for driver-side, air-bag modules for some
automobile models.
   TRW General Manager Charles L. Miller said the acquisition added
``an established and well respected ... product, excellent
technology, modern manufacturing facilities, a dedicated and
experienced work force, and a sound management team.''
   Talley got into air bags as an outgrowth of its research into
ejection systems for military aircraft. The company is a diversified
manufacturer of aerospace, electronic and industrial products.

   Employees of two companies battling hostile
takeover bids from out-of-state pursuers have banded together and on
Monday appealed to Gov. Michael S. Dukakis for help, but he told
them his options are restricted.
   The governor said an important reason he could not make a
stronger commitment to Prime Computer Inc. and Polaroid Corp., two
important Massachusetts employers, was that both companies are
incorporated in Delaware, though they have their headquarters in
Massachusetts. Nevertheless, he said, they deserve Massachusetts'
protection.
   ``What a state can do is limited legally,'' Dukakis told 2,500
employees of Prime at its headquarters.
   Both Polaroid and Prime face hostile corporate takeovers launched
by smaller firms seeking to borrow hundreds of millions to finance
the transactions.
   Last week a group called PACT, People Against Corporate
Takeovers, was formed by employees of Prime and Polaroid. Members of
the group said Monday they are trying to expand to other companies
that are facing takeover battles.
   Dukakis drew thunderous applause from the crowd in what sounded
like one of his presidential campaign speeches.
   ``I'm a free enterpriser, I'm an entrepreneur,'' Dukakis said.
``But there also have to be some reasonable rules of the game.''
   ``How can you spend your time thinking about what you're going to
do for your company when you're not even sure whether the company is
going to exist in a couple of years?'' Dukakis said.
   The governor said he plans to go to Washington Wednesday and will
lobby for federal legislation that would change tax laws that
encourage debt-financed takeovers, sometimes called leveraged
buyouts.
   ``As the phenomenon of hostile, highly leveraged corporate
takeovers continues, subsidized by the federal tax laws, our
international competitors must be laughing all the way to the
bank,'' Dukakis said.
   As Dukakis spoke in the packed atrium of Prime's suburban
headquarters, with hundreds of other employees watching on
closed-circuit television, Polaroid officials were in U.S. District
Court in Boston seeking to block the takeover of their company.
   Attorneys for the instant photography giant sought an injunction
against Shamrock Holdings Inc. arguing that the pursuer has been
making false statements about Polaroid's current ecponomic strength.
   Prime, meanwhile, is a week away from yet another deadline set by
MAI Basic Four Inc. for its $970 million, $20-per-share takeover
offer to buy Prime, a much larger company. Prime is scheduled to be
in federal court in Boston Tuesday to argue its case that MAI is
seeking to borrow too much _ $1.5 billion, according to Prime _ in
its buyout bid.
   Monday's meeting and speech came a day after a special
Massachusetts commission on corporate takeovers issued preliminary
recommendations on how the state can curb the practice. Two of the
recommendations involved increased lobbying efforts in Washington.
   Other proposals included forcing corporate takeover strategists
to provide laid-off employees with substantial benefits and pension
programs.
   William Benjamin, one of the Prime employees in the audience,
called it ``very encouraging,'' for Dukakis to visit, ``regardless
of whether there's any weight behind it.''
   Prime employs 5,000 people in Massachusetts. Polaroid employs
about 8,000, company spokesmen said.
   Daniel Jones, representing Prime employees, said a takeover by
MAI would hurt the company's ability to compete overseas. Prime is
the leading seller of computer aided design-computer aided
manufacture systems in Europe and second worldwide, according to
company spokesman Richard Eckel.
   Nick Pasquarosa, representing Polaroid employees, said the stakes
could not be higher since both companies are in danger of being
absorbed through takeovers and disappearing in their current form.

<HEAD>Pacific First Agrees To Buyout By Royal Trustco Of Canada</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pacific First Financial Corp., parent of the
largest thrift institution based in the Pacific Northwest, announced
Monday it has agreed to be acquired by Royal Trustco Ltd. of Toronto
for about $212 million.
   Under the deal, Royal Trustco will pay $27 cash for each share of
Pacific First common stock.
   Pacific First stock, which trades in the over-the-counter market,
zoomed $7.25 a share Monday, closing at $22.62 after reaching a peak
of $23.
   Pacific First, based in Tacoma, Wash., is the parent of Pacific
First Federal Savings Bank, Pacific First Bank, Pacific First
Mortgage Corp., Pacific First Securities Ltd. and Pacific First
Insurance. It has 105 offices in Washington, Oregon, California,
Texas, Nevada, Arizona and Colorado.
   Pacific First Financial earned $18.3 million, or $2.41 a share,
in 1988. It lists assets totaling $6.6 billion.
   The deal requires regulatory and shareholder approval, but the
company does not anticipate any trouble winning those, said Michael
K. Rogers, a Pacific First spokesman. The companies hope to
consummate the merger in six to nine months, he said.
   No approvals are required in Canada, Rogers said.
   Under the merger agreement, Pacific First would operate as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Royal Trustco, with no changes planned in
name or management, according to a Pacific First statement.
   Pacific First became the Northwest's largest thrift company in
December when it acquired two ailing thrifts in Vancouver, Wash.,
and Oregon with federal assistance.
   ``Over time, Royal Trustco plans to introduce further capital
into Pacific First to facilitate expansion,'' the statement said.
Royal Trustco has put no dollar limit or time schedule on
capitalization and expansion plans, but California is a likely
expansion target, Rogers said.
   Toronto-based Royal Trustco has assets of about 100 billion
Canadian dollars. Its subsidiary, Royal Trust Bank of Canada, has
assets of 30 billion Canadian.
   Royal Trustco has 128 branches in Canada and 22 offices in
Britain, Europe and Asia.
   ``This purchase is consistent with Royal Trust's stated objective
of developing a significant presence in the United States,'' said
Michael Cornelissen, president and chief executive officer of Royal
Trust.

<HEAD>Deaf Pager Unveiled by Metrocast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A device which lets hearing-impaired people
send brief messages to portable pagers was unveiled Monday by a
company that says the service will be available in 90 U.S. cities.
   The system uses a palm-sized electronic messaging receiver and
the so-called telecommunications device for the deaf (TTD), which is
a keyboard that connects with a regular telephone to allow
conversations to be typed to another TDD over phone lines.
   The receiver, which can hold 40 messages up to 52 characters in
length, vibrates to alert the pager wearer of the message, according
to Metrocast, a nationwide electronic messaging company that
developed the device with the assistance of Gallaudet University in
Washington.
   Metrocast said more than 100,000 TDDs are in use in the United
States, where there are more than 21 million hearing-impaired
people. Metrocast said its paging network is installed in 90 major
cities with a population in excess of 60 million.
   ``The TDD-Metrocast system offers unprecedented freedom to a
population previously restricted by its lack of access to suitable
communications tools,'' said Thomas D. Di Noto, president of San
Diego-based Metrocast.
   Lloyd Ballinger, manager of networks and communications at
Gallaudet, which is a school for the hearing-impaired, said the
device allows him to respond more quickly to problems in his job.
   ``I don't have to look for a phone and TDD or come back to the
office to check for messages,'' Ballinger said.
   The service, which was unveiled at the Communication Networks '89
exposition and trade show, will cost from $59 to $99 monthly,
depending on the frequency of use, Metrocast said.

   President Bush's quickness in dealing with the
savings and loan crisis, which is felt most acutely in Texas, met
with praise Monday from several of the state's troubled thrifts.
   ``We were pleased to hear that he (Bush) made a concerted effort
to study the problem, to come up with a proposal and announce it
today,'' said Russ Cobler, a spokesman for San Antonio Savings
Association, one of 350 thrifts the president's plan is designed to
help.
   Bush called for an increase in the insurance premium banks and
savings and loans pay on deposits and more money for the Department
of Justice to pursue fraud in the thrift industry. The plan does not
include a fee on depositors, but the increased cost of insurance for
deposits likely will be passed on to consumers in the form of lower
interest rates on savings accounts.
   ``We like the fact that it's not hitting the consumer directly,''
said Sam Hart, a spokesman for First Gibraltar Bank FSB, the giant
thrift recently formed through the consolidation of five Texas
savings and loans.
   Hart said First Gibraltar viewed Bush's plan as a move in a
``positive direction,'' but added the company's officers were still
looking it over.
   First Gibraltar was formed in one of the largest consolidations
of the Southwest Plan, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's program to
cleanse the thrift industry of its most troubled institutions
through a series of consolidations and recapitalizations.
   At the FHLBB's Dallas office, a focal point for administration of
much of the Southwest Plan, spokesman David Colgren said, ``I really
can't comment on the president's plan until we've had a chance to
look at it.''
   San Antonio Savings' Cobler praised Bush's assurance that
deposits in the nation's thrifts are safe.
   ``We are pleased that he, very strongly at the beginning and end
of the press conference, spoke of the full faith and credit of
government behind thrifts,'' Cobler said.
   Cobler said employees of his thrift in recent weeks have noted
``a lot of confusion by the consumer.''
   ``They don't necessarily know the full story about what's
happening to savings and loans,'' he said. ``They're concerned about
taxes, they see headlines about failed institutions _ what we hear
from our customer is that there's a lot of confusion out there.''

   Consumers aren't likely to see cuts in the
interest they earn on their savings if President Bush's plan to bail
out the savings and loan industry is enacted, top executives of
several California thrifts said Monday.
   That's because the thrift industry faces too much competition _
from within, and from banks and securities brokers _ to risk scaring
away depositors by passing along a proposed increase in federal
deposit insurance premiums.
   ``When people say, `Are they going to pass this premium on to the
public?' I have to laugh,'' said Marion Sandler, president and chief
executive officer of World Savings &amp; Loan Association of Oakland.
``We're not a cost-plus industry. We're going to have to eat it.''
   Top officers at four other big California thrifts _ Great
Western, California Federal, Glendale Federal and Home Federal _
said they, too, were extremely unlikely to cut their interest rates
for fear of losing depositors to banks, mutual funds or the stock
market. All five thrifts are among the nation's 10 largest.
   Robert Adelizzi, president and chief executive officer of Home
Federal Savings &amp; Loan of San Diego, said it is inevitable that
higher insurance bills would be taken out of thrifts' profits,
rather that passed on in the form of lower interest rates and higher
fees to depositors.
   ``If we were a monopoly, yes, but we're not,'' Adelizzi said.
``We're competing with a broad variety of investment alternatives
and it's real hard for us to just raise our rates or lower our
rates.''
   The S&amp;L executives reserved judgment on parts of Bush's proposal,
but were generally supportive of the plan, which would split the
burden of bailing out failing thrifts among taxpayers and the
industry itself.
   The president's plan would finance thrift bailouts with a
combination of government bond sales _ with tax money financing the
interest _ and increased premiums paid by both S&amp;Ls and banks for
their federal insurance.
   The fact that both banks and S&amp;Ls would pay higher insurance
premiums inevitably would force down interest rates paid to
consumers, said J.J. Pinola, chairman and chief executive officer of
First Interstate Bancorp, one of California's biggest banks. He
called the decision unfair.
   ``I'm somewhat appalled and looking for the right word to
describe why someone in another industry that had nothing to do with
the mistakes of the first industry now is being asked to pay,''
Pinola said. ``It's simply a bashing of the banks.''
   In general, thrift executives praised the new president for
quickly tackling a problem that many have seen as a crisis for four
years.
   ``I like what is see,'' said James Montgomery, chairman and chief
executive officer of Beverly Hills-based Great Western Financial
Corp. ``I think he's showing some leadership, saying, `We've got to
get on with this problem,' and spreading the pain around a little
bit.''
   Montgomery and other thrift executives were particularly
supportive of proposals to increase capital requirements _ the
amount of a thrift's own money that must be used to back deposits _
and to crack down on fraud and mismanagement.
   That is because many at strong thrifts believe they unfairly have
received a black eye through association with the estimated
one-third of the industry that's on shaky ground.

   Waste Management International Inc. said
Monday it had agreed to buy 49.9 percent of PEC Engineering, a
French company that treats chemical waste.
   Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
   Fred Weinert, president of Waste Management International, said
the purchase is part of the company's expansion into European
markets. The company is a subsidiary of Waste Management Inc. of Oak
Brook, the largest U.S. waste treatment and disposal company.
   ``The acquisition will complement our other chemical waste
treatment activities in the Netherlands, and will provide our
European customers with a full range of chemical waste and treatment
options,'' Weinert said.
   The company has joined with Chantiers Modernes, a French
construction company, to form Financiere PEC, which will buy 100
percent of PEC Engineering. The agreement must be approved by the
French government.
   PEC, based in Lyon, France, is one of the largest European
chemical waste treatment companies, with five treatment and disposal
facilities in central and eastern France.
   The acquisition of PEC marks Waste Management International's
first foray into the French market. The company has operations in
Italy, Holland, South America, the Middle East and Australia.

   Frederick J. Close, former chairman of
the Aluminum Co. of America, died Monday of complications after a
fall in his home. He was 83.
   Close, a Pittsburgh native, died in a hospital here. He retired
as Alcoa chairman in 1970.
   Close led the development of easy-open tops for cans and of the
all-aluminum beverage can, which now is the major use of aluminum in
the world.
   Close joined the company in 1929 after graduating from Penn State
University, and worked as a sales apprentice in New York City.
During World War II, he directed the production of aluminum aircraft
parts at Alcoa's Cleveland plant.
   He was transferred to Pittsburgh in 1945 as manager of
architectural sales. Close was named a vice president in 1958,
executive vice president in 1963 and chairman in 1965.
   He was a key figure in the conception and construction of the
31-story Alcoa Building in Pittsburgh, the company's headquarters
and the world's first aluminum high-rise building.
   Close also served on the Allegheny County Port Authority board.
   Close is survived by a son, Frederick J. Close III of London.

   The U.S. dollar marginally rose against the Japanese
yen early Tuesdsay, while share prices closed the morning session at
a new high on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar, which opened at 129.37 yen, down from Monday's
129.70-yen close, was quoted at 129.48 yen by late morning. The
currency moved in a range of 129.30-129.48 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which rose
142.97 points to a record 31,828.75 points Monday, gained an
additional 80.47 points, or 0.25 percent, to finish the morning
session at 31,909.22 points, another high.
   ``Investors' buying interest is very strong, especially
individual investors,'' said Seichiro Kita of Daiwa Securities.
   The market has finally found a direction for trading, and
participants targeted their interest in construction issues, he said.
   In currency dealings, the dollar's slip at the opening of Tokyo
trading followed its slide in New York, dealers said. After
coordinated dollar-selling intervention by central banks in New York
and Europe, the currency closed lower at 129.41 yen in New York.
   A dealer with the Mitsubishi Bank said there was ``little
movement'' on the exchange rate in early trading in Tokyo because of
the absence of major market-affecting news.
   Other dealers said market players stepped off to the sidelines
amid uncertainties over the Group of Seven industrial countries'
coordination policy.

   A management group has offered $230.4 million
to buy Formica Inc., the target of a brief takeover attempt last
fall.
   A group including Formica President Vincent P. Langone and the
investment banking firms of Dillon, Read &amp; Co. and Wertheim Schroder
said Monday it would pay $18 a share in cash for the 12.8 million
shares outstanding.
   But Malcolm Glazer, a Rochester, N.Y., businessman whose offer of
$20 a share in cash and securities was rebuffed last fall, said he
was considering a new bid.
   Formica's U.S. operations are based in Cincinnati. A leading
maker of high pressure decorative laminates, the company employs
about 800 people at its suburban Reading, Ohio, facilities.
   Formica, headquartered in Wayne, N.J., said Monday that its
directors approved a definitive merger with the management-led
group. But they also told financial advisers Shearson Lehman Hutton
to see if others might be interested in bidding.
   Glazer said he was incensed at management's buyout attempt.
   ``I'm shocked that they'd offer $18 when we were willing to pay
$20 a share. I don't think they're acting in the best interests of
shareholders,'' he said.
   He estimated the company is worth ``in the high twenties'' a
share.
   Glazer, who owns television stations, nursing homes and real
estate, dropped his bid in November after Langone said the company
wasn't for sale.
   Under the merger agreement, the management group will launch a
tender offer for all Formica's shares, beginning Friday.
   After Monday's news, Formica opened above $20 a share on the New
York Stock Exchange. It closed at $21.50, up $4.75 as more than 1.75
million shares changed hands.
   Glazer, who sold his 1.09 million-share stake in Formica last
November to Chicago-based Great American Realty Inc., said he owns
no Formica shares.

<HEAD>Settlement Rate Could Lead To Payment Delays From Asbestos Trust</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The trust fund set up by Manville Corp. to
compensate asbestos victims could run out of money by later this
year, causing delays in payments to thousands of claimants,
according to trust officials and attorneys.
   The fund is running out of money because settlement payments have
averaged about 50 percent higher, and settlements have been reached
at a quicker rate, than expected when the fund was established,
according to court documents and officials quoted in Tuesday's
editions of the New York Times.
   ``It's not as bleak a situation as it appears,'' said David T.
Austern, the trust's general counsel. ``But if we run out of money,
it means that we will be temporarily unable to make payments.''
   Manville sought Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection from
creditors in 1982 due to thousands of claims from people who
suffered illnesses because of contact with asbestos.
   The trust, which assumes all legal liability for personal injury
lawsuits stemming from Manville's asbestos products, was created
last year when the company emerged from Chapter 11.
   Trust officials have indicated they had received 40,000 notices
of claims and estimate that 120,000 to 200,000 claims ultimately
could be filed against the trust, the newspaper stated.
   Court documents and people involved in Manville's legal
proceedings indicated that the trust in recent months had agreed to
settle almost 14,000 claims averaging $38,000 each. Creators of the
trust had estimated claims would average $25,000.
   In a report recently filed in U.S. bankruptcy court in Manhattan,
Manville trustees stated they expected that in the third or fourth
quarter of this year, ``the trust will recurringly find itself
temporarily unable to pay claimants.''
   Trust officials told the Times they could not predict how long
payments might be delayed.
   The trust is to be replenished periodically over 27 years by the
sale of stock, note payments and injections of Manville profits,
mostly after 1982.
   The fund currently has $685 million in assets and more than $665
million in liabilities, according to Al Kamhi, the trust's director
of communications. The trust's total value was expected to exceed
$2.5 billion over its life.
   Separately, Denver-based Manville reported Monday that it lost
$1.31 billion in the fourth quarter because of a $1.3 billion charge
for costs of its Chapter 11 reorganization.
   The loss compared with a $59.98 million loss in fourth quarter
1987.
   Manville reported fourth-quarter sales of $522.1 million, up from
$486 million a year earlier.
   For the full year, Manville lost nearly $1.3 billion, compared to
earnings of $72.6 million, or 61 cents per share, in 1987. Full-year
sales totaled $2.06 billion, up from $1.94 billion.
