<HEAD>Study: Better Work Conditions Could Ease Nurse Shortage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High turnover among nurses is leaving hospitals
short-handed, but better working conditions and higher pay should
ease a national nursing shortage, researchers said Tuesday.
   ``Working conditions are more important than pay,'' said Steven
G. Vernon of the Wyatt Co., a consulting firm that conducted a
two-year national survey on nursing, called ``I Love My Work. I
Hate My Job.''
   Besides higher pay, nurses should have more influence on their
jobs, fewer menial or non-medical tasks, more chances for
advancement, and more scheduling flexibility where possible, the
study says.
   A separate Wyatt study issued in July showed that one in 10
hospital-nursing jobs is unfilled, and that one in five registered
nurses leave their hospital employ every year, Vernon said.
   ``There really is not a shortage of registered nurses in the
United States,'' said Claudia J. Wyatt, a consultant in Wyatt's
Chicago office.
   The shortage is of those willing to work in hospitals, she said.
   ``Keeping nurses in hospital-based nursing is the key
priority,'' Ms. Wyatt said.
   For the two-year study, Wyatt conducted interviews _ some
lasting several hours _ with more than 500 people, including
hospital administrators, nursing managers and more than 200 current
or former nurses, Ms. Wyatt said.
   The sample of people at 100 hospitals in 10 states was designed
to be nationally representative, including nurses with a range of
jobs from hospitals of all sizes, she said.
   Spokeswoman Pamela Towne of the Chicago-based Illinois Nurses
Association said the group's parent organization, the American
Nurses' Association in Kansas City, Mo., issued a set of similar
solutions to the nursing shortage a year ago.
   Improved salary and benefits, better working conditions, and
helping part-time nurses return to full employment were among the
suggestions, she said.
   According to the Wyatt study, the average staff salary for a
registered nurse in August was $26,000, ranging from a low of
$22,800 in the rural Southeast to a high of $30,400 in West Coast
suburbs.
   The average starting annual salary for a newly graduated
registered nurse was $22,300, ranging from a low of $20,400 in a
rural hospital in the north-central region to a high of $25,500 in
the West Coast suburbs.
   The report noted that no relationship was found between salaries
at facilities that perceive a nursing shortage and those that do
not.
   Ms. Towne also said that an increasing demand for nurses, rather
than nurses giving up hospital work, appeared to be creating the
shortage in Illinois, where 100,000 registered nurses work.
   She said nationwide, 2 million registered nurses are licensed,
and 1.6 million _ the most ever _ are working. Of those, 65 percent
to 68 percent work in hospitals, Ms. Towne said.
   Ms. Wyatt said giving nurses more say in defining their jobs,
and more options concerning shifts and part-time work can pay off
for hospitals.
   ``Nurses are true white-collar professionals who love being in
the front line of patient care,'' she said, ``but sometimes they
feel they get treated like blue-collar workers.''
   The survey was conducted at hospitals in Alabama, Florida,
Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Illinois, Ohio,
Texas and California.

   In his first trip abroad since leaving
office, former President Reagan will visit England next month to
give a lecture and visit the queen and Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, a spokeswoman said Tuesday.
   Reagan will deliver the Churchill lecture June 13 at London's
ancient Guildhall as the guest of the English Speaking Union, an
international volunteer organization devoted to promoting
friendship and educational programs.
   The lecture is named after former Prime Minister Winston
Churchill, who once was the group's chairman.
   Reagan will be accompanied by his wife, Nancy. In London, the
Reagans will have lunch with Queen Elizabeth II and her husband,
Prince Phillip, and dine with Thatcher at 10 Downing Street, said
Reagan spokeswoman Paula Franklin.
   It will be the Reagans' first trip abroad since returning to
California on Jan. 20, the day he retired from the presidency after
two terms in office.
   ``Nancy and I are looking forward to renewing our friendship
with Her Majesty the Queen and with Prime Minister Thatcher,''
Reagan said in a statement released by his office.
   ``There has always been a very special relationship between the
United States and the United Kingdom, and I am deeply honored to
have been invited to deliver the Churchill lecture,'' Reagan said.
``We have many fond memories of our visits to London and are very
happy to have an opportunity to again be in the company of our
friends there soon.''

<DATELINE>BASCO, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The jail in this windswept provincial
capital is empty, except for a rusting bicycle stored in one cell
and potted plants in the other.
   ``There are crimes here, but only small crimes,'' said Sgt.
Clementi Cantor, chief of the two-man police force in Basco,
capital of Batanes, the forgotten province of the Philippines.
   This year, Sgt. Cantor has investigated three ``crimes'' _
domestic disputes and fights between neighbors. None was serious
enough for the courts.
   Only 23 crimes were reported in the entire province last year.
The most serious, a murder committed by a soldier, was the first
killing reported in 20 years.
   ``We've had judges come to hear cases and they say it's like a
vacation in the Bahamas,'' said Tess Castillejos, executive
secretary to the mayor.
   The low crime rate is one of many features that make Batanes,
the smallest, most northerly and least developed province, unique
in the violence-plagued Philippines.
   Its 15,000 people, known as Ivatans, live in quiet isolation.
They fish and raise crops and cattle on 10 small islands about 250
miles) north of Manila and only 140 miles south of Taiwan.
   Few outsiders venture to Batanes, whose lush green fields,
mist-shrouded hills and villages on rocky cliffs make it look more
like the Welsh coast than the tropics.
   Telephones? Forget it. The radio-telephone link was cut last
year when communist rebels blew up a relay station on Luzon, the
main Philippine island.
   Batanes is not perfect.
   It has the highest rate of alcohol consumption in the
Philippines. Per capita income is only 416 pesos ($19.80) a month,
so many of the brightest youngsters leave after high school in
search of opportunity.
   ``We need government investments in cattle, fishing, garlic and
root crops and to improve the seaport so our young people can find
jobs here,'' said the provincial governor, Telesforo Castillejos.
   ``Most provinces have an overpopulation, problem but our growth
has been almost nill because of emigration.''
   Typhoons and and other storms batter the islands frequently and
Ivatans live in square, fortress-like stone houses for protection
from them, but there are no communist rebels, no armed gangs and no
beggars.
   Internal combustion engines do not pollute the air in Basco, a
town of 6,000 people. All Batanes has only 120 motor vehicles and
two-thirds are motorcycles.
   If roosters crowing can be called noise pollution, it is the
most common form.
   Lt. Col. Jesus Poblete, provincial military commander, said ``I
don't feel very busy here.''
   His major challenge is the occasional Taiwanese fishing vessel
encroaching on Philippine waters. Otherwise, he said, ``All we do
is run, train and have meetings. I don't have much to do.''
   ``I think it's the perpetual serenity which we don't find in the
metropolitan areas that keeps people here,'' said Tess Castillejos,
an in-law of the governor and native of Batanes who returned with
her husband after several years in Manila.
   ``In Manila, I spent the whole day taking my children to and
from school and driving to stores. Here, I kiss them in the morning
and they come home in the afternoon. I can walk everywhere.''
   Because of frequent storms in the Balintang Channel, commercial
ships do not run regular services between Batanes and Luzon, 140
miles to the south.
   Most supplies come on LST landing craft, which the Philippine
navy uses extensively for inter-island traffic.
   They reach Batanes about every three months. One ran aground in
the harbor during a storm last year and its hulk is still there,
quietly rusting.
   Philippine Air Lines provides the main link with the world, a
daily flight often canceled because of bad weather.
   A siren heralds the plane's arrival and scores of townspeople
usually go to meet it, since the airport is within walking distance
of downtown Basco.
   There is no television and residents can pick up Philippine
state radio for only a few hours a day on a relay from Tuguegarao,
200 miles south.
   That hardly matters because only a few hundred homes in Basco
can receive the part-time electricity. When the juice comes on for
four hours each evening, residents flock to makeshift theaters
where local entrepreneurs show movies at 5 pesos (25 cents) a head.
   Those who have seen the available movies watch or participate in
pickup basketball games in the town square until the electricity
goes off.
   ``Fishing, swimming, biking, that's about all the recreation
here,'' said Aniano Bata, 45, a lifelong resident. ``It's good,
clean fun.''

   The nation's largest school system with nearly 1
million students has been beset by reports of drug abuse, theft and
sexual misconduct by teachers, principals and school board
officials.
   New Yorkers will have their first opportunity to render an
electoral verdict on the scandals in today's elections for new
community school board members, but few expected a large turnout.
   And no one even knows if the results of the election will stand
up. A federal judge last week struck down a new law prohibiting
school employees, political office holders and party officials from
sitting on the boards, but challenges were expected.
   ``All of this is making the voters feel somewhat powerless,''
said state Assemblyman Jose Serrano of the Bronx.
   The city's 32 school boards were set up two decades ago when the
city's school system was decentralized to help parents and
communities get a handle on their neighborhood schools.
   The local boards operate 800 elementary and intermediate
schools. Each board hires its schools' principals, assistant
principals and district administrators and is responsible for
educating about 20,000 children from kindergarten through grades 8
or 9.
   The school system also maintains a bureaucracy of employees who
work in the central Board of Education headquarters. The central
board operates the city's 115 senior high schools, negotiates
citywide contracts, maintains the system's 900 schools, sets
citywide policy and, in theory, oversees the community boards.
   But in the last few months, five school board officials in the
Bronx have been indicted on felony charges ranging from theft to
bribe taking. Outraged over alleged criminality and proved
mismanagement, schools Chancellor Richard R. Green has suspended
two Bronx school boards.
   There also have been reports that principals and other
administrators obtained their positions by paying bribes to school
board members.
   ``The notion that you become a principal not on the merits, but
on the basis of how much money you got in your pocket, to me, is
just mind boggling and it's outrageous. It just makes my blood
boil,'' said James F. Gill, a lawyer and former prosecutor heading
a city commission charged with investigating the allegations of
wrongdoing.
   At one school meeting in the Bronx, women publicly confronted a
school official with allegations he had offered to trade jobs for
sex. Recent newspaper articles have told of booze-and-drug parties
on school property, graft and corruption.
   The scandals broke last November when a principal at a Bronx
elementary school was arrested on drug charges. That was followed
by arrests of several teachers on similar charges.
   Criminal inquiries of some boards are under way in the boroughs
of Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens; only Staten Island
has escaped.
   Educators, analysts and teacher union officials agree that the
wrongdoing at the root of the scandals has had an affect on the
performance of many schools.
   ``When people are misusing funds, then it takes away resources
from the educational program. It directly affects what goes on in
the schools,'' said Thurston A. Atkins, a longtime observer of
decentralization and a professor at Columbia University's Teachers
College.
   A Bronx teacher who who asked not to be identified put it more
succinctly: ``It kills morale when you have to worry `Am I going to
have enough chalk, enough of this, enough of that.'''
   The school system's decentralization was a product of the
turbulent 1960s, a lengthy citywide teachers' strike and pressure
from militant civil-rights activists.
   The reform divided up the system to give local residents,
particularly parents, a greater voice in the operation of the
schools.
   But with a disturbingly low voter turnout of 5 percent not
uncommon in school elections, some boards are dominated not by
parents but by political hacks who allegedly dole out jobs to
supporters, friends, relatives and sometimes applicants willing to
put cash in the right pockets.
   Stanley S. Litlow, executive director of Interface, a research
organization concerned with education, has studied the schools for
a dozen years and blames voter apathy on the timing of the
elections _ which are not held on regular election days but in the
spring of every third year _ and the little media attention they
generally get.
   ``The confused structure'' of the school system also promotes
low turnout, he said.

   Children, like adults, may be keenly conscious
of their waistlines and many have tried dieting, a hospital survey
suggests.
   Nearly half of 318 elementary school children surveyed worried
they were overweight, and more than a third said they had attempted
diets, according to a study released Monday.
   ``This study tells us that it's not just the 15-, 20- or
40-year-olds who feel they're overweight _ 9- and 10-year-olds feel
the same way,'' said Dr. Michael J. Maloney, director of psychiatry
and psychology at Children's Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati.
   The study, ``A Survey of Dieting Behavior and Eating Attitudes
in Children,'' will be published in September's issue of
Pediatrics, a monthly professional journal.
   Researchers at the hospital surveyed girls and boys in the third
through sixth grades at two randomly hosen schools in middle-income
Cincinnati-area neighborhoods.
   Of those surveyed, the researchers said 45 percent indicated
they were uncomfortable with their bodies and wanted to be thinner.
Thirty-seven percent said they had already tried to lose weight,
Maloney said.
   ``Girls in grades five and six reported significantly more
discomfort about their bodies than girls in grades three and four
or boys in all grades,'' he said.
   A total of 6.9 percent gave responses similar to those obtained
in studies of teen-agers and young adult females who suffer from
anorexia nervosa, a condition characterized by severe and prolonged
inability or refusal to eat, he said.
   ``Previous research has determined that 70 percent of
17-year-old girls think they're overweight, but only 20 to 30
percent really are,'' he said.
   The researchers plan a six-year followup study in hopes of
learning more about the possible causes of eating disorders and
ways to treat them.
   Maloney planned to present his findings Thursday to the American
Society for Pediatric Research in Washington.

   Twenty tons of rocket fuel
burst into flame Monday in a munitions igloo, sending a cloud of
smoke and fumes 1,000 feet into the air, officials said. There were
no injuries.
   The blaze burned part of the domed storage area and scorched a
2,000-square-foot area of adjacent grass before being put out 1{
hours after it started, said Air Force Sgt. Louis Arana-Barradas
   Lt. Col. Bruce Rianda said there was no explosion, but said the
Minuteman I missile propellant burned rapidly at this base about 20
miles north of Salt Lake City.
   There was no damage estimate, but Arana-Barradas said the igloo
was ``built to withstand this kind of stuff.''
   The cloud of smoke and fumes which rose 1,000 feet above the
igloo drifted south over the base and dispersed into the
atmosphere, base officials said in a statement.
   Taking into account the possibility that someone might have come
into contact with remants of the cloud, base environmental
officials cautioned that the type of fire involved normally
produces large amounts of hydrogen chloride gas, which could
irritate the nose, throat and lungs, the statement said.
   An investigation into the fire was not expected to begin until
noon Tuesday, because of a mandatory waiting period to allow the
igloo to cool off before Air Force munitions crews can enter,
Arana-Barradas said.

<HEAD>Appeals Court: You Can Call All Disappearing Beds `Murphy'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Murphy's Law caught up with the Murphy bed when
a federal appeals court ruled that the name of the famous fold-down
bed is now so commonly used that it's no longer protected by
trademark laws.
   ``We hold that `Murphy bed' is a generic term, having been
appropriated by the public to designate generally a type of bed,''
the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Monday in overturning
part of a lower court ruling.
   The 2nd Circuit ruled that a federal judge on Long Island erred
in finding companies in Georgia and Florida _ both named Murphy Bed
Co. of America Inc. _ had infringed on the trademark rights of The
Murphy Door Bed Co., which was founded in 1925 by the inventor of
the disappearing bed.
   But like Murphy's Law, in which anything that can go wrong will,
the appeals court also had some bad news for the Murphy bed
imitators:
   ``We agree with the district court that defendants engaged in
unfair competition by passing off beds of their own manufacture as
beds of the Murphy Co.,'' which is based in Amittyville.
   The court also affirmed U.S. District Judge Jacob Mishler's
injunction, which bars the two companies from using the term
``Murphy bed.''
   At the turn of the century, William Lawrence Murphy invented a
bed that could be concealed in a wall closet when not in use. He
patented the idea in 1918.
   At least twice, Murphy successfully convinced imitators who
marketed their products as Murphy beds to use a different name.
   But the appeals court noted that in 1981 and in 1982, the
federal Patent and Trademark Office refused the Murphy Co.'s bid to
register ``Murphy bed'' as a trademark, and a trademark appeals
board found in 1984 that ``Murphy bed has for a long period of time
been used by a substantial segment of the public as a generic term
for a bed which folds into a wall or closet.''
   While affirming the $6,330 in damages awarded The Murphy Door
Bed Co. for breach of contract, the appeals court dismissed the
$801,161 awarded in compensatory damages and sent the case back to
Mishler for a recalculation based on the Florida and Georgia
companies' net profits.
   Court papers did not specify in which cities the companies are
based.

<TEXT>
   In its final days, this country's
election campaign is getting nasty even by Central America's
rough-and-tumble standards.
   Stumping opposition candidates for the presidency and other
national and local posts call government leaders treacherous slime,
thugs and thieves.
   The eight-party pro-government coalition counters with a
television ad featuring President Bush speaking with a bogus
voice-over in English with Spanish subtitles.
   The voice-over, picking up on a published report, has Bush
admitting he authorized $10 million to subsidize opposition
parties, although the U.S. administration has not commented on the
report.
   Washington contends forces loyal to Panama's de facto leader,
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, intend to rig Sunday's election.
   Billboards proclaiming the charms of opposition presidential
candidate Guillermo Endara have had large American flag decals
pasted on them with the slogan, ``For $10 million, he sold out his
country.''
   Much of the vilification has been undertaken in the name of two
dead men _ Gen. Omar Torrijos, the charismatic dictator who died in
a plane crash in 1981; and Arnulfo Arias Madrid, the grand old man
of the Panamanian opposition.
   Arias was thrown out of the presidency three times by coups and
died last year at age 87.
   Both men had large, almost fantaical cult-like personal
followings, something both Endara and pro-government candidate
Carlos Duque lack.
   Even some of Endara's posters carry pictures not of him, but of
Arias. Duque's ads rarely mention his name without invoking the
memory of Torrijos, the prime mover in getting the United States to
agree to turn the Panama Canal over to Panama at the end of the
century.
   This week's cocktail party joke goes like this:
   Torrijos and Arias meet in heaven. ``You look a little tired,''
observes Torrijos.
   ``You look a little worn yourself,' replies Arias.
   ``I know,'' says the general. ``Maybe we should stop campaigning
so hard.''

   Just over a year ago relations, both personal and diplomatic,
were smooth between the United States and Panama. After Noriega was
indicted on drug-running charges by two U.S. grand juries, they
went sour almost overnight.
   The United States tried to force out Noriega through economic
sanctions but failed, and the relationship has since been as tense
as any Washington has.
   American diplomats are prohibited from speaking to some of their
Panamanian counterparts, the United States is blamed for every
conceivable ill and volunteer ``dignity battalions'' are training
to fend off the Yankee invasion that has been predicted any day now
for the past year.
   Headlines in a government-run newspaper announced that ``in the
face of a threat of a Yankee invasion, the neighborhoods of the
rich will be the battlefields,'' and that ``Gringo spies, traitors,
and those who sell their country will be executed.''

   The U.S. Army's Southern Command, in charge of defending the
Panama Canal, has issued press passes to visiting reporters to help
them gain entry to military bases.
   A government advertisement in one newapaper Monday said anybody
caught carrying the pass would be arrested as an American spy.
   The approximately 12,000 American troops in Panama will go on
alert status Saturday because of predicted disturbances in the
capital. The alert calls for troops to try to avoid leaving base if
possible.
   American troops were once something of an industry here, but the
free-wheeling entertainment zones near their bases are quiet today.

   Despite the negative tone of the campaign, there is a refreshing
lightness to some of it.
   Latin jazz bands packed into pickups drive around displaying
flags and decals from any of the 11 parties fielding candidates.
   Campaign songs blare from trucks that stop in the middle of busy
intersections, play their message to a grid-locked audience, then
drive off.
   A mish mash of colorful campaign posters covers just about
everything that doesn't move and many things that do.
   In one of the city's wealthier neighborhoods, a man patiently
peeled 50 Christian Democrat posters off a wall around his house.
   Two hours later, the wall was covered again with posters from
another party. It was hopeless.

   His catch gave him quite a battle, but a
fisherman known as ``Salmon Bill'' landed the season's first salmon
on Maine's Penobscot River, earning him the right to offer his
prize to the president.
   Bill Ellison, 41, who lives in a tent near the river during the
May-mid-October season, caught the 25{-inch, 6-pound fish early
Monday.
   ``This fish took me out in the middle of the river three or four
times. She didn't want to come ashore no how, and it was nip and
tuck right up to the end. But she finally came in,'' said Ellison,
who was among about 100 anglers in the Penobscot near Bangor for
the opening of season.
   Within hours, the fish had been certified as a sea-run salmon
and up to standards for delivery to the White House, in keeping
with tradition.
   Maine Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Department officials were
making arrangements for a presentation later this month to
President Bush, who is a fishing enthusiast, said department
spokesman Paul Fournier.
   Ellison's offer continues a tradition that started in 1912 when
a sea-run salmon was presented to President William Howard Taft.
   Pollution of the Penobscot forced a halt to the practice during
the 1960s, but with cleanup efforts, extensive restocking, removal
of some dams and construction of fish ladders, the tradition was
revived after President Reagan was elected.

   The New York City-based show today was opening a four-day stint
at the Chicago Theater. The set will be modeled after the city's
downtown Loop district and feature a moving replica of an elevated
train in the background.
   ``The Midwest seemed a natural place for Dave,'' executive
producer Jack Rollins said Monday. ``It's almost like coming home.
... It's the center of the country _ what do they call it? The
heartland?''
   Rollins noted that Letterman is a native of neighboring Indiana.
   Producer Robert Morton acknowledged that the show has a strong
``New York feel,'' but said the host would adapt easily to the new
surroundings.
   Letterman ``very much represents the sensibility of the
Midwest,'' he said.
   Segments this week will feature a Midwestern or Chicago flavor,
such as wacky props that are ``deep-dish anything,'' Midwestern
pets performing stupid tricks and a visit to Wrigley Field that
``has something to do with the lights,'' Morton said.
   Guests include talk show host Oprah Winfrey and Chicago Bulls
star Michael Jordan. Some of the city's blues artists will perform
each night on the NBC-TV show.

<HEAD>Ownership of Captured Wolf Tracked to `Flash Gordon' Actor Sam Jones</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A wolf that ran wild in a residential area
and ate a pet rabbit belongs to actor Sam J. Jones, but the ``Flash
Gordon'' star won't be getting his pet back, authorities said.
   ``We believe he purchased it as a pup from a breeder so it was
raised in a sort of domestic environment. But still, you can't have
them,'' Lt. Marshall Vernon of the city's Department of Animal
Regulation said Monday.
   The 100-pound wolf, a full-grown female named Hurricane, was
captured April 14 near the Encino Reservoir in the San Fernando
Valley.
   Residents of the hillside neighborhood had complained that a
huge white dog had been roaming the area for about two months and
gobbled down a rabbit.
   Vernon said the predator is probably an endangered gray wolf.
Its nearest wild relatives are in Alaska or Minnesota.
   In addition to starring in the 1980 movie ``Flash Gordon,''
Jones appeared in ``10'' and in the television series ``Hardcastle
and McCormick,'' ``Hunter'' and ``Highwaymen.''
   His personal manager, Stan Kamens, said he had no knowledge of
the matter and would not comment.
   Keeping wolves within city limits without a permit is a
misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of up
to $500, said Lt. Fred Michael of the animal regulation department.
But he said there were no immediate plans to prosecute Jones.
   Hurricane apparently lived by hunting wild rabbits, ground
squirrels, opossums and quail in the uninhabited brush around the
reservoir, officials said.
   ``We want to give the wolf to some type of a sanctuary that can
handle that type of animal. We just don't want to send it
anywhere,'' Vernon said. ``She's not going back to the owner.''

   An Air Force F-15 on a
training mission crashed over a target range Monday in the Gulf of
Mexico, and a search was mounted for the pilot.
   The twin-engine fighter jet went down around 12:45 p.m. EDT
about 65 miles southeast of this base on the Florida Panhandle,
said Staff Sgt. Gail Floyd of the U.S. Air Defense Weapons Center.
   Officials planned to search the area with ships overnight. If
the pilot is not found by daylight Tuesday, search aircraft will be
dispatched, Floyd said.
   The pilot, who was alone and on a student training mission, was
not identified, but it was believed he was Sean Murphy, 24.
   His father, Bob Murphy of Warsaw, Ind., said the family was
notified Monday night that his son's plane had gone down.
   ``Maybe he's just sitting in his little rubber boat, just
waiting,'' Murphy told the Fort Wayne (Ind.) Journal-Gazette. ``It
could be two or three days because the gulf's a pretty big place to

<HEAD>FBI Investigating ASU Police Treatment Of Blacks After Brawl</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TEMPE, Arizona (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI is investigating allegations that
Arizona State University campus police bullied black students while
breaking up a brawl last month, officials said.
   University Police Chief Doug Bartosh said Friday that agent Dave
Small of the FBI's Phoenix bureau called him that week to tell him
his department would be investigated.
   Small said the FBI has begun an investigation into possible
civil rights violations, but would not say what the focus of the
probe was.
   ``We welcome the investigation,'' said Bartosh. ``I feel our
officers acted appropriately based on the information I have.''
   ASU police came under fire for their handling of the April 16
brawl on Fraternity Row in which an unruly group of white students
began yelling racial slurs at four black students who drove into
the conflict.
   While trying to break up the fight, police handcuffed Robert
Rucker and James Liddell, both 20-year-old members of the
university track team. Rucker and Liddell were put in patrol cars
and taken to campus police headquarters.
   Rucker said that when he and Liddell complained the handcuffs
were too tight, one officer said, ``Next time, I'll put them on so
tight they'll make you cry.''
   The allegations of rough treatment resulted in three days of
protests by minority students and a promise by ASU administrators
to take steps to reduce racism on campus.
   Small said the FBI investigation could take several months to
complete.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Andres Rodriguez, who ousted
Alfredo Stroessner and his 34-year dictatorship three months ago,
routed seven other candidates in presidential elections Monday,
unofficial returns showed.
   Opposition candidates denounced ``numerous and serious''
irregularities in the balloting, but by late Monday evening had not
withdrawn from the election or challenged the early results. One
opponent conceded.
   ``We promise our people we will carry Paraguay on a bright path
to its destiny of greatness and happiness,'' Rodriguez told
cheering party members at his home Monday night as he lifted a
glass of champagne in a toast.
   Official returns had not been disclosed nearly eight hours after
polls closed but unofficial tallies by Rodriguez' ruling Colorado
Party as well as by the Christian Democrats and the political
science group CEPES showed the general won by an overwhelming
majority.
   Domingo Laino of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party and the
presidents of three other opposition parties denounced ``serious
deficiencies'' in the balloting. They refused to concede, but did
not withdraw.
   According to the Colorados, Rodriguez received 576,312 votes of
772,785 cast for president, or 74.5 percent. The closest
challenger, Laino, garnered 158,851 votes or 19.94 percent.
   The votes represented nearly more than a third of the 2.2
million people on official voter registration lists. Non-Colorado
candidates have complained that the list was out of date and
bloated, and even the Central Electoral Board said the list might
contain 600,000 duplicate or non-existent names.
   The Colorado Party, one of eight parties that submitted slates
of candidates for Congress, said it garnered 552,542 votes for
Congress out of 743,150 votes cast, or 74.4 percent. It said
Laino's party received 148,202, or 19.9 percent.
   The Colorados would thus, by law, receive 24 of the 36 Senate
seats and 48 spots in the 72-seat Chamber of Deputies.
   Rodriguez, 65, an army general and longtime aide to Stroessner,
dissolved Congress after leading the Feb. 3 coup that ended nearly
35 years of Stroessner rule. He served as provisional president
since then. Stroessner also belonged to the party, which has been
in power since 1947.
   Turnout appeared high across this landlocked South American
nation of 4 million, despite cloudy skies, light rain and cool fall
weather.
   Diplomats and foreign observers said the balloting and vote
count were reasonably fair and Rodriguez clearly won.
   ``I think it was a very good attempt at something they have
never done before,'' said British Ambassador John Grant McDonald.
   Presidential candidate Carlos Ferreira Ibarra of the Liberal
Party acknowledged that Rodriguez won.
   Laino, a former exile, said earlier Monday that the voting
irregularities were ``numerous and serious. We do not have all the
information, but the irregularities exceeded our expectations.''
   Election observers and party officials said not every citizen
was able to vote in private; ballots of opposition parties were
stolen and so not available at election tables; indelible ink was
not always used to prevent multiple voting, and the government
added voters to the official list after the registration period
ended three weeks ago.
   Euclides Acevedo, president of the Revolutionary Febrerista
Party, said ballots for his party were stolen at several voting
stations by Colorado supporters ``who simply put them in their
pockets.''
   But Fernando Vera, the party's presidential nominee, said the
four opposition parties were not about to withdraw from the
election.
   ``Why the obsession about withdrawing?'' Vera asked a reporter.
``No one has to withdraw from the process. ... What must be done is
determine on the basis of results if the fraud ... was significant
in its entirety or not.''
   Government and Colorado Party officials denied irregularities
were widespread, organized by them or influenced the outcome.
   Paraguayans seemed to accept as unavoidable one more general in
the National Palace and the Colorados once more in control of
congress, given the suddenness of elections following a long
dictatorship.
   ``My party was founded in 1965. This is the first time we're
participating in elections,'' said Martin Caceres, 28, a Christian
Democrat.
   ``People are hopeful,'' he said, standing in a school courtyard.
``The period of Stroessner hasn't ended ... but this is a
beneficial transition _ peaceful, with people getting used to
democracy.''
   In Coronel Oviedo, a large rural town 80 miles east of the
capital city of Asuncion, peasants traveled along muddy roads to
voting stations by flatbed truck, horse, bicycle and tractor.
   ``The last time I voted was in Stroessner's second
re-election,'' in the late 1960s, said Dario Benitez, 60. ``Then I
quit because I didn't like him anymore.''
   Since becoming provisional president, Rodriguez has criticized
the former regime, permitted banned newspapers and political
parties to operate and mended fences with foreign governments and
the Roman Catholic Church. Prominent Stroessner aides and ministers
have been arrested.
   Stroessner, 76, lives in exile in Brazil.

   ABC News anchorman Peter Jennings questioned
U.S. defense spending while acting as preacher for a day at
groundbreaking ceremonies for an Episcopal diocesan center.
   ``My question for all of us is: How much are we willing to spend
against the other threats to our life?'' Jennings asked Sunday from
the pulpit of the Cathedral of the Incarnation.
   Jennings noted that Congress was considering a $300 billion
defense appropriation request, but said agencies responsible for
environmental protection, housing or schools received only a
fraction of that amount.
   ``We know God has given us the means to ease the pain, to ease
the suffering,'' Jennings said. ``But somehow we must find the
ingredients to do more, much more.''
   Before his sermon, Jennings joined Episcopal Bishop A. Theodore
Eastman, Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke, the cathedral's dean and two lay
officials. The six used a four-handled silver shovel to turn the
first spade of dirt for the new $4 million center for the Episcopal
Diocese of Maryland.

   Comedian Bob Hope helped open
Disney-MGM Studios' new $400 million theme park, capping a
star-studded weekend of parties and previews.
   ``It's the largest theme park run by actors, or cartoon
characters, unless you want to count Washington, D.C.,'' joked Hope.
   Hope joined Disney Chairman Michael Eisner in opening day
ceremonies Monday on an outdoor stage in front of a re-creation of
Grauman's Chinese Theater on Hollywood Boulevard. The 135-acre
complex combines filmmaking with backstage studio tours and
attractions like the Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular theater
show.
   ``The world you have entered was created by the Walt Disney
Company and is dedicated to Hollywood ... a world that never was
and always will be,'' Eisner told the crowd.
   The grand opening followed a weekend of festivities, including a
Saturday night gala in which 40 movie and television stars paraded
down the park's Hollywood Boulevard in vintage automobiles. Among
them were Bette Midler, Lauren Bacall, George Burns, Audrey
Hepburn, Betty White and Kevin Costner.

   American rockers Bon Jovi and
Motley Crue will join West German and Russian bands in Moscow this
summer in a benefit concert for drug abuse programs on both sides
of the Iron Curtain.
   West Germany's Scorpions and the Russian ensemble Gorky Park
will share the stge with the two U.S. hard-rock groups at Lenin
Stadium on Aug. 12-13 for the ``Moscow Music and Peace Summit,'' it
was announced Monday. Proceeds will go to drug- and alcohol-abuse
programs in the United States and in the Soviet Union.
   ``There is really a very big problem in the Soviet Union with
drugs and alcohol,'' Gorky Park's Sasha Minkov said at a news
conference. ``Maybe not so much with drugs, as in the United
States, but alcohol for sure.''
   ``This is something we really think is going to make a
difference. The youth is tomorrow's leader,'' said Jon Bon Jovi, an
admitted former drug user.
   The groups and other rock artists including Ozzy Osbourne and
Skid Row also will issue a related studio album in August. The
album will feature new renditions of songs by groups who have lost
a member to substance abuse, such as the Sex Pistols and The Who.
   Portions of the concert will be shown in the United States on
Showtime Event Television on a pay-per-view basis. The Westwood One
radio network will carry the Aug. 13 show live.

   Romanian-born gymnastics guru Bela Karolyi can
pack a U.S. passport on his next international coaching tour. He's
now a citizen.
   ``It's a great moment and I'll never forget it,'' said Karolyi,
46, who guided Mary Lou Retton and other young Americans to Olympic
fame after defecting eight years ago. ``Now, I am an American.''
   Karolyi, his 46-year-old wife and fellow coach, Marta, and
daughter, Andrea, 15, were among 1,201 people who became citizens
in a ceremony Monday.
   ``My students are the ones who are representing the whole
American young generation and, along with them, I would like to
step on that floor not just as a professional coach but as an
American citizen,'' he said.
   Karolyi, who coached Olympic gold medalist Nadia Comaneci of
Romania, defected in March 1981 while on a tour of 15 American
cities with the Romanian team. But the usual five-year citizenship
process stretched to eight after immigration officials twice lost
the Karolyis' paperwork.

   A state appeals court has upheld most of a
divorce judgment against comedian Joe Piscopo, frustrating his
effort to gain custody of his 10-year-old son.
   A three-judge panel Monday rejected Piscopo's argument that his
ex-wife should not have been allowed to move from New Jersey to
Florida with their only child.
   The judges also upheld the awarding of $500,000 in joint assets
to Nancy Piscopo Hayes and an additional award of $50,000, which
was half the value placed on Piscopo's celebrity status.
   The court also said it wasn't unreasonable to require the actor
and former ``Saturday Night Live'' regular to pay $40,000 a year in
child support to his ex-wife.
   Mrs. Hayes has remarried since the 1988 divorce decree.
   Attorney Francis Donahue said he would discuss with Piscopo
whether to appeal the case to the state Supreme Court.

   Fans sipped champagne and led cheers in
Greek as St. John's College won its only official intercollegiate
athletic event, defeating the U.S. Naval Academy at a day-long
croquet tournament.
   The 6{-hour match, played Sunday after rain postponed it for a
day, ended with the home team capturing the ``Annapolis Cup.''
   The music of Vivaldi and Beethoven filled the air and some
spectators alternated between watching the game and reading George
Orwell's ``Down and Out in Paris and London.''
   The croquet tournament is not so much an athletic event as a
chance for neighboring schools that normally have little contact to
have a little fun together.
   While the academy turns out naval officers drilled in tactics
and terminology, St. John's produces a small crop of literary
scholars versed in Shakespeare and Socrates.
   Members of the two teams planned to meet later this week at a
restaurant where the tournament trophy is kept. ``I see that as a
step forward in the Midshipmen-Johnnie relationship,'' said George
Turner of the St. John's team.

   Two lost little kittens may owe their lives

a couple of holes in the wall at Bay Windows, a window and
construction material store.
   Out came two blue-eyed kittens, one black, the other black and
white.
   Squitieri said the mother cat probably crawled into the attic of
his store to give birth, and the kittens apparently fell down

   Saving the kittens was worth the $100 damage to his shop, he

   While all 35 respondents knew Infante's occupation, only eight

   ``Obviously those were law-abiding citizens,'' said Erickson.
``I'm not concerned as long as the paymaster, my wife and my

   Having a football team with a 4-12 record last season is enough
to make any coach recognizable, Infante said.

fool is who did this to their football team,'' Infante said.

   After he leaves his 8 to 5 job as a mild-mannered government
financial analyst, Ekzarkhov ducks into a dressing room and emerges
as a theatrical version of Superman, playing dual roles as a
Brooklyn dockhand and a New York cop in Arena Stage's recreation of
``On the Town.''
   The hit 1944 musical created by the best in show business _
music by Leonard Bernstein, book and lyrics by Betty Comden and
Adolph Green, and choreography by Jerome Robbins _ is the story of
three sailors on 24-hour shore leave in New York City during World
War II.
   The Arena Stage production, which opens Thursday and will run
through June 4, will be the first major revival of ``On the Town''
since 1971, at New York's City Center, and the first ever presented
at a theater in the round. This production was underwritten by
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
   Arena Stage has no orchestra pit, so musical director William
Huckaby installed his 18 musicians under the stage and will conduct
while peeking up at the actors and dancers through a manhole in the
floor.
   Ekzarkhov shows off his booming bass voice in the opening
number, ``I Feel Like I'm Not Out of Bed Yet,'' as a workman at the
Brooklyn Navy Yard. At 6 feet 3 inches and 235 pounds, he's
physically right for the part.
   ``It's a wonderful piece,'' he says. ``The only bone I have to
pick with Bernstein is that he didn't write at least 10 more
pages.''
   Ekzarkhov, 42, is the son of Russian emigres who fled their
homeland after the 1917 revolution and met in Austria, where they
were married and Ekzarkhov was born. He was 5 when he and his
parents moved to the United States and settled in Erie, Pa., home
of a large Russian and Polish community.
   ``It was a comfortable place to grow up in,'' said Ekzarkhov. A
high school pal was Fred Biletnikoff, who later earned fame as a
star pass receiver for the Oakland Raiders.
   Ekzarkhov learned to sing in the local Russian Orthodox church
choir under the direction of his steelworker father. ``They really
like their basses to sing very low,'' he said.
   He met his wife, Dusia, the daughter of Soviet emigres, at a New
Year's Eve party in 1969 in Washington while he was on shore leave
from the Navy. They still prefer to speak Russian at home after
nearly 20 years of marriage.
   The couple and their two young children spent 2{ satisfying
years in the central Volga region of the Soviet Union, where
Ekzarkhov was office manager for an Occidental Petroleum chemical
plant, then returned to Washington and its Russian-speaking
community for good.
   ``It was an incredible experience,'' Ekzarkhov recalls. ``The
people there looked exactly like the people I grew up with in Erie.
In a way, we came home. Yet as Americans, we couldn't help noticing
that our point of reference was America.''
   With a family to support and a mortgage to pay, Ekzarkhov took a
job at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, where he
specializes in gas transmission rate cases.
   ``I'm not knocking my job,'' he says, ``but it's not what I want
on my tombstone.''
   Ekzarkhov discovered his true passion _ singing _ when he landed
a job in the chorus of a local amateur opera production of Verdi's
``Aida'' 10 years ago. Encouraged by friends, voice teachers and
auditioners, including Soviet-born conductor Mstislav Rostropovich,
he has sung with the Washington Opera, the Summer Opera Theater at
Catholic University, the Opera Orchestra of New York, Opera Bel
Canto and local oratorio societies.
   ``I'm right up against reality now,'' Ekzarkhov adds. ``I'm at
the point where I need an agent. You can't do anything in opera
without an agent. I guess I never followed through because it would
mean living out of a suitcase at very reduced pay.''
   He's clearly ready to take the plunge, though, whenever his
persistent round of recitals, choral work, stage appearances and
auditions finally pays off, either in opera or musical comedy.
   ``I've spent many lonely hours singing at the piano,'' says
Ekzarkhov. ``I keep saying to myself, `What am I doing here? Who am
I kidding?'
   ``But then there's the ecstasy of being on stage and performing
at this level. What's important is that the audience have this look
on their faces. If you can get the audience to get a little wet in
the eyes, you've gotten them. That's it!''

   Ten monkeys enjoyed a bit of freedom when a
zookeeper at a park near Tel Aviv tried to please a group of
squealing children by opening the animals' cage.
   One monkey hitched a ride by jumping on the head of a boy riding
a bike then bit a zoo attendant in the hand before being recaptured
at the Rishon Letzion Zoo, animal keeper Charlie Zeitun said on
Israel radio.
   Two hours passed Sunday before all the creatures were back in
the cage, Zeitun said.
   ``Open it, open it, we want to see the monkeys,'' a group of
children yelled at him, Zeitun said. ``So I opened the inner door
to the cage. I didn't notice that the outer door wasn't locked.''
   But the monkeys did, and made a quick dash for freedom.
   The last monkey captured was the largest. Sandak, Hebrew for
``godfather,'' spent two hours scampering through the park and
chasing after children, Israel radio said.
   A police official in Rishon Letzion confirmed the monkey escape
and said the animals were about 20 inches in length, but could not
identify the species.

<HEAD>Bush Next Year Could be Saying `Don't Read my Lips'</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush vowed ``read my lips: no new
taxes'' all through his presidential campaign but never indicated
for how long the message would be displayed there.
   Administration officials now are reluctantly conceding that Bush
may only stick to the pledge for a year, and that higher taxes may
be part of a fiscal 1991 budget agreement.
   One possibility actively being considered is a swap trading
White House support for some new taxes, most likely on gasoline,
for concessions from Congress in other areas, like a cut in the
capital gains tax rate, said the sources, speaking on the condition
of anonymity.
   Bush has long made chopping the capital gains tax rate a key
item, claiming it will eventually raise revenue for the Treasury.
But it has found scant support in the Democratic controlled
Congress, which questions the logic of trying to raise revenue by
cutting taxes.
   Despite Bush's rhetoric against new taxes, reiterated as
recently as Monday in a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
many economists say higher taxes seem all but inevitable to get the
federal deficit _ estimated at $163 billion this year _ under
control.
   In fact, to many analysts, it was only a matter of time before
the administration conceded that some forms of tax hikes were
needed.
   Administration officials still haven't done this publicly. But
privately they admit contingency planning is under way on new taxes
_ and on what tradeoffs the administration might be able to wrest
from Congress in exchange for White House support for them.
   Even the no-new-taxes budget compromise Bush recently reached
with Congress for fiscal year 1990 calls for $5.3 billion in
unspecified new revenues.
   Bush has claimed that slashing the capital gains tax from the
present 28 percent to 15 percent will produce the bulk of this,
$4.8 billion. But since Congress seems unlikely to go along with
this tax cut, some way must still be found this year to come up
with the $5.3 billion.
   And, a weakening economy could make the projected 1990 deficit
even larger than the $98.6 billion Bush projected in his budget
submission to Congress _ meaning even more ``new revenues'' will be
needed to meet deficit targets of the Gramm-Rudman law.
   That budget-balancing act requires a deficit of no more than
$100 billion in fiscal 1990 _ or automatic across-the-board cuts
are triggered.
   Budget Director Richard Darman will issue revised economic
assumptions on the economy on July 15.
   Some administration sources suggested that a
gas-tax-for-capital-gains-cut deal might even be considered as
early as then, if the new economic numbers prove to be gloomy.
   But generally, administration officials said the president's
clear intention was to honor his campaign vow through this year.
   After that, all bets are off.
   Bush on Monday showed no indication he was ready to make a deal,
however. In his speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, he said:
``I mean to live by what I've said: No new taxes.''
   Bush told the Chamber of Commerce, ``We don't have to raise
taxes. We have to release the energies of free enterprise.'' He
said his ``favorite source of new revenue'' was the capital gains
tax cut.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Monday, ``We
are talking to the tax-writing committees about it (the capital
gains tax cut). But we wouldn't want to speculate on how it might
come out at this time.''
   The notion of a deal trading support for higher gasoline taxes
for a cut in the capital gains tax was first raised the weekend
before last in a session between Bush and a group of economists at
the presidential retreat in Camp David, Md.
   Although Bush was generally noncommittal, he did not object to
discussing possible higher taxes, and the proposed swap was
endorsed by some of the economists present, according to the
sources.
   The federal gasoline tax is now 9.1 cents per gallon.
   There have been a variety of congressional proposals for raising
the gasoline tax for amounts ranging from a few cents up to 50
cents a gallon. However, a major obstacle to any such rise is the
opposition of Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas.

<HEAD>Canadian Photographer Found Dead In Thai Resort Hotel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joe Gaal, a Canadian photographer who
covered the war in Afghanistan as a stringer for The Associated
Press, was found dead at a Thai resort hotel, officials said today.
He was 29.
   Gaal's body was found about 1 p.m. Sunday at the bottom of the
swimming pool at the Ocean View Hotel in the Pattaya resort, 70
miles south of Bangkok, said the hotel's assistant manager, Viroj
Phunpiriyat.
   Viroj said Gaal had gone swimming in the pool alone at about 1
a.m. Sunday after having had some drinks. A large amount of
marijuana and other drugs were found in his room, Viroj said.
   Foul play was not suspected, Viroj said.
   The body was taken to a police forensic institute in Bangkok
where an autopsy was to be peformed, said Nipha Kietniyom,
assistant consular officer at the Canadian Embassy.
   Gaal, from Kelowna, British Columbia, was vacationing in
Thailand.
   Gaal was born in Fernie, British Columbia. Starting in 1978, he
was a staff photographer for the Kelowna Daily Courier. From 1983
to 1985 he was chief photographer for the Lethbridge Daily Herald
in Alberta.
   Gaal made his first trip to Afghanistan in 1984 and did a photo
series on the war. In 1985 and 1986, he worked for the
Toronto-based Fotopress News Service covering the Middle East and
Asia.
   He returned to Pakistan in 1986 and since made several trips
into Afghanistan with the Moslem guerrillas fighting the pro-Soviet
government.
   Since September 1987 he had worked as a news and photo stringer
for the AP based in Peshawar, Pakistan.
   ``He took some of the AP's most startling and dramatic photos of
the war in Afghanistan,'' said Bryan Wilder, the AP's chief of
bureau in Pakistan. ``He was a mellow, quiet fellow who seemed to
be fearless when in combat situations.''

<HEAD>Administration Delays Enforcing Health Insurance Test</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is delaying the
deadline for employers to begin using complex tests to prove that
their health insurance plans do not discriminate against lower-paid
workers.
   The testing requirement, enacted at the request of the Reagan
administration as part of the 1986 tax overhaul, imposes an
unreasonable compliance burden on business, Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady said.
   He chose a meeting of business executives at the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce on Monday to announce, ``We have ordered a delay until
Oct. 1 in the beginning date for ... testing plans for compliance
with (Internal Revenue Code) Section 89 regulations.''
   The audience, which has made repeal or modification of the law a
major goal, applauded loudly.
   Brady said the goal of the legislation _ to ensure that
tax-deductible fringe benefits are distributed equitably among
workers _ was a good one. ``A system that differentiates between
people in the matter of health benefits subsidized by the taxpayers
cannot be sustained,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, the cost of compliance is excessive, Brady said.
``The law needs to be changed and we stand ready to encourage,
support and work with Congress to revise and improve it.''
   More than half the members of the House and a large number of
senators are sponsoring bills to repeal the provision or change it
significantly. The House Ways and Means Committee, whose chairman
and most of its members are sponsoring one modification bill, was
holding hearings on the subject today.
   The law requires employers to conduct a lengthy series of
complex tests to demonstrate that employee benefits, especially
health insurance, are not weighted against workers making less than
$50,000 a year.
   Paperwork required by the law is so voluminous that some
employers are threatening to withdraw health insurance coverage for
all employees.
   The Section 89 rules went into effect on Jan. 1, but the IRS
freed employers from any significant compliance requirements until
July 1 and agreed that no employer would be penalized if a
good-faith effort to follow the rules was made the remainder of
1989.
   The federal government forgoes more than $30 billion a year in
taxes on the value of employer-financed health insurance. The
employer deducts the cost as a business expense and the employee
excludes the value from taxable income.
   Under the Section 89 law, highly compensated employees may be
subject to taxation on the excess coverage if their health plan is
more valuable than is offered to rank-and-file workers.
   Under the House substitute plan, employers that provide a health
plan would have to offer coverage costing workers $10 a week or
less ($25 or less for a family plan) to 90 percent of employees.
Higher-paid workers would be taxed on the value of coverage that
was better than that provided other employees.

<HEAD>Women's Rights Groups Hail Supreme Court Workplace Ruling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women's rights advocates are hailing a Supreme
Court ruling they say will lower a ``Catch 22'' barrier to
advancement in the workplace.
   Women often have had be assertive to win promotion, they say,
but at the same time not offend employers by sacrificing
femininity. They said Monday's ruling is an important step in
limiting the impact of such sexual stereotyping.
   The court said employers must bear the burden of proving they
did not discriminate illegally once there is evidence bias played a
part in personnel decisions.
   Sarah Burns of the National Organization for Women Legal Defense
Fund said the ruling is an important victory for women's rights.
   ``In these situations there is substantial doubt who is going to
win,'' she said. ``Now that we're going to see a shift in the
focus, it's sufficient for a plaintiff to win.''
   Ms. Burns said the decision will help overcome a dual standard
she labeled a Catch 22 that has held women back.
   ``It's been that you had to have the attributes of an assertive
manager but also all the attributes of a passive, feminine
non-assertive woman,'' she said.
   By a 6-3 vote, the justices ordered further lower court hearings
in a suit against the accounting firm Price Waterhouse by a former
employee, Ann Hopkins.
   Ms. Hopkins said she was denied partnership because of ``macho''
attitudes that, in effect, demanded she behave more like a lady.
   The firm said other factors _ such as her failure to get along
with others _ were decisive.
   Monday's decision may leave some questions unanswered because
only four justices agreed on the standards that should govern such
``mixed-motive'' discrimination cases. There were three separate
opinions by the six justices in the majority.
   ``This may not clarify things because of the split decision,''
said Douglas McDowell of the Equal Employment Advisory Council that
sided with Price Waterhouse.
   But Judith Winston of the Women's Legal Defense Fund said,
``Although this is not a complete victory, we consider it to be in
the win category. We are gratified that the court said that once a
woman proves gender was a factor, the burden shifts to the
employer.''
   Price Waterhouse, in a statement, said it expects to win against
Ms. Hopkins when the suit returns to federal trial court.
   ``We are confident that after the lower court reconsiders the
case, it will conclude ... Ms. Hopkins was denied partnership for
legitimate reasons,'' the company said.
   Ms. Hopkins is seeking back pay and possibly reinstatement to
the firm with promotion to partnership.
   The high court rejected a federal appeals court's requirement
that Price Waterhouse show clear and convincing evidence its
actions were unbiased. It is enough that the company show by a
preponderance of the evidence it did not practice illegal
discrimination, the court said.
   The clear and convincing standard usually means that to
successfully defend against a lawsuit, an employer must show
overwhelming evidence in its favor. By contrast, a preponderance
standard means an employer wins by showing more evidence than not
is on its side.
   The ruling is based on an interpretation of Title VII of the
1964 Civil Rights Act, banning discrimination based on race,
religion and national origin as well as gender.
   Ms. Hopkins, formerly a senior manager for Price Waterhouse
here, quit the firm after she was denied partnership and later
became a consultant to the World Bank.
   While she was under consideration for the promotion at the
accounting firm, critics and supporters said she sometimes was
overly aggressive, too harsh, impatient with her staff and very
demanding.
   She said one partner who supported her for promotion told her
she would stand a better chance of advancement if she would ``walk
more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear
make-up, have her hair styled and wear jewelry.''
   In other action, the court:
   _Agreed to consider blocking the partial merger of Detroit's two
daily newspapers. The court will hear a challenge to former
Attorney General Edwin Meese's decision allowing a joint operating
agreement of the newspapers.
   _Ruled unanimously that additional environmental-impact studies
are not required before building a ski resort in Washington state
and completing a dam in Oregon.
   _Agreed to use a case involving the Michigan Chamber of Commerce
to restudy what limits should be placed on campaign spending by
political groups that incorporate.
   _Agreed to hear, in an Ohio case, a Bush administration appeal
aimed at allowing the government to collect potentially hundreds of
millions of dollars in taxes from multinational corporations.
   _Ruled, 5-4 in a case from Iowa, that lawyers may not be forced
by federal law to represent poor people in non-criminal federal
cases.

<TEXT>
   Col. James N. Rowe went to his resting place
near a grove of flowering cherry trees at Arlington National
Cemetery 10 days after the former Green Beret and prisoner of war
was gunned down in his car in a Manila suburb.
   Rowe, whose military career included numerous decorations and an
escape from a Viet Cong prison, was buried Monday on an Arlington
hillside after private Protestant services attended by Secretary of
Defense Richard B. Cheney and Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   An estimated 450 mourners followed an Army caisson bearing the
flag-draped casket from the service at Ft. Myer Memorial Chapel to
the gravesite in the military burial ground. The fort and the
cemetery are across the Potomac River from Washington.
   On the slope below the burial site, an eight-man firing party
saluted the slain officer with three volleys from their rifles,
Sgt. 1st Class Woodrow English of Coldwater, Mich., sounded taps
and the Army Band played ``America the Beautiful.''
   Under a canopy where members of the family sat, Rowe's widow,
Mary, placed a rose on his casket.
   Then Maj. Gen. Donald C. Hilbert, commander of the Army's
Military District of Washington, presented Mrs. Rowe with the
American flag from his casket. He then presented a second flag to
Rowe's oldest child from a previous marriage, Debra, 16.
   Others attending the service included Rowe's first wife, Jane C.
Benson, and the younger child of that marriage, Christina, 6. Rowe
and his second wife had two children, Brian, 5, and Stephen, 2, who
were not brought to the service.
   A driving rain fell through much of the day, but had slackened
to occasional sprinkles by the time the brief final ceremonies were
held in the grove of flowering trees, past their peak of bloom.
   Rowe was killed on April 21 as he was driving to work at the
Joint U.S. Military Advisory Group Headquarters, which provides
training and logistical support to the Philippine military. His
assailants sped away.
   The communist New People's Army General Command claimed
responsibility for the assassination and threatened further attacks
if the United States continues to back President Corazon Aquino's
fight against a 20-year communist insurgency.
   Rowe was taken prisoner by the Viet Cong on Oct. 29, 1963, while
serving with the Army Special Forces, or Green Berets, in Vietnam.
He spent the next five years in a primitive jungle prison near the
Gulf of Siam, escaping on Dec. 26, 1968, by knocking his guard
unconscious and signaling a U.S. helicopter that was operating in
the area.
   He wrote about his ordeal in a book, ``Five Years to Freedom,''
published in 1971.
   After his release, he was chief of the Army's Survival, Evasion,
Resistance and Escape Training, which also included training in
anti-terrorism techniques, based at Ft. Bragg, N.C.
   During his military career, Rowe won the Combat Infantrymen's
Badge, the Silver Star, the Legion of Merit, two Bronze Stars, the
Meritorious Service medal and two Purple Hearts for wounds received
in action.
   His father, Lee Rowe of McAllen, Texas, died in 1973 and his
mother, Florence, in 1982.

<HEAD>Veteran Latin America Expert Slated for OAS Post</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the State Department's most experienced
Latin America hands is in line to become ambassador to the
Organization of American States as part of an administration effort
to revitalize that institution, according to U.S. officials.
   President Bush is expected to appoint Luigi Einaudi, 52, a
right-hand man to the last six assistant secretaries of state for
inter-American affairs, to the OAS post, succeeding former
Ambassador Richard McCormack. The officials who confirmed Einaudi's
prospective appointment asked not to be identified.
   One of a handful of intellectuals at the State Department,
Einaudi has a doctorate in political science from Harvard and is a
recipient of the highest award in the career public service.
   He was once called by former Secretary of State George P. Shultz
``the State Department's leading expert on U.S.-Latin American
relations.''
   Because of budgetary constraints partly brought on by U.S.
failure to meet its quota commitments, the OAS has been forced to
negotiate early retirement for about 300 of its estimated 1,000
employees over the past several weeks.
   The Bush administration has promised to seek full funding for
the OAS in 1990 and is showing support in other ways.
   As an example, Secretary of State James A. Baker III had a
private meeting recently with OAS Secretary General Joao Baena
Soares. Officials said they could not recall Shultz ever having had
such a meeting during his seven years as secretary of state.
   The administration also has been looking to the OAS to play an
active role in monitoring the political process under way in
Nicaragua that is scheduled to result in national elections next
February.
   A generation ago, the OAS was at the center of political debate
in the hemisphere. It imposed mandatory economic and diplomatic
sanctions against Cuba in 1964 for attempting to promote revolution
in Venezuela. It also was deeply involved in the diplomatic process
that followed the U.S. invasion of the Dominican Republic the
following year.
   However, the OAS has been at the periphery of events for much of
this decade, playing little or no role in such issues as the
Malvinas-Falklands War of 1982, the Grenada invasion of 1983 and
the conflicts in Central America.
   U.S. officials said Baker envisions a stronger role for the OAS
under Bush as part of a U.S. shift in emphasis toward multi-lateral
diplomacy.

   A group of Texas investors in a gas well that
yielded huge profits for House Speaker Jim Wright defend their
dealings as legitimate and say the report of the House ethics
committee's outside counsel is misleading.
   The investors, who have been subpoenaed to testify Wednesday
before the panel, issued a report on Monday through their
Washington lawyer, Stanley Brand, attacking committee counsel
Richard J. Phelan.
   Phelan's report shows a ``lack of basic understanding of the oil
industry and the actual facts of this venture,'' said the report,
which the group said it was issuing to ``set the record straight.''
   ``Rather than acting as an impartial investigator, Mr. Phelan
has displayed prosecutorial zeal without regard to innocent third
parties who may stand in his way,'' the report said.
   Wright and his defenders have taken to attacking Phelan as part
of their strategy to counter the 69 counts of rules violations
lodged by the ethics committee. Brand was hired to represent the
gas well investors at the suggestion of former Democratic Party
chief John White, a Wright ally.
   The group argued that a geological formation struck by the well
continues to be promising even though it so far has been unable to
produce commercial quantities of gas or oil, and two earlier wells
have been shut down.
   The report states that Phelan, in characterizing the lucrative
sale of Wright's share in the venture as a gift, has shown ``a
fundamental misunderstanding of the oil business,'' because the
share had a high value.
   The remaining partners in the venture plan to spend another $2
million to drill again because they estimate there remains some $88
million in recoverable oil and gas in their leased tract near the
Louisiana-Texas line, according to the report.
   Brand said the group, which includes San Antonio financier
Morris Jaffe and his son, M.D. (Doug) Jaffe, has not yet decided
whether to honor the ethics committee's subpoena calling for them
to testify on Wednesday and Thursday.
   Also subpoenaed are Dave Myers, who has a working interest in
the venture and supplied the drilling equipment, Jeff Prestridge, a
geologist who consulted on Sabine Lake for the group and Marlyn
Cherry, a bookkeeper for the Jaffes.
   The five had been subpoenaed for interviews last week, but
failed to show up when the ethics committee's two senior members,
chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., and ranking Republican John T.
Myers of Indiana, traveled to San Antonio to speak with them.
   The committee later reiterated its subpoenas and ordered the
five to appear on Wednesday and Thursday of this week.

<HEAD>Intrest Rates Highest in Three Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Over the next six months, U.S. savings bonds
will be earning the highest rate of return in three years, the
government says.
   The new rate, which took effect Monday, will be 7.81 percent, up
from the rate of 7.35 percent that had been in effect over the past
six months. The new rate is the highest return for savers since the
bonds earned 8.36 percent for the sx-month period ending in April
1986.
   Interest on savings bonds is adjusted twice a year on May 1 and
Nov. 1 to reflect open market rates. The rate is based on 85
percent of the yield on five-year Treasury securities, which have
averaged 9.19 percent over the past six months.
   Since the government switched to market rates for savings bonds
in November 1982, the rate of return has averaged 8.29 percent.
Investors who hold their bonds for at least five years earn the
average of the half-year rtes.
   Jerrold B. Speers, executive director of the savings bond
program, called the new rate ``terrific news for savers.''
   ``When looked at in combination of the other benefits of bonds _
including tax advantages, complete safety against loss, ease of
purchase _ it is clear that this new rate makes savings bonds an
unbeatable deal,'' Speers said.
   Investors are guaranteed a minimum interest rate, regardless of
what the market rates do. That minimum guaranteed rate is currently
6 percent. But for bonds purchased before Nov. 1, 1986, the minimum
is 7.5 percent.
   Since market rates for bonds were introduced, the rates have
ranged from a high of 10.94 percent for the six months beginning in
November 1984 to a low of 5.84 percent for the six months beginning
in May 1987.

<HEAD>Panel Focuses on Use of US-Banned Pesticides on Imported Fruit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee this week will be
examining whether Americans are getting imported produce sprayed
with U.S.-made pesticides that are outlawed for use here.
   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., who chairs the subcommittee on
environment, energy and natural resources, said he is concerned the
Environmental Protection Agency isn't adequately informing other
countries about the chemicals they're buying from American
companies to enhance crop production.
   ``Many of these countries do not have the resources or
information needed to ensure that pesticides are used safely,''
said Synar.
   He said they need help developing regulations and they need
information.
   ``They're not getting enough of either,'' he said.
   Synar noted that pesticide exports have increased and so have
foreign food imports.
   He said his subcommittee, which will hold a hearing on the issue
Wednesday, will review EPA's efforts to protect American consumers
from imported food contaminated by pesticides which are prohibited
from use domestically.
   Jay Vroom, spokesman for the National Agricultural Chemicals
Association, said some of the pesticides that are exported are
unregistered here because they are designed to combat insects that
exist only in the climate of the foreign country.
   But he said it is in the best interests of the industry to have
as much information available to buyers as possible.
   ``We support access to information, delivery of information and
delivery of educational packages that do some good, not just arrive
on a dock somewhere,'' said Vroom.
   He said his organization has conducted educational programs on
pesticide use for foreign buyers.
   Through the United Nations, efforts are under way to develop an
international system of pesticide information exchange and export
notification, said Synar.
   ``Adoption of a system of prior informed consent is an important
first step toward improving the information base for many
countries,'' he said. ``However, our current notification system
must be improved.''
   EPA attorney Bob Perlis said federal law requires that companies
planning to export unregistered pesticides obtain a signed
statement from the foreign buyer saying the buyer understands that
the pesticide is not allowed to be sold in the United States.
   ``A copy of that statement is then sent to a representative of
the foreign country's government,'' said Perlis.
   He said the registration of pesticides is canceled from time to
time by the EPA and, when that happens, countries that have
purchased the product are notified the reason for the cancellation.
   ``There is not a pesticide product produced in this country
which could not be exported (under the law),'' said Perlis.
   Over the past decade, global pesticide use has doubled, said
Synar.
   The United States is a major pesticide producer, supplying about
one-quarter of the world market, he said, adding that about 25
percent of the U.S. pesticide exports are unregistered.
   Garry Hamlin, spokesman for Dow Chemical Co., said his company
follows the law explicitly.
   He also said, ``We do not ship banned products or products that
are severely restricted to other countries _ which is not to say we
do not ship products that are not registered in the United States.''
   He said Dow is seeking registration on a number of products that
are not registered here.

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ``Morton Downey Jr.'' show and other
interview programs with a bent for the weird and rowdy have a place
in television because they put viewers in touch with issues,
defenders of so-called ``Trash TV'' say.
   And even if they're just plain bizarre, shows like ``Crime
Time'' that feature ex-felons singing, dancing or cooking also
deserve to be aired in a free society, a panel of producers,
journalists and advertisers said Monday during a lively discussion
of television from ```MASH' to Trash'' at the National Association
of Broadcasters convention.
   In a session that at times threatened to veer into a
``Downey''-brook, Morton Downey's producer, Bill Boggs, crossed
swords with outraged audience members who said Downey was lowering
TV standards.
   ``We're not yelling and hollering about transvestites and mud
wrestling,'' Boggs said. ``We're dealing with issues.
   ``We're raising our voice about things that are on the front
page of the L.A. Times, the New York Times and Washington Post.''
   He said the issues Downey treats, such as gun control, politics
and the Ku Klux Klan, would generate heated arguments in many homes.
   As for Downey's style, he said in a loud voice, ``What is wrong
with people raising their voice?''
   David Crook, a TV writer for the Los Angeles Times, said there
is a big difference between talk shows of the 1960s and Geraldo
Rivera's show on Monday, which visited Nevada's notorious Mustang
Ranch house of prostitution.
   Crook said Downey and Geraldo were providing ``an interesting
counter'' to traditional journalism and were getting ``people on
the street'' to discuss issues.
   Boggs agreed, saying, ``Our guy has broken the mold of the
polite host who's being neutral.''
   Moderator James Bohannon, who is the host of ``Crime Time'' and
its companion ``The Talk Show'' felon interview progam, suggested
that the trend was for television shows to be more sensational.
   Jennings Bryant of the University of Alabama said he was
concerned about the social effects on children who may watch shows
that feed on polarizing their audiences.
   And NBC censor Alan Gerson said he could foresee an advertiser
backlash developing.
   ``If the environment for the commercial messages isn't
acceptable, that could be a problem,'' he said. ``If all commercial
advertisers decide that the program isn't commercially viable, then
the program won't be commercially viable. There are a number of
checks and balances.''
   But in an era of cable TV there are a lot of different voices
and different program standards. What is not suitable for NBC may
be acceptable on other outlets, he said.
   Robert Bolte, an executive with the Clorox Co., said Clorox
doesn't advertise on such shows because they don't provide the
proper ``environment'' for Clorox products.
   ``Not even toilet bowl cleaner, or something of that nature?''
Bohannon deadpanned to huge laughter in the room.

<HEAD>Bush Spends Just Two-Thirds of Money Earmarked For Transition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA M. HAMM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, who received $3.5 million to
make the transition from candidate to president between his
election and inauguration days, has returned more than a third of
the money to the Treasury.
   Bush spent $2.21 million to facilitate his entry into the
nation's highest office and returned $1.29 million to the
taxpayers, according to the final balance sheet released Monday.
   Under a new federal law, Bush had been allocated $1.5 million
more than former President Ronald Reagan to make the transition
into office, according to Raymond A. Fontaine, comptroller of the
General Services Administration, which administers transition
accounts. But the increase also tightened regulations for reporting
private sector donations.
   Bush raised no private money, said Fontaine, who has headed the
financial aspects of the transition process since Lyndon B. Johnson
left the White House in 1969.
   ``This was squeaky clean. No outside money, no outside gifts,''
Fontaine said. ``The Bush people refused to take free IBM
typewriters or free General Motors rental cars. The Reagan people
took lots of freebies.''
   The president spent his transition funds primarily on salaries
of the people who assisted in his smooth passage to a new
administration, said Fontaine.
   Bush employed 225 people, compared with the 400 government
employees Reagan used for the same purpose in 1981. Reagan spent
more than $1.7 million for transition, according to Fontaine.
   ``This was a much slimmer transition than Reagan had,'' said
Fontaine. ``Smaller people, smaller money. They seem to be a little
obsessed with this whole ethics thing.''
   The transition allocation for outgoing presidents to spend over
the six months after leaving office was increased from $1 to $1.5
million under the new law, Fontaine said. Reagan's activities have
included setting up the Reagan presidential library.

   A man peering through the window of the
cafe Nowy Swiat thought only specially invited people were allowed
to share their thoughts with the government ministers inside.
   No, no, he was assured by another onlooker, anyone could go in.
   ``Well then, I'd like to give them a piece of my mind,' he said,
pulling open the cafe door.
   In May Day celebrations Monday meant to stress the new wave of
reform in Poland, the communist government replaced the traditional
parade with a rally.
   And it organized ``kawiarnias,'' meetings at Warsaw cafes at
which ordinary citizens could exchange views with ranking officials.
   The sessions were held in several of the coffee-and-cake shops
along New World Street, a restored stretch lined by historic
buildings.
   The street was closed to cars and dotted with ice cream vendors
and concert stands for the day.
   The government ministers, who stood in front of bars and cabaret
stages in the smoke-filled cafes, talked about politics, economics
and other issues with standing-room-only crowds that sat at tables
and packed every corner of the columned rooms.
   Among them was Deputy Prime Minister Ireniusz Sekula, former
government spokesman Jerzy Urban, sports minister Aleksander
Kwasniewski and Alfred Miodowicz, leader of the official union
alliance OPZZ.
   But as Politburo member Stanislaw Ciosek took questions and even
fended off hecklers at the cafe Nowy Swiat, the new spirit of
democracy was being tested on the street as riot police clashed
with young protesters.
   Ciosek's give and take _ ``We are entering a completely new
state of things,'' he told one questioner _ was interrupted by
shouts from outside.
   The crowd rushed out to see a row of shield-carrying, helmeted
riot police who had closed the street after a clash with
demonstrators during which rocks and smoke bombs were thrown.
   The protesters, young militants who had wandered over from the
day's huge Solidarity march, fled after being charged by police.

   House Budget Committee negotiators have agreed
to spend at least $200 million next year to begin building the
superconducting super collider at a site south of Dallas.
   ``The committee recognizes that the SSC represents an
extraordinary opportunity to maintain U.S. leadership in science
and technology,'' according to the panel's budget document.
   The agreement, sought by committee members John Bryant of
Dallas, Marvin Leath of Waco and Dick Armey of Copper Canyon,
authorizes at least $200 million to be spent on the particle
accelerator in fiscal 1990.
   The Energy Department wants to build the 53-mile underground
ring at a site south of Dallas, and President Bush is asking
Congress to spend $250 million to begin construction in fiscal 1990.
   Although the chairman of the Budget Committee, Rep. Leon
Panetta, D-Calif., and its ranking Republican member, Rep. Bill
Frenzel of Minnesota, have agreed to the SSC budget language, the
question of funding the giant atom-smasher must still clear the

<NOTE>FDA Panel Recommends Approval of AIDS Drug</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Food and Drug Administration advisory
committee has recommended approval of an aerosol version of a drug
that helps prevent a life-threatening pneumonia in AIDS patients.
   The FDA is expected to agree and approve an aerosol version of
pentamidine within weeks, said an FDA source who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
   Aerosol pentamidine has been widely available to AIDS patients
since the FDA in February allowed expanded distribution as an
experimental medication under government review.
   However, many insurance plans do not cover experimental drugs.
FDA approval would allow nearly universal reimbursement for AIDS
patients using the drug.
   The advisory committee recommended approval of the drug for
preventing bouts of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, which causes an
estimated 60 percent of AIDS deaths.
   Pentamidine was approved five years ago for use as an injectable
drug to treat those already suffering from pneumocycstis. The spray
version would make it easier to take into the lungs where the
pneumonia infection first shows up.

<NOTE>Veterans Group Appeals to Other Countries for Asylum Pledge</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An activist veterans group, which says there
still are U.S. war prisoners in Indochina, is seeking a country
that will offer asylum to anyone who brings out a living POW.
   Ted Sampley, head of the National Steering Committee for
American War Veterans, said Monday the organization believes it can
get an American out within six months after asylum is guaranteed.
   The group has written officials of the Australian, British,
Canadian, New Zealand, French and Swedish embassies asking that
they offer a guarantee since the United States has not.
   U.S. officials have criticized independent efforts to find POWs
in Southeast Asia, saying they jeopardize official efforts to
resolve the POW-MIA issue.
   Two members of Sampley's organization were held prisoner for 41
days in Laos last year after they entered the country to publicize
a reward of more than $2 million offered by several members of
Congress for the safe return of a prisoner of war.
   While U.S. officials say they have seen no proof that missing
soldiers remain alive in Vietnam, Laos or Cambodia, they do not
rule out the possibility. About 2,400 U.S. servicemen are listed as
missing in action in Southeast Asia.

<TEXT>
   The dessert and hot topic was cheesecake.
``Nightingales'' star Suzanne Pleshette ate it as real-life nurses
told her how not to portray them as the confection.
   Miss Pleshette also apologized for the NBC-TV series' portrayal
of nurses as doctor-chasing airheads, and asked for their help:
Save Our Show.
   ``You're looking at a hit show that's about to be canceled as a
result of the controversy,'' the actress said. ``Unfortunately, now
the nurses are in a position to undo what they've done. They have
to save us.
   ``Unless every nurse who wrote a letter before can fax a letter
to NBC in the next two days, we may be over and out,'' said Miss
Pleshette, who portrays the ``den mother'' to a group of sex-kitten
nurses.
   Miss Pleshette and co-producer Douglas Cramer met with nurses at
Union Hospital on Monday to discuss how the program could portray
nurses more realistically.
   ``We want the show kept on the air and to reflect nursing and
health care as it could be,'' said Patricia Lynch, nursing
administrator at the 201-bed hospital in this town 30 miles west of
New York City.
   The program, which premiered in January and is broadcast on
Wednesday nights, has been criticized for demeaning the nursing
profession in particular and women generally by portraying five
student nurses as lusty bimbos. The program often shows them in
racy lingerie, bouncy aerobic workouts and locker-room disrobing
sessions.
   The 189,000-member American Nurses Association organized a
massive letter-writing protest, and sponsors including Chrysler
Corp. and Sears, Roebuck and Co. have withdrawn advertisements from
the show.
   NBC is expected to decide whether to renew the show within two
weeks.
   Last week, executive producer Aaron Spelling said the series
would show less skin and more nurses working in uniform if NBC
brings it back next season. He also said he would hire a nursing
adviser to help the show depict more realistic situations.
   Barbara Wright, executive director of the New Jersey State
Nurses Association, which has joined in the protest against the
show, said the group has been encouraged by the response to their
complaints.
   ``We would certainly want to consider any ways that things could
be modified and create a positive image,'' she said in a telephone
interview.
   Ms. Lynch said she invited Miss Pleshette and Cramer to Union
Hospital because she believed the staff could provide constructive
criticism. They talked over a private lunch of shrimp cocktail,
followed by cheesecake.
   ``We consider a show in its first season a work in progress,''
Miss Pleshette said at a news conference.
   ``We do not deny and we never deny that we made some mistakes.''
   After the show's initial episodes, Miss Pleshette said, she
objected to the garter belts and bras the actresses wore and
ordered ``appropriate'' undergarments.
   Changes were made but did not appear on television for about
four episodes, and well after the protests began, because of the
lag in airing prime-time programs, she said.
   A show about nurses dealing with AIDS, cancer, and other
diseases would make the program more interesting, said Ms. Lynch.
   ``What really makes a nurse is what's inside her heart and her
mind and how she deals with people and life issues,'' she added.
``That's more dramatic than seeing somebody jump up and down in
their tights.''

   Utah scientists who captured worldwide
attention with their claim to have achieved cold nuclear fusion
were probably fooled by faulty calculations, researchers from two
of the nation's most prominent science institutes say.
   Researchers from both the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and the California Institute of Technology are challenging the cold
fusion claim made at the University of Utah.
   Nathan Lewis said Monday that he and other Caltech researchers
conducted the most precise effort yet to duplicate the Utah
experiment and found that no fusion took place. He said the Utah
scientists calculated a gain in heat, but that precise measurements
at Caltech showed no such gain.
   Papers prepared by MIT researchers for presentation today at the
American Physical Society meeting also reported that verification
experiments conducted over a five-week period failed to detect any
fusion reaction.
   Richard Petrasso of MIT's Plasma Fusion Center said the amount
of neutrons, another fusion byproduct, emitted by the Utah
experiment was probably much lower than the Utah scientists
thought. He said the claimed flow was ``inconsistent'' with other
data reported from the Utah experiment.
   ``We're asserting that their neutron emission was below what
they thought it was, including the possibility that it could have
been none at all,'' Ronald R. Parker, director of MIT's Plasma
Fusion Center, said in a telephone interview Monday.
   The international physics community has spent millions of
dollars over the last quarter century attempting to achieve fusion
using massive machines filled with plasma heated to temperatures of
up to 100 million degrees.
   University of Utah chemist B. Stanley Pons and his collaborator,
Martin Fleischmann of England's University of Southampton, sent
shock waves through the scientific world March 23 when they said
they had achieved nuclear fusion using a simple electrochemical
cell at room temperature.
   Pons and Fleischmann said the cell used an electrode of
palladium and one of platinum that were immersed in a flask of
deuterium oxide, or heavy water. The researchers claimed that when
an electrical current was applied to the electrodes, deuterium
nuclei were jammed into the crystal lattice of the palladium until
the nuclei fused.
   When the fusion occurred, Pons and Fleischmann said, the device
produced four times more heat than was required to operate the
experiment. They later said the ratio of heat produced to heat
expended could be up to 8-1.
   But Lewis said Caltech researchers found a number of problems
with the Utah apparatus.
   ``These problems may lead to errors large enough to cast serious
doubts on published determinations of excess heat,'' said Lewis.
``When these errors are avoided, we obtain no evidence for excess
heat production.''
   However, James Brophy, University of Utah vice president of
research, said, ``The criticisms aren't really different than any
we've heard from the beginning.'' Valid objections are welcome, he
said, but, ``If it's out of pique, then I don't think it's
helpful.''
   Brophy said the negative results should be judged alongside
positive results from such institutions as Stanford, Texas A&amp;M and
Case Western Reserve.
   Brophy said Pons and Fleischmann ``are very good experimenters.
I can't believe they could carry out ... measurements, as they have
done, improperly.''
   Pons and Fleischmann, Lewis said, have admitted that their
report of a 4-1 energy return was based on mathematical
calculations and not on actual measurements. He said the Utah
researchers evidently used incorrect assumptions to make their
calculations.
   He said errors were easily made, for instance, if the heavy
water was not stirred to distribute heat evenly from the electrical
current. When the measurements were made correctly, said Lewis, it
was obvious that the total heat from the reaction was less than the
energy used to operate the experiment.
   Parker, meanwhile, said MIT researchers have been working for
weeks to verify the Utah experiments, but the results didn't hold
up when measured against a standard known as a Neutron Capture
Gamma Spectrum.
   ``If (fusion) occurred at all, it was far below what they
deduced from their measurements,'' Parker said.
   Part of the problem, Parker said, could be that Pons and
Fleischmann did not directly measure the neutrons released in their
experiment.
   ``The measurement they made was an indirect measurement, not of
neutrons directly, but of gamma rays produced by neutrons,'' Parker
said.
   The two MIT researchers said in a paper planned for presentation
to the conference that the Utah research apparently misinterpreted
some crucial data on neutrons.
   Lewis said the Caltech experiments used detection equipment
100,000 times more sensitive than devices used in the Utah
experiment. He said Caltech used instruments to detect and measure
any product of fusion, including neutrons or gamma rays, tritium or
helium, and any rise in heat.
   All such measurements, when performed correctly, were negative,
Lewis said.
   ``We have no reason to invoke fusion to explain any of their
results,'' he said. ``At this point, we can find no evidence of
anything except conventional chemistry.''

   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange increased
steadily to another record high Tuesday, while the dollar fell
slightly against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at 33,954.99, up
161.82 points, or 0.48 percent. It was the third straight day of
trading the stock market's main barometer set historic high levels.
   The dollar, after opening Tuesday at 133.75 yen, rose 0.10 yen
to 133.85 by the day's close, down 0.05 yen from Monday's close of
133.90 yen. It moved Tuesday between 133.65-134.05 yen.
   A dealer at Sumitomo Bank said the currency market was ``holding

high dollar and in anticipation of Bank of Japan intervention next
week.
   ``Today's calm in the market primarily reflects dealers stepping
back after yesterday's heavy trading,'' he said.
   On the stock market, dealers cited light trading without any
particular market-affecting news other than the approach of three
consecutive holidays, beginning Wednesday. Tokyo markets will close
Wednesday and reopen Monday.
   Dealers indicated there was significant buyer interest in steel
issues, however.

<TEXT>
   Alaska's annual rite of spring _ waiting
for the ice to melt in the Tanana River _ is over, and four of
150,000 bettors predicted the time to the minute.
   The 73rd annual Nenana Ice Classic, held 50 miles southwest of
Fairbanks in one of the state's coldest areas, is watched statewide
as a harbinger of warmer weather.
   A tripod on the ice is connected by a cable to a clock on shore.
When the ice thaw moves the tripod a certain distance, the cable
stops the clock.
   The tripod toppled over early Monday and moved 30 feet when a
downstream ice jam dislodged, but it wasn't until 8:14 p.m. Monday
that the tripod finally tripped the clock.
   Manager Wayne Taylor said four tickets had 8:14 p.m. on May 1 as
the time the ice would go out. They were bought by Doris Craig,
Michelle Phillips and Dennis Starr of Anchorage and a pool of
bettors in Fairbanks.
   The winners will divide $135,000 in prize money, Taylor said.
   About 150,000 tickets were sold at $2 apiece. The rest of the
money is spent on the contest.

   Sinhalese militants early today
attacked the country's largest army garrison with grenades and
automatic rifles but were beaten back before they could reach the
armory, a military official said.
   At least three militants were killed and five soldiers wounded
in the raid, which was launched during a heavy downpour at 1:30
a.m., said the official, who cannot be identified under briefing
rules.
   He said at least 100 militants attacked the Panagoda army
garrison, 12 miles southeast of Colombo, which usually holds
between 10,000 and 15,000 soldiers.
   The attack was the biggest raid on an army post by the militants
since they launched an anti-government campaign in 1987 to protest
peace overtures to ethnic Tamil rebels.
   The Sinhalese extremists contend the Sinhalese-dominated
government of this Indian Ocean island nation is making too many
concessions to the Tamil minority.
   The militants have attacked army camps and police stations in
the past to get weapons. The military official said the attackers
penetrated the Panagoda garrison's perimeter and came within yards
of its armory before being repulsed.
   Army helicopters and foot patrols searched rice paddies and
jungles around the camp for the militants, many of whom are
believed to be injured, he said.
   He said authorities thought the attackers belonged to the
People's Liberation Front, an ultra-nationalist Sinhalese group.
   The government has blamed the front for the killings of at least
3,000 people, mostly government officials and supporters, since Sri
Lanka signed a peace accord in July 1987 aimed at ending a Tamil
insurrection that started four years earlier.
   The largest Tamil rebel group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, also rejected the 1987 peace accord but opened talks with
the government last week.
   The talks were held after President Ranasinghe Premadasa offered
amnesty and seats in Parliament to the rebels and the Sinhalese
militants. The Sinhalese radicals rejected the government's offer.
   Sinhalese form 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 18 million people, and
Tamils make up 18 percent.

   A farmer proudly displayed his
calloused right index finger, stained with the purple ink designed
to ensure that no voter cast more than one vote.
   In his 60 years, Pablo Caballero has known little but
dictatorship and seen few elections that were not fixed. He said
his ink-stained finger represented the hope of change.
   ``Now we can vote freely for our own candidate with no rushing
or pressures,'' said Caballero, a feeling expressed Monday
throughout this rural farming town 80 miles east of Asuncion, the
capital.
   ``I am over the obligatory voting age, but I came to cast my
vote anyway because I have hopes that things will change,'' said
Ramon Ramirez, 64.
   The vote Monday to select a president and two-chamber congress
to replace the regime of former President Alfredo Stroessner,
ousted in a Feb. 3 coup, was mandatory for all Paraguayans between
18 and 60.
   Stroessner, 76, who took power in a 1954 coup, had eight
straight times arranged his own election. Rural peasants often were
trucked to voting sites, handed ballots for the ruling Colorado
Party and told to place them in the box while party officials
looked on.
   Caballero said he did not cast his ballot for the Colorados this
time.
   ``I voted for Domingo Laino of the Authentic Radical Liberal
Party because he always fought for freedom,'' added Caballero.
   Despite the support of voters such as Caballero, the election
was won by the general who deposed Stroessner: Colorado Party
candidate Andres Rodriguez.
   ``I'm going to vote for Gen. Rodriguez because he promised many
things to the peasants and he brought us democracy,'' said Eulalia
Dominguez, 33, in the town of Caacupe, 32 miles east of Asuncion.
   Clusters of farmers stood beside the highway in a light drizzle,
waiting for flatbed trucks of Rodriguez's and Laino's parties, the
two largest, to take them to voting sites. Others traveled by
bicycle, horse and tractor.
   Officials at voting sites in several small towns strictly
followed regulations, supplying private rooms for citizens to
choose in secrecy between the ballots supplied by the eight parties
participating in the elections.
   They also supplied indelible purple ink, furnished by the United
States, to mark voters' right index fingers.
   In the February 1988 election, only Colorado Party ballots could
be found at many voting places and private voting rooms were
scarce. But all sides called the election Monday more open.
   ``Some people are saying these are the cleanest elections in
Paraguayan history,'' said Omar Jara, 29, who quit his job as a
teacher because of low pay and now does odd jobs.
   ``But I say it is the cleanest fraud,'' he added. ``I would have
voted for Rodriguez, but you can see that the people around him are
just continuing the farce.''
   Opposition spokesmen reported some irregularities in voting,
such as indelible ink that washed off, registration of new voters
by Colorado officials on the day of balloting and some mix-ups with
voter registration lists.
   ``Things are somewhat better (than in 1988) but we still have a
long way to go,'' said Fernando Guillen, an observer for the
Revolutionary Febrerista Party in Arroyo San Jose, 60 miles east of
the capital.
   Lidia Ramirez, 64, of Caacupe, seemed to take the irregularities
in stride.
   ``It may not be perfect, but at least now we have freedom to
choose,'' she said, waiting in line to vote.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II today beatified a
19th century French missionary considered the apostle of the slaves
brought to this island, saying he should inspire islanders to fight
today's ``slavery of materialism.''
   The pope celebrated a beatification Mass on the palm-fringed
esplanade of the Notre Dame of the Trinity church. The crowd was
estimated at up to 200,000, two-fifths of the entire population of
this volcanic Indian Ocean island.
   French Prime Minister Michel Rocard, wearing a straw hat to ward
off the tropical sun, headed the official French delegation at the
ceremony. Reunion has been a French Overseas Territory since 1946,
   The pope arrived on the island Monday night after a three-day
visit to the African island of Madagascar, the first stop of his
nine-day pilgrimage. He headed later today to Zambia, traveling for
the first time on the Concorde.
   He is to visit Malawi later in the week and return to Rome
Saturday.
   The beatification represented a first step towards possible
sainthood for Jean-Bernard Rousseau, known as Brother Scubilion,
who died in 1867 at the age of 70. Born in Burgundy and baptized
secretly during the French Revolution, Rousseau joined the Brother
of the Christian Schools and moved to this island, then known as
Bourbon, in 1833.
   He remained 34 years until his death, devoting himself to
teaching catechism to the African slaves brought to the island by
the French colonists to work the coffee plantations.
   Described by local church officials as a ``non-violent
subversive,'' he is credited with helping create the climate for
the abolishment of slavery in 1848.
   About 70 percent of Reunion's current population are descended
from the slaves. Ninety percent of the population is Roman Catholic.
   ``Brother Scubilion is a remarkable witness of the movement for
holiness begun on this island by the first missionaries,'' the
white-robed pope said in his homily in French. ``He enlightened
others with the light of Jesus Christ by his example and,
especially, by his catechism among the slaves.''
   ``He helped them to gain confidence ... to give meaning to their
lives, to march toward hope, and he distinguished himself in the
service to the sick, showing much compassion for his brothers in
distress.''
   John Paul said today's Catholics in Reunion should follow
Brother Scubilion's example and ``build a society more respectful
of human dignity, without being afraid of saying no to the slavery
of materialism that could seduce you.''
   ``On your island, you enjoy a relative abundance,'' he said.
``At the same time, the race to consumerism can lead away from the
real evangelist path ...''
   Reunion, covering 970 square miles, is the most prosperous of
the four stops on the pope's trip. Its economy is based on sugar
exports and tourism, and the per capita income is $3,500, compared
to only a few hundred dollars in the other countries.
   Earlier today, the pope met with a group of youths in the garden
of the residence of the local bishops. He cautioned them not to be
seeduced by secularization, pornography, casual sex and the
``temptation of magic.''
   He did not elaborate on that topic, but local church officials
have expressed concern about the spread of superstition, fetishism,
exorcism and satanic cults.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Declares Illinois Death Penalty Unconstitutional</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge's ruling that Illinois'
death penalty law is unconstitutional could help to resolve legal
questions that have loomed since it was enacted in 1977, experts
say.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Baker said Monday the law gives
prosecutors too much leeway in deciding when to seek the death
penalty, violating U.S. Supreme Court rulings that states must
ensure capital punishment is not imposed in an ``arbitrary and
capricious'' manner.
   If higher courts agree, Baker's decision would invalidate the
sentences of the 121 men currently facing the death penalty in
Illinois. Among them is John W. Gacy, convicted of killing 33 young
men and boys in the worst multiple-killing case in U.S. history.
   Baker's decision marked the first time a federal judge has ruled
on the constitutionality of Illinois' death penalty law. The U.S.
Supreme Court has never agreed to hear an Illinois death penalty
case.
   In the past, legal experts have said a final resolution of the
issue was unlikely until federal courts addressed a case focusing
solely on the constitutional question.
   ``I think we've finally got a case where the issue has been
squarely addressed in the district court and will be squarely
addressed on appeal,'' said David Bradford, a Chicago attorney who
has handled appeals of Death- Row inmates.
   Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan said the state would
appeal the ruling to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Chicago. Michael Ficaro, Hartigan's first assistant, said he was
confident Baker's ruling would be overturned.
   ``The Illinois Supreme Court has dealt with that issue over 60
times,'' he said. ``We believe the statute is constitutional.''
   Because of prolonged appeals no one has been executed under the
1977 statute.
   Jay Miller, director of the Illinois chapter of the American
Civil Liberties Union, said: ``We think they're all
unconstitutional. I don't think there's any way to write a death
penalty law that's constitutional.''
   Baker's ruling came in the case of a man who demanded the death
penalty after being convicted in 1980 of killing two people in
Vermilion County.
   Appeals on behalf of Charles Silagy reached the state Supreme
Court twice and the U.S. Supreme Court once but were unsuccessful
until his case reached Baker in one of the last stages of the
appeals process.
   The state's capital punishment law allows a trial court to
consider a death sentence in certain circumstances, such as a
multiple killing, but only when requested by the prosecution.
   In 1979, the state Supreme Court ruled 4-3 that the prosecutors'
authority to seek the death penalty is not significantly different
than their power to seek criminal prosecution.
   But Baker sided with the dissenting justices in that case.
   ``Our statute contains no directions or guidelines to minimize
the risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action by the
prosecutor in either requesting ... or in not requesting a (death
sentence) hearing,'' wrote Justice Howard C. Ryan, whose opinion
was cited by Baker.

   A mysterious oil spill in March that
contaminated beaches on two islands has been traced to an
inter-island cruise ship, the Coast Guard announced.
   Oil samples taken from SS Independence matched samples taken
from beaches on Lanai and Molokai and from a slick between the
islands, Capt. Gordon Piche told reporters Monday.
   Attorney Robert Frame, who represents American Hawaii Cruises,
which operates the boat, said the company was cooperating with the
Coast Guard but would do its own investigation to check the
findings.
   ``The company will abide by whatever laws apply,'' he said.
   Under federal water pollution control laws, the company could
face a maximum civil penalty of $5,000 and would have to repay the
government for the cost of the cleanup, which is estimated at more
than $100,000, Piche said.
   The findings will be turned over to a Coast Guard hearings
officer within six weeks, Piche said. It will be up to the U.S.
attorney's office to press criminal charges, which carry a maximum
penalty of a $10,000 fine, he added.
   Piche said the boat apparently dumped about 10,000 gallons of
bunker fuel oil into the ocean by accident while pumping fresh
water out of ballast tanks on the night of March 24.
   The spill washed ashore along a 10-mile stretch of the east end
of Molokai and along 10 miles of the northeast side of Lanai. There
have been no reports of any damage to wildlife, Piche said.
   Company officials were informed Monday of the findings and
``their reaction was they didn't see how it could have happened,''
Piche said.

   For Lynette Clark, there may be a
$16-an-hour pot of gold at the end of the oil spill cleanup rainbow.
   She and hundreds of others have crowded into this Prince William
Sound community in search of work and hefty paychecks.
   They live in mobile homes, school buses, soggy tents. Mostly,
they wait.
   ``We've got all our pigs in a poke and our options working,''
said Clark, a gold miner from a town near Fairbanks who has been
here a week. She set up housekeeping in her battered green car in a
gravel parking lot.
   ``Things haven't gotten savage here, yet,'' she said, smiling.
``They might, but they haven't. It's a real boom-town atmosphere.
It's so similar to the North Slope in the 1970s when they were
building the pipeline.''
   Exxon has said it will hire 4,000 people by early June to help
clean up the nation's worst oil spill.
   After loading up at the trans-Alaska pipeline terminal here, the
Exxon Valdez rammed Bligh Reef on March 24, dumping more than 10
million gallons of heavy North Slope crude oil into Prince William
Sound. The oil has moved out of the sound, soiling Gulf of Alaska
beaches.
   When word of Exxon's initial cleanup plan got out, a steady
stream of job hunters headed to Valdez.
   The Alaska Department of Labor Job Service office, which tries
to match employers with workers, has been forced to bring in three
additional staff members and stay open seven days a week to keep up.
   ``In the last two weeks, the number coming through this office
has grown daily,'' said the agency's Pat Wilson. ``We're averaging
500 a day. That's in a town with a population of 3,000. And the
volume is growing, definitely growing.''
   Before the spill, perhaps 20 people a day came looking for work,
she said.
   Now, jobs for waitresses, cooks, maids go begging. A bulletin
board in the jobs agency is covered with cards seeking workers. But
most of the newcomers are holding out for the big banana, an Exxon
job ankle deep in oil.
   The Job Service receives up to 300 telephone calls a day from
people seeking work. The calls come from as far away as Mexico,
Sweden, France and Norway.
   For those in Valdez, the agency starts its day early.
Weary-looking men and women start lining up down the block at 5:30
a.m., waiting for the office to open at 7. A stampede through the
doors as they opened one day last week pinned two Job Service
workers against a wall. A security guard was hired to keep order.
   Don Robinson, an unemployed painter, has been here a week,
living in his car, showing up each day at the crack of dawn, hoping
for a 12-hour-a-day, $16-an-hour Exxon job.
   ``It's wait, wait, wait. They don't tell you anything,'' he said.
   The Job Service is providing non-union job applications for one
of Exxon's contractors, VECO.
   Wilson said VECO will only look at applications submitted by
Alaska residents. She said federal law prohibits release of the
number of people hired by VECO or any other employer.
   But she said hundreds of people have been hired through the
agency since the spill.
   Norcon Inc., another oil field service contractor, is hiring
union labor for Exxon through Laborers Local 341.
   Twice a day, seven days a week, the cramped, smoke-filled
hallway outside the tiny union office is jammed with job seekers.
   Bill McPheters, business agent for the local, said 40 people a
day sign up to join the union. More than 700 have signed up.
   The local normally has about 65 members.
   The union has sent out more than 500 potential workers since the
spill, and about 80 percent went to Norcon, McPheters said.
   He said the union has been trying to ensure that Alaskans with
at least a year of residency get the jobs.
   ``We want to put our Alaskans to work. They've been through some
hard times,'' he said. ``And we have plenty of qualified Alaskans.''

   Edward R. Murrow and Bill Cosby have been
named by a TV Guide panel to the magazine's ``TV Hall of Fame'' for
their lasting contributions to television.
   The four-member panel, formed to honor broadcast and
entertainment stars on television's 50th anniversary, gave Cosby
and Morrow four votes each. Seven others also were voted in, the
magazine said this week.
   They were: Lucille Ball, Milton Berle and Carroll O'Connor each
with three votes; and Walter Cronkite, Barbara Walters, Howard
Cosell and Ted Koppel each with two.
   Others receiving one vote and listed as honorable mentions by
the magazine, were Bishop Fulton J. Sheen; Dr. Martin Luther King;
Joseph Welch, the lawyer who denounced Sen. Joseph McCarthy; Mike
Wallace; Bill Moyers; Steve Allen; Bob Hope; James Garner; Dick Van
Dyke; and Mary Tyler Moore.
   The panel members were Fred Friendly, former CBS News president;
Elton Rule, former president and chief executive officer of ABC
Inc. and now president of the American Academy of Television Arts
and Sciences Foundation; Fred Silverman, former NBC president who
is now an executive producer; and producer David Wolper, who was
responsible for such miniseries as ``Roots'' and ``The Thorn
Birds.''
   Murrow was at the top of the list because he ``still is the
bench mark by which all broadcast journalists are measured,'' said
Friendly, who was Murrow's producer on CBS's ``See It Now'' program.
   Cosby was honored because he ``was able to get around being a
black performer. He is looked upon as Cosby and people are
colorblind,'' Rule said.

   Gen. Andres Rodriguez, who ousted
strongman Alfredo Stroessner three months ago, was elected
president by an overwhelming margin and his party kept control of
congress, unofficial returns showed today.
   The leaders and presidential candidates of four opposition
parties denounced what they said were ``shameful irregularities''
in Monday's voting and did not concede defeat.
   Foreign observers and diplomats agreed that there were
irregularities, but said the balloting was reasonably fair and that
victory clearly belonged to Rodriguez, who had been Stroessner's
No. 2 man.
   ``We promise our people that we will carry Paraguay on a bright
path to its destiny of greatness and happiness,'' a grinning
Rodriguez said in a champagne toast to party members late Monday at
his chateau-style mansion.
   His Colorado Party has ruled this landlocked country of 4
million people since 1947.
   Domingo Laino, the presidential candidate of the Authentic
Radical Liberal Party and a former exile, finished second.
   In initial official returns released early today Rodriguez
tallied 22,201 of the 29,293 votes for president, or 75.8 percent,
and the Colorados garnered 19,883, or 68.4 percent, of 29,064 votes
for congress.
   The Colorados said their partial count showed that of 1,048,299
votes for president, Rodriguez received 778,479, or 74.3 percent.
Official and unofficial tallies gave Laino about 20 percent of the
vote.
   The Colorados received 741,583 votes of 1,007,548 cast for
congress, or 73.6 percent, according to the party's count.
   Tallies by the Christian Democratic Party and a coalition of
sociological research firms had lower totals, but also showed
one-sided counts in favor of Rodriguez and the Colorados.
   Rodriguez, 65, deposed Stroessner in a coup on Feb. 3 and sent
him into exile in Brazil, promising broadened civil liberties and
pledging to move the country toward democracy.
   Stroessner, who seized power in a 1954 coup, had arranged to be
elected every five years through patronage and intimidation.
   The voting Monday was to replace Stroessner and the 36-member
senate and 72-seat chamber of deputies that were to have served
through August 1993.
   By law the Colorados, as the winning party in the congressional
elections, would receive 24 of the 36 Senate seats and 48 of the 72
seats in the Chamber of deputies.
   The partial Colorado vote count represented about 45 percent of
the 2.2 million people on official voter registration lists. The
opposition had claimed the list was dated and bloated, and even the
Central Electoral Board said it might contain as many as 600,000
duplicate or fake names.
   ``From the first moment of voting, serious difficulties and
grave fraud occurred, which offend our civic culture and test our
tolerance to the limit,'' said Laino.
   Election observers and local party officials said space wasn't
always set aside to allow citizens to vote in private; ballots for
a specific party often were missing; some voters were not permitted
to cast ballots and not every station had indelible ink to mark
fingers and prevent double voting.
   Euclides Acevedo, president of the Revolutionary Febrerista
Party, accused the Colorados of stealing his party's ballots at
some voting places.
   Juan Ramon Chaves, chairman of the Colorado Party, accused Laino
supporters of doing the same to his party.
   ``Yes, there were irregularities, but how significant they were,
I'm not sure,'' said British Ambassador John Grant McDonald. ``I
think it was a very good attempt at something they have never done
before.''
   Voters stood in long lines in chilly fall weather and a light
drizzle to cast ballots.
   ``My party was founded in 1965. This is the first time we're
participating in elections,'' said Martin Caceres, 28, a Christian
Democrat.
   ``People are hopeful,'' he said, standing in a school courtyard.
``The period of Stroessner hasn't ended ... but this is a
beneficial transition _ peaceful, with people getting used to
democracy.''
   Rodriguez named himself provisional president after ousting
Stroessner and, distancing himself from the regime, improved
relations with foreign governments and the Roman Catholic Church,
to which most Paraguayans belong.
   In Coronel Oviedo, a large rural town east of the capital, Ramon
Ramirez, a 64-year-old peasant, said Monday: ``I am past the age
where voting is mandatory, but I came to cast my ballot because I
have hopes that things will change from now on.''
   Voting was mandatory for citizens ages 18 to 60 and failure to
vote punishable by a small fine.

   For the second time in three years, Robert
and Paula Sims say someone has swiped their infant daughter, but
few neighbors are rushing to their defense.
   ``It just seems too strange,'' said Carol Hailer, who lives
across the street. ``We don't have kidnappings here _ and not two
in one family.''
   The Simses said 6-week-old Heather was abducted Saturday night
under circumstances almost identical to the disappearance of their
13-day-old daughter, Loralei, three years ago.
   Loralei's body was found five days later, about 150 feet from
the Simses' home in Brighton, 10 miles from this town of 40,000
residents. No cause of death was determined and no arrest was made
in that case, although authorities said the parents were suspects.
   On Monday, police in this Mississippi River town across from St.
Louis, said they were treating Heather's disappearance as a
kidnapping reported by the parents.
   ``But we're not ruling anything out,'' said Sgt. Rick McCain,
chief of detectives.
   ``They said they feel someone is out to get them,'' McCain said.
``But they don't have anyone specific ... and haven't given us any
names.''
   Robert Sims was approached by reporters as he arrived at his
home Monday night.
   ``I can't say anything,'' he said, citing the advice of police.
``I don't mean to be rude, I just can't say anything.''
   A steady stream of cars drove past the house Monday night, with
most motorists slowing long enough to get a good look. Neighbors
were peering out of windows and doors.
   Mrs. Sims said she was approached by a gunman outside their home
Saturday night while her husband was at work at a steel plant, said
Sgt. Bud Pyatt.
   Mrs. Sims told police she was forced back into the house and
knocked unconscious. An hour later, she told authorities, her
husband returned home and revived her, but Heather was gone.
   A hospital found no evidence of injury when they checked Mrs.
Sims _ ``no bruises or anything,'' McCain said.
   ``There is nothing that disproves their allegations,'' he said.
``But we are not discounting the information from the other case.''
   Even the times of the reported abductions are similar.
   In 1986, Mrs. Sims said she was attacked about 10:20 p.m. And on
Saturday, she told police the assailant struck at 10:30 p.m., after
she returned from taking out the trash.
   Neighbors said the couple, who also have a 15-month-old son,
have kept to themselves since they moved from Brighton to their
two-story home in Alton about two years ago.
   ``All I can tell you is I never saw them,'' Mrs. Hailer said.
``I saw her once in two years. I didn't even know she had children.
They put up the fence when they first moved in and that's the last
anybody ever saw of them.''
   Police said the couple's young son was sleeping in the house at
the time but was not disturbed. No valuables were reported missing
from the house.
   In Jersey County, where the Simes lived in 1986 when they
reported the first abduction, Sheriff Frank Yocom said they were
suspects in Loralei's death.
   During a grand jury investigation, the couple declined to
testify, citing their constitutional right against
self-incrimination, Yocom said. The grand jury returned no
indictment.
   Asked about the new case, Yocom replied: ``It's unbelievable.''

   A woman who was severely beaten and raped in
Central Park by a gang of youths has shown signs of emerging from a
coma, and gave a ``high five'' sign for a hospital worker, doctors
said.
   The 28-year-old woman remained in a coma Monday and physicians
were not optimistic about her chances for a full recovery, but she
has squeezed hands, raised her eyebrows, smiled at jokes and nodded
vigorously, said Dr. Robert S. Kurtz.
   ``Over the last day our patient has shown an increased level of
alertness,'' Kurtz told reporters at Metropolitan Hospital.
   ``She certainly isn't fully awake and we're still in some
concern about ultimate outcome,'' he added. ``But obviously these
changes are for the better.''
   The victim, an investment banker, was jumped by the gang April
19 as she jogged through an isolated section of Central Park on her
nightly run. Six teen-agers have been indicted on charges of
attempted murder, rape, sodomy and assault.
   Kurtz said an electroencephalogram, a measure of brain waves
known as an EEG, showed ``a better pattern than last week.'' The
woman's eyes are now open some of the time, he said.
   Neurologists use a scale of 3 to 15 to measure brain function.
The woman came into the hospital at 4 or 5, improved to 7 for most
of last week, and now is roughly an 11, just below consciousness,
Kurtz said.
   ``She's not completely, totally comatose,'' he said.
   On Sunday, a hospital staff member asked her to give a ``high
five'' and the woman, who was in semi-upright, raised her hand,
Kurtz said.
   Kurtz said she sometimes raises her eyebrows when her name is
called, squeezes hands when asked, and once nodded vigorously when
asked if she wanted to see one of her Wall Street co-workers.
   ``There's just too many of these experiences to ignore them or
totally downplay them,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, he said doctors were ``pretty concerned about
whether she'll make a full recovery. It's not out of the question.
... The woods are full of stories of amazing recoveries when no one
ever expected it.''
   The odds, however, are that she will have a ``significant
neurological deficit,'' the extent of which won't be known for some
time, he said.

<HEAD>Shanghai Students March, Beijing Students Set Deadline For `Real'
Dialogue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: LEADS with 10 grafs to UPDATE with Shanghai march on, student
ultimatum delivered in Beijing. Picks up 10th pvs, `Other conditions ...'

<TEXT>
   Nearly 6,000 students calling for democracy and
press freedom marched today in Shanghai, and students in Beijing
threatened to march in the capital again unless the government
recognizes their union in 24 hours.
   The Shanghai students set out in the early afternoon from Fudan
University and East China Teachers University and marched to the
downtown People's Square.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said they carried banners
reading ``Give us democracy and freedom,'' ``Oppose privileges''
and ``Media must tell the truth.'' It said they planned to present
a petition to local officials.
   In Beijing, a delegation of 65 students from 33 schools
delivered an ultimatum to China's legislature, Cabinet and the
Central Committee of the ruling Communist Party.
   The students are demanding the government recognize and hold
talks with independent associations they have set up during their
2-week-old pro-democracy campaign. They want a free press, freedom
of assembly and publication and an end to official corruption.
   Wang Dan, a student leader from Beijing University, said the
government had agreed to respond by the deadline, noon Wednesday.
   Beijing students already have defied police warnings and marched
five times since April 17 to Tiananmen Square, the country's
symbolic seat of power. About 70,000 students at 41 colleges also
have been boycotting class since April 24.
   After a march on Thursday drew cheers and applause from tens of
thousands of bystanders, the government held a series of meetings
with invited students.
   However, most of the invited students have been members of
officially established unions that student protesters have rejected
since the demonstrations started. The government has said the
students' new associations are illegal.
   Representatives of the United Association of Beijing
Universities, an umbrella group for the new student groups, said
their ultimatum listed 12 conditions for a dialogue, beginning with
recognition of the association.
   Other conditions included government willingness to discuss a
free press and disclosure by officials of their financial records.
   Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong and city party chief Li Ximing told
invited students at a meeting Sunday that they each earn about $80
a month, abut 50 percent more than the average factory worker.
   But students later complained that Chen and Li did not mention
job perks, including comfortable apartments, free meals and use of
government cars.
   If the government refuses to recognize the United Association,
Beijing students will hold another march on Thursday, student
activists said.
   Thursday is the 70th anniversary of China's first democratic
movement, in which about 3,000 Beijing students marched to protest
Japanese occupation of Chinese territory. The students also called
then for democratic and scientific reforms to strengthen the
country against foreign encroachment.
   Last Thursday, about 150,000 students and ordinary citizens
marched through Beijing in the biggest demonstration in 40 years of
Communist rule.
   Student activists said they don't expect as large a turnout if
they march again this week. Many students have gone home for the
May Day holiday and are not expected to return until next week,
said one student at People's University whose red armband marked
him as an activist.
   ``Student emotions are relatively calm now, but they will be
easily aroused,'' he said.
   Student posters at Beijing University called for a letter
campaign to protest the dismissal of World Economic Herald editor
Qin Benli.
   He was fired from the Shanghai weekly after rejecting government
orders not to publish articles calling for a reassessment of former
Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang, who was ousted in 1987 for being
too liberal. Hu's death on April 15 triggered the student protests.
   A telegram sent to Shanghai officials by Chinese Academy of
Science researchers warned, ``Anyone who blocks the course of
democratization in China will be judged severely by the people.''

   Members of a rural church shaken by the
slayings of their minister, his wife and two daughters have settled
into the rituals of mourning, accepting condolences from neighbors
and the minister's teen-age son.
   The peace inside the Olive Branch Church of the United Brethren
in Christ, perched near the top of a small rise amid greening trees
and freshly tilled fields, was shattered Sunday by the slayings.
   The bodies of the Rev. Robert L. Pelley, 38, his 32-year-old
wife, Dawn, and daughters Janel, 8, and Jolene, 6, were found in
the parsonage Sunday morning after the family failed to appear for
services.
   Investigators say the slayings may have occurred Saturday
afternoon.
   Police have ruled out burglary or theft, as well as
murder-suicide. They have refused to discuss possible motives.
   The four victims all apparently were shot at close range with
the same weapon, said St. Joseph County sheriff's Sgt. Charles
Feirrell. Autopsy results were not expected before today, he said.
   In an act of condolence Monday, members of neighboring churches
brought cold cuts, salads and soft drinks for the congregation that
gathered informally at the church.
   ``Even people who don't go to any church were bringing things,''
said Alfred Price, superintendent of the United Brethren's Northern
Ohio Conference, which includes part of northern Indiana.
   Joining the mourners was Jeff Pelley, 17, the minister's only
son. He returned to the parsonage Monday after being gone Saturday
and Sunday for his high school prom and a visit with friends at an
amusement park north of Chicago.
   Pelley entered the one-story frame house where his father,
stepmother and stepsisters died. He emerged moments later with a
garbage bag filled with belongings and crossed the gravel parking
lot to console grieving members of the congregations.
   Some members embraced and wept.
   ``You have a bond here that a lot of times you don't find in a
bigger church,'' said Richard Thorpe, a former pastor at the church.
   The church's communion Bible was opened to a verse of the Old
Testament book of Isaiah that said ``the righteous perisheth.'' A
financial statement posted on the bulletin board showed Pelley
earned $1,250 a month, and the church bank balance totaled $254.94.
   The Pelleys had married after their first spouses died,
congregation members said. Jeff and Jackie, 14, were Pelley's
children from his first marriage, and Jessica, 10, Janel and Jolene
came from Ms. Pelley's first marriage.
   Jackie was attending a church camp when the killings occurred,
and Jessica had spent the night with friends, police said.
   The Rev. Don Merrilatt, a United Brethren pastor from a nearby
town, said Pelley had just written a paper on merging broken
families for a counseling course they were attending at Huntington
College.
   Merrilatt said Pelley had talked about friction among the
children in the new family, but declined to elaborate.
   However, church member Beatrice Roush, 66, said she babysat
frequently for the Pelley's younger children and noticed no signs
of strain. ``They all got along fine,'' she said.

   Most of the West can expect a nearly normal fire
season after five years of drought-fueled infernos, but there is
still a ``great potential'' for fire in the parched Southwest,
officials say.
   ``We're not in bad shape right now,'' Steve Brown, staff
meteorologist at the Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, said
Monday. ``I don't think we're going to see much until we get into
the actual summer.''
   Increased precipitation has relieved drought conditions in many
areas, including parts of the Rockies that were ravaged by fire
last year, Brown said in a telephone interview. But uncertain
prospects for more wet weather in coming months still cloud the
fire outlook, he said.
   Weather forecasters ``tell us that from May to July we have
equal chances of above-normal or below-normal precipitation and
above-normal or below-normal temperatures,'' said Rob Harper of the
Washington state Department of Natural Resources. ``That basically
says it's unclear what the outlook is.''
   Ironically, the improved precipitation could heighten the danger
of range fires in many areas by promoting the growth of grass that
could serve as fuel later, Brown said.
   Brown, who is responsible for outdoor fire danger forecasts
nationwide, said he was compiling data for a report due to be
released late this week.
   The biggest danger area is the Southwest. Much lower-than-normal
winter snowfall and spring rains pose a fire threat in Arizona and
New Mexico and southern parts of California, Utah, Nevada and
Colorado.
   ``There's not much question ... (of) a great potential right
now'' for wildfires in those areas, Brown said. ``The fuels are
already drying out.''
   Soil and debris on the forest floor in parts of northern Arizona
are as dry now as they were in August, he said.
   The next greatest fire potential is in the intermountain region
_ northern portions of Utah and Nevada, southern Idaho and parts of
eastern Oregon and Washington _ where the snowpack is melting
rapidly and the long-range forecast calls for warm temperatures,
Brown said.
   Scott Kaiser of the National Weather Service in Boise said the
snowmelt in Idaho was ``10 to 14 days ahead of normal,'' reducing a
snowpack that was normal as of mid-April to 80 percent to 85
percent of normal now.
   Despite four small forest fires during a warm, windy spell last
weekend in Washington, the outlook for the Pacific Northwest,
Northern California Northwest and the northern Rockies is near
normal, Brown said.
   The largest blaze, a 308-acre fire on Washington's Olympic
Peninsula, was stopped dead by cooler, damper weather Monday, said
Warren Hartman of the U.S. Forest Service. Containment was expected
today.
   The Rockies, including fire-ravaged Yellowstone National Park,
``have gotten their fair share of precipitation,'' leading to
``quite a decrease in the drought conditions that existed
earlier,'' Brown said.
   The situation could deteriorate, however, as high pressure and
relatively dry weather is likely to remain over the middle of the
country for the next 30 days, he said.
   Last year, the Boise command center recorded 7,250 wildfires on
more than 5 million acres of land _ an area more than 1{ times the
size of Connecticut. That was 30 percent more than the 1983-87
annual average number of fires and 137 percent more than the
average annual acreage.

<HEAD>`Largely New York,' Starring Bill Irwin, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS three grafs with other New York reviews; no PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Largely New York,'' a Bill Irwin extravaganza
that he also wrote and directed, is a merry marriage of video and
vaudeville.
   The show is tailor-made for people who have trouble figuring out
how to operate their VCRs. That means just about everyone should
enjoy this innovative entertainment, which opened Monday at
Broadway's St. James Theater.
   Irwin, wearing a Mad Hatter chapeau, baggy pants, oversized
glasses and an eager smile, is one of those clowns who knows the
history of funny business, particularly the sublime antics of
Chaplin and Keaton. But he also has a fascination with the present,
especially the ever-changing technology of television that has
reshaped the performance arena for clown comedy.
   What Irwin has done with ``Largely New York'' is bring past and
present together. In the show, he plays a good-natured Everyman
called ``The Post-Modern Hoofer,'' a character determined to tap
his way through ``Tea for Two'' if only he could get what sounds
like the Mighty Wurlitzer to finish playing the tune.
   He never does, and the interruptions are what ``Largely New
York'' is all about. Along the way, he encounters a variety of
characters, people who inhabit that peculiar cultural environment
called New York.
   During his 75-minute adventure, the clown meets a pretty modern
dancer, two breakdancing experts, a video production crew and a
gaggle of academics, dressed in caps and gowns and looking like a
convention of angry headwaiters.
   Irwin's journey, made without any dialogue, is controlled by a
demented remote control device which he carries. He uses it to turn
on stage lights, raise and lower curtains and activate various
musical soundtracks.
   Irwin swoons for dancer Margaret Eginton, who spoofs the
angular, jerky movements of modern dance. Her choreographed actions
are similar to the precision steps of Leon Chesney and Steve
Clemente, two terrific breakdancers who deservedly earn cheers for
their gymnastic feats of wonder.
   The clown, a sweet romantic, follows Miss Eginton _ not only in
person but on a video monitor provided by someone called a
``videographer'' and his assistant.
   In a way, Irwin has more of a relationship with this video
equipment than he does with real people. In one instance, he
becomes entangled in a video camera tripod and performs a kind of
pas de deux with the equipment. The tripod leads.
   In another, the comedian manages to find himself trapped inside
a television monitor and then needs help from his breakdancing
friends and a bright orange vacuum cleaner to get out. The vacuum
finally whooshes Irwin out of the tube and into his battered old
actor's trunk. A nifty trick.
   In a third encounter, Irwin dances with his screen image and
ends up being reprimanded by his TV counterpart for getting carried
away.
   Irwin also battles the stage curtain _ and loses _ but not
before he is carried high above the audience by this man-eating
piece of red cloth.
   The clown also is badgered by the disapproving academics who
follow him around the stage. One of them, called the Dean, ends up
falling into the orchestra pit. But he's a game fellow,
particularly as played by Jeff Gordon who gives new meaning to the
word pratfall. He keeps coming back for more and gets it,
eventually swan-diving into the pit.
   Much of this foolishness gets captured on tape by the
videographer, and Irwin ends up appearing in and watching the show
at the same time. The line between reality and illusion blurs, but
they are linked by laughter. It's a laughter that Irwin conjures up
in the most inventive and dazzling way possible.
   In other reviews, The New York Times' Frank Rich said Irwin
``cuts a most human figure on stage and even allows himself a
final-curtain kiss, but his clowning, however slapstick, often
remains austerely intellectual in its preoccupations.''
   Clive Barnes, writing in the New York Post, said Irwin ``is an
enormous talent still trying to find a proper outlet.''
   Howard Kissel, writing in the Daily News, said the work
sometimes seems ``repetitive and facile, but it's full of an
irrepressible, impish imagination.''

   Up to 2,000 militant leftists left a May Day
street festival in West Berlin and clashed with police into early
today, smashing windows, overturning cars and leaving more than 320
officers injured, authorities said.
   Hesse State radio called it the worst violence in West Berlin in
the 1980s.
   The young leftist protesters, many of them wearing black hoods
to hide their identities, had broken off from the street festival
in the Kreuzberg district to take part in the violence.
   Several vehicles, including police vehicles, were turned over by
the protesters and set afire, police said.
   West Berlin police, in a statement to the news media, said 322
policemen were injured in the rampaging, at least 14 of them
hospitalized for treatment. The statement said 16 people were
arrested.
   At least 120 police vehicles called in to quell the rioting were
damaged by rocks or firebombs and windows and doors of more than
100 buildings were smashed in the melee, police said.
   There was no immediate estimate of damage, and cleanup crews
were still working this morning to clear Kreuzberg streets of
rubble left behind by the rioting.
   West Berlin's Kreuzberg district, which is home to many leftist
and student groups, has often been the scene of disturbances over
the years.

<HEAD>Trump Agrees Not To Buy More Casinos If Licenses Are Renewed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAWRENCEVILLE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state gaming commission has
forced billionaire developer Donald Trump into an agreement that
will regulate his purchase of stocks, bonds or other assets of his
casino industry competitors.
   Trump _ who owns two Atlantic City casinos, a third under
construction and has plans for two non-casino hotels _ acceded to
the pact Monday in an attempt to assure renewal of his gaming
license by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission.
   Under the agreement, Trump will have to obtain prior approval
from state regulators before acquiring interests in gaming industry
corporations in Atlantic City.
   A vote on the proposed renewal of Trump's gaming license for the
Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino and Trump Castle Hotel &amp; Casino was
scheduled for May 10.
   Trump went along with the restriction after regulators
questioned his investment in an aborted plan to take over Caesars
World Inc. last year, his major competitor in Atlantic City.
   Trump bought 600,000 _ or 2.5 percent _ of the shares of Caesars
stock despite a warning in 1987 from Casino Control Commission
Chairman Walter N. Read.
   Although Trump is the dominant force in Atlantic City's real
estate and gaming industries, Caesar's Atlantic City Hotel-Casino
was the resort's top money winner in 1988, according to state
figures. The Trump Plaza was second.
   Caesars posted a $307.6 million profit for 1988, a 6.7 percent
increase over 1987. Trump Plaza was next, with $300.9 million, a 23
percent increase over the previous year.
   The agreement on stock purchases was worked out behind closed
doors between chairman Read and Trump.
   At the meeting, Read repeated his displeasure with Trump's
attempted takeover of Caesars World. Read and Commissioner Frank J.
Dodd have made it clear they do not want to see the industry run by
the free-wheeling rules of Monopoly, the board game that made
Atlantic City's street names famous.
   Besides two operating gaming halls, Trump's third casino, the
Taj Mahal, is under construction. The developer says it will be the
world's largest gaming hall when completed next year.
   Last month, Trump purchased the abandoned Penthouse casino
project and announced plans to turn it into a 1,000-room non-casino
hotel. He also has signed an agreement to buy the bankrupt Atlantis
Casino Hotel for $63 million and turn it into a hotel without
gaming.

<HEAD>Florida Destroys Swarm of `Killer Bees'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A swarm of about 500 Africanized honeybees,
popularly known as ``killer bees,'' has been destroyed at Miami's
port, state officials said.
   The bees, hitchhiking on the outside of a container brought in
from Suriname aboard the freighter Werner, were discovered April 21
by workers at the Omni Terminal in downtown Miami, Agriculture
Commissioner Doyle Conner said Monday.
   The bees were destroyed that day by a state inspector, but as a
precaution additional bait hives have been placed in the port and
surrounding area.
   It is the fifth swarm of the highly aggressive bees that has
been discovered and destroyed in Florida in the last four years.
   Last May, a swarm of about 10,000 was found at Fort Lauderdale
aboard a freighter carrying fruit and vegetables from Guatemala.
   Conner said his department has had about two dozen bait hives at
Miami's port, Miami International Airport and the Miami River for
some time. The additional bait hives put in place since the swarm
was discovered will bring the number to more than 50.
   ``The first bait hive we ever placed was in Miami because it's
an area we've always been concerned about,'' Conner said. ``There
is just a tremendous interchange between Miami and Central and
South American countries, virtually all of which are now infested
with Africanized bees.''
   State and federal inspectors monitor up to 300 bait hives in 13
port areas in Florida.
   The bees have been migrating north from Brazil since the 1950s
and now are in the central part of Mexico. They are expected to
reach the Texas border sometime next year.
   Officials in Florida are not expecting them to arrive through
the normal migration process for another four or five years.
Meantime, they are concentrating their efforts on eradicating any
accidental introductions.
   The Africanized bees' venom is not more potent than that of
European honeybees that are common throughout the United States,
but they are more dangerous because they are likely to sting in
greater numbers due to their aggressive nature.
   They are hard to distinguish from domestic bees, although
slightly smaller.

   As election day draws near,
expressions of hostility between Washington and Panama's leaders
are on the rise.
   On Monday, Panama's military accused U.S. forces of spying on
its bases and the U.S. Army accused Panamanian forces of holding
some of its soldiers and their families at gunpoint while searching
their apartments.
   U.S. policy toward Panama has become a major issue in the
campaign for Sunday's presidential election.
   Washington has tried to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the
leader of Panama's armed forces and the power behind the
government, through economic sanctions and support of the political
opposition.
   A communique Monday from Lt. Col. Aristides Hassan, an officer
in the Panamanian Defense Forces, said the U.S. Southern Command
had been told to ``abstain from snooping in a suspicious and covert
manner around military installations of the Defense Forces of
Panama.''
   This activity, the communique added, ``constitutes a violation
of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties.''
   The treaties, signed in 1977, regulate relations between the two
countries and their militaries until Dec. 31, 1999, when the Panama
Canal is to be transferred to Panamanian control.
   Maj. Edgardo Lopez, spokesman for the Defense Forces, said U.S.
jets ``consistently make treetop-level flights over areas around
military installations.''
   ``They also send people dressed as civilians in rental cars with
cameras to watch military bases, and they have set up electronic
surveillance just off the coast,'' he said.
   The Southern Command denied all the charges.
   ``All flights out of U.S. military installations have flight
plans filed. Any complaints by the Panamanian Defense Forces are
investigated, and so far we have not found any allegation to be
true,'' said a Southern Command spokesman on condition of anonymity.
   He added that several weeks ago the Panamanians arrested a U.S.
officer who was birdwatching with a camera and field glasses near a
military installation. The officer, who was new to Panama, was
released after a short detention, the spokesman said.
   For its part, the Southern Command complained Monday that
Panamanian security forces had entered apartments of several U.S.
service members and held them at gunpoint while saying they were
searching for weapons.
   The Command, in a communique, said Panamanian forces surrounded
the building in a Panama City suburb on Saturday, cut telephone
lines, and forcibly entered the apartments. It said Panamanians
live in the building too, but only units of U.S. personnel and
their families were searched.
   No one was reported injured or arrested in the incident.
   Panamanian police declined comment.
   They have been carrying out searches recently for what they call
``subversives.'' On April 6, a U.S. citizen was arrested and
accused of running a clandestine radio station broadcasting
anti-government messages.
   In the election, the government is backing Carlos Duque, a close
associate of Noriega. An opposition coalition is backing Guillermo
Endara.
   Noriega has been indicted in the United States on drug charges.

<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Andres Rodriguez, the apparent
winner of his country's presidential election, is a career officer
with a populist touch.
   Rodriguez, 65, ran Monday as the candidate for the Colorados,
the powerful and well-organized party that has ruled this
semitropical, landlocked nation since 1947.
   Party affiliation aside, Rodriguez won wide popular support for
leading the Feb. 3 coup that toppled Gen. Alfredo Stroessner,
ending his 34 years of autocratic rule.
   The stocky, black-haired general named himself acting president
and, to the surprise of many Paraguayans, called for general
elections, accepted the Colorado candidacy and campaigned for
democracy and human rights.
   ``The man seems to have become the latter-day saint of
democracy,'' said Fernando Vera, presidential candidate of the
opposition Revolutionary Febrerista Party.
   Rodriguez further surprised his countrymen by legalizing eight
political parties banned under Stroessner, approving an extra
five-week voter registration period to allow opposition parties
time to sign up members and attending 21 political rallies.
   His chief rival, former exile Domingo Laino, reminded
Paraguayans, however, that the general served from 1961 to 1989 as
head of the Asuncion-based 1st Army Corps and was Stroessner's
close aide.
   Rodriguez said he collaborated with the regime out of
``discipline and obedience'' as a military officer.
   The Rev. Ismael Rolon, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Asuncion
and a frequent critic of Stroessner, said it was too early to
assess Rodriguez's ability to govern. But, he added, ``In the few
contacts we have had he seems to be a man of good intentions.''
   Born into a rural farm family, Rodriguez entered the army as a
cadet at age 18 and quickly earned the nickname ``Tiger'' for his
perseverance and willingness to fight to achieve goals.
   Reports published abroad have suggested Rodriguez may have been
involved in narcotics trafficking. He emphatically denies the
charge.
   Other reports have suggested the general's luxurious home in
Asuncion and his wealth are due to involvement in contraband and
questionable business associations.
   ``He is a wealthy man, a very wealthy man, one of the richest
men in the country, maybe the richest,'' said a foreign diplomat
who spoke on condition of anonymity. The diplomat noted that
Rodriguez owns the country's largest foreign exchange house, an
aircraft importing firm and has huge cattle and land holdings as
well as part ownership of a flour mill and brewery.
   ``They say he has an exchange house, but that is because the
owners are his friends,'' said Blas N. Riquelme, a businessman who
says he has known Rodriguez for nearly 26 years.
   ``He always has helped businessmen out and so people say he is a
partner in this or that,'' Riquelme said. ``But there is no proof
nor will there ever be any because he is a simple working man who
has earned his wealth honestly.''
   During the campaign, Rodriguez often cited his humble origins
and delighted supporters with spontaneous talks in Guarani, the
native Indian language spoken by most Paraguayans.
   ``He knows the psychology of the Paraguayan people much better
than Stroessner, who always was formal,'' said Roman Catholic
Bishop Mario Melanio Medina, a human rights leader.
   Rodriguez, unlike Stroessner, included his family in the
political campaign and reportedly consulted closely with his wife
Nelly and three daughters after speeches. He relaxed by playing
with his 10 nieces and nephews.
   Rodriguez plays tennis, sometimes with U.S. Ambassador Timothy
Towell, and likes to ride horses.

   A federal judge has ordered immigration
officials to stop deporting hundreds of Salvadorans from a Texas
detention center.
   U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon said the aliens were denied
a chance to seek political asylum.
   Kenyon ruled that the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service violated his previous order to provide help to Salvadorans
at the Port Isabel Service Processing Center.
   ``Out of a group of 67 Salvadorans deported from Port Isabel on
April 20, none was represented by counsel at their deportation
hearings,'' he said in his preliminary injunction issued Friday and
made public Monday. ``The court finds it difficult to believe that
each of these individuals learned of and knowingly and effectively
waived his or her right to counsel.''
   Kenyon also ordered the INS to hold group presentations advising
the detention center inmates of their rights.
   Last month, an attorney for the Los Angeles-based Central
American Refugee Center sought an order requiring that legal
counsel be provided the immigrants.
   Activists had argued that a stepped-up enforcement program had
led to the detention of thousands of people at Port Isabel, and
that many faced deportation hearings without legally-required
access to a lawyer.
   Kenyon's order remains in effect pending a May 30 hearing.

<HEAD>Vice President Meets With Singapore Leaders</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle arrived here today
for a one-day visit intended to reinforce the ties between the
United States and this island nation.
   Quayle paid a courtesy call on President Wee Kim Wee, whose job
is primarily ceremonial, before trying to squeeze in a round of
golf.
   Later in the day, the vice president was to see Prime Minister
Lee Kuan Yew, political leader of the tiny nation since it achieved
independence in 1965.
   High on the agenda were issues of trade and defense as well as
the future of neighboring Cambodia after the Vietnamese occupation
troops leave this fall.
   Singapore is a close U.S. ally although tensions developed in
the relationship last year after the expulsion of an American
diplomat who was accused by the Singapore government of meddling in
internal politics. In the past, Washington has raised questions
about the government's detention of its political opponents.
   Earlier, before leaving Jakarta, Indonesia, Quayle told
reporters he ``re-established a strong friendship'' with Indonesian
President Suharto.
   Quayle praised Indonesia's economic growth. He also brought up
the subject of human rights _ which he said he talks about
``wherever I go, unrequested'' _ although he did not directly
criticize the Suharto government on the issue.
   Some members of Congress had asked Quayle to find out the status
of up to 400 political prisoners believed to be held in Indonesia.
   On Monday, Quayle said he met with three human rights activists
in Indonesia and discussed legislation pending in Congress that
would tie U.S. aid levels to a country's human rights stance.
Quayle said he ``rejected that categorically'' on grounds the
legislation was a ``dumb idea.''
   Also while in Indonesia, Quayle repeated his support for
Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk, but added that
a meeting between the two brought no changes in U.S. policy toward
that country.
   Sihanouk was visiting Indonesia along with the leaders of two
other factions hopeful of running Cambodia after the promised
Vietnamese withdrawal.
   The fourth group vying for control in Cambodia is the Khmer
Rouge, a Chinese-backed organization that was responsible for
killing as many as 1.5 million Cambodians from 1975 to 1979. Quayle
and other U.S. officials have said they will not tolerate a
Cambodian government dominated by the Khmer Rouge.
   Cambodia's Vietnamese-installed government has changed the
country's name and flag, and invited Sihanouk to return home and
help rule. Sihanouk welcomed the concessions, saying, ``We are
going to make progress on the way toward a settlement.''
   Quayle has said the United States is considering giving military
aid to Sihanouk and possibly the other non-communist Cambodian
faction, headed by Son Sann. But he said such aid did not come up
in his discussions with Sihanouk.
   On Wednesday, Quayle flies to Thailand for two days and will
visit a refugee camp where Cambodians live along the Thai border.
He returns to the United States on Friday and will stop in Alaska
to monitor the cleanup efforts following the March 24 Exxon Valdez
oil spill in Prince William Sound.

   Louisiana would lose at least five
medical institutions and some universities under a budget proposal
drawn up after voters rejected Gov. Buddy Roemer's tax plan, a top
budget official says.
   More closures will be disclosed in the next two weeks,
Commissioner of Administration Dennis Stine said Monday.
   On Saturday, voters rejected Roemer's tax revision plan that
would have offset much of a projected deficit of abut $700 million
for the new fiscal year beginning July 1.
   ``The cuts will be deeper than I wanted, deeper than common
sense, but we will not do business as usual,'' Roemer said Monday.
   The governor was referring to the projecting oil prices high
enough to balance the budget on paper, a routine practice before he
took office in March 1988. Roemer has blamed such practices for
building up an accumulated $900 million deficit that the state
covered with a bond issue last year.
   Each increase of $1 a barrel in the price of oil yields around
$28 million a year in extra state tax revenue.
   Roemer said the state realistically could increase the
projection from $15 to $17 per barrel because the price of
Louisiana oil is about $18, ``but you're only talking about $60
million if we do that.''
   Having oil companies and other businesses pay a big share of
state revenues dates back to the days of populist Gov. Huey Long in
the 1920s and 1930s. Roemer's plan would have shifted the tax
burden away from big business, put more of a load on individuals
through the income tax and cut sales taxes.
   Stine, who heads the day-to-day operations of government, said
the state must lay off a minimum of 3,000 employees. That would be
in addition to 4,100 jobs that had been planned to go through
attrition and layoffs even if the tax package had passed, he said.
   Stine's office issued a report detailing $74.5 million in
proposed cuts through the elimination of state programs.
   The budget calls for 33 of the state's 41 vocational-trade
schools to be shut down, said Stine.
   Some universities must be closed or a majority of them changed
from four-year institutions to two-year community colleges, he
said. The state now has 18 public universities.
   ``We could end up with six four-year universities,'' said Stine.
   With higher education contributing $113 million to the deficit,
``I think you can expect some closures,'' said Stine. ``We're not
ready to name them.''
   Two of the state's eight charity hospitals must be closed, Stine
said. Medicaid patients would be transferred to private hospitals
and indigents without Medicaid would be transferred to other
charity hospitals, he said.
   Also slated for closure is a New Orleans nursing home for older
handicapped patients and homes in Columbia and Leesville for
physically handicapped children. Those patients would be
transferred to other facilities, Stine said.
   Stine's report also said another $74.5 million would be saved by
eliminating a 7 percent pay raise planned this fall for teachers,
while $14.3 million would be garnered by denying state employees
merit pay hikes.
   ``All options are on the table,'' said Stine. ``We are trying to
do the best we can within the means available.''

<HEAD>Mother Who Used Cocaine Before Giving Birth Is Guilty Of Abuse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKFORD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who used cocaine hours before
giving birth was convicted of prenatal child abuse and neglect by a
judge who compared the drug use to giving a baby razor blades to
play with in the crib.
   ``This is the first case of this kind to come before this
court,'' Juvenile Court Judge Frederick J. Kapala said Monday in
finding the mother guilty.
   The child was put in the care of social workers pending a May 25
hearing.
   A key element in the case involved the question of whether
Illinois law covers fetal rights, including the possibility of
future health damage to so-called cocaine babies.
   The mother's attorney, Alberto F. Altamore, said the Illinois
juvenile court act defines abuse and neglect of minors, but ``does
not address the issue of fetus abuse.''
   Kapala said Altamore raised a ``legitimate argument'' because
state child abuse laws only speak of ``minors under the age of 21.''
   But he said: ``I have to take a stand one way or the other on
the issue'' of fetus rights.
   ``We can expect to see a growing body of law on this subject,''
he said.
   Altamore said the case could open the door to child abuse and
neglect charges being filed against pregnant women who drink
alcohol or smoke.
   But Kapala said there's a difference with cocaine, since it's
illegal.
   The baby, born three months ago, has shown no signs of addiction
or serious health problems associated with cocaine babies,
according to testimony.
   Assistant State's Attorney Gary Golian said medical studies
suggest cocaine babies may be subject to serious health problems
far into the future.
   The judge said effects of the cocaine on the baby ``may not
appear for years.''
   But ``it's the same as if a mother gave a child a pack of razor
blades to play with in the crib,'' he said. ``The child might drop
the blades out of the crib and not get hurt, but the exposure to
danger is the same.''
   Kapala delayed a decision on whether the child eventually can be
returned to the mother. She has been participating in a drug
treatment program.
   Because it is a juvenile case, neither the woman's name was not
released.

<HEAD>Kids Nationwide Tune In To $7 Million Science Project</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A popular robot was relegated to the sidelines,
but thousands of excited schoolchildren still watched in awe as a
$7 million science project lit up screens nationwide, whisking
viewers to the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea.
   The satellite-relayed view from a camera-equipped submersible
robot Monday was the first of two weeks of live broadcasts to an
expected 250,000 students at 13 museums from British Columbia to
Florida.
   The project suffered a temporary setback last week when Jason,
the 7-foot long robot whose older brother first explored the sunken
Titanic, sank among the ruins of an ancient Roman trading ship off
the coast of Italy.
   The cable used to lower the million-dollar submersible and its
mobile garage, Argo, snapped and the pair plunged 2,100 feet to the
soft, silty ocean floor.
   The robot was recovered apparently undamaged Saturday, but sat
out the first 40-minute broadcast Monday.
   The biggest laugh of the morning came when Kenneth, a grade
school student from Memphis, Tenn., had a chance to question Dr.
Robert Ballard, the head of the expedition.
   ``Is Jason all right?'' he asked, his voice crackling over a
3,000-mile connection to the support ship, Star Hercules.
   ``Jason is fine,'' Ballard told his student audience via the
two-way hookup. ``His pride's a little hurt, but luckily none of
his instrumentation is.''
   Ballard sought to reassure the students, who have through weeks
of lessons and classroom discussion developed an affection for the
little propeller-driven robot explorer.
   Jason can be remotely driven in and around underwater objects.
Its replacement Monday, Medea, is merely a sophisticated camera
platform that is towed to the ocean floor.
   Broadcasting from his control center on the bridge, Ballard took
questions from students at three of the 13 participating museums,
narrated live footage of underwater volcanoes and set the stage for
pre-prepared films on satellite technology and the ancient Greek
voyager Jason, for whom the 20th century robot was named.
   For some of the kids, the show wasn't quite the same without its
star.
   ``The teachers said it was going to be so real that it would
seem like the water could come right off the screen,'' said
10-year-old Almas Rathod of the Walter J. Paton School in
Shrewsbury, Mass. ``It wasn't like that.''
   But classmate Barry Lyall said the field trip had lived up to
his expectations.
   ``It's much more interesting than hearing about it in a
classroom,'' the 9-year-old native of Scotland said. ``It was the
next best thing to being there.''
   The project, whose sponsors include Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., the National
Geographic Society and Electronic Data Systems, was scheduled to
move 120 miles southwest next week, where it will broadcast from
the site of a 2,000-year-old Roman trading ship.
   The participating museums are The Boston Museum of Science; the
Museum of Natural History in Denver; the Detroit Science Center;
Discovery Place in Charlotte, N.C.; the Museum of Science and
Industry in Chicago; The Science Place in Dallas; Memphis (Tenn.)
Pink Palace Museum; The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia; the
Rochester (N.Y.) Museum and Science Center; Mote Marine Laboratory
in Sarasota, Fla.; National Geographic Society Grosvenor Auditorium
in Washington and Dallas; and the Royal British Columbia Museum in
Victoria, British Columbia.

<HEAD>Government Sets Reward in Search for Anti-Apartheid Activist's Killer</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police offered a $4,000 reward
today for information about the killing of a prominent white
anti-apartheid activist and the country's law and order minister
said he was horrified by the murder.
   Expressions of sorrow and outrage over the death of university
professor David Webster came from both blacks and whites, and from
anti-apartheid, academic, labor and student groups across South
Africa.
   Max Coleman, who worked with Webster in several organizations
opposed to race-segregation, told hundreds of mourners Monday night
at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, ``There is
only one group that stood to gain from this act: those who are
dedicated to perpetuating the brutal and vicious system that David
dedicated his life to opposing.''
   White musician Johnny Clegg, whose Zulu-style music has gained
international acceptance despite a cultural boycott against South
Africa, sent a message of support to the meeting from Los Angeles.
   Webster, 44, an anthropology lecturer at Witwatersrand, was shot
to death outside his Johannesburg home Monday by an assailant
firing from a passing car.
   Colleagues said they had no doubt he was killed because of his
political activities. He was a prominent opponent of detention
without trial.
   Several dozen black activists have been murdered in recent
years. Many white activists have received anonymous threats or have
been harassed by vandals, but few have been attacked.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said in a statement: ``I
want to make it clear on behalf of the government that the murder
is strongly condemned and that no stone will be left unturned to
apprehend those responsible.''
   Tributes to Webster came from a wide range of organizations
opposed broadly to apartheid and specifically to various policies
of the white-led government. The groups assist families of
detainees, keep records of alleged human rights abuses, object to
military conscription and contest eviction of blacks from rented
houses.
   A spokesman for the Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference
said Webster's life ``was one of great respect for the human
dignity of all people.''
   Jay Naidoo, general secretary of the Congress of South African
Trade Unions, said the killing ``is a blow to our struggle but it
will only strengthen our determination to uproot and destroy
apartheid evils.''
   The Detainees Parents Support Committee, banned by the
government, said Webster became an authority on forms of state
repression and also patterns of informal repression. ``His work
went a long way to exposing those acting under the cover of
darkness,'' a statement said.
   Under apartheid, the country's 28 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   Nine anti-abortion activists have
been ordered to pay more than $800,000 in damages to a doctor who
said he and his family suffered mental anguish because of
demonstrations outside their home.
   ``I believe in the right to picket, and I am an advocate of the
First Amendment to the Constitution,'' Dr. Eduardo Aquino said
after Monday's 10-2 jury verdict. ``But anyone who abuses those
rights should be penalized.''
   Cliff Zarsky, one of two lawyers who represented the nine
defendants without a fee, said he will move for a new trial, and if
that fails, he will appeal the verdict.
   Jurors ruled that the peaceful protests caused mental anguish to
Aquino, his wife, Mercedes, and their four children.
   The damages included $140,000 in past and future suffering of
the couple and $170,000 in past and future suffering of the four
children. A half million dollars in punitive damages was awarded
for gross negligence in picketing the family home.
   State District Judge Jack Hunter scheduled a hearing today on
whether to issue a permanent injunction against future picketing by
the defendants.
   ``I feel my family will be left alone now,'' Aquino said. His
wife said she was ``very much relieved'' as she wiped away tears.
   The trial ended at a time when the U.S. Supreme Court is
considering a case that could cause it to reconsider its 1973
ruling, Roe vs. Wade, that women have a constitutional right to end
their pregnancies.
   The question before the Supreme Court is a dispute over a
Missouri law that limits abortions in that state.
   Aquino said he has been performing abortions since 1978 and
anti-abortionists had picketed his office since 1982. They began
picketing at his home in March 1988, the month he filed his lawsuit.
   He testified that his wife suffered from depression and ulcers,
that one son had been institutionalized and that his three
school-age children suffered academically after the picketing began
at his home.

<HEAD>Skinhead Pleads Guilty To Murder In Beating Death Of Black Man</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A skinhead has pleaded guilty to murder in
the slaying of a black man whose head was struck so hard with a
baseball bat that the bat split.
   Kenneth M. Mieske, 23, who went by the nicknames ``Ken Death''
and ``Batman,'' entered the plea Monday in the slaying of Mulugeta
Seraw, 27, an Ethiopian national. Mieske said he and others killed
Seraw on Nov. 13 ``because of his race.''
   Mieske also pleaded no contest to racial intimidation in the
non-fatal stabbing of a black security guard at a supermarket last
September.
   Prosecutors plan to seek a life sentence with a mandatory
minimum term of 20 years on the murder conviction, according to a
plea agreement between Mieske and the Multnomah County District
Attorney's office. Mieske agreed not to challenge the sentence.
   ``This sends a very strong message to anyone who wants to commit
racist crimes in Portland, Oregon, and we hope that never happens
again,'' said Deputy District Attorney Norman W. Frink Jr. ``I
don't think we could have gotten anything better if we'd gone to
trial.''
   Multnomah County Circuit Judge Philip T. Abraham set sentencing
for June 5. Mieske was to have gone to trial May 8.
   His lawyer, Randy Vogt, said Mieske agreed to plead guilty
partly because federal authorities were threatening to prosecute
him for civil rights offenses that could have resulted in a life
sentence with no parole.
   Mieske could have been prosecuted in federal court even if he'd
gone to trial and been convicted on the state charges, Vogt said.
Under the plea agreement, federal authorities won't prosecute
Mieske if he accepts the sentencing recommendation, the attorney
said.
   Kyle H. Brewster, 19, and Steven R. Strasser, 20, are still
awaiting trial in Seraw's death. They are charged with murder,
assault and racial intimidation.
   Seraw was beaten to death outside his southeast Portland
apartment after two fellow Ethiopians brought him home from a party.
   According to police testimony, Mieske hit Seraw in the back of
the head with a baseball bat three times, fracturing Seraw's skull
and splitting the bat.
   Mieske wore his hair short in the skinhead style. Some, but not
all, skinheads are racists.
   Ron Herndon, a community leader who attended Monday's hearing on
behalf of Seraw's family, called the plea bargain fair, but was
uncertain whether it would help deter racist violence by ``sick
people.''
   ``I can't predict insanity,'' Herndon said.

<HEAD>Opening Arguments in Giant Clam Caper</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Seven people poached nearly $2 million worth of
giant clams by underreporting harvests and evading state fisheries
agents, a prosecutor claimed.
   In opening statements Monday, Assistant prosecutor Marilyn
Brenneman said the ``defendants routinely took thousands of pounds
of state resources'' from Puget Sound without paying for them.
   But an attorney for one of the defendants said the trial was the
result of a bitter feud between those who dominated the geoduck
clam industry and resentful divers recruited by the state to build
its case.
   ``You're going to hear two very different stories on this
industry,'' Richard Hansen said.
   Opening arguments were expected to resume today.
   The so-called Clamscam trial, one of the biggest white-collar
crime cases in the state's history, centers on the evolution of the
geoduck industry, which did not exist until 1970.
   The geoduck, pronounced ``gooey-duck'' after an Indian word for
``dig deep,'' has a long, sinuous neck, an oblong shell up to six
inches long and weighs as much as 10 pounds.
   The mollusk is harvested in Washington and British Columbia,
much of it for export to Japan where its flesh can bring $12 a
pound.
   The defendants were officers, suppliers and associates of the
now-defunct Washington King Clam Inc. and related companies. They
are accused of stealing at least $1.8 million worth of clams from
state-managed clam beds.
   Ms. Brenneman said testimony would show that Brian D. Hodgson,
52, the company's co-owner, in the early 1970s conspired to
underreport the amount of clams harvested to state Department of
Fisheries and Department of Natural Resources officials.
   Also charged was Carol K. Kondo, 58, who came to the United
States from Japan in the 1950s and was a pioneer in the harvesting
of geoducks along with Hodgson. The two were the first to discover
a market in Japan after a trip there in 1975.
   Besides falsifying harvest figures, Brenneman said, Hodgson
directed divers to go outside legal clamming areas for the
desirable white-necked clams and to share information on how to
evade authorities.
   Hansen, an attorney for Hodgson, told jurors the 1.2 million
pounds of clams allegedly stolen over a span of 10 years actually
was just 5.1 percent of the entitled harvest within that time.
   He also said the divers the state will call to testify for the
most part were angry with the pay given them by Hodgson, and that
the divers had done the poaching.
   Also charged were Kondo's daugher, Cindy Rommel, 28; Mark E.
Pearce, 37, a former employee of King Clam; fisherman Richard
Myers; bookkeeper Ralph Williams; and Roger Hondle, who was aboard
Myers' boat when it was seized in 1986.
   All seven defendants were charged with first-degree theft and
conspiracy to commit trafficking of stolen property.

<HEAD>Former Northrop Engineer Pleads Guilty to Falsifying Tests For Jet
Part</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Northrop Corp. engineer pleaded
guilty to falsifying tests for parts installed in Marine Corps
Harrier jets.
   Howard Hyde, chief engineer for Northrop's Western services
department in El Monte, changed his plea Monday from innocent to
guilty in a hearing before U.S. District Judge Pamela Rymer.
   ``The government has overwhelming evidence against Mr. Hyde and
the rest of the individuals named in the indictment,'' Hyde's
attorney, Marshall Schulman, said after the hearing. ``He is very
contrite and he feels bad about the whole situation, and he is
accepting his responsibility.''
   Northrop and five current or former employees were named April
11 in a 167-count indictment accusing them of falsifying tests for
stabilizers for the jets and guidance components for nuclear-tipped
cruise missiles.
   Hyde, named only in counts involving the jet, is expected to
testify against other indicted officials, Schulman said.
   Hyde, 48, of Yorba Linda, faces as much as 15 years in prison
and a $750,000 fine at his sentencing Aug. 21. He is free on bail.
   The Harrier jet, built by McDonnell Douglas Corp., is an unusual
fighter-bomber that can take off and land vertically. It is
designed to carry nuclear and conventional payloads.
   The Navy is conducting studies to determine whether the planes
should be fitted with new stabilizers.

   Nazi Holocaust survivor Leah Zonershein choked
back tears today as she read aloud the names of her parents, Chaim
and Hannah, who perished in a World War II concentration camp.
   She was one of hundreds of people who took part in memorials
throughout the country at which names of the 6 million Jewish
victims were being read on Israel's national day of mourning for
the Holocaust.
   Sirens sounded at 10 a.m. throughout the country. Thousands of
Israelis paid tribute by halting traffic or stopping in their
tracks and bowing their heads for the two-minute wail of the sirens.
   Polish-born Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who lost family in
the Holocaust, was expected to read names later today at Parliament
in keeping with this year's theme of personal remembrance.
   Names also were read aloud at army bases, schools and following
prayers at Judaism's holiest shrine, the Western Wall, the remnant
of the ancient Jewish temple in Jerusalem's walled Old City.
   The Dutch-born Mrs. Zonershein, 62, said the ceremony at
Parliament helped ease memories of her ordeal. ``I have found that
talking about it helps,'' she said.
   Her sister, Judith Ilan, stood at her side at the microphone but
could not speak. ``I still am unable to let it all out,'' Mrs. Ilan
said afterward.
   The sisters spent 15 months in the Bergen-Belsen concentration
camp in occupied Poland, where their parents died. The women were
freed by Soviet troops in April 1945 after a forced ``death march''
by Nazi soldiers who fled the Allied invasion.
   ``I don't know how we went on to live normal lives after what
happened. Somehow life wins out over everything,'' said Mrs.
Zonershein, a retired teacher.
   Several elderly survivors wept as they pronounced names of
brothers, sisters and cousins who died.
   Difficult as it was, most survivors agreed the readings were an
effective way to keep the memories alive for young Israelis, now
two generations removed from the Holocaust.
   ``Holocaust day became a routine thing here. The number, 6
million, says nothing to most people, but name after name after
name, that gets the message across,'' Mrs. Zonershein said.
   In Jerusalem's outdoor Ben Yehuda shopping mall, hundreds of
vendors and shoppers paused to bow their heads in tribute when the
siren rang out for Holocaust Martyrs and Heroes Rememberance Day.
   They included Orthodox Jews who read from the Torah and a
Palestinian in an Arab keffiyeh headdress who bowed his head in
silence.
   To many Israelis, the Holocaust has become a symbol of Jewish
suffering that also reflects their security fears amid continued
Arab enmity.
   ``This is a very important show of respect and an act of
remembering because it could happen again,'' Devora Feinstein, 17,
said after the collective silence.
   Another name-reader at Parliament was Lithuanian-born Parliament
speaker Dov Shilansky, a survivor of Dachau concentration camp in
Germany, who lost aunts, uncles and grandparents to the Nazis.
   ``Now we have our own Jewish state, with our own parliament and
I am speaker as a remnant of your flesh,'' Shilansky said in a
brief speech after laying a wreath of flowers by a stand of
memorial torches.
   Shilansky criticized the construction of a Roman Catholic
convent just outside the former Auschwitz death camp.
   ``In Auschwitz in Poland they have built a kind of monument to
your graves, a Carmelite convent with a big cross.''
   The church agreed to move the convent in 1987, but the agreement
has not been implemented.
   Holocaust day is timed by law in Israel to fall half way between
the start of a 1943 Jewish uprising against German troops in
Warsaw, Poland and Israeli Independence Day, which this year is on
May 10.

   Tens of thousands of Solidarity supporters
shouted ``Down with communism!'' and turned a May Day march into a
rally for union-backed candidates in the coming National Assembly
elections.
   ``We have been walking to this rally for eight years, but we
finally made it,'' said Maciej Jankowski, a Solidarity activist
from Warsaw University. ``Today has shown how many we are, but we
can't just be strong on holidays.''
   Like the Solidarity supporters reveling in their movement's
reinstatement after a seven-year ban and government concessions
including a promise of free elections, thousands of workers around
the world gathered Monday on the international labor day to
celebrate gains or demonstrate for change.
   The Soviet Union held a traditional parade through Red Square,
and China's leaders used speeches and editorials to urge social
stablility in the face of student protests for democratic reforms.
   But in South Korea, rallies became riots. Police also clashed
with demonstrators in two Polish cities as well as in Turkey, the
Philippines and Czechoslovakia.
   Up to 100,000 union supporters filled a field at the foot of
Warsaw's Old Town to hear city Solidarity leader Zbigniew Bujak
present the union movement's candidates for the June elections to
the Sejm, the lower house of parliament, and the Senate.
   Popular actor Andrzej Lapicki, a Sejm candidate, drew a roar of
approval when he said: ``I am sure in voting for me, you are voting
for Solidarity.''
   But, he added, ``If you don't vote out of laziness, you are
making the Communists happy.''
   Authorities scaled back official celebrations.
   Communist Party leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski told about
20,000 loyalists gathered at Victory Square that socialism was
returning to its ``purest values'' thanks to party-backed reforms.
   Party officials also organized meetings at cafes in Warsaw where
citizens could discuss politics and the battered economy with
government officials.
   Before the Solidarity rally, about 30,000 people sang and
chanted as they marched through Warsaw to the waves and smiles of
onlookers who gathered in windows and on balconies.
   Solidarity, banned after the martial-law crackdown in December
1981, was legalized April 5 under an agreement in which authorities
agreed to at least partially share power with the opposition in the
first such arrangement in the Soviet bloc.
   In at least two cities, police used force to break up rallies by
militant Solidarity splinter groups. Police attacked protesters in
the Baltic port of Gdansk and used tear gas and clubs against
stone-throwing youths in the southern city of Wroclaw, activists
said.
   Riot police in South Korea fired tear gas in a battle with about
5,000 striking workers in Masan and nearby Changwon after
protesters tried to stage a May Day rally, police said. About 200
workers were arrested.
   In the Philippines, police swung truncheons and fired tear gas
to break up crowds marching to the U.S. Embassy in Manila after a
rally in which union leaders threatened a nationwide strike to
press for a higher minimum wage.
   In Czechoslovakia, at least 76 people were arrested for taking
part in anti-government protests during the official May Day parade
in Prague.
   Reporter Misha Glenny of the British Broadcasting Corp. said he
was punched in the face and held for five hours as he recorded an
arrest in Prague. Britain's Foreign Office said it would protest to
Czechoslovakia.
   In the Soviet Union, an activist in the Soviet republic of
Armenia said residents in the capital, Yerevan, defied a ban and
held a large, peaceful rally. May Day celebrations were banned in
Yerevan and Tbilisi, capital of Soviet Georgia, because of recent
pro-independence unrest in the cities.
   The mood was festive in Moscow under sunny skies during the
traditional May Day parade through Red Square. Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other officials stood atop Lenin's tomb as
thousands of marchers waved colorful banners, pushed floats and
floated balloons.
   In Turkey, an 18-year-old man died of a gunshot wound to the
head and 35 people were injured, including seven by gunfire, in
battles with security forces during outlawed marches in Istanbul,
the Anatolia news agency reported. Officials banned the holiday
because they said it was a Marxist tradition.
   The slain man, Mehmet Ali Dalci, died today and had been in a
coma since suffering the gunshot wound Monday, said Dr. Muhittin
Okumus, director of Istanbul's Taksim Hospital.
   In West Berlin, police used water cannon, tear gas and
truncheons against at least 2,000 protesters who hurled fire bombs,
looted stores and smashed windows in violent skirmishes.
   In communist East Berlin, at least five dissidents were arrested
for staging demonstrations alongside official celebrations,
opposition sources said.
   More than 50,000 people demonstrated in six cities in Honduras
and burned U.S. flags to protest the American military presence in
the country and Washington's support for the Nicaraguan rebels.

The agreement</HEAD>

   The leader of a longshoremen's union says his
members might stop unloading ships from drug-producing countries,
as members of the cargo industry work out a plan to fight
trafficking in illegal drugs.
   ``We'd rather lose wages than lose our children,'' John Bowers,
president of the International Longshoreman's Association, said
Monday.
   Bowers' statement came Monday as U.S. Customs Commissioner
William von Raab announced a proposed agreement by Customs, air
lines and sea carriers and unions to combat drug trafficking. None
of the carriers had signed the agreement Monday.
   ``This is the first time that industry, labor and government
have joined together to put together a plan to combat drug
smuggling,'' von Raab said before a meeting with representatives of
about 100 air and sea carriers where the plan was outlined.
   The agreement _ still in draft form _ calls for carriers to
impose strict security standards at foreign and domestic docks,
terminals and facilities and aboard their planes and ships.
   Von Raab said on ``CBS This Morning'' today that ``one thing
we've started to do very effectively is to deal with the pilots
that use small airplanes and the guys that use small speedboats (to
smuggle drugs).''
   ``They're really losing that war, as it were, so the theater of
war is shifting to commercial cargo,'' he added. ``That will be the
last theater of this war. It'll be a tough one, but with the help
of the shipping companies, the airline companies and labor, all
together, we're going to win it. It's just going to take time.''
   The ILA's Bowers swore that his membership _ 110,000 from
``Maine to Texas, Puerto Rico and Canada'' _ would help out. ``I
told the commissioner we'll have 110,000 pairs of eyes out there
looking to help him,'' he said.
   He noted that the longshoremen had refused for 25 years to
unload cargo from the Soviet Union and recently paid $9 million in
fines because the union lost a Supreme Court decision over the
boycott.
   Bowers declined to say whether any country's cargo or ships
already had been targeted for a possible boycott or what criteria
the union would use to refuse to unload ships.
   Bowers assured the sea carriers' representatives that he would
make sure there would be swift and sure, if rough, justice for any
union member found helping drug traffickers.
   ``If we take him down there, you won't need a court for him,''
Bowers said. ``Anything with my people, I'll make sure they never
work on the waterfront again.''
   Some of the carriers' representatives wanted a tariff imposed
that would cover their costs for the new security measures the
agreement would demand so they would remain competitive with
carriers that don't participate.
   Lou Razzino, the Customs program manager for narcotics
interdiction in commercial cargo, said such a decision would have
to be made by Congress.
   As part of the agreement, Customs will provide security
training, surveys of foreign and domestic sites and help in
identifying potential smuggling opportunities. If a carrier is
found to be carrying illegal drugs, Customs will weigh the
company's degree of general compliance before deciding on a penalty.
   Under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, penalties for carrying
illegal drugs went up to $1,000 per ounce of heroin and cocaine and
$500 per ounce of marijuana. The act also authorized the seizure of
the carrier.
   ``If you help us prevent drugs from getting aboard your
conveyance, you'll have no problems with penalties and seizures,''
Razzino said.
   Von Raab estimated that 30 percent of the cocaine now entering
the country is coming in by shipping container, and said he
expected that to increase to 50 percent in the next two years and
up to 80 percent to 90 percent by 1992 because of a crackdown on
other forms of trafficking.

   Electricity flowed into Atlantis
today, beginning a new countdown toward a Thursday afternoon
blastoff after crews fixed fuel system problems that caused a
last-minute launch postponement.
   The shuttle is to carry into space five astronauts who are to
propel a robot spacecraft to explore the planet Venus.
   The countdown began on time at 8 a.m. when a test director
summoned the launch team to work stations.
   NASA said the new launch plan was ``optimistic,'' but officials
were confident enough to move ahead.
   Liftoff was scheduled for 1:48 p.m. Thursday, with the 64-minute
launch opportunity extending until 2:52 p.m.
   The countdown, which normally lasts more than three days, is
being compressed by 24 hours this time by eliminating some work
done in the first count that need not be repeated.
   The astronauts, who had returned to their training base in
Houston after the scrub, were to fly back here late today after a
practice session in a shuttle simulator.
   Commanding the mission is David Walker. The pilot is Ron Grabe
and the mission specialists are Mary Cleave, Mark Lee and Norman
Thagard. Lee is the only one who has not flown a previous shuttle
flight.
   Scientists monitoring the Magellan spacecraft in Atlantis' cargo
bay reported it was healthy. The astronauts are to release the $550
million probe toward Venus to map the planet's cloud-veiled surface.
   The two bad parts that forced Friday's postponement were a
hydrogen fuel pump that short-circuited and a 4-inch-diameter fuel
line that sprung a small leak. Small metal particles found in the
pump may have caused the short-circuit, the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration said.
   The speedy fashion in which the parts were replaced prompted the
agency to set a Thursday launch date. Officials had said Sunday
they did not expect to be able to try again before Friday.
   Warren Wiley, deputy director of engineering at the Kennedy
Space Center, credited the repair crew.
   ``This is a very dedicated team here,'' he said. ``When the
chips are down they really get out and hustle. They did a bang-up
job.''
   The delay meant a loss of valuable days in starting Magellan on
its voyage. Because of the shifting positions of Earth and Venus,
there is only a 32-day period when the spacecraft can be launched
toward Earth's sister planet.
   If the shuttle can't get off the ground by May 28, the mission
would have to be put off two years, at a cost of more than $100
million, until the two planets are again properly aligned.

   It still may be living in sin, but unrelated
people can live together throughout Denver after City Council
revoked a law that had caused years of controversy and forced some
to carry marriage certificates.
   The council late Monday voted 7-6 to abolish the law that had
covered more than half the city.
   ``There are no longer any zoning districts where two people
cannot live together,'' said Councilwoman Cathy Reynolds, who
worked to change the ordinance since she was first elected in 1975.
``I'm delighted.''
   Councilwoman Mary DeGroot also voted to abolish the law.
   ``Zoning, I believe, should be used to determine land use and
density but not relationships,'' she said.
   Supporters of the law argued that revoking it could hurt family
values.
   ``The family is the fundamental structure that preserves our
society,'' said Councilman Bill Roberts.
   The vote is a ``step toward destroying our city,'' said
Councilman Ted Hackworth. Councilman Bob Crider called the passage
``a sad day in the city of Denver.''
   The living-in-sin law had covered about 60 percent of the area
of Denver, which has a population of more than 500,000.
   Under the law, neither boarders nor unrelated people were
allowed to live in the same house in areas zoned R-0. In areas
zoned R-1, a homeowner was required to obtain a $20 boarder's
permit to cover a non-relative.
   ``After reviewing the sales prices and the square footage of the
homes, there did not appear to be a significant difference between
an R-1 and an R-0 in my district, '' DeGroot said.
   Cathy Donohue, another supporter of change on the council, said
the law forced people to carry their marriage certificates with
them, and zoning inspectors complained about having to count
toothbrushes in homes.
   Donohue said some neighborhood arguments turned nasty and people
were forced to move after being turned in to authorities.
   The penalty for violating the ordinance was $999 a day. People
had six months to appeal but when told they faced a fine for every
day of violation, most sold their houses, often at a considerable
loss because of Denver's soft housing market, Donohue said.
   Several churches turned out previously to oppose any change to
the law, but most opposition this time came from families and a
real estate agent, who sold houses based on the zoning restrictions.

<HEAD>State Radio Suggests Expanding Trade Ties With Soviet Bloc</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government should develop
trade relations with the Soviet bloc as a counter to punitive
economic sanctions imposed by Western countries, state radio said
today.
   The South African Broadcasting Corp. commentary also diverged
from previous government statements by depicting the Soviet Union's
presence in Southern Africa as legitimate and permanent.
   It was one of the most explicit expressions of a major new
development in South African foreign policy, triggered by the
diplomatic initiatives of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev's tactics have forced Pretoria to revise its
decades-old view of Moscow as an arch enemy orchestrating black
nationalist guerrillas in a ``total onslaught'' to overthrow South
Africa's white-dominated government.
   In recent months, the two countries have found a common interest
in seeking to keep an independence plan for Namibia on track. South
African officials also have been pleased by Soviet statements that
Moscow seeks peaceful change in South Africa.
   ``The Soviet Union appears to have accepted that South Africa is
the regional power in Southern Africa,'' the radio said. ``South
Africa, for her part, must accept that although Southern Africa is
not a traditional sphere of influence for the Soviet Union, she has
been allowed by other governments in the region to establish a
presence that is a permanent presence.''
   Because of this, the commentary said, ``a certain degree of
interaction is consequently inevitable and, in certain areas, could
be fruitful.''
   ``Trade relations with Eastern Bloc nations can be expanded
without South Africa diluting her firm and longstanding resistance
to the inhumanity of communism,'' it said. ``Diversified trading
relations are all the more important given the hostile action of
Western nations such as the United States in instituting economic
sanctions.''
   Last week, there was an official Soviet visit to South Africa
for the first time since the countries broke diplomatic ties in
1956. Soviet diplomat Viacheslav Ustinov came to Cape Town with
U.S., Angolan and Cuban officials to assess accords calling for
South Africa to end its rule of Namibia and Cuba to withdraw troops
from Angola.
   Ustinov emphasized that Moscow will not consider restoring
relations with Pretoria until it dismantles its policy of legal
race discrimination and grants political rights to the black
majority.
   The radio said: ``As a Christian nation, South Africa, in turn,
must condemn the oppression of religious and ethnic minorities
under the communist system ...
   ``This having been said,'' it added, ``there are certain
realities that have to be taken into account.''

<HEAD>Judge Rejects Bid For Retrial for Man Convicted of Killing Kitty

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge refused a new trial for the man
convicted of stabbing Kitty Genovese to death 25 years ago as her
neighbors reportedly ignored her screams for help.
   Winston Moseley, 54, is serving a 20-years-to-life sentence for
the 1964 murder. He sought a new trial on the ground that his trial
lawyer, Sidney Sparrow, had once represented Genovese.
   State Supreme Court Justice Charles Thomas rejected the appeal
Monday, saying a ``significant possibility of conflict of
interest'' had not been shown.
   Thomas noted that the fact that Sparrow represented both
Genovese and Moseley ``doesn't automatically result in a conflict
of interest.''
   In his appeal, which Queens District Attorney John Santucci
opposed, Moseley claimed he never knew that Sparrow had represented
Genovese on a bookmaking charge.
   But according to Thomas, Sparrow declared in his summation
before the jury: ``I knew Kitty Genovese and represented her for
years.''
   ``Neither the defendant nor the trial court thought it necessary
to pursue the issue at that time,'' Thomas said in his six-page
decision.
   Genovese, 28, was killed March 13, 1964 on a street in Queens,
in a case that became a nationwide symbol of urban fear and
indifference.

<HEAD>Cambodian Refugee Camp Shelled In Thailand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shells crashed into the largest
Cambodian refugee camp in Thailand today, the latest in a recent
surge in border assaults, Western relief officials said.
   Three rounds flew over camp known as Site 2, striking a road,
and two shells landed in the camp 30 minutes later, said Patrick
Van de Velde, deputy director of the U.N. Border Relief Operation.
No casualties were reported.
   Van De Velde said that in the past 10 days, 15 shells or rockets
have landed in or around Site 2. Three seriously wounded refugees
were sent to the hospital of the International Committee of the Red
Cross, a Red Cross official said.
   ``We are concerned by the repeated instances of shelling of
civilian encampments and appeal to concerned parties to refrain
from harming innocent civilians,'' Van de Velde said.
   Site 2 houses about 180,000 refugees. It is in Prachinburi
province, near the border with Cambodia, and about 50 miles north
of the Thai border town of Aranyaprathet.
   The camp is controlled by the Khmer People's National Liberation
Front, one of three guerrilla groups fighting the forces of Vietnam
and of the government it installed in Cambodia after invading in
late 1978.
   It is not clear who is responsible for the recent shellings,
which have forced the temporary evacuation of all but the most
essential relief personnel.
   ``Whoever is doing the shelling, the aim is clear. They want to
disrupt the relief services, they want to disrupt normal life in
the camp,'' said the Red Cross official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Some officials theorized the pro-Vietnamese Cambodian forces
were shelling the camp to pressure the refugees to abandon the
resistance and return to Cambodia. Others theorized that the
guerrillas were doing it to convince the world they needed more
weapons to defend the camp.
   In the past, shellings of the border camps also have escalated
as the two sides maneuvered diplomatically. Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, leader of the resistance coalition, has been holding
talks in Indonesia this week with Hun Sen, premier of Cambodia.
   Vietnam has said it will withdraw its forces by the end of
September. Sihanouk's three-party resistance coalition includes the
Khmer Rouge, which was blamed for killing hundreds of thousands of
people when it ruled Cambodia from 1975 until Vietnam's invasion.

   House Speaker Jim Wright's use of the
Congressional Record to plug a home video product made by his
wife's employer follows a long Capitol Hill tradition: Just about
anything can be printed, and is, at taxpayers' expense.
   For more than 100 years the Congressional Record has provided an
uncritical compilation of remarks said _ and unsaid _ by members of
Congress.
   It is printed five days a week, every week, and runs 200 or so
pages on average. It costs $18 million a year, and is produced by
more than 500 government printers working through the night.
   ``It's like producing the Sunday New York Times, five times a
week,'' said Duane Nystrom, editor for the Congressional
Publications Office. ``It is not a small project.''
   The embattled speaker, already fighting allegations he violated
House ethics rules, was the object of fresh reports Monday in The
Wall Street Journal about remarks he had included in the
Congressional Record of Dec. 9, 1985.
   His 350-word statement amounted to an effusive endorsement of
the Pacific Institute's series of video motivational programs
designed to enhance family togetherness and conversation.
   ``Marvelously useful,'' Wright gushed. And available ``at a
nominal price within the range of most American families.''
   Wright didn't mention the $36,000 a year annual salary that the
company was paying his wife, Betty. Her job with another company is
the basis for some of the ethics charges now facing the speaker.
   The Seattle-based Pacific Institute said it didn't ask for
Wright's remarks. But it reprinted them later in promoting sales of
the tapes at $34.95 each or $400 for a full set of 21.
   The revelation can't help Wright in the fight for his political
future, but no one is suggesting this is the first the time
Congressional Record provided an official-looking plug.
   Nor is it the first embarrassment involving the Record.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., can vouch for that. In 1986, Helms
inserted into the Record a legal brief filed by a group opposing
``dial-a-porn'' telephone services, Citizens for Decency Through
Law.
   That issue of the Congressional Record became a bestseller.
Included in the brief, and printed in the record, was the full,
X-rated text of one of the tapes. ``Hi, I'm Nellie from High
Society,'' it began.
   Both episodes were possible because of the way the Record is
edited. It isn't.
   Or at least, it isn't edited for content. Copy is edited for
errors and grammar, but little else, said Nystrom.
   ``There is virtually no censorship of comments put on the
record,'' he said. ``The only thing that would be excised from the
record would be obscenities.''
   Content, he said, is governed by the rules of the House and
Senate. The Record prints what is said on the floor of the House or
Senate, and members are free to submit additional statements.
Remarks that violate the rules, such as attacks on another member,
would be edited out.
   In an effort to make the Record more faithfully reflect what was
said, Congress a few years ago decided to have remarks that were
edited or added later appear in a different typeface.
   But inserts can be as lengthy as a member of Congress wants.
Much of the Pentagon Papers, for example, was included.
   The Record is printed through the night and available the next
morning, and it is also available electronically by computer. It
has a press run of 24,000 copies, and Nystrom figures it costs
about $500 per page to print.
   Congressional rules generally bar members from receiving
benefits as a result of improperly exerting their position, and
guidelines caution lawmakers against becoming so ``affiliated with
a particular enterprise'' that it creates an appearance of
impropriety.
   Wright declined to answer questions Monday about his video plug.
But Nystrom says he doubts Wright's use of the Record was unique.
   ``If there was something wrong with that, every member of
Congress would be guilty of doing that,'' he said. ``Everyone ...
uses the Record to promote or call attention to some activity
within their district.
   ``I would see it as a matter of degrees,'' he said.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public Masses for Lucille Ball will be said
in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles on Monday night, ``when most
of the nation was used to being with Lucy,'' the family said.
   Miss Ball's family gathered over the weekend for a brief,
private memorial and the actress' remains were interred at Forest
Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills, a source who requested
anonymity told The Associated Press.
   The weekend gathering took place at an undisclosed location and
included Miss Ball's husband, Gary Morton, and Lucie Arnaz and Desi
Arnaz Jr., her children by former husband Desi Arnaz.
   ``They just said a few prayers together and that was it,'' said
Eddy Jo Bernal, a spokeswoman for the family. ``It was just the
immediate family and some long, longtime associates. It was very
informal.''
   The family announced Monday that Roman Catholic Masses will be
said for the comedian in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. The
services will each begin at 8 p.m. local time on Monday, May 8.
   ``Monday night was the time when most of the nation was used to
being with Lucy,'' a statement from the family said.
   Two of the three long-running comedy shows in which Miss Ball
starred, ``The Lucy Show'' and ``Here's Lucy,'' aired Monday nights
on CBS, while ``I Love Lucy'' had starting times on Monday and
other days as well.
   Miss Ball died Wednesday of a ruptured aorta, eight days after
having heart surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. She was 77.
   Informal tributes to Miss Ball included a blocklong sympathy
scroll signed over the weekend by people visiting her
flower-bedecked star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame. Peggy Robinson,
who thought of the giant sympathy card, said the scroll would be
presented to the family.
   A makeshift shrine was erected at the marble and bronze star, as
fans dropped by with red roses, candy, lipsticks and photos of the
film and television star.
   In New York, the memorial Mass will be celebrated by the Rev.
Jim Fox at St. Ignatius Loyola; in Chicago by the Rev. John Cusack
at Old St. Patrick's Church; and in the Los Angeles suburb of Santa
Monica by the Rev. Lloyd Torgerson at St. Monica's Church.

<HEAD>Kenyan Leader Replaces Vice President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel arap Moi has replaced his
vice president in a shake-up that leaves Kenya's major tribe out of
the government's top two jobs for the first time since independence.
   Moi named George Saitoti, the finance minister and a former
professor of mathematics at the University of Nairobi, as the
country's sixth vice president since this former British colony won
black rule 25 years ago.
   He replaces Josephat Karanja, who resigned as vice president and
vice chairman of the ruling party after receiving a unanimous vote
of no confidence from Parliament. Saitoti retains the finance
portfolio.
   The change leaves both the presidency and vice presidency
occupied for the first time by men who are not members of the
dominant Kikuyu tribe.
   Karanja is a Kikuyu, but his successor calls himself a Masai, a
tribe of largely nomadic cattle herders. Moi, the country's second
president since independence, is a member of the small Kalenjin
tribe.
   Moi, who had been expected to dismiss Karanja if he did not
voluntarily step down after the parliamentary vote, announced the
changes Monday evening. They included reshuffling the portfolios of
nine ministers, abolishing one Cabinet post and creating a new one.
   Thursday's vote of no confidence came after nearly two months of
attacks on the vice president.
   They began with a relatively low-level politician telling a
village gathering that ``an unnamed politician'' had been ursurping
the authority of the president.
   From then on, accounts of verbal attacks on ``an unnamed
politician'' appeared almost daily in Nairobi's three
English-language newspapers.
   Speculation quickly centered on Karanja who, it was said,
arrogantly forced others to kneel before him and was appealing to
tribal animosities.
   But it was not until two weeks ago that Karanja finally was
identified by his detractors.
   Through it all, Moi kept silent, leading to widespread
speculation that he sanctioned or even orchestrated the attacks.
   Kenya, by law, is a one-party state and opposition is firmly
suppressed.
   In announcing his resignation, Karanja again denied the
allegations against him, which included charges of corrupt business
practices and receiving money from neighboring Uganda to
destabilize the government.
   Most other Cabinet changes were minor. But Moi scrapped the
Ministry of National Guidance and Political Affairs and created a
new Ministry of Reclamation and Development of Arid, Semi-Arid and
Waste Land.

   A woman who pleaded guilty to stealing a

   O'Sada, who also was ordered to pay $600 in court costs, could
have received up to five years in prison Monday from Oakland County
Circuit Judge David F. Breck.
   The dress was worn by Madonna in the video ``True Blue.'' O'Sada
and three teen-agers returned the dress three days after it was
taken, claiming they found it in bushes near the mall.

   Jury deliberations at Oliver North's
Iran-Contra trial resumed for the 10th day this morning, a day
after the presiding judge said a court challenge by the news media
threatens the proceedings.
   The panel, which had met for nearly 46 hours in the nine
previous sessions, has given U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell
no notes in a week.
   While the nine women and three men went about their work Monday,
attention in the courtroom focused on a dispute in which 10 news
organizations want access to a trial document that summarizes
highly secret intelligence intercepts of a CIA-assisted shipment of
Hawk missiles to Iran.
   The government says national security would be jeopardized by
disclosing the stipulation, which is part of the evidence before
the jury, and Gesell says the matter could force a mistrial.
   It is highly unusual to supply documents to the jury which are
not part of the public record in the case. Gesell has already ruled
against releasing the document, and Monday's proceedings were
designed to create a record so that an appeals court court review
his decision.
   ``If you prevail in this matter,'' Gesell told a lawyer for the
10 news organizations, ``one possibility is I must discharge the
jury.''
   The judge did not elaborate on how forced disclosure could lead
to the mistrial.
   But one possibility might be a protest by the Justice Department
that national security secrets were about to be disclosed. That
would force Gesell to withdraw the document from the jury's
consideration, which in turn could lead North's lawyers to say he
could not get a fair trial.
   After the court session, lawyer Timothy Dyk told reporters that
``the jury has no security clearance, the jury's free to discuss
it, then the rest of the country ought to see what the jury has.''
   Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, the government
may file an affidavit with the court if it fears disclosure of a
classified document would harm national security. That act can lead
to dismissal of the indictment or the specific charge affected by
the information.
   The stipulation of facts agreed to by the government and North
summarizes messages intercepted by the National Security Agency on
the shipment of Hawk missiles in November 1985 from Israel to Iran
with the help of the CIA.
   North is charged with claiming in a false chronology that no one
in the U.S. government knew until January 1986 about the missiles.
Part of his defense is that then-CIA Director William Casey and
national security adviser John Poindexter knew about the missiles
from the intercepted messages but perpetuated the false story.
North also said former national security adviser Robert McFarlane
orchestrated the false chronology.
   The news organizations' disclosure motion was rejected by Gesell
on April 22 on grounds that the stipulation ``is a classified
document.''
   The ruling was appealed and the higher court sent the matter
back to Gesell for a hearing on national security issues involved,
saying it could not make a decision without having such a record.
   The media organizations involved in the case are The Associated
Press; Cable News Network Inc.; Capital Cities-ABC Inc.; CBS Inc.;
Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc.; National Broadcasting Co. Inc.; National
Public Radio; The New York Times Co.; the Times Mirror Co.; and The
Washington Post.

   A woman who kept snapshots of her children
posing with guns and whose son is accused in a gang rape is the
first person charged under a new anti-gang law targeting parents
who fail to control their children.
   Gloria Williams, whose 15-year-old son is accused of raping a
12-year-old girl, was charged Monday under a misdemeanor law added
to the books last year. She faces up to a year in jail and a $2,500
fine if convicted.
   ``Attacking the gang problem at its roots _ in the home and at
an earlier age _ is crucial to battling this cancer in our
society,'' City Attorney James Hahn said.
   More than 350 people were killed in gang-related violence in Los
Angeles County last year.
   Hahn alleged that Ms. Williams was ``actively involved in her
son's gang.''
   Ms. Williams, 37, was arrested Friday at her home in
south-central Los Angeles and was freed on $20,000 bail.
   Her son, a reputed gang member called Popeye, whose real name
was not released, was arrested for investigation of the rape last
month of the 12-year-old girl. The child told police she was raped
by gang members at various ``safe houses'' over four days, Hahn
said.
   The son is on probation for auto theft and had previous arrests
for investigation of burglary and receiving stolen property, police
said.
   ``All I can say is that they are wrong. My son is not in a
gang,'' Ms. Williams said Monday. ``The police keep putting this on
him, but it is not true.''
   Police who searched the Williams home found gang graffiti
scrawled on walls. Two photograph albums portrayed Ms. Williams
with youths who wore gang clothing and flashed gang signs, Hahn
said.
   ``It looked like the headquarters for the local gang,'' said
Robert Ferber of the city attorney's gang unit.
   Other photographs showed the 15-year-old son with a rifle, a
4-year-old son pointing a pistol at the camera, and Ms. William's
19-year-old daughter posing with an automatic pistol pointed at a
child's head, police said.
   Monday night, a reputed gang member was critically wounded by
shots fired from a passing car, said police Sgt. Ray Heslop.
   Murder charges were filed Monday against a 15-year-old boy
arrested in the shooting death last week of a 16-year-old boy,
apparently killed because his blue cap matched the colors of a
rival gang.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney exaggerated
problems with the Sikorsky Aircraft SH-60F when he scrapped plans
to order 18 of the anti-submarine helicopters in the 1990 budget,
says a congressman from the state where Sikorsky is headquartered.
   ``They were blown out of proportion,'' Rep. John G. Rowland,
R-Conn., said Monday. ``There were really no big problems at all.''
   Cheney last week cited operational problems in the two SH-60Fs
already delivered by Sikorsky, the Stratford, Conn.-based division
of United Technologies Corp. Cheney did include funds to keep the
program going until future purchases can be made.
   But according to briefing papers the Navy provided to Rowland, a
member of the House Armed Services Committee, most of the problems
either have been fixed or are being resolved. The Navy said none of
the failures pose a serious enough problem to prevent safe use.
   The problems included improper installation of a warning light
and damaged sonar cables, according to the documents. The Navy said
the helicopter has ``no substantial design flaws.''
   Sikorsky officials also were fixing problems discovered during
the previous year's testing, including an overly sensitive
automatic altitude control designed to keep the craft at 50 feet
above the water. The system apparently forced the helicopter up and
down with the motion of the waves below, according to Rowland aide
David Boomer.
   The SH-60F is a modified version of Sikorsky's SH-60B Seahawk.
The SH-60F, expected to replace the Sikorsky-built SH-3H, is made
to be based on aircraft carriers for anti-submarine missions. The
SH-60F lowers sonar equipment into the water and pulls it in search
of enemy subs.
   Capt. Barton Strong, the Navy's program manager, told Rowland in
the private briefing Monday that the SH-60F was performing well and
would be a significant improvement over the older SH-3H, according
to the congressman.
   Strong assured Rowland that the Pentagon still supported the
SH-60F program.
   Navy officials told the congressman that the administration
plans to buy a total of 175 SH-60F helicopters over 13 years. Seven
were ordered in 1987 and 18 each in fiscal 1988 and 1989. The Navy
plans to return to a request of 18 in 1991, then 12 a year through
1995, 17 in 1996, 24 in 1997 and 25 in 1998.
   The helicopters cost about $15.8 million each.
   The 1990 budget, which originally called for $313.6 million in
SH-60F spending, was reduced by Cheney to $94 million to cover
spare parts and advanced procurement to keep the program alive. No
SH-60Fs would be purchased in 1990 under Cheney's budget, but
Congress still has to approve that plan.

<TEXT>
   Sales of new homes fell 5.5 percent in March
and registered their first back-to-back declines in more than a
year, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said sales of new single-family homes
dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 587,000 in March,
following a 10.5 percent decrease during February.
   It was the first time sales had declined for two consecutive
months since they fell for five months in a row from September 1987
through January 1988, the months surrounding the October stock
market crash.
   The declines left sales in March at the slowest annual rate
since the 576,000 level of January 1988.
   The report was another indication of the impact with which
rising interest rates have hit the housing industry. Earlier
reports on housing activity in March showed sales of existing homes
declining for the third straight month and construction of new
homes and apartments dropping for the second month in a row.
   The Federal Reserve Board for a year has been pushing up
interest rates in an effort to restrain economic growth and thus
reduce inflationary pressures.
   Fixed-rate home mortgages last week were averaging 11.03
percent, and lenders were asking an average initial rate of 9.38
percent on one-year adjustable rate mortgages, according to a
national survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   The biggest drop in new home sales in March was in the West,
where sales dropped 20.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 155,000.
   Sales in March were down 12.7 percent in the South to an annual
rate of 199,000 and declined 2.8 percent in the Midwest to 105,000.
   Sales surged 43.3 percent in the Northeast to a rate of 129,000
after plunging 26.9 percent during the previous month.
   The drop in sales was accompanied by a 4.7 percent increase in
the median price of the homes sold, as lower-income buyers
apparently were the first ones to leave the housing market.
   The March median price for a new home was $126,000, meaning half
the homes sold for more and half for less.
   The average price, which is pulled up by sales of expensive
homes, was up 4 percent to $152,200.
   For the first three months of the year, new home sales were 1.8
percent lower than in the same period a year earlier.

   President Francois Mitterrand today urged PLO
leader Yasser Arafat to rewrite the group's original charter so
that it no longer calls for the destruction of Israel, a spokesman
for the French president said.
   Jewish merchants in Paris' garment district turned on their
burglar alarms in unison today to protest Arafat's visit, which has
caused outrage in France's Jewish community.
   A point frequently made by Israel is that despite the decision
by the Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament in exile,
to recognize Israel and renounce terrorism, the organization's
charter still calls for the Jewish state's destruction.
   Mitterrand told the Palestine Liberation Organization chief to
alter the charter.
   ``During the meeting, Mr. Francois Mitterrand noted that the
continuation in force of the charter of the PLO, adopted in 1964,
was contrary to important points of the political program adopted
by the Palestine National council in Algiers on Nov. 15, 1988, and
that in his eyes things should be made clear,'' said a statement
read by Mitterrand's spokesman, Hubert Vedrine.
   Arafat later met with several other French political figures,
including Pierre Mauroy, leader of the Socialist Party. Mauroy told
reporters he also raised the article in the PLO charter on the
destruction of Israel.
   According to Mauroy, Arafat replied that ``this text has existed
for many years and is now outdated.''Mauroy said Arafat reaffirmed
the PLO's recognition of Israel and abandonment of terrorism.
   Arafat, after the 90-minute meeting with Mitterrand, smiled and
posed for photographers on the steps of the presidential palace.
Urged to comment, he said only: ``It was a very successful and
useful meeting.''
   He added that all would be explained at a news conference
Wednesday.
   Arafat met with Mitterrand on the day his personal
representative and the PLO's senior official in Lebanon, Issam
Salem, was shot and seriously wounded in an ambush in the Lebanese
port of Sidon, police there said.
   PLO officials with Arafat in Paris said Salem died. The source
of their information was not known, and there was no claim of
responsibility for the attack.
   About 2,000 police, including sharpshooters and helicopter
patrols, were mobilized for Arafat's visit, during which he also
was to meet with Premier Michel Rocard and Foreign Minister Roland
Dumas.
   Vedrine read the French statement about the meeting and said he
would take no questions from reporters.
   The statement said Mitterrand questioned Arafat on his position
concerning elections proposed by the Israeli government in the
occupied West Bank and occupied Gaza Strip and expressed French
concern ``about the serious present situation of the inhabitants of
these territories.
   ``He indicated to Mr. Yasser Arafat that France would continue
to act with all interested parties so that an international
conference on the Middle East can be held under the terms which he
himself (Mitterrand) has already suggested,'' the statement
concluded.
   Israeli leaders were critical of the visit. Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir said: ``This man says a lot of things to the Jewish
people. ... He's following the same tradition of the Nazis.''
   Today is Israel's national day of mourning for the 6 million
Jewish victims of the Nazis during World War II.
   In the Jewish-dominated garment district in Paris, Jewish
manufacturers and shopkeepers set off their burglar alarms and
private car alarms for five minutes to protest Arafat's visit.
   ``It is ridiculous to officialize Arafat before getting any
guarantees,'' said protester Victor Gotajner, a clothing
manufacturer.
   France's Jewish community is largely opposed to Arafat's visit
and planned a demonstration today at the Copernic synagogue where a
bomb in October 1980 killed four people.
   The United States began talks with the PLO in December for the
first time since in 13 years after Arafat said he recognized
Israel's right to exist and renounced terrorism.

   One of the engines of a Saudi Arabian
jumbo jet exploded today while it was flying with 293 people from
Manila to Riyadh, airport officials said.
   No one was injured in the accident aboard the Boeing 747, said
airline and airport officials who were reluctant to give details.
   They said the blast apparently resulted from a mechanical
failure rather than sabotage.
   The state-owned Saudi Arabian Airlines jet was 20 minutes into
the flight when the engine blew up. It safely returned to Manila.
   Manila control tower technician Andy Abuan said flight
controllers monitored the explosion and advised the pilot of Saudia
Flight 389 to turn back.
   One employee at Saudia's airport office, who refused to give his
name, said the explosion was caused by a mechanical failure. He
said there were 276 passengers and 17 crewmen aboard.
   A flight attendant who asked not to be identified told reporters
she heard a hissing sound from engine No. 4 _ the outer engine on
the plane's right side _ before the explosion.
   She said the plane dumped fuel in the South China sea before
turning back.

<TEXT>
   Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun
said today he would consider lifting a blockade of illegal ports
run by Syrian-backed Moslem militias to end an eight-week conflict
that has killed 278 people.
   Aoun made the offer in a 90-minute news conference a few hours
after fierce shelling duels today between Christian and Syrian
gunners in and around Beirut killed two people and wounded eight.
   ``The ports are no longer the basic issue,'' Aoun said at the
presidential palace in suburban Baabda, east of Beirut. ``Syrian
military presence in Lebanon is the issue.''
   Aoun said he might lift the blockade after talks with Arab
League representative Lakhdar Ibrahimi of Algeria, who was due in
Lebanon Wednesday to try to salvage a shaky 4-day-old cease-fire
mediated by the league. Ibrahimi had been scheduled to arrive today
but postponed his arrival, according to sources in Syria.
   Today's casualties raised the overall toll to 278 people killed
and 1,010 wounded since March 8, when fighting broke out between
Aoun's Christian army units and an alliance of Syrian and Druse
forces.
   A police spokesman said Syrian gunners targeted the coastal
strip north of Beirut and prevented the French tanker Penhors from
approaching the power station in the suburb of Zouk to unload fuel
oil.
   The barrage damaged the main power cable connecting the Zouk
plant with Beirut and stripped the capital of its daily two-hour
ration of electricity, said the police spokesman, who cannot be
named under standing rules.
   The Christian voice of Lebanon radio blamed the cease-fire
violation on Syrian gunners and said Aoun's troops ``responded in
self-defense.''
   Voice of the People, radio of the pro-Syrian Lebanese Communist
Party, blamed Aoun for the renewed fighting.
   ``Aoun's gunners started the barrage,'' the radio said without
elaboration.
   The thuds of exploding shells echoed across Beirut and the
flashes of artillery explosions lighted up the dark skies. Most
civilians deserted their apartments and sought refuge in
underground shelters.
   The police spokesman said there was almost no traffic in Beirut
as the warring factions traded sniper fire and rocket-propelled
grenades across the Green Line that divides the Christian and
Moslem sectors.
   ``It seems most civilians have decided to remain in basements
and bomb shelters pending the outcome of Ibrahimi's mission,'' the
spokesman said.
   Ibrahimi was to meet Wednesday with acting Premier Salim Hoss,
head of the Moslem Cabinet in Lebanon's dual government and
complete arrangements for the deployment of Arab military observers
to oversee a new truce.
   An aide to Hoss said Ibrahimi and the Sunni Moslem leader will
discuss a compromise to the sticking point of the truce _ Aoun's
blockade of ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of Beirut.
   The compromise calls for the deployment of Arab observers at the
ports to ``guarantee that they are not used for illegal
activities,'' said the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The aide said it was Ibrahimi's responsibility to convince Druse
warlord Walid Jumblatt and Shiite Moslem leader Nabih Berri to
accept the proposed solution.
   Berri's Shiite Amal militia operates a single-dock harbor in
Beirut's fishermen's suburb of Ouzai and Jumblatt's Progressive
Socialist Party runs two facilities at Khaldeh and Jiyeh south of
the capital.
   Aoun on March 6 blockaded the three facilities that deny the
state treasury of about $100 million in lost customs dues annually.
Aoun also said the ports were used to ``smuggle drugs and
terrorism.''
   Jumblatt's forces responded to Aoun's blockade by shelling the
310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of the capital. Syrian
gunners later joined in the fighting, but Amal did not take part.
   Aoun and other Christian leaders accuse the Syrians of failing
to achieve a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League by
siding with the Moslems in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.

<TEXT>
   Emperor Akihito and his mother, the empress
dowager, will be the only heirs of the late Emperor Hirohito in
order to keep together the royal treasures, news reports said today.
   Kyodo News Service said the Imperial Household Agency asked nine
other imperial successors to waive their rights of inheritance.
   The palace declined comment, however, saying a public
announcement now would be premature.
   Hirohito, Japan's emperor for 62 years, died Jan. 7 at age 87.
Akihito, his eldest son, succeeded him and Hirohito's wife, Nagako,
became empress dowager.
   Under Japanese law, legal heirs to property must claim their
inheritance within six months of the owner's death. This would mean
by July 7 in Hirohito's case, and the tax administration office
must announce the claims within four months.
   It will be the first public accounting of the imperial family's
private finances since shortly after World War II. The government
reported then that the imperial family's wealth amounted to the
equivalent of about $113,000.
   Such things as three sacred treasures _ a mirror, sword and
jewels handed down from emperor to emperor _ are tax-exempt, and
the family owns no land. But bank savings, stocks and bonds under
Hirohito's name and paintings are subject to inheritance taxes.
   Kyodo said the palace will donate the art works to the
government and continue to use them as government-owned imperial
property. The land where the imperial family lives is owned by the
government.
   The imperial family, formerly exempt from taxes, was the
wealthiest family in Japan until U.S. forces occupying this country
after the war forced it to give up most of its property. Its
wealth, including real estate, stocks and bonds, reportedly
amounted to about $29 million before it surrendered most of its
holdings to the government.

<HEAD>Trial Begins of Man Accused of Killing Sons in Hot Foundry Ladle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUSKEGON, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jury selection began today in the trial
of a man accused of killing his two sons in a red-hot foundry ladle
on Thanksgiving Day 1987.
   Muskegon County Circuit Judge James Graves Jr. rejected a motion
by an attorney for defendant Bartley James Dobben for a non-jury
trial.
   Dobben, 28, who has been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic,
has been shuffled among the state's psychiatric centers since his
arrest on Nov. 26, 1987.
   On that day, Dobben, his wife, Susan, and their children,
2-year-old Bartley and 15-month-old Peter, were on their way to a
family Thanksgiving dinner when Dobben pulled into the parking lot
of the Cannon-Muskegon Corp. foundry where he worked in Norton
Shores.
   He left his pregnant wife in the car, telling her he wanted to
retrieve a Bible and show his sons the operation.
   Minutes later, Dobben allegedly placed the boys in a huge
foundry ladle used to hold molten metal and turned on the gas jets
until the ladle reached 1,300 degrees. The boys quickly suffocated
as the ladle became a searing cauldron, autopsies showed.
   Dobben's attorney, Terry Nolan, contends his client should be
found innocent by reason of insanity.
   Brett Gardner, an assistant Muskegon County prosecutor, says
ample evidence exists to show Dobben was criminally responsible for
the slayings.
   Dobben has a long history of mental illness. Court records show
that family members had him committed to the Kalamazoo Regional
Psychiatric Hospital because they were frightened by his actions.
   A September 1985 probate court order said Dobben could be
``reasonably expected within the near future to intentionally or
unintentionally seriously injure (him)self or others.''
   Those suffering from paranoid schizophrenia live in a fantasy
world and may have hallucinations or false perceptions and hear
voices, psychiatrists say.
   After his release from the hospital, Dobben was given
prescriptions for powerful drugs to control his behavior. But
family members said he often refused to take them, especially after
his religious views moved increasingly out of the mainstream.
   He began to associate with a small fundamentalist group called
Emmanuel Fellowship, led by Rood Vaughan, an unordained preacher
and used car salesman.
   Vaughan, who was to be called as a witness, checked himself into
the Kalamazoo Regional Psychiatric Hospital Saturday, one day after
police said he attacked his mother. She suffered a sprained wrist
in the altercation.
   It isn't known how Vaughan's hospitalization might affect
Dobben's trial, which has been postponed several times as
psychiatrists debated the defendant's competency.

   A 15-year-old boy has been arrested in the rape
of a 2-year-old girl, who was taken from a playground, attacked
inside an abandoned building and then dumped in a trash bin, police
said.
   The toddler remained hospitalized in stable condition today,
said Sgt. George Anthony, a police spokesman. He said no details on
the girl's identity and injuries would be released.
   Police also withheld the suspect's identity because he is a
juvenile. But Anthony said officials were seeking a warrant
charging the youth as an adult with rape.
   Police said the girl apparently was carried from a playground
and sexually assaulted Sunday in a vacant house, one of many in the
West Side neighborhood.
   ``We've been calling about these ... houses,'' said resident
Ellen Goddard, complaining about a lack of response by city
officials. ``They told us a lie that they would get them down in
three months.
   ``It made me feel so bad I wanted to hurt somebody.''
   Dale Lee, 30, and Bobby Anderson, 37, found the girl in the
trash bin Sunday afternoon as they returned from a store.
   ``We heard something howling. We thought it was a cat,'' said
Lee. ``When we got closer we thought it was a baby. I saw the
Dumpster shaking up and down and I looked in it and there she was
jumping up and down.''

<HEAD>Bush to Decide on Soviet Grain Subsidies, Dole Said</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush was deciding today whether to
approve a U.S. subsidized sale of 3 million tons of grain to the
Soviet Union, top congressional Republicans said.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said Bush did not
indicate which way he was leaning during a breakfast meeting with
GOP leaders, but that the lawmakers strongly advised him to go
ahead with the deal.
   It would be Bush's first approval of a major agricultural
subsidy. The sale has been the subject of intense disagreement both
within the administration and in Congress.
   Dole told reporters after the meeting that several lawmakers
made ``strong pitches'' to the president on behalf of the sale,
``the point being, if we're going to trade with Soviet Union, which
we are, then we have to be competitive, we have to meet world
prices.''
   ``We made our case to the president,'' said Dole, whose state is
a leading grain producer. ``I think there was general agreement
among those this morning that if we're going to be in this trade
game, we've got to be competitive. The subsidy's not very great in
this case, probably not as much as the storage costs.''
   The Bush administration, following the lead of the Reagan
administration, has called for eventual elimination of all export
subsidies. It has said, however, that it would not unilaterally do
away with such government farm support so long as other trading
nations subsidized their exports.
   Dole and other participants said Bush indicated he would make up
his mind on the subsidies later today, amid reports that the
president might decide on partial subsidies for the grain sales.
   The administration is divided on the proposed grain sale, with
the Agriculture Department supporting it and the Office of
Management and Budget and the National Security Council reportedly
opposing it.
   The sale would be made under a 1985 law, the Export Enhancement
Program, under which nations that buy U.S. agricultural goods
receive bonus quantities of commodities from government stockpiles.

<TEXT>
   The United States has proposed that
NATO make unilateral cuts in its short-range nuclear weapons in an
effort to bridge sharp divisions in the Western alliance over the
missiles, a NATO official said today.
   Under the proposal, the Soviet Union would be challenged to meet
the lower levels of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The weapons would be trimmed as part of NATO plans to modernize
the aging Lance surface-to-surface missile, a project that has
sparked opposition in many European countries.
   Further cuts in nuclear arms would be considered after progress
was made in recently opened arms talks in Vienna on slashing
conventional, or non-nuclear, forces in Europe, the official said.
   In Washington, a U.S. official confirmed the account but said it
was one of several options under consideration. The official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said another option would be West
Germany resuming research and development of a non-nuclear missile
that could attack airfields and other targets now covered by the
Lance.
   West Germany, where the Lance launchers are based, last month
demanded early talks with the Soviets on reducing short-range
nuclear weapons. The United States and Britain strongly oppose the
idea.
   The U.S. ideas, put forward last week to NATO representatives in
Brussels, could serve as elements of a possible way to resolve the
issue prior to a NATO summit May 29-30.
   The NATO official described the American plan ``as a proposal
for a working document for how to proceed on the issue. It doesn't
offer any compromise with the German proposal.''
   NATO officials have been trying to find satisfactory language on
the weapons issue to include in a long-awaited blueprint of NATO's
strategy in arms control and force planning that is to be presented
at the summit.
   A senior U.S. official suggested last month that NATO may fail
to resolve the differences over the short-range weapons. He raised
the possibility that the alliance would not reach a common position
in time for the summit.
   Such an outcome would likely lead to speculation about serious
divisions in NATO. The Western nations are trying to present a
united front in the face of defense cuts promised by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The NATO official said the American plan draws together several
ideas that have been put forward in the alliance.
   It would take reductions proposed by U.S. Gen. John Galvin,
NATO's supreme military commander in Europe, in a recent study of
his nuclear weapons requirements and challenge the Soviets to meet
the lower levels.
   Galvin has pressed for NATO to agree to upgrade the Lance
missile, arguing its modernization would permit a substantial
reduction in nuclear artillery.
   The Lance missile was introduced in 1972 and will become
obsolete in 1995, military analysts say. It has a range of a little
more than 60 miles. The new one would be extended to more than 250
miles, just under the limits of the Intermediate-range Nuclear
Forces treaty.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany said earlier in the year
that a decision to deploy the new missiles should be delayed until
1991 or 1992, which would be after elections next year in Germany.
   NATO defense ministers, at a nuclear strategy session last
month, gave only lukewarm backing to the modernization program,
saying nuclear forces ``must be kept up-to-date where necessary.''
   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said he was satisfied with
the endorsement and was ``reasonably confident'' Congress would
provide more money to continue development of the new generation
Lance.
   There are currently 88 Lance launchers, most of which are based
in Germany. Officials have said the Warsaw Pact outnumbers NATO by
about 12-to-1 in short-range nuclear missile launchers.
   The alliance contends it needs to maintain its nuclear stockpile
to balance the enormous superiority the East has built up in
conventional arms.
   NATO and the seven Warsaw Pact countries began talks in March on
cutting conventional forces in Europe.

   Controversy over the flying of confederate
flags in Alabama has flared with the arrests of three black men,
including a minister, after a confrontation at a drive-in
restaurant.
   Black leaders expressed anger about the arrests and met Monday
night at Tabernacle Baptist Church to discuss the Sunday incident.
   Mayor Joe Smitherman said police reports indicate the rear
window of a car containing two young black men was broken out or
shot out by two white men in a pickup truck flying two Confederate
flags. The arrests occurred after men with an ax handle cornered a
white youngster who was not involved, the mayor said.
   Three black men, including the Rev. George Bennett, were charged
with disorderly conduct. Bennett said he responded to a call from
his nephew, who had been arrested at the drive-in, ``and I wound up
being arrested, too.''
   Smitherman promised Monday to try to prevent a recurrence.
   ``I don't object to the Confederate flag flying over the Capitol
or behind City Hall in Selma, but when somebody tries to use it to
stir up trouble, it's coming down,'' Smitherman said.
   The Confederate battle flag flies atop the Capitol dome in
Montgomery. Fourteen black legislators are appealing their
conviction on misdemeanor trespass charges resulting from a march
to the Capitol grounds in protest of the flying of the Rebel flag.

   The fire was out, an injured woman had
been taken to a hospital and the equipment was back on the truck.
But the Fire Department had one last duty.
   The firefighters paused last week to conduct a brief service for
Madeline Murray's cat.
   The simple grave near the charred home was the latest in the
department's long tradition of burying pets who die in fires.
   ``We've always had the custom of burying them, but in the past
year or so we've started having a little service, making it real
dignified,'' said Lt. Jerry Allen. ``It is just a simple thing we
do, but people seem to appreciate it.''
   When firefighters discover that a pet has died, they ask the
owners if they would like them to bury the animal. Allen said
owners always accept.
   ``It is hard enough losing your couch, your paintings, your
furniture,'' he said.
   For the ceremony, the firefighters gather and take off their
helmets. One will ``say a few words,'' Allen said. The site is not
marked, but the owners, if they are not present, are told of the
general area of the burial.
   ``I have always thought of it as part of my job,'' Allen said.
``I have a dog at home; I have kids at home. This sort of shows the
human side of us.''

   Eleven tugboats on Tuesday began towing a
$2.4 billion oil platform as tall as a 95-story building from a
Norwegian fiord into the North Sea, the state oil company said.
   It will take six days to tow the 956-foot high Gullfaks C
platform the 154 miles to the oil and gas field of the same name,
according to Statoil, which operates the field.
   ``Gullfaks C is the largest and heaviest structure that man has
ever moved,'' the state oil company said.
   The 49,000-ton deck combines a 330-bed housing unit with
drilling and production facilities. It covers about four acres of
water.
   The 24 hollow, concrete cells in the base store 2 million
barrels of oil.
   Production from the platform was scheduled to start in November
with a 245,000 barrel daily capacity.
   The Gullfaks field, which was discovered in 1978, produces
300,000 barrels of oil daily. Production began in December 1986,
and an estimated 31 million barrels of recoverable oil remain, the
Oil Ministry said.

<UNK>New Monument To Striking Workers Wrecked By Bomb</UNK>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bomb today wrecked a new
monument in Volta Redona honoring three striking steelworkers who
were killed by army troops, officials said.
   No injuries were reported in the predawn blast. TV Globo, the
nation's largest commercial television network, said a previously
unknown group, Patriotic Front, claimed responsibility for the
blast.
   The monument was unveiled Monday during Labor Day commemorations
in Volta Redonda, a town 80 miles west of Rio. It depicted the
three victims, with a concrete spear stabbing a worker.
   The monument was designed by architect Oscar Niemeyer, a
communist who designed most of the public buildings in Brasilia,
the nation's capital.
   Police in Volta Redonda said the monument was ``seriously
damaged, although not completely destroyed.''
   The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, added, ``The
explosion was very powerful. The only reason there were no injuries
was because of the time _ 3 a.m.''
   Niemeyer said in a radio interview he was ``deeply shocked'' and
offered to design another monument.
   TV Globo said the blast broke windows 500 yards away and
scattered fragments across a downtown plaza.
   Brazil regained civilian rule, under President Jose Sarney, in
1985, following a 21-year right-wing military regime. Sarney's
administration has been marked by financial chaos, runaway
inflation and almost daily strikes.
   Last Nov. 9, army troops, with Sarney's authorization, invaded
the government-run National Steel Company in Volta Redonda, which
had been occupied by strikers seeking higher pay and shorter
working hours. Three workers were killed.

   President Bush today called for all U.S.
allies to condemn anticipated massive election fraud in Panama,
where the administration predicts Manuel Antonio Noriega will steal
Sunday's vote.
   ``All nations that value democracy _ that understand free and
fair elections are the very heart of their democratic system _
should speak out against election fraud in Panama,'' Bush said in
remarks to the Council of the Americas, an organization of business
people. ``That means the democracies of Europe, as well as nations
in this hemisphere struggling to preserve the democratic systems
they've fought so hard to put in place.''
   In a speech touching on the economic, political and social
situation throughout the hemisphere, the president also said that
unless Nicaragua's leftist government changes the ``ominous''
actions leading to its elections next February, ``It will be a
tragic setback _ and a dangerous one. The consolidation of tyranny
will not be peace. It will be a crisis waiting to happen.''
   He said Paraguay, where Monday's elections led to victory for
Gen. Andres Rodriguez, ``is on its way to joining the democratic
mainstream.''
   ``We congratulate President-elect Rodriguez on his electoral
victory and look forward to working with him,'' Bush said.
   However, White House spokesman B. Jay Cooper later told
reporters there were ``several instances of questionable but not
illegal procedures'' in the Paraguayan elections.
   ``There were also administrative problems,'' according to
embassy and international observers, he said, but not a pattern of
overall fraud.
   ``The small number of votes affected by these irregularities
would not make a significant difference in the overall election
results,'' in which Rodriguez got 70 percent of the vote, Cooper
said.
   Bush continued to step up the adminstration's anti-Noriega
rhetoric as the Panamanian election nears. He repeated his promise
that the United States ``will not recognize the results of a
fraudulent election engineered to keep Noriega in power.''
   The government, controlled by Noriega, is backing the general's
close associate, Carlos Duque, for president. An opposition
coalition is backing Guillermo Endara.
   Bush said it took ``great courage'' for the opposition to enter
the campaign.
   ``A free and fair vote in the elections,'' Bush said, would
enable Panama ``to take a significant step towards ending the
international isolation and internal economic crisis brought on by
the Noriega regime.''
   But, added Bush, ``It is evident that the regime is ready to
resort to massive election fraud in order to remain in power.''
   In Nicaragua, where the Bush administration is supplying
non-lethal aid to the Contra rebels until the elections next year,
the president blasted the election laws recently passed by the
Sandinista-controlled national assembly.
   He accused the Sandinistas of imposing a ``stacked deck''
against their opposition, by unilaterally setting the rules, giving
excessive enforcement powers to the Interior Ministry, and barring
private ownership of television stations.
   Bush praised the recent elections in El Salvador and said the
new president, Alfredo Cristiani, ``has our support.''

   Vermont has been courting movie makers,
but the state almost blew it when it sent Don Johnson a fat tax
bill for his work here.
   The ``Miami Vice'' star got a bill in February for more than
$50,000 of the money he earned in 1987 while filming the movie
``Sweetheart's Dance'' in Hyde Park.
   ``He was upset because he felt he was being singled out,'' said
Don Lyons, a spokesman for the state film bureau, which promotes
Vermont as a movie location.
   On Monday, the state Senate Finance Committee considered a tax
exemption for out-of-state actors and film crews who are in Vermont
for under four months.
   The proposal would be retroactive to Jan. 1, 1986, which would
let Johnson off the hook.
   The state administration believes the money the film industry
brings to Vermont far exceeds what could be raised by taxing actors
and crew members.

   When President Bush introduced comedian Garry
Shandling at a correspondents dinner as just an average citizen he
pulled out of the White House tour line, it wasn't that far from
the truth.
   Shandling was invited to the dinner last weekend by a Washington
Post reporter who also arranged a tour of the White House for
Shandling and his girlfriend. Bush walked by on his way to the Oval
Office and recognized the star of ``It's Garry Shandling's Show,''
which airs on Fox and on Showtime cable.
   ``He said what are you doing in town? and I said, well, I'm
going to the correspondents dinner tonight. He said, well, we
should do something together on stage. I said, no, no, no, no, no,
I just can't, I said I'm on vacation, and I thought he was
completely joking,'' Shandling said.
   ``In fact, I said on stage I thought the president was joking
because I'd never taken him seriously before.''
   Shandling said he spent an hour with Bush and his staff, helping
prepare the president's comedy routine for the dinner.
   ``He said, `I'll say I pulled you out of the line,' and I said,
`Well, I'll say I was in the liberal line, which is the line that
has to pay to get into the White House.' And he just laughed very
hard at that joke,'' Shandling said.

Gumbel wrote in which he criticized Scott's antics.

   Occidental Petroleum Corp., which usually

of its chairman, Armand Hammer, at a cost of $367,000.
   The company is footing the bill for a sequel to the 91-year-old
industrialist's 1987 autobiography ``Hammer,'' said Occidental
spokesman Frank Ashley.
   ```Hammer' only went through 1985,'' Ashley said. ``This book
tells of more recent activities at Occidental and of Dr. Hammer's
activities around the world.''
   Among other things, in 1986 Hammer helped pay for treatment for
victims of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. Lest any investor worry
about misspent funds, ``Hammer'' so far has earned more than
$600,000 in royalties for Occidental.

<TEXT>
   Issam Salem, the PLO's senior official in
Lebanon, was shot and seriously wounded today in an ambush in this
southern port city, police said.
   PLO officials in Paris with Palestine Liberation Organization
chairman Yasser Arafat initially said Salem was killed in the
attack. But late in the day, Arafat told reporters he understood
Salem was in a coma in intensive care.
   ``We must not let ourselves be terrorized by this incident,''
Arafat said.
   In Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut, police said Salem was
driving along Fakhreddin Street when masked gunmen raked his car
with gunfire at 1:05 p.m.
   ``Salem is wounded in the head. His chances of survival are very
slim,'' said a police spokesman who cannot be identified under
standing rules.
   Salem was rushed to Hammoud Hospital and was undergoing surgery,
the spokesman said, adding police had no clue to the identity or
motive of the gunmen.
   On Saturday, Zeid Wehbi, the official spokesman in Lebanon for
Arafat's Fatah guerrilla faction, escaped assassination when a
rocket-propelled grenade was fired at his Sidon home. Two
passers-by were wounded by shrapnel in the attack, but Wehbi was
not home at the time, police said.
   There was no claim of responsibility for the attack today or the
attack on Wehbi.
   In the French capital, where Arafat met with President Francois
Mitterrand of France, a PLO official said the PLO chairman had been
told of the attack on Salem, his personal representative in Lebanon.
   ``Mr. Arafat knows. We informed him,'' said Alassan Riyad.
   Mustafa Saad, head of the Sunni Moslem militia that has ruled
Sidon since the outbreak of Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war in
1975, said he had been told Salem's condition was ``very critical.''
   ``He is in a very critical condition at the intensive care unit
of the Hammoud Hospital,'' Saad said by telephone.
   A senior PLO official, without making specific accusations of
responsibility, said the two attacks were evidently part of an
organized plot.
   ``The rapid succession of the two attempts indicates an
organized intelligence apparatus was out to eliminate Arafat's
men,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Sidon, Lebanon's third-largest city, is the base of an estimated
5,000 PLO guerrillas who have filtered back to Lebanon after the
1982 evacuation of the PLO following the Israeli invasion.
   Salem is married to Jihad Salameh, a sister of the late Hassan
Salameh, the chief of Arafat's personal security apparatus who was
assassinated by a remote-controlled bomb in Beirut in 1979.

   There were 2.9 percent fewer suicides in 1988 than

   Suicides among men fell by 5.5 percent to 14,934 while those by
women rose by 1.7 percent to 8,808, according to the report by the

   Of the suicides, 12,689 were by hanging, 2,526 by leaping from

inhalation, 1,138 by self-immolation, 1,191 by jumping in front of
trains and 567 by stabbing.
   The principal motive was illness, which was cited in 11,235
cases, 73.9 percent more than in 1987,a police official said.
   Other motives were mental disorders, heavy drinking, family
conflict, livelihood problems, office concerns, and disappointment
in love, he said.

<HEAD>Los Angeles County Pays for Sign Interpreters for Deaf Jurors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The county has broken the sound barrier in
court by paying for a sign-language interpreter for a partly deaf
person called to jury duty.
   ``At least deaf people now have the option of serving on a jury
just like everybody else,'' said Nathan Shapiro, an engineer who
was assigned the interpreter Monday because of a settlement reached
in October of a lawsuit.
   The Council for the Deaf sued Los Angeles County in 1981 for
refusing to pay the $4,000 Shapiro spent to hire an interpreter to
help him serve as a juror in 1980. Hearing impairment had been a
valid excuse for being excused from jury duty.
   Shapiro was summoned again in 1987 for jury duty and the county
still refused to pay for an interpreter, said Marcella Meyer,
council executive director.
   The new interpreter service will cost the county $30,000 for a
full-time coordinator plus $171 a day for each interpreter.
   ``It's about time that deaf people had the right to serve as
jurors if they want to,'' Meyer said. ``This is one step forward.''
   ``We hope this will encourage other deaf and hearing-impaired
people to become jurors,'' said Ed Johnson, director of the
county's interpreter services. ``We now have seven others in our
jury pool waiting to be assigned to a court.''

   A truck carrying military explosives
overturned on Interstate 20 just outside this West Texas town, and
police closed the highway and briefly ordered evacuations before
learning the explosives were not armed.
   Local authorities said the truck carried 48 rocket pods
containing 644 M-77 grenades and a quantity of rocket fuel, but
there was no explosion and no fire.
   Explosives experts from Fort Sill and Fort Hood in Texas
inspected the accident site and determined there was no danger,
said officials at the scene from the state Department of Public
Safety and Dyess Air Force Base.
   The authorities decided to have the explosives loaded onto
trucks for transfer to Dyess, where they were to be examined
further.
   The accident occurred about two miles east of Sweetwater, a town
of almost 13,000 people about 40 miles west of Dyess in Abilene and
170 miles west of Fort Worth.
   A seven-mile stretch of the highway, the main east-west route in
north-central Texas, was closed in both directions and traffic was
rerouted into the afternoon.
   Byron Dale Robertson, the driver of the truck, said a deer
crossed his path as he drove down the interstate.
   ``All I know is a saw a deer and I swerved to miss it,'' said
Robertson, of Fouke, Ark., who was treated at a hospital for minor
injuries and released.
   Robertson's passenger, his father, Jimmy Robertson, was not
injured in the accident.
   An evacuation order was issued for all residents within 3,000
feet of the accident scene, but the order was later lifted after an
investigator entered the truck and determined the explosives were
not armed, said DPS spokesman Mike Cox.
   ``People are being allowed back in the area. There's no longer
any threat of an explosion.''
   Officials said the truck was en route from Camden, Ark., to
Concord, Calif., from where the explosives were to be transported
to Korea.
   The rockets were manufactured at LTV Corp. in Camden.
   Deaton Inc., the owner of the truck, is based in Birmingham, Ala.

   Pope John Paul II, who has flown the
equivalent of the distance between the Earth and the moon and more
than halfway back, broke another barrier Tuesday by becoming the
first supersonic pontiff.
   Like the seasoned traveler that he is, the pope took it in
stride, quietly reading a book about animal behavior as the Air
France jetliner flashed across the Indian Ocean toward Africa at
1,350 mph _ twice the speed of sound.
   ``He's showing mild curiousity,'' said Vatican spokesman Joaquin
Navarro as the needle-nosed Concorde carried the pope from the
French island of Reunion to Lusaka, Zambia, on the third leg of his
four-nation nine-day pilgrimage.
   The chief cabin steward said John Paul read during his two hours
and 34 minutes aboard, but he also took time out to learn some
details of the 1,920-mile flight.
   ``He was very interested, he asked us about the speed and the
altitude,'' said the steward, who declined to give his name.
   The crew served 1983 vintage Perrier-Jouet champagne, but the
pope opted for mineral water and orange juice.
   ``He said he had a long day ahead of him, and he wanted to keep
a clear head,'' the steward said, adding that the pontiff only
picked at lunch of goose liver pate with truffles, lobster in
Sauterne sauce, potatoes, rice creole, cheeses and lemon meringue
dessert.
   The Concorde left Reunion and rocketed out over the ocean at a
speed of 225 mph in 30 seconds. About 10 minutes later, the digital
speedometer in the cabin showed the Concorde had reached Mach 1, or
675 mph.
   After another 10 minutes, the speed doubled to Mach 2 as the
Concorde reached 50,000 feet.
   Since the Concorde does not fly at supersonic speed over land,
it detoured around Madagascar and gradually slowed to subsonic
before reaching the African continent over Mozambique. The plane
touched down at 170 mph.
   Prior to the flight, Vatican officials said the pope would fly
only at subsonic speed to Africa, but the crew evidently wanted to
show their distinguished passenger what the Concorde was capable of.
   John Paul returns to a less-exotic form of air travel Wednesday,
taking an Air Zambia ART42 passenger plane to the northern city of
Kitwe.
   Easily the most traveled pope in history, John Paul has flown
more than 370,000 miles in the 10{ years of his papacy.
   He has far surpassed Pope Paul VI, who became known as the
``apostle on the move'' in nine overseas journeys between 1964-70.
John Paul is on his 41st trip.

<TEXT>
   The high price a Las Vegas casino owner
paid for throwing a party on Hitler's birthday has revived the
question: Why don't casino employees have the same constitutional
rights as everyone else?
   Ralph Engelstad, owner of the Imperial Palace, agreed in
February to pay a $1.5 million fine after the Nevada Gaming
Commission ruled that a party he held at the hotel-casino on April
20, 1988, disgraced Nevada's gambling industry.
   ``This was just a good excuse to have a party for the family, as
he calls the employees at his hotel,'' said Engelstad's lawyer,
George Dickerson, who maintains that the private party celebrated
the restoration of a World War II truck in Engelstad's historic
vehicle collection.
   Commissioners dropped claims of damaging Nevada's reputation in
the Hitler party case and of destroying evidence in an unrelated
case after Engelstad agreed to pay one of the highest fines ever
levied by the casino regulators.
   Officials said the party featured a picture of Engelstad in a
Nazi uniform and bartenders in T-shirts bearing Hitler's picture
and the label ``Adolf Hitler _ European Tour 1939-45.''
   Gaming Control Board lawyer Scott Shearer said the fine was
appropriate because Engelstad damaged the reputation of Nevada.
   Dickerson said fining his client clearly violated Engelstad's
First Amendment right to free expression. But Dickerson said
Engelstad made a ``pragmatic business decision'' not to take the
matter to court.
   Dickerson joins a growing group of lawyers and civil liberties
activists who contend that the state tramples the rights of casino
owners and workers in its zeal to protect the image of Nevada's
largest industry.
   Nevada law says gaming is vital to the state and its continued
growth depends upon public trust that can be maintained only by
strict regulation. Under that policy, the state can deny or limit a
casino operator's license.
   Grounds for denying or revoking a license or levying a fine
include such obvious violations as cheating players or skimming
profits. Other grounds include a criminal background, associations
with criminals, lack of integrity or lack of business sense.
   ``They'll do whatever they want to do until some court tells
them they can't do it,'' said lawyer Oscar Goodman. The Las Vegas
attorney in 1979 won a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that commissioners
couldn't order a casino worker to apply for a license after he left
the gambling division of a hotel and became entertainment manager.
   Goodman complained that a rule letting commissioners punish
licensees for ``associating with ... persons of notorious or
unsavory reputation'' forces aspiring casino operators to give up
rights to free association.
   ``Every day these folks when they appear before the commission
for licensing they arewilling to ... say, `Give me my license and I
won't talk to buddies I've known all my life and had into my home
and broken bread with,''' said Goodman.
   Gaming Commission Chairman John F. O'Reilly said a gaming
license is a privilege, not a right.
   ``There is a balancing process any time you have a case where a
person's constitutional rights guarantee the right to free
expression, as opposed to whether that person is doing something
inconsistent with maintaining the privilege to operate in the
gaming industry,'' he said.
   O'Reilly said commissioners have guaranteed constitutional
protections to license holders, including freedom of association.
``I think what has to be looked at is the degree of association and
the significance of association,'' he said.
   The U.S. Supreme Court has often ruled it has no power over
Nevada casinos because gambling isn't an interstate industry.
   Shelley Chase, spokeswoman for the Nevada chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union, said the group hasn't opposed any
state gaming rules. But she said the ACLU believes it could
successfully challenge many as too sweeping.
   ``This is a heavily regulated industry, and gaming is certainly
a privileged industry,'' she said. ``However, we are worried about
laws that are arbitrary, capricious and vague. And these laws are
certainly vague. Especially the one which says you may not bring
disrepute on the state. What does that mean _ what you wear?''
   Ms. Chase said ACLU officials were surprised that Dickerson
didn't approach them for help, because Engelstad could claim added
legal protection since he lives at the Imperial Palace, where the
party took place.
   ``What you do in your own residence is your own business,'' she
said.

<HEAD>Hungary Begins Dismantling Border Fence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HEGYESHALOM, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers today began tearing town a
barbed wire fence and electronic alarm system that separates
Hungary from Austria.
   The event marked the ``closing of an era'' in Hungary's
relations with the West, said Andras Koevari of the Interior
Ministry.
   ``Hungarian glasnost has many faces, and one of them is the
world passport which moved Hungary closer to Western Europe,'' he
said, referring to laws instituted last year that allow Hungarians
to go to the West as often as they can afford to do so.
   Because Hungarians do not require visas to visit Austria,
millions have taken advantange of the new regulations to travel
regularly.
   The work begun today to dismantle the fence on Hungary's
220-mile border with Austria is to be completed by Dec. 1, 1990.
   The fence, an electronic alarm system which is about a mile from
the actual border, once was used to help prevent Hungarians from
escaping to the West.
   A border official, Tibor Vidus, said about 97 percent of those
who recently have tried to flee across the Hungarian border to
Austria are not Hungarians. When work is completed, he said, there
will be no fence on the border with Austria.
   Balazs Novoki, another border official, said the border was
tightly secured until 1955 and was resecured with minefields after
a failed 1956 anti-Soviet revolt.The mines were removed because
Austria complained floods sometimes washed the explosives across
the border, killing farm laborers.
   The electronic signal fence was installed by 1972.
   The Communist Party leadership decided in February that
considering Hungary's improved relations with the West, the
electronic fence should be removed.

   Egypt will grant political asylum to a
Libyan pilot who flew his helicopter to southern Egypt last week, a
newspaper reported Tuesday.
   A government source also said Egypt has opened its border with
Libya to allow thousands of Egyptian workers to return home for a
religious holiday.
   The daily Al-Messa newspaper quoted unidentified sources as
saying the pilot, Maj. Fath'i Miloud al-Saghir, would not be
returned to Libya, where he would face a death sentence. The
26-year-old pilot peeled off from a five helicopter squadron flying
from Libya to Sudan on April 27 and landed in southern Egypt, where
he requested asylum.
   According to a government source, Egypt has opened its border
with Libya to allow tens of thousands of Egyptian workers there to
come home this weekend for Eid, the end of the Islamic month of
Ramadan.
   Libya and Egypt have no diplomatic relations. Relations soured
in 1972 after Cairo spurned a bid by Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Gadhafi to merge the countries.

   How many cars are there in the United States?
What percentage of state prison inmates never finished high school?
Where do you find such facts? Has the government got a book for you!
   To the delight of statisticians and trivia fans alike, the
government is publishing the 109th annual edition of the
Statistical Abstract of the United States.
   The book's 984 pages contain 1,450 charts and tables giving
details about business, society, economics and other aspects of
American life.
   For example:
   _There were 135.4 million cars in the United States as of 1986,
one for every 1.8 persons. Japan had one car per 4.2 people, while
in China there were 1,374 people per car.
   _There were 841.4 million credit cards in use in 1987, more than
three cards for every man, woman and child in the country.
   _There were 1,441 heart transplants in 1987, up from just 62 in
1981.
   _The United States was home to 10.3 million milk cows, 10.7
million sheep and lambs and 53 million hogs and pigs in 1988.
   _Sales of personal computers increased 651 percent from 1981 to
1987.
   _There were 38.7 million cable television subscribers in 1986,
at an average monthly fee of $11.09.
   _A profile of state prison inmates shows that 96 percent are
male; 54 percent have never been married; 62 percent failed to
finish high school and 31 percent were unemployed at the time of
their arrest.
   _Women make 5.1 visits to their doctor annually, compared with
4.8 for men. Women also go to the dentist more, 1.7 visits compared
with 1.4 for men.
   _New single-family homes averaged 1,755 square feet of space in
1987, up from 1,595 in 1980. Many added a garage and extra
bathrooms.
   _Nuclear energy provided 18 percent of the nation's electricity
in 1987, but accounted for more than half of that used in Vermont,
South Carolina and New Jersey.
   For the record, the volume costs $26 in paperback, $32
hardbound, and will be on sale at government bookstores and from
the Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 20402.

<TEXT>
   The famous Bonneville Salt Flats, the dry,
hard-packed lakebed where thrill seekers for decades have gone to
set world land speed records, are losing salt, and the government
wants to know why.
   The 100-square-mile area of smooth, uninterrupted surface, where
even jet-powered cars can run flat out for miles, has been
shrinking 1 percent a year for 28 years, said U.S. Bureau of Land
Management District Manager Deane Zeller.
   ``Given this long-term trend, it's apparent that the Salt Flats,
as we know them today, are in trouble. Clearly, some hard questions
need to be addressed,'' he said in a statement Monday.
   The BLM is asking state agencies, the U.S. Geological Survey,
racing interests and a potash company to join in a three-year,
$330,000 study of what can be done.
   Zeller said that while other salt flats exist in Australia and
Africa, none are of the quality and accessibility of the Bonneville
Salt Flats.
   The BLM has the backing of the Southern California Timing
Association for the study. The group, organizer of the largest of
the annual speed trials held on the salt, has complained for years
about deterioration of the racing surface.
   Many suspect a Wendover company's practice of draining brine
from land adjacent to the flats to recover potash.
   But Reilly Chemical Co. denies responsibility for any
deterioration and maintains there is no hard evidence of an overall
salt loss.

<HEAD>Post Office Faces Financial Crunch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Postal Service is facing a financial
crunch, with revenues running short of what was expected following
last year's rate increase, Postmaster General Anthony Frank said
Tuesday.
   The mail service still expects to finish this fiscal year in the
black, but with a significantly smaller margin than had been
planned, officials said.
   Frank told the agency's governing board that changes must be
made to hold down costs and improve revenues.
   So far in the fiscal year, which began in October, the Postal
Service took in $18.5 billion and spent $17.6 billion, leaving net
revenues of $847 million, reported Senior Assistant Postmaster
General Comer S. Coppie.
   But that was $104 million less than expected in the wake of the
postal rate increase that took effect in April 1988.
   Because it is required by law to break even over the long run,
the Postal Service counts on showing a surplus in the period right
after a rate hike, in order to balance losses which will occur as
its costs rise.
   Lately, rate hikes have come every three years and Frank has
said he hopes to maintain that cycle, with the next increase in
1991.
   Income has been less than expected because of changes in the
``mix'' of mail, said Coppie. In other words, many large mailers
have switched from more costly first class mail to the pre-sorted
first or third class, which costs them less and brings in less
revenue for the post office.
   While managers expected some of this switch, it has occurred
faster than they expected with the resulting decline in revenue,
said Coppie.
   At the same time, continuing efforts to cut costs have not been
as successful as had been hoped for, he added.
   Frank told the postal Board of Governors that he is continuing
to press forward with automation of the postal system as a means of
cutting costs and speeding delivery.
   Also, he said he is trying to improve employee relations and is
looking for ways to broaden product lines and make prices more
competitive.
   The Postal Service cannot change its domestic rates without
seeking approval from the independent Postal Rate Commission, an
agency which Frank criticized for micromanaging his service in
changing some rates requested a year ago.
   The Postal Service is free to revise international rates, and
recently did so, cutting the price of a half-pound interntional
express mail shipment to $10.75, with an introductory rate of $8.75
to try to attract new business. Depending on destination, the price
had ranged from $15 to $18.

   Female alligators that have no qualms
about going for a romantic tumble in the wilds are having trouble
breeding behind bars.
   Sometimes captive girl gators just need a good tranquilizer
before being artificially inseminated, said Paul Cardeilhac, a
wildlife reproduction specialist at the University of Florida
College of Veterinary Medicine.
   ``We were literally rodeoing the female gators before, and they
would rebel by not laying eggs for us,'' said Cardeilhac, who
conducts his research at Gatorland Zoo in Kissimmee, the world's
largest alligator farm.
   ``But we've found that a tranquilizing drug like Valium will
restrain them without interfering with the reproductive process or
affecting the hatchlings.''
   Reproduction in farm alligators is only 10 percent to 20 percent
as effective as in the wild, where females produce about 22
hatchlings each, he said.
   Cardeilhac, who has studied reproductive problems in captive
alligators for nearly a decade, made alligator-breeding history in
1981 when 11 healthy baby gators hatched as the result of
fertilization by his artificial insemination technique.

   Young inventors here have their priorities:
get your bed made, keep your big brother from hogging the
television and help grandma when you can.
   Students from kindergarten through eighth grade displayed the
fruit of their ideas as part of a program aimed at fostering
inventiveness.
   One popular invention at Saturday's award ceremoney was the
Bishop Bedmaker, created by Jeremy Bishop of Sandia Elementary
School.
   His device uses a bed-width roller at the head of the bed. Lines
fastened to the roller have clips at their free ends that are
clamped to the bedcovers. Cranking the roller winds the lines on
the roller and pulls the covers tightly to the head of the bed.
   ``I invented it because I hate to make my bed,'' Jeremy said.
``I want to make an electric one with a button.''
   Lockwood Elementary School fifth-grader Ricky Thompson designed
a key-lock for the on-off switch on the family TV set. He said he
invented it because his 15-year-old brother ``watches too much TV
and doesn't do his homework.''
   Kristen Dickinson of Cameo Elementary re-invented something that
once was a laundry fixture _ a wringer, mounted on a sink or
bathtub.
   ``My grandma has arthritis and couldn't wring out rags,''
Kristen said. ``It's good for small kids, too.''

   James R. Lilley, a veteran foreign service
official who was born in China, arrived Tuesday to take up his post
as the new U.S. ambassador.
   Lilley succeeds Winston Lord, who returned to private life after
more than three years as Washington's top envoy to Beijing.
   He arrives at a time when Beijing is facing the most serious
outbreak of pro-democracy student demonstrations in the communist
government's 40-year history.
   One of his first tasks will be to monitor the first Sino-Soviet
summit in 30 years. Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrives May
15 for talks with China's senior leader Deng Xiaoping that will
normalize long-strained political relations.
   The United States has welcomed the Sino-Soviet rapprochement,
saying it will not affect the strong political and economic ties
between Washington and Beijing.
   Lilley, born in the Chinese coastal city of Qingdao, was
appointed national intelligence officer for China in 1975, the year
President Bush headed the U.S. liaison office in Beijing.
   He also has served in American missions in the Philippines,
Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Taiwan and Hong Kong. From 1986 to 1989,
he was U.S. ambassador to South Korea.
   Before that, he was principal deputy assistant secretary for
East Asian and Pacific affairs in the State Department.
   Lilley, 61, studied classical Chinese at Hong Kong and Columbia
universities and has taught courses on Chinese economics at the
Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies.
   He and his wife, Sally Booth Lilley, have three sons.

<TEXT>
   The government reported Tuesday that sales of
new homes dropped 5.5 percent in March after plunging 10.5 percent
in February, as higher interest rates took their toll in the
housing market.
   It was the first time sales of new single-family homes had
posted back-to-back declines since they fell five times in a row in
the months surrounding the October 1987 stock market crash.
   The new declines left sales at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 587,000 in March, the lowest level since the 576,000 pace of
January 1988, the Commerce Department reported.
   Earlier reports on activity elsewhere in the housing sector also
pointed downward in March, as interest rates on fixed-rate
mortgages hovered around the 11 percent mark, more than a
percentage point above levels of a year earlier.
   The other reports showed that sales of existing homes dropped
for the third straight month in March and that construction of new
homes and apartments was down for the second month in a row.
   ``As long as mortgage rates stay high or move a little higher,
the housing market is not likely to improve much,'' said economist
David Berson of the Federal National Mortgage Association. ``Any
improvement in housing will almost certainly have to come from a
decline in mortgage rates.''
   The Federal Reserve for a year has been pushing interest rates
upward in an effort to slow economic growth and thus restrain
inflationary pressures.
   Housing has been among the sectors of the economy most affected,
and some analysts believe further declines in sales and
construction are likely.
   ``We expect further weakening in the second and third quarters
of the year, and then hopefully a rebound beginning late in the
year,'' said David Seiders, chief economist for the National
Association of Home Builders.
   The association is forecasting new-home sales of 616,000 for all
of 1989, down 8.9 percent from last year.
   John Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Association of
Realtors, said that interest rates are near their peak and that the
high rates ``have taken as big a toll as will be taken on the
housing market.''
   ``When rates start to come down, the people who have been forced
out of the market will come off the sidelines,'' he said.
   The March decline in sales reflected decreases in most regions
of the country and occurred despite a 43.3 percent sales surge in
the Northeast, where sales rose to an annual rate of 129,000.
Analysts said the Northeast gain was a rebound from a 26.9 percent
decline in that region during the previous month.
   The biggest drop in March was in the West, where sales dropped
20.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 155,000 units.
Sales were down 12.7 percent in the South to an annual rate of
199,000 and declined 2.8 percent in the Midwest to 105,000.
   The shift in sales activity to the higher-priced Northeast and
the dropoff in the less expensive South contributed to a 4.7
percent increase in the median price of homes sold in March.
   The March median price for a new home was a record $126,000,
meaning half the homes sold for more and half for less. The average
price, which is pulled up by sales of expensive homes, was up 4
percent to a record $152,200.
   For the first three months of the year, new-home sales were 1.8
percent lower than for the same period a year earlier.

<HEAD>Nepal Won't Be Isolated, Envoy Says</HEAD>

   Nepal's Washington ambassador said Tuesday his
landlocked country will continue expanding its relations with China
and might complain to the United Nations about economic pressure
from its other big neighbor, India.
   India's month-long cutoff of necessities to Nepal causes great
human hardship and threatens the stability of Nepal, said
ambassador Mohan Man Sainju.
   Nevertheless, he told an audience at the National Press Club,
his nation is still ``open to any dialogue, any approach suggested
by India'' for solving the crisis.
   Sainju described as ``beyond comprehension'' statements by
Indian External Affairs Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao and India's
Washington ambassador that there is no economic blockade and Nepal
has itself to blame for reduced supplies of necessities such as
oil, baby food, salt and medicine.
   Petroleum shipments have been held up since March 23, a week
before India declared that a treaty with Nepal had lapsed, he said.
   Sainju also said that the Nepalese finance minister, B.B.
Pradhan, plans ``to talk about a long-term arrangement with China''
on economic matters. Pradhan is in Beijing for meetings of the
Asian Development Bank and the Nepal-China joint economic
commission.
   If Nepalese policy openings to China upset India, let India say
so openly, Sainju suggested.
   Rao, in a long report to the Indian Parliament last week about
relations with Nepal, did not mention Nepal's recent arms purchases
or other contacts with China. But Sainju, asked if Nepal's
redefinition of political and military relationships is at the root
of the dispute with India, replied, ``I think so.''
   ``The realities that exist in 1989 have got to be taken into
account,'' he said. ``Nepal was isolated for so long. It never
wants to be isolated again.''
   Asked if Nepal would formally request help from other countries,
the United Nations or other international agencies, Sainju said:
   ``We may. The U.N. is a very important organization for small
countries, and Nepal is one of the countries really committed to
U.N. values.
   ``But we still believe good sense will prevail'' on the part of
India. ``We do not want to believe India ... is bullying its
neighbor.''
   The State Department last month urged India and Nepal to
negotiate their differences and declined comment ``on the relative
merits of this bilateral issue.''

   The AIDS crisis has generated nationwide support
for sex education but taken attention away from other important
sexual topics like pregnancy prevention, according to a survey
released Tuesday.
   ``Support for sex education is strong. Not only does a large
majority of the American public support it, but so do most state
education agencies and large school districts,'' concluded the
study, ``Risk and Responsibility: Teaching Sex Education in
America's Schools Today.''
   But the report found that of the nearly $6.3 million states
spent in 1987-88 on sex education curricula, $5.1 million was
specifically for AIDS instruction.
   Forty states either support or require sex education, said the
study by the Alan Guttmacher Institute.
   But Jeannie Rosoff, president of the institute, said that states
``have abdicated their role in sex education'' by giving districts
only vague guidelines on how to teach it and by not setting teacher
certification standards.
   The study also found that nearly one third of sex education
teachers said their biggest problem was pressure from parents, the
community or administrators, especially when dealing with
homosexuality, condoms or abortion.
   The $323,000 study, funded primarily by the Carnegie Corp. of
New York, examined teaching policies and methods in grades 7-12.
The findings were published in ``Family Planning Perspectives,'' a
bi-monthly publication of the Guttmacher Institute, a private,
nonprofit research group that studies reproductive health.
   The study consisted of three nationwide mailed surveys conducted
in the spring of 1988. One polled 4,241 of the estimated 50,000
public school teachers who teach sex education. A second surveyed
all 50 state education departments and the District of Columbia
regarding sex education laws, policies and curricula. The third
asked similar questions of 162 large school districts.
   It concluded that the ``crisis orientation'' created by AIDS has
led educators to stress ``the negative outcomes of sex'' while
often neglecting other important issues.
   In only six states _ Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts,
Michigan, New Jersey and Vermont _ are condoms discussed
explicitly. Michigan's curriculum discusses where condoms can be
bought and New Jersey's suggests ways of teaching students how to
use them.
   Five other states _ Alabama, New York, North Carolina, Ohio and
Oklahoma _ discuss condoms but in a negative light, usually
stressing the failure rate. New York's curriculum extols abstinence
as ``freedom from the bother and dangers of the pill, IUD and other
contraceptives.''
   The curricula ``leave something to be desired in terms of
balance,'' said Asta M. Kenney, a co-author of the study.
   Eight out of 10 teachers surveyed said they could use help in
teaching about pregnancy prevention and sexually transmitted
diseases.
   Mary Hatwood Futrell, president of the National Education
Association, said the study demonstrates the need for better
teacher training.
   ``Our public schools must provide teachers with the necessary
tools and resources to conduct effective sex education at all
levels,'' she said.
   Twenty-nine percent of teachers complained of inadequate
materials, and 25 percent said students were a problem because they
were embarrassed or ignorant about sex.
   Among other findings:
   _46 states plus the District of Columbia support AIDS education,
and 43 plus the District of Columbia support instruction about
other sexually transmitted diseases. Forty-three support the
teaching of abstinence.
   _32 states require or encourage instruction on pregnancy
prevention. Alabama discourages such instruction and Utah prohibits
it. Only Delaware and Georgia specify contraception methods and
outline the risks and benefits of each.
   _Half the states require some kind of training or certification
to teach sex education. But only Michigan, Ohio, Utah and the
District of Columbia require teachers to have taken a course in
human sexuality.
   _87 percent of large districts have sex or AIDS curricula and 96
percent cover the negative aspects of teen-age sex. More than 70
percent of the districts discuss abstinence as the best alternative
in grades 7-10, but such lessons drop off to 50 percent in grades
11 and 12.

<HEAD>FBI Says It May Release Details of Library Counterintelligence Probe</HEAD>

   The FBI said Tuesday it may release some
details of agents' visits to the nation's libraries to monitor
Soviet and East Bloc intelligence agents. The program has been
questioned by those who say it violates the confidentiality of
library users.
   The bureau has been conducting what it calls an ``awareness
program'' in the New York City area, telling librarians that Soviet
and East Bloc agents use libraries to seek technical data and to
approach potential recruits.
   The FBI also goes into libraries elsewhere in the country in
response to specific counterintelligence investigations of
suspected East Bloc agents who have used those facilities.
   The bureau says the program is a narrowly focused effort which
does not infringe on the public's use of the nation's libraries.
   ``There is not a widespread investigation ... tromping on the
rights of individuals engaged in the use of American libraries,''
said FBI spokesman Milt Ahlerich.
   The FBI's comments are in connection with an agreement reached
with a private group which had sued seeking access to some of the
information the bureau gathered in its investigations. The suit was
filed under the Freedom of Information Act.
   A stipulation reached between the bureau and the National
Security Archives was signed Monday by U.S. District Court Judge
Louis F. Oberdorfer.
   The bureau will begin processing more than 3,000 pages of
documents related to library visits in at least 13 states, said
archives director Scott Armstrong.
   The archives is a non-profit research facility that collects
declassified information on national security issues.
   Civil liberties and library groups have objected to the
surveillance program. They say it has a chilling effect on
constitutional free speech rights and violates state laws and
library rules designed to protect the confidentiality of library
users.
   Quinlan Shea, special counsel for the archives group, said the
stipulation is an important step toward responding to the concerns
of groups which have questioned the FBI's effort.
   ``We sensed in discussions that the bureau would like to sort of
reassure the library community that this isn't some half-crazed
search and destroy mission'' by the FBI in the nation's libraries,
said Shea.

   Hungary on Tuesday began cutting
down the barbed-wire fence and alarm system that divides it from
Austria, removing one more barrier between this increasingly
liberal socialist country and the West.
   A crowd in this border town watched as bulldozers removed one of
the concrete pylons that hold up the winding, 8-foot high fence.
Rusted barbed wire lay in bundles nearby.
   Hungary says it expects to have all the fencing, which has a
built-in electronic alarm system that was used to detect people
escaping to the West, by Dec. 1, 1990.
   Hungary said last year it would remove the fence it built 40
years ago because of fewer travel restrictions, a desire for closer
ties with Austria and the cost of maintaining a barrier that has
become obsolete.
   The event marks the ``closing of an era'' in Hungary's relations
with the West, said Andras Koevari of the Interior Ministry.
   ``Hungarian glasnost has many faces, and one of them is the
world passport which moved Hungary closer to Western Europe,''
Koevari said.
   Hungary last year instituted what are among Eastern Europe's
most liberal travel laws, allowing its citizens to travel to the
West as often as they can afford it.
   Because Hungarians do not require visas to visit neutral
Austria, millions have taken advantange of the new regulations to
travel regularly.
   But the travel rules also have made Hungary a key escape point
for refugees from other, less liberal East Bloc countries such as
Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Romania.
   Tibor Vidus, a Hungarian border official, said 97 percent of
those who try to flee across the Hungarian border to Austria are
not Hungarians.
   Balazs Novoki, a senior border guard official, estimated the
cost of dismantling the system at between $500,000 to $660,000.
   He said civilians living in the border region were being asked
to help tear down the barriers.
   The fence stands about a mile from the actual border. Between
the two are field that authorities used to keep plowed so fleeing
refugees could be more easily spotted.
   Once, during the 1950s, Hungarian authorities planted mines in
the ``no man's land'' between border and fence. The electronic
system was installed in 1972.
   With the fence gone, Novoki and Vidus both said the military
would have a greater responsibility to watch for illegal crossings.
   Hungary is among the most liberal of the Soviet bloc nations.
The Communist Party leadership in February endorsed a multiparty
system, but leaders remain split over the pace and scope of reforms.

<HEAD>Another 36 Plans Approved for Expanded Use of Guard Units in War
on Drugs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has approved
plans submitted by another 36 states or territories to step up use
of their National Guard units in fighting drug trafficking, the
Pentagon said Tuesday.
   The additional approvals bring to 48 the number of plans now in
place for the expanded use of Guard units. It also expands to $25.2
million the amount committed to the drug-interdiction program for
the National Guard.
   The Pentagon action makes the states eligible for extra federal
funds from a special congressional appropriation of $40 million
approved last year to finance such National Guard operations.
   Cheney announced the first approvals on March 30, concentrating
then on 12 high-priority border states. Those 12 states together
were authorized to use 29.4 percent of the $40 million, or $11.8
million.
   On Tuesday, the Pentagon said Cheney approved commitment of
another $13.43 million to 34 states, Puerto Rico and the Virgin
Islands. Of those on the latest approval list, New York will
receive the most _ $1.8 million _ followed by Puerto Rico with $1.1
million and the Virgin Islands with $873,835.
   ``Remaining plans are in the final review process,'' the
Pentagon said.
   The Pentagon said the plans of each state varied to some extent.
   But in general, the state and territorial governments are
planning to increase National Guard operations by emphasizing more
``aerial photography and other imagery; radar surveillance;
long-range reconnaissance; assistance in searching containers, and
the transportation of law enforcement personnel, equipment and
seized substances.''
   In addition, the Pentagon said some of the state governments
planned to ``expand training of law enforcement personnel and
increase the loans of military equipment.''
   ``This expanded role does not include direct participation by
Guard personnel in police activities such as arrest and seizure,''
the Pentagon stressed, adding its goal is ``supporting civilian
drug law enforcement agencies in the nationwide crusade against
drugs.''
   Besides New York, the other states and the amounts their Guard
units are receiving include:

Pentagon.

<HEAD>Assassinated Activist Had Just Reported On Death Squads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An anti-apartheid activist was
assassinated outside his home just days after completing a report
contending death squads are stalking government opponents, his
editor said Tuesday.
   David Webster, a university lecturer, was shot in the chest
Monday by an assailant who fired a shotgun from a passing car,
police said Tuesday. Police spokesman Col. Frans Malherbe said
doctors removed 16 pellets from Webster's body.
   Police offered a $4,000 reward for information leading to the
killers and released sketches of three unidentified white male
suspects.
   Glenn Moss, co-editor of South African Review, said an article
by Webster and a close friend, Maggie Friedman, was to appear in
the political journal's next edition in August.
   ``Assassinations are used as one of the methods of controlling
government opposition when all other methods such as detention or
intimidation have failed,'' the article says. ``It is a very rare
event indeed when such assassinations are ever solved.
   ``The past 12 months have witnessed a steady tempo of
kidnappings and assassinations of anti-apartheid activists ...
carried out by clandestine groups, presumably a death squad.''
   Expressions of sorrow and outrage over the white activist's
slaying came from blacks and whites, and from anti-apartheid,
academic, labor and student groups. Flags were flown at half-staff
Tuesday at the University of the Witwatersrand where Webster, 44,
taught anthropology.
   Max Coleman, who worked with Webster against race
discrimination, told hundreds of mourners at the Johannesburg
campus Monday night: ``There is only one group that stood to gain
from this act: those who are dedicated to perpetuating the brutal
and vicious system that David dedicated his life to opposing.''
   A statement in London from the African National Congress
guerrilla movement said Webster's death is ``the latest in a long
chain of such acts carried out by supporters of the apartheid
regime, determined to silence their opponents by whatever means.''
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions said Webster ``was
not just a sympathizer in our struggle: he was a friend, a comrade,
an active participant.''
   Several dozen black activists have been murdered in recent
years. Many white activists in South Africa receive anonymous
threats. But few have been attacked since the unsolved 1978 killing
of political science lecturer Rick Turner.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said: ``I want to make it
clear on behalf of the government that the murder is strongly
condemned and that no stone will be left unturned to apprehend
those responsible.''
   But South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu said ``I would be
surprised if the assassins are apprehended.''
   In a statement from an Anglican Church meeting in Cyprus, Tutu
said it was ``yet another example of the methods used against those
who stand for justice in South Africa.''
   The South African Council of Churches said Webster's death ``has
tragically demonstrated the vulnerability of anti-apartheid
activists in South Africa, given the fact that those who murder
opponents of the apartheid system are never brought to book.''
   The banned Detainees' Parents Support Committee said of Webster:
``His work went a long way to exposing those acting under the cover
of darkness.''

<HEAD>Bush Urges US Allies to Denounce `Massive Election Fraud' in Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush urged U.S. allies Tuesday to
denounce ``massive election fraud'' anticipated in Panama's
presidential voting Sunday, saying, ``It is time for the plain
truth.''
   In particular, Bush called on European democracies to raise
their voices against alleged election-rigging by Panamanian
strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega to ensure the victory of his
figurehead candidate, Carlos Duque.
   ``Let me be clear,'' Bush said. ``The United States will not
recognize the results of a fraudulent election engineered simply to
keep Noriega in power.''
   Bush made his remarks in a speech at the State Department before
the Council of the Americas, an organization of businessmen with
interests in Latin America.
   The address marked another step in the United States' year-old
failed campaign to force Noriega from power following his U.S.
indictment on drug-smuggling charges. Fearing that Noriega will
steal Sunday's election, the Bush administration is trying to
discredit the outcome.
   ``It is evident that the regime is ready to resort to massive
election fraud in order to remain in power,'' Bush said. ``The
Noriega regime continues to threaten and intimidate Panamanians who
believe in democracy.
   ``It's also attempting to limit the presence and freedom of
action of international observers and to prevent journalists from
reporting on the election process in Panama,'' said Bush, who has
not yet announced the makeup of the U.S. observer team.
   ``All nations that value democracy ... should speak out against
election fraud in Panama,'' Bush said. ``And that means the
democracies of Europe, they should be speaking out about this ...
.''
   He said, ``It is time for the plain truth: the day of the
dictator is over. The people's right to democracy must not be
denied.''
   In Panama, Maj. Edgardo Lopez, a spokesman for the pro-Noriega
Panamanian Defense Forces, said the opposition has been demoralized
``and they know they are going to lose the election.
   ``They have sent an SOS to the White House, `Urgent, President
Bush to take immediate action or Noriega will stay,''' Lopez said.
   Touching on developments in other nations of the hemisphere,
Bush accused Nicaragua of enacting restrictive laws to thwart the
opposition in elections next February.
   ``The result is a stacked deck against the opposition and
stacked rules of the game,'' Bush said.
   Setting out guidelines by which the United States will judge
whether Nicaragua's elections are free, Bush said the government
must allow outside observers to have free access to all election
places and proceedings.
   ``It means a secret ballot on election day, the freedom to
campaign, to organize, to hold rallies and to poll public opinion,
to operate independent radio and TV stations as well,'' Bush said.
   ``It means the absence of intimidation either from a politicized
Sandinista military or police, or from those neighborhood block
committees that control peoples' ration cards,'' he said. ``It
means an end to the arrests and bullying of opposition leaders.''
   Bush called on the Soviet Union to end its support of the
leftist Sandinista regime.
   ``The Soviet Union must understand that we hold it accountable
for the consequences of this intervention and for progress toward
peace in the region and democracy in Nicaragua,'' the president
said.
   Bush said that Paraguay ``is on its way to joining the
democratic mainstream'' following the presidential election Monday
of Gen. Andres Rodriguez.
   ``We congratulate President-elect Rodriguez on his electoral
victory and look forward to working with him,'' Bush said.
   Later, White House spokesman B. Jay Cooper later told reporters
there were ``several instances of questionable but not illegal
procedures'' in the Paraguayan elections.
   ``The small number of votes affected by these irregularities
would not make a significant difference in the overall election
results,'' in which Rodriguez got 70 percent of the vote, Cooper
said.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir read the names of
his slain parents Tuesday, joining thousands of Israelis who
remembered the 6 million Jewish victims of the Nazi Holocaust by
reciting their names at ceremonies.
   The programs at the parliament, army bases, holy sites and
schools came on an annual remembrance day marking the World War II
tragedy that presaged the founding of the Jewish state.
   About 100,000 Holocaust survivors have settled in Israel, and
the legacy of helpless Jews driven to their deaths in gas chambers
or shot anonymously in forests, has been a driving force behind the
nation's vigilance about security.
   This year's observance was organized around the theme ``Unto
every person there is a name,'' and participants in Israel and 15
other countries were expected to recite the names of some 300,000
Holocaust victims before sundown, Army radio reported.
   The 77-year-old head of the right-wing Likud bloc joined the
program outside Israel's parliament building, where six torches
flickered in the wind. Shamir lost his parents, two sisters, their
husbands and their children.
   ``My father, Shlomo Ysernitzky, who escaped before the train
left for a death camp and while seeking shelter among friends in
the village where he grew up, they, his friends from childhood,
killed him,'' Shamir said, his voice quavering uncharacteristically.
   He paused, then named as other Nazi victims his mother, Pearl;
his sisters, Miriam and Rivka; their husbands, Mordechai and
Yaacov, and their children.
   Shamir has never disclosed how his family perished, but they are
believed to have died in death camps, said his aide, Yossi Ahimeir.
The prime minister also read the names of 30 other victims before
other Cabinet members continued the listing.
   Shamir, born in Ruzinoy, Poland, immigrated to pre-state
Palestine alone in 1935. He helped found a resistance group, known
as the Israel Freedom Fighters, or the Stern Gang, which staged
raids against the British rulers in Palestine.
   He has seldom spoken about his personal loss, although he
frequently refers to the Holocaust and compares Israel's current
adversaries to the Nazis.
   Earlier Tuesday, Shamir condemned French President Francois
Mitterrand's meeting in Paris with PLO chairman Yasser Arafat.
Israel considers the Palestine Liberation Organization a terrorist
group and refuses to deal with it.
   ``This man says a lot of things to the Jewish people,'' Shamir
said of Arafat on Israel radio. ``He is following the same
tradition as the Nazis.''
   Holocaust day is one of national mourning in Israel. Flags are
flown at half-staff, melancholy music is played on the radios and
entertainment places are closed.
   The day's events began when sirens sounded at 10 a.m. (3 a.m.
EDT), bringing pedestrias and cars to a standstill for two minutes
of silent tribute.
   At the Ben Yehuda outdoor shopping mall in Jerusalem, merchants
and shoppers paused to bow their heads.
   Name-reading ceremonies at schools and army bases were broadcast
on the radio. Survivors choked back tears as they recited names;
others told horrifying stories.
   Ruth Eliaz, a survivor of the Auschwitz death camp in Poland,
told how she gave her starving, 7-day-old daughter a fatal
injection of morphine at the coaxing of a Polish nurse who feared
both mother and child would be sent to the gas chambers.
   ``I killed my own little girl,'' she said.
   At the observance at the parliament, Dutch-born Leah Zonershein,
a survivor of the Bergen-Belsen death camp in Germany, recited the
names of her deceased parents, Chaim and Hannah, then could not
continue.
   She said later she felt it was necessary to summon bitter
memories to ensure the tragedy is not forgotten.
   ``Holocaust day became a routine thing here,'' said Mrs.
Zonershein, 62. ``The number, 6 million, says nothing to most
people. But name after name after name, that gets the message
across.''
   Holocaust day is observed midway between the anniversary of the
start of a 1943 Jewish uprising against German troops in Warsaw,
Poland, and Israeli Independence Day, which this year is May 10.

<HEAD>Church Buys Houses To Get Rid of Drug Dealers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Drug pushers aren't dealing across the street
and gunshots no longer interrupt services at a small Baptist church
since the congregation bought a few abandoned buildings used as
crack houses.
   The 293 members of Third Shiloh Baptist voted unanimously in
February to put down $80,000 for five houses with money they
started saving 20 years ago for a new church.
   ``We were afraid to come out,'' said Emma Snowden, a church
board member. ``And they weren't ashamed. The street had more
traffic than Canal Street,'' the city's main business thoroughfare.
   The church, and the houses, are a block from the Desire public
housing project _ the city's largest and one of its most notorious
for drug use and violence.
   Church complaints led to two busts in the last five months and
the sound of gunfire sometimes punctuated services, Snowden said.
   The congregation is now using federal money to renovate the
dwellings so the church can rent them out and stabilize the
neighborhood to keep dealers out.
   A bank was asking $90,000 for the properties but sold them for
much less, officials said. Benjamin Edwards, church board chairman,
said Shiloh is negotiating to buy two other houses from another
owner.
   The maximum federal grant for fixing up a three-bedroom house is
$8,500, and the landlord must rent it for 10 years to a low-income
tenant, said Shelia Danzey, director of the city office of housing
and urban affairs.
   Danzey said 1,000 units have been renovated in the city under
the program, but Third Shiloh's five are the first owned by a
church or community group.
   The tenants will pay about $125 a month for a three-bedroom
apartment and there is already a waiting list, Edwards said. Each
house has two units.
   Some of the rent money will go to a scholarship fund and 15
percent to 25 percent toward building the new church members were
saving for, he said.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Paul A. Yost
today faulted Exxon's revised plan to clean up the nation's largest
oil spill, but promised the effort will be completed this summer.
   ``The plan is very thin. There's not a lot of backup or
substantiation,'' said Yost, an admiral chosen by President Bush to
track the cleanup effort for the federal government.
   ``We are going to be done this summer,'' Yost also said at a
news briefing after arriving for a weeklong tour. ``Some beaches
are going to be sparkling, some beaches are going to be far from
sparkling.''
   Yost's comments followed the release Monday of Exxon's revised
strategy to clean up the oil spilled by the tanker Exxon Valdez.
   Exxon wants to burn or bury the sludge recovered, and says
environmental laws may have to be bypassed to allow the disposal.
The plan, submitted only hours before a deadline, requires Yost's
approval before it is put into effect. He said he will make that
decision within a week.
   Exxon faced protests today in at least three states. Consumer
groups in Alaska and New York state asked for boycotts of Exxon
products. In Oregon, 20 state legislators joined in the call for a
one-day boycott, and demonstrations were planned at the port of
Portland, where the crippled tanker is expected to be repaired.
   Exxon's proposal immediately drew the scrutiny of Alaskan
environmental officials, who contend that Exxon failed to act
quickly to clean up the more than 10 million gallons of oil spilled
when the tanker hit a reef March 24 in Prince William Sound.
   The plan estimates that poor weather and logistical problems
will force a slowdown in the cleanup through September, cutting by
50 percent the number of days the crews can actually spend on the
beaches and water.
   Exxon's two-part strategy on cleanup and disposal makes no
provisions for continuing the operation beyond mid-September.
   ``It's our objective and we're convinced ... with the plan that
we currently have that we'll get the major part of this spill
cleaned up by the middle of September 1989, Lawrence Rawl, chairman
and chief executive officer of Exxon, said in an interview on ``CBS
This Morning.''
   The plan also notes that 191 miles of moderately fouled
coastline may be left untouched to be cleansed naturally by the
environment.
   Traces of the spill have been found 500 miles southwest of
Valdez along the Alaska Peninsula.
   ``Lightly oiled areas might not require cleaning,'' the report
said, ``if environmental considerations indicate that allowing
natural forces to operate produces a better result than the
mechanical process.''
   ``We are going to have to take a hard look at that,'' said Bill
Lamoreaux, the ranking state environmental official monitoring the
cleanup.
   Pete Wuerpel of the state's Division of Emergency Services said
the plan did not help newly fouled communities like Chignik, 525
miles southwest of Valdez.
   ``I think there is an element of arrogance; I think there is an
element of patronizing; I think there is an element of
unwillingness to redress the injury,'' said Wuerpel, who is
coordinating the efforts of the numerous state agencies involved in
the cleanup.
   Exxon's proposal, a revised version of an earlier plan that
government authorities rejected as incomplete, divides 364 miles of
Alaska's oil-tainted shores into four categories based on the
amount of pollution.
   It covers areas within Prince William Sound, as well as those
outside the immediate spill zone, and calls for nearly 3,400
workers to participate in the cleanup. The cost was not disclosed,
but Exxon reportedly is paying clean-up workers $16.67 an hour.
   The worst areas _ three miles of sludge-covered beaches on
several small islands in the sound _ would be targeted immediately,
with the others scheduled for gradual cleansing through Sept. 15.
   The recovered waste would be strained for usable oil that can be
refined, and the oil-laced wastewater could be treated at the
Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.'s disposal plant in Valdez.
   The gunk and sludge that resists treatment or salvage will be
burned or buried, Exxon proposed. Both methods likely will require
exemptions from local environmental laws, which Exxon says may
arouse opposition from environmentalists and others.
   ``We are concerned about the approval process,'' the study said,
adding that Exxon would seek permission to have the laws bypassed
temporarily.
   ``I'm sure there is a portion of it which indicates that some of
the ... material that's been picked up or described as sludge,
burning would be one way of disposing of that, which might require
as indicated some relaxation of some air quality,'' Rawl said on
CBS.

<HEAD>Scientist Says Hungry Little Creature Threatens Great Lakes Food
Chain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A spiny-tailed little creature with a big
appetite, a water flea that may have hitched a ride from Europe
aboard Soviet freighters, is threatening to disrupt the food chain
in the Great Lakes, a federal scientist said Tuesday.
   Only a half-inch long, the predator called bythotrephes is a
variety of water flea with a long, spiny tail, said Henry A.
Vanderploeg, a scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
   What bythotrephes lacks in size, it makes up for in appetite.
Vanderploeg said his research showed one of the little creatures in
a day can clear 1{ quarts of water of the native water fleas that
provide food for newborn fish.
   ``For an animal this small, it represents a high rate of
clearance,'' Vanderploeg said at NOAA's Great Lakes Environmental
Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Mich.
   The water fleas native to the Great Lakes provide food for
juvenile alewives, bloaters and perch, which in turn are food for
salmon, trout and other large predatory fish.
   Because of bythotrephes, in future years ``it is possible that,
for example, alewives, certain forage fish, could be less abundant,
and since these forage fish would be less abundant, salmon and
trout could also become less abundant,'' Vanderploeg said.
   However, a more precise forecast of the effect of the European
predator must await a better understanding of the Great Lakes food
chain, he said.
   Bythotrephes were first found in Lake Huron in 1984 and by 1986
had spread to Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. They are now found in all
the Great Lakes.
   The predators may have been brought from Europe in water ballast
aboard empty grain freighters from the Soviet Union and dumped into
the lakes, NOAA said.
   Bythotrephes are found in freshwater throughout northern Europe.
There, however, ``it is not disruptive to the food chain in the
sense that it has been there for a long time,'' Vanderploeg said.
``All the plankton and fish that have evolved there are used to
having it around.''
   Although the European predator can damage the Great Lakes food
supply for very young fish, ``at a certain stage in the life cycle
of a fish, bythotrephes would then become food for that fish,''
Vanderploeg said.

<HEAD>Denver Abolishes Zoning Ordinance Dubbed `Living In Sin' Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Denver residents will no longer have to carry
around their marriage certificates and housing inspectors can stop
counting toothbrushes.
   Denver has abolished its ``living in sin'' law.
   The ordinance dating from the 1960s, when residents feared
hippie invasions and communal living would ruin their
neighborhoods, was repealed by the City Council 7-6 Monday night
after spirited debate.
   ``Zoning laws are here to regulate density, not relationships,''
said Councilwoman Debbie Ortega, who voted for the change.
   Under the law, boarders and unrelated people were not allowed to
live in the same house in areas zoned R-0. In areas zoned R-1, a
homeowner was required to obtain a $20 boarder's permit to cover a
non-relative.
   The two classifications covered about 60 percent of the city,
which has a population of more than 500,000.
   Although residents frequently ignored the law, officials
enforced it when a complaint was filed. Fines were $999 a day. In
many cases if a homeowner was caught violating the law, he or she
had to sell the house, sometimes at a loss, to avoid paying the
fine.
   Councilwoman Cathy Donohue said the law forced people to carry
their marriage certificates around with them and that zoning
inspectors complained about having to count toothbrushes in homes.
   The one-vote margin reflected strong support for keeping the
measure on the books.
   ``The family is the fundamental structure that preserves our
society,'' said Councilman Bill Roberts.
   The vote is a ``step toward destroying our city,'' said
Councilman Ted Hackworth. Councilman Bob Crider called passage ``a
sad day in the city of Denver.''
   Eight years ago, when there was an attempt to change the law,
many churches had opposed the action. This time, however, most of
the opposition came from families and a real estate agent who sold
houses based on the zoning restrictions.
   The agent tells ``buyers that no one can move in next to them
that isn't married. This appeals particularly to families,''
Donohue said.
   Three nuns who lived together were among those who had been
targeted as violators before the law was rescinded.
   ``They wanted all but one of us to move out,'' said one of the
nuns, who asked that her name not be used. ``To me, it's wasteful
to have just one person living in a dwelling with four bedrooms.
It's very sinful.''
   The Mexican consul, students sharing expenses and unmarried
couples also were affected by the law.

   A committee appointed by Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir to work out details of his Palestinian elections proposal is
discussing ways to involve the United States in observing the
balloting, a spokesman said Tuesday.
   U.S. involvement, which could answer one Palestinian objection
to Shamir's plan, was among various tactics being studied on how to
conduct the proposed vote in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip, said Shamir spokesman Yossi Ahimeir.
   In the occupied territories Tuesday, 12 Arabs were wounded in
clashes with troops, according to Arab reporters and hospital
officials.
   One of the reported victims was a 7-year-old girl shot in the
head in a clash in the Gaza Strip's Shati refugee camp.
   The worst confrontation was in the crowded market in the West
Bank city of Nablus, where soldiers opened fire on dozens of
stone-throwing protesters, the reporters said. Six people suffered
gunshot wounds, hospital officials said.
   About 3,000 police were deployed around Jerusalem's Old City for
Leilat El Kadr, the Moslem night of prayers marking the prophet
Mohammed's receiving the holy Koran.
   Soldiers were reported to be stopping young Palestinians in the
occupied territories from entering Jerusalem to prevent a
repetition of rioting that occurred on the first day of the Moslem
holy month of Ramadan.
   The main prayer takes place at the Al Aqsa mosque compound, one
of Islam's holiest sites and the location of the rioting. Israel
radio said 10,000 worshipers were expected at Al Aqsa, compared
with up to 50,000 in previous years.
   Israelis also marked a national holiday Tuesday to mourn the
Jewish victims of the Nazi Holocaust, and Shamir compared PLO
leader Yasser Arafat to the Nazis as he protested French President
Francois Mitterrand's meeting with Arafat in Paris.
   Shamir said on Israeli radio that Jews everywhere should beware
of Arafat.
   ``This man says a lot of things to the Jewish people. ... He is
following the same tradition as the Nazis,'' he said.
   The Polish-born prime minister later read the names of his own
family members killed by the Nazis. Hundreds of other Israelis
recited the names of other victims in memorial events throughout
the country.
   Arafat's visit sparked several protest demonstrations outside
the French Consulate in Jerusalem.
   The largest group, 50 members of the Temple Mount Faithful,
carried the French tricolor flag marked with a black stain.
   The group's leader, Gershon Salomon, said Mitterrand's meeting
with Arafat ``soiled France's honor'' and urged France to extradict
Arafat as a murderer. The group advocates rebuilding the Jewish
temple on the site now covered by the Dome of the Rock and Al Aqsa
mosques.
   Ahimeir said Tuesday the premier has appointed a team to work
out a blueprint for elections in the occupied territories, despite
Palestinian demands that Israel withdraw its troops before any vote.
   Shamir's plan calls for elections to chose Palestinians from the
territories to negotiate with Israel on a five-year period of
autonomy, to be followed by talks on the final status of the lands
occupied since the 1967 Middle East war.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization and Palestinians in the
territories have rejected the idea of limited autonomy under
continued Israeli control since it was first suggested more than 10
years ago.
   Shamir made his plan public last month in Washington after
international pressure built on Israel to find a way to end the
16-month Palestinian uprising, which has taken the lives of 458
Palestinians and 18 Israelis.
   Ahimeir said one idea considered for the balloting was some form
of active U.S. participation in overseeing the elections, which
would answer Palestinian and Arab demands for international
supervision of the vote.
   ``I think that U.S. participation and help can be considered,''
Ahimeir said. ``We are always ready to be assisted by the United
States which is genuinely interested in achieving peace ... and
enjoys the trust of both sides.''
   Israeli news reports said the blueprint might be presented to
U.S. officials by Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who is due to
visit Washington in three weeks. A Rabin spokesman declined comment.
   Rabin told representatives of Israel's collective farms in Tel
Aviv that Israel should not rush into elections ``out of the
blue,'' but should agree on an entire process for the vote.
   Facing complaints about stone-throwing attacks on the cars of
Jewish settlers in the occupied territories, Rabin suggested Israel
consider subsidizing protective windows in the vehicles of the more
than 70,000 settlers.
   It would cost $6.7 million to $8.3 million, and ``we will
suggest this to the residents of the territories, and we should
offer to subsidize it if necessary,'' he said.

<HEAD>US Says Khmer Rouge Must Play Minimal Role</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department on Tuesday stepped up its
campaign against the Khmer Rouge rebels by saying that close ties
with a future Cambodian government would not be possible if it is
heavily influenced by that Marxist group.
   The statement by spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler came amid an
intensification of efforts by the Vietnamese-backed government in
Cambodia and non-communist rebel forces to reach an accommodation
on the shape of a future government.
   With Vietnam planning to withdraw the remainder of its forces
from Cambodia by this September, the United States has become
increasingly concerned about the possibility that the Khmer Rouge
could regain power there.
   The Khmer Rouge, the most militarily powerful of the three
resistance forces, are estimated to have killed more than one
million Cambodians during their 3{ years in power in the late 1970s.
   ``The United States is totally opposed to a return to dominance
in Cambodia by the Khmer Rouge,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   ``We believe that the best means to achieve this goal would be
acceptance by all parties of a comprehensive settlement agreement
under which the Cambodian people were able to determine their own
future through a process of free choice.''
   She reaffirmed the U.S. view that an interim coalition
government should be formed to organize elections and that Prince
Sihanouk, the former head of state, is a logical leader of such an
arrangement.
   She said that whether the Khmer Rouge, minus discredited leaders
such as Pol Pot, are permitted to participate in such an interim
government is one thing the Cambodian factions themselves will have
to decide.
   But, she said, that American ability to work with any future
Cambodian government ``would be related to the level of Khmer Rouge
participation in that government.''
   Ms. Tutwiler said it is imperative to have a settlement that
includes effective safeguards to keep the Khmer Rouge from
dominating Cambodia once more.
   ``We are convinced that in free and fair elections, the
Cambodian people would reject the Khmer Rouge,'' she said.
   As part of stepped-up U.S. diplomacy in the region, Vice
President Dan Quayle met on Monday with Sihanouk during a visit to
Indonesia.
   Sihanouk said later, after a meeting with Indonesian President
Suharto, said he was optimistic a settlement was within reach.
   The non-communist resistance is eager to reach a political
settlement with the Vietnamese-backed government before the
withdrawal of the Vietnamese forces. Without an agreement, there is
concern that Khmer Rouge will regain power in Phnom Penh because of
their superior military capability.
   The Bush administration has reflected its concern by considering
for the first time the provision of military aid to the two
non-communist factions.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC's bionic heroes defeated some other people's
heroes on ABC and CBS to win the first Sunday movie showdown of the
May ratings sweeps.
   ``Bionic Showdown: The Return of the Six Million Dollar Man and
the Bionic Woman II'' ranked 11th for the week, with a Nielsen
rating of 17.6 and a 28 share.
   ABC's ``My Name is Bill W.,'' about the founder of Alcoholics
Anonymous, had a 15.2 and 24 and ranked 24th. Part one of CBS'
two-part ``Guts &amp; Glory: The Rise and Fall of Oliver North'' came
in third Sunday with a 14.0 and a 23 share to rank 31st.
   The rating is a percentage of the nation's 9.4 million homes
with television. The share is a percentage of sets actually in use.
   A repeat of ABC's ``Roseanne'' was the highest-rated show of the
week, edging a new episode of NBC's ``The Cosby Show.'' ``Cosby''
had a slightly lower rating but a higher share, apparently because
of daylight saving time when there are fewer viewers at 8 p.m. EDT
compared with 9 p.m. when ``Roseanne'' airs.
   The top 10 shows of the week were: ``Roseanne,'' ABC; ``Cosby,''
NBC; ``Cheers,'' NBC; ``A Different World,'' NBC; ``Murder, She
Wrote,'' CBS; ``Golden Girls,'' NBC; ``Dear John,'' NBC; ``L.A.
Law,'' NBC; ``The Wonder Years,'' ABC, and ``Empty Nest,'' ABC.
   NBC won the week ending April 30, its 45th in a row, with an
average rating of 13.7 to CBS' 11.7 and ABC's 11.4. The week
included five days of the May sweep, one of four month-long periods
a year when local stations' ratings are measured.
   The ``CBS Evening News'' pulled into a tie with ``ABC World News
Tonight'' in the news ratings. Each had a 9.8 rating and 21 share.
``NBC Nightly News'' had an 8.7 rating and 19 share.
   The lowest-rated prime-time shows of the week were: ``Dream
Street,'' ``West 57th,'' ``Hard Time on Planet Earth,''
``Moonlighting,'' ``A Man Called Hawk,'' ``Over the Edge,''
``Living Large,'' ``Jim Henson,'' ``Heart and Soul'' and ``Code
One.''

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II condemned South Africa's
system of apartheid on Tuesday and urged Zambia to keep trying to
resolve its neighbor's racial turmoil.
   Church choirs, tribal drummers and a military honor guard
welcomed the pontiff here, the third stop of a nine-day pilgrimage
to four African and Indian Ocean nations.
   John Paul was flown from the island of Reunion in an Air France
Concorde, the first time a pontiff has traveled in the supersonic
passenger plane.
   President Kenneth Kaunda, one of Africa's elder statesmen, bowed
and shook hands with John Paul after the pontiff customarily knelt
on the tarmac and kissed the ground.
   The pope was expected to discuss South Africa's racial policies
during his three-day visit to Zambia, and to speak out about the
rapid spread of AIDS in this largely Christian southern African
country.
   Thousands of Zambians _ including women who wore sari-like
cloths emblazoned with John Paul's portrait _ gathered to hear the
pope commend their government for fostering ``constructive
dialogue'' with Pretoria.
   He also mounted a harsh attack on apartheid.
   ``Your continuing efforts to promote constructive dialogue by
the parties involved must be your response to the unacceptable
system of apartheid,'' John Paul said. ``Racism stands condemned
but it is not enough to condemn,'' he said.
   South Africa, where the white minority wields political and
economic power over 24 million voteless blacks, is high on the
agenda of talks between the pope and Kaunda, officials said.
   Kaunda, 65, is head of the Frontline States regional group
spearheading African efforts to end apartheid. The other members
are Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.
   Kaunda told John Paul that black nations neighboring South
Africa were confronted by ``the affliction of apartheid ... an
all-round human degradation declared by the international community
as a sin against humanity itself.''
   The Frontline States were unhappy during the pontiff's last
Africa travels in October, when his plane was diverted by bad
weather to Johannesburg.
   Foreign Minister P.W. Botha welcomed the pope despite Vatican
statements that the pope would not visit South Africa while
apartheid remains entrenched.
   Kaunda, a former Church of Scotland mission teacher who led the
former British colony of Northern Rhodesia to independence as
Zambia on Oct. 24, 1964, is a lay preacher for the
Methodist-related United Church of Zambia.
   He outlawed political opposition by declaring Zambia a one-party
state in 1972 and since has survived several coup attempts.
   Zambia is heavily in debt to foreign lenders, unemployment and
inflation are at record levels, urban crime is rampant, shortages
of basic commodities are commonplace and the incidence of AIDS has
been rising rapidly.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome has killed 900 Zambians in
the last four years, including one of Kaunda's sons. Masuzgo Kaunda
died at age 30 in December 1986.
   There are about 1.7 million Catholics among Zambia's 7 million
people.
   The pontiff leaves Zambia on Thursday for neighboring Malawi.
   While on the Indian Ocean island of Reunion earlier Tuesday, the
pope beatified a 19th century French missionary considered the
apostle of the island's slaves.
   The beatification represented a first step towards possible
sainthood for Jean-Bernard Rousseau, known as Brother Scubilion,
who died in 1867. Rousseau spent 34 years on the island, teaching
catechism to the African slaves brought to the island by the French
colonists.

newsletter said Tuesday.
   The retirement of State Secretary Imre Miklos as president of
the office as of Monday was confirmed by the Hungarian news agency
MTI, which said Miklos' duties were taken over by deputy president
Barna Sarkadi Nagy. No new president was appointed.
   Miklos's retirement came after what MTI described as ``crucial
changes'' in Hungarian church policy.
   It said the essence of the change is that state control is to be
withdrawn from all fields of church a life so as to ``finalize the
separation of the state and churches.''
   MTI said the change in church policy serves the purpose of
expanding the cooperation between the state and churches in the
social, political, cultural and educational spheres.
   The official report made clear the existing church affairs
office would be completely overhauled and given a new name in the
spirit of Hungary's political and social reforms.
   ``There is a need for open political activity in order to create
a forum for coordination of interests that would attract ...
church, state and party officials, as well as independent and
prestigious politicians,'' MTI said.

<HEAD>Navy Delaying Deployment of Trident 2</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy has found the mechanical problem that
caused a Trident 2 missile to explode last March, but corrective
design changes will contribute to a three-month delay in
deployment, a military official said Tuesday.
   Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, said a Navy board of
inquiry had blamed the failure on a mechanical linkage in the
first-stage nozzle.
   ``We now expect the first operational missiles to be at sea on
the (submarine) USS Tennessee in March'' of 1990, he said.
   The mechanical linkage is responsible for moving the rocket
nozzles back and forth during the early seconds after a launch. The
Pentagon previously had disclosed preliminary findings, made final
by the Navy board.
   ``They (the Navy) have decided that they have to do some
redesign and modification of the mechanical linkage that transmits
the nozzle position commands to the nozzle exit cone at the base of
the missile,'' Howard said.
   ``Incorporating these changes will allow us to conduct the next
test in July.''
   Howard declined to estimate the cost of the design changes, but
described them as ``fairly simple.'' The Navy said the missile's
builder, the Lockheed Corp., would have to bear the cost.
   The Navy's investigation began March 21, shortly after a Trident
2 missile fired from the Tennessee blew up just four seconds after
launch. The missile popped to the surface as planned and the first
stage ignited properly, but then the missile began spinning like a
burning pinwheel and exploded.
   It was the first submarine launch of the Navy's newest and most
powerful nuclear weapon.
   Howard said Tuesday the delay in deployment was based on two
other factors in addition to the design change.
   ``First, there has been a cessation of all propellant casting,
including the (Trident) second-stage motors, due to the explosion
at the Hercules plant in Magna, Utah, on March 29,'' he explained.
   ``Second, there's an on-going strike at the Kaiser (Aerotech)
plant in San Leandro, Calif., which has resulted in stoppage of
delivery of nozzles for both the second and third stage of the
Trident rocket motors. We anticipate that the delivery of those
will resume by June.''
   On Capitol Hill, Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House
Armed Services Committee, praised the Navy for its willingness to
delay the Trident's deployment, singling out program manager Rear
Adm. Kenneth Malley.
   ``I hope everyone will heap praise on the program manager for
striving to make his missile work rather than damning him for
failing to meet an arbitrary deadline _ the great crime of the B-1
(bomber),'' Aspin said.
   The three-stage Trident 2 is a more lethal version of the weapon
that is the heart of America's naval nuclear deterrent, the Trident
1. The new missile can deliver three to 12 nuclear warheads to
individual targets up to 6,000 miles away.
   The Navy says the new weapon is much more accurate than its
undersea predecessors _ Polaris, Poseidon and Trident 1 _ and can
match the targeting ability of land-based missiles even though it
is launched from a submerged, moving submarine.
   The Tennessee is the first of nine submarines slated to carry 24
of the missiles.

   Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun said
Tuesday he may compromise with Moslem militiamen to end the
fighting in Beirut, but will pursue diplomatic channels to oust
Syrian troops from Lebanon.
   The commander of Lebanon's mainly Christian army said he will
consider lifting a blockade of three illegal ports run by
Syrian-backed Moslem militias to end eight weeks of fierce fighting
that has killed 278 people.
   As he made the offer at a news conference, shelling duels
continued between Christian gunners and an alliance of Druse
militiamen and Syrian troops who have ignored Friday's cease-fire
call by the Arab League.
   Police said two people were killed and eight wounded Tuesday,
bringing the toll of wounded to 1,010 since the current fighting
erupted March 8.
   Asked about the blockade, Aoun said it ``could be suspended.''
   ``The ports issue is no longer the basic issue. Syrian military
presence in Lebanon is the issue,'' he said.
   Aoun had declared a ``war of liberation'' against 40,000 Syrian
troops deployed across 70 percent of Lebanon under a 1976 Arab
League peacekeeping mandate.
   But he added: ``The hot phase in the war of liberation is over
... We are prepared to pursue liberation through diplomatic means.''
   He said he was waiting to discuss the ports blockade Wednesday
with Arab League envoys due to arrive from Syria.
   League official Lakhdar Ibrahimi of Algeria and Ahmed Abdel-Aziz
Jassem, Kuwait's ambassador to Syria, will try to salvage the
cease-fire and finalize deployment of a multinational Arab observer
force.
   On Tuesday, Aoun called the Arab plans a ``breakthrough.''
   ``The observers will be watching the Syrians here and our
problem will be discussed by the forthcoming Arab summit
conference'' this month, Aoun said.
   He and other Christian leaders accuse the Syrians of breaking
their peacekeeping mandate by siding with the Moslems against the
Christians.
   In Damascus, Syria, diplomatic sources said the Syrian
government told the Arab League representatives that fighting would
persist until Aoun lifted the blockades.
   Ibrahimi was to meet Wednesday with acting Premier Salim Hoss,
head of the Moslem Cabinet in Lebanon's dual government.
   An aide to Hoss said they will discuss a compromise calling for
the deployment of Arab observers at militia-run ports to
``guarantee that they are not used for illegal activities.''
   The aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was
Ibrahimi's responsibility to convince Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt
and Shiite Moslem leader Nabih Berri to accept the proposed
solution.
   Syrian gunners maintained a sporadic bombardment of Lebanon's
310-square-mile Christian enclave throughout Tuesday. Each side
accused the other of starting the barrage.
   A police spokesman said Syrian gunners targeted the coastal
strip north of Beirut and prevented the French tanker Penhors from
approaching a power station to unload fuel oil.
   A main power cable was damaged in the barrage, stripping the
capital of its daily two-hour ration of electricity, said the
spokesman, who customarily is not named.
   Most civilians deserted their apartments and sought refuge in
underground shelters as they have most of the time since the
fighting began.
   A U.N. report published Tuesday said the battles have caused
$250 million in damage, destroyed two-thirds of Lebanon's fuel
storage facilities, hit 150 factories and 3,000 residential blocks,
and paralyzed industry.
   The Geneva-based Office of the U.N. Disaster Relief Coordinator
said the priority is setting up an emergency food reserve for
50,000 families and supplying drugs for the chronically sick.
   It said two-thirds of Lebanon's population is affected by the
strife, which has caused more than 100,000 people to flee abroad
and 500,000 to escape Beirut for safer parts of the country.

   Bianca couldn't bring herself to sleep with Mick
anymore because she didn't find him attractive. Liz couldn't
imagine herself as First Lady because she was ``a Jew married seven
times.''
   Who's spreading such gossip? That quiet man, Andy Warhol, in the
posthumously published ``Warhol Diaries.'' Parts _ juicy ones _ of
the book were printed this week in People magazine.
   Warhol apparently began keeping a diary in 1976 as a way to
establish a record of his expenses for the Internal Revenue
Service. He would talk on the telephone with writer Pat Hackett
(editor of ``Diaries''), who would record and transcribe their
conversations and send Warhol a copy.
   Warhol, as it turns out, was keeping track of more than cab
fares.
   The artist said he spoke to Bianca Jagger about her relationship
with her husband, Rolling Stone Mick Jagger.
   ``At first she was saying that she never cheated on Mick, but
then she said he was splitting from her because she had so many
affairs,'' Warhol said. ``She said she and Mick had hit rock
bottom, that she can't go to bed with him because she just doesn't
think he's attractive.''
   Warhol told Elizabeth Taylor, who was married at the time to
Sen. John Warner, that it would be great to see her in the White
House. She reportedly replied, ``Oh, but I just want to be a
senator's wife. I mean, can you imagine me in the White House? A
Jew married seven times?''

<TEXT>
   Soldiers at Sri Lanka's largest army
garrison Tuesday repelled an attack by Sinhalese militants who may
have been searching for weapons and killed at least three raiders,
a military official said.
   Five soldiers were injured in the raid, which came during a
heavy downpour said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   At least 100 militants attacked the Panagoda army garrison 12
miles southeast of Colombo with grenades and automatic weapons, he
said. The garrison usually holds between 10,000 and 15,000 soldiers.
   It was the biggest raid on an army post by militants since they
launched a bloody campaign to protest government peace overtures to
Tamil rebels, who are fighting for a separate homeland, the
official said.
   The Sinhalese militants, who belong to the left-wing People's
Liberation Front, said a 1987 India-backed peace accord giving the
Tamil minority limited autonomy made too many concessions. They
began killing government officials and ruling party members.
   India sponsored the accord, sending troops to northern and
eastern Sri Lanka, because of the sympathies of its own 60 million
Tamils to the rebel cause.
   Indian Foreign Secretary Shailendra Kumar Singh met Tuesday with
President Ranasinghe Premadasa to discuss the withdrawal of Indian
peacekeeping troops.
   Sri Lankan officials were to meet Wednesday with Tamil rebel
leaders for talks on ending their 6-year-old separatist war.
   The campaign for a Tamil nation has claimed 10,000 lives.
Sinhalese militants have been blamed for more than 3,000 killings
since January.
   The militants have attacked army camps and police stations to
get weapons. The military official said the attackers of the
Panagoda garrison penetrated the camp's perimeter and came within
yards of its armory before being beaten back.
   Army soldiers searched rice paddies and jungles near the camp
for the militants, he said.
   Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists, form 75 percent of Sri
Lanka's 18 million people. They control the government and the
military.
   Tamils, predominantly Hindus, make up 18 percent of the
population and allege discrimination in jobs and education by the
Sinhalese.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was just
speaking his mind and not representing the Bush administration when
he forecast failure for Kremlin chief Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
administration officials said Tuesday.
   There is widespread hope inside the government that the United
States can seize on Soviet arms control concessions, according to
official spokesmen.
   Cheney has been defense secretary for just over one month, and
his prediction in a televised weekend interview that Gorbachev
would fail and be replaced by a hardliner caused a stir in official
Washington.
   President Bush, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and White
House chief of staff John Sununu quickly stepped forward with more
optimistic assessments, although they did not publicly rebuke
Cheney.
   Despite the official optimism, there was cause to worry about
the future of Gorbachev's reform, officials said. Cheney's
pessimistic predictions came just a day after the Soviet Communist
Party newspaper Pravda, in an unprecedented development, published
five pages of speeches by party officials saying Gorbachev's
reforms had damaged the economy and were undercutting the Kremlin's
authority.
   And the Central Intelligence Agency declassified a report on
April 23 saying Gorbachev had been forced to alter or postpone many
planned reforms, including a key one, decontrolling prices.
   A significant segment of the U.S. intelligence community
believes that Gorbachev faces limited chances of success, although
many government analysts think the United States ought to take
advantage of his arms control concessions, according to
administration and congressional sources.
   Cheney predicted in a weekend interview that Gorbachev would
fail in his effort to reform the Soviet Union and likely would be
replaced by a hardliner. Therefore, he said, the United States
should not take any unilateral steps, such as removing any of the
324,000 U.S. troops stationed in Western Europe.
   A Pentagon official, speaking anonymously, denied that Cheney
was trying to offset West German pressure on the United States to
negotiate with Moscow to eliminate short-range nuclear missiles.
   ``He was not trying to be Machiavellian,'' said the Pentagon
official. ``He was just saying what he believes. In his mind, he is
still on Capitol Hill,'' where Cheney served congressman from
Wyoming for 12 years and was No. 2 in the Republican leadership.
   Bush, speaking Monday in New York, said the United States
``wanted to see perestroika (reform) succeed in the Soviet Union.
And likewise, we want to see success for the economic reforms in
China.''
   Success for Gorbachev would give the Bush administration a
chance to capitalize on the Kremlin leader's sweeping offers to cut
Soviet conventional forces in Europe and overall strategic arsenal
by half.
   Baker reaffirmed U.S. hopes for Gorbachev by reissuing the text
of a speech he gave last month.
   ``We very much want perestroika to succeed, and we very much
want the General Secretary (Gorbachev) to succeed. We think that's
in the best interest of the United States and the best interest of
the world because it will result in a more open, stable and secure
Soviet Union,'' said Baker's statement.
   Cheney sparked the controversy by saying in an interview
broadcast last Saturday that ``if I had to guess today, I would
guess ultimately he would fail,'' and would be replaced by a leader
``far more hostile'' to the West.
   Cheney said much the same thing last Tuesday, telling Congress
he had become convinced Gorbachev's reforms were sincere because it
was clear that ``the Soviet system has been a failure.''
   ``I think it's going to be extremely difficult for him to
succeed, and I think there is a very real likelihood that he'll
either have to reverse course, or that or one reason or another,
ultimately have to resort to force, perhaps in Eastern Europe,
perhaps in terms of dealing with the ethnic unrest inside the
Soviet Union,'' Cheney told the House Armed Services Committee.
   Cheney's remarks mirrored an assessment voiced last October by
Robert Gates, then the No. 2 official at CIA and now the deputy
White House national security adviser. Gates' comment sparked a
similar controversy, because then-President Reagan and George
Shultz, who at the time was secretary of state, publicly had placed
great faith in Gorbachev.

   Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union rose
to 4,557 in April, the highest total since October 1979, the
National Conference on Soviet Jewry reported Tuesday.
   In the first four months of this year, 14,018 Jews left the
Soviet Union, compared to 16,273 in April 1979, when emigration
reached an all-time high of 51,320.
   In March, 4,240 Jews departed. That was the highest total since
October 1979 but was then eclipsed by the April figure.
   Most of the Jews who left in April went to the United States. A
total of 516, or 11.3 percent, decided to emigrate to Israel.
   Shoshana S. Cardin, chairman of the Jewish group, welcomed the
increase but said ``many long-term refuseniks remain'' in the
Soviet Union where their applications for exit permits have not
been approved.

   Heavy rains have helped the western Corn Belt
and nothern Great Plains, but much of the sorely damaged winter
wheat area is still parched from lack of moisture, a government
report said Tuesday.
   Winter wheat was in ``mostly fair to poor'' condition during the
final week of April, particularly in the central and southern areas
of the plains, the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said. Butg
rain helped improve winter wheat in the northern Great Plains.
   ``In Kansas, high temperatures and wind stressed winter wheat,''
the report said. ``Condition was mostly very poor to poor. Crop
development was poor in most fields. In Texas, winter wheat was
mostly fair to poor.''
   Lack of moisture continued to put stress on Nebraska's winter
wheat, and crop condition was reported as mostly poor to fair. Rain
improved the crop in Montana and South Dakota.
   Rain slowed planting of spring wheat, which is far behind for
this time of season. In North Dakota, planting was 16 percent
complete, 23 percentage points behind normal.
   But corn planting spurted ahead sharply, reaching 25 percent
completion, a 17-point advance from the week before, the report
said. Producers planted over a third of their corn acreage in
Illinois, Kansas and Missouri during the week.
   Corn planting progress was 13 percentage points behind the
normal pace of of 25 percent in Indiana, and 22 points behind in
Ohio, where 28 percent of the acreage is usually planted by now,
the report said.

   A man who was arrested after being
videotaped flinging cash to children through the sunroof of his
fancy car has been sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined $2
million for dealing cocaine.
   Kevin Allen Walker, 28, had pleaded in March guilty to
possession with intent to distribute more than two pounds of
cocaine.
   ``On occasion he made well-publicized drives through the area in
a flashy, expensive car, passing out currency to the children, thus
brandishing to the citizenry, and especially to the pliable young,
that drug dealing was a profitable activity to be emulated,'' U.S.
District Judge Edward J. Devitt said Monday.
   Police found cocaine in a van Walker was driving and in his
Mercedes-Benz. They also found more than $57,000 in cash and three
semiautomatic weapons.
   Walker's arrest in November was precipitated in part by
community outrage over accusations he sent children into frenzies
by throwing bills as large as $50 from his car.
   A neighborhood activist capture the act on home video and turned
the tape over to police and TV stations.
   Defense attorney Earl Gray said the controversy prompted police
to investigate Walker, who had a long record but never had been
prosecuted for a drug offense.
   The judge said Walker's defiant display of wealth justified the
maximum sentence.
   Gray appealed the sentence. With time off for good behavior,
Walker could be released in 13{ years.

<TEXT>
   The State Department expressed alarm on
Tuesday about ``the rising tide of violence'' in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip as it offered its first public comment about recent
assassinations of Arabs accused of collaborating with Israeli
occupation troops.
   The killings of Palestinians by other Palestinians, occurring
amid the backdrop of the uprising in the occupied territories, have
increased after a Palestinian underground group issued a call for
stepped-up action against collaborators.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the killings
on either side ``frustrate the search for peace.''
   The Palestinians attacked as collaborators were accused of
working with the Israeli army, the occupation administration or the
Israeli intelligence service.
   Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens has accused the Palestine
Liberation Organization of conducting a ``wave of terror'' to
undermine Israel's proposal for elections in the occupied
territories.
   Israel plans to hold elections among the 1.4 million
Palestinians on the West Bank and Gaza to choose leaders to
negotiate an interim self-rule arrangement. Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir has barred negotiating with the PLO, which last year
declared a Palestinian state.
   President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III have
endorsed the proposal as a step toward an overall settlement of the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Asked about the killings, State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler said:
   ``We are alarmed by the rising tide of violence, and are shocked
by the increasing human toll in the West Bank and Gaza.''
   The spokeswoman pointed out that during the past two weeks, 20
Palestinians have been killed and about 200 others wounded in
clashes with the Israeli Defense Forces.
   ``Fourteen Palestinians have been killed by other Palestinians
during the same period. These actions by both sides frustrate the
search for peace,'' Ms. Tutwiler added.
   She said the United States urges all sides to ``exercise
restraint and replace violence with a climate conducive to
political dialogue.''
   Asked if the killings could make it more difficult for Israel to
conduct the elections, Ms. Tutwiler said ``any type'' of violence
was ``not conductive to moving the peace process forward.''
   Some 458 Palestinians and 18 Israelis have died since the
uprising began in December 1987.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa will visit the
United States for the first time in November to address an AFL-CIO
convention, federation leaders said Tuesday.
   Walesa has been denied permission in the past to visit the
United States but an adviser in Washington to attend the spring
meeting of the AFL-CIO's governing body said Walesa would be
allowed to travel to the convention.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland, whose efforts to visit Walesa
in Poland have also been stymied by Warsaw, has accepted a
reciprocal invitation to visit Poland next year, a Kirkland
spokesman said.
   Kirkland said that, with the Polish government's recent
recognition of Solidarity and announced plans for democratic
election reforms, the AFL-CIO will support Bush administration
plans to give new economic aid to Poland.
   The federation's support, he said, was dependent ``on continued
progress in the area of human rights.''
   Still, while calling the apparent approval of Walesa's U.S.
visit a welcome step, Kirkland could not disguise his contempt for
the Polish government, which had outlawed Solidarity since its
inception in the early 1980s.
   ``I don't give a damn about the backing of the Polish
government,'' Kirkland said when asked whether Walesa would be
addressing the convention as a representative of Warsaw. ``He is
not an emissary of his government. I'm not interested in dealing
with emissaries of his government. He, all his life, has been a
fighter for free and independent trade unionism and that's what he
represents and what he stands for in the world today.''
   Jacek Kuron, a Walesa adviser and candidate for Parliament in
the June 6 Polish elections, met with the AFL-CIO executive council
Tuesday afternoon to discuss the Walesa visit and ways U.S. unions
could assist Solidarity.
   AFL-CIO spokesman Rex Hardesty said that support in the past has
been limited because Solidarity was banned but has included basic
printing and office supplies.
   Now, Hardesty said, the federation and a number of its member
unions were interested in providing Solidarity with additional
financial support and equipment as it works to recruit members and
support candidates in elections.

   The Bush administration asked Congress on
Tuesday for authority to give away weapons to help Western
Hemisphere armies fight drug traffickers.
   Lt. Gen. Charles W. Brown, head of the Defense Security
Assistance Agency, said weapons furnished without charge would be
``excess defense articles.'' He told the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee that they would be given to military forces in Latin
America and the Caribbean.
   He said the administration is asking $21 million for the purpose
in the year that begins Oct. 1, beyond the present spending level.
   ``The biggest increase in this group is for Colombia, where the
activities of drug barons and insurgent groups, sometimes working
together, threaten the very survival of the legal system and
democratic government,'' he said.
   He added that the next largest increase would go to Peru because
it is in a similar situation, and there would also be increases for
Bolivia and the eastern Caribbean. Drug traffickers often use
Caribbean islands as relay points for drugs from South America.
   His prepared testimony did not mention Mexico, another major
source of narcotics. Nor did it list the arms to be given under the
new program.
   The ``intention would be to make equipment available at the
low-tech end of the spectrum, (that is) basic military equipment
suitable for use in low-intensity conflict against drug
traffickers,'' he said.
   Brown said that U.S. efforts at cooperation had been mostly with
local police, with occasional use of U.S. military transport.
   ``We believe that local military forces are ready to and must
take a larger role in these efforts,'' he added.
   ``They are the only forces large enough to do it; they have the
infrastructure; they can act as a disciplined and trained force,
and it is far better that they take this role rather than U.S.
combat forces.''
   At home the Pentagon has resisted any move to have its forces
take part in drug arrests or investigations, though it cooperates
in the battle against narcotics by lending its equipment to law
enforcement agencies.
   Brown said that in Latin America, the armed forces need U.S.
money for equipment, training and support if they are to do more
against drugs.
   ``This is not to say that the military can supplant the local
police forces, but they have a role to play,'' he added.
   He noted that the Colombian and Peruvian forces are also
fighting insurgents who have roots and objectives independent of
drug dealers, though he said there are tactical alliances between
them.

<HEAD>EPA Proposes to Limit Drinking Water Pollutants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency proposed
on Tuesday to limit the maximum amounts of 38 types of
cancer-causing chemicals and other pollutants found in drinking
water, a move that will cause increases in household water bills.
   But the EPA said it can't meet a congressional deadline on two
dozen other water pollutants because it is short of money and staff.
   The 38 chemicals, including many widely used pesticides and
other highly toxic carcinogens, must be monitored and kept below
the required levels in all public drinking water under the EPA
regulations issued Tuesday. The rules will be made final after a
period for public comment.
   Michael Cook, director of the EPA office which deals with
drinking water contaminants, said most public water systems already
meet the proposed requirements, but additional purification
equipment will probably be needed in about 2,500 public systems,
most of them in rural areas.
   In some cases, a household water bill could go up as much as
$460 a year, although the increase will generally be much lower,
Cook said. The additional costs will chiefly be because of
equipment.
   The EPA estimated that the cost of public water in areas where
additional pollution controls are required could increase from $10
to $460 a year, depending on the size of the water system and the
contaminant and treatment technology involved.
   The water systems likely to be in violation of the federal
standard will account for roughly 3 percent of all the water
systems in the country and provide water for 2 million people, said
Cook.
   Private wells are not covered by the regulations.
   Cook said that when the regulations, covering 17 pesticides and
21 other pollutants, take effect, the EPA will have established
maximum allowable levels for 55 of 83 dangerous drinking water
contaminants singled out for action by Congress nearly three years
ago.
   Many of those federal standards probably will not go into effect
for another year or more, however.
   Three years ago, Congress told the EPA to establish federal
standards on all 83 pollutants by June 1 of this year, but Cook
said the agency won't be able to meet the deadline on the 28
remaining chemicals. He said the process is expected to take
another year as maximum safe levels and water treatment techniques
for each of the remaining contaminants are worked out.
   ``If we had more money and manpower we could have sped those
(calculations) up,'' said Cook, blaming agency budget constraints
and staff shortages for not being able to meet the deadline.
   The proposed standards cover 17 pesticides including alachlor,
aldicarb and atrazine, which are widely used in agriculture; 11
synthetic organic chemicals that have been found to cause cancer or
damage to the nervous system; and eight inorganic chemicals,
including asbestos, mercury, cadmium, nitrates and nitrites; and
two chemicals used to treat drinking water.
   The regulations also will require local water officials to
monitor the chemical levels in their water supply, at times as
frequently as every three months, and to make public those
occasions when the federal standards are exceeded.
   While most of the nation's water supply is already thought to be
in compliance with the federal standards, Cook said about 2,500
small, mostly rural water systems likely will violate the
regulations unless they install additional equipment.
   Officials operating about 80,000 water systems likely will have
to increase monitoring activities to comply with the federal rules.
   The requirements ``are important steps in the continuing effort
to assure that Americans have the safest drinking water in the
world,'' said Cook.
   But some EPA critics maintained that the regulations, while slow
in coming, are also too weak.
   Jacqueline Warren, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, said the maximum levels required by the EPA is
significantly higher than ceilings already required by a number of
states.
   Furthermore, she said, the EPA is lifting some water pollutant
standards, including the ones for aluminum and silver. Both pose
health risks, she said.

<HEAD>Damaged Gun Turret Can Be Fixed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A team of Navy specialists has concluded that
the gun turret aboard the battleship Iowa damaged in last month's
deadly explosion can be repaired, but no decision has been made to
do so, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   Dan Howard, the Defense Department's chief spokesman, said a
35-member Navy damage control team began its work aboard the
battleship last week by determining that the materials and
expertise are available to repair the turret.
   The answer to that basic question had not been clear in the
immediate aftermath of the April 19 tragedy because of the vessel's
age. The Iowa was commissioned in 1943 during World War II and no
vessel of its type has been built since that war.
   Forty-seven sailors died in the explosion inside the No. 2 gun
turret while they were loading a 16-inch gun with powder.
   The fact that repairs are technically feasible, however, does
not mean the Navy has decided to make repairs, Howard said. No cost
estimate has been developed yet nor is any estimate available on
how long such repairs might take, he said.
   The Iowa's skipper, Capt. Fred P. Moosally, has said the vessel
would be ready for battle even if the damaged turret was never
repaired. The huge battleship still has two other turrets, each
with three 16-inch guns.
   ``Preliminary examination indicates that it can be repaired,''
Howard said Tuesday. ``But there are a lot of factors that go into
(a final decision).
   ``It's too early yet to give you either a cost estimate or the
amount of time it would take to make repairs. All I can give you is
the preliminary judgment that they can repair it.''
   The spokesman said one of the first indications repairs might be
feasible came recently when the huge guns above the damaged turret
were swung back on centerline, using their own internal machinery.
   In related developments, Howard said the battleship had been
moved to a new anchorage near Norfolk, Va., to unload the gunpowder
and shells from the damaged turret.
   ``You may recall that as part of the safety procedures, they
flooded the magazine on the ship immediately following the
explosion. Now they have to take out the powder and projectiles to
examine them and see if they were damaged by the water.''
   The spokesman also said he had investigated, but could not
confirm, a published report that one of the Iowa's victims issued a
terse verbal warning that there was ``a problem'' just before the
blast.
   The Washington Post said Tuesday a crew member reportedly made
the comment over a sound-activated phone circuit just before the
explosion, saying: ``Uh, oh. We've got a problem here.''
   ``I can't get any corroboration for that story,'' Howard said.
``I just don't know.''

<HEAD>Probe Into Aborigine Deaths Looks At Why More Go To Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Tuesday broadened a
probe into the deaths of aborigines in police custody to discover
why proportionately more of the native people than other
Australians end up in jail.
   The Royal Commission of Inquiry said it was concerned by
government statistics that show aborigines, about 1 percent of the
16 million population, are six times more likely to go to jail than
white Australians.
   ``While investigation of aboriginal deaths in custody is
important, so too is learning the lessons of the past and acting to
prevent further deaths,'' said Elliott Johnston, who is heading the
inquiry.
   Johnston, a lawyer, this week replaced judge James Muirhead on
the commission, which was established by Prime Minister Bob Hawke
in mid-1987.
   Muirhead, in an interim report issued in December, urged states
to abolish drunkenness as a criminal offense, indicating this was
perhaps a chief reason aborigines were arrested. In February, the
government pledged the equivalent of $8 million to set up
drying-out facilities as an alternative to jail for people arrested
on drinking charges.
   The commission is investigating the deaths while in police
custody of 104 aborigines between 1980 and May 31, 1987. Some
activists blame police brutality, and others have said the jailing
causes despair, which often leads to suicide, Johnston said.
   Conclusions will be reached by year's end, he said.
   In Adelaide, a spokeswoman for the South Australian Aboriginal
Deaths in Custody Watch Committee criticized the commission's May
31 cutoff date.
   ``The cut-off date must be when there are no more deaths so
justice can be seen to have happened,'' said Mrs. Alice Dixon,
whose 19-year-old aboriginal son died in custody in 1987.
   Aborigines are Australia's original inhabitants, settling the
continent 40,000 years ago.

   Two couples checked in at Pennsylvania
lottery headquarters Tuesday to claim a share of a North American
record jackpot of $115.5 million, leaving only one of the 14
winning tickets unaccounted for.
   The 12th and 13th ticketholders included a naturalized American
couple from China, Alex and Typin Mark of Wayne, a Philadelphia
suburb. They said they would use their winnings to educate their
three children and quit their jobs.
   Mark said he would ``invest the money and live comfortably for
the rest of my life.''
   Also presenting a ticket from the April 26 drawing were Ray and
Diane Novotny, both 46, of the Philadelphia suburb of Malvern. They
refused to talk with reporters.
   Lottery spokeswoman Terry Murphy said the Novotnys had bought 50
tickets and let the computer pick the numbers. Novotny would not
tell lottery officials where he worked.
   Each winning ticket is worth $8.3 million, to be paid in 26
annual installments of $317,524.67 before taxes.
   The remaining ticket holder has until April 26, 1990, to claim a
share of the Super 7 prize.
   Mark said he will leave his job as a mechanical engineer at the
Philadelphia Navy Yard, where he has worked for 27 years. He said
his wife already quit her job at a Chinese restaurant.
   Both are 56 and came from Canton, China. Mark has been in the
United States since 1947 and his wife has been here since 1950.
   Mark said he waited until Tuesday to come forward because he
wanted to check with a lawyer and plan what to do with the money.
Mark said he bought 30 tickets and let the computer pick the
numbers. He usually spends $5 a week on the lottery.
   Ms. Murphy said validation of the winning tickets should be
completed later this week, and the first checks presented next week.
   Other unofficial winners in the jackpot so far include 14
workers from a Windham, Ohio, brick factory; a 74-year-old widow
from Lebanon, Pa., and a chiropractor and his wife from New
Brighton.

<HEAD>Democrats Launch Drive to Wean Farmers From Pesticides, Fertilizers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Democrats launched a campaign Tuesday
to wean American farmers from dependence on pesticides and
fertilizers, arguing that new practices are needed to protect food
and water from chemical contamination.
   The centerpiece of their effort is legislation sponsored by Sen.
Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., and endorsed at a news conference by Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine, Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and 23 farm
and environmental groups.
   Fowler, chairman of the agriculture subcommittee on conservation
and forestry, said the goal is to provide, through the 1990 farm
bill, programs to give incentives to farmers who voluntarily reduce
reliance on chemicals.
   ``There have been methods, time proven for 3,000 years, where a
proper combination of conservation practices, stewardship
practices, crop rotation practices, along with an appropriate use
of chemicals and fertilizers ... have proven effective,'' he said.
   The legislation would require that the Department of Agriculture
inform farmers about advances in low-input farming, integrated pest
management and any other practice reducing reliance on chemicals
without sacrificing production.
   It also would remove existing disincentives in federal farm
programs that prevent farmers from taking advantage of new,
low-input farming methods, and it would provide incentives to
encourage farmers to make the transition from an overreliance on
chemicals to low-input methods.
   ``For too long, industry and agriculture policies have promoted
practices that degrade our natural and agricultural resources and
pose threats to the health of our people,'' Fowler said. ``We have
already waited longer than we should to reverse this trend and
restore American agriculture to a safe, sound course for the
future.''
   Both Fowler and Mitchell said they expect farmers eventually
will support the legislation, even though the transition might
initially reduce crop yields and profits.
   ``Farm families will benefit from this bill,'' Mitchell said.
``By helping to reduce pesticide use, this legislation will help
protect the quality of drinking water in rural areas.''
   The bill would create a drinking water well-testing program to
detect contamination by pesticides or nitrates. In areas where
testing finds contamination, federal aid would be provided to help
farmers establish groundwater protection plans.
   Mitchell said encouraging farmers to reduce use of pesticides
and fertilizers also will help protect the nation's food supply.
   ``While the vast majority of our food products are free of
pesticide contamination, we must do everything we can to expand and
improve our food quality programs,'' he said. ``This bill will take
us in that direction.''

   Corrosion of the nuclear reactor aboard a
Soviet submarine that sank off Norway April 7 may eventually lead
to the release of huge amounts of radioactivity, the environmental
group Greenpeace said Tuesday.
   The group said a study done for it by John Large and Associates,
a nuclear engineering consulting firm in London, concluded that the
submarine may release up to 20 million curies of radioactivity if
the vessel is not recovered.
   That is equal to about one-third of the radiation released by
the April 1986 explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in
the Soviet Ukraine, Greenpeace said. Thirty-one people died in the
Chernobyl accident.
   The Soviet submarine caught fire and sank in 5,000 feet of water
off northern Norway. Soviet officials said 42 of the 69 sailors on
board were killed.
   Moscow said earlier this month that a decision on whether to
attempt to raise the sub will not be made for several months. It
said the vessel's two nuclear reactors were shut down before the
crew evacuated and that there was no danger of radiation leaks. But
Greenpeace took issue with that assertion.
   ``Even if the reactor containment structures weren't damaged by
the fire, the collision with the ocean floor or the deep water
pressure, the protective structure will erode before the reactors
are safe,'' said Steve Shallhorn, a Greenpeace representative.

   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's trip to the
United States this week puts the spotlight back on the Canada-U.S.
free trade agreement while his government faces heated debate over
efforts to cut the budget deficit.
   He receives an award Wednesday in Boston from the private World
Affairs Council, in large part for his role in leading Canada to
sign the sweeping trade agreement that eases investment barriers
and phases out all remaining tariffs between Canada and the United
States over the next decade.
   On Thursday, he visits the White House, where he will meet with
President Bush for the second time this year. The talks are
expected to concentrate on the trade pact and acid rain, always a
major topic in Canadian-U.S. relations.
   Mulroney led his Progressive Conservative Party to a second
consecutive majority government last fall in a campaign dominated
by the issue of whether to proceed with the trade agreement he
signed in January 1988 with President Ronald Reagan.
   With Mulroney's victory clinching the way for the pact to take
effect as scheduled Jan. 1, the attention of the prime minister and
other senior officials turned to the budget deficit, which is
higher per capita in Canada than in the United States.
   His opponents, who charged that free trade would force Canada to
cut its traditional network of social protection for its
population, now say the election did not give Mulroney a mandate to
tackle the soaring public debt.
   ``It is a full-scale, all-out assault on the weak, the poor, the
disadvantaged, the dispossessed,'' Liberal Party leader John Turner
said after the budget for the 1989-90 fiscal year was released last
week.
   ``This budget is proof that nothing they said, nothing the prime
minister committed himself and his government to during the last
election, is true,'' Turner said.
   The budget raises taxes and cuts federal spending in areas from
the military to rail service and child care plans, although it
still leaves a deficit of $25.6 billion. Among the most unexpected
steps was the elimination of the controversial program to spend
$6.7 billion for a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines.
   The prime minister has said repeatedly that the effort to bring
the deficit under control is critical to Canada's future.
   ``Only by measures to reduce the burden of the debt can
Canadians avoid a repetition of the excessive unemployment and
inflation rates of the early 1980s,'' he wrote in the speech that
opened the new session of Parliament last month.
   The debt now stands at $273 billion after the government ran a
$25.2 billion deficit in the 1988-89 fiscal year. The amount is
about 5 percent of gross domestic product, about double the U.S.
ratio.
   Bush made Ottawa his first foreign stop after his inauguration
with a half-day visit to meet with Mulroney in February. The U.S.
leader promised to move quickly with congressional legislation to
control acid rain, which Canada blames for killing 14,000 lakes in
the eastern part of the country.
   The two nations are each other's largest trading partner, with
two-way trade amounting to more than $150 billion annually.

<HEAD>Report Says Half of America's Children Take Medicines Improperly.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly half of the nation's children are
taking or being given medicines improperly, according to a report
Tuesday that called the misuse ``America's other drug problem.''
   The report by the National Council on Patient Information and
Education said parents, physicians and pharmcists must communicate
better about safe and effective use of medicines, and children must
be educated about the importance of taking prescription and
over-the-counter medicines properly.
   Health Secretary Louis Sullivan and Food and Drug Administration
Commissioner Frank Young, who joined council officials at a news
conference, endorsed the council's campaign to educate health care
providers, parents and schools about the problem.
   Studies show that 46 percent of the time, ``children, or their
parents, are either administering too much of a medicine, stopping
the medication too soon, not taking enough or the medicine or not
taking the medicine at all,'' Sullivan said.
   This misuse is occurring not only for minor afflictions but for
serious illnesses, including cancer, kidney disease and other
chronic conditions, he said.
   The conditions for which medicines are most likely to be
administered improperly are asthma and epilepsy, the two most
common chronic diseases for which children take medication, Young
said.
   The report said studies have shown that up to 4.6 percent of
pediatric hospital admissions are related to medicine use, and up
to 44 percent of those problems are severe or fatal.
   In a typical two-week period, 13 million children take medicines
prescribed or recommended by a physician, said the report, titled
``Children and America's Other Drug Problem.''
   Young said the misuse of medicines is ``a major problem in the
health care of children,'' but requiring package inserts for
prescription medicines with specific directions for use would
probably not help.
   Detailed directions already included in over-the-counter
medicines haven't improved compliance, he said.
   ``This is everybody's problem,'' said Young. ``There's a lot of
parental responsibility, physician responsibility, and I don't want
to leave out the pharmacists ... and the media focusing on this as
well.
   ``I don't think a simple package insert will solve the
problem,'' he said. ``This is an attitudinal and behavior problem
in the whole health care system.''

   The United States is discussing with the
troubled West German government a potential compromise to the
dispute over short-range nuclear missiles that involves development
of a non-nuclear West German rocket, U.S. officials said Tuesday.
   The missile could target airfields and other Warsaw Pact
military installations now covered by the nuclear-armed Lances that
Chancellor Helmut Kohl is trying to persuade NATO to scale back and
eventually eliminate.
   The West German government decided in February to suspend
research and development of the FK90, which is classified as a
tactical weapon with a range below 300 miles. But in seeking a
compromise in the dispute over the Lance missile, going ahead with
the German missile is under discussion, said the officials, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Gen. Henning von Ondarza, the commander-in-chief of the West
German army, is in Washington holding talks at the Pentagon and the
State Department on options intended to ease the strains in the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Britain has lined up with the United States in trying to
persuade Kohl to agree to expand the range of the aging Lance and
to drop his demand for U.S. negotiations with the Soviets on
reducing short-range nuclear weapons. Norway, Denmark and other
NATO countries are siding with West Germany.
   The non-nuclear missile, known also as Technex, was supposed to
be co-produced with the United States.
   Gro Harlem Brundtland, the prime minister of Norway, is visiting
Washington and said she would discuss nuclear issues with President
Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III when they meet
Wednesday at the White House.
   ``I think what we need now is to look for the common ground,
look for what will be a sensible and coherent way of handling the
issues of both arms control and disarmament,'' she said Tuesday at
a news conference.
   Failure to heal the rift could cloud Bush's summit meeting in
Brussels May 29-30 with the leaders of the NATO countries.
   Another option is to have NATO make unilateral cuts in its
short-range nuclear weapons while challenging the Soviets to meet
the lower levels, U.S. and NATO officials said.
   NATO is already retiring tactical nuclear artillery weapons.
Cutting back on the Lances _ after the range of the missile is more
than tripled to about 250 miles _ was suggested in a recent study
by U.S. Gen. John Galvin, the alliance's supreme military commander
in Europe.
   The idea was quietly proposed to Kohl's government several weeks
ago, but the chancellor persisted in demanding a delay in
modernizing the Lances for three years and speedy U.S. negotiations
with the Soviets over them, U.S. officials said.
   Kohl, who is up for re-election next year, is under considerable
political pressure from a West German electorate with growing
concern over the concentration of nuclear weapons in the country.
   The development of a non-nuclear missile might ease some of
those pressures and also permit NATO to get by with fewer Lances, a
U.S. official said.
   In Brussels, a NATO official who insisted on anonymity said the
U.S. proposal for unilateral reductions after the Lances are made
more potent was designed ``for a working document for how to
proceed on the issue.'' Presumably it would be taken up by Bush and
the other allied leaders at the summit meeting.
   The Western nations are trying to present a united front while
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev carries out unilateral cuts
in Soviet defense spending and armored divisions and troops in
Eastern Europe.
   The Bush administration considers Gorbachev's initiatives and
the inroads they appear to be making in West European public
opinion one of the biggest challenges to U.S. foreign policy.
   NATO defense ministers, at a nuclear strategy session last
month, gave only lukewarm backing to the Lance modernization
program, saying nuclear forces ``must be kept up-to-date where
necessary.''
   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said he was satisfied with
the endorsement and was ``reasonably confident'' Congress would
provide more money to continue development of the new generation
Lance.
   There are currently 88 Lance launchers, most of which are based
in West Germany. Officials have said the Warsaw Pact outnumbers
NATO by about 12-to-1 in short-range nuclear missile launchers.
   The alliance contends it needs to maintain its nuclear stockpile
to balance a superiority the East has built up in conventional arms.
   NATO and the seven Warsaw Pact countries began talks in March on
cutting conventional forces in Europe.

<HEAD>Arab League Leader Complains of Baker Position on PLO, WHO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Secretary of State James A. Baker's threat to
cut all U.S. financial support to the World Health Organization if
it admits the PLO is ``beyond comprehension,'' a representative of
the Arab League complained on Tuesday.
   Clovis Maksoud, Arab League representative to the United States
and United Nations, said in a statement that Baker's position was
``deeply regrettable.''
   On Monday, Baker said he would recommend to President Bush that
the United States withhold contributions to any U.N. organization
that votes to admit the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Baker argued that PLO admission would harm the Middle East peace
process and the U.N. itself.
   The PLO has applied for full membership in the WHO, the U.N.
agency that oversees health programs around the globe. The
166-member organization is due to vote on the matter next week in
Geneva.
   Meanwhile, Hiroshi Nakajima, the head of the organization,
visited the State Department to discuss the matter, according to
department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   Ms. Tutwiler said Nakajima, a Japanese physician, met with the
acting assistant secretary of state for international
organziations, N. Charles Smith.
   Nakajima also met with some of more than 50 members of Congress
who have written a letter to Baker saying they favored cutting off
funds to the WHO or any other U.N. agency that admitted the PLO.
   Nakajima has said he has tried to persuade PLO Chairman Yasser
Arafat to withdraw the application, apparently as a means to defuse
the situation.
   Maksoud, of the Arab League, argued in his statement that
inclusion of the PLO would contribute to the WHO's ``universality
and effectiveness,'' and that the PLO was seeking ``to benefit from
membership in these humanitarian agencies.''
   ``The threat `to make no further contribution, voluntary or
assessed,' might be the language of a big power but not the
parlance of a great power. We in the Arab world would want to
preserve our assessment of the great United States,'' Maksoud's
statement said.
   The United States pays about 25 percent of World Health
Organization expenses. This amounted to about $150 million in the
past two years.
   The PLO is recognized by all 21 Arab governments as the
legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.
   Last year, the PLO declared statehood on land held by Israel.
However, the State Department contends the PLO is not a state,
failing to meet the criteria of being a state, such as control of
territory.

<HEAD>Administration Reviewing High Seas Boarding Policy</HEAD>

   The Bush administration is reviewing its
policy on boarding foreign vessels on the high seas after U.S.
personnel were barred for three days from searching a Taiwanese
ship suspected of illegal salmon fishing, a State Department
official said Tuesday.
   Ed Wolfe, the State Department's ambassador for oceans and
fisheries, told a House subcommittee that an inter-agency task
force was examining the policy, which allows for the boarding of a
foreign vessel only after receiving permission from the government
whose flag the ship flies.
   ``Because of the recent incident invovling Taiwan, we are
reviewing our high-seas boarding policy,'' Wolfe said. ``I am
confident we will come up with something.''
   Wolfe said the United States has jurisdiction over such fish as
salmon that were born in U.S. waters and return there to spawn
after several years in the ocean.
   ``The problem is what we do with that jurisdiction,'' Wolfe said
during a hearing before the fisheries, wildlife conservation and
environment subcommittee of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries
Committee.
   Wolfe said the present policy is based on ``customary
international law'' and in a brief interview after the hearing
declined to discuss possible alternatives.
   ``We are exploring various possibilities,'' Wolfe said.
   Northwest lawmakers said that fishermen in Alaska, Washington
and Oregon are becomming increasingly angry over what the illegal
catch of U.S. salmon by foreign driftnet fleets from Tawian, South
Korean and Japan.
   Alaska Republican Rep. Don Young said the only way to get the
attention of the three countries with driftnet fleets would be to
impose trade sanctions.
   Coast Guard Rear Adm. Ted Leland told the subcommittee that U.S.
personnel who boarded the Taiwanese vessel in the North Pacific
last month found ``no conclusive evidence'' it had been illegally
fishing for salmon.
   The cutter Jarvis shadowed the Taiwanese ship for more than 700
miles before Coast Guard personnel were given permission from the
government of Tawian to board. Efforts to find the ship's net,
which was abandoned after the vessel was first spotted by the
Jarvis, were unsucessful.
   Under various diplomatic agreements, driftnet fishing has been
limited to areas well away from the migration routes of salmon.
   Since Congress enacted a law in late 1987, the State Department
has been trying to negotiate driftnet monitoring and enforcement
agreements with each of the three countries.
   If such agreements are not concluded by June 29, the president
can then impose trade restrictions on imports of fish products from
those countries.
   American fishermen claim that vessels from Taiwan, South Korea
and Japan are using driftnets to illegally snare millions of tons
of salmon under the guise of squid fishing. Fishing groups have
said the illegal fishing has already affected salmon runs in
Alaska, Washington and Oregon.
   An estimated 700 fishing boats from Taiwan, South Korea and
Japan use driftnets, which can stretch 35 miles in length and cover
more than 30,000 square miles of ocean on any given day.
   Environmentalists have likened driftnet fishing to clear cutting
a forest and charge the nets are responsible for the deaths of
thousands of porpoises, seals, seabirds and other marine life
annually.

<HEAD>Conference Asks Total Ban on Ozone-Destroying CFCs by Century End</HEAD>

   A world conference demanded on Tuesday
a total ban on production of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons by
the end of the century.
   The representatives from 86 countries also asked for an
international fund to help Third World countries replace
environmentally hazardous equipment.
   The resolution adopted at the U.N.-sponsored conference advanced
the timetable of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which requires
industrial nations to cut production of chlorofluorocarbons, or
CFCs, to half of 1986 levels by 1999.
   The declaration said developing countries should be helped in
finding and financing alternatives to CFCs, which are used in
refrigeration, cleaning, aerosol cans and other industrial products.
   The resolution was drafted by Finland and was accepted with
unexpected speed on opening day of a scheduled four-day meeting of
government ministers and experts, which was called to bring the
Montreal document up to date.
   The ozone layer ranges from nine to 18 miles high. It is the
atmospheric layer within the stratosphere in which an appreciable
concentration of ozone gas occurs, absorbing much ultraviolet
radiation and preventing some heat loss from Earth.
   Scientists say the destruction of the ozone layer is causing
increased skin cancer and eye damage and poses a danger to the
world's food chain.
   Environmentalists said depletion of the ozone layer is occurring
at a much faster rate than foreseen when the Montreal Protocol was
signed.
   Finnish President Mauno Koivisto said in his opening speech,
``The industrial nations must spend much more on new technologies
and be prepared to transfer applicable technologies and knowhow to
the developing countries.''
   As the conference opened, police detained six Greenpeace
protesters outside the hall. Members of the environmental group
from Switzerland, Sweden and Finland had illegally placed a banner
reading ``Ozone Destroyers _ 100 Percent Halt Now'' on flagpoles
outside Finlandia Hall, police said.
   They were later released.
   The closed-door conference opened in disarray when the draft
declaration was leaked to reporters before delegates had a chance
to discuss it.
   The declaration called for agreement to phase out the dangerous
gases listed in the Montreal Protocol ``as soon as possible, but
not later than year 2000, and for that purpose to tighten the
timetable of the Montreal Protocol.''
   It urged all nations to join the 36 countries and the 12-nation
European Community that have ratified the document signed in
Montreal.
   Norway called for creation of an international climate fund
under United Nations auspices to make new technologies available to
developing countries.
   Norway's environment minister, Sissel Roenbeck said her country
would allocate to the fund 0.1 percent of its gross national
product, or about $88 million, provided other industrialized
countries do the same.
   The annual production of CFCs is 1.14 million tons, two thirds
of which is produced by the United States and Western Europe. Japan
produces about 12 percent of CFCs and the Soviet Union an estimated
10 percent.
   Differences between East and West on the causes of ozone
depletion were resolved at a separate meeting of scientists and
government officials last week, delegates said.

<HEAD>Consumer Activist Calls For Boycott of Exxon at Gas Pumps.</HEAD>

   Consumer activist Ralph Nader on Tuesday said
Exxon Corp. ``should not be allowed to forget'' the Alaskan oil
spill and called for a consumer boycott of the giant oil company's
products.
   Nader joined representatives from several environmental and
consumer groups in denouncing Exxon for its failure to be prepared
for and rapidly respond to the oil spill that has fouled hundreds
of square miles of pristine water and shoreline along Alaska's
southern coast.
   ``Exxon should not be allowed to forget this oil spill,'' said
Nader, suggesting Exxon and the entire petroleum industry must be
made aware of public outrage over the spill.
   ``Americans can take action now by voting with their steering
wheel and dollars against all Exxon products,'' Nader said at a
news conference called in connection with a protest against the oil
company in several cities across the nation.
   An Exxon spokesman, Bill Smith, said in a telephone interview
from New York that more than 10,000 Exxon credit cards have been
turned in since the Alaska spill, but he could not speculate on how
the spill has affected Exxon sales.
   There are about 7 million Exxon credit cards in circulation,
Smith said.
   Other groups represented at the press conference included
Citizen Action, a consumer organization that often deal with
petroleum related issues; the Environmental Policy Institute, a
coalition of three environmental groups; Public Citizen and U.S.
Public Interest Research Group, both advocacy groups founded by
Nader; and Clean Water Action, an environmental group.
   Brent Blackwelder, chairman of the League of Conservation
Voters, a lobbying organization that represents a variety of
environmental groups, suggested that a successful boycott of Exxon
products would also send a message to Congress.
   ``From the original authorization of the Alaska oil pipeline in
1973 ... to the current state of affairs in which Exxon is making
taxpayers and consumers pay for its negligence, the damaging role
of big oil's big money in American politics is all too apparent,''
said Blackwelder.
   Before a boycott is ended, the consumer and environmental groups
said Exxon must pay all damage and cleanup costs from the spill
into Alaska's Prince William Sound; establish an additional $1
billion trust fund for environmental protection in Alaska; promise
to conduct no oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
if it's opened for oil and gas development; and pay for development
of safer oil tanks and better spill contingency programs.
   Although oil industry leaders have said rising gasoline prices
are not directly related to the spill, Nader called on Exxon to
roll back recent price increases.

<HEAD>Skinner Says Nature Can Do Some Spill Cleanup</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said
Tuesday that some of the Alaskan oil spill will have to be left to
the cleansing forces of nature, but he said an all-out cleanup
effort still is needed.
   Skinner, who is to make his second trip to Alaska Wednesday as
overall coordinator for cleanup of the March 24 oil tanker spill,
said he expected forces involved in the effort to double or triple
in size by the end of the month.
   In a speech at the National Press Club, Skinner called the
spilling of 11 million gallons of crude oil into Prince William
Sound ``the most significant environmental disaster this nation has
ever faced.'' But he said the cleanup operation, to be paid for by
the oil industry, could add $100 million to $500 million to
Alaska's economy, which he said is more than the effect of the
fishing industry.
   Skinner said he would reserve judgment on Exxon's latest plans
for the cleanup, which include burning and burying recovered sludge
and leaving some lightly soiled beaches to the cleansing forces of
nature.
   The plan requires the approval of the Coast Guard commandant,
Adm. Paul A. Yost, who criticized some aspects of it Tuesday as
thin. The transportation secretary, who oversees the Coast Guard,
said he would decide within a week whether to approve the plan.
   Skinner said that on some beaches, ``nature will do its work,''
but he said the state and Exxon will have to focus all summer on
cleaning up as much as possible.
   ``My position is that we can't do enough (cleaning up,)'' he
said. ``If it's anywhere close to being a viable opiton, we ought
to do it.''
   Skinner cautioned against cleanup efforts that may do damage to
the environment, but did not point to any specific plan of Exxon.
   ``When you are dealing in an area that is remote and has a lot
of nature at work, you want to be sure you don't cross the line,''
he said.
   ``The oil industry will have to demonstrate that it is capable
of cleaning up its mess,'' Skinner said. ``If they don't, it will
be very difficult for them to develop domestic reserves.''
   The secretary said he was traveling to Alaska with officials
from the Coast Guard, White House and Congress.

   A masked gunman burst into a gift shop
Tuesday and critically wounded PLO chief Yasser Arafat's personal
representative to Lebanon, police said.
   Issam Salem, the Palestine Liberation Organization's top
official in Lebanon, was in critical condition and undergoing
surgery to remove a bullet from his head, doctors said.
   PLO officials in Paris, where Arafat met with France's President
Francois Mitterrand, initially said Salem, 48, died in the attack.
Arafat later said Salem was in a coma.
   ``We must not let ourselves be terrorized by this incident but
do all we can to put into effect the Arab resolutions on Lebanon,''
Arafat said, referring to an Arab League call for a truce in the
country's 14-year-old civil war.
   The latest outbreak has pitted Christian forces against an
alliance of Syrian soldiers and Druse Moslem militiamen.
   Arafat said he thought the shooting was ``a message for us to
put up our hands and stop helping our Lebanese brothers.''
   The PLO chief, who has longstanding differences with Syria, had
voiced support for the Christians in the current fighting, which
police say has killed 278 people and wounded 1,010.
   A police spokesman in Sidon, a port city 25 miles south of
Beirut, said the attack came after Salem got out of his white
Mercedes and entered a gift store on Fakhreddine Street. His two
bodyguards waited in the car.
   ``A lone assailant, wearing a plastic mask, stormed into the
shop shouting `Issam Salem.' When Salem turned to face the gunman,
he fired two 9mm bullets into Salem's head and shoulder and
escaped,'' said the spokesman, who cannot be identified under
police rules.
   The bodyguards chased the gunman but he disappeared in the
narrow alleys leading to Sidon's Ein Hilweh refugee camp, the
spokeman added.
   Salem was taken to Sidon's Hammoud hospital, where he underwent
surgery to remove the bullet that pierced the left side of his
forehead.
   ``He stands a 50-50 chance of making it, but even if he does he
will be suffering from a neurological defect,'' said one of the
surgeons, Dr. Hussein Mansour. ``That means possible partial
paralysis.''
   The police spokesman said there was no immediate information on
the gunman's identity.
   It was the second assassination attempt in four days against a
senior Arafat aide in Sidon.
   Zeid Wehbi, the official spokesman of Arafat's mainstream Fatah
guerrilla faction, escaped assassination Saturday when a
rocket-propelled grenade was fired at his house, wounding two
passers-by. He was not home at the time.
   There was no claim of responsibility for either attack.
   A senior PLO official, without making specific accusations, said
the attacks on Salem and Wehbi apparently were linked.
   ``The rapid succession of the two attempts indicates an
organized intelligence apparatus was out to eliminate Arafat's
men,'' said the official, who declined to be identified.
   Salem is married to Jihad Salameh, a sister of the late Hassan
Salameh, Arafat's personal security chief who was assassinated by a
remote-controlled bomb in Beirut on Jan. 19, 1979. Mrs. Salem sat
weeping at the hospital and refused to talk to reporters.
   About 5,000 PLO guerrillas who returned to Lebanon in recent
years are based in Sidon. The PLO was evacuated from Lebanon in
1982 following the Israeli invasion.
   Arafat's faction has many enemies apart from Israel. Among them
is Fatah-Revolutionary Council, a breakaway group led by terrorist
Abu Nidal, which has bases in the Ein El-Hilweh camp.
   Other anti-Arafat groups include the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command led by Ahmed Jibril and the
Fatah-Uprising faction headed by breakaway PLO Col. Saeed Mousa.
   All three factions have denounced Arafat's recognition of
Israel's right to exist in December and the PLO's ensuing talks
with the United States.

<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opponents complained of voting
irregularities, but it was clear Tuesday that most Paraguayans were
solidly behind the general who overthrew dictator Alfredo
Stroessner.
   Official returns gave Gen. Andres Rodriguez nearly three-fourths
of the vote for president in Monday's election, and his Colorado
Party won firm control of Congress.
   ``Half the vote for Rodriguez was a `thank you' for overthrowing
Stroessner,'' said Aldo Zuccolillo, editor of the newspaper ABC
Color. His paper resumed publishing in March, five years after
Stroessner's regime closed it.
   Susana Jara, a 50-year-old fruit vender at the Asuncion public
market, said: ``After 35 years of dictatorship, you could not
expect any other result because the people are very grateful to him
for putting his life in danger to bring us freedom.''
   Rodriguez, who has been provisional president since the coup
Feb. 3, said Tuesday he was ``pleased and happy that I have the
affection of the people and that they showed their confidence in
me.''
   ``Maybe there were small flaws,'' he said in response to
opposition charges of irregularities, ``but our intentions always
were the best and we wanted the general elections in Paraguay to be
free and clean.''
   Speaking to reporters at the national palace, he said the nine
Cabinet members he appointed immediately after the coup had offered
their resignations. He said no decision had been made on the
resignations.
   Fernando Vera, presidential candidate of the Revolutionary
Febrerista Party, said: ``In spite of the irregularities, I
recognize that he won and, I would say, it was a landslide
victory.''
   The Central Electoral Board said Tuesday that Rodriguez got
178,313 of the 240,379 votes counted for president, or 74.18
percent.
   Domingo Laino, a former national deputy who returned from exile
after the coup, was second with 43,148 votes, or 17.95 percent,
Vera was third and six other candidates divided the remainder, the
board announced.
   Rodriguez, 65, led by similar margins in unofficial tallies by
opposition parties and monitoring groups, also with Laino and Vera
running second and third respectively.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said the U.S. Embassy and international election observers saw
several instances of questionable, but not illegal procedures.
   She added, however, that U.S. diplomats saw no pattern of
``centrally directed fraud.''
   Rodriguez' coup ousted 76-year-old Stroessner a year after the
dictator won his eighth presidential term. Stroessner, also a
general, went into exile in Brazil.
   Voting Monday was for a successor to finish the five-year
presidential term and to fill the two houses of Congress, which
Rodriguez dissolved after the coup. The elections were the most
democratic this South American nation has held in decades.
   Partial official results gave the Colorado Party 156,247 votes,
or 66.43 percent, of the 235,203 counted for the 36-member Senate
and the Chamber of Deputies, which has 72 seats.
   Unofficial tallies gave a similar edge to the Colorados, who
have been in power since 1947 and were a bulwark of the Stroessner
regime.
   Under Paraguayan law, the party getting the most votes is
awarded two-thirds of the seats in Congress _ 24 in the Senate and
48 in the lower house.
   Rodriguez, the Colorado candidate, has pledged to reform the
constitution and electoral law and not to seek reelection.
   Laino and Vera were elected to the Senate. Both headed their
party slates for congressional seats in addition to running for
president.
   Flaws cited by international observers and party officials
included lack of privacy at some voting stations, ballots for all
parties not available everywhere, some registered voters not
permitted to cast ballots, indelible ink to prevent multiple voting
not always available or applied properly.
   No official figures on voter turnout were given. The election
board acknowledged before the election that the registration list
of 2.2 million voters in this nation of 4 million people might
contain up to 600,000 extra names.
   Paraguayans voted in large numbers, often standing patiently
outdoors on a drizzly day, chatting and drinking mate, a bitter
herbal tea.
   The president and new Congress are to be sworn in May 15.

   Legal workers seeking refugee status for
Salvadorans declared a small victory Tuesday after a judge ruled
that Salvadorans may not be deported from South Texas before being
apprised of their rights.
   U.S. District Judge David Kenyon in Los Angeles issued the
preliminary injunction made public Monday after finding the
Immigration and Naturalization Service violated his previous order
to provide Salvadorans access to legal counsel.
   ``This is a small victory,'' Jonathan Moore, a paralegal with
the Harlingen-based Central American legal advocacy group Proyecto
Libertad, said Tuesday. ``It's a recognition that there is a
problem. I think it's significant.''
   Both sides in the case said they expect the number of
Salvadorans actively fighting deportation to increase as a result
of the judge's order.
   In the injunction, Kenyon noted that none of 67 Salvadorans
deported April 20 from the INS minimum-security Port Isabel Service
Processing Center at Bayview near the Mexican border had lawyers at
their deportation hearings.
   ``The court finds it difficult to believe that each of these
individuals learned of and knowingly and effectively waived his or
her right to counsel,'' the judge said.
   The order is part of a 1982 class-action suit accusing the INS
of failing to provide Salvadorans access to legal representation.
The plaintiffs in March had asked that the INS be held in contempt
and ordered to comply.
   Friday's injunction remains in effect until a May 30 hearing.
   The 1,471 aliens detained at Bayview as of Monday included 495
Nicaraguans, 334 Salvadorans, 194 Hondurans and 173 Guatemalans.
   ``Basically, it says we won't be able to deport any Salvadorans
until one of the immigrant rights groups, Proyecto Libertad, has a
chance to talk to them as a body,'' said Duke Austin, an INS
spokesman in Washington.
   Austin said the INS has encouraged groups such as the American
Bar Association to provide legal representation for Salvadorans and
other detainees.
   Proyecto Libertad eadvocates refugee status for Salvadorans on
grounds that they are fleeing war and political persecution. The
United States deports most Salvadorans, ruling that they are coming
to this country for economic reasons only.
   Proyecto Libertad was designated by the plaintiffs to conduct
the legal briefings. Proyecto held its first session Monday night
for men at the Port Isabel center. A second session was held
Tuesday for the women, he said.
   ``Even though the INS is slowly complying, the judge recognizes
that for several months they have been out of compliance,'' said
Mark Schneider, a Proyecto attorney.
   ``Our concern is that for over two months, over 1,500 people
have been deported, many of whom were never advised of their
rights, who may have had strong cases,'' he said.
   U.S. officials have granted refugee status to only six
Salvadorans and 78 Nicaraguans in the Harlingen District since Feb.
21.
   The INS last month installed cellular telephones for the Bayview
detainees and added pay phones in an effort to comply.

<TEXT>
   Prisoners awaiting trial smashed down
walls and flooded cell blocks Tuesday, the third day of a riot
against conditions at the Risley holding center in northern England.
   Chief Guard Graham Harrison said inmates used torn-off cell
doors to break down walls and threw bricks and rubble at guards who
tried to intervene.
   ``It was an orgy of destruction,'' he said.
   Guards and police with riot gear watched from below as prisoners
on the jail roof displayed banners protesting conditions in the
25-year-old center near Warrington, 10 miles east of the port city
of Liverpool.
   Guards said 55 rioters controlled the roof and two top floors of
D-wing and had ``absolutely obliterated'' the top floor of B-wing,
smashing all 48 cells. Water damaged an additional 60 cells on two
floors below, they said.
   The riot started Sunday. Paul Lynch, a recently released
prisoner, said the main complaints were overcrowding and
``atrocious food.''
   The complex, which also holds women prisoners, was opened in
1964 as a short-stay prison for inmates who could not get bail.
   Home Office Minister Douglas Hogg, who is in charge of prisons,
said in a radio interview that plans called for Risley to be
completely rebuilt and within eight years it would be an entirely
new prison.
   He called Risley a ``particularly difficult establishment.''
Hogg said the inmates could not be made to work because they were
awaiting trial. He said he was satisfied with staffing levels.
   But John Bartell, the guards' national association chairman,
said: ``There were 25 staff on duty for 550 prisoners ... We are
short of resources and staff and we are afraid that this incident
may presage a summer of discontent throughout the prison system.''
   After seven suicides in 18 months, Judge Stephen Tumim, the
government chief inspector of prisons, described Risley last summer
as ``barbarous and squalid ... a poorly designed institution where
many inmates are kept in appalling and unacceptable conditions.''
   Tumim said Risley and other prisons built in the 1960s were
constructed without cell toilets, just like the Victorian prisons
which still hold most of the country's 50,000 inmates.
   The government began rebuilding Risley after Tumim's report.

   Nine anti-abortion protesters have
been ordred to pay $810,000 in damages and stay away from the house
of a doctor who said demonstrators at his home made life miserable
for him and his family.
   State District Judge Jack Hunter on Tuesday issued a permanent
injunction barring pickets from coming within 400 feet of the home
of Dr. Eduardo Aquino.
   On Monday, a jury decided 10-2 that the picketers should pay
Aquino $810,000 in damages.
   ``I feel my family will be left alone now,'' Aquino said.
   Abortion opponent Cliff Zarsky, one of two attorneys who
represented the defendants without a fee, said he will ask for a
new trial.
   Jurors ruled Monday the protests caused mental anguish to
Aquino, his wife, Mercedes, and their four children. Protesters
carried placards that suggested Aquino was a murderer, but both
sides described the demonstrations as peaceful.
   Aquino testified his wife suffered from depression and ulcers,
that one son was institutionalized and that his three school-age
children suffered academically after the picketing began.
   Zarsky, who said the demonstrators' actions were protected by
the Constitution, argued that the pickets broke no laws and felt it
was their ``duty to protect unborn children.''
   The damages included $140,000 in past and future suffering of
the couple, $170,000 in past and future suffering of the children
and $500,000 in punitive damages.
   It was not clear if each defendant would be able to pay the
damages. Aquino's attorney, Tony Bonilla, said he would pursue the
award.
   Aquino said, however, that he was ``not really interested in the
money.''
   Aquino said he has been performing abortions since 1978 and
anti-abortionists had picketed his office since 1982. They began
picketing at his home in March 1988, the same month the suit was
filed.
   The phone at Zarsky's office went unanswered Tuesday.
   The defendants in the case were Eliseo Valenzuela Jr., Charles
W. Bolton, Carol Setliff, Sara Hood, Wade Pritchett, Lynn
Pritchett, T.C. Chedden, Dawn McGee, David Martinez and South
Texans for Life.

<HEAD>Five Potential `Star Wars' Storage Sites Considered</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon's ``Star Wars'' program has
selected five sites for consideration as the home of an
experimental system for storing huge amounts of electrical energy,
the Defense Department said Tuesday.
   The sites, in Wisconsin, New Mexico, Texas and Washington, will
now be studied more closely for their environmental suitability and
a final decision will be made sometime next year.
   The Star Wars project is known formally as the Superconductive
Magnetic Energy Storage program, or SMES, and will involve the
construction of huge coils the size of a football field.
   The idea behind the project is similar to that used by some
utilities that have built excess generating capacity by using
elevated water reservoirs. The magnetic coils would be designed to
hold huge amounts of electricity that can be ``pumped in'' when
demand is low, then discharged when needed.
   The coils would utilize new breakthroughs in fashioning
materials that can conduct electricity with little or no loss of
current.
   The Star Wars program is interested in the idea because of the
problem of powering large, ground-based lasers that are being
studied as one possible defense against nuclear missiles.
   ``Among the advantages SMES has to offer a ground-based laser
are instantaneous response for vast power requirements; extremely
high energy conversion efficiency; relatively low cost; fuel
independence; siting ease; high availability; low maintenance
costs, and insensitivity to earthquake and blast,'' the Pentagon
said.
   The Defense Department identified the five finalist sites as the
Badger Army Ammunition Plant near Baraboo, Wis.; Orogrande, N.M.,
near the southeastern edite of the White Sands Missile Range; a
laser experiment site already set up inside the White Sands Missile
Range; a site near Monahans, Texas, located about 35 miles
southwest of Odessa, Texas, and the Energy Department's Hanford
Reservation near Richland, Wash.
   The Pentagon previously had selected two contractors, Bechtel
National Inc. and Ebasco Services Inc., to compete in developing a
design for the SMES. That Phase 1 work is be completed in May 1990,
at which point the Pentagon plans to select one of the two
contractors and at the same time select a construction site for the
prototype.
   The Star Wars program is a research program aimed at developing
lasers and other exotic weapons that could automatically shoot down
any nuclear missiles fired at the United States.

   A passenger bus traveling along
a highway Tuesday ran into a mine, killing two people and injuring
13, officials said.
   The government said the mine was laid by leftist rebels, but the
insurgents blamed the army.
   The vehicle was on a highway about 25 miles northeast of San
Salvador at the time, the army said in a statement. It did not say
how many people were on the bus.
   The military said the mine was planted by rebels from the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
   The rebels said in a clandestine radio broadcast that the mines
were planted in a military operation designed to keep provincial
residents from reaching the capital for an opposition march.

   The jury in the Oliver North Iran-Contra trial
deliberated for its longest day Tuesday but failed again to reach
agreement on the guilt or innocence of the former National Security
Council aide.
   There has been no word from the jurors about progress in the
nearly two weeks since U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell
admonished them that ``in order to return a verdict on any aspect
of this case it is necessary that each juror agree to the verdict.''
   The jury, which is sequestered in a downtown hotel while not
meeting, worked nearly 7{ hours on its 10th day of deliberations,
for a total 53 hours.
   No one outside the jury room knows what is going on inside but
the requirement of unanimity for reaching a verdict ``on any
aspect'' seems a likely difficulty.
   ``Your verdict must be unanimous,'' Gesell said on April 20 when
he sent the jury from the courtroom with orders to begin weighing
the case the next day, a Friday.
   The jurors were told to communicate with the judge only through
notes and were told: ``You are never to reveal to any person, not
even the court, how the jury vote stands numerically or otherwise
on the question of guilt or innocence'' until the verdict is in.
   In the first three days there were eight notes. They dealt
mostly with office supplies _ the jurors wanted legal pads, paper
clips and sharpened pencils _ but not with any substance that would
give a clue to possible problems in agreeing on a verdict.
   Juries, especially those that are arguing about a particular
point, often ask to have a particular piece of testimony re-read to
them, an activity that takes place in open court with lawyers and
defendant present. In those cases, spectators have an inkling about
why the jury finds it difficult to reach a verdict.
   The last note from the North jury was sent to the judge a week
ago Monday. Since then there has been no communication from the
courtroom where the jury sits surrounded by 1,300 pages of
documents _ the 363 exhibits introduced in the trial.
   The sheer volume of those exhibits, the two months of testimony,
and the 12 felony charges in the case made it certain that a
conscientious jury would take time.
   But courthouse observers, many of whom had predicted a verdict
would be reached last week, now are discussing the possibility that
the jurors may be unable to agree on one or more counts.
   If the jury reported itself deadlocked on all counts, Gesell
most likely would send them back to try again _ until they reported
there was no hope of agreement. If they still could not get a
unanimous vote on one or more counts, prosecutors would have to
decide later whether to bring the charges again.
   Ten days is not a record; it is not even close. In the federal
court in the District of Columbia, a trial of Black Hebrews in 1986
on racketeering charges set a modern deliberation record of 200
hours over 36 days.
   Meanwhile, a lawyer for 10 news organizations seeking access to
a document that the jury was allowed to see filed a memorandum with
Gesell saying that ``the fact that the document at issue here has
been designated classified'' is no reason to withhold it from the
public.
   Gesell had questioned the right of the news organizations to
intervene in the case. Attorney Timothy B. Dyk told Gesell that the
Supreme Court and courts of appeal have recognized that the press
may ``assert the rights of public access to proceedings and records
in criminal cases.''
   The document in question is a summary of hundreds of
intelligence ``intercepts'' through which the National Security
Agency tracked a 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles from Israel to Iran.
   The news organizations involved in the case are The Associated
Press; Cable News Network Inc.; Capital Cities-ABC Inc.; CBS Inc.;
Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc.; National Broadcasting Co. Inc.; National
Public Radio; The New York Times Co.; the Times Mirror Co., and The
Washington Post.

<TEXT>
   Ten years after the May 3, 1979, election that
brought Margaret Thatcher to power, most Britons want her to step
down soon and think her right-wing revolution has gone too far,
according to new polls.
   But while Britons questioned ahead of Wednesday's anniversary
say they don't like her, the likelihood is they will go on voting
for her because they respect the woman who always has led what The
Economist weekly calls a ``reluctant nation.''
   The Economist noted that virtually throughout Mrs. Thatcher's
tenure, Gallup polls have never registered more than 24 percent
support for a basic Thatcher doctrine: tax cuts rather than
increased state spending, particularly on welfare.
   Soundings published Sunday and Tuesday are part of a nationwide
assessment of ``Thatcherism'' prompted by the anniversary of the
Conservative Party's triumph over former Prime Minister James
Callaghan's Labor Party government.
   She took office May 4, 1979.
   Europe's first woman prime minister was elected by a nation
weary of strikes and inflation and yearning for strong government
to reverse a national decline. She has won two more elections since
and is Britain's longest continuously serving prime minister this
century.
   In the opinion polls, she scores high for qualities such as
determination and courage. Her most popular policies, polls
indicate, are curbing trade unions and allowing public housing
tenants to buy their homes.
   Britons see their country as having gained respect abroad, while
becoming a more aggressive, violent and selfish society.
   The leader who determined to wipe out socialism from Britain
also appears in most polls to preside over a nation that has not
taken her message to heart.
   A Market Opinion and Research International poll published
Tuesday in The Independent, a London daily, indicates only 30
percent of those asked support the notion that ``private interests
and a free market economy should dominate.''
   According to a Harris poll in London's liberal Observer
newspaper, 58 percent of respondents think 10 years of Mrs.
Thatcher is enough. And 66 percent agree, ``Mrs. Thatcher has gone
too far in her policies.''
   Forty percent of those questioned said they think she should go
immediately and 18 percent want her to make way for a successor at
least a year before the next general election due mid-1992.
   But just 7 percent of the 1,040 voters questioned by Harris
actually expect Mrs. Thatcher to resign in the next few years.
   And 28 percent apparently can't imagine being without her. Asked
when they think Mrs. Thatcher, 63, will retire, they said:
``Never.''
   The soundings also indicate a generally subdued reckoning by
voters of the Thatcher revolution. For example, only 37 percent of
1,001 voters questioned by Gallup for the conservative Sunday
Telegraph said they think that overall Britain is now a better
place in which to live.
   And while 67 percent dislike Mrs. Thatcher personally, 63
percent respect her.
   The polls also have most Britons citing soccer hooliganism and
street crime to back their belief that the country has become more
violent.
   But in a notable victory for a leader who has spent a decade
preaching self-reliance, among other values, most Britons no longer
expect the government to put it right.
   However, Mrs. Thatcher continues to be the party leader most
think makes the best prime minister. She has won big majorities of
around 42 percent of the vote while the left-of-center is split.
And, when it comes to casting a vote, she ends the first 10 years
with a 2- to 3-point lead over Labor in most polls.
   ``She has lacked the sunny charm that President Reagan brought
to his most controversial policies,'' said The Economist.
   ``Perhaps lots of people had to be made unhappy for the country
to face the future with some confidence. Well, they have been _ and
it does.''

<HEAD>Cocaine User Convicted of Prenatal Child Abuse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKFORD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who was stripped of custody of her
child and convicted of prenatal child abuse for using cocaine
during pregnancy is a victim of the courts pushing the law to
outrageous limits, a lawyer said Tuesday.
   But a law professor said the conviction Monday in Juvenile Court
was likely to be endorsed by doctors because of compelling evidence
that pregnant women who use cocaine endanger their unborn babies.
   Prosecutors said it apparently was the second case in Illinois
this year in which a woman had been convicted of prenatal child
abuse because of drug use.
   Judge Frederick J. Kapala, who found the woman guilty of
prenatal abuse and neglect, said he was forced to ``take a stand''
on the issue of fetus rights after testimony showed she had used
cocaine up to a few hours before the birth.
   The child, in the care of social workers, shows no sign of
cocaine addiction or other serious cocaine-related health problems,
officials said.
   Paul Logli, Winnebago County state's attorney, said the woman
faces no jail time or fine because the case was tried only to
determine custody of the child.
   The child, born three months ago, will remain in the care of
social workers pending the mother's treatment at a drug
rehabilitation center. A hearing May 25 will determine if she is
fit to regain custody of the child.
   Neither the mother nor the child was identified.
   J. Steven Beckett, an attorney in the state Bar Association's
individual rights and responsibilities section, said the judge's
ruling will ``allow headline-grabbing prosecutors another
opportunity to practice their trade.''
   ``If prenatal abuse happens with cocaine, it can happen with
alcohol, it can happen with drunken driving, and it can happen with
pregnant speeders,'' he said.
   Kapala rejected the claim that his ruling could apply to
pregnant women who smoke or drink. The difference, he said, is that
cocaine is illegal.
   Richard Epstein, professor at the University of Chicago School
of Law and a fellow at the university's Center for Clinical Medical
Ethics, said that ``a lot of medical people will breathe a sigh of
relief'' at Kapala's decision.
   ``If you have an unborn child inside you, the evidence is
overwhelming that using cocaine is a form of abuse and neglect,''
Epstein said.
   Logli said he was considering filing criminal charges against
women whose babies die of cocaine addiction. ``We're talking about
a very dangerous illegal substance,'' he said. ``We have no choice
but to take serious steps to battle it.''
   The prosecutor said that the infant's exposure to cocaine puts
it at risk of kidney and developmental problems and increases the
risk of sudden infant death syndrome.
   A key element in the case involved the question of whether
Illinois law covers fetal rights.
   The mother's attorney, Alberto F. Altamore, said the Illinois
juvenile court act defines abuse and neglect of minors but does not
address fetuses. State child abuse laws only speak of minors under
21, he said.

<TEXT>
   Cambodian Premier Hun Sen reported
``quite big progress'' with resistance leaders on Tuesday in talks
to end a decade-long war, but he said the resistance appeared split
on key issues.
   In Thailand, shells crashed into the largest Cambodian refugee
camp in the latest in a recent surge in border assaults, Western
relief officials said.
   Three rounds flew over a border camp known as Site 2, and two
shells landed in the camp 30 minutes later, said Patrick Van de
Velde, deputy director of the U.N. Border Relief Operation. No
casualties were reported.
   It was not known who is responsible for the recent shellings.
Van de Velde said 15 shells have landed in the past 10 days near
the camp, home to 180,000 refugees.
   In Jakarta, resistance coalition leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk
and anti-communist faction chief Son Sann negotiated separately
with the premier, who said the two faction leaders differed on key
issues.
   The Khmer Rouge, the largest and best armed faction in the
three-party resistance, were not directly represented in Jakarta.
Sihanouk said their absence was a consensus decision.
   Sihanouk, Son Sann and their aides were not available for
comment Tuesday. Both canceled news conferences.
   Hun Sen did not indicate whether he considered the split a
barrier to further progress. He said the talks would resume
Wednesday, with further negotiations in Paris or Jakarta.
   Sihanouk expressed willingness on Sunday to drop his demand that
a U.N. force supervise the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from
Cambodia and keep the peace after Hun Sen's government was
dismantled. Hun Sen said Sihanouk ``agreed to maintain the present
constitution and make a few more amendments (to it).''
   But Son Sann still insists on the U.N. force, suspension of the
constitution and a four-sided coalition government until elections
are held, Hun Sen said.
   Hun Sen said the first day of talks achieved ``quite big
progress if we compare it with the recent and not so recent past.
... We recognize that both of us made concessions.''
   Sihanouk and Hun Sen agreed to stop receiving military aid from
abroad as soon as the Vietnamese troop withdrawal is completed. It
was not clear whether Son Sann also agreed to that.
   U.S. officials estimate that 60,000 to 70,000 Vietnamese troops
remain in Cambodia. Vietnam has promised to withdraw them by the
end of September.
   Hun Sen said the government would invite Sihanouk home to head
the government. The 67-year-old prince agreed to return to Cambodia
after Vietnamese forces departed, Hun Sen said.
   Speaking through an interpreter, Hun Sen said he favors the
creation of a supreme national council, headed by Sihanouk, with
leaders of the other three factions as deputies.
   The council would draft election rules and supervise the
election, Hun Sen said.
   ``Our government will remain only to maintain social order,'' he
said. After the votes are counted, his government would be
dissolved.
   The armed forces would remain at the same strength and in the
same places until after the elections.
   Millions have been killed in Cambodia since 1970, when a coup
ended Sihanouk's 30-year rule. Cambodia became engulfed in the
Vietnam War, and then the Khmer Rouge won a civil war in 1975.
   The current war erupted when Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late
1978 and pushed out the Khmer Rouge, which was blamed for killing
hundreds of thousands of people.

   An abbreviated countdown began
Tuesday for launching Atlantis on a once-delayed planetary mission,
and the astronaut who will command the flight said, ``This time
we're going to see if we can get it right.''
   Astronaut David Walker and his four crewmates flew here Tuesday
afternoon from their training base in Houston, where they went
after their flight was scrubbed Friday just 31 seconds before the
planned liftoff.
   ``Looks like the vehicle's been turned around real well,''
Walker told reporters. ``We're extremely pleased the folks here at
the Cape were able to do such a good and quick job getting it ready
to go again.''
   The other crew members are pilot Ronald Grabe and mission
specialists Mary Cleave, Mark Lee and Nornman Thagard.
   ``There are no major issues in sight,'' Robert Crippen, NASA's
deputy director for operations, said after a mission management
meeting. ``We're pressing on toward a Thursday launch.''
   Liftoff is scheduled for 1:48 p.m.
   The shuttle will carry into space the $550 million Magellan
probe, a robot spacecraft bound for Venus. It will be the first
U.S. planetary mission in 11 years and the first to be launched
from a space shuttle.
   Friday's launch was scubbed because of a short circuit in a fuel
pump.
   Technicians working around the clock replaced the pump and a
leaky fuel line in half the time expected and NASA scheduled
another launch attempt for Thursday, at least a day earlier than
they originally thought they could.
   Air Force Capt. Thomas Strange, the shuttle meteorologist, said
the weather outlook for a Thursday launch was favorable, with only
a 30 percent chance there would be a condition that would violate
weather constraints.
   The biggest problem, and it was slight, he said, might be high
crosswinds that could be dangerous if Atlantis had to make an
emergency landing on a runway near the launch pad.
   Shuttle test director Ronald Phelps said the new countdown was
compressed from three days to two by eliminating some ``hold time''
that is built into the countdown in case of problems and by not
repeating some tasks completed in the first attempt.
   The astronauts will release the Magellan six hours after
liftoff, and a rocket will hurl it on a 15-month journey to Venus.
The 7,600-pound craft will orbit the planet and map its
cloud-veiled surface with high-resolution radar.

   Lawmakers on Tuesday urged Vice President Dan
Quayle as chairman of the National Space Council to try to reverse
a Pentagon decision to scale back funding for a futuristic
high-speed plane.
   Nineteen members of the House said that Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney's plan to cut the project's fiscal 1990 budget from $300
million to $100 million and place it under exclusive NASA
jurisdiction will result in the plane's demise. The project has
been a joint effort of the Defense Department and NASA.
   ``NASA officials have made it clear that withdrawal of DoD
support for NASP (National Aerospace Plane) would ultimately kill
the program,'' the seven Democrats and 12 Republicans said in a
letter.
   They said the plane, a transport that could fly around the world
in just two hours, is ``a natural product of our intense need to
return to the forefront of space technology.''
   Cheney determined that the plane is a civilian aviation program.
But the lawmakers argued it represents technology that will provide
national security ``well into the 21st century.''
   ``As vice president, as chairman of the National Space Council
and as one who advocates U.S. competitiveness in the world, you
have a key role in U.S. technological development,'' the lawmakers
wrote Quayle. ``To cancel the National Aerospace Plane in 1990 is
to ensure our technological mediocrity beyond.''
   Signing the letter were Reps. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla.; Robert Roe,
D-N.J.; Beverly Byron, D-Md.; Ronnie Flippo, D-Ala.; Tim Valentine,
D-N.C.; Dan Glickman, D-Kan.; Bob Livingston, R-La.; Robert Walker,

   Congress on Tuesday began consideration of the
fiscal 1990 budget with the kind of enthusiasm usually reserved for
getting one's teeth drilled.
   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, said he disagreed with those who characterize the
deficit reduction plan as ``smoke and mirrors, as deception, as
sleight of hand, or even worse.''
   ``But I sympathize completely with the frustration behind it,''
he said, as the Senate began debate on its version of the $1.17
trillion spending late Tuesday. ``This resolution simply doesn't go
far enough. We all know it.''
   ``There is something in it for everyone to hate, yet without it
we're in big trouble,'' said Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, senior
Republican on the House Budget Committee, testifying in favor of
the House plan.
   Both plans are based on the deficit-reduction agreement
announced last month at the White House. The pact claims about $28
billion in deficit reduction through limits on federal spending
growth combined with revenues from selling government assets,
raising fees, and about $5.3 billion in still-to-be-negotiated new
revenues.
   The budgets promise to bring the deficit down below the $100
billion goal of the Gramm-Rudman law, for the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1. But critics contend that claim is based on overly
optimistic assumptions, and much of the ``savings'' is illusory.
   ``I believe we are doing a great disservice,'' said Rep. Anthony
Beilenson, D-Calif., a member of the House Rules Committee said
Tuesday as that panel prepared to prescribe a House debate to
assure passage of the plan.
   ``The votes are not there'' to do more, lamented Rep. Leon
Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget Committee. He and
others said perhaps more could be done next year.
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., said after a White
House meeting that the budget was ``close to what the
administration had asked for.'' He and the Democratic leaders were
working to make sure there would be no amendments allowed that
would ``upset the whole apple cart.''
   ``Obviously, this budget has been heavily criticized,'' said
Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M. ``I know of no one who has a better
plan.''
   Under the White House pact, both the House and Senate budgets
envision $299.2 billion in military spending next year, about the
same as the current year. The Pentagon would be given total
spending authority of $305.5 billion, a figure which includes some
outlays which stretch past the end of the fiscal year.
   Foreign aid spending would be set at $17 billion.
   Entitlement programs would be allowed to grow so that individual
benefits and their cost-of-living increases would escape cuts.
However, a variety of cost-cutting actions _ some of them just
bookkeeping changes _ would allow for $8.3 billion in total savings
from Medicare, agriculture, federal pensions, and other
entitlements.
   The White House agreement set an overall spending cap, but not
specifics, for non-entitlement domestic programs.
   The House and Senate budget committees took somewhat difference
approaches to dividing that pie, with the House favoring education,
health and veterans programs compared to more Senate emphasis on
agriculture, energy and law enforcement.
   In the House, the rules committee was limiting amendments and
debate so that the package could be completed on Thursday. In the
Senate, the rules allow individual senators the right to offer
amendments at any time, but budget supporters were confident the
plan would survive essentially intact.
   ``We'll have substantial help for the cause,'' Domenici said.
   Once the House and Senate complete their budgets, the two
chambers must agree on a single resolution. The document then
serves as the guide for the annual spending and tax legislation
produced by the Congress.

<HEAD>Senate Approves King Holiday Commission But Bars Protest Training</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate voted Tuesday to reauthorize the
Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday Commission after prohibiting
the panel from training people in the nonviolent protest tactics
which King used successfully in the civil rights movement.
   The 90-7 vote to give the commission five more years of life _
and its first infusion of federal dollars _ ended two days of
debate in which Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., a leading opponent of the
1983 legislation creating the King holiday, was beaten in four
attempts to weaken the reauthorizing bill.
   But Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the bill's sponsor, joined with Helms
in an amendment, adopted 96-0, which prohibits the commission from
engaging in training activites for protest or civil disobediance
campaigns.
   Nunn said the amendment was not an attempt to stifle information
about King's tactics or the civil rights movement and its history.
But because the commission now will be receiving federal money, he
said, it should not be permitted to engage in such training
activities.
   Helms said the commission's 1988 annual report provides evidence
it has been training students to wage nonviolent protest campaigns
against social injustice. He said the federal government ``has no
business encouraging protest movement campaigns, civil disobedience
and those sorts of things.''
   The Senate bill, which would provide the commission with $1.5
million in federal money over five years, must be reconciled with a
similar bill the House passed last month. The House version makes
the commission permanent and authorizes an annual federal
appropriation of $500,000.
   The commission was created in 1984 to promote state, national
and international activities relating to the observance of the
federal holiday in honor of the slain civil rights leader. Its
activities previously had been financed with private donations.
   Before approving the legislation, the Senate voted 86-11 to
defeat a Helms amendment that would have eliminated all federal
money for the commission and 92-6 to defeat another Helms proposal
to terminate the commission after two years.
   Another Helms amendment, which would have prohibited the
commission from lobbying state and local governments, was defeated
80-19, and Helms' proposal to prohibit the panel from exercising
``direction, control or supervision'' over school curriculum or
programs was rejected 91-7.
   The Senate accepted one Helms amendment, requiring that the
bronze replica of the Declaration of Independence, which was moved
from the Capitol rotunda last year to make way for a bust of King,
be returned to a place of prominence in the rotunda.
   Voting against the bill in the Senate were Sens. Bill Armstrong,
R-Colo.; Helms; Trent Lott, R-Miss.; James McClure, R-Idaho; Warren
Rudman, R-N.H.; Steve Symms, R-Idaho; and Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo.
   Not voting were Sens. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.; Frank Lautenberg,
D-N.J., and Donald Riegle, D-Mich.

<HEAD>Commission Rules Domestic Industry Harmed by Low-Priced Imports</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. International Trade Commission ruled
Tuesday that the domestic bearing industry has been harmed by
low-priced imports, clearing the way for the final imposition of
anti-dumping duties on certain imports from Europe and Asia.
   In one of the nation's largest anti-dumping cases ever, the
Commerce Department will decide the amount of duties that the
Customs Service will levy on an estimated $531 million in imported
bearings from nine nations.
   In a series of six rulings, the commission found injury to U.S.
bearing producers from low-priced imports of ball, cylindrical
roller and plain bearings and rejected claims of injury from
imports of spherical, needle roller and slewing ring bearings.
   The action was hailed by the Torrington Co., of Torrington,
Conn., which had filed a petition on behalf of the U.S. bearing
industry in March 1988 claiming that massive dumping by foreign
countries was damaging domestic manufacturers of anti-friction
bearings.
   Torrington President Thomas E. Bennett said the commission's
action ``should help create conditions of fair competition in the
U.S. market.'' He said domestic producers lost an estimated $700
million in sales a year because of unfairly priced imports.
   Bennett said the company was disappointed that not all
categories of imported bearings were found to be injuring domestic
manufacturers and that Torrington ``will not hesitate to take
strong action again to challenge additional unfair trade practices
that are identified.''
   Terence Stewart, a Washington attorney representing the company,
said Torrington's petition covered $625 million in imports a year,
and that the commission's action would result in the imposition of
duties on 85 percent of those imports. Torrington, a subsidiary of
Ingersoll-Rand Co., is the nation's largest producer of a range of
bearings.
   Stewart said the ruling was significant because ``for literally
thousands of Americans, it will provide employment opportunities in
a high-skilled industry.'' He said an estimated 30 U.S. plants had
closed and 14,000 jobs had been lost because of unfair competition
from abroad.
   Stewart said that while the ITC ruling was the last step before
final imposition of duties, the decision still could be challenged
in court and that litigation was not unlikely given the hard-fought
nature of the case to date.
   ITC spokesman Jim Craig said the Customs Service would probably
begin collecting duties by the middle of the month. The decision
covers certain imports from Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Romania,
Singapore, Sweden, Thailand and the United Kingdom.
   Stewart said most of the affected imports were ball bearings,
and that the largest share of the imports came from Germany and
Japan.
   In earlier rulings on the case, the Commerce Department had
found final dumping margins ranging up to 212 percent for some
imported bearings, meaning that U.S. prices for the imports would
have to be raised by that amount to bring them to a fair value.
   The ITC estimated there were 95 domestic producers of
anti-friction bearings in 1988, with plants located in Alabama,
Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana,
Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina,
Tennessee, Virginia and Wisconsin.
   Anti-friction bearings are used in the aircraft, automotive,
machinery and electronics industries.
   Commission Chairman Anne Brunsdale recused herself from all
votes on the bearings to avoid any potential conflict of interest,
given certain family holdings in affected industries.

<HEAD>Retired British Spy's Memoirs to Name Soviet Mole</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A retired British spy writes in his memoirs that
British intelligence has been irreparably damaged by Soviet agents,
and he names another mole among its ranks, The Independent reported
Tuesday.
   Desmond Bristow's book, ``A Game of Moles,'' may face the same
government ban attempted on former agent Peter Wright's book
``Spycatcher.''
   Bristow spoke of his memoirs in an interview at his home in
Malaga, Spain, the newspaper said.
   He was quoted as saying British intelligence officials already
have tried, over a bottle of claret wine, to have him scrap the
book or submit it to government censors.
   Bristow, 73, once was chief of counterintelligence for southwest
Europe for MI6, The Independent said. MI6 is Britain's foreign
intelligence agency. MI5 handles domestic affairs.
   ``The CIA and MI6 were equals before,'' the newspaper quoted
Bristow as saying. ``Now they're not. The CIA doesn't share its
supersecret stuff with us anymore. Personally I don't blame them.''
   Bristow said he left MI6 in 1954, after his cover was blown by
Kim Philby, the notorious British traitor-spy, but continued to do
occasional work for the agency, The Independent reported.
   Philby, Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean and Anthony Blunt were
upper-class Englishmen who were unmasked in the 1950s and 1960s as
Soviet agents.
   The Independent said that in ``A Game of Moles,'' Bristow claims
the late David Footman, a chief of MI6's political section for
central Europe, also worked for Moscow.
   Bristow, the paper said, claims Footman tore up a report written
for him in 1951 on Burgess' suspicious activities, fired a Spanish
agent of Bristow's who was uncovering KGB plots in Spain, and
buried top-secret files on links between the KGB and Communist
parties in southern Europe.
   The paper did not say whether Footman has any family to respond
to the allegation, and the Home Office said: ``We don't comment on
security matters.''
   The Independent did not say when the book was to be published,
but reporter Sarah Helm told The Associated Press the book is not
yet completed and Bristow is talking with publishers.
   The government fought a three-year court battle to suppress
Wright's book, saying it violated the lifelong oath of secrecy
taken by intelligence employees.
   The courts eventually lifted an injunction banning newspapers
from serializing ``Spycatcher,'' but its publication in book form
remains banned in Britain, although its publishers can distribute
the Australian edition here.

   A state court on Tuesday
convicted a West German engineer of selling sensitive information
on NATO military aircraft to the Soviet Union.
   Helmut Stefan Kolasch, a 45-year-old former employee of the
Siemens electronics firm, was sentenced to three years and nine
months in prison and fined $10,700.
   Kolasch sold technical information to the KGB Soviet
intelligence agency on NATO's Tornado warplane and on the Jaeger 90
fighter jet now under development, the Stuttgart court ruled.
   The court determined that Kolasch had worked for the KGB from
1973 to 1984, and was given $14,430 by his KGB contacts.
   Kolasch was involved in research work on electronics for
military aircraft at Siemens. He was arrested on March 23, 1988.
   The court, however, said prosecutors did not prove Kolasch
handed over results of all his research team's work on aircraft
electronics.

<TEXT>
   Senate and House negotiators quickly agreed
Tuesday on legislation to raise the hourly minimum wage to $4.55 by
1991 and promised to move for swift congressional passage of the
bill which President Bush has vowed to veto.
   There were 18 areas in which the terms of House and Senate bills
differed but the conference committee took only about an an hour to
complete work, made easier by staff negotiations during last week's
congressional recess.
   Fourteen of the differences were worked out between
representatives of each chamber's labor committees. The Senate
conferees then met with representatives of the House Ways and Means
Committee and stripped off four tax-related Senate amendments
including a proposal to raise the amount of outside income a Social
Security recipient can earn before losing some enefits.
   Democrats from both the Senate and House conference teams
pledged swift final legislative action on the compromise, with a
consensus prediction that the bill would reach the White House in
about two weeks.
   Between Bush and Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, the
administration has vowed more than a dozen times to veto the
measure, which has a final minimum wage target 30 cents higher than
the president proposed and contains a so-called training wage far
more restrictive than the six-month provision demanded by Bush.
   Sponsors said they had scaled back their bill considerably to
meet administration concerns and would go no further without
concessions by Bush.
   ``We are hard-pressed to offer any further compromise,'' said
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, even tried to strip the
two-month training wage Democrats reluctantly added to their bill
in hopes Bush would then accept it.
   ``Unless we can work out a compromise with the White House we
ought to dump the training wage,'' Metzenbaum said. But he withdrew
the attempt after House Democrats told him the provision was
essential to maintain support among moderate Democrats and a small
number of Republicans who voted for the original House bill.
   Bush appears to have the votes to sustain a veto but Democrats
promised nonetheless to try to override. To assist that effort, the
AFL-CIO is contemplating an advertising campaign in hopes of
rallying the public behind the legislation. The federation's
governing body also issued a statement Tuesday supporting the
legislation.
   The sponsors on both the House and Senate side, however, concede
Bush likely will win the first confrontation between the Congress
and the White House over domestic policy but they have promised to
try to send Bush another minimum-wage bill this year if that
happens.
   The final product endorsed by the conferees would raise the
hourly minimum from $3.35, its level for more than eight years, to
$4.55 through three increases _ beginning Oct. 1 and ending on Oct.
1, 1991.
   Both the House and Senate bills contained those targets. The
major issue resolved in conference was the training-wage provision
allowing employers to pay some new workers a subminimum wage for 60
days.
   The House bill allowed a subminimum only for first-time entrants
in the job market while the Senate language, adopted by the
conference, requires once a person held a job at the submininum
wage for 60 days he would be no longer eligible for the subminimum
even if he changes jobs.

<TEXT>
   Police arrested a man with a gun outside a
train station in south Wales on Tuesday while Princess Diana was
inside launching an educational project, they said.
   South Wales police said they did not believe there was a direct
connection between the royal visit and the unidentified 41-year-old
man who was arrested behind a sidewalk security barrier outside a
pub next to Cardiff station.
   Buckingham Palace said the princess was only told of the arrest
after she left the station.
   Reporters at the station said they believed the weapon was only
a gas-powered air pistol. Police gave no details but said the gun
was not a fake and the man was likely to be charged.
   A pub employee said the unshaven man was wearing a long coat and
holding a shopping bag when police arrested him.
   ``Two officers grabbed his arms and they took what appeared to
be some kind of pellet gun from one of his pockets. I didn't see
what he did to make them suspicious,'' said the witness on
condition of anonymity.
   The 27-year-old princess, the wife of Prince Charles, came to
the station to unveil a plaque on a diesel locomotive that will
pull a ``traveling college'' train around Britain.
   The train has sleeping berths for 168 pupils and 22 staff
members who live and work on board during five-day courses in
geography, history, and culture.
   The courses fulfill a field study requirement.
   On April 13, a man was arrested in Cramlington, Northumberland,
after lunging at the princess during a royal visit. He said later
he was trying to hug her and was not charged.

   Prices paid by consumers in Third World
countries jumped an average 58.3 percent last year, up from 35.7
percent in 1957, the International Monetary Fund reported.
   The average rise in the United States and 20 other industrial
countries was only 3.3 percent, a rise from 2.9 percent.
   The figures come from a monthly report distributed Tuesday.
   Inflation figures for the Third World were heavily influenced by
Latin America _ Brazil's 682 percent, Argentina's 343 percent and
Mexico's 114 percent. These are the Third World's three biggest
debtors as well.
   Mexico reported a slowdown from last year's 132 percent but
Brazil and Argentina were moving up. Argentina's annual rate was
over 387 percent in December, and Brazil's 1,170 percent in January.
   Nicaragua surpassed them all with 10,205 percent for 1988 and an
annual rate of just under 24,000 percent in December but the
country is too small to count for much in the overall average.
   There was also a rise of inflation in Asia, to 11.6 percent from
7.3 percent. China's rate was up beyond 20 percent, compared less
than 9 percent in 1987.
   Returns from Africa and the Middle East were too fragmentary for
an overall figure.

<TEXT>
   The outgoing chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission pointed with pride Tuesday to an opening
up of competition in broadcasting during the ``seismic change'' of
his six years at the agency.
   In a swan song address to industry executives, Dennis Patrick
ticked off a list of benefits he said broadcasters had received
since he joined the FCC in 1983.
   He thanked his audience at the National Association of
Broadcasters convention ``for being courageous soldiers in this
battle for freedom'' and for ``unflagging support'' of his policies
against critics in Congress and non-broadcast media.
   ``Through this period of seismic change ... I have held firmly
to the notion of open entry to create a competitive marketplace for
the media,'' he said. ``This policy has led to a proliferation of
information outlets unimaginable even six years ago.''
   The average American home today has access to 25 video channels,
he said, and half of all Americans receive at least 28 radio
stations.
   ``We have tried to foster competition at the FCC by lowering
barriers to entry, and by permitting broadcasters to compete as
freely as those with whom they compete _ namely cable,'' Patrick
said.
   While saying that more competition can be a double-edged sword
for broadcasters, he said the ``competitive genie is out of the
bottle'' and ``neither Congress nor the commission will stuff her
back in.''
   Patrick anounced last month he had resigned from the agency
where he has been chairman for the past two years but would stay on
until his replacement is confirmed.
   During Patrick's tenure the FCC repealed the Fairness Doctrine
that required broadcasters to air opposing views in controversial
issues. Congress is expected to vote to reinstate the policy this
year, posing a possible veto fight with President Bush.
   The FCC also revised the means by which stations renew their
licenses to bar sham competitors who just want money to drop their
challenges to licensees.
   ``No longer will you be held hostage to petitions to deny filed
because you refuse to concede to extortion ... nor will we tolerate
those who seek to extort cash payments by masquerading as competing
applicants,'' Patrick said to a round of applause.
   He also noted the FCC's decision last year to make sure that a
U.S. standard for high-definition television will not make obsolete
the huge investment TV stations have in current equipment.
   American industry is racing to adopt standards with which to
build an HDTV system and stave off the expected appearance in the
next couple of years of foreign-made HDTV VCRs and movies.
   He urged the broadcasters not to delay reaching agreement on an
HDTV transmission standard so America can ``regain the lead in
broadcast technology.''
   He also said broadcasters need further protection from the cable
TV industry in the form of a requirement that cable systems pay for
the over-the-air programs they feed to their subscribers.
   ``They should no longer be permitted to take the product that
you have bought, you have promoted, you have earned and pass it
off, without asking, as theirs,'' Patrick said to more applause.
   He said the future holds new challenges for broadcasters:
fiber-optic cable and telephone entry into video programming,
competition from foreign media, further loss of audience and the
shifting of advertising from video to point of sales.
   He said network affiliates and networks may have to forge
stronger bonds, and broadcasters may have to work with cable to
survive against global competitors
   ``In this complex future,'' he said, ``may you have convictions,
may you have the courage of your convictions, may you succeed.''
   Patrick's address concluded the 67th annual NAB gathering, which
was attended by a record 50,136 broadcast executives and exhibitors.

   A Food and Drug Administration advisory

an AIDS-related condition that can lead to blindness.
   The panel of outside experts based its decision on new data that
came from several recent studies conducted in the United States and
in other countries that found the drug ganciclovir is effective in
treating cytomegalovirus retinitis in AIDS patients.
   This is the second AIDS drug the advisory committee has
recommended for approval in two days of hearings. On Monday, the
panel recommended approval of the aerosolized version of
pentamidine to ward off initial and recurring bouts of pneumocystis
carinii pneumonia, which kills 60 percent of AIDS patients.
   FDA approval of ganciclovir is expected this summer, and
approval of aerosol pentamidine is likely within weeks, said an FDA
source who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Advocates of programs to fight AIDS have been pushing the FDA to
move quickly on approving the drugs.
   Ganciclovir has been widely available to AIDS patients since
November when the FDA approved use of the drug for treatment of
patients who were in the immediate, sight-threatening stage of
cytomegalovirus retinitis.
   In early March, the FDA made the drug available to patients
whose cytomegalovirus infection was in an early stage.
   The advisory committee recommended against approval of the drug
in October 1987, citing the need for more safety and efficacy data.
   In recommending approval this time, the panel also strongly
urged that extensive follow-up studies be conducted after the drug
is on the market. The committee specifically recommended a study to
determine the drug's proposed use in children and a study comparing
ganciclovir with foscarnet, another experimental drug for
cytomegalovirus retinitis.
   The panel also urged a study be conducted to determine whether
ganciclovir can be used in patients who are receiving zidovudine,
or AZT, which has been shown to prolong survival of AIDS patients.
Because the two drugs have similar toxicity, they aren't used
together.

<TEXT>
   A familiar-sounding voice boomed out over
White House loudspeakers Tuesday evening announcing the end of the
business day.
   It was President Bush, personally announcing he was going home.
   It was the first time in anyone's memory that the president,
himself, had performed the daily chore.
   ``Ladies and gentlemen of the press, the president having gone
home for the day, there is a lid on,'' Bush said. A ``lid'' is the
term used to tell reporters that no more paperwork or presidential
actions are expected.
   Bush made the announcement while walking from the Oval Office to
his residence in the White House. Noticing a gathering of reporters
hanging around the press office, Bush asked why they were still
there.
   They said they had to wait for him to leave and for the White
House to announce a lid. Bush asked what a lid was, and a reporter
explained the term.
   Usually a lid is announced by a press aide using a telephone
that is hooked up to a White House announcement system. Bush asked
for the telephone and made the announcement himself at 6:40 p.m.
EDT.
   He departed for his quarters as the press cheered his
announcement.

<HEAD>Father's `Gentle, Quiet Son' Held in Random Shooting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHITLEY BAY, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 22-year-old civil servant
described by his father as a ``gentle, quiet son'' was ordered held
in custody on a murder charge Tuesday after a shooting spree that
killed one person and wounded 14.
   Robert James Sartin, a social security official who lives in
this seaside resort, was accused in North Shields Magistrates Court
of killing 41-year-old Kenneth Mackintosh. Sartin made no plea.
   Authorities say Mackintosh was killed during 15 minutes of
terror when Sartin fired a shotgun at people at random Sunday in
Monkseaton, a suburb of the Whitley Bay sea resort in northeast
England. The gunman was dressed all in black and wore sunglasses
and an ammunition belt.
   The defendant's father, Brian Sartin, a weapons coordinator for
a warship builder, hugged his wife, Jean, and they both wept
Tuesday while facing reporters outside their home.
   He said his family felt ``so terribly sorry'' for the people
shot on Sunday.
   He said he saw his son at a police station, and it was as if
``there are two people down there.''
   ``There is our gentle, quiet son, who loves kids, loves animals
and loves people. He is just so gentle. ... Then there is another
son sitting down there who doesn't know what it is all about,'' he
said.
   ``You just cannot explain it _ he is not aggressive. He has
never had a scrap in his life. He has never been aggressive to
anybody. It is completely alien,'' the father said.
   The couple has an older son, Andrew, who works as a weapons
engineer on the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal.
   Sartin said he had invited his younger son to his clay
pigeon-shooting club a few times and he was ``quite a good little
shot,'' but they never shot anything live.
   A friend described the accused man as shy and reluctant to leave
home for entertainment. His girlfriend is a police officer's
daughter.
   Authorities have said Sartin probably will be charged with other
offenses later.

   U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Paul A. Yost, in Alaska for a
weeklong progress survey, said Exxon's revised plan to clean up the
oil spill was ``thin'' and lacked ``backup or substantiation,'' but
promised the cleanup will be completed this summer.
   Yost must approve Exxon's cleanup strategy and said he will pass
on the proposal within a week.

   Consumers joined a coalition of environmentalists and
politicians endorsing a one-day national boycott of Exxon products.
   ``We want to show Exxon that corporations who harm the
environment will pay a price in the marketplace,'' said California
Assemblyman Tom Bates.
   Rallies and news conferences were scheduled in at least nine
states, and consumer advocate Ralph Nader led the boycott call from
Washington, D.C.

   Exxon said 10,000 credit cards out of 7 million have been cut up
and returned since the spill. The company called the boycott unjust
but said it has no reports lower gasoline sales.
   J. Edward Surette Jr. of Massachusetts dealers' association,
said it was too early to assess the impact of the boycott. While
criticizing Exxon's ``obvious negligence,'' Surette said it was
unfair for consumers to vent their anger at dealers, most of whom
are small, independent businessmen.

   Sens. Jim Exon and Bob Kerrey, both Nebraska Democrats, asked
U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh to investigate potential
price gouging by the oil industry. The senators noted gasoline
prices in Nebraska rose 20 percent from the first of March until
the middle of April.
   The attorneys general of Oregon, Washington and Idaho said
Monday they would ask the federal government to investigate the
price increases.
   Since the accident, gas prices have increased an average 10
percent nationally, while the Pacific Northwest saw surges as high
as 25 percent in less than a month.

   Exxon has decided not to seal the large holes ripped in the hull

   The tanker is undergoing preliminary repairs off the Alaskan
coast.

   Exxon President William D. Stevens defended his company's
actions, saying Exxon responded quickly and is committed to
cleaning up the spill.
   In an address to the Offshore Technology Conference in Houston,
Stevens said there was little he would do differently if faced with
the situation again. He said Exxon, the Alaska Department of
Environmental Conservation and the Coast Guard should share the
blame for not immediately authorizing the use of chemical
dispersants and the open burning of oil in hopes of containing the
spill more quickly.

   The head of the communist government's
agency to regulate church matters has been replaced as part of a
program to relax control of religion, the official news agency MTI
reported Tuesday.
   It said Imre Miklos, long associated with strong government
control, retired May 1 as president of the State Office for Church
Affairs and the duties were assumed by his deputy, Barna Sarkadi
Nagy. MTI said the agency would be remodeled and given a new name
to conform with the new approach.
   Miklos retired after ``crucial changes'' in policy toward
religion, the agency said, and state control will be withdrawn from
all aspects of church life in order to ``finalize the separation of
the state and churches.''
   A law on the freedom of religion and conscience has been
prepared, according to MTI. About half the nation's 10.5 million
people are Roman Catholic.
   The agency said the new policy would provide an opportunity to
expand cooperation between the government and churches in the
social, political, cultural and educational field.
   ``There is a need for open political activity in order to create
a forum for coordination of interests that would attract ...
church, state and party officials, as well as independent and
prestigious politicians,'' MTI reported.
   Sarkadi Nagy was quoted as saying: ``This policy of genuine
cooperation between equal partners deserves better than the usual
official style.''

   Six white candles, each symbolizing a million
lost lives, were lit in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday
in a memorial to the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust of
World War II.
   ``Our memories are of the millions who died, and the many, many
others who _ though they survived _ carried with them throughout
their remaining lives the permanent scars of the horrors they
suffered,'' said Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, R-Kans.,
himself a wounded veteran of the war.
   With the division flags of the U.S. military units that
liberated the Nazi concentration camps posted as sentinels in the
background, the Eisenhower Liberation Medal was presented
posthumously to General of the Army Omar N. Bradley, who was
present at the liberation of the Ohrdruf concentration camp in 1945.
   The medal was accepted by Bradley's daughter, Mrs. Benjamin
Henry Dorsey, who said that when he returned from the war the first
thing the general told his wife was about his visit to the camp,
saying he had been ``almost overcome by the stench of death.''
   ``Nothing he had seen during the war had prepared him for this
horror,'' Mrs. Dorsey said. ``The memory of what he saw stayed with
my father all his life.''
   The general died in 1981.
   Speakers at the ceremony noted that construction will begin next
month of the United States Holocaust Museum near the mall leading
from the Capitol to the Washington Monument.
   Harvey M. Myerhoff, chairman of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial
Council, said its purpose will be ``to tell the story of the
victims in their own words with a few material remnants of their
destroyed culture.''
   He issued an appeal for the donation by governments and
individuals of artifacts of the Holocaust period ``so that we can
tell the story accurately and powerfully.''
   ``This museum will rise like a phoenix from the ashes to be a
symbol of remembrance for all Americans,'' Myerhoff said.
   Each of the six candles were lit by two people, one a member of
Congress, the other a survivor of the death camps.
   Later, at a meeting called to present a progress report on fund
raising for the museum, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of
Maine said the new institution will be a symbol of a certain kind
of hope: ``Hope that no other such memorial need ever be built
anywhere on the earth.''

<HEAD>U.S. Agrees To Move Military Bases From Seoul</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has agreed to move
its military headquarters in South Korea from central Seoul to
rural areas, the Defense Ministry announced Tuesday.
   Under an agreement with South Korea, the headquarters and other
U.S. bases in central Seoul will be moved by the mid-1990s, the
ministry said.
   South Korea wants to relocate the bases to help meet growing
demands for new offices and homes in the crowded capital. The
Americans promised to move the bases if South Korea provides
comparable facilities elsewhere.
   ``The first element of this plan calls for the early return of
the 8th U.S. Army golf course during 1990, with the full relocation
of the affected forces in (the) mid-1990s,'' the announcement said.
   South Korean officials said they probably will convert the
course into a public park.
   The Seoul barracks have been headquarters of the 8th U.S. Army
and other American forces since the United States backed South
Korea in the 1950-53 Korean War.
   U.S. and South Korean officials agree political and economic
changes have caused South Korea to reassess its relationship with
the United States.
   The two sides are negotiating the future of U.S. bases in South
Korea, and South Korea wants to revise agreements to secure greater
jurisdiction over the 43,000 U.S. soldiers stationed under a mutual
defense pact.
   A majority of South Koreans support the presence of U.S.
soldiers in their country. U.S. officials say the forces will
remain as long as their presence is desired by a majority of South
Koreans.
   Dissidents and radical students demand the immediate withdrawal
of the U.S. troops, contending they hamper unification with
communist North Korea.
   Korea was divided in 1945, when U.S. and Soviet soldiers
terminated Japan's colonial rule at the end of World War II.

   Soldiers on patrol in the Andes encountered a

government said Tuesday.
   A government statement said the battle took place Monday near
Vischongos, 215 miles southeast of Lima in Ayacucho state, and one
soldier also was killed.
   Security forces have reported killing more than 100 guerrillas
in the past month.
   The statement said the soldiers encountered an undetermined
number of guerrillas from the Shining Path, a Maoist group whose
insurgency began in Ayacucho nine years ago, but gave no details.
   Officials say more than 14,000 civilians, rebels, policemen and
soldiers have been killed since the Shining Path began fighting in
1980.

<TEXT>
   American Bar Association officials took
exception Tuesday to a statement by Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh that the ABA had agreed to stop assessing the political
and ideological views of judicial nominees.
   Harold R. Tyler Jr., chairman of the ABA's Standing Committee on
Federal Judiciary, said no formal agreement with the Bush
administration has been reached on changing the wording of the
screening panel's guidelines.
   Tyler said the ABA has ``expressed a willingness'' in informal
discussions with Thornburgh to change or delete a sentence from its
guidelines which says: ``Political or ideological philosophy are
not considered, except to the extent they may bear upon the other
factors.''
   ``I don't think we have reached any agreement on the exact
language'' of the changes to be made, Tyler said.
   Even if the sentence is changed or deleted, Tyler said, ``we
don't think there has been any change at all'' in the way the
committee will screen candidates for the federal bench.
   Earlier in the day, Thornburgh told a House committee that ``we
are pleased that the American Bar Association's Standing Committee
on the Judiciary has seen fit to withdraw from an area not only
contentious but in my view improper for their consideration _ that
is to say the political and ideological views of the prospective
nominees.''
   Tyler also expressed puzzlement at Thornburgh's characterization
of the role of Robert B. Fiske Jr. in forging the ``agreement.''
   ``I don't know what to say about Fiske. I am in the peculiar
position of being a friend of Fiske.''
   Tyler acknowledged he had discussed the issue and others with
Fiske. ``The problem is I didn't realize I was in any
negotiation,'' Tyler said.
   The attorney general's statements crediting Fiske's role in the
discussions appeared to be an attempt to mollify conservative
opposition to the New York lawyer's anticipated nomination as
deputy attorney general.
   Fiske, whom Thornburgh told the committee is his choice for the
job, has been criticized by conservatives for subverting Reagan
administration judicial nominees when he chaired the ABA panel.
   The attorney general told the House Judiciary Committee that
``largely through the efforts of Robert Fiske... we have reached
agreement with the ABA (that) they will revert to their prior role
in handling judicial assessments and will henceforth ... restrict
their examination and assessment only to those areas where they
have special expertise.''
   The attorney general's aide, David Runkel, said Fiske ``played a
central role'' in mediating the issue and ``in getting the
committee to agree to the points raised by the attorney general.''
   Told of Tyler's statements, Runkel said ``it is our
understanding based on personal discussions between ABA leaders and
top aides to the attorney general'' that the group had agreed to
delete the phrase ``except to the extent they may bear upon other
factors.''
   Runkel said this understanding was ``based on an exchange of
letters.... between the attorney general and the ABA last week.''
   Thornburgh said the ABA's judicial screening unit had agreed to
restrict its review to judicial competence, temper and integrity.
   Following the Senate defeat of Robert Bork's nomination to the
Supreme Court, the ABA's committee has been the object of
criticism, particularly, but not exclusively, from Republicans,
that it improperly considers a nominee's political views.
   Tyler told the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1987 that four of
the panel's members voted against recommending Bork because of his
``comparatively extreme views respecting constitutional
principles.''
   But ABA officials deny that ideology or politics are sole
factors, except insofar as they might influence judicial
candidate's temperament.
   ``We have never gotten into political ideology, so there is no
change,'' ABA President Robert Raven said, when told of
Thornburgh's remarks.
   Thornburgh's comments about Fiske appeared to be aimed at
mollifying Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., and other conservatives
who could make trouble for Fiske if he is nominated for deputy
attorney general.
   In an April 17 letter to President Bush, Humphrey charged when
Fiske chaired the ABA standing committee ``there is evidence that
that committee's evaluations were tainted with ideological bias
against conservative nominees selected by President Reagan.''
   Humphrey said that ``careful consideration be given the
complaints raised against him.''

<TEXT>
   Britain, the Soviet Union and India were involved
in a foiled plot to return exiled King Zahir Shah of Afghanistan to
power, a broadcast report said Tuesday.
   Independent Television News said Afghan rebels prevented the
king's return by cutting off Kandahar airport in southern
Afghanistan in a fierce battle. The independent commercial network
did not say when the battle took place.
   In Rome, where the 74-year-old king now lives, his spokesman,
Gen. Abdul Wali, said of the report: ``It's absolutely new to me. I
know nothing about it.''
   ITV quoted the Moslem rebels fighting Afghanistan's Marxist
government as saying the plan was discussed when British Foreign
Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe met with them during his March visit to
Pakistan, where major guerrilla groups are based.
   It said the rebels also believe it was discussed during Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's trip to London last month, and
between Howe and Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
   A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: ``We haven't seen it
(the report) ourselves, so we're not in a position to comment.'' He
spoke anonymously in keeping with British custom.
   The Kabul government and some of the moderate, traditionalist
rebel groups have tried to work out a role for the former monarch,
who has lived in Rome since he was ousted in a 1973 coup.
   But hard-line rebel leaders reject any role for the king in
future Afghan governments. The king has said he is willing to help
end the fighting but has refused to serve in any Marxist-dominated
government.

   A moderate earthquake shook the states of
Mexico and Guerrero in the pre-dawn hours Tuesday, frightening
people but causing no casualties or damage, officials said.
   The quake measured 5 on the Richter scale and was centered about
60 miles northeast of the Pacific Coast resort of Acapulco in
Guerrero state, the National University's Geophysical Institute
said.
   It said the temblor could be felt in Mexico City, where a large
quake measuring 6.8 on the Richter scale caused panic a week ago.
The April 25 quake killed one person and injured four people.
   In 1985, a quake in Mexico City crumbled many buildings in the
capital and killed at least 9,500 people.
   Seismologists in Acapulco said the temblor on Tuesday lasted
seven seconds. The Central Fire Station in Mexico City said the
ground in the capital shook for 20 seconds.
   An earthquake measuring 5 on the scale can cause considerable
damage in populated areas and one measuring 6 can cause severe
damage.
   The Richter scale gauges the energy released by an earthquake as
measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every
increase of one number of the scale indicates a tenfold increase in
the magnitude.

   Lucille Ball's fans gave her
widower a block-long sympathy card Tuesday amid a worldwide
outpouring of affection for the comedian who died last week.
   Gary Morton, widower of the redheaded clown from TV's ``I Love
Lucy,'' accepted the missive contained on 127 poster-sized cards
stretched along the Walk of Fame on Hollywood Boulevard. Miss Ball
had two stars embedded in the walk, honoring her film and
television careers.
   ``When you're married to someone for 29 years, you just don't
know _ you don't take it for granted _ but you just don't know the
love that's out there,'' Morton said.
   ``This is beyond all expectations. I can't believe how beautiful
the world has been to her.''
   Miss Ball died at age 77 Wednesday of a ruptured aorta while
recovering from heart surgery. She was buried over the weekend
after a private service at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the
Hollywood Hills.
   The cards were presented by Peggy Robinson, a shoe store manager
who put out blank cards over a five-day period.
   Ms. Robinson, 35, said she found the first card at one of Miss
Ball's starts Thursday morning. Fans were so eager to sign it that
they were writing over each other's words, so she bought six cards
which were completely filled in 15 minutes.
   She bought another six, and the same thing happened.
   ``I just kept going until I finished the sidewalk,'' Ms.
Robinson said.
   The cards lay undisturbed until she picked them up Monday.
   ``People were still signing as I was taking it up. People were
saying, `Oh, I didn't get a chance to sign yet,''' Ms. Robinson
said.
   Her favorite expression was written by street gang members:
``The homeboys of East L.A. love and miss Lucy.''
   One woman left a lock of her red hair and signed, ``From a
fellow redhead.''
   The cards, folded into a manageable stack, were presented by Ms.
Robinson and Hollywood Chamber of Commerce officials Bill Welsh and
Johnny Grant on a sidewalk outside a Sunset Boulevard office
building.
   They said the crowds that gathered by the sidewalk star all
weekend were unusually large, even in this celebrity-worshipping
city.
   ``We have never seen a demonstration of affection such as we
have seen on this particular occasion,'' Welsh said. ``She was a
part of people's lives so many years.''

   Country music's popularity seems to be ebbing in

   WBOS, the only FM country music station in Boston, switched
formats last week, joining several other stations in the Northeast
that have hopped off the country-western hayride and onto an
accelerating oldies bandwagon.
   However, the city still has two country stations on the AM band.
   The last boom in country music in New England was in 1981, after
the release of ``Urban Cowboy,'' the John Travolta-Debra Winger
flick that sent sales of bolo ties and oval belt buckles soaring.
   ``The last year or couple of years, they've really been
struggling to get big sales in country and western records,'' said
Russ Johnson, president of Tower Records, a Sacramento,
Calif.-based chain of 54 music stores.
   Nationally, country is still the most popular radio format,
bolstered by President Bush's well-publicized fondness for the
Nashville sound and by the continuing appeal of crossover artists
like Emmy Lou Harris and Kenny Rogers.
   There are 2,421 country stations in the United States, compared
with 2,325 adult contemporary stations, the next biggest category,
according to the National Association of Broadcasters in Washington.
   But in New York and New England, contemporary dominates country,
249 to 69.
   Several stations that still provide western fare for Yankees
said they can survive on their loyal base of listeners but will
have to wait for the next boom to get rich.
   ``Everything in this business is cyclical and we know it will
come back eventually,'' said Bill McCarthy, general manager of
WDLW, one of two Boston AM stations sticking with the format.
   WBOS's owner, Ackerley Communications of Seattle, hired program
director Bob Brooks from WJFK-FM in Washington to design the new
``album classics'' format for middle- and upper-class listeners
over age 25 _ the group advertisers most want to reach.
   Brooks declined to comment on the station's finances, but said
Ackerley had concluded that country music was ``not commercially
viable in this market.''
   Not everyone agrees. WORC-AM in Worcester had less than $250,000
in annual billings and was losing $20,000 a month until it switched
from Top 40 to country 4{ years ago. Now it is approaching $1
million in billings and racking up solid profits, said programming
director and announcer Dave O'Gara.
   ``It's a hip sound,'' O'Gara said. ``If you're a 40-year-old man
or woman and you're not into heavy metal, but you want something
more snappy than what you hear on the elevator, then country music
provides a good answer.''

<HEAD>Increased Threat Seen from Third World Missiles</HEAD>

   A joint Argentine-Iraqi-Egyptian project to
produce medium-range ballistic missiles has fallen far behind
schedule due to allied export controls, a top State Department
official said Tuesday.
   Other officials said the missile, known as Condor 2, is several
years away from being tested. ``We expected it to be tested two
years ago, at least,'' said one official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The official said part of the technology required for the
missile, which is being developed in Argentina and bankrolled by
Iraq and Egypt, was withheld by the United States. Other parts were
held back by U.S. allies.
   But ``we worry some technology did manage to get through,'' the
official said.
   Israeli officials have accused West German firms of helping the
Condor 2, which could eventually be used to carry nuclear or
chemical warheads.
   Allen Holmes, assistant secretary of state, told a Senate Armed
Services defense subcommittee that the Condor 2 ``is far behind
schedule and we believe this can be traced to problems in acquiring
technology'' from signatories of the Missile Technology Control
Regime (MTCR).
   The MTCR was established to limit the spread of missiles in the
Third World. It includes the United States, Japan, West Germany,
Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
   ``Ballistic missiles _ relatively expensive and relatively
difficult to acquire _ are spread throughout the Third World...,''
testified Jim E. Hinds, deputy assistant secretary of Defense, to
the subcommittee on Defense Industry of the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
   ``Cruise missiles are generally cheaper and will become more
available. As the hardware for large, unmanned aircraft and more
accurate guidance systems becomes increasingly widespread, we will
be faced with a new kind of threat.''
   Ballistic missiles can be large and highly destructive. Cruise
missiles are smaller and easier to hide.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said there is already enough
tension in the Middle East without the introduction of cruise
missiles.
   ``Just in this area, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Israel, Libya, Saudi
Arabia, North and South Yemen all have ballistic weapons
capability,'' he said. ``This is a frightening situation.''
   Holmes said the Bush administration is trying to get the Soviet
Union and China to cooperate in controlling the sale of missiles,
but he made plain he doesn't think such cooperation will solve the
problem.
   ``India, Israel and others have independent technological
capability to construct large rockets,'' he said.
   DeConcini said India is planning to test a new missile called
the Agni, which could carry a nuclear warhead 1,000 to 1,500 miles.
India exploded a single atomic device in 1974.
   DeConcini suggested that countries getting U.S. aid be told that
such missiles cost billions which could be used for development.

<TEXT>
   Yasser Arafat said Tuesday the PLO charter, which
calls for the destruction of Israel, is outdated and he favors a
Middle East peace settlement based on the existence of both Israel
and a Palestinian state.
   The PLO chairman was asked about the charter provision during a
television interview on the first day of an official visit to
France, and he replied:
   ``I was elected on a political program which is founded on the
basis of two states,'' Israel and Palestine. ``As for the charter,
there is an expression in French, it is `caduc.''' Caduc means
outdated, or void.
   Initial reaction from Israel and from a major U.S. Jewish
organization was that Arafat's statement was angled at public
relations and changed nothing.
   President Francois Mitterrand took the occasion of a 90-minute
meeting with Arafat at the beginning of his two-day visit to
express concern that the charter still contains a provision for
Israel's destruction.
   Pierre Mauroy, leader of the governing Socialist Party, met with
Arafat later and said he too brought up the charter.
   He said the PLO chief responded: ``This text has existed for
many years and is now outdated. The leadership of the PLO was
elected with a program that includes recognition of Israel and the
abandonment of terrorism.''
   Israel frequently cites the charter provision as reason it will
not deal with the Palestine Liberation Organization, which it
considers a terrorist organization. Last December, the PLO chief
publicly renounced terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist.
   Arafat, smiling and in uniform, arrived in Paris on Tuesday to
an official greeting just below that for a chief of state: red
carpets at the airport but no Palestinian flags; high-level talks
but no greeting on the tarmac by the head or government or state.
   France's Jewish community largely disapproved of the visit. In
the Jewish-dominated Paris garment district, shopkeepers and
manufacturers set off their burglar alarms simultaneously for five
minutes to show displeasure.
   Israeli activists protested outside the French consulate in
Jerusalem and the embassy in Tel Aviv.
   Tuesday is Israel's national day of mourning for the 6 million
Jewish victims of the Nazis.
   Hubert Vedrine, spokesman for Mitterrand, read a statement
implying the president urged Arafat to drop the charter article
about the destruction of Israel.
   ``During the meeting, Mr. Francois Mitterrand noted that the
continuation in force of the charter of the PLO, adopted in 1964,
was contrary to important points of the political program adopted
by the Palestine National Council in Algiers on Nov. 15, 1988, and
he believed things should be made clear,'' the statement said.
   Acting as the PLO legislature, the council declared an
independent Palestinian state at the Algiers meeting and implicitly
recognized Israel by accepting pertinent U.N. resolutions. In
December, Arafat explicitly renounced terrorism and recognized
Israel's right to exist.
   The statement read by the presidential spokesman said Arafat was
received in his position as head of the PLO Executive Committee and
in the context of the PLO's adoption of U.N. resolutions
``concerning the recognition of the State of Israel and its rights
and to the renunciation by the PLO of any form of terrorism.''
   Avi Pazner, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
commented in Jerusalem, ``We do not have to take with seriousness
every utterance from the mouth of Arafat. He has a rich record of
making false declarations for public relations.''
   Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Allon Liel said, ``As far as
Israel is concerned, there still has not been a specific decision
by the Palestine National Council to void the charter. It still
exists.''
   In New York, chairman Seymour D. Reich of the Conference of
Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations also remarked
that only the Palestine National Council can change the PLO charter
_ by a two-thirds vote at a special meeting _ and refused to do so
in Algiers.
   Reich called Arafat's statement ``meaningless'' and said it was
clearly meant ``to give President Mitterrand some comfort for
embarrassing himself and France by receiving with honor the world's
ranking terrorist.''

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega has been
burning up the campaign trail even though he remains an issue, not
a candidate, in Sunday's presidential elections.
   Noriega, whose command of the Panamanian Defense Forces gives
him de facto control of Panama, is supporting a business associate,
Carlos Duque, against an opposition coalition headed by Guillermo
Endara.
   ``He cannot stay impartial in this campaign,'' said Maj. Edgardo
Lopez, a Defense Forces spokesman. ``Impartiality at this time
would be irresponsibility on his part.''
   But Noriega has made few joint appearances with his candidate.
Instead, he has been working on his own image with regular visits
to hamlets, labor unions and civic groups.
   On Tuesday, Noriega laid the cornerstone of a housing project
for the poor in Panama City. A truck stopped by and served free
beer to the estimated 200 people who showed up for the general's
appearance.
   Noriega has survived all attempts to oust him, from U.S.
economic sanctions to a failed coup last year. He has retained his
grip through government political parties and the Defense Forces,
whose members are the only visible authority in most rural towns.
   He has also tried to build an image as a Panamanian nationalist
persecuted by the U.S. government, and as a champion of the poor.
   In his visits to small towns, Noriega mingles with residents and
listens to their complaints and requests for help with community
projects. Many of those projects are then carried out by the local
Defense Forces unit.
   In his speeches, Noriega has said the 500 municipal councilmen
to be elected Sunday must be turned into a ``people's power''
assembly.
   Noriega went from a close friend and associate of intelligence
agencies in the United States to a wanted man last year after he
was indicted in Florida on drug-trafficking charges.
   He denies the charges, saying they stem from his refusal to
cooperate with U.S. government plans to train Nicaraguan rebels
here for an invasion of Nicaragua.
   Former White House adviser Adm. John Poindexter ``came to try to
convince the general in 1985,'' said Maj. Lopez, a close associate
of the general. ``When he left, he refused to shake Noriega's hand
and told him `be prepared to face the consequences.'''
   Shortly thereafter, Lopez claimed, the campaign against Noriega
began in the United States.
   Washington demanded Noriega's ouster last year after he was
indicted. But President Eric Delvalle, who had been handpicked by
Noriega, was deposed when he tried to fire the general.
   The U.S. government imposed economic sanctions and the
opposition has echoed demands that the general must leave.
   Noriega personally answered charges by opposition vice
presidential candidate Ricardo Arias Calderon, the only time he got
directly involved in the campaign.
   Arias had called Noriega a ``nail in the side'' that had to be
removed. Noriega said he would drive the nail deeper. It became a
government slogan.
   Arias also angered Noriega and the military recently when he
said publicly that a opposition government could live with any
military leader except Noriega. It was seen as an invitation to a
coup.
   On April 21, Noriega joined Duque on a four-hour march at the
head of the largest demonstration held by pro-government groups.
But the rally was not overtly political _ it was organized by the
Defense Forces under the banner ``March of Friends of the Defense
Forces.''

   Lawmakers fed up with ``junk mail'' clogging
fax machines nationwide on Tuesday called for a federal ban on
unsolicited ads transmitted to companies that say they don't want
the materials.
   ``Not only are unsolicited fax transmissions costly and
annoying, but they are also an invasion of privacy,'' said Rep.
Christopher Shays, R-Conn.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce telecommunications subcommittee, introduced legislation
Tuesday that would require direct marketing firms and other
advertisers to maintain lists of targeted customers who specify
they do not want to receive fax advertisements.
   ``This bill would return a measure of control to fax machine
owners,'' said Markey, who noted that advertisements range from
real estate offerings to facsimile supplies.
   The Facsimile Advertising Regulation Act also would require ad
senders who buy new fax machines to use machines that identify the
senders and provide the time of transmission and telephone numbers
on each page.
   The United States has experienced an explosion of fax machines
in recent years. An estimated 1 million were sold in 1987, 1.5
million last year and an anticipated 2.5 million machines this
year, according to the American Facsimile Association.
   With that has come a proliferation of direct marketing groups
using facsimile machines, tying up already overused fax machines
and limiting companies' ability to transmit urgent documents. In
addition, receiving companies have to pay for the paper used by
unsolicited advertisements.
   ``Coupled with a computer or automatic dialer, an advertiser's
fax machine can deliver tens of thousands of unsolicited messages a
week to other fax machines across the country,'' Markey said.
   Receiving companies have little recourse while manufacturers
continue to search for a design that would deny access to senders
who do not know a special password.
   But Margaret Gottlieb, director of state government affairs at
the Direct Marketing Association, which represents 3,000 direct
marketing firms, denied that unsolicited fax advertisements are
causing problems.
   She said the Federal Communications Commission has received only
20 complaints about unsolicited fax transmissions, compared to
8,000 complaints on telephone solicitations.
   ``We really think that it's premature for an issue to be
legislated where there's no real problem,'' she said.
   Gottlieb also argued against a federal ban on legal grounds,
saying it would violate 1st Amendment guarantees of freedom of
speech.
   ``The question is, can speech in this form be regulated or
restricted completely?'' she asked. ``We would say an outright ban
would be unconstitutional.'' Gottlieb said the association
considers the Markey bill an ``outright ban.''
   More than a dozen state legislatures are weighing similar
measures, including Connecticut, Vermont, New York, New Jersey,
Maryland, Florida, California, Washington, New Mexico, Illinois,
Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. All the measures were introduced
for the first time this year, Gottlieb said.
   None has been enacted, although the Maryland bill has been
passed by the Legislature and awaits action by the governor, she
added.
   Markey's subcommittee is expected to have a hearing on the
federal fax bill along with other telemarketing issues,
congressional aides said.

   The Associated Press, in an obituary of
former Teamsters President Roy Lee Williams, misidentified James R.
Hoffa as one of the people referred to in a quotation by William J.
McCarthy, the current Teamsters president.
   McCarthy was referring to Roy Lee Williams and to Jackie
Presser, another former Teamsters president, not to Hoffa, when he
said in testimony before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations in Washington April 4, ``One was a cheat and one was
a liar and both were mixed up with La Cosa Nostra by their own
admissions. I didn't care for either one of them.''
   Hoffa, also a former president of the union, disappeared in
1975. McCarthy became president after Presser's death last year.

   Opposition leaders in Poland and Turkey condemned authorities
Tuesday for using force during bloody confrontations with May Day
protesters.
   Britain complained to Czechoslovakia about the treatment of a
British journalist, who said he was punched during his arrest
Monday at a demonstration in Prague.
   In Gdansk, Poland, Solidarity chief Lech Walesa lodged his
protest against police at a meeting with a government minister,
aides to the labor leader said on condition of anonymity.
   Walesa told Jozef Oleksy, the minister who deals with trade
unions, that he was unhappy with the use of force by police to
break up small May Day labor rallies by banned groups in Gdansk and
the southern city of Wroclaw.
   At least three people were injured, dissident sources said.
   In Ankara, Turkey, opposition leader Erdal Inonu blamed Premier
Turgut Ozal's government for May Day clashes in Istanbul that left
one person dead and 36 people injured. Police detained 532 people.
   Inonu, leader of the Social Democrat Populist Party, called for
the resignation of Interior Minister Abdulkadir Aksuto, who
supervises security forces.
   ``It is our right to know who ordered policemen to fire at these
people?'' Inonu said in a speech to Parliament.
   The interior minister told lawmakers that security forces opened
fire when demonstrators at unauthorized marches attacked them with
stones.
   He said the protesters carried flags with the communist
hammer-and-sickle and displayed banners with Kurdish slogans.
Kurdish rebels are fighting for a separate state.
   Britain said it lodged its ``strong protest'' with
Czechoslovakia after Prague police arrested and assaulted a
reporter for the British Broadcasting Corp.
   Misha Glenny, the BBC World Service central Europe
correspondent, was seized and punched by eight policemen while
reporting on a May Day demonstration in Wenzeslas Square.
   Glenny was one of at least three dozen people detained at
anti-government protests that sprang up around an official May Day
parade.
   The British Foreign office said it summoned the Czechoslovak
charge d'affaires in London, Roman Hronek, to receive the
government's protest, a Foreign Office spokesman said.
   West Berlin officials said 335 police officers were injured and
75 buildings looted in May Day riots that stretched into early
Tuesday. They blamed the violence on 2,000 leftist militants.

   An unlicensed midwife on trial for murder in
the deaths of three babies unexpectedly pleaded guilty Tuesday to
involuntary manslaughter and insurance fraud in a plea bargain with
the prosecution.
   Dolores Doyle, 36, had been accused along with Dr. Milos Klvana
of bungling high-risk out-of-hospital baby deliveries in which
mothers should have been hospitalized.
   Mrs. Doyle, who has been in jail for more than two years while
awaiting trial, was immediately sentenced to eight years in prison.
The sentence was stayed, and she was to be released within 24 hours
on five years probation, according to Deputy District Attorney
Brian Kelberg.
   Klvana's trial in the deaths of eight infants and a fetus
between 1982 and 1986, will continue, Kelberg said. It is in recess
because Klvana, 47, is ill and undergoing medical tests in jail.
   Mrs. Doyle pleaded guilty to three counts of involuntary
manslaughter, seven counts of insurance fraud, five counts of
unlawfully practicing medicine without a license and one count of
conspiracy to practice medicine without a license.
   Mrs. Doyle had been charged in three of the eight baby deaths
involving Klvana, who is charged with second-degree murder,
insurance fraud and grand theft.
   In return for her guilty plea, prosecutors dropped three
second-degree murder charges.
   Kelberg said Mrs. Doyle had been offered the same deal earlier,
but decided to accept it after becoming so emotionally distraught
in court last week that she had to be taken to see a psychiatrist.
   The agreement was approved by Superior Court Judge Judith
Chirlin.
   As a condition of her probation, Mrs. Doyle was ordered not to
engage in the practice of medicine or associate with anyone
practicing medicine.
   Mrs. Doyle's attorney, Maxwell Keith, told jurors in his opening
statement last month that the midwife believed in childbirth as ``a
spiritual experience'' and was dedicated to tending women who
shunned hospital births for religious or economic reasons.
   He said she insisted on strict prenatal care and protected the
health of mothers and babies.

   Coast Guard Commandant Paul A. Yost on
Tuesday attacked Exxon's plan to clean up the Alaskan oil spill.
Consumers, politicians and environmentalists expressed their anger
in a one-day ``Boycott Exxon'' campaign.
   Yost, the top federal official tracking the environmental
disaster, said Exxon's plan was poorly drafted and lacking in
specifics. But he stopped short of rejecting it, saying he wanted
to meet with Exxon and state officials.
   In Washington, consumer activist Ralph Nader said Exxon ``should
not be allowed to forget'' the spill and that a boycott would send
the oil giant a message.
   He and others blasted Exxon for failing to be prepared for the
spill and not rapidly responding to the accident that fouled
hundreds of miles of Alaska's coast. They also questioned
subsequent increases in gas prices.
   ``We are beginning the war of words and actions against any oil
company that doesn't understand its responsibility to protect the
environment,'' Massachusetts state Sen. Carol Amick told a boycott
rally in Boston.
   In Anchorage, about 400 chanting and sign-waving protesters
rallied in front of Exxon's Alaskan headquarters to urge a consumer
boycott.
   J. Edward Surette Jr., executive director of the Bay State
Gasoline Retailers Association in Billerica, Mass., said it was too
early to assess the boycott's impact.
   Exxon spokeswoman Sarah Johnson said 10,000 credit cards out of
7 million have been cut up and returned to the company since the
spill.
   The oil company's cleanup strategy must gain Yost's approval
before being put into effect. Yost said he would make a decision on
the proposal within a week.
   ``The plan is very thin,'' he told a news briefing. ``There's
not a lot of backup or substantiation. It was quite light, very
thin. There must have been a lot of figures there that I haven't
seen.
   ``We are going to be done this summer,'' Yost said. ``Some
beaches are going to be sparkling, some beaches are going to be far
from sparkling.''
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, who is to make his
second trip to Alaska on Wednesday as overall coordinator for the
cleanup, said he expected the size of the operation to double or
triple by the end of the month.
   In a speech at the National Press Club in Washington, Skinner
called the spill ``the most significant environmental disaster this
nation has ever faced.''
   However, he said the cleanup, to be paid for by the oil
industry, could add $100 million to $500 million to Alaska's
economy, which he said is more than the effect of the fishing
industry.
   Exxon released a statement that called the boycott unjust. Exxon
President William D. Stevens said the company was ``turning heaven
and Earth to set things right.''
   Exxon's 60-page, two-part revised strategy to cleanse some 364
miles of Alaska's coastline of the oil spilled March 24 by the
tanker Exxon Valdez was released Monday. The tanker struck a reef
25 miles from Valdez, spilling more than 10 million gallons of
crude oil into Prince William Sound.
   About 300 miles from the spill site, an observer saw thousands
of dead birds in a wide tidal basin in the Hallo Bay area.
   ``We saw 2,000 to 3,000 dead birds. ... You can't really tell
what they are. They're one big blob of oil,'' said Ray Bane,
superintendent of Katmai National Park, about 275 miles southwest
of Valdez.
   ``We found large oil debris washing and slopping up on our
shores. ... It was very bad,'' Bane said. ``We saw eagles carrying
oil-covered birds. We saw one eagle so coated in oil that it
couldn't fly.''
   State and federal officials said the focus of the cleanup is
moving southwest, following the drifting oil along the Alaska
Peninsula through the Shelikof Strait east of Kodiak Island. Oil
has tainted the coast at least as far as Chignik, 525 miles
southwest of Valdez.
   The tanker is undergoing preliminary repairs in the sound, and
is to be moved next month to Portland, Ore., home of the only
drydock on the West Coast capable of handling the 987-foot ship.
   In its proposal, Exxon said it wants to burn or bury the sludge
recovered in the cleanup, which may require exemptions from Alaska
environmental law.
   But Bill Lamoreaux, the ranking state environmental officer at
the spill, said the laws would not be relaxed. ``The general
feeling is that we would expect that they would comply with the
environmental laws,'' Lamoreaux said.
   Exxon's plan also notes that 191 miles of coastline it describes
as ``lightly oiled'' may be left untouched to be cleansed naturally
by wind and water.
   Lamoreaux said, ``When we talk about `light oiling,' it doesn't
mean it won't have a devastating effect on wildlife.''
   U.S. Sens. James Exon and Bob Kerrey, both Nebraska Democrats,
called on U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to investigate
potential price gouging by the oil industry. They noted that gas
prices in Nebraska rose 20 percent from the first of March until
mid-April.
   State attorneys general in Washington, Oregon and Idaho echoed
the call.
   Since the Exxon Valdez accident, gas prices have increased an
average 10 percent nationally, while the Northwest saw surges as
high as 25 percent in less than a month, said Marla Rae, executive
assistant to Oregon Attorney General Dave Frohnmayer.
   At a news conference in Houston, Exxon President Stevens said it
showed ``shocking naivete'' to blame the price hikes on his company.
   ``As you know,'' he told reporters, ``the market for petroleum
products is set by thousands of markets, thousands of independent
dealers across the nation.''

<HEAD>Founder Of Democratic Socialist Party Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The founder and former chairman of Japan's
opposition Democratic Socialist Party, Ikko Kasuga, died Tuesday of
pneumonia, hospital officials said. He was 79.
   Kasuga, a member of Parliament, died Tuesday at Nagoya City
University Hospital, said a spokesman for the hospital in Nagoya,
central Japan.
   In 1960, Kasuga left the Japan Socialist Party over an
ideological difference and formed the Democratic Socialist Party _
now Japan's third largest opposition party _ along with the late
Suehiro Nishio. Kasuga became the party's secretary-general in 1967
and was elected chairman in 1971.
   During his tenure as chairman, Kasuga proposed forming a
coalition government along with other opposition party members or
some members of the governing Liberal Democratic Party.
   He was not successful, and he resigned in 1977. He had been an
adviser to the party since his resignation.
   Kasuga was born into a farm family in central Gifu Prefecture
(state) in 1910 and was first elected to Japan's lower house of
Parliament on the Japan Socialist Party ticket in 1952.
   With the death of Kasuga, the number of seats held by the
Democratic Socialist Party in the powerful 512-member House of
Representatives fell to 28. The largest opposition party is the
Japan Socialist Party with 85 seats, followed by the Komeito, or
Clean Government Party, with 56.
   The Liberal Democrats have a commanding 296 seats in the House,
and the Japan Communist Party has 27.

<HEAD>Court Clerks Strike For Pay Raises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANTHONY CAPLAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of court clerks went on
strike Tuesday in an effort to force the government to pay them the
pay raise it promised them in March.
   The protest came one day after President Carlos Andres Perez,
whose government austerity program prompted violent protests in
February, announced plans to increase benefits for the nation's
workers and its poor.
   Chanting ``We will not enter!'' court functionaries locked the
criminal and civil courts in central Caracas and congregated
outside.
   ``Never mind a pay raise. We just want the raise that was
already promised us,'' said Jorge Iturbe, a court clerk.
   Iturbe said the 30 percent pay raise for civil servants decreed
by the government in March had not been included in their pay
checks. Clerks now earn from $100 to $200 a month.
   The clerks said the daylong walkout was aimed at forcing the
government to grant them the pay raise immediately. Increases for
the public sector usually take several months to become effective.
   The clerks jeered as National Guard troopers cut a chain that
had shut the front doors. The soldiers retreated, and the doors
were closed again.
   Perez announced the 30 percent pay raise for government workers
shortly after the riots, which left at least 300 dead and thousands
injured.
   The riots raised worldwide concerns about the Latin American
economic crisis, the region's $410 billion foreign debt and falling
world prices for its exports.
   Inflation in Venezuela is estimated at 80 percent, and labor
unrest is building.
   The nation's largest union, the Confederation of Venezuelan
Workers, called for a one-day nationwide strike on May 18, the
first in the nation's 30-year democratic history.
   Perez is under pressure by economic advisers to cut government
spending and maintain the austerity measures designed to lead
Venezuela towards a market-oriented economy.
   On Monday, however, Perez announced the government would spent
$540 million on a new series of public works projects, which he
said would create 170,000 jobs in the next two years.
   Perez also announced a program of direct subsidies for food
intended for 600,000 poor families. The program would give target
families $15 monthly per child, with a limit of up to three
children.
   He did not outline how the subsidies would be distributed.

   Police who surrounded a jewelry store
after employees reported a suspicious person casing the joint were
stunned to learn the wigged man was pop superstar Michael Jackson
in disguise.
   In addition to the wig, the Grammy Award-winning singer was
wearing a fake mustache, false teeth and eyelashes while shopping
for rings at Sycamore Plaza here with a 12-year-old boy Monday
afternoon.
   The two went into Zales Jewelers and aroused the suspicion of
the store manager, said H.N. Edwards, a security guard for the
shopping center in this city 30 miles northest of downtown Los
Angeles. Three squad cars were sent to the store.
   ``I asked him `Why are you wearing a false mustache?' '' Edwards
said. ``He said `I have to _ I'm in disguise _ I'm Michael
Jackson.' When he told me this, my first thought was this guy had
gotten off the elevator between floors.''
   Police Sgt. Ken Tacke and Officer Gordon Weeks said they
questioned Jackson, and asked the singer to remove his disguise and
show his identification. He complied.
   ``He told the police he has to wear a disguise when he goes
shopping or he would be mobbed by the crowds,'' Edwards said.
   After Jackson signed autographs, he and the boy drove off in a
late model Mercedes-Benz.

   Police fired tear gas Tuesday at
bottle-throwing farmers who were demonstrating for drought aid in
this southern region, police said. At least five people were
wounded.
   Italian news media gave this account:
   About 1,000 farmers came to Potenza Tuesday demanding to see the
president and agriculture adviser of the regional government based
in the city. After a long wait, the demonstrators got word they
would be received. .
   However, a scuffle broke out. A police spokesman said it began
when demonstrators blocked the doors of the regional government
building, preventing employees from leaving.
   Demonstrators said police charged them without reason.
Government employees said the demonstrators started violently
shoving the police.
   Police, firing tear gas and waving truncheons, waded into the
demonstrators and were met by a barrage of rocks and bottles,
authorities reported.
   The Italian news agency ANSA reported that five police officers
were treated at San Carlo Hospital for injuries. The Italian news
agency AGI said one demonstrator also suffered a head wound.
   No one answered the telephone at regional government offices
later Tuesday.
   The extended drought in the region, 200 miles southeast of Rome,
has hurt the farmers.

<HEAD>Miners, Company Agree to Mediation After Bloody Clash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Striking miners and Virginia's largest coal
company agreed to federal mediation after 140 people were arrested
Tuesday and four were injured in a rock-throwing confrontations
between miners and coal drivers.
   The incidents came on the 28th day of the United Mine Workers
strike and were centered around Pittston Coal Group's Moss No. 3
coal preparation plant in this southwest Virginia community.
Demonstators effectively blockaded the plant.
   ``They aren't running enough coal out of here to fire somebody's
house,'' said strike coordinator Marty Hudson.
   Gov. Gerald L. Baliles announced that the union and the company
had agreed to federal mediation of the dispute. UMW President
Richard Trumka suggested a seven-day cooling off period in which
Pittston would shut down operations and the union would suspend
protests.
   Pittston President Michael Odom said the company ``fully
supported Governor Baliles' request for federal mediation.''
   ``We are ready to begin mediation under the auspices of the
federal Mediation and Conciliation Service and we will make every
effort in that process to resolve the dispute,'' Odom said. He also
called on Trumka to end the strike violence.
   ``It is the continued violence which is distasteful, dangerous
and ultimately destructive of the mediation process,'' Odom said.
   The injuries came during a rock-throwing confrontation along a
road leading to the plant where coal from nearby mines is cleaned,
sorted and loaded into railroad cars.
   According to miner Larry Stanley, about 20 miners were standing
in the rain watching coal trucks drive around a tree downed in the
road when the driver of a four-wheel-drive escort vehicle rammed
into the crowd.
   ``He done his best to run over all he could,'' said Stanley.
``He punched it.''
   But State Police spokesman Charles Vaughn said troopers told him
the injured strikers were in a parked vehicle that was hit by the
coal truck as the driver attempted to flee ``a hailstorm of rocks
thrown by miners.''
   Two miners were taken to the Russell County Medical Center in
nearby Lebanon, said nursing supervisor Debbie Hall. One was
treated and released and the other was admitted for treatment of
bruises.
   Odom said a passenger in the escort vehicle suffered a broken
jaw while the driver of one of the trucks, owned by the Jamb Mining
Co., suffered serious cuts to the head. Both were being treated at
local hospitals.
   The 140 people arrested, some of them miners' wives, sat in
front of the Moss No.3 plant's entrances to block coal trucks that
were coming and going. They were charged with trespassing, said Lt.
C.F. Eaton of the State Police.
   After four busloads of arrested demonstrators were driven away,
others hit the road in their own cars to make the 15-mile drive
between Moss No. 3 and Pittston's Lambert Fork mine in an attempt
to slow coal trucks traveling between the two operations, Hudson
said.
   Hudson estimated about 24 trucks carried coal into the plant,
which did not appear to be operating. About 570 trucks usually make
the trip each day, he said.
   About 1,500 miners in Virginia and West Virginia are on strike.
Miners worked at Pittston for 14 months without a contract before
calling the strike April 5.
   Strike leaders say Pittston, the nation's 15th largest coal
company and second biggest coal exporter, has refused to take part
in contract negotiations and violated labor laws. Both sides agree
that wages are not a major part of the dispute.

   Hailstorms that battered wide areas of southwest
Sichuan province killed 157 people and injured 6,000, the China
Daily said Wednesday.
   The storms, which hit 105 of the province's 175 counties from
April 20 through last week, also destroyed 170,000 houses, the
English-language newspaper said.
   Earlier reports had put the death toll from the storms at 87.
   The newspaper said the provincial government is mobilizing all
departments for rescue and relief operations for the
disaster-affected areas.
   Western Sichuan was also hit by two powerful earthquakes last
month that killed at least 11 people.
   The hailstorms were attributed to collisions of warm and cold
fronts. Hail and windstorms also killed seven people in Guizhou
province to the east of Sichuan in late April.

   Authorities questioned the son of a
minister found shot to death with his wife and two daughters in
their rural parsonage, but declined to say Tuesday whether the
teen-ager was a suspect.
   Robert J. ``Jeff'' Pelley, 17, was questioned Monday night, said
St. Joseph County sheriff's Sgt. Charles Feirrell. He declined to
say whether Pelley had requested legal counsel.
   No arrests have been made in the shooting deaths of the youth's
father, the Rev. Robert L. Pelley, 38; his wife, Dawn, 32; and
daughters Janel, 8, and Jolene, 6.
   The victims' bodies were found Sunday morning in the parsonage
of the Olive Branch Church of the United Brethren in Christ, about
two miles northwest of Lakeville, after the minister failed to show
up for the service.
   Autopsy results indicated the minister and his wife died
Saturday of close-range shotgun wounds to the head, said Feirrell.
Autopsies on the children were incomplete.
   No further information on the autopsies was provided.
   ``This is information known to the suspect and the police, and
at this point we'd like to keep it that way,'' said Feirrell.
   Jeff Pelley returned to his home Tuesday and left with some
personal belongings, police said. He was accompanied by his
grandfather, who police identified as Jack Armstrong of Burlington,
Ky.
   The younger Pelley told authorities he had spent Saturday at
high school prom activities, police said. Police found him Sunday
at an amusement park north of Chicago, where he had driven with
friends.
   Police divers searched a pond across the road from the parsonage
Tuesday, looking for the weapon and other evidence, said Feirrell.
No weapon was found.
   Investigators ruled out burglary and robbery as motives because
the home showed no sign of forced entry. The absence of a weapon
ruled out murder-suicide.
   The parents had been married almost four years; their first
spouses both died, congregation members said. Jeff and Jackie, 14,
were Pelley's children from his first marriage, and Jessica, 10,
Janel and Jolene were Ms. Pelley's daughters.
   Jackie was attending a church camp when the killings occurred,
and Jessica was spending the night with friends, police said.
   A pastor colleague said the Pelleys had experienced some turmoil
in merging the two families, but declined to explain.
   A memorial service for the Pelleys was scheduled for Wednesday
afternoon at their church, with burial in South Bend, which is
about 10 miles north of Lakeville.

   Six riot troopers were killed in
fighting with radical students on Wednesday when police raided a
university in the southern port of Pusan to rescue five officers
being held hostage, officials said.
   The officials said students set fire to a barricade doused with
paint thinner when the raiding force burst in, setting several
police ablaze.
   Police, who refused to give their names, said about 700 troopers
launched a dawn raid on Dongui University to rescue five officers
taken hostage Tuesday after a demonstration by students.
   About 20 other troopers and radical students were injured in the
fighting, 10 of them seriously.
   Students holding the hostages on the seventh floor of the school
library set the thinner-drenched barricade aflame when troopers
burst in and several attacking officers were set on fire, the
officials said on condition of anonymity.
   Some troopers, wrapped in flames, leapt out of windows. Others
choked to death on the smoke or were badly burned, they reported.
Three troopers were dead on arrival at a hospital and three died
while undergoing emergency treatment, they said.
   All of the hostages were later freed when professors intervened
and persuaded the students to let them go, officials said.
   Korean Broadcasting System, the state television network, said
88 students were arrested in the fighting in South Korea's second
largest city.
   National Police Headquarters in Seoul said it was the worst loss
of police life in recent years. Officers could not recall any
comparable incident.
   The students had seized five officers as hostages to protest an
incident Monday when a police officer fired warning shots as
protesters attacked a police station. Radical students claimed
police overreacted by firing. They also demanded release of a
fellow student being held by police, officials said.
   Police officials negotiated unsuccessfully through the night for
the hostages' release and authorities then ordered a raid to free
them.
   South Korea has been hit by a wave of violent protests in recent
weeks by radical students and dissidents demanding the overthrow of
President Roh Tae-woo's government.
   Pusan and other South Korean cities experienced violence Monday
in protests marking the international May Day labor holiday. The
protests came the day after riot police blocked a major labor rally
in Seoul.
   Protests rarely result in deaths in South Korea, however, in
spite of the fury of street clashes in which protesters battle riot
police with firebombs and rocks. Riot police are normally only
armed with tear gas and batons.

<TEXT>
   Army experts cleared military rockets
off an interstate highway Tuesday after the truck carrying them
overturned when its driver swerved to avoid hitting a deer.
   A seven-mile section of Interstate 20 running through this
central Texas town was closed for more than 14 hours after the
truck, carrying eight rocket pods loaded with six rockets each, ran
off the road, authorities said.
   Explosives experts from Fort Hood and Fort Sill, Okla., worked
for more than three hours to remove the rockets, each of which
carried 644 M-77 grenades, said officials with the Texas Department
of Public Safety.
   The rockets were not armed and posed no danger, said David
Harris, spokesman for the U.S. Army Missile Command near
Huntsville, Ala.
   ``Part of the development program involved taking fully loaded
rockets and dropping them 20 to 30 feet onto concrete to see if
they could withstand that kind of impact,'' Harris said.
   Officials evacuated one resident of a mobile home located about
200 yards from the accident site, but allowed her to return seven
hours later, police Sgt. Don Willingham said.
   The driver and a passenger suffered minor injuries, police said.
   ``All I know is I saw a deer and I swerved to miss it,'' said
the driver, Byron Robertson, 27, of Fouke, Ark.
   ``There was no indication of any problem physically with either
the driver or the truck,'' said state Trooper Don Rannefeld.
   The rockets were being transported from the LTV Corp. factory in
Camden, Ark., where they were produced to Concord, Calif., and
ultimately were bound for South Korea, said Col. Bob Richards, a
combat support group commander from Dyess Air Force Base.
   The cargo was taken to the base in Abilene, about 40 miles east
of the accident site, for inspection, said Master Sgt. Al Dostal, a
Dyess spokesman.

   President Bush's drug policy chief pledged
Tuesday not to pinch pennies but said after congressmen pressed
Bush for action on various fronts that choices must be made about
priorities in the war against drugs.
   Bush and members of the House Select Committee on Narcotics
Abuse and Control had what was termed a spirited meeting at the
White House, with the lawmakers presenting assorted concerns about
drug education, interdiction, regional approaches and treatment.
   After the session, William J. Bennett, director of the Office of
National Drug Control Policy, said that ``we're not going to be
pinch-penny in this war on drugs. We're going to have a fiscally
responsible policy, but choices are going to have to be made.''
   Considerable discussion focused on Bennett's decision to make
the District of Columbia an area for intensive anti-drug activity
before completing an overall national strategy, the participants
said. Committee members also said they appreciated gaining access
to Bush.
   ``It was a positive and preliminary meeting,'' said Rep. Mel
Levine, D-Calif. ``The very fact that the meeting was held is
significant, and a good step for the administration. ... President
Bush is willing to work with Congress in a way that President
Reagan was not. He got high marks for having the meeting.''
   Bennett promised to seek additional congressional views and
agreed to meet with the committee next week to further discuss drug
policy.
   ``Most people believe that the effort has to be made on many
fronts. But some choices will have to be made, too, ... about
priorities,'' Bennett said. Choices involve ``what gets more, what
gets the same, where do we throw our weight,'' he added.
   He said all members of Congress have been asked for
recommendations. He added that officials will not know how much the
anti-drug program will cost until various agencies provide
projections involving the various aspects.
   No policy decisions were made at the meeting.
   Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y., the House committee chairman,
said he had wanted assurances from Bush that Bennett's drug policy
coordinating energy ``is not consumed'' by the push Bennett
announced for the capital city.
   ``It was pointed out that when we were drafting the bill'' that
created the drug coordinator position, ``we hd considered him to
lend his expertise to developing a domestic and foreign policy and
not one for the district,'' Rangel said.
   Rangel avoided direct criticism of Bennett, and said he was
satisfied that the administration has promised to have an
international conference on drugs after the drug policy review is
finished in early September.
   Rangel previously voiced objections that the administration was
not taking enough of a global approach. He said the State
Department should include drug policy in the government's foreign
policy considerations with drug-producing countries.
   The meeting ended with a pledge of cooperation on anti-drug
policy between the Bush administration and Congress, the
participants said.
   Rangel predicted there will be no sharp conflict as long as the
administration keeps Congress advised rather than waiting until a
policy is complete and then going to Congress to consult.
   Bennett said the government's effort in Washington is not a
substitute for a national strategy, which is being developed by the
government now, but is part of the overall strategy. He said he
personally is spending little time on the Washington effort,
leaving that to various government departments.

<HEAD>Students Keep Convicted Murderer as Honorary President</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Students at the London School of Economics failed
to muster the two-thirds majority they needed Tuesday to oust the
convicted murderer of a policeman as honorary president of their
union.
   School and government officials responded with anger to the
vote, which allows Winston Silcott to keep the honor given to him
by the students on Thursday. The college's governors said they were
reviewing the school's annual $439,000 grant to the union.
   Education Secretary Kenneth Baker, speaking to the House of
Commons, called the vote ``shameful and despicable.''
   ``This is the loony left hijacking a great institution,'' he
added.
   The students voted 530-305 in favor of removing the jailed man
from the post. However, that tally narrowly failed to meet the
two-thirds majority that would have overturned his election.
   In a separate vote, the students agreed to raise money to buy
flowers for the family of the murder victim.
   Silcott, 29, is one of three men jailed for life for hacking a
policeman to death during a riot in a north London housing project
in 1985.
   Amnesty International, the human rights organization, and Lord
Gifford, a leading jurist, have investigated the case and cast
doubt on the convictions.
   Silcott was nominated for the one-year post by a member of the
school's socialist Labor Club. Just 150 of the school's 4,000
students voted him in to show their belief he may have been wrongly
convicted.
   After the initial vote, the college's Afro-Caribbean Society
said the election of Silcott, who is black, was ``deplorable,
insensitive and patronizing to the black race.''
   On Tuesday, heated exchanges broke out among students after
their new vote. Amanda Hart, the general secretary of the student
union, said she had received several death threats after last
week's vote.
   ``Obviously I am scared, but I will stand by the union's
decision,'' she said.
   Sir Peter Parker, chairman of the school's governors, termed the
students' decision to keep Silcott as their honorary president
``appalling.''
   He said the school could not overturn the decision under the
union's constitution.
   But he added, ``It is very embarrassing and damaging to the
school.
   ``Whatever happens in the union, nothing must happen there that
will damage the worldwide reputation of this school,'' he said.
   The school's director, Indraprasad Patel, said he was seeking
ways for the college to reverse the decision.
   ``They have got to use every device in the rule book to overturn
this disgraceful decision,'' said Sir Marcus Fox, a lawmaker from
the governing Conservative Party.

   Showers and thunderstorms swirled across much of New England,
parts of the South and the Midwest on Tuesday, and a blast of cold
air swept through Arkansas, setting two low-temperature records.
   Much of New England and northern New York were drenched Tuesday
afternoon by continuing showers and thunderstorms.
   Showers and thunderstorms whipped through north central Texas,
eastern and central Oklahoma, southeast Kansas and southwest
Missouri.
   Occasional thunderstorms and showers were widely scattered over
Wisconsin, northern Illinois, Indiana, lower Michigan, southwest
Ohio and northeast Kentucky.
   Cool weather chilled the lower Mississippi Valley early Tuesday,
and several low-temperature records for May 2 were broken or tied
in Arkansas. It was 33 degrees in Calico Rock, breaking the 1973
and 1976 records of 35 degrees; 36 degrees in Ozark, where the
38-degree mark had stood since 1909; and 37 degrees in Fort Smith,
which tied its record set in 1909.
   By contrast, it was 90 degrees in Miami, tying the
high-temperature record set in 1981.
   The nation's low temperature Tuesday morning was 22 degrees in
Kearney and Kimball, Neb. Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m.
EDT ranged from 40 degrees at Bradford, Pa., to 94 degrees at Palm
Springs, Calif.
   The national weather forecast for Wednesday called for showers
from northern New England to inland New York and northern
Pennsylvania, as well as over northwest Montana and along the
Oregon coast; and showers and thunderstorms from Oklahoma to
Arkansas.
   High temperatures for Wednesday were forecast in the upper 40s
and the 50s in northern New England, northwest New York, western
Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, northern lower Michigan and upper
Michigan, as well as much of Montana; the 80s from Florida to the
Gulf Coast states, Texas and much of New Mexico; the 80s and 90s
from southwest Texas to the desert Southwest; and in the 60s and
70s in the rest of the nation.

   Quite a few people know the way to San
Jose. The city once best known as the ``Prune Capital of the
World'' has surpassed San Francisco to become California's third
largest city, a state report says.
   San Jose, which lies at the heart of the high-tech Silicon
Valley region, grew by 10,000 in 1988 to a total population of
738,400, according to the recent report by the state Finance
Department's demographic research unit.
   San Francisco declined by 4,800 people to a population of
731,700 as of Jan. 1, state officials said.
   At the beginning of 1988, San Francisco had 736,500 residents,
8,200 more than its San Francisco Bay rival 40 miles to the south.
Now, 6,700 more people live in San Jose.
   Los Angeles, the state's largest city, grew 1 percent to 3.4
million, while the second largest, San Diego, increased 2.7 percent
to 1.09 million.
   Commenting on the change in his city's status, state Assemblyman
John Burton of San Francisco said, ``It's not the quantity, it's
the quality.''

<TEXT>
   The leftist Sandinista government on
Tuesday rejected an opposition demand to negotiate for more
legislative reforms to guarantee fair elections next year.
   But both government and opposition representatives agreed to
meet again and present their cases to a panel charged with
evaluating whether the Sandinistas have fulfilled promises made in
regional pacts.
   ``To accept (negotiations) is to accept that the government has
not fulfilled its part of the El Salvador accords,'' Rene Nunez,
minister of the presidency, said after a two-hour meeting of the
Committee for National Reconciliation.
   ``The step previous to acknowledging this request is for an
evaluation to be made on whether the El Salvador accords have been
met,'' he added.
   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the archbishop of Managua and
president of the committee, said the panel would meet again May 10
to hear both sides and would then issue its evaluation.
   Nunez attended the meeting representing Vice President Sergio
Ramirez, a committee member representing the Sandinistas.
   Mauricio Diaz, leader of the Popular Social Christian Party and
panel's opposition representative, presented the demand in a letter
addressed to Obando that he read to reporters.
   President Daniel Ortega and the presidents of El Salvador,
Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala signed an agreement in El
Salvador Feb. 14 in which Nicaragua promised electoral and other
legal reforms to ensure fair general elections, which Ortega moved
up by 10 months to Feb. 25, 1990.
   The Sandinista-controlled National Assembly passed the reforms
to electoral and news media laws in March. But the opposition said
their demands were ignored and that the laws passed give the
Sandinistas unfair advantage in balloting.
   Ortega is now on a 10-country tour of Western Europe to seek
financial and political support for Nicaragua. Some of those
governments have said more money to this Central American country
depends on the Sandinistas' fulfillment of regional peace accords.
   At a news conference Tuesday in Athens, Greece, Ortega said he
was trying to find a way to improve relations with the United
States and declared, ``We are not its enemy.''
   He expressed hope that President Bush would change the policies
toward Nicaragua pursued by President Ronald Reagan.
   Bush ``must know that policy failed and that is why he should do
something different,'' he said.
   Nicaragua is suffering a severe economic crisis and badly needs
foreign aid.
   The government blames the crisis on eight years of war with the
U.S.-supported Nicaraguan rebels known as Contras, a four-year U.S.
economic blockade, and devastation wrought by Hurricane Joan in
October.
   The opposition says the Sandinistas' managerial ineptness has
had much to do with the country's economic problems.

   A U.S. proposal for resolving the
internal NATO dispute over short-range nuclear missiles does not
address West German demands for East-West negotiations on the
weapons, an alliance official said Tuesday.
   In Rome, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany said he was open
to ``reasonable compromise'' but wants talks to begin soon. The
United States and Britain have rejected such negotiations.
   Kohl, however, expressed hope the allies could reach a unified
position on the issue during a summit at the end of this month. He
said NATO could negotiate on the battlefield weapons at the same
time it discusses strategic arms, conventional forces and chemical
weapons.
   The comments came after a meeting with Premier Ciriaco De Mita,
who said Italy supports linking the proposed talks on reducing the
short-range nuclear weapons to progress in conventional arms talks.
   In Paris, Foreign Ministers Roland Dumas of France and
Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany told reporters it is
essential that a common position emerge from the NATO summit.
   Most of the short-range Lance missiles are in West Germany, and
a battle fought with such weapons would take place on its territory.
   The NATO official said the American plan suggests the 16-member
North Atlantic Treaty Organization announce unilateral reductions
in its short-range nuclear arsenal and challenge the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact to meet those levels.
   In London, A British Defense Ministry policy paper said the
Soviets have modernized or replaced 95 percent of their short-range
nuclear missile systems in Eastern Europe in the past five years.
   A separate ``fact sheet'' said the Soviet Union ``has been
aggressively pursuing'' modernization of its short-range forces and
now has a 16-1 advantage over NATO west of the Ural Mountains.
   As described by the alliance official, the U.S. plan calls for
reducing the number of weapons as part of a NATO program of
modernizing the Lance missiles.
   Additional reductions in those arms would be linked to progress
in East-West negotiations in Vienna on conventional forces in
Europe, the official said.
   A U.S. official in Washington confirmed the account but said
several other options were under consideration. He said one was
resumption of research and development by West Germany on a missile
that could attack airfields and other targets now covered by the
Lance.
   In Bonn, a German official said: ``The German position remains
clear and unchanged. No decision on modernization until 1992 and
prompt superpower talks on the short-range missiles.''
   He dismissed the U.S. suggestions as ``old stuff that people are
using to divert the discussion from the real issues.''
   None of the three officials would let his name be used.
   Alliance members are seeking acceptable language on the weapons
issue to write into the Comprehensive Concept, a blueprint for NATO
strategy to be presented to the May 29-30 summit at NATO
headquarters in Brussels.
   The NATO official said the American plan pulls together several
ideas that have been put forward in the alliance.
   It would take reductions proposed by U.S. Gen. John Galvin, NATO
supreme military commander in Europe, and challenge the Soviets to
meet them.
   Galvin has urged NATO to upgrade the Lance, arguing that its
modernization would permit a substantial reduction in nuclear
artillery. Military analysts say the missile, introduced in 1972,
will become obsolete in 1995.
   It has a range of a little more than 60 miles, which would be
extended by modernization to more than 250 miles.

<DATELINE>GENOA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardinal Giuseppe Siri, the archbishop of
Genoa and a perennial candidate for the papacy, died at home
Tuesday evening of a heart ailment, an official at the diocesan
chancellery said. He was 82.
   Siri, a cardinal since 1953, attended four conclaves, the
meetings in which popes are elected. He was described as Pope Pius
XII's choice to succeed him, and in the last two conclaves was a
leading vote-getter in early balloting.
   He was frequently depicted as an archconservative who opposed
many of the reforms of Pope John XXIII and who tried to block
progressive initiatives during the Vatican II Council held from
1962-65.
   But Siri rejected the conservative label in a rare interview
with the Genoa newspaper Il Lavoro.
   ``If I had to describe myself, I would describe myself as an
independent, a man who walks alone and is not a member of any
group,'' he said.
   A staunch anti-Communist, he nonetheless maintained working
relations with the Socialist-Communist alliance running Genoa.
   Siri believed that laymen must obey the clergy, and that the
clergy had to make all possible efforts to be available anywhere,
at any time, to laymen. In Genoa, he made sure chaplains were on
duty in major factories, and he encouraged priests to celebrate
Mass in parishioners' homes.
   Siri was born in Genoa on May 20, 1906, the son of a stevedore.
He attended the Pontifical Gregorian University, where he earned a
doctorate in theology.
   Ordained a priest at 22, his early career was mainly in the
framework of Catholic Action, a church organization that seeks to
involve laymen in church activities.
   He wrote several books, the best known being ``Theology for
Laymen.''
   Siri was particularly remembered for his resourcefulness during
World War II, when, as auxiliary bishop of Genoa, he negotiated
with Nazi forces surrounding the city and met secretly with
partisan leaders, eventually arranging a Nazi surrender that
avoided further bombardment of the city.
   He became archbishop of Genoa in 1946. At the time of his
resignation in July 1987, he was the last remaining active cardinal
named by Pope Pius XII.

   Ronald D. Martin, vice president and executive
editor of USA Today, was named editor of The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution on Tuesday, five months after Bill Kovach
resigned the post in a dispute with the newspapers' management.
   Publisher Jay Smith said Martin, 51, was a ``superb newsman who,
better than anyone else I know, understands the importance of a
newspaper that connects with the readers. That's a pressing issue
now.''
   Martin will take over Monday, Smith said.
   Arnold Rosenfeld, who served as interim editor, will become
editor in chief of Cox Newspapers, Smith said.
   Martin was USA Today's original executive editor and got the
title of vice president in 1987. As vice president, he coordinated
USA Today's news activities with other Gannett Co. Inc. members.
   He previously was editor of the Baltimore News-American and US
magazine and was managing editor of several papers including the
Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, The Miami Herald and the New York
Post.
   Martin said he planned to spend some time getting to know
Atlanta before setting any goals.
   ``I'm very excited about the prospects,'' he said. ``I've been
looking at the newspaper very closely the last few days. There are
a lot of good things happening here ... it's a great base to build
on.''
   The Journal-Constitution, which won the 1989 Pulitzer Prize for
investigative reporting, publishes in the morning as The Atlanta
Constitution and in the afternoon as The Atlanta Journal on
weekdays and in a combined edition on Saturday and Sunday. The
newspapers have a combined reporting corps but separate editorial
page staffs.
   Kovach, a former Washington bureau chief for The New York Times,
resigned from the Atlanta newspapers last November after a
disagreement over control of the Cox chain's Washington bureau. He
currently is a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University.

<HEAD>ABC Pulls `Crimes of Passion II' for Lack of Advertisers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC pulled a program dealing with crimes of
passion after advertisers showed no interest in the show, which
included re-enactments of violent crimes, the network announced
Tuesday.
   ``Crimes of Passion II'' was replaced Saturday night by ``Livin'
Large'' and ``Heart and Soul,'' two 1988 comedy pilots that did not
make ABC's program schedule.
   Advertisers have begun to shun explicit programming in response
to protests by viewers. Their decision not to back ``Crimes of
Passion II'' did not appear related to ratings, since an earlier
episode of the show aired last October and did well.
   The first ``Crimes of Passion'' garnered a 13.2 rating and 23
share in the Wednesday time period now occupied by ``China Beach.''
By comparison, ``China Beach'' had a 12.2 rating and 21 share last
week. The rating is a percentage of the nation's 90.4 million
households with television. The share is a percentage of sets in
use.
   Advertisers pulled out of NBC's Geraldo Rivera special on devil
worship earlier this season and others backed off from NBC's
satirical ``Saturday Night Live.'' A Michigan woman's campaign
against Fox's raunchy ``Married ... With Children'' received
publicity earlier this year. Fox says the relatively high-rated
show remains sold out nonetheless.
   An ABC press release for ``Crimes of Passion II,'' whose host is
Bruce Dern, said it ``explores real-life cases in which people have
committed an act of violence aimed against someone they love.''
   It's replacements, ``Livin' Large'' and ``Heart and Soul,'' were
among the lowest-rated shows of the week.

   Police searched Tuesday for a 6-week-old girl
whose parents said was abducted under circumstances almost
identical to the disappearance of their other daughter three years
ago, officials said.
   About 20 local, state and federal law enforcement officers aided
by tracking dogs have been looking for Heather Sims since Sunday,
police Sgt. Rick McCain told a news conference.
   Parents Robert Sims, 37, and Paula Sims, 30, said the baby was
abducted Saturday night in almost exactly the same way their
13-day-old daughter, Loralei, was taken three years ago. Loralei's
body was found later.
   Mrs. Sims said a gunman approached her outside their home around
10:30 p.m. Saturday while her husband was at work at a steel plant.
She told police she was forced back into the house and knocked out.
   An hour later, she told authorities, her husband returned home,
revived her and discovered the baby missing.
   In June 1986, Mrs. Sims told police a masked gunman broke into
their home around 10:20 p.m. while her husband was at work and took
Loralei.
   The baby's body was found five days later, about 150 feet from
the couple's home in Brighton, which is about 10 miles north of
this town of 40,000 people across the Mississippi River from St.
Louis. No cause of death was determined and no arrests were made in
that case, although authorities said the parents were suspects.
   The two failed a lie detector test of their account of Loralei's
disappearance, said Jersey County Sheriff Frank Yocom. They claimed
Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination and didn't
testify before a county grand jury that investigated the death, he
said.
   Investigators said Tuesday they had no evidence to doubt the
couple's claim in Heather's disappearance. ``There's nothing to
indicate that the Sims are anything but victims at this time,''
McCain said.
   Investigators have found little evidence and have few leads, he
said.
   ``We haven't given up hope of finding the baby alive,'' the
sergeant added.
   A hospital found no evidence Mrs. Sims was injured Saturday
night, he said.
   The couple's 15-month-old son, who was sleeping at home at the
time, was not disturbed, officials said. No valuables were taken
and no ransom note was left.

   Utah scientists who captured worldwide
attention with their claim to have achieved cold nuclear fusion
were probably fooled by faulty calculations, researchers from two
of the nation's most prominent science institutes say.
   Researchers from both the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and the California Institute of Technology are challenging the cold
fusion claim made at the University of Utah.
   Nathan Lewis said Monday that he and other Caltech researchers
conducted the most precise effort yet to duplicate the Utah
experiment and found that no fusion took place. He said the Utah
scientists calculated a gain in heat, but that precise measurements
at Caltech showed no such gain.
   Papers prepared by MIT researchers for presentation today at the
American Physical Society meeting also reported that verification
experiments conducted over a five-week period failed to detect any
fusion reaction.

   Foreign observers and diplomats agreed that there were

   The AIDS crisis is giving a boost to sex
education but is also crowding other critical sexual topics out of
the curriculum, concluded a nationwide survey released today.
   Forty states either support or require sex education, said the
study conducted by the Alan Guttmacher Institute. But it concluded
that the current ``crisis orientation'' spawned by concern over
AIDS has led educators to stress ``the negative outcomes of sex''
while often neglecting other important issues such as pregnancy
prevention.
   Thus while birth control is dealt with by most school districts,
it is usually from the standpoint of disease rather than pregnancy
prevention, according to the report.
   ``Support for sex education is strong. Not only does a large
majority of the American public support it, but so do most state
education agencies and large school districts,'' said the study,
``Risk and Responsibility: Teaching Sex Education in America's
Schools Today.''

   Exxon wants to burn or bury the sludge
recovered in cleaning up the nation's worst oil spill, and says
environmental laws may have to be bypassed to allow the disposal.
   Only hours before a deadline expired, the giant oil company
submitted its cleanup and disposal strategy Monday to the Coast
Guard and state officials.
   The plan also was unveiled as Exxon faced protests in at least
three states. Consumer groups in Alaska and New York state asked
for boycotts of Exxon products today. In Oregon, demonstrations
were planned at the port of Portland, where the crippled tanker
Exxon Valdez is to be repaired.
   Exxon's proposal immediately drew the scrutiny of Alaskan
environmental officials, who contend that Exxon failed to act
quickly to clean up the more than 10 million gallons of oil spilled
when the tanker hit a reef March 24 in Prince William Sound.

<HEAD>Southern California Traffic Pushing Many to the Braking Point</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE V. BIGELOW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Life in the fast lane is screeching to a halt
as too many cars jam too little concrete in America's motor mecca.
Angelenos still love their cars, but using them is pushing many to
the braking point.
   Traffic planning took a wrong turn somewhere along the road.
Drivers spend more time reading bumper stickers than getting where
they want to go. Even a flat tire or passing shower can turn a
commute into an hours-long ordeal.
   And the one-time showcase of top-down freeway living now faces
the nation's worst traffic conditions and related ozone pollution.
   ``It is as bad as it seems,'' said Dave Roper of the California
Transportation Department. ``Congestion is growing at 15 percent a
year.''
   With Southern California's population expanding 3 percent a year
and vehicle mileage jumping 4 percent, gridlock is changing the way
people live.
   ``The freeways have been operating reasonably well in a lot of
areas, but close to full,'' Roper said. ``Now, additional travel is
taking it over `full' and the break point has occurred.''
   Although segments of Metro Rail and two regional light rail
transit projects are under construction, the city's status as the
largest metropolitan region in the country without a mass transit
system is assured for years.
   The three systems will have 46 miles of track by 1993. The most
optimistic estimates put daily ridership at 213,000 passengers by
the year 2000. In Los Angeles County today, there are 25 million
daily trips, 97 percent in cars and the rest in buses. That's in a
county with 8.6 million residents, 6.5 million registered vehicles
and 504 miles of freeway.
   ``I don't know what's going to help L.A. congestion at this
point, but it can't hurt,'' said Cindy Marion, an executive in a
law firm who faces a 40-mile one-way commute and a $130-a-month
parking bill. ``If it came to my neighborhood, I'd take it,'' she
said of the planned subway.
   Some experts argue that the billions going to the high-tech
subway would be better spent on buses, carpools and other traffic
improvements.
   But even with rail transit in place, transportation planners
face limited options and dwindling funds as they try to negotiate
ideas through the region's hodgepodge of federal, state, regional
and municipal agencies.
   ``There isn't enough money, there isn't enough land and the
environmental constraints and financial constraints are such that
it's no longer possible to exclusively build our way out of the
problem,'' said Bob Remen, chief deputy director for the California
Transportation Commission.
   The commission has selected $7 billion in transportation
improvement projects statewide for the next five years, but Remen
said the primary funding source, the state gasoline tax, is being
eroded by inflation.
   Gov. George Deukmejian, an anti-tax crusader, tried to solve the
problem in June with a $1 billion bond measure for highway
improvements; voters rejected the idea. Deukmejian's fallback plan
was a series of ``transportation summits'' with business, labor,
government, transit advocates and others.
   On April 4, he called for a special election in November to let
voters decide on a detailed 10-year, $20 billion transportation
improvement plan that includes a 9-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax
hike.
   The governor, however, refused to firmly pledge his support for
the plan, and political analysts show little enthusiasm for a
costly special election, when voter turnout is usually low but
anti-tax sentiment usually high.
   Funding problems aside, transportation planners agree that
costly capital projects, such as double-decking freeways, are
financially prohibitive and politically impractical, if not
impossible.
   As a result, transportation officials are concentrating on
wringing more efficiency out of an overloaded system.
   ``What we've had to do in the city is focus our efforts on
traffic management options and also on demand,'' said S. Edwin
Rowe, general manager of the Los Angeles City Department of
Transportation.
   Remen said state officials are considering not just projects to
expand capacity, but techniques to improve freeway efficiency and
land-use management to encourage commuters to live closer to their
jobs. ``It's going to require everything,'' he said. ``It's going
to require all means available.''
   Hanging over the entire process is a threatened crackdown of the
federal Clean Air Act, which orders the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency and regional state agencies to meet federal air
quality standards.
   Drastic measures already have been enacted by the regional South
Coast Air Quality Management District, which has power to enforce
air quality standards, and more stringent steps are being taken.
   ``Under state legislation, we're authorized to mandate companies
to offer ride-sharing programs, and we've done that,'' said Tom
Eichhorn, a district spokesman. ``We can regulate truck traffic
during peak hours and we can require owners of fleet vehicles ...
to start buying vehicles that burn clean fuels.''
   Another regional agency, the Southern California Association of
Governments, has been working to improve air quality by studying
land use regulations and by developing a regional mobility plan.
   But the task is daunting, as reflected by the executive summary
of a draft of the Air Quality Management Plan released by SCAG in
September. The 20-year plan is estimated to cost $42 billion; a
heart-stopping aspect is that its goal is to restore the degree of
mobility motorists had in 1984.
   Meanwhile, drivers are coping with worsening traffic in a
variety of ways. On any given morning, motorists can be seen using
cellular phones, applying makeup, shaving, eating breakfast,
talking back to language tapes and flirting.
   In fact, there are several dating services specializing in
roadway romance, including Drive Me Wild of Simi Valley, which uses
bumper stickers to facilitate matchmaking.

<HEAD>Capital of Urban Sprawl Turns Slowly to Mass Transit</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Another Look: LA Jam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This symbol of urban sprawl and America's car
addiction, is at long last inking a few mass transit lines on its
tangled road map.
   They're ripping up the downtown streets to put in the first 4.4
miles of a subway, and trolly-like light rail lines are being built
between downtown and Long Beach, and across a patchwork of south
side neighborhoods.
   That's a dramatic departure from tradition for a city that
stands alone among major U.S. metropolises in having no rail
transit whatsoever.
   Here's a look at the projects under construction:
   _Metro Rail: A 4.4-mile, $1.2 billion, subway scheduled to open
in 1993 will start at Union Station in the northeast, pass under
the civic center and financial district and terminate near
MacArthur Park. A 13-mile extension into the San Fernando Valley
suburbs is tentatively scheduled to be done in 1998. It will be
financed 55 percent from the federal government, 17 percent from
the state, 14 percent from a sales tax surcharge, 11 percent from
merchant assessments and 3 percent from the city.
   _Long Beach-Los Angeles light rail: A $752 million, 21.5-mile
trolly style line mostly on existing tracks and powered by overhead
wires is meant for both commuters and as a local train for those in
largely low-income neighborhoods. It will be funded through sales
tax.
   _Norwalk-El Segundo light rail: A $400 million, 19.5-mile
east-west trolly will follow the Century Freeway, which is being
built at the same time. At the west end is Los Angeles
International Airport and aircraft factories. Funding comes from
the sales tax.

<HEAD>Atlantic Ocean is Star of New PBS Series</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To most of us, it's an innocuous strip of blue
that separates the United States and Europe on the world map, or
that tedious nothingness that takes hours to go by outside the
window of an airplane.
   But the Atlantic Ocean, a shifting, churning, life-giving,
living character, is the star of an ambitious new, three-part
series, ``Atlantic Realm,'' beginning tonight on PBS.
   The first episode, ``Island Arks,'' examines the origins of the
ocean, from its beginnings some 165 million years ago as little
more than a river separating two continents before they began to
drift apart.
   The series offers scientific and historical data on the
evolution of the ocean, but is thankfully taken up more with superb
photography of wildlife the ocean has spawned than by maps and
charts. One of the highlights of the first episode is the birth of
a litter of lemon sharks in the shallows near the Bahamas, an event
never before photographed in the wild.
   Life above the sea is featured in the first episode, especially
the myriad sea birds that live on islands off the coast of Africa
where the delicate ebb and flow of the ecology is easily observed _
such as the environmental upheaval caused when mariners introduced
domesticated cats to one small island.
   The series is engrossing and lovely to watch, despite
occasionally overwrought narrative, such this sample from a segment
on Iceland: ``Solidified lava is one of the raw materials of the
Earth. Forged in fire, it's stern but ready to accept the life that
pioneers its surface. Below, the Atlantic marine organisms would
exploit this new territory, but here, laid bare to the winds of the
air, lichens, mosses and herbs have taken hold along this broad and
rolling swath of the salt that is part of the mid-Atlantic ridge.''
   Phew. Narrator Marty Robinson manages to read such passages with
aplomb if not a breath.
   The series, a joint production of WTTW in Chicago and the BBC,
was created by Rod Redfern, who wrote the book ``The Making of a
Continent'' on which a previous, six-part PBS television series was
based.
   ``I was looking for something to follow `The Making of a
Continent,''' said Redfern in a statement about ``Atlantic Realm,''
``and the obvious thing was the making of an ocean.'' Redfern's
book on the Atlantic is due out soon.
   Next week's episode, ``Ocean of Light,'' focuses on the effects
of the winds that brush the top of ocean and the life forms that
live near the surface, including whales. The cameras go the
Antarctic for first-time pictures of the underwater ballet of
Weddell seals. Later, they capture the flow of translucent animals
that drift along the surface of the open ocean.
   ``Into the Abyss'' is the series' big finish, with cameras
diving a half-mile below the ocean's surface to examine the strange
creatures that dwell in the lightless depths. The cameras also take
viewers to the longest submerged mountain range on Earth and take a
peek inside an underwater volcano.

   Elsewhere in television:
   FOR THE BIRDS _ The life of wildlife illustrator John James
Audubon will be the subject of two two-hour television films, ``The
Flight of Imagination,'' in development by Herb Schmertz in New
York and Richard Price in London. The scripts will be based on
Claude Chebel's fictionalized biography ``Audubon.'' ...
   `MOLLY' GAINS GAYNES _ Allyn Ann McLerie, who plays Molly Dodd's
mother on Lifetime's ``The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd,'' has a
love interest in the series' new episodes on the cable channel.
He's played by McLerie's real-life husband, George Gaynes
(``Tootsie,'' ``Police Academy''). ...
   `WISEGUY' _ Patti D'Arbanville, who had been guest-starring in
the rock 'n' roll storyline on CBS' ``Wiseguy,'' will play a
recurring character in the crime drama, says CBS, noting, ``how and
why this happens remains a mystery: `Wiseguy' writers hold the
key.'' ... Speaking of ``Wiseguy,'' Viewers for Quality Television,
a Virginia-based group that defends high-caliber if low-rated
television series, has put its seal of approval on the series. VQT
director Dorothy Swanson calls ``Wiseguy'' ``brilliant and
cerebral.'' ...
   WHO'S HOUSE IS HOMIEST? _ Hope and Michael's Philly fixer-upper
on ABC's ``thirtysomething'' is the coziest of TV houses, according
to a survey of New York designers and architects queried by
Metropolis magazine. Next on the list was Cliff and Clair
Huxtable's Brooklyn townhouse on NBC's ``The Cosby Show.'' The Rube
Goldberg-style ``Pee-Wee's Playhouse'' on CBS was not far behind _
but then what decorator could resist a talking armchair?

<HEAD>The Ideologies of Conflict</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economic ideologies, with their code words and
slogans, may persist in the abstract long after they have been
questioned and sometimes even abandoned in practice.
   It happens in every system, but nowhere more dramatically at the
moment than in Eastern Europe, where the centrally planned
economies of the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary have been
flirting with private enterprise.
   In the Soviet Union, a fifth of the nation's 50,000 farms have
begun leasing land and equipment to individuals and families.
Poland has authorized 23,000 private co-ops. In Hungary, the
Budapest stock market has been reopened.
   Less abrupt changes are under way in Bulgaria. And in the Soviet
republics of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, where national identity
has remained vitally alive, there has been pressure for the
legalization of private property.
   Privatization is a worldwide trend, says the Reason Foundation,
which exists to promote private enterprise. In 1988, it says,
governments shifted $43 billion of functions and responsibilities
to the private sector.
   When that happens in the United States, which sold Conrail for
$1.6 billion in 1987, or in Britain, where the British Airport
Authority was privatized, it isn't startling news, because such
things have been proposed for years.
   Eastern Europe, where governments scorned private enterprise
since World War II, is another matter. Seeking to raise production
through individual initiative, some startling changes have
occurred. These are excerpts from Reason's 1988 report.
   _Soviet Union.
   In a reversal after 50 years of collectivized agriculture, the
Soviet Union began allowing individual farmers and groups of
farmers to rent land from the state in a move that essentially
marks a return to family farming.
   Legislation was enacted allowing farmers to buy tractors, trucks
and other so-called means of production that formerly could be
acquired only through state enterprises. Farmers were permitted to
hire workers as long as they met wage levels in state enterprises.
   The government also authorized the sale of state-owned homes to
tenants. Apartments can be sold on receipt of 50 percent of the
unit's value, with the remainder to be paid over 10 years.
   _Poland.
   Commencing in 1988, some 23,000 private cooperatives were given
permission to operate, though only half had become operative by the
end of the year. They include restaurants, butcher shops, shoe
repair shops and plumbing services.
   In another broadening of reforms, Polish enterprises can employ
up to 50 workers per shift. Formerly, private enterprises had been
limited to only 10 workers per shift.
   Poland also is removing import duties on some Western goods and
will allow foreign investors to own 100 percent of some Polish
enterprises. There's a downside: A graduated income tax takes 90
percent on upper incomes.
   _Hungary.
   In addition to the opening of the Budapest stock market in 1988,
private stock ownership is now possible. Previously, only state
banks and cooperatives could purchase shares in the 40 state-owned
companies that have issued stock.
   Private individuals also may form limited companies. These
companies can employ as many as 500 workers. Just last year, more
than 100 joint ventures were set up with foreigners.
   Such changes in Eastern Europe might be phases or experiments,
but the motivation for them contains an ideological message.
Underlying all of them is the belief that if unleashed, individual
initiative produces wondrous things.

   Suppose they gave the Tony Awards and nobody won?
   After the worst season for Broadway musicals in years, the 1989
Tony nominations will be announced Monday and the possible
contenders for top musical honors include only six shows. They are
``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,'' ``Black and Blue,'' ``Chu Chem'' and
``Starmites,'' as well as such already-closed flops as ``Legs
Diamond,'' ``Carrie'' and ``Welcome to the Club.''
   ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' would seem to be a shoo-in for a
best musical nomination as well as the leading contending for the
top prize, which carries a lot of clout at the box office.
   The Robbins musical, a collection of numbers from such shows as
``West Side Story,'' ``Gypsy,'' ``Fiddler on the Roof'' and other
hits, may not need the boost as much as the other musicals still
running. It's already doing near capacity business and has a
healthy advance.
   ``Chu Chem,'' billed as the first Chinese-Jewish musical, has
been limping along at the box office, despite an extensive
television ad campaign by its producer and composer Mitch Leigh.
``Black and Blue,'' a celebration of blues singing and tap dancing,
has done better business, although it has not approached the
sell-out status of the Robbins show.
   ``Starmites'' is another iffy proposition. The space-age,
comic-strip musical was panned by most major critics, except for a
favorable review in The New York Times.
   The picture is brighter for the best play category which has
several respectable candidates for nominations. The heavy favorite
is Wendy Wasserstein's ``The Heidi Chronicles,'' which already has
captured the Pulitzer Prize as well as the Outer Critics Circle
Award.
   Other likely candidates include ``Shirley Valentine,'' Willy
Russell's one-woman play starring Pauline Collins; ``Lend Me a
Tenor,'' a farce by Ken Ludwig; ``Ghetto,'' by Joshua Sobel; and
two plays that have already closed, ``Eastern Standard,'' by
Richard Greenberg, and Michael Weller's ``Spoils of War.''
   Bill Irwin's ``Largely New York,'' a comedy with no dialogue,
might also be a possibility for best play, although the Tony
administration committee has not yet ruled if it will be eligible.
   There will be also be an absence of big names in the acting
category categories. Only one possibility, Mikhail Baryshnikov, who
plays Kafka's tormented clerk in ``Metamorphosis,'' has superstar
status. Best acting nominations could go to Philip Bosco and Victor
Garber of ``Lend Me a Tenor,'' Bill Irwin in ``Largely New York''
and Peter Friedman of ``The Heidi Chronicles.'' And if they want a
name recognized by television audiences, the committee could
nominate Ed Asner of ``Born Yesterday.''
   The competition for best actress may be the most lively. Likely
candidates include Pauline Collins of ``Shirley Valentine''; last
year's winner Joan Allen for ``The Heidi Chronicles''; Kate
Nelligan for the already-shuttered ``Spoils of War''; and Madeline
Kahn who plays Billie Dawn in the revival of ``Born Yesterday.''
   The situation gets more desperate when you consider other
musical categories. After Jason Alexander, the genial emcee of
``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,'' and Peter Allen's critically panned
portrayal of the title character in ``Legs Diamond,'' there were no
real star roles for men on Broadway this season.
   For best actress in a musical, the nominating committee could
reach back to Betty Buckley as the demented mother in long-gone
``Carrie,'' Marilyn Sokol, the angry wife in ``Welcome to the
Club'' or the trio of ladies _ Ruth Brown, Linda Hopkins and Carrie
Smith _ who star in ``Black and Blue.''
   To save embarrassment, several musical categories might be
eliminated. During the 1984-85 season _ the year that brought
theatergoers such shows as ``Grind,'' ``Leader of the Pack'' and
``Quilters,'' there were no nominations for best actor and actress
in a musical as well as for choreography.
   The awards show will be broadcast Sunday June 4 on CBS-TV with
Angela Lansbury serving as host for the third straight year.

<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The musically chic Irish, basking in the
glory of the Grammy-winning U2 rock band, are exporting an eclectic
mix of talent typified by the distinctive styles of three female
singers.
   From the high-tech lyricism of Enya to the seductive quasi-jazz
of Mary Coughlan and the punk-edged punch of Sinead O'Connor, Irish
music has gone far beyond fiddles, folksiness and lilting brogues.
   ``I don't think it's anything to be feeling guilty about that
we're not all carrying green leprechauns on our backs when we go on
the road,'' said Coughlan, who sings about adultery, religious
tyranny and urban chaos.
   The propulsion of Dublin's U2 by the 1985 Live Aid music
extravaganza to the top of the rock music heap helped open the door
for other Irish favorites seeking world stardom.
   ``This used to be a culture of begrudgers _ successful people
always had to leave because they couldn't live with the smallness,
the conservatism. That has changed, changed forever,'' says Eamon
Dunphy, author of ``Unforgettable Fire: The Story of U2.''
   Disc jockey Paul McKenna of London's Capitol Radio says Irish
pop music's appeal is its originality and thoughtfulness.
   It is a ``backlash against designer pop,'' he said in an
interview. ``Radio listeners hear that and say, `Wow! that's the
way music is meant to sound.' It's predominantly music that is
fresh, more natural, less image-conscious.''
   U2's triumph has fueled a multimillion-dollar domestic music
industry which enables those Irish who succeed on the world stage
to keep roots at home, recording in dozens of newly built music
studios.
   Despite a Time magazine cover, and inspiring millions of
youngsters with their highly contemporary songs about drug abuse
and racism, the four-man group remains based in the Irish capital.
So do pop balladeer Chris de Burgh, the Van Morrison-style
mysticism of Hothouse Flowers and emerging rock bands such as Aslam
and Something Happens.
   Windmill Lane, Dublin's leading music studio, handles the home
stars plus such major overseas talents as Def Leppard, Status Quo,
Elvis Costello, Steve Winwood and Terence Trent D'Arby.
   Irish artists used to have to beat down agents' doors in London
and New York. Now a concert at the Baggot Inn, Dublin's grimy,
atmospheric music mecca, may attract half a dozen British and U.S.
talent scouts.
   The spotlight on Ireland also has brought Irish traditional
music to a wider record-buying audience, but often fused with rock,
jazz and other influences by artists as varied as Paul Brady, Enya,
The Pogues and Davy Spillane.
   Spillane mixes the rhythms of Celtic reels, rock and bluegrass
using uillean bagpipes and boghran drums with saxophone and
electric rhythm sections. The London-Irish Pogues combine
traditional acoustics with post-punk irreverence.
   Enya draws on traditional and classical styles in her album
``Watermark,'' an electronic soundscape that has sold more than 2
million copies worldwide. One track, ``Orinoco Flow,'' topped the
British pop singles chart in November.
   Her crystalline voice is often layered, as many as 100 times,
with harmonies and counterpoint melodies and wrapped in synthesizer
swathes of instrumentals varying from clarinet and tin whistle to
Burundi drums.
   Enya, 27, short for Eithne Ni Bhraonain, started out with
Clannad, a folk-rock family band famous for its electrifying theme
music for an adult TV version of ``Robin Hood.''
   She works from a backyard studio in the Dublin suburb of Artane
with sound recordist Nicky Ryan and his wife, Roma, who writes
lyrics sung in English, Gaelic and Latin. She shrugs off
descriptions of her music as ``Celtic New Age,'' ``transcendental''
or ``commercialized Irish mysticism.''
   ``There isn't a category for it,'' Enya said in an interview.
``For me personally, it's got every title that's possible.''
   Sinead O'Connor, 22, who also defies pigeonholing, has won
plaudits for her self-produced debut album, ``The Lion and the
Cobra,'' a largely autobiographical exploration of adolescence. Her
trademarks are a shaved head and a harrowing, defiant voice that
expresses emotions in tonal leaps and swerves.
   Coughlan, 32, who sings soul with a Galway accent, has built a
solid reputation across northern Europe through three albums and
frequent touring.
   ``The likes of U2 and Sinead and myself work hard to build up a
live following first,'' she said from her new base of Howth, a
fishing village overlooking Dublin Bay. ``I don't think any of
those bands that are successful in the charts have ever gigged in
their life. It's purely magazines, videos and disco.
   ``There's always been pop music around, but I don't think it's
ever been as bad. Anything that's good that's been in the charts in
the past five years has been rereleased oldies.''
   Coughlan sings about ``prostitution, junkies, alcohol abuse,
relationships _they're all political in their own way.'' In ``My
Land Is Too Green,'' she pokes fun at the dominance of the Roman
Catholic Church in a state that outlaws divorce and ``exports its
problems for foreign solutions'' _ a reference to Irish women who
have to go to England to have abortions.
   The Northern Ireland conflict still provides fodder for
songwriters, but the anti-British republican ballad tradition
carried on by Christy Moore is now contrasted with tragic,
non-sectarian interpretations.
   The Pogues, championing the innocence of 10 Irish people jailed
for Irish Republican Army bombings in Britain, wrote of ``being
Irish in the wrong place at the wrong time.'' The song was banned
last year by some British radio stations which feared it might be
interpreted as giving comfort to the IRA.
   In ``Sunday Bloody Sunday,'' U2's lead singer Bono laments:
``The trenches dug within our hearts _ And mothers, children,
brothers, sisters torn apart.''
   ``Up here we sacrifice our children _ To feed the worn-out
dreams of yesterday,'' echoes Northern Ireland-born Paul Brady in
his folk-soft rock album ``Back to the Center.''
   ``Ireland is able to hold its head up now as much as anywhere
else,'' said Dave Fanning, Ireland's foremost rock deejay.
   ``U2 deserve full praise because they opened the door,'' he
said. ``They put Ireland on the map. The success, the
staying-at-home, the doing-it-here helps other people to realize we
can do it as well.''

   Before agreeing to star in ``Say Anything,''
John Cusack insisted on a few changes.
   First of all, the script.
   ``The essence was there, but it needed to be fleshed out,'' said
the 22-year-old actor, who portrays Lloyd Dobler, a down-to-earth
high school senior in love with the class valedictorian (Ione Skye).
   ``I saw things inherent in the structure but I said, `If you
want me to do the film, I'm going have to do this, this and this.
I'm not going to do this, this and this.'
   ``He (writer-director Cameron Crowe) said, `Great, bring it on.'
I was very flattered and grateful they trusted me enough.''
   Then came the wardrobe.
   ``I'm at the point where I costume myself. I went in and met
with the costume designer, who to me is someone who tries to find
out what I'm going for and helps me along that way. This costume
designer had a whole rack full of clothes. There were V-neck
sweaters and corduroy pants.
   ``I said, `I will never wear anything on this rack, anything
like this rack. Go get me a `Clash' T-shirt. Go get met me a
trenchcoat. Get me hats, different high-top sneakers.'''
   Finally, there was the matter of Crowe, who has written
extensively about rock music and authored the best-selling account
of teen-age life, ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High,'' later made into
a feature film. Cusack hesitated to work with a first-time director
but was impressed by Crowe's enthusiasm.
   ``He was really persistent. He flew out to Chicago and handed me
a copy of `Catcher in the Rye.' He said, `You're 21 years old,
you're never going to be able to play a younger guy again. Why not
end it with a positive note.''
   Cusack, who has also starred in ``The Sure Thing,'' ``Eight Men
Out'' and ``Tapeheads,'' was determined to make Lloyd believeable,
wanting to avoid another angry young man such as Sean Penn, or the
``so hip and so cute'' teen-agers portrayed by Michael J. Fox and
Kirk Cameron.
   ``Here's a guy who knows what's going on in the world, who's
emotionally political,'' Cusack said of his character.
   ``He's a pretty smart guy who just doesn't have the skills to
express himself. He doesn't buy into the hype. He doesn't believe
the hype. He's not negative. He's not going to be a negative force
in the world. He can't live his life in a negative way.
   ``We (Cusack and Crowe) had a great rapport about what was right
for Lloyd. By the end of the film, he would start a sentence and I
would finish it.''
   Cusack, the brother of actress Joan Cusack (``Working Girl,''
``Broadcast News'') and son of documentary filmamker Richard
Cusack, grew up in Chicago and was just 9 when he began taking
classes at the Piven Theatre Workshop in Evanston, Ill. He had
minor roles in the movies ``Sixteen Candles'' and ``Class'' before
being cast by director Rob Reiner for the lead in ``The Sure
Thing.''
   ``I was amped, just ready to go. I wasn't smart enough to be
nervous. I was just excited to be working with Rob,'' recalled
Cusack, who would later work with Reiner on ``Stand by Me.''
   ``I just really dug his work process, it was real similar to
mine. Rob is this guy who directs by saying, `Match my passion.'
There was great energy on the set.''
   But Cusack went on to appear in a series of poorly received
films, including ``Better Off Dead'' and ``One Crazy Summer.'' He
became frustrated from reading an endless number of bad scripts,
and admitted that his career was ``in the pits.''
   ``I remember reading the script for, `Some Kind of Wonderful.'
They wanted me do that. At the end of the film the guy takes all
this college money to buy a jet, a Cadillac, a helicopter. He
completely woos this girl with material possessions and symbols of
wealth. What kind of story is that?''
   He was happier making films such as ``Tapeheads,'' a parody of
the music video business that starred Cusack and his friend, Tim
Robbins, as a pair of sleazy producers.
   ``We were so sick of these run-of-the mill scripts _ same
characters, same plots, not funny, not fresh. Somebody sent me this
script called `Tapeheads,' and we saw the name and said, `Let's do
it.'
   ``It sounded really sick,'' he said. ``It was a black comedy on
the music business and I got to finally play a guy who wasn't a
good guy, who would sell out his mother for the right price.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ When movie stars headed for the wide-open spaces
to film their Westerns, they often stayed at the El Rancho Hotel in
New Mexico. But just as the Westerns faded in popularity, so did
the old hotel. Now it's trying for a comeback, counting on
nostalgia for the golden age of Hollywood and a cowboy motif.

   It's a roster of the stars of yesteryear,
with names like Errol Flynn, Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne, Maria
Montez, Tom Mix, Virginia Mayo, Ronald Reagan, Lucille Ball.
   The names adorn the doors of guest rooms throughout the El
Rancho Hotel, which owes its birth to Hollywood.
   The hotel was built in 1937 by the brother of movie magnate D.W.
Griffith to house the actors and actresses who were then flocking
to the wide-open spaces and red bluffs of northwestern New Mexico
to make movies, mostly Westerns.
   On famed Route 66, the hotel played host to the famous, the
near-famous and the once-famous for decades. But as Westerns faded,
so did El Rancho.
   It went through a series of owners, finally ending up on the
auction block in a bankruptcy foreclosure 50 years after its grand
opening.
   Gallup businessman Armand Ortega bought the one-time showplace
for $500,000 and spent about another $500,000 restoring it, says
his daughter, Amelia Ortega Crowther, manager-bookkeeper for El
Rancho.
   The hotel _ which looks a bit like an oversized ranch house _
reopened in May 1988, its original motto of ``Charm of Yesterday,
Convenience of Tomorrow'' intact in neon above the entrance.
   The hotel's huge, brick-floored, two-story lobby was restored to
its Western flavor, a lariat surrounding the mirror behind the
check-in counter, silver dollars embedded in the counter itself.
   The lobby's centerpiece is a huge arched rock and brick
fireplace into which the original mason cut a cardplayer's diamond,
club, spade and heart _ appropriate since there once was open
gambling at the big hotel.
   Near the lobby, on a wooden bench and a chair made of steer
horns, sit wooden Indians. The lobby walls and railings are
festooned with big game trophies, Navajo rugs and Indian and
Western art.
   A rustic, curving double staircase, the carpeted steps made of
logs sawed in half, flows gracefully up either side of the
fireplace to a wide balcony that encircles the main room.
   The walls of the balcony are lined with black-and-white
photographs. There are scenes from movies filmed in the area such
as ``Texas Ranger,'' starring Fred MacMurray, Jean Parker and Lloyd
Nolan; ``Ambush,'' with Robert Taylor; ``The Streets of Laredo,''
starring William Holden and William Bendix; ``Rocky Mountain,''
with Errol Flynn; ``Colorado Territory,'' with Joel McCrea;
``Pursued,'' starring Robert Mitchum.
   There are photographs _ dozens of them _ of stars such as the
Marx Brothers, Alan Ladd, Humphrey Bogart, Katharine Hepburn, Kirk
Douglas, Lew Ayres, John Russell of the television show ``The
Lawman,'' Robert Taylor and the Fondas, Henry and Jane, across the
balcony from each other.
   Some photographs are autographed, often to Martin Hanks, the
hotel's first manager.
   At one end of the balcony is a picture of Clair Gurley. A
salesman, he was the first person to stay at El Rancho when it
opened in 1937. Ms. Crowther says that when Ortega reopened the
hotel in 1988, he invited Gurley back _ and charged him the
original $5-a-night price.
   Today's rates range from $32 to $49.
   The three-story hotel, still serviced by its original
hand-cranked elevator, has 70 rooms. Each room is labeled with the
name of a star who, research shows, probably stayed in that very
room, Ms. Crowther says.
   However, there's at least one exception.
   Ronald Reagan stayed at El Rancho a couple of times while making
a movie and filming ``Death Valley Days'' for television, but Ms.
Crowther says today's Ronald Reagan room is one that probably isn't
labeled accurately.
   El Rancho originally had a hierarchy of rooms, the best ones in
an area by themselves. One of the best is now the Reagan room, but
that probably has more to do with him being president than being a
star.
   ``I'd guess Ronald Reagan never stayed in the Ronald Reagan room
because he wasn't an `A' star,'' Ms. Crowther says. ``He was a
B-movie star.''
   The hotel keeps jelly beans, Reagan's favorite snack, in the
room. And if someone orders the Ronald Reagan sandwich from the
dining room, that, too, comes with jelly beans.
   There are rooms with the names of Jimmy Stewart, Robert Taylor,
Groucho Marx, W.C. Fields, Doris Day, Jack Benny.
   Ortega, Ms. Crowther says, once joked about ordering a pay phone
for the Jack Benny room, in keeping with the running gag about the
star's stinginess.
   Ms. Crowther says guests often ask for a room named for a
particular star.
   The choices also include the names of Lee Marvin, Lee Remick,
Claude Akins, Betty Grable, Rosalind Russell, Burt Lancaster,
Elizabeth Scott, William Holden, Irene Manning.
   Ms. Crowther admits she doesn't know who all the stars are _
Irene Manning, for instance.
   The rooms have been refurbished to close-to-original state, Ms.
Crowther says. One of El Rancho's previous owners had paneled them,
but Ortega had the paneling ripped out and the walls replastered
white.
   He also had the rooms furnished with rustic-looking furniture,
such as beds with wagon-wheel headboards.
   Several rooms have the original furniture, the light oak oiled
after being rescued from under a thick coating of chocolate brown
paint.
   All the rooms have ceiling fans, since air-conditioning was not
put in when the hotel was originally built half a century ago.
   It does have air-conditioning now, so guests no longer must go
out onto the roof to get a breath of cool air as they did in the
old days.
   Among the photographs displayed on the second-floor balcony is
one showing Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, stars of ``The Sea
of Grass,'' sitting on El Rancho's roof with the movie's director,
who is not identified.
   The guest rooms now have tiny bathrooms, added in an early
renovation. Except for rooms for big stars, the original hotel did
not have bathrooms in each room, but rather had ``baths down the
hall,'' Ms. Crowther says.
   Since its reopening, El Rancho mostly has played host to
ordinary folk. But there have been a couple of stars.
   Michael Gross of television's ``Family Ties'' ate at the hotel's
dining room one day. And Goldie Hawn stayed at El Rancho last
summer on her way from Santa Fe to California.
   ``She was very nice,'' Ms. Crowther says. ``She stood in front
of the fireplace and let people take pictures, and signed
autographs.''

<HEAD>If Feds Allow, Baby Bell Will Edge Into Cable TV</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a move that may test the limits of federal
regulation of the telephone industry, Pacific Telesis Group hopes
to become the first of the old Bell System companies to buy into
cable TV.
   The nation's cable system operators vow to fight Pacific's
plans, fearing that the phone companies' far greater financial
resources will muscle aside competition and concerned that
telephone companies may, if allowed by the federal government to
buy in, be able within a few years to provide phone and television
service through a single cable.
   The initial battleground is Chicago. Pacific announced last
month it intends to buy an interest _ worth more than $100 million
_ in a system serving 97,000 homes in the Windy City.
   Before that can happen, though, Pacific must win approval from
the Federal Communications Commission and from the federal judge
who oversees operations of the seven regional telephone companies
that were created with the breakup of the Bell System in 1984.
   The seven ``Baby Bells'' have been barred by U.S. Districe Judge
Harold Greene from generating information services, including cable
TV programming, out of fear they could use their vast financial
resources to compete unfairly.
   But the regional companies, including Pacific, are allowed to
enter the cable television business outside their telephone service
areas if they can show they will not use their monopoly powers to
impede competition in the cable market they enter.
   Pacific announced April 20 it had reached a tentative agreement
to buy, through a series of transactions, a 68 percent interest in
the Chicago system. Now owned by Group W, the system would be
purchased for $198 million by an affiliate of Prime Cable of
Austin, Texas. Prime would operate the system, which serves 97,000
customers in a franchise area of 410,000 homes.
   One telecommunications industry analyst, Berge Ayvazian of
Boston's Yankee Group, said the Chicago deal had been ``very
carefully structured ... to test the limits'' of Greene's
restrictions on the Baby Bells' operatons.
   ``This is a breakthrough for them if they get away with it,'' he
added.
   The Justice Department has already approved Pacific's plans. The
company intends to ask Greene for a waiver this summer.
   The Bell companies, particularly Pacific, have been pecking away
at the fringes of the cable business while hoping that someday they
will be free to compete fully in cable TV.
   Pacific must persuade Greene that a waiver would not impede the
operations and profit potential of other Chicago cable systems.
   ``They stand a pretty good chance of getting the waiver,'' said
Henry Geller, a former Federal Communications Commission official
and director of Duke University's Center for Public Policy
Research. ``They're clearly going to argue ... they don't have a
monopoly in Chicago.''
   An association representing cable operators will argue before
Greene that granting Pacific a waiver would substantially undercut
his 1984 decree.
   ``We support the consent decree, which is premised on
justifiable fears of telephone companies using their huge monopoly
phone business to cross-subsidize (cable operations) and otherwise
impede competiton,'' said James Mooney, president of the National
Cable Television Association, an industry trade group.
   ``One of the (Baby Bells) has a gross revenue base that is as
large as the entire cable television industry,'' said Stephen
Effros, president of the Community Antenna Television Association,
another cable operators' trade group.
   Besides concerns that the phone companies' very size could
radically alter their industry, cable operators fear that the
fiber-optic cables being installed by phone companies to replace
copper wires could one day eliminate the need for a separate cable
to deliver television signals to customers.
   Telephone companies are replacing thousands of miles of wire
each year with fiber cables, those pencil-thin bundles of glass
strands capable of transmitting enormous amounts of information on
beams of laser light.
   If extended directly to customers' homes, a single fiber-optic
cable could at the same time carry television signals, telephone
calls and computer data.
   Southwestern Bell and Sammons Cable are testing new cable
technology in the Fort Worth, Texas, area, and the FCC last week
allowed a non-Bell company, General Telephone of California, to
construct a system using both conventional coaxial cable, made of
copper, and fiber-optic cable in Cerritos, Calif., a Los Angeles
suburb that also gets its phone service from the GTE subsidiary.
   Cable industry critics say that it will cost telephone companies
$500 billion to completely convert to fiber optics and that selling
TV programming would be a fine way to make up the expense.
   Raymond W. Smith of Bell Atlantic, another of the Baby Bells,
told broadcasters last week in Las Vegas that only by allowing
telephone companies to provide video programming will a full fiber
optic network _ with the cables extending to individual homes _ be
completed in this century.
   ``In my view, only one factor could accelerate this timetable
dramatically _ allowing telephone companies to cover the costs of
fiber-to-the-home with revenues'' from a range of services,
including television transmission.
   Many in Congress and at the FCC think it is time to unleash the
telephone companies to compete in the information service and
telecommunications equipment-manufacturing businesses.
   Members of Congress concerned about such things, such as Reps.
John Dingell, D-Mich.; Al Swift, D-Wash., and Tom Tauke, R-Iowa,
want to relieve Greene of his oversight of the Bell companies. Last
month, they introduced legislation to lift those two restraints on
the Bell companies.
   While the bill would not let the Bell companies into cable TV,
there is a growing feeling that the existing cable TV industry
could stand a little competition.
   FCC Commissioner Patricia Diaz Dennis has said repeatedly that
the federal government should now establish rules to assure that
fiber-optic phone lines carry a ``cornucopia'' of voice, video and
data into the nation's homes.
   The FCC began relaxing its restrictions on phone companies'
entry into cable television last July, when it voted to consider
recommending to Congress that the companies be allowed into cable
TV even in the regions where they provide phone service.
   The commission also suggested it would try to encourge telephone
companies to enter cable TV if Congress fails to act by broadly
defining ``good cause'' for waivers from its existing regulations.
   The FCC said it probably would grant waivers if telephone
companies wire homes with fiber and allow competitors to use those
cables to sell video programs too.
   With this writing on the wall, many cable TV executives are
looking to involve telephone companies as partners in cable systems
outside telephone company service areas.
   ``There'a major split within the cable industry on that issue,''
Effros said. ``Frankly, I don't think many cable operators would
disagree that we could live with telephone companies'' outside
their service areas.
   ``Their money is as green as anyone else's and the amounts of
money needed to continually improve cable TV ... is massive, so it
would be nice to get a new influx of money,'' Effros said.

   The price of Ogilvy's stock skyrocketed more than $17 a share
Monday and surpassed WPP's proposed bid.
   Ogilvy announced Sunday that WPP Chief Executive Martin Sorrell
had proposed to pay $45 a share for the parent of the advertising

   Construction spending, hit by a sharp drop in
the highway category, suffered its third consecutive monthly
decline in March, the first time building activity has shown such
weakness since just before the last recession, the government said.
   The Commerce Department said Monday that spending on public and
private building projects declined by 0.3 percent in March,
following even larger declines of 0.8 percent in February and 0.7
percent in January.
   The February decline represented a sharp revision from the
original report a month ago.

   Despite President Bush's ``read my lips'' vow
against new taxes, his administration is considering higher
gasoline taxes for 1991 as part of a possible trade for concessions
such as a lower capital gains tax, officials said.
   Administration sources said Monday it is unlikely Bush can hold
his no-new-taxes stance for more than one year, given the
difficulty of reaching budget-deficit targets by adjusting only the
spending side of the ledger.
   The sources said planning was under way for a possible fiscal
1991 budget pact with Congress that would indeed include new taxes.

   In a filing submitted Monday to federal bankruptcy court in New
York, Eastern disclosed it had firm sales contracts or received
acceptable offers for about $1.1 billion of its assets.
   As the crippling strike against the carrier heads into its third
month, Eastern's unions say they remain solid, although some
employees _ both union and management _ are bailing out.

   If there is a smoking gun in Polaroid Corp.'s
giant patent infringement lawsuit against Eastman Kodak Co., it may
be a note that Kodak's former chairman jotted in the margin of an
internal memo.
   As the trial got under way in federal court in Boston Monday,
Polaroid's lawyers cited the two-word scribble as evidence that
Kodak deliberately violated seven Polaroid patents and should be
ordered to pay its rival nearly $12 billion for lost profits,
interest, and punitive damages.
   If U.S. District Judge A. David Mazzone awards Polaroid anything
near that amount, it will be the largest patent infringement
decision in history.

<HEAD>Pan Am Agrees to Sell Security Unit to Johnson Controls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Johnson Controls Inc. of Milwaukee has agreed to
buy the security and maintenance unit of Pan Am Corp., the
companies announced Monday.
   The sale price, in cash, won't be disclosed until the sale is
completed sometime during the second quarter, the companies said
Monday. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval.
   Pan Am, strapped by losses from Pan American World Airways, its
main subsidiary, put its Pan Am World Services Inc. unit up for
sale in January. The subsidiary, based in Cape Canaveral, Fla.,
markets security, maintenance and other services to government
agencies, the military and other airlines.
   World Services, with about 10,000 employees at over 100
locations worldwide, had revenue of $600 million in 1988. Financial
analysts estimate the unit's potential sale value at around $200
million.
   Johnson Controls provides operations services on a contract
basis to airports, sports arenas, schools, hospitals and other
facilities. The company, which had revenue of $3.1 billion in 1988,
also makes heating and cooling controls, automotive seating,
batteries and plastics.
   Pan Am's Northeast shuttle service and Pan Am Express, a
commuter airline, also are considered profitable operations. But
they are more closely tied to Pan Am's main airline business than
is the World Services unit.
   Some analysts hav wondered whether the World Services move
represents a new Pan Am strategy to sell performing assets rather
than strip away parts of loss-making World Airways, such as routes
and airport facilities.
   Pan Am officials say the sale of World Services is designed to
help finance the company's planned investments for the near future.
Those investments include $61 million for improvements at World
Airways' main terminal at Kennedy International Airport in New
York, $25 million for refurbishing aircraft interiors, $20 million
for improvements in information systems and other programs,
according to Pan Am.
   Rival Eastern Airlines announced plans Thursday to lease 14
Boeing 727-200s to Pan Am's World Airways for $96.6 million over
five years. The deal must be approved by federal bankruptcy court,
where strikebound Eastern filed for protection from creditors on
March 9.

<HEAD>Shearson Lehman Hutton Unit Agrees To Acquire Scherer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. unit
agreed to acquire gelatin capsule manufacturer R.P. Scherer Corp.
in an offer worth nearly $407 million, the companies announced.
   RPS Acquisition Corp., formed by Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings
and its Merchant Banking Partnerships, will commence a
$31.75-a-share tender offer for Scherer stock on Friday, Shearson
spokesman Steve Faigen said Monday.
   The tender offer would total $352 million and RPS would assume
debt totaling $54.9 million, for a $406.9 million total, Faigen
said.
   Scherer would become a privately held company, with interests
held by entities including Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings and its
Management Banking Partnerships, Faigen said.
   Scherer opened several purchase offers last Wednesday, then
began negotiations that led to the RPS transaction, Scherer
spokeswoman Jayne Colombo said. She didn't identify other bidders
or say how many there were but said the capsule maker didn't expect
further offers.
   Scherer stock closed Friday at $33.37{ a share. The company
asked the National Association of Securities Dealers not to permit
over-the-counter trading in its stock Monday because of the
impending announcement, Colombo said.
   Scherer decided in September to consider offers after a dispute
between former president Peter Fink, who opposed selling, and his
estranged wife Karla Scherer Fink, a board member and daughter of
the company founder.
   Karla Fink's pro-sale forces prevailed in a proxy fight and
Peter Fink left, forming another company, Quantum Corp. of St.
Clair Shores. Fink, who said he might try to buy Scherer, didn't
return a telephone call Monday.
   Scherer has about 4,400 employees in 22 facilities in 13
countries. It reported sales of $290.7 million in its fiscal year
ended March 31, 1988.

<HEAD>WPP Likely To Succeed In Ogilvy Bid, Analysts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Industry analysts expect Ogilvy Group Inc. to
fight a takeover from London-based WPP Group PLC, but ultimately
they expect WPP will succeed in creating an ad agency holding
company that will vie for the title of world's largest.
   Wall Street reacted enthsiastically Monday to the $730 million
WPP bid, disclosed Sunday, bidding up the price of Ogilvy's stock
more that $17 and surpassing WPP's bid.
   WPP Chief Executive Martin Sorrell has proposed to pay $45 a
share for the parent of the advertising agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather
Worldwide.
   Ogilvy's stock soared $17.12{ a share to close at $49.12{ Monday
in over-the-counter trading.
   If the deal goes through, it would be the biggest takeover of an
advertising holding firm ever, breaking the record set by WPP's
purchase of JWT Group Inc., parent of J. Walter Thompson Co., two
years ago.
   Ogilvy, meanwhile, says it wants to remain independent.
   ``Mr. Sorrell's proposal letter to Ogilvy appears primarily to
be a sales pitch which suffers from serious flaws in business
logic,'' Ogilvy Chairman Kenneth Roman said in a statement Sunday.
   Analysts said the British firm would likely win the fight.
   ``There's a real possibility that Sorrell will succeed,'' said
Fred Anschel, an advertising industry analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc., adding that many shareholders would find WPP's
all-cash offer hard to turn down.
   ``They have some (defenses),'' said John Dougherty, an analyst
with County NatWest USA. ``But I don't think they have enough to
resist a bid that I think ultimately will go into the mid-50s.''
   The deal would create an advertising and marketing holding
company that would rival Britain's Saatchi &amp; Saatchi PLC as the
world's largest.
   WPP had international billings last year of $7.8 billion,
ranking it third among the world's ad agency holding companies,
according to Advertising Age, a trade publication. Ogilvy, with
billings of $5.7 billion, placed fifth.
   Combined, their billings would have about equaled Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi's $13.5 billion.
   An industry source said WPP wants to become the best
multinational marketing service and not necessarly the biggest.
   But WPP may yet achieve that distinction. Ogilvy would be the
latest entry on a lengthy list of advertising and marketing firms
bought by WPP.
   In the two years since it picked up JWT, WPP has purchased
Einson Freeman, a sales promotion agency; Anspach Grossman Portugal
Inc., a corporate identity consultant; Reese Communications and
Target Systems, two U.S. companies specializing in public affairs
and direct mail marketing; Stewart McColl Associates PLC, a British
design firm; and Mendoza Dillon &amp; Associados Inc., an advertising
firm specializing in the Hispanic market.
   Earlier this year, WPP agreed to buy PARG Public Affairs
Resource Group of Toronto, one of Canada's largest public affairs
consulting and public opinion research firms.
   WPP's acquisitive strategy is much like Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's _
which comes as no surprise to industry watchers because Sorrell was
the architect of much of that firm's expansion, including the
purchase of Ted Bates Worldwide for a then-record $450 million in
1986.
   Analysts said WPP's latest proposal was more a result of
Sorrell's expansion plans rather than any problems at Ogilvy.
   Ogilvy ``seems to fit in pretty well with Martin Sorrell's
goals,'' said Vicki Weber, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
``This is not a company that was begging to be taken over.''
   Said Anschel, the Dean Witter analyst, ``The biggest knock
against them (Ogilvy) is their earings have been basically flat
since 1985.'' But, he said, ``It has a very fine brand-name in the
advertising business.''
   For Sorrell, expansion has not been without trouble: His
purchase of JWT, which included the advertising agency Lord Geller
Federico Einstein Inc., led top Lord Geller executives to defect
and start their own company. Thetwo sides are fighting in court.
   WPP's major clients include Ford Motor Co., Quaker Oats Co.,
Kellogg Co., Eastman Kodak Co., and the Kraft operations of Philip
Morris Cos. Inc.
   Ogilvy's major clients include American Express Co., Polaroid
Corp., Seagram Co. Ltd., the Shell oil company and Unilever, the
Anglo-Dutch consumer products company.
   Ogilvy earned $32.9 million last year on revenue of $838
million. WPP earned $38.1 million on revenues of $974.7 million.

<HEAD>Eastern Forging Ahead with Asset Sales, Filing Shows</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strikebound Eastern Airlines, downplaying
proposals from suitors interested in buying the entire carrier,
indicated it was speeding ahead with its plan to sell $1.8 billion
in assets separately.
   In a filing submitted Monday to federal bankruptcy court in New
York, Eastern disclosed it had firm sales contracts or received
acceptable offers for about $1.1 billion of its assets.
   Those assets include Eastern's Northeast shuttle service,
already slated to be sold to developer Donald Trump for $365
million, airport gates in Philadelphia and routes between that city
and others, said Eastern spokesman Robin Matell. He declined to
elaborate on the non-shuttle deals.
   Another $300 million in asset sales ``are subject to serious
discussion where reasonable offers have been received,'' while an
additional $400 million in sales are being discussed with
``responsible and interested parties,'' Eastern said in the filing.
   The Miami-based airline said it expects to announce several
deals in the coming weeks.
   All such sales must be approved by the federal bankruptcy court
overseeing the airline's Chapter 11 reorganization under protection
from creditors.
   Eastern's Machinists, pilots and flight attendants unions, which
have been off the job since March 4, have opposed sales of the
airline's assets. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland has
pushed to have the company sold in its entirety and has scheduled a
Wednesday hearing for arguments over why such an auction of the
whole airline _ including the shuttle _ should not take place.
   In its filing, Eastern said it recently received an offer from
billionaire hotel executive Jay Pritzker to buy all of the airline.
Eastern described the offer as ``at best, a generalized expression
of interest.''
   On Friday, a statement was issued on behalf of a group of
unidentified New York financial institutions that indicated the
consortium was developing a proposal under which it might pay $1
billion for Eastern if the deal included assets sold by the airline
since its 1986 acquisition by Texas Air Corp.
   An attorney for the group later said the statement was issued in
error but the group actually was formulating a proposal.
   Eastern, in its filing, countered that the group lacks ``the
financial resources to consummate any purchase and, indeed, has
only the vaguest hope of obtaining such resources.''
   Takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn, who owns Trans World Airlines
Inc., has expressed interest and was expected to submit a formal
bid in the near future.
   Eastern plans to restructure to operate at one-third its
pre-strike size and raise $1.8 billion to pay debts by selling
planes, airport gates and landing slots at unspecified locations.
   As a first step, the airline announced plans Thursday to lease
14 Boeing 727-200s to Pan American World Airways for $96.6 million
over five years.
   All transactions and any sale of the entire airline must be
approved by U.S. bankruptcy court, where Eastern filed for
protection from creditors on March 9. However, Texas Air can't be
compelled under the bankruptcy laws to sell Eastern in its entirety
if it does not want to.
   Eastern management has the exclusive right until early July to
present a reorganization plan for court approval.
   Eastern's Machinists union struck the carrier on March 4 after a
long wage dispute. They were joined by pilots and flight
attendants, virtually grounding the airline and forcing it to seek
bankruptcy protection five days later.
   Eastern said Monday its non-union employees have delivered
petitions with more than 6,200 signatures to the bankruptcy court
expressing their support for the plan to rebuild as a smaller
carrier.

   As a crippling strike at Eastern Airlines heads
into its third month, the carrier's unions say they remain solid,
although some employees _ union and management _ are bailing out.
   Karen Ceremsak, a company spokeswoman, can't estimate how many
of Eastern's 12,000 non-union employees have taken other jobs since
the March 4 strike by the company's Machinists, pilots and flight
attendants virtually grounded the airline.
   ``As more time passes, more people will go on to other things,''
she said.
   The Machinists union estimates that departures among Eastern's
17,000 union workers number only in the hundreds, although nearly
all of the remaining union employees still refuse to work for the
airline.
   Eastern has cut back to 10 percent of pre-strike operations, has
about 4,500 active employees and has entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization and protection from creditors.
   Parent Texas Air Corp. plans to rebuild Eastern as a smaller
airline without the unions. But the unions are optimistic that new
ownership for the entire airline still can be found, even though
Eastern insists that none of the offers it has received are viable.
   Wally Haber, general chairman of the Machinists union, chuckled
recently when reminded of his March 4 prediction that the strike
would last only 10 days. Eastern's March 9 bankruptcy filing
``threw a monkey wrench into the whole system,'' putting the
company into the slow-moving procedures of bankruptcy court, he
said.
   Haber, noting that few of the 8,500 Eastern machinists were
around for the last Eastern strike, for 42 days in 1966, said:
``I've been amazed at the resolve, the way the people are really
sticking together.''
   United Airlines, Boeing Corp. and several other companies have
been wooing Eastern mechanics, Haber said, but the union estimates
departures have been only in the hundreds. He said about one-third
of the union membership is working at some type of job, but most
are temporary or part time.
   Officials at the pilots union _ whose members would sacrifice
seniority that determines their salaries and flight assignments if
they switched airlines _ say there have been few departures. Flight
attendants union officials say many of their members have taken
other jobs but would prefer to return o Eastern if possible.
   Strikers have been aided somewhat by their own union benefits _
Machinists receive $100 a week in union strike benefits and the
pilots $2,400 a month _ and from elsewhere in organized labor. The
AFL-CIO has about $1 million for Eastern strikers, with the
financially-strapped flight attendants union set to receive
two-thirds of that amount.
   Thousands of dollars worth of groceries and frozen meats have
been donated to the unions, Haber said, and South Florida farmers
have invited crews of strikers to come to their fields for all the
vegetables they could pick.
   ``The economic situation is different now than it was 23 years
ago,'' Haber said. ``Over half of our people have two jobs in the
family.''
   Many non-union employees _ who have no strike benefits _ can't
afford to be as patient, especially given the uncertainty of what
the ultimate resolution of the strike will be.
   Karen Madsen, former manager of Eastern benefits compensation,
moved March 20 to Southeast Banks for a similar job offering more
money and more security.
   ``I hope they make it and in a way I'd sort of like to be
there,'' said Ms. Madsen. ``After 19 years, there's still a place
in my heart for Eastern. But I couldn't afford to take the
financial risk and I got the opportunity to go with a good
company.''
   Among pilots, Eastern's generally are some of industry's most
experienced, the pilots union says. But although other major
carriers are anxious to hire experienced pilots, the Eastern
veterans are reluctant to trade their seniority for new jobs
elsewhere.
   ``The seniority repercussions...are more acceptable to a younger
gentleman at lower seniority levels, as opposed to me when I've
been here 16 years,'' said pilot Gary Greksa.
   Within a couple of years at Eastern, Greksa said, he would move
from his $65,000-a-year job as a senior co-pilot to captain. At
another airline, he said, he would have to sign on at an initial,
probationary salary of $18,000, rising to $25,000 as a second
officer the year after that.
   ``That's why we're staying to fight,'' he said.
   But many pilots nevertheless have applied to other airlines,
Greksa said.
   ``We all buy life insurance, but we don't want to die,'' he said.
   Roger Dubois, an Eastern mechanic since 1980, is among strikers
who have other jobs but still hope to return to Eastern. The
35-year-old married father of one, facing mortgage payments, has
started his own home improvement business with another Eastern
Machinist.
   Dubois and friends who also have taken new jobs remain
optimistic about working again for Eastern under new management.
   ``We love the job when we don't think about the last three
years,'' Dubois said. ``We want to go back. We left a part of our
lives there.''

<HEAD>Eight Agree To Surrender Profits From Alleged Insider Trading</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An investment adviser for drugstore giant Revco
D.S. Inc. and seven investors have agreed to surrender profits and
pay fines totaling nearly $1.8 million for alleged insider trading,
the Securities and Exchange Commission says.
   The federal agency filed a complaint Monday in U.S. District
Court accusing Glenn Golenberg of suburban Pepper Pike, president
and owner of Golenberg &amp; Co. of Cleveland, of telling outsiders
that management was considering a debt-financed takeover of the
company before the plan was announced three years ago.
   The SEC said it was the first time an individual was fined for
violations of insider trading regulations without having made any
trades.
   Seven people or their clients eventually earned a total of
$735,000 by trading in Revco stock, the SEC said. Federal
securities laws prohibit trading stocks based on non-public
information.
   The defendants have agreed to repay their profits and nearly $1
million in fines, without admitting or denying guilt, the SEC said.
   The SEC said Golenberg agreed to pay a $470,000 penalty and
consented to an SEC order barring him from acting as a broker,
dealer or investment adviser for at least four years.
   The Twinsburg-based Revco was purchased through a management-led
takeover known as a leveraged buyout that was financed mostly with
borrowed money. The company filed for bankruptcy protection last
July because it couldn't pay its $1.5 billion debt. No other large
leveraged buyout has run into such serious debt trouble.
   Kathleen Obert, a Revco spokeswoman, said Golenberg is a Revco
board member because of his stock holdings, amounting to 150,000
Revco shares as of last May 28.
   ``Revco was the biggest deal of my life,'' he said in a
statement after the SEC filed the complaint. ``It was constantly on
my mind, something I lived and breathed. Regrettably, I talked
about it with a few people who did not have any right to know what
was going on. I now realize the seriousness of that lapse of
judgment.''
   In the same complaint, the SEC accused Golenberg of providing
information to Steve S. Saltzman of Cleveland about the proposed
merger of two smaller firms, Magnetics International Inc. of Maple
Heights and H.K. Porter Inc. Saltzman made $6,850 buying and
selling 2,000 shares of Magnetics common stock and made $27,326
purchasing and selling Revco stock, the SEC said. Saltzman agreed
to repay the money and an equal fine.
   ``I should have known better,'' Golenberg said of the portion of
the complaint dealing with Magnetics.
   Ms. Obert declined to comment on Golenberg's settlement, saying
``that's entirely between the SEC and Mr. Golenberg.'' She said the
company has prepared a five-year business plan for reorganization
but it has not been filed with the federal bankruptcy court yet.
   The other investors accused in the complaint of profiting from
inside information about the Revco buyout, are:
   _Bernard Shavitz of Woodcliff Lake, N.J., a business associate
of Golenberg's. The SEC said Shavitz made $214,000 buying and
selling Revco stock and is asking that Shavitz repay the money
along with a fine of $214,000.
   _Van S. Weinberg of Memphis, Tenn., described as a friend of
Golenberg's. Weinberg is accused of earning $65,000 trading Revco
stock and leaking inside information to the remaining defendants.
The SEC required him to surrender the profits and a pay a $75,000
fine.
   _Stephen Lightman of Memphis, accused of earning $215,218
trading Revco stock. He agreed to repay the money and an equal fine.
   _Lawrence S. Adler of Memphis, an account executive with the
former E.F. Hutton Group Inc., is accused of earning $38,188 for
himself and $141,820 for clients. He agreed to pay $180,008 in
illicit profits and a $19,992 fine.
   _Ray H. Dan of St. Louis is accused of making $31,000 trading
Revco stock. He agreed to repay the money and an equal fine.
   _Carl D. Reiter of Germantown, Tenn., is accused of making
$2,625 as a result of the inside information. He agreed to repay
the money and an equal fine.

   Kollmorgen Corp., a maker of electrical
and optical equipment, has agreed to be taken over by the smaller
Vernitron Corp. for $25 a share, or about $250 million, ending a
five-month battle.
   The agreement Monday followed two weeks of maneuvering by
Stamford-based Kollmorgen as it searched for another buyer and a
better offer for shareholders.
   The merger still depends on the approval of Kollmorgen
shareholders and financing.
   The merger would create a larger technology company, with
products in optics and electronics and more than $400 million in
annual sales.
   The combined assets and sales would provide a larger base needed
to support advanced research and development at Vernitron, a
Deerfield, N.Y.-based company that specializes in electromechanical
devices, officials said.
   Officials said Vernitron is positioning itself for the
unification of the European Common Market in 1992.
   The agreement ended a contest that began with a friendly
Vernitron offer of $20 a share in December, included several
lawsuits, two unfriendly tender offers and Kollmorgen's decision to
search openly for another buyer.
   Vernitron has commitments for $425 million in financing _ $250
million from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and $175 million from
Banque Paribas, a French investment bank.

   The dollar rose in early European trading today
following a three-day May Day holiday weekend in most financial
capitals. Gold prices fell.
   Foreign currency dealers said the dollar appears to have lots of
support, partly from high interest rates.
   ``The market doesn't appear to be afraid of anything right
now,'' said Oswald Diettrich, head market risk adviser for Bank of
America in Frankfurt.
   Other traders said the holiday-shortened week could result in
thin volumes exaggerating any changes in the dollar. Some European

   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.05 yen to a closing 133.85. Later, in

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index climbed to a
new high for the fifth consecutive trading day today, while the
dollar fell slightly against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar, after gaining a total of 2.73 yen in four trading
days, closed at 133.85 yen, down 0.05 yen from Monday's close of
133.90 yen. It opened at 133.75 yen and ranged between 133.65 yen
and 134.05 yen.
   A Mitsubishi Bank dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the Bank of Japan intervened in the market in the afternoon,
checking the dollar's rise from its opening level.
   Despite the central bank's dollar-selling, he added, there was
not much movement in exchange levels during the day.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at 33,954.99, up
161.82 points, or 0.48 percent.
   ``Even though the index rose considerably, the volume was low,''
said a trader at Nomura Securities, adding that the rise was spread
over a wide variety of issues including housing, electricals and
pharmaceuticals.
   ``There is a pattern of buying stocks before extended
vacations,'' the dealer continued, ``and today's actions fit into
that pattern.''
   Japanese markets will be closed from Wednesday until Monday for
a series of holidays, part of Japan's ``Golden Week.''

   Here is a brief comparison between Exxon's
revised plan to clean up the Alaskan oil spill and its original
plan submitted April 15.
   PERSONNEL _ The latest plan calls for 3,400 cleanup workers,
plus an unspecified number outside Prince William Sound. The
original plan recommended a total of 4,000 workers, virtually all
within Prince William Sound. The workers are being paid $16.67 an
hour.
   TIME _ Both plans envisaged completion by Sept. 15. The original
plan was based on assumptions that weather delays would be minimal.
The revised proposal concedes that inclement weather and logistical
problems could idle crews on half the potential workdays.
   NATURAL CLEANSING _ Exxon's revised proposal says that 191 miles
of lightly oiled beach may be left untouched to be cleansed by the
environment. The original proposal did not address ``natural
cleansing.''
   MILES _ The latest plan calls for a cleanup along 364 miles of
coastline, as opposed to about 300 miles in the April 15 proposal.
   PROSPECTS _ Coast Guard Commandant Paul A. Yost, Jr. rejected
the April 15 plan as incomplete. He said he will decide on the
latest proposal within a week.

   Share prices were mostly lower in lackluster
trading at midday Tuesday, as the market ran out of reasons to
extend last week's strong gains after a three-day holiday weekend,
traders said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 8.1
points, or 0.3 percent, at 2,109.9 at 12:17 p.m. The index opened
3.2 points down and then fell as much as 10.1 points at midmorning.
   Volume was 166.0 million shares by midday compared with 373.9
million shares on Friday.
   Fresh concern about the outlook for international interest rates
took the wind from the market's sails at the outset of trading, but
there was scant selling pressure to give the market much momentum,
traders said.
   ``Very little volume, that's really characterizing the market at
the moment,'' said one equities salesman. ``The institutions do
want to come in. If opportunities presented themselves, if this
market does come back a little more, then you will get some
buying.''

<DATELINE>PENDLETON, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The only gasoline station in the small
town of Echo, Ore., has closed and the same fate may be in store
for a string of others, a result of tougher federal regulations on
underground storage tanks.
   Dennis Gronquist, Arlington mayor and Texaco franchise owner,
said there soon may be no stations in the 160 miles between the
Eastern Oregon communities of Arlington and John Day.
   He said station owners and consumers are just beginning to feel
the effects of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations
intended to prevent gasoline leaks from underground storage tanks.
   The EPA estimates 43 percent of all service stations in the
nation with underground tanks will close within the first five
years the policies are in effect.
   Gasoline station owners are being required to upgrade tanks,
install leakage detection devices and obtain leakage accident
insurance. Estimates of the cost range from $12,000 to $50,000 per
station, not including insurance.
   ``We're going to lose all our service stations because nobody
can afford it,'' said Herb Wright, owner of Wright's Chevrolet in
Fossil.
   But Ronald Moyer, a state Department of Environmental Quality
tank specialist, noted that leakage from underground tanks has
sometimes resulted in buildings being blown up or in contamination
of a city's water supply.
   ``Entire communities could be left without water if somebody's
tank leaked,'' Moyer said.
   Dave Barnett, who owns the only station in Ione, Ore., said
Congress and EPA are taking the wrong approach.
   ``I think these people are kind of like the ostrich. They hide
their heads in the sand and think it's going to go away, but it
isn't,'' he said.
   ``The town needs this service,'' Barnett added.
   In order to continue operating, Barnett said he'd have to spend
about $12,000 to install leakage detection devices on his two
underground gasoline storage tanks.
   Barnett also would be required to hold a $1 million insurance
policy.
   ``Quite frankly, it's not good. It's going to close a lot of
stations,'' Barnett said of the regulations.
   ``I think if I had more money, I'd drop everything I was doing
and go to Washington, D.C., and hound them until they hated me,''
Barnett said.

<HEAD>Defense Contractor Objects To Suspension</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHANTILLY, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fairchild Industries Inc. says the
decision by the Defense Logistics Agency to suspend purchases from
the company's Voi-Shan fastener division was an unnecessary
precaution.
   In a statement Monday, Fairchild said it was surprised by the
DLA's decision to suspend Voi-Shan from new government contracts
because of allegations that the division's employees had falsified
testing data on aerospace fasteners.
   The suspension does not affect Fairchild's other federal
contracts.
   Fairchild stock fell 1] Monday on the New York Stock Exchange,
closing at $16. That's $1 below the price offered by the Carlyle
Group, which is seeking to buy the company.
   David Rubenstein, managing partner of the Carlyle Group,
declined to comment on whether the suspension would affect the
group's interest in Fairchild. ``We're studying it carefully,'' he
said.
   Voi-Shan fastener sales to the government accounted for less
than 2 percent of Fairchild's total 1988 revenues. However, a
source quoted today by The Washington Post said the suspension
could scare away commercial customers.
   The suspension comes in the wake of a widespread Pentagon
crackdown on faulty bolts. Several congressional and Pentagon
investigations have revealed that bad fasteners in all types of
military hardware and vehicles is a major problem.
   The Pentagon said former and current employees have told
investigators that they falsified test data when testing equipment
did not work, when tests could not be accomplished in the allotted
time, and when parts failed tests but management decided to approve
them anyway.
   Fairchild said that shortly after learning of the allegations,
it placed three Voi-Shan employees on administrative leave and
conducted an extensive review of inventories. Fairchild said that
no parts failure were found by Fairchild or its customers.

<HEAD>U S West Institutes Smoking Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U S West Communications Inc. has begun enforcing a
new smoking ban in its 2,900 buildings, including about 400 offices
in Colorado.
   Company officials said Monday that smoking will no longer be
allowed in any of its buildings, nor at sites it rents for employee
meetings.
   The policy is designed to protect the health of its 57,500 phone
company employees in 14 western states, as well as eliminate the
cost of providing smoking lounges, company officials said.
   At the same time, U S West is offering to reimburse employees up
to $150 if they enroll in programs to end smoking.
   About 26 percent of the company's employees smoke, said U S West
spokeswoman Debbie Thomas.
   U S West Communications _ the telephone services unit of U S
West Inc. of Englewood _ employes nearly 12,000 workers in
Colorado, including some 9,800 in the Denver metropolitan area
alone.
   Besides company facilities in Colorado, the ban went into effect
Monday at locations in Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico
and Arizona. Smoking already was prohibited at company sites in the
seven other states where U.S. West operates.
   ``The bottom line is there's so much evidence that secondary
smoke is harmful to those who don't smoke that this is the way to
go,'' Thomas said.
   The ban drew immediate criticism from the Communications Workers
of America. A spokesman said the ban could become an issue in talks
on a new labor contract, scheduled to begin next month.
   Mark Belkin, a spokesman for Communications Workers of America
Local 7777, which represents 6,500 U S West workers, is concerned
the ban will be enforced unequally between hourly workers and
corporate officers.
   ``We hope to monitor the situation to make sure the company
enforced things in an equitable fashion,'' Belkin said. ``The
question is whether they're concerned about productivity or whether
it's a means to control people's individual choices.''
   All the corporate concern failed to convince die-hard smokers of
the danger.
   Clustered in twos and threes Monday, sitting outside the
downtown Denver building Monday, a contingent of employees grabbed
a puff.
   ``I like to smoke, and I'll quit when I want to, not because of
some rule,'' said Jan Charles, a 16-year employee of the phone
company and a 17-year smoker.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's purchasing managers predict inflation
will total 3.8 percent this year, down from the 5 percent they
reported last year, a trade association said today.
   The inflation figures are part of a semi-annual economic
forecast by the National Association of Purchasing Management,
which represents 30,000 purchasing agents around the country. The
group is holding its annual conference in Boston this week.
   Forty-five percent of the members surveyed said they expected
their capital expenditures to rise in 1989 while 24 percent said
they expected their expenditures to drop below the 1988 level.
   ``Although this ration of almost 2-to-1 predicts a strong year
for capital expenditures, the increase over 1988 is not expected to
be as great as 1988 was over 1987,'' the forecast said.
   Most of the purchasers said they were paying higher prices in
mid-April than at the end of last year. The forecast said the
purchasers saw prices increase an average of 2.9 percent in the
first 4{ months of this year, but expect inflation to be more
moderate during the rest of the year.

<HEAD>Oilman Hammering Out A Sequel To `Hammer' At Company's Expense</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Occidental Petroleum Corp., which usually
spends money to dig for oil, now is digging into the recent past of
Chairman Armand Hammer at a cost of $367,000, according to a proxy
statement sent to shareholders.
   The company is footing the bill for a sequel to the 91-year-old
industrialist's 1987 autobiography ``Hammer,'' with publication
expected next year, said Occidental spokesman Frank Ashley.
   ```Hammer' only went through 1985,'' Ashley said. ``This book
tells of more recent activities at Occidental and of Dr. Hammer's
activities around the world.''
   Ashley said the boss has had a busy 3{ years.
   In 1986, for example, Hammer helped pay for medical treatment
for victims of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster.
   And last year, he stunned the art world by announcing plans to
build a museum for his $250 million art collection rather than
donate it to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
   Occidental has spent $255,000 so far for the book, much of it
for research and traveling expenses for writer Neil Lyndon, who
helped pen ``Hammer.'' The company expects to spend another
$120,000 to finish the sequel, the proxy statement said.
   Lest any investor worry about misspent funds, the cost of the
sequel represents a sound investment; ``Hammer'' so far has turned
into a literary gusher, earning more than $600,000 in royalties for
Occidental.

<HEAD>Settlement Announced In United Airline Mileage Club Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Under an agreement settling a class-action
lawsuit, participants in United Airlines' frequent flier program
can regain credits lost when rules of the plan were changed for
part of 1987, a lawyer says.
   ``It's a deceptive business practice when customers have
followed the rules and accrued the necessary mileage, but cannot
collect the awards promised that originally led them to join and
participate in the program in the first place,'' said the
plaintiffs' Chicago attorney, Gilbert W. Gordon. Under such
programs, accumulated miles flown can be cashed in for free flights
or service upgrades.
   The lawsuit filed in March 1987 alleged that United was unfair
when it increased mileage requirements for some awards in January
1987. Most original rules were reinstated in July of that year. A
United spokesman said the old rules were restored due to consumer
complaints and competitive reasons, not because of the lawsuit.
   In mailings last week, United provided applications for those
who believe they may be entitled to more program credits.
   Under the 1987 changes, for example, mileage required to earn
one free first-class ticket to Hawaii was raised to 60,000 from
50,000.
   The settlement to the Cook County Circuit Court case was reached
in December 1988, said United spokeswoman Sara Dornacker, who
speculated that attorneys may have delayed the announcement because
of similar lawsuits against two other carriers, American and Delta
Airlines.
   The 1987 United changes applied to new members, as well as to
qualified members who had already accumulated the necessary mileage
for such awards under the old program.
   Lawyers estimate that only a small portion of United's 5 million
Mileage Plus program members would be eligible for extra credit.
   ``The resolution depends on each individual case,'' Ms.
Dornacker said. ``No direct compensation is being made to the
flyers in cash.''
   Attorney Michael J. Freed said lawsuits against American and
Delta are still in Cook County Circuit Court. Freed contends that
changes in the frequent flyers programs by American and Delta
constitute a breach of contract and a violation of the Illinois law.
   Gordon said American has set up limits on the number of people
who can claim free trips on some flights, while Delta has designed
such capacity restrictions, but hasn't instituted them.
   Spokeswomen for Delta and American said they couldn't comment on
pending litigation.

<TEXT>
   Officials meeting at the 21st annual Offshore
Technology Conference said oil companies can do little to end the
price fluctuations that have crippled the industry, but can
influence their own costs of doing business.
   ``Energy industry executives must remember that oil is a
commodity subject to the same pressures as other commodities,''
said Thomas C. Theobold, chairman of Chicago-based Continental
Bank, a major industry lender. ``As a lender to your industry, we
can only predict volatility.''
   Theobold, representing the financial sector Monday on a panel
kicking off the week-long conference, said oil companies must build
in more economic flexibility.
   ``I know it isn't a lot of fun but we might as well admit it's
happening,'' he said.
   Joining him on the keynote panel were H. Laurance Fuller,
president of Amoco Corp. of Chicago; Jose Napoleon Lista, vice
minister of energy and mines for Venezuela; and John C. Crosbie,
Canadian minister for international trade.
   The conference is primarily a technical gathering of some 25,000
engineers and executives involved in offshore oil and gas
exploration and production. More than 15,000 people attended Monday.
   Lista, the panel's representative of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries by virtue of his country's membership
in the cartel, said OPEC countries are concerned about the recent
sharp increases in the price of oil.
   He complained that the energy consuming countries too often view
OPEC members as ``wearing black hats,'' noting that the OPEC
charter allowed members to receive a fair return on their oil.
   ``Maybe we can wear the white hats, too,'' he said. ``None of
the happenings that have caused this (jump in oil prices) is under
the control of OPEC.
   ``There's nothing we can do about the spill,'' he said,
referring to the recent oil spill in Alaska. ``There's nothing we
can do about the excessive use of gasoline in Europe and the United
States.
   ``If the OPEC countries are allowed by the rest of the world,
OPEC will keep the rest of the world supplied with oil. We want the
consuming countries to benefit as much as producing countries from
the resource nature has given us.''
   Although Lista said he thought OPEC would keep prices at a level
``where everyone will be happy,'' Fuller said there are indications
several members of the cartel will push for higher production
quotas when the current $18 per-barrel price agreement expires
later this summer.
   ``The underlying facts of the world supply and demand argue
against a strong price recovery,'' he said. ``In general, the
industry outlook is restrained.''
   Crosbie said he hoped Canada would be viewed as an attractive
place for investment and that the country's oil and gas industry
showed great promise, but he downplayed the significance of energy
price forecasts.
   He noted that when forecasts in the early 1980s pointed to
$65-per-barrel oil, he and his party backed a 30-cent-per-gallon
gasoline tax that Canadian voters found abhorrent.
   The unpopular stance was reflected in the party's lack of
success in the next election, Crosbie said.
   Fuller said Amoco sees the possibility that the domestic oil rig
count, 751 as of Monday, could double within five years.
   ``While an improvement, this increase is not enough to reverse
domestic production decline,'' he said.
   While oil companies cannot control prices, Fuller said, they can
address their own costs.

<TEXT>
   More than 100 days into his presidency, it's
time for George Bush to make good on his promise to renew five-year
quotas on steel imports, says the outgoing chairman of the nation's
largest steelmaker.
   USX Corp. Chairman David M. Roderick said Monday steelmakers
count 225 sponsors in the House and 56 in the Senate _ a majority
in both houses _ for legislation authorizing the president to renew
the quotas, called Voluntary Restraint Agreements.
   ``This ... should encourage the Bush administration to publicly
announce its plan to extend the VRAs,'' he told shareholders at
their annual meeting.
   Bush said late in the 1988 presidential campaign that he would
renew the program, but has not said how long the quotas might
continue or what products and countries might be covered.
   ``We haven't heard from his lips,'' Roderick said.
   The quotas are scheduled to expire Sept. 30. The three-month
delay between orders and shipments could make the domestic market
uncertain and vulnerable to foreign predators, he said.
   ``If we don't have a clear definition of the VRAs and a clear
definition of when they're going to be extended, you're going to
find a lot of people in here trying to dump steel,'' he said at a
news conference before the meeting.
   Dumping is selling at illegally low prices, such as below the
cost of production.
   Roderick said USX nearly has finished preparing trade suits
against steelmakers in Japan, Germany, Brazil and most other major
steel exporting nations. The suits will be filed if there is any
gap in the quota program.
   USX said 65 percent of its customers support renewal, 25 percent
to 30 percent were indifferent and only 5 percent oppose it.
   The Bush administration should release terms of the renewal by
May, Congress should act by June, and negotiations with nations on
their individual quotas should begin by July 1, he said.
   ``Their extension for a five-year period is essential to the
continuing turnaround of American steelmaking,'' Roderick said.
``Failure to extend them would cast a cloud over our steel unit's
prosperity.''
   The quotas were intended to limit foreign steel to around 20
percent of the U.S. market, protecting hard-pressed American
producers from losing customers to predatory pricing by
government-subsidized producers overseas. The quotas fell short of
the goal in the first few years but are now on target.
   Meanwhile, Roderick announced plans to spend $240 million to
further modernize its largest plant, at Gary, Ind. The keystone of
the improvements will be a continuous slab caster designed to shape
1.6 million tons of molten steel directly into slabs, using less
energy and less time and leaving fewer blemishes in the steel.
   The new caster, planned to begin operating in mid-1991, will
eliminate 400 to 500 of the 7,500 jobs at the Gary Works, Roderick
said. Attrition will ease the effect of the cuts.

   A U.S. Supreme Court decision to review the
proposed partial merger of Detroit's daily newspapers spread gloom
at the Detroit Free Press, but competitors at The Detroit News
cheered the ruling.
   The high court's announcement Monday that it will hear arguments
on the proposed Joint Operating Agreement set the stage for its
first review of the 19-year-old Newspaper Preservation Act. A
decision isn't expected until next year.
   Analysts said the wait will force Knight-Ridder Inc. to
determine how much longer it can absorb losses from its Detroit
Free Press. A major Knight-Ridder stockholder, the University of
California, said it will reconsider its investment.
   After being briefed at a staff meeting, Free Press employees
trudged back to work at telephones and computer terminals. For
feature writer Neal Rubin and others, the decision means more
uncertainty.
   ``We've been punched around so many times. It's like, `OK, we'll
waltz with it again,''' Rubin said.
   A few blocks away, at Gannett Co. Inc.'s News, most employees
oppose a JOA, said reporter Louis Mleczko, also president of Local
22 of The Newspaper Guild of Detroit.
   ``The mood today was just ebullient _ cheering and applause in
the newsroom,'' Mleczko said.
   He also said the union will press for new contracts talks. Amid
uncertainty over the JOA, more than 3,000 union employees at News
and Free Press have been without contract wage increases since 1986.
   The newspapers have sought since May 1986 to cut costs by
merging business, advertising and production departments while
maintaining separate news and editorial staffs. They would split
profits and losses equally for most of the 100-year agreement.
   The papers said the Free Press was in danger of failing. Gannett
said it would spend as much as needed to force the 157 year-old
Free Press out of business. Knight-Ridder said without the
agreement, it would close the Free Press.
   Then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III approved the agreement in
August 1988, but challenges by the Michigan Citizens for an
Independent Press and the Washington-based advocacy group Public
Citizen delayed implementation.
   No stay is in effect, and the newspapers would have the option
of merging while awaiting the Supreme Court's decision.
   Knight-Ridder's president and chief executive officer, James K.
Batten, said the organization continues ``to believe strongly in
the fairness and justice of our case on behalf of a JOA in
Detroit'' and will decide in coming days what to do next.
   ``Clearly, from their point of view, they would like to
eliminate the cash drain of the Free Press,'' said John S. Reidy,
communications industry analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert in New
York.
   ``On the other hand, if they wait it out, then they'll have half
interest in a JOA, which will earn considerably more for them than
the loss last year. So it is a tough decision.''
   ``There are some second thoughts,'' said Leslie Gallaugher, who
manages 2.1 million shares of Knight-Ridder stock owned by the
University of California. ``We're going to take a hard look at our
investment in Knight-Ridder.''
   The Free Press lost $18.5 million in 1988, Knight-Ridder said in
recent court filings. Gannett has released no annual loss figures
but has said the 115 year-old News lost $64.95 million from 1980
through 1987.
   ``It would be my hope that we would stay the course,'' Free
Press Managing Editor Heath Meriwether said. He acknowledged
employees are discouraged.
   Gannett, through spokeswoman Sheila Gibbons, said it was
reviewing the decision and would not comment.
   The Michigan Citizens' group argued that the newspapers' losses
resulted from struggles to force each other out of business rather
than conditions inherent in the Detroit market.
   ``We think that the tendency of these types of monopolistic
arrangements is negative,'' said State Sen. John Kelly, a leader of
the group.
   The Newspaper Guild first opposed the agreement, though it
dropped opposition in 1988 when Knight-Ridder said a JOA would mean
closing the Free Press.
   The newspapers say closing the Free Press would cost 2,200 jobs
while a joint operating agreement would mean a total of 600 to 800
jobs lost at the two papers.
   Gannett, based in Arlington, Va., is the nation's largest
newspaper publishing group. Knight-Ridder, headquartered in Miami,
is the second largest.

<HEAD>Board Of Trade Commissions Study Of Dual Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The controversial practice of dual trading on the
futures market will be assessed by an outside specialist, the
Chicago Board of Trade announced.
   The exchange said Monday that it has hired economist Sanford J.
Grossman of Princeton University to study the practice in
conjunction with the Board of Trade's own review of trading
practices.
   The announcement comes three months after disclosure of a
federal investigation into suspected fraud that is said to involve
dual trading at the Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Dual trading allows traders to buy or sell futures contracts for
themselves and customers at the same time. Dual trading isn't
illegal but critics call it a conflict of interest and say it
encourages fraud by unscrupulous traders who trade their own
accounts first, profiting at the expense of their customers.
   ``The Chicago Board of Trade has dedicated itself to evaluating
all aspects of trading practices and market surveillance,'' said
Karsten Mahlmann, chairman of the exchange. ``Commissioning this
study is another step in this process.''
   Meanwhile, at a meeting Monday, Merc officials told more than
200 exchange members that they have no choice but to reform trading
practices or else invite government intervention.
   ``In order to achieve the right to continued self-regulation, we
must act responsibly,'' said Leo Melamed, chairman of the Merc's
executive committee.
   Merc officials leaving the meeting also said they expect a
referendum will be held on the most controversial aspects of the
reform package proposed April 19 by a special exchange committee,
the Chicago Sun-Times reported today. Among proposals is a ban on
most forms of dual trading.
   But Melamed said that ``much fine-tuning is required'' on the
proposals.
   Grossman, who will assess dual trading at the CBOT, was a
contributor to a report on the 1987 stock market crash commissioned
by the New York Stock Exchange.
   The CBOT, at the request of the Commodities Futures Trading
Commission, had previously conducted a study of dual trading. The
study said the practice of dual trading results in a better price
for customers and adds to the liquidity of the market.
   The study also contended that customers can choose to trade with
a broker who does not trade for himself.

<HEAD>Pepsi's Profit Soared 46 Percent In First Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soft drinks giant PepsiCo Tuesday reported a 45.7 percent surge
in first-quarter income, reflecting strong results in each of the
company's three divisions.
   It marked the eighth straight quarter in which PepsiCo's
earnings, excluding one-time gains and charges, have grown by 25
percent or more.
   PepsiCo said its profit rose to 165.1 million, or 62 cents a
share, in the 12 weeks ended March 25 from $113.3 million, or 43
cents a share, in the comparable 1988 period.
   Excluding a $14.5 million pre-tax charge for the reorganization
of PepsiCo's domestic soft drink business in 1988's first quarter,
the latest quarterly earnings gain came to 33 percent.
   Sales totaled $2.96 billion in the first quarter, up 19.3
percent from $2.48 billion a year earlier.
   Worldwide restaurant sales expanded by 27 percent to $1.07
billion from $844.5 million. PepsiCo owns Pizza Huts, Kentucky
Fried Chicken outlets and Taco Bell restaurants.
   Soft drink sales went up by 18 percent to $1.05 billion from
$893 million. Domestic results were buoyant and international
profits in the soft drink division doubled. Sales of Diet Pepsi and
Moutain Dew brands were particularly strong while sales of regular
Pepsi were flat.
   Sales of snack foods rose 12 percent to $830.8 million from
$741.4 million. Robust growth in sales of corn-based items, such as
Doritos, Fritos and Cheetos, was partially offset by declines in
the volume of potato-based products due to drought-related
allocations of potato supplies early in the quarter.

<HEAD>Attorneys General Plan Joint Investigation Into Higher Gasoline Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN K. WILEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys general of three Pacific
Northwest states want the nation's chief law officer to investigate
why oil prices have risen sharply, especially since the March 24
Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska.
   Dave Frohnmayer of Oregon, Ken Eikenberry of Washington and Jim
Jones of Idaho said in a news release Monday they will ask U.S.
Attorney General Richard Thornburg and Daniel Oliver, chairman of
the Federal Trade Commission, for a federal investigation of
gasoline prices.
   The three also scheduled a news conference this afternoon in
Spokane to announce a joint action of their own ``in pursuit of an
explanation of the sudden and extreme increase in oil prices since
the grounding of the Exxon Valdez,'' according to a statement from
Eikenberry's office.
   The group also planned to ask executives of major oil companies
to meet with them to explain the price increases.
   The oil industry blames the sharp rise in crude oil prices,
which have increased more than $7 a barrel since January, for most
of the higher prices at the gas pumps. Concerns over tight gasoline
supplies for the summer driving season escalated following the
Alaska oil spill and an explosion at a North Sea oil rig.
   More than 10 million gallons of crude oil spilled into Alaska's
Prince William Sound when the Exxon tanker struck a reef March 24.
   Since then, gasoline prices have increased an average 10 percent
nationally, while the Pacific Northwest experienced price surges as
high as 25 percent in less than a month, said Marla Rae, executive
assistant to Frohnmayer.
   But the oil industry says that crude oil prices surged since
last November while gasoline prices did not experience a comparable
rise.
   The joint action was necessary because of the high costs of
pursuing such investigations, Ms. Rae said, noting that some state
agencies are still involved in anti-trust litigation stemming from
gasoline shortages in the early '70s.
   She characterized the proposed action as ``a consumer-related
matter,'' rather than a possible anti-trust investigation.
   Tina Kondo, an assistant attorney general in Seattle, said the
Washington state investigation was sparked by consumer complaints
and requests from members of the state Senate Transportation
Committee and King County Executive Tim Hill.
   The petroleum price increases have hit the region's agriculture
and tourism industries hard, Ms. Rae said.
   Shannon Watts, a spokeswoman for the American Automobile
Association in Seattle, said self-serve regular gasoline prices in
Washington state, in 10 areas surveyed, rose 9.3 cents between
March 14 and April 5-6.
   ``That's a definite increase,'' she said. ``Prices were steadily
going down over the last year, but we got our first increase _ an
average 2.2 cents _ between Christmas and Easter.''
   Higher prices will surely be reflected in another survey for the
Memorial Day weekend, planned for the week of May 7-14, she said.

<HEAD>Corporate Raider Says Trade Barriers May Be Needed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT ROTHSCHILD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Takeover strategist T. Boone Pickens says he has
been preaching free enterprise for years, but now that he is
involved in a dispute with a Japanese company, he thinks trade
barriers may be needed.
   ``Something now has to be done, and if necessary I think you
ought to put up some barriers temporarily until we get a level
playing field,'' Pickens said Monday.
   Pickens, a Texas oilman known worldwide for his corporate raids,
has purchased 20.2 percent of Koito Manufacturing Co. to become the
largest stockholder of the Japanese automobile parts manufacturer.
   He has been rebuffed by Koito Manufacturing in trying to seat
his representatives on the board, he said.
   Pickens said he spoke recently with Secretary of Commerce Robert
Mosbacher and about a dozen members of Congress concerning his
Japanese business venture.
   ``I found a very sympathetic ear to what I was saying,'' Pickens
said of his meetings with key trade legislators in Washington.
   ``At the same time I told them I'm not asking for any help. I
just think that here in America, we have been way too lax and too
easy on letting the Japanese come,'' into U.S. markets, he said.
   Pickens said he told Koito representatives that he wants to be a
long-term stockholder and his stock purchase is not part of a
hostile takeover attempt.
   ``Still the attitude is one that we don't want you in Japan. And
this is what kind of got my back up in the whole affair. I just
said to hell with this. It's got to be different than this,'' he
said.
   Pickens, who is considering a bid for the Republican Party
gubernatorial nomination, said he has always supported foreign
companies investing in the United States, but that his experience
with Koito convinced him more needs to be done to open foreign
markets to U.S. businesses.
   But Pickens said he is not seeking any federal help in his
struggle with Koito.
   ``I've drilled dry holes before, and this may be one of them,''
he said.
   Pickens, a general partner of Mesa Limited Partnership, an oil
and gas company, was in the state Capitol Monday to testify against
proposed legislation aimed at making it more difficult for hostile
takeovers.

<HEAD>City Lets $600,000 Sit In Bank That Later Hired Mayor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bank held $600,000 in federal funds for the
city without paying interest for three months in an account
established by Mayor Tom Bradley and controlled by one of his
aides, a newspaper reported today.
   Two months after the situation was discovered, Bradley started
earning $18,000 a year as a consultant to the bank, the Los Angeles
Herald Examiner reported.
   Bradley's ties to Far East National Bank and another
institution, Valley Federal Savings and Loan Association, have
prompted an investigation by the city attorney's office and Police
Department into conflict-of-interest allegations and spawned the
formation of a city ethics panel.
   The panel of seven civic and religious leaders, appointed by
Bradley one day after his narrow re-election April 11, met for the
first time Monday and sought to distance itself from the mayor and
the City Council.
   The panel agreed to organize as an independent organization,
probably as a nonprofit corporation, and not take any funds from
Bradley, his political action committee or the City Council.
   ``We will be most effective, most credible ... if we are
independent,'' said Geoffrey Cowan, former state chairman of the
political watchdog group Common Cause. Cowan was asked by Bradley
to head the panel.
   According to records obtained by the Herald Examiner, Bradley
authorized the Far East bank account and his top aide, Anton
Calleia, controlled deposits made to the account by the federal
government in 1987.
   On Aug. 4, 1987, $600,000 in federal transportation funds were
deposited in the account, and on Oct. 31, 1987, $789,230 was added,
records show.
   It was not until Nov. 9, 1987 that the city treasurer's office
discovered Far East held nearly $1.4 million in city funds and
ordered the bank to return the money to the city, the Herald
Examiner reported.
   The money should have been transferred to the city treasury
within a day or two, said William Hoss, the city treasurer's cash
management and investment officer.
   A spokesman for the federal Urban Mass Transit Administration,
which sent the money to the city, said the deposit may have
violated federal regulations because money from federal grants must
be spent promptly. The spokesman asked not to be identified.
   Phone calls to Calleia's office for comment were not returned.
Bradley has refused to comment on his ties to the financial
institutions pending the outcome of the city attorney's
investigation.
   The mayor has denied knowing the city was doing business with
the bank in 1988 at a time Far East was paying him $18,000 a year
to act as a consultant. The mayor returned the $18,000 after the
matter was made public.

<TEXT>
   The House Banking Committee today expanded the
board that President Bush wants to oversee the cleanup of the
savings and loan crisis to include Housing and Urban Development
Secretary Jack Kemp and a private real estate specialist.
   After earlier enacting much tougher capital standards than Bush
originally wanted to impose on the thrift industry, the 51-member
committee today provided for more administration oversight of the
$100 billion bailout.
   The effort _ which will involve the largest disposition of
government-owned property since the Louisiana Purchase _ will be
overseen by a new agency called the Resolution Trust Corp.
   ``Even with the best of intentions, we'll still end up with
about 1,000 new Donald Trumps,'' said committee Chairman Henry B.
Gonzalez, D-Texas, referring to the billionaire New York developer.
``This has been an issue that has raised its head every time in a
bailout.''
   Trump's acquisition of real estate through the government
bailout of the Penn Central Railroad in the early 1970s sparked his
financial rise.
   Bush had wanted a three-member board headed by Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady and including Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to run the
Resolution Trust Corp.
   The Banking Committee expanded the board to include two more
voting members, Kemp and a real estate expert to be selected; plus
one non-voting member, L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., who will be in charge of the day-to-day
task of administering the cleanup.
   Lawmakers said their chief aim is providing more administrative
oversight and expertise in an effort to thwart abuses that have
characterized other bailouts. Putting Thornburgh on the board will
help, they said.
   For example, the Federal Asset Disposition Association, created
by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to dispose of property that
fell into government hands from S&amp;L failures in the early 1980s has
been plagued with accusations of inside dealing and political
croynyism.
   ``There was a lot of talk about fraud, abuse and criminal
activity'' in the S&amp;L industry, said Rep. Chalmers Wylie of Ohio,
the ranking Republican on the Banking Committee. ``The attorney
general might be useful in finding some of that property that was
disposed of in ways that were not all that kosher.''
   After last week toughening Bush's proposed capital standards,
the House panel on Monday beat bac{rw'' exemptions from capital
requirements that have allowed many S&amp;L owners to operate with
little or no money of their own at risk.
   Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mullins called Monday's
action ``another good day'' for the administration, praising
Democrats on the panel for helping defeat ``accounting devices''
offered primarily by young GOP lawmakers ``to water down'' what
Bush wants.
   However, the fight is not over. Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., who
as chairman of the House Rules Committee has controlling influence
over what issues are revisited when a bill reaches the House floor,
last week said in a letter he strongly supports continuation of the
``good will'' exemptions.
   According to industry and government records, at least 14 S&amp;Ls
in Florida with assets totaling $26 billion have little or no
capital other than ``good will.'' And half of them have a negative
net worth when ``good will'' is excluded from their balance sheets.
   Meanwhile, Jesse Jackson spent more than two hours Monday
lobbying lawmakers on the 51-member committee for amendments he
wants to make S&amp;Ls and banks devote more of their lending to
mortgages for low-income families and inner city redevelopment.
   Specifically, Jackson wants to make banks and S&amp;Ls publicly
disclose the race, gender and income levels of mortgage applicants
as a way of discouraging ``redlining'' discrimination.
   And he is supporting an amendment by Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.,
that would require 15 percent to 20 percent of the residential
property that the government is inheriting as a result of S&amp;L
failures to be offered to local housing authorities at a discounted
price.
   Bush's plan would raise an immediate $50 billion for the bailout
through the creation of an off-budget bond underwriter at an
estimated cost to taxpayers of $200 billion to $250 billion over
the next 30 years.
   ``This `Read my lips' slogan that he's adhering to is the most
costly slogan in history,'' Jackson told reporters in a room that
the committee set aside for his use. ``The Reagan-Bush
administration got us into trouble by disregarding their charge and
mandate to regulate.''
   The key vote Monday was on an amendment by Rep. Thomas Ridge,
D-Pa., to give regulators authority to continue on a case-by-case
basis the so-called ``good will'' exemptions from cash tangible
capital requirements that the committee had approved last week.
   Ridge's amendment was defeated by a 28-23 vote after opponents
called good will ``fake capital'' and said it is worthless as a
resource.
   ``We're trying to be tough and fair, and not just tough,'' said
Ridge, who cited hundreds of S&amp;Ls in Illinois, Pennsylvania, New
York, New Jersey and Ohio that lost much of their tangible capital
in the early 1980s by taking over failed thrifts and absorbing
their losses.
   In exchange, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. _
itself near insolvency _ granted those once-healthy S&amp;Ls more than
$20 billion in ``good will'' exemptions from normal capital
requirements, lasting up to 40 years.
   Under current accounting practices, that good will now accounts
for one-third of the industry's total capital of $60 billion.

   Chrysler Corp. said today its first-quarter
earnings rose 91 percent over the same period last year, when the
corporation's profits were dented by the closing of some parts
plants.
   The No. 3 U.S. automaker said it earned $351 million, or $1.50 a
share, during the first three months of this year, compared with
$184 million, or 83 cents per share, in the same period last year.
   Chrysler's profits came on first-quarter 1989 revenues of $9.95
billion, up 16.3 percent from its first-quarter revenues last year.
   The year-ago results included a $93 million, or
42-cents-a-share, one-time charge the company incurred from closing
some Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary's plants.
   Without the closings, first-quarter earnings last year came to
$277 million, or $1.25 a share, 26.7 percent less than
first-quarter profits this year.
   Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca said the company's share of the
car market dipped during the first quarter. But it maintained a
strong presence in the light truck market, especially in the
minivan segment, where Chrysler makes about half of such vehicles
sold in the United States.
   Last month, General Motors Corp. reported its first-quarter
earnings rose 42.2 percent, to $1.55 billion, or $2.37 per share,
over last year. Ford Motor Co. said that in the first quarter this
year, it earned $1.64 billion, or $3.44 a share, up 0.9 percent
from a year ago.
   The combined Big Three earnings made for the best first quarter
in the companies' history as they earned $3.54 billion, topping by
$324 million the first-quarter record set in 1984.
   Chrysler, whose earnings have been hit hard in the past by
incentive costs, was the last of the Big Three to jump into the
latest incentive pool, offering free financing on two-year loans
for all of its cars and some trucks. GM and Ford offer interest as
low as 2.9 percent.
   Much of the cost of those incentives will show up on the Big
Three's second-quarter balance sheets.
   Iacocca said the company benefited from sales of the Dodge
Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim, which replaced its compact K-series
cars, and in the more-expensive models. Also during the quarter,
Chrysler began two shifts of production at its Newark, Del., plant,
which makes the Spirit-Acclaim line.
   Meantime, Chrysler Financial Corp., the automaker's financing
arm, said it earned $65 million during the first quarter, the same
as the first three months of last year.
   The subsidiary's automotive lending operations, Chrysler Credit,
reported the number of new and used vehicles it financed rose 11.4
percent during the first quarter from the same period last year.

<HEAD>Report: AMR Considering Commuter Plane Order</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parent of American Airlines is nearing an
announcement that it is ordering up to 100 commuter aircraft to
equip its regional airlines, a newspaper reported today.
   The Dallas Morning News quoted unnamed industry sources as
saying they believe Fort Worth-based American is leaning toward
Sweden's Saab for the order although the airline is still
evaluating different aircraft types.
   An announcement of firm orders for 50 aircraft and options for
50 more is expected within a few weeks, the sources told the
newspaper.
   American's parent, AMR Corp., would use the planes to outfit
regional airlines operated by its AMR Eagle Inc. commuter
subsidiary. Sources said the order has a potential value of $700
million to $1 billion, depending on the aircraft models ordered.
   American officials reportedly are also considering turboprop
aircraft produced by Boeing Co.'s Canada-DeHavilland Division,
based near Toronto; ATR, a joint French-Italian company; and Saab.
   But the News' sources said American favors Saab because of price
and partly because the Swedish manufacturer would have delivery
positions available earlier than the other two candidates.
   The new aircraft would be used both to replace older planes at
AMR's commuter subsidiaries and to enlarge their fleets, said
Robert E. Martens, president of AMR Eagle.
   American, since 1987, has acquired five of the commuter airlines
it formerly had marketing arrangements with. The carriers feed
traffic into American's hubs such as Dallas-Fort Worth.

   Prices crept higher in listless trading on Wall
Street today with no substantive news to motivate investors.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 2.20 to 2,417.16
as of noon EDT.
   Advancing issues were ahead of decliners by a margin of about 4
to 3, with 712 issues up, 545 down and 565 unchanged on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 80.22 million shares by midday.
   ``It hasn't done much of anything today,'' said Jack Barbanel, a
market analyst with Gruntal &amp; Co. ``There was some support from
program traders, but the market by itself doesn't have enough
momentum.''
   ``There's not too much propelling the action one way or
another,'' said Dennis Jarrett, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp;
Co.
   Jarrett noted the bond market was tranquil, and although central
banks were intervening in foreign exchange markets and selling
dollars, this development did not seem to affect stock trading.
   The government reported today that sales of new homes fell 5.5
percent in March and that orders to U.S. factories rose 0.7 percent
last month. But Barbanel said the statistics also had little effect
on trading.
   He said the market was unlikely to move with any conviction
until the government issues its unemployment report for April on
Friday.
   The most actively-traded issue on the NYSE was Texaco, down [ to
54[.
   Among other active stocks, Pepsico rose 1[ to 49\ after
announcing its first-quarter earnings.
   Among blue chip issues, General Electric rose \ to 49 while AT&amp;T

   Ogilvy Group, which soared more than $17 Monday after WPP Group
PLC proposed a $730 million buyout of the advertising concern, was
up a more modest { to 49| in over-the-counter trading.
   Another over-the-counter issue, R.P. Scherer, fell 3\ to 30[
after a Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. unit agreed to acquire
the gelatin capsule manufacturer.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose

   The AFL-CIO today endorsed plans for a
nationwide labor boycott of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. if
its unions strike later this month, a strategy that could put labor
in the unusual position of funneling millions of dollars to a
non-union company.
   The federation's governing council approved the plan at its
spring meeting, acknowledging AT&amp;T's competitors were non-union but
promising nonetheless to switch long-distance carriers if asked to
do so by the Communications Workers of America and the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
   ``The AFL-CIO will be prepared to mobilize its resources to
assist union workers at AT&amp;T and to call for the fullest support
possible from affiliated unions, state federations and local labor
councils,'' the council said in its resolution.
   In an accompanying statement the council said, ``Despite the
fact that most of AT&amp;T's competitors are non-union, the AFL-CIO
believes picket lines _ whether visible or invisible _ are a
crucial form of communication to inform union members and other
consumers about unfair actions taken by an employer.''
   Officials of the CWA and IBEW said that in the event of a strike
and boycott they would urge labor organizations and union members
who use AT&amp;T to instead use non-union US Sprint Communications Co.
   ``One of the opportunities we have is the power to severely
impact the enormous revenues generated by electronic services of
the telecommunications industry,'' CWA President Morton Bahr said
Monday in touching on the proposal during a speech to the CWA
convention in Los Angeles.
   Labor officials familiar with the plan said that if Bahr and
IBEW President Jack Barry decided to launch a boycott the 14
million-member AFL-CIO would urge its affiliate unions and their
members to switch to Sprint by using that company's local access
numbers. That process would allow members to use Sprint without
having to switch long-distance carriers permanently.
   AFL-CIO officials said most if not all of its member unions use
AT&amp;T for long-distance service, with some of the larger unions
paying the company about $1 million a month.
   ``It's hundreds of millions of dollars a year,'' said Ms.
Zucker, who said she could not immediately provide a more specific
estimate.
   She acknowledged that a non-union company would benefit from
such a boycott but said, ``We are prepared to do this if we have to
win jobs with justice at AT&amp;T. ... We don't want to promote Sprint.
What we are promoting is the fact that unions can do this, that thi
is one tool we can use at the bargaining table to achieve a fair
contract.''
   An AT&amp;T spokeswoman said the company considered the proposal
``self-defeating'' because it would help AT&amp;T's competitors and
therefore possibly cost union members their jobs.
   The presentation to the AFL-CIO executive council comes at a
time when the unions are grumbling about AT&amp;T's negotiating
positions, primarily a company proposal to shift more health-care
costs to workers.
   The talks are in recess and due to resume Monday, three weeks
before expiration of current contracts. It is the first time the
two unions have negotiated jointly with AT&amp;T. CWA struck the
company in 1986 but AT&amp;T was able to keep half of its manufacturing
plants open because IBEW workers continued to work.

   Polaroid Corp. took great pains to avoid
competition with well-established Eastman Kodak Co., the Polaroid
chairman testified today as a court tried to determine how much
Kodak should pay for infringing on its rival's instant-photography
technology.
   Chairman William J. McCune Jr., the opening witness of the
trial, began outlining the corporate history of his company,
beginning with founder Edwin Land's quest for instant photography
in the 1940s after his daughter asked why she could immediately see
a picture her father had taken.
   McCune said throughout its history Polaroid had tried to avoid
direct competition with Kodak, the leader in the photography field.
   He said Kodak could have taken the ``bread and butter'' from the
Polaroid plate and the firm took pains to avoid a marketing
competition.
   In opening arguments Monday before U.S. District Judge A. David
Mazzone, Kodak argued that the $12 billion that Polaroid is seeking
in its patent infringement lawsuit against Kodak is greater than
all of Polaroid's profits from 1947 to 1987.
   The Kodak lawyers sought to portray Polaroid as a corporate
opportunist looking for a windfall from the 13-year-old lawsuit.
   Polaroid's lawyers, on the other hand, pointed to a Kodak
internal memo as evidence that the Rochester, N.Y.-based company
knowingly violated seven of Polaroid's patents when it began
selling instant cameras in 1976.
   They said Walter A. Fallon, who was then Kodak's chairman and
chief executive, personally reviewed the memo and jotted the words
``big block'' in the margin next to a paragraph about Polaroid's
patents.
   Kodak's lead counsel, Richard E. Carlton, did not discuss the
memo in his opening statement. But he argued that Kodak's foray
into instant cameras and film was based on advice from a New York
City law firm, Kenyon &amp; Kenyon, that turned out to be faulty.
   If Mazzone awards Polaroid anything close to $12 billion, it
will be the largest patent infringement decision in history, far
surpassing the record $207 million that Smith International Inc.
was ordered to pay Hughes Tool Co. three years ago for copying
drill bit technology.
   Whether Kodak violated Polaroid's patents is no longer in
question. A judge ruled in 1985 that Kodak had done so, and the
U.S. Supreme Court let that ruling stand Monday.
   The only issue in the current trial is how much Kodak's
violations hurt Polaroid and whether they were deliberate, which
would open the way to punitive damages.
   Kodak argued in its pre-trial briefs that the most it should
have to pay Cambridge-based Polaroid is $177 million, or 5 percent
royalties on the instant cameras and film Kodak sold from 1976
until 1985.
   Polaroid bases its huge damage claim on the grounds that Kodak
deprived it of billions of dollars in sales and started a price war
that forced it to sell some cameras below cost. In addition,
Polaroid contends that Kodak caused long-term damaged to the market
by portraying instant cameras as cheap toys rather than serious
equipment.
   Kodak contends, however, that its entry into the market actually
benefited Polaroid, because the millions of dollars it spent on
advertising and promotion increased demand for both brands of
instant cameras.
   The case was been divided into two portions, the first dealing
with whether Kodak violated Polaroid's patents, and the second with
financial compensation.
   The first portion went to trial in 1981 and resulted in an
October 1985 ruling by U.S. District Judge Rya Zobel that Kodak had
infringed some of Polaroid's most essential patents. On her orders,
Kodak quit the instant photography business in January 1986 after
losing more than $600 million.
   Kodak appealed Mrs. Zobel's decision, arguing that she had a
conflict of interest because her mother-in-law owned 1,000 shares
of Kodak stock. But a federal appeals court affirmed the ruling,
noting that Mrs. Zobel had told both companies in 1981 that her
mother-in-law owned the shares, and neither company had objected.
   The U.S. Supreme Court announced Monday it would not review the
appeals court's ruling, which means Mrs. Zobel's decision is the
final word.

<TEXT>
   Government and the automotive industry must
intensify efforts to find new ways of fueling the nation's vehicles
if an oil crisis is to be averted in the 1990s, Sen. John D.
Rockefeller IV said Tuesday.
   ``We need to think systematically about what must be done by the
end of the next decade to displace millions of barrels a day of
imported oil with alternative fuels,'' the West Virginia Democrat
told the Society of Automotive Engineers.
   ``It is time for us to get on with the job of making the United
States energy secure again.''
   Rockefeller's remarks came at the opening of the society's
three-day conference on technical and regulatory issues facing the
automotive industry, including fuel economy, safety and alternative
fuels.
   The major U.S. automakers have built prototypes of cars using
alcohol-based fuels. However, efforts to promote such vehicles as
commercial products have been constrained by relatively cheap oil
prices during much of the 1980s and the lack of a national
distribution network for fuels other than gasoline.
   ``The assumption that we can become dependent on imported oil
because it is now cheap will become a very expensive assumption in
the long run. It does not take much imagination to envision an
energy crisis in the 1990s,'' Rockefeller said.
   Rockefeller said the government must avoid a narrow focus in
making automotive policy.
   ``We cannot assume that all the world's problems can be solved
just by regulating ... the automobile,'' Rockefeller said.
   Rockefeller said the Senate energy subcommittee on research and
development would hold hearings in June aimed at finding ways to
encourage the replacement of gasoline with alternative fuels, such
as methanol, ethanol and natural gas.

<HEAD>MIT Study Calls For Wrenching Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans need to make wrenching changes to
succeed in the global economy even though there is no crisis
pushing them to take immediate action, an MIT panel said Tuesday.
   Taking only small or partial steps to improve the nation's
competitiveness will doom the United States to steady slippage in
the standard of living, according to the two-year study by
scientists, engineers and economists from Massachusetts Institute
of Technology.
   ``We are indeed in serious trouble with respect to our
industrial performance,'' Michael L. Dertouzos, chairman of MIT's
Commission on Industrial Productivity, told a news conference.
   Unless something is done, he said, ``The nation will become
progressively more impoverished in relative terms.''
   The authors of the study, ``Made In America,'' were scheduled to
testify on their findings Wednesday in Washington before the Senate
Committee on Labor and Human Resources, headed by Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass.
   Restoring U.S. competitiveness demands grass-roots changes by
companies, unions, schools and workers, the study said.
   While government has a role to play, changes that come from the
bottom up are essential to improving the nation's lagging rate of
productivity growth, it said.
   ``To live well, a nation must produce well,'' says the lead
sentence in the study, released as a 344-page hardcover book.
   Among the three principal authors is Robert Solow, who won the
1987 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science and is vice chairman
of MIT's Commission on Industrial Productivity.
   The others are Dertouzos, a professor of electrical engineering
and computer science, and Richard K. Lester, executive director of
the commission and an associate professor of nuclear engineering.
   The study says that if the right steps are taken, ``this nation
has every chance of entering the 21st century displaying the same
dynamism that characterized its industrial performance throughout
much of the present century.''
   The MIT study differs from many others in that it does not focus
on such economic issues as the high cost of capital in the United
States and the shortage of national savings.
   Instead, it focuses on what it calls an excessive concern with
short-term profits; outdated corporate strategies that focus too
much on mass production and the domestic American market; and lack
of cooperation within and among U.S. companies.
   It also puts the blame on neglect of people, technological
failures in translating discoveries into products and unwise public
policies.
   Companies that are doing well today often are ones that have
started from scratch or come through crises, the authors said.
   They cited Xerox Corp., which fought back after losing most of
the world copier market in the 1970s and early 1980s, and Ford
Motor Co., which has rebounded to become the nation's most
profitable automaker after losing $3.3 billion from 1980 through
1982.
   ``The management trick is, can you change before you have a
crisis?'' said Lester Thurow, deal of MIT's Sloan School of
Management. It can be done, he said.
   ``There isn't something magical here that the rest of the
world's got that we haven't got,'' Thurow said.
   For industry, the study's main recommendation is to focus on
steady, continuous improvements in the production process.
   To hurry things along, companies should begin working on
designing products and the processes for making them before the
research and development is even complete, the study says.
   Suppliers should be treated as allies rather than adversaries,
the study says. Because the economy is becoming global, American
managers should know more about foreign cultures and ways of doing
business, it says.
   Labor representatives should be accepted as ``legitimate and
valued partners in the innovation process,'' the report states.
   But it also says traditional labor-union stands on work rules,
job security and compensation need to be reconsidered.
   For government, it recommends taking steps to raise private
savings and cut the federal budget deficit; opening foreign
markets; making labor laws more flexible; supporting research and
development; and making military spending more efficient.
   It also recommends laws to restrict borrowing for corporate
takeovers and buyouts.
   On education, it says government should get schools to promote
``technological literacy'' and encourage companies to do more
on-the-job education and training.
   The study acknowledges that many companies are too small to do
extensive education and training, while others are afraid that
employees will quit and take their newly acquired skills elsewhere.

   Better on-the-job training, even more than
better schools, holds the key to helping U.S. workers catch up to
the Japanese and others in productivity, concluded an MIT report
released Tuesday.
   ``Young Americans receive most of their job skills in
institutions of formal learning, and what they pick up on the job
is usually of a limited nature, gathered from watching a
colleague,'' said the report, ``Made in America.''
   Japanese and West German corporations invest far more than most
U.S. firms in training and retraining workers over a lifetime. The
payoff, said the study, is a workforce prepared and flexible enough
to adapt to changing styles and technologies.
   U.S. firms such as International Business Machines Corp.,
Digital Equipment Corp. and Chaparral Industries Inc. do provide
effective training, the report said. But many small and
medium-sized companies feel they can't afford to establish
extensive training programs. Or they are concerned that if they do,
they'd lose their investment when workers transfer to other
companies.
   Changing this ``would require a kind of national political
leadership that has not yet appeared,'' the report said.
   The two-year study was produced by a 16-member MIT Commission on
Industrial Productivity.
   The 344-page report's principal authors were Michael L.
Dertouzos, professor of engineering and computer science, Richard
K. Lester, associate professor of nuclear engineering, and Robert
M. Solow, professor of economics and Nobel laureate in economics.
   Neglect of human resources may be the United States' biggest
failing, Dertouzos said at a news conference on the report.
   While critical of U.S. public schools and vocational schools for
turning out children ill-equipped in math, science and other
disciplines, the report said school reform is only a first step
toward a more productive workforce.
   ``Even if American schools were to be improved, there are
reasons to believe that learning work skills on the job might be
preferable to learning them in schools,'' the report argued.
   Skills developed on the job tend to be broader, more flexible
and more relevant to the future needs of the corporation. Such
skills are general enough so that they can be useful even if the
worker switches jobs.
   West Germany, for example, offers young workers apprenticeships
in 400 occupations. The apprentice, usually 16 years old, spends an
average of three years working in a firm under a supervisor. The
training curriculum is negotiated with government, employers'
associations and trade unions.
   In Japan, workers rotate between research, manufacturing, sales
and other areas. They spend several days a year in corporate
training centers and are also encouraged to take correspondence
courses.
   The report disputed the notion that U.S. workers are being
outdone by foreign competitors because of a decline in the work
ethic.
   ``The issue is not what workers will do when motivated but
rather what they can do, given their weaker basic education and the
kind of work experiences provided by companies that have low regard
for training and few institutional resources to provide it,'' it
said.

   Share prices closed lower on the London stock
exchange Tuesday as renewed inflationary fears and light buying
interest after a long holiday weekend combined to undo some of the
gains the market made last week.
   The trading session was one of the quietest since early January,
with volume amounting to 333.9 million shares.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 index closed 14.9 points,
or 0.7 percent, lower at 2,103.2, the day's lowest level but just
above the psychologically important 2,100 point barrier.
   The Financial Times 30-share index closed at 1,736.3, down 14.1.
   The Financial Times 500-share index finished at 1,195.76, down
7.42.
   Dealers said the market was upset by renewed fears of an upward
drift in world interest rates, with much of the concern stemming
from Monday's release of a survey of U.S. purchasing managers which
pointed to still-buoyant growth in April.
   Those fears had receded last week, pushing the FT-SE 100 over 50
points higher during the five days.
   As well as international pressures, the British government may
also be forced to raise interest rates again for domestic reasons,
dealers said, especiallly if the pound comes under renewed downward
pressure.

   Prices edged higher in dull trading on Wall

chose to await unemployment figures scheduled for release on Friday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 3.66 to 2,418.62
as of 2 p.m. EDT.
   Advancing issues were ahead of decliners by a margin of about 4

   Volume on the Big Board came to 117.36 million shares by
midafternoon.
   ``It hasn't done much of anything today,'' said Jack Barbanel, a
market analyst with Gruntal &amp; Co. ``There was some support from
program traders, but the market by itself doesn't have enough
momentum.''
   The government reported today that sales of new homes fell 5.5
percent in March and that orders to U.S. factories rose 0.7 percent
last month. But Barbanel said the statistics also had little effect
on trading.
   He said the market was unlikely to move with any conviction

<HEAD>Bergner Is Inclined To Keep Headquarters In Milwaukee</HEAD>

   The head of P.A. Bergner &amp; Co. said Tuesday he
is inclined to keep the department store company's headquarters in
Milwaukee after acquiring Chicago-based Carson Pirie Scott &amp; Co.
   Bergner and Carson announced the $453 million merger Monday,
which would create one of the Midwest's largest retail chains.
   ``We have always had ambitions of being a major player in the
Chicago market,'' Alan Anderson, chairman and chief executive
officer of Bergner, said at a news conference Tuesday.
   The combined companies will control more than 60 stores in
Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota and Iowa, and they will
have a single headquarters, Anderson said.
   ``We are inclined to leave the headquarters in Milwaukee,'' he
said. ``However, before we make a final decision, we will see if
there are significant business reasons for changing our position.''
   Bergner moved its headquarters from Peoria, Ill., to Milwaukee
when the company bought the Boston Store chain, which operates in
Wisconsin.
   But Anderson said officials made that decision because they felt
they needed to be more attuned to the Milwaukee market. Anderson
said Bergner already operates stores in the Chicago area, and ``we
know the market there.''
   Officials said the merger would have little effect on the
individual stores, which will retain their names.
   Anderson described the merger with Carson as an ``outstanding
fit,'' because the two retail companies cater to similar customers
and because their markets are adjacent to each other.
   ``This isn't like buying a chain spread out across the U.S.,''
said John Landschulz, a retail analyst with the Chicago brokerage
firm of Cowen &amp; Co.
   The two chains overlap only in one shopping center, at Randhurst
outside Chicago, and Anderson said no immediate decision has been
made on whether to close one of the stores.
   Anderson said, however, Bergner will sell off Carson's specialty
store operations, which include 391 County Seat casual wear stores
and 23 Arcadia novelty shops.
   ``We are a department store operator,'' Anderson said. ``That's
the business we know.''
   Bergner, owned by the Maus and Nordmann families of Switzerland,
had sales of $470 million last year. Carson had sales of $1.02
billion in 1988.
   Anderson estimated the merger would bring about $300 million in
debt to Bergner, but part of that money would be paid off through
the sale of the specialty stores.

<HEAD>Chrysler Up; Big Three Set 1st-Quarter Earnings Record</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp.'s first-quarter earnings rose 91
percent from last year's depressed level, pushing profits for the
Big Three to a quarterly record, according to figures released
Tuesday.
   Chrysler said it earned $351 million, or $1.50 a share, during
the first three months of the year, compared with $183.7 million,
or 83 cents a share, during the same time last year. Revenue rose
16 percent to $9.95 billion from $8.56 billion.
   The earnings benefited by comparison with last year, when the
No.3 automaker closed a number of its Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary
plants. Those closings cut profits by $93 million, or 42 cents a
share.
   Without the reduction last year, Chrysler's first-quarter
profits would have been 26.7 percent higher. The company's profits
came on revenues of $9.95 billion this year, up 16.3 percent from
its first-quarter revenues last year.
   Late last month, General Motors Corp. reported it made $1.55
billion and Ford Motor Co. said it earned $1.64 billion, bringing
the Big Three profits during the quarter to $3.54 billion. That's
the best first quarter on record, topping the first period of 1984,
when the companies made $3.22 billion.
   Analyst Joseph Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Hutton of New York
said some of Chrysler's increase came because of lower incentive
costs during the period this year.
   In the past, Chrysler has used incentives liberally to entice
buyers. In very late March and early April, each of the Big Three
introduced new incentive packages, with cash rebates and low _ or
in Chrysler's case no _ financing charges on some loans.
   Much of the cost of the new incentive packages, which have given
a boost to car and truck sales, will be charged against
second-quarter profits.
   ``They're talking (a cost of) $800 per car versus $600 in the
first quarter,'' Phillippi said Tuesday.
   Chrysler's incentive package runs indefinitely, Ford's expires
May 31 and GM's runs out June 5.
   Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca said the company benefited from
sales of the Dodge Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim, which replaced its
K-series compact cars, and in its more-expensive models. Also
during the quarter, Chrysler began two shifts of production at its
Newark, Del., plant, which makes the Spirit-Acclaim line.
   Iacocca also said Chrysler is holding its share of the
sport-utility market, through its Jeep line, and in the minivan
segment, where the company commands better than 50 percent of the
sales.
   ``Jeeps and minivans, that's the money pump,'' Phillippi said.
   Meantime, Chrysler Financial Corp., the automaker's financing
arm, said it earned $65 million during the first quarter, the same
as the first three months of last year.
   The subsidiary's automotive lending operations, Chrysler Credit,
reported the number of new and used vehicles it financed rose 11.4
percent during the first quarter from the same period last year.

   The U.S. dollar rose against most major currencies
in slow European trading Tuesday after the May Day holiday on
Monday. Gold prices were lower.
   Foreign-exchange dealers said the dollar was well supported
despite the lack of news to influence exchange rates. They said the
dollar held steady despite intervention by the U.S. and Canadian
central banks and most European central banks, which sold dollars
to drive down the currency's value.
   There were plenty of buyers around to snap up the offered U.S.
currency, the dealers said.
   Trading was slack because most markets will close again Thursday
for Ascension Day.
   One dealer in Frankfurt, West Germany, attributed the dollar's
strength to the weakness of the West German mark, the relatively
strong performance of President Bush in his first 100 days in
office and the steady course of the U.S. economy.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6845 late Tuesday,
unchanged from late Friday.
   Other late rates for the dollar compared with late rates last
Friday: 1.8875 West German marks, up from 1.8805; 1.6805 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6742; 6.3735 French francs, up from 6.3650;
2.1270 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1220; 1,379.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,377.50; and 1.1830 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1835.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 133.85 Japanese yen, up
from 132.49 yen late Friday. In London late Tuesday the dollar
traded higher at 133.82 yen.
   The late bid price for gold in London, the major market, was
$377.50 a troy ounce, down from $378.25 late Friday. The late bid
price in Zurich, Switzerland, was $377.30, down from $377.75.
   Earlier in Hong Kong gold closed at $375.75 bid, down from
$381.85 last Friday.
   Silver bullion went slightly against the trend, trading late in
London at $5.65 bid a troy ounce, up from $5.63.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders reacted to
short-term weather forecasts calling for above-average rainfall.
   Wheat prices rose in anticipation of an announcement by the Bush
administration on whether there will be additional subsidized grain
sales to the Soviet Union.
   Wheat prices also were helped by word that the condition of the
red winter wheat crop in Kansas and Oklahoma has deteriorated
further.
   ``There was light volume,'' said Steve Freed, an analyst with
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. ``The market is nervous about
the weather.''
   Lower soybean and corn prices followed the release of the
National Weather Service's 6- to 10-day forecast for
wetter-than-normal conditions next week in the Midwest and the
Central Plains.
   Soybean prices also were forced down by the selling of soybeans
by farmers taking advantage of Monday's rise in soybean futures
prices, said Jerry Gidel, an analyst with LIT America Inc. in
Chicago.
   At the close, wheat was 1{ cents to 3{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.26{ a bushel; corn was 1 cent to
2} cents lower with May at $2.73{ a bushel; oats were \ cent to 3

<HEAD>Polaroid Chief Says Kodak Competition Would Have Taken `Bread and
Butter'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polaroid Corp. took pains to avoid competition
with Eastman Kodak Co., the chairman testified Tuesday in the
opening of testimony in a trial over damages Kodak should pay for
infringing on its rival's instant-photography technology.
   In the first day of testimony in U.S. District Court, Polaroid
Chairman William J. McCune Jr. began to outline the steps that led
to head-to-head competition with Kodak.
   Polaroid, based in Cambridge, Mass., is seeking $12 billion in
damages from Kodak for infringing on instant photography patents.
An earlier court decision found infringement occurred.
   Rochester, N.Y.-based Kodak says it should pay $177 million,
equal to 5 percent royalties on the instant cameras and film Kodak
sold from 1976 until 1985.
   McCune said Polaroid and Kodk had a productive working
relationship for decades. But things soured in the late 1960s, he
said, when Polaroid was working on its revolutionary SX-70 camera.
   Kodak, which for years had manufactured film for Polaroid, was
asked to produce the new, complex negative that Polaroid had
developed for the instant, color camera. But Kodak demanded a
license from Polaroid, McCune testified, which would have allowed
Kodak to develop its own instant photography.
   ``There was considerable reluctance to undertake the project
unless we gave them license,'' McCune said under questioning by
Polaroid attorney Herbert Schwartz. ``A stumbling block was always
that we couldn't see how giving Kodak a license to make products
competitive with ours would allow us to stay in business.''
   Polaroid ultimately built its own film manufacturing facilities
in Massachusetts.
   Instant photography, McCune said, ``is all our bread and butter
and that's everything we've got.''
   McCune's testimony before Judge A. David Mazzone ranged widely
from the origins of instant photography after World War II to the
introduction of the SX-70 camera in 1972.
   The story began during the war, McCune said, when Polaroid
founder Edwin Land was in Santa Fe on a family trip. ``He took
photographs of his daughter and she asked why she couldn't see it
right away,'' McCune said. ``He wondered too.''
   By 1963, with manufacturing help from Kodak, Polaroid developed
the first color instant photography.
   ``The business grew rapidly in that period,'' McCune said.
Revenue of $129 million in 1963 jumped to $571 million in 1972.
Polaroid's profits after taxes increased from $25 million to $75
million in that time.
   With the introduction of the SX-70, McCune said, Polaroid hoped
for a dramatic increase in its business.
   ``We viewed it as a revolutionary step and thought it was going
to dramatically increase the business of the company and increase
the life of the business,'' McCune said.
   But as Polaroid's lawyers have already argued, Kodak's
competition beginning in 1976 cut into profits and forced Polaroid
to sell some cameras below cost.
   If Mazzone awards Polaroid anything close to $12 billion, it
will be the largest patent infringement decision in history, far
surpassing the record $207 million that Smith International Inc.
was ordered to pay Hughes Tool Co. three years ago for copying
drill bit technology.

   The government reported Tuesday that orders to
U.S. factories for manufactured goods increased 0.7 percent in
March, but analysts still saw signs in the report that the economy
was cooling off.
   Orders for durable and non-durable goods rose to a seasonally
adjusted $232.9 billion in March after dropping 2 percent in
February and 1.2 percent in January, the Commerce Department
reported.
   The gain last month was propelled by a big jump in
transportation orders, which surged 10.1 percent on the strength of
a 48.3 percent increase in orders for aircraft, missiles and parts.
   Excluding transportation, a category that is subject to wide
swings depending on when big contracts are signed, all other orders
were down 0.9 percent in March after declining 1 percent in
February.
   Analysts said the report added to signs that economic growth is
slackening, but also demonstrated the economy still has some
strength left.
   ``I don't think the economy is as weak as some of the recent
signs have been showing,'' said economist John Hagens of the Wefa
Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. ``Calling it a full-fledged slowdown
right now is a little bit premature.''
   Hagens said that with aircraft manufacturers already holding big
backlogs of unfilled orders, the latest surge in orders in that
category was unlikely to have much immediate effect on economic
activity.
   He said the report showed some strength in orders for computers
and other equipment, while demand in construction-related
industries remained weak.
   Orders in the volatile defense category, which overlaps
transportation, also showed strength in March, rising 28.8 percent
after an increase of 19.7 percent in February.
   Excluding defense, all other orders in March were down 0.3
percent after falling 2.7 percent in February.
   Economist Robert DeFina of Security Pacific National Bank in Los
Angeles said the report was consistent with other recent signs that
the economy may be slowing down, noting that orders for non-defense
capital goods have fluctuated in recent months and that factory
shipments were down in March as backlogs of unfilled orders
increased.
   ``They all seem to fit in with this picture of a slowing
economy,'' he said.
   However, economist Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc. in New York said that while orders last quarter
were slower than during the strong fourth quarter of 1988,
manufacturing still shows enough strength that inflationary
pressures could mount.
   ``There's a little bit of a slowdown that's not worth a lot,''
Brusca said. ``I would still be concerned about the risks of
inflation here much more than the risk of recession.''
   The Commerce Department gave these details on factory orders in
March:
   _Orders for non-defense capital goods, considered a barometer of
business investment plans, were up 2.4 percent in March after
falling 7.8 percent in February and rising 2.3 percent in January.
   _Boosted by the strong demand for aircraft, orders for ``big
ticket'' durable goods were up 0.9 percent in March to a seasonally
adjusted $125.2 billion after falling in the previous two months.
Excluding aircraft, durable goods orders declined 3.6 percent.
   _Orders for non-durable goods were up 0.5 percent in March to a
seasonally adjusted $107.7 billion after dropping 0.4 percent in
February.
   _Shipments of manufactured goods declined 0.1 percent in March
to a seasonally adjusted $228.1 billion, after falling 1.4 percent
in February.

   Walt Disney Co.'s profit rose 24 percent
in the second quarter of its fiscal year, thanks to free-spending
visitors at the company's amusement parks.
   Disney reported Tuesday it earned $149 million, or $1.08 a
share, up from $120.1 million, or 87 cents a share, in the second
quarter of its 1989 fiscal year. Sales in the quarter ended March
31 were $1.04 billion, up 14 percent from $774.5 million a year
earlier.
   Operating income from theme parks, which account for the lion's
share of Disney business, rose 43 percent in the latest quarter
because of higher per-capita guest spending, strong attendance and
improved resort operations, the company said. A new studio tour
opened at Walt Disney World in Florida this week.
   Operating income in the filmed entertainment division was 21
percent lower than in the comparable quarter last year, when money
was rolling in from the hit movies ``Three Men and a Baby'' and
``Good Morning, Vietnam.'' Revenue from filmed entertainment was 28
percent higher than a year ago.
   The consumer products division, which includes a growing chain
of shops selling Disney toys and clothes, recorded a 32 percent
rise in operating income.
   In the first half of Disney's 1989 fiscal year, profit was
$297.3 million, or $2.16 a share, up 35 percent from $220.6
million, or $1.61 a share, in the first half of last year. Sales
for the half were $2.08 billion, up from $1.51 billion a year
earlier.

Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, lost 86
cents to settle at $19.80 a barrel, after rising 24 cents on Monday.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the
June contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline settled 1.36 cents
lower to 71.25 cents a gallon. The contract had risen 1.39 cents in
the previous session.
   June home heating oil, which declined 0.31 cent Monday, fell
another 1.85 cents Tuesday to 47.61 cents a gallon.
   John H. O'Connell, an energy analyst at Refco Inc., said
profit-taking from the recent jump in crude and gasoline prices and
concerns about OPEC overproduction largely were responsible for
Tuesday's selloff.
   ``There's a growing belief that OPEC is producing 22 million
barrels'' daily, he said.
   The 13-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
agreed last year to a daily production level of 18.5 million
barrels for the first half of 1989.
   Quotas for the second half of the year are expected to be
discussed at a June OPEC meeting and analysts predict cartel
members will seek to expand production in light of the recent price
runup.
   Adding to the market slump Tuesday was speculation that the
transportation and production system in the North Sea would resume
operations next week following an April 18 explosion at a gasoline
platform that disrupted operations, analysts said.
   The North Sea accident and the Exxon oil spill off the Alaskan
coast in March have helped to significantly boost oil prices,
particularly gasoline and crude.

<HEAD>Sales Up, Profits Down at Eastman Kodak</HEAD>

   Despite record sales, Eastman Kodak Co.'s
fiscal first-quarter profit fell 23 percent due to costs associated
with last year's purchase of Sterling Drug Co.
   The announcement caught many stock analysts by surprise and sent
the photo giant's stock tumbling on the New York Stock Exchange,
where it closed down $3.12{ a share to $43.75.
   ``I was looking for an unimpressive quarter, but these numbers
are definitely lower than I and most everyone else anticipated,''
said Mark Obenzinger, an analyst for Wood, Gundy &amp; Co.
   For the quarter, which ended March 19, the company reported a
profit of $200 million, or 62 cents a share, compared with $260
million, or 80 cents a share, for the same period a year ago.
   Sales for the quarter totaled a record $3.9 billion, up 17
percent from last year when they were $3.3 billion.
   The earnings decline was largely a result of adding in three
months, instead of one month, of costs and interest expense for
Sterling Drug, which Kodak bought last February for $5.1 billion.
   ``That's a major difference,'' said Kodak spokesman Ron Roberts.
   For example, interest expenses in last year's first quarter
totaled $92 million. This year they were $192 million. Marketing
and administrative costs were $869 million. In this year's initial
quarter, they climbed $206 million, to $1.07 billion.
   Roberts also said less favorable currency-exchange rates and the
general cost of inflation contributed to higher costs for Kodak.
   However, Roberts noted that last year's first quarter was the
best in company history and this year's first-quarter earnings are
the third-highest.
   ``The first quarter rarely provides good insight into
performance expectations due to the seasonality of our business,''
said Colby Chandler, Kodak's chairman and chief executive officer.
   The first three months of the year are generally Kodak's slowest
time because people do not take as many pictures as they do in the
spring, summer and fall.
   Chandler said he still predicts the company will achieve record
earnings this year, but it's not going to be easy.

   International Business Machines Corp. said
Tuesday it will offer a system that can identify incoming phone
calls and get information about the callers out of the computer.
   Other companies such as American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
already offer such caller-identification systems, but IBM has an
advantage in the market because of its close ties to potential
customers, a consultant said.
   Typical customers for such systems are stock brokerages and
companies that handle ordering and billing over the phone. With the
system, someone who takes a call simultaneously gets a screen full
of information about the customer's account.
   Similarly, a company could list one number in the phone book and
then route calls automatically to the closest office.
   In addition to CallPath, IBM also announced at a Dallas trade
show new controllers that serve as go-betweens for mainframe
computers and desktop terminals.
   IBM is so familiar with its customers that it can custom-tailor
CallPath to their needs better than other companies can, said
Francis McInerney, senior analyst at Northern Business
Information-Datapro in New York.
   IBM's long-range goal is to get a large portion of its revenue
from helping customers assemble customized information systems,
McInerney said. CallPath will help by creating a standard platform
to build on, he said.

   Prices dipped lower in dull and directionless
trading on Wall Street Tuesday as many investors stayed on the
sidelines, playing it safe in advance of Friday's unemployment
report.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 12.10 to 2,402.86,
but most of the plunge was attributed to a 3\-point drop in the
stock of Eastman Kodak, one of the average's components. Kodak
closed at 43~ after announcing a disappointing drop in its
first-quarter earnings.
   Declining issues barely outnumbered advancing ones in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 720 issues
rising, 729 falling and 530 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 172.56 million
shares, up from 138.05 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 205.4 million shares.
   Prices moved in a narrow range for much of the day. Alfred E.
Goldman, a market analyst with A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St.
Louis, described Tuesday's session as ``basically a dull day
correcting a market that had a big run-up'' and that helped relieve
the market's overbought condition.
   Goldman said the market's upward trend essentially remained
intact.
   The government reported that sales of new homes fell 5.5 percent
in March and that orders to U.S. factories rose 0.7 percent last
month. But analysts said the statistics had little effect on
trading.
   Goldman said many traders stayed out of the market, preferring
to see what Friday's Labor Department report on April employment
would hold. If the report indicates a surging economy, fears of
continued interest rate hikes could send stock prices lower.
   However, Goldman predicted, ``That figure will not really change
anybody's mind. The economy's not coming unglued and it's not
picking up steam.''
   Union Carbide was the most active issue on the NYSE Tuesday,
falling [ to 31\.
   Pepsico, which announced a favorable earnings report, rose 1[ to
49]. Boeing, which said it had more than $400 million in new
contracts, picked up 1\ to close at 78].
   Ogilvy Group, which soared more than $17 Monday after WPP Group
PLC proposed a $730 million buyout of the advertising concern, was
up a more modest | to 49} in over-the-counter trading.
   Another over-the-counter issue, R.P. Scherer, fell 3[ to 30\
after a Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. unit agreed to acquire
the gelatin capsule manufacturer.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market fell $5.990 billion, or 0.20
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped 0.45 to 172.37.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 1.16 to 354.61, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index declined 1.00 to 308.12.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
0.56 to 428.03. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 344.66, down 0.62.

<HEAD>Dollar Ends Mixed; Gold Weakens Slightly</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished higher against several key
currencies Tuesday, defying central bank attempts to dilute its
value through coordinated selling on foreign-exchange markets.
   Gold weakened slightly. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted bullion at $376.35 a troy ounce, down from $377.45 Monday.
   Currency strategists said the dollar's behavior reflected a big
underlying demand for the currency, a consequence of what they
called the resiliently strong U.S. economy and relatively high
American interest rates that make dollar-denominated investments
more attractive.
   They also attributed some of the dollar's strength to pent-up
orders for the currency overseas, where many markets were closed
Monday for the May Day labor holiday.
   The dollar fell early in the day when the Federal Reserve and
central banks in other key U.S. trading partners sold dollars to
blunt the currency's appreciation.
   But when traders realized why the dollar was falling, they
started buying it aggressively and the dollar rose again, finishing
higher against the yen, mark and French franc and nearly unchanged
vs. the British pound and a few other important currencies.
   ``The sentiment is definitely continuing to be bullish,'' said
Scott Greene, a senior dealer at the New York branch of
Switzerland's Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co. ``Unless the intervention gets
more serious, traders will just see it as an excuse to buy cheap
dollars.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 133.85 Japanese yen, up from
132.49 yen the previous session. In London, the dollar traded at
133.82 yen. Later in New York the dollar fetched 134.27 yen, up
from 134.13 yen the previous session.
   The pound cost $1.6845 in London late Tuesday, unchanged from
the previous session. In New York sterling rose slightly, fetching
$1.6806 vs. $1.6798.
   Other late-dollar rates in New York vs. late Monday: 1.8919
marks, up from 1.8907; 1.6842 Swiss francs, down from 1.6870;
1.1812 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1872; 6.3950 French francs, up
from 6.3900; 1,383.25 Italian lire, unchanged.
   Other late rates for the dollar in London vs. rates Friday, the
previous trading session: 1.8875 marks, up from 1.8805; 1.6805
Swiss francs, up from 1.6742; 6.3735 French francs, up from 6.3650;
2.1270 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1220; 1,379.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,377.50; and 1.1830 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1835.
   Gold weakened slightly in U.S. and European markets after a
bigger decline in Asia. On the New York Commodity Exchange gold for
current delivery fell 40 cents a troy ounce to $377.80. In London
it fell 75 cents to $377.50 and in Zurich it fell 45 cents to
$377.30. In Hong Kong it fell $6.10 to $375.75.
   Silver bullion in London resisted the trend, trading at $5.65,
up from $5.63. On the New York Comex, silver for current delivery
fell 2.9 cents a troy ounce to $5.617.

<HEAD>Sharp Drop in Energy Futures Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Petroleum futures prices dropped sharply Tuesday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange as traders reacted to reports that OPEC nations
are exceeding their production limits.
   In other markets, grain and soybean prices dropped; precious
metals closed lower on light trading, and livestock and pork prices
rallied.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 35 cents to 89 cents
lower with the contract for delivery in June at $19.80 a barrel;
heating oil was 1.19 cents to 1.85 cents lower with June at 47.61
cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .42 cent to 1.36 cents lower
with June at 7.25 cents a gallon.
   ``It was a bloodbath,'' said Jerry Samuels, an analyst with
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Prices dropped in active trading as traders who bought on the
assumption prices would go up liquidated their holdings as the
market broke the $20.50 barrier.
   ``There was no fresh news that would warrant such a move down,''
said Samuels. ``There is continued concern from OPEC
overproduction.''
   Word was that in April, Saudi Arabia surpassed its production
limit of 4.5 million barrels a day, with daily production reaching
4.9 million barrels to 5 million barrels.
   ``That is not so much, but there are reports the Kuwaitis _ who
have a million barrels per day limit _ produced 1.7 million barrels
daily,'' Samuels said.
   Gasoline futures were forced down by the selling of crude oil
futures, but overall, prices remain steady, said Samuels, adding
the fall in gasoline prices is likely to be more temporary than the
drop in crude oil and heating oil.
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly lower on the
Chicago Board of Trade as traders reacted to short-term weather
forecasts calling for above-average rainfall.
   Wheat prices rose in anticipation of an announcement by the Bush
administration on additional subsidized grain sales to the Soviet
Union.
   After the close of trading, the White House announced the sale
of 1.5 million metric tons of wheat to the Soviets under the export
bonus program. The wheat is for delivery in May and June.
   Wheat prices also were helped by word that the condition of the
red winter wheat crop in Kansas and Oklahoma has deteriorated
further.
   ``There was light volume,'' said Steve Freed an analyst with
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. ``The market is nervous about
the weather.''
   Lower soybean and corn prices followed the release of the
National Weather Service's 6- to 10-day forecast for
wetter-than-normal conditions next week in the Midwest and the
Central Plains.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 3 cents higher with the contract for
delivery in May at $4.26{ a bushel; corn was { cent to 2{ cents
lower with May at $2.73{ a bushel; oats were a \ cent to 3 cents
lower with May at $1.84\ a bushel; soybeans were 1\ cent to 5 cents
lower with May at $7.34 a bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange with prices buoyed by better than expected cash prices.
   ``Traders hadn't expected it to be so strong,'' said Tom Morgan
of Sterling Research Corp. of Arlington Heights, Ill.
   Pork prices were helped by a Commerce Department ruling that
Canada was subsidizing pork exports and that may prompt the United
States to impose duties on Canadian pork products.
   Live cattle settled .18 cent to .60 cent higher with June at
72.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle was .30 cent to .65 cent higher
with May at 76.72 cents a pound; hogs were .08 cent to .62 cent
higher with June at 47.42 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.10 cent to .88 cent higher with May at 31.75 cents a pound.
   Gold and silver futures prices dropped in sluggish trading on
New York's Commodities Exchange.
   ``There is a lot of gold and a lot of silver around, and there's
not a lot of reasons to buy,'' said David Syphen, an analyst with
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York.
   Gold settled 40 cents to $1.70 lower, with May at $377.80 a troy
ounce; silver was 2.9 cents to 3.2 cents lower with May at $5.617 a
troy ounce.

<HEAD>Texas Air Reports Quarterly Loss Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp., the nation's largest airline
company, said Tuesday it lost $255.5 million for the first quarter
of 1989, most of which was attributed to strikebound Eastern
Airlines.
   The holding company's loss for the three-month period came on
revenue of $1.9 billion and contrasted with a loss of $124.3
million on revenue of $2.2 billion during the same three months in
1988.
   Texas Air owns Miami-based Eastern and Houston-based Continental
Airlines as well as System One Holdings, an airline reservation
system.
   Eastern has been in bankruptcy protection from creditors since
March 9, five days after the start of a bruising strike by its
Machinists union that was supported by pilots and flight attendants.
   Miami-based Eastern by itself recorded a loss of $255.2 million
on revenues of $620.6 million before a $10.4 million charge for
dividends payable to its preferred stockholders. During the first
quarter of 1988, Eastern had a loss of $31 million on revenues of
$1.1 billion before a $14.1 million charge for dividends payable to
its preferred stockholders.
   Eastern virtually shut down operations March 4 when its
machinists went on strike and its pilots and flight attendants
honored the picket lines.
   Phil Bakes, Eastern's president and chief executive, said in a
statement that ``while further substantial operating losses should
be expected for the second quarter, the company's business plan
which was recently submitted to our creditors and 5,000 working
employees shows dramatic future improvements.
   ``Additionally, cash resources will increase dramatically as a
result of the planned disposition of certain assets that will allow
us to pay down substantial amount of debt, satisfy all bankruptcy
liabilities and finish the year with substantial cash resources.''
   Bakes said the airline's cash resources will increase
``dramatically'' from Eastern's new plan to rebuild as a smaller
carrier and sell $1.8 billion in assets separately.
   All such sales must be approved by a federal bankruptcy court in
New York. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland has called a
hearing for Wednesday on the issue of auctioning Eastern in its
entirety, including its Northeast shuttle service slated to be sold
to developer Donald Trump for $365 million.
   Continental posted a first-quarter loss of $16.5 million on
revenues of $1.2 billion compared with a net loss of $80.6 million
on revenue of $1.1 billion for the first quarter of 1988.
   The losses at Eastern and Continental were partly offset by
profits of other units that do not individually report their
results, including System One Holdings, Texas Air said.

   Sun Exploration and Production Co. said
Tuesday it was changing its name to Oryx Energy Co. to reflect its
independence from Sun Co. Inc., from which it was spun off in
November.
   Oryx is named after a large antelope that has long, straight
horns that sweep backward. The name change was approved by
shareholders Tuesday and takes effect Wednesday.
   Oryx could spend as much as $2 billion to expand its holdings
internationally, Chairman Robert Hauptfuhrer told reporters.
   He indicated the company is looking mainly at possible joint
ventures in the North Sea, Southeast Asia, Africa and South
America. He said political policy and government turmoil in other
areas, especially the Middle East, make acquisitions there unlikely.
   Oryx has $4 billion in assets. It was created when Radnor,
Pa.-based Sun decided to spin off its exploration and production
business, and concentrate on refining and retailing. Sun remains a
large, mainly regional, refinery, distributing its products mainly
under the Sunoco brand name.
   Also Tuesday, Oryx announced the creation of a leveraged
employee stock ownership plan with initial funding form a $110
million, 20-year private placement of debt.

   Sheldon Coleman announced Tuesday he has
been fired as president and chief executive of Coleman Co., the
maker of Coleman lanterns and other outdoor products that was
founded by his grandfather.
   Coleman said Wall Street takeover strategist Ron Perelman, who
bought the company six weeks ago, terminated him during a meeting
Monday night in Houston. Coleman said the decision was reaffirmed
Tuesday.
   Perelman and his staff had said they wanted Coleman to stay on
as chief executive officer. Perelman probably is best known for his
1985 purchase for $1.8 billion of the Revlon Group Inc. and his
acquisition of five failing savings and loans in Texas, a move that
gave him significant tax advantages.
   At a news conference, Coleman, 36, said he was told Monday he
and Perelman's acquisition corporation should part company because
he ``didn't respond enthusiastically enough or quickly enough to
some of their suggestions'' about his possible role on the new
management team.
   Coleman said each time Perelman's executives, whom he described
as ``extremely intelligent, fast-moving, hard-charging people,''
proposed duties for him, he asked to have some time to consider the
proposal. By the time he was ready to respond in each instance, the
suggested duties had changed, he said.
   ``The roles changed with each meeting we had,'' he said.
   ``I think they have tried to treat me well,'' Coleman said. ``It
is not a happy time for me. I'm extremely sad to be leaving a
company that has been part of our family for 89 years.''
   Coleman said Perelman's newly formed acquistion company, Lantern
Acquisition Corp., hadn't appointed anyone to succeed him.
   Charles McIlwaine, vice president of Coleman Co. corporate
communications, issued a statement saying the corporation's new
owners had decided it was time for a change in top management. The
statement said the company's ``current operating management'' would
be retained and a new chief executive officer would be appointed
soon.
   Coleman's severance package provides him a cash payment of
approximately $250,000.
   His firing leaves only one Coleman relative involved in the
company. Bradford Denning, the grandson of Sheldon Coleman's uncle
Clarence, is controller for O'Brien International in Redmond, Wash.
The Coleman Co. subsidiary makes water skis and sailboards.
   Perelman obtained resignations last week from the Coleman Co.
board of directors, except Sheldon Coleman. Three other Coleman
family members resigned board posts.
   The members of the new transition board all are officers or
directors in MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings Inc., which is wholly
owned by Perelman.
   Sheldon Coleman said Tuesday his future as a board member still
is unresolved.
   Coleman Co. is the world's top manufacturer of outdoor
recreation products. It also makes home heating and air
conditioning equipment. Record sales of $657.9 million and record
earnings of $24.5 million were recorded in 1988.

   The AFL-CIO pledged Tuesday to direct a
nationwide boycott of AT&amp;T if union members strike later this
month. The strategy could cost the long-distance giant millions of
dollars while giving union business to a non-union company.
   The labor federation's governing body approved the plan, which
asks the 14 million members of the AFL-CIO and its affiliated
unions to route their long-distance calls via non-union US Sprint
Communications Co.
   ``You have a choice between a struck company and a non-union
company,'' AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland told reporters after the
first day of the federation's spring meeting.
   ``If you want to make a telephone call, those are your
choices,'' Kirkland said. ``Under those circumstances, you take the
lesser of two evils.''
   By placing calls through Sprint's five-digit access number, the
unions and their members could boycott American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. without permanently changing long-distance carriers
and could easily begin using AT&amp;T again after the end of a work
stoppage.
   Some larger AFL-CIO unions pay as much as $1 million a month in
AT&amp;T bills; labor's total bills amount to at least $100 million
annually, federation officials said.
   The boycott plan was drafted by the Communications Workers of
America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
   Those unions are negotiating with the AT&amp;T but have made little
progress toward resolving substantial differences over wages and
health care.
   Officials of both unions say their talks, which opened the last
week of March, snagged immediately over an AT&amp;T proposal to shift
health care costs to workers by making employees pay 20 percent of
medical bills and by placing caps on lifetime and retiree benefits.
AT&amp;T says its current health care plan, which fully pays medical
expenses, costs $1 billion a year.
   The unions say they also expect major differences with the
company on wages but haven't goten to that because of the health
care debate.
   Contracts for 175,000 union members expire May 27. Long-distance
charges are AT&amp;T's largest income source.
   CWA spokeswoman Francine Zucker said both unions, in the event
of a boycott, would recommend that unions and the members use US
Sprint because GTE owns part of US Sprint and workers at GTE-owned
regional phone companies are represented by unions.
   She said no workers at other long-distance carriers are
represented by unions or have any link to a union-represented
company.
   AT&amp;T officials have criticized the plan, saying the unions could
hurt their members by sending business to competitors.
   But the unions have said they need such options to mount an
effective strike because technology would allow AT&amp;T to continue
long-distance service even if both unions walked off the job.

   Sears, Roebuck and Co. announced Tuesday it is
moving its catalog operations from the landmark downtown Sears
Tower to a company-owned building in north suburban Skokie.
   The move was announced by Michael Bozic, chairman and chief
executive officer of Sears Merchandise Group. Bozic called the
transfer ``a cost-effective move and an opportunity to meet the
catalog organization's needs as a separate business.''
   Bozic said about 650 catalog advertising and merchandising
employees will move to Skokie from Sears Tower between Aug. 1 and
Sept. 15. He said other parts of the catalog organization were
expected to make the move later this year or early in 1990.
   Bozic said the move was unrelated to the planned relocation of
Sears Merchandising Group headquarters and does not indicate any
decision on where those offices will be housed.
   The three-story building in Skokie was built in the 1950s and
has served as the location of a number of Sears offices over the
years, officials said.

<TEXT>
   Allergan Optical and Minnesota Mining &amp;
Manufacturing Co. Tuesday introduced contact lenses that the
companies said pose less health risk to eyes than any extended-wear
soft lenses currently available.
   The Allergan Advent lenses are designed to meet the eye's
critical need for oxygen, the companies said at a New York news
conference.
   The flexible material of the new lens allows virtually the same
amount of oxygen to reach the eye as when no lens is being worn,
the companies said.
   Reduced oxygen has been identified as one of key dangers of
overnight and long-term lens wearing. It can cause abnormal
swelling of the eye's outer coating, the cornea, and lead to
permanent vision-distoring eye damage.
   The Advent lenses, which will be available nationally later this
month, establish a new, fourth category of contact lens, which 3M
and Allergan Optical call Flexible Fluoropolymer. Existing lenses
on the market come under one of three categories: hard, soft or
rigid gas permeable.
   The new lenses also are designed to be more resistant to the
buildup of deposits, making them easier to care for. Deposits can
impair the vision-enhancing properties of lenses, cause discomfort
and possibly eye infections.
   The safety of extended-wear lenses has been the subject of study
and debate in the eye care industry for years.
   Last month Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc., the world's leading maker of
contact lenses, started to advise against keeping in its
extended-wear soft contact lenses for more than a week without
removing and cleaning them.
   Extended-wear lenses, which debuted commercially in 1984,
currently have government approval to be worn continuously for up
to 30 days.
   But the Food and Drug Administraion has said it is reviewing its
policy and the agency is expected to urge contact lens makers to
voluntarily shorten the maximum period for wearing their lenses to
a week.
   Allergan Optical, a maker of lenses and lens-care products and a
division of Allergan Inc., based in Irvine, Calif., has set seven
days as the maximum suggested wearing time for the Advent lenses.
   They are recommended for people who regularly wear lenses for
extended periods or occasionally overnight. The Allergan Advents
are expected to compete directly with disposable lenses, such as
the AcuVue lens made by a division of Johnson &amp; Johnson.
   The Allergan Advents, listed for $70 per lens, will be
manufactured by a unit of 3M.

   A federal judge Tuesday rejected a request to
cut the eight-year sentence of self-styled financial adviser David
Bloom, who admitted diverting $10 million of investors' money to
fund a lavish lifestyle.
   Bloom, 24, of Manhattan, is serving two consecutive four-year
sentences at the Allenwood, Pa., federal prison camp after pleading
guilty to one count each of mail fraud and securities fraud.
   Bloom, who was dubbed the ``Wall Street Whiz Kid,'' by local
newspapers, admitted that money given him to invest by friends and
relatives was spent instead on expensive artwork, luxury cars and
expensive homes.
   He asked U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein, who sentenced
Bloom last December, to reduce the prison term because it was
``harsh'' compared with the sentences of other white collar
criminals and because Bloom is remorseful and undergoing
psychological treatment.
   But Edelstein noted that Bloom made those claims when he was
sentenced and that ``his crime involved cheating friends and
colleagues,'' while other convicted white collar thieves were
charged with ``crimes that, although they involved more money,
involved fraud on the system not particular individuals.''

   Ford Motor Corp. received a ``A'' for the

received overall high marks from a trade magazine Tuesday.
   Automotive Industries, a Chilton Co. publication, gave General
Motors Corp. a B for overall performance, up from a B-minus last
year, and Chrysler received a B minus, up from a C-minus a year ago.
   In assigning the grades in six categories, the magazine
considers a company's change over the previous year rather than
comparing companies.
   Chrysler got the highest mark for quality, an A plus, while GM
got an A and Ford a B plus.
   Chrysler was the only company to get a D in any of the six
areas, receiving the low grade for profit per unit and return on
sales.
   Ford was the only other automaker to get an A plus, receiving
the high mark for U.S. market share and productivity.

<TEXT>
   American Airlines and the Transport Workers Union
reached agreement in principle Tuesday on a contract for the
carrier's 23,000 ground service workers after 2{ weeks of mediation.
   Details of the contract were not released pending agreement on
final language and a vote by the membership.
   A company news release said the agreement was reached after 27
hours of continuous bargaining.
   The release said American Vice President Charles Pasciuto and
TWU International Vice President John Kerrigan ``said the agreement
benefits both the company and the union and will enable American to
continue the growth plan that has made the airline an industry
leader.''
   The mediation was requested after union members turned down
American's $610 million offer.
   The offer included raises of as much as 99 percent for some
workers, but union leaders objected to a two-tier wage scale under
which it takes new hires as long as 12 years to reach top pay. The
union had sought to reduce that to about five years.
   The union also objected to provisions under which employees
would contribute to the company health plan for the first time.
   Airline officials complained that the contract was a victim of
union politics because several locals were in the midst of election
campaigns and candidates used the contract as an issue.
   The four-year pact became amendable on March 1.
   Under federal law, airline contracts do not expire. If the two
sides cannot reach agreement, a mediator is called in to spark
negotiations; if the mediator declares an impasse in the talks,
there is then a 30-day cooling off period. A strike can be called
only after that period expires.
   The TWU represents about 23,000 of American's 67,000 employees.
Its members include the airline's mechanics, bag handlers, ground
crews, stock clerks, guards, meteorologists and aircraft cleaners.
   Also Tuesday, American's parent company, AMR Corp., confirmed it
is on the verge of ordering about 100 new commuter aircraft in a
``several hundred million dollar'' deal.
   The aircraft, seating 30-40 people, would be used for the
company's AMR Eagle Inc. subsidiary that feeds some of its major
hubs.
   Published reports have said the company is leaning toward
Swedish manufacture Saab, although others mentioned as possible
suppliers include Boeing Canada-DeHavilland Division, based near
Toronto, and ATR, a French-Italian company.
   Fort Worth-based AMR is coming off its most profitable year
ever, during which it became the nation's largest carrier. AMR
posted a 1988 profit of $476.8 million, a 140.3 percent increase
from 1987 and 37.9 percent higher than the previous record of
$345.8 million in 1985.
   The company also reported a first-quarter profit of $101
million, a 47.7 percent jump from 1988's first three months.
Operating revenues were $2.45 billion.
   The purchase would be the fourth by American this year. In
March, American announced a $3.09 billion deal with Dutch
manufacturer Fokker for 75 F-100 planes and options for another 75;
and an approximately $2 billion purchase of 25 Boeing 757s and 10
Boeing 767s.
   On Feb. 7, American announced another $7 billion deal to buy
eight McDonnell Douglas Corp. jets with options for another 142.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Transportation Department gave final
approval Tuesday to Federal Express Corp.'s takeover of the Flying
Tigers air cargo service on the condition that Federal give up its
U.S.-Japan small package service.
   Approval came after the White House indicated it would not
object to the acquisition, according to documents filed by the
department. The Justice Department earlier said it would not oppose
the $880 million deal announced in December 1988 by both companies.
   The acquisition gives Memphis, Tenn.-based Federal Express a
foothold in the international air cargo business.
   The department order considered several objections from other
air freight companies.
   It transfers the foreign certificate authorities of The Flying
Tiger Line Inc., also known as Flying Tigers, to Federal Express,
provided that Federal surrenders its certificate for small package
service between the United States and Japan, effective with the
start of service by a replacement carrier.
   The new certificates are issued both in the names of Flying
Tigers and Federal Express, giving the company the option of
operating under either name.
   Federal Express, which serves the United States with 104 cargo
jets and 137 smaller planes, established routes to Brussels and
Tokyo before acquiring Flying Tigers. It has 63,000 employees
worldwide.
   Flying Tigers, with 6,500 employees, operates 37 cargo jets and
two passengers planes, with scheduled cargo service to North and
South America, Asia, Europe, the South Pacific and the Middle East.
   The Flying Tiger Line was founded in 1945 by pilots who fought
with Maj. Gen. Claire Chennault's fighter group, the Flying Tigers,
which flew missions over China in 1941.
   Tiger International, Tigers' parent company, almost was forced
into liquidation in 1986 after a run of losses analysts blamed on
unsuccessful diversification efforts, high salaries and high fuel
prices. But employees agreed to take a pay cut. The company showed
a profit last year and paid employees $16.5 million in
profit-sharing.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   LTV Corp., buffeted by cost increases in aircraft
programs and a 25 percent decline in steel operating income,
reported a first-quarter profit Tuesday of $76.6 million, down
sharply from a year earlier excluding a one-time charge.
   In the first quarter of 1988, the Dallas-based conglomerate
suffered a net loss of $2.12 billion, but that period included a
one-time charge of $2.26 billion resulting from a change in
accounting for post-employment medical and life insurance benefits.
   Without the charge, LTV's income for the first quarter of 1988
was $131.2 million.
   First quarter sales declined, to $1.6 billion from $1.9 billion
in the first quarter in 1988. Sales results for the company's steel
bar division were being held for disposition.
   Sales declines in aircraft and energy products were offset by
higher sales in missiles and electronics.
   In releasing its first quarter earnings, the company said cost
increases are expected in its YA-7F aircraft development program
and higher unit costs are projected on production of Boeing 747
commercial aircraft components.
   ``The decline in first quarter sales and operating income
reflects LTV's continuing rationalization of steel operations and
the cost increases in the two aircraft programs,'' said Raymond A.
Hay, chairman and chief executive officer.
   LTV attributed the decline in steel operating income to the sale
last year of its Warren, Ohio, steel plant.
   ``Demand for flat rolled steel remained firm, most of our
facilities are operating at a high percentage of capacity and
orders are strong through the second quarter,'' Hay said.

<HEAD>Japonica Partners, CNW Trade Charges Over Takeover Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japonica Partners and CNW Corp., the hunter and
the prey, reported little progress Tuesday at a meeting between
representatives of the New York investment group and the rail
holding company.
   Japonica has made a hostile bid for CNW, and each said the other
was to blame for the outcome of a meeting Monday that was called to
evaluate the takeover offer.
   CNW officials said Japonica barred any progress in the talks by
refusing to supply more information about equity and debt
commitments that might affect its $44-per-share offer for CNW's
outstanding common stock.
   Japonica shot back, calling the three-hour session a ``phantom
meeting.''
   ``We have been informed that CNW's directors have not authorized
their advisers to commence merger negotiations with Japonica
Partners,'' Japonica said in a statement.
   Japonica holds 8.8 percent of CNW's 16.4 million outstanding
shares.
   Fredric Spar, a Japonica spokesman, said the meeting occurred in
New York, with attorneys and bankers from Salomon Brothers Inc. and
Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. representing a special committee formed by CNW
to examine the takeover offer.
   ``Japonica Partners offered to enter into a merger agreement at
$44 within 72 hours, while permitting CNW to actively seek higher
offers both before the agreement is entered into and for a
reasonable period thereafter,'' Japonica said.
   ``It is incomprehensible to us that the board that one year ago
wanted stockholders to sell their shares at $31 now refuses to
negotiate in good faith our fully financed offer at a nearly 50
percent premium,'' Japonica said.
   CNW countered by saying representatives of its special committee
had attempted to work out a confidentiality agreement that would
give Japonica prompt access to CNW's management and private
information. The Chicago company said Japonica had been unwilling
to conclude such an agreement.
   CNW's principal subsidiary is the Chicago and North Western
Transportation Co., which operates a nine-state, 6,000-mile freight
system with 8,500 employees. CNW also has real estate holdings and
runs Chicago-area commuter rail lines.
   It earned $81 million on revenues of $995.4 million in 1988.
   Japonica said it would pare CNW to its core railroad freight
business and consider selling off its real estate, excess equipment
and commuter rail lines.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency proposed
on Tuesday to limit the maximum amounts of 38 types of
cancer-causing chemicals and other pollutants found in drinking
water, a move that will cause increases in some household water
bills.
   But the EPA said it can't meet a congressional deadline on two
dozen other water pollutants because it is short of money and staff.
   The 38 chemicals, including many widely used pesticides and
other highly toxic carcinogens, must be monitored and kept below
the required levels in all public drinking water under the EPA
regulations issued Tuesday. The rules will be made final after a
period for public comment.
   But EPA officials said local water officials will have another
18 months before they will be required to comply. Even longer
phase-in periods could be negotiated if local officials can show
economic hardship, officials said.
   Michael Cook, director of the EPA office which deals with
drinking water contaminants, said most public water systems already
meet the proposed requirements, but additional purification
equipment will probably be needed in about 2,500 public systems,
serving about 2 million people, mostly in rural areas.
   In some cases, a household water bill could go up as much as
$460 a year, although the increase will generally be much lower,
Cook said. The additional costs will chiefly be because of
equipment.
   The EPA estimated that the cost of public water in areas where
additional pollution controls are required could increase from $10
to $460 a year, depending on the size of the water system and the
contaminant and treatment technology involved.
   The water systems likely to be in violation of the federal
standard will account for roughly 3 percent of all the water
systems in the country and provide water for 2 million people, said
Cook.
   Private wells are not covered by the regulations.
   Cook said that when the regulations, covering 17 pesticides and
21 other pollutants, take effect, the EPA will have established
maximum allowable levels for 55 of 83 dangerous drinking water
contaminants singled out for action by Congress nearly three years
ago.
   Many of those federal standards probably will not go into effect
for another year or more, however.
   Three years ago, Congress told the EPA to establish federal
standards on all 83 pollutants by June 1 of this year, but Cook
said the agency won't be able to meet the deadline on the 28
remaining chemicals. He said the process is expected to take
another year as maximum safe levels and water treatment techniques
for each of the remaining contaminants are worked out.
   ``If we had more money and manpower we could have sped those
(calculations) up,'' said Cook, blaming agency budget constraints
and staff shortages for not being able to meet the deadline.
   The proposed standards cover 17 pesticides including alachlor,
aldicarb and atrazine, which are widely used in agriculture; 11
synthetic organic chemicals that have been found to cause cancer or
damage to the nervous system; and eight inorganic chemicals,
including asbestos, mercury, cadmium, nitrates and nitrites; and
two chemicals used to treat drinking water.
   The regulations also will require local water officials to
monitor the chemical levels in their water supply, at times as
frequently as every three months, and to make public those
occasions when the federal standards are exceeded.
   While most of the nation's water supply is already thought to be
in compliance with the federal standards, Cook said about 2,500
small, mostly rural water systems likely will violate the
regulations unless they install additional equipment.
   Officials operating about 80,000 water systems likely will have
to increase monitoring activities to comply with the federal rules.
   The requirements ``are important steps in the continuing effort
to assure that Americans have the safest drinking water in the
world,'' said Cook.
   But some EPA critics maintained that the regulations, while slow
in coming, are also too weak.
   Jacqueline Warren, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, said the maximum levels required by the EPA is
significantly higher than ceilings already required by a number of
states.
   Furthermore, she said, the EPA is lifting some water pollutant
standards, including the ones for aluminum and silver. Both pose
health risks, she said.

<TEXT>
   Consumers, environmentalists and politicians in scattered cities
joined Tuesday in a one-day ``Boycott Exxon'' campaign over its
huge oil spill in Alaska and over rising gasoline prices in the
industry in general.
   State attorneys general in the Northwest and U.S. senators from
Nebraska called for a federal investigation of why gasoline prices
have risen sharply since the March 24 Exxon Valdez spill.
   ``We are beginning the war of words and actions against any oil
company that doesn't understand its responsibility to protect the
environment,'' said Massachusetts state Sen. Carol Amick at a
boycott rally in Boston.
   J. Edward Surette Jr., executive director of the Bay State
Gasoline Retailers Association in Billerica, Mass., said his group
surveyed dealers Tuesday but found that it was too early to assess
the impact of the boycott.
   Surette accused Exxon Corp. of ``obvious negligence'' but said
it was unfair for consumers to vent their anger at dealers, most of
whom are small, independent businessmen.
   Consumer activist Ralph Nader said in Washington that Exxon
``should not be allowed to forget'' the Alaskan spill and that a
boycott was the way to send a message to the oil giant.
   Nader joined representatives from several environmental and
consumer groups in accusing Exxon of failing to be prepared for the
spill and not rapidly responding to the accident that has fouled
hundreds of miles of Alaska's coast.
   Consumer groups in Alaska, Connecticut, and New York state also
asked consumers to join the boycott.
   In Anchorage, about 400 chanting and sign-waving protesters
rallied in front of Exxon's Alaska headquarters, urging consumers
to boycott Exxon products.
   In Portland, Ore., more than 100 people rallied in the shadow of
Alaskan oil tankers being repaired at the shipyard where the
ruptured Exxon Valdez is scheduled to be inspected next month.
   Business was off at Cross Keyes Exxon in Sicklerville, N.J.,
where some customers cut up their Exxon credit cards and turned
them in.
   ``In the morning you (usually) get a lot of business here, but
it's dropped off,'' said mechanic Joseph Saiia said. ``Ain't nobody
in there.''
   Exxon issued a statement calling the boycott unjust, and added:
``Exxon believes in the basic fairness of the American people and
is confident that they will see Exxon's employees, dealers and
owners as victims of human error, not as an institution that should
be discriminated against for an accident that occurred while we
were doing our job.''
   Concern over tight gasoline supplies for the summer driving
season escalated following the Alaska oil spill and an explosion at
a North Sea oil rig. Crude oil prices have risen more than $7 a
barrel since January.
   Since the Exxon Valdez accident, gas prices have increased an
average 10 percent nationally, while the Pacific Northwest saw
surges as high as 25 percent in less than a month, said Marla Rae,
executive assistant to Oregon Attorney General Dave Frohnmayer.
   Exxon spokeswoman Sarah Johnson said 10,000 credit cards out of
7 million have been cut up and returned to the company since the
spill.
   Exxon said it had received no reports from dealers of a loss in
volume of gasoline sold as a result of the credit card return or
from boycotts.
   About 5 percent, or 620, of the 12,400 Exxon brand stations in
the United States are owned and operated by Exxon. The rest are
independent.
   The Exxon boycott was endorsed by 16 Democratic California
legislators. ``We want to show Exxon that corporations who harm the
environment will pay a price in the marketplace,'' said Assemblyman
Tom Bates.
   Twenty Oregon legislators also joined Tuesday in a call to
support the boycott.
   Attorneys general of three Northwest states want the nation's
chief law officer to investigate why oil prices have risen sharply,
especially since the Exxon Valdez ripped its hull on a reef in
Alaska's Prince William Sound.
   Frohnmayer, Ken Eikenberry of Washington and Jim Jones of Idaho
announced Monday they will ask U.S. Attorney General Richard
Thornburgh and Daniel Oliver, chairman of the Federal Trade
Commission, for an investigation of gas prices.
   U.S. Sens. James Exon and Bob Kerrey, both Nebraska Democrats,
called on Thornburgh to investigate potential price gouging by the
industry since the spill. They noted that gas prices in Nebraska
rose 20 percent from the first of March until mid-April.

<HEAD>Helicopter Division Announces 450 Layoffs, More to Come</HEAD>

   McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co. on Tuesday
announced the planned layoff of 450 workers this month, with about
the same number to follow next year.
   President Bill Brown blamed the firings on a slowdown in attack
helicopter production.
   He said temporary and regular employees would be laid off,
including workers at plants in Mesa and Culver City, Calif., and in
all divisions.
   The helicopter division of McDonnell Douglas Corp. has 5,000
employees at its Mesa plant and 3,000 in Culver City.
   The company has been building about 10 AH-64 Apache attack
helicopters a month, but the Pentagon has ordered that rate cut
back to six a month beginning June 1990.
   McDonnell Douglas has delivered about 460 Apaches on a contract
that called for 975. But President Bush said two weeks ago in
unveiling his defense cuts that the Army now wants only 807, a drop
of 168.
   The division also builds the MD-500 series of light helicopters
and a variety of automatic cannons.
   The Apache suffered a major setback earlier this year when the
commander of the Army's 82nd Aviation Brigade at Fort Bragg, N.C.,
complained that it was unreliable. He said all 12 of the Apaches in
his unit were incapacitated at points during a war exercise, and
only five were in operating condition at the end.

   Northwest Airlines, a takeover target of Los
Angeles billionaire Marvin Davis, on Tuesday resumed contract talks
with its 5,000-member pilots union.
   Negotiations were scheduled to continue through Friday,
according to a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association.
   Northwest Chairman Steven Rothmeier has said a closed contract
is needed if the airline is to make a deal with friendly investors
to thwart a hostile buyout bid by Davis.
   The oil mogul has launched a $2.7 billion, or $90-a-share,
tender offer rejected by the board of directors of Northwest's
parent, NWA Inc.
   As many as four groups of friendly investors have expressed an
interest in buying or investing in the airline but don't want to
face the possibility of a pilots' strike, Rothmeier has said.
   The contract would unify the wages, seniority rights and working
conditions of the pilots, who have been working under separate
pacts since Northwest acquired Republic Airlines in the fall of
1986.
   ``There are more than 100 items that we are in disagreement
over,'' said Jim Halvorson, an ALPA spokesman.
   Important issues left unresolved include earnings and the right
for Northwest to use non-union labor.
   The pilots want assurances that non-union pilots won't be hired
to fly new planes purchased by Northwest's jet leasing subsidiary,
Halvorson said.
   ``Any airplanes they buy, we fly,'' he said.
   Rothmeier has said the company's position on the issue is firm.
   Northwest has offered only small hourly wage increases, but has
said wages for most pilots will increase as much as 38 percent
under a broad upgrade in classifications for current pilots.
   ``The concept is good, but the numbers that they gave us were
not'' adequate, Halvorson said.
   Talks between the two sides were last held in mid-April and
broke off as scheduled. Rothmeier pleaded for expedited
negotiations because of the takeover threat, but the pilots
declined.
   Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons said the company would not
comment on the status of negotiations.

<HEAD>El Paso Electric Loses Millions; Suspends Dividend Payments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOLDEN LEWIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   El Paso Electric Co. blamed the state
Public Utility Commission as it announced Tuesday a $5.7 million
loss for the first quarter and a suspension of its common-stock
dividend for the rest of 1989.
   The loss was blamed on disastrous investments in a nuclear power
plant and in non-utility-related real estate. A spokesman said the
company's $20 million in tax writeoffs for the quarter were an
effort to cut its losses and begin recovering from bad investments.
   For the quarter, the company lost $5.7 million on revenue of
$95.3 million, compared with earnings of $13.9 million, or 40 cents
a share, on revenue of $89.5 million during the first three months
of 1988.
   The company suspended sales of the over-the-counter stock
Tuesday morning, a few hours before it announced it was suspending
dividend payments on 35 million shares of common stock. Trading did
not resume Tuesday, and the stock closed at $8.25, down 25 cents.
   Spokesman Ken Perry said trading will resume Wednesday morning.
   El Paso Electric wrote off $15 million in investments in the
Palo Verde nuclear plant near Phoenix, and $5 million in real
estate losses during the quarter.
   The utility said its board of directors decided to write off the
Palo Verde loss because the company didn't get a rate increase it
wanted. The PUC on Thursday granted it a rate increase of $15
million _ $23 million less than the company sought.
   The utility said it needed a $38 million rate increase over two
years to pay for a sale and lease-back of its share in Palo Verde.
After taxes, the company's loss from the plant was reduced from $23
million to $15 million.

<HEAD>Browning-Ferris, Wellman Announce Recycling Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., one of the
nation's largest trash haulers, said Tuesday it reached an
agreement to supply plastic refuse to the nation's largest plastics
recycling company.
   Under the agreement, BFI will ship plastics from its curb-side
collection programs, recycling program and processing centers to
Wellman Inc.'s facilities in South Carolina and Pennsylvania,
officials said.
   ``This will serve everyone's needs,'' BFI Chairman William D.
Ruckelshaus said.
   ``It is expected to guarantee an assured market for all the
plastics we are collecting in our recycling programs now and as we
expand, to provide Wellman a growing supply of plastics so they can
continue to grow,'' Ruckelshaus said.
   Houston-based BFI described the deal as the first of its kind
between a major waste service and a recycling company.
   Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
   Wellman, with 1988 sales of $314.6 million, manufactures a
variety of products from waste plastics and other materials. Its
primary raw materials are reclaimed soft drink bottles.
   ``We have long maintained that the key to effective plastic
recycling lies primarily in establishing an effective and efficient
collection program,'' Wellman President Tom Duff said. ``Since
BFI's interest is also business-driven, we are confident that this
joint effort will be successful.''
   BFI, which has been involved in recycling since 1971, operates
curb-side recovery programs that include yard wastes, paper, metal
and glass containers, plastics and oil. The company also operates
``Recycleries,'' where materials for recycling are extracted from
waste and where other materials are collected from the public.
   BFI also is involved in municipal and commercial sweeping
operations, medical waste services, portable restroom services and
asbestos abatement.
