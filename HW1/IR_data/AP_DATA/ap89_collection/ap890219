<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rafik Helou, a retired schoolteacher,
hasn't received his state pension for nearly five months. That's
because he's a Christian and lives in east Beirut and the social
security office is in west Beirut, the Moslem sector.
   He is a victim of a bizarre political crisis in long-suffering
Lebanon in which government institutions, including the army, have
been split in two by rival Christian and Moslem Cabinets vying for
power.
   The 64-year-old Helou, who has a heart ailment, has to rely on
his sons to pay for medicines for himself and his wife, who suffers
from diabetes.
   The power struggle threatens to cement the de facto partition of
Lebanon.
   Many of the country's estimated 4 million people, hardened by 14
years of civil war, have taken this bureaucratic nightmare in their
stride, despite three weeks of bloody fighting between rival Shiite
Moslem factions in southern Lebanon.
   But for thousands of people like Helou, it has made the daily
struggle for survival even more difficult.
   State employees are still getting paid.
   Lebanon still has gold reserves worth an estimated $2.5 billion
stored at Fort Knox in Kentucky. But with foreign currency earnings
dwindling, the central bank has turned to internal borrowing from
commercial banks to supplement funds officials are able to collect
in taxes, customs duties and other levies.
   But pensioners like Helou have suffered. The social security
department's board of directors has not been able to meet to endorse
pension payments because Christian officials are afraid to cross the
dividing Green Line into west Beirut.
   Helou said in an interview: ``We need 30,000 Lebanese pounds
($60) a month for medicines. I relied on my annual pension of 6
million pounds ($12,000), but with two governments I can't get it.
   ``Fortunately my sons are providing me with the medications for
the time being. But how long can this go on?''
   The crisis began Sept. 22, when President Amin Gemayel's 6-year
term ended without a successor being named.
   Minutes before he stepped down, Gemayel named the commander of
the Christian army, Gen. Michel Aoun, as the head of an interim
military Cabinet until a new president was elected.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Syrian-backed Sunni Moslem,
and other Moslem leaders refused to acknowledge Aoun.
   The government lost its authority long ago and real political
power has rested with the heavily armed militias on both sides and
their foreign allies, such as Syria and Israel.
   Yet government departments handling social and economic matters
continued to function after a fashion, just enough to maintain a
semblance of normality. Now even that slender thread is in jeopardy.
   Ghassan Bitar, a Christian municipal employee, said he and his
colleagues have not been paid since September.
   Bitar, 32, who has two children and a wife five months pregnant,
said he had to turn his family Mercedes-Benz into a taxi to make
ends meet.
   ``I can't leave my family hungry,'' he said.
   Rana Shehab's dreams of going to London to study medicine were
shatted Ms. Shehab, an
18-year-old Moslem. ``The only alternative was to enroll in the
American University of Beirut.''
   The university, which once was the most prestigious education
center in the Middle East, is now a shadow of that since its foreign
professors were frightened off by a wave of kidnappings of its
American and British lecturers and administrators.
   But Ms. Shehab noted: ``It's better than nothing.''
   An Education Ministry official, Sami Hamadi, said the authorities
decided not to issue certificates for students in either west or
east Beirut ``until the government is reunited.''
   Even getting in and out of Lebanon has become a problem for some
people.
   ``Airport officials turned me back when they saw my passport was
renewed in east Beirut,'' said Anis Saeed, a Christian, when he
tried to leave through the airport in west Beirut.
   ``I got my ticket refunded and now I'm going to take the ferry to
Cyprus from the Christian port of Jounieh,'' said Saeed, 24.
   The Lebanese have learned how to survive under the most arduous
conditions during the civil war, Israel's invasion in 1982 and
endless factional feuding. But the cloning of what had passed for
their government has exasperated many.
   ``We're fed up,'' said Amal Hamdi, 28, a secretary in west
Beirut. ``We want this chaos to end. However, if formal partitioning
would lead to security, stability and better living conditions, let
it be.''
   ``Let's either have formal partition or elect a new president,
but let's finish and know where we stand,'' said Pierre Ayyoub, 36,
who works at an east Beirut trading company.
   Every government ministry now has two competing heads. The
40,000-man army, the police and municipal departments are similarly
split in two.
   The only institution that has remained intact is the central
bank, which is financing both governments. It is in west Beirut.
   Mohammed Hout, economic adviser to bank governor Edmond Naim,
said the bank's main objective is to provide the basic needs of
people of both sides of the sectarian divide.
   ``We extend advances to both governments to cover wages and
salaries for the public sector, to import essential commodities such
as fuel and flour and spare parts to maintain such services as
electricity and water,'' Hout explained.
   ``We pay military salaries on both sides, but we won't advance
money for purchasing armaments.''
   The Christian Aoun has been pressing to impose his disputed
authority on the central bank and in December he closed the only
crossing point on the Green Line in a move widely seen as
retaliation for the bank's providing $100,000 to Moslem units.
   The 10-day closure kept food and fuel from reaching west Beirut
from the Christian sector, where the main government warehouses are
situated.
   Aoun lifted the blockade after Christian business interests
complained they were unable to sell their goods in Moslem sectors.

   Louisiana has had the nation's highest
unemployment rate for more than a year. More than 40,000 people have
left the Bayou state. Louisiana had a $2 billion debt. State and
local budget cuts have hurt health care and schools. A two-part
series, ``Bad Times On The Bayou,'' examines the depression and the
social revolution taking place in Louisiana. First, the economic
woes of what was once one of the nation's richest states.

   One day last year, state government was within
an hour of not making the payroll. One day in the future, economists
warn, this city could be knocking on bankruptcy's door. Bond ratings
are just one notch above junk bonds.
   Times are hard in Louisiana.
   Charity hospital clinics overflow because the state can't afford
enough doctors to go around. Windows in City Hall remain cracked and
unrepaired. Children go to school in packed classrooms without
modern teaching aids such as computers. One town has to turn off
street lights to save money.
   ``We have become a state of mediocrity instead of a state of
excellence,'' said Commissioner of Administration Dennis Stine.
``We've become a welfare state instead of a wealthy state.''
   Times are hard in Louisiana.
   An estimated 30,000 unskilled oil workers are unemployed; some
have been out of work so long their benefits ran out long ago. Many
of the state's skilled workers have fled to healthier regions. In
all, close to 100,000 jobs have been lost.
   Even worse, antiquated laws from bygone boom days handcuff public
officials' efforts to attract new business and raise the money
needed to improve education, health care and the economy.
   French-Cajun optimism, the let-the-good-times-roll attitude that
drank up boom after boom and thirsted through only occasional busts,
seems to be fading. People have been packing up and moving out. No
hope of another oil boom, they say. No hope.
   ``We seem to find people with short fuses lately,'' said Hubert
Chiasson, the manager of New Orleans' largest unemployment office.
``Do I really see any signs of improvement? No, I really don't.''
   Times are hard in Louisiana.
   The state was forced to borrow $1.3 billion to cover its debt,
and another $1.2 billion to bail out its insolvent unemployment
insurance fund. About 10 percent of the state tax collections now go
to pay interest on debt.
   Sales taxes are already highest in the nation _ 9 percent in New
Orleans. Businesses fear that they will be taxed to bail the state
out.
   ``It's a spiral _ you can't get new business, so you can't employ
all the people who need jobs,'' said Tim Ryan, director of business
and economic research at the University of New Orleans. ``That
doesn't mean we will spiral down any further, but there will be no
new growth.''
   In fact, there are indicators that the economy has bottomed out
after two years of depression. There are no signs of improvement,
however.
   The price of oil began its crash in 1984, and two years later a
leading state business organization proclaimed that Louisiana's
recession had become a depression. Unemployment reached 14.5 percent
in January 1987. The latest figure is about 10 percent _ twice the
national average.
   Despite its abundance of resources, waterway location and
reputation for good food and good times, the state proved to be
ill-prepared for the day when the oil ``gravy train'' stopped,
economists said.
   The taxing structure dates back to the days of populist Huey
Long, who believed the people were entitled to a free ride at the
expense of business. Most homes are exempt from property taxes; many
state services are offered at unusually low rates, such as $3 a year
for an automobile license plate.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer tried to rearrange the fiscal structure, but
his first attempt failed in the Legislature last fall. He says he'll
try again, and win, because the future of the state depends on it.
   ``We had a state where big money beat big ideas, and that's a
loser. We're trying to reverse it,'' Roemer said.
   The state has a huge group _ estimated at 30,000 _ of out-of-work
oil workers with no employable skills. Most dropped out of school
for the lure of big money on oil rigs. Many don't even have the
money now to pack up and move out.
   ``How are we going to get our present work force into jobs?''
asks Eugene Schreiber, director of New Orleans' World Trade Center
and chairman of a governor's task force on labor. ``We have to train
and develop our workers.''
   New Orleans has seen its sales tax revenue fall so far that the
mayor said the only services left to cut were courts and school
crossing guards. The city has lost $100 million in revenue _ a full
one-third of its entire budget _ since oil prices crashed.
   ``The current budget is in a crisis,'' Mayor Sidney Barthelemy
said in an interview before opting for an $8-per-household ``public
safety fee'' and slashing court funding from $25 million to $15
million, with layoffs in the district attorney's office.
   But Louisiana law says the City Council can't raise property
taxes without a general election, and besides, only 15 percent of
the homeowners in New Orleans pay property taxes, by law.
   The City Council can't raise the sales tax, by law. It can't
create an income tax, by law.
   All Barthelemy says he can do is raise fees, such as slapping a
surcharge on water bills for ``public safety.''
   The city of Shreveport, in the northern part of the state,
balanced its budget by laying off 115 Sanitation Department workers,
abolishing back door garbage pickups and raising water and sewer
rates 25 percent.
   Houma, an oil town near the Gulf of Mexico, found times were so
hard that 3,000 street lights had to be turned off to save money.
   ``Business has never been as bad,'' said Dan Catlett, owner of
the Houma Pawn Shop. ``I can't see any improvement, and I'm usually
the first to tell.''
   New Orleans school Supt. Everett Williams has had to cope with
all the problems of a large, urban school system while his budget
has been slashed. The state cut back on its funding, so did the
federal government, and the city. He's laid off 300 employees. His
teacher-pupil ratio has climbed to 29-to-1 in elementary schools.
His counselor-to-pupil ratio is 450-to-1.
   Voters approved a bond package to help the schools, but it's not
enough. This year, the schools are operating with $30 million in
``bridge funding'' from the state. Williams is worried he'll lose
that money next year.
   That could mean more layoffs, a shorter school year, and a budget
so poor ``I really couldn't operate the school district.''
   Williams, like Mayor Barthelemy, Gov. Roemer, economists and
business leaders, says the key to the future will be reshaping the
tax structure to promote new business and remove the handcuffs from
local governments. Despite the element of futility, they see good
times ahead.
   ``I am optimistic, and I guess that's how we survive,'' Williams
said.
   The governor added, ``We are going to turn this state around.''

<TEXT>
   Inside the dingy walls of Indira Gandhi
Children's Hospital, doctors and nurses wage their own battle to
save children from the savagery of the war _ booby-trapped toys,
rockets, bombs and bullets.
   Mriya, a 4-year-old from Charikar, 45 miles north of Kabul, was
badly injured three weeks ago by artillery fire as Soviet and Afghan
troops attacked Moslem guerrillas trying to topple the government.
   She suffered broken bones, but she was lucky. Ten of the 12
people living in her house were killed.
   Six children injured in a guerrilla rocket attack in Kabul were
brought to the 300-bed hospital last week. Doctors were able to save
three of them.
   When the parents of one of survivor were told their 12-year-old
son's right leg would have to be amputated, the father sobbed and
cried: ``Oh, let him die. Let him die. He's no good anymore.''
   Even before civil war broke out in 1978, Afghanistan had the
world's highest child mortality rate, according to U.N. statisics.
   At least 340 of every 1,000 children will not reach their fifth
birthday, and doctors and nurses working in a country where medical
care is far below accepted standards are struggling to keep the
number from rising.
   ``We want to get away from politics as much as possible here,''
said Dr. Abdul Salam Jalali, head of the 102-member hospital staff.
   ``There may be sons of mujahedeen (guerrilla) commanders here. We
don't ask. They are children. They are not directly involved in the
war.''
   Some children have been injured by toys rigged with explosives
and left on streets. It is unclear whether the booby traps are the
work of Afghan government forces or the guerrillas.
   More than 1 million people have died in the war, which has
severely strained the hospital, built in 1972 by India and named
after its late prime minister. It is always crowded and cockroaches
climb the walls.
   ``Sometimes we put two or three patients in one bed. Sometimes we
put them in a corridor or on the floor. But we never refuse a
patient, and it's all completely free,'' Jalali said.
   The cost of medicine and food has soared and consumed the
hospital's budget.
   All medicine is imported and getting it to the hospital is
difficult because of fuel shortages and guerrilla attacks on
government convoys. A lack of supplies often forces doctors to reuse
bandages.
   The war also has made it harder for Afghanistan's poor to afford
nutritional food and has diverted attention from child health care.
   ``They don't bother about these problems,'' Jalali said. ``They
just want to stay alive, and when they finally do bring them to the
hospital it's often too late.''
   ``Malnutrition is our main problem. This has been going on for
years, but now it's worse,'' he said.
   Emaciated children, their resistance weakened by lack of food,
suffer tuberculosis, meningitis and other diseases.
   In the final weeks of the Soviet troop withdrawal, Kabul suffered
severe food shortages. Vegetable and fruit stands at city markets
now are full, but prices are far beyond the reach of the poor.
   The situation is worse for children in other parts of Afghanistan.
   Khagal Mohammad, who livesin the Laghman province east of Kabul,
weighs about 15 pounds, the normal weight for a 7-month-old baby. He
is 4 years old.
   Mayabim, a 5-year-old from central Hazarajat weighs only 20
pounds, and suffers from tuberculosis, meningitis and brain damage.
   ``We were too far away. It took us too long to get here,'' said
his sobbing mother, Gulandam.
   UNICEF, the Red Crescent _ a Moslem organization similar to the
Red Cross _ and other charities also care for children but say more
help is needed.
   ``Peace is a prerequisite, and peace for Afghanistan is not yet
on the horizon,'' said UNICEF spokesman Vincent O'Reilley.

   Quotations are the salt and pepper of political
speeches, and members of Congress have long had their own wit and
wisdom enlivened by them.
   As often as not those quotes have come from the quote files
maintained for the last 50 years by the Congressional Research
Service of the Library of Congress.
   Now, 2,100 of the best have been gleaned from those files and put
between the covers of a book, ``Respectfully Quoted,'' in time for
the celebration this year of the 200th anniversary of the convening
of the 1st Congress in 1789.
   While the range is wide, many of the quotations requested by
congressmen concern Congress itself, even quotes which are less than
flattering to the institution and its members.
   ``Congress is so strange,'' a Russian visitor observed. ``A man
gets up to speak and says nothing. Nobody listens. And then
everybody disagrees.''
   American humorist Will Rogers: ``With Congress _ every time they
make a joke, it's a law. And every time they make a law it's a
joke.''
   Or the opening line from the actor playing John Adams in the
musical, ``1776'' _ ``I have come to the conclusion that one useless
man is called a disgrace, that two are called a law firm and that
three or more become a congress.''
   Or this, from Mark Twain: ``It could probably be shown by facts
or figures that there is no distinctly American criminal class
except Congress.''
   Someone once asked the Rev. Edward Everett Hale, then chaplain of
the Senate, ``Do you pray for the senators, Dr. Hale?''
   The quoted reply: ``No, I look at the senators and pray for the
country.''
   From Sen. John Sharp Williams, D-Miss., at a 1923 farewell
dinner: ``I sometimes think I'd rather be a dog and bay at the moon
then stay in the Senate another six years and listen to it.''
   Members of Congress, like other politicians, obtain office
through elections and the new volume has quotations to offer on that
subject:
   Such as: ``An election is coming. Universal peace is declared,
and the foxes have a sincere interest in prolonging the lives of the
poultry'' _ George Eliot, the English author, in 1866.
   There is much advice on how to govern:
   _``The great art of governing consists of not letting men grow
old in their jobs'' _ Napoleon Bonaparte.
   _``A government which robs Peter to pay Paul can always depend on
the support of Paul.'' _ George Bernard Shaw.
   _``There is no Democratic or Republican way of cleaning the
streets'' _ Fiorello La Guardia.
   Politicians of course make promises.
   Abraham Lincoln is alleged to have once said: ``We must not
promise what we ought not, lest we be called on to perform what we
cannot.'' The Congressional Reference Service says the accuracy of
the quote cannot be verified.
   It does vouch, however, for the authenticity of Jonathan Swift's
declaration that: ``Promises and pie-crusts ... are made to be
broken.''

<HEAD>Jerusalem Mayor's Dream of Truly Uniting City Seems out of Reach</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Teddy Kollek, Jerusalem's peacemaker for a
generation, is virtually assured an unprecedented sixth term in
elections this month, but his dream of a truly united city seems out
of reach.
   Kollek is expected to lose control of the city council to
religious and right-wing parties in the Feb. 28 vote, a development
that could heat up the religious and Arab-Jewish conflicts dividing
the city of 500,000.
   The 77-year-old Kollek knows what he's up against.
   ``You have an increase of the extreme edges on all sides,'' said
Kollek, citing rises in religious, nationalist and secular activism.
``To keep a middle line is very complicated.''
   During a recent campaign stop in the outdoor Mahane Yehuda
market, a rowdy stronghold of right-wing sentiments, he looked out
of place in his blue wool suit and brown fur hat. But he was
thronged by the vendors, some applauding and shouting ``Teddy,
Teddy!''
   His popularity is expected to help the Vienna-born mayor match
his 1983 results, when he won 65 percent in the direct vote. His One
Jerusalem slate took 17 of 31 city council seats.
   But this year, Kollek could lose council control because of the
growing strength of the religious parties and the announced election
boycott by Arab voters, traditionally Kollek supporters.
   Working with a hostile council would weaken Kollek, who has been
credited for keeping much of the bloodshed of the 14-month-old
Palestinian uprising out of Jerusalem by trying to cool tempers and
arguing with aggressive policemen.
   The religious-secular conflict heated up in the summer of 1987
when Orthodox Jewish men in black coats and hats hurled stones at
Friday night moviegoers to protest the screening of films on the
Jewish Sabbath.
   The ``movie wars'' are part of an intensified ultra-Orthodox
campaign for more laws guarding the sanctity of the Sabbath and
greater budget allocations for religious education and housing.
   ``We are fighting for the soul of the nation,'' said Rabbi
Yitzhak Peretz, leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, in a
campaign video.
   Shas and others are not targeting the sure Orthodox vote _ about
30 percent of the city's 350,000 Jewish residents.
   They are after less observant Jews seeking reassurance in
troubled times, the same voters who were mainly responsible for the
religious parties' gains in the November general election.
   Secular activists warn that the ``black hats'' will turn
Jerusalem into an Iran-style theocracy. The city turns into a
virtual ghost town on the Sabbath, forcing many residents to drive
40 miles to Tel Aviv for weekend entertainment.
   ``The Orthodox are saying `We took on the Knesset (parliament)
and Jerusalem is next,''' said Anat Hoffman, a council candidate for
the secular Citizens Rights Movement.
   Across town, in Arab east Jerusalem, there are no indications
that an election campaign is being waged.
   Many Palestinians have stayed away from elections to show they
don't accept the annexation of east Jerusalem, which Israel captured
from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.
   In 1983, 12,000 of the city's 150,000 Arab residents cast votes,
but this year all the Arab residents are expected to boycott the
elections. Leaders of the uprising against Israeli rule in the
occupied territories have urged activists to ``strike against all
who participate in such an election.''
   ``Participation in the elections would imply that we accept
unilateral annexation,'' said Hanna Siniora, a Palestine Liberation
Organization supporter and editor of the Arabic-language Al Fajr
newspaper.
   Siniora acknowledged, however, that Kollek had a better image
among Palestinians than his opponents.
   Kollek said tolerance was the central message of his campaign.
   ``This is a very complicated city. We have Jews from 103
different backgrounds, 40 different Christian denominations, and we
have Arabs who aren't all united either,'' Kollek said.
   ``If we won't be tolerant toward one another, there will be no
life in the city.''

<HEAD>New Interpretation Could Let Official Keep Stock</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government agency regulating the savings
and loan industry has relaxed its reading of an internal rule in a
way that apparently will allow one of its top officials to keep his
stock in a family business.
   The rule, which had prompted Federal Home Loan Bank Board member
Roger Martin to promise to get rid of the stock, has been
interpreted too literally, according to Harry W. Quillian, deputy
general counsel for the board.
   Martin promised when he joined the board in 1987 that he would
divest himself of his 29 percent interest in Pope Scientific Inc.
That promise was made to the Office of Government Ethics and
incorporated into Martin's sworn testimony during his Senate
confirmation hearing.
   Once he made that promise, federal ethics laws required Martin to
carry through and rid himself of the stock within 90 days of his
confirmation. But he says he did not want to dispose of his holding
in the company and, after making his promise, received verbal advice
that he could keep the stock.
   Quillian wrote to Martin last week saying that the interpretation
of the agency's rules he gave Martin in 1987 was wrong.
   The original interpretation resulted from defining the word
``employee'' in the board regulation so broadly that it would, in
effect, consider a company in which an employee owned a substantial
interest an ``employee'' of the board as well as the actual employee
himself.
   That way, rules on such things as conflicts of interest and
ethics would apply not only to board employees, but to the actions
of companies in which they held a substantial interest.
   ``While that is certainly the literal interpretation of that
provision, such an interpretation would of course be
unenforceable,'' Quillian wrote to Martin last week. ``Accordingly,
we have decided after further research and reflection that the
definition cannot and should not be interpreted literally.''
   Pope Scientific, based in Menomonee Falls, Wis., manufactures
laboratory glassware and instruments. While it has done work for the
government from time to time, it would have little or no occasion to
bring it into contact with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   In letters to The Milwaukee Sentinel and USA Today, Martin
complained that under the literal interpretation of the board's
rules, ``I would have had to report on federal financial disclosure
forms the entire interest of Pope as if I were its sole owner.''
   Until Martin became a member of the bank board in 1987, he was
Pope Scientific's chairman. His wife, Ann, owns 51 percent of the
company and is its president. His son, Geoffrey, is vice president.
   Martin also said that ``there is no such requirement'' that would
compel him to sell his interest in the company.
   However, Gary Davis, chief counsel for the Office of Government
Ethics, said that once Martin made a promise to divest, he either
had to do it or explain why not.
   ``He has a requirement to act on the terms of his ethics
agreement unless he provides an explanation for the change in
conditions,'' Davis said.
   Using the range categories on financial disclosure forms, Martin
listed his 29 percent stake in the company as being worth between
$100,000 and $250,000.
   Martin did sell other financial holdings when he joined the bank
board. He had held stock in MGIC Investment Corp. and was vice
president of Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corp. He sold that stock,
resigned the post and promised not to take part in matters affecting
that company or the mortgage insurance industry.
   The bank board, which regulates and audits the nation's savings
and loans, has been overrun with work as that industry has sunk into
such deep financial trouble that President Bush has proposed a
massive federal bailout.
   Some of the board's paperwork has fallen through the cracks.
   ``For the last any number of months we've been like one-armed
paper hangers,'' Quillian said.
   ``But in the present circumstances it seemed like it was well to
drop everything and get this out on paper, which we've now done,''
Quillian said.
   Asked what the ``present circumstances'' were, he replied: ``You
guys writing about it.''

   Kadi Umarou emerged from a
helmet-shaped granary of golden straw, her arms laden with millet
stalks, and headed home past a dozen other new granaries built for
the best harvest in 20 years.
   This country on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert, which has
been forced to ask the world for food repeatedly for more than a
decade, is feeding itself this year.
   Rains last spring and summer were plentiful and farmers say
conditions for planting hadn't been better in 30 years. The
government reported a grain surplus of more than 200,000 tons after
the harvest last fall, enough to carry the country through this
spring's planting.
   Pastures are green and herds are increasing. Bellies are full and
children are smiling. Things are as good as they have been in a
long, long time.
   ``My children eat now when they want. My husband is strong. I am
less afraid and still there is more grain,'' Mrs. Umarou said,
speaking in the tribal language of Djerma through a translator.
   But in a region where problems are profound, a year as good as
1988 shows just how bad things really are.
   Ernest Gibson, an official with the U.S. Agency for International
Development in Niamey, about 20 miles away, said bumper harvests in
this West African nation are so rare some villagers didn't know what
to do.
   ``In one village, they have gone a whole generation without
anything left over so they didn't know how to construct granaries.
The government sent a team to teach them,'' Gibson said.
   From Mauritania on the Atlantic coast across to Ethiopia in the
east the situation was much the same, with the countries on the vast
arid border south of the Sahara reporting better than average
rainfall in 1988. Record harvests were reported in Burkina Faso,
Chad and Mali.
   ``If it rained for 20 years you would have healthy people in
Niger,'' said Gibson. ``But you have to turn that abundance into
productive, sustainable, non-agricultural activities. If not, when
the rain stops in the 21st year you will need emergency food.''
   Many experts in development agencies say wealthy people here tend
to invest their money abroad. Exceptions are those who build houses
in the capital to rent and others who buy agricultural products and
horde them for resale.
   ``There is a surplus of millet, prices have fallen and there is
no government price support,'' said Olav Bakken Jensen of CARE.
``The rich merchants buy it, hold it until there isn't any food and
then resell it, often to aid agencies at inflated prices, who
distribute it as emergency food. They can't go wrong and the poor
farmer who needs the cash has no choice but to sell.''
   Even one obvious benefit of the good harvest, well-fed
youngsters, has a sobering side.
   ``Of course the children born this year will get a better
start,'' said Jensen. ``But then there will be more babies, more
marriages by people who have been putting off getting married for
years. Even the government has informally asked people to not use
their extra income to buy too many wives. But this is precisely what
is happening.''
   In the eastern province of Zinder, Mike Edwards of Tulane
University's School of Public Health has been weighing babies in a
project for CARE. He has found some surprising results: the number
of children suffering acute malnutrition has decreased since the
famine of 1984, but the number of children with chronic malnutrition
is on the rise.
   Those who were starved as infants have not yet recovered, he
said, and malnutrition is tied to more than simply how much a child
eats.
   ``Millet is good and children this year are getting lots of
millet. But they are not getting the variety of protein and vitamins
babies need for muscle growth. A baby needs quality, not just
quantity,'' Edwards explained.
   Still, any respite in the harsh environment can't help but boost
morale.
   ``In the first year or two of drought a person can retain some
hope,'' said Horacio Soares, director of the agricultural weather
station set up to monitor conditions after the disastrous 1072-73
drought.
   ``But after years and years, you just give up. With rain, people
feel happier, they're willing to cooperate with government programs
and even push for more help with development.''

<HEAD>U.S. Prematurely Terminates Government Management Project</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A highly unusual project in which U.S. economic
experts tried to help Liberia straighten out its chaotic
governmental finances has ended abruptly, reportedly scuttled by
Liberian President Samuel Doe.
   One frustrated American participant said Doe could not be
persuaded to abandon his practice of maintaining an extracurricular
budget outside the government's control.
   The premature termination roughly halfway into the two-year
project, coming as it does on the heels of a congressional freeze on
aid to Liberia, may be prompting Doe into action.
   Doe, a former army sergeant who took power in a bloody 1980 coup,
is considering a trip to the funeral of Japan's Emperor Hirohito in
hopes of meeting President Bush, Liberian officials and dissidents
say.
   Although the evolving situation remains in flux, analysts are
concerned it could prompt a renewal of threats against U.S.
interests in the coastal African nation, which is supported largely
by U.S. foreign aid and investment.
   The project, which stemmed from Doe's efforts to boost U.S.
support and introduce some order into his government finances, was
billed as a $15.5 million program when it was signed in 1987.
   The unusual arrangement, which gave American experts the right to
cosign Liberian government checks, was made possible by the historic
links between the United States and Liberia, a country of 2.3
million residents that was founded in the 19th century by freed
slaves.
   All but one or two of the 17 experts, who have stayed behind to
complete computerization programs, are now back in the United
States, said Fred Berger, Vice President of Lewis Berger
International, which conducted the project under contract to the
U.S. government.
   The team was frustrated by lack of support from Doe and by his
practice of maintaining a budget outside the government's control,
Berger said.
   A statement by the Agency for International Development said the
project achieved progress in getting the government to meet its
payroll on time, pay pensions and increase tax receipts.
``Unfortunately, progress was not uniform and some serious problems
could not be resolved,'' said the statement.
   Dissidents and congressional staffers said the team discovered
that Doe manages part of the government budget like a discretionary
slush fund which was outside the purview of the American experts.
   A spokesman at the Liberian Embassy, Paul Yarl, declined to
discuss the project, saying only that it had been completed in a
satisfactory manner.
   Specifically, revenues from the government-owned corporations for
forestry and petroleum products _ which account for about 40 percent
of the state's income _ were handled directly by Doe, said Amos
Sawyer, an exiled Liberian political scientist who heads a dissident
organization in the United States.
   Doe uses these funds to cater to various whims, Sawyer said. For
example, when Liberia's soccer team beat Ghana last year, Doe
declared a national holiday and gave the team $1 million.
   But Berger said Doe also used the money for public works projects
and to pay back official bank loans.
   Doe has not protested the recent setbacks in relations with
Washington, said U.S. Embassy spokesman David Krecke in a telephone
conversation from Monrovia.
   But there is concern that Doe may renew past threats against U.S.
communications facilities and military access rights, officials
said. They spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Liberia experts say he has not acted on these threats in the past
because too much of his economy depends on American investments.
   The United States has been the bulwark of Liberia's economy,
pouring $434 million in financial aid between 1980 and 1986. There
also is some $400 million worth of private U.S. investment in
Liberia, much of it in rubber plantations, iron ore mining and
forestry.
   The United States maintains a relay station for Voice of America
broadcasts to Africa and southern Europe, officials said. There is
also a diplomatic communications facility that handles traffic from
U.S. posts in Africa to the United States.
   The U.S. Coast Guard is involved in running a tracking station
for navigation in the region, officials said.
   Economic aid to Liberia, which suffers from a crushing debt
burden and foreign exchange shortages, was frozen last year after
the State Department failed to certify that the country had made
progress in rectifying human rights abuses, officials said.
   As a result, Congress has so far withheld $22 million in aid _
about one-third of the funds allotted to Liberia, according to AID.
   The State Department's recently released report on human rights
says Liberia's record ``was set back in 1988 by several adverse
developments,'' including the unexplained deaths of several men
while in detention for unsubstantiated charges of plotting a coup.

<HEAD>Six Months After Strikes, Miners Fear Solidarity Might Not be Enough</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JASTRZEBIE, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six months ago, angry miners shut down
the deep coal mines ringing this desolate city in southern Poland to
demand the government recognize Solidarity.
   Now the miners seem to be within reach of their goal, but some
fear that even a free trade union will not be enough to fight the
poverty that caused them to strike in the first place.
   Since Feb. 6, government and Solidarity representatives have been
talking in Warsaw, and they are near agreement on terms to reinstate
the union after a seven-year ban.
   Their eyes shadowed with coal dust, the miners talked quietly
last week while waiting to greet Solidarity leader Lech Walesa at
the Manifest Lipcowy mine, where the first strike began.
   ``Things haven't changed much. We don't know what it is we're
going to get and we don't know when,'' said Jan Pilat, whose job
during the strikes was to sound the alarm when police prepared to
rush the mine gates.
   Walesa came to Manifest Lipcowy to tell Solidarity activists how
the talks in Warsaw, 220 miles to the north, were proceeding.
   Local union leader Alojzy Pietrzyk calls Jastrzebie, a city of
just more than 100,000 people, a ``concrete reservation.''
   But in the 1960s and '70s, thousands of workers flocked to
Jastrzebie, attracted by the promise of good wages and housing in
the new apartments the government had slapped together.
   In its haste to attract workers to mine the nearby rich lodes of
black coal, the government left a few things out.
   Stores are few and poorly stocked. A couple of restaurants and a
few movie theaters and discos can be found hidden among the high
rises.
   Now there is a housing shortage and young miners are forced to
spend years living in workers' hotels.
   ``There is nothing to do and nothing to buy,'' said one miner,
Alfred Rutkowski. ``Things are really hard and I don't think they'll
get better.''
   What bothers miners most is a pay system that forces them to work
for bonus money on Saturday and Sunday to earn enough to survive,
and primitive working conditions that claimed the lives of 85 miners
in Poland last year.
   It was disgust over management's failure to honor raises
negotiated by the official trade union alliance OPZZ that led to the
strike at Manifest Lipcowy when miners opened their pay envelopes
Aug. 15.
   The strike spread rapidly to other mines in Poland, and the No. 1
demand became the reinstatement of Solidarity, the East bloc's first
free trade union. It had operated legally for 16 months before being
outlawed in 1982.
   Walesa agreed to suspend the strikes when authorities proposed
talks with the opposition and promised to include Solidarity's
future on the agenda.
   But the coal miners were skeptical and it took a visit from
Walesa and hours of hard bargaining to persuade them to stop the
strike on its 19th day.
   The miners see Solidarity as the only means by which they can
present grievances in negotiations with management.
   During his visit Tuesday, Walesa told miners: ``I know you are
tired with your work, these conditions, with what is happening on
the market, with your families, but I would like to talk to you
without censorship so I could understand my mistakes and your
strivings.''
   The workers asked Walesa how he could trust the government. He
said he lacked specific answers but urged the miners to help rebuild
Poland.
   ``Everything shows now there is a civilized solution ... We have
to have a bit of responsibility,'' he said.
   ``I appeal to you to build organizations. ... There are so many
problems. You have to approach them in an organized way,'' Walesa
said.
   Solidarity regional leader Adam Kowalczyk needed no pep talk.
While some workers hounded Walesa for autographs after the meeting,
Kowalczyk scurried around and pressed miners to take freshly printed
Solidarity sign-up sheets.
   ``Management says they still don't want to talk to us, but they
aren't stopping us from organizing and there is a lot to do,'' said
Kowalczyk.

   The National Weather Service is struggling
through a budget crunch, hoping to delay the threatened closing of
weather offices until they can be replaced by new automated
equipment in a few years.
   Over the long term the agency seems likely to close a hundred or
more of its nearly 250 local offices, replacing them with an
extensive network of automated information-gathering equipment.
   But even as that planning is underway, officials are trying to
cope with a money shortage in the current fiscal year that could
grow even more severe in 1990.
   The Reagan administration annually has proposed closing large
numbers of weather offices to save money.
   And although Congress has thwarted that in the past, a hiring
freeze has had to be imposed this year and some local offices may be
in jeopardy because of the lack of money.
   The current fiscal year is expected to end with the weather
service short between $10 million and $28 million, although National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials who spoke on
condition of anonymity said things are looking brighter than they
were a few weeks ago.
   NOAA spending proposed by former President Reagan for 1990,
meanwhile, was set at $1.14 billion, down from $1.19 billion in the
current fiscal year.
   And while the National Weather Service was marked for somewhat of
an increase within that budget, that has to include money to cover
the purchase of new radar and observation equipment and a
supercomputer.
   The Reagan proposal called for staff cuts, consolidations of
offices and for private weather services to take on more specialized
forecasting tasks, while the government concentrates on general
forecasts and warnings.
   Full details of the Reagan proposal were not released by the
Office of Management and Budget, but word on Capitol Hill was that
the plan could have required closing as many as 62 local weather
offices this year and 77 more in 1990.
   Congressional sources said the Bush administration may be
reconsidering whether such drastic cuts are necessary. NOAA
officials said they are discussing with OMB ways to keep offices
open, but details were not being made public.
   However, the two pages slated to include the list of station
closings were left blank when the 1990 NOAA budget was sent to the
printers, according to Warren Kane of the Senate Appropriations
subcommittee that oversees NOAA.
   Some closings may occur in cases of obvious duplication where
stations are relatively close together, he said.
   Once new automated equipment is in place, more extensive office
closings will be easier to defend because weather forecasting would
not be hindered, NOAA officials say. But that would occur over
several years, perhaps as long as a decade.
   NOAA officials say the automated observing equipment is planned
for installation in three times as many locations as there are
currently weather offices.
   The National Weather Service Employees Organization, however, has
said that the closings eventually could affect a hundred offices or
more.
   And NOAA officials privately admit that after the reorganization
is complete they expect to have fewer than 150 local offices,
compared to the current 250 or so. Reductions in staff would occur
by attrition, they say.
   The long-term, the Weather Service modernization plan was
originally scheduled to be sent to Congress last week but that has
been delayed.
   A complicating factor is the fact that many top officials of the
Commerce Department leave office March 1, and others remain on the
job but unsure whether they will be transferred or replaced.
   The Office of Management and Budget says the NOAA budget is part
of a group of domestic programs frozen at 1989 levels, included in a
$136 billion ``pot'' of programs subject to negotiation with
Congress.

   CBS is blitzing the other networks' coverage of
Emperor Hirohito's funeral and President Bush's trip to the Far East
this week, taking most of its news broadcasts to Japan at a cost of
at least $2 million.
   ABC, NBC and CNN also will be on location for Hirohito's funeral.
Bush will attend the funeral Thursday in Tokyo, then he goes to
China and Korea.
   At a news conference last week, ``Evening News'' anchor Dan
Rather called the coverage ``unprecedented'' by broadcast news, but
warranted by Hirohito's death as a symbol of ``the end of the
postwar era.''
   ABC's Peter Jennings will anchor ``ABC World News Tonight'' from
Tokyo all week. NBC's Tom Brokaw will anchor ``NBC Nightly News''
from Tokyo on Thursday and Friday, then from Beijing on Saturday and
Sunday. CNN's Bernard Shaw and Mary Alice Williams will anchor live
coverage of the funeral from Tokyo.
   The networks have all focused on Japan's culture and economy in
reports leading up to the funeral and Bush's trip.
   CBS, which began on-location coverage Sunday with ``CBS Sunday
Morning,'' also is taking the ``CBS Evening News,'' ``CBS This
Morning,'' ``48 Hours'' and ``Face the Nation'' to Japan. The
coverage concludes next Sunday with ``Face the Nation'' from Beijing.
   The broadcasts will focus on Japan's relationship to the United
States in terms of economy, lifestyles and military interdependence.
   CBS' ``48 Hours'' will have live coverage of the beginning of the
funeral Thursday night, when it will be Friday morning in Japan.
   CBS News figures it will have 18 hours of special coverage from
the Far East at a cost of at least $2 million, Rather said.
   ``We thought long and hard about whether should make this kind of
commitment to this story at this time,'' he said. ``This is a gamble
for us.''
   ``But we think in this particular case we can make it work,'' he
said.

   They met in the Maine Legislature on the
Republican side of the aisle, the raven-haired representative from
Auburn seated directly behind the handsome young floor leader from
Bangor.
   When she decided to run for Congress in 1978, they got together
to map out campaign strategy. Over the years their shared interest
in politics blossomed into something more.
   The decade-long courtship between Rep. Olympia Snowe and Gov.
John R. McKernan will culminate this week in an exchange of marriage
vows.
   ``What holds our relationship together is the fact that we love
politics,'' said Snowe, now in her sixth term in Congress. ``For
some, that becomes a dividing factor, but in our case that obviously
hasn't been the situation.''
   ``We both have our own careers and they happen to be in the same
field,'' said McKernan, a former two-term congressman who was
elected governor in 1986. ``We understand the pressures that are on
each other.''
   The wedding Friday at the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy
Trinity in Lewiston _ Snowe is of Greek descent _ will begin the
second marriage for both.
   The announcement of their pending nuptials three weeks ago evoked
surprise that two of a small state's most prominent political
figures could have kept a romance of nearly a decade relatively
private.
   ``A hush-hush affair,'' marveled one of Snowe's constituents,
Frances Boisvert of Lewiston. ``Nobody seemed to know anything about
it. But it's nice.''
   Snowe, who turns 42 on Tuesday, was widowed in 1973 when her
husband was killed in an accident while driving home from the
Legislature, where he served in the House. She entered politics by
running successfully for his seat.
   The 40-year-old McKernan's first marriage ended in divorce in
1978. He has an 18-year-old son, Peter.
   McKernan and Snowe realize they will spend most of their time 600
miles apart, one in Washington, the other in the state capital of
Augusta, getting together on weekends and during congressional
recesses.
   They will try, as much as possible, to coordinate their schedules
and expect to divide their time between the Blaine House _ the
executive mansion in Augusta _ and Snowe's home in Auburn, 35 miles
away.
   ``The most important factor in any relationship is
communication,'' Snowe said, describing their daily telephone
conversations. ``Talking about what happens during the day to each
of us makes it feel we're not that far away.''
   Snowe and McKernan said they believe their careers will insulate
them from the problems of other politicians whose marriages broke
because they were unable to balance their political responsibilities
with the demands of family life.
   In other marriages, McKernan noted, ``only one of them is
involved in politics, and the other one gets left behind a lot.''
   They acknowledge their differences in personality. He is
deliberate, an outgrowth of his legal training; she tends to rely
more heavily on instinct.
   The romance blossomed while the two were in Washington, serving
as Maine's delegation in the House. Their private joke on their
trips home: ``Your district or mine?''
   The relationship was never splashed across the front pages, but
neither was it concealed. Whenever the subject was broached by
reporters, Snowe and McKernan acknowledged that they dated each
other but offered no elaboration.
   The reaction to their engagement has been positive, they said,
with congratulatory calls from President and Barbara Bush and
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. Referring to his and Snowe's
shared ethnic background, Dukakis told McKernan that ``mixed
marriages work _ especially if one of the partners is Greek.''
McKernan is a Protestant.
   Their honeymoon will be a weekend in New York with dinner and the
theater. Both must be in Washington the following week, Snowe to
tend to her congressional duties and McKernan for a meeting of the
nation's governors.
   While the wedding itself will be limited to family members and
close friends, the couple mailed invitations to 7,500 friends and
political supporters for a reception the following week at the
Augusta Civic Center.

   Rep. John Lewis, a liberal Democrat and black
veteran of the civil rights wars of the 60s, is willing to put his
enthusiasm for white conservative Republican Jack Kemp in the
language understood on the poor street corners of America.
   ``He can walk the walk, and he can talk the talk,'' Lewis said
recently of the Bush administration's housing chief.
   Lewis' deliberate use of an expression more familiar in the black
neighborhoods he represents than in the white suburbs that produced
Kemp was meant to communicate. The meaning was clear: Despite their
differences, this man Kemp is OK. He's all right.
   Lewis's comment last week came after two days of tramping with
the former pro quarterback through those Atlanta neighborhoods in
Kemp's first look at inner city problems since becoming secretary of
the Housing and Urban Development.
   Kemp went one-on-one with Atlanta's black leaders and veterans of
the civil rights struggle of the 1950s and 60s _ such as Lewis,
Mayor Andrew Young and the family of the late Martin Luther King Jr.
_ offering them his own brand of bubbly, irrepressible excitement
about the power of unleashed free enterprise.
   All welcomed him warmly and seemed to confirm what Kemp's
supporters were arguing during his unsuccessfully presidential
campaign last year: Kemp, architect of the 1981 income tax cuts now
so identified with Ronald Reagan, has a strong reservoir of good
will among blacks.
   ``We have serious problems, as you well understand,'' Coretta
Scott King, widow of the late civil rights leader, told him. ``You
lift our spirits because you have hope they can be solved.''
   Taking control of HUD, Kemp heads a department important for
urban blacks because it administers the federal programs for housing
and redevelopment of blighted cities _ programs that are
dramatically reduced after eight years under President Reagan. Kemp
hopes to make HUD the catalyst for new incentives to attract private
development into those same neighborhoods.
   Kemp's support among blacks could be of benefit to the new
administration and to the Republican Party, as Bush and new
Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater set out to win black
support away from Democrats. And it could benefit Kemp in the future.
   ``There's no question that a candidate who can attract the
support of rock-ribbed conservatives and urban blacks would make one
hell of a candidate,'' said Kemp's political consultant, Roger Stone.
   Kemp himself tried to sidestep the political questions. ``That is
tangential,'' he said. ``The best politics is to do a good job.''
   Many cite Kemp's background in professional football, where was
quarterback, team captain and president of the players' union, as a
source of black support. He has maintained friendships with
prominent blacks, and has hired Wendell Wilkie Gunn, a black
conservative and former Reagan White House aide, as his chief of
staff.
   ``He knows his safety and indeed his life depended on the ability
of black linemen,'' said the Rev. Joseph E. Lowery, head of the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
   But it is also due to Kemp's enthusiastic talk about doing
something to solve the housing problem facing the poor. More than
just his proposals for enterprise zones and other inducements to
attract private business into the inner cities, Kemp has raised
expectations just by talking about making progress on housing. That
trait is even more noticeable coming on the heels of a relative
eight-year silence by his predecessor, Sam Pierce.
   ``He has the kind of creative mind that I admire,'' Young, a
Democrat and former congressman, said. ``Right now, things are so
bad that we've got to work together and solve problems. We can get

with the highest visibility on domestic policy in the
administration. He was trailed through Atlanta's streets by a bus
full of reporters and television cameras. He plans a second tour
next week, of homelessness in Northeastern cities.
   But Kemp's high visibility and bold talk carries risk.
   He is given to sweeping statements and boundless expectations,
which Democrats are no doubt recording for replay in four years if
he falls short.
   ``I want to eliminate poverty,'' Kemp told one group in Atlanta.
``There's not going to be any homelessness unless we turn our backs
and let it happen,'' he told another.
   Kemp has acknowledged the need for more affordable housing,
without promising any more federal spending to build it. Bush's
budget proposal for fiscal 1990 contains no new spending on public
housing, and the budget deficit provides little reason for housing
advocates to expect even Kemp can come up with new spending
initiatives.
   Some Democrats have begun to suggest that Kemp, with his
visibility and big talk, has overplayed his hand.
   ``He has clearly upstaged the president, and that is usually not
smart politics,'' Democratic Party spokesman Mike McCurry said.
   ``He runs the risk of overpromising himself early,'' McCurry
added. ``He's setting himself up for a long fall.''
   Mrs. King seemed to be offering Kemp a similar caution as well
when they met with the city's black leaders.
   ``From everything we've heard you say, we think you mean
business,'' she said. ``If something happens and there is not the
follow through, you're going to have a lot of disappointed people.''

<TEXT>
   A major opposition candidate on
Saturday kicked off his presidential campaign and promised improved
social and political rights for women.
   ``The beginning has begun toward a better Panama, of light,
fraternity, peace and abundance, where democracy, justice and
liberty exists,'' said Guillermo Endara, presidential candidate for
the Democratic Civilian Opposition Alliance.
   Endara, a 52-year-old attorney, spoke Saturday at a women's
convention organized by opposition party members. Presidential
elections are scheduled for May 7.
   Endara promised to improve the rights of Panamanian women. He
said that to beat the government-backed coalition in the election,
he would follow a program of ``democratic convictions and social
justice.''
   The government-supported National Liberation Coalition candidate
is Carlos Duque. Also running for the presidency is Hildebrando
Nicosia of the Authentic Panamanian Party.
   Endara previously was spokesman for Arias Madrid, a three-time
Panamanian president who ran three more times and lost. During two
of the unsuccessful bids, Madrid claimed victory was stolen from him
by election fraud.
   The opposition wants to use the elections to oust Panama's de
facto ruler, army commander Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Noriega is not a candidate in the presidential elections.
   Noriega has been in power since February 1988 when he
orchestrated the ouster of President Eric Arturo Delvalle. Delvalle
had tried to fire Noriega in the wake of his federal indictment in
Florida on drug charges.

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A CBS affiliate isn't inviting the network
back to its newsroom next Mardi Gras because the network's report
focused on the city's crime problem and was ``misleading and very
superficial,'' the affiliate's news director said.
   ``Our video files will not be open to CBS, nor will any editing
facilities or satellite equipment be available. Any story you do,
you will do on your own. You won't have our help,'' Joe Duke, news
director of local affiliate WWL, said in a letter to CBS News
President David Burk.
   Duke wrote to protest a report on ``CBS Evening News'' done by
correspondent Peter Van Zant during Mardi Gras earlier this month.
   The report ``began with a brief mention of our Mardi Gras
celebration, and juxtaposed that with a series of murder scenes and
a long discussion of our crime problems,'' Duke wrote.
   Although there has been an increase in murders this year, Duke
said that ``to combine the elements of Mardi Gras and the crime
problem in a very quick piece creates a simplistic, misleading and
very superficial look at our city and in no way reflects what the
community is doing to solve the problem.''
   George Schweitzer, a network spokesman in New York, said Saturday
he was not familiar with the situation and could not comment. He
referred calls to another spokesman, but a message left on his
telephone answering machine wasn't returned.
   New Orleans had almost a slaying a day during January and police
said they found the body of the 34th victim of the year Saturday.
Police have blamed the increase on drugs.
   City Council, which had sent its own letter of complaint to CBS,
commended Duke for his strong protest and asked residents to boycott
CBS programming for two weeks.
   Duke thanked the council but asked viewers to delay the boycott
until after the ratings period in March. Those ratings are used to
set advertising rates.

   President Corazon Aquino told new
officers Sunday to shun coup plots and urged them to crush communist
rebels and other ``enemies of freedom'' who refuse to settle
disputes with her government peacefully.
   ``Those who sapped the strength of this country will ask you to
join them in exploiting its weaknesses,'' Mrs. Aquino told 113
graduating cadets during commencement exercises at the Philippine
Military Academy, 150 miles north of Manila.
   ``Ignore them,'' she ordered. ``Ignore them out of patriotism,
ingore them out of prudence. This country, this government and this
leader have more strength than appearances suggest.''
   Graduates of the nation's only military academy spearheaded the
six armed attempts to topple Mrs. Aquino since she took power in the
February 1986 civilian-military uprising against President Ferdinand
Marcos.
   Troops here and in Manila were placed on maximum alert in advance
of Sunday's commencement because of rumors that right-wing
extremists would launch a new coup attempt.
   Hundreds of troops, some of them flown here from Manila, guarded
strategic points near the mountain-top academy. Bomb-sniffing dogs
checked cadets before the ceremony began under brillantly clear
skies.
   In March 1987, a bomb exploded on the academy parade ground a few
days before the commencement, killing four people and injuring nine
others. Mrs. Aquino said the bomb was intended for her.
   In her speech, Mrs. Aquino told the cadets it was their duty to
protect democratic gains from both communist rebels and right-wing
extremists in their ranks.
   ``Fight them wherever they appear and threaten our people, our
work that we are striving to make of this country,'' she said.
   She challenged the cadets to join with civilian authorities in
healing the nation's wounds and building democracy.
   ``To the enemies of freedom, the armed opponents of our
government on the left and the right, I address these words: Let us
sit down and try to settle our differences by talk,'' she said.
``And if we cannot, by all means, let us do so by arms. But let us
not infect the next generation in civil society and in the armed
forces with narrow causes and hatreds of the past.''

<HEAD>Republican National Committee Seeks to Censure David Duke</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Republican National Committee said it will
seek to censure David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader who won a
seat in the Louisiana state Legislature, saying he is a
``charlatan'' who does not reflect GOP principles.
   ``David Duke is not a Republican,'' RNC Chairman Lee Atwater said
in a statement released by the party. ``He's a pretender, a
charlatan and a political opportunist who is looking for any
organization he can find to try to legitimize his views of racial
and religious bigotry and intolerance.''
   ``We repudiate him in his views and we will take steps to see
that he is disenfranchised from our party if he is declared the
official winner in Saturday's election,'' Atwater said.
   ``What does it take to be a Republican, other than registering
yourself as a Republican? I think he's (Atwater) typical of some the
Republican leadership....in that he doesn't really have his finger
on the pulse of the people, and know what a real Republican is,''
Duke's campaign manager Howie Farrell told The Associated Press in a
broadcast interview.
   ``I think that he's way off base, and needs to reassess where he
stands. When the dust settles, I think he'll find that he's probably
further out of the mainstream of Republicanism than is David Duke.''
   In unofficial results Saturday night, Duke narrowly defeated
homebuilder John Treen to represent a state House district in
Metairie, a suburb of New Orleans. Duke registered with the GOP two
days before qualifying to run in the House race. Treen also is a
member of the Republican Party.
   RNC spokeswoman Leslie Goodman said that if Duke is officially
certified the winner, Atwater will call a meeting of the party's
executive committee within the next week to consider a motion of
censure against Duke.
   The motion proposes that the Republican Party ``reject and
condemn David Duke, his beliefs and the hate and fear he promotes,
and reaffirm its commitment to equal opportunity for all regardless
of race, creed, religion, sex or national origin.''
   It also would preclude Duke from receiving any type of aid from
the Republican Party. Such an action would be unprecedented within
the party, Ms. Goodman said, adding, ``I would not imagine that
there would be a single person (on the RNC executive committee) who
would disagree with this.''
   Atwater, speaking in Atlanta at a Georgia Republican Party
function Saturday night, acknowledged the party's involvement in the
Louisiana race ``is a very unusual thing for the national party to
do, but this man does not deserve to be in office.''
   President Bush and former President Reagan both aided Treen's
campaign.

   The takeoff of a British Airways flight to London
was delayed here for more than five hours Saturday night by a bomb
threat.
   British Airways officials halted Flight 226 minutes before its
scheduled 6:15 p.m. departure after an unidentified man called the
airline's New York office and told officials there was a bomb aboard
the DC-10, said John W. Lample, the airline's director of public
affairs in the United States.
   Lample said no explosives were found in a 5-hour search and the
aircraft carrying 122 passengers left Hartsfield Atlanta
International Airport for London's Gatwick Airport at 11:41 p.m.
   ``I don't know the actual conversation, but since specific
threats were made against a specific flight, we took it seriously,''
Lample said. ``It is our policy to take such threats very
seriously.''
   The passengers were taken off the plane while police and dogs
searched the aircraft and luggage, he said.
   British officials said they were taking very seriously telephone
threats made in recent days to British Airways' Bombay office to
blow up a jetliner unless author Salman Rushdie emerges from
seclusion in Britain. Some Moslems have said Rushdie's book, ``The
Satanic Verses,'' blasphemes Islam.
   British officials have been checking all bags to the airline's
flights to and from Asia.

   David Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku
Klux Klan, narrowly defeated homebuilder John Treen to win a seat
Saturday in the Louisiana Legislature after a campaign peppered with
charges of racism.
   Duke had 8,456 votes, or 51 percent, and Treen had 8,232 votes,
or 49 percent _ a scant 224-vote difference.
   Duke hailed his victory as ``the greatest upset in the history of
Louisiana politics.''
   ``I don't think there's been a candidate in recent history who
has been more attacked, slandered, lied about and hurt in the way I
was hurt, and our good people were hurt, in this campaign,'' he said
in a victory speech.
   Duke, 38, and Treen, 63, battled it out for a month to represent
the almost all-white House district in Metairie, a New Orleans
suburb with about 21,000 voters. Both men ran as Republicans.
   Treen called Duke ``a disaster for our area.''
   ``I know what this man really is,'' he said. ``The public ...
doesn't or they wouldn't have voted the way they did. He's a master
of deception. He conned them into believing he is something he is
not.''
   Fearing a Duke victory and an embarrassment for the GOP,
President Bush and former President Reagan threw their considerable
weight behind Treen, a longtime party functionary.
   Nearly 78 percent of the voters turned out for the runoff
election.
   GOP Chairman Lee Atwater denounced Duke in a statement issued
Saturday night by Leslie Goodman, spokeswoman for the Republican
National Committee.
   ``David Duke is not a Republican,'' Atwater said. ``He's a
pretender, a charlatan and a political opportunist who is looking
for any organization he can find to try to legitimize his views of
racial and religious bigotry and intolerance.
   ``We repudiate him in his views and we are taking immediate steps
to see that he is disenfranchised from our party.''
   Goodman said that if Duke is certified the winner, Atwater will
call a meeting of the GOP executive committee to present a formal
motion for censure, which Goodman said would be an unprecedented
action.
   Asked about Atwater's remarks, Duke said: ``He can't do that. Who
does he think he is? The people have spoken.''
   Three of the candidates who lost in the primary have said they
would file a lawsuit if Duke won, challenging whether he lived in
the district for a year, as required by state law.
   Democrat State Rep. Ron Gomez said Duke's election would probably
be challenged by the legislature on the residency issue.
   Howie Farrell, Duke's campaign manager, said his camp was
concerned that Treen's supporters might try to tamper with voting
machines before the result is certified.
   ``All they gotta do is flip a button here, a button there, and
it's a new race,'' he said.
   Duke won 33 percent of the vote to lead a field of seven in the
Jan. 21 primary. Treen got 19 percent.
   Under Louisiana's open primary system, the top two vote-getters
in a primary, regardless of party, face each other in a runoff if no
candidate receives more than half the vote. The seat opened up when
Metairie's representative was elected to a judgeship with about
three years left in a four-year term.
   The election returned the spotlight to Duke, who in the 1970s was
photographed in a Nazi uniform and boldly removed the hood of his
white robe to become an international spokesman for the Klan.
   It's an era that Duke claimed to be sorry for, but Treen said he
didn't believe that.
   ``I regret it because... people might think I'm racially or
religiously intolerant,'' Duke said.
   Duke left the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in 1980, accused by
another leader of selling secret membership rolls. He formed the
National Association for the Advancement of White People, which he
says is a civil rights organization for everyone.
   The final days of the race brought renewed charges that Duke
still was associated with right-wing extremists, including
ex-American Nazi leader Ralph Forbes of Arkansas. Duke acknowledged
Forbes had been campaign manager in his 1988 bid for the presidency
as a member of the Populist Party.
   In the general election, he ran in 15 states and drew less than
.05 percent of the national total vote.
   He began his presidential bid as a Democrat but was repudiated by
party officials. He got no delegates at the Democratic National
Convention.
   Two days before qualifying for the House race, he registered with
the GOP, but the Republican National Committee also rejected him.
   Fearful the charismatic Duke would overshadow the mild-mannered
Treen, the committee enlisted their top two politicians in the 11th
hour of the campaign _ Bush and Reagan _ to try to keep Duke from
going to the Legislature as a member of their party.
   The backing from Bush and Reagan is unprecedented in a local
legislative race, state and national GOP officials said. Locally, an
archbishop, senators, a university president and Democrats voiced
their support for Treen or their opposition to Duke.
   Letters from Bush promoting Treen's candidacy arrived at most
homes in the district by election day.
   ``I can't help but tell you of the high regard I have for one
candidate in the race for the 81st district _ John Treen,'' Reagan
said in the heavily played radio spot.
   The race also attracted international attention, with reporters
from British, Dutch, French, West German and other foreign
newspapers covering it.
   Treen was state campaign chairman for Bush's 1980 presidential
bid. His brother, Dave, was Louisiana governor from 1980 to 1984. He
also was a member of the State's Rights Party of Louisiana in the
1950s, which he said was not formed as a racist group although many
members were segregationists.
   ``I left that behind a long time ago,'' Treen said.
   Despite the celebrity of the race, Louisiana property taxes
remained a key issue.
   Duke promised to reject any attempts to reduce the state's
$75,000 homestead exemption. Treen supports Gov. Buddy Roemer's
plans to revise the state tax code, plans that could include raising
property taxes by reducing the homestead exemption.

   A bus skidded out of control on a
rain-slickened highway and rolled over Saturday, killing four
passengers and injuring 20, four critically, authorities said.
   ``It rolled over about two times, tossing victims out through the
windows,'' said paramedic William Stover, the first to arrive after
the 3:45 a.m. crash.
   Only four people managed to stay inside the vehicle, and one of
those died of injuries sustained as the bus tumbled, he said.
   Four of the injured, including a 5-year-old girl, were in
critical condition and were transported to Corpus Christi hospitals
by helicopter and ambulances.
   The accident happened as the bus rounded a curve about six to
seven miles south of Falfurrias on U.S. Highway 281, Stover said.
   Officials were trying to determine what caused the Valley Transit
Company bus to crash, but were sure that the wet roadway was a
factor.
   ``We did have rainy weather,'' said Melinda Williams, a
dispatcher for the Brooks County sheriff's department in Falfurrias,
about 60 miles southwest of Corpus Christi. ``It was pretty bad out
there.''
   Survivors were lying on the ground all around the damaged bus,
Stover said.
   ``It was a mess,'' Stover said. He said he spoke to a man and
woman who sustained minor cuts. ``They both told me the bus slid
sideways into the ditch, rolled once, and then the bus continued on
over again,'' he said.
   Killed in the crash was Paul Salinas, 20, and Concepcion Rubio,
whose age wasn't known, Stover said. Families of the other two
victims _ a man and a woman _ had not been contacted by authorities
and their identities were withheld.

<HEAD>Nixon Friends Reportedly Urged To Stonewall TV Version Of `The Final

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An aide has urged former President Nixon's friends
to stonewall it when producers ask for help in making a television
version of the book ``The Final Days,'' a newspaper reported.
   Nixon reportedly hated the book by Bob Woodward and Carl
Bernstein, which gave a detailed account of the last days in the
Watergate-battered White Hous, and blames it for a stroke suffered
by his wife, Pat.
   In a memo to a few dozen Nixon loyalists, aide John Taylor said
ABC is asking for help on a ``film about the Nixon presidency''
without saying the project is based on ``The Final Days,'' The Miami
Herald reported Saturday.
   ``Because of the singularly odious and vicious nature of this
project, we are asking everyone, in deference to the Nixon family,
to refuse to have anything to do either with this project or indeed
for the time being with ABC,'' Taylor wrote.
   ``It may well be that the producers wish to recruit other of
President Nixon's friends and family and are therefore covering up
the true nature of the project as long as possible,'' the memo says.
``They must be aware of the reaction that they would get from RN
loyalists at the mention of the book's title.''
   Woodward, who is helping with the movie, says there's no cover-up
on the producers' part.
   ``This is the classic enemies-list mentality that led to all the
trouble,'' Woodward said Friday. ``My question to Mr. Taylor is:
Don't they ever learn?''

   President Najib declared a nationwide
state of emergency Saturday and replaced seven non-party members of
Cabinet in moves apparently aimed at consolidating his party's power.
   Najib blamed U.S. aid to Afghan guerrillas in part for the state
of emergency, which sharply reins in civil liberties.
   The emergency was announced on state-run radio and television by
Najib, who said it was needed ``to ensure peace and security'' in
Afghanistan.
   It came three days after the last Soviet soldiers, who had been
backing Najib's army in its war with Moslem guerrillas, left the
country.
   On Saturday night, Dari-language television and radio announced
Najib's shakeup of seven non-party members of 28-member Cabinet, a
move confirmed by the government Sunday.
   Replaced were the ministers of higher education, commerce,
education, light industries and foodstuffs, public health, civil
aviation and repatriation.
   Najib, however, appointed a non-party member to become minister
for Islamic affairs, a post that had been created in October but was
vacant. Five other posts are held by non-members of Najib's People's
Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
   The government also ordered 500 party members in Kabul to report
for military duty in an effort to maintain security in the capital.
   During the day Saturday, troops, tanks and armored personnel
carriers appeared at most intersections in Kabul, and soldiers were
stationed on the roofs of buildings.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani told foreign
journalists that under the state of emergency, troops would have the
right to open fire if they believed reporters or photographers were
behaving suspiciously.
   The city of 2.25 million people remained relatively calm. But
guerrillas surround Kabul, and many diplomats believe the government
will collapse shortly.
   In Islamabad, Pakistan, Afghan guerrilla leaders nominated
Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi as acting president and Ahmad Shah as acting
prime minister of an interim government that would take over if
Najib's government fell.
   A special council of 400 delegates was to formally approve the
appointments Sunday.
   Afghan government radio reported that five people were killed and
four injured Saturday in rocket attacks mounted by Moslem guerrillas
in various parts of Afghanistan.
   The state of emergency allows the government to suspend or limit
constitutional rights that protect against confiscation of property
and searches of property; provide for confidentiality of
corresondence and telephone conversations; allow peaceful assembly
and demonstrations; protect freedom of expression; and provide for
freedom from compulsory labor.
   Najib said the emergency was ``temporary,'' but he did not set a
time limit. Under the constitution, an emergency can last three
months but can be extended with the consent of the National Assembly.
   Amani said clandestine activities that were terrorizing the
Afghan people prompted the declaration. Speaking at a news briefing,
he said these activities included the circulation of ``night
letters'' _ unsigned pamphlets warning residents to stay off the
streets, close their businesses, and stay away from the airport.
   ``These created an air in which people were being terrified of a
rocket attack on Kabul,'' Amani said.
   Amani also said the refusal of the United States and Pakistan to
halt the supply of arms to the rebels made the state of emergency
necessary.
   A state of emergency has been imposed in Afghanistan once before,
in 1978, after the communists seized power in a military coup. It
was lifted in 1979, the same year Soviet troops intervened in the
civil war.
   The Soviets announced all their troops had been withdrawn
Wednesday, the deadline set by a U.N.-mediated accord signed last
year. The guerrillas were not a party to the accord and have vowed
to overthrow Najib's government.
   The constitution allows the government to declare an emergency
when it deems that the country's independence, sovereignty,
territorial integrity and internal security are impossible to
maintain due to war, danger of war, disturbances of war or similar
conditions.

   Police raided the home of black
activist Winnie Mandela on Sunday and said they took fingerprints
and found traces of blood. Four of her bodyguards were arrested.
   Brig. Gen. Jaap Joubert, who is heading the investigation into
the death of a 14-year-old black activist who was allegedly abducted
and beaten at the house, said the fingerprints and blood samples
would be tested.
   Police also took bags of clothes belonging to her bodyguards,
four of whom were arrested.
   More than 20 policemen with rifles surrounded and guarded the
house during the eight-hour search.
   Police searched through Mrs. Mandela's belongings, but did not
take any of them, said a journalist at the scene.
   Joubert, who directed the search, is also investigating the
disappearance of two young men last seen in the company of Mrs.
Mandela's bodyguards in November, and the slaying of a Soweto doctor
who is reported to have seen the 14-year-old boy after he was beaten.
   Police spokesman Col. L.J. Haasbroek said two people had been
arrested in connection with the doctor's slaying, but would not say
whether they were among the four bodyguards detained Sunday. He
would not elaborate.
   The Rev. Frank Chikane, general-secretary of the South African
Council of Churches, said Saturday that Mrs. Mandela had decided to
remove the young bodyguards from her home, after receiving such
orders from her husband, jailed African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela.
   The raid came one day after a minister said Mrs. Mandela agreed
to remove from her home bodyguards accused of abducting and beating
14-year-old Stompie Seipei.
   Mrs. Mandela, 54, is the wife of jailed African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela. He urged his wife to get rid of the
bodyguards during her visit Wednesday at a prison farm near Cape
Town, according to the Rev. Frank Chikane, general secretary of the
South African Council of Churches.
   Mandela, 70, has been imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life
sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government.
   Major anti-apartheid organizations in South Africa have
dissociated themselves from Mrs. Mandela, whom they accuse of
``complicity'' in the abduction and beating of the teen-ager.
   Mrs. Mandela, smiling and cheerful, came out to greet reporters
during the raid and offered them refreshments. She made no comment
when the raid ended. Her secretary said she was resting.
   Mrs. Mandela formed the Mandela United soccer club in 1986,
saying she wanted to provide recreation for youths congregating on
streets. But they grew into a organization of bodyguard who
antagonized the community.
   The ANC has referred to the soccer team's activities as
``unbecoming,'' whereas leaders in South Africa accused it of waging
a ``reign of terror'' in Soweto.
   The controversy over the soccer club came to a head last month
when three men told a community meeting of 150 top anti-apartheid
activists that the bodyguards had dragged them to the Mandela home
and beaten them. The men said Seipei was with them, but was hurt
more seriously and was taken away after two days.
   Mrs. Mandela has said she was not home when the abductions
occurred.

   A strong earthquake struck central and northern
Japan on Sunday night, shaking tall buildings and rattling windows
in downtown Tokyo. No damage or injuries were immediately reported,
the National Police Agency said.
   The quake, which occurred at 9:28 p.m. (7:28 a.m. EST), measured
5.6 on the Richter scale and was centered 60 miles north of Tokyo in
the town of Utsunomiya, the Meterological Agency said. The quake
shook all of northern Honshu, Japan's main island, the agency said.
   New Tokyo International Airport in Narita, 40 miles northeast of
Tokyo, closed its main runway to check for damage, but opened it 13
minutes later when no damage was found, officials there said.
   In The Associated Press office on the 11th floor of a building in
central Tokyo, plate glass windows rattled for about 30 seconds,
clocks wobbled on walls and chairs moved across the floor.
   Japan is in a very active seismological area and has had major
earthquakes in the past. The most serious one this century occurred
in 1923, when about 140,000 residents of Tokyo and neighboring
Yokohama died in a quake and fires.
   An earthquake measuring 5 on the Richter scale can cause
considerable damage. A temblor measuring 6 on the scale can cause
severe damage.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.

   Two children were killed and five were
seriously injured Sunday when a mine exploded while they were
playing with it, a police source said. The mine may have been sown
during a war between Israel and Egypt.
   The mine, which exploded in el-Arish, the capital of north Sinai,
killed 12-year-old Mohamed Mahmoud Ibrahim and his 6-year-old sister
Amal, the source said. Five children were hospitalized with serious
injuries, he said.
   The mine probably dated back from either the 1967 or the 1973
Arab-Israeli war, said the source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Explosions of hidden land mines are common, both in the Sinai and
in the western desert, which also was a battle zone in World War II.

Peter's Square.
   ``Let us all unite,'' he told the 25,000 people gathered in the

prayer every day.''
   Churches across the country have been praying for rain to end
what is considered Italy's worst drought in at least 50 years.
   Water rationing is in effect in several areas and agricultural
losses have been estimated at $1.5 billion.

   Workers who plan to excavate an old

virus, which has been declared eradicated worldwide, could still be
lurking underground.
   The director of the project, Malcolm Atkin, said the workers will
excavate the cemetery adjacent to the city's Old Infirmary hospital
in search of the remains of buildings from the Roman era to the 17th
century.
   The city council's excavation unit wants to explore the burial
ground before it is developed into a parking lot and shopping
center. Aiken said he has asked the developer for a donation to help
pay for the excavation.
   ``We have been advised by the Health and Safety Executive that
smallpox ... germs can stay alive underground indefinitely,'' said
Atkin. ``The site will be completely screened off from the public
during the dig.''
   The World Health Organization declared smallpox eradicated in
1980.

   Twenty Chinese lawmakers have condemned a
futuristic U.S. television cartoon as poison and urged the
government to ban broadcasts of ``The Transformers'' and its toy
characters, a report said Sunday.
   The legislators ``believe that the absurd ideological content of
`The Transformers,' especially its promotion uristic cartoon about robots
who can
alter their shapes to become cars, planes and weapons, and who
battle other evil robots.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said it has been shown on
Shanghai and Beijing television in translation, and several
publishing houses have issued picture books of characters from the
cartoon.
   U.S.-made toys of the cartoon characters also have been sold in
China for the ``excessively expensive'' price of about $270 per set
_ nearly as much as the average Chinese worker makes in a year, the
news agency said.
   The legislators who objected to the program and toys are members
of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, which
meets periodically between annual sessions of the full congress.
   The reports did not say if any government department had
responded to the appeal or if the legislators planned to push for
the whole congress to take some action on it.
   The congress has had a real voice in drafting and approving laws
only for the past few years, but legislation still is proposed by
government ministries or the ruling Communist Party, not individual
legislators.

<TEXT>
   Residents of the nation's second largest city
think violent crime, smog and traffic jams are lowering the quality
of life, according to a survey.
   About half of 2,046 residents polled said they considered moving
elsewhere in the past year because of the intangible slide in their
lifestyle, the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday.
   Sixty percent of those interviewed by telephone said life has
changed for the worse during the past 15 years. Only 17 percent
believe things have gotten better.
   Seventy-eight percent said crime is the metropolitan area's worst
problem and 46 percent said they do not feel safe walking in their
own neighborhoods at night.
   The newspaper survey was conducted during the second week of
February. The study has a 3 percent margin of error, said I.A.
Lewis, the poll director.
   Blacks were the most fearful of crime, with 95 percent
identifying it as the region's worst problem. Fifty-four percent of
blacks polled said they do not feel safe on their neighborhood
streets at night. Similar fears were voiced by 44 percent of the
whites surveyed, and 38 percent of the Hispanics.
   The poll showed increasing pessimism since a survey in March
1986, when 70 percent reported things were going well or fairly
well. Fifty-two percent said things were going well in the latest
survey.
   After crime, traffic congestion, air pollution and growing
population were the major issues targeted for criticism.
   Blacks, the minority group hardest hit by unemployment, also
cited the economy as a major problem.

<HEAD>Sex-Offender Clown Given Probation, Undergoing Self-Punishment Therapy</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Note contents.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A professional clown who admitted
trying to pay a teen-age boy to have sex with him has been given
probation with orders that he continue therapy including punishing
himself with ammonia or electric shock to inhibit such urges.
   The sentence given Friday to Marvin Matthow, 56, who works as a
clown at children's parties, was criticized by Deputy District
Attorney Karla Hansen, who sought a prison term because Matthow is a
two-time offender.
   While in prison for a similar sex offense, Hansen said, Matthow
advertised for boys, ostensibly to serve as apprentices, but
actually to use for sex.
   ``I don't think there is any way the court can ensure that young
boys won't be victimized by this defendant again,'' Hansen said
after court recessed.
   District Judge Richard Toth said the five-year probation term was
proper because the therapy Matthow has been undergoing is ``worse
punishment than anything our prison system offers.''
   Since November, when Matthow admitted asking a 17-year-old boy to
engage in sex for money, Matthow has been voluntarily under
treatment at the Behavioral Medicine Institute in Atlanta.
   His treatment includes sniffing ammonia or enduring an electric
shock whenever he has an urge to have sex with an adolescent male.
   At first, the treatment was supervised by the staff. Institute
officials say Matthow has progressed to where he is allowed to
inflict the punishment himself and document the punishment by tape
recording it.
   He is currently an outpatient at the institute, under
surveillance by institute staff who make sure he is acting normally,
institute officials said.
   The technique is widely recognized for treating people who are
attracted sexually to children, said Larry Lanzotti, the Colorado
Springs probation officer who recommended probation for Matthow.
   Atlanta psychiatrist Alfred Messer, who is nationally known for
his work with sex offenders, said of the institute's approach:
``It's OK. It's a good program.''

<TEXT>
   In the aftermath of a landmark, $21.75 million
jury award, Marc Christian thinks about his former lover, Rock
Hudson, and the question that haunts him still: ``Why did he do it?''
   Why did Hudson hide from Christian the secret that went to bed
with them for eight months: that the movie star had AIDS?
   ``I don't know why he did it,'' Christian reflected. ``He took
that to the grave with him. I don't know if he just couldn't face
the fact that he was dying. A lot of people don't believe in their
mortality when they're famous. You see your image up there on the
screen and maybe he thought he would live forever.''
   Or maybe, he said, Hudson was used to having others handle his
problems.
   ``He had been a star since he was 23. Everything in his life was
delegated,'' Christian said in an interview. ``I think he had some
help in making the decision not to tell me. But even if others were
trying to influence him, he should have been man enough to tell me.''
   Christian, 35, who sued Hudson's estate and secretary for
emotional distress, was awarded $14.5 million Wednesday and an
additional $7.25 million in punitive damages Friday.
   Born in Hollywood and raised in Southern California, Christian
thought of becoming a baseball player, tried being a rock musician
and, with his blond good looks, dabbled in acting and modeling. He
was working on a music history project and volunteering in political
campaigns when he met Hudson in 1982.
   He maintains that the actor's fame meant ``almost nothing'' to
him. Living in Hollywood, he had gone to high school with several
actors.
   ``Fame for me was a turnoff,'' he said. ``I had met a lot of
stars who were in love with themselves, and I had no idea if Rock
would be shallow.
   ``But the first time we spent in this apartment, listening to
music, I almost forgot he was famous. He was so really down to
earth. He made me feel at ease.''
   Later, when they became live-in lovers, he said, ``I didn't think
about the fame much. Sometimes it was fun to be caught in the
afterglow of it. We would go out to dinner and someone would ask him
for an autograph.''
   His sweet memories turn bitter when he discusses what he now
knows _ that Hudson concealed his AIDS diagnosis from him while they
continued to have sex.
   Hudson, 58, died on Oct. 5, 1985, three months after the public
and Christian learned he had the deadly, sexually transmittable
disease.
   ``He made a tragic decision not to tell me,'' said Christian.
``Aside from that he was a very nice, generous man. But it's
outrageous. I really resent the fact he didn't tell me.''
   Christian has tested negative for exposure to the AIDS virus but
said he fears contracting the disease. ``If I'm carrying AIDS, I'm
dead,'' he said. ``If I don't come down with it, he has put me
through three years of hell.''
   He has been celibate since he learned of Hudson's diagnosis, he
said.
   He said filing suit was traumatic. ``I initially asked the estate
for $300,000,'' Christian recalled. ``I said, `If I get AIDS, I have
no health insurance, and I'll need that,' but they refused.''
   Christian said the lawsuit's message is simple: People with AIDS
have a duty to warn their sexual partners.
   The jury's verdict probably will be appealed, but Christian said:
``The message has already gone out. The impact that jury had can't
be erased. Even if I don't get a dime out of it, it doesn't matter.''
   He vowed to contribute a large portion of his award to AIDS
groups, mainly hospices. ``Maybe I'll be able to do what Rock should
have done,'' he said.

<HEAD>Daley's Lead in Mayoral Race Narrowing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Increasing support from black voters has enabled
Mayor Eugene Sawyer to narrow the lead held by his rival in the
mayoral Democratic primary, Richard M. Daley, according to two new
polls.
   A poll conducted for the Chicago Sun-Times and WLS-TV found Daley
leading 50 percent to 38 percent, with 10 percent undecided and the
remaining 2 percent split among two minor candidates.
   Five weeks ago, that poll found Daley, the Cook County state's
attorney, leading 51 percent to 27 percent.
   A poll conducted for the Chicago Tribune and published in Sunday
editions put Daley's lead over Sawyer at 45 percent to 37 percent
among likely voters in the Feb. 28 Democratic primary. Seventeen
percent said they were undecided.
   The Democratic primary historically determines the victor in the
general election in this overwhelmingly Democratic city.
   ``This campaign is winding down and we're moving up,'' Sawyer
said Saturday at a meeting of Operation PUSH with its founder, Jesse
Jackson. ``It's very encouraging.''
   Daley, son of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley, spent part of
Saturday walking through one of his strongholds on the city's
Southwest Side.
   ``I said this is going to a very close election,'' said Daley.
``These people down here react more to shaking-hand appearances than
to polls.''
   The biggest swing by voters in the recent Sun-Times poll compared
with last month's poll was among blacks. Support for Sawyer, who is
black, jumped from 47 percent in January to 77 percent in the most
recent poll. Daley, who is white, was supported by 11 percent of
black voters polled, down from 19 percent five weeks ago.
   At the same time, however, Daley increased his support among
white voters by 5 percent and Hispanics voters by 3 percent,
according to the Sun-Times poll of 1,001 registered voters
questioned Feb. 10-14. The margin of error was plus or minus 4
percentage points.
   The Sun-Times-WLS-TV poll was completed just before the
withdrawal from the race of Alderman Lawrence Bloom, and before
Bloom's endorsement of Sawyer. The newspaper said preliminary
responses of people asked their second choices for mayor showed
Daley and Sawyer could get almost equal numbers of Bloom supporters.
   The Tribune poll found Bloom's black supporters moving to Sawyer
by a 4-to-1 margin and his white backers splitting between Daley and
Sawyer. The poll of 1,017 registered voters likely to cast ballots
was conducted for the Tribune by Market Shares Corp. of Mount
Prospect, and has a margin of error of 3 percentage points.
   The Democratic and Republican nominees will compete in the April
4 general election with Alderman Timothy Evans, who skipped the
primary and is running as a third-party candidate. The endosed GOP
candidate is Dr. Herbert Sohn, a North Side physician.
   The winner of the April election will complete the last two years
of the late Harold Washington's second term. Washington, Chicago's
first black mayor, died of a heart attack in November 1987.

   President Najib, seeking to tighten his
grip on the government and military, will form and lead a supreme
military council to coordinate the armed forces' fight against
Moslem guerrillas, the foreign minister said Sunday.
   The announcement came a day after Najib declared a nationwide
state of emergency and replaced seven members of his Cabinet who
were not members of his ruling People's Democratic Party of
Afghanistan.
   In Islamabad, Pakistan, guerrillas trying to form their own
interim government failed to agree on a Cabinet list, and several
delegates walked out of a meeting.
   Guerrillas also claimed to have captured a provincial capital in
central Afghanistan, taking government soldiers prisoner and seizing
arms and ammunition.
   Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil said in an interview with British
Broadcasting Corp. radio the military council will coordinate
economic and military activities and will be formed ``in the next
few days.'' He said the new council will not replace the Cabinet.
   Wakil also said the emergency declared Saturday night was a
precautionary measure and a ``sign of strength, not weakness.'' New
security measures will include house searches, he said.
   Foreign ministry officials said seven members of the ruling
party's policy-making Central Committee are replacing the ousted
non-party ministers.
   ``We wanted to give a sign to the counterrevolutionaries and show
them the party is not finished,'' one senior party member said on
condition of anonymity. ``We are stronger than ever.''
   A diplomat who refused to be identified further said the
reshuffle and emergency indicate Najib will be harder to remove from
power.
   ``He has surrounded himself with his people. He's showing that
he's now in charge, he's calling the shots now that the Soviets are
gone,'' said the diplomat.
   The Red Army withdrew the last of its troops from Afghanistan on
Wednesday under terms of a U.N.-mediated accord. They had been in
Afghanistan for nine years backing Najib in his war with Moslem
guerrillas.
   There still are 10 non-party members in the Cabinet, including
Prime Minister Mohammad Hassan Sharq, his deputy and two vice
presidents.
   The Pakistan-based guerrillas, who Saturday nominated leaders of
a government-in-exile in Pakistan, have vowed to bring down Najib
now that the Soviets are gone.
   Moderate guerrilla factions walked out of the guerrilla council
session Sunday that was to approve the nominations. They opposed the
nomination of hardliner Ahmad Shah as prime minister.
   The council, or shura, was scheduled to reconvene Monday in
Islamabad.
   Rebels said Sunday their combined forces captured Tarin Kot,
provincial capital of the remote central province of Uruzgan, along
with ``many'' government troops and a large quantity of arms and
ammunition in a battle Friday.
   There was no independent confirmation of the report, which was
carried by the Afghan News Agency, a rebel medium based in Islamabad.
   Tarin Kot is 60 miles from the nearest key highway and has little
strategic importance. But its capture would bring to six the number
of provincial capitals to fall to the insurgents since Soviet forces
began leaving Afghanistan on May 15.
   The guerrillas are said to control 90 percent of the countryside,
but Najib's troops still hold most urban centers.
   More troops, tanks and armored personnel carriers appeared on
Kabul streets Sunday morning. Few Afghans seemed to notice. Many
soldiers sat smoking cigarettes, reading newspapers or sipping tea
next to their vehicles.
   The state of emergency allows the government to suspend or limit
constitutional rights that protect against confiscation and searches
of property; provide for confidentiality of correspondence and
telephone conversations; allow peaceful assembly and demonstrations;
protect freedom of expression; and provide for freedom from
compulsory labor.
   Ismail Danish, a former ambassador to Libya, replaces Nur Ahmed
Barlets as minister of higher education in Najib's Cabinet.
   Burhan Gasi, who was higher education minister in a former
Cabinet, was chosen to replace Mohammad Khan Jalalar as minister of
commerce.
   Khodaidad Basharmall is the new education minister, ousting Abdul
Rasul, and Abdullah Baharr succeeds Isaq Kawah as minister of light
industries and foodstuffs.
   Shirjan Mazdorarr, who was transport minister, was picked to
replace Pachqul Wafadarr as civil aviation minister.
   A former ambassador to Iraq, Said Amir Yarah, succeeds Abdul
Fatah Najam as public health minister, and Said Ikram Paigair
replaces Abdul Gafar Farhar as repatriation minister.

<HEAD>Paper: Airlines Looked For Radio-Cassette Bomb before Pan Am Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security staff at London's Heathrow Airport began
searching for a bomb hidden in a radio-cassette player on Nov. 22,
one month before such a device destroyed Pan Am Flight 103, The
Sunday Telegraph reported.
   The Transport Department had warned airline security staff to
look for a Japanese-made radio-cassette player containing sheets of
the powerful, Czech-made explosive Semtex, the newspaper said.
   It cited only unidentified sources at Heathrow for its report.
   It said the warning came after police in West Germany raided 16
houses and apartments occupied by suspected radical Palestinians on
Oct. 27 and found an air pressure-activated bomb hidden in a radio.
   Police investigating the Dec. 21 explosion of the Boeing 747 said
last week they believe a radio-cassette player hid explosives that
blew up the plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 people
aboard and 11 on the ground.
   On Friday, the Transport Department publicly advised all airlines
using British airports to examine passengers' radios, computers or
other electronic or electrical equipment for possible bombs.
   A spokesman said the recommendation was aimed mainly at
battery-operated transistor radios, lap-top computers and cassette
recorders in which explosives could be hidden, rather than smaller
electrical items such as hair dryers.
   The Sunday Telegraph said that following the Transport
Department's fall warning, security technicians at Heathrow built a
replica of the suspected device and used it to train staff.
   It quoted unidentified sources at Heathrow as saying the
Transport Department memo warned of a Toshiba ``Beat Bomb'' player
which would have two different types of batteries, but would not
play.
   ``It would have two actuating devices, the first a timer which
would activate the second, a barometric device,'' the newspaper
said. ``This would detonate the explosives once the aircraft reached
a predetermined height.''
   A Transport Department spokesman said Sunday, ``We don't comment
on advice we give to airlines, and all we're saying is, as with all
warnings, the threat was assessed and appropriate advice issued to
the industry.''

   The National Weather Service is facing a
shortage of money and a reorganization that could lead to the
closing of many local weather offices over the next several years.
   The money available for the current fiscal year likely won't
cover costs, and the budget under discussion for next year could be
even worse.
   At the same time, administrators are trying to complete a
long-range reorganization plan aimed at consolidating offices
through the use of new electronic equipment.
   The Weather Service currently has nearly 250 local offices across
the country and administrators hope to keep most of them running for
at least the next few years while automated observation equipment
can be purchased and installed.
   Then, closings could be phased in gradually, perhaps taking as
long as a decade, according to agency officials.
   But the budget crunch is more immediate.
   The current fiscal year is expected to end with the Weather
Service short between $10 million and $28 million. The shortfall has
prompted a hiring freeze and a search for other savings, according
to several National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   NOAA spending proposed by former President Reagan for fiscal
1990, meanwhile, was set at $1.14 billion, down from $1.19 billion
in the current fiscal year.
   While the National Weather Service's portion of the NOAA budget
increases slightly under the budget, that includes money to buy new
radar and observation equipment and a supercomputer.
   According to congressional sources, the Reagan proposal called
for closing as many as 62 local weather offices this year and 77
more next year as part of a consolidation move that would shift many
specialized forecasting tasks to private weather services.
   Congressional sources said the Bush administration may be
reconsidering whether such sharp cuts are needed and that
discussions are underway to keep the local weather offices open, for
the time being anyway.
   Warren Kane of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that
oversees NOAA said that some closings may occur in any case where
stations are located fairly close together.
   Once new automated equipment is in place more extensive office
closings will be easier to defend because weather forecasting would
not be hindered, NOAA officials say. But that would occur over
several years, perhaps as long as a decade.
   The National Weather Service Employees Organization has said that
the long-term closings could affect 100 offices or more. And NOAA
officials privately admit that after the reorganization is complete
they expect to have fewer than 150 local offices, instead of the
nearly 250 today.
   The long-term Weather Service modernization plan was scheduled to
be sent to Congress this week, but has been delayed partly because
of the change in administrations which has caused confusion over who
will be in top policy-making decisions at the Commerce Department.
   Concerned members of the House and Senate, who want some answers
about the direction the weather agency is going, complained that
they don't know who at Commerce to call for hearings.

   A farmer and his 13-year-old son found half
of a landing-gear door lost from a Flying Tigers Boeing 747 in their
wheat field.
   Paul Pence, 46, and his son, Chris, were inspecting the wheat
field for frost damage Saturday when they found the door. The wheat
field is about 5 miles east of the runway at Rickenbacker Air
Industrial Park, where a Flying Tigers Boeing 747 landed last
Thursday without a door.
   Officials at the air freight company based in Columbus said the
other half of the double door, which conceals the landing gear
during flight, is still missing, according to Pence.
   A Flying Tigers supervisor said the loss of the door caused no
problems for the plane.

<HEAD>Nixon Warns Bush to Move Cautiously in U.S.-Soviet Relations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Richard Nixon says that
President Bush has the chance to ``effect a sea-change in the
U.S.-Soviet relationship'' but should beware of moving incautiously
or giving too much away to the Kremlin.
   Nixon, who dealt with then-Soviet leaders Nikita S. Khrushchev
and Leonid I. Brezhnev, has also met with President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, describing him as ``in a class of his own. He is their
match in tenacity and forcefulness, but outstrips them in realism,
quickness and intelligence.''
   ``We must keep in mind that his talent and capabilities can just
as easily make the world a more dangerous place as they can
contribute to greater global security,'' Nixon wrote of Gorbachev in
the current edition of the magazine ``Foreign Affairs.''
   ``While his reforms give reason for a reappraisal of the West's
policy toward the Soviet Union, we must bear in mind that the causes
of the cold war _ Moscow's domination of Eastern Europe and
aggressive foreign policies around the world _ still endure,'' Nixon
wrote.
   ``Those who parrot today a fashionable slogan _ `the cold war is
over' _ trivialize the problems of Western security,`` wrote Nixon,
who was forced to resign as president in August 1974 during the
Watergate scandal.
   ``We must make Gorbachev choose between a less confrontational
relationship with the West and the retention of his imperial control
over Eastern Europe, between a continuing race in arms technology
and arms control agreements that could create a stable strategic and
conventional balance, and between access to Western credits and
continuing Soviet adventures in the Third World,'' Nixon wrote.
   In the 20-page article, Nixon offered a host of suggestions for
Bush.
   Key among them were a proposal to meet early with the heads of
U.S. allies to formulate joint arms and trade policies toward the
Soviet Union before agreeing to a summit with the Kremlin chief.
   ``Gorbachev needs a summit far more than the president,'' said
Nixon.
   ``It is imperative,'' the former president wrote, that Bush and
the other leaders of the industrialized democracies ``issue a joint
statement, in conjunction with (joint) arms control proposals that
educates their publics on the nature and scope of the Soviet
threat.''
   Nixon had some harsh words for former President Reagan because of
proposals that Reagan endorsed at the Iceland summit in 1986 for the
eventual elimination of all nuclear weapons and the Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty now under negotiation.
   The danger in the draft treaty, wrote Nixon, is that it reduces
the number of U.S. targets more drastically and quickly than it cuts
Soviet land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles ``which are
first strike weapons.''
   Bush has suspended those negotiations pending review of all U.S.
strategic policies, and White House national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft, a Nixon aide, has made statements similar to those in the
``Foreign Affairs'' article.
   Nixon wrote that Bush must repeat his formulation that progress
in reducing nuclear arsenals be linked to reducing the sizable
Soviet edge in conventional forces.
   The American president should demand that any treaty require
sharp cuts in heavy Soviet ICBM's and at the same time move ahead
with deployment of a single-warhead U.S. ICBM. Such a step would
reduce the number of Soviet warheads and launchers while increasing
the number of U.S. targets, producing greater stability, Nixon
maintained.
   Nixon also urged the administration to continue the support of
anti-communist guerrillas in Afghanistan, Nicaragua and Angola, and
to press Gorbachev to withdraw Soviet support for pro-Kremlin
regimes in those nations.

<HEAD>Pipeline Leak Sends Poisonous Gas Cloud Over Siberia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pipeline in Siberia leaked a huge mushroom-shaped
cloud of lethal, flammable gas that threatened two villages, but a
helicopter crew exploded the cloud before it injured anyone, Pravda
reported Sunday.
   The Communist Party daily said the ``poisonous and explosive
fog'' was detonated by a rescue crew in an MI8 helicopter who fired
a flare pistol into it. That touched off a thunderous explosion and
a fire that shot more than 300 feet into the air and measured nearly
2,000 feet in diameter, the paper said.
   Prvada said no one happened to be in the vicinity of the fire,
which eventually burned out itself.
   The leak in the pipeline carrying pressurized propane, ethane,
hexane and other light hydrocarbons from Siberia to the Volga region
of central Russia took place Tuesday night, Pravda said.
   When the gas, which was liquified at a pressure of 75 pounds per
square inch, escaped from the pipeline, it turned into a
``mushroom-shaped cloud ready to explode at any second,'' Pravda
said.
   Noticing a sharp drop in pressure, the pipeline crew shut down
all compressor stations on the pipeline within 10 minutes, and the
helicopter set off to look for the poisonous cloud, the paper said.
   Its crew found a white fog suspended in the air 120 miles from
the city of Tobolsk, which is 1,200 miles east of Moscow in western
Siberia.
   The cloud threatened a railway station and two small villages, so
the helicopter crew decided to detonate it, Pravda said. ``For many
kilometers, it became as light as in broad daylight,'' it said.
   Fire engines, bulldozers, excavators, tractors and more than 30
workers set off from the petroleum center of Tyumen, 150 miles
southwest of Tobolsk, for the site of the explosion, according to
Pravda.
   By the time they arrived, the fire had subsided, and it died out
completely a day later, the newspaper said.
   It said the damaged section of the pipeline was replaced.

<HEAD>Self-Described `Monster' On Trial For Attempted Murder Of Prison
Guard</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A self-described ``monster,'' a thrill
killer at 15 whose reputation is that of New York's most dangerous
inmate, is defending himself at his attempted murder trial and
trying to put the system on trial.
   Willie Bosket Jr., charged with stabbing a prison guard, is
shackled hand and foot in court but when he sits down at the defense
table, he flashes a smile at reporters and surveys the scene before
turning his attention to the neatly prepared files on his desk.
   He's not proclaiming innocence _ he admitted in opening arguments
that he stabbed the guard.
   Articulate and intelligent at the trial, Bosket said he hopes his
appearance will focus attention on problems he perceives within the
state's legal system. He says he stabbed the guard to retaliate
against injustices committed against him in prison, but the
prosecutor calls him a master manipulator.
   ``Each and every day I stand in this courtroom, I laugh at this
system because there ain't a damn thing that it can do to me except
to deal with the monster that it has created,'' Bosket said in his
opening statement.
   Courtrooms are nothing new for Bosket, 26, who has been shuffled
in and out of the legal system since he was 9 years old.
   ``I'm a monster that's come back to haunt this system and I will
dog this system until it is in its grave,'' Bosket promised in 1987.
   At the time the guard was stabbed at the Shawangunk Correctional
Facility on April 16, 1988, Bosket was serving 25 years to life for
assault, arson and being a persistent felon. He also had three years
remaining to serve on a previous conviction.
   In 1978, at age 15, Bosket prompted legislators to change the way
the state treats violent juveniles when he murdered two men and
injured another in an eight-day crime spree.
   He told authorities he did it ``for the experience.'' New York
City Mayor Edward Koch called him a ``willful, mad-dog killer.''
   Bosket was tried as a juvenile and sentenced to only five years.
But later that year, bowing to public pressure, then-Gov. Hugh Carey
and the Legislature enacted tougher juvenile laws that allow
teen-agers under 16 to be tried as adults for violent crimes.
   Bosket grew up in Harlem, the product of a broken home. He never
knew his father, Willie Bosket Sr., who graduated Phi Beta Kappa
from the University of Kansas while a federal prison inmate and
eventually died in an escape attempt.
   He once boasted to a detective that he had a record of robbery
arrests that began when he was 9. By age 10, he had been convicted
of attacking a younger child with a knife and sent to a detention
center. At age 12, Bosket was diagnosed by a psychiatrist as an
``emotional zombie.''
   After the guard was stabbed, a special ``box'' cell was built for
Bosket at the Woodbourne Correctional Facility in Sullivan County.
His meals are slipped in through a slot cut into iron bars.
Television cameras monitor his every move, 24 hours a day.
   When Bosket leaves his cell for any reason, he must first stick
his feet through a slot to be manacled and then his hands to be
cuffed. Three guards watch him when he gets his daily hour of
exercise, alone in a small, fenced-in area. The prisoner's hands and
feet remain manacled.
   Ulster County Judge Francis J. Vogt ruled that Bosket also must
remain in shackles during this trial, his hands and legs manacled
and linked to a chain around his waist.
   In spite of those restraints, Bosket has conducted his
cross-examinations with intelligent, articulate questions. Referring
to himself in the third-person, he has strayed from a professional
demeanor only occasionally, smiling or chuckling to himself when
something did not go his way.
   ``He clearly has established intelligence and also knowledge of
the courtroom,'' Chief Assistant District Attorney Donald Williams
said during a break in the trial Thursday.
   ``I'm not surprised. He's one of the most manipulative people
I've ever come across,'' Williams added. ``Appearances can be
deceiving.''
   When it's all over, Bosket knows he will return to his cell,
where even the guards are forbidden to talk to him.
   If convicted, Bosket could be sentenced to another prison term of
up to 25 years to life, which would have to be served consecutively
to his present sentence.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just a 20-minute walk east of the spires of
London's financial district and the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral,
signs of England give way to the sounds and smells of the Asian
subcontinent.
   The mosque's wailing call to prayer drowns out the toll of the
church bell, swishing sari robes replace pin stripes and the smell
of roast lamb and spice fills the air in Brick Lane _ the ``new
world'' for Britain's latest immigrants, people from Bangladesh.
   The first arrivals stepped off boats three decades ago and
settled in the East End neighborhood. Like the Jews once predominant
in Brick Lane, the Bangladeshis have struggled to learn English,
find shelter and work, and preserve their culture.
   A century ago Brick Lane was an area of infamous squalor, where
Jack the Ripper stalked his victims.
   Its Jewish residents began leaving after it was heavily bombed
during World War II. Now, 160,000 Bangladeshis, the single largest
concentration in Britain, inhabit the low-built houses and narrow
streets.
   They have built five mosques in a square-mile area, and opened
leather shops and grocery stores filled with chutneys and mangoes.
   The Bangladeshis also have adopted a higher profile in demanding
their rights as Moslems.
   They want more segregation of boys and girls in public schools
where their children are in the majority and government money for
their private schools.
   Another issue these days is Salman Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic
Verses,'' which many Moslems say slanders Islam.
   Not all support Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's call
to kill Rushdie and his publishers. But they vociferously denounce
the novel as an insult to their faith.
   In many ways the issue is not about Rushdie's book, said Iqbal
Wahhab, editor of the Asian Herald, an English-language weekly.
   ``It was about the reassertion of Moslem values onto British
society which they feel have been ignored,'' he said.
   The Bangladeshis have begun to think of England as home.
   ``Five, 10 years ago, our people sent all money to Bangladesh and
think `I'm just working here,''' said Siraz Miah, a 28-year-old
whose tiny leather factory sits above a narrow staircase strewn with
leather scraps.
   ``Now we think it's our country. Now people have house and
business. Now is better.''
   Amid the acrid smell of chemicals, his 12 workers stitch 300
jackets a week on old sewing machines surrounded by head-high piles
of hide. They are among the fortunate; 27 percent of East End
Bangladeshis are jobless.
   It was factories like Miah's that prompted Prince Charles, during
a 1987 visit, to liken Brick Lane's workplaces to sweatshops.
   Something must be done, said the heir to the British throne, and
London's business community responded with $2.6 million in donations
for projects to create jobs.
   Many of the earliest Bangladeshis to settle in London were ship's
cooks who had few skills and came alone, intending to return home
someday.
   Families followed, sometimes nearly a decade later because of
Britain's tightening immigration laws, and a community grew. Now
their children speak with Cockney accents.
   ``We have heard that Moslem girls choose boyfriends freely and go
to discos. It's worrying us _ what comes next?'' said Daslim-Ali, a
leader of the East London Mosque near Brick Lane.
   Others trust the collective identity forged in Brick Lane to
teach their children.
   ``Nowadays lots of Bangladeshis are here, so our children know
how we behave,'' said Taiyabur Rahman, 55, who came in 1959 to open
the first Bangladeshi travel agency in London. ``As long as our
children are with us, they won't be lost.''
   But while life improves, problems remain.
   Racist violence, a threat wherever Britain's 800,000 Asian
immigrants are clustered, is acute in the Tower Hamlets neighborhood.
   The Tower Hamlets Association for Racial Equality says it
received about 2,500 complaints of racial harassment in 1987, mostly
involving beatings and broken windows. It also said seven Asian
homes were set afire.
   Brick Lane still has a few reminders of its Jewish past,
including an all-night bagel shop and the J. Minsky and Sons textile
store.
   Sidney Minsky, whose father started the business in 1902, eagerly
shows a visitor around Asian stores in old tenements.
   ``The Asians show you how a business can be run,'' he said.

<HEAD>Players Ratify Contract, Ending Longest American Symphony Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra
return to the concert hall this week after ratifying a contract that
assures a minimum $1,040 a week in the 1991-1992 season and closes
the longest strike in American symphony history.
   By the end of the four-year, $4.6 million contract, players will
earn 35 percent more than the $770 weekly minimum they received at
the end of the three-year pact that expired in September. Unlike
many orchestras, the musicians in the Baltimore Symphony are paid
for a 52-week year.
   The contract was approved late Saturday by a vote of 78-7.
   ``We think it's an excellent settlement and it meets the players'
needs for parity with the orchestras of St. Louis and Cincinnati,''
said Charles Underwood, the players' representative in negotiations.
He referred to the musicians' demand that their wages be on a par
with those of orchestras they consider peers.
   The new agreement, reached after a 22-week walkout, was agreed to
after an all-day negotiating session Thursday and approved Friday by
members of the BSO board. After 84 canceled concerts, the orchestra
will return to its home at Meyerhoff Hall for a performance Thursday.
   ``Hopefully, we'll be able to face the future and become a better
and deeper institution,'' said John Gidwitz, the orchestra's
executive director. ``We will work so that this will never happen
again.''
   The $4.6 million cost of the contract is ``in line with the
financial plan of the orchestra'' and will be paid for by ``very
ambitious fund-raising,'' he said.
   ``Ticket prices may go up modestly, but we do not anticipate
dramatic rises,'' he said. ``We want to keep them affordable.''
   Horn player Peter Landgren said he had lost $20,000 during the
strike but said it was worth every penny ``because we have the
satisfaction of knowing that we had to be dealt with and that we
were not manipulated.''
   To help bring an end to the strike, Gov. William Donald Schaefer
pledged $161,000 more state support for fiscal 1990, in addition to
the $486,000 already in the state budget proposed for next year.

<HEAD>China Plans First Permanent Nuclear Waste Dumps</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China is making plans to build its first permanent
nuclear waste dumps in preparation for its first nuclear power
stations, an official report said Sunday.
   The first two dumps likely will be in Zhejiang province on the
east coast, where a 300-megawatt nuclear power plant is to start
operating next year, and in northwest China where nuclear weapons
are tested, China Daily said.
   The newspaper quoted Pan Ziqiang, director of the safety
department of state-run National Nuclear Industry Corp., as saying
that all China's nuclear waste has been put in concrete basement
storage facilities good for only 10 years.
   He said the plan is to move the waste to proposed new facilities
of steel containers buried 15 to 90 feet underground.
   Most of China's nuclear waste has been generated by the military,
but growing amounts are being produced by scientific labs, hospitals
and non-military industries.
   The start-up of the Qinshan nuclear power plant in Zhejiang next
year and of the 1,800-megawatt Daya Bay plant in southeast China's
Guangdong province by 1993 will add substantially to the amount of
waste produced.
   The China Daily did not say how much nuclear waste currently is
in temporary storage, the amount the new power plants will produce,
nor the planned capacity of the proposed new dumps.
   In recent years China has decided to turn to nuclear power to
compensate for dwindling supplies of coal and other fossil fuels,
which hamper economic development.

   Some consumer activists are back to pushing
no-fault auto insurance, but others think a more general overhaul of
insurance regulation is a better way to go.
   No-fault emerged in the 1960s as a counter to rising premiums,
slow resolution of lawsuits and paltry payments.
   Fourteen states adopted no-fault in one form or another, but only
three _ Michigan, New York and Florida _ have the high barriers to
lawsuits that characterize the pure no-fault concept.
   But a 60 percent premium increase in five years has made auto
insurance an issue again. California voters recently voted to
require a 20 percent rollback.
   It is in this climate that no-fault is getting another look.
   The idea behind no-fault is that accidents are inevitable and
that, often as not, who was at fault is difficult or impossible to
determine. Under a no-fault plan, accident victims collect their
medical expenses and wage losses from their own insurance companies
without having to make a claim against the other driver, which means
a lawsuit if the other driver's insurer refuses to pay.
   No-fault does not deal with collision, theft and other coverages.
   Some consumer groups believe an expansion of no-fault coverage,
though beneficial, should await abolition of the insurance
industry's exemptions from antitrust laws, mostly in rate-setting,
and on revision of state laws limiting competition.
   The new no-fault drive comes from a group called ``New Start''
led by Virginia Knauer, consumer adviser to presidents Nixon, Ford
and Reagan. The founders were James Brown, director of the Center
for Consumer Affairs at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee,
and a longtime no-fault activist, the Rev. Robert J. McEwen,
professor of economics at Boston College.

   The Consumer Federation of America, the National Insurance
Consumer Organization and Consumers Union on Sunday released a poll
of 1,008 people in which 72 percent of respondents believed their
premiums were too high and 41 percent believed them ``much too
high.''
   Forty-one percent supported elimination of antitrust exemptions
for insurance companies, with 26 percent opposed. No-fault insurance
was supported 49 percent to 37 percent and government provision of
limited-coverage, low-cost policies was backed 69 percent to 26
percent.
   Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of
America, said, ``Auto insurance reform has become the consumer
movement's top priority.''
   
   End embargoed portion
   
   Organizations close to consumer advocate Ralph Nader, such as
Public Citizen and Congress Watch, are skeptics on no-fault.
   Nader himself distributed a column on auto insurance earlier this
month that never mentioned no-fault, but supported the rest of the
agenda backed by the consumer groups pushing widespread insurance
changes.
   ``The most basic and longer term reform is redirecting this giant
profitable industry toward loss prevention _ the constant advocacy
for safer cars, better bumpers, lower repair costs from superior
engineering, safer highways and drivers,'' Nader wrote.
   Mike Johnson, insurance specialist for Congress Watch, an
organization often associated with Nader, said, ``Litigation ...
really isn't where the major costs are.''
   Thirty-five cents of every premium dollar go to administer the
system, ``and no-fault wouldn't touch that 35 cents,'' he said.
   Roughly half of every insurance premium dollar is returned to
claimants _ not all of whom sue _ and 15 cents goes to their
lawyers, studies show.
   ``If all no-fault means is people are being compensated less
generously, we can save plenty of money by cutting benefits 50
percent,'' said Johnson. ``No fault doesn't address the real reasons
for the inflation in auto insurance costs.''
   Bob Hunter, director of the National Insurance Consumers
Organization, which he described as ``spiritually affiliated'' with
Nader, said, ``What we have now is a deregulated cartel,'' fixing
prices to protect its least efficient members.
   Abolition of the antitrust exemptions would favor the efficient
whose administration costs less than 30 percent of premium income,
he believes.
   ``A truly competent package (of legislation) would save 20 to 25
percent'' of premiums through efficiencies of competition and better
regulation, but no-fault itself would knock only about 5 percent off
premiums, he said.
   ``There are only 60 actuaries in all the state insurance
departments. Aetna has 120,'' said Hunter, an actuary himself
   If forced to choose between no-fault and changing the regulatory
scheme, ``I would take the one that saves the money,'' Hunter said,
and leave no-fault to later.
   The American Insurance Association backs no-fault, as do many
companies. In Michigan, New York and Florida, it has ``reduced
losses and stabilized premiums,'' said spokesman Dave Snyder, who
called New Start ``a welcome addition.''
   ``Every economic study done by a legitimate economist has
concluded that the industry is highly competitive, especially in
auto insurance,'' with hundreds of participants, he said.
   Brown said the differing consumer group strategies are merely
``parallel efforts'' in the same fight.
   ``One of the chief virtues of no-fault is prompt payment. (The
Naderite strategy) does nothing to achieve that,'' Father McEwen
said.
   It also does nothing to discourage frivolous lawsuits, which many
companies settle for $3,000 to $5,000 ``just to get them out of
their hair,'' he said.
   Members of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America are the
lawyers who collect one-third of damage awards they win, and have
managed to keep no-fault at bay in state after state with the
argument that no one should be deprived of the right to sue.
   Under no-fault, said association president Bill Wagner of Tampa,
Fla., accident victims rapidly see ``the economic power of the
insurance companies used to deprive them of all their rights.''
   Wagner believes the companies, far from throwing money at
nuisance lawsuits to make them go away, resist too many claims too
hard.

<HEAD>Law Enforcement Officials To Meet In Quantico To Compare Notes On
Bundy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Law enforcement authorities from around the
country will meet this week in Quantico to compare notes, hoping to
fill in more missing pieces of the puzzle left by serial killer Ted
Bundy before his execution last month.
   The FBI will hold the conference at its National Center for the
Analysis of Violent Crime.
   ``One of the agents was with Bundy prior to his death and will be
sharing that information with law enforcement officials,'' FBI
spokesman Bill Carter said Friday in a telephone interview from his
Washington, D.C., office. ``We have invited police officers from all
over the country.''
   An FBI statement said the conference was being coordinated among
interested law enforcement agencies who had been involved with Bundy
before his execution. Bundy died Jan. 24 in Florida's electric chair
for the 1978 slaying of sixth-grader Kimberly Diane Leach of Lake
City, Fla.
   ``The conference had been planned for quite some time to get a
resolution on some of the cases that might be out there,'' Carter
said.
   The handsome, articulate Bundy, a one-time law student who became
the nation's best-known serial killer, for years had cockily
maintained his innocence in the string of killings for which he was
a suspect.
   But during his final days, Bundy confessed to the slayings of at
least 23 women in four states and gave information that linked him
to other killings. Some investigators have said they believe his
real total is 100 or more.
   In all, Bundy has been suspected at one time or another in
killings in Washington state, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Colorado,
Vermont, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. He was convicted of three
killings in Florida.
   Carter said Special Agent William Hagmaier, who is assigned to
the center, was present at Bundy's request at the interviews.
Hagmaier had interviewed Bundy several times in the past as part of
the center's research into serial violence, Carter said.
   Salt Lake County Sheriff Pete Hayward said Sunday that two
detectives, Dennis Couch and Jerry Thompson, were leaving for
Quantico on Monday and would be there all week.
   Couch interviewed Bundy two days before his execution, and at
that time Bundy ``claimed responsibility'' for eight killings in
Utah during the mid-1970s when he was a law student at the
University of Utah, Hayward said.
   ``We linked Bundy to five of them, but there was some comment
that he was responsible for eight, and we're very much concerned
which ones they are,'' he said.
   Hayward said the detectives would ``mainly try to coordinate all
of the information developed by other investigators to see if
there's anything more that we can put into the cases we have open
here.''
   Carter said he did not know how many law enforcement officials
would be attending the conference. FBI officials in Quantico did not
return telephone calls from The Associated Press on Friday.

   Police investigating the murder
of a young black activist detained four men at Winnie Mandela's home
Sunday and said they found traces of blood during a pre-dawn raid
there.
   Radio reports said the men served as Mrs. Mandela's bodyguards.
   ``This is a thorough search of the premises where the alleged
attacks and assaults took place, according to witnesses,'' said Maj.
Gen. Jaap Joubert, chief of the investigation into the death of
Stompie Seipei, 14. The boy's body, with the throat slit, was found
last month dumped in Soweto, the sprawling black township outside
Johannesburg.
   South African Police released a videotape of their operation,
showing officers, without gloves, searching trunks of clothing,
leafing through photograph albums and collections of African
National Congress literature, and lifting up what appeared to be
blood-soaked sneakers, a knife and a pair of gardening shears.
   The camera focused on spots on the walls of some back rooms where
the detained men lived. State-run Radio South Africa said the spots
were spatters of blood.
   Three Soweto men have said Mrs. Mandela's bodyguards abducted
them and the boy and beat them at the Mandela house. They say Mrs.
Mandela, wife of imprisoned ANC leader Nelson Mandela, was involved.
   Mrs. Mandela, 54, has denied being at home when the four were
brought there. But she has defended their abduction and said they
probably were ``slapped'' to get them to talk about alleged
homosexual activities at the Methodist Church residence where they
lived. The church denies her allegations.
   ``We have found fingerprints and blood samples which will be
sorted out in the laboratory,'' said Joubert. He said police will
try to prove in court that members of the so-called Mandela United
soccer team, who live at Mrs. Mandela's home and act as her
bodyguards, assaulted the boy who died.
   The Rev. Frank Chikane, general secretary of the South African
Council of Churches, told a news conference Saturday that Mrs.
Mandela had decided to remove the young men from her home at her
husband's instruction.
   Major anti-apartheid leaders inside South Africa and the exiled
African National Congress president have publicly criticized Mrs.
Mandela's association with the soccer team.
   Joubert said one of those detained during the 4 a.m. raid was
Jerry Richardson, identified as team coach. Others arrested at the
house were not named, but Radio South Africa said they were Mrs.
Mandela's bodyguards.
   Joubert said police also arrested two other men elsewhere in
Soweto, who will be charged with murdering Soweto's Dr. Abu Baker
Asvat. Community leaders have told newspapers that Asvat examined
Seipei after he was beaten. Mrs. Mandela said Asvat was a witness to
her charges of sexual abuse.
   Police also raided five other ``premises'' connected with Mrs.
Mandela, including the home of a free-lance journalist, Joubert
said. He did not identify the others.
   The alarm went off and dogs barked as policemen entered the back
houses at Mrs. Mandela's home, according to the film. It shows Mrs.
Mandela, her daughter, Zindzi, and grandchildren in their bathrobes.
Richardson was filmed in his underwear, putting on his pants and
shirt while a policeman asked him to identify men who ran away when
the raid started.
   State television broadcast those scenes from the film, which
police made available to foreign reporters the same day. They do not
usually release material so quickly.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok has promised foreign
journalists he will release any information on the case as quickly
as possible, which also is unusual.
   The film showed Joubert directing the search while Mrs. Mandela
went about her daily chores, provided refreshments to journalists
waiting on the front lawn. She was heard chatting, laughing and
listening to Nat King Cole music.
   Police searched through Mrs. Mandela's belongings but did not
take any of them, said a journalist at the scene.

<TEXT>
   SEATTLE _ A Boeing subsidiary may have curtailed testing of
high-tech nuts and bolts destined for use in the new Air Force B-2
stealth bomber in order to save money, according to a published
report Sunday.
   The supplier of those nuts and bolts is now under investigation,
suspected of supplying substandard parts stamped as approved by a
fictitious ``Inspector 11.''
   The Seattle Times reported that an internal memo declared that
Boeing Advanced Systems had the testing of incoming fasteners
curtailed just as a federal task force began the investigation into
fraud in the aerospace fastener industry. Only ``suspect'' parts
would be tested, the memo stated.
   Among the parts that may have escaped routine testing by Boeing
were high-tech titanium nuts and bolts manufactured by a Chatsworth,
Calif., company called Voi-Shan, a division of Fairchild Industries,
the newspaper said.
   Boeing Advanced Systems in Seattle uses Voi-Shan nuts and bolts.
Boeing is manufacturing classified parts for the Stealth bomber,
made by the Northrop Corp.
   Two weeks ago, 20 federal agents armed with search warrants
seized 52 crates of documents, test equipment and fasteners in a
raid on Voi-Shan, the newspaper said.
   The agents were searching for evidence to support allegations
made by three past and present Voi-Shan workers that no testing was
done on the fasteners, but the fasteners were given a stamp of
approval by a fictitious ``Inspector 11.''
   The Times said tests done on high-performance titanium fasteners,
used to hold together everything from engines to airframes, were of
particular concern.
   The newspaper also obtained Boeing and Voi-Shan shipping
documents that stated in the week before the raid, Boeing Advanced
Systems received two shipments of more than 200 Voi-Shan titanium
fasteners, with test reports certified by ``Inspector 11.''
   The Times, quoting an unidentified source, said those parts were
only two of many similar shipments designated for the B-2 project
last year.
   According to a memo obtained by the newspaper, a quality-control
manager at Boeing Advanced Systems ordered the routine testing of
incoming shipments of some fasteners stopped, apparently to save
money.
   The Feb. 18, 1988, memo directed at top managers of the Boeing
B-2 program stated: ``Effective immediately, routine receiving
inspection testing of fasteners is to be stopped. Only those
fasteners identified as suspect will be suspect to test.'' The memo
said the company expected to save $53,000 by reducing testing from
March to October last year.
   Boeing spokesman Paul Binder confirmed that the memo was
legitimate, but declined further comment on it or any aspect of the
B-2 program.
   The company said its own investigation into the safety of the
Voi-Shan fasteners had turned up no problems, the Times said.
   Fairchild Industries, Voi-Shan's parent company, said last
Tuesday in a statement that it is investigating the charges against
Voi-Shan.
   Fairchild said there has been no claim from customers that it
shipped any unsafe fasteners and said Boeing resumed full-scale
testing of Voi-Shan parts two weeks ago, after the Voi-Shan raid.
   The task force, made up of agents of the FBI, the Internal
Revenue Service, the Navy, Air Force and U.S. attorney's office, and
a grand jury in Seattle are looking into charges of fraudulent
testing and falsified documentation of aerospace fasteners.
   Boeing stated that it is not a target of the investigation and is
cooperating with the task force. It also said it has its own
screening processes to test incoming parts.

   Man, it's cold in North Dakota. So cold,
says Byron Chamberlain, that the state should rename itself _ to
Manitscolda.
   Chamberlain, a high school assistant football coach from
Sheridan, Wyo., was declared the winner Sunday in the Billings
(Mont.) Gazette's tongue-in-cheek contest to rename North Dakota.
   The Gazette's contest was in response to a campaign by North
Dakota state Sen. Tim Mathern to rename the state ``Dakota.''
Mathern said he wanted to dispel the notion that his state is some
sort of arctic wasteland, and blamed the ``north'' in North Dakota
for the misconception.
   But Gazette readers didn't buy that line, as most of the 159
entries in the Gazette's contest zeroed in on the state's propensity
for cold winters.
   There was ``Darn Dacolda,'' ``Zipdacoatup,'' ``Weardakotanhat,''
``Saskatchacolda,'' ``Subtopia'' and, for those who put things
bluntly, ``Land of the Frozen Dead.''
   Chamberlain's first-place prize was a one-way bus ticket from
Billings to Bismarck, N.D., or the cash equivalent of $45. He said
he'd take the money.
   By the way, the warmest it got Saturday in Bismarck was 5 degrees.

   While other English researchers pore over the
works of Shakespeare, Faulkner and Hemingway, Ruth K. MacDonald
prefers to analyze ``The Cat in the Hat,'' ``Green Eggs and Ham,''
and ``Horton Hears a Who!''
   MacDonald, head of the English and philosophy department at
Purdue University-Calumet, may be the country's top expert on
Theodor Seuss Geisel _ known to children around the world as Dr.
Seuss.
   ``We know as much as we can know about Shakespeare, but we don't
know much about Seuss. What we do know is scanty,'' says MacDonald,
the author of ``Dr. Seuss,'' a critical analysis of the acclaimed
children's author.
   MacDonald credits the playfulness of Geisel's language for his
enduring popularity, and notes that his books' themes let children
be children.
   ``He has loud and rowdy stories. You don't get rewarded for being
good but for being outrageous,'' she says. ``There is a sense he
appealed to the baby boomers becasue he played with language, pushed
to the edge and encouraged free thinking and experimentation.''

   Sculpting figures from balloons, clown
props and clowning philosophies became serious business for about
250 students at the 1989 Clown School.
   Students and instructors spent part of Saturday visiting three
hospital and five nursing homes in Jefferson City to put their
knowledge to use. As Christian clowns, the students try to spread
cheer to sick adults and children in hospitals, nursing home
residents, churchgoers and others.
   ``It helps the new clowns learn how people are going to respond
to them in clown makeup,'' said Kay Hardage, coordinator of the
school sponsored by the Missouri Baptist Convention. ``But it also
gives us a chance to touch the people in nursing homes and
hospitals.''
   John and Susan Burns of Auxvasse were attending their fourth
Clown School.
   ``You lose your inhibitions when you put a face on and a funny
suit,'' Burns said. ``You figure, `Well, you look strange and funny
anyway, you may as well act that way.' It's a lot easier to approach
people, and people will approach you.''

<TEXT>
   A dance troupe from the Soviet Union is back on
tour again with a new schedule of appearances after being stranded
for two weeks when their financial backing fell apart.
   The 59 members of the Donetsk State Opera and Ballet Theatre set
out by bus Saturday for a Sunday night performance in North Branch,
N.J., ending an unexpected two-week stay at the Belvedere Hotel.
   Hotel front desk manager Donald Steurnagle, 31, had tears in his
eyes when he embraced each of the departing Ukrainian performers.
   ``I've been in the hotel business 10 years, and I've never been
involved personally with guests before,'' Steurnagle said after they
left. ``They were such good people. They brought me gifts all the
time. I will miss them.''
   The ballet troupe had planned a 15-city U.S. tour.
   But when the Soviets refused to allow three well-known dancers to
join the company for its American debut performances, U.S. and
Mexican investors withheld $200,000 in financial support, saying the
three stars had been promised.
   That left the troupe of young, relatively unknown dancers in the
lurch and cast into doubt the future of their performances in such
cities as Columbus, Ohio, and Chicago.
   While U.S. benefactors scrambled to find backing for a new tour,
contributors donated food, liquor and money. The Belvedere and the
Lyric Opera contributed meals. The Lyric held a benefit performance.
Trips were arranged to the National Aquarium and the U.S. Figure
Skating Championships in Baltimore. The United States Information
Agency helped arrange a White House trip.
   Finally, last weekend, a New York concert management firm, ICM
Artists, and the Howard Gilman Foundation in New York announced the
booking at North Branch, plus seven performances at New York's City
Center, to be followed by seven more performances in Washington.
Other cities have been added as well.
   Mikhail Baryshnikov, artistic director of the American Ballet
Theater and a director of the Gilman foundation, and who lived in
Gilman's home after defecting from the Soviet Union in the 1970s,
offered scenery, costumes and rehearsal space.
   Vladimir Shukmeikim, the troupe's artistic director, said
Saturday the dancers had dreaded returning to the Soviet Union under
a cloud of apparent artistic failure.
   ``I think this situation was so unusual, and it would have been
difficult to explain that it was not our fault but the impresarios
who signed the contract,'' he said.
   At Saturday's departure, Lyric president Robert Pomory shared
embraces and kisses with the dancers and several of them threw him
into the air in celebration of his support.
   ``I'm their brother and Mr. Pomory is their father,'' Steurnagle
said.
   ``It's like I developed a whole new entire family,'' Pomory added.

   Moderate Afghan guerrillas unhappy
with nominees for an interim government for their nation on Sunday
walked out of a meeting called to elect a president and prime
minister.
   Qaribur Rehman Saeed, a spokesman for a guerrilla-operated news
agency, said the special Consultative Council of about 400 delegates
will meet again Monday despite the standoff involving the seven
Afghan guerrilla groups based in Pakistan.
   Four of the seven guerrilla parties are made up of hard-line
Islamic fundamentalists who want to establish a strict
fundamentalist state in Afghanistan. The three moderate groups want
a more liberal state similar to the governments prior to the
communist coup in 1978.
   Moderate factions walked out Sunday, and sources said even
representatives of hard-line guerrilla groups argued against a
proposed government headed by Ahmad Shah as prime minister.
   ``Ahmad Shah is a product of disunity, not unity,'' a guerrilla
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Shah is a senior political official of the hard-line
Ittehad-e-Islami guerrilla group.
   ``We won't be part of this shameful government,'' said a
spokesman for the moderate National Islamic Front of Afghanistan. He
also spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Sources who attended the council session said members of that
group were among the guerrillas who walked out.
   The nominee for acting president of the interim government is
Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi, head of the moderate
Harakat-i-Inquilab-i-Islami guerrilla group.
   The guerrilla groups are deeply divided over sharing power, and
the nominations of Mohammadi and Shah were seen as a compromise on
who would lead Afghanistan if its Soviet-back government collapses.
   The Soviets withdrew their last troops from Afghanistan on
Wednesday and the guerrillas have vowed to overthrow the communist
government of President Najib.
   On Saturday, Saeed said a vote scheduled for Sunday on the
nominations was expected to be a formality because the council
delegates were in agreement.
   After Sunday's session, however, he said it was not clear when
the vote would be held. The council also is to appoint a Cabinet.
   The council, which convened Feb. 10, was expected to conclude
after the vote.
   If the guerrillas seize power, they would hold elections within
six months to form an elected council, or shura, that would appoint
a permanent head of state and ratify a government, officials say.
   Outside the meeting site, a Pakistani police officer shot to
death a fellow officer. Police officials said the shooting was
unrelated to the Afghan council session. Some witnesses said it was
a vengeance killing.
   As the guerrilla leaders began leaving the compound where the
council meeting was held, some stopped momentarily to watch as an
ambulance removed the body of the slain police officer.
   Afghans and journalists milling outside the meeting fled for
cover when the other officer opened fire.
   He paced nervously in front of the body for more than 30 minutes
and kept plainclothes officers at bay.
   A superior then arrived and talked him into surrendering. He was
disarmed and fell to his knees and wept.

<HEAD>Canadian Woman Gives Birth in Airliner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British Airways jumbo jet set out Sunday from New
Delhi with 367 passengers and arrived at Heathrow Airport with one
more _ a six pound baby girl who entered the world at 30,000 feet.
   Rajapir Randhawa, en route to Canada to join her husband, gave
birth aboard Flight 142 with the help of three doctors and the moral
support of the crew and 366 other passengers.
   Mrs. Randhawa, seven-months' pregnant, started to go into labor
two hours out of New Delhi, and seats in the economy section were
quickly curtained off to form an emergency maternity area, an
airline spokesman said.
   London doctor S.P. Sriviatava delivered the baby while the
airliner flew though Soviet airspace. Passengers cheered and clapped
when they heard her first cries. The crew called her Beauty because
``she is so beautiful,'' said flight attendant Pat Griffin.
   When the 10-hour flight arrived at Heathrow at 2:05 p.m., Capt.
Roger Nichols said, ``At one stage, I thought of putting the
aircraft down in Moscow, but the birth went so well that I decided
to carry on to London. We were lucky to have so many medical experts
on board.''
   Another flight attendant, Sabina Sudan, from New Delhi, who
helped at the birth, said: ``It was very emotional. I had tears
running down my face.''
   Mrs. Randhawa, a Canadian citizen who was traveling with her
18-month-old son, was admitted to a hospital in Ashford, near the
airport. After several days, she will join her husband in Brampton,
Ontario, near Toronto.
   Before being admitted to the hospital she said: ``All the staff
are marvelous. I am very lucky and my new daughter is just so
beautiful.''

<TEXT>NICOSIA, Cyprus: insults Islam:    Rushdie has not been seen in
public since Tuesday, when Khomeini ordered zealous Moslems to kill him.
A bounty of $5.2 million has been put on Rushdie's head by Iranian leaders.
   The author on Saturday apologized from hiding, saying he was sorry
for distress the book had caused.    Britain's senior diplomat in Tehran,
charge d'affaires Nicholas Browne, met Sunday with Iran's deputy foreign
minister for European and U.S. affairs ``to get a feel of current Iranian
thinking,'' the Foreign Office said.    During the meeting the Iranian
minister, Mohammed Larijani, ``described Mr. Rushdie's statement as positive,''
said a Foreign Office spokesman in London.    However, Iran's only diplomat
in London, charge d'affaires Mohammed Basti, said he thought Rushdie's
apology ``has some shortcoming.''    ``He speaks of the publication, not
the book,'' Basti told BBC radio.

   The 1990s will be the ``she'' generation,
where women can write the scripts in their relationships with men,
according to Dr. Joyce Brothers.
   ``We've been through the `me' generation. We've been through the
`we' generation,'' Brothers said during a news conference Friday at
the University of Missouri-Columbia Hospital. ``The 1980s are the
`he' generation because there are 7.3 million more marriageable
women than marriageable men today, enough to populate an entire
country, Australia.''
   But she said in the 1990s, things will change because of shifting
population patterns, and there will be about 105 eligible men for
every 100 eligible women.
   ``Women will be writing the script,'' she said. ``They will
demand courting. They will demand romance. They will demand babies
within marriage. They will demand marriage.''
   The noted psychologist also predicted a drop in the divorce rate
during the 1990s.

   Nature was too much for Fumio Niwa, whose attempt to
become the first man to cross the Pacific Ocean alone in a balloon
ended in failure, his wife said Sunday.
   Noriko Niwa, 37, said in a telephone interview that ``he just
wasn't able to beat nature.''
   She said that her three children were very disappointed by their
38-year-old father's failure, but added she would have no objections
to him giving it another try.
   Niwa set out from his hometown of Yokohama near Tokyo early
Wednesday in an attempt to fly to San Diego, Calif., but failed to
catch a jet stream which would have carried him to the destination.
   ``I worry only about the weather, but I will tide over any
difficulties and will never give up my attempt,'' Noriko quoted Niwa
as telling her before he decided to abort the flight.
   After 11 hours of drifting in a tiny globe-shaped gondola in
rough seas, he was rescued by a Japanese fishing boat Saturday. Niwa
managed to cover only a third of the distance he would have needed
to reach America.

Roscoe Jones now lives in a nursing home.

   The number of police has not kept pace with the
crime rate in the District of Columbia, the murder capital of the
United States, and union officials are urging the mayor to hire more
officers.
   ``The homicide rate so far this year is terrible proof that we
cannot wait,'' Gary Hankins, chairman of the Fraternal Order of
Police labor committee, recently told Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr.
   The number of crimes reported in the city grew from 52,431 in
1986 to 61,884 last year, but the number of police remained the
same, 3,958 officers.
   The crime rate is growing even faster this year, with 75 people
murdered by last week, putting the city on a course for 600 murders,
shattering the record 372 set last year.
   The crisis prompted Police Chief Maurice T. Turner Jr. to declare
a crime emergency starting Tuesday. The chief city attorney,
Frederick D. Cooke Jr., said the step would allow police to reassign
officers without giving the 28 days notice required in an agreement
with the Fraternal Order of Police.
   Police blame ``crack'' cocaine for the upsurge in crime, and say
drugs are responsible for 60 percent of the murders this year and
last.
   Morale on the force is at an all-time low because so many young
people are being drawn into the lucrative drug trade, say union
officials.
   ``This can't go on forever,'' Hankins warned. ``There's no
slowdown in the drug trade, and burnout is getting to be a real
problem.''
   The number of police officers has dipped since the early 1970's,
when there were 5,000. The number was 3,958 from 1984 through last
year, rose to 4,130, this year, and was slated to increase by 200 by
1990.
   Police chief Turner says that the key is not adding police but
intercepting drugs before they hit the street.
   ``You can always use more officers, but I think more officers
will end up in more drug arrests,'' Turner said. ``We have to attack
the supply side because if we don't do that, we'll get to the point
where 20,000 officers won't be enough.''
   City jails and courts are already clogged by drug arrests.
   Since the start of Operation Clean Sweep against drugs in August
1986, more than 45,000 people have been arrested for drug-related
offenses. City prisons are so overcrowded that inmates are being
sent to facilities as distant as Walla Walla, Wash.
   The city may have neither the money nor the means to increase the
force rapidly. The 1988 budget was $34 million in deficit. And the
number of officers eligible to retire is high, 250 annually over the
next three years.
   ``It will take years to actually bring these (recruits) on board
and for them to mature to a high level of effectiveness,'' Hankins
said. ``In the meantime, we'll be losing officers.''

<HEAD>Republicans Seek To Censure David Duke</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The election of former Ku Klux Klan leader
David Duke as a Republican to the Louisiana Legislature drew quick
cries of dismay from civil rights organizations and a call for his
repudiation by the Republican Party.
   ``David Duke is not a Republican,'' said Lee Atwater, chairman of
the Republican National Committee. ``He's a pretender, a charlatan
and a political opportunist who is looking for any organization he
can find to try to legitimize his views of racial and religious
bigotry and intolerance.''
   Unofficial totals showed Duke narrowly defeated homebuilder John
Treen in Saturday's special election for a seat in the Louisiana
House. Duke registered with the GOP two days before qualifying to
run in the race. Treen is a long-time GOP party official.
   RNC spokeswoman Leslie Goodman said in Washington that if Duke is
officially certified the winner, Atwater will call a meeting of the
party's executive committee to consider an unprecedented motion of
censure against Duke. If passed, it would preclude Duke from
receiving any type of aid from the party.
   ``We repudiate him in his views and we will take steps to see
that he is disenfranchised from our party if he is declared the
official winner in Saturday's election,'' Atwater said in a
statement issued late Saturday.
   Civil rights groups reacted with similar rejection of the
policies espoused by the former grand wizard of the Knights of the
Ku Klux Klan.
   ``Duke's election, if verified, is a gain for the forces of
racism and bigotry,'' said A.I Botnick, regional director of the
Anti-Defamation League in New Orleans. ``Anyone who believes he has
changed also believes in the tooth fairy.''
   American Jewish Committee president Theodore Ellenoff issued a
statement in New York saying: ``While there has been significant
progress in recent years in containing bigotry in America, this
development reminds us that there is much more work to be done.''
   Arthur J. Kropp, president of People for the American Way, a
nonpartisan constitutional liberties organization, called Duke's
election ``a victory for the dark side of American politics _ the
politics of race .... His victory is a defeat for all who want to
replace the ugliness of racism with a society that respects the
rights of all.''

   Snow fell across sections of the Northwest on Sunday, and light
snow, rain and drizzle were scattered over parts of the Plains.
   Moisture streaming northward from the Gulf of Mexico spread light
snow and freezing drizzle in parts of Kansas and Nebraska during the
afternoon. Light rain and drizzle spread over parts of Oklahoma and
eastern Texas.
   Snow continued to fall across parts of the Northwest. Up to 5
inches of snow fell across Yellowstone National Park during the
night and light snow extended from the central Rockies westward over
the Plateau region.
   In North Carolina, where up to 14 inches of snow and ice fell
Friday and Saturday, as many as 30,000 people were without
electricity Sunday for a second day.
   ``It's kind of like doing the two-step,'' said Police Chief J.R.
Peterson of Smithfield, N.C., where a fire at the town's electrical
substation left 9,000 residents without power. ``You do two steps
forward and take one step back. When you get power restored to one
place, it goes out somewhere else.''
   Duke Power Co. sent 600 additional workers to western North
Carolina on Sunday to help local repair crews fix lines, said
spokeswoman Anne Sheffield.
   At least five deaths were blamed on icy roads in North Carolina.
   Strong, gusty wind blew over southern California and a wind
advisory was in effect into the night for the mountains and deserts
there.
   Temperatures were generally below freezing during the afternoon
from the northern half of the Plains to New England, with readings
only in the teens and single digits from Montana through the Dakotas
to Upper Michigan.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 5
degrees below zero at Glasgow, Mont., to 84 at Naples, Fla. Sunday's
early-morning low for the Lower 48 states was 30 degrees below zero
at Wolf Point, Mont.
   For Monday, rain was forecast from the southern and central
Appalachians across much of the southern and central Plains, with
thunderstorms in Texas and the lower Mississippi Valley. Snow was
forecast from the central high Plains through Iowa and southern
Minnesota to the lower Great Lakes. Snow showers were forecast in
the northern and central Rockies. Scattered showers were forecast
across the Pacific Northwest.
   Highs below freezing were predicted from the northern Rockies
through Nebraska and the Dakotas to Upper Michigan, and across
northern Maine, with highs only in the teens in north-central and
northeastern Montana; above 50 along the Pacific Coast, and from
California through southern Arizona and much of the southern Plains
to the southern Atlantic Coast, including highs in the 70s in the
desert Southwest and the Gulf Coast and in the lower 80s across the
Florida Peninsula; and in the 30s and 40s elsewhere.

   A U.S. soldier wounded when a bomb
was thrown at a bus carrying American servicemen will be moved to a
military hospital in Panama and then sent home, officials said
Sunday.
   U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Anne M. Sigmund told The Associated
Press by telephone that 22-year-old Russell E. Miller of Hackett,
Ark., will be taken Monday to Gorgas Military Hospital in Panama.
   Sigmund said, ``His injuries are not serious and he is out of
danger. In Panama will be hospitalized for a few days and return to
the United States.''
   She did not describe Miller's injuries. He was being treated
Sunday in a hospital at Enrique Soto Cano Air Base outside
Comayagua, 60 miles northwest of the capital.
   Miller was among three soldiers injured when a bus carrying 28
U.S. servicemen was bombed in Comayagua.
   The embassy spokeswoman said Miller and the two other servicemen
injured in Saturday's explosion belong to the 183rd engineer's
National Guard batallion from Fort Smith, Ark. She said the other
soldiers, who arrived Feb. 4 for a two-week training mission, are
returning to the United States.
   The other two soldiers were treated and released with minor
injuries, officials said Saturday. The spokeswoman would not
identify them.
   Two Hondurans walking nearby were slightly injured by the blast
in Comayagua.
   Officials said no one has claimed responsibility for the attack.
   The explosive was a crude device rigged with dynamite, said Maj.
Juan Blas Salazar, regional police chief.
   ``We want to find those reponsible for this attack. For this we
can count on the help of the U.S. military,'' he added.
   Police said the bus was attacked at 12:10 p.m. Saturday as the
soldiers were en route to the Enrique Soto Cano Air Base, the
principal center of operations for U.S. manuevers in Honduras.
   More than 1,800 U.S. soldiers arrived in Honduras last month for
joint maneuvers with the Honduran military. Most of the soldiers
come in groups of 400-500 and stay for two weeks.
   Police said the blast damaged the bus, a parked car, a school and
a hotel.
   This was the third terrorist attack against U.S. soldiers, who
have been conducting maneuvers in Honduras since 1982.
   On Aug. 7, 1987, a bomb injured six American soldiers and six
Honduran civilians in a Comayagua restaurant.
   On Feb. 1, seven vehicles carrying more than 30 American soldiers
were attacked by unidentified gunmen in northern Yoro province. No
one was injured.
   Violence has increased lately in Honduras. Manuel Rugama, a
leader of the Nicaraguan rebels, was killed Jan. 7.
   On Jan. 23, Carlos Dias, the attorney for suspected Honduran drug
trafficker Juan Ramon Matta, was fatally shot.
   On Jan. 25, Gen. Gustavo Alvarez Martinez, former head of the
Honduran armed forces, was slain by gunmen.
   Leftist groups have protested the U.S. maneuvers in Honduras and
the presence of 11,000 Contras along the Nicaraguan border. Leftists
are suspected in the Rugama and Alvarez Martinez killings.

   More than 10,000 people at a Sunday Mass
in southeast Poland recalled the birth eight years ago of the banned
independent farmers' union and expressed optimism it soon will
operate freely again.
   Government and opposition negotiators agreed in principle last
week to legalize Rural Solidarity. The union representing the Polish
countryside was banned along with workers' Solidarity in the
December 1981 martial law crackdown.
   Solidarity and Rural Solidarity are separate but mutually
supporting organizations.
   ``Today we are witnessing the beginning of a process in which the
truth is becoming visible again,'' Bishop Ignacy Tokarczuk said in a
sermon at the service marking the anniversary of the Feb. 18, 1981
agreement that legalized Rural Solidarity.
   ``We welcome with cautious hope the understanding that it is
better to talk than to fight,'' he said.
   The bishop said they were witnessing the ``bankruptcy'' of a
political system without God.
   He warned against being too trusting of authorities' promises.
   ``We have to talk but do not allow cheating,'' he said. ``We have
the support of a united society which is pressing and demanding its
rights.''
   At the end of the Mass, messages of support from workers around
the country were read.
   The huge modern church on the outskirts of Rzeszow, 190 miles
southeast of Warsaw, was filled literally to the rafters, with
worshipers crammed into the staircase leading to its roof.
   ``The moods are so radical that people demand that we prepare
some kind of protest for them,'' said Artur Balazs, a member of
Rural Solidarity's national council and one of the negotiators at
the current talks with the government on Poland's future.
   Balazs and union chairman Jozef Slisz said they were preparing a
draft of a new law about legalizing Rural Solidarity.
   ``We have been talking to farmers for two days here and now we
are drawing our conclusions,'' said Slisz. ``It has been a good
lesson for us. We will go to Warsaw and see what the effects are.''
   The farmers' movement continued to function despite the ban and
leaders said there has been a surge of interest in recent weeks.
``More and more farmers are joining the union and there is a great
revival of the movement in the countryside,'' said Slisz.
   He said farmers' councils already are functioning openly in 36 of
Poland's 49 provinces and he expects the number to grow.
   Slisz said farmers worried most about the low prices they receive
for their produce, which he said has not kept pace with increases in
the cost of seed, fertilizer, fodder and machinery.

   Hundreds of sympathetic cards and letters
are helping Louise and John Bundy emerge from the dark shadow of
their serial-killer son, but they remain upset over the celebration
accompanying his execution.
   ``I can go along with people believing in the death penalty, but
you can't be happy about it. It isn't to be a joyous celebration,''
Mrs. Bundy said in the couple's first interview since Ted Bundy's
execution Jan. 24.
   In a story on the interview Sunday, The Morning News Tribune of
Tacoma reported the couple also has received some 400 cards from
people who were moved by the suffering of the killer's mother and
stepfather.
   ``This is just to let you know, all people are not cruel and
sadistic people. My thoughts and prayers are with you all,'' one
woman wrote.
   Ted Bundy died in Florida's electric chair for the 1978 murder of
12-year-old Kimberly Diane Leach of Lake City, Fla. Some
investigators believe he may have killed up to 100 people.
   Until her son started confessing to at least 23 murders in the
days before his execution, Mrs. Bundy said she believed he was
innocent.
   ``When his confessions came out, it was all like a blow right
between the eyes,'' she said. ``This was not the Ted we had raised _
we never saw anything to indicate it.''
   Bundy was born in 1946, at a home for unwed mothers, and the boy
was raised partly by his grandparents _ Mrs. Bundy's parents _
during his first few years. Mrs. Bundy married John Bundy in 1951,
and he then adopted young Ted.
   But Mrs. Bundy said her son had a normal childhood, and
discounted her son's contention during his final days that exposure
to pornography kept by his grandfather had affected him.
   ``We did everything parents of the '50s and '60s did,'' she said,
even down to reading Dr. Spock.
   Bundy wrote his parents a final letter on the eve of his death,
saying, in part, ``Nothing I can say can ease your pain. It is a
terrible thing, I know, but I have to try to make it right _ to tell
the truth.''
   ``I do love you. You were wonderful parents.''
   The night before the execution, the Bundys remained at home until
midnight, talking with Ted on the telephone and with visitors. The
family went to a friend's house at midnight, and waited out the
morning with about 30 friends and church members.
   ``Nobody had to call and tell us it was over. We knew it,'' she
said. ``Along about 7:15 or so _ I guess it was 4:15 here _ I just
knew that Ted was all right. I knew it was over. I felt more at
peace at that moment than I had for 13 years.''
   On the day he was executed, crowds of people gathered outside the
Florida penitentiary where they waved frying pans and shouted
``Burn, Bundy, Burn!''
   Mrs. Bundy said she was angered by the comments of an
investigator that her son was born to kill.
   ``No beautiful child is born to kill. He was not born to do
that,'' she said.
   Her husband, John, said he and his wife have been unable to
determine why Ted became a killer.
   ``We talk about it and try to figure out down the line what it
was. Like I say, it was something he more or less kept under
cover,'' he said.
   ``So far as figuring out why _ it's not going to be figured
out,'' said Bundy.

ministry lost $1.5 million in January and still needs an influx of
donations to stay on the air.
   Swaggart, who declared war on ``pornographers'' he said are
trying to destroy his ministry, said last week that he would be off
the air after Feb. 26 unless supporters provided enough money.
   During his weekly TV program shown Sunday, Swaggart said
followers had responded to the plea but that more donations were
needed to continue the broadcast to all areas.
   ``On Feb. 26, if we do not continue to receive support, we will
lose some stations,'' he said.
   Although Swaggart did not reveal how much money had been
received, he said the ministry posted a $1.5 million loss in
January, a month he said is traditionally the worst month for
television evangelists.
   Last month, Penthouse magazine quoted a New Orleans
``strip-o-gram'' dancer as saying she posed nude for Swaggart, a
charge that he labeled Sunday as ``a scam, a lie from A to Z.''
   Catherine Mary Kampen's story is similar to that of a New Orleans
prostitute who said Swaggart paid her to pose nude for him, an
allegation that led to Swaggart's ouster from the Assemblies of God
and a sharp downturn in the fortunes of his ministry.
   On Feb. 21, 1988, Swaggart made a tearful confession to an
unspecified sin from the pulpit of his Baton Rouge church.
   ``I am not discounting any sin or mistake that Jimmy Swaggart has
committed or made,'' he said during Sunday's program. ``So, please
understand that. I have stood up as possibly no man in history has
ever stood up and blamed no one but myself before the whole wide
world.''
   ``But if Satan succeeds in getting you to zero in on that, and
that's all you see, then he will succeed,'' Swaggart said.
   Swaggart repeated his charge that Penthouse published the story
even though it had been given evidence that Kampen's story was
false. Penthouse has said it stands by the story. Swaggart's
attorneys have said a libel suit is being prepared.

   About 100 people gathered outside St.
Michael the Archangel Roman Catholic Church on Sunday morning,
kneeling, singing and praying before the locked doors of the
building that protesters had occupied for nearly a week.
   Diocese leaders closed the predominantly Polich church until
further notice early Saturday after police removed dissident
parishioners who had occupied the church to protest the transfers of
a popular pastor and an assistant priest and to demand that the
current pastor leave.
   ``The doors are locked, but we want to show the world we won't
quit,'' said Halina Chmiel of Milford, one of the leaders of the
protest.
   The Sunday morning rally lasted about an hour without any
incident.
   Mrs. Chmiel's husband, Henry, 35, and Franciszek Wojenski, 53, of
Bridgeport, were the only ones arrested when 40 police officers, who
arrived on a school bus, marched single file to clear the church
early Saturday morning.
   The others left voluntarily, ending the protesters' ``pray-in''
that began Feb. 11. Regular church activities continued during the
protest.
   The police action came hours after negotiations between church
authorities and the protesters ended in an emotional, shouting melee
inside the church. The group rejected appeals to leave from the Rev.
Laurence R. Bronkiewicz, the diocese's vicar for clergy, and a
visiting Franciscan superior from Gdansk, Poland, the Very Rev. Leon
Rawalski.
   The protesters also rejected an appeal from the former assistant
pastor they want to return, the Rev. Roman Palaszewski, who is being
transferred back to Poland. He made a surprise visit to the church
late Friday, his first appearance since his removal in December.
   No officials of the diocese were available for comment Sunday
about when the church would be reopened, the diocese answering
service said.
   The protesters charge that the current church leadership are
diluting the Polish traditions of the church, which is located in a
predominantly Hispanic neighborhood.

<TEXT>
   The known world population of one of the
rarest plants in North America has increased more than tenfold with
the discovery of about 100 of the endangered plants in the Aleutian
Islands
   Before the discovery of the Aleutian-Shield fern plants last
summer on Adak Island, biologists thought only six of the plants
were left on Earth. Botanists examining plant life on the island's
Mount Reed found the new pocket of Shield ferns not far from
previously known plants.
   The fern is unique to two islands in the Aleutians. Botanists say
they believe it is a survivor from pre-glacial times, living in a
few mountain areas that escaped the glaciers. The harsh climate in
those areas and possible grazing by animals prevented the ferns from
spreading after the glaciers receded, they say.
   The discovery has raised hopes the ferns will not become extinct.
   Biologists from the federal Fish and Wildlife Service are
studying ways to protect the surviving plants and help the
population grow, perhaps by growing the plants in a controlled
environment, said Walter O. Stieglitz, regional director for the
agency.

   A new group calling itself the ``Black
Cats'' executed 20 Sinhalese men in central villages in the first
major violence since election results were announced last week,
military officials said Sunday.
   The officials said the victims were members of the People's
Liberation Front, an ultranationalist Sinhalese militant group
opposing the Sinhalese-dominated government's moves to grant limited
autonomy to Tamils in the north and east.
   In the north, at least four Tamils were killed and six injured in
factional clashes between two groups of rebel Tamil militias,
military officials said.
   Soldiers discovered the bodies of the 20 young Sinhalese men late
Saturday, shot through the head with their arms tied behind their
backs, many of them partially burned, said officials of the military
joint operations command, who cannot be quoted under briefing rules.
   The bodies were found in the villages of Vijithapura and Siripura
in Anuradhapura district, 105 miles northeast of Colombo in the
Sinhalese heartland of central Sri Lanka, officials said.
   Notices found near the bodies claimed the killings were carried
out by the ``Black Cats,'' the officials said.
   Officials said they had never heard of the group.
   The killings were the first since President Ranasinghe
Premadasa's United National Party won parliamentary polls in results
declared Thursday, the officials said.
   At least 1,000 people, including 14 candidates for the
legislature, were killed during the five-week election campaign that
began Jan. 6, threatened by Sinhalese and Tamil militants.
   Most of the deaths were blamed on the People's Liberation Front,
while police blamed Tamil extremists for a few killings, mostly in
the north of the island.
   Militant Tamils claim they are discriminated against by the
mostly Buddhist Sinhalese majority who make up 75 per cent of the
island's population, in education, employment and culture.
   They have waged a secessionist war for an independent Tamil
homeland since 1983, in which more than 8,500 people, mostly
Sinhalese civilians, have been killed.
   Also Saturday, four members of a former Tamil guerrilla
organization, the Eelam Revolutionary Organization of Students were
killed in fights between them and members of the Eelam People's
Revolutionary Liberation Front. Six others were injured, military
officials said.
   The clashes took place in Jaffna in the north and Batticaloa in
eastern Sri Lanka, but details were not immediately available, the
officials said.
   Mostly Hindu Tamils comprise 18 per cent of Sri Lanka's 16
million people and are in a slight majority in northern and eastern
Sri Lanka.
   Sinhalese militants also have unleashed a bloody campaign against
the government for making too many concessions to minority Tamils.
More than 1,500 people, mostly Sinhalese government supporters, have
fallen victim to the Sinhalese militant backlash since July 1987.

<HEAD>Report: Tests Show Once-Promising AIDS Drug Is Apparently Ineffective</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Research shows a once-promising AIDS drug that
has become a popular underground treatment is unlikely to be
effective against the killer disease, according to a report
published Sunday.
   Oral dextran, believed to be used by thousands of people infected
with the AIDS virus, does not appear to be significantly absorbed
into the bloodstream, apparently rendering it ineffective, the Los
Angeles Times reported.
   The preliminary results of government-sponsored studies on humans
and animals have been known to researchers for more than a month
without a public announcement, Dr. Frank E. Young, commissioner of
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, told the Times.
   He said the decision to remain quiet reflected the preliminary
nature of the data and his fears that an announcement could dash the
hopes of people with AIDS taking the drug.
   The Japanese-manufactured drug had been considered a promising
experimental therapy after studies showed the compound could prevent
the AIDS virus from infecting immune system cells in test tubes and
interfere with the virus' ability to kill the cells.
   But Young said early findings that the drug is not significantly
absorbed into the bloodstream suggest oral dextran ``does not have
the promise of effectiveness that a lot of people thought and that
we hoped prior to having this information.''
   Dr. Daniel Hoth, director of the AIDS Program at the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, cautioned that the
results are preliminary and that it is ``theoretically possible''
for the compound to be absorbed over time.
   Officials at the institute and university researchers are hoping
to better answer questions about oral dextran based on data now
being reviewed from a six-month, 60-patient study of the drug.
   ``I don't think there is any great mystery about why there has
been no announcement,'' Hoth said. ``We are dealing with scientific
complexity, and we want to make sure that everything is pulled
together before making a strong public statement.''
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, attacks the body's
ability to fight off disease and infection. There is no known cure,
but therapies using the drug AZT appear to prolong the lives of some
AIDS patients.
   Young said he ``felt compelled to answer honestly'' questions
about the effectiveness of oral dextran as another treatment.
   In the meantime, he strongly warned people against injecting the
drug directly into their bloodstream, saying the practice ``could be
very, very harmful.''
   Dextran, a potent blood thinner, can cause bleeding, infections
or severe allergic reactions when it is injected. Previous data has
suggested oral dextran taken by mouth does not have harmful effects.
   Oral dextran, an inexpensive drug manufactured by Ueno Fine
Chemical Industry Ltd. of Osaka, Japan, has been sold in Japan for
many years as a treatment for atherosclerosis, or fatty collections
in the arteries.
   The drug has been imported over the last two years by ``buyers'
clubs'' organized by people infected with the AIDS virus.
   The FDA has allowed AIDS patients to legally import small
quantities of unapproved medicines for personal use against AIDS and
other diseases.

   Kevin Conway gives a dazzling performance as a
victorious Wall Street villain you don't hate in off-Broadway's
``Other People's Money.''
   ``Other People's Money'' at the Minetta Lane Theater is a skate
across the frozen pond of corporate takeover. Playwright Jerry
Sterner guides the audience, fast, through the jargon _ poison pill,
greenmail. Not everybody may grar and much easier to follow than last season's
``Serious Money,'' which hopped around in time, place and subject
and often had brokers all yelling at once.
   Conway plays Lawrence Garfinkle, originally from the Bronx, now
known as Larry the Liquidator because he buys stock in companies
worth more dead than alive and finishes them off.
   Andrew Jorgenson (Arch Johnson) is the elderly owner of New
England Wire and Cable, proud that the company is debt-free, though
not what it once was, and that employs 1,200 people in his Rhode
Island town.
   But Garfinkle's real opposition is Kate Sullivan, fledgling Wall
Street lawyer whose mother, Bea (Scotty Bloch), is Jorgenson's
secretary. The acting of Mercedes Ruehl, who was in the film
``Married to the Mob,'' nearly equals Conway's.
   When Larry the Liquidator and Kate meet, both smart, with savvy,
charm and wit, the verbal sparks fly.
   Kate is hampered by Jorgenson in her fight to keep the company
from being taken over; he is so principled that he won't use any
ploy that harms the employees or the stockholders.
   Larry sees it as a game. When Bea offers him $1 million to go
away, he refuses because he can make more by not going away. Though
Kate is working for hometown and mother, it's clear that the game is
also the thrill.
   James Murtaugh has the thankless duty of commenting on the
action, as a manager long groomed to take over the company when
Jorgenson retires.
   ``Other People's Money'' opened Thursday in the Hartford Stage
Company production. Gloria Muzio directed. Jerrfrey Ash and Susan
Quint Gallin produced in association with Dennis Grimaldi.
   The playwright left the business world six years ago, at 44, to
write plays. This is his second effort presented off-Broadway.

<TEXT>
   Several communities in well-to-do Marin
County are raising a stink about a booming skunk population and some
residents are getting desperate.
   ``People are calling in saying they are seeing them (skunks) all
over the place, not just in the rural areas,'' said Wendy O'Neil, an
assistant at the Marin Wildlife Center. ``It's really widespread.
   ``We're getting some pretty unusual requests, too. Like people
asking where to buy stun guns.''
   The wildlife center has been averaging 20 to 30 calls a day about
the stinky critters and the Marin Humane Society is taking about 25
complaints a day from people saying the little black and whites have
set up housekeeping in their basements.
   The society is planning a seminar called ``Skunks: Whose House Is
It, Anyway?''
   Esther Silver, owner of a Point Reyes Station bookstore, knows
only too well.
   During the past three weeks, Silver has trapped six skunks under
her shop and adjacent rental unit, and is trying to catch more.
Meanwhile, she's burning scented candles in her shop.
   ``It's a constant struggle,'' she said. ``You can't even drive
over the hill to San Rafael without going through three areas of
skunk smells. Everybody's complaining.''

<HEAD>Environmentalists Opposed To One Proposed Spaceport Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists across the country will
fight attempts to build the nation's first commercial spaceport at a
site on the northern part of Kennedy Space Center, a Florida
activist warns.
   ``This is one of those fall-on-your-sword-and-die issues,'' said
Charles Lee, senior vice president of the Florida Audubon Society.
   The state hopes to build a $58 million Spaceport Florida within
three years at either Kennedy Space Center or the adjacent Cape
Canaveral Air Force Station.
   But more than a dozen environmentalist and civic groups plan to
oppose any attempt to locate the spaceport on a part of the space
center known as Shiloh that is managed as a park by the Merritt
Island National Wildlife Refuge.
   ``If the Shiloh site remains, you will probably see opposition to
Spaceport Florida on a nationwide level,'' Lee said.
   Building at Shiloh would increase construction costs by 20
percent, but state officials prefer it because they want to avoid
restrictions on funding and access posed by using a military
installation, according to Chris Shove, director of the state
Department of Commerce's space programs office.
   Lee said letting public officials give chunks of parkland for
commercial ventures would set a bad precedent. The launch facility
also would restrict public access to the wildlife refuge and
Canaveral National Seashore, and highly toxic rocket fuels would
endanger nearby environmentally sensitive areas, critics of the
proposal say.
   ``We all support putting it at Canaveral Air Force Station,''
said Reid Hughes, a Volusia County environmentalist. ``Perhaps it
would be best to eliminate the controversy now and drop the Shiloh
site.''
   State officials met with environmental and civic groups Friday in
Orlando to answer questions, and more meetings will be held.
   ``If significant environmental impact is shown at Shiloh, the
project will be stopped,'' Shove said. ``But I don't think there's
been any evidence of that yet.''
   Under the Shiloh plan, the state initially would build one launch
pad on a 50-acre area. As demand increased for commercial launches,
three more pads could be added, he said.
   At the Canaveral base, three launch pads abandoned by the
military could be used after extensive renovations.
   State officials expect to pick the final site within six months
and start a detailed environmental study of both areas shortly
after, Shove said. But if the Legislature refuses Gov. Bob
Martinez's request for the first $10 million for the project this
spring, Spaceport Florida may be shelved.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
met Sunday with King Hussein and said he hopes to persuade Israeli
officials this week to abandon their ``stubborn'' stand against the
Arabs.
   Shevardnadze offered new proposals for advancing the peace
process Saturday in Damascus, the first stop on his 10-day Middle
East tour.
   He left Amman for Egypt on Sunday night after a 7{-hour stay and
told reporters that he would meet both Israeli Foreign Minister
Moshe Arens and Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser
Arafat in Cairo.
   He is also to visit Iraq and Iran before returning home Feb. 27
from a trip that is pushing the Soviet Union closer to the heart of
Middle East peace efforts.
   Shevardnadze told reporters before his talks with Hussein that he
was giving the king a letter from Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
that touched on ``the Middle East issue and the peaceful march to
solve this question.''
   He also met separately with Prime Minister Zaid Rifai and Foreign
Minister Marwan Kassem.
   ``Only through dialogue and convincing can one overcome the
stubbon Israeli stand,'' Shevardnadze said in a news conference
before leaving Damascus. ``I hope I can convince him (Arens).''
   Shevardnadze said in Jordan that the PLO and Arabs had made great
efforts toward an international conference. ``The rest now awaits
the Israeli position. We will discover it through our meetings with
the Israeli foreign minister.''
   Shevardnadze is the first Soviet foreign minister to visit
Jordan, a country which historically leaned to the West.
   Asked on departure about resuming relations with Israel, broken
during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, the Soviet minister replied:
``First let us convene the conference and then there will be no
problems on diplomatic issues.''
   Restoration of relations is an Israeli condition for a Soviet
role in peace talks and the two nations recently began consular
contacts.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told Israel Radio on Sunday
that the meeting with Arens would be a ``positive phenomenon.''
   He also said he would welcome Arab-Israeli peace talks under U.S.
and Soviet sponsorship _ a plan suggested by former U.S. Secretary
of State George Shultz in 1987.
   But Shamir did not refer to the proposals Shevardnadze revealed
Saturday night in Damascus for a U.N.-sponsored Middle East peace
conference within six to nine months.
   The Soviet minister suggested the foreign ministers of the five
permanent U.N. Security Council states _ Britain, China, France, the
Soviet Union and United States _ begin preparation for the
conference.
   They would then contact the parties involved and ``assume the
function of a preparatory body for the conference.''
   The United Nations as a whole also help the parties involved work
out their differences, he said.
   But he told reporters in Amman that ``no country can come up with
a proposal acceptable to all parties from the beginning. What is
required a united effort to prepare an acceptable plan to convene
and international conference.
   ``Therefore, I say I do not have a special proposal in my
pocket.''
   Shevardnadze said in Syria he had sent a letter to U.S. Secretary
of State James Baker before his tour and that he would meet Baker in
Vienna on March 6 ``to coordinate stands on the Middle East.''
   Shevardnadze's tour is evidence of a growing Soviet role in
Middle East peace efforts at a time that U.S. action is largely
stalled by the change of administrations in Washington.

   Troops wounded 11 Arabs during sporadic clashes
on Sunday, Arab reports said, and Palestinians in the occupied lands
shut down businesses to begin a three-day strike to press for an
independent homeland.
   In Jerusalem, shrieks, scuffles and a cry of ``Death to all
terrorists!'' disrupted the funeral of Shlomo Cohen, a 21-year-old
soldier who was stabbed to death Saturday as he walked unarmed near
Jerusalem's walled Old City.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin blamed the Palestine Liberation
Organization for Cohen's death and the suspected kidnapping of
another Israeli soldier, Sgt. Avi Sasportaz, who has been missing
for three days.
   ``The two incidents, it is not possible that they were not
organized by a group and I believe that it was connected to a terror
group,'' Rabin said on Israel radio. ``Read that as the PLO.''
   ``I recommend to those overseas, who cling to the foot of (PLO
chairman Yasser) Arafat, the PLO is terror,'' he said. ``The PLO has
not rejected terror, both in Israel and outside.''
   Thousands of soldiers, police and civilian volunteers continued
the search for Sasportaz on Sunday, and his mother Rachel issued an
impassioned plea on Israel radio, begging the kidnappers to ``Please
give me him alive, don't kill him.''
   The three-day general strike to demand an independent Palestine
is the longest work stoppage called by pro-PLO underground leaders
since Palestinians began their 14-month-old revolt against Israel's
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Arab news reports said the first strike day was fully observed.
But Israel radio said some Palestinian workers showed up for jobs in
Israel.
   Soldiers trying to prevent stoning attacks Sunday clamped curfews
on three neighborhoods and refugee camps in the Gaza Strip,
confining 45,000 Palestinians to their homes, and sealed off 13
alleys in the Khan Yunis refugee camp.
   Sporadic protests erupted, however, and troops were stoned and
responded with gunfire in at least three incidents, wounding eleven
people, according to Arab reports.
   The army confirmed five of the wounded and said it was
investigating the other incidents.
   In Jerusalem, 1,000 mourners held an emotional military funeral
for Cohen, who was on leave and in civilian clothes when he was
attacked.
   ``We see that the people of the PLO and their supporters speak
with knives,'' Prime Minister Yitzak Shamir told mourners.
   No Palestinian group has claimed responsibility for the killing.
   ``Jewish blood cannot be spilled without being avenged!'' shouted
one man, among a few people who disrupted the service for about 10
minutes. Other mourners tried to calm down protesters, who finally
were removed by police.
   Cohen, a former seminary student, was the 16th Israeli killed
since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987. At least 383 Palestinians
have been killed in that time.
   In another development:
   _Israel radio said an 18-year-old Palestinian jailed for security
offenses was found stabbed to death in Beersheba prison in southern
Israel. Police believe he was killed by another Arab inmate for as
yet unknown reasons, the radio said.
   _Israel ordered prominent Arab journalist Samaan Khouri detained
for six months without trial after he participated in recent
meetings with left-wing Israelis. Khouri works part-time for Agence
France Presse news agency and was detained for 4{ months as a
suspected PLO activist last year.

<TEXT>
   A former principal accused of making
racist remarks about blacks to white students acknowledges some of
the allegations made by black teachers, a school administrator said.
   Charles Walker, who is white, resigned Friday as principal of
Northeast High School because of a letter from several black
teachers alleging that he told white cheerleaders that associating
with blacks would degrade them, and that ``black students are
inferior to them because of their color.''
   ``Mr. Walker confirmed some of it but not all of it. In Mr.
Walker's opinion, there was sufficient substance to render him
ineffective,'' Donald Hoover, associate superintendent of East Baton
Rouge Parish schools, said Saturday.
   Hoover said Walker acknowledged an error in judgment in calling
the meeting with the white students, but that the situation ``was
not as dramatic as painted.''
   ``Some of the things that letter said he had said are not true,''
Hoover added. ``Stating outright that blacks are inferior to whites,
Mr. Walker vehemently denies that.''
   Walker has an unlisted phone number and could not be reached for
comment. He will be assigned to the school system's central office,
Hoover said.
   ``I think it was a good move to move him out of the reach of
children. People like that should not go into education in a
multiracial system,'' said G. Washington Eames, president of the
NAACP's chapter in Baton Rouge.

   A real-estate developer who recently
purchased one of Newport's famed mansions has riled some of his
neighbors by building a fence along the popular Cliff Walk.
   Joseph Mele, who paid $2 million for the mansion once owned by
novelist Edith Wharton, said he decided to build the fence because
hikers on the Cliff Walk were crossing his property and leaving
litter behind.
   A number of residents have complained in recent weeks that the
fence would force strollers onto dangerous rocks closer to the ocean
than the present route of the walk, which winds around several miles
of the Rhode Island coastline.
   ``The way he's pushing the walk out to the edge of the water,
he's putting people's lives in danger,'' said resident Robert Byron.
   ``I really dislike it when people say that I'm taking something
away, when I'm putting something up on my own property,'' said Mele,
of Washington, adding that he has left plenty of room for hikers.
   ``In some places, I've left them 30 yards,'' he said. ``Except
for a couple of places, I left enough room for people to walk side
by side.''

<HEAD>Federal Investigators Cite `Wall of Secrecy' In Fernald Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Department of Energy is being so
secretive about its uranium processing plant in nearby Fernald that
federal investigations and cleanup efforts have been hampered, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
   Investigators from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and
staffs of Senate and House members have complained of heavy secrecy
by the Energy Department, The Cincinnati Enquirer reported.
   ``The problem with these people (at the Energy Department) ... is
that they think Harry Truman is still president and the Cold War is
still going on,'' the newspaper quoted an unidentified Senate staff
member as saying.
   The newspaper cited several examples of difficulties
investigators claim to have encountered.
   _The Energy Department told federal and state EPA investigators
that documents they requested cannot be obtained, but then provided
copies of those documents to Cincinnati lawyers suing the plant's
former operator, NLO Inc., for $300 million.
   ``I've never seen a situation like this,'' said Stan Chesley,
lead attorney in the suit on behalf of people who live and work
within a five-mile radius of the plant.
   ``I assumed, naively, that every governmental agency cooperates
with every other governmental agency. They're so used to hiding
behind clouds of secrecy that they can't seem to come into the '80s
and get the problems resolved.''
   _Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, an outspoken critic of Fernald, was
told by the Energy Department that the federal EPA had withdrawn its
inspectors from the plant before telling the company now under
contract to operate the plant, Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio,
that it had done so.
   _The Energy Department filed court papers last fall saying it had
ignored and underfunded pollution control at Fernald but did not
tell Westinghouse. Company spokesmen learned of the controversial
filing, which provoked widespread outrage and a congressional
hearing, in conversation with a reporter, the Enquirer reported.
   Westinghouse, which is supervising cleanup, said it finds its
credibility dented when it is asked to comment on revelations it has
not heard about.
   The Energy Department denies secrecy over the plant is a problem.
   ``In an organization as big as DOE, there's always an opportunity
to improve communications, but there's nothing deliberate going
on,'' said spokesman Steve Wyatt at the agency's Oak Ridge, Tenn.,
operations office, which oversees Fernald.
   Critics say the Energy Department's resistance to sharing
information ranges from embarrassing to dangerous. Cleanup cannot
start until the agencies accurately account for radioactive and
chemical waste at the plant.
   The federal Centers for Disease Control is awaiting a complete
accounting of radioactive emissions from the plant during its
38-year history so it can begin its study of possible health effects
on workers and neighbors of the plant.

   A tawny eagle on display took an
unscheduled flight Sunday as Britain's Prince Charles returned for
his second polo match during a weekend visit to benefit an animal
conservation group.
   The eagle flew off shortly after the Prince of Wales arrived at
the Palm Beach Polo and Country Club for the match to raise funds
for the Friends of Conservation. The eagle, part of a display of
African and American animals, was later retrieved after it landed
nearby.
   More than 8,000 came out for the event in 80-degree weather.
   Ethel Hanos, a retiree from Hollywood, Fla., said she came for a
bit of royalty watching, along with the polo.
   ``I have enjoyed the polo matches before,'' she said, ``but I am
hoping to get a glimpse of him.''
   The prince's motorcade was escorted by nine police motorcycles
and two police cruisers. The prince emerged from the limousine
wearing a light blue shirt, navy blazer and white riding pants.
   The prince's Windsor Park team later trounced the club's team,
9-5, although all he managed was one assist. In the first match of
the weekend, Charles scored one goal Saturday to lead his team to a
10-7 victory over a team from Greenwich, Conn.
   The prince is on his fifth trip to Florida since 1980 and wasn't
accompanied by his wife, Diana, or their two children.
   Saturday's match was the first Prince of Wales Cup match, while
Sunday's was for the Rolex Challenge Cup.
   The Friends of Conservation raises funds for the preservation of
African wildlife. The organization was founded by the prince's
friends, Geoffrey and Jorie Kent.
   The prince was a guest at the Kents' ranch during his weekend
trip. The Kents also hosted the heir to the British throne during
his last visit in March.
   Charles _ protected by a 150-member security detail from Scotland
Yard, private security agents and local sheriff's deputies _ planned
to leave Florida Monday morning. His next scheduled stop was an
official visit to the Caribbean island of St. Lucia.

<HEAD>Italy Cracks Soviet Spy Ring, Reports Say</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout with report that two spy rings involved, KGB
reputedly seeking informaton on fiber optics; no pickup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities arrested two people on charges they tried
to give top-secret NATO documents to the Soviet Union, including
information on a new computer system that can direct an entire
battle, news reports said Sunday.
   The arrests broke one and perhaps two KGB operations, the reports
said.
   ``It could be the biggest counter-espionage operation in Europe
in recent years,'' said Rome's La Repubblica.
   Prosecutors and police confirmed two people were arrested for
espionage, but refused to give details, saying the investigation was
continuing.
   The Italian news agency AGI reported Sunday the arrests ended two
separate KGB operations in Italy.
   The reports about the affair, carried by newspapers and the
state-run RAI television, identified those arrested as Giorgio
Stancich, an electronics technician living in Yugoslavia; and
Natalino Francalanci, a fur dealer from Pontedera, near Pisa.
   Francalanci, 51, was arrested Feb. 11 in the Ligurian port city
of La Spezia. Stancich, 42, was arrested Thursday near the Adriatic
port of Trieste, the reports said.
   Newspapers said Francalanci traveled often to Eastern Europe on
business. RAI said his arrest was in connection with NATO research
on anti-submarine warfare.
   AGI said that Francalanci was linked to an alleged Soviet effort
to procure information about the making of fiber optics for industry
and the military.
   Stancich worked for IRET, a joint Italian-Yugoslavian firm in
Trieste that manufactures electronic communications systems for
civilian and military use, the reports said. He commuted to work
from Skofje, just across the border in Yugoslavia where he lives.
   The reports said Stancich was arrested while trying to cross the
border with documents related to a highly advanced electronic
warfare project known as Catrin, said to be one of the most
sophisticated systems of its kind and destined for use by NATO.
   The project, still under development, involves computer systems
capable of directing activity on an entire battefield, including
ground and air operations, the reports said.
   Milan's Corriere Della Sera reported that the operation was
coordinated across the Yugoslav border by KGB agents apparently
working without the knowledge of the Yugoslav government. The
newspaper quoted unidentified sources as identifying one agent as a
former Tass news agency correspondent in Rome.
   RAI said the classified information was to have been sent from
Yugoslavia to KGB agents in Austria.
   AGI said that in the other operation, the KGB was seeking to
obtain information on the technology used by Otomelara, a La Spezia
firm that makes fiber optics.
   It said Italian agents, posing as suppliers of information,
discovered that two Italians had been bringing information about the
technology to the KGB in Vienna.
   AGI said the two Italians were Francalanci and another man who
had escaped to another, unidentified country.

<HEAD>Attorneys Say About 200 Fasting in Natal Province</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DURBAN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 200 black prisoners in Natal
province are refusing to eat until they receive the same sort of
attention that authorities gave another group of fasting inmates,
lawyers said Sunday.
   The Natal province prisoners have been on a hunger strike since
last week and their attorneys say they are trying to arrange a
meeting with Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok.
   Vlok last week met with another group of civil rights lawyers
representing about 200 other hunger strikers in the Cape and
Transvaal provinces. Vlok agreed to free a number of detainees in
the next two weeks.
   Both groups, whose members are being held without charges under
state of emergency regulations, began hunger strikes to demand that
they either be freed or charged.
   But lawyers for the Natal province hunger strikes, in a
statement, said they are unsure whether Vlok's promise applies to
their group.
   The attorneys said about 200 detainees are on a hunger strike in
the Westville prison in Durban, the prison at Pietermaritzburg, and
in police cells throughout the province.
   A total of about 300 prisoners initially went on a hunger strike
three weeks ago to protest their jailing. Some subsequently ended
their strike and others joined it. They are represented by two
groups of lawyers, and it was difficult to determine how many remain
on a hunger strike.
   More than 20 hunger strikers have been hospitalized, prompting
Vlok to hold meetings last week with lawyers, clergymen and
relatives of about 200 detainees.
   For the first time he received information other than that
supplied by his policemen on why certain people were considered a
danger to the community.
   Vlok said Saturday that in the future he would assign a senior
police officer to investigate factors such as family circumstances,
the detainee's attitudes and his job possibilities so that those
things can be considered in deciding whether a detainee should be
freed.
   Monitoring groups have said more than 30,000 people, mostly
black, have been detained for some period of time during the state
of emergency, which permits indefinite incarceration without charges
or trial.
   Vlok has never given a total figure, but the periodic reports he
must make to Parliament have added up to approximately 30,000. He
said two weeks ago that there were fewer than 1,000 people in
detention at that time.
   The national state of emergency was declared on June 12, 1986,
and some of the hunger strikers have been held without charge since
then.

   Tim Doberstein, a romantic who always
wanted to propose like a knight of old, was relieved when his
girlfriend said ``yes.''
   Otherwise, it would have been a miserable ride in the rain on a
pregnant horse when Doberstein dressed up like a knight to ask
Cheryl Hash to marry him.
   Doberstein, 28, donned the makeshift suit of armor, complete with
a small plastic sword, shield and battle ax on Saturday after
telling Hash, 26, he needed to step out for a few minutes.
   He saddled up Darlin, a small brown horse that's more than six
months pregnant, and rode up to the house while a friend tried get
Hash outside by calling her on a portable telephone. The line was
busy.
   ``Go knock on the door!'' Doberstein screamed at his friend, Ted
Neuner, as neighbors began to stare.
   Neuner tried to phone again and got through. ``Come outside
quick,'' he told Hash.
   Hash emerged from the house and saw the horse riding towards her
with its suited rider.
   ``Oh my God!'' she said as the horse drew near. ``I know that's
you. I recognize your tennis shoes.''
   Undeterred, Doberstein swept down from the horse, bent down on
one knee before Hash and asked her to marry him.
   ``I will,'' she replied.

   Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on
Sunday rejected the apology of British writer Salman Rushdie and
exhorted Moslems around the world to ``send him to hell'' for his
novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   In a statement issued by the official Islamic Republic News
Agency, Khomeini said the ``imperialist foreign mass media are
falsely alleging that officials of the Islamic Republic said that if
the author of `The Satanic Verses' repents, the execution order
against him would be abolished. This is denied, 100 percent.
   ``Even if Salman Rushdie repents and becomes the most pious man
of time it is incumbent on every Moslem (to) employ everything he's
got, his life and wealth, to send him to hell,'' Khomeini was quoted
as saying.
   Khomeini, patriarch of the Islamic revolution, last week
sentenced Rushdie to death for his novel, which Moslems say insults
Islam.
   But Iranian President Ali Khamenei, allied with so-called
pragmatists led by parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, sought to
defuse the crisis Friday by saying Rushdie's life would be spared if
he apologized and repented.
   Rushdie, in hiding under the guard of Scotland Yard, issued an
apology Saturday.
   Khomeini's latest statement appeared to leave no room for a
negotiated settlement of the issue, which has put Britain's newly
restored relations with Iran in jeopardy.
   A bounty of $5.2 million has been put on Rushdie's head by
Iranian religious leaders since Khomeini issued the death sentence.
   In his message Sunday, Khomeini also called on non-Moslems to
help carry out the death sentence against Rushdie.
   ``If a non-Moslem becomes aware of his whereabouts and has the
ability to execute him quicker than a Moslem, it is incumbent on
Moslems to pay a reward or a fee in return for this action,'' the
statement said.
   Neither Khomeini's statement nor IRNA referred to the president's
offer of a reprieve, reflecting a widening rift in the Iranian
hierarchy over the Rushdie affair.
   In London, a spokesman for the British Foreign Office said: `We
heard of this report with great concern. We shall be considering
carefully its implications.
   ``This subject will, of course, be discussed in Brussels by the
Foreign Affairs Council'' on Monday, when Foreign Secretary Sir
Geoffrey Howe is to raise the issue, the spokesman said. He spoke on
condition of anonymity in keeping with British practice.
   The 41-year-old Rushdie, born to a Moslem family in India, has
not been seen in public since Thursday, two days after Khomeini's
first decree.
   In his apology issued through an agent, Rushdie said: ``As author
of `The Satanic Verses' I recognize that Moslems in many parts of
the world are genuinely distressed by the publication of my novel. I
profoundly regret the distress that publication has occasioned to
sincere followers of Islam.''
   Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes their religion by
portraying the prophet Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and
suggesting that he wrote the Koran, the holy book of Islam, rather
than receiving it directly from God.
   ``The Satanic Verses'' is banned in Iran, India, Pakistan,
Bangladesh, Egypt and South Africa.
   Publishers in France, West Germany, Greece and Turkey have
decided not to publish the book, and some bookstore chains in the
United States have pulled it from their shelves.
   In New York Sunday, a spokesman said Cardinal John J. O'Connor
criticized both ``The Satanic Verses'' and those who threaten its
author, and implied Catholics should avoid reading the novel.
   ``He (O'Connor) encourages everyone not to dignify the
publication of this work, which has been viewed by Moslems as highly
sacrilegious and offensive,'' said Msgr. Peter Finn, a spokesman for
the cardinal.
   In Canada, the government decided to allow entry of the book
after a review determined it was not ``hate propaganda'' as defined
by Canadian law, National Revenue Minister Otto Jelinek announced.
Canada had blocked imports of the book after receiving a complaint
from a Moslem group.
   The European Conference of Foreign Press Associations Sunday
called Khomeini's order an ``act of terrorism against freedom of
conscience, of religion and of opinion, values which are held to be
the truest expression of a civil and more human world.''
   Representatives of the group, in Rome for a three-day meeting,
sent a telegram to the Iranian ambassador to Italy and to the Holy
See.
   In Yugoslavia, the leading Communist Party daily began printing
excerpts of ``The Satanic Verses'' in its early Monday edition.
   The printing of the excerpts in the daily Borba coincides with
the arrival Monday of Khamenei on a three-day visit to Yugoslavia,
the Iranian president's first official trip to a European country.

<TEXT>
   Lebanon's top Moslem and Christian religious
leaders arrived in Kuwait on Sunday for talks aimed at ending the
14-year-old Lebanese civil war and avoiding permanent partition of
the country.
   The talks, to begin Monday, were organized by the seven-member
Arab League committee charged with seeking a settlement of the
political crisis that has left Lebanon without a president for the
past 147 days.
   The leaders arriving from Beirut Sunday were Maronite Catholic
Partriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, Greek Catholic Patriarch Maximos Hakim,
Sunni Moslem Grand Mufti Sheik Hassan Khaled, the acting chairman of
the Supreme Shiite Moslem Council, Sheik Mohammed Mehdi Shamseddin;
and the supreme religious judge of the Druse community, Sheik Mursel
Nasr.
   The Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch Ignatius Hazim, spiritual
leader of an estimated 300,000 Lebanese, flew from his home in the
Syrian capital, Damascus.
   They were met by Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah Ahmed, who
heads the Arab League panel. Also on the panel are the foreign
ministers of Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Tunisia, Sudan and
Algeria and the league's Secretary-General Chedli Klibi.
   Before his departure, Patriarch Sfeir appealed to Lebanese army
commander Gen. Michel Aoun and Christian militia leader Samir Geagea
to avoid a recurrence of the clash between their forces last week
that shook Lebanon's Christian heartland. Aoun and Geagea are both
Maronites.
   Police said 76 people were killed and 200 wounded during two days
of fierce fighting between Aoun's 20,000 Christian regular soldiers
and the 6,000 iregulars of Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia, the
Christians' main force in the civil war with Moslems.
   The first stage of the talks was held in Tunisia last month, when
the committee probed the crisis separately with Aoun, who heads the
Christian Cabinet in Lebanon's dual government, and with his Sunni
rival, Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
   The two governments emerged when President Amin Gemayel appointed
Aoun prime minister of a caretaker military cabinet on Sept. 22,
minutes before his 6-year term ended. Parliament was unable to
convene to elect a successor.
   Moslems rejected Aoun's appointment, contending it violated an
unwritten national covenant dating to Lebanon's independence from
France in 1943. This covenant gave the premiership to the Sunnis,
the paliamentary speakership to the Shiites and the presidency to
the Maronites.
   Lebanon has been divided into Moslem and Christian de facto
cantons since the 1975 outbreak of the civil war that has claimed
more than 130,000 lives.
   Each enclave has been rocked by internal power struggles.
   Aoun, who makes no secret of his hopes to become Lebanon's next
president, is pressing for an unconditional withdrawal of Geagea's
militias from Christian east Beirut and all its suburbs as a
precondition for peace.
   Geagea says he will withdraw if he gets guarantees that the
Syrian army and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah will withdraw from west
Beirut.

   Relatives of Pan Am Flight 103
victims organized a committee Sunday to push for a congressional
investigation of the flight's bombing and to step up airline
security.
   ``If we don't organize ourselves in an effective way ... it will
be very difficult to go forward,'' said Paul Hudson, an attorney and
former counsel to the New York State Crime Victims Compensation
Board who started the network.
   Hudson's daughter, Melina, 16, was aboard the jetliner when it
blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, killing all 259
aboard, including 35 students enrolled in a Syracuse University
program, and 11 residents of Lockerbie.
   ``We've come to assist each other in our grief,'' Hudson said.
``We've come to try to insure that there are no more Flight 103
disasters for the air and families.''
   Seventy-five to 100 relatives, many with photographs of their
lost loved ones pinned to their chests, attended the meeting at a
restaurant to form the Victims of Pan Am Flight 103 committee.
   Last week, officials announced that the terrorist's bomb which
destroyed the Boeing 747 was traced to a portable radio stored among
the luggage. The plane was en route from London to New York.
   Besides giving support and aid to grieving relatives, the
committee will push for a congressional investigation of the
bombing, said Bill Ammerman, whose brother, Tom, was aboard Flight
103.
   Some committee members already have met with their local
lawmakers, including U.S. Sens. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., Al D'Amato,
R-N.Y., and Bill Bradley, D-N.J.
   Airline security procedures have not improved enough since the
explosion, Hudson said. ``It is far less than what is required to
give confidence in the security of the system,'' he said.
   The group will campaign for stronger security measures, including
installation of devices that detect plastic explosives.
   The families approved a resolution that calls for the resignation
of Paul Bremer, U.S. ambassador-at-large for counterterrorism. The
group said Bremer should resign because he has said airplane flight
crews and passengers do not need to know about all bomb threats.
   Bremer said earlier this month that the State Department will
make sure any airline travel warning issued to government employees
about terrorist threats will also go to the general public.
   He told the House Foreign Affairs Committee the American embassy
in Moscow violated policy in posting a warning about Pan American
flights from Frankfurt to the United States.
   The warning, which was not made public, came eight days before
Flight 103 was bombed.
   ``It is not our policy to alert government officials and not the
general public to such a threat,'' Bremer said at the time. ``There
is, and can be, no double standard.''
   But Bremer said the threats should not be announced at all,
because it would encourage ``copy-cat terrorist threats.''
   The Victims of Pan Am Flight 103 committee want major
international airlines to make public their policies regarding bomb
threats.

   Rescue operations were stepped up Sunday in a
jungle-covered region in northern Peru where flooding has killed at
least 40 people, officials said.
   The National Civil Defense office in Lima said Prime Minister
Armando Villanueva toured the flooded zone Sunday and reported
afterwards that 40 people had been killed and 30 others were missing.
   Officials said a layer of mud deposited by the receeding waters
could conceal other victims.
   The rain-swollen Gera and Indoche rivers jumped their banks
Friday and flooded a dozen small villages and settlements near
Moyobamba, 450 miles northeast of Lima, city officials said.
   Hundreds of farm families near Shucyacu, a tiny village 20 miles
south of Moyobamba were temporarily been driven from their homes,
which were damaged or destroyed by the flood waters, Civil Defense
said.
   Several Lima newspapers on Sunday gave death toll figures of up
to 60, but Civil Defense authorities, speaking on condition of
anonymity, declined to confirm the newspaper numbers.
   The army base in Tarapoto, 55 miles south of the flooded zone,
said more than 30 people had been killed.
   The inundated region, cut by dozens of small rivers and streams
which swell during the current rainy season, is on the
jungle-covered slopes of the eastern Andes Mountains.
   The village of Shucyacu was hardest hit, Moyobamba officials
said. The leading edge of the flood waters, which carried mud, tree
trunks and other debris, swept away at least 50 of the hamlets small
wooden homes with thatched roofs.
   Officials said about 6,000 people, mainly from farm families,
live in the flooded region, but it is still unknown how many have
suffered damage or loss.
   El Comercio said 35 people were missing and the flooding
destroyed about 200 homes. The newspaper said the army had sent
earth-moving equipment to help clear away mud left by the flood
waters.
   Moyobamba city councilman Adrian Mendoza said the area's most
important crops of rice and corn were destroyed.
   Officials said rescue operations were stepped up Sunday after
being slowed a day earlier by stormy weather, bad roads and the
flood waters.
   The flooding was sparked by heavy runoff from recent torrential
rains in the high Andes Mountains and in the foothills surrounding
Moyobamba, authorities said.

<HEAD>Vietnam Warns of Withdrawal Delay if No Settlement Reached in Cambodia</HEAD>

   Vietnam's foreign minister said Sunday
that a delay in finding a settlement to the Cambodian conflict may
delay withdrawal of his troops from the country.
   ``The best is a political solution, but we must prepare for the
worst ... If others don't want an early solution, then we must be
prepared for the worst,'' Nguyen Co Thach told a news conference at
the second round of multilateral peace talks.
   He repeated earlier promises that Hanoi would pull out its forces
by September if a political settlement can be reached by Cambodia's
warring factions. Otherwise, the withdrawal could be delayed until
December 1990, he said.
   Since 1970, Cambodia has suffered through a five-year war, a
reign of terror by the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1978, the Vietnamese
invasion on Christmas Day 1978, and a continuing guerrilla war.
   Millions have died in the land also known as Kampuchea.
   After years of deadlock, the warring parties and their neighbors
met informally in July in the first tentative step toward peace.
   The three-day gathering that opened Sunday is the second attempt
to end the Vietnamese occupation and push the tenuous negotiations
toward an international conference on the country's future.
   The key players in the negotiations are Vietnam, the government
it set up in Phnom Penh in early 1979, and a three-faction
resistance coalition.
   Also attending the talks are reprsentatives from Laos and the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations _ Thailand, Malaysia, Brunei,
Singapore, the Philippines and Indonesia.
   Indonesia arranged the talks as Asean's go-between with its
communist neighbors.
   Thach's remarks and a speech by Prime Minister Hun Sen of the
Phnom Penh government appeared designed to put early pressure on the
resistance coalition and their allies.
   ``The position of the two Kampuchean parties are still quite far
apart,'' Hun Sen said in prepared remarks.
   ``Postponement would only delay the Vietnamese armed forces'
withdrawal and the supply of military aid as well as to only prolong
the foreign interference into the Kampuchean conflict,'' he said.
   The resistance coalition includes the Khmer Rouge, by far the
strongest militarily; anti-communists led by former Prime Minister
Son Sann, and followers of former head of state Prince Norodom
Sihanouk.
   Sihanouk, who heads the coalition, boycotted the Jakarta meeting
because Hun Sen rejected his plans for peace. Hun Sen's own peace
plan has been rejected by the other side.
   Sihanouk's son, Prince Norodom Ranaridh, told the news conference
he was representing his father and would also function as spokesman
for the coalition. Sunday's opening consisted mostly of formalities
and a dinner.
   Mutual consultations were planned Monday morning with a plenary
session in the afternoon.

   A strong earthquake hit the capital and much of
northern Japan on Sunday, killing one person and injuring another,
shaking buildings and briefly halting some train and airline
service, officials said.
   The quake, registering 5.6 on the Richter scale, hit at 9:27 p.m.
(7:37 a.m. EST), said a spokesman for the Meteorological Agency. The
agency placed the epicenter about 36 miles underground near
Utsunomiya, 60 miles north of Tokyo.
   The quake also shook all of northern Honshu, Japan's main island,
a stretch about 360 miles long, but it caused no tidal waves, the
spokesman said.
   A local fire department official said Monday that Shigeo Ohikawa,
78, was taken to a hospital in Matsudo, east of Tokyo after
suffering shock. He later died of a heart attack, the Japan
Broadcasting Corp. and Kyodo News Service said.
   A 61-year-old man also was injured after he was hit on the head
by a falling vase at his home in Ibaraki, 63 miles northeast of
Tokyo, a National Police Agency official said. The man was taken to
a nearby hospital for treatment, said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   About 300 households in Chiba state east of Tokyo were forced to
go without electricity for about 70 minutes after a power supply
line was cut in the wake of the tremor, the police official said.
   Japan Railways officials said trains in northern Japan were
halted for about five minutes, while local train service near
Utsunomiya was still suspended 90 minutes after the temblor.
   Officials at the New Tokyo International Airport in Narita, 40
miles northeast of Tokyo, said they had closed the main runway to
check for damage, but after 13 minutes the runway was reopened.
   Subway trains in Tokyo also were stopped temporarily, including a
two-minute shutdown of the Hibiya Line, which runs under downtown
areas.
   ``We checked to see if there was any damage,'' said an official
less than one hour after the quake, ``but everything was all right
and the trains are running fine.''
   In central Tokyo, the quake rattled plate glass windows for about
a half minute, shook clocks on the wall and made chairs wobble.
   Japan is in a very active seismological area and has suffered
several major earthquakes in the past. The biggest this century was
in 1923, when about 140,000 Tokyo and its neighboring Yokohama
residents died in a quake and fires.
   The Richter scale, devised in 1935, is open-ended, with each
digit representing a ten-fold increase in magnitude. Thus a 6.6
reading is ten times greater than a 5.6.
   On the Richter scale, 5.0 can cause considerable damage, while a
6.0 can mean severe damage in populated areas.

<HEAD>Church Calls For Accord During Meeting Between Guerrillas, Parties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic Church on
Sunday urged guerrilla leaders and politicans to reach an accord
this week that will bring peace in the country.
   Guerrilla leaders and representatives of all major Salvadoran
political parties are to meet in Mexico on Monday to discuss a rebel
demand that the March 19 elections be delayed until September.
   The rebels say they will recognize the legitimacy of the next
elected government if the balloting were delayed, and if safeguards
against fraud were in place.
   Monsignor Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary archbishop of San
Salvador, said the date of elections ``is one of the points of the
(guerrilla) proposal most easily resolved.
   ``Our emphasis is this: how, by changing the date of elections,
do we achieve a complete guarantee that the war will end in by
September? If that can be achieved, I think that not only some
parties, but the immense majority would say `Of course, we'll change
the date of elections.'''
   The rebels have boycotted and condemned as sham the previous
elections this decade.
   The government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte and the armed
forces have all but ruled out acceptance of the guerrilla propsosal.
   Guillermo Ungo, presidential candidate of the leftist Democratic
Convergence and a participant in Monday's meeting, told The
Associated Press on Saturday he did not expect much to come of the
Mexico talks.
   A breakthrough would depend on unanimous acceptance of
postponement by the political parties. The rightist Republican
Nationalist Alliance, which is favored to win in March, has opposed
postponement.
   An estimated 70,000 people have been killed in the 9-year-old
civil war between the leftist guerrillas and the U.S.-backed
government.

   A man visiting his girlfriend in a hospital
room stabbed an apparent rival Sunday, then chased the bleeding
victim twice around the hospital's orthopedic ward before he
collapsed, police said.
   No one else was injured, said police and officials at the
hospital, St. Anthony Medical Center.
   The victim, Javon Perry, 19, was listed in critical condition
Sunday afternoon. The suspect, Kendal Banks, 30, was arrested and
charged with felonious assault, police said.
   The noontime stabbing followed an argument between the two men in
the woman's hospital room, said police detective Robert Locke.
   Banks pulled out a 3{-inch steak knife and stabbed Perry in the
neck, said hospital security officer, Paul Parker. Perry ran out of
the room and Banks pursued him until Perry collapsed, bleeding
profusely, Parker said.

<TEXT>
   A Boeing subsidiary may have curtailed testing of
high-tech nuts and bolts destined for use in the new Air Force B-2
stealth bomber in order to save money, according to a published
report Sunday.
   The supplier of those nuts and bolts is now under investigation,
suspected of supplying substandard parts stamped as approved by a
fictitious ``Inspector 11.''
   The Seattle Times reported that an internal memo declared that
Boeing Advanced Systems had the testing of incoming fasteners
curtailed just as a federal task force began the investigation into
fraud in the aerospace fastener industry. Only ``suspect'' parts
would be tested, the memo stated.
   Among the parts that may have escaped routine testing by Boeing
were high-tech titanium nuts and bolts manufactured by a Chatsworth,
Calif., company called Voi-Shan, a division of Fairchild Industries,
the newspaper said.
   Boeing Advanced Systems in Seattle uses Voi-Shan nuts and bolts.
Boeing is manufacturing classified parts for the Stealth bomber,
made by the Northrop Corp.
   Two weeks ago, 20 federal agents seized 52 crates of documents,
test equipment and fasteners in a raid on Voi-Shan, the newspaper
said.
   The agents were searching for evidence to support allegations
made by three past and present Voi-Shan workers that no testing was
done on the fasteners, but the fasteners were given a stamp of
approval by a fictitious ``Inspector 11.''
   The Times said tests done on high-performance titanium fasteners,
used to hold together everything from engines to airframes, were of
particular concern.
   The newspaper also obtained Boeing and Voi-Shan shipping
documents that stated in the week before the raid, Boeing Advanced
Systems received two shipments of more than 200 Voi-Shan titanium
fasteners, with test reports certified by ``Inspector 11.''
   The Times, quoting an unidentified source, said those parts were
only two of many similar shipments designated for the B-2 project
last year.
   According to a memo obtained by the newspaper, a quality-control
manager at Boeing Advanced Systems ordered the routine testing of
incoming shipments of some fasteners stopped, apparently to save
money.
   The Feb. 18, 1988, memo directed at top managers of the Boeing
B-2 program stated: ``Effective immediately, routine receiving
inspection testing of fasteners is to be stopped. Only those
fasteners identified as suspect will be subject to test.'' The memo
said the company expected to save $53,000 by reducing testing from
March to October last year.
   Boeing spokesman Paul Binder confirmed that the memo was
legitimate, but declined further comment on it or any aspect of the
B-2 program.
   The company said its own investigation into the safety of the
Voi-Shan fasteners had turned up no problems, the Times said.
   Fairchild Industries, Voi-Shan's parent company, said last
Tuesday in a statement that it is investigating the charges against
Voi-Shan.
   Fairchild said there has been no claim from customers that it
shipped any unsafe fasteners and said Boeing resumed full-scale
testing of Voi-Shan parts two weeks ago, after the Voi-Shan raid.
   The task force, made up of agents of the FBI, the Internal
Revenue Service, the Navy, Air Force and U.S. attorney's office, and
a grand jury in Seattle are looking into charges of fraudulent
testing and falsified documentation of aerospace fasteners.
   Boeing stated that it is not a target of the investigation and is
cooperating with the task force. It also said it has its own
screening processes to test incoming parts.

<DATELINE>LINARES, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet-born chess player Viktor Korchnoi,
now a Swiss citizen, withdrew Sunday from the Seventh City of
Linares international chess tournament after organizers denied his
request to exclude a Soviet judge.
   Korchnoi told reporters he had sent a letter to the tournament's
organizers saying he would not play if Viktor Baturisnky of the
Soviet Union was the main judge.
   Korchnoi had problems with Baturinsky, a senior official in the
Soviet Chess Federation, when he played Anatoly Karpov in 1974, two
years before he sought asylum in the West. Karpov won 12.5-11.5.
   In his book ``Chess is My Life,'' Korchnoi accuses Baturisnky of
partiality in the match, in which he played Karpov for the right to
play Bobby Fischer of the United States for the world title.
   Korchnoi was scheduled to meet Vasili Ivanchuck of the Soviet
Union Sunday in the opening match of the 14-day tournament.
   ``I will only admit, as a great concession, that the organizers
could make (Baturinsky) a guest of honor, but nothing more,'' said
Korchnoi.
   Julio Gallardo, president of the Linares tournament organizing
committee, said Sunday he had not received Korchnoi's letter.
   Luis Rentero, technical director of the tournament, proposed that
Francisco Mena of Spain be the judge in the matches played by
Korchnoi, but he said Korchnoi refused.
   Korchnoi left for Madrid after a one-hour meeting between
players, judges and members of the organization, who confirmed
Baturinsky's position as main judge. He said he felt insulted by the
organizers.
   After Korchnoi left the tournament, the other players decided to
play as scheduled.
   Nigel Short of Britain defeated Karpov and Artur Yusupov of the
Soviet Union defeated fellow Soviet Andrei Sokolov.
   The three other matches in the opening round were adjourned. They
were: Jan Timman, Netherlands, v. Lajos Portisch, Hungary, Valeri
Gulkov, United States, v. Johan Hjartarson, Iceland, and Alexander
Beliavsky, Soviet Union, v. Ljomir Ljubojevic, Yugoslavia,

   The only candidate to replace Premier Ciriaco De Mita
as leader of Italy's most powerful party said Sunday he would not
try to bring down the government.
   Arnaldo Forlani is expected to be named secretary of the
Christian Democrat Party during its five-day special congress, which
began Saturday.
   His nomination was seen as a major defeat for De Mita, who
considers Forlani too conservative to back his programs in
Parliament and a threat to De Mita's 10-month-old coalition
government.
   Forlani indicated Sunday that De Mita would have to heed the
wishes of a new leadership.
   In a 1{-hour speech to party delegates, Forlani called for
support for the government, which he said had lacked steady backing
as it tried to cut the huge public deficit.
   ``The government's existence will never be threatened by
maneuvers in the (party),'' Forlani said.
   ``But it is on (the issue of) an economic cure that the future of
the government and of the alliance (of governing parties) rides,''
he warned.
   The party secretary is seen by many as the most influential
politician in Italy, since the Christian Democrats have dominated
every government for four decades.
   De Mita's candidates for secretary were defeated in party
wrangling prior to the congress. Nonetheless, the premier tried to
ensure support for his programs by asking congress Saturday to give
his leadership a vote of confidence.
   In his speech at a sports stadium in a neighborhood built by
dictator Benito Mussolini, Forlani called for party unity and
indicated the government would receive continued support if it stuck
by the wishes of the party.
   ``If we (the Christian Democrats) proceed united, the government
also will be at an advantage and can reinforce its actions,''
Forlani said.
   De Mita, 61, from the party's left wing, insisted on remaining
party secretary when he became premier last April, saying it
provided the government with stability. But many people that too
much power was concentrated in De Mita's hands.
   Forlani, 64, who was premier in 1980-81, went into the congress
with the support of the party's center faction, believed to control
about one-third of the 1,312 delegates. He also had the backing of
the about 20 percent of the delegates loyal to Foreign Minister
Giulio Andreotti.
   After Forlani's speech, leaders of the party's left wing said
they would not block his candidacy. De Mita was expected to be named
party president, a largely ceremonial post.
   The Christian Democrats have been increasing their vote total in
recent years after nearly being overtaken by the Communist Party in
the early 1980s.
   One De Mita adviser, former Sen. Francesco d'Onofrio, admitted
that Forlani's nomination marked a defeat for the premier. But he
noted ``the positive result of having obliged the new majority to
approve De Mita's political line with a formal motion.''

   Seven barges carrying gasoline broke free from
a towboat Sunday on the Ohio River and spilled an estimated 40,000
gallons of fuel into the river after striking a railroad bridge
piling, officials said.
   Recovery of the gasoline was impossible because it had diluted,
said Rich Carter, assistant chief of the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency's Office of Emergency Response.
   ``No impact has been observed thus far,'' he said.
   All other downstream communities close enough to be affected draw
their water from wells or underground aquifers, Carter said. The
river's speedy flow makes the spill unlikely to have much effect on
water supplies or aquatic life, he said.
   The rain-swollen Ohio River crested Saturday at 52.2 feet, inches
above flood stage, and was falling Sunday. The spill posed the most
immediate threat to the Louisville, Ky., water system about 100
miles downstream.
   Gasoline tends to float on the water's surface, and authorities
said water systems served by the river could close their intakes
until the gasoline floats past. The spill occurred downstream from
the intakes of Cincinnati's water system, officials said.
   The barges, containing leaded and unleaded gasoline, were being
pushed down river by the towboat MV Super America from an Ashland
Oil Inc. refinery at Ashland, Ky., to an Ashland products terminal
on the river in Cincinnati.
   Ashland spokesman Roger Schrum and the Coast Guard said two of
the barges were leaking.
   Officials at the scene said several other towboats helped
recapture the loose barges. Carter said the leaking barges were
being drained of their remaining gasoline Sunday night at the
Ashland facility and at a Standard Oil Co. facility in nearby
Bromley, Ky., across the Ohio from Cincinnati. Recovery of the
gasoline was impossible because it had been diluted, Carter said.
   The incident occurred about 9:45 a.m. and river traffic was
flowing normally by afternoon, said Coast Guard Lt. Chuck Polk said.
   The railway bridge, owned by Norfolk &amp; Southern Railroad, was
inspected and was apparently not damaged, said Herb Nugent, terminal
trainmaster for Norfolk &amp; Southern. The bridge is at Ludlow, Ky.,
within view of downtown Cincinnati.
   An Ashland Oil storage tank near Pittsburgh, ruptured Jan. 2,
1988, and spilled about 1 million gallons of fuel that caused
water-supply problems along the Ohio River.

   The Canadian Senate likely will conduct its own
investigation of the 1985 crash in Gander, Newfoundland, of a plane
carrying U.S. servicemen, a newspaper reported.
   The report follows calls to reopen a probe that ended in December
with Canadian investigators divided over what caused the crash that
killed 248 soldiers and a crew of eight.
   Herb Gray, deputy leader of the opposition Liberal Party in the
House of Commons, said Wednesday his party wants the Senate to
conduct an inquiry into the crash, Canada's worst aviation disaster.
   ``There are so many lingering doubts and questions that something
more has to be done,'' the Ottawa Citizen quoted Gray as saying late
last week.
   The Arrow Air charter DC-8, carrying soldiers of the 101st
Airborne Division back to Fort Campbell, Ky., from peacekeeping
duties in the Middle East, crashed shortly after takeoff from Gander
airport on Dec. 12, 1985.
   The Canadian Aviation Safety Board concluded Dec. 8 that ice on
the wings was the likely cause, but a minority said in a separate
opinion that an in-flight fire caused the crash.
   Aviation Week and Space Technology, has recently called on the
Canadian government to reopen the inquiry because of unanswered
questions.

officials said Sunday.
   Bret Vorhees, a spokesman for the Des Moines, Iowa-based Lotto

   Lotto America officials said if the winning ticket is validated,
it will be the first time anyone outside Iowa or Kansas has won the
multi-state lottery game, which began about a year ago.
   The previous record jackpot of $13.6 million was claimed by a
Norwalk, Iowa, couple in December. The other states participating in
the lottery are Missouri, Oregon, West Virginia and Rhode Island.
   After taxes are withheld, the winner will receive about $600,000

   The suspension ``is aimed at facilitating announcement of
modifications that will be made in the exchange market,'' the
Central Bank communique said.
   The modifications ``will be announced tomorrow (Monday),'' the
bank said. ``Their objective is to increase activity on the free
market and provide increased incentive to exports, at the same time
minimizing the impact of inflation.''
   The communique did not elaborate.
   The bank said there will be no changes in exchange rates
involving imports or for any commercial and special exchange rates.
   The Central Bank communique followed a series of closed-door
meetings by President Raul Alfonsin's economic team, headed by
Economy Minister Juan V. Sourrouille.
   In recent months the Central Bank spent more than $1.3 billion
trying to hold down the dollar as a way to control inflation. Bank
officials disclosed on Feb. 5 that they would discontinue that
policy and ordered private banks and exchange houses closed Feb. 6.
   A three-tier system of exchange rates, including ``official,
special and free'' rates, was announced Feb. 7.
   On Feb. 7, the dollar sold for 27 australs on the free market. At
the close of business the previous Friday, it sold for 17.70
australs. The fluctuations continued last week. At the close of
business on Friday, the dollar sold for 26.50.
   The problem, as usual, was inflation, which was an unexpectedly
high 8.9 percent in January, a rise from December's 6.8 percent and
November's 5.7 percent.
   In August, Alfonsin implemented a program of voluntary wage and
price controls, budget cuts and small regular devaluations in the
austral.
   To convince Argentines not to put their money in dollars, which
deprives the banking system of funds and drives up interest rates,
the Central Bank made plenty of dollars available. Interest rates
were kept attractively high, though well below levels of July and
August.
   Through November the plan seemed to work. Inflation and monthly
interest rates both returned to single digits, the dollar rose
modestly and, of crucial importance, Argentines' purchasing power
recovered from the months when it lagged behind inflation.
   Critics pointed out, however, that any improvement was illusory
because it was obvious the dollar was undervalued, and as soon as
that was common knowledge, speculators would buy dollars in
anticipation of profits.
   The bubble burst in the first week of February, when Argentines
bought $486 milliod to near 20 percent a month.

   The final performance of the $5.3 million
Broadway bomb ``Legs Diamond'' was held Sunday, less than two months
after the musical about a big-time New York mobster opened.
   The show drew two standing ovations, one at the end and one at
the start of the second act when ``Legs'' creator-star Peter Allen
rose from a coffin and declared, ``Not even critics can kill me.''
   The production was held at the historic Mark Hellinger Theater,
which will be used as a church for the next five years, according to
the Nederlander theater organization. It rented the theater to the
Times Square Church for five years at $1 million a year.
   There were 64 regular performances and 72 previews of ``Legs
Diamond,'' which opened at the end of December to dismal reviews.
   ``It's an awful letdown. It's like your family is dissolving,''
said actress Julie Wilson.
   The play was based on a story by Harvey Fierstein and Charles
Suppon, and music and lyrics by Allen. Robert Allan Ackerman was the
director.

<HEAD>Report Ex-Priest Sought By Britain Has Left Ireland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patrick Ryan, a former Roman Catholic
priest wanted in Britain on bombing charges, has left the Irish
Republic and is either in France or the United States, The Sunday
Press reported.
   The Dublin weekly said Ryan quietly left the country while legal
authorities were considering whether he should face charges in an
Irish court.
   It said Ryan had left the republic and returned once before since
Belgian authorities in November refused a British request for his
extradition and flew him home on a military aircraft, accompanied by
a prison doctor. The Irish government also refused to extradite him,
saying he would not receive a fair trial in Britain.
   The affair led to an angry exchange between British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher and Belgian Prime Minister Dr. Wilfried
Martens at a European Economic Community summit in December. Irish
Prime Minister Charles Haughey publicly snubbed Mrs. Thatcher there.
   Ryan's attorney, Elio Malocco, would not confirm or deny the
newspaper report but The Sunday Press quoted him as saying he had
not seen his client since Christmas.
   Britain said in its extradition warrant that Ryan conspired to
commit murder and cause explosions in Britain between 1975 and 1988.
He was arrested in a Brussels apartment in June and went on a 22-day
hunger strike to avoid being sent to Britain.
   Although he rejected the British extradition request, Ireland's
Attorney General John Murray asked British authorities for evidence
which might sustain a prosecution in the republic under the criminal
law jurisdiction act. The act allows trial in the republic for
offenses allegedly committed in Britain.

<TEXT>
   A controversial special relief program for
Nicaraguan immigrants is being dismantled and city officials say
it's time for the newcomers to fend for themselves.
   ``You have to kick them out of the nest,'' said Martha Torres, a
volunteer dispatching some of the last Nicaraguans under city care
to new homes.
   The city had assembled two shelters to handle the more than 300
aliens who were living in the Bobby Maduro Miami Stadium. They were
lated placed in more than 80 apartments across Dade County.
   By Thursday, city workers sent off the last people from the
shelters and did not plan to reopen them again.
   Most of the immigrants placed by the city won't have to pay their
own rent until mid-March, and city officials said they won't be
offered further help.
   The assistance drew criticism from black leaders in the wake of
last month's disturbances in Miami's black neighborhoods. They
claimed Hispanic immigrants were granted special privileges from the
city, while blacks were relatively ignored and have always been left
to fend for themselves.
   Critics of the city's recent decisions say the Nicaraguans are
unlikely to be able to become self-sufficient because most won't
have work permits while immigration officials decide whether they
will be permitted to stay.
   ``These people have really been thrown to the lions,'' said
Vivian Correa, a volunteer at St. Louis Catholic Church, which is
continuing to provide food for some families.
   ``They have no papers, no money,'' Correa said. ``They have no
way of getting a job.''
   While the immigrant migration continues to Dade County, it has
diminished in recent weeks. Most new arrivals are being absorbed by
family and friends, officials said.

   A police officer dove into a freezing lake
early Sunday to rescue a man whose truck had crashed through the ice
and then charged him with drunken driving, officials said.
   Patrolman Jeffrey Stiegler was answering an accident call shortly
after midnight when he found David Poire, 22, floundering in about
20 feet of water in Lake Winnipesaukee, screaming for help, said Lt.
John MacLennan.
   Stiegler radioed for help, then took off his gunbelt and radio
and headed out onto the ice of the lake, located in east-central New
Hampshire. Stiegler had to jump into the water to reach Poire.
   Both men were pulled to shore by a second officer, MacLennan said.
   After he was rescued, Poire was charged with drunken driving and
held at a hospital overnight. Stiegler, whose temperature had dipped
to 95 degrees, was treated for hypothermia and released, hospital
officials said.

   Bozo the Clown isn't laughing about a
restaurant's attempt to obtain a trademark on his name, which he
says ``will carry on long after I go to that circus in the sky.''
   ``Who are these people in Mason, Tennessee, to tell me how famous
they are?'' asked Larry Harmon, who created Bozo the Clown.
   He was angry about a decision that gives a rural western
Tennessee restaurant the right to use his name on franchises from
coast to coast.
   Bozo's restaurant, which serves pork barbecue, is based in the
town of Mason, population 471.
   Restaurant owner Jeff Thompson of Memphis has no plans to branch
out or franchise, but decided to protect the right to use the name
by filing for a national trademark in 1982, said assistant manager
Dot Cottam.
   ``There are no plans at the present, but in the future, who
knows?'' Cottam said.
   The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office decided the restaurant, a
local fixture since 1923, attracts enough out-of-state customers to
trademark its name nationally.
   ``The whole world has recognized the greatness and love of
Bozo,'' Harmon said Thursday from his New York City office. ``Don't
I have the right to protect what's mine?''
   ``Bozo has been my life,'' he said. ``It is my life. It will
carry on long after I go to that circus in the sky.''
   His lawyers have appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington.

<HEAD>Trade Officials Agree to `Cooling-off' Period in Beef Battle</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with Andriessen Sunday comments.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and European negotiators agreed over the
weekend to a 75-day cooling off period in their increasingly
abrasive trade war involving American beef containing growth
hormones as they intensified their search for a compromise to
resolve the dispute.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills, holding her first
discussions as the Bush administration's top trade negotiator, said
Saturday substantial progress had been made in the two days of talks
with representatives of the 12-nation European Community.
   Frans Andriessen, the EC's top trade negotiator, said Sunday the
agreement could help the two sides resolve the meat dispute.
   ``I don't say we are close to a solution, but I think we are now
in a situation which makes it easier to come to a solution,''
Andriessen said upon returning to Brussels from Washington.
   The two sides agreed to establish a high-level task force to
study the issue over the next 75 days with the goal of coming up
with ways to export hormone-free American beef to Europe.
   The task force will also consider an American demand that a panel
of experts should be established to consider whether growth hormones
constitute a health risk.
   ``We made good progress in working out a procedure with respect
to our differences in the hormone area,'' Mrs. Hills told reporters
after the meeting ended. ``We have a high-level task force to deal
with that issue, to work out the differences if at all possible.''
   Andriessen said talks with officials of the new Bush
administration gave him the impression ``we have a very positive
environment for cooperation.''
   He said U.S. officials still contested the prohibition against
hormone-treated beef, but ``they have accepted now that to ship the
meat (they) have to comply with our requirements.''
   Both President Bush and European officials have expressed a
desire to defuse the trade dispute, fearing that the battle could
aggravate tensions just at a time when the new administration is
trying to forge closer ties with its European allies.
   The current trade dispute began on Jan. 1 when the Europeans
imposed a ban on shipments of U.S. beef because the meat contained
growth hormones used to fatten American cattle.
   The Reagan administration charged that the European action, which
affected about $100 million in annual meat shipments, represented an
unfair trade barrier and that there was no scientific evidence that
the hormones were a health threat.
   In retaliation, the Americans slapped 100 percent tariffs on $100
million worth of European products, ranging from canned tomatoes to
fruit wines and instant coffee. Those tariffs are just now showing
up in higher prices at U.S. grocery stores.
   The weekend negotiations were held in an effort to avoid a
counter-retaliatory step threatened by the Europeans on Monday, when
the governing body of the European Community will meet to consider
imposing 100 percent tariffs on $100 million of American exports of
walnuts and dried fruit.
   Andriessen said Saturday he could not speak for the European
Council of Ministers but he indicated that the progress made in the
talks would likely postpone the second round of retaliation.
   Andriessen told reporters at a later briefing Saturday the United
States had indicated it would lower its $100 million in tariffs by
an amount equal to the shipments of hormone-free beef that the
United States is able to make.
   He said consideration would be given to doubling the quota for
high-grade beef. Last year, the United States shipped $32 million
worth of such beef to Europe. Such a step would make it more
profitable for U.S. ranchers to raise hormone-free beef.
   Mrs. Hills and Andriessen also reported progress between the two
sides over the U.S. demand to end all trade-distorting farm
subsidies, a position the Europeans have strongly objected to.
   A U.S. official, briefing reporters on the condition that the
official's name not be used, said that the United States offered a
new proposal on the contentious farm subsidy issue and the matter
was to be discussed by Mrs. Hills, Andriessen, Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter and Ray MacSharry, the European Community's
commissioner in charge of agriculture, during talks on March 10 and
11 in Brussels.
   The current round of talks being held to liberalize world trade,
known as the Uruguay Round, have been stalled because of American
and European differences over farm subsidies.
   European officials characterized the get-acquainted talks, which
also included Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, as helpful in
understanding the position of the new administration.
   Trade between the United States and the European Community
totaled $165 billion last year, making the 12-nation community
America's largest trading partner.
   Bush, referring to the beef dispute in his first address to
Congress, said last week that the major industrial countries needed
``to rise above fighting about beef hormones to building a better
future, to move from protectionism to progress.''
   A basis for compromise on the beef question was put forward by
Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower.
   The Texas plan would involve isolating untreated cattle from
birth through slaughter, giving them tests for artificial hormones
and establishing enforcement procedures. Texas officials say that
similar programs meeting European standards have been proposed by
Brazil and New Zealand.
   American officials have been anxious to get the dispute resolved
because the battle had raised questions about American beef.
   ``The health ban is a signal that something is wrong with our
beef,'' Mrs. Hills said last week. ``Nothing is wrong with our
beef.''
   Nearly half of American cattle are now treated with growth
hormones. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has maintained
throughout the dispute that the daily production of hormones in
humans, even in children, is far higher than the miniscule levels
left in meat from treated animals.

<HEAD>Traders' Attorneys Ask Judge to Throw Out Some Wiretap Evidence,
Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge is being asked to declare illegal
many of the secret tape recordings made by undercover FBI agents
during a two-year probe of suspected fraud at the world's two
largest futures exchanges, according to reports published Saturday.
   The Chicago Sun-Times and the Chicago Tribune reported that
lawyers representing commodity traders are contending their clients
should not be forced to hand over documents or appear before a
federal grand jury because evidence against the traders came from
improper recordings.
   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas and the FBI's Chicago office have
declined to confirm that an investigation is ongoing into allegedly
fraudulent trading practices at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and
the Chicago Board of Trade.
   But traders who have been subpoenaed and their attorneys have
disclosed some aspects of the investigation.
   Several defense attorneys said in letters to government
prosecutors and in closed-door arguments before Chief U.S. District
Judge John Grady that many of the tape recordings made by FBI agents
amount to unauthorized wiretaps, the newspapers reported.
   While at least two lawyers identified by the Sun-Times declined
to confirm the filings, that newspaper and the Tribune quoted
unidentified sources as saying the motions were made in the last two
weeks.
   The lawyers argue that FBI agents who posed as traders could only
legally tape conversations in which they participated, and
conversations in which the agents participated have not been
challenged, the newspapers said.
   Federal law requires investigators to obtain court orders before
taping conversations of people who have no reason to believe their
discussion might be recorded. Otherwise, taping such conversations
amounts to eavesdropping, and violates federal law, defense
attorneys have argued.
   Shouldts of the investigation because of illegal wiretaps
could refuse to cooperate with investigators, and use that fact in
their defense in any subsequent court proceedings.

   The U.S. dollar eased against the Japanese yen while
stock prices moved to a record high at the start of the trading week
Monday.
   The dollar opened at 125.30 yen, down 0.42 yen from last Friday's
close of 125.72 yen. It finished at 125.88 yen in Friday's New York
trading.
   A dealer with the Bank of Tokyo said the market remained
relatively quiet because most banks and financial markets in the
United States would be closed Monday for the President's Day holiday.
   The dealer, who spoke anonymously, said the Tokyo market showed
little reaction to a U.S. trade report issued last week which
revealed that the American trade deficit narrowed to $11.89 billion
in December from a revised $12.22 billion the previous month.
   The report was largely within expectations, the dealer said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which rose 89.91 points for a record
32,173.39-point closing Friday, added another 119.16 points, or 0.37
percent, shortly after the market opened to move to 32,292.55.
   The previous high closing was set last Wednesday when the index
finished at 32,149.48 points.

<HEAD>Strong Possibility of Strike at Eastern, Pilots Union Official Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: for Monday PMs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's an ``eight-out-of-ten'' possibility of a
work stoppage against Eastern Airlines as a March 3 strike deadline
set by the militant machinists union approaches, an official of the
Eastern pilots union says.
   Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Crp., is
``looking at the abyss. The evil empire is tottering,'' Wright B.
George, a member of the Eastern master executive council of the Air
Line Pilots Association, said in an interview Sunday.
   Sixteen months of talks on wages between Miami-based Eastern and
the International Association of Machinists have resulted in no
settlement, and the union will be free to strike legally March 4 if
a 30-day cooling-off period mandated by the National Mediation Board
expires without a new contract.
   The cooling-off period expires at midnight EST March 3.
Intensified talks involving Eastern management, the Machinists and
federal mediators are due to start on Wednesday in Washington.
   The two unions representing pilots and flight attendants at
Eastern have said they would honor any picket line set up by the
machinists, who represent about 8,500 mechanics, baggage handlers
and other ground personnel.
   ``We understand the risk (of striking),'' George said. ``The
worst thing that can happen to us is that we lose our jobs.''
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell in Miami said the airline is
``guardedly optimistic'' that the dispute will be settled without a
strike.
   ``We don't want a strike. A strike is not in the company's or the
unions' best interest,'' he said. Matell reiterated Eastern's vow to
continue operating in the event of a strike.
   Many financial analysts and other observers believe a bruising
strike against Eastern could jeopardize the airline's survival.
   Eastern recently reported a record net loss of $335.4 million in
1988, nearly double its $181.7 million loss the year before. Revenue
dropped to $3.8 billion from $4.4 billion in 1987.
   The airline's latest contract offer to the machinists calls for
$150 million in wage cuts.
   George conceded that Lorenzo could well put Eastern into Chapter
11 bankruptcy, liquidate its assets or sell it outright.
   He said pilots union officials have set up a meeting with Wall
Street analysts and Eastern creditors later this week in New York to
discuss the risk to creditors if there is a strike. The pilots held
a similar session with analysts alone last September.
   Eastern currently has $550 million to $650 million in cash
reserves, roughly equivalent to its accounts payable, George said.
   Matell put the reserve figure at around $400 million.
   ``Eastern has substantial cash reserves,'' the spokesman said.
``We keep our creditors well informed, and they know that they have
no cause for concern.''
   George insisted a strike will occur ``if rational heads don't
prevail.'' The 3,400 Eastern pilots, he said, have been seeking
talks with management for months with job security their primary
issue.
   Tom Matthews, Eastern's senior vice president for human resources
and chief labor negotiator, has told the pilots the company plans to
contact their union on Tuesday to discuss a schedule for
negotiations.
   However, Matell said, talks with the pilots have been made more
difficult by Wednesday's scheduled start of ``super-mediation'' with
the Machinists, which will tie up Eastern's top negotiators. He said
the situation also has been complicated by the pilots union having
