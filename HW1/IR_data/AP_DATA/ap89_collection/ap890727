<TEXT>
   A Korean DC-10 crashed short of the
fogbound Tripoli airport Thursday, and flaming wreckage cartwheeled
through an olive grove. Officials said at least 75 people were
killed, including four on the ground.
   ``There is no exact number of dead ... because the bodies became
charcoal,'' the first secretary of the South Korean Embassy in the
Libyan capital, who identified himself only as Mr. Chun, said by
telephone about 10{ hours after the morning crash.
   The pilot, one of the 121 people who survived, told officials he
may have been wrong to attempt a landing in the fog, according to
the head of the Libyan committee investigating the accident.
   It was the second crash of a DC-10 in eight days. One operated
by United Air Lines went down July 19 in Sioux City, Iowa, killing
111 people.
   The Korean Air DC-10, with 199 people aboard, hit cars and two
houses and split into three pieces before coming to rest about a
half-mile from the airport, the official Libyan news agency JANA
reported. It said more than 110 people were hospitalized.
   Television reports from the site, 35 miles south of Tripoli,
showed rescue workers carrying bodies covered with white sheets and
firemen hosing down the smoldering wreckage.
   Reporters flying into Tripoli saw the huge tail section in the
widely scattered debris.
   Korean officials said most passengers on Flight 803, which
originated in Seoul, were South Koreans returning from vacation to
their jobs on engineering and construction projects in Libya.
   Chun said he had just returned from the crash site and ``there
are about 78 dead'' from the plane.
   But an airline official in Seoul, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said early Friday that 128 of the people aboard the jet
were known survivors and that 71 were unaccounted for and presumed
dead or missing.
   Chun said Libyan officials reported four more people were killed
when the DC-10's landing gear struck two houses near the airport,
which is surrounded by orange and olive groves, farmhouses and
grazing sheep.
   Chun said the plane's 18 crew members survived and that four
were slightly injured.
   He said the crash ``happened at 7:05 a.m. (1:05 a.m. EDT). There
was very heavy fog and many clouds. We don't know if the pilot made
an error or if the tower made an error. There was no mechanical
problem, no bomb explosion. The captain is conscious. He thinks he
did not do anything wrong.''
   Some passengers quoted the pilot as saying they would land in a
few minutes, Chun said, then ``they looked out the window and
suddenly they see olive trees and hear'' the landing gear ``hitting
the roofs of two houses, and 10 seconds later it crashed and they
split into three parts.''
   Chun said all the passengers in the first-class section survived.
   He said all those aboard were South Korean except for three
Japanese and seven Arabs.
   Survivor Kwon Hyuk-hwi told the Munhwa Broadcasting Corp. he was
reading a book in the first-class section when an announcement was
made that the plane was about to land.
   ``Instantly there was a crushing impact and then came shrieks by
horrified people. I kept my body as low as possible and lost
consciousness,'' he said.
   The plane cartwheeled for about 400 yards before breaking into
pieces, another South Korean diplomat in Tripoli, Chang Kyung-soo,
told Korean TV.
   Wreckage was strewn 500 to 700 yards along the ground and
authorities closed off the area.
   The airline earlier quoted the plane's pilot, Kim Ho-jung, 54,
as saying, ``The airport was shrouded in a dense fog and visibility
was poor when I approached. I lost contact with the control tower
for 15 minutes before the crash.''
   Mustapha Maghrebi, head of the investigating committee, said it
was not known whether pilot error or mechanical failure caused the
crash.
   He said the pilot told authorities he probably was wrong to try
to land with poor visibility.
   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, quoted an unidentified
Korean Air spokesman as saying ``the plane was ordered to make a
270-degree turn by the control tower and crashed at the moment of
turning when it hit an unidentified object.''
   Yonhap said one airline official said the crew told authorities
the landing guidance system may have been out of order. It said
Korean Air had ruled out pilot error.
   JANA in Rome said the airport control tower had told the pilot
that there was heavy fog and only 800-foot visibility. It said a
Soviet Aeroflot jetliner, informed of similar conditions about an
hour earlier, went instead to Malta.
   Flight 803 had made stops in Bangkok, Thailand, and Jiddah,
Saudi Arabia, en route to Tripoli, the airline said.
   The airline official in Seoul said 40 of those injured suffered
minor burns and were expected to be released from Tripoli hospitals
Friday.
   He said a Boeing 747SP carrying a 14-member medical team and
Korean Air chairman Cho Choong-hoon departed Seoul Friday for
Tripoli and would return with survivors.
   On July 19, a United DC-10 crashed in Sioux City after the tail
engine blew apart and disabled the jet's hydraulic system needed to
steer the plane.
   In Long Beach, Calif., McDonnell Douglas said it was unable to
provide information about the plane that crashed in Libya because
it did not have the aircraft's registration number.
   Company spokesman Don Hanson said McDonnell Douglas was seeking
U.S. government approval to travel to Libya since the United States
does not have diplomatic ties with the nation.
   Korean Air said the DC-10 was purchased in January 1977. The
plane was built in 1973 and had logged 49,025 flying hours. Airline
officials said the plane received routine safety checks and had no
problems.
   Korean Air is a privately owned national flag carrier and the
largest of two Korean airlines. It was formerly known as Korean Air
Lines.

   Felix Bloch, the U.S. diplomat suspected of spying for the
Soviet Union, told FBI agents he had been paid ``a lot of money''
by the Soviet intelligence service during a relationship of ``many
years,'' The New York Times said in Friday editions.
   This new development in the Bloch case came after officials
disclosed in Washington that Bloch got recent merit raises totaling
more than $13,000 for work ``well above average.''
   Bloch's reported admissions came in his one brief interview with
the FBI on June 22, the newspaper said, citing an ``official
involved in the case'' as its source.
   Informed of this report, three administration sources familiar
with the Bloch case said in Washington Thursday night they had not
been informed of such admissions.
   But The Associated Press learned from a congressional source
that the FBI believes Bloch was recruited by the KGB, the Soviet
intelligence service combining the functions of the FBI and the
CIA, during service at the U.S. Embassy in East Berlin 14 years ago.
   Block reportedly refused to discuss with the FBI any possible
spying activities or his motives.
   The newspaper said the FBI received information that prompted
major interest in a trip the diplomat was making to Europe. The
agency notified foreign intelligence services and congressional
committees, and somehow the information got out, leading to the
previously reported overhearing of a Soviet agent telling Bloch,
``A bad virus is going around and we believe you are now infected.''
   Bloch got a raise of $4,500 for fiscal year 1983-84; $4,000 for
1984-85 and $4,800 for 1985-86, said a U.S. official who spoke only
on condition of anonymity.
   The pay increases were given to Bloch while he served as the
deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna, where he was
posted from 1980 to 1987. Recommendations for the merit awards were
made by, among others, the U.S. ambassador to Austria who has been
publicly critical of Bloch's performance, said the official.
   The ambassador to which the official referred was Helene Von
Damm.
   The State Department calls such raises performance pay awards,
granted only to those whose work is deemed ``well above average,''
said another official, who also insisted on anonymity.
   Government sources have said Bloch was videotaped in Paris
handing a briefcase to a Soviet agent. He has not been charged with
a crime, but his diplomatic passport and State Department
credentials have been revoked.
   Agents are engaged in what is expected to be a lengthy _ and
possibly futile _ search for the specific evidence required to
charge Bloch under the Espionage Act, including what secrets, if
any, were compromised. Government sources have thus far been
unwilling to say when they believe Bloch began spying for the
Soviets.
   In other developments:
   _President Bush added his voice to those advocating improved
U.S. counterintelligence efforts since disclosure that diplomat
Felix S. Bloch is under investigation as a possible Soviet spy.
   _Government sources familiar with the case said that the
54-year-old State Department official could remain free for a long
time while FBI agents try to identify specific secrets, if any,
that he may have turned over to the Soviets.
   _Bloch ended a three-night stay at his father's East Side co-op
in New York City. Trailed by FBI agents and reporters, he drove to
his daughter's house in Chappaqua, N.Y., north of the city.
   The ambassador during most of Bloch's tenure in Vienna was
Helene Von Damm, who was a senior White House secretary to former
President Reagan before being appointed to the Vienna post.
   Von Damm, who left during a social flap involving her marriage
to an Austrian, was replaced by Ronald Lauder, now a Republican
candidate for the mayor's job in New York City.
   Lauder has said he did not like or trust Bloch, and asked for
him to be recalled. But State Department officials have said it was
time for Bloch to come home anyway, after seven years in Vienna.
   Merit raises in the Senior Foreign Service are sometimes given
to diplomats who are eligible for more senior postings but cannot
get them because of a shortage of vacant slots.
   Raises in the Senior Foreign Service can go as high as $9,000 a
year, one official said.
   Bloch was put on paid leave by the State Department June 22 and
is under no travel restrictions. He makes about $80,000 a year,
according to officials speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Bush, at a photo session in the Oval Office, told reporters,
``The question is: Can we improve our counterintelligence? We
always ought to be striving to do that. Can embassy security be
improved? We go through this periodically and the answer is, I'm
sure it can.''
   In Vienna, Friday's editions of the Neue Kronen Zeitung said an
FBI team had arrived to assist in the investigation there. FBI
spokesmen in Washington would not confirm that, but Viennese
officials had said earlier in the week they were searching for a
prostitute who they said had a relationship with Bloch while he was
the No. 2 officer in the U.S. Embassy there.
   In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said
the Soviet Union has no connection with Bloch. Gerasimov said he
made inquiries about Bloch's activities. ``The name of Bloch was
not familiar. We have no connection with him. We have nothing to do
with him.'' he told a regular news briefing. ``It is lamentable
that the U.S. press fans such hysteria.''
   U.S. government sources have said Soviet officials in the United
States, who must use autos with license plates coded by country,
took the unusual step of watching Bloch's apartment and following
him and the FBI in an auto caravan from Washington to New York on
Saturday.
   Retired deputy FBI counterintelligence chief James Nolan said,
``I've never heard of that before in 20 years. Normally they stay
as far away from these cases as possible.''
   The American Civil Liberties Union on Thursday ``condemned
government officials who have made statements, publicly and off the
record, suggesting that Felix S. Bloch is guilty of a crime even
though he has not been indicted.'' U.S. law entitles Bloch to a
presumption of innocence, the group said.

<HEAD>Exiles: China Massacre a Setback For Tibetan Independence</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DHARMSALA, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's supression of the pro-democracy
uprising has diminished chances of a Tibetan independence, Tibetan
exiles say, and some believe it may be time to bring new militancy
to the movement.
   ``What happened in China will not help the Tibetan struggle in
any way.'' said Lhasang Tsering, the chief of the Tibetan Youth
Congress, one of the most radical exile groups. ``Now freedom will
not come but it must be earned.''
   The youth congress is based in Dharmsala, an exile colony of
Tibetan refugees in the foothills of the Himalayas in northern
India.
   The first of Dharmsala's 7,000 inhabitants fled their homeland,
along with their spiritual and temporal leader, the Dalai Lama, to
escape the Chinese occupation army in 1959.
   ``For 30 years we have been speaking of Chinese atrocities. If
China is capable of killing their own people, surely they will not
hesitate to show any mercy on the Tibetans,'' said Sonam Topgyal of
the Tibetan Information Office of the government-in-exile in
Dharmsala.
   Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of unarmed civilians were killed
June 3-4 when troops used guns and tanks to clear central Beijing
of pro-democracy protesters.
   ``We lost an opportunity (to win independence),'' said Rinzen
Dolkar, a middle-aged housewife who runs a small cafe, referring to
the crackdown.
   In the past, the Chinese military and police have often crushed
pro-independence demonstrations in Tibet and exiles say 800 people
died during the latest Chinese crackdown in the capital of Lhasa on
March 5.
   Chinese authorities put the toll at 16.
   The independence movement, however, has been largely peaceful
because the revered Dalai Lama advocates non-violence and
negotiations to free his homeland, a remote mountainous region on
China's southern border.
   The 6 million Tibetans worldwide consider the Dalai Lama to be
the living Buddha, the founder of the religion.
   China claims Tibet has been an integral part of Chinese
territory for seven centuries. But Tibetans maintain it was an
independent nation before the communists moved into Tibet in 1950.
   ``China will not loosen its grip over Tibet because of its
military importance. Also, China desperately needs land for its
bursting population,'' said Jampa Dharton, the top religious
adviser to the government-in-exile.
   China has not responded to the Dalai Lama's long-standing offers
that included his biggest compromise _ allowing China to handle
Tibet's foreign and defense affairs in return for independence.
   But a senior official of the Tibetan government-in-exile,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said: ``I have my doubts about
non-violent methods with the Chinese.''
   Dawa Norbu, an international relations expert at New Delhi's
Jawaharlal Nehru University, said the Dalai Lama should now ask
Tibetans in Lhasa to stage more protests so the Chinese will have
``no option but to hold talks.''
   The most vocal opponent of the Dalai Lama's stand is the Tibetan
Youth Congress led by the 35-year-old Tsering, a former guerrilla
who claims to have 10,000 followers, mostly in India.
   Tsering says the Chinese authorities are insincere and cannot be
trusted to negotiate for an independence. ``Tibetans must put an
end to these misplaced hopes and faith,'' he said in a recent
interview.
   ``All my life I have been trying to learn and speak English, but
I have been learning the wrong language. There's only one language
the world understands and listens to and that language is violence.
We have to learn to speak that language.''

   American author Charles Bukowski has
demanded that the former Bukowski Cafe compensate him for the
unauthorized commercial use of his name and photograph, the
writer's Dutch attorney said today.
   The author of ``Barfly'' and ``Tales of Ordinary Madness''
brought a $2,200 lawsuit against the owners of a bar named for
Bukowski in downtown Haarlem, 13 miles west of Amsterdam.
   Bukowski, in whose books alcohol is a key theme, was initially
``charmed'' by the bar named in his honor, attorney Paul van de
Kroft testified in court.
   But bar owners Peter Massa and Wilhelmus Koops later made
unauthorized commercial use of a photograph of Bukowski, selling
copies and using it to decorate two glass-paneled doors in the bar,
Kroft said.
   Amsterdam photographer Joan Levine, who took the photograph, is
seeking a $6,800 compensation for alleged copyright violation in
the suit.
   The bar has been renamed ``The Hangover,'' defense attorney
Ronald Metselaar said.

   A Canadian patrol boat chased a New Bedford
fishing boat into American waters Wednesday after allegedly
spotting the scalloper filling its nets in Canadian waters, the
U.S. Coast Guard said.
   Canadian officials allege that as the U.S. boat, the Bountiful,
entered U.S. waters just before 4 p.m., it turned and rammed the
patrol boat Cygnus, Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Jack Mason said.
   No one was injured and neither boat was seriously damaged, he
said.
   The Bountiful was allegedly seven nautical miles into Canadian
fishing waters and 165 miles east of Nantucket when it was spotted
by the Cygnus at 2:30 p.m., Coast Guard spokesmen said.
   The Cygnus asked Canadian authorities for permission to fire
warning shots across the Bountiful's bow to force the American
skipper to halt, but as of 10:30 p.m. permission to fire was being
withheld, Mason said.
   The Coast Guard has radioed the Bountiful to recommend that it
stop for its own safety, but it planned not to interfere unless the
Canadian government specifically requested help, he said.
   ``We have one of our vessels over the horizon, just out of
sight, trailing along,'' Mason said.
   Mason estimated that the Bountiful is about the 10th American
fishing boat to be accused of poaching in Canadian waters this year.
   Such incidents are on the rise because fishing stocks on the
U.S. side of the fisheries line are being depleted and the
Canadians are aggressively patrolling their waters, he said.
   At 10:30 p.m., the Bountiful and the Cygnus were about 120 miles
east of Cape Cod, heading toward shore, Mason said.

<HEAD>Saint Laurent Turns Out Sexy Classics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yves Saint Laurent has proved once again, in his
show for next winter, that classic haute couture can have sex
appeal.
   Rich, dressy and sexy outfits are about the only common
denominator in the current crop of couture clothes, including
Wednesday's show by Madame Gres, the high priestess of draped Greek
dresses.
   The news from Saint Laurent is that he has burnished his
classics to a high sheen of chic, especially with his use of lame
brocades in short and long cocktail dresses, the huge stiffened
flounces enveloping the sheaths.
   They came in showy colors from rust and amethyst to chartreuse,
midnight blue, fuchsia and flame, with highlights of silver and
gold.
   Saint Laurent's clothes fuel all the other YSL activities from
accessories to perfume. Investors are glad to know that his company
is still a hot ticket.
   When the Saint Laurent company floated 10 percent of its stock
on the market earlier this month, the issue was 200 times
oversubscribed and had to be re-done under stricter conditions, for
cash only.
   Saint Laurent's daytime clothes were perfect in their purity of
color, cut and fabric. He led the show with a siren red jersey
shift and flowing black cape, topped by a big cerise scarf, and the
excitement didn't let up.
   His new suit style pairs green, tan or slate blue full skirts
with boleros or long jackets with big buttons up the sleeves _ and
airy-light iridescent blouses in slightly different shades.
   There were some trouser suits, but they did not dominate. Knees
were often bared, but a longer, fuller skirt length to nearly
mid-calf also got the YSL seal of approval. Whether skirts were
short or long, they were often topped by fitted jackets, loden
styles or full, soft suede blousons, plus a high toque or funnel
hat, either bowed or tied in a turban effect.
   Boots were important. They came out in shiny lame cloque brocade
_ like many of the jackets and skin-tight cocktail dresses.
   ``I loved it,'' said Saint Laurent admirer Paloma Picasso after
the show. ``He always finds something new to say, with that big
ruffle in the lame brocade dresses and the colors.''
   He showed the tiniest heart-shaped bustiers in an empire line to
show off the bosom, sometimes pairing this brief note in velvet
with tulip-draped satin or silk crepe skirts hitched up with a
floppy bow to show off the legs.
   The teal blue chiffon cape over a spotted panther panne velours
dinner dress with touches of lame earned a hail of wolf-whistles.
And draped chiffons came out in all colors from flame and fuchsia
to mandarin orange, purple and black.
   From a tea rose pink satin gown to a richly multicolored chiffon
dress in renaissance style for the bride, Saint Laurent's evening
collection all had the master's touch of elegance.
   Dressy clothes with an eye to sex appeal also dominated at the
younger house of Lecoanet Hemant. Didier Lecoanet is the creative
French designer, and his Indian-German partner Hemant Sagar runs
the business side of things. Both are in their 30s.
   They used hot colors in very fitted suits and dresses, often in
gunmetal cloque or waffled lame brocades and silks, as well as
combinations like flowered royal blue satin and a chartreuse
egg-shaped mini-skirt for a showy late-day look.
   There were some beautifully draped georgette crepes, touches of
sparkle and heavy guipure lace, plus feathers and furs, big ruffles
down the back, and other details such as fur-cuffed gloves.
   With so many colors and details, the collection tended to lack
focus, but the couture touches were there in these festive clothes
that came out either very short for a leggy look or elegantly long
for evening.
   Madame Gres' show was a poignant moment of nostalgia. Now 86,
the grand old lady of couture showed some striking clothes, though
her capable young assistants did most of the execution.
   She was not backstage, and nobody took a bow after the show.

<HEAD>Pettersson Admitted Crimes, But Not Palme Murder</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Palme, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carl Gustav Christer Pettersson
admitted he was a bum, even a killer _ but not the killer who shot
Prime Minister Olof Palme.
   A veteran of one of the world's most lenient penal systems,
where early releases are routine, Pettersson's criminal record
lists more than 60 crimes, most of them petty theft and assault,
one for manslaughter.
   ``I am a killer but not a murderer,'' he said as his five-week
trial opened June 5. He maintained he was innocent of shooting
Palme on Feb. 28, 1986.
   ``I was a bum,'' he told the court. ``It's actually surprising
that anyone at all has anything positive to say about me.''
   The 42-year-old unemployed Swede was arrested in December and
later charged with the murder.
   The trial revealed a life of drug use, alcohol abuse and petty
crime. It exposed the complex character of a Bible-reading loner
who liked children, wrote poetry and scared friends with his
erratic, violent behavior.
   Pettersson was born into a middle-class family on April 23,
1947. A promising child, he read Homer at the age of 10 and had no
evident problems in school until suffering a concussion as a
teenager.
   At 19, he started taking drugs. His life took a criminal turn
and developed into a roller coaster of euphoria, jails and mental
hospitals.
   Pettersson studied acting in the 1960s, but dropped out of
acting school after being accused of theft.
   There were conflicting accounts of his political views _ or of
whether he had any.
   During the trial, he described himself as an admirer of Palme.
The four-term prime minister was a champion of social democratic
causes and a leading architect of Sweden's welfare state.
   After the slaying, Pettersson signed several public letters of
condolence.
   However, friends testified that Pettersson bore a deep hatred
toward Sweden's highly structured society, where drugs are not
tolerated and drinking is officially discouraged.
   Newspapers speculated that he developed a hatred for Palme in
1980 after contacts in jail with a right-wing extremist.
   In 1970, Pettersson escaped from a mental hospital, got into an
argument with a stranger and killed him with a bayonet.
   The slaying occurred close to where Palme was gunned down 16
years later. Evidence at the time indicated that Pettersson fled
the scene down a small side street, the same one taken by Palme's
killer.
   Pettersson was convicted of manslaughter, held in a psychiatric
ward and released after seven months.

   Taxi drivers will have to know the Bronx is up
and the Battery's down to qualify for a hack license under a new
training program that also requires them to take sightseeing tours.
   ``There's been lots of complaints and concern from the public
that taxi drivers don't get them to where they want to go,''
Anthony Carter, a spokesman for New York City's Taxi and Limousine
Commission, said in announcing the program Wednesday.
   To remedy those complaints, the commission started a series of
educational programs that ``should make the taxi industry's image
more positive by ensuring that drivers are better prepared for the
demands of this difficult career,'' said Commissioner Jack S. Lusk.
   By year's end, applicants will be required to pass a 40-hour
training course, double the current requirement. They will have to
know the street network and key locations.
   During eight hours on a sightseeing bus, they will be shown the
shortest routes to and from airports as well as destinations most
requested by passengers.
   The taxi driver test will require prospective cabbies to
demonstrate an ability to plan routes and find key entertainment,
business and tourist sites.
   Additional time is to be spent on driver-passenger relations.

<HEAD>Government Says Warrior Leader Would Renew Reservation Tension If
Released</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM KATES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of a Mohawk warrior faction,
arrested in a the running standoff with state police on the St.
Regis reservation, is not wanted back on Indian territory, an FBI
agent testified Wednesday.
   The Mohawks' chiefs said if Art Montour is returned to the
Akwesasne community it would only aggravate an already volatile
situation, FBI Agent John McEligot said at a pre-trial detention
hearing in U.S. District Court.
   Montour, 47, leads the Mohawk Sovreign Security Force, a group
responsible for the 4-day-old, armed blockade of the state highway
that runs through the reservation straddling the St. Lawrence River
on the U.S.-Canadian border.
   The group has vowed not to let police enter the reservation.
   Montour, arrested Monday in a clash with state police that
injured 11 people, is accused of using a gun to hold off state
troopers and FBI agents during a raid last Thursday on the
reservation's illegal gambling parlors.
   Magistrate Gustave DiBianco, who is considering whether bail
should set for Montour, adjourned the hearing until Friday. Montour
is charged with forcibly impeding execution of a search warrant
through the use of a deadly weapon.
   McEligot testified that he interviewed the three chiefs elected
by reservation residents and recognized by the U.S. government as
the Mohawk's leaders and all three said they did not want Montour
allowed to return.
   ``Chief (Lincoln) White described him as a disruptive force and
said if he comes back it would boil again,'' said McEligot.
   The chiefs said Montour is not a reservation resident and his
force is not recognized by tribal leaders, said McEligot. The
chiefs said Montour refused to remove the blockade of Route 37 when
they asked him, he testified.
   Montour's arrest Monday came during a clash that broke out
occurred as about 75 Mohawks tried to leave the Askwesasne
community to talk with reporters about the raids on the casinos and
the continuing blockade of the reservation.
   About 75 state troopers have been posted at the edge of the
reservation and have erected roadlocks to keep non-residents from
entering the Akwsasne community since last Thursday.
   State Police Maj. Ronald Brooks said Wednesday there were no
plans to scale back the number of troopers at the reservation or
remove the roadblocks.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Brunetti said Montour has been
linked to the 1974 takeover of a Girl Scout camp in the Adirondacks
in a clash that left two people wounded, and with the 1979 seizure
of the reservation's police department and subsequent assault of
the police chief and three patrolmen.
   He was indicted in the 1979 incident, but the charges were
dropped.

   A state advertisement that used a
pornographic movie title to lure filmmakers was withdrawn after the
Seattle police chief objected.
   The ad proclaiming, ``Debbie Could Have Done Dallas in
Seattle,'' was run in American Cinematographer magazine by the
state Film and Video Office.
   The wording was a play on the X-rated movie title ``Debbie Does
Dallas.''
   But Seattle Police Chief Patrick Fitzsimons wasn't amused.
   ``It was absolutely unnecessary to use a pornographic reference
to lure business,'' he said. ``That particular film is very
demeaning to women. It's decadent.''
   Christine Lewis, head of the film bureau, acknowledged the chief
had a point. She pulled the quarter-page ad, which cost taxpayers
$600.
   ``I'm sorry I ran it,'' she said Wednesday. ``We made an error
of judgment and it won't run again.
   ``We wanted to catch people's attention, with an ad that would
be eye-catching and humorous and speak to an industry that
understands what we're trying to say,'' Lewis said.
   She said the ad was intended to publicize the state's diversity.
   ``That's one of our selling points, that we can look like New
England or Bavaria or L.A. or Arizona or the Midwest,'' she said.
   Pornography or permissiveness was the last thing on her mind,
said Lewis. She said she called Fitzsimons to apologize.
   This year the state has been the site of 12 films or made-for-TV
movies, and another three projects are expected.

<TEXT>
   A paraplegic who hauled
himself up 3,200-foot El Capitan 6 inches at a time over nine days,
using only his powerful arms, reached the summit of the challenging
cliff Wednesday.
   Mark Wellman was greeted by fellow park rangers with a T-shirt
reading ``See you at the top.''
   ``I'm tired,'' he said in a radio conversation with supporters
at the base of the cliff. ``I have pains where I didn't even know I
had parts.''
   ``It's great, it's fantastic,'' he said. ``It was a really
great, beautiful climb and a really wonderful experience.''
   He had some advice for others who are physically handicapped:
``Go out and do it! If you feel you can do it, just go out and do
it.''
   Wellman, 29, and friend Mike Corbett started the day about 300
feet from the top of the granite cliff, after spending the night
tied into sleeping bags on Chickenhead Ledge. Wellman covered about
125 feet in the first two hours and just before noon cut loose his
extra gear for the final push to the top.
   At 1:50 p.m. PDT, they reached the summit.
   ``No one in my situation has ever done anything like this, and
that I'm proud of,'' Wellman, 29, said at a news conference atop
the rock, attended by some 55 reporters, friends and park rangers
who climbed an easy trail. ``I felt like the whole world was
watching.''
   Wellman and Corbett later came down the mountain along a trail
and arrived at the Valley floor at 8:45 p.m. Wellman rode down on a
horse. They planned to go out to dinner.
   Corbett, who carried Wellman the final yards where the peak
leveled out, called his friend ``a great companion, so solid, never
complaining, always going for it.''
   At the top, Corbett gave his friend a signed photograph of
Yosemite, on which he wrote: ``It was an unbelieveable
experience.'' The pair sipped champagne, gulped ice water and
Corbett had a cigarette; he had smoked a pack a day during the
climb and had run out.
   The climbers were a day behind schedule. They began the grueling
effort July 18, and had been battling gusting wind and 90-degree
heat.
   ``You have a dream and you know the only way that dream is going
to happen is if you just do it ... even if it's 6 inches at a
time,'' Wellman told reporters before beginning the climb.
   Wellman, whose legs have been paralyzed since a 1982 fall from
another Yosemite peak, became the first paraplegic to make the
vertical trek, doing 7,000 pullups on ropes placed by Corbett.
   The two had said they were really sore and had been pushing to
finish the climb as early as possible.
   Awaiting them on top was a sloping granite summit with a stark,
windswept landscape considered one of the most beautiful spots in
the world. A dazzling view includes some of the towering peaks of
the Sierra Nevada and Half Dome, another of the park's most famous
features.
   Near the ledge they climbed over is a lone, contorted ancient
pine that has greeted thousands of climbers since the face was
first scaled in 1958.
   Wellman's companion, Corbett, 35, had previously scaled El
Capitan 41 times, more than any other climber. He will be reunited
with his estranged family this weekend because of publicity over
the climb.
   His brother and several others were flying in from Houston to
meet him, and the anticipation has distracted him from the climbing
routine. He said he couldn't sleep Monday.
   ``I've got to fill my family in on a lot of things that have
happened in the last 10 years of my life,'' Corbett said by radio
to Gwen Schneider, his girlfriend.
   Schneider said Corbett last talked to his family in 1981 after a
``really traumatic'' divorce by his parents.
   The two climbed as far as they could each day since the weekend
in hopes of making up a day and a half lost when the climb slowed
to a vertical crawl.
   Their biggest problem was wind, which Wellman said gusted from
11 a.m. to 8 p.m. each day, sometimes blowing them 10 feet out from
the cliff face.
   The heat was less of a problem, but temperatures occasionally
topped 100 degrees on the face of the cliff.
   Wellman chose a route that is almost straight up because it was
more practical for him.
   The route included tackling the Shield Roof, a ledge jutting 40
feet out from the monolith at 2,000 feet above Yosemite Valley. The
two had to dangle beneath it and hoist themselves up a rope with
valley floor far below them.
   Wellman was paralyzed from the waist down when he fell 50 feet
during a climb of 13,700-foot Gables Peak south of Yosemite in
1982. He was hospitalized for seven months, but has since been as
active as possible, staying in shape with sports like kayaking and
directing the park's program for disabled visitors.
   He trained daily for six months for the El Capitan climb, making
35 practice climbs on other sheer rocks and training with weights.

   Visitors to the City-County Building can rest
in style now, much to the chagrin of Councilman Jim Ferlo.
   The nine new steel and mahogany benches placed in the lobby this
week cost more than $1,600 each.
   ``I know city workers' (behinds) are golden, but that's a lot of
money,'' Ferlo said.
   General Services Director Dawn Botsford said the benches are
worth the money. The lobby has been benchless since May 1988, when
yellow plastic benches were removed because some officials thought
they were an eyesore.
   ``We needed benches that would be extremely sturdy, that
couldn't be lifted and stolen, and would fit in with the decor of
the lobby,'' Ms. Botsford said.
   Bill Davis of the city Finance Department had a mixed opinion.
   ``They're beautiful. They're a work of art,'' he said, but
added, ``They're not comfortable to sit in.''

   State highway officials trying to
assess traffic patterns near this southern Missouri Army base gave
new meaning to the military tradition of ``hurry up and wait.''
   From 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. Tuesday, officials from the Missouri
Department of Highways and Transportation closed one southbound
lane of a highway leading to the base. Officials pulled over every
fifth driver to determine where they were coming from, where they
were going and why.
   The result was a three-hour traffic jam that caused more than
1,500 employees to arrive late for work at the base and left some
motorists fuming.
   The survey was to continue until Aug. 3, said Tom Keith, a state
traffic engineer.
   ``We will re-evaluate it and see if we can do it another way,''
Keith said. The department may send out questionnaires or place an
automatic counter on the road, he said.
   Tuesday's survey showed 748 cars entered the post every 15
minutes during rush hour, Army spokeswoman Charlotte Wiggins said.

   The sabotage of four commercial
jetliners awaiting preflight testing is under investigation,
McDonnell Douglas officials said Wednesday.
   In all, inspectors at Douglas Aircraft Co. have discovered 15
acts of sabotage since late last week, said company spokesman Dave
Eastman. ``We haven't discovered any more problems yet,'' he said.
   The sabotage included severed tail hydraulic lines, nose wheel
steering cables and wheel well brake system wires on its mid-size
MD-80 aircraft, said company spokesman Don Hanson.
   ``We have to face the fact that these were more than accidents.
Much as it makes your blood boil to consider it (sabotage), you
have to consider it,'' Hanson said.
   Eastman said Wednesday that earlier reports that front
windshields on the jetliners had been smashed were incorrect.
Actually only two windshields had been scratched, he said.
   The four jets were parked on a testing ramp at the southwestern
edge of Douglas property that abuts Long Beach Airport.
   Douglas has stepped up security on its west flight ramp, where
every system of each MD-80 is tested before it is flown, Hanson
said. The firm also launched an internal investigation.
   The company did not contact federal or local law enforcement
agencies about the incidents, Hanson said.
   Under new security precautions, employees must obtain clearance
from their supervisors to be on the test ramp. Employees also must
sign in and out when they board and leave a plane and must be
accompanied by at least one other person.
   The MD-80 is a twin-engine aircraft that seats between 112 and
142 passengers.

<HEAD>`Friendship State' Slogan Too `Wimpy' for Texas, Gubernatorial Hopefuls
Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plan to print ``The Friendship State'' on
Texas license plates has stirred up gubernatorial candidates, who
say Texans are too tough for such a slogan.
   ``It's wimpy,'' said Democratic state Treasurer Ann Richards,
the first of the gubernatorial hopefuls to join the chorus of
opponents to the slogan approved last week by the state Highway and
Public Transportation Commission.
   Friendship is too generic a term for Texas, where the tough
``Don't Mess With Texas'' anti-littering slogan has proven so
popular, Ms. Richards said.
   ``I think the reason the `Don't Mess With Texas' thing has been
so successful is that it sort of continues that image that we're
great, we're wonderful, we think we are,'' she said. ``The friendly
state _ you could put that on Kansas, Ohio.''
   Ms. Richards said she agreed with hundreds of callers who have
suggested putting the ``Lone Star State'' nickname on plates.
   Jack Rains, the former secretary of state who launched his
Republican gubernatorial bid Tuesday, agreed.
   ``I kind of like the `Lone Star State,''' Rains said. ``The rest
of that stuff looked a little quiche and chablis to me.''
   Attorney General Jim Mattox, who is seeking the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination, said newspapers should run ballots with
several slogan options that people could mail in.
   ``That way, we wouldn't have to go through an expensive ballot
proposition of having the public actually vote on the matter, but
the people would have the decision-making in their hands,'' Mattox
said.
   Indeed, two news organizations have found strong opposition to
the license plates.
   Some 4,000 people responded to a phone-in poll by The Dallas
Times Herald, and 64 percent were against the new plates. In
Houston the negative vote was even more resounding: More than 2,700
viewers who called KHOU-TV, and 89 percent said they opposed the
new design.

   Space shuttle Columbia is scheduled
to lift off Aug. 8 on a mission with five military astronauts and a
classified Pentagon spy satellite.
   NASA selected the date Wednesday at the conclusion of a two-day
flight review that assessed the readiness of the orbiter, payload,
global tracking network and all other mission elements.
   Columbia will be making the 30th shuttle flight and the fourth
solely dedicated to the Defense Department. The astronauts
reportedly will release a sophisticated reconnaissance satellite.
   For national security reasons, the Pentagon would not permit the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration to announce an exact
liftoff time or the length of the mission. Once Columbia is
orbiting, a news blackout will be in effect until about an hour
before landing.
   The announcement said only that launch would occur between 7:30
a.m. and 11:30 a.m. EDT on Aug. 8. The countdown will be made
public nine minutes before the planned liftoff.
   Columbia's crew members are Air Force Col. Brewster Shaw, the
commander; Navy Cmdr. Richard Richards, Navy Cmdr. David Leestma,
Air Force Lt. Col. James Adamson and Air Force Maj. Mark Brown.
   When NASA officials began the review meeting Tuesday, a
potential problem with a fuel valve existed. They said that if
engineers had to replace it the launch would have to be delayed two
or three days beyond the targeted date.
   But the problem turned out to be a false sensor reading, and
NASA qualified the valve for flight on Wednesday.
   The flight will be the eighth for Columbia, the oldest of the
shuttles and its first in 3{ years. Following the Challenger
explosion in January 1986, Columbia was the last of the three
remaining shuttles to receive more than 200 safety and performance
modifications.
   Changes were completed earlier on Discovery and Atlantis and
each has been launched twice since post-Challenger flights resumed
last September.

<HEAD>Jaruzelski Says A Solidarity Government Unacceptable To Allies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski said he
rejected Solidarity's offer to take over the government because
Poland's Communist neighbors would not approve, a top opposition
lawmaker told colleagues.
   Gen. Jaruzelski also criticized the free trade union movement
for demanding a more representative government but spurning his bid
to form a governing coalition, said the lawmaker, Jozef Slisz.
   Later Wednesday, Solidarity lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to
reject Jaruzelski's offer to join the Communists in a governing
coalition and decided it would not be ``useful'' for members to
accept government posts individually.
   Slisz, deputy speaker of the Senate and head of the independent
farmers' union Rural Solidarity, said Jaruzelski told him during a
meeting Tuesday that he would not nominate Solidarity to form the
next government.
   ``He justified it this way: that if we took over the whole
government all the adjoining countries would be looking at us
askance,'' Slisz told the caucus of Solidarity lawmakers. ``He
mentioned first of all East Germany, Czechoslovakia and the
Russians.''
   Jaruzelski's comments indicated resistance among the ruling
Communists in those nations to Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's call for Warsaw Pact allies not to interfere with a
neighbor's moves toward democracy.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa also met with Jaruzelski on
Tuesday and rejected participation in a governing coalition, saying
it was ``inevitable'' that Solidarity would eventually govern.
   Slisz said Jaruzelski criticized the opposition for ``screaming
about pluralism'' but rejecting an offer to take part in the
government.
   Besides one of several deputy prime minister's posts, Jaruzelski
was willing to offer the ministries of health, building, ecology
and industry, Slisz said.
   The offer elicited derisive laughter from the Solidarity caucus.
The ministries named are responsible for some of Poland's worst
problems. The economy is in disarray, with consumer shortages daily
becoming more acute.
   The opposition believes its success in last month's historic
parliamentary elections entitles it to take over the government;
Solidarity-backed candidates won all but one of the seats they were
allowed to contest in the Soviet bloc's freest elections since the
postwar Communist takeover.
   Slisz said Jaruzelski advised the opposition to take a few
ministries now, work at reducing the bureaucracy, and prepare for
taking power in the future.
   Solidarity's parliamentary leader, Deputy Bronislaw Geremek,
said the Communists do not want to give up the government because
that would mean the end of their patronage system, with thousands
of party functionaries fired.
   ``Why do authorities ... not agree to the opposition forming the
government?'' he said. ``Because ... they have no chance of
surviving in such a situation.''
   Jaruzelski, elected president by the bare minimum of votes in
parliament last week, may announce who he will nominate to form the
next government when parliament convenes next week.
   The Central Committee of the Communist Party scheduled a meeting
Friday and Saturday to approve his decision. At that time,
Jaruzelski is expected to quit as party leader in keeping with a
pre-election promise.
   Walesa said after meeting Jaruzelski Tuesday that if Solidarity
was not be allowed to form the entire government, it would remain
in opposition and form a shadow Cabinet.
   The stance against joining a coalition was endorsed by
Solidarity lawmakers in an overwhelming show of hands, although
some of them complained that Walesa should have consulted them
first.
   In April, Solidarity was reinstated after a seven-year ban and
the ruling Communists agreed to allow the free trade union movement
to enter parliament as an opposition party.

   Dealing with Iran remains the best option for
winning the release of nine Americans held in Lebanon, but the
United States must not rule out talking to the captors or paying
ransom, according to a study on terrorism released today.
   The Rand Corp. report also contends that Iran continues to
overestimate the importance of the hostages to the U.S. government.
   ``The fate of the ... hostages is a matter of concern ... but it
is not a central issue,'' the study said. ``The government is under
no immediate pressure from the public to bring the hostages home.''
   The longest held of the Americans is Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. Anderson was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Veteran terrorist researcher Brian Michael Jenkins said in the
report, ``Terrorism: Policy Issues for the Bush Administration,''
that hostages provide a group ``with a certain amount of prestige.''
   Iran, the study said, has lost much of its strategic importance
to the United States, in part because of improved U.S.-Soviet
relations and because world oil production remains high and
comparatively cheap.
   ``To put it bluntly, in a way that no U.S. official can say
publicly, Washington can wait'' for a more receptive government in
Iran, even as ``dealing through Iran remains ... our best bet for
getting the hostages released,'' according to the report.
   But Jenkins said there are ``powerful forces'' in Iran who
``continue to oppose any kind of rapprochement with the West.''
   ``None of the alternatives look very promising,'' Jenkins wrote.
   ``Threatening the captors or Tehran with military retaliation
... has emotional appeal but is not likely to work and might
imperil the hostages. Rescue ... is a long shot, especially if we
are concerned with getting the hostages out alive.
   ``That leaves ransom, a distasteful course of action but one
which should not be ruled out entirely,'' Jenkins said, adding that
the U.S. no-concession policy that emerged after the Iran-Contra
arms scandal ``has become dangerously rigid.''
   ``Most nations subscribe to no-concessions policies in theory,''
he said. ``In practice, however, many of them have made deals to
obtain the release of their citizens held hostage, although they
may deny that the apparent concessions were part of any deal, or
argue that these things were done for loftier purposes.''
   Even Israel, the nation seen to exemplify the hard line, ``has
on several occasions made concessions to obtain the release of
hostages.''
   Part of the problem, the report said, is that the captors have
not been clear or consistent about exactly what they want in return
for the release of the hostages.
   The Rand Corp., a Santa Monica, Calif.-based private, non-profit
organization, sponsors research, often under government contract,
on issues affecting national security.
   Though the terrorism study was spawned by an earlier project
sponsored by the Defense Department, Rand said it paid for the
report out of its own funds.

   President Fidel Castro told his countrymen
that the United States is eager to exploit recent setbacks in the
socialist world and may emulate Nazi Germany by trying to establish
a 1,000-year colonial empire.
   Standing bare-headed in a drizzle for almost two hours Wednesday
night, Castro said Cuba must brace itself for the worst if the
world socialist movement collapses.
   Castro said the United States might try to invade and occupy
Cuba, defeat Cuba in a war of attrition or blockade the island.
   When Castro spoke about the ``triumphal'' attitude of President
Bush because of political and economic problems facing socialism,
the chief U.S. diplomat in Cuba, Jay Taylor, walked out.
   If socialism disappears, Castro said, the ``imperialist powers''
would divide the world just as they did ``in the worst of times''
before the 1917 Russian Revolution.
   The occasion for the speech was the 36th anniversary of the
armed attack that signaled the beginning of Castro's struggle
against the dictatorship he ousted in 1959.
   By the time he finished his speech, much of his green military
uniform was soaked as were many of the tens of thousand who turned
out for the speech.
   Castro's address was split into two parts. For the first hour
and 10 minutes he praised the economic and social progress the
revolution has brought to this farming area 300 miles east of
Havana.
   The second part, lasting just under 40 minutes, represented one
of the gloomiest assessments of the world situation that Castro
ever has offered.
   ``Imperialist circles are dreaming about an empire of 1,000
years, as in his time Adolf Hitler did,'' Castro said.
   But he said any such effort would be no more successful than
Hitler's.
   At a time when tensions between East and West seem to be at
postwar low, Castro's remarks struck a somewhat incongruous note.
   He not only attacked the United States, he was openly concerned
about the ability of the Soviet Union to survive the nationalist
uprisings and other problems afflicting the country.
   Castro raised the possibility that Cubans might wake up some
morning and learn that civil war has broken out in the Soviet Union
or that the country has disintegrated.
   ``Even in this circumstance, Cuba will continue fighting and
will continue struggling,'' Castro said.
   He said problems in the Soviet Union could lead to an aid
cutback and force Cubans to tighten their belts. According to U.S
estimates, Cuba receives more than $6 billion in economic and
military aid from the Soviets each year.
   He said the news that hundreds of thousands of miners in the
Soviet Union are on strike ``fills the imperialists with joy''.
   ``The dream of the imperialists is for the Soviet Union to
disintegrate,'' he said. He also denounced what he said were
``fascist'' tendencies in Poland, where Soldarity made huge gains
last month year in the country's freest elections in four decades.
   Castro was expected to discuss the corruption and drug
trafficking that resulted in the executions two weeks ago of four
high-ranking officers, including Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa, a Cuban
military hero.
   However, he ignored the issue.

<HEAD>Ag Economist Says U.S. Farmers Affected by Overseas Problems</HEAD>

   An Agriculture Department economist says
American farmers can suffer when overseas competitors run into
severe economic problems. Soybeans and wheat are a case in point.
   Gregory Gajewski of the department's Economic Research Service
said Brazil and Argentina were examples of countries with large
international debt burdens, domestic pressures and rapid inflation.
   In Argentina, prices of farm ``inputs'' rose 17 percent in
March, nearly 80 percent in May, and more than 100 percent in June,
he said. In Brazil, these inputs, or items needed for farm
production, rose more than 1,000 percent last year and are still
going up.
   Both countries are major exporters of agricultural commodities.
Brazil is a prime competitor of the United States in soybeans, and
Argentina is a traditional wheat exporter.
   Gajewski said a critical factor in the two countries has been
their government-controlled exchange rates.
   Brazil's currency, the novo cruzado, was overvalued by 20
percent to 40 percent earlier this year, he said. But the
government was reluctant to devalue because devaluations add to
short-term inflation.
   ``With the overvalued currency and dropping world soybean
prices, the prices Brazilian bean growers received were too low
cover costs,'' Gajewski writes in the August issue of Agricultural
Outlook magazine. ``To protest, the growers stopped selling their
soybeans for two weeks in June.''
   He added: ``Though the government responded with a 12 percent
devaluation, half the crop remains to be sold. Sales likely will be
concentrated in the next few months.''
   The USDA has estimated Brazil's 1988-89 soybean harvest at a
record 22 million metric tons, and expects exports to be up by
about two-thirds from last season. But the department expects
1989-90 production to be down and that exports will remain about
the same.
   ``Brazilian bean output has grown 45 percent in the 1980s,''
Gajewski said. ``But, had the economic growth not faltered under
the heavy international debt burden, much of this extra bean output
could have gone to support the then-growing chicken industry.
   ``Instead, with people's incomes off, local demand for meat
fell, and soybean exports surged. So U.S. farmers face more
competition in the world bean market.''
   In Argentina, wheat production is expected to increase this
year, reflecting a recovery from drought, higher world prices and
recent policy reforms by a newly elected president.
   Currency was devalued by more than 50 percent this month, and
the new government has cut interest rates on short-term
agricultural credit.
   ``Both moves, combined with recent good weather, increased
farmers' incentives to grow wheat for export,'' Gajewski said.
Consequently, USDA boosted its projection of Argentine wheat
exports in 1989-90 by 7 percent.
   ``Bottom line: U.S. farmers will feel some extra competition in
the world wheat market because of policy decisions made in Buenos
Aires,'' he said.

   The Agriculture Department says a mystery
fungus, perhaps from Japan, has riddled gypsy moths in the
Northeast this summer and may turn into a new weapon against the
destructive pests.
   ``This is the first time a fungus has been known to cause a
massive die-off of gypsy moth caterpillars in North America, said
entomologist Ann Hajek of the department's Agricultural Research
Service. ``I saw single trees with thousands of caterpillar
corpses.''
   Hajek, based at the agency's laboratory in Ithaca, N.Y., has
been working to identify the fungus, which was found in the western
Connecticut towns of Wilton and Hamden. She said the same fungus
probably killed the pests in areas of Massachusetts, New York, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire.
   ``Whatever the fungus is, it's definitely an addition to our
arsenal of weapons against gypsy moths,'' she said Wednesday in a
report by the agency. ``It could provide a new method for
biological control for these pests.''
   Hajek said it's possible that the fungus is Entomophaga
maimaiga, a fungus imported from its native Japan for testing
against gypsy moth caterpillars. But she said no releases of the
Japanese fungus were made in the areas where the ``mystery'' fungus
has been found.

   A herd of prolific Chinese hogs has been
officially admitted into the United States for breeding experiments.
   The 140 hogs were released after four months of quarantine and
testing at the Agriculture Department's animal import center on
Fleming Key near Key West, Fla., James W. Glosser, administrator of
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said Wednesday.
   Three breeds with exotic names are involved: Meishan, Ming and
Feng-Jing. The animals were obtained through a contract between the
department's Agricultural Research Service and the Chinese National
Animal Breeding Stock Import and Export Corp.
   Under the agreement, the USDA research agency, the University of
Illinois, and Iowa State University are equally sharing costs of
the imported hogs and will share the animals for study.
   Glosser said the hogs will next reside at USDA's meat animal
research center, Clay Center, Neb.; the University of Illinois,
Urbana; and Iowa State University, Ames.
   The Chinese animals were described as ``unusually prolific'' and
that their twice-yearly litters average 16 to 20 newborn, with a
record of 33. That compares to an average of 10 to 12 young for
most U.S. breeds, he said.

   The 65 mph speed limit on most rural
interstate highways is prompting more fast-car ads, encouraging
speeding and killing more people, according to an insurance
industry report.
   The report presented to Congress on Wednesday by the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety concludes that 550 of the 2,485 deaths
on rural interstate highways last year were caused by the 65 mph
limit.
   A federal highway official also said higher speeds on 65 mph
roads may be causing more deaths, but a spokesman for a motorists'
group said 1988 fatality statistics are being misinterpreted.
   Actual 1988 deaths on rural interstates increased 34 percent
over the 1982-86 average in 38 states that raised the speed limit
to 65 mph in 1987, Brian O'Neill, insurance institute president,
told a House transportation subcommittee.
   The institute concluded, by comparing the data with fatality
figures on all roads, that 550 of the 1988 deaths were
statistically due to the higher speed limit. That represents a 30
percent increase over the 1982-86 average, with the other 4 percent
due to other factors.
   The 65 mph limit has been adopted by 40 states, with Virginia
and Georgia excluded from the institute study because they
increased speeds only last year. No state-by-state analysis of
fatalities was provided.
   Fatalities on all highways increased only 1.5 percent last year.
Interstate accidents caused about 6 percent of the 47,479 road
deaths, according to Transportation Department figures.
   Will Fox, spokesman for Citizens for Rational Traffic Laws of
Dane, Wis., told reporters after the hearing that higher speeds do
not kill more people. He said the fatality statistics are
misleading because they do not factor in the number of miles
traveled.
   The group, which said it represents 15,000 ``serious and
knowledgeable motorists,'' called the 65 mph limit ``the first step
in restoring credibility and respect for posted speed limits.''
   O'Neill, in the insurance institute report, said car ads imply
``speeding is fun and has no consequences.''
   He criticized ads for the Porsche 928S, which describe it as
``an attractive alternative to air travel,'' Acura which says its
cars' interiors are ``designed at 125 mph,'' and Subaru, which
advises potential buyers to ``catch us doing '90,'' which O'Neill
said is a double reference to the model year and to speed.
   ``Muscle cars just aren't compatible with safety,'' O'Neill said
in his report.
   He said evidence shows that because of the 65 mph limit, more
motorists are driving at 70, 75 and even 80 mph or higher.
   ``It's true that speeding isn't as rampant now as it was in the
waning months of the 55 mph,'' O'Neill acknowledged, ``but people
aren't automatically abiding by 65, either.''
   Proponents of the 65 mph limit said it would decrease the number
of drivers breaking speeding laws.
   Jeffrey R. Miller, acting head of the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, said 1988 traffic fatalities are still being
studied and NHTSA will issue its second report on the 65 mph speed
limit in September. The first in January was inconclusive.
   Miller said fatalities on all rural interstates were 13 percent
higher than in 1987, which he described as ``statistically
significant.''
   ``The overall pattern of the last two years suggests that an
increase in actual speeds on the 65 mph highways may be
contributing to the increase in fatalities,'' he said.
   However, in a statement submitted with Miller's testimony, the
agency said that until the September study is released, ``it would
be premature to reach a definitive conclusion on the safety effects
of the 65 mph speed limit.''

<HEAD>Pentagon Preparing Options, Including U.S. Troops, to Fight Drugs

   A Pentagon paper being drafted outlines a
series of options, including a direct role for U.S. troops, to help
stem the flow of cocaine into the United States from South America,
a military source says.
   The list of possible scenarios, the officer said Wednesday on
the condition of anonymity, will be turned over to Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney to be included in the national drug strategy
to be released Sept. 5 by drug czar William Bennett.
   The Defense Department isn't saying what its role should be to
fight drugs overseas, an idea promoted by President Bush before his
election. During his campaign he called for an ``international
strike force to hit back, quick and hard and often at foreign drug
operations'' to stop cocaine at its source.
   But programs run by the State Department and the Drug
Enforcement Administration have all but ceased in Peru and Bolivia,
where the majority of the world's coca grows along the slopes of
the Andes mountains. The government puts the blame on increased
Maoist guerrilla activity in the Upper Huallaga Valley in Peru, as
well as the South American governments' refusal to use aerial
herbicides to eradicate the coca plants.
   ``Do we put our men on the front line?'' the officer said,
listing one of the options. ``And how will it go over in Topeka
when the first body bag comes home?''
   He said the possibilities for overseas action range from
increased training of foreign military and law enforcement
officials to direct actions by the Army's Special Forces, known as
the Green Berets, and other elite military units.
   The National Security Council, which was preparing a report to
be included in the national plan, reportedly backs the idea of
larger use of American troops to curb cocaine in South America.
   An administration source, however, dubbed the idea of direct
intervention ``effectively a dead issue'' because the U.S.
government could not bring military troops into Peru or Bolivia
without ``an invitation,'' which would be unlikely.
   At a news conference Wednesday, the Defense Department's
coordinator for drug enforcement policy and support, Stephen M.
Duncan, briefed reporters on the Pentagon's drug efforts but
skirted questions about a direct interdiction role.
   ``Mr. Bennett will make recommendations, presumably to the
president on anything outside of the borders of the U.S., and we'll
be prepared to do anything the president asks us to do,'' Duncan
said.
   Instead, Duncan focused on the Defense Department's moves to cut
drug use within its ranks, saying that there had been an 82 percent
decline since 1982. He said 27 percent of the American military
personnel in 1980 used drugs, and that figure dropped to 4.8
percent last year.
   He credited the reduction to random drug testing, which he said
will continue for soldiers, civilian personnel and contractors.

   Several former employees of Rep. Gus Savage,
D-Ill., will be called to testify before a grand jury investigating
whether his son regularly reported to work when he was on the
payroll of the District of Columbia's congressional delegate,
sources say.
   The Justice Department is investigating Thomas John Savage, who
was on Delegate Walter Fauntroy's payroll for most of the period
between September 1987 and June 1988.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday
that three of those subpoenaed worked in Savage's Chicago office
during that period. The three have indicated they frequently saw
the younger Savage in the office, the sources said.
   All of those who received subpoenas are scheduled to testify
before a grand jury in Washington during the next two weeks, said
the sources.
   The grand jury was convened in May, a month after the Justice
Department expanded an investigation to examine all of Fauntroy's
hiring practices over the past five years.
   Justice Department David Runkel said he could not comment on the
case.
   The younger Savage, an affirmative action officer for the
Chicago Metropolitan Sanitary District, was not in his office
Wednesday and could not be reached for comment.
   Rep. Savage did not return three phone calls to his Washington
office.
   Fauntroy spokeswoman Livonia Perriman-Fairfax said none of
Fauntroy's current employees has been subpoenaed.
   The subpoenas are the latest step in a probe that began in
December after The Associated Press reported that Thomas Savage was
frequently in Chicago while he was on Fauntroy's payroll. For part
of the time in question, he was a candidate for the Illinois
Legislature, and was on leave from Fauntroy's payroll.
   Fauntroy says Savage took a 10-week unpaid leave.
   The elder Savage has been under fire in recent weeks after
reports that he accosted a Peace Corps worker during a visit to
Africa.

   The Bush administration will keep trying to
persuade the Palestine Liberation Organization to participate _
without conditions _ in an Israeli election plan now that Yasser
Arafat's group has endorsed the concept.
   The problem, State Department officials disclosed Wednesday, is
that the PLO wants a ``guaranteed outcome'' that includes the
establishment of a Palestinian state.
   Even while the PLO position was being outlined in public for the
first time, U.S. ambassador Robert Pelletreau Jr. was having
another session in Tunisia with Hakam Ballaoui, the PLO
representative in the North African country.
   Details were not disclosed. A brief State Department
announcement said only that ``several issues related to the
dialogue'' were discussed.
   The United States and Israel oppose statehood for the 1.4
Palestinian Arabs who Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is trying to
persuade to take part in elections leading to limited self-rule.
Without PLO approval the idea is unlikely to go anywhere.
   Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, called the
PLO precondition unacceptable. She refused to say whether the
U.S.-backed election proposal had been harmed or helped by the
PLO's acceptance of the concept with strings attached.
   What she and other officials left clear, however, is that the
United States will keep talking about the election proposal to the
PLO in Tunisia, where the group is headquartered, as the most
opportune way to open Mideast negotiations.
   Shamir envisions elected Palestinians negotiating with Israel a
five-year self-rule arrangement that would be followed by talks
also involving Egypt and Jordan on an overall settlement.
   Other State Department sources said the PLO also demanded that
Israel agree in advance to trade territory for peace.
   Reports in Israeli newspapers said a U.S. memorandum outlining
the PLO position was conveyed to Jerusalem _ possibly through
Soviet diplomats.
   The United States meets periodically with the Soviet Union on
regional problems, including the Arab-Israeli conflict. The last
such session on the Middle East was held here June 15-16.
   Ms. Tutwiler said no U.S. memorandum had been prepared. But
other sources in the department said American diplomats prepared
written summaries of discussions with the PLO on at least two
occasions. They said these summaries were not given to the Soviets.
   The United States broke its isolation of the PLO last December
after chairman Arafat, at U.S. urging, said publicly he renounced
terrorism and accepted Israel's right to exist.
   A series of meetings have been held since in Tunisia between
Pelletreau and various PLO officials _ not all of them publicly
disclosed. Two such involved Salah Khalaf, second-in-command to
Arafat. Known also as Abu Iyad, he has been described as the
suspected mastermind of the murder of 11 Israeli Olympic athletes
in Munich in 1972 and two U.S. diplomats in the Sudan in 1973.
   The Senate reacted last week by passing an amendment to restrict
U.S. contacts with the PLO. President Bush on Tuesday called the
legislation unconstitutional and did not promise there would be no
further U.S. talks with Arafat's deputy.
   Ms. Tutwiler said U.S. officials are ``pressing for movement''
on the election concept and to begin a dialogue between Israelis
and Palestinians in the occupied territories.
   The spokeswoman added that the PLO ``has told us privately, as
it has said publicly, that it supports the election concept as part
of a comprehensive peace plan. However, the PLO has put a number of
conditions on its support for elections which would prejudge the
outcome of a negotiated solution.''
   Ms. Tutwiler said: ``These conditions are not acceptable to us.
This is a key issue which we continue to discuss in our dialogue
with the PLO.''
   The only condition she was willing to cite was a PLO demand for
an independent Palestinian state.
   The Bush administration opposes establishment of a Palestinian
state. However, Bush has demanded that Israel yield West Bank and
Gaza territory, thereby matching another PLO demand that was
reiterated by the PLO in the talks in Tunisia.

<HEAD>Administration Supports Biological Weapons Bills</HEAD>

   The Bush administration, dropping the
objections of its predecessor, is supporting proposed legislation
to ban the production, stockpiling and export of biological weapons.
   The measures being considered by both the House and Senate are
designed to enable the Justice Department to prosecute Americans
who develop, stockpile or export biological weapons to terrorists
or to unstable Third World governments.
   This is the third time Congress has tried to adopt legislation
that would give teeth to a 1972 treaty outlawing germ warfare.
Previous attempts, in 1973 and again in 1980, failed.
   The Reagan administration refused to support such legislation,
saying existing laws banning export of hazardous materials were
sufficient.
   ``But there's no law that permits the authorities to stop the
weapon from being produced in the first place,'' said Sen. Herb
Kohl, D-Wis., one of the bill's sponsors.
   Biological weapons, described by some as ``the poor man's atom
bomb,'' are relatively easy to produce and a very small amount can
cause a widespread outbreak of deadly disease.
   Thomas Graham, general counsel of the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, said Wednesday that recent developments led the
administration to agree with Congress that specific laws on germ
warfare were needed.
   The advances in biotechnology and the desire of Third World
nations to acquire biological weapons lent urgency to the need for
such laws, he told the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   ``We feel that passage of such legislation ... would give a
clear signal to the world that the United States is serious about
controlling the proliferation of biological weapons,'' said
Assistant Secretary of State H. Allen Holmes.
   But Holmes conceded that preventing the export of such deadly
agents was all but impossible because the chemicals, organisms and
equipment used to produce weapons also are used for medical and
agricultural purposes and can be presented in the guise of
legitimate exports.
   Holmes said about 10 countries are thought to be working on
developing biological weapons, although he declined to name any
except the Soviet Union.
   Other officials have identified Syria and Iraq as two of the
countries engaging in such research.
   ``To date, we have no information that any known terrorist
organization has the capability to employ such weapons, nor that
states supporting terrorism have supplied such weapons,'' Holmes
said. ``However, we cannot dismiss those possibilities.''
   The United States renounced biological warfare in 1969 and
destroyed its stockpile of weapons.
   Representatives of the multimillion-dollar biotechnological
industries and scientific community expressed concern that the
bills would interfere with their research by making it possible for
law enforcement agents to seize and destroy toxins before
determining whether their purpose was legitimate.

<HEAD>U.S. Investigation Led to Cuban Drug Crackdown, Customs Leader Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Customs investigation _ not a newfound
Cuban determination to stop drug trafficking _ led that country to
bring charges that led to the execution of four officials, says
Customs Commissioner William von Raab.
   The investigation, code-named Operation Greyhound, discovered
that then-Interior Minister Jose Abrantes Fernandez, who oversaw
the border guards, among other duties, had directed elite Cuban
forces to oversee drug transfers on Cuban territory, von Raab told
a Senate panel Wednesday.
   Abrantes was fired June 29 in the midst of the trial of the four
officials, including a hero of the Cuban revolution, Gen. Arnaldo
Ochoa, that resulted in their execution two weeks ago. No charges
have been brought against Abrantes, a State Department official
said.
   Von Raab told the Senate Foreign Relations' subcommittee on
terrorism, narcotics and international operations that he thinks
Operation Greyhound, begun in February, was probably what pushed
the prosecution of Ochoa and three colleagues.
   The commissioner, who was reading a document marked ``secret''
at the start of the hearing, told reporters later that the Cubans
found out about Operation Greyhound either through an escaped
prisoner or ``maybe the State Department told them about us.''
   Melvyn Levitsky, the assistant secretary of state for
international narcotics matters, dismissed the latter allegation as
``nonsense.''
   Customs spokesman Dick Weart said a man named Gustavo Fernandez
had been in Customs' custody but escaped June 12, and the incident
is under investigation by the service's internal affairs bureau.
   Von Raab said Customs' confidential informant, whom he
identified only as the owner of an offshore racing team, said
Abrantes was providing the special troops to help with drug
smuggling.
   ``Minister Abrantes has provided security for transhipment of
drugs into the United States,'' von Raab told the Senate panel.
Operation Greyhound began in February, he said.
   It was not clear if he had been receiving money personally for
the services or had been acting at Castro's orders, he said.
   Cuban President Fidel Castro ``is just another piece of
narco-trash floating in the Caribbean,'' he said. ``He is looking
to the United States for a life preserver'' by requesting
cooperation in the drug war. ``I suggest we throw him an anchor.''
   During the hearing, several senators expressed concern about
Castro's overtures, with Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., saying that if
State Department officials are taken in by Castro's pleas for
cooperation, ``They're even bigger suckers than I think they are.''
   Sen. Robert Graham, D-Fla., said he wants the United States to
undertake a series of actions ``similar to those in the 1960s.''
During the Cuban missile crisis, the United States imposed a
blockade of the island until the Soviet Union agreed to pull out
missiles it had installed there and promised not to install new
ones.
   But the administration officials, including Levitsky and Michael
Kozak, the assistant secretary of state who heads the
inter-American affairs bureau, assured the panel that they also
were skeptical about the prospects for real cooperation.
   They said they believed Castro has known for years about the
Cuban military's involvement in drug trafficking and that the
administration has not yet determined why Castro had held the trial
and executions.
   Levitsky outlined a series of five steps Cuba must take before
the United States will take its offer of cooperation seriously.
Those steps include the extradition of people wanted on drug
charges in the United States, such as fugitive financier Robert
Vesco, and the breakoff of ties and aid to Panama's Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.

<TEXT>
   President Bush is giving a new push to
research on a high-speed space plane, but delaying until 1993 the
moment of judgment on whether to build it.
   The White House said Wednesday that Bush had accepted the
recommendation of Vice President Dan Quayle and the Space Council
to extend the timetable for developing the technology for the
National Aero-Space Plane, which would take off and land like a
plane but fly through the upper atmosphere at 25 times the speed of
sound.
   The plane, proposed by President Reagan in 1986, had been in
danger of being abandoned by a reluctant Pentagon.
   The technology development program was jeopardized in April when
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney proposed slashing its budget from
$300 million to $100 million in fiscal 1990 and to zero in 1991.
   But Bush has declared it ``a high priority national effort,''
and the Pentagon has agreed to continue joint program management
with NASA and to provide an increasing share of its budget.
   ``Unmanned as well as manned designs will be considered and the
program will be conducted in such a way as to minimize technical
and cost uncertainty,'' the White House said in a statement.
   The Bush administration will press for $254 million for the
project for fiscal 1990 _ split equally between the Pentagon and
National Aeronautics and Space Administration budgets.
   The deadline for a decision on whether to build an actual
experimental craft will be pushed back from late 1990 to early
1993. That means the earliest date for an actual flight would be
delayed from 1996 or 1997 until 2000, administration officials said.
   Instead of working on building an actual prototype craft,
research will be aimed at finding out whether it is technically
feasible to build an air-breathing, hypersonic engine capable of
flying at Mach 25. The craft would need new materials capable of
withstanding atmospheric heat of up to 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
   The supersonic Concorde, by comparison, flies at Mach 1.5, or 1{
times the speed of sound.
   If proved feasible, the same technology could be used to build
both civilian and military aircraft, said a Bush administration
official who asked not to be identified.
   ``It would revolutionize air travel to a certain degree,'' said
the official, adding that even Reagan's dream of a two-hour flight
from New York to Tokyo might be possible. Reagan had dubbed the
plane ``The Orient Express.''
   Under the new plan, the Pentagon would provide $127 million in
fiscal 1990, $158 million in 1991 and $233 million in 1992. NASA
contributions would drop from $127 million to $119 million to $72
million over the same period.

<HEAD>Ethics Panel May Probe Payroll Practices of House GOP Whip</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the House ethics committee launches a
preliminary investigation of Republican Whip Newt Gingrich, the
panel's top Republican says it will cover ``anything we see,''
including new questions about possible payroll irregularities.
   Rep. John T. Myers, R-Ind., said Wednesday the committee could
decide as early as next week whether to begin a formal
investigation of Gingrich, who initiated the ethics probe that
forced former Speaker Jim Wright from office in June.
   Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., asked the committee in April to
investigate whether a book promotion partnership created by
Gingrich in 1984 violated House rules and federal campaign finance
laws.
   The committee announced Tuesday it hired the Chicago law firm
that spearheaded the Wright investigation to review the complaint
against Gingrich and recommend whether to proceed with a full-scale
inquiry.
   ``If we vote for a preliminary inquiry, we would look at
everything,'' Myers said, when asked about disclosures this week
that Gingrich gave large temporary pay raises to aides, including
some who had resigned briefly to work in his campaign.
   Gingrich did not respond to repeated requests from The
Associated Press this week for comment on the pay raise reports,
which first surfaced in an Atlanta business publication.
   He said in a written statement, however, that temporary,
year-end raises are commonly used by House members to reward
hard-working staffers and that aides who work in his campaign
receive no special treatment when such raises are handed out.
   House payroll records show that Gingrich gave temporary raises
to 15 aides last fall, including two who took leaves for campaign
work. He gave similar raises to 13 aides in both 1987 and 1986,
including two in 1986 who took leaves to work in his re-election
campaign.
   Myers said he didn't know whether it was a widespread practice
for House members to give aides who worked on their campaigns a
temporary raise after they return.
   ``If true it would be troubling,'' he said. ``It would violate
the spirit of the House. We do not want to use government funds to
fund our campaigns.''
   A spot check of the payroll records of Gingrich's nine House
colleagues from Georgia found four who gave aides large temporary
raises last year, and one, Rep. John Lewis of Atlanta, who gave an
aide a one-month pay increase of 27 percent, 15 days after he
returned from a two-month campaign leave.
   House personnel rules state that ``year-end raises should be
made only on a permanent basis and only when the services of the
individual warrant.'' Federal law and House rules also prohibit
members from rewarding staff members for campaign work.
   Gingrich's 1988 campaign paid press secretary Sheila Ward $1,612
and executive assistant Sarah Grewe $1,262 during their one-month
leaves from his congressional payroll.
   Based on their pay rates when the leaves began, Ward would have
earned $1,606 and Grewe $1,500 if they had stayed on the
congressional payroll that month. After returning in mid-November,
temporary raises gave Ward $1,979 more than she would have made the
rest of the year at her old rate. Grewe earned an additional $1,986.
   The other 13 Gingrich congressional aides who received large
temporary raises during the final quarter of 1988 had their overall
pay boosted by amounts ranging from 9 percent to 44.9 percent, or
from $400 to $3,392.
   All 15 staffers had their pay reduced Jan. 1, though their new
salaries still were between 4 percent and 33 percent higher than
the previous October.

   A probe into Mayor Tom Bradley's financial
dealings is heating up with the City Council president demanding a
speedup in the investigation and the city attorney denying he's
dragging his heels.
   ``The delay in the completion of your investigation and report
is a matter of increasing concern to me, the public and to many
other members of the council,'' Council President John Ferraro
wrote in a letter delivered Wednesday to City Attorney James K.
Hahn's office.
   The letter said Hahn should seek outside help to speed up the
investigation.
   ``Until this occurs, there will be further erosion in the
public's confidence in government and in the ability of its elected
officials to conduct the business of the city,'' Ferraro wrote.
   Bradley, recently elected to a fifth term, has denied any
wrongdoing. But the hearings and inquiries into his financial
affairs constitutes the gravest crisis of his 16-year tenure as
mayor. On Tuesday, he dismissed speculation he might resign.
   Hahn, who was elected to office and is not aligned with the
mayor, responded within hours to the letter with one of his own.
   In a letter to Ferraro, the attorney said he expected to report
by mid-September. He said hiring outside counsel would be ``costly
and unnecessary,'' and took exception to charges the investigation
was taking too long.
   ``The allegations against the mayor that have arisen in this
politically charged atmosphere require thorough and careful
examination,'' he wrote. ``Neither the mayor, the council nor the
people of this city would be served by a rush to judgment.''
   The mayor's financial dealings were revealed in published
reports in March. The city attorney has been investigating
Bradley's transactions for more than a month.
   The council is investigating whether Bradley influenced the
award of $2 million in city deposits to Far East National Bank, for
which Bradley served as a paid consultant until he resigned the
position amid controversy last spring.
   Investigators learned the deposits had circumvented competitive
bidding procedures and came shortly after Bradley talked on the
telephone to City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg.
   On Monday, auditors disclosed the phrase ``per the mayor'' was
blotted out on a worksheet detailing city investments in Far East.
Bradley and Rittenberg have denied the mayor influenced the
investment.
   On Wednesday, Bill Hoss, a member of the city treasurer's staff,
told a City Council committee he believed that an audit conducted
by the City Administrative Office was aimed at him.
   ``I've come to the conclusion that this audit of the CAO (is
intended) to create a web of conspiracy,'' said Hoss, who was
testifying about how certain city financial documents came to be
altered by correction fluid.
   Hoss denied he altered the documents. One involved Far East
National Bank. Other documents changed by using correction fluid
involved Gibraltar Savings and Loan, where Bradley held a bond at
favorable interest rates.
   Hoss, testifying before the city's Finance and Revenue
Committee, said the audit's intent was to develop ``a conspiracy
involving the mayor, Bill Hoss and Gibraltar.''
   Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who chaired the hearing, said many
of Hoss' statements were contradictory.
   The hearings are examining how city financial documents came to
be altered and seek to determine if Bradley used his influence to
secure favorable treatment for financial institutions to which he
was linked.

<TEXT>
   Troops captured a prominent Communist
leader and his common-law wife today in what the government hailed
as a major breakthrough in the 20-year struggle against the rebels.
   Satur Ocampo, 50, a former journalist, and Carolina Malay, 49,
were arrested about 10 a.m. as they drove along a residential
street in suburban Makati, the military said.
   Ocampo, who escaped from prison in 1985, is believed to be a
member of the Central Committee of the banned Communist Party of
the Philippines and leader of the party's affiliated organizations.
   He and Malay negotiated with the government on behalf of the
rebel National Democratic Front during peace talks that collapsed
in January 1987.
   The military believes Ocampo also is chairman of the front, an
umbrella organization of 12 banned Marxist groups. Malay is
believed to be his deputy.
   Last week, the military offered a $23,800 reward each for their
capture.
   ``As far as we are concerned, the capture is a breakthrough,
particularly in terms of further weakening the insurgency,'' said
Noel Tolentino, a spokesman for President Corazon Aquino.
   Sen. Ernesto Maceda, chairman of the Senate Defense Committee,
said he hoped the arrest would mark a turning point in the
insurgency but may allow younger, more vigorous leaders to emerge
in rebel ranks.
   Earlier today, Brig. Gen. Alexander Aguirre, Manila regional
commander, said troops had raided 23 suspected rebel ``safe
houses'' throughout the capital in an operation that began late
Wednesday.
   Ocampo, who was presented to reporters at a military camp, said
he and Malay were riding in their car when another vehicle overtook
and cut them off. Three pistol-wielding soldiers jumped from the
car and arrested them, he said.
   ``My arrest is part of the armed struggle and does not mean
significant change in the movement,'' Ocampo told reporters. Malay
said that others would take their place ``as long as the government
continues to ignore the plight of the people.''
   Ocampo repeated rebel calls for new peace talks ``to discuss a
solution to social problems.'' The rebels have offered peace talks
if Mrs. Aquino closes the six U.S. military bases here.
   Ocampo was one of the best known figures in the shadowy rebel
movement. He served as business editor of The Manila Times
newspaper until it was closed when President Ferdinand Marcos
declared martial law in September 1972.
   Ocampo was arrested in 1976 and charged with rebellion and
subversion but was never brought to trial.
   He escaped in May 1985 when he was allowed to leave prison to
vote in elections for the National Press Club. Ocampo then slipped
away from his six military escorts and went underground.
   He resurfaced in 1986 after Mrs. Aquino took power and began
peace talks with the rebels.
   Ocampo, Malay and the third member of the rebel negotiating
team, Antonio Zumel, were at the time granted ``safe conduct
passes,'' enabling them to move freely in Manila without fear of
arrest.
   All three used the opportunity to make numerous appearances on
radio, television and in rallies, promising to end the rebellion if
the government accepted rebel demands for power sharing.
   After weeks of fruitless talks, the rebels broke off
negotiations on Jan. 22, 1987, shortly after troops killed 13
protesters during a march for land reform.
   Ocampo and the others went underground when a 60-day cease-fire
expired in February 1987.
   Since then, Ocampo has given interviews to journalists and
issued numerous press statements in the name of the rebel movement.
   The military claims to have captured about 10 Central Committee
members since 1987 although one of them, Romulo Kintanar, has since
escaped.

   Borrowing Hamlet's soliloquy from William
Shakespeare, Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., argued on the House
floor against the B-2 stealth bomber. Here is the text of his
statement:
   B-2, or not B-2: That is the question.
   Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
   the slings and arrows of outrageous expense,
   Or to take arms against a sea of deficits,
   And by opposing end them. To cut; to spend;
   No more; and by a cut to say we end
   the heartache and a thousand cost overruns
   That B-2 is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
   Devoutly to be wished. To cut; to spend;
   To spend? Perchance stretch-out! Ay, there's the rub;
   For in those stretch-outs what new overruns may come,
   When we have shuffled off deciding,
   Must give us pause. There's the respect
   That makes calamity of delay.
   For would stealth bear the whips and scorns of time,
   The lack of mission, the untried technology,
   The great expense, the inevitable delays,
   The excessive secrecy, and the cuts
   That must be made for Gramm-Rudman target's sake.
   When we ourselves might today stealth's termination make
   With a bare majority. Who would new tax burdens bear,
   To pay its $70 billion price tag,
   When the dread of a turkey worse than B-1,
   A flying bat-winged bomber whose cost per pound,
   Is that of gold, puzzles the mind
   And makes us rather keep those bombers that we now have
   Than fly to others that we know not of?
   Thus conscience should make cautious legislators of us all;
   And thus the hue of B-2 boosterism
   Must be replaced with the sober cast of thought,
   And this enterprise of great pith and moment,
   Be halted now before it further proceeds,
   A handsome bomber yes, but better
   Not to be.

   The nation's skies became more polluted in
1988, with up to 30 million more Americans now living in
communities with unhealthy air, the Environmental Protection Agency
said today.
   New EPA data shows that 101 geographical areas now violate
standards for ozone, the chief ingredient of smog, and 44 have
unhealthy carbon monoxide levels.
   But in addition to identifying polluted areas under current law,
the data has major implications for the future if Congress approves
new clean air legislation this session.
   Any new law would be expected to use the information to
establish new deadlines for pollution cleanup, and could determine
the severity of measures each area must adopt in order to make
steady progress.
   The newly compiled figures, when applied to President Bush's
clean air proposal, would bump the Chicago-Gary, Ind., area into
the top category for ozone pollution, allowing a 20-year cleanup in
return for adopting tough, anti-pollution measures.
   President Bush previously identified New York-northern New
Jersey, Houston and Los Angeles as cities that would be in the
two-decade ``severe'' category.
   Another 27 cities under the administration plan would be listed
in the ``serious'' ozone category, and have 10 years to clear their
air while undertaking similar measures. A list compiled by The
Associated Press on July 19, using slightly older data, identified
19 cities in the ``serious'' category.
   The most polluted areas for carbon monoxide, under the Bush
bill, would be New York-northern New Jersey; Steubenville
Ohio-Weirton, W.Va.; Winnebago County, Wis.; Los Angeles; and
Spokane, Wash. They would have a 10-year cleanup period, during
which a change in motor vehicle fuels and tighter vehicle emissions
standards would be used to improve air quality. Another 39 areas
would be under a lesser category in a two-tiered system, and be
expected to meet the standards in five years through the vehicle
emission reductions.
   The EPA blamed the hot, dry summer of 1988 for pushing the
number of ozone violators past the century mark, an increase of 37
smoggy areas from a year ago. Not a single geographical area
improved air quality enough to cross the line from violation to
compliance.
   The worsening situation for ozone was tempered somewhat by a net
decrease in areas failing to comply with the carbon monoxide
standard. EPA officials credited tighter motor vehicle standards,
established under the 12-year-old current law, for the improvement.
   The 44 areas in violation represent a decrease of eight
following the deletion of 12 non-compliance areas and the addition
of four.
   But it is the combined impact of both pollutants that
demonstrates how the air pollution problem is getting worse.
   According to EPA, the total number of Americans living where one
or both pollutants exceed allowable limits has increased from
nearly 80 million a year ago to a figure as high as 110 million.
The precise figure is unknown because the groupings of some
geographical areas for counting purposes have been changed over the
past year.
   ``This sharp increase in the number of areas not yet meeting the
ozone standard is dramatic proof of the pressing need for a new
clean air bill,'' said EPA Administrator William K. Reilly. ``The
problem is immense. We must address it now.''
   Reilly said the legislation proposed by the Bush administration
offers ``the best chance'' of cleaning the nation's air, but
environmental groups and their congressional backers have roundly
criticized the bill and are supporting alternative legislation.
   Ozone is a gas formed through chemical reactions, stimulated by
sunlight and temperature. Components of ozone are emitted from
motor vehicles, chemical manufacturing, dry cleaners, paint shops
and solvents. Ailments associated with the gas include inflammation
of the lungs, impaired breathing, coughing, chest pain, nausea and
throat irritation. Long-term effects include permanent damage to
lung tissues and impaired breathing capacity.
   Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, poisonous gas produced
by the incomplete burning of carbon in fuels, with two-thirds of
the emissions coming from motor vehicles.
   When inhaled, carbon monoxide disrupts the delivery of oxygen to
the body's organs and tissues, and is especially dangerous to those
with heart disease. The gas also impairs exercise capacity, visual
perception, manual dexterity, learning ability and performance of
complex tasks in healthy individuals.
   Under the Bush legislation, in addition to the four areas in the
``severe'' ozone category and the 27 listed as ``serious,'' 38
would be classified as moderate and 32 as marginal.

   Some people are trying to prove they can ``Do
The Right Thing'' when it comes to improving ethnic relations.
   An Italian family had dinner at a black family's apartment to
kick off a program intended to improve relations among ethnic
groups, and the welcome was as warm as the hot summer day.
   ``I was going to make Italian food, but when I found out the
family was Italian, I knew I could never compete with an Italian
housewife,'' said Kim Baez, a black single mother of two who opened
up her East Harlem apartment to the Ferraro family from the borough
of Brooklyn.
   Joining the families were reporters and five television crews,
including one from West Germany, who jammed the small apartment
Wednesday, the summer's hottest day so far at 96 degrees.
   ``The next time, without any TV lights, you come to our house,''
said Giuseppe Ferraro after Mrs. Baez recited her menu of pork
chops, rice, beans and salad for the umpteenth time for the cameras.
   Their dinner launched the Citywide Ethnic Exchange Program,
which is sponsored by the National Ethnic Coalition of
Organizations, an umbrella group for 66 organizations. The group
provides the food and transportation.
   The dinner program started with the Ferraros and the Baezes in
part to help counteract negative publicity about Italian-black
relations, said William Fugazy, a limousine company owner and one
of the program's founders.
   ``This could be big. I don't mean a big love-in, but this could
be, `Do the Right Thing,' our way,'' he said.
   In the current movie ``Do the Right Thing,'' a riot breaks out
at a pizza parlor in Brooklyn after a dispute between black patrons
and the Italians who own the business.
   The movie was partly inspired by the 1986 confrontation in the
New York City neighborhood of Howard Beach, where three black men
who went into a pizza parlor were chased and beaten by a group of
white teen-agers. One of the black men was hit by a car and died.
   To prepare for the dinner and clean her home, Mrs. Baez took the
day off from her job as a bookkeeper. In the afternoon, she picked
up her two children, Sari, 9, and Gabriel, 11, who were at camp.
   ``Whatever comes out of this is good. She's divorced, and maybe
she needs us, maybe we can help her. I'm proud to be Italian, but I
love everybody,'' said Ferraro, who emigrated from Italy with his
wife, Maria, in 1969.
   They have four sons and Ferraro owns a home-improvement business.
   At first, the children didn't take too well to the media. When
someone shoved a microphone at Gabriel minutes after he walked
through the door and asked how he liked the Ferraros, he said: ``I
haven't even met them yet!''
   But an hour later, Sari and Roberto Ferraro, 12, were taking
turns fanning a sweating cameraman while Gabriel showed off his
five turtles and two newts to Marco Ferraro, 10.
   ``When I was in my school, they used to have fights because some
kids were white and some kids were black,'' said Sari. ``It's
stupid. You could be friends with white people if you're black.''
   Roberto looked at Sari and said, ``Me and her made good friends
already.''

<HEAD>Antarctic Ozone `Hole' May Raise Skin Cancer Risk Elsewhere, Study
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Antarctic ``ozone hole'' apparently caused
record low ozone levels over southern Australia in 1987, said
scientists, who suggested that the hole may raise skin cancer risk
in the globe's southern latitudes.
   The work is the first detailed study that links the Antarctic
hole to observed ozone declines in the Southern Hemisphere's
midlatitudes, where many people live, scientists said.
   The study concludes that record low ozone levels over southern
Australia and New Zealand were caused mainly by the arrival of
ozone-poor air from the Antarctic hole.
   Southern South America and the southern tip of Africa also may
be vulnerable, said study co-author R. Alan Plumb.
   A layer of ozone, a form of oxygen, high in the atmosphere
shields Earth from ultraviolet rays in sunlight that cause skin
cancer. Reductions in ozone let more rays through and can boost
skin cancer rates.
   The Antarctic ozone hole, which appears for a limited time every
year, is an area in which up to 50 percent of ozone disappears.
   Plumb said that while he regards the declines observed over
Australia and New Zealand as relatively small, they could become
more hazardous.
   But Margaret Kripke, an immunologist who studies skin cancer,
said the increase in ultravolet rays implied by the ozone
observations is ``enormous.''
   Such increases could raise the risk of skin cancer, but it is
difficult to say by how much, said Kripke, chairman of the
immunology department at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center of the
University of Texas.
   Protection of the worldwide ozone shield has become a focus of
international concern that extends beyond the Antarctic ozone hole.
Last year, for example, scientists announced evidence that ozone
had declined about 2.3 percent since 1969 over a region that
includes most of the United States.
   In May, delegates from 81 countries at a U.N. conference pledged
to stop producing and using chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons,
which destroy ozone, by the year 2000.
   The new study was conducted by Plumb of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology; Paul Newman, of the Universities Space
Research Association and a visiting scientist at the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Space Flight Center in
Greenbelt, Md.; and researchers from Australia and New Zealand.
   It appears today in the British journal Nature.
   ``It makes a convincing case to me,'' commented William Mankin
of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.
   The Antarctic ozone hole was unusual in 1987, the study said.
Ozone levels reached record lows in October and November, and the
funnel-shaped wind pattern that sustained the hole disintegrated in
early December rather than November.
   With the disintegration of the wind pattern each year, streams
of polar air are ripped away and migrate north, the researchers
said.
   They concluded that the arrival of such ozone-poor air was the
chief factor in producing record low ozone levels over southern
Australia and New Zealand in December 1987.
   The levels reported over the Australian cities Melbourne and
Perth for much of the month were the lowest December readings since
measurements began in 1979.
   The Melbourne readings averaged about 7 percent below normal for
the month, which theoretically could boost the dose of ultraviolet
rays at the Earth's surface by 14 percent, Plumb said.
   Newman said Australians are typically on the beaches in
December, the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. As a
result, low ozone readings during that month are particularly
worrisome.
   For the most common skin cancers, which develop only after
decades of exposure to ultraviolet rays, a single episode of ozone
reduction may not have much effect, said Kripke.
   But reductions would pose a hazard if they continue for another
decade or so, she said.
   Some recent studies suggest that the risk of the deadliest skin
cancer, melanoma, may be increased by a single exposure to excess
ultraviolet rays, Kripke noted. But too little is known about the
causes of melanoma to gauge the risk of a single summer's exposure,
she said.

   A White House official responding to
complaints that the Bush Administration is handing out plum
ambassadorial assignments as political payoffs says only one-third
of the president's embassy appointments are political.
   Although Bush's list of nominees contains the names of several
people who gave six-figure contributions to Republicans in the last
election, they were chosen on the basis of their qualifications,
White House spokesman B. Jay Cooper said Wednesday.
   Cooper said Secretary of State James A. Baker III is using a
formula to ensure that 67 percent of the appointments are career
government officers and 33 percent are political appointees.
   A greater percentage of political appointees exists because some
now serving are carryovers from the Reagan administration, when the
ratio was 60 percent career officers to 40 percent political
appointees, Cooper said.
   Some Bush appointments have raised a firestorm of criticism in
Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearings, where
some Democrats have complained that the appointees lack sufficient
qualifications beyond their financial and political connections.
   At least six of the people Bush appointed to ambassadorships
gave $100,000 or more to the Republican National Committee.

<NOTE>Bureau Says $14 Billion Spent on Child Care by Families with</NOTE>

   Working Moms
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Families with working mothers are spending $14
billion a year on child care, an expense that costs women in
poverty more than one-fifth of their income, the Census Bureau says.
   Of the 5.8 million women who reported making regular payments
for child care, the average weekly cost was $45.20, the bureau said
Wednesday. That amounted to about 6 percent of their income in 1986
when the study was conducted.
   While women living in poverty reported spending $32 a week for
child care, that amounted to 22 percent of their incomes, according
to the report.
   Women with incomes over $3,750 a month paid $58 a week for care,
4 percent of their income.
   The bureau's figures are to be published later this year as part
of a detailed analysis of child care arrangements across the
country. Preliminary material was released Wednesday for use by
congressional subcommittees debating legislation aimed at helping
families which need child care.
   Testimony presented to Congress has estimated child care costs
as ranging from about $2,500 annually to $6,000 in large cities.
The $45.20 weekly average calculated in the study would amount to
$2,305 per year.

<NOTE>HUD Collects $73,000 Owed by Estate and Widow of Sloppy Broker</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Buffalo, N.Y., office of the Department of
Housing and Urban Development has closed the case of Bernard S.
Brady, a one-time real estate broker who died owing the department
thousands of dollars.
   HUD has been reimbursed $72,970 owed by the Brady's widow and
estate, officials said Wednesday.
   Last week, a HUD lawyer collected a check for $24,831 from
Brady's estate and another for $48,139 from Manufacturer's and
Trader's Trust, where Brady had maintained a HUD escrow account,
the Buffalo HUD office said in a news release.
   ``Case closed,'' said Joseph Lynch, manager of the Buffalo HUD
office. ``Thanks to the cooperation of Mrs. Brady, Harold Fein (her
lawyer) and Robert Wilmers at M&amp;T, we have recouped HUD monies and
restored Bernie Brady's reputation.''
   The reimbursements came less than a month after The Associated
Press disclosed an internal HUD audit which showed Brady had
withheld payments, overbilled HUD and paid himself advances while
serving as a real estate broker and appraiser for the department.
   When Brady died of cancer in 1987, his widow, Maureen, wrote
$20,100 worth of checks on the account, according to the audit
obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.
   Lynch said he did not believe Brady's intent was criminal,
although the audit showed he sometimes double- and triple-billed
HUD for nonexistent wires of money to the U.S. Treasury.

<HEAD>Dollar Plunges, Stocks At New High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar closed sharply lower against the
Japanese yen in Tokyo on Thursday, while the key index on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange rose to a new high.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 269.45 points, or 0.78
percent, ending the day at 34,785.28.
   The dollar closed unchanged from its opening at 139.35 yen, down
2.08 yen from Wednesday's close of 141.43 yen. It ranged between
138.97 and 139.67 yen during the day.
   The dollar's plunge in Tokyo followed an overnight decline in
New York, where it fell after the U.S. Federal Reserve Board cut
its federal funds rate to 8.5 percent.
   The federal funds rate, directly controlled by the Federal
Reserve, is the interest on overnight loans between banks and
influences other interest rates throughout the economy.
   Traders said the market's general sentiment toward the dollar
was bearish, as market players predicted poor second-quarter U.S.
gross national product figures, due to be released in Washington
later Thursday.
   On the stock exchange, Nomura Securities analyst Yoshiro Inoue
said the yen's strength against the dollar reassured stock
investors and prompted buying.
   ``Market expectations of lower interest rates worldwide,
especially in the United States, also encouraged investors to buy
stocks,'' he said.

   Workers at Nissan's only U.S. plant today
wrapped up a vote to decide whether it will become the first fully
owned Japanese auto plant organized by the United Auto Workers.
   The vote for 2,400 of the plant's 3,100 workers followed an
18-month campaign and was the first on union representation since
production began in 1983. Labor observers said the election was
crucial to the UAW's future in organizing the other two Japanese
auto plants in the United States.
   ``I think we've got an excellent shot at it. We've done our
homework and we've provided people with the truth,'' said Gary
Grissham, a 33-year-old production technician who voted for the UAW.
   ``The company, of course, has done everything they could to keep
us out, but the union's already in the plant. It's just a matter of
getting us recognized,'' he said.
   But Chris Shelton, a quality inspector who has been with Nissan
for 6{ years, said most of his co-workers saw no need for union
representation.
   ``I think the UAW is going to be defeated soundly,'' he said
after voting to keep the plant non-union. ``If there are so many
people happy with the plant, how're they going to get any votes _
or least the number they need?''
   Voting began Wednesday and was to conclude early today. The
results were to be released by the National Labor Relations Board.
   Labor observers characterized the Nissan vote as pivotal for the
UAW.
   ``The vote's important because the UAW remains one of the
strongest _ if not the strongest _ labor unions in the United
States because it has complete coverage of GM, Ford and Chrysler.
And these new Japanese transplants _ the unorganized ones _
represent a threat to that power base,'' said Harry Katz, a labor
relations professor at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.

   Management at Nissan Motor Manufacturing U.S.A. plant, about 30
miles southeast of Nashville, maintained a low-profile public
stance in the final weeks of the campaign, refusing to discuss the
election with the media. But it matched the union blow for blow in
talking to the workers.
   While the UAW ran newspaper and radio ads, handed out leaflets
and went door-to-door to meet employees, the company aired videos
on in-plant televisions and held numerous rallies, including a
last-minute production Tuesday that shut down the assembly line for
more than an hour.
   Nissan focused on benefits it already offers, such as a
reduced-rate car leasing program and a 401K retirement plan, as
well as on a team concept in which workers rotate jobs as often as
every two hours.
   Union representatives have said Nissan's workers make about
$7,900 less a year in pay and benefits than their counterparts at
Ford Motor Co.
   Nissan has produced more than 1 million light pickup trucks and
Sentra cars since it opened the $760 million plant in June 1983,
and has the capacity to build 265,000 vehicles a year. A third
model is expected to be added in 1992.
   The union, which forced the vote by gathering petition
signatures from 33 percent of the Nissan production workers, made
safety the key issue of its campaign, claiming the plant's high
production pace has caused injuries to an estimated 18 percent of
its workers.
   The UAW said it doesn't know the exact percentage because the
company has refused to release injury logs in violation of state
law; Nissan has said such an action would violate employee
confidentiality rights and it's appealing a state order.
   Reflecting an overall decline in union strength, UAW membership
has fallen from more than 1.5 million in the late 1970s to about 1
million today. Hopes of stopping the decline rest largely with the
plants operated by Japanese automakers.
   The union represents workers in three joint Japanese-American
auto plants: Mazda Motor Manufacturing Corp., which also makes
Fords, at Flat Rock, Mich.; Diamond-Star Motors Corp., which makes
Chrysler and Mitsubishi models near Bloomington, Ill.; and New
United Motor Manufacturing Inc., which makes General Motors and
Toyota models at Fremont, Calif.
   Until the Nissan vote, the UAW had not held representation votes
at any of the three major unaffiliated Japanese plants in the
United States, including the Toyota plant at Georgetown, Ky., and
Honda's plant at Marysville, Ohio. An effort to organize the Honda
plant three years ago was discarded before a vote because of lack
of support.

   With the strength of his
arms and the power of his will, a paraplegic completed a weeklong
ascent of 3,200-foot El Capitan and said his climb proves the
disabled can accomplish great feats.
   Mark Wellman, accompanied by his friend Mike Corbett, reached
the summit at Wednesday afternoon, seven days and four hours after
they left the Yosemite Valley floor.
   A nationwide television audience saw them at the mountaintop,
and later the U.S. Senate passed a resolution commending them for
their ``extraordinary feat of bravery and stoutheartedness.''
   Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., disabled himself with a partially
paralyzed right arm, offered the resolution.
   ``My whole thing in life is finding another way to do it,
whether that be skiing, kayaking or whatever,'' said Wellman, a
29-year-old park ranger, at a news conference before dozens of
reporters, friends and fellow workers.
   Wellman said he performed the climb for personal achievement,
not for the disabled. But he said he hoped it would prove that
people need not be stopped by their physical disabilities.
   ``Go out and do it!'' said Wellman, who wore the same boots he
was wearing in 1982 when he fell 50 feet during a climb of
13,700-foot Gables Peak south of Yosemite. He was left paralyzed
from the waist down.
   He said his next adventure will be cross-country skiing using a
dog to pull him while he poles with his arms.
   Wellman became the first paraplegic to conquer El Capitan. The
vertical trek took an estimated 7,000 pull-ups, each advancing him
only six inches. He had trained six months for the ascent, making
35 practice climbs on other sheer rocks and training with weights.
   To climb El Capitan, Wellman and Corbett, 35, used modified cave
exploration equipment that allowed Wellman to pull himself up the
face of the cliff, using a T-bar device and ropes set by Corbett.
   Wellman and Corbett toted 200 pounds of food and gear including
hammocks that were suspended from hooks placed into the rock as
they slept.
   As they reached the summit, Corbett carried Wellman on his back
to a shady spot under a pine tree. The climbers were greeted by
their girlfriends, cheering friends and reporters.
   Soon, they were sipping champagne and gulping ice water.
   On the summit, set against a backdrop of views that included
towering peaks of the Sierra Nevada and Half Dome, they were almost
nonchalant.
   ``We didn't really have any scary moments doing this,'' said
Wellman.
   Their biggest problem was the wind, which Wellman said gusted
from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. each day, sometimes blowing them 10 feet out
from the cliff.
   He said the heat was less of a problem, but temperatures
occasionally soared to more than 100 degrees on the face of the
cliff.
   At the peak, he accepted a signed photograph of Yosemite from
Corbett, who wrote, ``It was an unbelievable experience.'' Corbett
has scaled El Capitan 42 times, more than any other climber.
   Wellman rode down from the mountain on a horse, talking with a
fellow ranger about everything except the climb.
   Corbett walked out briskly, leaving other hikers in his dust.
   He had something else on his mind.
   His family saw him in the televised coverage of the climb. It
was the first time they had seen him in years.
   They were to be reunited this weekend, with several family
members flying in from Houston.
   The anticipation distracted him from the climbing routine. He
said he was unable to sleep early Monday because of the memories.
   Corbett's girlfriend, Gwen Schneider, said Corbett last talked
to his family in 1981 after his parents were divorced.
   ``I've got to fill my family in on a lot of things that have
happened in the last 10 years of my life,'' Corbett said.

   An unexpected thrill
awaited tourists who visited a sunny Yosemite meadow surrounded by
soaring granite cliffs with El Capitan the grandest among them.
   Thanks to telescopes set up by a pair of public-spirited amateur
astronomers, hundreds of people on Wednesday got close-up views of
paraplegic Mark Wellman as he neared the finish of his historic
ascent to become the first paraplegic to climb one of the toughest
challenges climbers face.
   Five telescopes and a powerful pair of field glasses, all
mounted on tripods, were set up in the meadow and trained on
Wellman and his climbing companion, Mike Corbett.
   Struggling to the top nearly a mile from the people in the
meadow, the climbers were practically invisible to the naked eye
but seemed perhaps 50 yards away when viewed through a 10-inch
telescope built by Jim Baumgardt, an electronics worker from
Burlingame, Calif.
   ``That is neat. That is really neat,'' said Alisa Hunter of
Charlotte, N.C., after watching Wellman and Corbett.
   Another spectator waiting for a telescope to become available
stared up at the imposing monolith 3,200 feet above the floor of
Yosemite Valley and said softly: ``Oh, my goodness.''
   Up to 20 people at a time stood in lines waiting for a chance to
gaze at the two men hanging from ropes and struggling upward.
   ``He was hanging on the rock, and all of a sudden slipped off,''
said wide-eyed 11-year-old Tony Beckett of Bakersfield, Calif.,
after watching one of the climbers.``He was swinging back and
forth.''
   After peering through the telescope, park concession worker
Casey Johnson called the climb ``pretty amazing.''
   His companion, Leena Conway, said they and other co-workers of
Wellman, a park ranger, are ``really proud that he's doing that.''
   The idea to set up their star-gazing equipment for the public
occurred Tuesday night to Baumgardt and William Phelps, vice
president of the Peninsula Astronomical Society's vice president
who lives in Palo Alto.
   ``I saw it on TV last night and thought `I have the equipment;
this is really neat, and I'd like to see it,''' Baumgardt said.

   Villagers scampered on rooftops and
flash floods slammed cars against buildings as heavy rains soaked
the southern coast, killing dozens of people and leaving 50,000
homeless, officials said today.
   The National Disaster Center in Seoul reported 55 confirmed
deaths and 48 people missing during three days of torrential rains,
but said communcations to remote areas were cut off and predicted
the official death toll would rise.
   Newspapers and television stations reported at least 140 people
either dead or missing. They estimated the total property damage at
$70 million.
   Some villages, drenched with 17.6 inches of rain over three
days, were virtually submerged and television footage showed only
the tops of tile roofs surrounded by water.
   Relief officials fear that Typhoon Judy, with winds of about 57
mph, would add to the carnage already caused by seasonal rains. The
storm was expected to hit the southern areas today.
   President Roh Tae-woo ordered all available military helicopters
and other equipment mobilized for rescues and flood control. Prime
Minister Kang Young-hoon inspected the flood-stricken areas today.
   The hardest-hit area was South Cholla, where 34 people were
reported dead and 35 missing, disaster center officials said,
speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with South Korean
practice.
   In the provincial capital of Kwangju, 12 people were reported
dead and four missing, they said. Most of the victims were killed
in landslides or drowned in rain-swollen creeks or rivers, they
said.
   Korean television showed pictures of people waiting on rooftops
for rescue, and others in chest-deep floodwaters carrying children
on their shoulders. Raging waters lifted cars and trucks like toys
and slammed them against bridges and buildings.
   The U.S. military command in Seoul said several American
helicopters were mobilized to rescue 66 Korean villagers stranded
in the flooding in Kwangju and Sachon. U.S. soldiers also used
boats and fire engines to help evacuate flood victims or pump
water, it said.
   Most of the homeless were taken to schools, churches and other
makeshift shelters and the government rushed in blankets, food and
other relief supplies, the officials said.

<HEAD>Chernobyl Doctor: High-Tech Medicine Can't Cope with Nuclear Disasters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The failure of high-tech medicine to save some
Chernobyl radiation victims is a reminder of doctors' limited
ability to cope with nuclear disasters, a U.S. physician says.
   In a report in today's New England Journal of Medicine, U.S. and
Soviet doctors described their attempts to use transplants to
restore victims' radiation-damaged bone marrow. Of 13 men given
marrow transplants, only two survived.
   ``It should be a clear lesson to everybody that no matter how
sophisticated we get, there are going to be serious limitations,''
said Dr. Robert Peter Gale, a University of California, Los
Angeles, physician who led a four-member U.S. transplant team to
the Soviet Union after Chernobyl.
   ``Nobody should think that doctors are going to bail them out of
any misuse of nuclear devices,'' he said.
   The report was written by Gale, Dr. Alexandr Baranov of Clinical
Hospital 6 in Moscow and 15 other physicians who took part in
caring for Chernobyl victims.
   Gale said he considered the publication itself to be ``a major
diplomatic achievement.''
   ``A joint Soviet-American report of a Soviet nuclear accident
being published in an American journal is extraordinary,'' he said
in an interview. ``This could never have happened three years ago.''
   At least 29 people died after an explosion and fire in 1986 at
the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Soviet Union released a
cloud of radioactive material.
   Since Chernobyl, blood cell growth hormones have become
available, and Gale has used them to treat nuclear mishaps in
Brazil and El Salvador.
   Experience gained in the combination of growth hormones and
marrow transplants ``gives us a very sensible strategy for treating
victims of nuclear accidents,'' Gale said.
   High doses of radiation destroy tissue in the bone marrow that
makes new blood cells. This leaves victims at high risk of
infection and other medical problems.
   Gale said that after the Chernobyl accident, doctors treated 499
people, and 202 of them had serious radiation injuries. Thirteen
people exposed to total body doses ranging from 560 to 1,340 rads
of radiation were given bone marrow transplants in an effort to
restore their bodies' ability to make blood cells.
   A rad is a measurement of radiation. Gale said that those with
exposures below 200 rads can be treated with transfusions and
antibiotics, while people with exposures between 200 and 800 rads
can probably be saved with blood cell growth factors.
   At higher radiation levels, he said, ``you won't have enough
remaining bone marrow cells to stimulate with these factors, and
you are going to have to consider transplantation, pretty much in
the way we did'' after Chernobyl.
   The two who survived after the bone marrow operations found that
their bodies eventually rejected the transplanted tissue. Gale said
this shows that transplants can keep people alive until their own
bone marrow recovers.
   Most of the rest died of severe burns and other damage caused by
radiation.
   ``I am disappointed, because we invested such a huge amount in
these cases,'' said Gale. ``You want everyone to live. But this is
not designed to rescue people dying of non-bone marrow failure.''
   Gale has since used blood cell growth factors on people who came
in contact with radioactive cesium 137 that was removed from a
partly demolished cancer treatment center in Brazil and on people
accidentally exposed to cobalt 60 at a sterilization plant in El
Salvador.
   These natural hormones, which are produced through gene
splicing, can prompt the remaining bone marrow cells to work
harder, producing more blood cells.
   In an accompanying editorial in the journal, Drs. Christine K.
Cassel of the University of Chicago and Jennifer Leaning of Harvard
said the latest work ``adds greatly to our knowledge of the
management of acute radiation injury.''

<HEAD>Bloch May Remain Free a Long Time During Search for Compromised Secrets</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Adds 5 grafs at end with comments from Bloch's daughter.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Felix S. Bloch, the U.S. diplomat suspected of
spying, could remain free for a long time while FBI agents conduct
a daunting hunt to identify specific secrets he may have turned
over to the Soviets.
   The specific evidence required by the Espionage Act could take a
long time to find, if it's found at all, government sources said
Wednesday night, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   At the same time, FBI agents continue to search _ well out of
the public eye _ for circumstantial evidence that might persuade
Bloch to confess, if he is a spy.
   The Bloch case, with reporters and television cameras trailing
the 54-year-old diplomat through the streets, may look unusual to
the public.
   But the unusual element is the publicity at this stage.
Otherwise, it's like most spy investigations.
   ``Actually, it's not uncommon at all'' for targets to roam free
while agents ``sweat bullets'' and painstakingly comb secret
documents, bank records, tax returns, airline tickets and hotel
receipts, said former FBI spy hunter James Nolan in an interview.
   Bloch was put on paid leave by the State Department on June 22,
the same day the FBI first tried to interview him. State Department
security officers had talked with him earlier.
   His diplomatic passport was lifted but his travel was not
restricted. He was put under obvious 24-hour FBI surveillance,
designed to discourage him from flight.
   Last Friday, a leaked news report brought his situation to
public attention.
   Nolan, who disclaimed any knowledge of Bloch's case, said what
the public is seeing now is identical to what has gone on without
publicity in countless earlier spy investigations. Other suspects
have walked free for weeks or longer after making a confession
before there was an arrest.
   Nolan, who retired in 1988 from his post as ambassador in charge
of the State Department's Office of Foreign Missions, spent 20
years catching spies for the FBI, rising to deputy chief of the
bureau's intelligence division.
   Some observers have suggested the unusual publicity in Bloch's
case is designed to pressure him into a confession. But Nolan said,
``It's a lot easier to make an arrest outside the glare of
publicity.''
   After the first leak, the State Department confirmed the FBI was
investigating Bloch for ``illegal activities'' involving ``agents
of a foreign intelligence service.''
   But the Justice Department, as usual, has said nothing and is
reported to be upset that State said so much.
   A few details of the government's evidence have leaked from
unnamed sources: There is a videotape of Bloch passing a mystery
briefcase to a Soviet agent in Paris and the same agent later was
monitored giving Bloch what sounded like a telephone warning that
he was under suspicion.
   If the government actually knows that much, why hasn't it
arrested Bloch?
   Nolan said U.S. espionage law requires proof that national
security information was given to a foreign power with intent to
harm the national defense.
   Nolan said courts would accept any classified document or data
as a violation but the government has to show specifically at least
one item that was turned over.
   Government sources say the government does not know what was in
the briefcase Bloch handed over. They say if the material was
classified it would be easy to prove intent to harm because Bloch,
like all diplomats, has been trained that the classification system
is designed to protect national security.
   Even spies who confess aren't necessarily arrested right away.
Why?
   Because ultimately a suspect's attorney may try to have the
confession thrown out so agents must prove it will stand up in
court.
   ``He's told you he's an agent and he's been paid,'' Nolan said.
``You have to go find a specific classified document he turned over
and someone in the government who will testify in court that it is
classified.''
   And when there's merely a suspicious contact with a foreign
agent but no confession?
   ``You've got an even longer case,'' Nolan said.
   ``Most spies get paid,'' he said. ``If they don't confess, you
go through their bank accounts trying to find every honest dollar
they made and then through their expenditures and their tax
returns, trying to prove that their net worth shows they've been
making $500,000 or $50,000 in unaccounted for income.
   ``That takes an awful long time.''
   The goal in this effort is to build to a face-to-face interview
``where you can lever the suspect into a confession,'' Nolan said.
   In a related development, Bloch's daughter told the New York
Post in an interview in today's editions that Ronald Lauder begged
her father to stay on at his post at the U.S. Embassy in Austria
when Bloch was planning to leave three years ago.
   ``In 1986, my father was ready to leave Austria _ he had already
been in Vienna six years _ but Lauder wanted my father to stay
on,'' Andrea Bloch, 26, who works at an art gallery, told the Post.
``And now Lauder is using my father to try to promote his candidacy
for mayor, and it kills me.''
   Lauder, heir to the Estee Lauder cosmetics fortune and a
Republican mayoral candidate, was appointed U.S. Ambassador to
Austria in 1986.
   Bloch served under Lauder in Vienna from 1980 to 1987. Lauder
says he fired Bloch for insubordination; the Foreign Service says
it was time for Bloch to come back to Washington anyway.
   A Lauder spokesman, Nelson Warfield, called Miss Bloch's
assertion that Lauder begged Bloch to stay ``ludicrous.''

   A South Korean DC-10 with 182 people
aboard crashed Thursday as the jetliner was about to land at
Tripoli airport in Libya, the official Libyan news agency JANA
reported.
   There was no word on deaths.
   JANA, monitored in Nicosia, said there were more than 80
survivors including the plane's captain. It said the jet crashed on
a runway after hitting two houses and several cars.
   In Seoul, South Korea, the Korean Broadcasting System said the
plane had reported engine trouble and crash-landed about three
miles short of the runway.
   JANA said the jet was on a scheduled flight from Seoul to
Tripoli and that the crash occurred at 7:30 a.m. (1:30 a.m. EDT).
   KBS said passengers included 181 Koreans, 10 foreigners and 15
crew members. It said many of the Koreans were workers for Daewoo
Corp. and Donga Construction Co. which have projects in Libya.
   There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy between
the KBS and JANA reports.
   A United Air Lines DC-10 crashed in Sioux City, Iowa, last week,
killing 111 people. It had lost its tail engine and had hydraulic
problems.
   In Seoul, Korean Air officials confirmed the plane was down, but
had no details and said a passenger list was unavailable.
   Korean Air is a privately owned national flag carrier and the
largest of two Korean airlines.
   Formerly known as Korean Air Lines, it is known for its Flight
007, which Soviet fighter planes shot down over Soviet air space on
Sept. 1, 1983, killing 269 people.
   On Nov. 29, 1987, 115 people died when a Korean Air flight from
Baghdad, Iraq, to Seoul was lost over the Andaman Sea near Burma.
   South Korea charged North Korea with placing a bomb on the plane
and a self-confessed North Korean agent was sentenced to death in
connection with the incident earlier this year.

<HEAD>Wealthy More Likely than Poor to Have Caesareans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman's chance of having a Caesarean section
depends more on the size of her bank account than on the difficulty
of her labor, a report today shows.
   Many physicians believe Caesareans are far too widely used, and
the doctor who directed the research said one reason wealthy women
receive them most often may be because of doctors' fear of lawsuits.
   The surgical form of birth is intended for cases where vaginal
birth is difficult or hazardous to the baby. But over the past two
decades, the number of Caesareans has quadrupled, making it the
most common operation in the United States.
   ``The most surprising thing is that one expects poor people to
have many more health problems than rich people,'' said Dr. Jeffrey
B. Gould. ``They have more low birth weight infants and more
neonatal mortality. The notion that rich people are having more
Caesarean sections than poor people is a topsy-turvy finding.''
   Gould directed the research, which was based on the birth
certificates of 245,854 infants born in Los Angeles County in 1982
and 1983. It was published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   Physicians typically receive bigger fees for Caesareans than for
vaginal births, but Gould said, ``The very simplistic reason that
the rich are rich, and the doctors want to make money is a minor
part of the picture.''
   Instead, the wealthy may be more likely to demand or receive
Caesareans if minor problems arise, because their doctors fear
these patients will take them to court if the baby is less than
perfect when born vaginally.
   In contrast, he said, poor people are more likely to give birth
at big teaching hospitals, where they are cared for by resident
physicians. These young doctors are closely supervised and often
are determined to limit Caesareans to cases in which they are truly
necessary.
   Dr. Benjamin Sachs of Boston's Beth Israel Hospital said, ``A
woman's chances of having a vaginal delivery are in part dependent
on how her obstetrical care is provided.''
   He noted that a wealthy woman is more likely to have a private
physician who ``bounces back and forth'' between his office and the
labor room. In teaching hospitals and health maintenance
organizations, one doctor is typically assigned full time to labor
and delivery, ``so whether she delivers or not, there is no
pressure.''
   Sachs said that because their doctors use Caesareans more
sparingly, poor women may be getting better care than affluent
women.
   Gould's study compared Caesarean rates based on the income of
the neighborhoods where women lived. It found that 23 percent of
pregnant women from areas where family incomes averaged more than
$30,000 received Caesareans, compared with 13 percent of those who
came from places where families made less than $11,000.
   The differences could not be explained by the women's race,
ethnic background, age, number of previous births or the weight of
their babies.
   ``It's a very striking difference,'' said Gould. ``It occurs in
all ethnic groups.''
   Whites were most apt to have Caesareans, and Mexican-Americans
were the least likely, but the Caesarean rate rose steadily with
increasing income in all racial and ethnic groups.
   For instance, 16 percent of black women from areas with income
below $11,000 had Caesareans, compared with 26 percent of blacks
from neighborboods above $30,000.

   The dollar plunged against the Japanese yen today,
while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index rose sharply to a new
high.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 269.45 points, or 0.78
percent, closing at 34,785.28. It had lost 23.07 points Wednesday.
   The dollar closed at 139.35 yen, down 2.08 yen from Wednesday's
141.43-yen close. It also opened at 139.35, and moved between
138.97 yen and 139.67 yen.
   The dollar now has lost 3.00 yen in two days.
   Dealers attributed the stock index's rise largely to the yen's
strength against the dollar.
   Kazuhiro Nomura, a dealer with New Japan Securities Co., said,
``The yen's strength to the 139-yen level mainly reassured Japanese
investors and encouraged them to buy issues.''
   ``Also, interest rates are moving lower, which is becoming a
worldwide economic trend,'' he said.
   ``Especially, a slowdown in the U.S. economy is becoming
obvious,'' Nomura said, citing the Federal Reserve Board's federal
funds rate cut to 8.5 percent.
   In currency dealings, the dollar's decline in Tokyo followed a
plunge on overseas markets overnight. Lower U.S. interest rates
make the dollar less attractive to foreign investors.
   Masafumi Koyama, a trader with the Bank of Tokyo, said market
players in Tokyo were mainly making position adjustments and
trading was not active. He said the market was awaiting the release
of U.S. second quarter gross national product figures in Washington
later today.

   An Israeli travel company says the Soviet Union
has agreed to let it process tourist visas, opening the door for
Israeli tourists to that country for the first time in 22 years.
   The Natour company reached agreement with the official Soviet
travel agency Intourist to process visas and organize group and
individual tours to the country, Mior Caspi, the company's
director-general, said on Israel radio.
   ``It's a breakthrough. They want to receive Israeli groups and
they want it to be done in an orderly manner,'' Caspi said in a
radio interview Wednesday. He said Natour represents 270 travel
agencies in Israel.
   Moscow cut diplomatic relations with Jerusalem following the
1967 Middle East war, but ties between the two countries have grown
warmer in recent years.
   Although the two countries exchanged low-level consular
delegations in 1987, Israelis have been barred from visiting the
Soviet Union except as part of certain delegations or with official
permission to visit sick relatives.
   ``You can see this as part of the whole political picture. The
situation is improving,'' Foreign Ministry Spokesman Alon Liel said
today when asked about the travel agreement.
   Caspi said the agreement was 1{ years in the making and that
three tours already have been organized for the fall.

   The Federal Aviation Administration is being
asked to investigate whether scrap parts were used in the engine of
the United Airlines DC-10 that crashed last week.
   The plane crash-landed at Sioux City, Iowa, killing 111 people.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of a House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee that oversees such investigations, asked the
FAA on Wednesday to look into the possibility that General Electric
Co. used scrap parts purchased from Kelly Air Force Base in San
Antonio.
   GE said the parts of the DC-10 engine being investigated could
not have come from the Kelly scrap yard. GE manufactures the TF-39
engine that powers the Air Force's C-5A, as well as the similarly
designed CF-6 engine that powers the commercial DC-10 and the
Boeing 747.
   The Air Force routinely throws away engine blades and turbine
nozzles that may be good, repairable or unusable, and Dingell
explained that ``this cornucopia of blades and parts were all going
into the disposal, or scrap yard at Kelly Air Force Base.''
   Investigators for the General Accounting Office found as early
as November 1986 that GE and other contractors ``purchased
condemned Air Force TF-39 engine parts because they were identical
to commercial CF-6 engine parts used to power the DC-10,'' Dingell
said.
   Dingell's letter to new FAA Administrator James B. Busey IV was
first reported on by CBS News and later was made available by an
aide. It asked for a response by Aug. 4.
   Dingell noted that he had first warned former FAA Administrator
Donald Engen in 1986 that scrapped parts might be used in new
engines.
   GE spokesman David Lane said in Cincinnati: ``The part of the
CF-6 engine being investigated ... including the fan section, does
not employ TF-39 parts. Those parts are totally different and are
not compatible.''
   The fan section disintegrated, and investigators believe
shrapnel-like debris severed hydraulic lines, making the DC-10
almost impossible to control.
   Ted Lopatkiewicz, spokesman for the National Transportation
Safety Board, said the investigation is not focusing on any one
area.
   ``We're investigating this in a number of areas and we will be
analyzing all the wreckage very thoroughly. We are trying to
recover as much of the engine as we can and we will analyze the
wreckage of that engine,'' said Lopatkiewicz.
   Federal investigators have removed the engine from the tail
section of the plane and plan to take it to the GE plant near
Cincinnati, where it was built, to try to determine why United's
fan section disintegrated.
   NTSB investigator Jack Young arrived at the GE plant in
Evendale, Ohio, on Wednesday to review GE's manufacturing and
maintenance records for the rear engine, which was built in 1972.
All three of the engines on the DC-10 that crashed in Iowa were
built at the plant.
   GE manufactured the engine from 1971 to 1981 and the engine
established a record of reliability during 17 million flight hours
in commercial service, said GE spokesman Dwight Weber.

<HEAD>Main Defendant in McMartin Preschool Case Denies He Molested Children</HEAD>

   The chief defendant in the McMartin preschool
molestation trial took the stand more than five years after he was
charged and testified he never sexually abused children at the
school.
   ``Never,'' Raymond Buckey responded adamantly Wednesday as his
attorney asked whether he had ever sexually molested the toddlers
who attended the now-defunct Manhattan Beach school.
   Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62, are
charged with 64 counts of molestation and a shared count of
conspiracy.
   Now in its 27th month, the trial is the nation's longest-running
trial. The case has been in the court system for five years.
   In a soft voice, Buckey repeatedly answered ``No'' when his
attorney asked if he had exposed himself to children, engaged in
oral copulation with children, threatened children with harm,
killed animals, caused children to bleed or played ``naked games''
at the preschool.
   Buckey said that one child who accused him of molesting her had
attended the nursery school before he ever worked there.
   ``The preliminary hearing is the first time I ever saw (her) in
my life,'' he testified.
   Outside court, Buckey told reporters, ``I'm glad to finally be
up there telling my side of the story.''
   He said he wasn't worried about being cross-examined by the
prosecutor.
   ``I have the truth behind me,'' he said.
   Asked why small children would tell of molestations if they
never occurred, Buckey said: ``I think adults have had a lot of
influence on these children. That's where it's coming from.''
   Buckey's lawyer, Danny Davis, predicted his client would spend a
month on the witness stand fighting the charges which kept him in
jail for five years until he was released on $1.5 million bail last
February. Buckey was to resume his testimony today.
   Five of the original defendants had charges against them
dismissed after a two-year preliminary hearing, leaving Buckey and
his mother to face trial.
   The prosecution called 61 witnesses including nine children who
said they were raped, sodomized or forced into oral copulation.
Children told bizarre tales of being forced to play games in the
nude and of being sexually abused. They also said animals were
tortured to terrify them into compliance.
   Buckey, tanned and clad in a dark blue sport jacket and khaki
slacks, told jurors he worked as an aide to teachers at the
preschool from 1981 until the end of summer 1983, when it was first
alleged that he had molested children.
   He was arrested in August 1983 and released when charges were
dropped. He was rearrested March 22, 1984.
   On Wednesday, he denied ever touching a child's genitals except
with a washcloth when he helped them clean up after bathroom
accidents. Buckey said he didn't produce child pornography and has
never seen any. He also denied using animals to scare children.
   The defense, in its ninth month of presentation, has featured
testimony from former teachers and students from the preschool;
they said they never saw children molested.
   Mrs. Buckey has said she never did anything improper and
believed her son was innocent.
   Superior Court Judge William Pounders Pounders said recently he
saw no end to the trial before 1990.
   He has voiced concerns about the toll the case has taken on
jurors and on the possibility of a mistrial if more jurors are
excused. The trial started with 12 jurors and six alternates. Only
one alternate remains.

   Syrian and Christian forces waged a
devastating artillery duel across Beirut during the night, killing
28 people and wounding 80, police said. Four died when rockets
crashed into a home for the elderly.
   The latest casualties raised the overall casualty toll to 481
killed and 1,949 wounded in the 19-week confrontation between Gen.
Michel Aoun's Christian forces and Syrian army gunners in Beirut
and the surrounding mountains.
   It was the heaviest shelling since March 14, when 39 people were
killed and 96 wounded.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said casualties were higher in Syrian-policed Moslem
west Beirut than in the city's eastern Christian sector.
   Voice of the Homeland, the most popular Moslem radio station,
called on those who ``control the machine of steel and fire to stop
the massacre at any cost.''
   The police spokesman said it was ``impossible'' to determine who
started the bombardment. He noted it was ``the fiercest ever''
artillery attack by Aoun's gunners against the Syrians.
   The Christian-Syrian confrontation began March 8 after Aoun
blockaded ports operated by Moslem militias south of Beirut. The
Syrians and their militia allies retaliated by shelling the
Christian enclave north of the city.
   Shells today tore gaping holes in apartment buildings,
triggering hundreds of fires that blazed out of control because a
power outage left the fire brigade without water.
   Thuds from exploding shells and the whooshing sound of rockets
echoed around the city during an eight-hour duel that subsided into
intermittent exchanges at 3:30 a.m.
   A police spokesman said shells and rockets rained on residential
areas at the rate of 60 per minute. Radio stations interrupted
programs to urge civilians to take shelter underground.
   Five rockets fired from east Beirut scored direct hits on a
Moslem home for the elderly in west Beirut, killing four elderly
people and wounding three, the spokesman said.
   The four major hospitals in west Beirut also evacuated patients
to underground shelters as shells and rockets crashed into almost
every single street, the spokesman said.
   Smoke billowed from several gutted buildings and debris and
glass shards carpeted streets as anxious residents emerged from
bomb shelters to inspect their property.
   Hundreds of cars crushed in the barrage littered west Beirut's
Kantari district. A middle-aged woman, tears in her eyes, called on
Allah to ``punish the criminals who caused this catastrophe.
   ``May Allah's wrath fall on all the combatants. They get paid to
kill us or ruin our property,'' she shouted, watched by a Syrian
soldier manning a nearby sandbagged position.
   The police spokesman said Aoun's gunners, entrenched in the
310-square-mile Christian enclave, pounded Syrian army positions in
west Beirut and the mountains southeast of the capital.
   Aoun's forces, the spokesman said, also blasted the eastern
Bekaa valley, aiming at Syrian army supply routes from Damascus.
   Syria keeps about 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab
League peacekeeping mandate. But the Christians contend the Syrians
betrayed the mandate by siding with the Moslems in the 14-year-old
civil war and should leave.
   The Lebanese Forces right-wing Christian militia, allied with
Aoun, fired more than 40 rockets a minute from BM-21
multi-barrelled launchers against residential districts in west
Beirut and other Moslem sectors, the police spokesman said.
   The Moslem Voice of the Nation said the militia gunners used
phosphorous ammunition in rocketing west Beirut ``to plant fire and
death wherever they explode.''
   The Christian Voice of Lebanon said damage also was extensive in
the Christian heartland, especially in east Beirut's Ashrafiyeh
residential district.
   An Ashrafiyeh resident, speaking on condition he not be named,
said Lebanese Forces militiamen toured east Beirut in cars fitted
with loudspeakers shortly before the shelling began late Wednesday,
urging people to stay underground overnight.
   ``It was strange because at the time they advised us to rush to
shelters there was no shelling,'' he said, without elaborating.
   The escalation coincided with a statement issued in Rabat, the
Moroccan capital, that the foreign ministers of Morocco, Saudi
Arabia and Algeria are to meet there Saturday to assess their
efforts to end the 14-year-old civil war in Lebanon.

   Blood samples taken from the pilot who survived a
crash in the Bahamas show no trace of alcohol or drugs, federal
investigators said.
   The blood test produced no answers to what happened to the
Alexandria, Va., communications attorney before his single-engine
plane ended an 800-mile odyssey on autopilot with a spectacular
watery crash July 13.
   Root, 36, checked out of Hollywood's Memorial Hospital Monday
after being treated for wounds left by a bullet passing through his
midsection and arm.
   ``Verbal reports from the laboratory indicate that the alcohol
and basic drugs are negative,'' said Andrew Alston, an air safety
investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board.
   Alston said Wednesday that results are still unavailable on the
small section of Root's intestine that was removed during surgery.
But Dr. Robert Cohen, Root's surgeon, said Tuesday that test
results he has seen on the specimen are not specific enough to help
investigators.
   Blood tests for carbon monoxide were also negative, which
authorities said ruled out carbon monoxide poisoning for Root's
claim that he lost consciousness while piloting the plane.
   The timing of the shooting is still unknown because Root has
told investigators he has no recollection of it.
   Root's flight from Washington's National Airport to Rocky Mount,
N.C., was normal until air traffic controllers radioed him to say
he was flying past his destination.
   The pilot reported he had difficulty breathing and chest pains.
Military pilots who followed his Cessna 210 over the Atlantic
reported seeing the pilot slumped at the controls but said his head
and the plane's sun visor moved several times.
   Root has acknowledged keeping a loaded revolver in the plane's
glove compartment. Relatives speculated the .32-caliber Smith &amp;
Wesson may have gone off an impact, but the manufacturer discounted
that idea.
   The U.S. attorney's office is reviewing information on Root
gathered by the FBI since the shooting and crash, but has refused
public comment.

   The dollar fluctuated in a narrow range this
morning in thin European trading as traders waited for U.S. second
quarter gross national product figures to be released.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   Foreign exchange dealers said activity in the dollar market was
thin because many investors were on vacation, and those present
were waiting for the 8:30 a.m. EDT release of the U.S. economic
growth data.
   ``This is your typical summer market,'' an analyst in Milan
said. ``It's the most dangerous kind of market because it can be
very volatile.''
   In London, the British pound rose against the dollar. One
British pound fetched $1.6582, compared with $1.6455 late Wednesday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 2.08 Japanese yen to a closing 139.35
yen. Later, in London, it was lower at 139.22 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.8703 Deutsche marks, down from 1.8735
   _1.6100 Swiss francs, down from 1.6115
   _6.3348 French francs, down from 6.3475

   Gold opened at a bid price of $373.75 a troy ounce in London,
and bullion dealers later fixed a recommended price of $374.30.
Both prices were higher than late Wednesday's $373.25.
   In Zurich, gold traded at $374.25, down from $374.50 bid late

   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.43 to a closing bid of

   Thunderstorms brought heavy rain and hail to the Southeast and
parts of Appalachia while a heat wave broke records from New
England to Minnesota.
   Hail nearly 1 inch in diameter fell Wednesday at Douglasville,
Ga., and three-quarter inch hail fell at Moorefield, W.Va. Smaller
hail fell elsewhere in those states and in South Carolina and
Alabama.
   In West Virginia, more than 2 inches of rain fell in a 30-minute
period at Petersburg, where storm winds caused damage, and
Moorfield received a little more than 1 inch of rain in a half
hour. Heavy rain also deluged the Atlanta area, where 1{ inches
fell in a half hour.
   Thunderstorm winds also caused damage near Breezewood, Pa., and
at Kennesaw, Ga.
   Showers and thunderstorms also fell in portions of New England,
from southern New York state across South Carolina, over the Ohio
Valley, the upper Great Lakes, the central and northern Plains,
southern Florida, western Montana, Idaho, northeast Nevada, Utah,
Arizona, northern New Mexico and southeast Colorado, and from
western Georgia across Oklahoma and Texas.
   Warm air over the Northeast and north-central states set or tied
high temperature records in at least eight cities, including
Alpena, Mich., where a high of 94 broke a 19-year-old record by 2
degrees, and Portland, Maine, where the high of 95 broke a mark set
in 1963 by 1 degree.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms in much of
eastern Texas, from New England across the Great Lakes and upper
Ohio Valley, and scattered from central Arizona across southern
Colorado and over western Montana.
   Highs were expected to be in the upper 60s and 70s along the
coast of Washington and northern Oregon; the 70s along the southern
coast of California, around San Francisco, at higher elevations of
central Arizona and southern Colorado; the low 80s in northern New
Mexico and the Texas Panhandle; to near 110 degrees through the
Desert Southwest; and the upper 80s and 90s in much of the rest of
the nation.

   Federal environmental officials said
they are closing in on who was responsible for illegally dumping
chemical wastes in an area later developed as a mobile home park.
   Residents, meanwhile, expressed outrage Wednesday night at
federal plans to temporarily relocate them. They argued for a
better monetary aid package and a permanent relocation plan.
   The chemicals, believed to be cancer-causing industrial
compounds, were identified in a federal report released Tuesday.
Government officials have since advised residents of the Forest
Glen trailer park to leave their homes.
   David Payne, an Environmental Protection Administration
enforcement official, said authorities have identified several
chemical companies in Niagara Falls and a defunct trucking company
that may have been responsible for dumping chemicals in the
neighborhood over 10 years beginning in the early 1970s.
   Payne said one of the companies under investigation is
Occidental Chemical Corp. Earlier this year, a federal judge found
Occidental partly responsible for toxic contamination at nearby
Love Canal, which was declared a national environmental disaster 10
years ago.
   ``We have a list of companies and we're questioning each one,''
Payne said Wednesday. ``We're narrowing it down.''
   More than 90 trailer park residents met with federal officials
Wednesday night to hear a proposal for relocation aid.
   The government has offered to relocate residents temporarily
while attempts are made to get the site on a federal Superfund
priority list for cleanup. Officials said it could take as little
as two months to get on the Superfund list.
   Many spoke against the government's plan.
   ``Why can't you declare an emergency like they did in Love Canal
and move us out immediately?'' asked resident Robert Barclay.
   ``It's too long to wait. It's too much of a disruption for the
family. You don't realize what you're putting us through,'' said
resident Terry Freirmuth.
   Robert Salkie, an EPA official, urged residents to make the best
of the offer to relocate.
   ``It is dangerous to live at Forest Glen,'' Salkie said.
   The EPA announced Tuesday that chemicals in the soil and
groundwater beneath the trailer park endangered the health of the
51 families in the neighborhood.
   Barclay and others also complained about the government's
monetary offer _ three months' rent for those who move temporarily.
   ``My wife and I can't afford it. We're on Social Security,''
Barclay said.
   The federal Emergency Management Agency also will provide food
and utility stipends for relocating residents and in some cases pay
for rental insurance and the cost of kenneling pets, said
spokeswoman Gerald Connolly.
   Paying mortgages on homes in the Forest Glen neighborhood will
remain the responsibility of the owners, he said.
   Officials said the amount of aid will depend on the number of
family members. A family of four would receive $637 in housing
assistance.
   Payne said officials identified chemical contamination in the
neighborhood as early as April 1987 but had trouble identifying the
chemicals and establishing whether they were hazardous.
   ``These aren't the common chemicals,'' he said.
   The chemicals include aniline, phenothiazine, benzothiazole,
mercaptobenzothiazole and polyaromatic hydrocarbons.

<TEXT>
   A court today convicted Carl Gustav
Christer Pettersson, a 42-year-old career criminal and drug abuser,
of the 1986 murder of Prime Minister Olof Palme and sentenced him
to life in prison.
   The conviction ended one of the most closely watched trials in
Sweden and capped the country's largest criminal investigation.
   Stockholm District Court handed down the guilty verdict after 17
days of deliberations and drafting of the legal judgement.
Pettersson, a Swede, was given the most severe penalty possible.
Sweden has no death penalty.
   The government normally commutes life terms to 20 years or
fewer. Sweden has one of the world's most lenient penal systems.
   Palme, a four-term prime minister and an international leader in
social democratic politics, was shot in the back outside a downtown
Stockholm movie theater while walking home unguarded with his wife.
   The killer fled down a dark side steet.
   The two judges who served as jurists on the eight-member panel
voted for acquittal, saying there was not enough hard evidence to
convict Pettersson for the slaying on Feb. 28, 1986. They were
overruled, however, by the six other jurors. Only a majority of
jurors was needed to convict.
   Pettersson was also convicted of endangering the life of Palme's
wife Lisbeth, who was slightly injured in the shooting. She was a
key witness in the case.
   ``Lisbeth Palme has, without a doubt and with great certainty,
pointed out Christer Pettersson as the man who was at the Dekorima
Shop and who was determined to be the assailant,'' said the jury's
written decision.
   The Dekorima Shop is an art supply store at the intersection
where the shooting occurred.
   However, Michael af Geijerstam, one of the dissenting jurors,
told reporters after today's conviction: ``We think that the factor
of uncertainty is so prominent that we can't vote to convict.''
   The jury reached the verdict a week ago but withheld it while
writing a detailed finding. However, they ordered Pettersson to
remain in custody.
   Pettersson was arrested last Dec. 17. He maintained his
innocence during the five-week trial that began June 5. Even before
today's announcement, Pettersson's lawyer said he would appeal a
guilty verdict.
   The investigation leading up to his trial was marked by
setbacks. Police and security agencies were officially condemned
for bungling the case. Three police chiefs and a federal justice
minister resigned under fire.
   Investigators spent an estimated 1 million man-hours chasing
theories of international conspiracy. No one ever claimed a reward
worth $8 million that was offered for information leading to a
conviction.
   Pettersson's criminal record lists more than 60 arrests and
includes a conviction for manslaughter in the 1970 bayonet stabbing
of a man near the Palme slaying site.
   He has previously been held in court-ordered psychiatric care
and has a long history of methamphetamine and alcohol abuse.
   ``I was a bum,'' he told the court. ``It's actually surprising
that anyone at all has anything positive to say about me.''
   ``I did not kill Prime Minister Olof Palme,'' he testified. He
described himself as an admirer of Palme.
   Police questioned Pettersson in the weeks immediately after the
shooting, but released him because his alibi seemed sound.
   He came under suspicion again late last year when a new team of
investigators found holes in his original story.
   Mrs. Palme testified that she had seen Pettersson standing near
her husband immediately after the shooting.
   ``I'm absolutely certain,'' about his identity, she testified
last month. Other witnesses placed him near the scene or said he
had followed the Palmes down Sveavagen, a main avenue, after the
late movie.
   However, neither Mrs. Palme nor any other witness swore to
seeing Pettersson fire the shots that killed Palme and slightly
wounded his wife.
   Mrs. Palme said she remembered Pettersson's face, but could not
swear that he had a gun in his hand.
   The murder weapon, a .357-caliber Magnum pistol, was never found.

   A student who traveled to North Korea
illegally said today she will not return home unless the government
allows her parents to come and get her, and she threatened to stage
a hunger strike at the border, news reports said.
   South Korean authorities arrested 20 Roman Catholic priests
today as they tried to reach the border to greet the student,
20-year-old Im Su-Kyong. She went to North Korea for the 13th World
Festival of Youth and Students on July 1-8.
   Riot police firing tear gas stormed Seoul National University
after about 250 students brandishing metal pipes, clubs and rocks
tried to march from the school in a welcome rally for Ms. Im.
   Ms. Im had said she would cross the heavily militarized border
today as a symbol of unification between North and South Korea.
Today is the anniversary of the cease-fire that ended the 1950-53
Korean War.
   ``I have committed no crime. All that I have in my head is the
reunification of my homeland,'' North Korea's official Korean
Central News Agency quoted Ms. Im as saying at a news conference
today in North Korea's border town of Kaesong.
   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, quoted unidentified
sources at the Unification Ministry as saying Ms. Im arrived at the
truce village of Panmunjom, in the demilitarized zone, at around
noon with about 500 supporters.
   South Korean and foreign journalists based in Seoul were barred
from Panmunjom.
   ``Don't block my way,'' Ms. Im reportdly shouted to Korean
soldiers assigned to the United Nations Command joint security
area. ``Unless my parents and friends come to pick me up, I will
not cross the military demarcation line.''
   The U.S.-led U.N. Command guards the southern half of the
2.5-mile-wide Demilitarized Zone. The command represents 16 nations
that sent troops to aid South Korea in the Korean War.
   South Korea said it would arrest Ms. Im on charges of violating
national security when she returned. The North and South are bitter
enemies, and it is against South Korean law to travel to the North
without official approval.
   Four sedans carrying the priests were stopped in northern Seoul
when about 100 riot police surrounded their cars. After the priests
refused to leave their cars, police opened the doors.
   Some of the priests were pushed and shoved as they resisted
arrest. They were put into four police vans and taken to a nearby
police station.
   ``Sharing the pain of national division, we are embarking on a
road toward national conciliation,'' one of the arrested priests,
the Rev. Nam Kuk-hyun, said before the arrests.
   Few citizens have been allowed to cross the sensitive border
area, and then only by mutual agreement of both sides.
   Seoul maintains that talks on unification must go through
official channels, and it accuses the North of fomenting unrest by
encouraging unofficial visits by radical students and citizens from
the South.
   Radical students, a small but vocal minority on campuses, have
hailed Ms. Im as a ``national unification heroine.''
   A rally in her support was held at Seoul's Korea University. No
arrests were reported.
   News reports in Seoul said government authorities had been
notified as many as 650 participants who joined a peace march
across North Korea with Ms. Im might also cross the border in
Panmunjom.
   North Korea today demanded that the U.N. Command remove guns it
said were blocking the march across the border.

<HEAD>Top Soviet Military Adviser Visits Chicago Board of Trade, McDonald's</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top military adviser to Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev says if Washington deploys the B-2 Stealth
bomber, the Kremlin would ``respond adequately'' by developing ways
to detect the radar-dodging plane.
   Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev toured the Chicago Board of Trade,
visited a McDonald's restaurant and spoke at a security forum
Wednesday.
   He said at the luncheon forum that if the United States
purchases a fleet of B-2 Stealth bombers, a program generating
bitter debate this week in Congress, ``the Soviet Union will
respond adequately in order to defend our interests.''
   ``Certain steps to improve our air defense system would be
carried out,'' he said, hinting that the Soviets would develop
methods to detect and shoot down the boomerang-shaped bomber.
   Akhromeyev urged the audience to appreciate the Soviet Union's
unwillingness to lose its advantage in ground forces without
limiting U.S. ability to project naval power around the Soviet
periphery.
   ``We have a legitimate right to be concerned about the huge
power of the U.S. Navy,'' he said, noting the U.S. monopoly on
large aircraft carriers. ``We are in no way attempting to disarm
you. But you should think about the fact that the time has come to
initiate negotiations on sea power.''
   Akhromeyev, who is on a 10-day visit to the United States,
testified Friday before the House Armed Services Committee about
the future of Soviet military policy.
   As part of a three-day visit to Chicago, he spoke at the
luncheon sponsored by the National Strategy Forum, a local
organization that conducts programs and research to broaden citizen
awareness on national security issues.
   ``I do not regard the United States as the enemy anymore,''
Akhromeyev told the audience. But at a news conference later he
said, ``Mistrust is still the component element of the
environment'' in which the Kremlin and the White House operate.

<HEAD>Methane Kills 5 on Family Dairy Farm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MENOMINEE, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Methane gas killed a dairy farm owner
and four other men after one slipped into a manure pit and the
others tried to rescue him.
   The victims included owner Carl Theurkauf Sr., his son Carl Jr.
and his grandson Danny, said a relative who would not give his
name. Identities of the other two were not released immediately.
   ``It was my father and my brother, and I don't really feel like
talking about it right now,'' the man said.
   Officers were called to the farm in the southwestern corner of
Michigan's Upper Peninsula shortly before 9 a.m. Wednesday, said
Deputy Gary Corwin of the Menominee County Sheriff's Department.
   The accident occurred in an uncovered, concrete-lined pit with
one sloping side allowing waste to slide to the bottom.
   ``It appeared they were cleaning it and the first victim just
happened to slip ... down the incline plane; a second went down and
was overcome also,'' said Dr. Paul Haupt, county medical examiner.
``Then another went down to get the other two, and so on and so
on.''
   The victims probably were overcome within 90 seconds of exposure
to methane, an odorless gas generated by the animal waste in the
pit, Haupt said. No autopsies were planned.
   ``It's been really hot up here, and they were in the pit with
about a foot of cow sewage,'' he said. ``The gas was forming and
just sort of sitting there on top of the liquid. It was displacing
the oxygen ... like being on the moon.''
   The victims ranged in age from 18 to 60, Corwin said. One man
was dead when police arrived.
   Three others died later Wednesday at Bay Area Medical Center in
Marinette, Wis., and the fifth at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin
in Wauwatosa, Wis., he said.
   Haupt said other dairy farmers told him that uncovered pits are
common.
   ``It's a known hazard, and why they're not covered, I don't
know,'' he said.

<HEAD>Hun Sen Meets French Premier; Talks Could Resume Friday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen met today with
French Premier Michel Rocard and said he hopes an international
conference on his war-torn nation goes ahead as planned, officials
said.
   Leaving the hourlong meeting, Hun Sen told reporters that the
four Cambodian factions were seeking a compromise in a dispute over
who should represent Cambodia at the nearly 20-nation conference,
which starts Sunday.
   Hun Sen had been expected to resume talks today with the leaders
of the three-part Cambodian resistance. However, a Foreign Ministry
spokesman said lower-ranking officials from the four factions would
meet today instead.
   The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping
with department practice, said the talks among the leaders could
start again Friday.
   Hun Sen is demanding that Cambodia be represented at the
international conference by two delegations: his
Vietnamese-installed government and the three-party guerrilla
coalition.
   But Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the resistance leader, rejects
this. He wants Cambodia to be represented by one delegation that
includes the government and guerrilla factions _ a proposal
rejected by Hun Sen.
   The conference will include the participation of the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council _ the United States,
Soviet Union, China, Britain and France. Also participating will be
Canada, India, Japan and the six-nation Association of Southeast
Asian Nations.
   ``We refuse to let the world see that we are two Cambodias,''
Sihanouk said Wednesday. ``We let France know that in such a case,
we will not attend the conference...(and) the results of the
conference will not be valid.''
   The role of the Khmer Rouge, the strongest of the three
resistance factions, is at the heart of the dispute.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978 to topple the Khmer
Rouge, which was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of
thousands of people in a more than three-year reign of terror.
   The disagreement between the factions extends to how Cambodia's
representatives should be seated at the huge rectangular table
around which foreign ministers will meet.
   Hun Sen suggested today that four seats, one for each faction,
might represent a compromise solution. Sihanouk told reporters
Wednesday he would propose four seats, a plan originally outlined
by France.
   ``The ministry is very active in the search for a compromise
solution over the Khmer representation at the international
conference on Cambodia,'' the Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
``Progress has already been made and the (talks) should be able to
resume during the day Friday.''
   Both Hun Sen and Sihanouk have held out the possibility that
Cambodia would not be represented, something all concerned want to
avoid.
   Hun Sen expressed ``his wish to see the international conference
on Cambodia take place,'' said an aide to Rocard, briefing
reporters on the meeting on condition of anonymity.
   Hun Sen said he had a ``good conversation'' with Rocard, and
described the meeting as ``important.'' The meeting was the first
between Hun Sen and the head of a Western government.
   France recognizes neither the Vietnamese-installed government of
Hun Sen nor the exile Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea,
over which Sihanouk is president.
   Most nations recognize the guerrilla coalition, which holds
Cambodia's seat at the United Nations.

   A government spokesman said today the Soviet Union
has no connection with Felix S. Bloch, the U.S. diplomat suspected
of being a spy.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said
allegations that Bloch was a spy for the Soviet Union were a result
of a new ``wave of spy mania'' caused by the U.S. media.
   In a follow-up to questions asked Wednesday, Gerasimov said he
made inquiries about Bloch's activities. ``The name of Bloch was
not familiar. We have no connection with him. We have nothing to do
with him,'' he told a regular news briefing.
   ``It is lamentable that the U.S. press fans such hysteria,''
Gerasimov added.
   The State Department has confirmed it is investigating Bloch,
formerly posted to the U.S. Embassy in Vienna, for alleged
``illegal activities'' involving ``agents of a foreign intelligence
service.''
   Bloch has not been charged with any crime. He has been under
surveillance in the New York area.
   News leaks from unidentified sources in Washington said there
was a videotape of Bloch passing a briefcase to a Soviet agent in
Paris and that the same agent later allegedly telephoned Bloch with
a warning that he was under suspicion.
   Bloch today left the East Side co-op in Manhattan where he had
spent several days and drove off alone in a car with Washington,
D.C., license plates.
   He said nothing to a group or reporters waiting outside the
building.
   Bloch, a career American diplomat, was deputy chief of mission
at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna from 1980 to 1987.

<TEXT>
   Sri Lanka today ruled out a military
confrontation with India, easing fears of more bloodshed as the
deadline for the demanded withdrawal of Indian peacekeeping troops
approaches.
   ``We are not going to fight India. We know our limitations,''
Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne told reporters.
   Also today, news reports said Indian troops clashed once again
with ethnic Tamil rebels whom the Indians were sent to disarm two
years ago. One report said 15 civilians were killed in the cross
fire.
   Fears of clashes between Sri Lankan and Indian soldiers in
northeastern Sri Lanka mounted after India refused to pull out its
troops by Saturday, the deadline set by President Ranasinghe
Premadasa.
   The president had vowed to take ``necessary steps'' if the
estimated 45,000 Indian soldiers did not leave by then.
   Wijeratne said he and Premadasa were conducting ``intensive
personal negotiations'' with Indian leaders to resolve the
withdrawal issue.
   The foreign minister said India should accept Premadasa as the
commander-in-chief of all forces in Sri Lanka, and it should stop
fighting the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest and most
militant Tamil rebel group seeking a separate nation in the
northeast.
   Indian forces in Sri Lanka now operate under an Indian commander.
   Asked what Sri Lanka would do if India rejected Sri Lanka's
demands, Wijeratne said: ``The president will take a course of
action which he will spell out after the 29th. But we still feel we
can resolve this problem.''
   India sent troops to Sri Lanka, an island off its southern
coast, to disarm the rebels under the terms of a peace accord
signed July 29, 1987.
   A Tamil newspaper published in Jaffna, 185 miles north of
Colombo, said at least 15 Tamil civilians were killed in cross fire
Wednesday between the rebels and Indian soldiers at the northern
village of Point Pedro.
   In New Delhi, India, a Foreign Ministry official said the
soldiers shot and killed nine rebels. However, the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, made no mention of civilian
casualties.
   Point Pedro is a rebel stronghold.
   The Indian troops initially were deployed to supervise the 1987
peace accord, which promised limited autonomy to the minority
Tamils in exchange for an arms surrender by the militant groups.
   While most militias abided by the accord, the dominant Tamil
Tigers backed out and began attacking Indian soldiers. About 1,000
troops have been killed.
   Premadasa made his demand on June 1 after the Tigers opened
peace talks with his government. But India refused to comply,
saying a premature withdrawal could lead to even more bloodshed.
   Subsequent requests by Premadasa and refusals by India's prime
minister, Rajiv Gandhi, led to a diplomatic impasse and fears about
the safety of the Indians _ civilians as well as soldiers _ on the
island.
   Wijeratne said the withdrawal issue was being used by
anti-government Sinhalese extremists to ``whip up venom against
India.''
   About 800 relatives of Indian diplomats flew home this week for
what was described by embassy officials as a routine vacation.
   ``We cannot ensure security to every single Indian home, but we
have secured sensitive areas,'' Wijeratne said.
   The Indian presence is resented by Sinhalese extremists, who say
it compromises the country's sovereignty. They have used this issue
to launch a violent anti-government and anti-Indian campaign.

   The Bush administration is hitting the road to
seek consensus on a national energy strategy, including how to curb
U.S. dependence on imported oil and still protect the environment.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins outlined plans Wednesday for a
series of hearings in five cities to quiz energy industry
representatives, environmentalists and others on what focus a
national energy policy should take.
   President Bush signed legislation Wednesday ending price
controls on natural gas. He made it clear that whatever
recommendations are made for a national energy policy, the
department will rely heavily on market forces and not controls
imposed from Washington.
   A preliminary outline for an energy strategy is to be completed
next spring, with final recommendations to be on Bush's desk by the
end of 1990.
   The document and recommendations ``will serve as a blueprint for
energy policy and program decisions ... set our pace, and provide
mileposts by which to evaluate our progress in providing the energy
our economy needs, while protecting the health, safety and
environment,'' said Watkins.
   The administration has been under criticism for not moving
rapidly to put together a detailed energy plan that also considers
major environmental concerns such as global warming, which is
widely attributed to the burning of fossil fuels.
   Watkins insisted the department has no ``preconceived focus'' on
such an energy blueprint from Washington.
   The president emphasized that domestic oil and gas exploration
and drilling must be expanded to curb the reliance on imports.
Attempts to ease public concerns about nuclear power and offshore
oil exploration are expected to be other key elements of the plan,
according to officials.
   ``Our energy security problem continues,'' Bush said Wednesday
as he signed the natural gas decontrol bill. ``Conservation
achievements are leveling off, domestic oil production continuing
its downward trend. And petroleum imports are increasing. And our
need for a cleaner environment is obvious to all.''
   Watkins noted at a White House briefing that domestic oil
production is at its lowest point in 25 years while imports have
jumped 65 percent in the last four years.
   Later at a hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee, Watkins emphasized the need to take into
account environmental concerns in any national energy policy.
   But some senators questioned the need for 18 more months of
fact-finding.
   ``I'm not sure how much more consensus we're going to need,''
said Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo. ``It's time to move.''
   Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., noted that national energy issues have
been studied for a decade and ``it seems like we're kind of
stirring the broth again.''
   However, Watkins said the hearings are needed for any future
energy policy to be widely accepted.
   ``With the lack of credibility my department has right now, I
don't think we can pontificate on what the energy policy should
be,'' said Watkins, alluding in part to the Energy Department's
recent problems in connection with the handling of waste at its
nuclear weapons processing plants.
   Watkins said his department will hold public hearings, beginning
Tuesday in Washington and followed by sessions in Tulsa, Okla., on
Aug. 8, Boise, Idaho, on Aug. 23; Seattle on Aug. 30 and
Louisville, Ky., on Sept. 8, all aimed at producing a draft plan by
April 1.
   Other hearings will be held later in the year, but their
locations have yet to be determined.

   Homeless people guarded a park and
screamed at rioters when police battled a mob of about 300 youths,
including some fresh from an anarchist convention in San Francisco.
   More than 30 rioters were arrested on a variety of felony and
misdemeanor charges Wednesday, police said. Police suffered head
wounds from rocks, bottles and cans thrown at them, but described
the injuries as minor.
   ``They are basically throwing any thing they can get their hands
on,'' police Lt. Michael de Latour said. He said there were no
injuries among the rioters, some wearing helmets and carrying clubs.
   The anarchists concluded their national convention earlier
Wednesday with a demonstration and picnic for the homeless.
   Some who took part in the convention said the aim of the
Berkeley protest was to occupy a burned-out transient hotel about
100 feet from People's Park in a show of support for the homeless.
   They were met, however, by a solid row of riot-helmeted police
officers.
   A group of homeless people stood guard at People's Park when the
mob threatened to trash a trailer converted into a free restaurant
for the homeless.
   When police chased the rioters through People's Park, homeless
people guarded flowers and gardens and screamed at the rioters to
go back to San Francisco.
   ``All the homeless were on the side of the police,'' said
Carolle Cates, a homeless person. ``Those people were in the
wrong.''

   A mechanical problem may have
caused an Atlantic City casino-bound bus to overturn, leaving one
person dead and 37 others injured, eight critically, police said.
   ``I think maybe the bus wasn't in terrific condition,'' said
passenger Francine Pera, 37, of Wayne. ``We kept having problems
with the air conditioning. The driver stopped once along the way at
a toll booth to check it out.''
   She added, ``Personally, I think she was going too fast.''
   Officials at Saddle River Tours, the Lodi company that operates
the bus, refused to comment.
   All the victims in Wednesday's accident on the Garden State
Parkway were from northern New Jersey.
   The majority of the injured passengers had minor cuts and
bruises and back pains, said Dr. James Bagnell, director of
emergency services for Atlantic City Medical Center. The more
serious injuries involved broken bones, he said.
   One passenger, Blanche Biamonte, 76, of Newark, died Wednesday
evening of multiple injuries, said a hospital spokeswoman.
   The bus overturned and fell on its side. Police said the driver,
Peggy Davis, 52, of Irvington, complained of a mechanical problem
with the bus.
   ``It appears the brakes locked up and in an attempt to gain
control, she tipped the bus,'' said Trooper David Smith, the first
officer at the scene. Smith said investigators were trying to
determine how fast the bus was traveling at the time of the
accident.
   ``There was quite a bit of panic,'' Ms. Pera said. ``A lot of
people were badly injured, and some were unconscious. I pushed a
woman off of me and discovered I was bleeding very badly. It took
40 stitches to close up cuts on my head and above my lip.''

   The Department of Health and Human Services
today announced it would provide up to 10 historically black
colleges and universities with grants to create programs that
improve the health of elderly minorities.
   HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, who announced the grants at a
conference on older minorities, said the programs would help
``reduce the incidence of poverty, poor health and avoidable death
in our elderly minority population.''
   Sullivan said the grants of up to $60,000 would be used ``for
new and innovative efforts to help our older black citizens learn
more about healthy diet, improved health behavior and avoid the
advent of disease.''
   ``This new program will help open the door for information,
education and awareness,'' he said. ``This will help promote better
health, happiness and maintenance of independence.''
   The grant program was developed by the department's
Administration on Aging, which since 1982 has provided 44 grants
totaling $4.2 million to historically black schools, mainly for
gerontology training programs.

<HEAD>Soviet Legislature Adopts Economic Resolutions for Baltics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN IAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet legislature today adopted two
resolutions paving the way for the Baltic republics to have greater
control of their economies.
   The action by the Supreme Soviet was a major victory for Baltic
activists, who have accused Moscow of sapping the republics'
natural resources and failing to help preserve their native
cultures and languages.
   One resolution would allow Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to
trade independently with other Soviet republics, Tass said.
   The second resolution approved the main provisions of a draft
law on economic independence for Estonia and Lithuania, which
already have declared themselves sovereign states, according to the
official news agency.
   ``All of the economy of Estonia will be directly controlled by
Estonian authorities instead of a Moscow minister,'' said Tarmu
Tammerk, an editor at the weekly newspaper Kodumaa in Tallinn, the
Estonian capital.
   Estonian and Lithuanian authorities, instead of officials in
Moscow, will decide production matters and control how profits are
spent.
   In Estonia today, Russian-speaking workers at 30 businesses were
on strike to protest what they consider discriminatory laws
limiting voting rights of immigrants to the republic.
   Mikhail I. Lisenk, chairman of a strike committee, said in a
telephone interview that 1,050 workers were on strike at
electronics and engine factories and ship repair yards. Railroad
workers joined the strike today, he said. Ship repairmen began the
strike Tuesday.
   The resolutions call on the Council of Ministers to draw up
draft laws on the resolutions and submit them to the Supreme Soviet
by Oct. 1 for approval, Tass said.
   An overwhelming majority of the 412 deputies at today's session
approved the resolutions, Tass said.
   Tammerk said under the provisions of the legislation, Baltic
trade relations between Moscow and other Soviet republics would be
based on trade agreements with other republics rather than the
present ``command system,'' whereby ministers based in Moscow make
economic decisions.
   The second resolution, according to Tass, ``is of an
organization and preparatory nature'' and approves the first
reading of the main provisions of a draft law on economic
independence for Estonia and Lithuania.
   The second resolution did not apply to Latvia because Latvian
deputies did not ask it to. They did not participate in the
drafting of the resolution.
   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said if
the draft laws are approved by the Supreme Soviet in the fall, the
Baltic states will have far more control over their economies than
envisioned by Moscow earlier.
   The Latvian Supreme Soviet was meeting today to consider whether
to declare the republic sovereign.
   The Baltic republics are particularly sensitive to the
independence issue because many residents there say Soviet power is
illegitimate. The Soviet Union took power the republics in 1940
under a secret protocol of a Soviet pact with Nazi Germany signed
the year before.
   Nationalism in the Soviet Union's ethnically diverse republics
has risen under the greater openness promoted by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The result has been often violent clashes
between ethnic groups.

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Temporary Increase in Borrowing Authority</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Ways and Means Committee today
approved a temporary $70 billion increase in the government's
borrowing authority.
   The committee approved the increase by voice vote after the
Treasury Department announced that it expects the current limit of
$2.8 trillion to be reached sometime during August, when Congress
will be on a month-long recess.
   ``If that happens, the federal government will no longer be able
to meet its obligations and the country will default on its debt,''
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the chairman, told the committee.
``Social Security checks won't go out; Medicare obligations won't
be met, and federal employees, including outselves, won't get
paid.''
   The temporary boost, which could be considered by the House
later in the day, would raise the debt ceiling through Oct. 31. The
Senate Finance Committee has voted a $60 billion increase for the
same period.
   Later this year, Congress is expected to raise the borrowing
authority to $3.123 trillion, which would carry the government
through Sept. 30, 1990.

   About 800 people will have to stay away

in a railroad tanker car to burn itself out, a CSX Transportation
Inc. spokesman said today.
   Crews used heavy equipment Wednesday to widen a rupture in the
tank car's outer shell to let more air accelerate the blaze, but
the car continued to burn although no toxic fumes were detected,
spokesman Lindsay R. Leckie told a news briefing.
   CSX, meanwhile, denied that excessive speed contributed to
Saturday's derailment of 14 cars of a CSX train near this Saginaw
County community.
   An estimated 3,000 people initially were evacuated from a
15-square-mile area, said Les Harcus, a spokesman for the Saginaw
County emergency services office.
   Further investigation of the accident was on hold until the
chlorosilene fire was out, CSX spokesman Lloyd Lewis said from
company headquarters in Jacksonville, Fla.
   Under non-binding federal guidelines issued in 1979, the train
shouldn't have been traveling more than 30 mph, National
Transportation Safety Board investigator James Burnett said
Tuesday. That limit, 10 mph below the authorized speed for that
portion of track, reflected the tank cars' lack of iron plating
used to protect against rupture in case of derailment.
   Leckie, who said earlier that the train was traveling 37 mph at
the time of the derailment, said Wednesday night CSX did not
believe the train's speed was a factor in the accident.
   At least four people were released Monday from a Saginaw
hospital following treatment for skin irritation and nausea. An
undetermined number of people reported similar symptoms earlier.

<DATELINE>SALZBURG, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Salzburg Festival opened today for
the first time in more than three decades without Herbert von
Karajan, the revered conductor who died earlier this month of a
heart attack.
   President Kurt Waldheim opened the five-week festival with a
tribute to Karajan, the former Berlin Philharmonic maestro, who
died July 16 at age 81.
   ``The man Herbert von Karajan is missing, but his musical work
will survive,'' Waldheim said. A black flag flew in mourning for
Karajan, a native of Salzburg who had conducted at the festival
since 1948.
   Sir George Solti then conducted Giuseppe Verdi's opera ``The
Masked Ball'' in the opening-night performance, with Placido
Domingo in the starring role.
   Karajan was to have conducted the Vienna Philharmonic in six
performances of the opera and an Aug. 15 concert of Bruckner's
Eighth Symphony.
   Solti, musical director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, will
conduct all performances of the opera, and Carlo Maria Giulini will
conduct the Bruckner.
   About 190,000 seats were available for the festival this year,
but tens of thousands of ticket requests had to be turned away for
performances by Jose Carreras, Jessye Norman, Agnes Baltsa and
others, organizers said.

   A commercial helicopter that began
operating as a shuttle service only a day ago crashed off the
eastern coast today, killing 12 of the 20 people aboard, state-run
television reported.
   Korean Broadcasting System said the three crew members and three
passengers were rescued but the others, mostly vacationers, were
trapped in the aircraft when it sank. The broadcast said two
passengers were missing.
   The bodies of the 12 were recovered from the Sikorsky copter
S-58T, which was towed to Ullung Island off the southeast coast,
the broadcast said.
   The report said there were no foreigners aboard. The network
first said 19 people were in the copter but later said corrected
the total to 20.
   The network said the aircraft developed engine trouble and
crashed into the sea shortly after taking off from Ullung Island.
It was en route to Pohang, a coastal city 130 miles southwest of
the resort island in the Sea of Japan.
   Korean Broadcasting System said divers were searching for those
missing.
   It said Universal Air Service Co., a private South Korean
company, recently bought the copter from Sikorsky Aircraft in
Stratford, Conn., and Wednesday began using it for the shuttle
service between the island and the mainland.
   Universal Air Service officials were not immediately available
for comment.
   In Stratford, a Sikorsky spokesman said the company did not know
details about the specific copter involved in the crash. Sikorsky
was checking whether it sold the copter to the South Korean
company, said spokesman William Tuttle.
   Sikorsky built 47 S-58T turbine-powered helicopters from 1970 to
1976, Tuttle said. He said the company also made piston-powered
S-58s that may have been refitted with turbines by other companies.
   Tuttle said a company representative was on the scene to assist
South Korea's civil aviation authorities in their investigation.

<HEAD>Chinese Academic Fired for Backing Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities in one of China's most reform-minded
cities, Shenzhen, said today they fired the local university's
president and Communist Party chief for making serious mistakes
during the pro-democracy movement.
   He is the first university president known to be dismissed as a
result of this spring's student-led protests.
   The local government office, reached by telephone, said Luo
Zhengqi was removed from both posts at Shenzhen University on
Saturday.
   The order firing Luo said he made serious unspecified mistakes,
suggesting he was judged too sympathetic to the student protesters.
   The protests broke out on Beijing campuses in mid-April but
spread to most colleges nationwide before they were crushed in June
by the army and police. The government says about 200 people died
in a military assault on Beijing on June 3-4, but witnesses and
Western intelligence sources say up to 3,000 may have been killed.
   Earlier this week, authorities in the central province of Anhui
fired the deputy director of the provincial education commission.
He was accused of encouraging the protests.
   In addition, some Beijing professors have been arrested and
forced to attend special political education.
   So far, Beijing colleges say their presidents remain in office.
   There has been speculation, however, that Beijing University
President Ding Shisun will lose his job for having allowed his
school to become a center of the seven-week protest movement.
   Ding is considered a reformer and belongs to the Chinese
Democratic League, one of eight non-Communist parties allowed to
function in China under close party control.
   Shenzhen Vice Mayor Li Hao said earlier this month that Beijing
officials had indicated they planned to ``pay more attention'' to
Shenzhen. He did not elaborate.
   The city is across the border from the capitalist British
enclave of Hong Kong and has close ties with it. It is known for
its free lifestyle compared with the rest of China, including
prostitution, gambling and smuggling.
   Police in Shenzhen, meanwhile, refused to comment on a Hong Kong
newspaper report they arrested fugitive Beijing student leader Chai
Ling.
   The report appeared in the Chinese-language Tin Tin Daily, known
for its sensationalist reporting. Hong Kong radio quoted
unidentified Shenzhen security officials as saying they arrested a
student leader about a week ago, but that it was not Chai.

<TEXT>
   Canadians began returning home today
to salvage what remained from fires that destroyed 3.7 million
acres of forest in three central provinces.
   Some roadblocks in Manitoba were lifted early today, and a group
from the Cross Lake Indian Reserve returned to their homes a few
hours later, said spokesman John Paupanekis.
   The 3,600 residents of the community had spent the week since
they were evacuated either camped out in tents or in makeshift
dormitories in the mining city of Thompson, about 125 miles to the
north of the reserve.
   They were among the 27,000 people forced from their homes by the
fires in northern Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Ontario. No injuries
or deaths have been reported.
   Scattered rain and cooler temperatures helped bring some fires
under control Wednesday. But hundreds of fires in the three
provinces _ most started by lightning _ kept burning today.
   Manitoba Premier Gary Filmon has said the firefighting and
evacuation will cost the provincial government $30 million.
   The province declared a state of emergency last week, and
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on Tuesday promised ``every
conceivable support'' from the federal government.

<TEXT>
   An all-white swim club, which barred three
black teen-agers from using a pool it leased from the Jaycees, will
open the facility to blacks next week, an official said today.
   The Jaycees closed the pool leased to the Saluda Swim and Tennis
Club Wednesday and said it could not re-open until it is
desegregated.
   After a Wednesday night meeting, the club's seven-member board
agreed to the Jaycees' demands, board president Robert Booth said
today.
   ``In 1989, it's the moral thing to do,'' he said. He said the
pool would reopen on Aug. 5 and admit blacks and whites.
   The club refused to admit the teen-agers July 13 because the
land on which the pool sits was willed in 1933 by George C. Wheeler
to the town with a provision that it be used as a recreation area
for whites only. The town deeded the property to the Jaycees in
1955 with the provision intact.
   Lawyers say such provisions are legally unenforceable.
   The three black teen-agers were with a United Methodist Church
group that had made a reservation to use the pool after spending
the day renovating a dilapidated home.
   The club offered to allow whites in the group to swim, but the
entire group of about 50 left when the black youths were turned
away, said Willie Teague, editor of the church newspaper.
   The club has no black members and no black has ever applied,
Booth said earlier.
   Before the pool is reopened, the club will review its bylaws to
make sure they contain no discriminatory provisions.
   ``We just want to make sure that it is a completely open
membership,'' he said.
   New members will be charged $85 per family, per season, said
Booth.
   Saluda, population 3,000, is about 45 miles west of Columbia. It
is 40 percent black.
   The Jaycees, numbering 240,000 nationally, prohibit
discrimination based on race, sex or creed. The organization was
founded as a leadership training group in 1920 and is open to men
and women ages 21 through 39.

<HEAD>Eds: Top 15 grafs new with vote on plutonium amendment; picks up

<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House voted today to urge President Bush
to open negotiations with the Soviet Union aimed at banning the
production of plutonium and enriched uranium, the materials used in
nuclear weapons.
   The vote for the non-binding resolution, attached to a defense
authorization bill, was 284-138.
   Supporters of the amendment said such negotiations are a logical
and needed next step in the arms control process.
   But opponents said such a ban would be impossible to verify and
would put the United States at a serious disadvantage because it
has no currently operating nuclear enrichment production plants
while the Soviet Union has 12 to 14 ``going at full blast.''
   Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, said the talks could resolve an ``tremendous
imbalance'' in which the Soviets are adding to their nuclear
stockpile while U.S. production stands at ``zero.''
   ``This is an effort to get us on the negotiating track and deal
with this problem if possible,'' he said. ``This is an expression
of Congress saying, `Mr President, see what you can do.'''
   Rep. Bob Walker, R-Pa., replied that the Bush administration
opposes the measure and that U.S. arms negotiators are against it
because an agreement could not be verified.
   ``Let's not do something stupid,'' Walker said.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said he worried that Congress might, with such
suggestions, ``overload the arms control agenda.''
   Working through the defense bill, the House was expected to
tackle later such thorny issues as the F-14D Tomcat fighter plane
and possibly the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, two programs
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has proposed canceling as a
budget-reduction step.
   The House voted Wednesday to curb production of the
radar-evading stealth bomber program, but Cheney expressed relief
the chamber had not killed the $70 billion program outright.
   Cheney said the White House hopes a House conference with the
Senate to resolve differences in the two chambers' versions of the
$295 billion defense authorization bill will remove the roadblocks
and permit a fast start for production of the costly bomber.
   ``They (the administration) have, in effect, a year to
restructure the program, to prove through tests it's worth
buying,'' Aspin told reporters. ``It's the core of the argument. We
don't know enough right now to make a decision.''
   The Aspin amendment would require the Pentagon to meet rigid
test and performance standards before additional stealth bombers
are purchased. It would limit to two the number of bombers to be
purchased over the next two fiscal years.
   The administration suffered an unwanted budget cut Wednesday
when the House approved an amendment to reduce by $502 million the
$1.1 billion earmarked for spare MX missiles and for a rail system
Bush requested to make the MX a mobile system. The 224-197 vote
does not affect the nearly $800 million earmarked for the missiles
themselves.
   The Senate, voting 98-1 on Tuesday, endorsed President Bush's
two-year request for $4.7 billion for stealth production,
conditioned on the aircraft meeting flight-test and radar-evasion
standards.
   Before adopting the Aspin amendment the House defeated a
proposal to eliminate the program outright.
   The Osprey and the Tomcat were put on the House agenda after
lawmakers from Pennsylvania, New York and Texas expressed dismay
with their cancellation.
   The V-22, a tilt-rotor aircraft that takes off like a helicopter
but can fly like a plane, is manufactured by Boeing Helicopter Co.,
and Bell Helicopter Textron Inc., located in Pennsylvania and Texas.
   The Pentagon had planned to spend $25.9 billion on 663 Ospreys,
including $1.3 billion in fiscal 1990.
   The Tomcat, manufactured by the Grumman Corp. on Long Island
also had come under Cheney's ax.
   But the House Armed Services Committee voted last month to
restore $157 million for the Osprey in fiscal 1990 and about $230
million for the Tomcat.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir pledged never to
negotiate with Yasser Arafat, saying the PLO chief wants to kill
him and other Israelis.
   ``I shall not sit with him and shall not talk with him. I know
what he wants: he wants to see me dead. Not only me but you, and
you, and you, all of us, that's what he wants,'' Shamir said
Wednesday during a nationally broadcast Israel Television interview.
   He also said he has been holding meetings with Palestinians from
the occupied territories in an effort to form a representative
group to negotiate with Israel even before a government peace plan
is put into effect. He said the Arabs involved were not linked to
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The prime minister, reacting to reports that indirect talks have
been held between Israel and the PLO, said even Arafat's acceptance
of Israel's peace initiative would not change his mind about
talking to the PLO leader.
   ``I'm not expecting anything from Yasser Arafat. I don't see in
any future any spark of understanding between myself and this
guy,'' Shamir said.
   He denied claims by the PLO and Israeli legislators that Israel
was conducting indirect talks with the PLO. Senior officials and
legislators from the left-of-center Labor Party said Wednesday that
Israel was in contact with the PLO in an effort to win approval of
the peace plan.
   The Labor Party and Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc are uneasy
partners in a coalition government.
   The peace initiative calls for electing Palestinians in the
occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip to negotiate with Israel on
interim self-rule, with later talks on the final status of the
territories.
   ``The fact that there are negotiations on this subject with the
PLO is clear and it has one aim: to get a green light from the PLO
for elections in the territories,'' Yossi Beilin, an aide to Labor
Party leader Shimon Peres, said on Israel army radio. He said the
contacts were carried out through the United States, Egypt and
Romania.
   But Shamir said even indirect negotiations with the PLO are
impossible.
   ``This...government has in its guidelines a permanent and stable
principle: there are no and there will be no negotiations with
PLO.''
   Israel considers the PLO a terrorist group.
   He also reiterated that Israel would not accept a Palestinian
state. The Palestinian National Council, a legislature-in-exile,
declared such a state in November.
   Despite his other comments, Shamir confirmed that he had met
with Jamil Tarifi, a pro-PLO Palestinian lawyer.
   Israeli sources said Wednesday the PLO has proposed forming a
delegation of 10 residents from the occupied territories and two
Palestinian-Americans to meet with Israeli officials on the
elections proposal.
   The sources, who demanded anonymity, said delegation members
would eventually emerge as candidates in the elections and be
assured victory with PLO backing.

   American Tom Gentry's
powerboat zipped across the finish line today after a 2{ day
journey from New York to capture the record for the fastest
trans-Atlantic sea crossing.
   Gentry, 58, a wealthy property developer from Honolulu, and his
five-man crew crossed the finish line at Bishop Rock lighthouse off
the Isles of Scilly at 3:56 a.m.
   Their 110-foot powerboat Gentry Eagle made the crossing from
Ambrose Light, N.Y., in two days, 14 hours and seven minutes, said
Gentry spokesman Keith Taylor.
   The trip eclipsed the June 1986 crossing by Briton Richard
Branson, whose 72-foot powerboat Virgin Atlantic Challenger II
completed the 3,386-mile crossing in three days, eight hours and 31
minutes.
   Branson, who was waiting in the Isles of Scilly, showered his
rival with champagne and said, ``My record has been thrashed. I
admire you enormously.''
   He handed Gentry the silver Virgin Atlantic Challenger Trophy
and said he would not try to win it back.
   Gentry, who called Branson a ``sport,'' later told reporters he
expected someone to break the record. ``Technology is always
advancing,'' he said.
   One of the Gentry Eagle crew, Californian navigator Geoff Brown,
called the Isles of Scilly by radio when Bishop Rock came into
sight and reported: ``We are blowing and going. We are pretty well
rested and ready to party.''
   Brown said Gentry was asleep as Gentry Eagle neared Bishop Rock
but was awake in time to take the helm for the finish.
   Branson's time had cut two hours and nine minutes off the speed
record held since 1952 by the American liner United States.
   Branson, a business tycoon whose interests include the airline
Virgin Atlantic and an entertainment empire, claimed the
150-year-old Blue Riband for the fastest trans-Atlantic sea
crossing following his 1986 voyage.
   But the U.S. Merchant Marine Museum at King's Point, N.Y.,
refused to hand over the trophy. Museum curator Frank Braynard said
at the time that it was for ocean liners, not ``little toy boats.''
   Branson then offered his own Virgin Atlantic Challenger Trophy
to anyone who could beat his time.

<HEAD>Judge Allows Suit Against Government Filed By Palestinians, Kenyan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven Palestinians and a Kenyan can sue the
U.S. government for allegedly targeting them for prosecution
because of their political beliefs, a federal judge has ruled.
   U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson, in allowing trial to
proceed, criticized the government Wednesday for filing new charges
against two of the Palestinians under a law allowing the exclusion
and deportation of aliens deemed undesirable.
   The Justice Department has been trying for 2{ years to deport
the eight, accusing them of having ties to a terrorist group, the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
   But none of the eight has been charged with criminal acts and
all have denied membership in the organization.
   The government first attempted to deport them under a section of
the McCarran-Walter Act that allowed deportation of people for
affiliations with groups advocating world communism,
totalitarianism or property destruction.
   In December, Wilson declared those provisions of the act
unconstitutional.
   The government then accused six of the defendants of visa
violations and two of violations under the section of the
McCarran-Walter Act dealing with undesirable aliens.
   The eight, along with several immigrant rights groups, responded
by suing the government.
   The judge said he was disturbed by the government's tactics.
   ``I don't see how this new section of McCarran-Walter is all
that different than the one we ruled on,'' Wilson told government
lawyers. ``Are we going to have to deal with each section of the
McCarran-Walter Act piece by piece?''

   The U.S. war on drugs in Peru and Bolivia
remains dangerous and ineffective, with negligible amounts of
cocaine being halted despite more than $100 million spent on the
problem over the past 17 years, the State Department's internal
watchdog told Congress today.
   The programs ``have not resulted in significant reductions of
coca cultivation or the disruption of cocaine trafficking in the
host countries,'' said State Department Inspector General Sherman
Funk, whose staff just returned from the region.
   ``Coca production in these countries has increased every year
and less than 1 percent of the illicit drugs have been seized,''
Funk told the Senate Foreign Relations narcotics subcommittee,
adding it is uncertain whether the programs can be made to work.
   But the program was defended by its top officials, who contended
the operation in those two countries _ dubbed ``Operation Snowcap''
_ is still developing and is improving.
   ``We cannot wait for a perfect solution,'' said David Westrate,
assistant administrator for operations of the Drug Enforcement
Administration. ``We're not going to solve this problem making
five-kilo cases in Cleveland, Ohio.''
   The hearing focused on a March report by Funk's office that
found U.S. personnel face unnecessary danger in Bolivia and Peru
and criticized the programs for waste and ineffectiveness.
   The report quoted a U.S. Embassy official in Lima as saying ``it
is only a matter of time before Americans are killed'' in Peru's
Upper Huallaga Valley, a region controlled by the heavily armed
Sendero Luminoso, or Shining Path, guerrillas.
   Funk's office found that DEA agents are coordinating air assault
operations of the civil police in Peru and the military in Bolivia,
even though most do not speak Spanish and have no appropriate
military training.
   Peru and Bolivia are the world's leading producers of coca leaf,
the raw material for cocaine.
   Citing the report, subcommittee chairman John Kerry, D-Mass.,
called government efforts to eradicate coca crops ``a dismal
failure,'' saying they are indicative of ``disarray in the war on
drugs.''
   But DEA spokesman Frank Shults said the March 1989 report, based
on visits to Peru and Bolivia by investigators a year ago, was
``very dated'' and added improvements have been made in the
anti-drug program.
   ``Our program in Latin America is one that is evolutionary.
There have been problems, and we've been making changes,'' he said.
   In Peru, the threat from the Shining Path guerrillas has caused
the United States to pull back while a more secure operations base
is built for them, and most eradication activity is on hold.
   As an example of the problems, the audit said Bolivian military
units were trained for their drug assaults by U.S. Army Special
Forces teams. But Pentagon rules prohibit the soldiers from
accompanying Bolivian units on jungle forays, so DEA agents are
left to coordinate field operations.
   The agents often issued orders to troops that were at odds with
what they had been taught by the U.S. Army, such as running down a
trail after landing in a helicopter in hopes of discovering a
cocaine laboratory, or fanning out and walking abreast through the
brush. Such tactics ``defeated the purpose of the training and were
dangerous,'' the report said.
   Among other problems outlined in the report:
   _Aircraft operated by the department's Bureau of International
Narcotics Matters are run in Bolivia without flight plans or proper
equipment, and are poorly maintained.
   _Bolivian drug interdiction searches have been an ``expensive
failure.'' Air searches run by the DEA seem random or are based on
unreliable intelligence, and yield little, it said. Just three drug
arrests were reported in the Beni region in northeast Bolivia in a
2{-year period; and 1,700 helicopter flight hours in 1987, costing
$1.7 million, yielded just 148 pounds of cocaine and the
destruction of 22 crude ``laboratories.''
   _Administrative snags with the Peruvian government resulted in
wasting more than $1 million on leased aircraft in 1987. The State
Department paid for 98 days but received just 14 days' service.
   _The manual coca eradication program in Peru has been
ineffective. The department spent $2 million in 1987 to eradicate
355 hectares of coca crops, and there was suspicion that there
could have been ``phantom'' employees on the program's payroll.

<HEAD>Judge Levies New $4.5 Million Fine Against UMW</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEBANON, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge fined the United Mine Workers nearly
$4.5 million today for what he called ``acts of terror'' in the
coalfields.
   Russell County Circuit Judge Donald McGlothlin Jr., who earlier
fined the UMW nearly $3 million for violating orders limiting
strike activities, blasted the union for assaulting and threatening
people during the nearly 4-month-long strike against the Pittston
Coal Group Inc.
   ``There has been a feeling of terror throughout much of this
area,'' the judge said.
   He said there has been ``a tremendous outpouring'' of public
money spent protecting residents from union violence and a loss of
tax revenues ``directly attributable to the violent acts of these
defendants.''
   McGlothlin ordered that $2 million of the fines be paid to the
state, $1 million to Dickenson County and almost $1.5 million to
Russell County. He also ordered that all UMW members be restrained
from impeding traffic around entrances to Pittston property and
from interfering with local traffic.
   Many of the fines stemmed from McGlothlin's finding that the
union failed to stop its members or supporters from forming convoys
of slow-driving vehicles that have delayed the hauling of Pittston
coal.
   UMW attorney Mike Passino said he expected the union would
appeal the judge's ruling.
   Late Wednesday UMW President Richard Trumka urged union
supporters from across the country to visit southwest Virginia's
coal fields and see ``a system that doesn't have room for workers
in it.''
   ``I'm asking people of conscience to come to southwest Virginia
and see the system,'' he told a crowd of about 4,000 at a rally in
St. Paul, Va. ``They'll keep coming until every one of you have a
contract and every one of our pensioners is taken care of.''
   He said the effort wouldn't be a national strike and that he
didn't expect miners to miss work to come to Virginia.
   The strike involves about 1,900 UMW members in Virginia, West
Virginia and Kentucky. Miners at Pittston had been working without
a contract for 14 months when they went on strike April 5 over
Sunday and overtime work and other issues.
   Pittston contends the UMW is trying to force the company to
ratify an agreement reached last year with other coal producers
that the company says would threaten its economic stability. The
UMW says Pittston is trying to break the union.
   Talks between the union and Pittston resumed last week. But
after no progress was reported Tuesday, further talks were put off
until Aug. 1.
   Virginia police were investigating two incidents Wednesday night
they considered strike-related, said Sgt. Mike Frank.
   In Dickenson County, the windshields of nine vehicles owned by
striking miners parked at Lambert's Fork Mine were smashed, Frank
said. In Tazewell County, a private residence owned by two working
miners and a vehicle parked there were shot at, Frank said. A
camping trailer next door was torched.
   No injuries were reported and no arrests have been made, Frank
said.

   An American tourist fell to his death at
Victoria Falls on Zimbabwe's border with Zambia, U.S. officials
said Thursday.
   John Morris, a student at the University of Chicago, was
visiting the 330-foot waterfall July 21 when he slipped on rocks
overlooking a gorge known as the Eastern Cataract, according to
Elizabeth Karonga of the U.S. Information Service in Harare.
   His body was recovered downstream, she said. Morris' age and
hometown were not immediately known.
   Viewing areas on both sides of the waterfalls are protected only
by thorn hedges and some wooden barriers. No deaths have been
reported there for several years.
   The Zambezi River cascades over a series of gorges about 1,708
yards in width to comprise Victoria Falls.

   The state says it will leave it up to
the federal government to pursue criminal charges against Exxon or
the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. for the nation's worst oil spill.
   State attorneys concluded that federal authorities have tougher
laws and stiffer penalties for environmental crimes such as the
spill of more than 10 million gallons of crude oil from the tanker
Exxon Valdez, Chief Prosecutor Larry Weeks said Wednesday.
   ``The money the state feels it would take to do a thorough job,
compared to the possible punishment we could impose, is not in
proportion,'' Weeks said.
   Under state law, the most corporations and their officers might
face would be misdemeanors with fines up to $100,000, Weeks said.
Under federal law, the same violations would be felonies with fines
triple the amount of actual damages.
   The decision to not pursue criminal charges won't affect the
state's plan to take civil action against Exxon and Alyeska, except
to make more money available for the civil litigation, Weeks said.
   Federal authorities have confirmed they are considering criminal
charges in connection with the March 24 spill in Prince William
Sound. But the U.S. attorney's office refers all inquiries to the
FBI, which will say only that it is investigating.

<HEAD>Air Force Restricts Chinooks Following Two Crashes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Royal Air Force has restricted flights of its
32 Chinook helicopters and launched an investigation into two
crashes of the twin-rotor aircraft this week, the air force said
Thursday.
   The crashes Monday and Tuesday resulted in only minor injuries
to those on board, but as a precaution few, if any, flights of
Chinooks would take place for now, the spokesman said.
   ``As a precautionary measure, RAF Chinook flying is being
restricted to that which is operationally essential until the
causes of the two accidents have been identified,'' the spokesman
said.
   He said it was too early to know the cause of the crashes.
   In the first crash, two men suffered minor injuries when a
Chinook went down while hovering a few feet above the ground. Three
others aboard were not hurt.
   On Tuesday, a second Chinook crashed while in a low hover at the
Mount Pleasant airfield on the Falkland Islands. Five of the eight
men on board were slightly injured.
   Last year, the U.S. Army grounded its 234 Chinooks for
transmission checks after their manufacturer, Boeing, said certain
transmissions were improperly assembled. Ten U.S. Army Chinooks
have been involved in crashes since 1985.
   The Royal Air Force also grounded its fleet in 1986 after a
civilian version of the Chinook crashed in the North Sea, killing
45 people. A faulty gearbox was blamed.

<HEAD>President Says Counterspy Improvements Needed</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Bloch-Waiting Game Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said today that the case of
Felix S. Bloch, the veteran U.S. diplomat suspected of spying,
spotlights an ongoing concern about improving the nation's
counterintelligence capabilities.
   ``The question is can we improve our counterintelligence? We
always ought to be striving to do that,'' Bush told reporters
during an Oval Office photo session. ``Can embassy security be
improved? We go through this periodically and the answer is, I'm
sure it can.''
   The president was asked whether he thought the Bloch case
pointed up a need for improvements in the counterintelligence
system, as has been suggested by some members of Congress.
   ``You are always concerned about people who are willing to
betray their country,'' Bush replied, noting that he headed the CIA
for a year in the 1970s. In the case of Bloch, who has not been
charged with any crime, he said, ``It's counterintelligence
capability of our country that at least is bringing some of these
facts to light.''
   However, the president said he was not ``passing judgment'' on
the Bloch case, which remains under investigation.
   Bloch, a career diplomat who was deputy chief of mission at the
U.S. Embassy in Vienna from 1980 to 1987, reportedly was filmed by
U.S. intelligence agents passing a briefcase to a known Soviet
agent. He has been under constant surveillance in the New York City
area.

<HEAD>Givenchy, Spook Wrap Up Couture Showings</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hubert de Givenchy and Per Spook wound up a week of
winter shows Thursday with two different types of Parisienne.
   The Givenchy lady was a savvy sophisticate, while Per Spook's
had an appealing ingenue look.
   Gianfranco Ferre of Dior won the Golden Thimble Prize, awarded
twice yearly to the most creative haute couturier. The Italian-born
designer, trained as an architect, was chosen in May to replace
Marc Bohan at the world's most prestigious fashion house. Bohan won
a Golden Thimble for Dior last summer.
   Ferre's beautifully constructed clothes in fabulous fabrics gave
a lift and a new ``New Look'' to Dior's fashion scene, and appealed
to the jury of 28 international fashion writers.
   There was not much strikingly new about Givenchy's collection,
although the outfits were beautiful, sumptuous and seductive.
   The silhouette stayed in place, firmly feminine and with shapely
padded shoulders, in spite of the trend to shrug off big shoulders
as a thing of the past. Waists were small, and skirts for daytime
invariably bared the knee.
   With long jackets and big round buttons, the suits often were in
shades of chocolate brown, beige or rust, and looked timely topped
by full capes _ a new note at Givenchy _ or seven-eighths coats in
a contrasting color. Lined with lynx, fox or badger, they struck
the right note of understated wealth.
   But it was Givenchy's after-dark clothes that were most
intriguing. The gold brocades with fur-edged scooped necks, the
rich ruby and sapphire satin cocktail suits with appliques and
embroidery, the draped floral chiffons in heavenly shades of
violet, yellow, mandarin or royal blue, were fit for a grand
opening.
   Watch for the Greek cross neck pendant. Givenchy showed it in
sparkly rhinestones, but it crops up elsewhere as well. For a more
brazen woman, Givenchy paired up his sharply tailored jackets with
silk-fringed skirts.
   But the dramatic appeal of his peacock satin sheath with jeweled
embroidery at the decollete and sleeves was true to Givenchy's
penchant for women who like to shine at night without looking too
far out.
   Norwegian-born Per Spook's collection featured a colorful
rick-rack-edged wolfskin coat and pointed toque.
   This rick-rack edging on high collars, belts and sleeves gave a
folklore look to a lot of clothes, which featured pants from
skintight toreadors to full short culottes, long, straight trousers
and full harem pants for evening.
   The Spook day clothes had a very Norwegian appeal in brightly
knit patterns on jacquard sweaters, knee socks and caps. But they
smacked more of expensive ready-to-wear than couture.
   Skirts tended to be long and full, and colors ranged from mixes
of the chocolate-coffee browns _ especially good teamed with
robin's egg turquoise _ to hot coral and orange.
   His evening dresses in pleated chiffons, or full-skirted
damasked silk skirts topped by chiffon blouses, were opulent.
   As this year's signature print, Spook chose the Eiffel Tower in
honor of its centennial, throwing it on several outfits from
blouses to coats.
   Among the Italians, Valentino got a big hand for his fitted,
festive day and cocktail clothes, often using his favorite hot red
and fuchsia, although his show finished in a blaze of rich satins
and silks for ball gowns.
   Gianni Versace held a show late Thursday in the Jacquemart-Andre
Museum, featuring his outfits strikingly displayed on headless
dummies.
   There was a good deal of leather, Persian lamb and metal decor
on the handsome truncated mini-outfits and tuxedo-type clothes that
probably looked better on the forms than on most women.
   The glittering underwear shifts topped with dark
flower-embroidered sheer chiffon dressing-gown coats displayed a
cheeky boudoir chic that looked vaguely inspired by Poiret.
   Paris designers don't seem concerned about Italians invading
their turf. Jacques Mouclier, president of the Chambre Syndicale,
the powerful designers' association, said, ``If they want to show
here, that's all right. It means we're still on top in the couture
world.''
   Mouclier has welcomed talented foreigners to Paris, and was not
surprised when three of them _ Japanese Hanae Mori, Italian Angelo
Tarlazzi and Spanish-born Paco Rabanne _ were awarded the Legion of
Honor in July.

   A Senate panel today postponed until next week
a vote on on William Lucas' nomination to be the Justice
Department's civil rights chief after an undecided member said he
wanted to study new information about Lucas.
   Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., whose vote could decide whether or
not the Senate Judiciary Committee endorses Lucas, asked for the
delay because of material ``that has come to my attention in the
last few hours.''
   Heflin did not describe the information, but he later indicated
that if forced to vote today he might not have joined the panel's
Republicans in supporting Lucas to be assistant attorney general
for civil rights.
   ``I'm prepared to vote _ it may not be the way you want me to
vote,'' Heflin told Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., the panel's chairman,
rescheduled the vote for next Tuesday morning, saying there would
be no further delays in committee action on Lucas' nomination.
   Republican supporters of Lucas, a black Republican from Detroit
with a background in law enforcement, voiced concern that a further
delay would likely prevent the full Senate from taking up the
nomination until after its summer recess, which begins Aug. 4.
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., said further delay would only give
Lucas' opponents ``enough time to get out and gin it up.''
   Civil rights groups and other organizations that oppose Lucas
``are waiting to do a number and all they need is time,'' Simpson
said. ``I can just see these self-annointed ones with their phone
banks going goofy in the next five weeks.''
   The delay came a day after Lucas received support from Sen.
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., the only GOP senator whose support for the
nomination was in doubt.
   Specter, dismissing opponents' arguments that Lucas lacked the
legal qualifications for the job, said:
   ``It's more important to have someone who understands Supreme
Court decisions from personal experience, knows it so to speak in
his gut, as opposed to someone who knows where to put all the
commas and semicolons.''
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., is leaning toward voting in
favor of Lucas but his position is not final. Heflin, who has not
taken a position, had been considered the biggest question mark
among committee members.
   If Heflin joined DeConcini and the six Republicans in supporting
Lucas, the nomination would go to the Senate with a favorable
recommendation.
   However, the nomination could still go to the full Senate
without any recommendation from the panel, or an unfavorable
recommendation if Heflin votes against confirmation.
   Lucas, 61, a lifelong Democrat who joined the GOP in 1985, was
sheriff and later chief executive of Wayne County, which includes
Detroit. He ran unsuccessfully for Michigan governor as a
Republican in 1986.
   Outside the committee room, Heflin refused to disclose the
nature of the new information, saying ``the allegations are not
substantiated.''
   ``It's just something that ought to be explored,'' he added.
``It may not be worth a line in print on page 56. I don't know
whether it's serious or not.''
   Heflin expressed concern about a number of items on Lucas'
record, saying he discussed ``a couple of them'' with President
Bush during a telephone call today in which the president solicited
his vote for Lucas.
   ``I told him I would give his request deep consideration,''
Heflin said.
   Heflin also said he wanted to review ``a great number of
different instances'' on Lucas' record before making up his mind.
   These included a contempt-of-court citation against Lucas for
failure to improve jail conditions when he was sheriff and a $594
fine he paid to the U.S. Customs Service for failing to fully
report $8,884 worth of merchandise he and his his family bought
during a trip to the Far East, Heflin said.
   ``This customs matter is a serious matter,'' Heflin said. The
senator said it appeared that information about the customs
incident ``was not available to the president at the time he made
the nomination.''
   David Runkel, spokesman for Attorney General Dick Thornburgh,
said, ``We remain confident that Mr. Lucas will be confirmed by the
Senate.''
   ``If Senator Heflin needs more time... we will be cooperative
with the senator,'' Runkel said, adding that the department and
Lucas will respond to any questions that Heflin wants to raise.

<TEXT>
   Nissan Motor Co. management on Thursday welcomed
the defeat of an attempt to unionize its Tennessee plant, while
Japanese unions, which were not part of the organizing effort
there, said they respected the workers' vote.
   American workers at Nissan's Smyrna, Tenn., automobile plant
voted to reject a campaign by the United Auto Workers to unionize
their factory.
   A Nissan spokesman said the vote showed that workers appreciated
``participatory management practices.'' The spokesman, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Nissan planned to expand production at
Smyrna and hire 2,000 more employees.
   Analysts said the defeat of the UAW, after a failed attempt to
unionize a Honda plant in Ohio, was likely to encourage
manufacturing investment in the United States by Japanese companies
wary of unions.
   ``Japanese companies have an allergy to U.S.-style unions. A
resounding victory by the union might have discouraged further
investment,'' said Stephen Marvin, an automobile industry analyst
at Jardine Fleming securities in Tokyo. In Japan, unions are
generally organized by the company rather than industry, wage
demands are moderate, and strikes are rare. In 1987, the United
States lost 16 times more workdays to strikes than did Japan.
   The union of Nissan workers in Japan and the Confederation of
Japan Automobile Workers' Unions, the main auto industry labor
group, had not participated in the UAW 18-month attempt to unionize
the Tennessee plant.
   Although some Japanese union officials expressed disappointment
with the defeat, the confederation said it respected the vote.
   ``The UAW was not able to reach its objective this time but we
anticipate it will be able to make continued efforts to organize in
a peaceful manner, not only at Smyrna,'' but at the U.S. plants of
other Japanese firms in the United States, the statement said.
   Critics of Japanese unions say they are weak, while other
analysts say they preserve workers' rights by focusing on the
long-term health of their companies rather than wage increases.
   The Japanese philosophy of management-worker cooperation has
resulted in job security for full-time auto workers but relatively
low wages and long working hours.
   Japanese unions engaged in often violent disputes in the 1950s,
but since then, management and workers generally have agreed on
restraint by both sides _ companies don't fire workers in hard
times, and workers don't demand big pay increases even in good
times.
   ``When workers calculate wage demands, they think first of all
of their company's ability to compete with other companies. Each
employee tries to make a judgment as if he were the president of
the company,'' says Kenichi Kobayashi, professor of economics at
Hosei University.
   Although Nissan's profits grew 121 percent in the year ending in
March, workers won wage increases of only 4.8 percent in this
spring's negotiations.
   But when Nissan lost $58 million in fiscal 1986, there were no
layoffs of full-time workers and employees received a 3.03 percent
pay raise.
   In this year's negotiations, Japanese auto makers granted an
average wage increase of 5.13 percent, resulting in an average
yearly salary of $31,428, including bonuses but not overtime.
   Union membership in all industries in Japan is at an all-time
low of 27 percent of workers, while the rate in the United States
is even lower at 17.5 percent, according to the Labor Ministry.
But, while the UAW has seen membership decline 33 percent in 10
years, the Japanese confederation's membership has been growing in
recent years and now stands at 730,000.

   A Korean Air DC-10 with 199 people aboard crashed in
heavy fog today short of the runway at Tripoli airport in Libya,
hitting homes and cars and bursting into flames. At least 82 people
were killed, including four on the ground, officials and news
reports said.
   Libya's official JANA news agency said the crash, the second in
eight days of a DC-10, occurred at 7:30 a.m. (1:30 a.m. EDT). The
cause was not immediately known.
   The pilot was quoted as saying visibility was poor. About an
hour earlier, a Soviet jetliner rerouted to Malta rather than land
in the fog.
   ``Early reports from Tripoli indicate that weather may have been
a contributing factor,'' said James Reed, a spokesman in Washington
for McDonnell Douglas Corp., which manufactures DC-10s.
   The Korean Broadcasting System quoted South Korea's consul in
Tripoli, Chang Kyung-soo, as saying the plane attempted a belly
landing, but this could not be confirmed.
   KBS also said the pilot reported engine trouble, but the airline
did not confirm this.
   The jet crashed into an orchard about 1.5 miles from the runway,
cartwheeled 400 yards, broke into pieces and caught fire, Chang
said.
   On July 19, a United Air Lines DC-10 crashed in Sioux City,
Iowa, killing 111 people, after the tail engine blew apart and cut
off the flow of hydraulic fluid needed to steer the plane.
   A diplomat at the South Korean Embassy in Tripoli, who
identified himself as First Secretary Mr. Chun, said in a telephone
interview that 78 people on the plane were killed.
   JANA reported that in addition, four people died on the ground
when the jet slammed into two houses.
   Tripoli hospitals were reportedly treating 113 victims, and 66
were in ``good condition'' and would be released within hours.
Eight people were treated and released, the agency reported.
   One of the survivors, Kwon Hyuk-hwi of South Korea, told Korean
television the plane crashed shortly after the pilot announced it
was about to land.
   ``Instantly there was a crushing impact, and then came shrieks
by horrified people. I kept my body as low as possible and lost
consciousness,'' said Kwon. He said the tail hit the roof of a
farmhouse and the front section rammed the top of a concrete wall
around the farm.
   Chang told the television the accident site was strewn with
charred bodies and debris.
   Airline officials in Seoul said 189 of the 199 aboard were South
Koreans. The rest were Japanese and Libyans.
   Government officials in Seoul said there were no signs the jet
was the target of terrorism, as was a Korean Air flight that
crashed in 1987.
   Italian television showed the plane's tail sticking up from the
rubble of a house. Hundreds of rescue workers carried away bodies
as firefighters hosed down the smoldering wreckage.
   Korean television showed a large bulldozer moving debris and
charred wreckage spewed over a wide area. One of the engines lay in
a crater.
   JANA said the plane also hit cars on a road near the airport,
which is about a 40-minute drive from the Libyan capital.
   Korean Air in Seoul said Flight 803 left the South Korean
capital Wednesday evening with stops in Bangkok, Thailand, and
Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, en route to Tripoli.
   Korean Broadcasting System said many of the Koreans aboard were
workers for Daewoo Corp. and Donga Construction Co., which have
projects in Libya.
   Airline officils quoted the plane's captain, Kim Ho-jung, 54, as
saying: ``The airport was shrouded in a dense fog and visibility
was poor when I approached. I lost contact with the control tower
for 15 minutes before the crash.''
   JANA said the airport control tower told Kim the visibility was
only 800 feet. A Soviet Aeroflot airliner, informed of similar
conditions about an hour earlier, decided to land instead in Malta,
said a JANA editor, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The DC-10 crashed 25 minutes before it was scheduled to land.
   Reed said McDonnell Douglas' efforts to obtain information about
the crash were hampered because the United States has no diplomatic
representatives in Libya.
   Korean Air is a privately owned national flag carrier and the
largest of two Korean airlines. It said the DC-10 was purchased in
January 1977.
   Formerly known as Korean Air Lines, the airline's Flight 007 was
shot down over Soviet air space by Soviet fighters on Sept. 1,
1983, killing 269 people.
   On Nov. 29, 1987, 115 people died when a Korean Air flight from
Baghdad, Iraq, to Seoul was lost over the Andaman Sea near Burma.
South Korea charged North Korea with placing a bomb on the plane. A
North Korean agent was sentenced to death in connection with the
incident earlier this year.

   A Canadian patrol boat chased an American fishing
boat all night after allegedly spotting the scalloper filling its
nets in Canadian waters, the Coast Guard said today.
   The New Bedford ship, the Bountiful, stopped briefly this
morning off Nantucket, after the Canadian vessel broke off its
140-mile pursuit and then headed in to port, officials said.
   The Canadian government denied the patrol boat Cygnus permission
to fire warning shots across the Bountiful's bow after the American
fishing vessel allegedly rammed it Wednesday afternoon, the Coast
Guard said.
   Coast Guard officials said they planned to board the Bountiful
when it docked, and Petty Officer 1st Class Greg Creedon said
representatives from the National Marine Fisheries Service also
would investigate.
   ``We're interested in talking with the vessel to find out what
exactly happened and collect documentation,'' he said.
   The Bountiful was allegedly seven nautical miles into Canadian
fishing waters, about 165 miles east of Nantucket, when it was
spotted by the Cygnus Wednesday, the Coast Guard said.
   The U.S. territorial limit is 12 miles from shore.
   Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Jack Mason said about 10 U.S.
fishing boats have been accused of poaching in Canadian waters this
year.
   Such incidents are on the rise because fishing stocks on the
U.S. side of the U.S.-Canadian fisheries line are being depleted
and the Canadians are aggressively patrolling their waters, he said.
   One New Bedford boat was pursued by the Canadians for 14 hours
recently, and last year, Canadian patrols fired on another New
Bedford scalloper, the Donna Lynn, after its captain refused to let
officials board. The American skipper claimed the boat was in U.S.
waters.
   With tensions mounting, the State Department on Monday invited
Canadian diplomats to meet in Washington next week to resolve the
tense disputes between the fishermen and the patrol boats.
   Petty Officer Ellen Marie Harrington said the service radioed
the Bountiful advising it to stop for its own safety, but the
fishing boat did not respond.
   Once inside the 12 miles, Mason said, a Coast Guard cutter would
``escort'' the Bountiful to New Bedford, where it would be boarded
and inspected. If the vessel were found to have been fishing
illegally, it could be fined and its permit lifted.
   The Canadian boat was allowed to pursue the Bountiful into the
200-mile U.S. exclusive economic zone.
   Mason identified the Bountiful's owner as Edward Perry of New
Bedford.

   A woman wants to know who lounged on her couch,
messed up the bathroom, washed the linens, did the dishes and rang
up $1,600 worth of credit card charges while she was out of town.
   The woman, who asked not to be identified, spent two weeks out
of town on business and got her first hint that something was wrong
before she even returned home. She got a message that her credit
card was being used excessively, even though she had left it in her
dresser.
   A few days later, the credit card company said $1,600 in new
charges, mostly to a telephone sex-talk company in California, had
put her card over its limit, she said.
   Concerned that someone had broken into her apartment, she asked
a neighbor to check the doors and windows. Everything looked OK, he
told her.
   When she got home Tuesday, the door was locked and ``at first,
everything looked all right,'' she said. ``But then I started
noticing different things that weren't the way I left them.''
   The door leading to a balcony was open and the air conditioner
was off. The washer, dryer and dishwasher had been used.
   She found black hair in the dryer's lint trap; she has blonde
hair. The pillows on the couch were flattened; she had fluffed them
before leaving.
   Her bed wasn't made the way she makes it. And the mattress pad
had been damaged by someone who had put it through the dryer.
   Police said the unknown visitor must have had a key. The woman
said she hasn't given spare keys to anyone.
   In spite of the charges, she said all her credit cards were
still in her dresser drawer.
   She tried to keep her sense of humor.
   ``At least they left the liquor alone,'' she said. ``And they
must have ordered out, because I didn't leave a thing in the
fridge.''
   And she reached one other conclusion:
   ``It must have been a man, because the bathroom was a disaster.
I don't think any woman would have left it that disgusting.''

   A library's attempt to take the
centerfold out of Playboy magazine by switching to the microfilm
version has run into a problem _ the photos are still there.
   Under pressure by an anti-pornography group, the Grand Rapids
Board of Library Commissioners voted Tuesday to stop buying print
issues of Playboy and subscribe to the microfilmed version. At the
time, members believed the photos were edited out of the microfilm
version.
   But board President Jeanette Hayes said Wednesday the adult

   The Michigan Decency Action Council had fought to make the

   ``Even with the photos, (the microfilm version) still is

<HEAD>Senate OKs $44.3 Billion Agriculture Bill Dropping Export Cap</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate moved on Thursday to boost federal
spending above President Bush's request on a range of domestic food
programs and prodded the government to do a more aggressive job of
monitoring food labeling.
   In approving a $44.3 billion agriculture spending bill for
fiscal 1990, the Senate also agreed to remove a cap on subsidies
the government pays to commodity exporters.
   Bush wants the subsidy ceiling eliminated, arguing that it
hinders American efforts to win concessions at trade talks with the
European Economic Community. But the House has already voted to
retain the cap, with opponents saying increasing the spending would
merely benefit mammoth grain export firms.
   Senate passage of the bill, on a voice vote, means that senators
must now reconcile their legislation with the $42.1 billion version
of the measure that the House approved on July 18.
   The measure is one of the 13 annual appropriations bills for
federal agencies. Fiscal 1990 begins Oct. 1.
   The Senate would expand federal spending for an assortment of
domestic food assistance programs to $18.8 billion, $1.5 billion
more than Bush sought in the budget he sent Congress in February
and $2 billion above 1989 levels.
   This includes $4.9 billion for child nutrition programs, about
the same as Bush's request; $2.1 billion for food aid to women,
infants and children, $200 million above Bush's figure; and $15.4
billion for food stamps, $1.3 billion above the Bush number.
   A report approved with the bill also directs the Food and Drug
Administration to ``move forward'' with clarifying the meanings of
``natural,'' ``low-fat,'' ``lite,'' and other terms food producers
commonly place on their labels.
   The report criticized the FDA for ``the slow pace and the mixed
signals'' the agency has exhibited with its work on food labeling.
   However, the report did not address the controversy over red dye
No. 3, the food coloring that is considered a potential carcinogen.
In its measure, the House ordered the government to refrain from
banning the food coloring until long-range studies of the dye's
health effects are completed.
   Report language is not legally binding. Agencies must take such
commands seriously, however, or risk antagonizing lawmakers who can
retaliate against offending bureaucrats in future bills.
   The export subsidy cap _ which this year limits payments from
the Export Enhancement Program to $770 million _ was first imposed
by Congress last year.
   The bill provides $11.6 billion for rural development and
assistance programs, $200 million above Bush's request.
   The Commodity Credit Corp., the Agriculture Department agency
that distributes price and income support payments to farmers,
would get $4.8 billion, the same as Bush's request and $4 billion
below this year's level. The savings arise from higher commodity
prices _ which drive down federal aid _ and changes in the law.
   The bill also sets aside $57 million for AIDS research by FDA,
$17 million above this year's level.
   As he has said he will do on all 13 appropriations bills, Sen.
David Pryor, D-Ark., offered an amendment limiting the money the
government can spend for consultants, of whom he has long been
critical. His provision, adopted on a voice vote, limits the
Agriculture Department to spending $47.3 million next year to hire
private contractors to conduct studies and do other agency work.

   Chanting, flag-waving protesters forced an
adjournment of a City Council meeting, and a woman was knocked to
the floor when she was caught in a scuffle between security guards
and one of the protesters.
   Mayor Annette Strauss gaveled the meeting to an end after about
a dozen demonstrators marched to the lectern, waving miniature U.S.
flags and chanting, ``We want justice.''
   The demonstrators represent a group opposed to an Aug. 12 ballot
proposal to elect 10 council members from single-member districts,
four from quadrants of the city, and the mayor at-large.
   As the mayor stepped onto an elevator, a protester tried to
block the doors. Geoffrey Staples said he was trying to keep the
doors from closing, but was pushed away by security guards who were
ushering the mayor out.
   Frances Penn, 76, was caught in the fracas and apparently was
knocked to the floor by Staples. Staples said he was pushed into
the woman by security guards.
   The woman was escorted out of City Hall by a paramedic, but she
declined medical treatment.

<TEXT>
   A group of top Democratic senators said today
they have reached agreement on a $330 million package of public
service programs that should be ready for floor action next week.
   The varied plan would offer public service opportunities to
Americans of all ages, with rewards and incentives ranging from
academic credit to vouchers for down payments on homes or for
higher education.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Labor and
Human Resources Committee, said at least 10 service bills had been
introduced this year in the Senate. The consensus measure
``includes the best features of all the bills, and the price tag is
within realistic constraints,'' he said.
   Kennedy said he expects his committee to send the bill to the
floor next week and anticipates action by the end of the year.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called the
compromise bill a significant step and said the concept has support
from Republicans as well as Democrats. ``We will work with our
Republican colleagues, our colleagues in the House and with the
White House'' to pass it, he said.
   Key elements of the package include:
   _$100 million for school and college-based opportunities for
young people to serve their communities.
   _$100 million for youth service corps programs modeled after the
conservation corps already established in many states.
   _$100 million for a program giving education and housing
vouchers to people who participate in full-time or part-time
community service.
   _$10 million to expand VISTA.
   _$20 million to expand volunteer programs for senior citizens
under the Older Americans Act.
   The bill contains elements of proposals by Sens. Kennedy, Sam
Nunn, D-Ga.; Charles Robb, D-Va.; Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.;
Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.; Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.; Bob Graham,
D-Fla.; and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
   One component missing from the package was Nunn's original
proposal to make student financial aid contingent on a full-time
public service stint. The bill he introduced with Robb envisioned
phasing out current forms of student aid in five years.
   The idea generated a storm of controversy among Democrats and
Republicans alike, many of whom said it would penalize low-income
students while allowing the affluent to escape service obligations
and proceed directly with their educations.
   Nunn said today that parts of the compromise bill constitute an
experimental version of his plan and he has not given up hope of
eventually making national service the principal means of getting
student aid.
   ``I haven't dropped my original thinking on the subject, but I
do think we ought to go slowly and determine what works,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Six months after Ronald Reagan left the White
House, historians and political scientists _ asked to guess how
history will rate his presidency _ rank him in the middle, between
great and dreadful.
   Calvin Coolidge's name keeps coming up in comparison.
   ``Coolidge was strong for keeping things from being done,'' says
Lewis Gould, a University of Texas historian.
   He also says Reagan ``has elements of FDR in his ability to
communicate.'' But he thinks that ultimately Reagan will wind up
``in the middle or lower-middle ranks.''
   Frank Freidel, professor emeritus at both Harvard and the
University of Washington and a biographer of Franklin D. Roosevelt,
doesn't draw the FDR analogy. Instead, he compares Reagan to Dwight
Eisenhower.
   ``If I had to rank him right now, I would rank him as high as
Dwight Eisenhower,'' says Freidel, 73. ``Both were total charmers.
Both clung to the same sort of small-town Middle Western verities.
Both were men of principle. Both to a certain extent were hands-off
presidents.''
   Eisenhower biographer Fred Greenstein of Princeton University,
on the other hand, said Ike never had a scandal like Iran-Contra
and never had his weaknesses laid bare in kiss-and-tell books like
those that have come out about Reagan.
   ``I don't think he'll be rated high on competence,'' says
Greenstein, who compares Reagan to scandal-singed Ulysses Grant _
``someone who had substantial public support but left a rather
messy legacy.''
   Political scientist Thomas Cronin of Colorado College says
Reagan ``will have to be judged as having made a consequence.'' He
gives the former president top grades for his ceremonial roles ``as
the national cheerleader, the national chaplain; he was able to
rally the American spirit.''
   On the other hand, Reagan ``was insensitive to women's rights,
civil rights, oblivious to what was going on in his own
administration _ the procurement scandle, HUD, Iran-Contra,''
Cronin says. `'An ethical sleaze characterised his administration;
it seems a reincarnation of the Warren Harding attitude.''
   ``Great? It's hard to say whether he'll be great,'' says Henry
Graff, a Columbia Univesity historian.
   ``We'll see what happens to the economy. He'll get high marks
for having been on watch when the cold war began to peter out. For
all the bravado and macho style, he'll be remembered as one of the
peacemakers.''
   Reagan was a hands-off, chairman-of-the-board type president,
says Donald McCoy of the University of Kansas, a Coolidge
biographer and one historian who does not draw the Coolidge
parallel.
   ``As chairman of the board, he wasn't terrific at it but on the
other hand he wasn't a failure, either,'' McCoy says. ``What shall
we say? So-so, average, fair.''
   Reagan's place will be determined by events yet to happen,
several historians say.
   ``If Russia doesn't explode and Gorbachev continues his program
of perestroika and glasnost, Ronald Reagan will have a very
signficant place in history,'' says Freidel.
   Adds political scientist Charles Dunn of Clemson University:
``Reagan's reputation historically will fly upon the wings of
Gorbachev and Bush.''
   Some of those interviewed said historians and political
scientists tend to be harder on presidents than the general public.
John F. Kennedy, for example, still ranks high in public esteem but
Kennedy, according to Gould ``is sinking among historians with
almost every passing year.''
   Others noted that historians tend to be liberals _ and so may be
rougher on Reagan than the public at large.
   A number of the specialists said Reagan's reputation has dimmed
since he left Washington, partly because the scandal at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development underscored that Reagan
did not pay close attention.
   ``I frankly have been surprised that he has gone down as much as
he has in six months,'' says Gould. ``That we have another
president who has done reasonably well sort of overshadows Reagan.''
   ``His positive contributions _ revitalizing the presidency,
turning the country to the right, peace and, for six of the eight
years, prosperity and, to some extent, ending the cold war _ these
have already been discounted,'' Gould adds. ``Now I suspect the
negatives will come into play.''
   But Philip Rulon, history professor at Northern Arizona
University in Flagstaff _ and a self-described liberal Democrat _
credits Reagan with having ``saved the presidency'' after a string
of failed presidencies going back to Kennedy.
   Whatever Reagan's policy shortcomings, Rulon says, ``He made
people respect the president again. He was a great Irish wit. He
had grace and style. He is a communicator and a man of integrity
and he preserved the office.''

<HEAD>Castro Paints Gloomy Picture of Anti-Communist Plots</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAMAGUEY, Cuba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was a rainy, gloomy evening and
President Fidel Castro seemed in a kindred mood, speaking of
``inhuman'' American capitalists bent on a new colonialism, and of
possible civil war in the Soviet Union.
   This is the national holiday week that celebrates the beginning
of the revolution in 1953, a time of picnics, parties, dancing and
drinking.
   Castro's two-hour message Wednesday, delivered in rain that
soaked him to the skin the week before his 63rd birthday, was more
appropriate for a wake.
   He told the tens of thousands crowded into Camaguey's main plaza
the United States was like Adolf Hitler's Germany, ``dreaming about
an empire of 1,000 years.''
   Cubans must prepare for a war of attrition, total blockade, even
invasion and occupation, he said.
   The specter of civil war haunts the Soviet Union and Cubans
should not be surprised to wake up some morning and find that their
powerful ally had disintegrated, Castro declared.
   Castro told his listeners placards saying ``The best communist
is a dead communist'' appeared in crowds during President Bush's
visit to Poland. They applauded when he called the sentiment
``fascist,'' and said enemies ``should know that we communists
won't let ourselves be killed easily.''
   It would serve young Poles right, he said, if they had a chance
to taste the ``egotistical, brutal and inhuman'' capitalist system.
   If communism collapses, he said, the United States and other
``imperialist powers'' will try to divide up the world and
``recolonialize'' it, sharing out its resources and people among
themselves.
   More than an hour of his speech was devoted to reciting social
and economic progress his revolution has brought the agricultural
region around Camaguey, 300 miles east of Havana.
   The city was chosen as the site for his annual speech on the
date in 1953 when he led an attack on a military barracks that
began the guerrilla war. Dictator Fulgencio Batista fled the island
on Jan. 1, 1959.
   Castro opened his speech by lavishing praise on his listeners
for their volunteer spirit and devotion to communist principles,
then launched his atack on the United States.
   He accused Bush of undertaking visits to Poland and Hungary more
as a conquerer than a friend. That prompted Jay Taylor, the chief
U.S. envoy to Cuba, to walk out of the diplomatic section.
   After making the comparison with Nazi Germany, Castro said the
strike of Soviet coal miners had ``filled the imperialists with
joy,'' and the collapse of the Soviet Union was an ``imperialist
dream.''
   Cuban officials had expected Castro to comment on the corruption
scandal that began last month and led to the execution of a

   American inspectors watched the Soviet Union
destroy the last of its 718 SS-12 shorter-range nuclear missiles in
Saryozek, Kazakhstan, the Pentagon said Thursday.
   The destruction took place under the terms of the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, which went into effect in
June 1988. The treaty requires that each side conduct on-site
inspections of each other's eliminations.
   The Soviet Union has notified the United States that it will
begin elimination of its other shorter-range missile, the SS-23
Spider on Aug. 17.
   The United States destroyed the last of its shorter-range
missiles, the Pershing 1A, on July 6 at Longhorn Army Ammunition
Plant in Texas.
   Under the treaty, the shorter-range missiles, which travel
between 500 kilometers and 1,000 kilometers, must be eliminated by
Nov. 30, 1989.
   The intermediate range weapons, with ranges of between 1,000
kilometers and 5,000 kilometers, must be destroyed by May 31, 1991.

<HEAD>Rafsanjani Set For Victory in Presidential Poll</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani
appeared set to win presidential elections Friday and was reported
to be already assembling a Cabinet to govern the Islamic republic
in the post-Khomeini era.
   Iran's religious and political leaders Thursday called for a big
voter turnout to demonstrate unity following Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's death June 3.
   But their exhortations also appeared aimed at securing a big
vote of confidence in Khomeini's heirs.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said millions of
Iranians are expected to vote in the presidential ballot and a
national referendum on proposed constitutional amendments to give
the presidency new powers. Khomeini urged the changes to eliminate
competing power centers that have paralyzed the government.
   Officials said 26,000 polling stations will open at 7 a.m. They
are scheduled to close at 5 p.m., but IRNA said they may stay open
until midnight.
   There was no word when results will be announced. Nor was there
any official figure for Iran's electorate. But it was estimated at
25 million, about half the population, during parliamentary
elections last year.
   Iranian leaders and the state media for days have been
frantically exhorting Iranians to vote to prove the nation is
united behind the leadership.
   ``Each vote cast is a bullet fired at the heart of Iran's
enemies,'' the radical Jomhuri Islami daily stressed this week.
   Iran's three grand ayatollahs, or senior religious leaders,
joined the chorus Thursday.
   Ayatollah Mohammad Ali Araki said voting is ``a religious duty
for every Iranian.''
   But one disgruntled merchant, who declined to be identified,
said: ``Why bother to vote? Rafsanjani has been part of the
government for years and he's responsible with the other clerics
for mess the economy's in.''
   Newspapers report unanimously that Rafsanjani, 55, is certain to
become Iran's fourth president. Their polls predict he will win 86
percent of the vote.
   The only challenger is former Agriculture Minister Abass
Sheibani, 58, who is considered little more than a cosmetic
candidate so that Rafsanjani is not seen to be elected unopposed.
   The elections were moved up from Aug. 18 to accelerate the
transition of power following the death of Khomeini, who founded
the fundamentalist republic in 1979 when he overthrew the late Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
   Incumbent President Ali Khamenei's second four-year term expires
Oct. 5 and the ayatollah cannot run for a third term. He was
elected Iran's spiritual leader to succeed Khomeini on June 4.
   Khamenei is allied with Rafsanjani, who heads the ``pragmatist
faction.'' They are expected to open up the economy, which radicals
have kept under tight reins, and to build bridges with the West,
although that could take time.
   Rafsanjani appears so confident he has not bothered campaigning
beyond a few interviews in which he stressed he will ``follow
Khomeini's path'' and make his top priority solving economic woes
multiplied by the eight-year war with Iraq.
   There were few signs of electioneering in Tehran's tree-lined
avenues. Posters showing Khomeini voting in last year's
parliamentary elections outnumbered those of Rafsanjani. Reporters
saw no posters of Sheibani.
   Diplomatic sources say Rafsanjani already has lined up a Cabinet
to include economists and technocrats, some dumped from earlier
administrations because of ideological and policy differences.

   The military services met their recruiting
objectives for the first half of fiscal 1989, but the percentage of
recruits with high school diplomas dropped slightly, the Pentagon
said Thursday.
   ``Recruiting and re-enlistment results ... clearly show the
services are experiencing a tougher recruiting climate,'' David J.
Berteau, deputy assistant secretary of defense, said in a statement.
   Some 90 percent of the recruits had high school diplomas,
compared with 92 percent in the same time period last year, he said.
   So far in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, 1988, 64 percent of
the enlistees had high school diplomas and scored in the top half
on the Armed Forces Aptitude Test. This is a decrease of 4
percentage points from the same period in fiscal 1988.
   ``Quality trends reflect higher employment, a shrinking youth
population, higher recruiting goals and declining value of
recruiting incentives,'' Berteau said.

<HEAD>Standards Set For Airport Security Screening Personnel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security personnel who screen bags and
passengers for U.S. airlines will have to meet tougher standards
under a plan adopted by airline security officials, an industry
spokesman said Thursday.
   Security directors of major airlines approved new hiring and
training standards for screening personnel after meetings at the
Air Transport Association headquarters this week, said ATA
spokesman Tim Neale.
   Airlines are expected to follow the standards when contracts
with security companies come up for renewal. Airlines, either
individually or in groups, hire other companies to provide
personnel who screen baggage and passengers at airport checkpoints.
   ATA estimates 10,000 screening personnel work at about 1,500
security points in the nation's airports.
   The new guidelines require that workers be at least 18 years
old, high school graduates and English-speaking U.S. citizens and
that they pass drug and aptitude tests and have no criminal
convictions.
   The plan also calls for a uniform training program for screening
personnel who often earn little more than the minimum wage. The
training program and a program that will train trainers are being
drawn up and will be ready by the end of the summer, said Neale.
   The Federal Aviation Administration has put increased pressure
on airlines to improve security at airport checkpoints by imposing
fines of up to $10,000 when agents are able to smuggle through mock
weapons. The FAA has levied more than $5 million in fines and says
security has improved.
   Neale said the airlines conduct their own tests of the system
and are proud of the high rate of detection.
   A spokesman for one of the largest agencies which handles
checkpoints at about 100 airports, Wackenhut of Coral Gables, Fla.,
said the company supports the new standards although they may make
it slightly harder to find qualified personnel.
   The spokesman, Patrick Cannan, said industry-wide standards are
needed, because companies with lower hiring requirements sometimes
are able to underbid those with stricter standards.
   He said Wackenhut security personnel generally meet all the new
requirements, although sometimes exceptions are made for employees
without high school degrees if they can pass tests that show
equivalent knowledge and skills. He said contracts with airlines
likely would contain grandfather clauses that would retain
nongraduates who meet other qualifications.

<HEAD>Soldiers Capture Prominent Leader of Communist Insurgency</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers captured one of the
Philippines' most prominent communist leaders Thursday, and
officials hailed the arrest as a major setback to the 20-year
Marxist insurgency.
   Satur Ocampo, suspected member of the ruling Politburo of the
banned Communist Party of the Philippines and head of the National
Democratic Front, was arrested with his common-law wife, Carolina
Malay, in suburban Makati, the military said.
   Military officials said the two would be charged with
subversion. Ocampo may also face murder and kidnapping charges in
connection with the deaths of scores of rebels during a recent
purge, the military added.
   Ocampo and Ms. Malay, both 50-year-old former journalists,
served as negotiators for the rebels during peace talks with
President Corazon Aquino's government. The talks collapsed in
January 1987.
   At a news conference after his arrest, Ocampo said he and Ms.
Malay were riding in their car when another vehicle cut them off.
Three pistol-wielding soldiers then jumped from the car and
arrested them, he said.
   Seeking to publicize arrests, the military and law enforcement
officials frequently allow those arrested in major cases to talk to
the news media.
   Officials said troops had followed Ocampo and Ms. Malay as they
left their home near the International School, attended by children
of foreign diplomats and businessmen. The caretaker of the house
said the two had been living there since May 3.
   Last week, the military offered a $47,600 reward for Ocampo and
$23,800 for Ms. Malay. Military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa
said a civilian informant helped in the arrests, but he had no
further details.
   Mrs. Aquino congratulated the military and hailed the captures
as an ``outstanding feat.'' She has vowed to crush the rebellion by
the end of her term in 1992.
   ``The capture is a breakthrough, particularly in terms of
further weakening the insurgency,'' said deputy presidential
spokesman Noel Tolentino.
   As head of the National Democratic Front, Ocampo was in charge
of the party's efforts to organize supporters among students,
farmers, clerics, teachers and others.
   The Front is an umbrella organization of 12 Marxist groups,
including the Communist Party of the Philippines and its armed
wing, the New People's Army.
   Ocampo was formerly assistant business editor of The Manila
Times. He was arrested for subversion in 1976 but fled in May 1985.
He was the country's longest-serving political prisoner at the time
of his escape.
   During the peace talks, Ocampo appeared on television and radio
programs, espousing the communist cause. After a 60-day cease-fire
expired in February 1987, he gave frequent interviews and press
statements on behalf of the rebels.
   Four days ago, Ocampo renewed offers of new peace talks if Mrs.
Aquino agreed to close the six U.S. military bases here in 1991.
   Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, chief of the Philippine Constabulary,
said Ocampo's capture was the ``beginning of the end'' of the
rebellion and would hamper the rebel propaganda campaign.
   But Ocampo said his arrest would have little effect on the
insurgency.
   ``The organization is a big one,'' Ocampo said. ``Previously,
supposed known leaders had also been captured. This has not caused
a big dent. There is a long, wide bench with responsible comrades
who would take over.''
   The military claims to have captured about 10 Central Committee
members since Mrs. Aquino took power in 1986 although one of them,
Romulo Kintanar, has since escaped.
   The government justifies the continued hunt for communist rebels
by saying they should have stopped subversive activities after
democracy was restored with the ousting of President Ferdinand
Marcos.
   The movement's base is in the impoverished rural areas, where 70
percent of the 58 million Filipinos live.
   Government figures show that despite economic gains under Mrs.
Aquino, the poorest third of Filipino society controls only 9
percent of the national income, virtually no change from the final
years of the Marcos administration.

   A man who took the ``People's Court'' to the
real thing has emerged victorious with a court commissioner's order
that the TV show pay him $1,500.
   ``Our reaction is the same as some of the reactions of the
people who walk out of our courtroom _ disbelief,'' said Phillip
Vandervort, associate producer of the show.
   Louis DeGeorge, 62, took ``People's Court'' to small claims
court last week, claiming he was misled when he agreed to appear on
the show in February.
   DeGeorge said he was told that despite whatever ruling
``People's Court'' Judge Joseph Wapner made he would receive a $250
appearance fee plus the $1,500 in damages he was seeking from his
former apartment house manager.
   But ``People's Court'' policy is to guarantee damage payments
only to litigants who win their cases, Vandervort argued.
   Wapner, a retired Superior Court judge whose word is the law on
the 8-year-old TV show, ruled in February that DeGeorge failed to
prove that the apartment manager's 11-year-old son smashed a mirror
on his pickup truck.
   Los Angeles Municipal Court Commissioner Linda Elliott ruled
Ralph Edwards Productions misrepresented its payment policy.
   The show was ordered to pay the $1,500 and DeGeorge's $26 court
costs.
   ``I was elated,'' said DeGeorge, who learned of the ruling by
mail Tuesday. ``They are big shots in the movie industry and
television industry, so this was really like David against
Goliath.''
   DeGeorge played for Ms. Elliott a taped message left on his
answering machine by a ``People's Court'' researcher, Richard
Velasquez.
   Velasquez, who no longer works for the show, promised ``a
guaranteed $1,500 as well as $250'' if DeGeorge appeared on the
show, Elliott ruled.
   ``Richard left out the words, `If you win,''' Vandervort said.
   DeGeorge's victory apparently will stand. Stewart Billett,
executive producer of the show, said there will be no appeal.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national service bill blending several
Democratic proposals should be on its way to the floor next week,
senators said Thursday in announcing the compromise measure.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Labor and
Human Resources Committee, said at least 10 national service bills
ranging in cost from $5 million to $5 billion have been introduced
this year in the Senate.
   The $330 million Democratic consensus package ``includes the
best features of all the bills, and the price tag is within
realistic constraints,'' he said.
   The plan is designed to promote public service among Americans
of all ages, with incentives including academic credit, stipends,
job training, educational aid and a helping hand for first-time
homebuyers.
   Kennedy said his committee is scheduled to complete work on the
bill next week in preparation for floor action after the August
recess.
   Moreover, Kennedy and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, said they hope to achieve a bipartisan measure with Bush
administration support.
   ``We will work with our Republican colleagues, our colleagues in
the House, and with the White House'' to pass national service
legislation, said Mitchell.
   Bush favors a purely voluntary approach to such service without
incentives or stipends and has proposed a $25 million program to
encourage such efforts. But Kennedy and others suggested there may
be some room for compromise as the bill moves through Congress.
   Key elements of the Senate package include:
   _$100 million for school-based opportunities for young people to
serve their communities and for aiding residents, particularly the
elderly, in volunteering in schools.
   _$100 million for full-time or summer youth service corps
programs modeled after the conservation corps already established
in many states. The programs would be open to youth aged 16 to 25,
with stipends of up to $6,200 a year and post-service education and
training benefits of up to $100 a week.
   _$100 million for a civilian service program with education and
housing vouchers ranging from $8,500 a year for full-time
participants to $3,000 a year for three to six years of part-time
service. Full-time participants also would receive a yearly stipend
of $6,200 to $7,000.
   _$10 million to expand the Volunteers in Service to America
(VISTA) program.
   _$20 million to expand volunteer programs for senior citizens
under the Older Americans Act.
   The bill contains elements of proposals by Sens. Kennedy; Sam
Nunn, D-Ga.; Charles Robb, D-Va.; Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.;
Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.; Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.; Bob Graham,
D-Fla., and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
   Nunn and Robb are credited with sparking the national service
debate with their proposal last January to make student financial
aid contingent on a full-time stint in military or community
service. Their bill would have phased out current forms of student
aid in five years.
   Nunn praised the consensus package Thursday and said it could
still lead to his goal of requiring national service in return for
student aid. ``I haven't dropped my original thinking on the
subject, but I do think we ought to go slowly and determine what
works,'' he said.
   Democrats and Republicans alike have criticized the idea of
tying aid to service, with many saying that doing so would penalize
low-income students while allowing the affluent to escape service
obligations and proceed directly with their educations.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has appealed to Turkey
and Bulgaria to negotiate a plan for handling an exodus of ethnic
Turks from Bulgaria that soared to more than 200,000 this week.
   ``Both sides basically agree to talks, but there are hitches.
They must make efforts to close the distance,'' said Albert
Chernichev, the Soviet ambassador to Turkey, on his return
Wednesday from a fourth trip to Moscow in the past month. He is
trying to mediate the dispute.
   In May, Bulgaria began deporting ethnic Turks in the wake of a
government campaign that forced them to adopt Slavic names,
restricted their Moslem rites and banned use of the Turkish
language. There are more than 1 million ethnic Turks in Bulgaria.
   Turkey has mobilized a huge effort to absorb the refugees,
housing thousands in tent camps and pressuring private employers to
give them jobs, despite a nationwide unemployment rate of 16
percent.
   Earlier this week, Britain made a gesture to help Turkey, a NATO
ally, by giving $492,000 to ethnic Turks and Kurdish refugees from
Iraq.
   The Turkish Foreign Ministry said Wednesday the influx had
reached 202,000 and showed no signs of slackening. Thousands have
poured in day and night on foot as well as in cars and train. Some
who walked across the border pulled carts with their possessions.
   Among those arriving Wednesday was a world champion
weightlifter, Erdinc Kasimoglu, the Anatolia news agency reported.
   A Foreign Ministry official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Turkey believed the dispute would not be solved
easily, even with the ambassador's help.
   ``He is mediating, but so far there is no change in the
Bulgarian position, and we are unlikely to change ours,'' the
official said.
   Turkey is demanding that negotiations include an immigration
agreement to protect the legal rights of the ethnic Turks, such as
accumulated social security benefits and compensation for property
left behind. It also calls for restoration of minority rights for
those who choose to remain in Bulgaria.
   Bulgaria has been insisting on an open agenda.
   The Turks, however, say an open agenda would allow talks to drag
on and detract world attention from the urgent problem.
   The Soviet Union, Turkey's northern neighbor, has been beset by
its own ethnic problems. It also has a large ethnic Turkish
population.

   Carla Southwell recalls vividly the 53
days ``of sheer hell'' she spent in a jail cell for refusing to
disclose the whereabouts of her two daughters, who she says were
sexually abused by her former husband.
   Nine months later _ with her contempt-of-court case under appeal
_ she's back with her children but worried the reunion may be
temporary.
   A judge is expected to rule by year's end whether Ms. Southwell
or her former husband, William Southwell, should be granted
permanent custody of the girls, ages 5 and 6.
   Ms. Southwell acknowledges that her earlier defiance may work
against her.
   ``I can't even imagine my kids living with him. It would destroy
these girls,'' she said recently, sitting in her mobile home behind
her parents' rural home. ``As it is, I don't know that they'll ever
fully recover.''
   Ms. Southwell, 27, speaks in a whisper at times as the girls
fight over a Barbie doll a few feet away. Tears well as she talks
about the girls' depression and the distant look they sometimes
have.
   The younger girl repeatedly sweeps her hand over her genital
area, a nervous response Ms. Southwell attributes to the alleged
molestations. Her sister, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, wears
diapers to bed since she began bed-wetting two years ago, after the
alleged abuse began.
   The girls recently have begun seeing a counselor ``because they
seem to need to talk about it, and I don't know how to handle it,''
said Ms. Southwell, who also has a 17-month-old son by her fiance.
They plan to marry when the custody battle ends.
   Women have been jailed in several cities recently for contempt
of court, choosing to serve time rather than submt their children
to what they believe i{ a sentence of abuse.
   In the best-known case, Elizabeth Morgan, a plastic surgeon, has
been jailed since August 1987 in the District of Columbia for
hiding her daughter from court-ordered visits with her father.
Congress is considering legislation that would set a cap on such
jailings.
   In the Southwell case, the girls indicated in a videotape for a
custody hearing last year they had been molested, and a doctor
testified that at least one of the girls had injuries typical of
child abuse.
   An investigation of Southwell, 30, and his younger brother
turned up no evidence of abuse, said Sgt. Ken Kleinheksel of the
Kent County Sheriff's Department.
   ``This is one of the toughest cases I've seen and I feel sorry
for both sides,'' Kleinheksel said. ``But as far as I'm concerned,
the case is closed.''
   Southwell contends the girls were coached by their mother to
make the allegations.
   ``I would kill myself before I would sexually abuse those
children,'' Southwell said Wednesday. ``As far as I'm concerned,
that's about the worst thing a person can do.''
   He said he has a strong relationship with the girls and is
confident he'll win custody. ``They know their dad never hurt them
and that I love them; that's one thing Carla can't take away. When
they're here, they ask if they can stay.''
   Carla Southwell was pregnant when the couple married in 1983.
Less than two years later, they were separated, and they divorced
in 1986. She contends Southwell physically abused her during their
marriage and that ``he didn't even know these kids existed. He was
never around.''
   She said her daughters told her in 1987 their uncle had sexually
abused them on a visit to their father's. Later the allegations
included her former husband, she said.
   She began canceling visits and Southwell went to court seeking
permanent custody. Her request for supervised visitations was
denied, and a family services counselor told the court that unless
Southwell was granted custody he likely would never see the girls.
   Upon learning that custody might go to her former husband, Ms.
Southwell fled with the girls, found them a place to stay and
returned to face court proceedings.
   ``I knew I had to protect my daughters, but I never felt that I
should run away with them for good because I hadn't done anything
wrong,'' she said. ``All I wanted was supervised visitation and him
to get treatment.''
   Kent County Circuit Judge George Buth charged her with contempt
of court and ordered her jailed Sept. 7 until she produced the
children. She was released Oct. 28 when the state Court of Appeals
ordered a stay of the contempt ruling while the case is appealed.
   Since then, Southwell has agreed to supervised visitations until
an independent evaluation of the girls is completed and the judge
rules on custody.

   Mayor James Usry and eight other
present or former public officials were among 14 people charged
today with bribery and corruption.
   Usry, 67, a former Harlem Globetrotter and city teacher, is in
his second term as mayor. The Republican won the job when former
Mayor Michael Matthews was ousted from office in a recall election
after being implicated in an influence peddling scheme involving
casino-zoned land.
   Christopher Florentz, spokesman for the state attorney general,
announced the arrests of 13 of the 14 people this morning. The 14th
person was being sought.
   He said the investigation, which started in November, focused on
allegations that Atlantic City officials accepted bribes in return
for granting approval of exemptions from city rent control
ordinances and favorable rulings by the zoning board.
   They also are accused in the criminal complaint of engaging in
conspiracy to gain control over a lucrative boardwalk electric cart
business and a gift shop franchise at the Atlantic City
International Airport, Florentz said.
   Those arrested were taken to a National Guard Armory, where
authorities would not allow reporters to see them.
   Among those arrested were City Council President Walter
Collette, 60; zoning board Chairman Kaleem Shabazz; city councilman
Arnold Orsatti Jr.; city councilman Gene Dorn, 47; and W. Oscar
Harris Jr., former director of the Atlantic City Housing Authority,
Florentz said.
   The mayor was charged with bribery, conspiracy, official
misconduct and accepting unlawful gifts, Florentz said. Collette
and Dorn were charged with bribery, conspiracy and official
misconduct; Shabazz and Harris with bribery and conspiracy; Orsatti
with official misconduct and conspiracy.
   Usry, Collette and Dorn all were considered likely candidates in
next year's non-partisan mayoral contest.
   Orsatti's attorney, Thomas Vesper, said as he left the armory,
``As far as my client is concerned, it's a mistake.''
   A daughter who answered the telephone at Usry's house said the
family was not taking any calls.
   Usry's family moved to Atlantic City from Athens, Ga., when he
was 6 months old. He graduated from Atlantic City High School in
1939.
   He served in World War II and was a center from 1946 to 1951
with the New York Renaissance, an all-black team that became part
of the world famous Harlem Globetrotters during his tenure.
   He became Atlantic City's assistant superintendent of schools in
1977.
   Usry's initial mayoral victory in 1984 came with the help of the
state and national Republican organizations. The GOP had said
Usry's election would help them gather minority support in the 1984
presidential contest.
   Usry was considered an ally of Republican Gov. Thomas H. Kean.
The governor, vacationing at Fisher Island, N.Y., was informed of
the arrests, said Bob McHugh, a spokesman.
   ``The governor's office has no comment on the matter, and I
don't anticipate one,'' McHugh said.
   Matthews was indicted in 1984 for attempting to take $200,000
from people linked to an organized crime group in southern New
Jersey in exchange for securing land in Atlantic City zoned for
casino operations.
   Matthews pleaded guilty in November 1984 to a single count of
extorting $10,000 from an undercover FBI agent and was sentenced a
month later to 15 years in prison and fined $10,000.

<HEAD>City Sells Municipal Garage By Mistake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City-owned vehicles may need a new home in
this northern Ohio city, which mistakenly sold its municipal garage
and now may have to buy the building back or pay rent.
   The City Council authorized the city safety director and mayor
in April to sell a building adjacent to the garage.
   However, the advertised property appraisal and the deed signed
by the city included the garage in specified measurements and
within the specified property lines.
   ``I knew what we were purchasing on paper,'' said attorney
George Matthewson, who bought the two buildings for $51,555 in May
with his business partner, insurance agent John Andrix.
   The partners have suggested the city buy back just the garage
for $11,000 or rent it for $600 per month.
   They also have offered to make a gift of the garage to the city
in return for a receipt for tax purposes, Matthewson said.
   They've gotten no response from the City Council, which is
seeking legal advice, said Councilwoman Sue Minner.
   Matthewson said he and Andrix didn't want to cause the city
hardship or embarrassment.
   ``I know we're in the right, though,'' he said. ``The appraisal
included it. They advertised it. They just need someone to tell
them that.''
   Minner said the council would like to ``pay as little as we can
for the mistake and get out.''

   Mick Jagger's 46th birthday added to
the trickle of rock fans finding their way here since word got out
the Rolling Stones are in rehearsals for their upcoming tour.
   Heavy security has kept the curious at bay and soundproofing has
kept rehearsal rhythms out of earshot, but the fans kibbitz and
trade stories of the middle-aged rockers.
   There are those who say they've seen Jagger bicycling downtown,
or have heard him commenting on the pizza at the local parlor.
   One man said Jagger looked ``like a college professor'' as he
hopped out of a rented Mercedes Benz limo wearing a jacket and
small, dark glasses, and stepped into another waiting car.
   But most people have seen nothing more than limousines and vans
with out-of-state license plates.
   Cathy Gorham and Nyles Courrhesne, students from Massachusetts,
traveled two hours down from Holyoke to wish Jagger a happy
birthday Wednesday.
   ``We had nothing to do so we thought we'd come down and find
Mick,'' said Gorham, who has tickets for Stones' shows this fall in
Cleveland and Washington, D.C.

   Frank Serpico, the officer who blew the whistle
on police corruption in New York during the 1970s, has inherited
the house of a Georgia man he befriended in Holland.
   The former New York policeman and his attorney, former U.S.
Attorney General Ramsey Clark, were in this north Georgia city
Wednesday to settle the estate of Willem Smits, 56. Smits was
killed in March 1986 after an argument with his female housemate
over a pot of cabbage.
   Serpico served as executor of Smits' estate and is heir to
Smits' rambling brick house, known locally as ``The Castle.'' Rome
lawyer C.H. Hollingsworth said the house will be sold.
   Serpico and Smits became friends in Holland, where Serpico fled
following his 1971 testimony before the Knapp Commission
investigating New York City police corruption.
   Serpico's story was told by author Peter Maas in the
best-selling novel ``Serpico'' and later in a movie by the same
name starring Al Pacino.

   Ines de la Fressange, the high fashion model with a
reported million-dollar contract with Chanel, said Thursday she
missed this week's haute couture show because of a feud with Chanel
designer Karl Lagerfeld.
   Lagerfeld was angered because her face was chosen as the latest
image of ``Marianne,'' an official symbol of France, she told the
daily Le Figaro. Previous Mariannes have included film stars
Brigitte Bardot and Catherine Deneuve.
   The dispute was already public. Last month in the International
Herald-Tribune, Lagerfeld said Marianne was ``the symbol of
everything that is boring, bourgeois and provincial. I have
succeeded in stopping Chanel from being part of the establishment,
identified with the bourgeoisie. Now all that is being handed right
back to me. No thanks!''
   When Miss de la Fressange failed to appear at Tuesday's Chanel
show, for the first time since her exclusive seven-year, reportedly
$1 million a year contract was signed in 1984, the fashion house
said she was ill and resting.
   ``The decision was taken in agreement with Chanel several weeks
ago,'' the 31-year-old model was quoted as saying. ``We agreed to
say I was tired. And it's true I'm sick and tired of all these
trifles.''
   Le Figaro quoted her as saying of Lagerfeld: ``He's an exuberant
man. Maybe he is a little jealous of my success. His German origins
come out sometimes. It's the `Kaiser' side of him.''

<HEAD>Judge Says Teen Was Competent to Choose Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIBERTY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge rejected a convict's argument that
he was mentally incompetent when he pleaded guilty as a teen-ager
to killing a liquor store clerk and asked for the death penalty.
   Clay County Circuit Judge Glennon McFarland refused Wednesday to
set aside the guilty plea and death sentence of Heath Wilkins, who
was 16 when he fatally stabbed Nancy Allen, 26, during the July
1985 robbery at a store in the Kansas City area.
   Wilkins, now 20, has other appeals left, but this was his second
court defeat in a month. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled June 26 that
states can execute murderers who were 16 or 17 at the time of their
crimes.
   McFarland ruled that Wilkins was competent to plead guilty and
request the death sentence. He also said Wilkins was not denied
effective counsel and that none of his constitutional rights was
violated. He said testimony from medical experts for the defense
was not persuasive.
   Public Defender Sean O'Brien said he was not surprised by the
ruling and plans to appeal to the Missouri Court of Appeals. ``He's
essentially saying it's OK for the kid to pull his own plug,'' he
said.
   Prosecutor Michael Reardon said McFarland had initially accepted
the plea and ``he had the opportunity to observe Wilkins and make
his own determination.''
   ``He bent over backward to make sure (Wilkins') rights were
protected,'' Reardon said.

   Chinese pro-democracy activists were in hiding
today because of fears for their safety during a Midwest visit to
attend the first Chinese Students Congress in the United States,
organizers said.
   ``They are in physical danger. They're really hiding,'' Minxin
Pei, a Harvard student and spokesman for the congress, said at a
news conference.
   He cited harassment of Chinese students at U.S. universities by
Chinese officials, including threats delivered in anonymous
telephone calls and a visit to his own apartment by officials from
the consulate in New York who called him a traitor for his
pro-democracy activities and threatened ``big trouble'' if he
persisted.
   The Chinese government ``is capable of anything,'' Pei
contended. ``Accidents do happen in this country. People do
disappear and get hurt.''
   The visiting leaders of China's pro-democracy movement are Wu'er
Kaixi, 21, an organizer of the student demonstrations in Tiananmen
Square, and Yan Jiaqi, 47, former director of the Political Science
Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
   They arrived in Chicago on Wednesday, said Guyang Huang, a
spokesman for the weekend congress. They did not appear at the news
conference, and Pei said he did not know where they could be
reached.
   ``They are honored guests. We want them to arrive safely and
leave safely,'' Pei said in Chinese.
   ``They are our spiritual leaders and will give us a lot of moral
leadership because of their influence,'' Guyang said.
   Wu'er and Yan escaped from China after the military crushed
student protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square on June 4. Chinese
officials said 300 people were killed, but Western observers have
said as many as 3,000 died. The two later surfaced in Paris, where
they attempted to rally worldwide support for the democracy
movement in their homeland.
   About 500 Chinese students attending some 150 U.S. colleges and
universities are expected to attend the First Congress of Chinese
Students in the United States this weekend to discuss the status of
the democracy movement in China, organizers said.
   Chinese living in Canada, Western Europe and Asia also are
expected to attend, Guyang said.
   ``We were elected by the local Chinese people to get a better
coordination system for the people around the United States,''
Guyang said. ``We also want to get better preparation for a
long-term struggle for the future of China.''
   The congress also is expected to elect leaders for the Chinese
students' movement in the United States.
   Organizers said the congress would focus on plans for fund
raising, lobbying the U.S. government and establishing a radio
station and newspaper to carry the pro-democracy message to people
in China.

<TEXT>
   Governing party officials eager to shore up their
battered party opened talks Thursday on a successor for resigning
Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, and the party's No. 2 official appeared
to be a leading contender.
   Party Secretary General Ryutaro Hashimoto appeared to have won
the support of party leaders, though some believed that at age 51
he is too young to take the job while the party is in crisis, one
official said.
   The Liberal Democratic Party officials decided a replacement
should be picked Aug. 8 at a caucus of party lawmakers and approved
in a special session of Parliament about Aug. 10. The party's
choice is expected to win routine approval by Parliament because
the Liberal Democrats control the more powerful lower house.
   However, opposition party officials continued to oppose any
early session of Parliament. They say they need time to work on a
bill to abolish an unpopular new 3 percent sales tax.
   The tax was a major issue in elections Sunday for half the seats
in the upper house of Parliament. It contributed to the Liberal
Democrats' loss of a majority in the chamber for the first time in
their 34-year history. The party dropped 33 seats, mostly to the
leading opposition group, the Japan Socialist Party.
   The Liberal Democrats have also struggled with charges that Uno,
in office for less than two months, had paid for sex with geishas.
   He replaced Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who announced his
resignation April 25 to take responsibility for an influence-buying
scandal that tainted much of the party's top leadership. It took
party leaders until June 2 to put Uno in office, partly because
they had trouble finding someone untouched by the scandal.
   Uno announced Monday he would resign to take responsibility for
Sunday's election outcome.
   Leaders of the five main factions within the governing party
began closed-door meetings Thursday to discuss a replacement,
despite a pledge Wednesday by Hashimoto that the process would be
conducted openly.
   Critics have objected to earlier, secret party deliberations to
pick a prime minister.
   Hashimoto is the youngest person to fill the party's No. 2 spot.
   Another possible candidate for prime minister is former Deputy
Prime Minister Shin Kanemaru.
   ``Leaders seem to be trying to build consensus within the party
over Hashimoto, and I have not heard anyone express strong
opposition so far,'' said one party official, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   ``But at the same time,'' he added, ``party elders seem to think
it is premature for the party to give its power to such a young
politician in such a turbulent time.''
   Hashimoto led the party's effort for Sunday's elections, making
90 speeches during the 14-day campaign period. He has said he also
takes responsibility for Sunday's setback, but he has not said
anything about resigning.
   The long-governing conservative party is seeking a new leader to
help restore public trust before lower house elections, which must
be held by July 1990.
   Meanwhile, Kanemaru said Thursday the Liberal Democrats would
face a ``terrible outcome'' in the lower house elections if the
sales tax remains in effect, news reports said.
   The tax, which applies to most purchases, was forced through
Parliament by the governing party last year during an opposition
boycott.

<TEXT>
   Two Greenpeace U.S.A. ships set sail
Thursday for an offshore missile test zone in an effort to halt the
launch of a Navy Trident 2 missile from a submerged submarine.
   The launching is scheduled for Friday afternoon, and the
protesters will be campaigning for ``nuclear free seas,'' said
Shannon Fagan, a spokeswoman for the environmental group.
   The Navy said it would not comment on Greenpeace's plans. It
also said it does not announce Trident launch schedules in advance.
   It would be the second underwater test firing of the Trident 2,
the Navy's newest, most powerful nuclear-armed missile. The first
test, in March, ended in an explosion when the weapon pinwheeled
out of control four seconds after it cleared the surface.
   Because the launch would take place in international water more
than 30 miles off Cape Canaveral, Fagan said the Navy would have
difficulty trying to oust Greenpeace's two foreign-registered ships
from the missile test zone.
   ``We'll be testing our right of innocent passage,'' she said.
Navy ships claim right of innocent passage in entering the Black
Sea or sailing in water claimed by Libya.
   The two ships are the Monticivitano, a 60-foot sailing sloop
under Swedish registry, and the M.V. Greenpeace, a 190-foot vessel
flying the Dutch flag.
   The Monticivitano, with seven people on board, left Fort Pierce,
about 70 miles south of here. The Greenpeace, with about 20 on
board, set off from Daytona Beach, 60 miles to the north.
   Greenpeace member Joel Clement said the ships would not try to
get close to the submarine or its support ships, but will enter a
zone of several square miles that is off-limits during the test.
   The Navy has said it plans to have the Trident 2 operational and
on sea patrol by next March. The weapon has a range of 4,600 miles
and each can carry up to eight nuclear warheads.
   The Navy plans to develop a 21-submarine force carrying Trident
2 missiles at a cost of about $155 billion over the vessels'
30-year lifetime, according to a report from the congressional
General Accounting Office.
   Greenpeace International, founded in 1971, began a campaign two
years ago for elimination of naval nuclear weapons. Its ships have
attempted in the past to halt French nuclear weapons testing in the
Pacific.

<HEAD>Plea Bargain Being Negotiated with Tanker Captain</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The state attorney general's office says
it has been trying to negotiate a plea agreement with the captain
of the tanker World Prodigy and others involved in last month's oil
spill off Newport.
   The proposal would allow the state to get damages of up to $1
million immediately and would spare a jail term for the captain,
Iakovos Georgudis, Attorney General James O'Neil said Wednesday.
   The captian, O'Neil said, has been ``very cooperative.''
   Peter DiBiase, Georgudis' lawyer, declined comment Wednesday.
Georgudis faces a total maximum penalty of 30 days in jail and
$20,000 in fines on state charges of gross negligence.
   He was indicted two weeks ago for failing to have a licensed
pilot on board the Greek-flagged ship when it spilled about 300,000
gallons of oil after it ran aground on Brenton Reef, just outside
the mouth of Narragansett Bay.
   The plea agreement would not bar state and federal governments
from taking civil action to recover additional money in damages and
cleanup costs from the tanker's owners, Ballard Shipping Co.
   Georgudis has been charged with two criminal violations of
federal pollution laws, each punishable by one year in jail and
fines of double the cost of environmental damage. The plea bargain
would not address those charges.
   The tanker, which had been in New York Harbor for repairs, left
Wednesday for Greece.
   Georgudis remained in New York City. He has not appeared in
public since June 28, when he declined to answer questions before a
grand jury, citing Fifth Amendment protection.

   The State Bar says it won't charge Assembly
Speaker Willie Brown with violating disciplinary rules for lawyers
by contacting a judge about traffic tickets issued to a
legislator's daughter.
   The bar said in a statement Wednesday that it had closed its
investigation on possible ethical misconduct by Brown, a Democrat
from San Francisco.
   ``The State Bar concluded that there was an absence of
compelling evidence on which to base a finding that Brown had
violated the provisions of the State Bar Act or the Rules of
Professional Conduct,'' the bar said.
   The investigation concerned reports that Brown had asked for
leniency when he called Ventura County Municipal Court Judge
Herbert Curtis about the case of Victoria Wright, daughter of
Assemblywoman Cathie Wright.
   Victoria Wright ultimately was sentenced to 20 days in jail for
traffic violations.
   Ventura County District Attorney Michael Bradbury decided not to
charge Brown or the assemblywoman, but sent a 75-page report on the
case to the bar and expressed disappointment at its reaction.
   ``I guess they didn't want to bite the hand that feeds them,''
Bradbury said.
   Brown's press secretary, Susan Jetton, said Brown ``said from
the beginning that he did not do anything wrong.''
   Brown has been a California lawyer since 1959 and maintains an
active practice.

   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia will be in
Washington to meet with President Bush on Sept. 14, after canceling
a visit that was scheduled for this week, the White House announced
today.
   The king was involved in Arab League efforts to resolve the
conflict in Lebanon, and postponed his trip because of that effort,
said White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen.
   The king's brother, Prince Salman, a high government official,
met with Bush briefly today and discussed the opening of a Saudi
cultural exhibit in Washington, the prince said. Salman said Vice
President Dan Quayle will open the exhibit on Friday.
   The Arab League is attempting to negotiate a truce in Lebanon
between Syrian-backed Druze forces and Christian militia and to
spur major political reforms in the embattled country.
   The league, at a summit meeting in Morocco in May, gave King
Fahd, King Hassan II of Morocco and Algeria's President Chadli
Bendjedid the task of trying to arrange within six months a
ceasefire and a blueprint for lasting political reforms in Lebanon.
   Fifteen foreigners are believed to be held hostage in Lebanon.
Nine of them are Americans, including Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press.

   An immigration appeals panel ruled today that
leftist writer Margaret Randall is an American citizen and
therefore cannot be deported, a decision that her lawyer said
``rebukes'' the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   In a 3-2 decision, the Board of Immigration Appeals determined
that the poet and author was forced by dire economic straits in
1967 to take out Mexican citizenship, and never renounced her U.S.
citizenship freely.
   Attorneys for Randall, an outspoken critic of U.S. policy who
has lived 14 years in Cuba and Nicaragua, said the INS was trying
to punish her for her pro-communist views. The board was trying to
determine whether she should be deported.
   ``I'm absolutely thrilled, of course, and I'm especially happy
because I feel the struggle that was felt by so many people over
the last 4{ years has borne some fruit,'' Randall said today at her
home in Albuquerque, N.M. ``To tell you the truth, I'm a little
numb.''
   ``I think the decision affirms that U.S. citizenship is a
constitutional right and that one cannot lose one's citizenship
because the government doesn't like what you say in your criticism
of its policies,'' said attorney David Cole, who represented
Randall on behalf of the New York-based Center for Constitutional
Rights.
   ``It's sort of a nice rebuke to the INS,'' he said.
   Randall said she is sure the INS is glad a decision has been
reached.
   ``I haven't seen the decision, but my feeling about the INS is
that I bear no individual any ill will and I really just feel this
is something we all should feel happy we have behind us.''
   An INS spokesman, Duke Austin, said he had not seen the ruling
and had no immediate comment.
   ``We find that the respondent (Randall) has established by a
preponderance of the evidence that economic reasons led her to
acquire Mexican citizenship and that these economic reasons rose to
the level of duress sufficient to negate her free choice,'' the
appeals board ruled.
   The panel operates independently of the INS under the wing of
the Justice Department.
   According to records, Randall and her Mexican husband separated
in 1967, and she was left to support her three children. Because of
Mexico's work rules, she had to take out Mexican citizenship in
order to find employment.
   She told a State Department employee two years later, ``I did it
because my children didn't have enough to eat and I felt I didn't
have any other choice,'' Cole said in a telephone interview.
   A Supreme Court decision at the time had held that actions such
as taking an oath to another country, joining a foreign army and
holding an office in a foreign government were not necessarily
proof that someone was renouncing U.S. citizenship, Cole said.
   ``You can only give it up if you want to,'' he said.
   After living in Cuba and Nicaragua, Randall returned to the
United States in 1983 on a visitor's visa. When she was denied
permanent resident alien status, she appealed to the Supreme Court,
which last month refused to hear her case until the immigration
appeal had been completed.
   The INS had based the denial of resident status on Randall's
``association with and her activities and writing in support of the
communist-dominated governments of Cuba, North Vietnam and
Nicaragua.'' It said those activities and writings ``go far beyond
mere dissent.''
   Randall has been living in Albuquerque, N.M., near her aging
parents, and taking a variety of teaching jobs.

<HEAD>400 Workers Locked Out By British Company In Wage Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 400 production workers
at a British electrical factory were locked out Thursday and
threatened with dismissal unless they dropped their demands for a
25 percent wage increase.
   The workers, predominantly women of mixed race, staged a protest
outside the Plessey Co. factory in Diepriver, a township near Cape
Town.
   Most of the locked-out workers are members of the Electrical and
Allied Workers Trade Union and represent more than 80 percent of
the production personnel at the plant. The company has offered them
a 17 percent wage increase and has threatened to fire them unless
they accept the offer by Aug. 8.
   Union officials said they were angry because Plessey implemented
the lockout and issued the dismissal threat in terms of a recently
passed labor law that has been opposed vehemently by anti-apartheid
trade unions.
   ``We are outraged that a company that is part of the
international community would make use if the regime's oppressive
labor laws,'' said union spokesman Brian Williams. He said the
workers would seek support from fellow union members in Britain and
elsewhere.
   The average wage of union members employed by Plessey is about
$315 a month, according to union officials. They said the company's
customers include the South African armed forces.
   The company has declined to comment on the dispute.

<HEAD>Devastating Shelling of Residential Areas Kills 28</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian and Syrian troops killed 28
people and wounded 80 in a savage artillery battle that started
hundreds of fires, police said Thursday. Four of the victims died
when a rocket hit a home for the elderly.
   It was the fiercest fighting and the worst toll since March 14,
when 39 people were killed and 96 wounded in Beirut.
   A police spokesman said casualties were higher in Syrian-policed
west Beirut, where only a few neighborhoods escaped damage.
   Some suggested right-wing Christian militias planned the
bombardment.
   One resident, in the Ashrafiyeh district that is the most
damaged of the Christian neighborhoods, said Lebanese Forces
militiamen toured east Beirut shortly before shelling began late
Wednesday and urged people through loudspeakers to stay underground
overnight.
   ``It was strange because at the time they advised us to rush to
shelters there was no shelling,'' the resident said on condition of
anonymity.
   The police spokesman said it was impossible to determine who
started the barrages.
   But he noted it was ``the fiercest ever'' artillery attack waged
by Christian militiamen and mainly Christian Lebanese Army troops
commanded by Gen. Michel Aoun.
   Thursday's victims raised casualties to 481 killed and 1,949
wounded since the latest violence erupted March 8 after Aoun
blockaded illegal ports used by Moslem militiamen. Syrian troops
backed the Moslems and have besieged the 310-square-mile Christian
enclave, betraying a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   In Beirut on Thursday, 60 shells and rockets a minute rained
down on some Moslem areas.
   Five 122mm rockets blasted the five-story Home of The Aged in
west Beirut's Tarik Jedideh district, killing four inmates and
wounding three.
   Victims were sprayed with shrapnel while they slept when the
rockets blasted the first-floor of the home, said assistant manager
Azzam Houri.
   ``Who would want to kill such helpless people?'' a nurse cried
when reporters toured bloodstained corridors of the home that
houses 850 people. ``It was a massacre,'' she said.
   Military sources said Aoun's gunners mainly targeted Syrian
batteries along beaches in west Beirut and in hills to the east and
southeast, but Lebanese Forces militiamen blasted residential
neighborhoods indiscriminately.
   The 6,000-member coalition of right-wing militias is commanded
by Samir Geagea, a Maronite Catholic like Aoun, who commands 20,000
troops.
   Geagea is Aoun's main rival in the Christian camp, but the two
lately joined forces to drive Syria's 40,000 troops out of Lebanon.
   An Aoun spokesman confirmed militiamen unleashed the random
barrages.
   ``Our main problem now is how to control the Lebanese Forces.
Their indiscriminate shelling is not serving our war of
liberation'' against the Syrians, he said on condition of anonymity.
   Moslem radio stations also blamed the Lebanese Forces.
   The popular Voice of the Nation appealed to those who ``control
the machine of steel and fire to stop the massacre at any cost.''
   It said the Lebanese Forces' pounded west Beirut with
phosphorous ammunition ``to plant fire and death wherever they
explode.''
   Tank fire, mortars, howitzers and multibarreled rocket-launchers
all were deployed. The Syrians and Lebanese Forces both used BM-21
rocket-launchers that fire 40 projectiles a minute.
   Thuds from exploding rockets and artillery shells shook the
capital and sent orange flames illuminating the sky of the city,
which was blacked out by power rationing.
   Shells tore gaping holes in apartment buildings, triggering
hundreds of fires that blazed out of control because the power
outage left the fire brigade without water.
   Smoke billowed from gutted buildings, debris and glass shards
blanketed the streets. Some of the hundreds of smashed cars were
reduced to piles of black, twisted metal.
   A weeping middle-aged woman in west Beirut called on God to
``punish the criminals who caused this catastrophe.''
   ``May Allah's wrath fall on all the combatants. They get paid to
kill us or ruin our property,'' she shouted. A Syrian soldier
nearby watched her silently.
   Thursday's escalation followed a report from Rabat, Morocco,
that the foreign ministers of Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Algeria
will meet Saturday to review their failure to end Lebanon's 14-year
civil war.

<HEAD>Makeup Artist Who Aged `Citizen Kane' Dies at 81</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORT ANGELES, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maurice Seiderman, the makeup artist
whose elaborate masks and skin putty were used to age Orson Welles
in the film ``Citizen Kane,'' has died. He was 81.
   Seiderman died July 18 in Port Angeles of a heart attack, said
Dan Verheul of Sequim Valley Chapel Funeral Directors.
   He emigrated from Russia in the 1920s, living first in Florida
and then studying art in New York. He joined RKO Studios in
Hollywood, Calif., as a junior member of the makeup department in
the early 1930s.
   Confronted with the problem of aging the characters in ``Citizen
Kane'' as much as 50 years, he made a series of plaster casts of
the actors and sculpted pieces of molded plastic foam in which
their features gradually sagged and their hair thinned.
   Seiderman also produced the disfigured faces in ``Enchanted
Cottage''; makeup and wigs in ``Gunga Din'' and ``The Hunchback of
Notre Dame''; and worked on such Welles classic films as ``The
Magnificent Ambersons'' and ``Macbeth.''
   He made Raymond Massey into ``Abe Lincoln in Illinois' and
Judith Anderson into ``Lady Scarface.''
   He also was an inventor who researched the use of contact lenses
and held several patents in that field. It was his skill there that
produced the aging eyes of the actors.
   Late in life, he became an artist, painting abstracts on slides
under a microscope he designed himself.
   He is survived by his wife, Celita, and a brother.

<HEAD>Palestinians Call for Greater US Peace Role; 2 Palestinians Killed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS MEIXLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GAZA CITY, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four prominent
Palestinians told the American ambassador to Israel on Thursday
that the United States must play a greater role in resolving the
Middle East conflict.
   Two Palestinians were reported killed Thursday, one shot by
Israeli soldiers and the other slain with axes, apparently by other
Palestinians who suspected him of collaborating with Israel.
   Israeli soldiers or civilians have killed 521 Palestinians since
an uprising began more than 19 months ago in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip. Thirty-eight Israelis have been slain and
Palestinians have killed at least 85 suspected collaborators.
   ``The United States can play a central and major role in this
region, and without this role no progress can be achieved,'' Dr.
Zakariya al-Agha, head of the Arab Medical Association in Gaza,
said after the meeting with Ambassador William Brown.
   Zuhair el-Rais, a lawyer who is a founding member of the
Palestine Liberation Organization and a member of the committee
that drafted its charter, said he told the ambassador the United
States must be a ``a full partner to the peace process.''
   ``They must put more pressure on Israel and practice a more
balanced policy toward Palestinians,'' he said.
   When reporters asked Brown about the meeting, the ambassador
said ``The weather is nice'' and turned away.
   Also attending the private session were Fayez Abu Rahme, a
lawyer, and Dr. Hatem Abu Ghazala, head of the Society for the Care
of Handicapped Children, which receives U.S. funds.
   Arab reports said Mohammed Omar Safouri, 20, was fatally shot in
the chest in a stone-throwing clash with Israeli soldiers at the
Tulkarem refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. Doctors at the
camp hospital said an 11-year-old boy was wounded and described his
condition as serious.
   Khaled Naif Abdeen, 23, was axed to death in Khan Yunis, a Gaza
Strip town. Doctors at Nasser Hospital said Abdeen had ax wounds
all over his body, and Arab reports said he was suspected of
collaborating with Israel.
   Two Israeli Arabs convicted in a similar killing in October were
given life prison terms Thursday by a military court in Lod.
   Mahmoud Ottman Jabrin, 25, and a relative, Mohammed Ahmad
Jabrin, 23, were convicted of shooting Ahmad Youssef Za'rour to
death in an Israeli town to which he fled from his West Bank
village after receiving threats.
   Brown met with the Gaza Palestinians at a time of debate in
Israel over recent meetings by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir with
PLO supporters from the occupied territories.
   Shamir has conferred secretly with Palestinians about his peace
proposal for the West Bank and Gaza, under which the 1.7 million
Palestinian residents would elect representatives to negotiate with
Israel.
   Hard-liners in conservative Shamir's Likud bloc, led by Industry
Minister Ariel Sharon, have tried to force the prime minister into
a tough negotiating stance that would preserve Israeli control of
the territories.
   After a strategy session Thursday, Sharon said his group would
publicize what he described as the dangers of talks and of contacts
with the PLO or anyone affiliated with it.
   Asked about PLO chief Yasser Arafat's comments on the Shamir
plan, Sharon said: ``We don't have to react to every word of the
mass murderer Arafat.''
   Arafat was quoted Thursday by the Egyptian government newspaper
Al-Ahram as saying elections were ``a good idea,'' but should
should lead to formation of a Palestinian state.
   Al-Ahram quoted Arafat as recommending a peace plan along the
lines of the U.N. formula for Namibian independence, including
partial Israeli troop withdrawal from the territories before
elections and U.N. supervision of the vote.
   He insisted on total Israeli withdrawal over 27 months, ``in
stages as in the case of Namibia,'' and repatriation of Palestinian
refugees.
   Israel and the United States have opposed an independent
Palestinian state. Leaders of Israel's major political parties have
said they will reject any plan that includes repatriation of
refugees.

   Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi left federal
custody in a limousine today after his lawyer posted $10 million
bail in an arrangement approved by an appeals judge over
prosecutors' objections.
   ``I am pleased that the courts have granted me bail,'' Khashoggi
said, reading a handwritten statement outside the courthouse in
Manhattan where his lawyer gave a clerk two bank checks for $5
million each. ``I am anxious to work for my defense and look
forward to clearing my name at trial.''
   Khashoggi, 54, will be allowed to live in his luxury apartment
on Fifth Avenue, but required to wear an electronic monitoring
bracelet.
   Judge Lawrence W. Pierce of the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of
Appeals lifted a stay on the release that had been in effect while
he reviewed the bail set by U.S. District Judge John Keenan earlier
this week.
   During a hearing later before Keenan, Khashoggi promised that he
would stay in the country and face the charges under which he was
jailed in New York after his extradition from Switzerland July 19.
He is charged with helping former Philippine President Ferdinand
Marcos and his wife, Imelda, to allegedly steal $100 million from
their nation's treasury to buy real estate and art in New York.
   ``I want to assure your honor that I will abide because I
cherish the relationship with America,'' he said.
   When asked by a reporter how he felt, Khashoggi answered, ``Very
great. Thank you.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella had argued in an appeal
filed Wednesday that Khashoggi's wealth was unverifiable and that
he should be required to give a detailed financial disclosure
before bail is even considered.
   Khashoggi, once one of the world's richest men, submitted
documents to the court last week listing his assets at $141.8
million. But said he had $88 million in liabilities, bringing his
estimated net worth to $53.8 million.
   A federal grand jury in New York indicted Khashoggi, the
Marcoses, five other people and a California bank in October.
   Khashoggi, who allegedly posed as the owner of some of the
assets bought by the Marcoses, was indicted on racketeering,
conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction of justice. However, he was
extradited on the last two charges only. He faces up to five years
in jail and a $250,000 fine on each of the two charges of mail
fraud and obstruction of justice.
   Khashoggi is said to have been the main financier and middleman
of the Iran-Contra affair, in which proceeds of illegal U.S. arms
sales to Iran went to rebels fighting the Nicaraguan government.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush painted a rosy picture Thursday
of life on the farm, telling future farmers there has never been a
better time to launch a career in agriculture.
   Bush told more than 100 Future Farmers of America the growing
global demand for farm products and a shift toward fewer government
controls make their future bright.
   ``For you, our global economy means there has never been a
better place nor more crucial time to start a career than in
America today,'' he said.
   American farmers have pulled out of their crisis of four years
ago, the president told leaders of the 805,000-member farm
organization at the White House.
   ``This year, farm income and agricultural exports are nearing
record highs. Our surpluses of farm commodities have been
drastically reduced and most of our good land has been brought back
into production,'' Bush said. ``And the farm credit situation has
greatly improved over the last decade.''
   He added, ``This progress has occurred while cutting the cost of
federal farm programs in half. For when the farm economy is strong
and government has to pay less, all America benefits.''
   ``You have told government to tear down the roadblocks of
tariffs and trade barriers, and (said) that the wave of the future
lies in competition and free enterprise,'' said Bush.
   In writing a new farm bill next year, the president said,
``these principles must be kept in mind. ... In response to market
forces, producers must have more flexibility to decide what crops
to grow.''
   He said the United States will keep pressing in talks on the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for freer trade. ``Like the
walls of Jericho, these barriers which distort world trade must
come tumbling down,'' he said.
   ``Ours is a global economy now. And America must ... be able to
compete,'' said Bush. That will mean expanding ties with the Soviet
Union, ``already the third largest customer for U.S. agricultural
commodities,'' and other countries, he said.
   Bush said agricultural and environmental concerns must be seen
``as compatible. Both ... need clean, safe and quality water.''
   The Agriculture Department says commodity price support programs
this year are expected to cost $13.5 billion, down from a peak of
$25.8 billion in fiscal 1986.
   The peak year for farm exports was fiscal 1981, when U.S. farm
products fetched $43.8 billion. This year, it is expected to be $39
billion, up from $26.3 billion in fiscal 1986.
   The net cash income of farmers this year is expected to range
from $50 billion to $55 billion, down from last year's record high
of $58 billion.
   Experts say income is down because farmers have brought more
land back in production, driving up their expenses. Also, last year
their income soared as the drought forced prices up and farmers
rushed to market crops they had stored from previous years.

<HEAD>House Judiciary Committee Approves Bill to Ban Flag Burning</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs pvs 3rd graf, The Democratic, with 2 grafs to show Republicans
blocking full House action. Deletes penultimate graf, outdated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Judiciary Committee today
overwhelmingly approved a bill to ban flag burning after Democrats
elbowed aside Republican demands for a constitutional amendment.
   The committee approved the criminal statute 28-6 after chairman
Jack Brooks, D-Texas, promised to back a constitutional amendment
if the legislation failed to overcome a Supreme Court ruling that
flag burning was a protected form of free speech.
   The Democratic leadership intended to rush the bill to the House
floor next week, before the August recess, in hopes of further
calming demands for amending the Constitution and of defusing the
issue.
   However, parliamentary objections today by Republicans forced a
delay in floor action until after the House returns in September.
   The statute provides penalties of up to a year in jail plus a
fine, the amount of which is not specified, for anyone who burns or
otherwise physically desecrates a flag.
   In a sometimes raucus meeting, Brooks ruled out of order the
second Republican attempt in two days to substitute a
constitutional amendment for the regular statute supported by the
Democratic leadership.
   ``This statute is a mess, and it's obvious it's a mess from
everything we've seen and heard this morning,'' said Rep. Chuck
Douglas, R-N.H.
   Douglas offered several amendments designed to derail the
statute, including a modified version of the constitutional
amendment supported by President Bush and House Minority Leader Bob
Michel, R-Ill.
   Although other Republicans supported his amendments, Douglas was
the only one who voted against the statute.
   Five Democrats, leery of any infringement of free speech, voted
against it, including Rep. John Conyers of Michigan who offered an
amendment of his own to ban cross burnings.
   ``Cross burnings for centuries have been more of a problem in
the United States than flag burnings,'' said Conyers, who was also
ruled out of order by Brooks.
   Democratic leaders have made clear they intend to allow passage
only of a statute before the August recess.
   ``As a matter of prudence and principle we must try the
statutory route'' before tampering with the First Amendment, said
Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., as the committee on Wednesday opened
consideration of the flag bill.
   Rep. Hamilton Fish, R-N.Y., appealed to the Democrats to give
Republicans a chance to offer amendments to the bill when it
reaches the full House, probably next week. Brooks indicated,
however, that the bill will be brought up under an expedited
procedure that blocks any amendments.
   Bush effectively used the flag against the Democratic nominee,
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, in last year's presidential
election.
   Since then, Democrats have been ``running scared whenever the
question of the flag has been raised,'' said Rep. George Crockett,
D-Mich., a committee member who agrees with the Supreme Court
decision that flag burning is a constitutionally protected form of
political protest.
   Although most lawmakers of both parties condemned the ruling,
Bush set the political battle lines in Congress when he embraced
the constitutional amendment at a ceremony at the Iwo Jima memorial.
   By passing a statute before the August recess, House Speaker
Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., hopes Democrats can take care of the flag
and cool the rush for a constitutional amendment.
   Foley and the other top Democrats contend the statute introduced
by Brooks can pass constitutional muster because it does not take
into account whether the flag burning or other mutilation was part
of a protest or similar act.
   The court, in its 5-4 ruling, specifically objected to a Texas
statute that outlawed flag burning when it was an offensive act.
   The Brooks bill makes an exception so that veterans groups and
others can continue to dispose of old, worn-out flags, for which
burning is the traditional method.
   The bill also provides for the law to get expedited review by
the Supreme Court.
   The Senate has scheduled votes on both the amendment and a
statute in October.

<TEXT>
   Former President Jimmy Carter met
Thursday with President Mengistu Haile Mariam to seek an end to
Ethiopia's civil war.
   It was Carter's third visit to Ethiopia since August. He said
all sides in the conflict are ``very eager to see peace talks
started and progress made.''
   Carter told reporters he was not serving as a formal mediator
but said he would accept that role if the parties to the conflict
asked him to do so.
   Mengistu announced June 5 that his government was ready to meet
the rebels for unconditional talks in the presence of an
international observer. Both of Ethiopia's main rebel groups have
accepted the initiative, but Carter said no date or time has been
set for talks.
   Eritreans rebels, who have been fighting since 1961, seek
independence or more autonomy for their northernmost province in
this East African country. Tigrean guerrillas also want greater
autonomy.
   It is the longest civil war in Africa.
   During his term in office, Carter won acclaim as a peacemaker
for bringing Egypt and Israel together to sign the Camp David
Accords in 1978.
   U.S. relations with Ethiopia have been strained since the early
1980s, when Mengistu shifted his alliances from the United States
to the Soviet Union.
   Carter, who arrived early Thursday, was to leave later in the
day for a meeting with neighboring Sudan's new military leader, Lt.
Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir. Sudan also is engaged in a civil war.
   After his stop there, Carter will fly on for visits to Zimbabwe,
Zambia, Ghana and Nigeria on behalf of Global 2000, his private
organization dedicated to the development of poor countries.

   Elks club members from around the nation
voted today against allowing women to join their fraternal
organization but in favor of a membership rule that could make it
easer for non-white men to join.
   The proposal to admit women was one of the hottest issues at the
125th national convention of the 1.5 million-member Benevolent and
Protective Order of Elks, which began Sunday and ends today.
   During a closed business meeting, the delegates took up a
resolution to strike the word ``male'' from membership requirements.
   Donald Dapelo, the newly installed Grand Exalted Ruler of the
Elks, said the vote was by a show of hands and there was no count.
   ``I wouldn't say it was close, not at all,'' said Dapelo. ``I'd
say it was overwhelmingly defeated.
   Approved was the proposal to eliminate a rule allowing any three
members of an Elks lodge to reject, or ``blackball,'' a prospective
member. Some said that rule made it harder for blacks to join the
organization.
   Under the new rule, a two-thirds majority of a lodge's members
could approve a new member.
   In St. George, Utah, a woman who was rejected for Elks
membership filed a sex discrimination lawsuit in 1987 that is still
pending.
   Elks membership policies were subject to ``undeserved
criticism'' during the February 1988 confirmation hearings for
Stephen M. Reasoner of Jonesboro, Ark., now a federal judge, said
retired Air Force Lt. Col. Hal Detrick of Jonesboro in submitting
the resolution.
   Reasoner resigned from the Elks and Masonic lodges after Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, accused the organizations of
discriminating against women and blacks.
   Passage of a resolution to do away with the ``three blackball''
rule was urged by the Lompoc, Calif., Elks Lodge after two black
applicants were rejected. The California attorney general's office
is investigating possible civil rights violations as a result of
that vote.
   While the Elks do have some black members nationally, several
California lodges threatened legal action if rules were not changed
to allow more minority representation in the group's 2,300 lodges.

   The federal government could collect billions
of dollars in unpaid taxes if it had the staff to audit
upper-income Americans, who account for a disproportionate share of
tax evasion, says a study sponsored by a Democratic group.
   People who earn more than $50,000 a year, 12 percent of all
taxpayers, owed 40 percent of the $72.5 billion in taxes that were
owed to the government in 1985 but not collected, said the study,
which was based on data from the Internal Revenue Service.
   The top 3 percent of taxpayers, those who make more than
$100,000 a year, accounted for 26 percent of the unpaid taxes, the
study said. It was financed by Leadership for the New Century, a
group of progressive Democrats.
   The study was based on detailed audits of 50,000 to 60,000
Americans the IRS conducts every three years to determine how well
taxpayers are complying with the law.
   People who earn less than $25,000 a year, 62 percent of all
taxpayers, owed 30 percent of the government's uncollected taxes in
1985, the study said. Taxpayers who make $25,000 to $50,000 a year
accounted for 31 percent of the unpaid taxes.

   Felix S. Bloch, suspected of passing
information to the Soviets, ended a three-night stay in Manhattan
on Thursday and drove back to his daughter's suburban home, trailed
by federal agents, reporters and photographers.
   Bloch said nothing as he emerged from an East Side apartment
building and got into a Mercedes Benz with Washington, D.C.,
license plates Thursday morning, and said nothing when he arrived
at the house in Chappaqua, 35 miles north of Manhattan.
   Bloch, accompanied only by a small dog, took a roundabout route
through Manhattan before heading north. At least eight cars
containing FBI agents followed, along with several cars with
reporters and photographers.
   Bloch had arrived in New York on Monday from Chappaqua and
apparently stayed in an apartment owned by his father. When he
returned to Chappaqua, he was greeted by his daughter, Kathleen
Swenson.
   Bloch, a career American diplomat who was deputy chief of
mission at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna from 1980 to 1987, reportedly
was filmed by U.S. intelligence agents passing a briefcase to a
known Soviet agent. He has not been charged with any crime but is
under constant surveillance.

<HEAD>Singer Bobby Brown Cancels Final 20 Concerts on U.S. Tour</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer Bobby Brown, one of the hippest young
acts in the country, has canceled the 20 concerts in the final leg
of his U.S. tour.
   ``The reasons are very nebulous ... and the fair interprets this
as a lack of concern for Brown's fans and the public in general,''
said Maynard Potter, general manager of the California Mid-State
Fair in Paso Robles, who had booked Brown for Aug. 13.
   Brown's ``Don't Be Cruel'' album has sold nearly 5 million
copies and spawned four straight Top 5 singles.
   Richard Hofstetter, Brown's New York-based attorney, said the
singer wants to take some time to begin pre-production work on his
next album.
   ``He had to make a choice here,'' Hofstetter said. ``He could
have made a lot more money staying on the road. But there's a lot
of pressure on him for the next album. He wants to make it right.''
   Brown has been touring since September and his latest song, ``On
Our Own,'' the theme from ``Ghostbusters II,'' is climbing up the
music charts.

<HEAD>$1,000 University Scholarship for Recovering Substance Abusers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alcoholics and drug addicts who are trying
to pull their lives together are being offered a helping hand _ a
$1,000 college scholarship.
   The scholarship at the University of South Florida's Sarasota
campus was donated anonymously by a recovering alcoholic.
   ``In the past, the donor had helped people on an individual
basis go back to school,'' said Lester Aldheizer of the school's
development office. ``Then the donor decided the scholarship was a
better way to go.''
   The school plans to award the scholarships to five students each
year. The scholarship goes to degree-seeking students who are in
recovery programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous. Applicants must
show that they have been sober or ``clean'' for at least two years.
   The scholarships were given for the first time a year ago. One
of the three recipients completed the first academic year,
finishing with a grade point average of 3.5 of a possible 4.0,
Aldheizer said. The other two dropped out; the university won't say
why. There is no provision for returning unused money.
   ``For me, it was a matter of self-esteem, and it was a matter of
survival,'' said one scholarship winner, a woman who uses the
pseudonym Annie. The school promises anonymity to those who apply
for the scholarship.
   Annie said she was in college when she developed dual addictions
to alcohol and drugs more than a decade ago. She has been sober and
drug-free for several years and is studying fine arts and mass
communications.
   The $1,000 more than covers a year's tuition and books for
full-time students. They must re-apply each year. Scholarship
amounts for part-time students vary with the number of credit hours
taken.
   Three letters of recommendation from key people in a recovery
program must accompany each application. Recipients must have lived
in Sarasota or Manatee counties and must intend to remain there.
   ``I have no idea who the donor is, but he or she is trying to
pass something on to other recovering alcoholics,'' Annie said. ``I
am extremely grateful. When I get out of school and I get a career,
I'm going to donate to this scholarship fund so I can pass
something on to others too.''
   USF officials say they think it may be the first scholarship in
the country aimed specifically at recovering substance abusers.

<HEAD>Eds: TOP 10 grafs new with Dickinson withdrawing amendments on F-14D

   A threat to cancel the F-14D jet fighter and
V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor plane disappeared today as a key House
opponent bowed to strong political support and withdrew a proposal
to scuttle the military aircraft programs.
   Rep. William Dickinson of Alabama, ranking Republican on the
House Armed Services Committee, pulled a proposed amendment to a
defense authorization bill that would have eliminated the F-14D.
   The fighter, nicknamed the Tomcat, is strongly backed by
lawmakers from New York, where it is manufactured by Grumman
Aerospace Corp.
   New York Reps. Norman Lent, Raymond McGrath and David Martin
succeeded in persuading Dickinson to withdraw the provision,
according to New York Democrat George Hochbrueckner, a former
Grumman engineer.
   ``It's clear we had the votes but we didn't want to test that,''
Hochbrueckner said. ``Let the amendment die.''
   Dickinson also decided not to introduce an amendment canceling
the Marine Corps Osprey, a transport aircraft that takes off like a
helicopter but can fly like a plane. It has the support of members
from Pennsylvania and Texas, where the V-22 is built, as well as
former Marines in Congress.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has sought to scrap both aircraft
projects as a money-saving step.
   But the House Armed Services Committee voted last month to
restore $157 million for the Osprey in fiscal 1990 and about $230
million for the Tomcat.
   Earlier today, the House voted to urge President Bush to open
negotiations with the Soviet Union aimed at banning the production
of plutonium and enriched uranium, the materials used in nuclear
weapons.
   The vote for the non-binding resolution, attached to the defense
authorization bill, was 284-138.
   Supporters of the amendment said such negotiations are a logical
and needed next step in the arms control process.
   But opponents said such a ban would be impossible to verify and
would put the United States at a serious disadvantage because it
has no currently operating nuclear enrichment production plants
while the Soviet Union has 12 to 14 ``going at full blast.''
   Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, said the talks could resolve an ``tremendous
imbalance'' in which the Soviets are adding to their nuclear
stockpile while U.S. production stands at ``zero.''
   ``This is an effort to get us on the negotiating track and deal
with this problem if possible,'' he said. ``This is an expression
of Congress saying, `Mr President, see what you can do.'''
   Rep. Bob Walker, R-Pa., replied that the Bush administration
opposes the measure and that U.S. arms negotiators are against it
because an agreement could not be verified.
   ``Let's not do something stupid,'' Walker said.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said he worried that Congress might, with such
suggestions, ``overload the arms control agenda.''
   The House voted Wednesday to curb production of the
radar-evading stealth bomber program, but Cheney expressed relief
the chamber had not killed the $70 billion program outright.
   Cheney said the White House hopes a House conference with the
Senate to resolve differences in the two chambers' versions of the
$295 billion defense authorization bill will remove the roadblocks
and permit a fast start for production of the costly bomber.
   ``They (the administration) have, in effect, a year to
restructure the program, to prove through tests it's worth
buying,'' Aspin told reporters. ``It's the core of the argument. We
don't know enough right now to make a decision.''
   The Aspin amendment would require the Pentagon to meet rigid
test and performance standards before additional stealth bombers
are purchased. It would limit to two the number of bombers to be
purchased over the next two fiscal years.
   The administration suffered an unwanted budget cut Wednesday
when the House approved an amendment to reduce by $502 million the
$1.1 billion earmarked for spare MX missiles and for a rail system
Bush requested to make the MX a mobile system. The 224-197 vote
does not affect the nearly $800 million earmarked for the missiles
themselves.
   The Senate, voting 98-1 on Tuesday, endorsed President Bush's
two-year request for $4.7 billion for stealth production,
conditioned on the aircraft meeting flight-test and radar-evasion
standards.
   Before adopting the Aspin amendment the House defeated a
proposal to eliminate the program outright.

   A flight distance record was set Thursday by a
new Boeing 767-200 twinjet being delivered to Air Seychelles on the
island of Mahe in the Indian Ocean, Boeing officials said.
   The jet, which is being leased, flew 8,893 miles from Grand
Rapids, Mich., to Mahe in 16 hours, 49 minutes to set a record for
a commercial twinjet.
   With a full load of 208 passengers and baggage, the plane has a
normal range of 7,400 miles, Boeing reported.
   The record flight carried 32 people, including France Albert
Rene, president of the Republic of the Seychelles, and members of
his cabinet.
   Also on the flight was a representative of the National
Aeronautic Association of the United States, who verified the
record.
   The previous record was set in April 1988 by a 767-200 flying
for Air Mauritius. That flight was from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to
Mauritius, also in the Indian Ocean.
   The Republic of Seychelles is a tropical island group located
northeast of Madagascar. A popular tourist destination, it is
dependent on aircraft for much of its commerce.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Counterintelligence sources contend
Soviet bloc espionage is on the increase in West Germany, despite
warming East-West relations and closer ties between the Kremlin and
this front-line NATO nation.
   ``There was a sharp jump in the espionage activities of the
Warsaw Pact nations in 1988 and we have every reason to suspect
that it will increase,'' said Hans-Gert Lange, a spokesman for the
Cologne-based Constitutional Protection Office that is West
Germany's counterintelligence agency.
   West Germany, especially West Berlin, has been an espionage
hotbed since the advent of the Cold War.
   For more than four decades, the divided city has been the scene
of legendary intrigue and furtive spy swaps at the Berlin Wall, the
demarcation line between East and West.
   Bonn also is a mecca for espionage operations, and the capital
on the Rhine River frequently is rocked by spy scandals.
   A former government secretary was convicted in May on charges of
delivering sensitive information to East German intelligence and
the Soviet KGB.
   The Constitutional Protection Office has suffered its own
scandals. Hans-Joachim Tiedge, a senior counterintelligence
official in charge of tracking down East German spies, defected to
East Germany in 1985.
   In 1974, former Chancellor Willy Brandt was forced to resign
after a top aide, Guenter Guillaume, was exposed as an East bloc
agent.
   West German officials currently are investigating whether senior
U.S. diplomat Felix S. Bloch was involved in espionage when he held
posts in West Germany in the 1960s and East and West Berlin in the
1970s.
   He reportedly was filmed by U.S. officials earlier this year
passing a briefcase to a Soviet KGB agent in a European capital.
   Security officials in Bonn, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the the threat of espionage activity has increased since the
Soviet Union and other East bloc countries have allowed tens of
thousands of people to emigrate to the West.
   Lange said high-tech industry also is ``increasingly a target of
East bloc espionage activities'' to get around bans on sales of
sophisticated equipment to the Soviet bloc. The Soviet Union and
its Warsaw Pact allies need an infusion of technology to help turn
around their failing economies.
   Lange and other security officials say evidence is mounting that
East bloc agents increasingly are being channeled into West Germany
among emigres.
   ``There is a definite trend here, although the vast majority of
them (emigres) are not involved,'' said Lange.
   He said there is evidence that intelligence officials in East
Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Poland and the Soviet Union are
stepping up efforts to recruit spies among those who have applied
to come to the West.
   Intelligence-gathering can range from collecting train and bus
timetables to delivering secret protocols from the highest levels
of the West German government.
   A recent report compiled by the Constitutional Protection Office
provided rare details about East bloc espionage activities.
   Release of the report suggests counterintelligence officials
fear West Germans have become too complacent about the continuing
danger of espionage in the wake of improved ties with the East.
   ``Ethnic Germans who request to leave are clearly told that the
key to receiving an exit visa is to agree to cooperate,'' the
report said.
   But it said Romanian officials ``are among the most rigorous''
in efforts to force would-be emigres to spy.
   The report said that while East bloc intelligence agencies are
interested in all facets of life in West Germany, most espionage
activities are directed at military installations, government
offices and private industry.
   West German visitors to the East sometimes are approached to
carry out such operations, the report said.
   NATO troop movements remain of special interest.
   ``American facilities are given special attention,'' the report
said, adding that authorities had arrested one West German who had
spied for more than 30 years on field maneuvers of the Western
alliance.
   American servicemen also have been caught spying for the East.
   Lange and other security officials say they are giving priority
to ferreting out East bloc agents who eventually could work their
way into sensitive government and industry posts.
   ``You have to be alert for the long-term problem,'' Lange said.
``These people (East bloc spies) have endless patience.''

<TEXT>
   A career criminal who haunted the
streets of Stockholm in search of drugs and drink was convicted
Thursday of murdering Prime Minister Olof Palme in 1986 and was
sentenced to life in prison.
   Carl Gustav Christer Pettersson was found guilty by a Stockholm
District Court panel of two professional judges and six lay jurors.
   The two judges said there was not enough evidence to convict
Pettersson, but they were outvoted by the lay jurors. A simple
majority was needed for conviction.
   Pettersson's attorney said he would appeal.
   The laymen accepted the testimony of Lisbeth Palme, who
testified that she saw Pettersson, 42, standing near her husband
moments after he was shot in the back at close range while walking
home from a late movie on Feb. 28, 1986.
   An architect of Sweden's modern welfare state, Palme had been in
his fourth term as prime minister. He cultivated a reputation as an
international peacemaker.
   His death shocked many Swedes into the realization their
peaceful country was not immune to violence.
   In the years after the shooting, police looked for an
international conspiracy in an investigation marred by public
squabbles and frustrations.
   Three police chiefs and one justice minister resigned under
pressure. No one claimed the $8 million reward that was offered for
information leading to a conviction.
   Instead, routine police work led to the verdict. Pettersson, an
admitted abuser of amphetamines and alcohol, was questioned
immediately after the slaying but released because he had an alibi.
   A new team of investigators, sifting through previous
statements, found holes in his story, and he was arrested Dec. 14.
The trial began June 5.
   Pettersson was also convicted of endangering the life of Mrs.
Palme, who was grazed by a bullet.
   However, the reservations of judges Carl-Anton Spak and Mikael
af Geijerstam laid grounds for an appeal that could work in favor
of Pettersson, who has maintained his innocence.
   The murder weapon was never found. Neither Mrs. Palme nor any
other witness testified to seeing Pettersson with a gun in his
hand. No motive was established.
   ``There might be grounds, maybe good grounds'' for a reversal in
appellate court, defense attorney Arne Liljeros told Swedish radio.
He called the decision ``a halfway victory.'' The appellate court
is made up solely of judges.
   In the 46-page decision, the district court said Mrs. Palme
``with great certainty'' identified Pettersson as the man she saw
directly after her husband fell to the ground.
   ``The way she identified him at the trial is, according to the
court, very convincing,'' it said.
   Pettersson testified that he was 18 miles away at a suburban
train station when Palme was shot on a downtown street corner. One
witness supported his testimony. Others disputed it.
   Pettersson said he had left his suburban home to buy
amphetamines but was on the way home when Palme was killed.
   ``I was a bum,'' he told the court. ``I belonged to the A-Team''
_ a derisive label for drunks who sleep in parks and churchyards.
   ``I am a killer but not a murderer,'' he said. ``I did not kill
Prime Minister Olof Palme.''
   Pettersson was convicted of manslaughter in a fatal stabbing in
1970 near the spot where Palme was killed.
   Since the age of 19, Pettersson has been convicted of more than
60 crimes, mostly assault and theft.
   Professional jurists Spak and Geijerstam cast doubt on the
testimony of Mrs. Palme and others at the scene. They also pointed
to the lack of a motive.
   ``The possibility of a mistake must be considerable,'' the
judges said in their dissenting opinion.
   ``We think that the factor of uncertainty is so prominent that
we can't vote to convict,'' Geijerstam told reporters after the
verdict was announced.
   Under Swedish practice, lay jurors are selected from a pool of
citizens put forward by the country's political parties. In this
case, there were two Social Democrats, one member of the Moderate
Party, one from the Center Party, one Liberal and one Communist.
   They and the judges had equal votes.

<HEAD>Cambodian Factions Agree, Finally, On Seating At Conference</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cambodia's government and three resistance groups
ended a three-day standoff Thursday by agreeing on seating
arrangements at an international conference on Cambodia, French
officials said.
   Officials of the four Cambodian factions agreed to the
compromise at a meeting at the French Foreign Ministry, a ministry
spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with
departmental practice.
   A solution had been sought since Tuesday, when talks between
Prime Minister Hun Sen and the three resistance leaders _ Prince
Norodom Sihanouk, Khieu Samphan of the Khmer Rouge and Son Sann of
the non-communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front _ broke
off over the issue.
   Hun Sen rejected Sihanouk's proposal for one joint Cambodian
delegation, while Sihanouk would not accept Hun Sen's proposal for
two delegations _ one for Hun Sen's Vietnamese-backed government
and one grouping the three rebel organizations.
   Under the compromise, Cambodia will be one entity listed
alphabetically between Brunei and Canada, but with four
sub-delegations, with the factions seated in alphabetical order of
their groups' names.
   The Foreign Ministry spokesman said there were no plans for the
Cambodian leaders to meet again before the international conference
opens Sunday, with representatives from nearly 20 countries,
including Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   China, Vietnam, Britain, India, Indonesia and Thailand are among
the other countries attending the conference, which will try to
come up with a comprehensive peace package.
   Among proposals is sending monitors to confirm the withdrawal of
Vietnam's troops, which Hun Sen has promised will be complete by
Sept. 27. Sihanouk claims tens of thousands of Vietnamese are now
disguised as Cambodian soldiers.
   Also to be considered is international supervision of elections
to be held in Cambodia, possibly after formation of an interim
government that would have representatives of the resistance as
well as Hun Sen's government.
   A key issue is whether to let the Khmer Rouge participate in an
interim government. Hun Sen rejects the idea, saying the people
responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths before they were
ousted by a Vietnamese invasion in December 1978 should not be
trusted to share power.
   Sihanouk argues that the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge, the
strongest of the guerrilla factions, would continue to fight if
shut out of the government, thus ensuring continued strife in a
country that has suffered horribly for two decades.
   Hun Sen has proposed an early cease-fire, which Sihanouk says
can come only with a complete agreement. In the past week, fighting
has intensified between Hun Sen's troops and the guerrilla groups.
   Before the seating dispute was resolved, Hun Sen met Thursday
morning with Premier Michel Rocard. Hun Sen told reporters he had a
``good conversation'' with Rocard and described the meeting as
``important,'' without offering details.
   France recognizes neither the Vietnamese-installed government of
Hun Sen nor the exile Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea
over which Sihanouk presides.
   The Soviet-backed Vietnamese maintained about 100,000 troops in
Cambodia for several years but they have been gradually reduced in
preparation for the Sept 27 withdrawal date.
   The armed strength of the resistance is generally estimated at
more than 30,000 for the Khmer Rouge, 12,000 for the Khmer People's
National Liberation Front and 5,000 for the Sihanoukists.
   The Khmer Rouge were in power in Cambodia in 1975-1978. During
that time, hundreds of thousands of Cambodia's 8 million people
died from Khmer Rouge executions, famine and civil unrest.

<HEAD>Climate Change Bill Draws Warm Response</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill designed to spur research into the
threat of global climate change drew a warm response Thursday from
a wide range of scientists.
   The proposal ``represents a major step forward in coordinating
an effective scientific response to the pressing concerns of global
change,'' reported William R. Moomaw of the World Resources
Institute.
   Thomas F. Malone of the Holcomb Research Institute termed the
measure ``the single most important legislative'' proposal to have
been made concerning climate change.
   J. Christopher Bernabo of Science and Policy Associates, Inc.,
called the bill ``an important contribution toward establishing a
successful research and assessment program on global change.''
   The proposal drawing these and a flood of other laudatory
comments seeks to organize efforts to understand how human
activities have changed the climate, and threaten future changes.
   The comments came in testimony prepared for a joint hearing of
the House Science, Space and Technology subcommittees on natural
resources and international scientific cooperation.
   The panels are considering a bill to increase the authority of
the federal Committee on Earth Science, putting that group in
charge of coordinating climate change research being conducted
several federal agencies.
   The primary aim will be studies of the damage done to the
Earth's protective ozone layer and by the threatened warming of the
planet as a result of the so-called greenhouse effect.
   Scientists have grown increasingly concerned about damage to the
ozone layer in the stratosphere, which blocks most of the sun's
ultraviolet radiation. Chemicals produced by industry could damage
this layer, leading to an increase in skin cancer and damage to
crops and animal life.
   In addition, scientists and environmentalists worry about the
possibility of climate warming changing crop growth patterns,
melting the polar ice caps and changing the weather.
   Chemicals in the atmosphere, notably carbon dioxide, can trap
warmth from the sun that would otherwise radiate back out into
space. This process is not well understood, but many fear that, as
a greenhouse can overheat the plants inside, it would lead to
overheating of the Earth.
   ``Human activities may have set irreversible and undesirable
global changes into motion,'' warned Rep. James Scheuer, D-N.Y.
``As stewards of the planet we must step up, improve, and better
coordinate our scientific research efforts so that meaningful
preventive actions can be implemented.''
   Under the bill, the Committee on Earth Science would be given
authority to organize a global change research and assessment
programs and eliminate duplication between government agencies.
Efforts would also be made to coordinate the work with foreign
countries and the United Nations.
   Dallas Peck of the U.S. Geological Survey serves as chairman of
the Committee on Earth Science. Participants include the National
Science Foundation, Department of Transportation, National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Energy, Defense
Department, National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Agriculture, State
Department, Office of Science and Technology Policy and Council on
Environmental Quality.

<TEXT>
   A Senate panel on Thursday approved President
Bush's nominations of Michael Deland as chairman of the Council of
Environmental Quality and John F. Turner as director of the Fish
and Wildlife Service.
   The unanimous vote by the Senate Environment and Public Works
Committee sent the two nominations, plus those of three other top
environmental officials, to the Senate floor for final approval.
   Deland gained a reputation as a strong environmental advocate
during five years as head of the Environmental Protection Agency's
New England office, where he was lauded by conservation groups.
   The three-member CEQ was created to advise the president on
environmental issues and assure that agencies study the
environmental impact of their plans. It's budget and staff were
deeply cut under the Reagan administration, however. The nomination
of Turner, a former Wyoming state senator, has been applauded by
conservation groups.
   A trained wildlife biologist, Turner owns a ranch near the Grand
Teton National Park and has been suggested in recent years as a
possible candidate for statewide office.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service is responsible for managing the
National Wildlife Refuge System, which includes 90 million acres in
more than 450 wildlife refuges and more than 70 fish hatcheries.
   The panel also approved the nominations of Constance Harriman as
Turner's deputy, Timothy Atkeson as assistant EPA administrator for
international affairsand J. Clarence Davies as assistant EPA
administrator for planning and evaluation.

   The Bible-reading criminal convicted of
killing Prime Minister Olof Palme admitted he abused alcohol, took
drugs and even killed a man _ but didn't shoot Palme.
   ``I was a bum,'' Carl Gustav Christer Pettersson said as his
five-week trial opened June 5. ``It's actually surprising that
anyone at all has anything positive to say about me.''
   Pettersson, convicted and sentenced to life in prison Thursday,
is a veteran of one of the world's most lenient penal systems,
where early releases are routine. His criminal record lists more
than 60 crimes, most of them petty theft and assault, one for
manslaughter.
   But the 42-year-old unemployed loner maintained he was innocent
of shooting Palme on Feb. 28, 1986. His lawyer said he would appeal
the conviction.
   ``I am a killer but not a murderer,'' Pettersson had told the
court.
   The trial disclosed a life of drug use, alcohol abuse and petty
crime. It exposed the complex character of a Bible-reading man who
liked children, wrote poetry and scared friends with his erratic,
violent behavior.
   Pettersson was born into a middle-class family on April 23,
1947. A promising child, he read Homer at the age of 10 and had no
evident problems in school until suffering a concussion as a
teen-ager.
   At 19, he started taking drugs. His life took a criminal turn
and developed into a roller coaster of euphoria, jails and mental
hospitals.
   Pettersson studied acting in the 1960s, but dropped out of
acting school after being accused of theft.
   There were conflicting accounts of his political views _ or of
whether he had any.
   During the trial, he described himself as an admirer of Palme.
The four-term prime minister was a champion of social democratic
causes and a leading architect of Sweden's welfare state.
   After the slaying, Pettersson signed several public letters of
condolence.
   However, friends testified that Pettersson bore a deep hatred
toward Sweden's highly structured society, where drugs are not
tolerated and drinking is officially discouraged.
   Newspapers speculated that he developed a hatred for Palme in
1980 after contacts in jail with a right-wing extremist.
   In 1970, Pettersson escaped from a mental hospital, got into an
argument with a stranger and killed him with a bayonet.
   The slaying occurred close to where Palme was gunned down 16
years later. Evidence at the time indicated that Pettersson fled
the scene down a small side street, the same one taken by Palme's
killer.
   Pettersson was convicted of manslaughter, held in a psychiatric
ward and released after seven months.
   He was arrested for the Palme slaying in December 1988.

   Attorney Mark Murphy says he learned a
lesson when he used mouth-to-snout resuscitation to revive his
drowning springer spaniel: Five minutes ``is a long time to blow
down a dog's nose.''
   The cardio-puppy resuscitation occurred after Murphy's year-old
spaniel, McLean, fell into a culvert Tuesday behind Murphy's house
and was swept away.
   ``I ran down to the other end and waited for him,'' Murphy said.
But when Murphy retrieved McLean, the dog's heart had stopped.
Murphy began CPR.
   ``I didn't know how fast his (McLean's) heart was pumping, but I
used the regular five breaths to 15 counts,'' Murphy said. ``It
probably took about five minutes or so, which is a long time to
blow down a dog's nose.''
   The technique worked.
   Murphy's heroic rescue got less than a hero's reception in his
office.
   ``One of the other co-workers said they always said I had dog
breath,'' he said.

   When a team of eight horses got away from
Ray Croteau while he was plowing fields in Alberta, Canada, he
wasn't frightened. He was exhilarated.
   That was 53 years ago. Today, Croteau lets his horses get away
from him almost every night of the week.
   Croteau, along with several other Canadians and their families,
race chuckwagons behind teams of four thoroughbred race horses in
thunderous competition _ a favorite of spectators this week at
Cheyenne Frontier Days.
   ``You don't really appreciate it until they wreck,'' an onlooker
said. ``They take their lives into their own hands.''
   But to Croteau, 61, ``I don't think it's any more dangerous than
driving down the road.''
   The roar of the crowd matches the rumble of the wagons as the
four teams race astride. With only about two feet separating each
team from the next, the flinch of the driver's wrist can make the
difference to life and limb.
   The first chuckwagon races began during the cattle drives of the
19th century.
   ``After a long day, they'd have a race to the first town or
tavern _ they'd throw the stove in the wagon and go,'' Croteau said.
   True to the tradition, a `stove' (actually a small keg barrel)
is ceremoniously tossed into the back of the modern-day chuckwagons
as part of the race. If the stove falls out, a four-second penalty
is levied.

<TEXT>
   President Bush signed legislation Thursday
elevating diplomatic relations with the Marshall Islands and
Micronesia to full embassy status.
   The United States liberated the islands from the Japanese in
fierce battles in World War II and administered them under a United
Nations trusteeship until late 1986.
   Since then, Bush said, ``these countries have been our partners
in free association.''
   Now, under the new agreements, ``our current representative
offices in Majuro, the Marshall Islands, and in Kolonia,
Micronesia, will become full-fledged embassies with resident
American ambassadors,'' he said.
   ``The same welcome transformation will occur here in
Washington,'' said Bush, paying tribute to Wilfred Kendall of the
Marshall Islands and Jesse Marehalau of Micronesia in their new
status as ambassadors.
   Bush, in a written statement distributed by his press office,
also honored Rep. Bob Lagomarsino, R-Calif., who introduced the
bill and ``has been a tireless supporter of the American position
in the Pacific.''
   Bush has not yet nominated an ambassador to the islands.

   Come September, ex-Beatle Paul McCartney and some
of his friends will be a band on the run, again.
   McCartney said Thursday he will begin a world tour starting in
September and promote the environmental group Friends of the Earth
along the way.
   The tour, McCartney's first in 13 years, kicks off in Oslo,
Norway, Sept. 26 and rolls through nine countries in Europe before
heading out to Asia and North and South America, wrapping up in the
summer of 1990.
   McCartney, 47, said he will play in the United States in
November or December and again later in the tour, but gave no
details on scheduled stops.
   Joining the bandwagon of stars campaigning to save the
environment from acid rain and to halt the depletion of the
atmosphere's ozone layer, he said: ``When I was a kid, if you had
told me when I grew up there would be a hole in the sky and the
rain would have acid in it and the seas would have nuclear
pollution in them, I wouldn't have believed you.
   ``Basically, we are just trying to help to save the planet.''
   McCartney said he wasn't concerned about becoming one more rock
star with a cause.
   ``You mean the boredom factor of doing these environmental
things? Yeah, it is boring, but unfortunately if we don't get
boring we're going to get dead.''
   Friends of the Earth will be promoted in the concert brochure
distributed to all ticket holders, and the organization's
literature and merchandise, including T-shirts, will be available
at all the venues.
   Photographer Linda McCartney, who is touring with her husband,
said the family used biodegradable products, kept many animals on
their organic farm, near Rye in southeast England, and were
vegetarians.
   ``We love animals so we've decided not to eat them,'' she said.
   Immigration authorities have cleared him to enter Japan,
McCartney said.
   ``I kind of missed it last time I went there,'' he quipped.
   In January 1980, he was detained and then deported from Tokyo
after being stopped by Japanese customs officials who found a bag
of marijuana in his suitcase when he arrived for a concert tour.
   McCartney said he was looking forward to going to Hamburg for
the first time since he and the other Beatles got their
international start in the West German city in 1960. Other stops on
the tour include Frankfurt, Paris, Rome and London.
   Reporters asked him why he decided to tour now.
   ``We've got a band, it helps,'' McCartney joked, but added:
``It's not really an image band. ... We try to get the music
right.''
   His band includes bass player Hamish Stuart, formerly of the
Average White Band; guitarist Robbie McIntosh, formerly of The
Pretenders; drummer Chris Whitten and Wix, one of Britain's top
session keyboard players.
   McCartney insisted, as he has in the past, that there can be no
Beatles reunion because of the death of John Lennon, but he did not
rule out getting together to play with former band members George
Harrison and Ringo Starr.
   McCartney said he and Harrison discussed writing a song
together, calling that ``an exciting possibility.''

<HEAD>Senate Panel Approves Spill Cleanup Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate panel angry over Exxon's handling of
the Alaskan oil spill approved legislation Thursday to give the
federal government a much greater role in such cleanups and to
establish a $1 billion, industry-financed fund to pay for the work.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, predicted quick
action by the full Senate next week on the bill, which would put
the president in charge of spills immediately while potentially
limiting the cost to oil companies for damages.
   Members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee
said Exxon's recent confirmation that it would pull cleanup crews
out of Alaska's Prince William Sound Sept. 15 spurred them to quick
action.
   ``This outrageous decision ... could not happen once this bill
is passed,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.
   The voice vote approval shows ``indignation with the fact that
Exxon has apparently decided it's had enough and is in fact
quitting,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.
   On Tuesday, a day after word leaked out that Exxon would pull
its cleanup crews out, the company said it was not ruling out a
resumption of the cleanup next spring. Transportation Secretary
Samuel Skinner said that, in fact, little could be done to clean
affected areas during cold weather.
   Exxon has been criticized for a slow response to the March 24
grounding of the tanker Valdez, which poured some 11 million
gallons of Alaskan crude into Prince William Sound.
   The oil company estimates it has spent about $1.25 billion to
clean the wilderness area, but state officials believe only about
one-third of the needed work has been completed. Alaska's governor,
Steve Cowper, and Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said they
expect Exxon's crews to remain until the job is done.
   Under the Senate measure, the federal government would become
responsible for cleanup action as soon as an oil spill happens. The
president would have authority to order a company to remain at a
cleanup site and could call in federal authorities if the work is
not adequate.
   Another provision would set up regional response teams to have
cleanup crews with equipment for handling spills close at hand, a
response to complaints that Exxon had to send thousands of miles
for the right equipment to remove oil from the sound.
   The government would draw on a $1 billion emergency fund, paid
for by the a fee charged oil companies, to pay for a cleanup.
   But the measure would also cap a company's financial liability
for most spills at $500 per gross ton, far less than Exxon has paid
for the Alaska spill, unless the company showed ``gross and
wilfull'' negligence
   Mitchell, who wrote the original bill, admitted the cap might
also limit companies' financial incentive to avoid spills, but told
members it was needed to keep insurance costs from skyrocketing.
``Large sums of money would be immediately available (through the
industry fund) without the need for years of litigation,'' said
Mitchell. ``The benefits outweigh the disadvantages.''
   An official with the Arco Oil Co. told the committee last week
the company supports giving the federal government sole
responsibility for oil-spill cleanups.
   Mitchell said other Senate committees must still approve
portions of the bill that concern revenues, but he expects a vote
by the Senate before the August congressional recess begins next
week.
   The fast-track approach could make the bill law by the fall.
   A similar measure has been passed by the House Merchant Marine
and Fisheries Committee and the House Public Works and
Transportation Committee is also scheduled to consider that measure
next week.

   Indians say life on the St. Regis Mohawk
Reservation has become like living behind the Iron Curtain because
of a week-long standoff between police and a militant faction.
   ``It's way out of proportion now,'' said Birdie Johnson, one of
about 4,500 residents of the reservation straddling the
U.S.-Canadian border in northern New York. ``It's like living in a
communist country.''
   The standoff has existed on the 14,460-acre reservation since
state troopers and FBI agents raided the territory's seven illegal
gambling casinos July 20, the second raid in as many months.
Thirteen arrests were made.
   In response, an unofficial band of heavily armed warriors
claiming to be a security force erected roadblocks to keep the
police from returning. And state police set up roadblocks outside
the reservation.
   ``We can't go anywhere. People are staying in their homes. We
are in a state of occupation and police have effectively sealed the
reservation off,'' said Doug George, editor of the reservation
newspaper, Akwesasne Notes.
   Until Monday, state police blocked everyone except residents
from entering the reservation. They've relaxed those restrictions
somewhat this week, allowing in vehicles carrying food, medicine
and other supplies.
   But non-residents with no business on the reservation are still
prohibited from entering.
   ``It is my opinion ... that the situation is not such that there
is any type of assurance that the public would be safe,'' said
state police Maj. Ronald Brooks.
   Because police were prevented from entering the reservation,
they would be unable to assist stranded motorists and emergency
crews would be helpless in responding to accidents, said state
police Sgt. Michael Downs.
   Authorities also are concerned about alcohol, guns, ammunition,
explosives and ``undesirables'' getting onto the reservation, he
said.
   Inside, the reservation is patrolled by the militant warrior
group, which calls itself the Mohawk Sovereignty Security Force. It
is not recognized by tribal leaders.
   Members of that group have vowed not to disband until the
troopers leave. State police say they aren't going anywhere until
the militant faction disperses.
   The standoff has disrupted or closed most reservation businesses
and led to the cancellation of summer school and tribal leaders
have met daily to try to find a solution.
   The community is divided over the gambling _ many view it as a
form of economic development _ and angered by both the continued
police presence and occupation by the renegade Indian group.
   ``This will split the community for many years. The division is
long and hard and won't mend itself for a long time,'' said former
chief Brenda LaFrance.
   Although there is strong support for Mohawk sovereignty, there
appears to be only a small group willing to back the warrior
faction's stand against police.
   ``If the majority of the community has a choice between the
security force and the police patrols, they're going to want the
police,'' said Chief Harold Tarbell.
   One of the difficulties in reaching a solution is that tribal
leaders are hesitant to involve security force representatives in
the process, said George.
   ``We've tried to get the force to disband, but they won't. They
are like the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization). They are
there and they are a factor, but to involve them in negotiations is
to legitimize them,'' he said.

   Nissan employees' rejection of the
United Auto Workers in Smyrna is a sign that American workers want
cooperation _ not conflict _ with management, an industry analyst
said Thursday.
   Nissan workers voted 1,622-711 Wednesday and Thursday to keep
the union out. The plant is one of three fully Japanese-owned auto
plants in the United States. None is organized by the United Auto
Workers.
   Workers who embraced Japanese-style participatory management at
Nissan feared the union would mean a return to the adversarial
labor relations of the past, said David Cole, an industry expert at
the University of Michigan.
   ``The live-in-the-past movement in particular has been given a
very sharp blow. In fact, they're dead in the water,'' said Cole,
director of the Office for Study of Automotive Transportation at
the university's Transportation Research Institute.
   Other analysts said the Nissan vote proves Japanese automakers
can shut out the UAW as long as workers are well paid.
   A UAW faction called New Directions wants the union to turn away
from cooperative-style agreements. ``These workers in Smyrna saw
the significant battle in the New Directions movement, and that was
a turnoff for them,'' Cole said.
   Cole said the vote does not spell doom for the UAW but that the
union is not going to regain its dominant role in the industry any
time soon.
   ``Organized labor is different today from organized labor of 20,
30 years ago,'' he said. ``It has a harmonious relationship with
management and realizes international competition.''
   Nissan's management style gives workers a say in production and
organizes the shop floor into teams whose members rotate tasks as
frequently as every two hours.
   Wages at the plant range from $11.10 to $15.74 an hour plus
$1.45-an-hour guaranteed bonuses. Other bonuses are tied to quality
and financial performance. Although that is slightly below wage
rates at UAW plants, the cost of living is low in central Tennessee.
   ``It looks as if the Japanese-owned plants are going to stay
non-union,'' David Healey, an analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert in
New York, said Thursday.
   The UAW organizing campaign had charged that production
speed-ups at Smyrna were causing a high number of injuries.
   But Healey said: ``As long as the Japanese-owned plants pay the
same wages as the unionized plants, the workers aren't going to
vote for the union. I don't think the union proved its case with
the plant workers there. Bottom line _ they didn't believe there's
serious safety problems and fast line speeds inside the plant.''
   UAW organizer Ben Perkins said the union sees the rejection
``just like any other defeat.''
   ``We lost the battle because of an intensive non-union camp that
was begun when the plant was first built,'' he said Thursday on
NBC's ``Today'' show. He said that the work force of 2,400 was
hired out of 130,000 applicants.
   ``For the last six years they have received doses of anti-union
propaganda over a closed-circuit TV system inside the plant,''
Perkins said. ``In addition, in the last week of the campaign they
were bombarded with threats and intimidation, loss of benefits if
they chose to join the union.''
   A professor on labor relations at Cornell University, Harry
Katz, said the fight had tarnished Japanese industry's reputation.
   ``Management wins in the short run, but did they win in the long
run?'' he asked. ``I think the irony here is that the Japanese,
with this reputation of consensus decision-making and little overt
conflict, are the ones who end up in a very bitter adversarial
battle, not only with the union but with their own work force.''
   In contrast, Vanderbilt University sociologist Daniel Cornfield
called the defeat a ``crack in the wall'' at the UAW even though
only 2,400 potential members were at stake.
   ``For the first time if 50 years, there's a small but
established pocket of non-union production in the United States,''
he said.

Service out of business for about two hours, the agency reported
Thursday.
   A power surge during the storm caused a short in two computers
in suburban Suitland, Md., where incoming weather data is compiled
into national forecasts and distributed to local weather offices
around the country.
   The computers were out of service from 5 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. EDT
Wednesday, the Weather Service reported. Some computer problems
were still being reported Thursday, and officials were working to
resolve those.
   The national forecasts are distributed to local Weather Service

<HEAD>HUD's Ex-New York Regional Administrator Gets $125,000 Real Estate
Job</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   HUD's New York regional administrator was
hired as the chief executive of a real estate firm in January 1988
after years of making housing recommendations that earned the
company millions of dollars, records and published reports show.
   Joseph D. Monticciolo left the Department of Housing and Urban
Development to become board chairman and chief executive of Eagle
Capital Group, a Manhattan-based investment firm whose partners
include wealthy developer Sheldon Goldstein. Monticciolo is paid
$125,000 a year, the company's lawyer told Newsday.
   Government records and recent published reports reveal that as
HUD administrator, Monticciolo made recommendations to his
superiors that directly benefitted Goldstein's real estate
companies. Most members of Eagle were also reportedly part of a
Goldstein-led investment group that bought seven housing projects
from HUD in 1983 _ putting up only $550,000 cash _ and sold them
three years later at an estimated $17 million profit.
   Monticciolo, a 51-year-old architect from Woodbury, N.Y., is
scheduled to testify Friday before the House subcommittee
investigating alleged abuses at HUD.
   Neither Monticciolo nor Goldstein could be reached for comment
Thursday. A woman answering the phone at Eagle Capital said both
men were out. Monticciolo's father-in-law, Michael Fazio, said
Monticciolo was meeting with his lawyer.
   Asked whether Monticciolo would invoke his Fifth Amendment
rights Friday, Fazio said, ``I won't say yes and I won't say no.''
   Two other ex-HUD officials who have appeared before the House
Government Operations subcommittee on employment and housing,
Deborah Gore Dean and R. Hunter Cushing, have refused to testify.
   For nearly six years, Monticciolo oversaw HUD programs in New
York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. On his
last financial disclosure form filed with the federal government,
Monticciolo listed a 15 percent ownership in Eagle. He did not
place a monetary value on his share.
   Eagle's 10 initial investors put up a total of $500,000 to
launch the company, according to a New York Newsday investigation
published last month. However, Monticciolo kicked in just ``several
hundred dollars'' rather than the $75,000 that would have been his
proportionate share, the paper found.
   Some of the investors _ not Monticciolo _ signed personal
guarantees to borrow another $500,000, bringing Eagle's total
capital to $1 million, Newsday found.
   Eagle is partners with Cleofe Rubi, a prominent Puerto Rican
contractor, in a San Juan hotel project, according to the Wall
Street Journal. Rubi reportedly is the landlord for HUD's offices
in Puerto Rico and was involved in at least three HUD moderate
rehabilitation projects in the commonwealth.
   The mod rehab program has been suspended following allegations
that the money went to consultants and developers with connections
to high-ranking HUD officials.
   Rubi and other prominent Puerto Ricans contributed $18,000 to
New York Sen. Alfonse D'Amato's campaign on the same day in 1987, a
month before the senator sought mod rehab funding for Puerto Rico,
according to HUD and Federal Election Commission records. D'Amato
requested money for 525 units in Puerto Rico but only 130 units in
New York, according to an internal HUD memo obtained under the
Freedom of Information Act.
   On his last financial disclosure form, Monticciolo reported
hotel and meal reimbursements for two trips to Puerto Rico, in May
and August 1987, to attend meetings of the Mortgage Bankers
Association of Puerto Rico and the Puerto Rico Home Builders
Association.
   Deborah Gore Dean, who became Pierce's executive assistant upon
Lance Wilson's departure, told the Wall Street Journal in May that
Monticciolo got his job as HUD regional administrator through
D'Amato, and that the two of them ``did what they could for people
who raised money and supported'' the senator.
   ``I'm not worried about that,'' she added. ``It's the system of
spoils and favoritism.''
   In 1982, HUD came under fire for its dealings with First
American Housing Preservation Association, a Goldstein company set
up the year before to acquire HUD projects.
   Shortly after First American was incorporated, Edward Weidenfeld
became a director and counsel to the company. Weidenfeld had been
counsel to the Reagan campaign committee. His wife, Sheila, Betty
Ford's former press secretary and a member of the Reagan transition
team at HUD, owned 50 percent of the company.
   Weidenfeld arranged a meeting between First American and HUD
officials, including Monticciolo and Philip Winn, HUD's
then-federal housing commissioner. Soon thereafter, HUD agreed to
sell seven apartment buildings to First American rather than put
them out for public bidding, as required by law. Two of the seven
projects were in Connecticut; the others were in New York and New
Jersey. HUD also proposed lending the buyers all but $550,000 of
the $10.9 million sale price.
   The negotiations were exposed in May 1982 by The Washington
Post, leading to investigations by Congress and HUD's inspector
general.
   HUD later agreed to seek bids for the projects, but then sold
the properties to the Goldstein group anyway, under the original
terms.
   In 1984, Monticciolo urged his superiors to increase a $1.6
million government loan given to Goldstein's company for
rehabilitation of the Surrey-Carlton Apartments in Spring Valley,
N.Y. Monticciolo said the group needed the additional money to buy
three adjacent acres of land to conform with local parking
requirements.
   But the request was denied when HUD headquarters in Washington
discovered that Goldstein was a 30 percent partner in the company
that owned the land.
   Also in 1984, Monticciolo made a recommendation to Washington
that eventually enabled the Goldstein group to make a $17 million
profit on the seven-apartment deal.
   Goldstein wrote Monticciolo asking that his company be allowed
to prepay all the outstanding mortgages and rehabilitation loans on
the properties, even though the terms of the loans barred
prepayment for 15 years, Newsday reported.
   Four days later, Monticciolo wrote to Maurice Barksdale, then
federal housing commissioner, recommending the prepayment plan,
Newsday found. The mortgages were prepaid May 30, 1985. By the end
of 1986, the paper revealed, the Goldstein group had sold the seven
HUD properties for more than $27 million.

   To dramatize the reunification issue,
a student changed her plans for returning from North Korea and said
Thursday she would start fasting unless Seoul allows her parents to
come for her, sources said.
   Witnesses reported Im Su-kyong appeared near tears at a rally in
the border village of Panmunjom, in the demilitarized zone
separating the nations, where about 500 North Koreans and
foreigners waved banners and flags saying ``Korea is one.''
   She declared at the rally: ``Unless my parents come to pick me
up, I will not cross the military demarcation line.''
   In Seoul, thousands of riot police were deployed at campuses and
in the downtown area to block demonstrations in support of Miss Im
as a ``national unification heroine.''
   Riot troopers firing tear gas stormed the Seoul National
University campus when about 250 students armed with metal pipes,
clubs and rocks tried to march out. No injuries or arrests were
reported.
   Police arrested 20 Roman Catholic priests en route to the border
after circling their cars at a checkpoint. Several priests were
pushed and shoved when they at first refused to get out of their
cars to be loaded into police vans.
   Miss Im, a 20-year-old student from Seoul's Hankuk University of
Foreign Studies defied a ban on travel to communist North Korea and
attended the World Festival for Youth and Students in Pyongyang on
July 1-8.
   Witnesses and military sources at Panmunjom, who asked not to be
identified, said Miss Im arrived at the truce village at noon with
peace marchers said to include pacifists from 30 nations.
   Only about half a dozen people were visible on the southern side
of the border, including two South Korean soldiers assigned to the
U.N. Command, which has jurisdiction in the southern half of the
zone, the witnesses said.
   ``The action was all on the North's side,'' one said, adding
that the visitors spent six hours touring Panmunjom, singing songs,
holding rallies with speeches broadcast on loudspeakers, and
released white doves and balloons before leaving on buses.
   South Korean and foreign journalists were barred from Panmunjom
on Thursday.
   Radicals and dissidents, a vocal minority in South Korea, view
Miss Im's case as a symbol of their demands for unification and
withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea.
   South Korea, which has made travel to North Korea a crime under
the national security law, says unification talks must be conducted
through official channels. The government has said Miss Im would be
arrested upon her return.
   A witness said Miss Im was approached by a group of North
Koreans shortly before she spoke to a rally late in the afternoon
and appeared afterward to be shaken, in tears and barely able to
speak.
   One military source said what sounded like an American voice
could be heard afterward saying over the loudspeaker: ``Just a few
moments ago, North Korean military informed us that they could not
permit Miss Im to cross the border, in order to prevent a possible
incident'' in the demilitarized zone.
   Shortly afterward, Miss Im appeared again and said she would
fast until her parents came to meet her and she was allowed to
cross the frontier.

<HEAD>Pace Is Economy's Slowest in Nearly 3 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. economic growth slowed to a lackluster
annual rate of 1.7 percent in the spring while inflation, driven by
higher food and energy costs, raced ahead at the fastest pace in
more than six years, the government reported Thursday.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product, the
broadest measure of economic health, turned in its weakest showing
since mid-1986 as growth was held back by a slump in auto sales and
housing construction.
   The Bush administration insisted that the GNP report did not
raise the specter of an imminent recession, but private economists
were not as confident.
   They expressed concerns that the year-long effort on the part of
the Federal Reserve Board to fight inflation with higher interest
rates had taken its toll on the economic recovery, which has
already lasted a peactime record of 6{ years.
   While the Federal Reserve has reversed course and is now
lowering interest rates in an effort to keep the economy moving
forward, some analysts worried that the about-face has come too
late.
   The 1.7 percent GNP increase in the April-June quarter was down
sharply from a revised 3.7 percent advance in the first three
months of the year although the January-March figure was inflated
by a bounceback in the farm sector from last year's drought.
   The second quarter growth rate was the weakest since a 0.8
percent rise in the third quarter of 1986, the last time the
economy skirted close to a recession.
   Inflationary pressures grew more intense in the spring, as well,
with a price index tied to the GNP rising at an annual rate of 4.9
percent, the biggest increase since 1982.
   Administration economists said they believed the surge in energy
and food costs was abating. They said this lessening of
inflationary pressures would give the Fed more room to lower
interest rates and this would provide the spark for a rebound in
growth in the second half of the year.
   ``We believe that the economy will continue to do well,'' said
Michael Boskin, chairman of the president's Council of Economic
Advisers. ``We believe that modest growth will continue.''
   The Bush administration last week slightly lowered its economic
forecast for this year, putting growth at 2.9 percent instead of
3.2 percent. Even with this downward revision, the economy will
have to grow at a 2.7 percent rate in the second half of the year
for the adminstration to meet its target for 1989.
   Many private economists said they were looking for growth in the
final half of this year to be a much weaker 1.0 percent.
   ``I see no signs that the economy is picking up,'' said Lawrence
Chimerine, senior adviser to the WEFA Group, an economic consulting
firm. ``We have moved into a very slow-growth environment and the
only question is whether it will deteriorate into a recession.''
   Jerry Jordan, chief economist of First Interstate Bancorp of Los
Angeles, said he believes the country has already entered into a
short recession with GNP figures in both the current third quarter
and the fourth quarter turning negative.
   ``We think we will have a fairly short and shallow recession
with a rebound occurring in the first quarter of next year,'' he
said.
   But most other analysts are predicting that the economy can
skirt an outright downturn but will suffer through a so-called
growth recession, a period when the economy expands at such a
sluggish pace that unemployment rises.
   David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, another
consulting firm, predicted that unemployment, which currently
stands at 5.3 percent, would rise to around 6 percent by early next
year because of a prolonged period of sub-par growth.
   ``Right now we appear on track for the Fed's hoped-for soft
landing,'' said David Wyss, an econommist with DRI-McGraw Hill,
referring to a period when growth slows enough to dampen
inflationary pressures but not enough to pitch the economy into a
slump.
   After driving up interest rates for a year, the Fed switched in
June and since then has made three small moves to push rates lower,
including an easing move earlier this week. The adverse effects of
the earlier tightening were apparent in the GNP report.
   Housing construction plunged at an annual rate of 13.6 percent
in the second quarter, the steepest decline since the first quarter
of 1982, when the country was mired in the last recession.
   Personal consumption spending rose at a sluggish rate of 1.1
percent, held back by a 4.0 percent drop in spending on big-ticket
items such as autos.
   Trade also weakened in the spring as a big surge in imports,
primarily oil, erased much of the increase in U.S. export sales.
   With Thursday's report, the Commerce Department revised its GNP
data for the last three years. Those revisions generally showed the
economy was stronger than previously believed.
   Growth in 1988 was revised upward to 4.4 percent, instead of an
earlier figure of 3.9 percent. This was the strongest annual growth
rate since a 6.8 percent increase in 1984.
   The various changes left the GNP growing at an annual rate of
$4.12 trillion in the second quarter.

<HEAD>Official Says Washington Concerned by High-Tech Leaks to Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MORT ROSENBLUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illegal technology transfers to the Soviet Union
may be increasing despite growing Western efforts to stem the flow,
a State Department official said Thursday.
   ``We have evidence that (transfers) continue unabated ... and
may have even increased,'' said Allan Wendt, in charge of State
Department strategic technology policy. ``That troubles us
immensely. That is a very real problem.''
   Wendt met with reporters on what he called a routine trip to
consult some partners in the 17-member Coordinating Committee for
Multilateral Export Controls _ CoCom _ based in Paris.
   Saying CoCom's purpose was not to impose political sanctions but
to reduce the military threat to the West, Wendt said CoCom
partners had no plans to change the preferred status given China,
despite last month's crackdown on its pro-democracy movement. But
he said there would be no more concessions to Beijing.
   ``No one wishes to roll back what has already been
accomplished,'' he said. ``For further liberalization, this is not
the time. The policy is not abandoned, but it is in suspense.''
   Although he declined to discuss specific CoCom violations, Wendt
acknowledged that U.S. authorities were concerned with sensitive
exports leaving West Germany for the Soviet bloc.
   A U.S. Defense Department document obtained by The Associated
Press earlier this year identified West Germany as a major source
of technology leakage.
   Wendt said officials in Bonn assured him they were tightening
license procedures, penalties and enforcement, and that the West
Germans were aware of possible leaks because of joint ventures with
Moscow.
   ``We believe their response has been very encouraging,'' said
Wendt.
   Although draft legislation to tighten exports is pending, West
German officials were limited to firmer application of existing
rules until the new laws were passed, Wendt said.
   Also, he said, exports were vital to the West German economy,
creating political pressures.
   West Germany, among other CoCom partners, has argued forcefully
that excessive U.S. caution stifles trade and ties down enforcing
agents.
   Wendt said that Washington tends to be a ``a bit more risk
averse,'' than its CoCom partners, but that no fundamental
differences divided the organization.
   Last week, CoCom partners agreed to remove export controls on
some desktop computers, such as the AT, a widely used IBM model.
Some other controls were relaxed. Wendt said the decisions would
take effect Aug. 15.
   Earlier, Washington abandoned the ``no exceptions'' policy
imposed on the Soviet Union after the Red Army moved into
Afghanistan in 1979 to prop up the pro-Moscow regime. The sanction
banned all sensitive exports with no possibility of case-by-case
review. The last Soviet troops left Afghanistan in February.
   Wendt said the Bush administration wanted to respond positively
to Soviet reforms, and ``to integrate the Soviet Union into the
international system and encourage it to use its power and
potential to solve international problems rather than exploit
them.''
   At the same time, he said, ``We must not forget that even if
political and economic relations improve, there is a continuing
need to deny them the goods and technologies to enhance their
military capacity.''
   CoCom members are Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark,
France, Greece, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway,
Portugal, Spain, Turkey, West Germany and the United States.

<HEAD>More Than 900 Regents Exams Thrown Out Because of Cheating</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Results of more than 900 statewide exams at
six New York City area schools have been thrown out in the wake of
a June cheating scandal, state Education Department officials said
Thursday.
   The department also will change the way it distributes the
Regents tests for next month's makeup of a canceled chemistry exam,
said State Education Commissioner Thomas Sobol. He said other
measures are being considered to counter security breaches.
   The invalidated tests are the result of a cheating scandal that
erupted last month when the New York Post published the answer key
of a Regents chemistry test to illustrate a busy black market in
stolen exams.
   Results of a sophomore level math test, given the same day as
the scheduled chemistry exam, were canceled at six schools. In one
school, some students had U.S. history test results invalidated.
   There were 400 math test results thrown out one school and an
unknown number of tests invalidated at another, Sobol said. One
test result was discarded at each of three other schools. School
officials announced last month that an estimated 500 test results
were thrown out at the sixth school.
   Sobol said three other schools have indicated that they may
invalidate results for some or all of their students, but they
haven't made a final decision. He would not identify the schools.
The schools do the invalidating based on their knowledge of a
student's past performance.
   Regents tests, given in 17 subjects, generally account for about
25 percent of a student's high school grade and are used to measure
how well students learn a state-mandated curriculum. Regents exams
are not necessary for a high school diploma.
   For the Aug. 17 chemistry test, Sobol said the exams will be
delivered to each school either on the morning they are given or
the day before.
   For next year's exams, the Education Department is considering
requiring that principals pick up the test papers at regional
distribution centers spread throughout the state on the week exams
are given, Sobol said.
   Officials want to see how the August procedure works before
making a final decision on future security measures, said
department spokesman Christopher Carpenter.
   Previously, the Education Department had delivered tests to each
school principal five days in advance, where the school official
was to keep them under lock and key.
   Sobol also said he'd like the legislature to make stealing exams
a felony instead of a misdemeanor, increasing penalties. The
department is also exploring the possibility of electronic
distribution of answer keys, he said.

   A commercial helicopter developed
engine trouble and plunged into the sea Thursday off the country's
east coast, killing at least 12 of 20 people aboard, official news
reports said.
   The helicopter had begun its shuttle service between a resort
island and the mainland the day before the crash.
   Korean Broadcasting System said the three crew members and three
passengers were rescued, but the others, mostly vacationers, were
trapped in the aircraft. The broadcast said two passengers were
missing.
   The bodies of the 12 were recovered from the Sikorsky copter
S-58T, which was towed to Ullung Island off the southeast coast,
the state-run television said.
   The report said no foreigners were aboard.
   The network said the aircraft developed engine trouble and
crashed into the sea shortly after taking off from Ullung Island.
It was en route to Pohang, a coastal city 130 miles southwest of
the resort island in the Sea of Japan.
   Korean Broadcasting System said divers were searching for the
missing.
   It said Air Universal Service Co., a private South Korean
company, recently bought the copter. Officials at the company were
not immediately available for comment.
   The S-58T line of helicopters was built by Sikorsky Aircraft in
Stratford, Conn., from 1970 to 1976, according to Sikorsky
spokesman William Tuttle.
   However, spokesman Jake Dangle of California Helicopters
International in Ventura, said his firm sold three Sikorsky S-58Ts
to the South Koreans last year. He said his company had completely
rebuilt them, and they had no flight hours logged when they were
sold.

   A woman who told her three children, ``The devil
is in you. I have to kill you,'' ignored warnings to drop her
knife, stabbed her 9-year-old daughter and was shot dead Thursday
by police, authorities said.
   The girl was in critical condition and undergoing surgery at
Brookdale Hospital. She had a deep wound in her abdomen and slashes
in her arm and finger, said Detective Joseph McConville.
   Her brothers, ages 6 and 7, were not physically harmed and were
brought to the police stationhouse to wait for their father, who
police said was working on Long Island.
   Police said the parents were separated and the father had
custody of the children. Neighbors said the children were on a
two-week visit with the mother that was part of the custody
agreement.
   The names of the family members were not made public.
   Police were called to the middle-class Brooklyn neighborhood
Thursday morning by neighbors who said a mother was threatening to
kill her children at a condominium.
   When four officers arrived, they could hear the children
screaming, McConville said.
   As one officer stood by the door to the apartment, the others
went into the backyard, where they found an open ground floor
window and could see the 35-year-old woman with a 14-inch knife,
and the three children cowering on a couch.
   One officer tried to persuade the woman to put down the knife,
but she refused, telling him, ``Children are evil,'' McConville
said. The police said she also told the children, ``The devil is in
you. I have to kill you.''
   The woman came to the window, slashed at the blinds with the
knife, then returned to her children and began stabbing her
9-year-old daughter repeatedly, the police spokesman said.
   Officer Andrew Boyle fired two shots at the woman, but she
continued to stab her daughter. Boyle jumped through the open
window to grab the woman, and when she tried to stab him, he fired
two more rounds and the woman fell to the floor, the spokesman said.
   She had been shot at least once in the chest and was pronounced
dead at the scene.

<HEAD>Permission Granted to 1,556 `Refuseniks' to Leave Country</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet authorities granted permission to 1,556
people to leave the country this year but withheld exit visas from
299 others because they knew state secrets or had other problems,
an official said Thursday.
   Rudolf Kuznetsov, head of the visa office, said the Soviet Union
had pledged at a human rights conference Vienna six months ago to
review 1,850 applications for exit permits previously rejected by
authorities.
   ``In accordance with international documents, including the
Vienna document, and guided by our internal legislation, 299
persons were not accorded the permits owing to specific
circumstances,'' he said.
   Since the Vienna accords were signed, 1,325 exit permits have
been issued for Soviets to leave the country temporarily and 231
permanently.
   Most of the rejected applicants were turned down because they
possess information considered to be state secrets, he said. Other
problems included ``persons who cannot settle relations with their
parents or former spouses.''
   Yuri Kashlev, the Soviet ambassador to the Vienna human rights
conference, said, ``Before Jan. 19, we had 1,855 refuseniks. We
pledged there to review their cases within six months.''
   He said there were only about 300 ``refuseniks'' remaining in
the Soviet Union, most of them in possession of state secrets. The
others have already gone abroad, he said.
   Kashlev said the Soviet record of permitting emigration and just
ordinary travel had greatly improved over the years before 1987.
Last year, 108,000 people were given exit permits and another
91,000 permits were issued in the first six months of this year, he
said.
   But problems have arisen with Soviets' plans to enter other
countries.
   ``We warn all Soviet citizens who are going to reside abroad not
to sell their goods, not to quit their jobs or sell their
apartments until they get entry visas to other countries,
particularly the United States,'' Kashlev said.
   He said 28,000 people with valid Soviet exit permits were
waiting for the U.S. Embassy to issue them visas, forming long
lines daily in front of the consular offices.
   ``It is the only long line we are not responsible for,'' Kashlev
quipped, referring to the long lines outside many Soviet stores.
   In a recent interview, a U.S. official said the proposed
liberalization of Soviet emigration laws has nearly quadrupled the
number of Soviets seeking to settle in the United States.
   Max Robinson, consul-general at the U.S. Embassy, said about
33,000 Soviets went to the United States last year. This year, he
said, Soviets are registering their intent to emigrate at an annual
rate of 120,000 and that could reach a quarter of a million by 1990.
   ``The United States has a policy of giving all Soviets who seek
to emigrate to the United States the chance to do so,'' Robinson
said.
   The Supreme Soviet parliament is debating legislation that would
loosen restrictions on Soviets traveling abroad to visit or to live.
   ``I think that once the new emigration law comes into effect and
a pattern is established, it could double next year and come
awfully close to a quarter million,'' Robinson said.

   Here are lists of cities that fail to meet
federal requirements for ozone and carbon monoxide.
   While areas are grouped under provisions of President Bush's
clean air proposal, Congress could choose a different system if it
passes new legislation. Also, Congress could choose to accept the
Bush bill but push back the deadlines, which assume final passage
by Jan. 1.
   The moderate and marginal areas for ozone have the same
deadlines but would differ in the measures required for cleanup.

   Despite large economic gains black Americans
have made over the last 50 years, their progress has stagnated or
worsened relative to whites since the early 1970s, a report
concluded Thursday.
   The National Research Council report said blacks have been hurt
by a slowdown in the U.S. economy during the last two decades and
by persistent racial inequalities in education, housing and other
aspects of American society.
   ``A legacy of discrimination and segregation continues to affect
black-white relations,'' said study director Gerald Jaynes, a Yale
University professor of economics and African-American studies.
   The $2.7 million study, entitled ``A Common Destiny: Blacks in
American Society,'' was financed by several foundations and
charitable organizations for the National Research Council, the
principle operating agency of the National Academies of Sciences
and Engineering, a congressionally chartered, private non-profit
organization.
   Begun in 1985, the study is based on data and research analyses
assessing the position of blacks in American society since the eve
of World War II. The 22-member study committee included experts in
a range of academic specialties.
   Jaynes said the study committee found that ``by any calibration
other than that of an unrepentant segregationist, race relations
and blacks' status are remarkably improved since the World War II
era.''
   However, ``the status of blacks relative to whites has stagnated
or regressed since the early 1970s,'' he said.
   The report said blacks' status was improved by a rapidly growing
U.S. economy in the three decades following the war, which boosted
the standard of living for all Americans.
   Blacks also have benefitted from the civil rights movement and
from a social activism that have bolstered equal opportunity
efforts, the report said.
   However, the slowdown of the U.S. economy in the early 1970s has
hurt the earnings of Americans generally, and particularly those
with the least skills and lowest incomes.
   Although blacks' earnings have risen relative to whites during
the last 15 years, this gain is partially offset by reduced
employment rates for blacks, the report said.
   During this period, the proportion of black families with
incomes of more than $35,000 annually increased from 16 percent in
1970 to 21 percent in 1986. At the same time, the segment with
incomes below $10,000 grew from 27 percent to 30 percent.
   The gap between the races in terms of poverty has been about the
same since 1939 _ black poverty rates are about two to three times
white poverty rates.
   Mean earnings for blacks and whites improved steadily from 1939
through 1969 and then slightly through the 1970s before dropping in
the 1980s. However, blacks also improved their earnings in relation
to whites, making about 42 percent of per capita white earnings in
1939 but 56 percent by 1984. During this period, black women all
but closed the gap, rising from 56 percent of per capita white
female earnings to 96 percent in 1984.
   The report said attitudes toward work and the desire to succeed
are about the same among the poor and the better off.
   Residential and educational segregation continues to hold blacks
back, the report said.
   Housing segregation that has concentrated blacks in major urban
areas has not changed much since 1960 and, in 1980, nearly
two-thirds of black students in public elementary and secondary
schools attended schools where more than half the students were
members of minorities, the report found.
   Blacks also face a large gap in mortality and morbidity relative
to whites. Infant deaths are twice as high for blacks as for
whites, and 22 percent of blacks, compared with 14 percent of
whites, don't have health insurance and aren't covered by Medicaid.

   The elusive imposter who posed as an
astronaut, military officer and pro baseball player before his
arrest on fraud charges and his announced run for mayor has skipped
out on warrants in two states, police said.
   State police said Wednesday they believe Robert J. Hunt may be
in New York City, where he reportedly appeared on a radio talk show
last week.
   Hunt, 27, apparently fled as arrest warrants were issued in
Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
   Three weeks ago, a man who identified himself as a campaign
worker for Hunt called The Associated Press and outlined Hunt's
latest campaign ploy. After having heard that Mayor George Colella
had arranged for pizzas to be delivered to some elderly residents,
the caller said Hunt planned to deliver pizza to the mayor himself.
   ``I will be the next mayor of Revere,'' Hunt said last month
after announcing he would run. ``I am honest. I think the people
are saying that if this guy can do what he did, maybe he can do
something for this community.''
   ``People like me,'' Hunt said. ``I know how to talk to people.
I'll make a great politician.''
   Hunt was surprisingly effective in what he called his
``impersonations.'' While posing as an astronaut, Hunt sipped tea
with the Lord Mayor of Dublin, signed autographs and lectured at an
aviation club called the Experimental Aviation Club.
   ``He was a very good speaker, he entertained us. He held us
spellbound for 2{ hours,'' the Greater Boston chapter president,
Lou Pascucci, said after Hunt's arrest early this year.
   The son of a plumber from Everett, Hunt at one point scorched
some kitchen tiles and told his wife at the time that they fell off
the ill-fated Challenger shuttle. In June, Hunt said he was in the
process of divorcing his fourth wife.
   ``He will show up somewhere else with a scam,'' said State
Police Detective Andrew Palombo, who arrested Hunt last
January.``He is incapable of doing anything that is not bizarre,
and he is not going to get a 9-to-5 job.''
   Hunt was convicted in May of fraudulent use of a credit card in
renting a private jet airplane and of swindling a Saugus family out
of $4,000.
   He was ordered to make regular restitution payments to his
victims as part of his probation in East Boston and Lynn district
courts.
   Court officials and Palumbo said payments were not made, and the
two courts issued arrest warrants.
   He also failed to appear for a July 12 hearing in New Hampshire
at which Rockingham County Attorney Brian Graf planned to ask a
judge to impose a three-year suspended sentence Hunt got in 1986
for issuing bad checks.
   A warrant for his arrest was issued there after he failed to
appear.
   Palombo went to the elder Hunts' home in Revere to arrest Hunt
July 12 and found that he had left.
   Hunt's father, Leo Hunt, said his son had left his clothes, and
he thought he was staying with friends in New York's Greenwich
Village.

   U.S. drug agents in Peru, frustrated by
heavily armed guerrillas in the world's foremost cocaine-producing
region, needlessly risked their lives last month to capture a
guerrilla flag in a jungle clearing, the State Department's chief
watchdog said Thursday.
   ``It was an outrageous use of a government chopper, and they put
themselves in harm's way unnecessarily,'' department inspector
general Sherman Funk said after he disclosed the incident at a
Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee hearing.
   The June 13 incident illustrated the difficulty agents face in
trying to run eradication programs in the Upper Huallaga Valley,
which is essentially controlled by the ruthless Sendero Luminoso,
or Shining Path, guerrillas.
   Guerrilla activity, including frequent firefights with
government police and military, has forced U.S. officials to close
down their eradication efforts until a fortified base can be
completed at Santa Lucia. That base may be ready for use as early
as next month.
   But Drug Enforcement Administration agents, apparently angry at
being stymied by the guerrillas, swooped down onto an island in the
Huallaga River to seize a Sendero Luminoso flag after first
riddling the ground with gunfire, Funk said. The incident was not
the first of its kind, he added.
   The incident involved two U.S. government helicopters. If there
were guerrillas present, they did not return fire and were not seen
by the agents, Funk said, adding that the U.S. Ambassador in Lima,
Alexander F. Watson, ``blew his top'' when he heard about it.
   Five of the people involved, including DEA agents and private
pilots working under contract for the government, have either been
disciplined or ordered out of the country, he said.
   ``It is one of those unfortunate things,'' said Melvyn Levitsky,
assistan secretary of state for international narcotics matters,
who acknowledged management and coordination problems in the
programs.
   But Levitsky and other top anti-drug officials defended their
efforts, although imperfect, as the only alternative to a total
surrender to drug producers.
   David Westrate, assistant DEA administrator for operations, said
he still believed the government ultimately can cut by half the
flow of cocaine from South America to the United States. Nearly all
production comes from Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley and the Chapare
province of Bolivia, he noted.
   Authorities should be able to gain increasing control of air,
land and water routes out of those areas and cut the flow of coca
leaf and paste to Colombia, where it is refined, packaged and
shipped, he said.
   ``We can't solve this at home, alone,'' Westrate said. ``We have
an opportunity to make a dramatic difference, and we have to pursue
that.''
   He acknowledged there is inefficiency in current efforts to
manually dig up coca plants and use jungle raids to destroy crude
processing laboratories, and noted there will be increasing danger
of violence to those involved as pressure on producers mounts.
   ``We cannot wait for a perfect solution,'' he said, noting that
delay only serves to allow more money, weapons and equipment to
flow to drug producers and groups like the Shining Path guerrillas.
   Funk said a recent trip by his investigators to both countries
showed there had been improvements in DEA training and that more
agents now are able to speak Spanish. Aircraft maintenance and
equipment also had been improved, he said.
   But other problems turned up in an inspection trip a year ago
remained, including lack of any emergency evacuation plan for
American personnel working in the Upper Huallaga Valley and feeble
eradication efforts.
   ``Coca production in these countries has increased every year
and less than one percent of the illicit drugs have been seized,''
Funk testified. He said it remains uncertain whether the programs,
which have cost more than $100 million since 1972, will have any
meaningful impact on cocaine exports.

   U.S. soybean supplies are expected to recover
this season from the effects of the 1988 drought, the Agriculture
Department said Thursday.
   The department's Economic Research Service said the assessment
was based on the July 12 estimate of 61.3 million acres planted to
soybeans this year and a projected harvest of 1.95 billion bushels,
up 27 percent from 1988 output.
   Agency analysts said that the soybean crush in 1989-90 could
climb to 1.115 billion bushels from 1.07 expected for 1988-89.
Soybeans are crushed by processors into high-protein meal for
livestock feed and oil for cooking and other food use.
   ``Exports, too, should rise next year, but at a forecast 600
million bushels will lag the larger volumes of the early 1980s,''
the report said.
   By the end of the next marketing year on Aug. 31, 1990, soybean
inventories are expected to be about 265 million bushels, up from
125 million bushels at the beginning of the season this Sept. 1.
   As a result of the larger crop this year, soybean market prices
are expected to decline to an average of $4.75 to $6.25 per bushel
in 1989-90 from an estimated $7.35 this season.

<HEAD>Three Sentenced to Death for Burma Bombing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A military tribunal on Thursday sentenced
three opposition figures to death for a fatal bombing this month,
and diplomats spoke of a wave of arrests, possibly of hundreds of
activists.
   The mail bomb exploded July 7 at the government's Syriam oil
refinery just north of Rangoon, killing the two people and wounding
a third, official reports have said.
   Those sentenced to die were identified as Than Zaw, 27; Moe Kyaw
Thus, 27; and Nyi Nyi Oo, 25. No date was given for the executions.
   The three were arrested July 17. All belong to the National
League for Democracy.
   It was the first verdict issued by a military court formed under
new martial law regulations announced last week.
   Brig. Gen. Khin Nyunt, the government's intelligence chief, told
reporters the three had confessed to planting the bomb.
   Burmese authorities were also seeking Moe Thiha, an organizer
for the National League for Democracy and the suspected mastermind
of the bombing.
   The National League is the largest and most popular opposition
group to emerge from a national uprising for democracy.
   Millions of people protested nationwide last year to demand an
end to a quarter century of military control of the government.
   However, military commander Gen. Saw Maung seized power in
September, and his troops crushed dissent by killing hundreds of
people.
   The two leaders of the National League, Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin
Oo, have been under house arrest since July 20. They were arrested
a day after new pro-democracy protests in Rangoon.
   Authorities accuse them of attempting to ``destroy the military
and revive anarchy in the country.''
   Before she was detained, Ms. Suu Kyi, who has always encouraged
peaceful protest, said she had seen no evidence the three accused
group members were responsible for the bombing.
   She suggested the confessions may have been made under duress.
   No details of the trial were made public.
   Sources in Rangoon said that since Ms. Suu Kyi and Tin Oo were
arrested, the military has arrested hundreds of their supporters.
   ``There is absolutely no doubt that there is a large scale wave
of arrests going on right now,'' a diplomat in Rangoon said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We are getting this from a
variety of different sources and they are all pretty reliable.''
   ``They are going to people's houses at night, they are pulling
them off the streets, even off of buses or out of offices and
hotels,'' he said.
   A member of the National League, contacted earlier in the day by
telephone from Bangkok, said hundreds of pro-democracy activists
had been arrested recently.
   ``The figure may be around a few hundred for the whole
country,'' the source said. ``In Rangoon, some say between 160 and
200 have been arrested, and it is not only confined to the
(National League).'' he said on condition of anonymity.
   Another bomb killed three people when it exploded July 10 in
Rangoon's City Hall, a key administrative building that is heavily
defended by troops, official reports said.
   Authorities have also blamed that bombing on the National
League, and they say the attackers are at large.

<TEXT>
   One of the world's most lavish annual
cultural festivals began Thursday without conductor Herbert von
Karajan, the titan of music who dominated it for more than three
decades.
   Karajan, a native of Salzburg, died July 16 at age 81. He had
conducted at the Salzburg Festival since 1948 and was its sole
artistic director in 1956-60.
   A member of the directorate since 1964, Karajan resigned from
that body last year but continued to wield influence on the
festival.
   In opening the festival, President Kurt Waldheim invoked the
memory of the maestro.
   ``The man Herbert von Karajan is missing but his musical work
will survive,'' Waldheim said. He spoke at the Salzburg
Festspielhaus, partially draped in a black flag in mourning.
   As part of a memorial to Karajan, there was a nationally
televised, star-studded performance of Mozart's ``Requiem'' at
Salzburg cathedral Sunday.
   Karajan was to have conducted the Vienna Philharmonic this year
in six performances of the Verdi opera ``Un Ballo in Maschera''
(``Masked Ball'') for the opening night performance, with tenor
Placido Domingo in the starring role. He also had planned to
conduct Bruckner's Eighth Symphony Aug 18.
   After his death, Sir Georg Solti, musical director of the
Chicago Symphony Orchestra, was picked to conduct the Verdi piece.
The August concert will be conducted by Carlo Maria Giulini and has
been expanded to include Brahms' Third and Fourth symphonies.
   The cultural fete traditionally offers one of the richest
programs of music and drama to those who can find tickets. But many
seeking entry to the banner events are disappointed.
   Approximately 190,000 seats were available this year, but tens
of thousands of ticket requests had to be turned away for opera and
orchestral music performances and recital concerts with stars Jose
Carreras, Jessye Norman and Agnes Baltsa, organizers said.
   This year, the festival includes six operas, three plays, 18
orchestral concerts, five Mozart matinees, nine lieder recitals, 12
chamber concerts and five ballet performances with the Martha
Graham Dance Company of New York.
   The concert program will also include performances of sacred
music in the University Church for 137 events before the Aug. 31
closing.
   Norman, whose Wagner concert with Karajan at Salzburg in August
1987 has now become a well-selling record, is to sing in two
orchestral concerts featuring the works of Mahler and a lieder
recital of songs by Ravel, Richard Strauss and de Falla.
   The American soprano is also scheduled to appear in a gala
concert ``Mozart in Salzburg'' on July 30, conducted by James
Levine, musical director of the New York's Metropolitan Opera.
   Other principals were the Spanish tenor Carreras, with two
recitals and Baltsa, the Greek mezzosoprano, who will perform in
Verdi's ``Requiem'' conducted by Riccardo Muti.
   Further operatic highlights were Puccini's ``Tosca,'' Mozart's
``The Abduction from the Seraglio,'' and Rossini's ``La
Cenerentola,'' all with the Vienna Philharmonic.
   The theatrical standout, as usual, is ``Everyman,'' Hugo von
Hofmannsthal's morality play about the death of a rich man, played
in front of the city's ancient cathedral.
   Events are being staged amid a continuing controversy about
costs and prices.
   The government auditor years ago urged festival organizers to
spend less. Now in its 69th year, Salzburg pays some of the highest
performer fees in Europe and charges some of the world's top ticket
prices.
   The total budget was unavailable, but state subsidies last year
totaled $7.7 million, said Hans Landsmann, a member of the festival
board.
   Admission prices range from $4 for standing room at a concert of
sacred music to $250 for the best seat at one of the opera
performances. In comparison, the highest ticket price at the annual
Wagner festival in Bayreuth, West Germany, is $115.

   Left-wing author Margaret Randall remained a
U.S. citizen even though she became a citizen of Mexico 22 years
ago to find work there and spent 15 years in Cuba and Nicaragua, an
immigration appeals board ruled Thursday in blocking an effort to
deport her.
   By 3-2, the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals said that Randall,
52, became a Mexican citizen in 1967 under economic duress and that
the Immigration and Naturalization Service should not have
considered her politics.
   ``To tell you the truth, I'm still a little numb,'' Randall said
from her home in Albuquerque, N.M., where her parents live.
   ``However objectionable the respondent's (Randall's) opinions
and past acts may be, these are not matters that can color the
factual assessment of the voluntariness of her expatriating act,''
the panel wrote.
   ``We find that the respondent has established by a preponderance
of the evidence that economic reasons led her to acquire Mexican
citizenship and that these economic reasons rose to the level of
duress sufficient to negate her free choice,'' the panel wrote.
   INS claimed that Randall gave up her U.S. citizenship as a
political protest and wanted Mexican citizenship in order to get a
passport to Cuba. It also claimed that as the wife of a Mexican
citizen, she could have found work.
   Randall claimed her husband ceased providing for the three
children, one of whom was ill, she was led to believe work laws in
Mexico forced her to be a citizen before she would find a job, and
many Americans went to Cuba with U.S. passports despite a travel
ban.
   Justice Department attorneys are reviewing the decision, said
spokesman Dan Eramian. The appeals board operates independently of
the INS but under the auspices of the Justice Department, of which
the INS is a part.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh will have the final word on the
case. INS cannot appeal it to another court.
   INS spokesman Vern Jervis said the office had not seen the
ruling and could not comment directly. But he did say that in the
case that prompted the appeal, Randall was applying for permanent
residency as an alien and the political standards were those used
for an alien.
   ``All these other questions become non-questions at this
point,'' he said. ``You can't keep a citizen out of the country,
and you can't remove a citizen from the country.''
   Said Randall: ``I'd like to get on with my life. It's not as if
I stopped my life _ I've made a tremendous effort during the last
4{ years to keep teaching, keep writing, keep seeing my children,
keep doing photography.
   ``But of course living with a case like this implies an enormous
amount of daily stress because you're constantly involved with
press work, hearings, and the uncertainty of wondering is you can
stay in the country.''
   Washington-based immigration attorney Michael Maggio said
Randall wants to apply for a passport in order to be able to visit
her three grandchildren, who live in France and Mexico.
   ``Hopefully this case signals a depolitization of the executive
branch in a new administration where there will be less
ideologically motivated legal actions by the Justice Department and
INS, so that cases can be decided how they're supposed to be _ by
the facts of the law,'' he said.
   Randall was also represented by lawyers from the New York-based
Center for Constitutional Rights, a private civil liberties group.
   ``I think it (the ruling) affirms that U.S. citizenship is a
constitutional right and that one cannot lose one's citizenship
because the government doesn't like what you say in your criticisms
of policies,'' said David Cole, a center attorney who helped
represent Randall.
   In his dissent, board member Fred W. Vacca accused Randall of
being a ``propagandist and apologist'' for the Cuban and Sandinista
governments. He also said it was ``repugnant'' that Randall
publicly accepted a finger ring made from the wreckage of a downed
U.S. military aircraft when she traveled to North Vietnam in 1974.
   Randall had returned to the United States in 1984, and her
deportation hearings began in 1986. During that time she has held a
number of teaching positions at universities.
   In June, the Supreme Court refused her appeal because it was
premature and untimely.
   Randall, whose case has been followed by a number of authors,
including Toni Morrison, Kurt Vonnegut and William Styron, has
written extensively about social change and revolution in Third
World countries.

   A coalition of AIDS activists, saying the
disease is becoming a leading cause of premature death in the
United States, Thursday urged government leaders to reject the
``complacency'' that is hampering the fight against the epidemic.
   The groups called for federal anti-discrimination protection for
people with AIDS, more aggressive health-care planning and more
money for research and early intervention efforts with
life-prolonging therapies.
   ``We decry the complacency that has been developing in this
nation in the face of an epidemic that is clearly an ongoing crisis
and clearly being ignored,'' said Jean McGuire, executive director
of the AIDS Action Council and chairwoman of the National
Organizations Responding to AIDS.
   She called on the federal government ``to exert the leadership
that has been missing so far'' in the epidemic, which began in the
early part of the decade.
   ``The greatest threat we face may not be from the virus itself
but the complacency we see around us,'' she said.
   The groups called the news conference to mark the spread of the
epidemic to its 100,000th case.
   No one knows when the reported cases reached this level, but the
Centers for Disease Control said it happened sometime in recent
weeks.
   As of June 30, 1989, AIDS had been diagnosed in 99,936
Americans, of whom more than half, or 58,014, have died since June
1, 1981, according to the CDC. No one is known to have recovered.
   The growing number of cases is expected to make AIDS one of the
leading causes of premature death in the United States by 1992,
according to the Human Rights Campaign Fund.
   Using a measure called ``years of potential life lost (YPLL),''
the group projects 65,000 AIDS deaths in 1992 will result in 1.7
million YPLL, third behind accidents and cancer. The measure is
based on the difference between a person's age at death and a life
expectancy of 65 years.
   While it took eight years for 100,000 AIDS cases to develop,
that number is expected to double over the next 15 months and could
quadruple by the end of 1991, McGuire said.
   The federal government is spending about $1.3 billion this year
on AIDS research, prevention and education. President Bush proposed
to spend $1.6 billion in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, but
the groups said more is needed.
   Among the indications of government retrenchment the groups
cited was a House Appropriations Committee decision earlier this
week to direct public health officials to cancel a proposed survey
of Americans' sexual behaviors. The Public Health Service said the
purpose of the survey was to better understand the spread of the
disease.
   The groups also cited the committee's decision to stop
earmarking money specifically for AIDS research in the National
Institutes of Health budget.
   ``This is trying to restore AIDS to business as usual,'' said
Jeff Levi, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task
Force.

<HEAD>Zhao Ziyang: Scapegoat for National Woes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national campaign to rally support for the
military crackdown on pro-democracy protests has accused party
veteran Zhao Ziyang of being the chief culprit lurking behind most
of China's woes.
   When the Communist Party Central Committee ousted Zhao as
general secretary on June 24, it accused him of splitting the party
and supporting student-led demonstrations crushed by soldiers in
early June.
   Since then, he has been blamed for everything from the nation's
economic woes to rampant corruption, pornography, bad literature
and lower productivity.
   Zhao first came under direct criticism by other party leaders
last year for problems arising from China's economic reforms.
   Having spearheaded market-oriented reforms initiated by senior
leader Deng Xiaoping, he was held responsible when decentralization
of the economy contributed to runaway inflation and panic-buying.
   Recent media commentaries repeat those criticisms and add a slew
of new accusations.
   Government spokesman Yuan Mu told reporters that because Zhao
allegedly neglected to promote communist ideological education, he
also should be blamed for endemic corruption.
   ``Zhao Ziyang once openly stated that corruption is inevitable
in the primary stages of a commercial economy,'' Yuan said.
   The national trade federation chief, Ni Zhifu, said workers'
enthusiasm, and implicitly their productivity, is low because
``some persons'' advocated blunting their leading role. The phrase
``some persons,'' increasingly common in editorials and speeches,
is understood to refer to Zhao.
   ``Zhao Ziyang for a long time has not spoken about relying on
the leadership of the working class,'' complained legislator Wang
Houde, who claimed Zhao is elitist and stressed people with ability
over ordinary workers.
   A group of writers and artists blame him for pornography.
   ``Comrade Zhao Ziyang ... certainly didn't firmly grasp party
ideology ... so that all sorts of garbage appeared in our
society,'' Gu Zuogang of the China Dance Association said at a
forum organized by the party Propaganda Department.
   Zhang Jiong, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, told the meeting that under Zhao, ``there was no
distinction between right and wrong'' and ``sex and violence filled
the literary market.''
   Others contend Zhao was too tolerant of Western liberal
thinking. ``The recent rebellion was a result of ... Zhao Ziyang
not supporting the fight against bourgeois liberalization from the
beginning,'' the People's Daily party newspaper said Wednesday.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said in a commentary: ``Now, if
we do not earnestly oppose bourgeois liberalism, our party and
country will certainly be in danger of perishing.''
   Even moderate party leaders like Hu Qili and Yen Mingfu, who
were linked with Zhao in allegedly supporting the protests,
``placed all the blame on Zhao'' when confronted with their errors,
Hong Kong's Ming Pao newspaper reported.
   It's not the first time Chinese leaders have sought a scapegoat
for sticky political and economic problems. After the ultra-leftist
Gang of Four were ousted in 1976, ending the tumultuous decade-long
Cultural Revolution, it became common practice to blame them for
all China's woes, including its economic backwardness.
   The Gang of Four, including Jiang Qing, widow of revolutionary
leader Mao Tse-tung, eventually were tried publicly for treason.
They remain in jail.
   So far, Zhao has escaped that fate. He has been stripped of all
party posts but retains party membership and has been accused only
of mistakes the party can deal with internally. However, officials
say their investigation continues.
   Another casualty is Luo Zhengqi, who has been fired as president
of Shenzhen University and the area's party chief.
   Authorities in Shenzhen, one of China's most reform-minded
cities, said Thursday they fired Luo for making serious unspecified
mistakes during the protests, suggesting he was judged too
sympathetic to the students.
   Earlier this week, authorities in central Anhui province fired
the deputy education commissioner for allegedly encouraging
protests.
   They ended when soldiers attacked unarmed demonstrators June 3-4
in Beijing and killed hundreds and perhaps thousands. China says
only 100 civilians and nearly 100 soldiers and police were slain.
   Zhao has not appeared in public since May 18, when he tearfully
appealed to students in Tiananmen Square to stop protesting.
Unofficial reports say variously that he is under house arrest or
in the hospital.
   Although Zhao was not popular, he represented a new style of
Chinese leader, suave, articulate and at ease with leaders of both
the socialist and Western worlds.
   Now, his immaculately tailored Western suits and golf-playing
have become political liabilities.

<HEAD>Britain Ponders Whether to Extradite Soering</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DOBBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jens Soering is in a London jail and Britain has a
dilemma: send him to Virginia, where he could face execution if
convicted of murder, or violate its extradition treaty by honoring
a European Court order not to do so.
   Soering, whose father is the West German consul in Detroit, is
accused of helping his American girlfriend, Elizabeth Haysom, kill
her wealthy parents in March 1985 in Lynchburg, Va. A Bedford
County grand jury indicted them on murder charges after they fled
to London.
   Miss Haysom, now 24, returned home in May 1987 without fighting
extradition, admitted being an accessory and was sentenced to 90
years in prison.
   Authorities say Soering, 22, has admitted participating in the
killings but has given differing accounts of the circumstances. He
has been in a south London jail for three years while fighting
extradition to the United States.
   On July 7, the European Court of Human Rights decided Soering
must not be extradited because, if convicted, he might spend years
on Death Row awaiting execution. That would violate his human
rights, it said.
   The court is a branch of the 23-nation Council of Europe, to
which Britain belongs, and its decisions are not binding but rarely
are ignored. If Britain abides by the ruling, it will violate its
1972 extradition treaty with the United States.
   ``Our practice is to abide by the rulings of the European
Court,'' said an official of the Home Office, which has indicated
an announcement was possible as early as Friday. His statement
appeared to be a hint against extradition.
   Lawyers say Soering probably will be returned to West Germany,
which also has sought his extradition and is willing to try him.
German law allows trials for crimes committed in other countries.
   Louis Blom-Cooper, a leading British lawyer, said the case
illustrates the difference between Western Europe, where capital
punishment is effectively outlawed, and the United States, where
Virginia and 35 other states have capital punishment.
   The court ruling, rather than citing the death penalty, deplored
the ``Death Row phenomenon'' by which convicts spent an average of
six to eight years awaiting execution while their cases go through
lengthy appeals process.
   ``It's all very well for them (U.S. authorities) to beat their
breasts, but we live in a civilized world that does not impose
Death Row,'' Blom-Cooper said.
   Bedford County prosecutor James W. Updike Jr. said the European
Court ``is essentially stating that the Constitution of the United
States and the system of justice we have in this country violates
human rights. I can't accept that.''
   ``I do not know of any country ... that provides any better
protection for human rights,'' he said in a British Broadcasting
Corp. television program broadcast Sunday.
   Britain ordered Soering extradited in August 1988, but then the
European Court accepted his case. It ruled that what might await
him in the United States violated his rights under the European
human rights convention, which forbids ``inhuman or degrading
treatment or punishment.''
   Lawyers say the ruling means European countries will have to
consider the treatment suspects could face when sent to another
country.
   Britain routinely asks the U.S. federal government in capital
cases for assurances that the suspect will not be executed if
convicted.
   ``The federal authorities can't give a cast-iron guarantee on
behalf of the state authorities,'' said Pam Teare, a Home Office
spokeswoman. ``What is agreed is that the state authorities will be
informed of the very strict recommendation of the British
government that the death penalty should not be imposed.''
   In 1984, Britain ignored a pending plea before the European
Court and extradited an American, Ernest Kirkwood, who was charged
with killing two men in San Francisco. Another American, Scott
Errico, charged in Florida with three contract killings, was sent
home for trial in 1987.
   The Home Office said both were convicted of lesser charges and
escaped the death penalty.

<HEAD>Canadians Chase U.S. Scalloper for Illegal Fishing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fishing vessel that rammed a Canadian patrol
boat that had tried to stop it for allegedly poaching in Canadian
water was boarded by the Coast Guard when it reached port Thursday.
   The Bountiful, from New Beford, was allegedly seven nautical
miles into Canadian water, about 165 miles east of Nantucket, when
it was spotted Wednesday by the patrol boat.
   By escaping to American water, it probably dodged severe
Canadian penalties but may still face action under U.S. law.
   The skipper of the Bountiful, David Saunders, denied he was
fishing in Canadian territory and said the patrol boat rammed him
after threatening to fire.
   ``They deliberately ran me down,'' he said.
   ``They told me to get everybody off the deck because they were
going to open fire,'' said Saunders. ``I said we're an unarmed
vessel. There's 10 unarmed guys here, you can't shoot me.''
   Asked why he refused to stop for the Canadians, Saunders said
``Would you stop if someone was stopping you with a .50-caliber?
I'm not stopping.''
   It was the sixth incident in a year-long boundary dispute
between American fishermen and Canadian patrols.
   ``It's really inconceivable that two countries as close as ours,
politically, geographically ... can't resolve matters as relatively
uncomplicated as this,'' said Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., a senior
member of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee.
   The chase lasted 140 miles and about 18 hours.
   The Canadian patrol boat Cygnus chased the Bountiful into the
200-mile U.S. exclusive economic zone where it was rammed by the
fishing boat, said Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Jack Mason. No
injuries or serious damage were reported.
   The Canadian government denied the Cygnus crew permission to
fire warning shots across the Bountiful's bow after it was rammed.
   The Bountiful was boarded by the Coast Guard when it docked
Thursday, and National Marine Fisheries officials took stock of the
catch.
   Ken Crossman, special NMFS agent for the Northeast, said his
investigators would share information with Canadian officials, who
could prepare an arrest warrant only executable in Canada.
   If the Canadians provide sufficient documentation to prove the
Bountiful was illegally fishing, ``then separately, through U.S.
prosecution channels, the boat is subject to prosecution'' under
U.S. law, Crossman said.
   Under federal law, the boat's captain could face a maximum
penalty of a $10,000 fine and a year in jail for transporting an
illegal catch.
   ``That may shed a little light for you on why it's so important
to these fishermen to not be caught by the Canadians where they
face several hundred thousand dollars (in fines) under Canadian
law, as well as physical arrest and detention of the boat,''
Crossman said.
   Incidents along the so-called Hague fisheries line _ the line
set by the International Court of Justice in the Hague,
Netherlands, in 1984 to separate U.S. and Canadian marine zones _
are on the rise because fishing stocks on the U.S. side are being
depleted and the Canadians are aggressively patrolling their area.
   A New Bedford boat was recently pursued by the Canadians for 14
hours. Last year, Canadian patrols fired on another New Bedford
scalloper, the Donna Lynn, after its captain refused to let
officials board, claiming the boat was in U.S. water.
   Canadian officials maintain the American fisherman are
intentionally crossing the boundary. But Studds has said that the
crossings are simply mistakes.
   According to a Studds aide, Jeff Pike, five of the six
navigational charts issued to American fisherman by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration contain U.S.-Canadian border
errors of up to four miles.

   The war against foliage-eating gypsy moths
made a gain in Oregon but then fluttered into retreat in North
Carolina and Utah, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said Oregon has been removed from
the gypsy moth quarantine list because the pest has been eradicated
from Lane County, which had been the insect's toehold in the state.
   Federal quarantine regulations restrict the interstate movement
of outdoor household articles _ lawn furniture and certain camping
equipment, for example _ that might harbor moths and spread them to
other states.
   ``Based on treatments and subsequent surveys, we have determined
that (the) gypsy moth no longer occurs in Lane County and that
there is no further need to restrict the movement of outdoor
household articles from this area.''
   Lane County was the only quarantined area in Oregon, so the
state has been removed from USDA's official list of gypsy moth
states.
   Meanwhile, Glosser's agency is designating all or portions of
Currituck and Dare counties in North Carolina as gypsy moth
``low-risk'' areas, thus adding North Carolina to the list.
   Glosser said inspectors have found that the counties are
infested by the moths but that the number of egg masses per acre is
not high enough for those counties to be rated as ``high-risk''
areas.
   By agency reckoning, an area is high-risk when it has more than
50 masses of moth eggs per acre.
   Glosser said a portion of Salt Lake County, Utah, is a high-risk
area and that this adds the state to the moth list.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party daily on
Thursday rejected calls by members of Poland's Solidarity movement
to reassess Czechoslovakia's 1968 reforms, crushed by a Warsaw Pact
invasion.
   In a related development, a leading activist reported police
searches of six dissident homes.
   The search appeared to be focused against Obroda, a new group of
reform communists, and police seemed to be looking for a petition
demanding democratic reforms that has gathered more than 11,500
signatures, said activist Petr Uhl.
   One of the residences searched was that of Jan Urban, who
accompanied a visiting Solidarity delegation last week, Uhl said in
a telephone call to the Vienna bureau of The Associated Press.
   After their visit, five Solidarity members urged the Communists
to review the ``Prague Spring'' political and economic reforms and
embrace similar changes now.
   While in Czechoslovakia, the Solidarity activists met with
leading dissidents and with Alexander Dubcek.
   After nearly two decades of silence, Dubcek, the former
Communist Party leader who engineered the reforms and who was
ousted after the invasion, has been increasingly critical of the
present leadership's rigidity.
   Czechoslovakia's current leaders were installed by the Kremlin
in the wake of the invasion. Their endorsement of Soviet economic
reforms has been lukewarm, and they have rejected any political
liberalization of the kind taking place in some other Soviet bloc
countries.
   Encouraged by the Soviet reforms, Hungary and Poland are moving
from strict communist rule to greater political plurality and are
increasing market forces in their economies. The editorial was
scornful of such change.
   The visiting Solidarity delegation was ``looking for ways to
`force' our country to adopt reforms of Polish style, to force our
country into an economic anarchy,'' the Rude Pravo newspaper said.
   ``Solidarity and its Czechoslovak advocates have set ... an aim
to re-evaluate the period of the end of the 1960s,'' the paper
said. ``However, we have no reason to re-evaluate these events.''
   The Solidarity activists, led by Adam Michnik, now a deputy in
the Polish parliament, said they wanted to join Czechoslovaks in
unofficial events to mark the 21st anniversary of the invasion Aug.
21.
   Rude Pravo said it was ``too soon'' for Solidarity ``to give us
advice, as they themselves have not acheived anything positive
yet.''
   ``The majority of the population of Czechoslovakia does not long
for disorders which Solidarity has caused in Poland, does not long
for economic chaos, empty stores and inflation,'' said Rude Pravo,
alluding to Poland's serious economic difficulties.

<HEAD>Atlantic City Mayor Arrested In Corruption Probe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor James L. Usry, a reformist
candidate swept into office on the heels of a political corruption
scandal, was arrested Thursday on charges of bribery, conspiracy
and official misconduct.
   Twelve other people, including the City Council president, the
chairman of the zoning board and the former housing authority
director, also were arrested after an investigation that one
official said showed this seaside resort was ``up for sale.''
   ``Our investigation uncovered the deplorable circumstances in
which corruption has reached the highest levels of Atlantic City
municipal government,'' state police Superintendent Col. Clinton L.
Pagano said at a news conference.
   Usry, 67, was elected mayor five years ago after his predecessor
was implicated in an influence-peddling scandal and lost a recall
election. Usry is also president of the National Conference of
Black Mayors.
   State Attorney General Peter Perretti Jr. said none of the
charges or investigations against Usry and the others involved the
casino industry.
   A criminal complaint against the suspects, including a 14th
person not yet arrested, alleged five separate but overlapping
conspiracies. Among them was an attempt to gain control of a
lucrative Boardwalk electric cart business and a gift shop
franchise at the Atlantic City International Airport.
   Usry was charged with bribery, conspiracy, official misconduct
and accepting unlawful gifts.
   The mayor said nothing in court during a bail hearing; neither
he nor his attorney acknowledged reporters' questions afterward.
Usry and the other city officials were released on their own
recognizance.
   Usry and others do not have to forfeit their public offices on
the basis of a criminal complaint, Perretti said. Attorneys from
the state Division of Criminal Justice are expected to present a
case to a state grand jury within several weeks.
   Before state police began their roundup Thursday morning, they
first went to Usry's home with a search warrant. Police confiscated
$6,000 in cash, alleged to be conspiracy money, Pagano said.
   Searches were also conducted at the home of another of those
arrested and at two offices belonging to others charged in the
case. Books, records and documents were confiscated from those
places, Pagano said.
   The arrests resulted from an investigation that began in
November, prompted by a complaint by Atlantic City businessman
Albert Black, the attorney general said. Black said some city
officials had demanded a bribe from him to get a business proposal
approved by the zoning board.
   The initial investigation involved bribery and influence
peddling by some members of the City Council and zoning board,
officials said. That probe led to investigations against the mayor
and others on similar charges.
   ``The complaints filed this morning in Atlantic County Superior
Court charge that the regulation of economic activity in Atlantic
City, as administered by those arrested, has been up for sale,''
Pagano said.
   The others arrested Thursday included Walter Collette, 61, city
council president; Kaleem Shabazz, 52, chairman of the Atlantic
City zoning board; Lillian Bryant, 45, Atlantic County freeholder;
Gene Dorn, 47, councilman; W. Oscar Harris Jr., 46, former director
of the Atlantic City Housing Authority; Harold Mosee, 47, former
Atlantic City councilman and an aide to Collette; and Arnold
Orsatti Jr., 46, chairman of the Atlantic City council's
transportation committee.
   Also charged were Robert McCurdy, 46, former business partner of
Harris; Jack Wolf, 57, business consultant; Sylvetta Pilgrim, 44,
administrative assistant with the city landlord-tenant affairs
board; Ernest English, 32, businessman; and Clarence Gillard, no
age or occupation available.
   Usry is in his second term as mayor. He won his first term on
May 13, 1984, the same day his predecessor, Michael Matthews, was
ousted. Matthews was implicated in an influence-peddling scheme
involving casino-zoned land and was sentenced to a 15-year prison
term for extortion.
   Usry was elected overwhelmingly with help from disgruntled white
voters and the city's large black population. He was considered an
ally of Gov. Thomas H. Kean and a symbol of the ``politics of
inclusion'' that Kean has tried to make a hallmark of his career as
a Republican politician.

<HEAD>DC Police Chief Joins GOP in White House Ceremony, May Run for Mayor</HEAD>

   District of Columbia Police Chief Maurice T.
Turner announced in a White House ceremony Thursday he was joining
the Republican Party, a move GOP strategists said was a prelude to
his running for mayor of the nation's capital.
   President Bush welcomed Turner, posing with him for Oval Office
pictures and declaring, ``This is a significant switch.''
   ``The man has been a lifelong Democrat, but he made a principled
decision based on what he feels is the best answer to helping solve
the problems of urban America. I think we share the same family
values,'' said Bush.
   Sources commenting only on condition of anonymity said the
police chief, who is retiring at the end of the month after 32
years on the force, had been approached by GOP officials with
promises of campaign support if he would make the race against
incumbent Democratic Mayor Marion Barry.
   Barry, whose administration has been plagued by scandal, has
indicated he intends to seek re-election. In addition, Jesse
Jackson, who contended unsuccessfully for the 1984 and 1988
Democratic presidential nominations, has said he plans to move soon
to the city and has not ruled out running.
   The city is overwhelmingly Democratic.
   Turner, 53, said, ``Right now I'm just becoming a member of the
Republican party. I'm not running for mayor at this time.''
   GOP sources said Turner was persuaded to join the Republican
party after strategists suggested he would have trouble raising
money or organizing a campaign staff in what promises to be a
crowded Democratic field.

<HEAD>Judge Sets Landano Free, Says Evidence Withheld</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Thursday reversed his own
decision and vacated the conviction of a man jailed 13 years ago
for killing a policeman, saying prosecutors covered up evidence.
   V. James Landano, sentenced to life in prison, has maintained he
was framed by motorcycle gang members protecting the real killer _
his childhood friend.
   Newly uncovered evidence from impounded investigative files
showed prosecutors withheld witness statements incriminating the
other man, and indicating Landano, 49, was not the killer, said
U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin.
   Two years ago, Sarokin denied Landano's first appeal to him on
technical grounds.
   ``We live in a nation in which liberty is cherished second only
to life itself,'' Sarokin wrote in Thursday's opinion.
   He said the prosecution showed a ``pattern of failures'' in
turning over exculpatory evidence.
   ``Oh God,'' were Landano's words when he heard the decision,
said defense attorney Neil M. Mullin.
   Mullin told Landano the news after Landano made a collect call
from East Jersey State Prison in Avenel to the federal courthouse
press room.
   ``It's taken me 13 years to have somebody see what was done to
me,'' he said in an interview. ``All I could think of was the names
and faces of the people who stood by me.
   ``It's been hell, but it's over. To sum it up in one word, I'm
going to live. I've existed for 13 years. Now I'm going to live.''
   Landano and three others, including his longtime friend Victor
Forni, were charged in the 1976 killing of a Newark police officer
at the robbery of a check-cashing establishment in Kearny. Landano
was convicted as the gunman. Forni was later convicted of planning
the crime for the Breed motorcycle gang and served nine months of a
two-year sentence.
   In unsuccessful appeals through the state system and up to the
U.S. Supreme Court, Landano denied he was at the scene and
contended he was framed by the Breed to protect Forni.
   At the courthouse, Landano's wife, Camille, trembling and
flushed, hugged Landano's joyful lawyers and supporters.
   Mullin said Landano probably would have been executed had there
been a New Jersey death penalty at the time of his conviction. The
state presently has the death penalty. A bail hearing has been set
for Monday morning in state court in Jersey City.
   The state will decide within the next several days whether to
appeal, said State Criminal Justice Director Robert Winter.
   Hudson County Prosecutor Paul DePascale declined to comment on
the ruling but said he expected the attorney general's office to
appeal. Thomas Mulcahy, the Hudson County assistant prosecutor who
tried the case and is now in private practice, denied witholding
evidence.
   The happy scene at federal court was in strong contrast to Sept.
30, 1987. That day, Sarokin said because a state court already had
ruled on an issue of fact that was in question, precedent did not
allow the federal justice to act, but he invited a higher court to
reverse him. He called his ruling ``a bitter exercise in judicial
restraint, since it may result in a gross injustice.''
   Landano did not give up. Princeton minister James McCloskey, who
investigates cases for indigent inmates claiming their innocence,
pitched in and found more evidence pointing to Landano's innocence.
   Sarokin ordered investigative files seized, and from them,
Landano's lawyers found the papers on which the judge based
Thursday's decision.
   One was a Kearny police interview report with a witness at a
warehouse near the crime scene, who picked out a photograph of
Forni as the getaway car driver. Another witness had said the
driver was the gunman. The report had never been given to Landano
and the identified picture never found.
   Sarokin also cited a handwritten document from Kearny police
files saying that the only eyewitness of the shooting had said of
Landano that his hair was not right _ the suspect had curly hair.
Notes on another witness said the same thing.

<TEXT>
   President Bush said Thursday he will appoint
Justin W. Dart Jr. as chairman of the President's Committee on
Employment of People with Disabilities.
   Dart, 58, who was disabled by polio as a teen-ager, is an
outspoken activist for the handicapped and former commissioner of
the Rehabilitation Services Administration in the Reagan
administration.
   He quit that post in December 1987 under orders from the White
House after complaining publicly about the government's ``obsolete,
paternalistic attitudes'' toward the disabled.
   During his 15-month stint at the Education Department's
rehabilitation agency, Dart quarreled with higher-ups over
management of the $1.5 billion program.
   Dart went public with his complaints in November 1987, telling a
congressional committee:
   ``We are confronted by a vast, inflexible federal system which,
like the society it represents, still contains a significant
proportion of individuals who have not yet overcome obsolete,
paternalistic attitudes about disability and, indeed, about
government itself.''
   Dart said in an interview Thursday, ``I will continue to work to
change those attitudes.''
   After quitting the rehabilitation post, Dart was appointed by
then-President Ronald Reagan to the National Council on the
Handicapped, which Dart will now resign from.
   He also chairs a Congressional Task Force on the Rights and
Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities that is winding up its
work.
   Dart founded and was chief executive of Japan Tupperware Inc.
His father, the late Justin Dart, was a California industrialist
and close friend of Ronald Reagan.
   Dart will succeed Harold Russell as chairman of the president's
committee.

   The New York Times Co. said Thursday it has
acquired McCall's magazine.
   Terms of the transaction were not disclosed but sources familiar
with the deal confirmed published reports that the price was about
$80 million.
   The magazine had been owned by Working Woman-McCall's Group, a
joint venture formed in 1986 by media investor Dale W. Lang and
Time Inc.
   The companies announced May 22 that they had reached an
agreement on the deal.
   William T. Kerr, president of the New York Times Co. Magazine
Group, said that in the nine weeks since the tentative agreement,
executives of the Times Company extensively reviewed McCall's
editorial and business operations.
   ``As we have continued to analyze McCall's and evaluate its
potential, we have become even more excited about the magazine's
editorial, advertising and circulation opprtunities,'' Kerr said.
   McCall's, a monthly with a circulation of 5.1 million, was
founded in 1876 and gives the New York Times Co. two of the seven
largest-selling women's service magazines. The other is Family
Circle, which appears 17 times a year and has a circulation of 5.9
million copies.
   Overall, the Times Company Magazine Group now publishes 17
magazines in the United States and Europe.

   Import prices climbed 0.8 percent in the
April-June quarter, pushed higher by a steep jump in oil prices,
the Labor Department said Thursday.
   Energy prices jumped 18 percent in the second quarter following
an 18.4 percent rise in the first three months of the year.
   If not for the big surge in energy costs, import prices would
have actually fallen in the second quarter by 0.8 percent, the
department said.
   Rising strength in the dollar was credited for the drop in
non-fuel import prices. A stronger dollar makes imported goods
cheaper for Americans to buy. Import prices had risen 1.8 percent
in the first quarter.
   The price of U.S. exports edged down 0.1 percent in the second
quarter following a big 1.5 percent rise in the first quarter.
   The moderation in export prices was attributed to a decline in
food prices, which had been surging because of last summer's
drought, and a slower increase in the cost of machinery exports.
   For the 12 months ending in June, import prices are up 3.3
percent and export prices are up 3.4 percent.

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sri Lanka said Thursday it will not
fight India even if India refuses to remove peacekeeping forces by
President Ranasinghe Premadasa's Saturday deadline.
   The government imposed a nationwide curfew to prevent violence
by Sinhalese radicals leading an anti-India campaign. State-run
radio said the curfew would begin at midnight and remain in force
until Saturday morning.
   Officials in New Delhi and Colombo said Foreign Minister Ranjan
Wijeratne and unidentified Indian officials were negotiating the
Indian withdrawal in Colombo.
   Wijeratne told reporters that India had not agreed to two major
conditions _ to accept Premadasa as the commander-in-chief of Sri
Lankan forces and honor a cease-fire between Indian troops and
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest and most militant
rebel group fighting for a Tamil nation in northeastern Sri Lanka.
   United News of India quoted unidentified Foreign Ministry
sources in New Delhi as saying India was unlikely to accept the
conditions.
   But officials in Colombo said India agreed to begin withdrawing
the troops if Wijeratne agreed to visit New Delhi to discuss
outstanding issues. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Fears of an armed confrontation between the nations mounted
after Premadasa vowed to take ``necessary steps'' if the estimated
45,000 Indian soldiers deployed two years ago in northeastern Sri
Lanka did not leave by Saturday.
   Asked what Sri Lanka would do if India rejected the conditions,
Wijeratne said: ``We are not going to fight India. We know our
limitations.
   ``The president will take a course of action which he will spell
out after the 29th. But we still feel we can resolve this problem.''
   He did not rule out the possibility of raising the issue with
the United Nations and the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation. India and Sri Lanka are members of the group, along
with Pakistan, Nepal, the Maldives, Bangladesh and Bhutan.
   Under a July 1987 peace accord, the minority Tamils were
promised limited autonomy if militants surrendered their arms. The
Indian troops were deployed in accordance with the agreement to
supervise the transition, and they operate under an Indian army
commander.
   While most militias abided by the accord, the dominant Tamil
Tigers backed out and began attacking Indian soldiers. About 1,000
troops have been killed.
   Premadasa demanded on June 1 that India withdraw its troops,
after the Tamil Tigers opened peace talks with his government.
India refused, saying a premature withdrawal could lead to even
more bloodshed.
   Subsequent requests by Premadasa and refusals by India's prime
minister, Rajiv Gandhi, led to a diplomatic impasse and fears about
the safety of the Indians _ civilians as well as soldiers _ on the
island.
   A Tamil newspaper published in Jaffna, 185 miles north of
Colombo, said Thursday that at least 15 Tamil civilians were killed
in cross fire Wednesday during a clash between the rebels and
Indian soldiers at the northern village of Point Pedro, a rebel
stronghold.
   A Foreign Ministry official in New Delhi said the soldiers shot
and killed nine rebels. The official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, made no mention of civilian casualties.
   Sinhalese extremists say India's presence compromises Sri
Lanka's sovereignty, and they have launched a violent
anti-government and anti-Indian campaign.
   On Wednesday, attackers hurled two bombs at two Indian banks
near the capital, while others set fire to an Indian-owned factory.
Police blamed the attacks on Sinhalese militants belonging to the
left-wing People's Liberation Front.
   About 4,000 people have died in the front's two-year campaign.
At least 11,000 people were killed in the six-year Tamil separatist
movement.
   The predominantly Hindu Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's population, say the Sinhalese discriminate against them in
jobs and education. The Buddhist Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent
of the 16 million people, control the government and the military.

   A former official at the scandal-scarred
Department of Housing and Urban Development on Thursday declined to
appear before a congressional panel because his attorney has been
ill, said the chairman of the panel.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif, said Lance Wilson, former executive
assistant to then-Housing Secretary Samuel Pierce, said he would
not testify as scheduled Friday before the House Government
Operations housing and employment subcommittee.
   Lantos said the letter was delivered Thursday from the office of
Raymond Banoun to the subcommittee, which has been investigating
allegations of fraud and mismanagement at the housing agency.
   Earlier this week, Lantos refused Wilson's request to postpone
his appearance.
   Wilson, 41, served as Pierce's top aide from January 1981 to
June 1984. He later worked at the New York City Housing Development
Corp., a group that raised money through bond issues for low- and
moderate-income housing development.
   Wilson participated in several projects with former HUD
officials through a development group led by Philip Winn, former
assistant secretary of housing and current ambassador to
Switzerland, according to a congressional staff member.
   Wilson introduced Pierce to Deborah Gore Dean, who succeeded him
at HUD and has recently been named by several witnesses as a key
figure in deciding which projects received funding through HUD's
scandal-plagued moderate rehabilitation program. Ms. Dean last
month refused to testify before the Lantos panel on grounds of
possible self-incrimination.

<HEAD>House Panel Passes Flag Bill; GOP Says Its Useless</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates with Michel quote and clarifies it was Republican leaders

All but ... the flag.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A House committee on Thursday approved a flag
protection bill that was pushed by Democrats but dismissed by
Republicans as useless for overcoming the Supreme Court ruling
permitting flag burning.
   One Democratic leader said he and others in his party would ``go
to the wall'' to block a constitutional amendment against flag
desecration, which the Republicans and President Bush say is
necessary.
   The House Judiciary Committee, in a quarrelsome session, voted
28-6 for a statute that says, ``Whoever knowingly mutilates,
defaces, burns or tramples upon any flag of the United States shall
be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than one year,
or both.''
   All but one of the 13 Republicans voting supported the bill _ as
a symbolic gesture for the flag, one said. But the Republican
leadership blocked the Democrats' plan to bring the bill before the
full House next week.
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel of Illinois told reporters
that White House Chief of Staff John Sununu urged the GOP
leadership this week to speak out more on the flag because it was a
``wedge issue'' _ one that breaks the Democrats apart.
   Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said at a news conference
after the vote that the bill would come up in September and he
couldn't imagine why any lawmaker would favor amending the
constitution if a regular statute would protect the flag.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., added, ``The
people who pose as the most vigilant supporters of flag protection
... seem more interested in adding political graffiti to the
Constitution than in protecting the physical integrity of the
American flag.''
   The Democrats carried with them the U.S. flag that flew over the
Capitol the day Pearl Harbor was attacked, in Rome after that city
was liberated, and over the U.S.S. Missouri when Gen. Douglas
MacArthur accepted Japan's surrender.
   In the war of symbols, Bush had used the Iwo Jima memorial to
the Marines when he endorsed the constitutional amendment.
   In the committee, GOP members were repeatedly beaten back when
they attempted to scuttle the legislation, including a second
attempt in two days to substitute a constitutional amendment.
   ``The purpose of this statute is to provide appropriate
protection for the American flag without getting into the first
retreat in American history (from) the Bill of Rights,'' said Rep.
Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the committee's constitutional
rights subcommittee.
   ``That is something we will go to the wall for in the morning,
in the afternoon and in the evening,'' he said.
   But Republicans said the only way to overcome the Supreme Court
ruling was with a constitutional amendment.
   ``The bill is essentially useless,'' said Rep. Carlos Moorhead,
R-Calif., who said Republicans would vote for it in committee only
as in symbolic support of the flag.
   At the White House, spokeswoman Alixe Glen said the statute
proposed in Congress was unconstitutional and unworkable.
   ``The amendment is the only way to go,'' she said predicting the
amendment eventually will go to the floor and pass.
   Although determined to try a statute first, before a
constitutional amendment, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks,
D-Texas, said he would back an amendment if the statute didn't work.
   ``If the Supreme Court should rule down this statute, which I do
not believe they will ... I would introduce a constitutional
amendment,'' Brooks told his committee.
   The measure passed in the committee after opponents from both
the left and the right attacked it.
   ``This statute is a mess, and it's obvious it's a mess from
everything we've seen and heard this morning,'' said Rep. Chuck
Douglas, R-N.H., a conservative who was blocked by Brooks when he
tried to offer a constitutional amendment.
   Douglas, the only Republican to vote against the bill, protested
what he suggested were Democratic strong-arm tactics with props for
the television cameras, including a gag over his mouth and a pair
of flags, one dirty and one clean.
   The latter was to demonstrate his doubts about a section of the
bill allowing for disposal of worn or soiled flags, traditionally
done by burning.
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., one of five Democrats who voted
against the statute and who also oppose a constitutional amendment,
offered an amendment to ban cross burnings.
   ``Cross burnings for centuries have been more of a problem in
the United States than flag burnings,'' said Conyers, who was also
ruled out of order by Brooks.
   The Senate is to take up both a proposed statute and
constitutional amendment on flag desecration in October.

<UNK>Mortar Shells Fired At Police Base in Northern Namibia</UNK>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five mortar shells were fired at a
northern police base Thursday in the first armed conflict reported
since heavy fighting in April, when the transition to independence
began, officials said.
   A spokesman for Louis Pienaar, the territorial administrator
installed by South Africa, said the shells fell short of the Etale
police base, about 20 miles south of the Namibia-Angola border. No
damage or injuries were reported and police said the attackers,
unidentified, fled south in a motor vehicle.
   Gen. Dolf Gouws, territorial police commander, said the mortar
shells and a land mine found near the scene were of Soviet origin.
He said police officers and U.N. police monitors were investigating.
   South Africa has governed Namibia since World War I and agreed
to independence as part of a regional accord that also requires
Cuban troops to leave neighboring Angola.
   The U.N.-supervised independence plan provides for a cease-fire
between South African-led security forces and guerrillas of the
South-West Africa People's Organization, who began a bush war for
independence in 1966.
   In April, about 340 guerrillas and 27 members of the security
forces were killed in fighting that began when SWAPO members
crossed the border.
   South Africa said the incursion violated an agreement that the
guerrillas would remain in bases at least 100 miles inside Angola
until repatriated as unarmed civilians.
   More than 5,000 U.N. military and police personnel are in the
territory to monitor the transition and pre-independence elections
scheduled for November.

   The government is fining a New Jersey
brake-shoe manufacturing plant $2.7 million for exposing workers to
what officials say are potentially deadly levels of asbestos
despite signed cleanup agreements, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole
announced Thursday.
   In addition, her department posted ``imminent danger'' notices
inside the Trenton, N.J., plant Thursday in English and Spanish,
warning workers, half of whom are Hispanic, of ongoing hazards to
their health, Mrs. Dole said.
   ``I think there is much that can be done,'' she said, to ``get
them out of danger right now.''
   Air inside the Friction Division Products Inc. plant, where 158
workers produce brake shoes for automobiles and trucks, contains as
much as 15 times the permissible level of asbestos, government
inspectors said.
   Mrs. Dole said her department lacked authority to shut down the
company. However, she pledged department cooperation in protecting
the jobs of workers who refused to place themselves at further risk
and said she would let New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean know money from
her discretionary fund could be used to help them.
   A program of enforcement, including the highest Occupational
Safety and Health Administration fine ever levied solely for a
health violation, was taken against the company, she said.
   The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has
gathered evidence that at least two of the workers have lung
cancer, Mrs. Dole said. She added that two others have developed a
lung disease and others show evidence of sickness from exposure to
the fibers at work.
   Robert Carney, president of the company, was out of town and
could not be reached immediately for comment, a company employee
said. His firm has 15 days to respond to the citations.
   Carney ``is well aware of the OSHA standards. He does know of
the citations. He has signed agreements,'' in 1987 and 1988, said
Alan C. McMillan, acting assistant secretary of labor for
occupational safety and health. ``In each of these previous
agreements, he has committed himself to an abatement schedule,'' he
said.
   McMillan said the plant ``is inches deep in dust which according
to our findings is in some places 90 percent asbestos.''

   An avalanche of mud and rock loosened by heavy
rains covered two buildings in southwest China, bringing the
storm-related death toll nationwide to more than 1,800 since the
rainy season began in June, officials said Thursday.
   In Korea, dozens have died and more than 50,000 have been left
homeless in heavy flooding, and in Taiwan, a mudslide killed a
family of four as 16 inches of rain covered one region in a 14-hour
period, officials in both country's said.
   In India, the worst monsoon storms in 25 yearshave battered
rural communities since Sunday, killing at least 500 people and
causing millions of dollars in damages, according to officials in
New Delhi.
   In China's southwest Yibin City, two buildings collapsed,
burying 17 people, the official Xinhua News Agency said. Three were
dug from the mud, but one died and two were in serious condition,
the agency said.
   In western China's Qinghai province, 31 people have died in
torrential rains over the past two weeks, Xinhua said. It reported
three additional deaths in flooding in central Anhui province.
   Thousands of peasants, aided by soldiers, stacked sandbags along
rain-swollen river banks and took other emergency measures to
prevent further flooding.
   Along Korea's southern coast, villagers clambered onto rooftops
and flash floods slammed cars against buildings, killing 55 people
and leaving 48 missing, according to the National Disaster Center
in Seoul. Communications to remote areas were cut off and the
center predicted the official death toll would rise.
   Some Korean villages, drenched with 17.6 inches of rain over
three days, were virtually submerged and television footage showed
only the tops of tile roofs surrounded by water.
   In central Taiwan Thursday, floodwaters smashed houses and
bridges, inundated rice paddies and disrupted train service. At
least five people died, including a family of four, police said in
Taipei on condition of anonymity.
   In southern Pakistan, 31 people died and 20,000 were left
homeless in seasonal monsoon rains, according to authorities in
Karachi. Rains have battered the southern province of Sind for four
days, felling powerlines and washing away mud homes.
   In Pakistan's largest city of Karachi, 18 people died in
flooding. The low-lying slum areas were the hardest hit as rains
washed away scores of homes, officials said.
   In Nepal, flash flooding and landslides killed 29 people
nationwide, destroyed at least 225 homes and caused damage
estimated at about $1 million, acording to Nepalese Home Minister
Niranjan Thapa.

   Paul Christoph Mangelsdorf, a retired
Harvard professor and leading expert in the origins and breeding of
corn, has died, Harvard University announced Thursday. He was 90.
   Mangelsdorf helped develop hybrid seed corn without the costly
process of removing corn tassels by hand and was the first person
to develop winter wheat with rust-resistant stems.
   He joined Harvard as a professor of economic botany and spent
his final years at the school as the Fisher Professor of Natural
History.
   After he retired in 1968, Mangelsdorf held a retirement

<HEAD>Police Kill Three Rebels; Guerrillas Blow Up Power Stations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said Thursday they killed three rebels
in a night of violence in which guerrillas bombed six buses in Lima
and blew up two power stations in Huancayo, causing blackouts in
the capital and other cities.
   The highland city of Huancayo, a bottleneck for the
hydroelectric power network that supplies the coast, was completely
blacked out Wednesday night. It is 140 miles east of Lima.
   During the blackout, Shining Path rebels attacked four police
posts, three shops, a bank and three public buildings, causing
considerable damage but no casualties, according to police.
   Police in Lima said one rebel was burned and five were captured
when bands of Shining Path rebels set fire to six buses in
different parts of Lima Wednesday night and Thursday morning.
   Four state buses and two private ones were destroyed. Police
said rebels riding as passengers ordered everyone off the buses at
preselected points on routes where accomplices waited with gasoline
bombs.
   Also in Lima, police killed three rebels and recovered homemade
bombs, grenades and three automatic weapons when they confronted
the group near a police precinct on the northern outskirts of the
capital.
   Police said one of the rebels, a woman, carried a knapsack with
thousands of flyers calling on workers to strike in protest against
the government Thursday, the eve of Peru's independence anniversary.
   Parts of Lima remained blacked out Thursday, and authorities did
not say how long the outage would last. Anibal Tomasich, operations
chief of the state ElectroPeru company, said a rationing plan
giving priority to hospitals and police stations will be introduced
until the system is repaired.
   In June, power was rationed for more than two weeks after
guerrillas blew up 16 high-tension power pylons in the mountains.
   The government recently said attacks on power lines have cost
Peru $7 million this year, not including lost revenue when power is
cut.
   The Maoist Shining Path has been fighting Peru's elected
government since 1980. Starting near the southern highland city of
Ayacucho, 235 miles southeast of Lima, the group has spread its
influence throughout the Andean highlands and into the
coca-producing jungles of the northeast.
   The government says more than 15,000 people have died in the
violence.

<HEAD>Use of Crack Drug Escalating in Britain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crack abuse is spreading rapidly throughout
Britain, and the government must urgently start a public awareness
campaign to dampen demand for the highly addictive cocaine-based
drug, legislators warned Thursday.
   Parliament's Home Affairs Committee said it was so alarmed by
the effects of crack during a U.S. tour last month that it rushed
out a preliminary report calling for urgent precautions in Britain.
   Crack, the most potent and toxic form of cocaine available, is
five to 10 times as addictive as cocaine taken in other forms and
``can be almost instantly addictive,'' the committee said.
   ``It can take over a person's life in under a week,'' it said.
``There is, as yet, no such person as a fully recovered crack
addict.''
   On the initiative of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Britain
is hosting an international conference next year on ways of
reducing demand for drugs, especially crack.
   The committee, made up of legislators from all main parties,
said U.S.-style cocaine help lines and an intelligence-gathering
network should be set up to assess the extent of crack abuse.
   But it said there is enough available evidence to indicate
``crack misuse is an escalating problem.''
   Customs agents made 36 seizures of crack in the first six months
of this year, compared with five seizures in the first half of 1987
and 12 seizures in the first half of last year.
   Britain must learn from successful American anti-drug
strategies, and keep in mind that U.S. authorities initially
underestimated the crack threat and did not place enough emphasis
on anti-drug education campaigns, the committee said.
   It recommended the government ``urgently consider establishing a
sustained public awareness campaign, in addition to current
programs, to reduce demand for crack targeted on those likely to be
most vulnerable to crack addiction.''

<HEAD>African Students in China Agree to End Sit-in</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 40 Zairean students studying in China
decided to end a sit-in at their embassy after 10 days, even though
their government refused to promise all the overdue allowances they
demanded, the protesters said Thursday.
   The African students said they called off the protest under
pressure from Zaire's governmen, which one said had responded to
their demands with intimidation.
   ``They tried to frighten us; they said we are rebels,'' said
Katembo Salumu, one of the protesters. ``We said what we are doing
is not a political movement; we want money, money, money.''
   Embassy officials have refused comment on the protest.
   Salumu said the students got a telex from the government saying
they must leave the embassy in Beijing before the problem could be
solved. He said the protesters decided Wednesday night to end their
protest Friday and return to school.
   The students, who attend schools in Canton, Shanghai and Nanjing
as well as Beijing, began their protest in the Zairean Embassy's
walled compound July 17. They demanded their government provide the
promised living subsidies and plane tickets home for graduates.
   When it sent the students to China, it agreed to pay them $89 a
month each, but it has not paid the stipend for 23 months, the
students said.
   Zaire has sent 89 students to China. Most are pursuing
undergraduate degrees in the sciences.
   China's government also provides them with a living subsidy of
about $70 a month.
   The protesters said Thursday the embassy promised to pay for
graduates to fly home, but made no promise about the full stipends.
   ``I'm not happy. I need the money more than the plane ticket,''
said Manu Kapapa, 29, a recent graduate from the China University
of Chemical Technology in Shanghai. He added, however: ``We've got
to be reasonable. I think it's better to work with them.''
   During the sit-in, students passed their days reading books and
talking near the embassy gates.
   They locked the gates from the inside Monday and kept out the
embassy staff, but reopened the gates Tuesday when Zaire's cultural
exchange office said part of the subsidies would be paid.
   Kapapa said the students fear retaliation when they return to
Zaire, but felt they achieved one of their goals: making President
Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire aware of the problem.
   Zairean students in other countries have also complained of not
receiving stipends.

<HEAD>Two Accused of Breaching Heathrow Security</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men were charged Thursday with illegally
entering London's Heathrow airport and a jetliner there, police
said.
   Scotland Yard, the London police headquarters, said the two
accused, Lionel Scurville and Darren Whelan, both aged 21, are
accused of breaking the airport bylaws on March 4 and March 23.
They gave no other details about the two.
   ``They entered a prohibited area by scaling a wall, climbed into
a jumbo jet through the nosewheel, entered the cabin and filmed
their actions,'' said a Yard spokeswoman.
   She said she had no information on when the two might appear in
court to answer the charges and could not explain the four-month
lapse between the alleged offenses and the charges.
   The apparent breach of security was raised in the House of
Commons in March after Independent Television News showed a
videotape of the accused in the airport and in the cabin of a
British Airways Boeing 747 parked there.
   It followed international controversy over security at airports
after a Pan Am 747 flying from Heathrow to New York was blown up
over Scotland and crashed on Lockerbie on Dec. 21, killing all 259
people on board and 11 others on the ground. Investigators blame a
bomb placed in baggage in the hold.
   After the crash, a number of British reporters said they had
breached security at Heathrow without difficulty, obtaining jobs as
cleaners or baggage handlers and moving around the airport and in
and out of parked aircraft without being challenged.

<HEAD>CIA Opened Station at Costa Rica's Request</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At the request of the Costa Rican government,
the CIA helped set up a communications station in the Central
American country and developed a program dealing with Nicaraguan
nationals, a court filing by Iran-Contra prosecutors said Thursday.
   The document, filed in the criminal case against a former CIA
station chief, provides a glimpse of the spy agency's efforts to
help prepare Costa Rica for the possibility of an invasion by the
leftist government of Nicaragua starting in late 1984.
   The Costa Rican government approached the United States for
help, says the court document filed by prosecutors from the office
of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh.
   Initiated as a result of the request was a program to assist and
improve the effectiveness of Costa Rica's defense forces, the court
document said.
   ``Another of these projects, begun in 1985, was a sophisticated
communications station to be used by the Costa Rican government to
bolster the security of Costa Rica,'' it added.
   ``A third program, dealing with Nicaraguan nationals in Costa
Rica, was designed to enhance Costa Rica's preparation for possible
aggressive action by Nicaragua.''
   Costa Rica doesn't have a standing army, but rather a civil and
rural guard of 9,500, including 3,000 reservists.
   Prosecutors had proposed that the summary of information about
the three highly sensitive CIA programs be presented in the trial
of Joseph Fernandez, the agency's former station chief in Costa
Rica.
   But Fernandez says that he must be allowed to introduce greater
detail about the three programs to properly defend himself against
criminal charges and U.S. District Court Judge Claude Hilton in
Alexandria, Va., agreed.
   On Monday, the Justice Department, citing national security
concerns of the CIA, stepped in and obtained a stay of Fernandez's
trial from a U.S. Court of Appeals judge in Richmond, Va.
   Fernandez is charged with lying to the Tower Commission and the
CIA inspector general's office about his help to Oliver North's
resupply network to the Nicaraguan Contras.
   In the court filing with the appeals court in Richmond,
Iran-Contra prosecutors strongly objected to the Justice
Department's stepping into the case to delay the trial.
   ``The language of the Ethics in Government Act unambiguously
provides the Independent Counsel, and not the Department of
Justice, has the sole discretion to appeal from the district
court's rulings,'' said the 55-page brief filed by Walsh.
   The Justice Department is seeking to formally intervene in the
case and to have the appeals court reconsider Hilton's rulings,
which conclude that Fernandez needs to present substantial amounts
of classified information in his defense.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Thursday he
resisted pressures from the United States to include a
land-for-peace clause in his peace plan and said he would never
relinquish territory to the Palestinians.
   Shamir's remarks in an impassioned fist-thumping speech to
rabbis in Jerusalem came as PLO Chief Yasser Arafat also appeared
to harden his position by publishing four tough preconditions to
accepting the Israeli peace proposal.
   The Israeli plan calls for 1.7 million Palestinians in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to elect representatives to
negotiate an interim settlement of self-rule.
   Arafat, in demands outlined by Egypt's state-owned newspaper,
Al-Ahram, called on Israel to agree to Palestinian statehood in the
occupied territories and to withdraw troops in 27 months.
   In violence in the occupied lands, soldiers fatally shot a
20-year-old Palestinian in the chest during a stone-throwing
protest in the West Bank's Tulkarem refugee camp, Arab reports
said. The Palestinian was identified as Mohammed Omar Safouri.
   An 11-year-old boy was seriously wounded in the same incident,
the reports said. The army said it was checking the reports.
   Two Palestinian teen-agers, aged 14 and 15, suffered moderate
gunshot wounds in clashes with soldiers in the Gaza Strip,
according to Arab reports.
   In Jerusalem, police detained a 14-year-old Palestinian girl who
stabbed and injured an officer as he grabbed her during a
stone-throwing demonstration, city police spokesman Uzi Sandori
said.
   Also Thursday, Khaled Naif Abdeen, 23, was axed to death in the
town of Khan Yunis in the Gaza Strip, apparently as a suspected
collaborator with Israeli authorities, the reports said. The army
confirmed the slaying but said the circumstances were unclear.
   The fatalities raised the death toll to 521 Palestinians killed
by Israeli soldiers or civilians, and 85 killed by fellow Arabs
during the 19-month-old uprising against Israeli rule. Thirty-eight
Israelis also have died in the unrest.
   In his speech broadcast on Israel radio, Shamir said American
leaders ``tried to persuade me to include in the initiative, as one
of its principle parts, conceding part of the land of Israel. Even
with a hint, using the diplomatic words, land for peace.''
   ``I rejected this wholeheartedly because I say and believe it is
possible to reach peace without, heaven forbid, giving up a grain
of the holy land of our forefathers,'' Shamir said, as he was heard
pounding his fist on a table.
   He also vowed to continue Jewish settlement building in the
occupied territories, despite persistent warnings from the U.S.
that the settlements are an obstacle to peace.
   ``We will stand by their (the settlers') side and build many
Jewish settlements all over the land of Israel,'' Shamir said.
   But hardliners in Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc criticized his
latest meetings with Palestinians, charging he was circumventing a
government boycott of the PLO, Israeli reports said.
   The criticism of Shamir followed reports that a pro-PLO lawyer
from the West Bank town of Ramallah, Jamil Tarifi, had met the
Israeli prime minister secretly this month.
   The PLO's news agency, Wafa, said in Tunis Thursday that the
meeting with Tarifi was ``with the knowledge and approval of the
Palestinian leadership.''
   Shamir has acknowledged meeting with Palestinians saying the
talks were aimed only at finding dialogue partners outside the PLO.
   Israel rejects dialogue with the PLO claiming it is a terrorist
organization bent on the country's destruction.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, said the meetings were
productive despite a wide gap between Israeli and Palestinian
positions.
   ``There are signs of a relaxation in the air,'' Rabin said on
television, referring to a decline in violent incidents in the
disputed lands. ``There are signs of increasing desire to move the
process from a violent conflict to a political solution.''
   In his remarks to the Egyptian newspaper, Arafat said Israel's
election plan was ``a good idea,'' but said it should lead to
formation of a Palestinian state.
   He also called for a partial Israeli troop withdrawal in advance
of elections, U.N. supervision of balloting, a total Israeli
pullout and repatriation of Palestinian refugees.
   Israel has rejected all these positions.
   In the Gaza Strip, meanwhile, four prominent doctors urged the
United States to play a greater role in pressuring Israel to make
concessions.
   Lawyer Zuhair El-Rais, a founding member of the PLO, said he
told U.S. Ambassador to Tel Aviv William Brown, America must be ``a
full partner to the peace process... They must put more pressure on
Israel and practice a more balanced policy toward Palestinians.''

<TEXT>
   Eighty-one House Democrats complained to
President Bush Thursday that his party's campaign operatives are
beating up on them politically for voting to support White House
positions.
   The most recent example, they said, is a spate of news releases
mailed into Democrats' home districts accusing them of going
``AWOL'' in the war on drugs because they supported Bush in
opposing a random drug-testing amendment for State Department
employees.
   ``To pursue your agenda you need our votes,'' the lawmakers
wrote in a blunt letter to the president that reminded him of an
inaugural pledge to extend a hand to the Democrat-controlled
Congress. Many Democrats have tried to reciprocate, it said.
   ``Having one's outstretched hand slashed so ferociously, and so
deceitfully, does not nurture an inclination to reach out at the
next invitation,'' the letter stated.
   ``I hate to say it's a conspiracy,'' said Rep. Richard
Stallings, D-Idaho, who organized the letter-writing effort along
with Rep. Peter Hoagland, D-Neb. ``But it's happened too often.
It's no longer just a coincidence.''
   The most recent example of alleged backstabbing came over the
June 28 drug-testing vote. Bush's State Department opposed the
amendment, saying it was unnecessary and duplicated existing laws.
The department already has a drug-testing plan in the works, it
argued in two position papers sent to Capitol Hill.
   Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., the measure's sponsor, urged
colleagues to support the measure anyway so they could ``go back to
your districts this Fourth of July and proudly say the Congress
took a first step in declaring war on their drug use.''
   The amendment narrowly failed, 212 to 204, with 177 Democrats
joining 35 Republicans to help Bush's position prevail.
   Just a day later, the National Republican Congressional
Committee dispatched news releases to the districts of 21 Democrats
saying of each, ``When the time came for action instead of
rhetoric, he flunked the test.'' None of the 35 Republicans who
supported Bush was attacked.
   The incident is part of an ``alarming pattern,'' the lawmakers
told Bush.
   ``We need your reciprocal assurance that when we vote with you
on difficult issues, at your personal request, or at the request of
members of your administration, we will not find that bipartisan
spirit so shamelessly betrayed as it was in this instance.''
   GOP political operatives from Republican National Committee
Chairman Lee Atwater to NRCC head Edward J. Rollins have come
increasingly into the spotlight this year for harsh attacks on
Democratic lawmakers.
   Similar news releases were sent out criticizing 22 Democrats who
opposed an amendment to cut $45,000 from the National Endowment for
the Arts for its support of two controversial art projects.

<HEAD>Millions of Honeybees Killed in Spraying for Grasshoppers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Insecticides intended to combat a grasshopper
infestation have killed destroyed millions of honeybees in
Minnesota, creating potential losses of honey and of the crops that
bees pollinate.
   Extensive spraying has curbed grasshoppers that thrived during
the past two drought years, said state Agriculture Commissioner Jim
Nichols. But it also has killed bees by the millions.
   ``I don't blame the farmers for trying to save their crops,''
said Dale Bauer, a beekeeper from Fertile. ``I blame the regulatory
authorities of the state of Minnesota. The regulations in this
state are too loose.''
   In the past three weeks, Bauer has waded through dead bees up to
3 inches deep to inspect his 4,000 bee colonies in several
northwestern counties. He estimates that 500 of his colonies were
destroyed and 700 damaged.
   A colony is worth about $100 and usually houses more than 50,000
bees by July _ meaning at least 25 million bees died in Bauer's
apiary. Several other beekeepers have reported heavy losses to
Blane White, state bee inspector.
   Minnesota Extension Service entomologist Dave Noetzel said some
land had to be treated more than once, and large numbers of
grasshoppers still threaten crops, partly because they still are
hatching.
   Noetzel said farmers and applicators may have ignored advice to
use sprays least toxic to bees. The bees also may have died because
farmers sprayed too close to beehives or during hours that bees are
active in the fields.
   There is no evidence that honey will contain residues from the
pesticides, White said, but ``it is a definite area of concern''
the state will monitor.
   What's more likely is a sharp drop in the state's honey crop,
worth about $10 million last year. Yields of sunflowers and
soybeans also may fall because there are fewer bees and other
insects to pollinate them, White said.
   Agriculture commissioner Nichols said drought relief measures
pending before Congress should reimburse beekeepers and farmers for
spraying costs expected to reach $35 million.
   Much of the controversy surrounding the spraying stems from a
new state law that empowers townships in designated ``control
zones'' to order spraying of infested areas where crops are
threatened.
   If a landowner balks, authorities can spray the property and add
the costs to the owner's tax bill. Since early June, 662 townships
in 37 counties _ roughly the western half of the state _ have been
declared control zones.
   Farmers and local officials in the zones are allowed to spray
any insecticide approved by the Environmental Protection Agency.
State and federal law requires them to follow label directions
intended to minimize the impact on bees and wildlife.

   Thunderstorms developed Thursday along the Appalachians and

stormy weather also spread over the south-central part of the

   Severe thunderstorms developed by afternoon across parts of
eastern Wisconsin, ahead of a cold front that was pushing into warm

   Hail as big as golf balls fell near Oshkosh, and hail up to 2
inches in diameter was reported about 30 miles northwest of
Milwaukee, in Ozaukee County in southeastern Wisconsin.
   Strong thunderstorms also traveled from southern Lower Michigan
into northern and central Ohio, producing wind gusts to near 35 mph
in Detroit along with brief heavy rain. Heavy rain and small hail
was reported in northern Van Wert County in western Ohio.
   Showers and scattered thunderstorms extended from New York state
and western New England into the central Appalachians in warm and
humid air. Tree limbs and power lines were downed by gusty wind in
New York's Chemung County, along the Pennsylvania border.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered across parts of
southern Texas as an upper level disturbance moved westward across
the western Gulf of Mexico. Palacios, Texas., got 1.15 inches of
rain in the 6 hours up to 2 p.m. EDT.
   Showers and thunderstorms also developed across the southern
Plains and into parts of the middle Mississippi Valley.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms were scattered over eastern
Utah and northern Arizona.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 58
degrees at San Simeon, Calif., to 102 at Needles, Calif. Thursday's
low in the Lower 48 states was 31 at Truckee, Calif.
   For Friday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from New England and the eastern Great Lakes through the
Appalachians and mid Atlantic states. Scattered afternoon and
evening showers and thunderstorms were forecast from the Texas Gulf
Coast into Mississippi and Alabama, and from the southern Atlantic
Coast into Florida. Afternoon and evening showers and thunderstorms
were forecast from western Montana into eastern Arizona.
   Highs in the 70s were predicted along the central and northern
Pacific Coast, and across the northern Great Lakes; between 100 and
110 across the desert Southwest; and in the 80s or 90s across much
of the rest of the nation.

   The United States joined other Security
Council members Thursday in calling for the disbanding of the
Nicaraguan rebel forces as part of the Central American peace plan.
   The U.S. policy shift was balanced by the resolution's appeal to
all nations to halt military aid to guerrillas in the region.
However, the resolution specifically allows continued humanitarian
aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras.
   ``We call upon the governments of Nicaragua and Cuba to cease
their nine-year supply of weapons, ammunition, safe haven and other
lethal assistance to the FMLN insurgents in El Salvador,'' said
U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun.
   The FMLN is the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the
Marxist rebels fighting to overthrow El Salvador's conservative
government.
   Okun said the United States voted for the resolution to show
support for the Central American peace plan and for Nicaragua's
plans to hold national elections in 1990.
   The last time the Security Council considered the guerrilla wars
in Central America was in 1985; until Thursday, the United States
had prevented consideration of the issue.
   As recently as last spring, State Department spokesmen said
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government had to adopt an array of
democratic reforms before the 11,000-member Contra forces would be
disbanded.
   On Tuesday, though, the U.S. State Department's assistant
secretary in charge of Inter-American affairs, Bernard Aronson,
would not rule out the possibility of disbanding and repatriating
the force before Nicaragua's elections.
   Aronson said a repatriation plan could be carried out ``when
there are conditions that protect the security of the resistance
and their democratic rights.''
   Most of the Contras have been living with their families in
Honduran border camps since Congress halted military aid to them in
February 1988.
   The Security Council resolution appeals to all nations ``which
either openly or covertly supply aid to irregular forces or
insurrectional movements in the area (to) immediately halt such
aid, with the exception of the humanitarian aid'' that the United
States is sending to the Contras.
   The 15-member council adopted the resolution by consensus. It
also called on the Central American presidents to continue carrying
out their 1987 peace plan, which calls for democracy in the
region's nations and an end to guerrilla wars.
   The United Nations and Organization of American States have
agreed to provide poll watchers for presidential and parliamentary
elections in Nicaragua, set for Feb. 25, 1990.
   Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and Costa Rica also
have asked the United Nations to send a border patrol force to the
region to assure that no nation is used as a base by rebels seeking
to overthrow a neighboring country's government.
   That agreement, reached Feb. 14 at a summit meeting in El
Salvador, has been stalled by a dispute between Nicaragua and
Honduras over the procedure for implementing it.
   The permanent members of the Security Council are the United
States, Soviet Union, Britain, France, and China. The current
temporary members are Algeria, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Ethiopia,
Finland, Malaysia, Nepal, Senegal and Yugoslavia.

<HEAD>Consumers Groups Wary Of Eastern Flight Expansion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer groups accused Eastern Airlines on
Thursday of scheduling ``phantom flights'' that never take off and
said travelers should be particularly cautious of Eastern schedules
beginning next week.
   ``We're providing information travelers have to take into
account to decide for themselves whether to fly Eastern,'' said
Cornish Hitchcock, a spokesman for Public Citizen.
   The 50,000-member group, which takes pro-consumer stands on a
variety of issues, along with the Aviation Consumer Action Project
also said Eastern has far more complaints than other airlines, has
a poor record of making ticket refunds and is disregarding Federal
Aviation Administration recommendations by putting inexperienced
pilots and copilots aboard the same plane.
   Eastern spokesman Jim Ashlock said in Miami that the allegations
were ``silly''.
   He acknowledged that the airline has ``zeroed out'' some
scheduled flights by stopping ticket sales but said that was done
only to protect consumers since crews would not be available.
   Ashlock also said that Eastern had planned to increase from 225
daily flights to 390 next Tuesday, but that the number would be
held at about 350 until mid-August because of the inability to
train enough pilots by the first of the month. Before the strike,
the airline had flown about 1,000 flights a day.
   He said the high number of complaints recorded by the
Transportation Department was not a reflection of current problems
but stemmed from the immediate aftermath of the March 4 walkout by
machinists, pilots and flight attendants, which led the airline to
file for reorganizaton under bankruptcy laws. The court has power
over ticket refunds, he said.
   Ashlock said the airline is following all FAA requirements in
training and assigning pilots.
   ``We wouldn't want to break any FAA rules and we couldn't if we
did want to,'' Ashlock said.
   If two relatively new pilots are acting as captain and first
officer of a flight, they would be allowed to fly only in clear
weather and would have to follow procedures even stricter than
those required by the FAA, he said. Many of the newly hired pilots
have long experience, he said.
   Hitchcock, at a Public Citizen news conference, maintained most
of Eastern's ``phantom flights'' are scheduled out of Atlanta. When
passengers try to buy tickets, they are told the flights are sold
out when actually they are not going to fly at all, he charged.
   ``More broadly, what does this practice tell us about Eastern's
ability to rebuild operations and offer dependable scheduled
service?'' Hitchcock asked.
   He also said passengers should be aware that a bankruptcy court
decision earlier this month setting up a $5 million reimbursement
fund for travel agents may be acting as an incentive for agents to
sell Eastern tickets. The agreement, he said, requires that Eastern
increase the fund only if agents sell more than $3.6 million in
Eastern tickets each week.
   ``From a passenger's standpoint, ... this agreement raises
serious conflict-of-interest issues,'' Hitchcock said.
   He also said that if passengers do miss an Eastern flight or it
is cancelled, they may not be able to get refunds from other
airlines because many do not honor Eastern tickets.
   Ashlock acknowledged this might be true of some airlines but
said it is because Eastern's fares are so low. He said the airline
participates fully in ticket-pooling agreements.
   ``All our credentials are in place and the money is good,'' he
said.

<HEAD>British Railmen End National Strikes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union leaders Thursday accepted an 8.8 percent pay
raise from state-run British Rail and suspended a series of one-day
pay strikes that have intermittently paralyzed rail service.
   Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the National Union of
Railwaymen, announced the decision after a seven-hour meeting among
union leaders.
   He said the decision would preserve the ``high level of unity''
shown during the labor dispute over pay and collective bargaining.
   Knapp said talks would continue with British Rail on retaining a
system of national negotiations on pay and working conditions. The
company wants to replace collective bargaining with local
agreements.
   Sir Robert Reid, British Rail chairman, said, ``I am very
pleased that they have accepted our offer like the other two
unions,'' the locomotive engineers and the ticket clerks.
   The decision to end the strikes came amid signs of a crack in
worker solidarity Wednesday, when 12,500 of the 72,000 railmen
turned up for their jobs during the sixth 24-hour walkout in six
weeks, according to company estimates.
   The union had sought a 10 percent pay increase for its members.
They initially received considerable support from the public,
angered also by condition of the rundown national rail network.
   British Rail initially offered workers a 7 percent raise.
   But public exasperation with the lack of trains has mounted, and
Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition Labor Party, urged
railwaymen to end their strikes.
   Railwaymen are among Britain's lowest paid industrial workers.
With overtime, drivers earn the equivalent of about $485 a week,
while other railroad workers earn $335 weekly.
   A train drivers' dispute over pay and working conditions will
continue on the London subway, which carries about 1 million
passengers daily.

<HEAD>Bomber Killed in One of Five Explosions in Johannesburg</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said a man was killed
by a bomb he was setting on a railway line in the black township of
Soweto in one of five explosions around Johannesburg on Thursday.
   An anti-apartheid activist's home in an impoverished black
township was firebombed in one of the attacks.
   No serious injuries were reported in any of the blasts.
   Police spokesman Col. Frans Malherbe said, ``The black man who
planted the bomb was killed in the explosion on the main
Soweto-Johannesburg rail line about 9 p.m.'' There was no
information on damage.
   Malherbe also said a limpet mine exploded in a parking building
next to the J.G. Strijdom Hospital, which is reserved for whites.
There were no cars nearby and it caused no injuries or damage, he
said.
   At 11:30 p.m. another explosion went off in deserted downtown
Johannesburg, but Malherbe provided no further details.
   Earlier Thursday, an anti-apartheid activist's home in the
impoverished black township of Alexandra, on the northern edge of
Johannesburg, and a nearby residence for black nurses were damaged
in what witnesses said were firebomb attacks.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok announced earlier this week
that militant anti-apartheid groups would be mounting a sabotage
and protest campaign against Sept. 6 elections for Parliament. It
includes houses for whites, Asians and people of mixed race but
excludes representatives of the black majority of 28 million. South
Africa's blacks have no vote in national affairs decided by the 5
million white minority.
   The outlawed African National Congress has called for boycotts
of elections for the mixed-race and Asian parliament races.
Anti-apartheid organizations inside the country have called for
protests against the balloting and a mass defiance campaign against
racist laws such as those segregating hospitals, schools and
residential areas.
   Police have not said who they suspect in the explosions, and no
one has claimed responsibility. Both government and anti-government
institutions have been targets of bombings in the past three years.
   Police confirmed the pre-dawn fire at a house for nurses
employed by the Alexandra Health Clinic, but said the blaze may
have been caused by an electrical fault.
   Several nurses reportedly suffered cuts and bruises, and staff
said two men, one black and one white, were seen fleeing from the
scene shortly before an explosion occurred.
   The Human Rights Commission, an independent anti-apartheid
group, said the home of Alexandra youth group leader Paul Mashidile
was damaged by a firebomb early Thursday. The commission said
Mashidile is a former detainee who, like many other activists
released in recent months, is required to be at his home between 6
p.m. and 6 a.m.
   Mashidile, who was unhurt, told The Star newspaper of
Johannesburg that he found a container of gasoline outside the
house after being awoken by the fire, which broke out about 15
minutes after the explosion at the nurses' residence.

   William Lucas denied a new, unverified charge
about his commitment to civil rights on Thursday as the Senate
Judiciary Committee postponed a vote on his nomination for a key
Justice Department post.
   Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., who holds a pivotal vote, requested
the committee delay its decison so he could look into unidentified
last-minute information. ``I don't want to injure anybody _ the
allegations are not substantiated,'' he said.
   Congressional sources circulated a letter from attorney Michael
Sussman of Yonkers, N.Y., saying Lucas had telephoned the Justice
Department to urge it to drop a 1980 lawsuit against Birmingham,
Mich., charging Fair Housing Act violations.
   Other lawmakers said they were mystified about what new
information was bothering Heflin and there was no certainty that it
was the letter from Sussman, 35, who is currently representing the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in a
landmark Yonkers desegregation case.
   David Runkel, a spokesman for Attorney General Dick Thornburgh,
issued a denial from Lucas and described the allegation as
``reprehensible'' and a ``last-minute tactic'' designed to kill the
nomination.
   Lucas, 61, is seeking Senate confirmation as assistant attorney
general for civil rights. The former Wayne County, Mich., official,
who is black, has come under fire from some civil rights leaders as
unqualified, and the issue has ballooned into a full-scale
political fight with the Bush administration.
   The full Senate is likely to settle the matter regardless of
what happens in committee. But the administration wants a favorable
recommendation from the panel and the intensity of the campaign has
put the spotlight on the issue.
   Eight votes are needed for a favorable recommendation. Vote
counters on both sides say Lucas probably can rely on seven with
Heflin a question mark.
   At the Judiciary Committee meeting, Republican senators pushed
for an immediate vote with Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo.,
complaining that delay would ``give these extraordinary groups time
to just go out and keep ginning it up'' and ``find out what he did
when he was 16.''
   ``We need to bring balance to these things as we diddle around
with people and leave them hanging,'' Simpson said.
   Heflin warned Republicans, however, that if there were immediate
action, ``I'm prepared to vote but I may not vote the way you want
me to vote.''
   ``I wouldn't want to push him,'' said Sen. Strom Thurmond,
R-S.C., the ranking Republican on the committee.
   Any senator can postpone such a vote for one week, but Chairman
Joseph Biden, D-Del., said the committee definitely would reach its
decision Tuesday.
   Reacting to the panel's action, Thornburgh spokesman Runkel said
that the Justice Department remains confident that Lucas will be
confirmed.
   A leading Lucas critic, Ralph Neas, executive director of the
Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, said he remained confident
that the nominee eventually would be defeated.
   Sussman said in his letter that he ``was not personally the
recipient of Mr. Lucas's call (but) I distinctly recall discussing
it with my supervisor.''
   ``At the time I was thoroughly immersed in the case and,
consequently, in the political climate of the region,'' he said.
``It particularly struck me that Mr. Lucas _ who then was sheriff
of Wayne County and a political figure familiar to me from my
frequent visits to the area _ would attempt to intervene on behalf
of the defendant white officeholders.''
   Sussman said the case which was filed in April 1980 later was
decided in favor of the government by a U.S. District Court.
   Runkel told reporters Lucas ``denies that he ever had anything
to do with the Birmingham case. He was the sheriff of Wayne County.
This was a city in a different county.''
   Runkel said a check of a department correspondence file on the
case revealed no letters from Lucas.
   Sussman, reached in New York, said he recalls Lucas made a
telephone call, possibly to his supervisor, Joel Selig, three to
four weeks after the lawsuit was filed.
   Selig, reached at his home at Laramie, Wyo., said he did not
recall anything about a telephone call from Lucas concerning the
Birmingham case.

   A biodegradable golf tee and a finger puppet
that prevents thumb-sucking were among the inventions by
kindergarten and elementary school pupils to be recognized Thursday
at the annual ``Invent America!'' competition.
   Each of the nine winners, chosen from a group of 45 finalists,
received a $1,000 savings bond at the awards luncheon. One winning
invention was chosen for each grade.
   The contest, with a number of corporate sponsors, was begun in
1987 as part of a program to foster creativity and inventiveness
among the nation's school children. It is administered by the
private, nonprofit United States Patent Model Foundation.
   Erin Amos, a kindergartener from Tecumseh Elementary School in
Nebraska, invented the ``Thumb Huggers.''
   ``The happy-hugger keeps me company in bed so I don't have to
suck my thumb,'' he said.
   Casey Golden, a fifth-grader at Bergen Elementary School in
Evergreen, Colo., invented a ``Bio-D-Tee'' containing grass seed.
If the tee is broken during a shot, ``it stays on the grass and
will degrade when the grass is watered. The grass seed from the tee
will start to grow.''

   Saudi Arabian financier Adnan Khashoggi was
freed from a federal jail Thursday after posting $10 million bail
so he could live in his luxury apartment, with an electronic
bracelet limiting his movements.
   Khashoggi, who had been in custody since his April 18 arrest in
Switzerland, promised to stay in the country to face charges that
he helped Imelda and Ferdinand Marcos defraud the Philippine
treasury.
   Before being whisked away in a limousine, Khashoggi read a
handwritten statement to a crush of photographers, reporters and
spectators: ``I am pleased that the courts have granted me bail. I
am anxious to begin work for my defense and look forward to
clearing my name at trial.''
   The limousine took Khashoggi from his 75-foot jail cell to the
30,000-square-foot apartment he owns in the luxury Olympic Towers
building on Fifth Avenue, a pied-a-terre carved out of 16 separate
apartments. Among its luxuries is a swimming pool that overlooks
the spires of St. Patrick's Cathedral.
   He must wear an electronic bracelet, part of a system that would
alert authorities if he ventured beyond a prescribed distance. He
also was ordered to surrender his passport and not travel outside
Manhattan, the Bronx and the city's northern suburbs.
   His bail money came in the form of two $5 million checks. One of
the Barclays Bank checks was signed by his brother, Essam
Khashoggi, and the other by his half-brother, Amr Khashoggi.
   The bail was posted after an appeals judge refused to revoke a
bail package granted Khashoggi earlier in the week.
   U.S. District Judge John Keenan warned Khashoggi that if he
flees he could be tried in absentia and could be prosecuted for
jumping bail.
   ``I want to assure your honor that I will abide because I
cherish the relationship with America,'' Khashoggi told the judge.
   Keenan set a March 14 trial date for Khashoggi and his
co-defendants.
   Khashoggi, 54, has been in jail in New York since his
extradition July 19 from Switzerland, where he was arrested on
April 18.
   Prosecutors had opposed Khashoggi's release because they claimed
he had concealed his true wealth and was likely to flee. Judge
William Pierce of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied the
appeal and upheld Keenan's bail package.
   The Saudi-based National Commercial Bank filed a foreclosure
suit last month on Khashoggi's apartment, which has been featured
in House &amp; Garden magazine. But U.S. District Judge John Keenan
said Tuesday that defense lawyers had told the court the bank has
given Khashoggi a year to clear up the $28.7 million default.
   Khashoggi, the Marcoses, five other people and the California
Overseas Bank in Los Angeles were indicted last October. The
Marcoses were accused of stealing more than $100 million from the
Philippine treasury to buy real estate and art in New York.
   Khashoggi, who allegedly posed as the owner of some of the
assets as a cover, was indicted on charges of racketeering,
conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction of justice. However, the
Swiss government agreed to extradite him only on the last two
charges.
   He faces up to five years in jail and a $250,000 fine on each of
the two charges of mail fraud and obstruction of justice.
   Khashoggi also is said to have been the main financier and
middleman of the Iran-Contra affair, in which proceeds of illegal
U.S. arms sales to Iran went to rebels fighting the Nicaraguan
government.

<HEAD>Menem Hints, Again, He Favors a Pardon to Resolve Impasse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Carlos Menem hinted
strongly Thursday he will pardon military officers who face trial
on charges of abusing human rights during the 1976-83 dictatorship.
   ``I'm not going to walk to Congress with a law under my arm
asking that they approve it,'' Menem said. ``What (former President
Raul) Alfonsin did not do, I will do.''
   The convictions of seven officers and the possibility of more
trials led to three barracks revolts against Alfonsin, who left
office on July 8 following his defeat in the May presidential
election.
   Menem repeatedly has said he will resolve the impasse with the
military, although he has refused to say how or when. His advisers
have said the government was leaning toward forgiving soldiers
involved in the human rights abuses and the uprisings.
   On Wednesday, Defense Minister Italo Luder confirmed that
authorities had dropped disciplinary proceedings against several
hundred soldiers who took part in army insurrections in April 1987
and in January and December 1988.
   ``Lower-ranking officers were given minor sanctions and sent
back to their units,'' Luder said. He did not specify what the
penalties were.
   ``The objectives of these acts of indiscipline were shared by
all the armed forces,'' Luder said. The comment suggested that the
government believes reconciliation with the armed forces would be
difficult if the officers were punished.
   No one has been tried in the revolts. However, uprising leaders
Lt. Col. Aldo Rico and Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin and six other
officers have been in military prison since the revolts were put
down by negotiation. They caused little bloodshed.
   Menem's comments Thursday were to several local reporters he
invited to breakfast at Government House. They were reported by the
independent news agency Noticias Argentinas.
   Menem has three main choices in the case of officers charged
with human rights abuses: a presidential pardon, a congressional
amnesty or to move ahead with the trials of 15 generals and three
admirals that have been deferred for months. He has never spoken in
favor of the last option, but has not said he ruled it out.
   The issue bedeviled the government of Alfonsin, who was elected
in October 1983 to replace a military dictatorship.
   Rico's insurrections, in April 1987 and January 1988, were aimed
at ending the civilian trials of officers accused of human rights
abuses during the 1976-83 military dictatorship's crackdown on
leftist subversion. About 8,900 people who disappeared during the
period are presumed dead.
   In June 1987, the Alfonsin government passed a law that
sheltered from prosecution all but the highest officers accused of
human rights abuses.
   Seineldin led a rebellion in December 1988 that he said was
carried out to draw attention to soldiers' low pay and poor
equipment. The issue of trying officers also played a role, however.

   An airline passengers group Thursday called for
the grounding of all DC-10 jetliners in the United States until any
structural deficiencies are fixed, but federal regulators and the
aircraft maker rejected the call.
   The International Airline Passengers Association wants the
Federal Aviation Administration to order the planes out of use in
the wake of the July 19 crash of a United Airlines DC-10 in Sioux
City, Iowa, that killed 111, said spokesman Daniel Smith.
   ``We expect nothing less than structural modification of these
aircraft,'' said Smith. ``We cannot wait any longer to get the kind
of changes that need to be made.''
   Citing the Sioux City crash, Smith said it is evident that the
aircraft's dual hydraulic systems, necessary for flight control, do
not work and the systems need to be separate.
   IAPA wants to ``first, find out what's wrong with the aircraft;
and secondly, get it fixed,'' said a letter delivered Thursday to
FAA chief James Busey in Washington.
   Smith said the organization has not ruled out court action to
get the planes grounded, but in the letter said, ``We believe it is
far better for you to act independently, free of any imposed
direction from outside the FAA.''
   John Leyden, a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman in
Washington, rejected the demand that the planes be grounded.
   ``There's nothing that's come out of the Sioux City accident
indicating a basic design flaw that would warrant such an action,''
Leyden said.
   Also on Thursday, a Korean Air DC-10 crashed short of a fogbound
airport in Tripoli, Libya, killing at least 82 people. However, a
spokesman for the South Korean embassy there said no mechanical
problem was reported prior to the crash.
   Within hours of the IAPA announcement, McDonnell Douglas, the
maker of the DC-10, countered with its own press conference at the
Long Beach headquarters of Douglas Aircraft.
   ``I find it difficult to believe that a rational public, a
rational FAA and even a rational congress will put very much
credence in the statements of the IAPA,'' said Dale Warren, a
McDonnell Douglas vice president.
   ``The real concern, in my opinion, is that we worry about the
credibility of our aircraft to the traveling public,'' Warren said.
``We'd like to assure the traveling public that we have a fine
piece of aircraft that is safe to travel in.''
   Nevertheless, Warren said engineers are studying the crashes to
determine whether a design modification is needed.
   ``It would appear at this time that some action is
appropriate,'' Warren said.
   Among possible changes under consideration are additional backup
controls, ways of containing the damage from a jet engine explosion
and methods of shielding the hydraulic system from such damage.
   An initial investigation into the Iowa crash indicates that an
explosion in the rear engine threw pieces of the turbine through
the tail section, rupturing the hydraulic controls and backup
systems.
   Smith also claimed there are other design deficiencies in the
planes, which entered commercial fleets in 1971.
   At least 17, or 3.8 percent, of the 445 DC-10s built have been
wrecked because of their problems, Smith said. By comparison, 1.2
percent of the Lockheed L-1011's have been wrecked, and 1.5 percent
of the Boeing 747s have crashed, he said.
   The passengers association cited the Iowa crash as well as other
DC-10 accidents:
   _ 1974, a Turkish Airlines jet near Paris crashed after
explosive decompression and severed hydraulic lines; 346 killed.
   _ 1979, an American Airlines jet crashed on takeoff in Chicago
after the number one engine separated from the wing, rupturing
hydraulic lines connected to the wing slats; 273 died.
   McDonnell Douglas technical experts have been sent to Tripoli in
hopes of entering Libya to assist in the investigation of the
Korean Air crash there, Warren said.
   ``Presently there is no indication that the circumstances of the
Tripoli and Sioux City accidents are related, nor that they relate
to previous DC-10 accidents,'' he said.

<HEAD>Study Links Caffeine to Premenstrual Syndrome</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women who ingest even moderate amounts of
caffeine appear to be more susceptible to premenstrual syndrome, an
Oregon State University researcher says.
   A study by Annette Rossignol, associate professor of public
health, showed that women who drink half a cup to four cups of tea
a day were twice as likely to experience PMS. When the caffeine
intake was increased to 4{ to eight cups a day, the incidence of
PMS rose nearly tenfold.
   Rossignol noted Thursday that the tea used in the study
contained less caffeine than would be found in a cup of brewed
coffee or in some soft drinks.
   PMS, which occurs in the second half of the menstrual cycle, can
cause depression, fatigue, irritability, anxiety, headaches,
swelling or tenderness of the breasts and craving for sweet or
salty foods.
   The cause of PMS is unknown, but it affects about 70 percent of
women aged 18 and older, with 10 to 15 percent of the women
experiencing severe or disabling symptoms, Rossignol said.
   Rossignol said some researchers have suggested factors affecting
PMS may include diet, hormonal imbalance, alcohol and tobacco use,
oral contraceptives and lack of exercise.
   Her research four years ago found a possible correlation between
PMS and caffeine.
   ``One problem in studying caffeine and PMS is that unhealthy
habits tend to cluster,'' she said. ``People who drink a lot of
caffeine-containing beverages may also smoke, drink alcohol, be
prone to a lack of exercise or have poor dietary habits. It was
difficult to isolate the caffeine factor in association with PMS.''
   She said she eliminated those factors in her latest research,
when she co-directed a study of women nursing students and workers
in a tea factory in rural areas of China.
   ``The women did not drink alcoholic beverages, they did not
smoke, there was no coffee or cola in the rural area of China, they
did not use oral contraceptives, and they exercised every day,
riding their bikes to work,'' Rossignol said.
   Results of Rossignol's study were published in the American
Journal of Public Health in January.
   Rossignol emphasized that caffeine may not cause PMS, but it may
contribute to the onset of its symptoms or make them more severe.
   ``PMS is very difficult to measure because it affects women
differently,'' she said. ``There is no test for PMS. You cannot
take a blood test or see it on an X-ray. Most diagnostic procedures
require keeping a daily diary and looking at the pattern of
symptoms over time.''
   Further studies are necessary to determine if PMS has a genetic
link, and whether caffeine causes it or contributes to the severity
of the symptoms, Rossignol said.
   ``I suspect that there is a constellation of causes of PMS,''
she said.

<HEAD>No Scrap Parts Were Used in United DC-10 Engine, GE Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN NOLAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EVENDALE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No scrap parts were used in the engine
that apparently failed in last week's United Airlines DC-10 crash
in Sioux City, Iowa, the engine's maker, General Electric Co., said
Thursday.
   Dwight Weber, a spokesman at the GE plant in suburban Cincinnati
which produced the crashed jet's three CF6-6 engines, rejected a
suggestion by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., that GE used old parts in
new production engines.
   ``The parts Dingell refers to, we can categorically say, were
not used in the Flight 232 engine,'' Weber said. ``GE does not use
recycled parts in new production engines. However, repaired parts
are commonly used in overhauled engines.''
   Dingell, in a letter Wednesday asked the Federal Aviation
Administration to investigate whether scrap parts were used in the
tail engine of the United jet that crashed July 19, Iowa, killing
111 people. Dingell chairs a House Energy and Commerce subcomittee
which oversees such investigations.
   GE says the CF6-6 engine, produced from 1971 to 1981 for use
specifically on DC-10 series 10 jets such as the crashed United
jet, has established a reliable safety record during 17 million
hours of commercial flight. GE stopped making the CF6-6 engine and
started producing successor models after McDonnell Douglas sold the
last of its DC-10 series 10 jets, Weber said.
   Dingell's letter asks a response from the FAA by Aug. 4. Dingell
told reporters Thursday in Washington that he is not making
allegations against manufacturers, but wants a government
assessment of the issue.
   ``We're simply following up on an inquiry we made to the FAA
several years ago in which we asked them to look into the problems
of spare parts. We have no information, and are making no
allegations, about the behavior of any manufacturer,'' Dingell said.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigator Jack Young was
at GE's Evendale plant Thursday to examine GE's manufacturing
records for the tail-mounted No. 2 engine of Flight 232. Its fan
section disintegrated about 45 minutes into the flight from Denver
to Chicago and federal investigators want to know why, said NTSB
spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz.
   Lopatkiewicz said wreckage of the engine is to be transported,
probably next week, from the Iowa crash site to GE Evendale for a
thorough, tear-down examination under NTSB supervision.
   Lopatkiewicz said the No. 2 engine's fan section was missing
from the wreckage. He said there was debris penetration damage in
the plane's horizontal stabilizers and two of three hydraulic
systems had been severed, severely impairing steering of the jet.
   Weber also said a different generation of GE's CF6 series
engines powered a Korean Air DC-10 jet which crashed early Thursday
in heavy fog three miles short of the Tripoli, Libya, reportedly
killing about half of the 200 people on board. The Korean plane was
powered by GE's CF6-50 engines, a higher-thrust model which entered
commercial service in October 1972, Weber said.

<HEAD>Senate Defeats Effort to Delay Medicare Surtax</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Thursday voted against delaying
the new surtax on Medicare recipients as opponents of the
catastrophic care program for the elderly tried once again to roll
back major parts of it for a year.
   On a 58-40 procedural vote, the lawmakers rejected an amendment
by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., to an energy and water spending bill
that would have cut off a major source of funds for the
catastrophic care program.
   The vote is unlikely to be the last one on the issue, which has
drawn protests from many elderly Americans who have complained that
the levy is too expensive. A House committee voted this week to
halve the surtax, and a Senate panel is studying the catastrophic
care program and its costs.
   The Senate vote came on a day that Richard Darman, the White
House's budget director, indicated that the Bush administration was
willing to make a deal on rolling back the catastrophic program.
   ``We're in the process of compromising on that,'' he told
reporters at a breakfast gathering.
   Darman provided no details. The administration has opposed a
total repeal of the program.
   McCain's proposal would also have postponed other segments of
the program, including a prescription drug benefit and a ceiling it
places on doctors' bills the elderly must pay.
   ``The surtax is what has created the firestorm out there,'' said
McCain, whose state is home to many elderly citizens.
   Last month, McCain lost an effort to attach identical language
to another spending bill and was defeated by a single vote.
   His loss was by a greater margin this time, as Senate leaders of
both parties and of the Senate Finance Committee _ which has
jurisdiction over taxes and health programs _ teamed up against
him. Fifteen of the 19 members of the finance committee who voted
on the McCain amendment opposed it, including six of nine
Republicans.
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
angrily reminded McCain that the finance panel had promised to
study the program last month, a review that is still under way.
   ``To have you come in at the last minute to try to cut that
short after the extended debate we had and the decision of this
body, I frankly think it's a serious mistake,'' Bentsen said.
   Currently, the law, passed just last year, requires the 33
million people eligible for Medicare to pay a surtax of 15 percent
on the federal taxes they owe above $150. A cap of $800 was placed
on the amount any individual would owe this year.
   Only 40 percent of the elderly would be required to pay any
surtax at all, and less than 6 percent would have to pay the
maximum of $800. On Wednesday, the House Ways and Means Committee
voted to cut the surtax in half, and to make participation in the
catastrophic program voluntary if a person was willing to give up
Medicare coverage for doctors' bills.

   Dirty air spread last year with 30 million
more Americans living in areas where they breathed levels of air
pollutants the government considers harmful, the Environmental
Protection Agency said Thursday.
   The agency said the latest figures, which cover the recent
three-year period, mean that at least 101 areas will be required to
take additional air pollution control measures under new clean air
legislation that is likely to emerge from Congress this year.
   In all, about 110 million people _ better than four of every 10
Americans _ were breathing air that at least during some summer
days in 1988 had smog levels considered to be unhealthful,
according to the EPA figures. The year earlier the number was about
80 million.
   The EPA attributed the higher levels last year of ozone _ a
principal component of smog _ largely to the fact that the country
suffered through one of the hottest summers in half a century.
Ozone is created when hydrocarbons, mainly from automobiles,
combine with severe heat and dust.
   All but two of the 37 new areas where ozone levels exceeded
federal standards were east of the Mississippi where the 1988
summer was particularly severe. In 44 areas the air also had
unhealthy levels of carbon monoxide, slightly fewer than previous
years.
   Severe smog pollution can cause a variety of respiratory
ailments including impaired breathing and chest pain, while
long-term exposure can cause permanent lung tissue damage,
according to medical experts.
   While the unusually hot 1988 summer may have been largely to
blame for the surge in air pollution, EPA officials said the
statistics reinforce the need for swift action in Congress on
legislation tightening air pollution controls.
   ``This sharp increase in the number of areas not yet meeting the
ozone standard is dramatic proof of the pressing need for a new
clean air bill,'' said EPA Administrator William Reilly.
   ``The problem is immense. We must address it now,'' he said.
   The 1988 figures will be used by the EPA in determining what
action a state will require of local communities to clean up the
air under new federal air pollution laws being debated on Capitol
Hill.
   William Rosenberg, EPA's associate administrator for air, said
that while some of the targeted communities may again come into
compliance if the summer heat eases, most of the 101 geographic
regions will have to impose additional pollution controls under the
expected clean air legislation.
   President Bush in June proposed a sweeping revision of the
federal air pollution laws, including increased use of alternative
motor fuels in areas facing the most severe ozone and carbon
monoxide threat.
   Environmentalists recently accused the administration of backing
off from some of the original proposal, a claim heatedly denied
Thursday by Rosenberg who maintained that the proposed bill sent to
Congress by the president would bring all but four of the 101
georgraphic areas into compliance by the year 2000 and cost the
public millions of dollars less than competing versions.
   The administration's clean air legislation was introduced in the
House Thursday night, with the chief sponsorship of House Energy
and Commerce Committee Chairman John D. Dingell, D-Mich. and the
ranking Republican on the committee, Rep. Norman Lent of New York.
   They were joined by 145 co-sponsors, including 89 Republicans
and 56 Democrats.
   Democrats have introduced their own clean air legislation, but
Rosenberg said he is confident a compromise can be worked out.
   Under the administration proposal before Congress, the four
metropolitan areas with the most severe pollution in 1988 _ the New
York, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles areas _ would be required to
phase in automobiles using alternative fuels as well take other
pollution control measures.
   The four areas would be given 20 years to come into compliance.
Chicago was added to the four after the final 1988 ozone figures
were tabulated, while the other three have for some time been
considered to have the nation's worst air pollution.
   Another 27 cities are considered by the EPA to have ``serious''
ozone pollution. Under the president's proposal they would have 10
years to come into compliance by tightening auto emission
inspections, the use of alternative fuels in some cases, and curbs
on pollutants in some businesses such as bakeries and dry cleaners
as well as in refueling cars at gas pumps.
   These areas would be required to establish a program of
pollution control to reduce emissions by 3 percent a year until
they attain compliance with the federal standard.
   Ozone pollution in the remaining areas was described as moderate
or marginal and would require less-severe action to correct,
officials said.
   The worsening pollution for ozone in 1988 was tempered somewhat
by a net decrease in carbon monoxide pollution, although 44 areas
still exceeded those federal standards as well, the EPA said.

<HEAD>PUREX Closed Until Late September</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A key plutonium production plant at the
Hanford nuclear reservation will remain closed at least until
September, but will not hurt the nation's ability to make nuclear
weapons, officials said Thursday.
   John Fulton, manager of the chemical division for Westinghouse
Hanford Co., told The Associated Press that the Plutonium-Uranium
Extraction Plant, which closed Dec. 7, would resume operation in
late September or early October.
   Also Thursday, Hanford manager Mike Lawrence blasted a citizens'
group which contended that U.S. Department of Energy officials
tried to hide the lengthy shutdown of the plant known as PUREX.
   ``It's extremely clear that the PUREX shutdown was not done
quietly or secretively,'' Lawrence said, responding to the
Spokane-based Hanford Education Action League's complaint last week.
   PUREX is the latest major link in the nation's nuclear weapons
production chain to close, joining Hanford's N Reactor, and
facilities at the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina, the Feed
Materials Production Facility in Fernald, Ohio, and the Rocky Flat
Plant near Denver.
   The PUREX plant dissolves nuclear fuel rods from weapons
reactors to extract the plutonium and uranium. The plutonium is
further processed before it is placed in nuclear weapons.
   The nation's only other plutonium-uranium extraction facilities
are at Savannah River and are still functional, although they have
little to do because reactors there are closed for safety reasons,
said Becky McSwain, a spokeswoman for the Westinghouse Savannah
River Co.
   Westinghouse operates the two giant nuclear production complexes
for DOE.
   The PUREX closure will not hurt the nation's nuclear capability,
said Ken Morgan of DOE's Richland office.
   The exact size of the nuclear materials stockpile is secret, but
``There's a great deal of stretch in the system,'' Morgan said.
   Officials for Westinghouse Hanford Co. on Thursday produced
copies of news releases dated to the Dec. 7, 1988, closure of
PUREX, and also copies of the ``unusual occurrence'' reports filed
in DOE's public reading room in Richland concerning the closure.
   Jim Thomas, a staff researcher for HEAL, complained that only
local media organizations in the Tri-Cities were notified, and said
that at minimum news organizations from throughout the state should
have been told.
   ``The unusual occurrence reports are written in such a way that
(they) treat everything as an isolated incident,'' Thomas said.
``It's impossible to get the overall status of anything in a normal
unusual occurrence report.''
   But Bill Whiting, Westinghouse Hanford public relations officer,
said a variety of news organizations and elected officials were
advised of the closure. HEAL had not asked to be notified, he said.

   Paraplegic climber Mark
Wellman, fresh from conquering El Capitan, said Thursday he
constantly dreams of another feat _ walking again.
   ``I visualize that I'm walking a lot in dreams and there's a lot
behind that,'' said Wellman, 29, who has had only partial movement
in his legs since a climbing accident in 1982.
   ``But really, these days, what with all I've been able to do, it
doesn't matter if I'm in a wheelchair, but I'm always thinking
about walking,'' said the soft-spoken ranger. ``But I admit it's
always a dream.''
   Wellman, a Yosemite ranger who is an avid outdoorsman despite
his disability, told reporters atop the 3,200-foot face of El
Capitan on Wednesday that his feat proves disabled people can
accomplish almost anything they want.
   Wellman, who hauled himself up the monolith using only his
powerful arms, said he did the climb for personal achievement, not
for the disabled. But he said he hoped it would prove physical
disabilities need not stop the handicapped.
   ``Go out and do it!,'' said Wellman. ``If you feel you can do
it, just go out and do it.''
   Wellman was tired and sweaty when he reached the summit seven
days and four hours after he and friend Mike Corbett, 35, left the
Yosemite Valley floor. Corbett, a park medical clinic janitor who
has scaled the monolith a record-breaking 42 times, is known as
``Mr. El Cap.''
   To climb El Capitan, Wellman and Corbett used modified cave
exploration equipment that allowed Wellman to pull himself up the
face of the cliff, six inches at a time, using a T-bar device and
ropes set by Corbett and doing an estimated 7,000 pullups.
   But despite the historic nature of the climb, the pair were
almost nonchalant about their achievement.
   Wellman said there were no ``scary moments'' or even threatening
situations, although winds gusted up to 50 mph and temperatures
rose to over 100 degrees on the rock face.
   The climb mainly tested their raw strength, but Corbett said it
also tested his patience with the outside world.
   ``I felt like the whole world was watching,'' he said. ``One
morning I had to go to the bathroom, but I couldn't drop my drawers
because of all the people looking up at me through their
telescopes.''
   After the climb, Wellman took a casual ride down the back side
of the mountain on a horse, while Corbett walked and jogged out the
8.3-mile route.
   The U.S. Senate passed a resolution Wednesday commending Wellman
and Corbett. The resolution, authored by Republican Sen. Bob Dole,
whose right arm is partially paralyzed, commended them for ``their
extraordinary feat of bravery and stout-heartedness.''

<HEAD>First Evacuees Return Home, Some 20,000 Still in Temporary Shelters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CROSS LAKE, Manitoba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of this community were the
first to return home after being evacuated because of forest fires
that continued to burn Thursday in central Canada.
   Cross Lake's 3,600 residents returned on buses a week after
fires forced nearly 25,000 people from their homes in the region's
Indian communities and remote mining towns.
   ``It's a relief after a week out there sleeping on a hard cement
floor in an arena,'' said Raymond Robinson, 28, after getting off a
bus from the mining city of Thompson. He was sent there with his
wife and five children.
   ``It was really hard for her because she was almost due to have
her baby,'' Robinson said.
   Emergency authorities announced Wednesday that the fires near
Cross Lake, a community of wood bungalows nestled among trees and
lakes about 280 miles north of Winnipeg, no longer posed a danger
to the area and that evacuees could return.
   But a wall of smoke from several fires burned in the distance
Thursday and about 20,000 people, mostly from Manitoba but also
from Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west, remained in
makeshift accommodations.
   There were 227 fires burning in Manitoba, 155 in Saskatchewan
and 188 in Ontario. Some 5,200 firefighters have been working to
control the fires, which have destroyed more than 3.7 million acres
and are the worst in the region's memory.
   No deaths or major injuries have been reported.
   Officials say it has cost about $25 million to battle the fires
and that they could cost another $125 million in lost tourism,
fishing and logging.
   Manitoba Emergency Measures Minister Albert Driedger said it was
too early to say when the rest of the evacuees could return home.
   ``It'll be done very, very cautiously so that we don't start
allowing people back into their homes and then find out we have to
get them back out again,'' he said.
   Most of the affected communities are in rugged, sparsely
populated countryside 500 to 675 miles north of Winnipeg, the
provincial capital.

<HEAD>Here's Another Actor at the White House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heads turned, necks craned and the nation's
business was momentarily put on hold Thursday as the women who work
at the White House sought a glimpse of President Bush's visitor,
come to talk about the environment.
   Robert Redford walked down the hall from the Oval Office, and
the entire building was abuzz.
   Bush had invited the actor-director to the White House when he
heard Redford was in town, said Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif.
   Dornan said he brought Redford, who had campaigned last year for
Bush's Democratic presidential opponent, Michael Dukakis, to the
White House at the president's bidding.
   It all began Wednesday when Redford was at the Capitol meeting
with House Speaker Thomas Foley regarding the actor's efforts to
obtain U.S. permission to go to Cuba to work on a movie.
   Dornan, a onetime neighbor of the actor in Santa Monica, Calif.,
was asked if he would help Redford as well. He agreed.
   The congressman said he had just come from a Capitol meeting
with the man who is said to resemble Redford _ Vice President Dan
Quayle _ and now an idea came to him.
   Within minutes, he and Foley, Redford in tow, burst into the
room where Quayle was meeting with a group of members of Congress.
   Mouths dropped open around the room, as the two sandy-haired men
met. When Quayle asked what Redford was doing there, the actor
quipped, ``I'm looking for a double.''
   Quayle's press secretary, David Beckwith, said Redford also told
Quayle he was trying to get an exemption from Treasury Department
currency regulations that prevent most U.S. citizens from visiting
Cuba.
   That night, Bush saw Dornan at a dinner and said he had heard
about the encounter.
   ``He said I heard you introduced Robert Redford to Dan Quayle.
... Why don't you bring him down to the White House?'' Dornan
quoted the president as saying.
   The congressman said their 40-minute meeting focused on
environmental matters, an issue in which both Bush and Redford
share an interest. The actor has devoted much effort of a Utah
institute he founded toward mediation of environmental disputes.
   Dornan said Bush told Redford, ``You have a strong following of
people who love the environment and I do too ... Maybe there are
some things we could work together on.''
   ``Within a few minutes they were like old friends,'' although no
specific projects were agreed to, he added.
   Redford later told Dornan, ``Bush has a wonderful opportunity
here to be a hero,'' on environmental matters.
   The actor also met with Secretary of State James A. Baker III
and Treasury Secretary Nick Brady in his effort to get the
clearance to go to Cuba, and recorded narration for a wildlife
series for the Smithsonian museums, Dornan said.
   Redford won no commitments on his bid to go to Cuba, Dornan said.

<HEAD>House Passes Defense Bill; Strips Out Midgetman Money</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS grafs 8-11 bgng: ``The Senate,'' to UPDATE with Senate
narrowly turning back amendment to freeze Star Wars spending.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House approved a $295 billion defense bill
Thursday night that suspends most production of President Bush's
stealth bomber, cuts money for Star Wars and strips out all $100
million the administration sought for the Midgetman missile.
   By a vote of 261-162, the House adopted a bill changed in the
final minutes by an odd coalition of Republicans, angered by the
cut of $502 million from the $1.1 billion the administration had
requested for the MX missile, and liberal Democrats, opposed to the
planned Midgetman missile.
   The bill also includes money for the Navy's F-14D jet fighter
and the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey vertical takeoff assault
transport _ two programs Bush planned to scrap.
   ``We got a Michael Dukakis defense bill,'' Rep. Les Aspin,
D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said
shortly after the vote. ``Mike won the election. No Midgetman. No
rail MX. ... Big cuts in SDI, and slow up the B-2 bomber.''
   Dukakis, the Democratic governor of Massachusetts, suffered a
resounding defeat at the hands of Bush in the 1988 presidential
election.
   But according to Aspin, the Democratic-controlled House carried
out the losing candidate's campaign pledges in crafting their
version of the defense bill.
   ``We have pretty well shredded George Bush's strategic
programs,'' Aspin said.
   The Senate, on the other hand, narrowly turned back an amendment
that could have opened the door to deep cuts in the Star Wars
budget. The vote was 50-47 to table, and thus set aside, the
amendment.
   The measure sponsored by Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., would
have frozen $3.62 billion of the Bush administration's request for
Star Wars, adding only enough to cover 3.2 percent inflation.
   The freeze would not have affected the the $2.6 billion
earmarked for the Department of Energy in Bush's $4.9 billion
proposal for Star Wars in the new fiscal year.
   Vice President Dan Quayle hurried to the Capitol and presided
during the vote in case he was needed to break a tie.
   In the House, the final cut in the Bush budget was the $100
million the administration requested for the Midgetman.
   ``A cute thing happened after we voted to support the amendment
(for MX and Midgetman), a measure to gut the MX rail-garrison,''
said Rep. William Dickinson, R-Ala., ranking GOP member on the
House Armed Services Committee, in introducing a motion to recommit
the defense bill to committee.
   ``That's the game, OK. Take out $500 million for rail-garrison,
take out Midgetman,'' he said.
   Aspin in debate urged members not to approve a ``motion of
spite.'' But by a standing vote of 176-90 the House approved the
revision eliminating all the money for the single-warhead Midgetman
missile.
   Later, Aspin said he spoke to Cheney who had urged Dickinson not
to introduce the motion to recommit.
   Democrats generally support Midgetman, designed to move around
on heavy trucks, as a way to force the two superpowers to move
toward single-warhead missiles which would present less tempting
targets in a crisis than the 10-warhead MX and similar Soviet
missiles.
   House and Senate conferees will meet after the August recess to
craft a final defense bill, which also includes $10 billion for the
Department of Energy for a $305 billion package.
   The Senate is expected to complete its version of a military
authorization bill next week. All money authorized still must be
provided in separate appropriations bills.
   The House's military spending blueprint suspends production of
the B-2 stealth bomber, priced at about $530 million a copy, until
the Pentagon scales back its $70 billion, 132-plane program.
   The bill also requires the administration to show the B-2 is a
proven plane before production resumes.
   Bush and Cheney had lobbied hard for the costly aircraft. In the
days before House action on the authorization bill, the
administration also pleaded its case for Star Wars.
   But the House slashed $1.8 billion from the president's request
of $4.9 billion for Star Wars, officially known as the Strategic
Defense Initiative, earmarking the savings for conventional
weapons, cleanup of nuclear defense facilities and military drug
interdiction.
   Bowing to widespread political support for the programs, Rep.
William Dickinson, R-Ala., pulled two measures to the House defense
bill that would have eliminated money that was authorized by the
House Armed Services Committee and scuttle the F-14D and the V-22.
   ``There was no need to ask the guys to walk the plank out of
support of the administration,'' Dickinson said of his decision to
withdraw the amendment to eliminate the Marine Corps' V-22, the
tilt-rotor assault transport that takes off like a helicopter but
can fly like a plane.
   The aircraft had the strong support of members from Pennsylvania
and Texas, where the Osprey is built, as well as former Marines in
Congress.
   The Alabama Republican said his GOP colleagues from New York
pressed him to withdraw the F-14D amendment and an unofficial count
made the outcome obvious. When he announced the withdrawal, there
was scattered applause on the House floor.
   The eventual fate of the F-14D will not be decided until the
House and Senate meet in conference on their versions of the
defense bill.
   Earlier this month, the Senate Armed Services Committee accepted
the Bush administration's proposal to eliminate the program.
   The House Armed Services Committee, however, rejected the
administration's plan to halt production of new F-14Ds, and
authorized $1 billion for the program in its military blueprint for
the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in slashing $10 billion from the
defense budget, had proposed eliminated the program. He contended
other jet fighters would suffice.
   Earlier in the day, the House approved a non-binding resolution
calling on Bush to begin negotiations with the Soviet Union on a
ban of production of plutonium and enriched uranium, materials used
in nuclear weapons.
   The House approved the amendment 284-138. The United States
currently has no operating nuclear enrichment production plants
while the Soviets have between 12 and 14.
   In other action the House:
   _Approved an amendment limiting total outlays for defense in
fiscal 1990 to $299.2 billion.
   _Approved an amendment sponsored by Rep. Bill Richardson,
D-N.M., prohibiting the Los Alamos National Laboratory from burning
radioactive wastes until New Mexico issues regulations on such
incineration.
   _Adopted a non-binding resolution urging Bush to press the
Soviets on dismantling their ground-based, anti-satellite weapons
and to negotiate a treay with the Soviets on imposing strict
limitations on ASAT weapons.
   _Voted to prohibit use of fiscal 1990 funds for Army production
of binary chemical weapons.
   _Extended through fiscal 1993 the goal of having 5 percent of
Pentagon contracts awared to small and disadvantaged businesses.
   _Adopted a non-binding resolution urging Bush to step up
negotations with the Soviets on an agreement to stop production and
stockpiling of lethal chemical weapons.

   Congressional negotiators reached agreement on
a savings and loan bailout bill Thursday night and the
Democratic-controlled House completed major surgery on President
Bush's plans for Star Wars and new missiles as lawmakers rushed to
wrap up their work for the summer.
   A House committee also sent an flag protection bill to the floor
for a vote, and a Senate panel postponed a decision on William
Lucas' controversial nomination to head the Justice Department
civil rights division.
   Both houses met late, trying to make their unofficial Aug. 4
adjournment date.
   Vice President Quayle arrived at the Capitol during the evening,
and watched from the presiding officer's chair as the Senate
narrowly rejected a $1 billion cut in the administration's Star
Wars program.
   The vote in the House was 261-162 to approve a $295 billion
defense blueprint that differed dramatically from the one Bush
submitted.
   The measure curtails production of the so-called stealth bomber,
cuts $1.8 billion from the administration's request for Star Wars
and strips out all $100 million the administration sought for the
Midgetman missile.
   Two planes that President Bush planned to scrap _ the Navy's
F-14D Tomcat jet fighter and the Marine Corps V-22 Osprey vertical
takeoff assault transport _ survived in the House as lawmakers
bowed to widespread political support for the programs.
   ``We got a Michael Dukakis defense bill,'' Rep. Les Aspin,
D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said,
referring to last fall's defeated Democratic presidential
candidate. ``Mike won the election. No Midgetman. No rail MX. ...
Big cuts in SDI, and slow up the B-2 bomber.''
   The final obstacle in the way of the S&amp;L bailout agreement was
cleared when negotiators decided the multibillion-dollar cost of
the effort should be included in calculations of thje budget
deficit.
   But the Bush administration raised an immediate objection, and
some senators cautioned the agreement could be rejected when it
reaches the full Senate next week.
   The bill provides $166 billion over 10 years to close and rescue
hundreds of failed savings institutions and provide sweeping
reforms requiring S&amp;L owners to risk more of their own money and
concentrate on home lending.
   In the Senate, meanwhile, lawmakers approved the first
construction funds for the super collider atom smasher in Texas, a
$4.4 billion project that scientists hope will unravel nature's
secrets. The money was contained in a $18.4 billion money for
energy and water projects for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
   That bill, adopted by voice vote, was the second appropriations
measure to clear the Senate during the day. The other provided
$44.3 billion for farm programs, including $18.8 billion for
domestic food assistance programs such as child nutrition programs,
WIC and food stamps.
   Lawmakers also wrangled over how best to protect the American
flag in the wake of a Supreme Court decision affording First
Amendment protection to desecration of Old Glory. Republicans want
a constitutional amendment, but majority Democrats don't.
   The panel voted 28-6 for a statute that says, ``Whoever
knowingly mutilates, defaces, burns or tramples upon any flag of
the United States shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for
not more than one year, or both.''
   All but one of the 13 Republicans voting supported the bill _ as
a symbolic gesture for the flag, one said. But the Republican
leadership blocked the Democrats' plan to bring the bill before the
full House next week.
   Lucas denied a new, unverified charge about his commitment to
civil rights as the Senate Judiciary Committee postponed a vote on
his controversial nomination to a key Justice Department post.
   Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., who holds a pivotal vote, requested
the committee delay its decison so he could look into unidentified
last-minute information. ``I don't want to injure anybody _ the
allegations are not substantiated,'' he emphasized.
   Congressional sources circulated a letter from attorney Michael
Sussman of Yonkers, N.Y., saying Lucas had telephoned the Justice
Department to urge it to drop a 1980 lawsuit against the City of
Birmingham, Mich., charging Fair Housing Act violations.
   David Runkel, a spokesman for Attorney General Dick Thornburgh,
issued a denial from Lucas and described the allegation as
``reprehensible'' and a ``last-minute tactic'' designed to kill the
nomination.
   The Senate also voted 58-40 against delaying the new Medicare
surtax on the elderly designed to pay for much of the catastrophic

   Many elderly people have complained that the surtax, which would

   _Several lawmakers introduced legislation that would require
nutritional labeling on all processed food sold in this country.
   ``For far too long, we Americans have been shopping in the

advocating a proposed Nutrition Labeling and Education Act.
   _Senators said that a national service bill blending several
Democratic proposals should be on its way to the floor next week.

   A plan to print ``The Friendship State'' on
Texas license plates has stirred up gubernatorial candidates, who
say Texans are too tough for such a slogan.
   ``It's wimpy,'' said Democratic state Treasurer Ann Richards,
the first of the gubernatorial hopefuls to join the chorus of
opponents to the slogan approved last week by the state Highway and
Public Transportation Commission.
   Friendship is too generic a term for Texas, where the tough
``Don't Mess With Texas'' anti-littering slogan has proven so
popular, Ms. Richards said.
   ``I think the reason the `Don't Mess With Texas' thing has been
so successful is that it sort of continues that image that we're
great, we're wonderful, we think we are,'' she said. ``The friendly
state _ you could put that on Kansas, Ohio.''

   The nation's skies became more polluted in
1988, with up to 30 million more Americans now living in
communities with unhealthy air, the Environmental Protection Agency
said today.
   New EPA data shows that 101 geographical areas now violate
standards for ozone, the chief ingredient of smog, and 44 have
unhealthy carbon monoxide levels.
   In addition to identifying polluted areas under current law, the
data has major implications for the future if Congress approves new
clean air legislation this session.
   Any new law would be expected to use the information to
establish new deadlines for pollution cleanup, and could determine
the severity of measures each area must adopt in order to make
steady progress.

   The Antarctic ``ozone hole'' apparently caused
record low ozone levels over southern Australia in 1987, said
scientists, who suggested that the hole may raise skin cancer risk
in the globe's southern latitudes.
   The work is the first detailed study that links the Antarctic
hole to observed ozone declines in the Southern Hemisphere's
midlatitudes, where many people live, scientists said.
   The study concludes that record low ozone levels over southern
Australia and New Zealand were caused mainly by the arrival of
ozone-poor air from the Antarctic hole.
   Southern South America and the southern tip of Africa also may
be vulnerable, said study co-author R. Alan Plumb.

   Satur Ocampo, 50, a former journalist, and Carolina Malay, 49,
were arrested about 10 a.m. as they drove along a residential
street in suburban Makati, the military said.
   Fifteen other suspected rebels were arrested in raids on 23
guerrilla hideouts throughout the capital, according to Brig. Gen.
Alexander Aguirre, Manila area commander.
   Ocampo, who escaped from prison in 1985, is believed to be a

<HEAD>The French and Food _ a Long Love Affair</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto Planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Catch a Frenchman in an unguarded moment _ on a
park bench, at his desk staring out the window, or waiting for a
bus _ and likely as not he'll be thinking about food.
   Food, the creation of dishes, the art of cooking, the physical
pleasure of eating and the ritual that surrounds it are perhaps the
most important elements of French culture.
   One of the year's highlights is the annual publication of the
Michelin red guide, which awards one to three stars to restaurants
especially deserving of gustatory attention. The 19 three-star
eateries in France are objects of veneration for many.
   Top chefs, critics and food historians agree that France's
excellence in the culinary art is largely due to geographical
accident.
   ``All of the agriculture of temperate countries is represented
here,'' says Bernard Naegellen, director of the Michelin red guide.
``And I think it's that, the great variety of agricultural
products, meat, game ... that has given the French the habit of
eating well.''
   Emile Jung, the Strasbourg chef whose restaurant Le Crocodile is
the latest to achieve three-stardom, also attributes quality to
France's ``geographic situation'' and stresses local produce.
   ``Look at the variety of meats butchers here can furnish, the
variety of fish,'' he says. ``We have virtually everything in
France. Each province has its own gastronomic history and
specialty. This diversity makes for variations in cooking, in the
way foods taste.''
   In the 14th and 15th centuries, French diners were less
interested in the quality of the meal as in the abundance. A feast
usually meant tables running over with meat, fish and fowl, but
little else.
   Printed cookbooks came out in the 17th century with the works of
Francois de la Varenne and Nicholas de Bonnefons. In the 18th
century, during the reigns of Louis XIV and Louis XV, the craft of
cooking became more refined and quality supplanted quantity.
   The average Frenchmen enjoyed little of this. Haute cuisine was
a matter for the noble houses. It was not until the Revolution in
1789, when many aristocratic heads rolled and many first-class
cooks found themselves out of work, that the ``restaurant'' became
widespread, opened by newly unemployed chefs for a different class
of diner.
   The notion of gastronomy, or the devotion of large amounts of
time and effort to the preparation and consumption of food, gained
a wider clientele in the 19th century. It was then that
Marc-Antoine Careme, one of the giants of the kitchen, codified the
total of French culinary knowledge in 12 volumes much studied by
posterity.
   France's worldwide reputation is in fact a fairly recent affair
_ mainly since World War I.
   ``Of course there was Escoffier who went to London at the end of
the last century,'' said Michelin's Naegellen, referring to Auguste
Escoffier, the French chef who became well known in Europe. ``But
French cooking began to be known abroad at the beginning of the
20th century.''
   It is almost impossible, however, to define what French cooking
really is. That is because French cooking is very regional and
diverse.
   ``The local produce inspires ideas in the kitchen, makes it
possible to compose interesting cuisine,'' says three-star chef
Jung of Strasbourg. ``In the history of each province the nobility
marshaled the resources of the countryside. This availability of
food gave ideas to the people living there. There is a heritage of
food, of taste, that is unique to France.''
   ``I think the genius of French cooking resides in the wine,''
Jung adds. ``Simmered dishes are nearly all based on the use of
wine _ boeuf bourguignon, coq au vin.''
   There's also fearless experimentation. Imagine the first person
to ever consider popping a slippery snail into his mouth for a
grisly chew _ with or without butter and garlic _ or testing the
culinary possibilities of the humble frog.
   ``The problem for great chefs today is finding products with
taste,'' says Naegellen. ``Fresh food is not a problem. All food
today is fresh. But to find food with taste ...''
   Any good chef will tell you that selection of the products is
every bit as important, if not more so, than the preparation.
   ``What is disappearing now are the restaurants of medium
quality,'' says Naegellen. ``Twenty years ago, there were
restaurants that didn't change their menus much but made good
things every day to please their customers. All year, they made the
same thing, and for a reasonable price. Now, they all want to make
money.''
   Even so, when a Frenchman complains of having been served a poor
meal, many a foreigner might ask, compared to what?

<HEAD>Gender-Related Roles Can Cause Marriage Distress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anna and Bob were bright, capable, well-meaning
and working to keep a marriage. But there was a problem: She was a
woman, and he was a man.
   That means they had to contend with basic and often overlooked
differences in the way women and men tend to think and behave. It
drove them into therapy.
   Researchers and therapists have been taking a closer look at
what they say are common differences between the genders. Unless
those disparities are heeded and accounted for, they say, the
result can be trouble for a marriage.
   ``I think everybody has known that there are some basic gender
differences in marriage,'' but scientific study began only
recently, said marital researcher Howard Markman of the University
of Denver.
   ``These are patterns that are very strong, that most people
simply aren't aware of,'' said Froma Walsh, an associate professor
of social work and psychiatry at the University of Chicago.
   Common gender-related differences include how readily feelings
are expressed, how intimacy is sought and how conflicts are
negotiated, Markman and Walsh said. In a marriage, the patterns can
make arguments erupt out of nowhere and sabotage attempts to
resolve conflicts.
   Take Anna and Bob. They often fought with unsatisfying results.
Anna blamed Bob for trying to control her and blamed herself for
consistently giving in. Bob considered Anna wishy-washy.
   Walsh said that as she counseled them, it became clear that Bob
argued to win. In contrast, Anna said, ``I really go in wanting to
please him and wanting his approval.''
   Walsh told the couple, ``It looks like you have different
rules.''
   ``As soon as they realized that, it got them out of blaming each
other,'' Walsh said in an interview. ``No wonder things always turn
out his way.''
   The couple reflects a typical pattern in marriages, Walsh said.
Men learn from society to be powerful in their arguments and to win
as much as they can. Women learn to take more interest in gaining
love and approval, which prods them toward accommodation in
conflicts.
   Markman said men commonly focus on the outcome of the
discussion, while women often care more about the process, such as
wanting to express feelings before moving to solutions.
   Another pattern therapists and researchers see is that while
wives are more likely than husbands to bring up domestic matters
for discussion, men typically try to withdraw from conflict with
their wives.
   Men do not always realize they are withdrawing, Markman said.
Sometimes they say they do not even hear their wives.
   The question of why men tend to withdraw is controversial,
Markman said.
   Walsh attributes it to men's discomfort with intimate
discussions and communication of feelings _ a result of a working
world that emphasizes competitiveness and hiding one's
vulnerabilities.
   Markman suggests another explanation: As boys, husbands may have
learned to resolve conflicts through explicit rules and umpires in
their sports, while their adult marriages typically offer little
such structure.
   Another factor several researchers have suggested is biology.
The idea is that conflict between spouses may be physically harder
on husbands because it pushes them into an uncomfortable state of
physical arousal, including faster heart beat and a flow of
adrenaline.
   Once aroused, men may also take longer to return to normal, said
marital researcher John Gottman of the University of Washington.
   One study found that husbands showed higher skin conductance _ a
measure of physical arousal _ when listening to their wives
complain than women did as husbands complained.
   Gottman cautioned that such differences may actually stem from
cultural factors rather than biology.
   Whatever the reason, the husband's withdrawal spurs the wife to
press the issue, which triggers further withdrawal, further
pressing, and so on, Walsh said.
   Markman and colleague Shelley Kraft see a withdrawal-and-pursuit
pattern behind ``negative escalation cycles,'' which are
essentially the way arguments grow out of small things and get
hotter and hotter.
   The cycles are characteristic of unhappy marriages, while
couples in happy marriages generally know how to avoid them,
Markman said.
   A cycle may begin when a wife approaches her husband, who is
reading a newspaper.
   ``We really need to talk,'' Judy says. Harry doesn't answer.
   ``Harry, I said we really need to talk,'' she says more
emphatically.
   ``Oh,'' Harry says innocently, looking up. ``Were you talking to
me?''
   ``You never listen to me, you never want to talk.''
   ``That is not true. I love to talk, but we never talk, we just
fight.''
   ``There you go again, changing the subject on me. I really can't
stand this much longer.''
   Harry switches his glare back to the newspaper. Judy goes to
tend the children in another room.
   What happened here?
   In the researchers' view, Judy asking to talk was an attempt to
establish some intimacy. Perhaps she sounded negative because she
was tired, and anxious as she recalled Harry's rejections of
intimate discussions.
   Harry thought Juday had another gripe and, thinking that such
discussions never go anywhere except to an emotional eruption, he
decided to try to avoid her. When that didn't work, he played dumb.
   His tactics made Judy more negative, and the cycle was off and
running. His mistaken expectation that she wanted an argument
became self-fulfilling.
   The exchange also illustrates another gender difference Markman
and Kraft see, in how each experiences intimacy. Women, the
researchers suggest, place great stock in face-to-face talk about
feelings _ just the kind from which men may withdraw. Males may
prefer to find intimacy in shared activities.
   The result can be misunderstanding. Markman and Kraft cited the
case of one man who said he felt close to his wife when they
watched television together. The wife, however, complained that all
he wanted to do was watch television, and that he didn't want to
talk to her.
   Recognizing and countering gender-based patterns may help ease
the distress they provoke in marriages. Much of good couples
therapy is helping the partners become more aware of hidden
patterns, which lets them break such cycles and negotiate more
satisfying rules, Walsh said.
   To provide men with structure for handling conflict, Markman
said, a ``Premarital Relationship Enhancement Program'' is
available in many places around the country to teach ground rules
for arguing. Couples who go through the training before marrying
show happier marriages and only half the divorces that other
couples do, he said.
   ``There's a bumpy road through marriage but it can be ridden,''
Markman said. ``We've kind of mapped out scientifically at least
the terrain of marital difficulties, and now we've provided some
roadmaps.''

<HEAD>Orbiting Armada to Explore Cosmos</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Hubble Space Telescope to be launched next year
is the flagship of an orbiting armada that will explore the flash
from the creation of the universe and send back news that could
change mankind's view of the cosmos.
   It will also search for signs of extraterrestrial, even
intelligent, life.
   ``It is rare that how we think of the universe changes in a
single lifetime, but that's what's about to happen,'' said Dr.
Charles J. Pellerin Jr., director of the Astrophysics Division at
NASA headquarters in Washington.
   In the next two years, the United States will launch six
astronomical observers to explore different sections of the
electro-magnetic spectrum from gamma to radio. Data will be
analyzed by teams of scientists around the globe.
   ``There will be whole sets of new things we'll see out there and
be dazzled by,'' Pellerin said during the Paris Air Show, adding
that the Hubble will answer many longstanding astrophysical
questions and raise new ones.
   In November, NASA will launch the Cosmic Background Explorer,
Cobe, to look further back in intergalactic time than humanity ever
has. Using six different instruments, Cobe will measure background
light rather than points like stars.
   Many astronomers believe the universe started from one timeless
point, a darkness transformed by a ``Big Bang'' into an expanding
sphere of energy and matter that spread to occupy the emptiness of
space.
   Cobe will ``measure the flash at the background of the creation
of the universe, the residual flash of the Big Bang,'' Pellerin
said. ``We will be trying to understand whether the universe is
still expanding, something for consideration by scientists and,
perhaps, theologians.''
   In February, the Rosat mission, a cooperative venture with West
Germany, will be launched to conduct a detailed survey of X-rays
emitted in the universe by violent explosions, such as those
occurring at the end of a star's life.
   The Hubble is to be carried into orbit in March by space shuttle
Discovery, and a month later a group of instruments called Astro
will be launched to measure ultraviolet rays and study supernovas.
   By the end of 1990, a gamma ray observatory will be launched and
finally, in 1991, an ultraviolet explorer will begin to study
quasars, the mysterious star-like points of light that emit more
energy than major galaxies.
   The a full-scale, cutaway mockup of the Hubble was the
centerpiece of the National Aeronautics and Space Administrations
exhibit at the Paris Air Show in June. At 43{ feet long, 14 feet in
diameter and weighing 25,500 pounds, it not only is the largest
telescope ever built but also the most precise.
   Drawings make the Hubble look like a giant eye floating above
the Earth attached to two wings _ large solar panels that will
unfurl in space and supply the telescope with a minimum of 2,400
watts of power.
   In addition to a telescope, Hubble will contain five
instruments: a wide-field planetary camera, a faint-object
spectrograph, a high-resolution spectrograph, a high-speed
photometer and a faint-object camera.
   Data will be transmitted to Earth and reconstructed for study by
a select group of scientists that will change each year.
   The Hubble, orbiting 373 miles above Earth and outside the
atmosphere, will produce images of unprecedented clarity. Looking
out through Earths' atmosphere is like looking up from the bottom
of a pond at a light, astronomers say.
   They can use the telescope to examine the clouds of Venus, the
deep valleys of Mars and make other planetary observations that
will be useful in studying the possibilities for exploiting
resources throughout the solar system.
   ``Queen Isabella sent out an armada of ships to explore the
world and nothing was ever the same again,'' Pellerin said.
``America is sending out a similar armada, leading the exploration
of the universe.
   ``We are about to be amazed.''

<DATELINE>LARA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists struggling to save
endangered green and loggerhead turtles have turned a sandy strip
on Cyprus' western coast into a conservation zone protected from
the annual invasion of a million tourists.
   ``Volunteers from Greece, England, Italy, the United States,
Cyprus and other countries patrol the beach during the hatching
season'' from June through August when most tourists arrive, said
Andreas Demetropoulos, director of the government's fisheries
department and a driving force behind the project.
   Up to 4,000 young turtles are hatched and released into the
Mediterranean every year, thanks to the project that was started 11
years ago at one of the turtles' main breeding grounds,
Demetropoulos said. But he noted: ``What's the good if we put 4,000
turtles into the sea while other countries catch them?''
   The Lara team and environmental specialists from 12
Mediterranean nations met in Nicosia in early July to work out a
campaign to protect the species.
   They focused on the need to ban fishing and tourism during the
spawning season, reduce or ban construction of hotels, bars and
other attractions near breeding grounds, and outlaw the sale of
turtle flesh or shells.
   The plan will be presented to the Barcelona Convention for the
Protection of the Mediterranean Sea at its next session in Greece
in October.
   ``During the early days of the conservation project there was an
estimated population of about 100 green turtles,'' said Myroula
Hadjichristoforou, one of the project's directors. The loggerhead
population was ``around 200.''
   The current number is not known, but the team believes it is
doing much to build up the species, although it will take years
before they can confirm it.
   ``The unborn turtles face many hazards such as tourists
trampling over the unmarked nests or wild animals who dig up the
eggs and eat them,'' said Demetropoulos, who is also chairman of
the Cyprus Wildlife Society.
   The female turtles lay eggs every two or three years. Heading
instinctively for the night-time phosphorescence from waves, they
crawl out of the sea, dig holes 1{ to 3 feet deep and bury the
eggs. They lay as many as 100 eggs at a time every two weeks during
the season. The eggs take about eight weeks to hatch. The
thumb-sized babies emerge at night and make for the surf.
   Environmentalists say that if tourist facilities are allowed on
the breeding beaches, the baby turtles can be lured by the lights
from hotels or camp fires, go the wrong way and perish.
   Crows, hawks and foxes that prowl most beaches during the
breeding season add to the hazards the hatchlings face even before
they are born. The Lara volunteers cover known nests with wire mesh
to keep out the foxes.
   The project also keeps about 100 turtles, ranging from 1 to 9
years old, in sea cages in the harbor at Paphos so they can grow
before they are released, giving them a better chance of survival
from sea predators.
   Cyprus plans to hold a training course this year for
environmentalists from Mediterranean countries to widen the efforts
to save the turtles.
   Already the Turkish government has allocated beaches in the
Dalyan Iztuzu area on the Agaean coast as a protected nesting area
for loggerhead turtles. It also has promised to establish a reserve
for green turtles near the Mediterranean port of Antalya.
   In Greece, environmentalists launched a similar protection
project two years ago at Laganas bay in the western resort island
of Zakinthos. Laganas is a major loggerhead nesting area in the
Mediterranean.

<HEAD>Smiles May Be More Than Just Skin Deep</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laughter may not be the best medicine,
but putting on a smile can have a mood-mellowing effect that's more
than skin deep.
   Changes in the muscles of the face can indirectly raise or lower
the temperature of the blood to the brain, affecting the release of
mood-altering chemicals, said University of Michigan psychologist
Robert Zajonc.
   The muscle changes alter the temperature of blood in the
cavernous sinus, a vein that wraps around a nasal artery carrying
blood to the brain, said Zajonc, whose research was published in
the July issue of Psychological Review.
   ``I do not claim that temperature change is the only way of
inducing emotional state. But the theory helps explain a number of
curious phenomena. For example, it might explain why placebo pills
are so frequently effective.''
   People who take placebos may momentarily change their breathing
patterns and facial expressions, indirectly changing the
temperature in regions of the brain that release pain-reducing
chemicals called endorphins, he said.
   In experiments on facial movement unrelated to emotions, Zajonc
asked 26 people to pronounce and comment on vowel sounds. The
subjects preferred ``ah'' and ``ee'' sounds, which prompted a
decrease in temperature.
   The theory that facial expressions may influence emotions first
was raised in 1907 by French physician Israel Waynbaum, who
believed that the muscles' pressure on arteries partly controlled
how much blood reached the brain.

<HEAD>Low-Mileage, Single-Owner Buggies _ Drive Away for Right Price</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Don't expect to see a salesman in a
plaid polyester spacesuit, but travelers moon will find three
low-mileage, single-owner used cars when they get to the moon. They
may need a jump-start, however.
   The $10 million buggies used by astronauts to explore the moon
were left behind after the Apollo 15, 16 and 17 missions in 1971
and 1972.
   ``It's been almost 20 years so we would probably expect the
batteries to have run down, but otherwise they might be in pretty
good shape,'' said Gene Cowart, chief engineer on the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's $40 million Lunar Roving
Vehicle project in the late 1960s.
   After President Bush's recent call for renewed space
exploration, Cowart, a Boeing Co. engineer, began thinking about
the usefulness of what NASA has left on the moon. ``Basically, it's
just the vehicles, a few cameras and the bottom half of Lunar
Excursion Modules left behind when the astronauts blasted back off
to rendezvous with their command shop and come home.''
   With the aluminum-frame rovers, astronauts who might otherwise
have been limited to exploring within a half-mile of their LEMs
could roam miles across the lunar surface. The three vehicles that
were used were designed to go up to 50 miles on their initial
batteries, but none went farther than 22 miles.
   The fourth rover is on display at the Smithsonian Institution.

<HEAD>Illicit `Ecstasy' Drug May Damage Brain Cells, Study Suggests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chronic users of an illicit drug dubbed
``Ecstasy'' showed a spinal fluid abnormality in a new study that
suggests the drug may damage brain cells.
   The work follows ``ample evidence'' that Ecstasy causes
long-term brain cell damage in rats and monkeys, said researcher
George Ricaurte. But it is too preliminary to prove whether the
drug causes such damage in humans, he said.
   Ricaurte, of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore,
presented the study recently at a meeting sponsored by the New York
Academy of Sciences.
   Ecstasy is formally known as MDMA, or
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine. Users report a variety of
pleasurable reactions, such as losing defensive anxiety and feeling
more open emotionally.
   In rats and monkeys, MDMA damages nerve cell fibers that contain
serotonin, a substance some brain cells use to communicate.
   Ricaurte presented a study of squirrel monkeys in which MDMA
treatment destroyed 90 percent of serotonin-containing nerve fibers
in the forebrain. The monkeys also showed abnormally low levels in
the spinal fluid of a substance that is a breakdown product of
serotonin.
   So Ricaurte studied the spinal fluid from 34 long-time human
users of MDMA to look for abnormally low levels of the breakdown
product, called 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid or 5-HIAA.
   The users had taken MDMA for an average of about five years,
twice a month on average. They had not taken any within two weeks
of the spinal fluid test.
   On average, the users showed about 25 percent less 5-HIAA in
their spinal fluid than was found in a group of 24 non-users
studied for comparison.
   Ricaurte cautioned that the study did not account for several
factors that can affect 5-HIAA levels in the spinal fluid, such as
diet and activity.
   Without that precaution, he said it would be premature to draw
any conclusions about MDMA's long-term effect in humans. Current
studies are accounting for factors that affect 5-HIAA
concentrations, he said.
   He also said he and colleagues have just begun to look for
long-term changes in behavior or thinking due to MDMA, and have not
identified any. It may take detailed testing to uncover any effect,
he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Drops Sharply, Share Prices Rebound</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with morning Nikkei, comments.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar dropped sharply against the
Japanese yen in early trading Thursday, while prices on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange rebounded.
   The dollar ended the morning session of trading at 139.15 yen.
It had opened at 139.35 yen, down a sharp 2.08 yen from Wednesday's
close of 141.43 yen, and moved even lower while ranging from 138.97
to 139.67 yen.
   The dollar closed at 140.05 yen in New York overnight, down from
Tuesday's close of 141.60 yen.
   The dollar's drop in New York was attributed to signs that the
U.S. Federal Reserve was loosening credit over speculation about
the country's sluggish economic growth.
   On Tuesday, the Fed cut the federal funds rate to 8.5 percent
from more than 9 percent. The federal funds rate is the interest on
overnight loans between banks, and influences other interest rates
throughout the economy.
   Traders said the market's general sentiment toward the dollar
was bearish, as market players predicted a poor performance in the
second quarter U.S. gross national product, showing slow economic
growth. Figures on the GNP are to be released later Thursday in
Washington.
   A commercial bank trader, speaking anonymously, said Japanese
investors are no longer inclined to sell the yen over domestic
political uncertainty.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues regained 167.42
points, or 0.49 percent, ending the morning session at 34,683.25,
yet another high. The index had lost 23.07 points Wednesday.
   The index rose following overnight gains in the Dow Jones
industrial average of 30 major issues in New York.
   Nomura Securities analyst Yoshiro Inoue said the yen's strength
against the dollar reassured stock investors and prompted buying.
   ``Another thing prompted participants' buying interest was that
today's the first trading day for the August account,'' Inoue added.
   ``Market expectations for lower interest rates worldwide,
especially in the United States, also encouraged investors to buy
stocks,'' he said.

   Crude oil futures prices slipped to a 5{-month low on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, while on other markets, precious metals
advanced, grains and soybeans were mixed and livestock and meat
futures were mixed.

<HEAD>Amex Profit Rises In Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Express Co. says its second-quarter
profit rose 22 percent over a year ago, with all divisions of the
travel and financial services giant reporting sharply higher income.
   The company said Wednesday the strongest results came from the
Travel Related Services division, which includes the credit card
and travelers check businesses, and from IDS Financial Services.
   For the three months ended June 30, net income from continuing
operations totaled $316 milion, or 73 cents a share, compared with
earnings of $260 million, or 61 cents per share, last year.
   Revenue rose 26 percent to $6.4 billion from $5.0 billion.
   Last year's second-quarter earnings were lowered by $12 million
to delete the earnings from the Fireman's Fund Corp., which
American Express now treats as a discontinued operation. The
figures also reflect new accounting rules.
   For the first six months of this year, American Express said it
netted $568 million, or $1.32 a share, on revenue of $12.22
billion. That compared with earnings of $502 million, or $1.18 a
share, and $9.86 billion in revenue in 1988.
   The Travel Related Services unit, which is the largest operation
of American Express, posted record net income of $214 million in
the second quarter, up 17 percent from $183 million a year ago.
Revenue rose 24 percent to $2.0 billion.
   The 1988 results were restated to exclude the business of
American Express Information Services Co., which is reporting
separately. That unit had net income of $17 million, up 30 percent
from 1988.
   IDS earned a record $43 million, up 18 percent from last year.
Revenue totaled $463 million, an increase over $379 million in 1988.
   American Express Bank had earnings of $35 million, up 9.9
percent from 1988.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc., which reported its
second-quarter results Tuesday, earned $55 million, up 43 percent
from $39 million last year. Shearson is a majority-owned subsidiary
of American Express.

   Mortgage rates have fallen to their lowest
level in more than two years with fixed-rate mortgages dropping to
a national average of 9.73 percent in July, the Federal National
Mortgage Association said.
   Fannie Mae said Wednesday that the new average for 30-year,
fixed-rate mortgages compared to a national average of 9.98 percent
in June. It was the lowest level since fixed-rate mortgages
averaged 9.25 percent in March 1987.
   The rates for one-year adjustable mortgages also declined to
8.66 percent in July, down from 8.96 percent in June.
   Because of the declining rates, homebuyers have flocked to
fixed-rate mortgages, which are now more affordable. In July, the
percentage of adjustable rate mortgages applications fell to 25
percent, down from a peak of 62 percent in January.

<HEAD>OPEC Nations Produced More Oil in June Than Allowed in Accord</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC nations supplied more crude to the
world market in June than permitted under a production agreement
designed to boost oil prices, the organization said.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said 12 of its
13 member nations sold 17.87 million barrels a day of oil last
month, which was 362,000 barrels above the ceiling in place at the
time.
   The cartel said in a statement Wednesday carried by its news
agency, OPECNA, that June figures were not available for the United
Arab Emirates.
   The emirates, a persistent cheater on production accords, had a
supply quota of 988,000 barrels a day last month. It was raised in
the new agreement to 1 million barrels.
   A new accord went into effect July 1, lifting the production cap
for all 13 nations to 19.5 million barrels a day in the last half
of the year. It had been 18.5 million barrels in the January to
June period.
   Bryan Jacoboski, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc. in New York,
estimated OPEC production in July was running close to 21 million
barrels a day.
   He said the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait were producing more
than their share, and that Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 1 crude
exporter, was a bit above its supply cap.
   The new output accord, fashioned at a June meeting of oil
ministers, was designed to keep a firm grip on production so that
prices would remain robust. It left the target price at $18 a
barrel.
   But prices began tumbling last week, partly reflecting a
weakness in demand for gasoline.
   Other factors, including the ending of the coal strike in the
Soviet Union, have also contributed to the decline, analysts say.
The resolution of the miners' walkout eased fears the unrest could
spread to the oil sector.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the September futures
contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark American crude,
was trading at $18.30 a barrel. Oil prices had been in the
$20-range just over a week ago.
   Oil supplied by the OPEC nations is generally priced several
dollars below the American brand.
   To meet the July-December ceiling, some OPEC nations would have
to slash their production. Analysts estimated output had picked up
in early June to about 21 million barrels a day.
   The International Energy Agency estimated in its Monthly Oil
Market Report that OPEC production in June was 21.3 million barrels
a day, the highest level so far this year. The report was released
in early July.
   The energy agency, which is part of the Western nations'
Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, predicted
demand for OPEC oil would be about 20.9 million barrels a day in
the second half of the year.

<HEAD>Bureau Says $14 Billion Spent on Child Care by Families with Working
Moms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Families with working mothers are spending $14
billion a year on child care, an expense that costs women in
poverty more than one-fifth of their income, the Census Bureau says.
   Of the 5.8 million women who reported making regular payments
for child care, the average weekly cost was $45.20, the bureau said
Wednesday. That amounted to about 6 percent of their income in 1986
when the study was conducted.
   While women living in poverty reported spending $32 a week for
child care, that amounted to 22 percent of their incomes, according
to the report.
   Women with incomes over $3,750 a month paid $58 a week for care,
4 percent of their income.
   The bureau's figures are to be published later this year as part
of a detailed analysis of child care arrangements across the
country. Preliminary material was released Wednesday for use by
congressional subcommittees debating legislation aimed at helping
families which need child care.
   Testimony presented to Congress has estimated child care costs
as ranging from about $2,500 annually to $6,000 in large cities.
The $45.20 weekly average calculated in the study would amount to
$2,305 per year.
   Overall, the Census Bureau found, there were 20 million children
between 5 and 14 and another 9 million under age 5 with working
mothers.
   Of the younger group the largest share, 41 percent, received
care in someone else's home _ 23 percent by a non-relative, 11
percent by a grandparent and the rest by another relative.
   In addition, nearly 30 percent were cared for at their own home
by someone who came in. There were 15 percent in day care centers,
6 percent in nursery school, 1 percent in kindergarten and about 7
percent cared for by the mother at work.
   For the group aged 5 to 14, nearly 70 percent attended school
while mother worked. About 14 percent were cared for by someone who
came to their home, 5 percent went to someone else's home; 5
percent were taking care of themselves, 3 percent went to work with
mother and the rest had other group care arrangements.
   While the care arrangements for the under-5 group was relatively
consistent all year, for the 5-to-14 children things were a lot
different in summer when school was out.
   In summer the 70 percent attending school dropped to 22 percent.
Those cared for at their own home went up to 33 percent, those in
someone else's home rose to 17 percent and children caring for
themselves jumped to 13 percent. Nearly 9 percent went to work with
mother and the rest went to other group care arrangements.

<BYLINE>Digital Tape Players May Take Awhile To Catch On, Experts Say</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Digital audio tape may be the next generation of
music technology, but some observers say it could take awhile to
catch on in the United States in spite of the removal of a
political obstacle.
   A yet-to-be-announced agreement cleared the way for widespread
U.S. sales of DAT players by requiring that the devices to contain
a chip that limits copying of digital tapes. Record companies
insisted on the copy protection for fear that widespread copying
would cut into their sales of compact discs.
   It is expected to take several months for the manufacturers to
add the copy-protection circuitry to the machines and bring the
devices to market.
   Sales may be slow at first. Recorder prices start at about
$1,000, while blank tapes _ which are about half the size of
conventional cassettes _ go for $12 to $18 and pre-recorded tapes
are priced at $24 to $30.
   Moreover, pre-recorded DAT cassettes are scarce because there is
a small market for them. That in turn is limiting sales of the
equipment in Japan and Europe, where they have been on the market
for several years.
   The sound quality of DAT is excellent, with none of the hiss of
ordinary tape. DAT also seems to produce a deeper sound than
compact discs, as if sound was coming out of a second pair of
speakers behind the first one.
   Digital audio tape records sound in the form of the ones and
zeroes of computer language, in contrast to conventional tape, in
which sound is recorded as an ``analog'' version of actual sound
waves.
   The copy-protection system, called Solo, was developed by NV
Philips, the Dutch electronics giant, said Albert Ruttner, a vice
president of North American Philips Corp., Philips' U.S. arm.
   With the copy-protection chip, a DAT player can make a nearly
perfect digital recording from a digital source such as a CD, but
it is impossible to make copies of the copy. That means people
would be able to make copies of CDs for their own use but would not
be able to start up a massive piracy operation of high-speed
tape-to-tape copying.
   The Recording Industry Association of America said Wednesday it
would provide a statement for reporters on the deal today but would
not allow it to be made public before Friday.
   The Philips-developed Solo chip leaves an inaudible electronic
``flag'' on a DAT cassette. A recorder that detects the flag will
not copy the cassette.
   Philips has been saying the Solo system does not affect the
quality of the music in any way, unlike a system proposed by CBS
Records that was criticized by testers from the government's
National Engineering Laboratory.
   Still, the controversy over copy protection, which has delayed
the official U.S. introduction of DAT for more than a year, could
cause some potential customers to feel that DAT players with the
Solo chip are somehow inferior.
   ``If just one person in a magazine says there's an audible
difference, people will say I'm not going to buy it. I don't know
how much of it is psychosomatic,'' said Kevin McEvoy, director of
national sales for 6th Avenue Electronics City Inc. in New York,
which sells DAT machines acquired in Japan through unofficial
channels.
   Represented in the working group that reached the
copy-protection agreement are 15 Japanese and European
manufacturers; the Washington-based Electronic Industries
Association; and two recording industry trade groups, the Recording
Industry Association of America and the London-based International
Federation of Phonographic Industries, according to Ron Petty, a
Sony Corp. of America spokesman in Park Ridge, N.J.
   DAT machines are being sold in Japan and some parts of Europe
and in limited quantities in the United States. Most of the models
sold in the United States are not through manufacturer-authorized
channels and therefore do not carry warranties. The sales, however,
are legal.
   Professional DAT equipment also is available in the United
States from several foreign manufacturers.
   Most of the DAT equipment now on the market cannot make direct
digital recordings from CDs without modification. They first must
convert the digital signals into the analog mode and then reconvert
them to digital. Some listeners say that results in a slight
degradation of sound quality, although others say the change is
unnoticeable.
   Japanese electronics makers, which manufacture most DAT
equipment, have refrained from actively selling DAT machines in the
United States because of opposition from the U.S. record industry
and the threat of copyright-infringement lawsuits.

<HEAD>IBM Confirms Delay in Delivery of Data-Storage Devices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. has
confirmed it has postponed the announcement of a new family of
data-storage devices because some of its test results had not met
expectations.
   The devices are intended to replace the 3380 family of disk
drives that were announced in 1980 and account for roughly $5
billion a year in sales for IBM.
   IBM's stock price fell $1.50 after The Wall Street Journal
reported the delay in Wednesday's editions but ended the day only
25 cents lower at $112.50 in consolidated New York Stock Exchange
trading.
   IBM had been scheduled to hold a news conference Tuesday to
announce the new generation of disk drives, which store massive
quantities of information for big mainframe computers.
   ``When we are satisfied that this product performs to our
exacting standards we will announce it,'' the company said in a
brief statement Monday.
   Analysts said the delay would probably be at least several
months, or the company would have gone ahead with the announcement.
IBM was embarrassed when it announced the 3380 family in 1980 and
then could not begin deliveries until late 1981.
   ``We're telling customers to be prepared for fall deliveries but
don't bet the farm on it,'' said Frank Gens, an analyst at
International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass.
   IBM's Japanese competitors will have a hard time exploiting the
delay because they do not have disk drives that match what IBM will
be bringing out, said Robert Bardagy, executive vice president of
Comdisco Inc., which leases IBM equipment.
   Separately, IBM said it had agreed to spend $116.5 million to
acquire a 19.8 percent stake in Policy Management Systems Corp., a
company in Columbia, S.C., that makes software for insurance
companies.
   It said it would be permitted to buy an additional 10.2 percent
in the open market.
   The investment is the latest in a spree of investments in
software companies by IBM. Analysts say the company is trying to
get the companies to write more software for IBM computers.
   In another development, the city of Baltimore gave IBM
permission to build a 26-story, $50 million office building in the
desirable Inner Harbor section in exchange for IBM concessions
including a payment to the city of $700,000.

   Just nine days after the founding family of
Cummins Engine Co. spent about $72 million of its own money to
insulate the Indiana diesel engine maker from possible takeover,
another challenge may be on the horizon.
   Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd., a Hong Kong-based investment
concern, has acquired 9.9 percent of Cummins, according to a filing
Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   On July 17, members of the Miller family, which founded Cummins
in 1919, paid a premium to buy back 8.8 percent of Cummins stock
held by the U.S. arm of British conglomerate Hanson PLC.
   Industrial Equity said it acquired its Cummins stake for
investment purposes and did not plan to launch a takeover.
   Robert G. Sutherland, a director of Industrial Equity and chief
executive of its North American operations, said the company began
buying Cummins stock about a year ago.
   ``We started before Hanson,'' he said in a telephone interview
from his office in La Jolla, Calif. ``We were equally surprised to
learn of Hanson's stake,'' which was disclosed in December.
   Miller family members were not immediately reachable Wednesday
for comment on the IEP stock acquisition.
   Henry B. Schacht, chairman and chief executive of Columbus,
Ind.-based Cummins, said Sutherland notified Cummins management of
its stake Thursday night.
   ``These people are much, much smaller'' than Hanson, Schacht
said after talking to Sutherland. ``These are not people who have
spent 25 years acquiring and restructuring companies.''
   Schacht said the news of the Industrial Equity interest would
not generate the concern that had been caused by Hanson's stake.
``It would be very different to our constituents,'' he said.
   However, Wall Street reacted positively to the news, bidding up
the price of Cummins stock Wednesday by $2.50 to close at $60.25 a
share in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading.
   J. Irwin Miller, Cummins' 80-year-old former chairman, and other
family members said last week that they were paying about $72
million, or about $5 million over the going price for Hanson's
shares, to allay fears Cummins might be bought and moved.
   The payment of a premium price to reacquire a company's shares
from an outside investor who may or may not launch a takeover
attempt is often called ``greenmail.''
   Columbus, a city of 32,000 people about 35 miles south of
Indianapolis, is famous throughout the Midwest for its outdoor
sculpture and the distinctive modern architecture of its public
buildings _ much of it paid for by Cummins, the town's major
employer. Worldwide, the company employs 26,000.
   IEP, a securities investment concern with holdings in several
countries including the United States, said it paid $60.2 million
for the 1.01 million shares of Cummins common stock it acquired by
Tuesday.
   IEP is 70 percent controlled by Brierley Investments Ltd., a
Wellington, New Zealand, securities investment corporation, through
intermediary companies in Britain, Hong Kong and the Cook Islands
in the Pacific.
   IEP said it bought the Cummins shares for investment but that it
might acquire more shares _ up to 25 percent of the total _ either
on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions.
   According to the SEC filing, IEP operates two wholly owned
subsidiaries: Anadite Inc., a Chicago-based foundry and forgings
company; and Associated Hosts Inc., a restaurant and hotel operator.
   IEP also holds the majority of shares in Tozer, Kemsley &amp;
Millbourn, an Anglo-French auto importer and retailer, and Molokai
Ranch Limited, a landholding company on the Hawaiian island of
Molokai.

<HEAD>12 States File Suit Against Visa and MasterCard</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twelve states have sued Visa and MasterCard for
allegedly conspiring to prevent other companies from introducing a
national debit card network while delaying the launch of a debit
card they developed jointly.
   A debit card can be presented at stores like a credit card, but
the money is automatically transferred from the card-holder's
account to the merchant's.
   ``You don't have to be an expert in antitrust law. It's the most
basic common sense to see what they're up to,'' New York Attorney
General Robert Abrams said Wednesday after the civil antitrust suit
was filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
   ``You had separate entities available to compete with one
another and over a course of several years, as a result of a
concerted strategy, as a result of an implemented conspiracy, they
have now monopolized the market,'' he said, ``and they have done
that in violation of state and federal antitrust laws.''
   Visa U.S.A. Inc. and MasterCard International Inc. both said the
allegations were unfounded.
   According to the complaint, Visa and MasterCard allegedly
undermined competition through a joint venture, called Entree, and
by acquiring control of the nation's two largest automated teller
machine networks.
   The two ATM networks _ Cirrus System Inc. of Downers Grove,
Ill., and Plus System Inc. of Denver _ had been devising their own
plans for national debit card networks in the early and mid 1980s.
   The merger agreements required them to abandon those plans,
Abrams said.
   Visa also took over the Interlink Network, based in San Mateo,
Calif., the nation's largest regional debit card network.
   Abrams said 93 percent of retail transactions in America today
are done by cash or check, ``so the development of a debit card
will have enormous implications of practical consequence to both
consumers and merchants.''
   Visa and MasterCard signed an agreement in 1987 to jointly
introduce Entree. More than 177 financial institutions have joined
Entree, and 1.4 million Entree cards have been issued, Abrams said.
But since no merchants accept the cards, their only use is to
withdraw cash from automated teller machines.
   ``All of these entities are committed to the program, but the
program has not been introduced in any significant way ... to
merchants,'' said Lloyd Constantine, chief of the antitrust bureau
in Abrams' office. ``If and when somebody tries to come in to the
market, this entity is ready to pounce.''
   Abrams said the two companies apparently have chosen instead to
continue to promote their highly profitable credit card business.
   ``They want to continue to maintain the profits of their credit
card operations by having dominance and control of the introduction
of the debit card industry,'' he said.
   The suit asks the federal court to stop the Entree joint
venture, compel the divestiture of Cirrus by MasterCard and Plus
and Interlink by Visa, and impose fines of as much as $1 million
each per violation of antitrust laws.
   Constantine said the fines could total as much as $10 million
each on the New York charges alone.
   Visa issued a brief statement saying the allegations were
unfounded and ``not in the best interest of the public.''
   ``What we've been attempting to do with Entree is bring another
valuable payment system option to consumers and merchants,'' the
statement said.
   ``We continue to believe that Entree is pro-competition and that
it can provide consumers a valuable service,'' said Visa spokesman
Dan Brigham, although he conceded that no merchants have yet been
signed to participate in the program.
   MasterCard issued a statement saying: ``The notion that
MasterCard's participation in this novel and untried program is
anti-competitive is completely unfounded. On the contrary, if the
program should prove to be successful, it will (be) highly
pro-competitive. ... We are convinced that Entree is perfectly
lawful and in the public interest, and we are confident that we
will prevail in the courts.''
   Both Brigham and a spokesman for New York-based MasterCard,
Richard Woods, said it was the banks' responsibility to recruit
merchants for the card.
   ``MasterCard has really served as a catalyst in creating the
system,'' Woods said. ``At this point it is really a matter between
the banks and merchants to provide an economic reason to present
this program to the consumers. ... Our feeling is that there is a
great interest out there in debit.''
   The other states that filed suit were California, Connecticut,
Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Tennessee, Texas,
Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

   A graduate student who officials say unleased
a ``virus'' that infected thousands of military and university
computers is the first person charged under a federal law banning
unauthorized computer access.
   Robert Tappan Morris was indicted Wednesday in Syracuse, N.Y.,
on a single count of illegally gaining access to at least four
computers and paralyzing their operations. He is scheduled to be
arraigned before a U.S. magistrate Aug. 2.
   The Justice Department said in a statement here that the case
represents the first time that federal prosecutors have brought
charges under a section of a 1986 law that prohibits unauthorized
computer access.
   The indictment followed months of deliberations within the
Justice Department about whether to bring felony or misdemeanor
charges against Morris, who was a student at Cornell University
when the incident occurred Nov. 2.
   The charge carries a maximum five-year sentence and a fine of up
to $250,000. Morris, of Arnold, Md., could also be ordered to pay
restitution to cover damages if he is convicted.
   A computer industry group estimated that the virus infected
6,200 computers and caused $96 million in damages. But a Cornell
University panel that investigated the incident called the estimate
``grossly exaggerated.''
   The indictment stated that the virus caused damage of more than
$1,000.
   Defense lawyer Thomas A. Guidoboni said Morris would plead
innocent.
   The Cornell panel said the virus, or worm, affected thousands of
university and military computers hooked up to the nationwide
ARPANET network used to transmit non-classified data. The network
was shut down for several days, but no electronic files were
destroyed.
   The panel said the incident was the result of ``a juvenile act
that ignored the clear potential consequences.'' But the commission
also noted that ``it appears to have been an uncharacteristic act
for Morris,'' who graduated from Harvard last year before beginning
a graduate program in computer science at Cornell.
   Guidoboni said Morris, who has been on leave, has been given a
one-year suspension from the university beginning in September.
   Morris' father is chief computer scientist for the National
Computer Security Center near Baltimore.
   The indictment charged that Morris ``intentionally and without
authorization'' accessed computers at the University of California
at Berkeley; NASA at Moffett Field, Calif.; Purdue University in
West Lafayette, Ind.; the U.S. Air Force Logistics Command at
Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio; and others.

   A General Motors Corp. auto assembly
plant made its last car and sent its 1,300 workers home, with
little hope that the 41-year-old plant would ever reopen.
   ``We've done a lot of deep thinking about what we're going to do
with our lives,'' said Robert Biscotti, a plant supervisor. ``There
has been a grieving period, but after awhile you realize: `What can
you do?'''
   GM closed the plant Wednesday because demand for its Buick
Century and Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera hasn't kept pace with its
capacity to build them.
   Dee Allen, a spokesman for the automaker, said at most the door
is ajar.
   ``We haven't precluded the option of opening again, but we have
more than enough facilities without Framingham,'' he said from
Detroit.
   The plant has had two other layoffs, including about 1,200 last
spring, and some temporary closings during the last several years.
About 500 workers are staying on temporarily to mothball the plant.
   ``We've had good years where we've worked six days a week and
then days where we don't work at all,'' said Roland Cole, a 20-year
plant veteran and United Auto Workers member.
   ``It's been a home to a lot of us. We've been like brothers,''
says Joao DeCruz, a Portugal native who plans to go on unemployment
compensation.
   Many of the senior employees have opted for early retirement;
some have taken advantage of GM, state and federally funded
retraining programs or relocation.
   Others have accepted a company buyout that union officials say
they can't discourage because the prospects for getting rehired are
poor. GM offered one-time payments of $40,000 to workers with 10 or
more years service and $65,000 to those with 25 years on the job.
   Gov. Michael Dukakis, who holds out hope for a resumption of
production, said there is not much that can be done if people
aren't buying cars.
   Dukakis recalled Wednesday how he met with GM President Roger
Smith and other top company officials about sparing the plant after
the company announced the closing plans in February.
   ``All I can tell you is what he said to me, and that was that
they didn't invest a quarter of a billion dollars to modernize the
plant so (GM could) walk away from it,'' Dukakis said. But, he
said, it comes down to economics.
   The plant was the largest employer last year in Framingham, 22
miles southwest of Boston. It paid $830,000 in local taxes, spent
$19 million on local suppliers and had a payroll of $59 million.
   The city of 65,000 is likely to overcome the loss better than
many factory towns because of its diverse economic base, which
includes computer manufacturing, stationery production and a
375-room hotel.

   A partisan dispute over how to fund President
Bush's multibillion-dollar savings and loan bailout is the last
major snag holding up a House-Senate compromise on the legislation.
   Congressional negotiators resolved virtually every other
difference between the two chambers Wednesday in a marathon session
that began at 9 a.m. and lasted nearly until midnight.
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., the leader of the
five-member Senate delegation, and Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,
said they intended to finish work today.
   The full House and Senate would then be expected to vote on the
compromise package next week before leaving on vacation, sending it
to Bush six months after he first outlined his 10-year, $166
billion proposal to close or rescue hundreds of failed S&amp;Ls.
   The chief sticking point keeping the bill from the president's
desk was a dispute over whether to count S&amp;L spending as part of
the budget deficit.
   The Bush administration and the Senate want to keep $50 billion
out of the deficit. Democrats and the House would balloon the
deficit, but prevent S&amp;L spending from triggering automatic
spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law.
   Earlier this week, Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., Jake Garn,
R-Utah, and Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., held a majority on the Senate
side, insisting on the administration plan, according to industry
and congressional sources.
   But House conferees on Wednesday said privately they believed
Cranston could be persuaded to change his mind and join Riegle and
Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., in support of conceding to the House.
   However, Cranston told reporters during a break in negotiations
that he has not changed his position. If Cranston did shift, the
Democratic funding plan would still have to clear the Senate where
administration supporter Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, says he has the
support of 40 other senators, enough to block it under that
chamber's rules.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady has threatened to recommend
the president veto the bill unless Congress agrees to
administration's off-budget mechanism. But, Democrats say they are
confident Bush would not hold up badly needed legislation over a
budget accounting question.
   In compromises struck Wednesday, Senate delegates, at the urging
of the House, agreed to tougher limits on junk bonds as well as a
requirement that S&amp;Ls devote more assets to home mortgage lending.
In exchange, the House made two concessions to the Senate.
   Conferees decided to permit S&amp;L regulator M. Danny Wall to
continue in his job for at least two years and they gave power over
state-chartered thrifts to the new agency that Wall will head
within the Treasury Department, rather than to the independent
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   Those issues were important to Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the
senior Republican on the Senate Banking Committee. Wall earlier
served as Garn's chief aide and the senator wanted to protect
Wall's job and the power of his agency.
   House and Senate conferees also reached agreement on capital
rules governing how much money S&amp;L owners are required to invest in
their institutions. Both House and Senate would require S&amp;L owners
to back their lending with more of their own money and they settled
a difference on the timing of the new standards.
   In other deals struck, the FDIC got the job of disposing of real
estate and other assets from failed S&amp;Ls, but it will be overseen
by a five-member oversight board _ the Resolution Trust Corp. _
headed by the Treasury secretary.
   Non-profit groups and poor people will get the first chance to
buy residential properties controlled by the RTC. Also, the
industry-owned regional Federal Home Loan Banks will subsidize
housing loans for poor people. And, banks and S&amp;Ls with more than
$30 million in assets will have to disclose their records of
serving minorities and the poor.

<HEAD>Nation Will Have Enough Nuke Fuel Storage Until 2025</HEAD>

   The nation's nuclear power plants will have
enough sites to store spent nuclear fuel until 2025 even if the
government scraps the planned Yucca Mountain repository in Nevada,
according to a Nuclear Regulatory Commission task force report.
   The commission's Waste Confidence Review Group, in Wednesday's
report to commissioners, said a new site could be selected and put
into operation by then if necessary.
   Robert Bernero, who headed the task force, said finding and
opening a new site would take 25 years. Plans call for the Yucca
Mountain repository to begin operations in 2003. Initial
construction work on shafts aimed at detailed investigation of the
Nevada site is scheduled to begin in November.
   In 1987, Congress suspended consideration of any site other than
Yucca Mountain. Other sites that had been considered were the
Hanford nuclear reservation near Richland, Wash., and a site in
Deaf Smith County, Texas.
   The task force said Yucca Mountain, mandated by the Nuclear
Waste Policy Act Amendment of 1987, could prove unsuitable.
   The Nevada governor opposes the project; questions have arisen
about geological faults and potential volcanic activity at the
site; and the NRC staff is concerned that Environmental Protection
Agency standards may be unworkable.
   Bernero, director of NRC nuclear materials safety and
safeguards, said new dry-storage technology means fuel can be
stored longer, more safely and more cheaply above ground. As a
result, he said, estimates of 30 years of safe on-site storage are
conservative.
   Plants that once had operating licenses for 40 years may have
them extended by as many as 30 years, meaning that fuel may be on
site 100 years before finding a final resting place, Bernero said.
   The NRC reviews the ``Waste Confidence Decision'' every five
years. The commission will vote on the present report and publish
its findings for public comment.

   Hollywood could lose big if it doesn't agree
to a plan limiting the amount of U.S. television shows such as
``Dallas'' and ``The Golden Girls'' that can be shown in Europe,
British media executive Sir Robert Maxwell says.
   Maxwell, who has extensive publishing and television holdings on
both sides f the Atlantic, Wednesday said Hollywood must negotiate
or face even more onerous restrictions from European nations
determined to build their own film and television production
communities.
   European Community leaders want to stem the ``Americanization''
of Europe by U.S. TV programs, he said.
   He said the EC is certain to adopt a community-wide quota system
for non-European TV shows, and individual nations such as France
may set even tougher quotas.
   But Hollywood representatives at Wednesday's hearing said they
could not live with a quota system that threatens to erode their
overseas sales, drive up prices and perhaps lead to other
restrictions.
   At stake is a significant portion of the $2.5 billion surplus of
trade that the U.S. film-TV industry has with the rest of the world
_ a surplus that is likely to grow as more nations look for
programs to feed onto cable TV and satellite delivery systems.
   ``The American entertainment industry stands to lose a greater
portion of the European broadcast market if the (EC) cannot reach
an agreement and the decision is relegated to the judgment and
controls of individual European states,'' Maxwell told the House
Energy and Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications and finance.
   Shows such as ``Dallas,'' with its prototypically ``American''
family, the Ewings, are very popular overseas, and such programs
are relatively inexpensive. But Maxwell said just 5,000 hours out
of 105,000 hours of movies and tapes shown on European TV are
produced in Europe, with the rest mainly coming from the United
States.
   That makes it a sensitive issue of money, jobs and preserving
Europe's cultural diversity, Maxwell said.
   ``European citizens will not sit in their parlors watching their
culture replaced by images made in Hollywood, Mexico City or
Tokyo.''
   The subcommittee is considering possible U.S. responses to the
television provisions of the EC plan to lower trade barriers among
its members in 1992. The ``Television Without Frontiers'' proposal
calls for a ``majority proportion'' of transmission time where
practical to be reserved for works of European origin with the 12
member nations.
   It would replace a patchwork of existing restrictions that range
from tough, mandatory quotas in France, to quotas that are largely
ignored in Italy, to no quotas at all in West Germany, Denmark and
Greece.
   The EC has failed twice this year to approve the plan, and may
consider it again in October.
   Maxwell called the EC plan a ``soft quota'' compromise because
it avoids mandatory limits, and he urged Congress not to engage in
a trade war to protect the U.S. entertainment industry.
   Richard Frank, president of Walt Disney Studios, which offers
``The Golden Girls'' and Disney movies in Europe, said American
producers depend heavily on overseas sales to finance programs for
U.S. viewing.
   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, said he welcomed negotiations, but if talks fail, the
Hollywood community will ask Congress to ``help protect a national
asset.''
   Subcommittee Chairman Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., told
Maxwell there was strong bipartisan feeling in Congress that the
United States will do what is must to keep markets open overseas.

   The Senate is giving offshore oil drilling and
timber sales in the Northwest a boost, but the National Endowment
for the Arts is getting a monetary slap on the wrist for supporting
controversial artists.
   Lawmakers, on a voice vote Wednesday, approved legislation
providing $10.9 billion for the government's land, cultural and
Indian programs for the 1990 fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
   The Senate now must design a compromise bill with the House,
which approved an $11.1 billion version of the measure July 12.
   One of the most controversial aspects of the legislation, the
first of the 13 annual appropriations bills that finance federal
agencies to be passed by both houses this year, involves the
National Endowment for the Arts.
   The bill grants $170.2 million to the agency, but slaps its
wrist by cutting $45,000 from its budget. That's the amount the
agency granted last year to a pair of controversial photo exhibits.
   Some lawmakers complained that public money should not have been
used to display the photos, which included homosexual and
sadomasochistic acts as well as a display showing a crucifix in a
container of urine.
   The Senate provided $100,000 to the endowment to hire an outside
contractor to review how the agency determines grant distribution.
And on a voice vote, lawmakers adopted an amendment by Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., forbidding the agency to issue funds for materials
considered obscene or which may be offensive to particular
religions or to any race, sex, or nationality.
   The bill emerged from the Senate with a less favorable edge for
environmentalists than the House version.
   Senators accepted the moratorium the House placed on 84 million
acres of offshore land for oil and gas drilling. Such moratoriums,
which last a year, have been continuous since efforts to open the
continental shelf to exploration and drilling began in the early
part of the Reagan administration.
   But senators eliminated House language blocking the government
from taking preliminary steps, such as public hearings and studies,
to lease tracts off the coasts of the Northeast and California. If
the moratorium were lifted, lease activities could begin much
faster if those early steps were already completed.
   The Senate also rejected House language forcing the government
to consider buying back the leases of drilling areas off the Alaska
coast, which the House had adopted in response to local concerns
about the recent Prince William Sound oil spill. Instead, the
Senate ordered a two-year study of the spill's effects on fish
hatcheries.
   A provision that would have barred oil tankers from sailing
through waters where leasing moratoria are in effect was stripped
from the bill on a 72-27 vote. Supporters of offshore drilling had
hoped the clause would put pressure on lawmakers to end the leasing
restrictions, but opponents said the language would needlessly
boost petroleum prices.
   ``I really think this is punitive and mischievous,'' said Sen.
Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.
   The Senate also stepped into a dispute between timber interests
and environmentalists, freeing up hundreds of thousands of acres of
federal land in Washington, Oregon and California for logging.
   Environmentalists would be restricted from using the courts to
block cutting on some of the land, but certain areas would be
spared to retain a home for the rare spotted owl.
   Another provision, included in the bill by Sen. Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., chairman of the Appropriations Committee, requires
lobbyists helping groups seeking federal grants and contracts to
register with the government and report their earnings and
activities. It bars them from being paid with the federal money
they help their clients secure.

<HEAD>FAA Proposes $200,000 Fine for Late Reporting of Miswiring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. said it will fight a proposed
$200,000 government fine linked to allegations that the company did
not immediately report miswiring of fire extinguishers on two of
its 757-200 jets.
   The fine is the largest ever proposed by the Federal Aviation
Administration against the manufacturer, said Boeing spokesman Jack
Gamble.
   Boeing denies it was slow in reporting the problem to the
government and Wednesday said the ``threatened enforcement action
is unfortunate and unnecessary.''
   ``Our position is clear. We feel the fine is unmerited. We
followed the rules,'' hee said.
   Boeing reported the miswirings orally to the FAA last year,
according to the procedure in place at that time, Gamble said. The
company has since revised reporting procedures to include an
initial oral report and a subsequent written report.
   The FAA said Boeing waited until Jan. 4 to report in writing
about one case of miswiring it had known about for five months and
another it had known about for more than two months. The problems
were in the cargo fire extinguishing systems on 757s.
   The statement issued Wednesday by the FAA said Boeing ``failed
to transmit to FAA a report of these miswirings in an acceptable
form until Jan. 4, 1989.'' The statement said 24-hour notice was
required.
   FAA requirements for reporting defects in passenger jets were
revised in January to tighten the procedure and specify written
notification, Gamble said.
   Gamble said the FAA overstated the severity of the problems,
which Boeing believes did not seriously compromise the safety of
its aircraft.
   The flap is over defects in which a flight crew's attempt to use
a fire extinguisher, such as the release of flame-smothering halon
gas in a cargo compartment, would cause release of the gas or
another suppressant in the wrong compartment.
   After receiving written notification of the 757 wiring problems,
FAA officials ordered inspections of all 757s, then of all 767s and
747s produced since Dec. 31, 1980.
   Crossed wiring or plumbing subsequently was found in 94 planes,
with the problem occurring in all three models. None of the
problems affected airworthiness, and all were corrected before the
planes were returned to service, FAA officials said in April.
   Boeing officials subsequently announced design changes to reduce
the chance of further wiring or plumbing problems.
   The largest previous fine proposed by the FAA against Boeing was
$150,000 for self-locking nuts that failed to meet specifications
in 1987. After a negotiated settlement, Boeing paid $125,000.

   Share prices were higher at midday Thursday, as
the market continued to get a boost from Wall Street's Wednesday
gain and from the possibility of more speculative activity.
   ``The market feels good and firm,'' said one equities trader.
``There's a belief that we've bottomed out earlier in the week and

   Dealers said European investors were engaged in healthy buying.
   They also cited the stronger pound for the market's advance.

<HEAD>Checchi Acquires Controlling Interest In Northwest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An investment group led by Los Angeles
businessman Alfred Checchi said today it has successfully completed
its tender offer for Northwest Airlines' parent company.
   Checchi's group, Wings Holdings Inc,. said its $121-a-share
tender offer for the common stock of NWA Inc. expired at 5 p.m. EDT
Wednesday.
   ``For all intents and purposes, the deal's over,'' said Checchi
spokesman David Duffy. NWA agreed last month to be acquired by
Wings for $121 a share, or approximately $3.6 billion.
   As of the expiration date, more than 22.6 million NWA shares had
been delivered and more than 8.3 million shares had been tendered,
Wings said. As of May 31, there were more than 29.4 million
oustanding shares of NWA common stock.
   Wings said it expects to merge NWA with a subsidiary of Wings
shortly.
   Meanwhile Wednesday, union pilots at Northwest Airlines rallied
outside three airports to vent frustration with the pace of
contract negotiations, which have lasted 28 months.
   ``We don't see progress being made,'' said Andy Murphy, a
spokesman for the 5,000-member Air Line Pilots Association local at
Northwest. ``There is a real possibility that there could be a
strike here in a couple of weeks.''
   Despite the harsh talk and informational picketing at Northwest
hub airports in the Twin Cities, Memphis and Detroit, negotiations
continued Wednesday at NWA's Eagan headquarters. Josh Javits,
chairman of the National Mediation Board, attended the talks for
the third consecutive day.
   The talks were to continue today, said Northwest spokesman Bob
Gibbons.
   ``I think the mere fact that we are negotiating is a positive
sign,'' said NWA spokesman Alan Muncaster. ``A lot of rhetoric
won't help.''
   Before the pilots could legally walk off their jobs, the
National Mediation Board would have to declare an impasse, which
would trigger a 30-day cooling-off period. Pilots would be free to
strike and the company would be free to impose its latest offer at
the end of the period.

   A New York psychiatrist allegedly used inside
information from a patient to make a $27,475 profit on a stock
deal, according to an indictment that charges the doctor with
securities and mail fraud.
   The 46-count indictment filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court
addressed a series of 1986 transactions by the psychiatrist, Robert
Howard Willis, involving the stock of BankAmerica Corp.
   Willis allegedly received non-public information during the
course of a patient consultation about an attempt by Sanford I.
Weill, the former chief executive officer of Shearson, Loeb
Rhoades, to become head of BankAmerica.
   Willis was told by the patient that Weill, who had previously
left Shearson, had received a commitment from his former firm to
invest $1 billion in BankAmerica if he became BankAmerica's chief
executive officer, the indictment said.
   The patient, identified only as Jane Doe, had been told about
the bid by her husband who knew about it through his business
dealings, the indictment said.
   If Weill had been successful, the change would have caused
``substantial upheavals'' in the personal life of the patient and
her husband, it said.
   Using the information, Willis allegedly bought $171,130.50 worth
of BankAmerica stock between Jan. 14, 1986 and Feb. 6, 1986.
   He sold the stock Feb. 21, 1986, after a public announcement
about Weill's attempt to become a BankAmerica executive, making a
profit of $27,475 for himself and family members, the indictment
alleges.
   Weill, who now heads Primerica Corp., was unsuccessful in his
bid to join BankAmerica. Neither Weill nor BankAmerica was charged
with any wrongdoing.
   Willis, 55, was charged with 23 counts of securities fraud and
23 counts of mail fraud. If convicted, he faces up to five years in
prison and a $250,000 fine on each of the 46 counts.
   He is scheduled to be arraigned Aug. 3.

   Chrysler Corp.'s top managers headed to the
company's Highland Park headquarters today to hear details of a
plan to slash up to $1 billion from the automaker's budget.
   Some white-collar jobs are in jeopardy, a source speaking on
condition of anonymity said Wednesday, adding that $1 billion is a
target figure.
   ``I don't know if that's what we will achieve,'' the source said.
   Chairman Lee Iacocca was to present the plan at a regularly
scheduled meeting of the No. 3 automaker's top managers.
   Chrysler, like other automakers, refuses to discuss specific
spending plans. The company reported profits of $1.05 billion on
revenue of $35.47 billion in 1988.
   In an interview last week, Iacocca said he has been spending a
lot of time recently reviewing costs within the company.
   ``We are ambitious in cost-cutting,'' he said. ``We're changing
a lot of basic things, the way we do business.''
   Most economists and industry analysts have predicted a softening
in the automobile market in the coming year. Chrysler's forecast
for 1989 sales are the lowest of the Big Three _ 13.5 million to 14
million cars and trucks during the calendar year.
   That's down significantly from the 15.8 million vehicles sold in
the United States last year.
   Chrysler spokesman Barron Bates said Wednesday that the
cost-cutting plan didn't involve any plant closings or a
restructuring of the company.
   ``There's nothing to alter the way the company is being run,''
he said. ``We've been wrestling with costs since we bought American
Motors (in August 1987).
   ``It's tough to get managers to focus on this unless you are on
death's door like Ford and General Motors were back in 1979,'' he
said. ``We're looking at getting costs out and getting ahead of the
curve on this recession.''
   On Monday, Chrysler is scheduled to report its second-quarter
earnings. Analysts have speculated earnings will be up slightly
from the $320.4 million the company earned in the same period last
year.

   Stock prices bounded forward today as the market
built on buying momentum from the previous session amid optimism
about the chances for lower interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 14.42 to 2,627.47
at 10 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Advancing issues held a wide lead over declines on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 705 up, 275 down and 460 unchanged.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1 to 189.14. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index
was up 1.16 to 373.94.
   Signs that the Federal Reserve Board had further loosened its
hold on credit touched off a rally on Wall Street Wednesday that
accelerated with futures-related program trading.
   The advance carried Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index and the
NYSE's composite index to record levels and brought the Dow
industrials to another post-crash high.
   The Fed signalled its more relaxed credit posture by allowing
the federal funds rate to move to 9 percent from about 9\ percent
recently. This key rate, which is the fee that banks charge one
another on overnight loans, is considered a barometer of the
central bank's credit policy.
   The view that the economy needs the stimulation that lower
interest rates would provide was bolstered today by a Commerce
Department report showing the gross national product, the broadest
gauge of economic activity, expanded at a feeble 1.7 percent annual
rate in the April-June quarter.
   A surprise announcement today that Bristol-Myers Co. and Squibb
Corp. have agreed to merge in a stock-swap deal sparked interest in
pharmaceutical stocks. Trading in both stocks was delayed in
opening due to order imbalances and numerous other stocks in the
sector also were delayed.
   Merck jumped 1\ to 76~, helping to boost the Dow Jones
industrial average.
   On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average surged 29.97 to
2,613.05.
   Advancing issues outpaced declines by about 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 981 up, 483 down and 499
unchanged.
   The NYSE's composite index rose 2.04 to 188.14.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board expanded to 188.27 million
shares from 179.27 million in the previous session.

   The United States and the Soviet Union pledged
today to continue cooperation in forestry research, including
projects aimed at repulsing gypsy moth attacks on U.S. trees and
shrubs.
   Formal letters of intent outlining the agreement were signed at
the Agriculture Department by Aleksandr C. Isaev, chairman of the
Soviet Union's state forestry committee, and F. Dale Robertson,
chief of the U.S. Forest Service.
   Robertson and Isaev agreed to present a combined proposal at
this fall's meeting in Moscow of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Joint Committee
on Cooperation in the Field of Agriculture. The proposal would
establish a new working group on forestry.
   Isaev and two other Soviet officials wound up a 12-day
coast-to-coast tour of U.S. forest areas and facilities. The two
countries have cooperated on several projects in recent years,
including scientific exchanges, meetings and joint studies in
forest genetics and biology.
   Robertson said the Soviets ``have been very helpful'' in
locating parasites for potential control of gypsy moths in the
United States.
   A Forest Service scientist, William E. Wallner, currently is in
the Soviet Union on a five-month research project involving gypsy
moth behavior, the insect's response to sex attractants,
preferences for various tree species, and insect populations.
   The Isaev team visited hardwood timber stands and a Forest
Service insect-rearing facility in Hamden, Conn.; the agency's
facilities in Washington state, including Mount St. Helens and the
Wind River nursery; and wildlife and insect-control research
projects in Oregon.
   In Idaho, the Soviet officials toured fire-fighting
communications facilities, a smokejumper loft, and a fire cache at
the Boise Interagency Fire Center.

   Eastern Airlines is offering discounts and
frequent-flier mileage to funeral homes who use the carrier to ship
bodies.
   The special cargo rate for shipping the deceased is just one of
many incentives the airline is offering in an attempt regain
customers lost in a months-long strike, said airline spokeswoman
Karen Ceremsak.
   ``It's just a whole scheme of rebuilding an airline from
scratch,'' she said. ``We have been out of many markets for some
time, and as we return to those markets we are using price as an
incentive to get some of them back.''
   Eastern cargo officials have made personal visits to funeral
homes, offering a 50 percent discount on transportation of corpses
and frequent-flier mileage to funeral home operators for their
shipments.
   For example, Eastern will ship a body for $138.08 from Orlando
to Newark, half the standard fare. The fare for the same route on
other airlines ranges from $220.50 and $252.
   ``It's an extremely good price,'' said Mike Brownlie, funeral
director at Brownlie-Maxwell Funeral Home in Melbourne. ``Eastern
realizes it has to offer incentives.''
   Eastern plans to increase from 225 daily flights now to 350 on
Tuesday and 390 flights on Aug. 15. By then, Eastern would have
resumed flights in 70 cities compared with 118 before the
Machinists union strike that began March 4.
   The Miami-based carrier filed for bankruptcy protection four
days later.

   The U.S. economy turned in its most sluggish
performance in almost three years from April through June as
inflation shot up dramatically, the government reported today.
   In a report apt to raise recession fears, the Commerce
Department said the gross national product, the broadest gauge of
economic health, grew at a lackluster 1.7 percent annual rate in
the spring quarter.
   It was the worst growth rate since a 0.8 percent increase in the
third quarter of 1986, the last time the economy skirted close to a
recession.
   The sluggish growth reflected widespread weakness in big-ticket
consumer spending and housing construction and a sharp
deterioration in the country's foreign trade performance.
   Economists say that further weakness in any of these areas could
be enough to end the current record peacetime expansion, now in its
seventh year.
   Inflation is also posing a threat to the economy. A GNP
inflation index shot up at an annual rate of 4.9 percent in the
April-June quarter, the fastest clip in more than six years.
   The pickup, from an increase of 4 percent in the first quarter,
was blamed on a sharp jump in energy prices.
   The GNP report, which showed an even more sluggish economy than
many analysts had been expecting, represented a setback for the
Bush administration's economic forecasts.
   Last week, the administration issued a revised economic forecast
predicting economic growth of 2.9 percent for 1989 as measured
against all of 1988.
   To achieve that level, the economy will have to expand at an
annual rate of 2.7 percent in the last half of this year.
   While many private analysts are looking for the economy to
weaken further in the second half of the year, the administration
said today that it was looking for a rebound in economic activity,
spurred by recent moves at the Federal Reserve to lower interest
rates.
   Commerce Undersecretary Michael Darby said today he believed the
nation would be able to avoid a recession as credit-sensitive
sectors of the economy, such as consumer spending and housing
construction, respond to the ease in credit.
   ``The economy's forward momentum is sustainable,'' Darby told
reporters. ``As inflationary expectations decrease, there is room
for interest rates to decline further.''
   But many economists are forecasting that growth will slump
further, to an annual rate of around 1 percent in the final six
months of the year.
   Such weakness would leave the economy exposed to the danger than
any unforeseen shock, such as a further runup in oil prices, could
bring on the first recession since the 1981-82 downturn.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., and other
analysts are looking for a downturn to occur, either late this year
or early in 1990.
   ``We have already had a recession in the housing sector over the
last six months, caused by high mortgage rates,'' Sinai said. ``The
question is whether the economy will be able to strengthen enough
to offset weakness in consumer spending and weakness in
manufacturing. I doubt it.''
   With release of today's GNP report for the second quarter, the
government conducted an annual revision of past GNP figures. The
revisions found that the economy grew by 4.4 percent in 1988, the
fastest annual growth since a 6.8 percent increase in 1984.
   The 1988 GNP increase had earlier been put at 3.9 percent.
   While the administration is forecasting that economic growth
will slow to 2.9 percent this year, many private forecasters are
even more pessimistic.
   Much of the weakness in the economy reflects a year-long effort
by the Federal Reserve to drive up interest rates in an effort to
dampen inflationary pressures.
   However, the central bank switched in June to worrying more
about a recession than inflation. The Fed has made three small
moves since that time to push interest rates lower. The
administration is counting on this credit loosening to be enough to
revive interest rate-sensitive sectors of the economy and keep the
country out of a recession.
   The April-June GNP report showed the adverse impact of the Fed's
previous credit-tightening moves.
   Housing construction plunged at an annual rate of 13.6 percent
in the second quarter, the steepest decline since the first quarter
of 1982, when the country was mired in the last recession.
   Personal consumption spending rose at a sluggish rate of 1.1
percent while spending on big-ticket items such as autos actually
fell by 4 percent.
   Trade also contributed to the weakness in the GNP report as
imports, which had actually fallen in the first quarter, shot up by
8.7 percent in the second quarter. The trade deterioration would
have been even worse except for a healthy 11.3 percent jump in U.S.
exports.
   The 1.7 percent GNP increase followed a revised 3.7 percent rise
in the first quarter of 1989, a period in which much of the growth
came from a rebound in the farm economy after the lingering effects
of last summer's drought.
   In addition to changing the 1988 GNP growth, the annual
revisions also slightly altered GNP growth in 1986 and 1987,
revising those years to 2.7 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively.

   Corn and soybean futures prices were slightly
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade but
analysts said the move represented a technical correction
independent of supply-and-demand factors.
   Wheat futures were slightly lower.
   Forecasts for isolated showers in the Corn Belt through the
weekend limited early gains in the corn and soybean pits. But
recent declines, including five straight days of losses in the
closely-watched November soybean contract, were perceived as
exaggerated and the markets resisted pressure to move lower.
   ``Everything is still bearish fundamentally but we're due for a
technical bounce,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 2\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.86{ a bushel; corn was }

were unchanged to 2 cents higher with September at $1.44{ a bushel;

   The nation's two largest automakers reported
lower second-quarter earnings today, with Ford Motor Co. profits
down 15.7 percent and General Motors Corp. off 3.4 percent.
   Ford, the nation's second-largest automaker, said it made $1.4
billion, or $3 a share, during the quarter this year, compared with
$1.66 billion, or $3.43 a share, in the same 1988 period.
   GM said it earned $1.45 billion, or $2.23 a share, during the
April-June period this year, compared with $1.51 billion, or $2.26
a share, during last year's second quarter.
   GM revenue, including its three large subsidiaries, rose 1.3
percent during the quarter to $33.6 billion from $33.18 billion
last year. Ford's quarterly revenue was $25.9 billion, up 3.7
percent from $24.96 in the same 1988 period.
   Chrysler Corp., the nation's third-largest automaker, is to
report earnings Monday.
   For the first half of the year, GM said profits rose 15.7
percent to $3.01 billion, or $4.60 a share, from $2.6 billion, or
$3.82 a share in the first six months of last year.
   GM and Ford said incentives offered during the quarter put
pressure on profits, and that overseas operations continued to show
good profitability.
   ``GM's North American automotive operations continue to improve
their operating efficiencies, while overseas earnings in 1989 are
exceeding the record levels achieved in 1988,'' GM Chairman Roger
Smith and President Robert Stempel said in a joint statement.
   Ford said its overseas automotive operations earned $775 million
during the quarter, up 7.5 percent from a year ago, while earnings
of its U.S. automotive operations fell 36.8 percent to $459 million.
   ``Earnings declined from a year ago, primarily because of lower
U.S. industry sales and associated marketing expenses and higher
new-product development and plant modernization costs,'' Chairman
Donald Petersen and Vice Chairman Harold Poling said in a statement.
   Ford's earnings for the first half of 1989 stood at $3.04
billion, or $6.45 a share, on revenue of $51.76 billion. That's
down from profits of $3.29 billion, or $6.74 per share, on revenue
of $48.15 billion during the first six months of 1988.
   Earnings from the company's financial services segment, which
handles car loans and other transactions, dropped 19.9 percent
during the quarter to $172.7 million.
   The decline in quarterly earnings came as the automaker
increased its share of the U.S. car market to 22.7 percent, up 0.8
percent from a year ago. The company's share of the truck market
remained the same at 29.4 percent.
   Ford turned up the heat on incentives in late March by offering
increased cash rebates and low-interest financing deals for its new
cars. GM and Chrysler quickly followed suit.
   Since then, incentives have remained in the marketplace, with
each of the Big Three spending hundreds of dollars per vehicle.
   Ford's second-quarter earnings last year stands as the industry
record, and analysts have indicated that record may be around for a
while.
   The automobile and truck markets are softening. The incentives
were introduced to boost sales and shrink inventories built up by
overly ambitious production schedules.
   However, customers weren't as enticed by the incentives during
the second-quarter as in the past. Each company has shut down some
plants the past few months for longer-than-usual vacation times,
model changeovers or to stop the car supply pipeline, giving
dealers more time to sell cars on their lots.

   Fears of political and economic
instability are inciting people to spirit billions of dollars out
of Brazil at an alarming rate, economists and officials say.
   A record $12 billion is expected to leave the country illegally
this year, economist Clarice Pechman, one of the country's leading
foreign exchange experts, said in an interview.
   Legal profit remittances also are up, reflecting decisions by
many subsidiaries of foreign-owned multinationals to send money
back home rather than reinvest it in Brazil.
   The dollar drain hurts this economically ailing country, which
desperately needs foreign currency to buy foreign goods for its
modernization and repay a staggering foreign debt, the largest in
the Third World. As reckoned by the World Bank, Brazil's
obligations to foreign lenders totals $120 billion.
   ``With hyperinflation just around the corner, a government that
lacks any credibility, and all sorts of uncertainties surrounding
the country's political and economic future, it is only natural
that those who can will send their money out of the country,'' said
economist Joaquim Eloi Cirne de Toledo of the University of Sao
Paulo.
   Brazil's annual inflation rate exceeds 1,000 percent. The
government of President Jose Sarney has been widely discredited
because four anti-inflation programs have failed.
   Presidential elections on Nov. 15 add to investors' uncertainty.
Brazilians will choose their president for the first time in 29
years, following the end of an authoritarian military regime that
ruled from 1964 to 1985.
   Miss Pechman said that by her reckoning, $7.5 billion left the
country illegally last year, compared with $5.8 billion for the
entire 1978-1982 period. The amount is expected to rise again this
year.
   ``That will bring to $41.1 billion the amount of foreign
exchange illegally accumulated in overseas accounts,'' she said.
   The economist said she based her figures on statistics from the
World Bank, International Monetary Fund and conversations with many
Brazil-based exporters.
   The government's Central Bank said it had no estimates of
capital flight.
   Toledo said the billions leaving the country ``could be used to
increase imports of capital goods and high-tech products needed to
modernize our industry and make it more competitive on the world
market.''
   The most common illegal methods of getting dollars out of the
country are via contraband _ especially of coffee and soybeans _
and by falsifying invoices for exports and imports, Pechman and
Toledo said.
   Most contraband operations are done through neighboring
Paraguay, where the exporter sells goods for dollars.
   In another common scam, an exporter might sell, for example,
$1,500 worth of goods but declare just $1,000 to the government
trade bureau. The $500 difference goes into the exporter's bank
account outside Brazil.
   Importers do the reverse, claiming to pay $1,500 for merchandise
that costs $1,000. Again, they pocket the difference in dollars.
   Not all capital flight is illegal. Many big companies are taking
their money out of this country.
   ``A foreign-owned company will always prefer to remit its
profits rather than reinvest in an economically unstable country
such as Brazil,'' said economist Rubens Branco of the Rio de
Janeiro branch office of Arthur Andersen, the American accounting
firm.
   At a recent debate on foreign capital, Branco said
multinationals were expected to remit close to $2.3 billion this
year, up from $1.54 billion last year and $909 million in 1987.
   Toledo of the University of Sao Paulo said some companies also
speculate with their remittances by exploiting the huge difference
between the official exchange rate and the black market dollar
price.
   Profit remittances and foreign investments are calculated at the
official rate. In mid-July, for example, a company wanting to remit
money could exchange $1 million for roughly 1.8 million Brazilian
new cruzados _ about half the black market rate.
   ``The company could then go to the black market, pay about
$515,000 and get back its 1.8 million new cruzados, which are
reinvested in Brazil. The company has $485,000 left back home,''
Toledo said.
   Finance Minister Mailson Da Nobrega said capital flight was
``not a serious problem in a country like Brazil, although recent
estimates indicate it has accelerated over the past few years.''
   Nobrega said the only way to slow down capital flight is by
``establishing a climate of confidence, because capital flight is a
product of uncertainty.''
   Despite the minister's denial, the government has shown concern
with the dollar outflow and its drain on the country's hard
currency reserves, estimated at between $5 billion and $6 billion.
   In late June, Brazil missed a debt payment to foreign government
creditors, claiming it had to maintain its reserves. Part of the
payment was made two weeks later.
   The government also ordered all foreign exchange operations to
be made through the Central Bank, in an effort to slow down
remittances. Before, any bank could make those operations.

   Demand for satellites and computer services
boosted second-quarter earnings at two General Motors Corp.
subsidiaries, while high interest costs eroded profits at the
automaker's financing arm.
   GM Hughes Electronics Corp. and Electronic Data Systems Corp.
reported rising sales and earnings. General Motors Acceptance Corp.
said Wednesday that despite higher loan volume, the interest crunch
cut its net income nearly 20 percent.
   GM today reported that the entire corporation earned $1.45
billion, or $2.23 a share, during the April-June period, down 3.4
percent from $1.51 billion, or $2.26 a share, in the same 1988
quarter.
   Revenue for the corporation rose 1.3 percent to $33.6 billion
from $33.18 billion last year.
   GM Hughes Electronics reported second-quarter earnings of $240
million, or 60 cents a share of General Motors Class H stock, up
from $180 million, or 50 cents a share, in the second quarter of
1988.
   Second-quarter revenue at GM Hughes Electronics was $2.88
billion, up from $2.87 billion a year earlier.
   GM Hughes Electronics said growth in its telecommunications
business included sales of satellite services to three operations:
a joint venture of HBO and Turner Broadcasting System; ESPN, the
nation's largest cable network; and CBS.
   Second-quarter earnings in 1988 were boosted by one-time gains
from stock sales. Earnings from operations comparable to 1989 would
have been $180 million, or 45 cents a share, said spokesman Bruce
McCristal.
   For the first six months of the year, GM Hughes reported
earnings of $450.4 million, or $1.11 a share, on revenue of $5.89
billion, compared with earnings of $453 million, of $1.13 a share,
on revenue of $5.54 billion in the first half of 1988.
   The six-month figures in 1988 also were boosted by one-time
gains, from the second-quarter stock sales and a first-quarter
accounting change, McCristal said. Without them, comparable
operating earnings for 1988 would have been $366 million, or 90
cents a share, he said.
   EDS said demand for data-processing services by banks and other
customers helped push its second-quarter net income to $104.9
million, or 87 cents a share of GM Class E Stock, on revenue of
$1.38 billion. That compared with results of $95.7 million, or 78
cents a share, on revenue of $1.20 billion in the second quarter of
1988.
   For the first six months, EDS reported net income of $204.9
million, or $1.69 a share, on revenue of $2.66 billion. That was up
from $184.8 billion, or $1.51 a share, on revenue of $2.32 billion
for the first half of 1988.
   GMAC said its net income from financing, insurance and mortgage
operations was $268.6 million for the three months ended June 30,
down from $333.9 million in the second quarter of 1988.
   Financing and leasing business in the United States increased 27
percent from the earlier period, GMAC said. But the company said
its average cost of borrowings worldwide was 9.53 percent for the
quarter, up from 7.94 percent a year earlier.
   For the first six months, GMAC reported consolidated net income
of $625 million, down from $688.3 million for the first half of
1988.
   GMAC had total assets of $102.8 billion June 30, up from $99.9
billion a year earlier, spokesman John Andrews said.

   Bond prices advanced in early trading today
after the government reported a weaker-than-expected increase in
economic growth, adding to speculation that the Federal Reserve is
loosening its credit policy.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was up 13-32 point, or $4
for every $1,000 in face value, at midday. Its yield, which moves
in the opposite direction from price, fell to 8.07 percent from
8.10 percent late Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department reported that the gross national product
grew at a 1.7 percent pace in the second quarter, the slowest
performance since a 0.8 percent increase in the third quarter of
1986.
   Many analysts had been expecting growth of 2 percent or more in
the quarter, and the slower rate sparked a rally in the bond market.
   Robert Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank in New York,
said traders took the number as an indication that ``the Fed might
ease further.''
   He said he felt the Fed had already loosened its credit policy,
as indicated by its decision to stand aside for the past few days
while the federal funds rate traded below 9\ percent.
   The federal funds rate is the interest that banks charge each
other for short-term loans and the central bank exerts a powerful
influence over the rate by arranging temporary sales of securities
when it wants to nudge the rate higher and buying them for short
periods when it wants a lower rate.
   The federal funds rate was trading at 9 percent at midday, up
from 8{ percent late Wednesday.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term issues were up 3-16 point, intremediate maturities
increased about 11-32 point and long-term issues rose as much as
13-32 point, according to Telerate Inc., the financial information
service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, was unavailable.
   In corporate trading, industrials rose. Moody's Investment Grade
Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of
80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose
0.08 to 330.24.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.19 percent as the
discount lost 8 basis points to 7.93 percent. Yields on six-month
bills fell to 7.98 percent as the discount fell 3 basis points to
7.58 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 7.81 percent as the
discount fell 7 basis points to 7.31 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.

   The stock market moved ahead in active trading
today amid optimism about the chances for lower interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 9.10 at 2,622.15
at noon on Wall Street.
   Advancing issues held a lead over declines of about 3 to 2 on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 799 up, 530 down and 516
unchanged.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.14 to 189.28. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 0.58 to 373.36.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 112.76 million shares at midday,
up from 89.31 million at the same point in the previous session.
   Signs that the Federal Reserve Board has further loosened its
hold on credit touched off a rally on Wall Street Wednesday that
accelerated with futures-related program trading. The market built
on the buying momentum today.
   The advance on Wednesday carried Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
index and the NYSE's composite index to record levels and brought
the Dow industrials to another post-crash high.
   The Fed was said to have signalled its more relaxed credit
posture by allowing the federal funds rate to move to 9 percent
from about 9\ percent recently. This key rate, which is the fee
that banks charge one another on overnight loans, is considered a
barometer of the central bank's credit policy. The view that the
economy needs the stimulation that lower interest rates would
provide was bolstered today by a Commerce Department report showing
the gross national product, the broadest gauge of economic
activity, expanded at a feeble 1.7 percent annual rate in the
April-June quarter.
   A surprise announcement today that Bristol-Myers Co. and Squibb
Corp. have agreed to merge in a stock-swap deal sparked interest in
pharmaceutical stocks. Squibb surged 23} to 111{ while
Bristol-Myers fell 3\ to 48| and both stocks were on the Big
Board's list of activel traded issues.
   Other heavily traded drug stocks included: Upjohn, up 1{ to 32~;
Syntex, up 1{ to 49}; Marion Laboratories, up [ to 35~; and,
Pfizer, up 2| to 63~.
   Among the blue chips, Philip Morris rose 1 to 157~, Procter &

   The Senate passed a $44.3 billion agriculture
spending bill for fiscal 1990 today that grants President Bush's
request to lift the cap on subsidy payments for commodity exports.
   The Senate, which approved the measure on a voice vote, must now
iron out its differences with the $42.1 billion agriculture measure
the House passed July 18. The House retained the $770 million cap
on the Export Enhancement Program.
   A report accompanying the bill prods the Food and Drug
Administration to do a more aggressive job in overseeing the food
labeling. It directs the agency to ``move forward'' in clarifying
definitions of terms such as ``lite,'' ``low-fat'' and ``natural.''
   The report also did not contain language that the House approved
ordering the FDA not to ban red dye No. 3 until long-range tests
are finished. The food coloring is considered a possible carcinogen.
   Report language is not legally binding, but federal agencies
generally respect such commands. If they do not, they risk angering
lawmakers who can seek retribution in future legislation.
   The Bush administration wants the ceiling removed, arguing that
it would improve U.S. leverage in the ongoing trade talks between
the United States and the European Economic Community.
   The House first adopted the cap last year. House Appropriations
Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten, D-Miss., has said he considers
the subsidy program to be a boon for large grain trading companies.
   The Senate legislation would also provide:
   _$4.9 billion for child nutrition programs, including $3.1
billion for school lunches, $561 million for school breakfasts and
$755 million for food for child care programs. That would be a $300
million increase over this year's levels.
   _$2.1 billion for food assistance to women, infants and
children, $100 million more than this year and than Bush sought.
   _$15.4 billion for food stamps, $1.6 billion above 1989 levels
and $1.3 billion more than Bush requested.
   _$11.6 billion for rural development and assistance programs,
$200 million above Bush's request.

   Prime Computer Inc. bondholders filed a lawsuit
seeking to extend the deadline for a $1.2 billion buyout offer from
J.H. Whitney &amp; Co. pending further disclosures about the deal, J.H.
Whitney said today.
   The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan, seeks to extend the offer until five days after J.H.
Whitney further disloses financing and other conditions of the
merger, the investment firm said in a statement.
   J.H. Whitney's buyout offer is due to expire at midnight Friday.
   The suit was filed by Conarb Partners, which holds 5} percent
convertible debentures, a common type of corporate bond, in Prime.
Whitney said the lawsuit is ``without merit'' but did not elaborate.
   Earlier this week, two banks asked J.H. Whitney to obtain
additional financing before they will back the friendly buyout of
Prime.
   Prime endorsed the takeover again Wednesday and also postponed
its annual shareholders meeting for a third time to give
shareholders a chance to review a hostile offer by MAI Basic Four
Inc. for Prime's minicomputer business.
   Before it adjourned, however, Prime announced a second-quarter
loss of $19 million due to lower revenues and costs incurred in its
battle to avoid a hostile takeover.
   The company said revenue fell from $408.4 million in the 1988
second quarter to $382 million. It reported $27.3 million in
non-recurring charges, including $20 million for its merger
agreement with Whitney and related legal fees.
   Without those expenses, Prime said it would have had income of
$10 million, a slight improvement over this year's first-quarter
results.
   Whitney emerged last month as a friendly suitor for the
Natick-based high-tech concern after Prime rebuffed an earlier bid
from MAI Basic, based in Tustin, Calif.
   Prime's board said the offer from Whitney, a New York investment
firm, is ``economically superior'' to MAI Basic's proposal to buy
Prime's minicomputer division for $450 million in cash and $150
million in notes.
   But Chemical Bank and the First National Bank of Boston told
Whitney on Tuesday to seek additional financing ``because of
Prime's recent performance,'' according to a statement by Whitney.
   Whitney attorney Robert Coultas declined to disclose how much
the company needs to raise to meet the banks' requirements.
   Whitney originally offered $21.50 a share in cash for 79 percent
of Prime's common stock. The remaining 21 percent would be
exchanged for bonds with a face value of $22 a share. On Wednesday,
Whitney extended the deadline for that offer to midnight Friday.
   A Bank of Boston spokesman refused to comment on the bank's
request for additional financing. A Chemical Bank spokesman could
not be reached for comment.
   Analysts said the banks' request may force Whitney to lower its
offer for Prime.
   Barry F. Willman, of New York-based Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.,
said the uncertainty surrounding the offer may continue to drive
Prime stock down.
   ``The stock has been dropping because of concern about the swift
completion of the deal,'' he said. ``The risk of the deal closing
seems higher than it did two days ago.''
   Prime stock was up $1 to $16.75 in early afternoon trading on
the New York Stock Exchange today.
   MAI Basic extended to midnight Thursday its deadline to pay
$19.50 in cash for 75 percent of Prime's shares and a package of
bonds and preferred stock for the remainder.
   Believing that deal would fail, MAI Basic recently offered to
take over Prime's minicomputer business, which accounted for about
one-third of Prime's 1988 revenue of $1.6 billion.
   Prime, which has about 11,000 employees, makes minicomputers and
is the second to International Business Machines Corp. in the
computer-aided design and manufacturing systems field. MAI Basic is
about one-quarter Prime's size.
   Prime postponed its annual shareholders meeting to Aug. 9 just
90 minutes before its scheduled start Wednesday. The meeting
previously had been scheduled for May 12 and June 15.

   Stock prices were sharply higher Thursday as the
market drew inspiration from a strong pound, a robust performance
on Wall Street and a renewal of speculative buying interest.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 19.2
points, or 0.8 percent, higher at 2,283.7 points, after touching a
session high of 2,287.4. At its lowest, the index stood at 2,274.2.
   Volume came to a mediocre 481.3 million shares, compared with
333.2 million shares Wednesday.
   A portion of the gain was also attributed to price hikes by
market makers, who interpreted the market's positive sentiment as
an excuse to push prices higher.
   ``The strong pound again revived hopes that the next move in
British interest rates will be downward,'' one trader said.

<HEAD>U.S. Stresses Commitment To GATT Negotiations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top U.S. trade official said Thursday the United
States wanted to solve its ``most vexing trade problems'' through
international talks rather than direct action against countries
with alleged unfair trade practices.
   Warren Lavorel told a meeting of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade that the Bush administration regarded the current
GATT round of trade-liberalizing talks as the ``last chance in this
century to make far reaching improvements in the way the world
trading system operates.''
   The meeting of negotiators from GATT's 96 member countries also
set the deadline for the end of the talks, which were launched in
Uruguay in 1986, GATT Director-General Arthur Dunkel said.
   Dunkel said a ministerial meeting to adopt the final package of
measures to liberalize international commerce would take place in
Brussels between Nov. 26 and Dec. 8, 1990.
   He told a press conference that completing agreements to cut
barriers to trade in agriculture, textiles and intellectual
property rights such as patents and trademarks would be the most
difficult as many governments would have to change domestic
policies to comply with the new rules.
   These areas caused stalemate when ministers met in Montreal last
December to assess progress at the halfway stage of the Uruguay
Round.
   Negotiators are also drawing up new agreements for tropical
products, services like travel and construction, tariffs and
subsidies that are alleged to distort trade.
   In a speech to the closed session of the GATT meeting, Lavorel
said the United States was committed to multilateral talks to solve
trade disputes.
   ``We remain firm in our intent to work through the Uruguay Round
in order to solve our most vexing trade problems. We view the
Uruguay Round as the preferred means of solving the very
troublesome and very real trade problems faced by U.S. industry and
agriculture,'' he said.
   A copy of the speech was made available to reporters.
   The United States was criticized by many countries for
undermining the GATT's multilateral principles when it announced in
May a hit list of three countries accused of being unfair traders.
   Citing a controversial section of the 1988 trade act, the Bush
administration threatened to take retaliatory action against Japan,
India and Brazil if they did not agree in bilateral talks to remove
the offending barriers to U.S. exports.
   In addition to drawing up trade-freeing agreements, GATT also
acts as a forum for settling disputes. Its members account for
four-fifths of world trade.

   Avon Products Inc. Thursday said it posted a
profit of $39.5 million, or 56 cents a share, in the second quarter
in contrast to a loss of $82.5 million for the period a year ago.
   The direct seller of beauty products said its second-quarter
sales rose 10.4 percent to $777.7 million from $704.3 million a
year earlier.
   The company's loss a year ago reflected losses on health care
businesses that either have been or are being sold.
   Earnings from continuing operations rose 10.1 percent to $39.5
million from $35.9 million a year earlier.
   James E. Preston, Avon's chairman and chief executive, said the
second-quarter gains reflect the strength of its international
business, particularly in Latin America where Mexico and Brazil
were leading contributors.
   Avon's international direct selling division had a 27 percent
increase in pretax profit on a 14.3 percent sales gain, while
domestic direct selling had a 10.5 percent pretax profit increase
on a 2.4 percent rise in sales.
   Sales were up 35.7 percent in its retail prestige fragrance
division but had a modest pretax loss as it continued to roll out
new fragrances.
   Avon said its overall unit sales for the quarter rose 11.4
percent, including a 3.2 percent decline in U.S. direct selling, a
25.1 percent rise in international direct selling and a 29 percent
rise in retailing.
   The company said sales lagged in the U.S. because of ``the
distraction in the field sales force caused by a takeover proposal
and rumors during the quarter.''
   Avon fought off an unsolicited $2.1 billion takeover bid from
another direct-selling company, Amway Corp., earlier this year.
Avon's board rejected the bid and Amway withdrew its offer.
   For the first six months, Avon reported a profit of $45.7
million, or 51 cents a share, on sales of $1.48 billion in contrast
to a loss of $55.3 million on sales of $1.33 billion a year earlier.

   Black Americans still lag far behind whites in
economic and social status, according to a report released today
that says the pace of improvements begun 50 years ago has slowed
dramatically since the early 1970s.
   ``The great gulf that existed between black and white Americans
in 1939 has only been narrowed; it has not closed,'' said the
report by a National Research Council committee.
   Study director Gerald Jaynes, a Yale University professor of
economics and African-American studies, said persistent negative
attitudes towards blacks and the disadvantaged conditions in which
many of them live have held hampered their progress.
   ``A legacy of discrimination and segregation continues to affect
black-white relations,'' Jaynes said.
   The $2.7 million study, entitled A Common Destiny: Blacks in
American Society, was financed privately by several foundations and
charitable organizations.
   Blacks made their greatest gains during the 1940s and 1960s, but
since the early 1970s ``the economic status of blacks relative to
whites has, on average, stagnated or deteriorated,'' the report
said.
   The report said the gains have come chiefly because of a rapidly
growing economy that improved the living standard of Americans
overall, passage and enforcement of civil rights laws, equal
opportunity efforts and political and social activism by blacks.
   The slowdown in the U.S. economy since 1973 has taken a bite
from the real earnings of all Americans. But it also has increased
inequality by hitting hardest the least skilled and those with the
lowest incomes _ a clear setback for many lower-income blacks, the
report said.
   Blacks have also been hurt by continued racial segregation and
racial discrimination, the report said.
   ``Under conditions of increasing economic hardship for the least
prosperous members of society, blacks, because of their special
legacy of poverty and discrimination, are afflicted sooner, more
deeply and longer,'' the report said.
   The report discounts the popular notion that blacks are consumed
by a self-perpetuating ``culture of poverty,'' saying attitudes
toward work and the desire to succeed are about the same among the
poor and the better off.
   While whites want racial equality in social institutions and in
government policy, ``many whites are less likely to espouse or
practice equality of treatment for blacks in their personal
behavior,'' the report said.
   ``Full assimilation of blacks in a `color blind' society is
unlikely in any foreseeable future,'' it said, but added that
``integrated participation in public affairs is become more
acceptable.''
   The study, begun in 1985, is based on data and research analyses
assessing the position of blacks in American society since the eve
of World War II. The 22-member study committee included experts in
a range of academic specialties.
   Blacks gained in income and earnings through the 1950s and 1960s
relative to whites, but after that they saw few economic gains, the
report said.
   Measured in 1984 dollars, mean earnings for black men were
$3,833 in 1939 compared with $8,745 for whites. By 1979, the figure
for blacks rose to $15,160 and $23,032 for whites. But in 1984,
that dropped to $13,218 for blacks compared to $20,457 for whites.
   Among women, blacks have all but closed the earnings gap. Mean
earnings, as measured in 1984 dollars, have risen from $2,070 for
blacks and $5,192 for whites in 1939 to $10,252 for blacks and
$10,354 for whites in 1984.
   Since 1939, the gap between the races in terms of poverty has
remained relatively constant _ black poverty rates have been two to
three times higher than rates for whites.
   Among other findings:
   _Political Participation: The proportion of federal, state and
local public administrators who are black has risen from less than
1 percent in 1940 to 8 percent in 1980. Blacks comprise 13 percent
of the U.S. population.
   _Education: ``Segregation and differential treatment of blacks
continue to be widespread in the elementary and secondary
schools,'' the report said. Also, the odds that a black high school
student will go to college within a year of graduation are less
than half the odds for a white student.
   _Health: Infant mortality rates for blacks and whites have
dropped steadily since 1940, but a black remains twice as likely to
die in infancy as a white baby.
   _Crime: Nearly half of all prison inmates in the United States
are black, and blacks are six to seven times as likely as whites to
be victims of homicide, which is the leading cause of death among
young black males. Blacks are also twice as likely to be victims of
robbery, car theft and aggravated assault.
   _Children: In 1986, 43 percent of black children under 18
compared with 16 percent of white children lived in households with
incomes below the federal poverty line. About half of all black
children live in single-parent, female-headed households, compared
with one in five white children.
   The National Research Council is the principle operating agency
of the National Academies of Sciences and Engineering, a
congressionally chartered, private non-profit organization.

   Digital Equipment Corp.'s net income
dipped 22 percent in the fourth quarter, and the company pointed to
``lackluster'' conditions in the United States as a factor in its
performance.
   Digital President Kenneth H. Olsen also noted that the strong
dollar is depressing markets overseas.
   ``Both discretionary spending and capital spending plans are
being adjusted to reflect current market conditions,'' Olsen said.
   For the fourth quarter, net income was $313.2 million, or $2.51
a share, on revenues of $3.49 billion, down from $401 million, or
$3.08 a share, on revenues of $3.3 billion for the same period last
year.
   Net income for all of 1989 fell 18 percent to $1.072 billion, or
$8.45 a share, from $1.305 billion, or $9.90 a share, in 1988.
Revenue rose 11 percent to $12.7 billion from $11.5 billion.
   The high-tech company, based in Maynard, Mass., is continuing to
make investments in research and development for new products and
software, Olsen said.
   The company has also slowed hiring and cut back on discretionary
spending, said Mark Steinkrauss, a company spokesman.
   ``It's been a poor market for the industry,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
higher Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a modest,
technically inspired recovery from the steep declines that occurred
earlier this week.
   The rally marked the first day-to-day advance in the soybean
market in more than a week.
   But experts said the rally had no grounding in supply-and-demand
factors, and that rainy weather forecasts for the Midwest and signs
of a slowdown in grain exports would probably press prices back
into a downward course.
   ``This was a technical bounce, a technical correction,'' said
Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Chicago. ``Everything is still fundamentally bearish.''
   At the close, wheat was 1\ cents to 6 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.89{ a bushel; corn was 2}
cents to 4} cents higher with September at $2.32\ a bushel; oats
were unchanged to 1{ cents lower with September at $1.42} a bushel;

   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. has agreed to buy the
Fisher Nut snack company from Chicago-based Beatrice Co., the
companies announced.
   P&amp;G and Beatrice declined to disclose the sale price, but
industry analysts placed it at about $150 million. Approval for the
deal, which was announced Wednesday, must be obtained from the
Federal Trade Commission.
   P&amp;G executives said the transaction will allow the
Cincinnati-based company to expand on its experience in marketing
peanut butter and salted snacks.
   Fisher Nut produces a wide variety of nuts and has annual sales
of slightly more than $100 million. The sale includes manufacturing
plants in St. Paul, Minn., and Edenton, N.C., and affects 375
employees company officials said.
   Fisher Nut is a unit of Beatrice-Hunt-Wesson Inc., a division of
Beatrice Co.
   Beatrice in June announced plans to sell Fisher Nut. The FTC
called for the sale after Beatrice's largest shareholder _ New York
buyout specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. _ bought RJR
Nabisco Inc. and its Planters nut business.
   Federal regulators said Kohlberg Kravis could not control the
nation's top two nut companies. Planters controls about 50 percent
of the $1.2 billion nut market, while Fisher controls about 11
percent.

   The stock market bounded ahead today as signals
pointing to lower interest rates encouraged investors to buy a
broad range of issues.
   The market built on the buying momentum triggered Wednesday by
signs that the Federal Reserve Board is allowing more money to feed
into the banking system in an apparent bid to pump up economic
activity.
   The Fed revealed a more relaxed credit posture by allowing the
federal funds rate to move to 9 percent from about 9\ percent
recently. This key rate, which is the fee that banks charge one
another on overnight loans, is considered a barometer of the
central bank's credit policy.
   The view that the economy needs the stimulation that lower
interest rates would provide was bolstered today by a Commerce
Department report showing the gross national product, the broadest
gauge of economic activity, expanded at a feeble 1.7 percent annual
rate in the April-June quarter.
   John D. Connolly, chairman of the investment committee at Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc., said the GNP reading wasn't bad enough to fan
recession fears.
   ``It was weak but we're not talking negative,'' he said. ``Just
under 2 percent, that's not particularly frightening.''
   Besides upbeat feelings about interest rates, a number of forces
helped carry the market aloft. Health care and drug stocks
attracted significant investor interest, sparked by a surprise
announcement that Bristol-Myers and Squibb have agreed to merge in
a stock-swap deal.

<HEAD>Dutch Investors, With Long History, Rank Third In U.S. Direct Investment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They bought Calvin Klein fragrances this month.
They bought a Chicago bank this week. The Dutch _ yes, the Dutch _
rank third in direct investment in the United States.
   The long history of Dutch investment in America dates back even
before Peter Minuit bought Manhattan island from the Indians for
the equivalent of $24, mainly in trinkets.
   Dutch investors' hard assets in the United States had a book
value of $49 billion at the end of last year, trailing only the
British at $102 billion and the Japanese at $53 billion.
   The Dutch investments are low-profile, concentrated in a handful
of companies that most Americans do not even think of as foreign _
Shell Oil Co., North American Philips Corp. and Lever Brothers.
   Moreover, the Netherlands is not perceived as a foreign trade
threat in the same way as fast-rising Japan. Holland is one of the
few countries with which the United States usually has a trade
surplus, owing to Dutch imports of raw materials for food products
and chemicals.
   The Netherlands was the No. 1 foreign investor in the late
1970s, falling to second behind Britain in 1982. It fell to third
behind Japan last year, according to U.S. Commerce Department
statistics.
   The figures are for direct investment _ that is, factories,
office buildings, real estate and the like, rather than paper
holdings such as Treasury bonds.
   In the latest major transaction, Algemene Bank Nederland NV said
this week it would buy Chicago's Exchange Bancorp Inc. holding
company for $420 million cash.
   Unilever _ maker of Vaseline, Q-Tips, Lipton, All detergent and
Pond's cold cream _ agreed earlier this month to buy Calvin Klein
fragrancies for $306 million.
   Unilever has dual headquarters in Britain and the Netherlands.
The two countries divide credit for its $6.5 billion in U.S. assets.
   NV Philips, whose U.S. operations date to 1933, employs 52,000
people in the United States and has U.S. assets of $3.8 billion.
   Those two companies are dwarfed, at least in assets, by Royal
Dutch-Shell Group, which has U.S. assets of more than $27 billion.
The company is 60 percent Dutch-owned and 40 percent British-owned,
so the Netherlands does not get full credit for the U.S. assets.
   Holland is a trading nation whose companies get along in their
host countries by being inconspicuous. That is becoming more
difficult with the rising tide of emotion over foreign investment.
   Philips, in particular, feels unfairly treated by the
government's decision to exclude it from federal research grants
for development of high-definition television.
   Televisions made by Philips under such labels as Magnavox and
Sylvania actually have a higher percentage of domestic content than
televisions made by Zenith Electronics Corp., the American maker.
   Moreover, North American Philips Corp. is contributing to
American knowhow with research facilities in New York and
California and recently was listed as one of the top 100 U.S.-based
exporters.
   ``We feel strongly that we are making an important contribution
as a responsible corporate citizen of the United Sates and we feel
we should be permitted to join these research consortia,'' said
Albert Ruttner, a vice president of North American Philips.
   Houston-based Shell Oil Co., the U.S. arm of Royal Dutch-Shell,
portrays itself as an American company. Only two of its 10 board
members are from the parent. It has its own overseas operations, in
fact, in 13 countries ranging from Syria to Argentina.

   Assets of the nation's 467 money market mutual
funds rose by $1.85 billion in the latest week to a new all-time
record of $332.78 billion, the Investment Company Institute said
Thursday.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday broke the
record set a week earlier, when the assets rose a revised $2.79
billion to $330.93 billion, the Washington-based mutual fund trade
group said. That weekly gain initially was reported as $2.69
billion.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 231 general purpose funds rose $554.8 million to $105.96
billion, assets of 95 broker-dealer funds rose $1.60 billion to
$142.03 billion, and assets of 142 institutional funds declined
$313.2 million to $84.79 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.60 percent from 8.66 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 8.73 percent from 8.79 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
41 days, down from 42 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and savings banks in
the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield
available on money market accounts fell to 6.51 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.52 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, fell to 5.12 percent from 5.14 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.47
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 8.52
percent the previous week. Yields were 8.47 percent on 1-year CDs,
down from 8.52 percent; 8.35 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.41
percent; and 8.33 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.37 percent.

   The federal jury hearing the
securities-racketeering case against former officials of
Princeton-Newport Partners LP began deliberations Thursday.
   The jury in U.S. District Court in Manhattan got the case in the
late afternoon after hearing a four-hour instruction on the law
from Judge Robert Carter.
   The five-week trial is the first racketeering case ever
involving securities trading.
   The defendants are accused of conspiring to create illegitimate
tax losses through a series of prearranged securities transactions.
They contended the stock transactions were legal.
   On trial are five officials of the defunct investment
partnership and former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. trader Bruce Lee
Newberg. The case overlaps the government's indictment of former
Drexel financier Michael Milken.
   The defendants who worked for Princeton-Newport are James Sutton
Regan, the managing general partner; Jack Rabinowitz, Charles
Zarzecki and Paul Berkman, all general partners; and Steven
Smotrich, the firm's former comptroller.

   The dollar ended higher against most major
currencies Thursday despite a government report showing
slower-than-expected economic growth from April through June.
   The dollar initially fell in reaction to the report that the
gross national product grew at a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.7
percent, less than the predicted 2 percent growth.
   But the dollar snapped back during later U.S. trading, partly
because it had been oversold in advance of the report, said Zlatko
Glamuzina, chief currency dealer of Banco di Sicilia in New York.
   ``It was more of the old Wall Street saying, sell on
expectations, buy on confirmation,'' Glamuzina said.
   Also buoying the dollar was hope for a continued rally in the
stock and bond markets, he said.
   The Japanese yen rose against the dollar, mainly because of
rising confidence in Japanese political stability. Most of the
yen's rise came at the expense of the West German mark.
   In Tokyo the dollar fell to 139.35 Japanese yen from 141.43. In
London late Thursday the dollar traded lower at 138.90 yen. Later
in New York the dollar traded at 139.25 yen, down from 140.08 on
Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound cost $1.6598, more expensive for
buyers than Wednesday's late $1.6455. In New York the pound fell to
$1.6540 from $1.6585 on Wednesday.
   The pound has gained 10 cents against the dollar over the past
seven weeks and 4 cents of that this week, indicating steady buying
of sterling despite ports and railroad strikes.
   British base interest rates stand at 14 percent, making the
pound attractive to investors.
   Other late rates for the dollar in the United States compared
with Wednesday's late rates included: 1.8785 West German marks, up
from 1.8680; 1.6150 Swiss francs, up from 1.6060; 1.1836 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1837; 6.3605 French francs, up from 6.3255;
and 1,351.6 Italian lire, up from 1,342. Other late rates for the
dollar in Europe compared with Wednesday's late rates: 1.8692 West
German marks, down from 1.8735; 1.6075 Swiss francs, down from
1.6115; 6.3310 French francs, down from 6.3475; 2.1085 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.1190; 1,346.00 Italian lire, down from
1,352.50; 1.1827 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1872.
   Gold bullion prices were mixed in slack dealings.
   Gold closed in London, the major market, at a bid $374.00 a troy
ounce, up from $373.25. The closing price in Zurich at $374.05 bid
was down from Wednesday's $374.50.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $374.15 bid, up from
$371.85.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $373.70 an ounce from $374.90. Later, Republic
National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $372.90 as of 4 p.m.
EDT, down from $374.10 late Wednesday.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $5.23 a troy
ounce, up from $5.22. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery fell to $5.217 an ounce from $5.224.

   Nissan employees voted overwhelmingly
Thursday to keep the United Auto Workers out of their plant,
denying the union a foothold in the nation's fully Japanese-owned
auto factories.
   ``They can't give us anything we don't already have,'' worker
Dotty Lockhart said Thursday after employees voted 1,622 to 711
against the UAW at Nissan's sole U.S. plant.
   The balloting Wednesday and Thursday came after an 18-month
drive by the UAW and was seen as a test of union muscle and a
challenge to automakers' strategy of locating plants in the
traditionally anti-union South.
   The union effort also represented a challenge to Japanese-style
team management and Japanese industry's reputation for enlightened
labor relations.
   ``It was like someone was trying to divide our family,'' worker
Redgie Gentry said of the organizing drive at the 6-year-old plant,
where pickups and Sentra cars are made.
   After the vote, the UAW accused Nissan of misrepresentation and
intimidation to keep out the union, including ``captive audience''
meetings and a barrage of anti-union videos on the plant TV system,
in which the automaker warned employees would lose benefits if the
union won.
   Jerry Benefield, president of Nissan Motor Manufacturing U.S.A.,
denied any intimidation and said he was elated by the more than
2-to-1 margin of victory.
   ``I think the results of this election are very strong support
for the participatory management philosophy here at the company and
we're very happy we're going to continue that,'' he said.
   Workers at the $760 million plant 30 miles southeast of
Nashville have embraced Japanese-style management, in which they
have a say in production and the shop floor is organized into teams
whose members rotate tasks as often as every two hours.
   But the UAW, which forced the vote by gathering signatures from
33 percent of Nissan's 2,400 assembly-line employees, claimed that
the line runs at a breakneck speed, injuring an estimated 18
percent of the workers.
   The grievance could not overcome pocketbook issues in this
so-called right-to-work state, where union membership is optional
even at plants where the workers are represented by a union.
   The UAW represents workers at joint Japanese-American auto
plants but has no foothold in any of the three fully Japanese-owned
factories: Nissan, Toyota at Georgetown, Ky.; and Honda at
Marysville, Ohio. An effort to organize the Honda plant three years
ago was dropped before coming to a vote because of lack of support.
   ``It looks as if the Japanese-owned plants are going to stay
non-union,'' said David Healey, an auto analyst with Drexel Burnham
Lambert. ``As long as Japanese-owned plants pay the same wages as
the unionized plants the workers aren't going to vote for the
union.''
   The vote was considered a showdown of sorts for the 1
million-member UAW, which has suffered a 33 percent decline in
membership since 1979.
   The UAW represents workers at a Mazda plant at Flat Rock, Mich.,
that also makes Fords; a joint Chrysler-Mitsubishi plant near
Bloomington, Ill., and a General Motors-Toyota factory at Fremont,
Calif.
   In a statement, UAW President Owen Bieber, Vice President Stan
Marshall and Regional Director George Smith said: ``All this
election demonstrates is that when a company is determined to
operate without a union and is willing to use threats and
misrepresentation to an unlimited extent, that company can delay if
not escape its day of reckoning.''
   ``We're going to come back,'' said Charlie Holt, a Nissan
quality assurance worker who took part in the UAW organizing drive.
``We took a little thumping in round one. But we found out we have
711 strong union people, or a third of the plant.''
   Benefield said the vote demonstrates ``this is a safe place to
work,'' but he refused, as Nissan has done all along, to release
the plant's injury logs.
   Nissan has produced more than 1 million vehicles at the plant
since June 1983. A third model is expected to be added in 1992,
creating 2,000 more jobs.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Sink To 13-Year Low; Free-Market Shakeout Goes On</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices sank to their lowest level in more than 13
years Thursday on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange as a
market shakeout stemming from the suspension of export quotas
continued.
   On other markets, soybean futures rallied, ending a five-day
slide; crude oil futures fell for the fifth straight session;
precious metals retreated; and livestock and meat futures were
mixed.
   Green, unroasted coffee beans settled 1.22 cents to 1.93 cents
lower with the contract for delivery in September at 83.44 cents a
pound, the lowest price for a near-month coffee futures contract
since early 1976.
   Analysts said the price drop reflected aggressive new selling of
coffee by Mexico, Brazil and Indonesia in a bid to increase their
shares of the recently freed market and empty warehouses before
new-crop coffee hits the market.
   Coffee futures prices have fallen more than 25 percent since
July 3, when the 74-nation International Coffee Organization
suspended export quotas and coffee became a free market.
   Since then, the world's largest coffee-growing nations have been
fighting for market share by dropping their asking prices and
encouraging exporters to sell as much coffee as they can.
   During this week alone, Colombia announced subsidies enabling
exporters to sell Colombian coffee at prices below production cost
and Mexico said it planned to sell 3.4 million 132-pound bags of
coffee in the third quarter.
   ``Under the quota system they would have sold around 1 million
bags,'' said Esther Eskanasy, a coffee market analyst in New York
with Cargill Investor Services Inc.
   ``With the new crop coming in less than two months, most
producers are trying to make up volume instead of price,'' she said.
   Analyst Arthur Stevenson of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
said mild winter weather in Brazil, the world's largest coffee
producer, added to the bearish sentiment. And he said the market
was ignoring a planned weekend meeting of South American leaders at
which coffee prices could be discussed.
   Most grain and soybean futures prices advanced on the Chicago
Board of Trade in a modest, technically inspired recovery from
steep declines earlier this week.
   The rally marked the first day-to-day advance in the soybean
market in more than a week.
   But experts said the rally had no basis in supply-and-demand
reality, and that rainy weather forecasts for the Midwest and signs
of a slowdown in grain exports would probably press prices back
into a downward course.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 6 cents higher with September at
$3.89} a bushel; corn was 3 cents to 4} cents higher with September
at $2.32{ a bushel; oats 1{ cents lower to \ cent higher with
September at $1.43 a bushel; soybeans were 3\ cents to 6\ cents
higher with August at $6.68 a bushel.
   Crude-oil futures fell to a five-month low amid persistent
pessimism on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The market rallied
early with the September contract's price climbing as high as
$18.64 a barrel. But prices plunged in a late sell-off that
accelerated when September fell below $18.25.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 10 cents to 18 cents
lower with September at $18.12 a barrel; heating oil was .23 cent
to .53 cent lower with August at 49.26 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .03 cent to .64 cent higher with August at 51.98 cents
a gallon.
   Gold and silver futures edged lower on New York's Commodity
Exchange, wiping the modest gains of the previous session.
   Gold settled $1.30 to $1.50 lower with August at $373.70 a troy
ounce; silver was .07 cent to 1.5 cents lower with September at
$5.263.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle settled .12 cent
to .30 cent lower with August at 72.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle
were .15 cent to .50 cent lower with August at 83.07 cents a pound;
live hogs were .17 cent lower to .40 cent higher with August at
46.32 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .18 cent lower to .30
cent higher with August at 26.92 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   Underscoring a consolidation in the drug
industry, Bristol-Myers Co. and Squibb Corp. said Thursday they
would merge in an $11 billion stock-swap deal that would create the
world's second-largest pharmaceutical concern.
   Under terms of a definitive agreementapproved by the boards of
both companies, Squibb will be merged into Bristol-Myers through a
tax-free exchange of 2.4 shares of Bristol-Myers common stock for
each Squibb share.
   Based on the current stock price of Bristol-Myers, maker of
Excedrin and Bufferin pain relievers and Clairol hair coloring
products, the deal is valued at $11.4 billion.
   The merged company will be known as Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.,
and will offer such consumer products as Bufferin and Excedrin pain
relievers, Windex window cleaner and Theragran vitamins, plus a
variety of prescription drugs.
   The deal, subject to shareholder approval, is expected to be
completed in October.
   The companies also agreed to give Bristol-Myers the option to
acquire nearly 20 percent of Squibb's outstanding common shares at
$123.90 a share. Such options, commonly known as ``lock-up''
options, often are used to discourage competing bidders.
   With annual revenue exceeding $8.6 billion, Bristol-Myers Squibb
will be one of the largest drug and consumer products companies,
although its sales of pharmaceuticals alone still will trail
Rahway, N.J.-based Merck &amp; Co.
   Bristol-Myers has some 34,000 employees worldwide and Squibb has
about 18,000.
   Following the announcement, Squibb stock skyrocketed on the New
York Stock Exchange. The stock began rising last week on rumors
that the company might be acquired by Glaxo Holdings PLC, sources
said, following the defection of a top Squibb executive to the
British pharmaceuticals concern.
   Squibb finished up $24.75 a share at $112.50 in heavy trading;
Bristol-Myers was off $2.37{ at $49.50 a share.
   The announcement also boosted the stocks of other drug companies
on speculation they also might be considering mergers. Among
gainers, Upjohn rose $1.62{ to $33; Abbott Laboratories, rose $2 to
$64.87{; Pfizer rose $2.50 to $63.75 and Merck, a component of the
Dow Jones industrial average, rose $2.25 to $77.87{.
   While the emergence of Bristol-Myers was somewhat of a surprise,
the combination affirms a recent trend in the highly competitive
and expense-laden drug industry.
   On Wednesday, shareholders of Philadelphia-based SmithKline
Beckman Corp. approved a merger with Beecham Group PLC of Britain,
creating a company with more than $6 billion in combined annual
sales. Last week, Dow Chemical Co. it would acquired a majority
stake in Marion Laboratories Inc.
   Pharmaceutical companies must pump increasingly larger sums into
their research and development operations if they are to be
successful in creating drugs to treat complex disorders like AIDS
and cancer.
   Together, Bristol-Myers and Squibb spent more than $600 million
on medical R&amp;D last year.
   Squibb, whose business is almost exclusively limited to
prescription drugs, is an industry leader with Capoten, a
cardiovascular drug that brought in more than $1 billion in sales
last year, analysts said. The company also is awaiting Federal Drug
Administration approval for Pravachol, a cholesterol-control
product with a potentially enormous market.
   ``Given Squibb's smaller size, it's ability to have introduced
Capoten before anybody else speaks very well for its R&amp;D
capabilities,'' said Stuart Levine, a vice president at Gruntal &amp;
Co.
   While Bristol-Myers has a strong market position with its
anti-cancer and AIDS development drugs, pharmaceuticals account for
less than half of its revenue. A number of well-known
over-the-counter brands like Comtrex and Nuprin and consumer
products like Sea Breeze and Ban antiperspirant give Bristol-Myers
a broader base.
   ``Its biggest strength is its diversity,'' said Juan Noble, an
analyst with Argus Research. Although its consumer products like
Drano, Windex and Renuzit are ``lower-margin than drugs ... they do
add a great measure of stability and give it breadth that investors
look for when things start to get tough.''
   Analysts characterized the price of the deal as fair, although
the sharp rise in Squibb stock indicated the company had been
undervalued. Although drug companies had performed well over the
past year, their stocks faded in recent months as the dollar's rise
_ which makes their products less competitive in foreign markets _
alarmed investors.
   Levine said investors failed to consider that ``most large,
finanically stronger pharmaceutical companies had built-in leverage
against the dollar's rise'' and quickly could cut back on expenses
like advertising if needed.
   In a joint statement, the companies said Squibb would retain its
identity and continue marketing its products under the Squibb name.
The company's headquarters will remain in Princeton, N.J.
   Richard M. Furlaud, Squibb's chairman and chief executive, will
serve as president of the merged company; Bristol-Myers Chairman
and Chief Executive Richard L. Gelb will serve as chairman and
chief executive.
   Furlaud and Gelb said in a statement, ``We are confident that by
combining our respective strengths in pharmaceuticals, health care,
consumer products and nutrition, we will create an even stronger
competitor in the health care industry of the 1990s.''
   While spokespeople for the two companies declined to comment on
when merger talks got under way, Gelb said in a statement, ``As we
met over the past three years to discuss pharmaceutical industry
matters, we were struck by the number of important similarities
between our two companies.''

<HEAD>Detroit Free Press Publisher To Head Miami Herald</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Knight-Ridder Inc. on Thursday named Detroit Free
Press Publisher and Chairman David Lawrence Jr. as publisher and
chairman of The Miami Herald, succeeding Richard G. Capen Jr.
   Capen was named vice chairman of parent Knight-Ridder. Free
Press President Robert J. Hall will succeed Lawrence as publisher
and chairman of the Detroit newspaper, the nation's 10th-largest.
   The appointments are effective Sept. 1, said P. Anthony Ridder,
president of Miami-based Knight-Ridder's newspaper division.
   Capen, a director of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau, has been
publisher of the Herald since 1983. He joined Knight-Ridder in 1979
as senior vice president for operations and previously was an
executive with Copley Newspapers.
   Lawrence, 47, came to the Free Press as executive editor in 1978
and has been publisher and chairman since 1985. He previously was
executive editor of the Charlotte Observer.
   Lawrence has headed the Free Press during its struggle since
1986 for a cost-cutting joint operating agreement with The Detroit
News, owned by Gannett Co.
   He called the effort by the 2,000 Free Press employees to
continue operating during that time ``the best untold story in
American newspapering today.''
   ``I would not go if I were not confident of Knight-Ridder's
commitment to this newspaper,'' he said.
   Knight-Ridder Chairman Alvah Chapman has said repeatedly that
the company would close the 158-year-old Free Press if the merger
attempt failed.
   The U.S. Supreme Court said in May it would review the joint
operating agreement request. A ruling on the limited antitrust
exemption for the two newspapers is expected next year.
   Lawrence said he never intended to stay at the Free Press under
a JOA, though he planned to remain until the issue was decided.
   ``For two years now, I have known that I would be the publisher
of the Miami Herald. With the Supreme Court's decision in May to
take the case, delaying a final resolution until next year, the
people at Knight-Ridder and I spoke anew about a timetable,''
Lawrence said.
   The Herald has a smaller circulation than the Free Press but is
a traditional Knight-Ridder profit center esteemed in the
organization, said John Morton, newspaper analyst with Lynch Jones
&amp; Ryan.
   The Herald faces strong competition in areas such as Fort
Lauderdale and West Palm Beach while Spanish language newspapers
are vying for readers Miami, Morton said.
   ``It is clearly the most challenging of the newspaper operations
Knight-Ridder has right now,'' he said. ``This probably is a vote
of confidence. They want some of their most capable people trying
to do battle in Miami.''
   The Detroit News, the nation's ninth-largest newspaper, and the
Free Press, seek government permission to merge business operations
while keeping editorial operations separate.
   According to Audit Bureau of Circulation figures for Sept. 30,
1988, the most recent available, the Herald has a circulation of
449,159 daily and 499,515 Sunday, while the Free Press has a daily
circulation of 629,065 and Sunday circulation of 710,112.

   Stock prices bounded ahead in brisk trading
Thursday as the latest drug industry merger and optimism about the
chances for lower interest rates brought buyers flocking into the
market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed at a new
post-crash high of 2,635.43, up 22.38, producing a gain of 52.35
points for the past two sessions.
   Various measures of activity in the broader market reached
record levels. The composite index of all common stocks listed on
the New York Stock Exchange rose 2.08 to 190.22, an all-time high.
The American Stock Exchange's market value index also set a record.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board surged to 213.68 million
shares from 188.27 million in the previous session.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,021 up, 496 down and 483 unchanged.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 252.37 million shares.
   The market built on the buying momentum triggered Wednesday by
signs that the Federal Reserve Board is allowing more money to feed
into the banking system in an apparent bid to pump up economic
activity.
   The Fed revealed a more relaxed credit posture by allowing the
federal funds rate to move to 9 percent from about 9\ percent
recently. This key rate, which is the fee that banks charge one
another on overnight loans, is considered a barometer of the
central bank's credit policy.
   The view that the economy needs the stimulation that lower
interest rates would provide was bolstered by a Commerce Department
report showing the gross national product, the broadest gauge of
economic activity, expanded at a feeble 1.7 percent annual rate in
the April-June quarter.
   John D. Connolly, chairman of the investment committee at Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc., said the GNP reading wasn't bad enough to fan
recession fears.
   ``It was weak but we're not talking negative,'' he said. ``Just
under 2 percent, that's not particularly frightening.''
   Besides upbeat feelings about interest rates, a number of forces
helped carry the market aloft. Health care and drug stocks
attracted significant investor interest, sparked by a surprise
announcement that Bristol-Myers and Squibb have agreed to merge in
a stock-swap deal.
   Squibb soared 24} to 112{ while Bristol-Myers dropped 2] to 49{
and was the most heavily stock on the Big Board with more than 4.5
million shares changing hands.
   Other gainers among the drug and health care stocks included:
Upjohn, up 1| to 33; Abbott Laboratories, up 2 to 64~; Pfizer, up
2{ to 63}; Warner Lambert, up 1 to 108; Syntex, up 1} to 50; and
Merck, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, up 2\ to
77~.
   Another blue chip gainer that helped boost the Dow Jones
industrial average was USX which jumped 2 to 37[ on volume of more
about 2.68 million shares. Elsewhere among the blue chips, American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph added 1\ to 40|, International Business
Machines gained { to 113 and Eastman Kodak rose 1{ to 48}.
   Chrysler, which announced a $1 billion cost-cutting program due
to sagging sales, fell 1\ to 24~.
   General Motors moved ahead by ] to 45[ despite reporting a 3.9
percent drop in second-quarter income. Ford, which said its
earnings were off 15.6 percent, rose ] to 50[.
   Security Pacific was among the most heavily traded NYSE-listed
issues and closed 1[ higher at 51{.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $34.66 billion, or
1.05 percent, in value.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 4.56 to 391.87, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index went up 3.94 at 341.99.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
increased 3.36 to 452.48. At the American Stock Exchange, the
market value index closed at a record 375.35, up 2.57.

   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended July 17 while a narrower measure
fell, the Federal Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose $4.7 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $3,123.7 billion from $3,119.0 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose $1.1 billion to a seasonally
adjusted $4,009.1 billion from $4,008.0 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell $1.6 billion
to a seasonally adjusted $777.5 billion from $779.1 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3.087.7 billion, a 1.7
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $3,971.0 billion, up 3.2 percent, while M1
fell 5.4 percent to an average of $775.2 billion.
   The Fed's annual growth target range for M2 is 3 percent to 7
percent and it is 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent for M3. The Fed has
not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said bank borrowings from
the Federal Reserve System at the discount window, excluding
extended credit, averaged $620 million a day in the week ended
Wednesday, up from $563 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $289.7 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, down from $292.3 billion two weeks earlier.

   Oil futures prices slipped to a five-month low
Thursday, reflecting concern over falling demand and excess crude
production.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the September contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,
fell 18 cents to close at $18.12 a 42-gallon barrel after trading
as high as $18.64.
   The near-term contract last closed lower on Feb. 24, at a price
of $18.07 a barrel. Contracts for later delivery had slightly
smaller losses.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded gasoline
for August delivery fell 0.64 cent to finish at 51.98 cents a
gallon. The September contract closed even lower at 51.01 cents a
gallon, down 0.83 cent.
   Domestic heating oil for delivery in August closed 0.23 cent
lower at 49.26 cents a gallon, while contracts for later delivery
this year recorded bigger declines.
   Crude prices have fallen steadily since early last week,
pressured by falling gasoline prices and rising crude oil
production in the face of slackening demand.
   Although statistics from the American Petroleum Institute showed
an overall decline in crude oil supplies, analysts said there was a
buildup in some key areas, including the Gulf of Mexico.
   ``There was almost a 4 million barrel build in the Gulf Coast,''
said John Hill, energy analyst with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
``There was a big draw on the West Coast, but the Gulf Coast is
where most of the refiners are. Frankly, people are saying that
there's lots of crude oil out there.''
   In addition, an estimate this week put OPEC production at more
than 21.2 million barrels per day, higher than the 19.5 million
barrel quota the cartel set for the second half of 1989.
   Gasoline prices have softened recently, reflecting what some
analysts say is consumer reaction to the surge in prices at the
retail pump.

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tenneco Inc.'s second quarter earnings rose 17
percent, an improvement that reflects the success of the firm's
restructuring, the company said Thursday.
   Net income for the three-month period was $180 million, or $1.38
per share, compared with $154 million, or $1.00 per share for the
1988 second quarter. The 1988 results included $37 million from
discontinued operations.
   Revenue increased 11 percent, totaling $3.7 billion for the 1989
second quarter, and $3.3 billion a year ago.
   ``The results from the second quarter are very encouraging and
substantiate the soundness of our restructuring activities,'' said
James L. Ketelsen, Tenneco's chairman and chief executive officer.
   The Houston-based company got out of the oil business last year
with the sale of its oil and gas operations. Before the sale, it
was the 10th largest U.S. oil company.
   Tenneco now is involved in the manufacture and sale of farm and
construction equipment, automotive parts and chemicals and
minerals. Its businesses also include shipbuilding, packaging and a
natural gas pipeline.
   For the first six months of 1989, Tenneco's earnings were $289
million, or $2.20 per share, a 33 percent increase from $217
million, or $1.38 a share, posted in the same 1988 period.

   The Senate agreed to release the first federal
construction funds for a planned atom smasher on Thursday, a $4.4
billion project that Texans are counting on to bring jobs and
revenues to their state and scientists to solve a few mysteries of
the universe.
   ``The implications for this investment in terms of
transportation and medicine and science and productivity, in
thousands of new products and millions of new jobs, cannot be
measured today,'' Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said before the measure
was approved on a voice vote.
   But an afternoon of routine consideration of a non-controversial
bill bogged down when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., proposed an
amendment delaying the new surtax on the elderly designed to pay
for much of the catastrophic care program for senior citizens.
   Many elderly people have complained that the surtax, which would
cost as much as $800 for the most well-to-do among them, is too
expensive.
   McCain's proposal sparked prolonged back room talks as Democrats
tried to determine how to persuade the Arizona lawmaker to withdraw
his amendment, or whether they could defeat him with a floor vote.
In an early evening vote, McCain was defeated 58-40.
   The money for the superconducting super collider, which is to be
built in Waxahachie, Texas, is part of an $18.4 billion spending
bill for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 for federal energy and
water programs.
   The legislation also includes $4.2 billion for water projects;
$9.6 billion for nuclear weapons programs, and $350 million to
study a potential high-level nuclear waste storage site in Yucca
Mountain, Nev.
   The bill provides $135 million to begin construction of the
super collider, and $90 million for research and development.
   The $225 million was $25 million more than the House provided
when it approved an $18.5 billion energy and water bill on June 28.
The two Houses will have to reconcile the difference.
   The Senate legislation would prohibit foreign countries from
building parts of the project unless Congress has reviewed the
potential assistance. Some lawmakers have expressed fears that
overseas firms would take business away from American contractors.
   The doughnut-shaped super collider, to be constructed
underground with a circumference of 53 miles, is to be used for
research.
   It would be the world's largest particle accelerator, capable of
hurtling two proton beams at each other at nearly the speed of
light with energies 20 times what is possible in the largest U.S.
accelerator. Scientists say their research could help them learn
about nature's most basic building blocks, for instance how matter
originated out of the pure energy of the postulated ``Big Bang''
beginning of the universe.
   The project, expected to take five to seven years to complete,
would create an anticipated 3,500 construction jobs and 2,500
permanent jobs. It would be built 25 miles south of Dallas.
   The legislation also provides $4.2 billion for the Army Corps of
Engineers, the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Bureau of
Reclamation for hundreds of flood control, irrigation, navigation,
conservation and recreation water projects.
   Of those, there are funds for the corps and the bureau to
commence work on 24 new construction projects. President Bush had
sought 11 new projects, while the House legislation financed 44 new
starts.
   The largest piece of the nuclear weapons spending is $4.6
billion set aside for research, testing and production.
   Another $1.6 billion _ $600 million more than this year _ is for
cleaning up nuclear waste at Department of Energy facilities.
   Also provided in the legislation is $150 million for the
Appalachian Regional Commission, which operates development
programs in the Appalachian region. The Bush administration
proposed terminating the agency, but the program is a favorite of
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.

   New Hampshire on Thursday conditionally
approved a $1.9 billion offer for the bankrupt Public Service
Company of New Hampshire, including the utility's share of the
troubled Seabrook nuclear power plant.
   Gov. Judd Gregg said the state reserved the right to accept a
better deal than the bid from Northeast Utilities, New England's
largest power company.
   Staggered by debt for the completed but unlicensed Seabrook
plant, Public Service sought Chapter 11 protection from creditors
in January 1988. It was the first major investor-owned utility to
enter bankruptcy since the Depression.
   A representative of some Public Service unsecured creditors
predicted the Northeast Utilities bid, while improving on the
utility's earlier offer that excluded Seabrook, would be turned
down by unsecured creditors unless it is further sweetened. And a
representative of Public Service stockholders called the offer
``woefully inadequate.''
   The new proposal by Northeast Utilities calls for rate increases
of 5.5 percent a year for seven years if Seabrook operates
commercially, with another 1.1 percent a year for five of those
seven years if the reactor never runs and power must be bought
elsewhere.
   Gregg, who announced the deal, described the rate increases as
about the same as the expected rate of inflation.
   Gregg said he gave tentative approval to the Northeast Utilities
offer to forestall action by the bankruptcy examiner, who he said
would support a rate plan acceptable to investors ``but which
gouges New Hampshire consumers.''
   The earlier offer from Berlin, Conn.-based Northeast Utilities,
valued by the utility at $1.2 billion, would have placed Public
Service's 36 percent share of the $6.1 billion Seabrook plant in
the hands of unsecured creditors. Under the deal, Northeast would
have bought Seabrook power.
   Public Service spokesman Nicholas Ashooh said the utility had
not seen the new offer and could not comment. But he said
bankruptcy court approval of the Northeast offer ``is by no means a
foregone conclusion.''
   New England Electric System of Massachusetts has said it wants
to buy Public Service's non-Seabrook assets. A revised proposal
from New England Electric is expected next month.
   Gary Hindes, chairman of The Delaware Bay Company Inc., which
represents holders of more than $200 million of Public Service
unsecured debt, said the new offer is an improvement over Northeast
Utilities' previous bid but still not enough.
   ``I think the plan is not going to fly unless they sweeten the
deal for unsecured creditors,'' Hindes said by telephone from New
York. Under bankruptcy law, ``all you need is one-third of
unsecured creditors to shoot it down,'' Hindes said.
   The deal offers unsecured creditors 90 cents on the dollar;
Hindes said his clients would seek 100 cents plus interest.
   Richard Tilton, representing Public Service stockholders, called
the offer ``woefully inadequate.'' It offers stockholders about
$165 million, ``which is about $400 million too short,'' Tilton
said.

   Chrysler Corp. will retire or lay off 2,300 of
its 31,000 salaried workers by year's end as part of $1 billion
cost-cutting program mandated by sagging sales and a changing
market, Chairman Lee Iacocca announced Thursday.
   The cuts are part of a long-term effort to make the
third-largest U.S. automaker more competitive, Chrysler said.
   The program, which sources had confirmed on Wednesday, was
announced to the company's top 600 managers gathered for a
regularly scheduled meeting in Detroit.
   ``This is not simply a reaction to the current sales
environment, but rather a response to market changes that have
taken place over the last several years,'' Iacocca said. ``Recent
sales have merely returned to normal trend projections, and we must
take the necessary steps to ensure our profitability.
   ``This will not be a one-shot deal. It's got to become a part of
our culture.''
   Through July 20, Chrysler's car sales this year were down 14.8
percent from last year, while its light-truck sales were down 0.4
percent. Car sales for all domestic vehicle manufacturers have
dropped 5.3 percent for the year while truck sales are off 1.8
percent from 1988.
   The work-force reduction will be achieved partly through early
retirement benefits being offered to employees 55 or older with at
least 10 years at the automaker. Chrysler has 123,000 salaried and
hourly employees.
   Iacocca also said there would be cuts in a broad range of other
segments of the business.
   One industry analyst was skeptical of the potential impact of
the cuts.
   ``This is an industry that kills to take a dollar out of the
cost of building a car,'' said Ron Glantz of Montgomery Securities
Inc. in San Francisco. ``Not very much of this billion-dollar
reduction is going to flow to the bottom line.
   ``They are going to have to reduce advertising and marketing,
which will hurt sales,'' he said.
   Shortly after Chrysler acquired American Motors Corp. in August
1987, the company cut its salaried work force by about 3,600
people, mostly through early retirement and attrition.
   Company officials and industry observers have said for months
that buyer incentives offered by Chrysler, Ford Motor Co. and
General Motors Corp. were likely to cut into profits and keep
marketing costs high.
   That showed up Thursday in the earnings reports of General
Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., which said second-quarter profits
were 3.4 percent and 15.4 percent lower respectively.
   Chrysler is to report its second quarter results on Monday.

   Republic Bank, a small Philadelphia bank, on
Wednesday dropped its prime lending rate from 11 percent to 10{
percent, becoming the third bank in the nation to do so in recent
weeks.
   The prime is the rate that banks charge their most creditworthy
customers. It affects many other rates, such as those charged on
some credit cards and variable-rate mortgages.
   Southwest Bank of St. Louis dropped its prime to 10{ percent on
July 7 and Chase Manhattan Bank, based in New York, followed suit
several days later.

<HEAD>Dollar Slips, Share Prices Rise Moderately In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar opened marginally lower against the
Japanese yen Friday morning, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange rose moderately.
   The dollar started trading at 139.30 yen, down 0.05 yen from
Thursday's 139.35-yen finish. In New York, the currency ended at
139.25 yen overnight.
   Although the dollar slipped following the announcement that the
U.S. gross national product grew only 1.7 percent in the second
quarter, market players in Tokyo were still inclined to buy the
dollar, said a trader with the Bank of Tokyo.
   ``The Tokyo market has a consistent demand for the dollar,'' he
added, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Other traders said the small GNP growth did not cause a plunge
of the dollar because the figure had been more or less expected,
and the majority of market players are more interested in what
monetary moves the U.S. Federal Reserve Board will take.
   The Bank of Tokyo trader said many market players were reluctant
to make major moves ahead of the weekend.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues quickly gained
122.66 points, or 0.35 percent, moving higher to 34,907.94 within
the first 15 minutes of trading. On Wednesday, the index had gained
269.45 points for a record 34,785.28.
   Dealers said the Nikkei index rose following its gains the
previous day as well as a rise in the Dow Jones industrial average
of 30 major issues in New York.
   Participants were targeting their buy orders at steel and
chemical stocks in early trading.

   The most visible sign of Nissan's
participatory style of management at its only U.S. plant is work
clothes.
   Employees from production workers all the way up to company
president Jerry Benefield wear blue uniforms. His light blue shirt
says ``Nissan'' on one side of the front and ``Jerry'' on the other.
   This image of benevolent, democratic management is one that the
Nissan Motor Manufacturing U.S.A. plant has carefully cultivated
since production of pickup trucks began in 1983 at the
highly-automated plant in Smyrna, 30 miles southeast of Nashville.
   ``We're going to continue operating this company the same as we
always have,'' Benefield said Thursday after learning Nissan
workers had rejected representation by the United Auto Workers by a
margin of more than 2-1.
   ``We're going to try to treat our people fairly, provide a good
environment for them to work in, provide competitive wages and
benefits and ask them to participate with us in managing the
company.
   Since its arrival in Smyrna, Nissan has promoted its
Japanese-style management philosophy of worker participation.
Managers and workers meet as equal partners to solve problems, and
executives have an open-door policy.
   Nissan workers also receive generous benefits:
   _A plan that lets them lease Nissan cars and trucks at a
discount. The employees pay for gas and oil. Nissan pays the
insurance and maintenance.
   _A recreation facility that includes softball fields, two
swimming pools, a golf driving range, tennis courts, a running
trail, horseshoe pits and picnic areas.
   _A fitness center at Nissan's training center.
   In addition, Nissan hosts numerous employee family outings. At
one of the first in 1983, Ruynon did a stint on a dunking machine.
Employees' families were offered rides over the plant in a Goodyear
blimp as part of another Nissan celebration that year.
   The company is not shy about publicizing its accomplishments.
Nissan put on extravagant productions when its first truck came off
the assembly line in 1983. The truck was donated to the Tennessee
State Museum.
   To celebrate its 500,000th vehicle, Nissan held a ``reverse
drawing'' and gave a car to the employee whose name was the last
one left in a fish bowl.
   The plant's millionth vehicle was given away, again through a
drawing, to a Nissan customer last week.
   Employees serve on committees that decide who gets grants and
scholarships from the company, and Nissan has sponsored a program
to bring actors to Tennessee and perform at schools and businesses.
   ``Basically, we're going to continue to emphasize that we should
be one team,'' Benefield said. ``It's what brung us this far, and
you ought not to change the gal you're dancing with just because
somebody else changes. You stay with who brung you to the party,
and that's what we intend to do.''
