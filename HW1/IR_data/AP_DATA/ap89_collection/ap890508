<HEAD>Ballet Theater Opens with Baryshnikov's `Swan Lake'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mikhail Baryshnikov has done more than touch up
the paint on ``Swan Lake.'' He has rethought it, and the
centerpiece of the American Ballet Theater production that opened
at the Metropolitan Opera on Monday night is the ultraromantic duet
in Act 2.
   ``Swan Lake'' never was for feminists but this $1.5 million
production, first danced by the company in December in Costa Mesa,
Calif., is even more romantic than most.
   The Swan Queen, danced by Susan Jaffe on Monday night as well as
in the California premiere, is shy at the beginning of her pas de
deux with Ross Stretton, the prince who is entranced by her. As
they dance, she clearly falls in love, begins to trust him, becomes
happy, poised and feminine _ in general expands to her potential
through loving a man.
   One reason this works so clearly is that the music in the latter
part of the pas de deux is slowed, allowing the two performers to
spin out their dance movements musically. Another reason is that
throughout the ballet, Miss Jaffe is able to act with body language
as well as dance superbly.
   Her arms ripple in the approved way of a Swan Queen but with
Miss Jaffe one notices the rest of her body as well. When she
appears in Act 3, as the evil magician Rothbart's daughter, to
trick the prince, she is as glittering as a diamond but not as
hard. She maintains some of the softness she has as the Swan Queen.
   Baryshnikov chooses to have her wear white, with sequins. It
works but we think a traditional ``black swan'' costume works
better.
   Act 1, often something of a bore as people walk and stand
around, has been filled with enjoyable dancing by Baryshnikov. The
men were giving real dancing and looked good. We enjoyed the first
act's pas de trois by Deirdre Carberry, Christina Fagundes and John
Gardner. The corps de ballet of swans in later acts also was fine.
   The staging throughout stressed that ``Swan Lake'' is theater,
not just dancing. For that reason, the least interesting part is
Baryshnikov's Act 4 dances for the swans. Much of it looks like
unorganized swooping around. For some reason, six of them now are
in black and four of those dance with four in white. Interest picks
up when the Swan Queen, now looking wounded but loving and
forgiving, and the prince come in.
   Rothbart, danced by Michael Owen in a mask with a beaked face
topped by tall feathers, comes in, loses his power in the face of
true love and has a neat, brief death scene. His home tower isn't
visible so nothing crumbles. The lovers walk into the lake and
ascend into heaven as the swans walk around becoming women, the
latter an interesting new touch.
   Baryshnikov's choreography is added to that of Marius Petipa and
Lev Ivanov. Jack Everly conducted.

   A woman described as the ``witch'' of a
drug-smuggling cult accused in the ritual slayings of 15 people
said Monday that group members held her hostage after the killings
were discovered.
   ``It was like hell,'' 24-year-old Sara Aldrete Villarreal told a
news conference Monday afternoon. ``They treated me like a
prisoner. I was scared.
   ``I don't know how I got into this without knowing what it
was,'' she said.
   Ms. Aldrete, who has been called the cult's ``witch'' by
suspects, was one of five people arrested in Mexico City after a
gunfight Saturday. As police closed in, a group member shot and
killed cult ``godfather'' Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo and his
right-hand man on the order of Constanzo himself, according to two
of those arrested and Mexican authorities.
   Constanzo, 26, a Cuban-born resident of Florida, and Ms.
Aldrete, his Mexican companion, were sought on both sides of the
border after police discovered bodies of cult victims buried at a
ranch in Matamoros, just across the Texas border from Brownsville,
on April 11.
   A source at the Mexico City attorney general's office, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said Monday two more women had been
arrested in the case. He refused to identify them or provide any
details.
   Also Monday, the attorney general's office adamantly denied
statements by U.S. law enforcement authorities, who have questioned
if Constanzo and his assistant are really dead.
   Deputy City Attorney General Abram Leopoldo Uzcanga told the
news conference, ``We have no doubt that these were the men.''
   He said both had been positively identified through fingerprints
and showed reporters official documents that he said certified the
identities. Autopsies on both bodies showed the men died from
multiple gun wounds to the head and abdomen, he said.
   Officials said they examined the bodies of Constanzo and his
right-hand man, Martin Quintana Rodriguez, at the central city
morgue Monday.
   Meanwhile, police continued to grill the five people arrested
Saturday and investigate whether other ring members still are at
large. All five were booked on charges of homicide, criminal
association, wounding a police agent during the arrest, and
property damage.
   Fausto Popoca, a spokesman for the city attorney general, said
in a telephone interview Monday they will be formally arraigned
shortly.
   Mexican authorities said Constanzo and Ms. Aldrete, a former
honor student at Texas Southmost College, directed the human
sacrifices and other rituals.
   They said the rituals were meant to bring occult protection to
the ring, which trafficked mostly in marijuana to the United States.
   Among those sacrified was Mark Kilroy, 21, a University of Texas
pre-med student.
   Alvaro de Leon Valdez, a 22-year-old Mexican, told a Sunday news
conference he killed Constanzo and Quintana with a burst of
submachine-gun fire in the fourth-floor apartment on Constanzo's
orders. The bodies were found slumped together inside a tiny closet.
   De Leon Valdez said Constanzo went berserk when he thought
police were closing in, tossing fistsful of $50 and $100 bills from
the window and shooting at passers-by who stopped to pick them up.
   Constanzo then ordered de Leon Valdez to kill him, and slapped
him when he hesitated.
   Constanzo ``went crazy, crazy,'' de Leon Valdez said. ``He said
to kill him because if I didn't it was going to go very badly for
me in hell.''
   Ms. Aldrete told reporters she had nothing to do with the ritual
slayings and learned about them from watching television reports.
``I couldn't believe it. It was amazing,'' she said.
   She said Constanzo, whom she called El Padrino, Spanish for
godfather, did most of the killings.
   Authorities said the rituals included mutilations and boiling of
brains and organs.
   De Leon Valdez said he watched as Kilroy was killed with a
machete chop to the head and his spinal column removed for a
necklace.
   Ms. Aldrete said Constanzo initiated her into the ``Christian
Santeria'' cult last year. Santeria, an offshoot of voodoo, is a
blend of Catholicism and old African beliefs that include animal
sacrifices.

   Space shuttle Atlantis
landed on a gusty desert runway Monday after putting U.S. planetary
exploration back on track with the launch of the unmanned Magellan
probe to Venus.
   Atlantis touched down at 12:43 p.m. PDT on a concrete runway at
Rogers Dry Lake after a fiery, hour-long plunge from orbit 184
miles above Earth.
   ``Congratulations and nice landing,'' said capsule communicator
Frank Culbertson in Houston. ``You've extended the shuttle's reach
far beyond Earth orbit now. Commodore Magellan (the 16th century
explorer for which the Venus probe was named) would approve.''
   ``It's good to be back. It's a great trip,'' shuttle commander
David M. Walker told reporters and space agency workers before the
crew flew back to Johnson Space Center four hours after landing.
   ``We had a great time on orbit. ... We hope you liked what we
did,'' said mission specialist Mary L. Cleave.
   The crew left the orbiter about an hour after landing and
inspected its underside, accompanied by senior National Aeronautics
and Space Administration officials. They found little damage to its
thermal tiles.
   ``The vehicle looks about as clean as any one that I've ever
seen,'' Richard Truly, NASA's acting associate administrator for
space flight, told a post-landing news conference.
   ``The Magellan spacecraft ... is floating toward the planet
Venus to open up a new era of planetary exploration,'' Truly said.
   Only about 27,500 of a predicted 100,000 spectators braved
baking heat to see Atlantis dive through the thin, high clouds and
rock the desert with the its signature twin sonic booms.
   About 200 people cheered the astronauts' return home Monday
night at Houston's Ellington Field. Even a few of the astronauts'
dogs were on hand to greet their 9:45 p.m. CDT arrival.
   ``I can't tell you how grateful all of us are to those of you
who have supported us personally and professionally through all
these many months of training and through, in fact, our whole
careers,'' Walker told the crowd of mostly Johnson Space Center
workers.
   The astronauts left the airport with their families. They were
scheduled to report back to work Tuesday to begin reviewing their
mission.
   Just 12 minutes before touchdown, Atlantis was ordered to land
on the concrete Runway 22 rather than the hard-packed clay of
Runway 17 as dust devils whipped up by the variable winds twirled
across the lakebed.
   Truly said the switch was apparently ordered because the
crosswind angle was better on the concrete runway for a test of
handling under such conditions _ a precursor to someday resuming
landings at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
   The crosswinds at landing were believed to have ranged from 12.6
mph to 20.7 mph, which would have yielded ``significant''
information on such landings, Arnold D. Aldrich, director of the
shuttle program.
   Re-entry began when two big engines at the rear of the
spacecraft ignited and burned for 2 minutes, 38 seconds over the
Indian Ocean on Atlantis' 64th orbit.
   The crew _ commander Walker, pilot Ronald J. Grabe, and mission
specialists Norman E. Thagard, Mark Lee and mission specialist
Cleave _ rocketed into space from Kennedy Space Center on Thursday
and launched the Magellan spacecraft.
   The $550 million probe will reach Venus after a 15-month, 800
million-mile journey and begin mapping the surface of Earth's
cloud-shrouded sister.
   ``The trajectory is about as accurate as you can get,'' said
Lennard Fisk, associate administrator for space science and
applications. ``I think we demonstrated with this flight that the
shuttle is in fact very capable of putting a planetary mission up.''
   Magellan marks the first new U.S. planetary exploration in 11
years. The start of its mission was cheered by scientists working
on a variety of programs that were delayed by the long hiatus in
the shuttle program after the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger disaster.
   NASA last explored Venus with the 1978 launch of the Pioneer
probe, which examined the planet's murky atmosphere and did some
radar mapping. Magellan's radar should map of 90 percent of the
planet and with much greater resolution than Pioneer.
   The Soviet Union sent two Venera probes to Venus in 1983 but
only mapped about a quarter of its surface.
   Atlantis' mission, the fourth since shuttle flights resumed
Sept. 29, 1988, had two significant technical problems. The orbiter
was 31 seconds from launch on April 28 when a short-circuit was
detected in a fuel pump, delaying takeoff until the pump and a
leaky fuel line were replaced. On Sunday, one of the four redundant
computers that control the shuttle's systems failed.
   The crew was able to restart the computer but mission
controllers decided not to trust it for re-entry. The crew
abandoned other tasks and spent 4{ hours replacing the faulty
computer with a spare, the first time that had been done.
   The shuttle could land with just one computer operating,
according to NASA.
   Until the computer problem developed, the crew had worked on an
experiment involving crystallizing a metal sample in a furnace and
had photographed lightning and pollution on Earth.
   The workload for mission STS-30 was light because Magellan and
its booster weighed 45,000 pounds, cutting the number of
experiments that could be carried.
   The mission also served to boost flight experience in the
shuttle astronaut corps. It was the third shuttle flight for
Thagard, the second for Walker, Grabe and Cleave, and the first for
Lee.

<HEAD>Spontaneous Scenes Enliven Pope's African Tour</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tiny, barefoot 3-year-old girl carries her even
smaller sister on her back as she wanders onto a stage in
Madagascar to stand near the pope from faraway Rome.
   A French missionary in Malawi springs from the crowd and breaks
into a spontaneous African celebration dance at the foot of the
altar, waving his arms back and forth over his head.
   A young beggar boy tugs at the robes of a bishop and pleads for
a handout during a stadium youth rally in Zambia.
   These were some of the faces of Africa that Pope John Paul II
glimpsed during his fifth trip to the continent.
   The nine-day tour, which ended Saturday, provided the pope with
the picture of an Africa that suffers from some of the worst
poverty in the world but bursts with a richness of tradition and
faith.
   Everywhere he went _ from dusty airfields to regal presidential
palaces _ John Paul found a Christianity that won't sit still. Even
at Masses, usually solemn ceremonies, the pope was surrounded by
colorful dancers, singers and tribal drummers.
   ``The beautiful ceremonies and the wonderful spirit of
celebration that accompanied them are special memories for me,'' he
said in his farewell speach in Blantyre, Malawi. ``I will treasure
them.''
   Some memorable moments from John Paul's 41st foreign pilgrimage:
   _ In Antsiranana on the northern tip of the impoverished island
of Madagascar, a French missionary nun brings an abandoned
11-month-old baby girl to receive the pope's blessing at an
open-air Mass. Angelica's mother is believed to be a prostitute.
   At the end of the service, the child is carried to the steps of
the altar by the girl's foster mother, who kneels at the pontiff's
feet. The pope takes Angelica in his arms, kisses her on the
forehead and gives her his blessing.
   ``We wanted the pope's benediction to give hope to all abandoned
children,'' says Jeanine Couve, the French nun, who runs an
orphanage.
   _ In Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar, the pope is
getting ready to address tens of thousands of youths in a soccer
stadium when the 3-year-old girl with her 1-year-old sister on her
back wanders out of the dancing crowd, climbs the steps of the
stage and walks over to where John Paul is sitting.
   The pope, smiling broadly, embraces both of them and gives them
rosaries. The girl stands next to the pope for a few minutes before
slipping back into the crowd.
   _ In Lusaka, Zambia, the pope mixes with the youths in the
Independence Stadium and briefly joins them in swaying to the
lilting African beat.
   ``Your desire to celebrate in song and dance today shows the
church's desire to celebrate and share the message of Christ's love
with the whole world,'' he says.
   _ The women flight attendants on an Air Malawi flight from
Blantyre to Lilongwe fall to their knees in the aisle to serve the
pope, a gesture that not only shows respect but also is in keeping
with women's traditional subservience to men in Malawi.
   _ In a striking sign of the order and discipline in the former
British colony of Malawi, the tens of thousands of people lining
the papal motorcade route in Blantyre stand in a perfect, nearly
motionless line for miles _ without a single barrier or armed
policeman to hold them back.
   Malawi's president-for-life, Hastings Kamuzu Banda, orchestrated
some of the most unusual scenes of the pope's tour, often upstaging
his guest.
   At the welcoming ceremony at the Blantyre airport, Banda,
wearing a homburg, carrying an elephant hair fly wisk, and
surrounded by his personal cadre of hundreds of brightly costumed
women dancers, joked with the pope and pulled him up from his chair
for a long embrace.
   Banda, who is believed to be in his early 90s, took center stage
again at a Mass the following day. With the pope waiting in a hall
nearby, Banda and his ``official hostess'' Mama C. Tamanda
Kadzamira arrived 10 minutes late in a black Mercedes limousine,
encircled by his dancers and waving his fly wisk out the window.
   ``The pope doesn't take these things too seriously,'' said
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro. ``He understands the need to
understand and adapt to local cultures.''

   Two disturbing age reminders occurred last month _ the first

died.
   Other indications, though somewhat less sombering, also indicate
the years are creeping up, according to a Los Angeles Times article
Sunday. The list offered, in part, that you're not as young as you

<HEAD>Parishioners Learn Late Priest Raced Greyhounds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parishioners who donated thousands
of dollars to their Roman Catholic priest were shocked to discover
after his death that he spent hundreds of dollars a month on a
greyhound racing ring.
   The Rev. Thomas Flahive, pastor of Our Lady of Guadalupe Church
for 28 years until he died of a brain hemorrhage in 1985, quietly
ran an international racing dog operation for more than a decade,
records show.
   During that time, concerned parishioners clothed him, gave him
furniture and even helped pay for annual trips to his native
Ireland, where it turns out he also kept dogs.
   ``To me, deception is dishonesty,'' said parishioner Eileen
Miguel.
   The priest's double life was exposed in a $500,000 lawsuit filed
by Flahive's rectory housekeeper who claimed she invested her
salary into his dog-raising endeavor and failed to receive ample
compensation after his death.
   Virginia Betz died of cancer in December before the suit went to
trial, and her heirs are considering whether to pursue it.
   Records show Flahive spent hundreds of dollars a month to train
his dogs, pampering some on sirloin steak and chicken, while he
lived frugally at the rectory.
   The priest owned more than 90 greyhounds in the United States
over the last decade of his life, according to records from the
National Greyhound Association in Abilene, Kan.
   The clergyman also bought an air-conditioned desert home in
Bermuda Dunes and transformed it into a luxury kennel for his
greyhounds.
   Revelations of his financial capabilities contrasted the
impression parishioners had of their spiritual leader.
   ``In the rectory, everything was more or less hand-me-downs,''
Ms. Miguel said. ``Anything that was needed, we went out and paid
for. We were glad to do that because we thought he was really so
poor.''
   His flock might be resentful, but the Catholic Diocese of San
Bernardino, in a letter to Ms. Miguel, ``found absolutely no
evidence that would cast any doubts on the integrity of Father
Flahive.''
   He left most of his estate, appraised at $283,094, to the
Catholic church.

   Just call Joe Bean Mr. Jalapeno.
   Bean blazed past the competition at Sunday's jalapeno-eating
contest in Laconia for a victory worth $200.
   The contest at the Nothing Fancy restaurant pitted Bean against
three others. He ate 20 of the hot peppers in a minute, while his
closest competitor managed to swallow 16.
   The so-called Final Four on Sunday earned their positions by
winning preliminary rounds earlier last week. In the opening round,
Bean shocked the crowd by downing 24 peppers, but wasn't quite up
to such a display on Sunday.
   ``I had stomach cramps,'' he said.
   Bean came prepared as he showed up with a bottle of stomach
medicine ``just in case.'' Contest organizers made sure the
contestants would be in the right mental frame by hanging two $100
bills in front of them as they ate.
   The contest was the brainchild of Nothing Fancy owner Al
Giguere, who hopes to make the contest an annual event.
   Giguere said he had hoped the world record of 29 jalapenos eaten
in one minute would fall at his inaugural event.

   Thousands of people cheered when workers
flipped a 9-foot onion burger, but they were even happier when it
was ready to eat.
   City officials say the small community outside Oklahoma City is
famous for its onion burgers, and they set out to prove it in a
colossal way Saturday. Chefs toiled about two hours over a burger
consisting of 150 pounds of meat and an equal amount of onion.
   ``This is uniquely El Reno,'' City Manager Larry Palmer said of
the town's Onion-Fried Burger Day.
   Five people began patting the hamburger meat on a grill welded
together by Canadian Valley Vo-Tech School students. Next came the
sliced onions, evenly spread over the monster patty.
   Moments later, spectators caught a whiff of the burger while a
quartet belted out songs about burgers.
   When the burger was ready to be flipped, the grill was taken off
the coals and the top half of the lid was lowered with pulleys.
Workers carefully flipped the grill and returned it to the coals,
and crowd whistled and applauded.
   People soon began to fight for position in line for a sample.
Chefs used bottomless coffee cans like cookie-cutters to slice the
burger.
   ``This is good for El Reno, this is just what we need,'' Fire
Chief Ron Martin said. ``We need to do this every year.''

<HEAD>`Vietnam Chic' Leading to False Tales of Military Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who served as president of the Vietnam
Veterans of America's Dallas chapter gave speeches about seeing
buddies killed in Southeast Asia but never served in Vietnam,
military records show.
   The closest Joe Testa came to the military was Fort Hood near
Killeen, the Dallas Times Herald reported.
   He was absent without leave twice, received suspended sentences
totaling nine months of hard labor and never rose above the rank of
private, records show.
   Testa's ability to rise to the presidency of the veterans'
group, before he was removed in January, illustrates a growing
problem: As America shows a belated appreciation for those who
served in Vietnam, some people are embellishing their roles in the
war, and even fabricating military careers.
   ``When the war was unpopular, people were reluctant to admit
they had served in Vietnam,'' said Barry Kasinitz, public affairs
officer for the 30,000-member Vietnam Veterans of America in
Washington, D.C. ``But now, being a Vietnam veteran is chic, and
you see an awful lot of people making up war stories.''
   Experts say some do it for glory or attention; some to justify
their drug abuse, unemployment or other personal problems; and some
for the camaraderie of veterans' groups, where they can drink beer
and swap stories, real or imagined, about the war.
   ``These are people who wanted to be combat vets, who, as males
in our society, felt they had to prove themselves by fighting in a
war,'' said David Rodriguez, a veterans' counselor in Dallas. ``But
they were unwilling, or they didn't get the opportunity, to go to
Vietnam.
   ``So now they live the experience vicariously. They hang around
with Vietnam vets and call themselves Vietnam vets.''
   Veterans and government officials said there may be legions of
people who have invented or inflated their military service in
Southeast Asia. The impostors often go unchallenged, said B.G.
Burkett, treasurer of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund of Texas.
   ``The etiquette among Vietnam vets is, you don't ask about
another vet's experience,'' said Burkett, an Army lieutenant in
Vietnam and now a Dallas stockbroker. ``If they want to talk about
it, fine, but you don't pry. That allows fraud to exist even among
Vietnam veterans.''
   Testa moved and did not leave a forwarding address, according to
the U.S. Postal Service and his former employer, Tinamou Corp., a
marketing firm. The telephone directory has no listing for Testa in
the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
   Representatives of Dallas veterans' groups and the Veterans
Administration say they don't know his whereabouts.

   Hoping to rebuild the ancient Jewish Temple
where Islamic shrines now stand, a group of Israeli rabbis are
compiling computerized lists of potential priests, weaving seamless
linen robes and reproducing a gem-studded breastplate described in
Exodus.
   The plan would place the Temple altar on what some
ultra-religious Jews believe is its historical site. The spot is
where the gold-topped Dome of the Rock now stands, a Jerusalem
landmark and one of the holiest sites of Islam.
   The seemingly irreconcilable claim by Arabs and Jews to the
area, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Arabs as Haram Al
Sharif or ``Noble Enclosure,'' is one of the most emotional issues
of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Any attempt by Israel to reclaim it would be certain to stir
tensions throughout the Moslem world. The government does not
support the rabbis' plan to rebuild the Temple.
   ``All Jewish history as far as we're concerned is one big
parenthesis until the Temple is returned,'' said Rabbi Nahman
Kahane of the Temple Institute.
   ``It isn't like Moslems who have to make the pilgrimage to Mecca
only once in a lifetime. In Judaism, three times a year a person is
mandated by the Torah to go to the Temple. Life without the Temple
is not really living,'' said Kahane, who immigrated from New York
City.
   The Temple Institute's 50 rabbis and artisans have made Temple
vessels and produced a computerized blueprint of the shrine in
preparation for rebuilding it on the site where it stood until A.D.
70 when the Romans destroyed it.
   More than $200,000 has been collected to finance the project,
most of it from American Jews, according to institute director
Rabbi Yisrael Ariel.
   In the centuries since the Temple's destruction, the 35-acre
rectangular platform has become a sacred Islamic site, marking the
spot where the Prophet Mohammed is said to have ascended to heaven.
   It encompasses the Dome of the Rock and Al Aqsa mosques _
considered Islam's holiest places of worship after Mecca and Medina.
   Tensions mounted last month when Israel began barring Moslems
from worshiping at Al Aqsa after Arab rioters threw stones that
landed on Jews praying at the adjacent Western Wall.
   The restrictions prompted accusations that Israel had reneged on
a pledge to maintain freedom of worship at Moslem holy sites.
Adherence to the policy had been a source of pride since Israel
seized the Old City and its shrines from Jordan in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   ``This is an ugly action and a serious matter not acceptable by
religion or by law,'' said Sheikh Mohammed Al Jamal, deputy
director of the Moslem trust that controls Islamic properties.
``Moslems have the right to express themselves politically within
the mosque.''
   Jewish militants have disputed Israeli measures that, in an
effort to prevent sectarian conflict, bar them from praying freely
on the Temple Mount.
   ``The Moslems built the mosques against the feelings of the Jews
and this must be changed,'' said Gershon Salomon of the Temple
Mount Faithful, a group dedicated to regaining Israel control of
the site.
   Asked what he would do about the mosques, he replies, ``I honor
Moslem feelings about Mecca, so we shall help them to take the two
mosques to Mecca and rebuild them there.''
   Kahane rejects such ideas as ``crazy.''
   ``There is no amount of money that would induce the Moslems to
move those mosques. But nothing could compel us to give up the
Temple either,'' said Kahane, brother of Rabbi Meir Kahane, the
founder of the anti-Arab Kach Party.
   ``It is up to God to decide,'' said the grey-bearded Kahane, who
says he is confident the Temple will be restored in his lifetime.
   To speed the process, Kahane has computerized a list of about
1,000 Israeli descendents of the biblical high priests, called
``kohanim'' in Hebrew, and recorded their addresses and professions.
   ``This way, when the Messiah comes, I can say, `Here, Mr.
Messiah, here's your data base,''' said Kahane, whose own name
appears on the list.
   To show what his dream might look like, Kahane's cramped office
contains a photomontage of Jerusalem with a replica of the Second
Temple superimposed on the Temple Mount. The Dome of the Rock and
Al Aqsa have been eliminated.
   On display at the institute's museum are reproductions of 30 of
the 93 items required for daily Temple worship, including the
copper wash basin used by priests to wash their hands and feet,
their seamless linen garments and the high priest's golden crown.
   Currently under construction are a six-foot high menorah
ornately worked in silver and the high priest's breastplate set
with 12 gemstones representing the tribes of Israel.
   The items are described in Exodus, the chapter of the Bible's
Old Testament that chronicles the religious history of the Jews'
flight from Egypt.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: 1992 Presidential Race Without Jesse Jackson?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just about everybody in the Democratic Party
seems pleased at the prospect that Jesse Jackson might run for
mayor of Washington in 1990 _ and not for president of the United
States in 1992.
   ``It's a great idea from a Democratic point of view, a strategic
point of view, and for Jesse and the city,'' said Donna Brazile, a
political consultant who has worked for Jackson and other
Democratic presidential candidates.
   After two groundbreaking presidential campaigns that altered
Democratic politics, Jackson is tantalizing party leaders with
hints he might forego a third campaign and run instead for mayor of
Washington. He has said he would consider the race only if his
friend Marion Barry does not seek re-election.
   ``It's a win-win-win situation, for everybody except Mayor
Barry,'' said Al From, executive director of the Democratic
Leadership Council, a group of moderate Democrats, many of them
Southerners.
   The idea has won enthusiastic if tentative support from nearly
all parts of the Democratic Party, and carries appeal for both
Jackson's backers as well as his detractors.
   By taking himself out of the presidential race, Jackson would
release his monopoly on black votes in the primaries, open up the
party to other potential contenders and, some believe, make it
easier for Democrats to unite in the fall and win back the White
House.
   ``It would incredibly change the dynamics of the nominating
process in 1992,'' said From.
   Jackson could provide a high-visibility replacement for the
scandal-plagued administration of Barry _ who is viewed by some as
becoming a national embarrassment to the Democratic Party. Jackson
could direct his motivational abilities to help stem the
drugs-and-death epidemic in the majority-black city, should he win.
   Barry has been plagued by repeated embarrassments and
suggestions of personal impropriety. He is currently under
investigation for visits to the hotel room of a friend later
indicted on cocaine-dealing charges, and has seen top appointees
convicted of criminal wrongdoing in office.
   Such a change would require a lowering of political sights for
Jackson. But some argue it would make sense for him, as he could
escape a likely third presidential defeat and gain a reliable local
base _ something he doesn't have in Chicago, where he has backed
two losing mayoral candidates.
   And in the process Jackson could pick up some government
experience which, if successful, could help him in a future
national race.
   In keeping with Jackson's style, however, his intentions remain
unclear and are shrouded in carefully worded answers and cryptic
signals.
   Jackson told interviewers from the Washington Post and New York
Times that he has ``not yet made a determination to run'' when the
Washington mayoral seat is up in 1990, and that he would not oppose
Barry, an old friend from the civil rights movement.
   If Barry stepped aside, however, Jackson said ``that's a
different situation.'' And he said he has speeded up planned
remodeling of a vacant house he owns in Washington, and may move
from Chicago when it is ready.
   Jackson has until November, a year ahead of the mayoral
election, to shift his legal residence to the District if he is to
be a candidate.
   Several political activists who are close to Jackson said the
preacher and civil rights leader is seriously considering the
mayoral race and has held lengthy discussions on the subject.
   ``It has become a lot more real possibility in the last couple
months,'' said Ann Lewis, an adviser in his 1988 campaign.
   ``He clearly has been getting advice and to some extent is
seeking it,'' said another adviser who wants him to make the race
and who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   But it is the impact on the national political scene that makes
the D.C. mayoral race such a subject of intense interest.
   ``You really haven't had any other candidates compete with Jesse
Jackson for the black vote, so that would be a big change,'' said
Ohio state Democratic chairman James Ruvolo.
   Frank Greer, a consultant to Democratic candidates, said
Jackson's exit would trigger ``a collective sigh of relief'' among
Democrats, eliminating what many see as a polarizing influence.
   By running for mayor, Jackson would not necessarily eliminate
himself from the presidential race two years later. But most
observers assume he would, and there is debate over whether that
would help liberal or more moderate or conservative candidates.
   While creating an opening on the party's left, Jackson's exit
might also allow room for another candidate to put together a
biracial coalition, such as Jimmy Carter did in 1976.
   Mark Mellman, a pollster who worked for Tennessee Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. in the 1988 primaries, argues that Gore was the second
choice of many Southern black political leaders and could have won
some of the Southern and other states won by Jackson without him in
the race.
   ``I don't think it automatically pulls the debate to the left in
an ideological way,'' Mellman said.
   From said potential 1992 candidates such as Gore, Sen. Sam Nunn
of Georgia, Sen. Chuck Robb of Virginia and Gov. Bill Clinton of
Arkansas have demonstrated an ability to appeal to black voters and
might be given an opening by Jackson's exit.
   And, From argues, all the Democratic candidates might have the
chance to gain more attention and escape the ``seven dwarfs'' image
that dogged the party in 1988.

<TEXT>
   In lackluster elections, the mayors of Dallas
and Fort Worth and a former San Antonio mayor coasted to easy
victories, while two El Paso city council members were close enough
to force a mayoral runoff.
   Former San Antonio Mayor Lila Cockrell, who was mayor between
1975 and 1981, received 45,300 votes, or 59 percent, from a
seven-candidate field in Saturday's election. She will replace
outgoing Mayor Henry Cisneros on June 1.
   Cisneros, who gained national prominence as a voice of
Hispanics, opted not to seek a fifth term, citing personal problems.
   Insurance executive Carl S. Mauthe, Ms. Cockrell's closest
challenger, received about 31 percent of the vote.
   In a landslide victory in Dallas, Mayor Annette Strauss garnered
73 percent of the vote in a four-way race.
   She received 60,895 votes, compared with 17,002 or 20 percent,
for leading challenger Peter Lesser. The two other candidates
managed no more than 4 percent of the vote each.
   In Fort Worth, Mayor Bob Bolen was easily re-elected to his
fourth, two-year term, receiving 89 percent of the vote, compared
with 7 percent for his nearest challenger, Evelyn Williams.
   In a race to determine who will succeed El Paso Mayor Jonathan
Rogers, council members Suzy Azar and Mayor Pro Tem Ed Elsey will
face each other in a May 27 runoff. By law, Rogers could not run
for a fifth, two-year term.
   Ms. Azar had 16,220 votes, or 31 percent, compared with 11,930
votes or 23 percent for Elsey. Trailing behind them was state Rep.
Paul Moreno, with 10,452 or 20 percent. Three other candidates had
a combined 27 percent of the vote.
   The San Antonio ballot was the first one in 14 years that didn't
include Cisneros, who was a city councilman for six years before
becoming mayor in 1981.
   Beset by a troubled marriage and his son's ill health, the
popular 41-year-old mayor said last fall that he wouldn't run again
and would accept a job in the private sector.

<BYLINE>Anti-Hyperactivity Drug Eases AIDS-Related Mental Problems, Study
Suggests ^By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drug best known for its use in treating
hyperactive children eased mental and emotional impairment caused
by the AIDS virus in a new study, a researcher reports.
   The results emerged when Ritalin was given to 97 patients with
acquired immune deficiency syndrome or AIDS-related complex, said
Francisco Fernandez.
   Seventy-six percent showed moderate to marked improvement in
such areas as energy, vigor and mood, while 67 percent showed gains
in such areas as reaction time, information processing speed and
long-term memory, he said.
   Fernandez is chief of the psychiatric consultation service at
St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital and assistant professor of psychiatry
at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
   He spoke in a recent interview before addressing a symposium
Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric
Association.
   Ritalin, also called methylphenidate, is often prescribed for
children with attention deficit disorder, which commonly produces
hyperactivity. Despite that use, it is actually a stimulant.
   When the AIDS virus attacks the brain, it can cause such
symptoms as memory loss, mental slowing, confusion, disturbances in
body movement, apathy, withdrawal, depression and anxiety.
   None of the patients in the new study was taking AZT, an AIDS
drug that has been shown to ease impairment in mental functioning
caused by the AIDS virus, Fernandez said.
   Side effects in the study were eliminated by changing dosages,
Fernandez said. Twelve patients had initial short-term changes in
blood pressure and pulse, twelve exhibited nervousness and
restlessness, and two had insomnia, he said.
   Fernandez stressed that Ritalin is not a cure, but rather a
helpful auxilliary treatment for some mood and thinking problems
caused by the AIDS virus.
   Stimulants such as Ritalin have been used for some time to
improve mood and energy in people with cancer or AIDS, and the new
research shows it also helps mental performance, said William
Breitbart, assistant attending psychiatrist at the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
   In contrast to AZT, stimulants do not fight the AIDS virus
directly, he said in an interview. Instead, they improve mood and
concentration, which helps patients perform better on mental tests,
he said.
   ``We're really not improving anything in their brain, but we're
giving them an edge for using what they've got,'' Breitbart said.
``It's getting a little more juice out of the system.''

<TEXT>
   High-definition television was the
undisputed star of this year's National Association of
Broadcasters' convention, dominating conversations around hotel
lobbies, at restaurants and in numerous technical and policy
sessions.
   A dozen companies laid out advanced television displays,
covering 22,000 square feet, as they tried to convince TV station
owners and engineers that crisper, wide-screen TV images and
compact disc-quality sound will be worth the large investment in
new equipment.
   Some estimates have put the cost at $3 million to $18 million to
convert a TV station to full HDTV capability.
   At the same time, no one knows if TV viewers will pay the
$3,000-$4,000 that HDTV sets are expected to cost when they first
appear in this country, probably by 1995.
   But no matter how HDTV develops, many members of Congress want
to make sure it's an American show. Those congressional proponents
see HDTV, which is expected to be a $50 billion business in 20
years, as a means of revitalizing a U.S. electronics industry that
was decimated by competition from low-cost Asian imports in the
1970s.
   ``American industrial competitiveness in advanced electronics,
especially consumer advanced electronics, is not what it should be,
is not what it could be ... and high-definition television does
offer a vehicle to combat'' that loss of competitiveness, Rep. Don
Ritter, R-Pa., told an NAB session.
   Ritter has introduced a bill to pump at least $100 million a
year in federal grants or loans into HDTV research, as well as
revising antitrust and trade laws to spur a U.S. HDTV industry.
   And he said the Japanese have no right to criticize this ``Team
America'' approach.
   ``I don't think it's appropriate to be lectured to by the
Japanese on how to deal with important technological advance when
it comes to one's own national interests,'' he said to an
appreciative audience of broadcasters.
   Although it will be at least two years before the Federal
Communications Commission decides on standards for over-the-air
HDTV broadcasts, companies such as NBC, Zenith, Japan's NHK
broadcasting network and others are beating the drums for their
competing approaches to advanced television.
   The FCC has said a U.S. HDTV system must not make the nation's
existing 160 million TV sets obsolete. That means manufacturers
must find ways to give viewers both the standard signal, called
NTSC, and the new HDTV signal for those who have special TV sets to
receive them.
   HDTV signals typically pack seven times as much information as
do NTSC signals.
   No one has yet demonstrated a way to fit that much information
into current TV channels without causing interference with
neighboring channels.
   HDTV probably will need more space, and it will be up to the FCC
to decide whether to give HDTV a bigger chunk of the already
crowded airwaves.
   Some are proposing that stations broadcast two signals _ the
standard NTSC signal, and then a second high-definition signal on a
channel that isn't being used currently.
   Older sets would receive the NTSC signal, while new HDTV sets
could receive both the old and new signals.
   Others want stations to send a standard NTSC signal that when
combined with another signal on an adjacent channel would create
HDTV.
   Others, such as NBC, are taking a more cautious approach. Its
Advanced Compatible Television system provides an ``enhanced'' TV
image that NBC is promoting as a low-cost interim step towards true
HDTV.
   The ACTV system, which is being developed by NBC, RCA and the
David Sarnoff Research Center, was demonstrated at the NAB meeting.
   NBC also demonstrated computer simulations of the proposed
second generation of ACTV, which would provide double the clarity
of existing TV displays and very high-quality sound _ considered
true HDTV.
   Zenith officials at NAB claimed they had found a way to fit
their Spectrum Compatible HDTV signal into the amount of space _
six megahertz _ that TV stations need for each channel, without
causing interference with adjacent channels.
   Zenith doesn't have such a system yet, but it proposes to
transmit its signal on the so-called taboo channels that aren't
being used on the TV dial.
   FCC regulations require that stations in a single market
separate their signals by one channel in order to avoid
interference. If, for instance, a community has stations on
channels 7, 9, 11 and 13, channels 8, 10 and 12 would be open.
   Zenith says there are enough empty channels to allow 99.7
percent of all U.S. broadcasters to transmit HDTV signals. It
expects to have hardware available for testing by the end of the
year.
   NHK was promoting its enhanced-definition system, MUSE-6, that
will provide a better picture to existing TVs, and it also showed
an HDTV system, MUSE-9, that would require 1.5 channels to transmit.
   HDTV sets would combine the 1.5 channels into one to produce an
HDTV picture, while older sets would receive only the one standard
channel.
   A small California company, Faroudja Laboratories, says others
are barking up the wrong tree in their pursuit of HDTV. Faroudja
has found a way to dramatically improve current NTSC TV signals to
create what Faroudja calls SuperNTSC.
   Faroudja's system was used to broadcast an enhanced TV signal at
NAB, and it was used on a videotape of the movie ``Indiana Jones
and the Temple of Doom.''
   The Faroudja exhibit attracted large numbers of spectators at
the HDTV demonstration area at the Las Vegas Convention Center,
where a large Barco video projector displayed very high-quality
images of the movie on a screen 8.5 feet wide and 12 feet high. But
scenes shot on video cameras were not nearly as good.
   Faroudja achieves its improved picture by removing flaws from
the standard NTSC signal and by doubling the number of lines of
horizontal dots used to ``paint'' a picture on a TV screen from 525
to 1,050.
   Faroudja officials say their system can be installed at TV
stations for a fraction of the cost of competing HDTV systems and
that it even will improve the picture on older TV sets.

<HEAD>Winter Wheat Estimate Likely to Spur Relief Calls</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A renewed push for greater drought relief in
Kansas and other stricken grain areas is likely to be one of the
results when the Agriculture Department issues a long-awaited
estimate of winter wheat production later this week.
   Dry conditions last fall, harsh winter cold and continued
drought in early spring have bitten deeply into 1989 harvest
prospects. Winter wheat, with Kansas normally its biggest producer,
provides about three-fourths of the nation's total wheat output.
   According to USDA projections, which will be revised Thursday
when the new report is issued, the 1989 total wheat crop could be 2
billion bushels or less, a far cry from the sharply expanded output
that was foreseen last fall.
   Last year's drought cut the 1988 harvest to 1.81 billion
bushels, resulting in reduced supplies for export and higher market
prices. Federal planting curbs were eased for 1989 and USDA
analysts expected production to rebound sharply.
   President Bush's budget proposals to Congress earlier this year
included an assumption that U.S. wheat production this year would
be around 2.55 billion bushels. Even until recent weeks, USDA has
been saying unofficially that 1989 wheat production could be as
much as 2.45 billion bushels.
   But further deterioration and evidence of widespread winter
damage in Kansas and other areas have cast a pall on the situation.
   Last week, for example, the Senate approved a non-binding
resolution calling for drought assistance to winter wheat
producers. It calls for making federal aid available to winter
wheat growers by extending drought programs enacted last year.
   But the USDA has said the 1989 winter wheat crop doesn't qualify
for any of the $3.9 billion in assistance approved in 1988 for
farmers hurt by drought in the Midwest and northern Great Plains.
   Resolutions such as the one introduced by Sens. Bob Dole and
Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas do not have any power of law and are
designed to express the opinion of the Senate.
   Dole, citing new USDA figures, said drought assistance for wheat
growers could cost $250 million to $350 million, and should be
covered by expected savings in federal wheat subsidies.
   Crop prices are projected to rise because of a smaller wheat
harvest from the drought, which in turn should lower direct subsidy
payments to farmers.
   In fact, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said in a May 3
letter to Dole and others that the estimate of $250 million to $350
million was based on a projected winter wheat crop of 2 billion to
2.2 billion bushels this year.
   That would mean the 1989 U.S. wheat crop could be as much as 22
percent below the expectations of budget makers a few months ago,
and perhaps only 10 percent more than the drought-shriveled 1988
harvest.

   If further tests work out, consumers one day
may see on their grocery store shelves rosy, red tomatoes that are
truly vine-ripened.
   Scientists at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., say an
experimental process could keep vine-ripened tomatoes from turning
into spoiled mush before they can be sold in grocery stores.
   According to the university, the process involves the ``vacuum
infiltration'' of a chemical solution into the vine-ripe tomato
through its stem or stem scar. The substance is a naturally
occurring polyamine _ 1,4 butanediamine _ which is said to be
present in all living things.
   The tiny amount of the substance (about 1 milligram per tomato)
causes the ripening process to stop temporarily. The effect is to
extend the shelf life of vine-ripened tomatoes to 10 to 12 days
from only four or five normally.
   Peter J. Davies, a Cornell professor of plant physiology, said
in a recent report that ``we simply increase the level of
polyamines that are already in the fruit, thus preventing the ripe
fruit from becoming soft too quickly.''
   The current practice of tomato production and sale is to pick
tomatoes while still green, which diminishes their flavor by the
time they are sold at produce counters, the report said.
   In the Cornell method, the tomato is picked after it begins to
ripen on the vine, which is indicated by the first appearance of
orange color.
   Cornell researchers, who were supported by grants from the
university's biotechnology program, the Frasch Foundation and the
Agriculture Department, said they got the idea of using polyamines
while studying an obscure tomato from Brazil, the Alcobaca.
   The Brazilian tomato has to be ripened fully on the vine,
because it refuses to ripen if picked green, the report said.
   Subsequent investigations showed the butanediamine content of
the Brazilian tomato was about triple that of regular varieties.
   ``We think that this particular compound plays a key role in
slowing the ripening process of the Brazilian tomato, but other
plant hormones also may be involved,'' Davies said.
   Although the Cornell method has worked successfully in
laboratory tests, whether it can be used under commercial
conditions remains to be seen, the report said.

   When Concepcion Picciotto immigrated to the
United States from Spain in the early 1960s, she saw America as a
place to be anything she wanted.
   And for a while, it was. Picciotto says she settled in New York
City, got a job as an interpreter for an office of the Spanish
Embassy, married, gave birth to a daughter and lived out the
classic American dream.
   But somewhere along the way, that dream fell apart. Now, she
lives in Lafayette Park across the street from the White House
where she protests injustices in the American political system.
   ``I never dreamed to be a protester in my life,'' she said. ``I
found out that the United States is not an ideal country.''
   Flanked by large signs decrying nuclear arms, Picciotto spends
her days painting rocks with doves and messages of peace, and
passing out anti-nuclear literature to tourists and passersby.
   ``We have to assure that we have a world. We are on the brink of
having a nuclear holocaust,'' she said. ``All they (government
officials) care about is just building weapons.''
   Along with her partner William Thomas, Picciotto has been in
Lafayette Park since 1981. She claims to have kept up the longest
vigil of any demonstrator in the park.
   To comply with park rules which prohibit camping, Picciotto gets
by with the bare minimum. Local charities give her food. Tourists
give her donations for her rocks. Picciotto said she leaves her
post only for an infrequent shower or to use a bathroom.
   Her bed is an afghan-covered box next to a sign where she
perches at night, lest a passing policeman find her asleep and
accuse her of camping.
   She is required to stay within three feet of her demonstration
signs or else risk a $50 citation. She keeps up on current events
with secondhand newspapers from trash cans.
   ``You have to learn how to survive,'' Piocciotto said.
   Picciotto said she moved to Washington from New York in 1978,
when she was attempting to get help from federal officials to
prevent her husband, whom she was divorcing, from gaining custody
of her daughter.
   ``My husband had a very vicious and cruel lawyer,'' she said.
``I was railroaded by the courts. I felt that I was persecuted.''
   She lost custody of her daughter and hasn't seen the child in 10
years. Picciotto, who has no other family in the United States,
said she was told that her ex-husband and daughter have left the
country but she doesn't believe it.
   ``I'm very bitter,'' she said, but she added that from the
experience she realized that the American judicial system is
flawed. ``I just can't stand injustice. It was like my eyes had a
bandage.''
   Picciotto said some people call her anti-American or paranoid,
but she's not. ``I'm not a communist. Immediately they label you
communist or crazy when you tell the truth,'' she said. ``I'm
defending the Constitution.''
   Picciotto says she has endured taunts and beatings from young
conservatives and military servicemen late at night.
   ``They terrorize me every time I see them,'' she said. ``The
police won't even do anything to them. They protect them.''
   The United States Park Police, who oversee Lafayette Park,
confirmed that Piocciotto has had problems with harassment from
off-duty military personnel and from Republican youth groups. But
police denied that they, too, had mistreated Piocciotto as she
claims.
   ``Connie's rendition of events is slanted at the very least and
is a pack of lies at the most,'' said police Lt. Hugh Irwin. ``And
it's because her world is so small sitting on the sidewalk,
associating with the people she does.''

<HEAD>Report: School Bus Seat Belts Would Save Few Lives, Cost $40 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal committee today rejected the idea of
requiring seat belts on the nation's more than 300,000 larger
school buses, concluding that it would cost $40 million and save an
average of just one life a year.
   ``The overall potential benefits of requiring seat belts in
school buses is insufficient to justify a federal standard
mandating installation,'' said a committee of the National Research
Council after an 18-month study. The NRC was set up by the National
Academy of Sciences.
   The committee said, however, that some steps should be taken to
improve what transportation officials say already is one of the
safest public conveyances, including raised seat backs and programs
to prevent accidents while children are getting on and off the
buses.
   The group estimated that if all school buses were equipped with
seat belts for each passengers and half the students used them, it
might save one life and prevent several dozen serious injuries a
year. It would cost $40 million a year to equip and maintain all
larger school buses with passenger seat belts, the study said.
   Raising seat-back heights from a minimum of 20 inches to 24
inches could save two to three lives, prevent up to 95 serious
injuries and cost about $6 million a year, the report said.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration does not
require seat belts in buses rated at more than 10,000 pounds gross
weight that typically carry more than 16 passengers. Smaller,
van-like buses must have belts, however.
   The study, ordered by Congress and funded by the Department of
Transportation, recommended that all states prohibit children from
standing on school buses when they are in motion. Some states allow
school buses to carry more children than there are seats.
   The committee, which included a wide range of safety and
transportation experts, also recommended that states, local school
districts and private contractors stop operating school buses made
before 1977 because they do not comply with current safety
standards.
   Buses built after 1977 have extra padding in seats, protected
fuel tanks and other modifications to make them less deadly in
crashes.
   The recommendation on older buses followed a similar conclusion
from the National Transportation Safety Board five weeks ago after
an investigation into the head-on collision between a pickup truck
and an older school bus used by a church group in Kentucky in May
1988 that killed 24 children and three adults.
   Although that crash was blamed on the allegedly drunken driver
of the pickup truck, who is to face trial in November on 27 murder
charges, the safety board said design of the bus contributed to the
severity of the accident. The bus's unprotected fuel tank burst
into flames that spread fire and smoke through the bus.
   The report said a minority of committee members felt seat belt
use should be encouraged for all motor vehicles.
   In reaching its conclusion that a school bus seat belt law is
unwarranted, the committee studied the experience of New York and
several school districts in Illinois, New Jersey, Virginia and
Arizona that have required safety belts.
   The committee said that an average of 10 children a year are
killed while riding school buses, but 40 are killed while trying to
board or leave a bus, two-thirds of them hit by their own or
another bus.
   The report proposed more careful driver selection and training,
mandatory stop-signal arms on all new buses, and possible use of
loudspeakers, barriers and sensors to prevent pedestrian accidents.
   ``Although the death or injury of any child transported by
school bus is cause for concern, the safety record of school buses
is good considering the amount of travel involved,'' the report
said. U.S. school buses log four billion miles a year.
   The report said it's four times safer to ride in a school bus
than an automobile.

<HEAD>Send Casual Drug Users to `Boot Camp,' Bennett Suggests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal drug czar William Bennett says sending
persons convicted of casual drug use to ``boot camps'' instead of
jail would cost the government less money but still be a strong
deterrent.
   Bennett, interviewed Sunday on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' said he
was considering such a plan as part of the overall anti-drug
strategy he is preparing for the Bush administration.
   ``You don't put them all in jail, but you can fine every one of
them, you can take their cars away, you can send people to boot
camp,'' Bennett said.
   ``We are looking into this boot camp thing, which we've seen in
several states, which looks to be a very productive kind of thing.''
   In such a boot camp, he said, the drug offender ``gets up at
4:30 in the morning, he does push-ups, he runs a good bit and
doesn't watch soap operas or TV, as many people do in jail.
   ``It's inexpensive, it teaches good lessons, and the recidivism
rate is very, very low because it is so grueling and so unpleasant
people don't want to go back to it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Former military ruler Hugo Banzer Suarez
clung to a dwindling lead early Monday in presidential elections,
according to partial, unofficial returns, and it appeared congress
would have to choose a winner.
   Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada of the governing party seemed poised
to overtake Banzer, but neither seemed able to garner the 50
percent of the vote in Sunday's balloting needed to assume the
presidency.
   The balloting was peaceful as voters in this impoverished nation
stood patiently in lines to choose from among nine candidates to
replace 81-year-old President Victor Paz Estenssoro, who is
retiring from politics.
   Voters also chose representatives for all 27 senate seats and
all 130 house seats. According to the constitution, lawmakers must
choose the president from among the top three finishers when no
candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote.
   The independent station American Television said it had tallied
669,977 of the estimated 1.8 million ballots cast and that Banzer
and his center-right Nationalist Democratic Action had garnered
28.9 percent.
   Sanchez de Lozada, of the governing Conservative Revolutionary
Nationalist Movement, was second with 27 percent. Jaime Paz Zamora
of the Social Democratic Movement of the Revolutionary Left had
22.7 Percent and six other candidates trailed far behind.
   Banzer's percentages slipped steadily from more than 30 percent
in initial returns, and American Television predicted Sanchez de
Lozada would pull ahead as more votes from the countryside came in.
   The station's computerized projections showed Sanchez de Lozada
with a final tally of 27.8 percent, Banzer with 25.3 percent and
Paz Zamora with 23 percent.
   Banzer, the front-runner in polls, was known to be strong in the
cities, where the vote was counted first, while Sanchez de Lozada
and Paz Zamora were counting on heavy support from rural areas,
where the vote was tabulated more slowly.
   National election officials said they would not release any
returns until at least midday today. They said the complete count
would take nearly three weeks as ballots trickle in from remote
areas.
   The new congress convenes on Aug. 4, and will have two days to
decide on a new president, who is to be inaugurated for a four-year
term on Aug. 6.
   Banzer had hoped for a convincing win, by at least 5 percentage
points, to oblige congress to declare him president.
   Sanchez de Lozada said he was confident he could win the
presidency in congressional negotiations if he finished first or a
close second.
   Even if Banzer maintained his lead, he ran the risk of being
denied the presidency for the second straight time. He finished
first in the 1985 election, but congress picked the runner-up,
Estenssoro, whose Revolutionary Nationalist Movement had formed an
alliance with the third-place Movement of the Revolutionary Left to
shut out Banzer.
   The election day calm was notable in what was once was South
America's most politically volatile nation. Bolivia suffered 13
military coups this century and had nine governments between 1978
and 1982.
   No serious violence was reported on Sunday.
   Opposition parties made some complaints of fraud, and
authorities said three people were arrested for carrying several
different identity cards, apparently to vote more than once. A La
Paz provincial official was arrested for voting twice, officials
said.
   Nonetheless, election officials said they had no evidence of
widespread irregularities, and foreign observers said their initial
impression was of a fair vote.
   Garcia Pintos, an Uruguayan observer, said, ``Voters are being
provided with all guarantees. We haven't seen any sign of
irregularities.''
   Spirits ran high despite the long waits to cast ballots, which
were multicolored to help the 37 percent of the 6.7 million
population who are illiterate.
   ``This is a step forward for democracy,'' said La Paz
businessman Martin Cariaga as he waited. ``It's another example of
the maturity of the country.''
   Banzer, 62, seized power in a bloody coup in 1971 that toppled a
leftist military dictatorship. He ruled until 1978, when popular
pressure obliged him to call elections.
   Banzer, Sanchez de Lozada and Paz Zamora pledged to continue the
government's battle against cocaine production and trafficking. The
United States provides about $55 million a year for drug programs
to reduce coca leaf cultivation in Bolivia's jungles.
   An estimated 300,000 Bolivians depend on coca leaf farming,
cocaine processing or trafficking for their livelihood, government
figures show. Coca leaves are the raw ingredient in cocaine.

<TEXT>
   The president of Alcorn State University
has asked every president since Lyndon Johnson to speak at the
black college's commencement. He was a bit surprised when one
accepted.
   Alcorn State, one of the smallest of Mississippi's eight public
universities, hasn't had a lot of limelight over the years.
``Roots'' author Alex Haley _ who never graduated _ is by far its
best known student. It also has produced some pro football players.
   Getting President Bush to address Saturday's commencement was
quite a coup, and some are hailing the visit as a historic sign of
racial progress.
   When Bush arrives, he will be ``in the boondocks,'' said school
President Walter Washington, who proudly adds that the president
will tour an important place in black history.
   Nestled in the rural hills of southwestern Mississippi, the
campus is seven miles west of ``downtown'' Lorman _ an
unincorporated hamlet consisting of a post office, two service
stations, an old-time general store and a few houses.
   The campus originally was Oakland College, a Presbyterian school
founded in 1830 to educate white males.
   However, that school never reopened after the Civil War, and
during Reconstruction, the state purchased the land for a black
college. Hiram R. Revels, the first black to serve in the U.S.
Senate, was Alcorn's first president.
   The school, renamed Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College,
became the first black land-grant college in the United States,
Washington said. That was in 1878.
   Today, the 2,757-student campus is overwhelmingly black and
Democratic.
   Bush's visit ``speaks well of him,'' said James McDonald,
21-year-old leader of Alcorn State's 100-member chapter of the
Young Democrats.
   The school is not without Republicans. A dozen students belong
to Alcon State's College Republicans, a group formed just last
semester. Member Keith Washington, 21, said he expects the group to
boom over the next few years.
   The Republican president also will travel Saturday to much
larger Mississippi State University in Starkville to give another
graduation speech. The predominantly white school has about 12,000
students.
   Several Alcorn State students said they were overjoyed to have a
president visit _ no matter what his party affiliation.
   However, 19-year-old Thomas Lewis of Natchez was among the few
not enthusiastic.
   ``Personally, I'm a Democrat,'' he said. ``I don't agree with
his views on stuff, so it's no big deal to me.''
   Others said they just hope Bush actually comes _ unlike former
Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, who scratched
Alcorn State from his campaign itinerary at the last minute.
   ``We were standing around outside waiting for Jesse Jackson for
a couple of hours,'' said 20-year-old Lutrenda Smith of Greenwood.
``We got excited for nothing. I'll believe Bush is here when I see
him.''

   The opposition and the government
both claimed victory Sunday before most votes were counted in a
presidential election considered a referendum on the de facto rule
of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The opposition claimed that forces loyal to Noriega had
perpetrated widespread fraud and some U.S. observers reported
witnessing irregularites.
   Turnout was high in Sunday's largely peaceful balloting, which
pitted Noriega's hand-picked candidate, Carlos Duque, against the
opposition's Guillermo Endara.
   ``The triumph of the opposition is indisputable,'' Endara said
after polls closed but before any results had been announced. He
claimed there were ``serious irregularities'' and called for a
protest march on Monday.
   Endara told a news conference that he had won by a two-to-one
margin.
   The government coalition countered in a statement that ``we can
affirm that our triumph is decisive, just, honest, and perfectly
clear.''
   ``We are satisfied and grateful for the support of the people,''
Duque told a news conference. He called opposition talk of fraud
``childish.''
   The victory speeches came as workers tallied paper ballots at
polling places, and both sides released exit polls that favored
their side.
   The opposition said its poll gave Endara 55.1 percent of the
vote to 39.1 percent for Duque; the government poll showed Duque
with 50.9 percent of the vote to 44.7 percent for Endara.
   In the only reported incident of violence, the Roman Catholic
church said a Dutch priest was shot and seriously wounded by
soldiers as he urged people over a loudspeaker to go to the polls
in the western city of David.
   Voters began lining up at some polling stations at 5 a.m., two
hours before the scheduled opening. At one booth, more than 100 of
348 registered voters were in line by 8 a.m. The lines were gone by
late afternoon.
   The government promised official results within 24 hours.
   The opposition accused the government of making arrangements for
its supporters to vote ``early and often''.
   Opposition vice-presidential candidate Ricardo Arias Calderon
charged that many members of Noriega's 15,000-strong Defense Forces
had voted more than once.
   Opposition leaders noted that soldiers were allowed to jump to
the front of voting lines and that they could vote at any booth.
   They said hundreds of opposition supporters who went to the San
Juan Bautista de la Salle College to vote were told they were not
registered. The college is in a wealthy district and the opposition
enjoys wide support among the business community.
   Arias Calderon, one of the leaders calling for a protest march
on Monday, also claimed three foreigners invited by the opposition
were detained for several hours Sunday before being freed.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., part of a 13-member uninvited
delegation sent by President Bush, said earlier: ``The general
belief is that the election will be stolen sometime tonight.''
   ``We've seen many irregularities, but it is difficult to judge
the extent of the irregularities,'' he said.
   Former President Jimmy Carter, however, said he had seen no
irregularities. ``The only problem I've seen is with the number of
voters,'' he said. Carter was invited by the Panamanian government
along with former President Gerald Ford.
   Daniel Nunez, the Roman Catholic bishop of David, said the Rev.
Nicolas Van Cleef was arrested by the Defense Forces while urging a
high voter turnout and criticizing fraud over a car loudspeaker.
   Van Cleef was shot while inside the car and was in ``grave''
condition, the church said. Telephone calls to government spokesmen
for comment were not returned.
   The government contends the opposition has joined forces with
the United States in an effort to abrogate the 1977 Panama Canal
treaties, which call for the United States to give the canal to
Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.
   Duque cited damaging U.S. economic sanctions, U.S. drug charges
against Noriega and reports that the United States provided the
opposition with $10 million in campaign assistance.
   The opposition denies the government charges, and says Noriega
must be eased out if democracy is to progress in Panama.
   Endara, 52, and Duque, 59, are businessmen. The new president
takes office Sept. 1.
   A pro-government newspaper, La Republica, published official
Election Tribunal figures showing pro-government parties with
611,000 registered members out of 1.18 million registered voters.
   Arias Calderon repeated accusations that the electoral register
included 100,000 extra names and that out of a sampling of 3,000
recent deaths, the names of 27 percent of the dead were still on
the register.
   Noriega's hold over the Defense Forces has effectively given him
control of the government since 1983, and he has been able to
remove presidents at will.
   In the last election, in 1984, Nicolas Ardito Barletta was
narrowly elected over Arnulfo Arias Madrid amid cries of fraud.
Noriega had Barletta resign and installed Eric Delvalle as
president in 1985.
   When Delvalle tried to fire Noriega in February 1988 after the
general was indicted in the United States on drug charges, Noriega
engineered Delvalle's ouster and installed Solis Palma as acting
president.
   Noriega denies the drug charges.

<TEXT>
   The father of a Texas student slain and
mutilated by members of a drug-smuggling cult said he was not
surprised to see the ringleader slain.
   ``The world wanted him caught,'' said James Kilroy, father of
Mark Kilroy, whose remains were found in a mass grave April 11.
``There were very few people would would put up with a guy like
him.''
   Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, 26, who was accused of leading the
drug-smuggling ring that killed Kilroy and 14 others, was one of
two men killed when Mexico City police closed in on them Saturday.
   Constanzo apparently ordered one of his followers to kill him
when he realized arrest was imminent.
   Kilroy said late Saturday it was inevitable that Constanzo would
surface.
   It was the disappearance of Mark Kilroy on a spring break
drinking foray into Matamoros, Mexico, that set off a massive
police investigation that eventually alerted authorities to the
deadly drug smugglers.
   The cult was led by Constanzo and his girlfriend, Sara Aldrete,
who was described as the ``witch,'' police said.
   Ms. Aldrete, 24, was being held by Mexico City police. She was
arrested along with four other men following Saturday's shootings.
   Kiloy said he was disappointed when he first heard of
Constanzo's violent end.
   ``It's unfortunate in a way that he was killed,'' said Kilroy.
``He could have revealed a lot of drug information. He could have
revealed a lot of drug sources.''
   Kilroy said he and his wife, Helen, have tried not to think
about the savage death of their son, instead concentrating on a
non-profit foundation they have created in his name to fight drugs.
   ``We're definitely putting our feelings and energy into the
fight against drugs,'' Kilroy said. ``For that reason, we don't
look back. We try to look forward.''

   Police opened fire when rival groups of
Moslems rioted during Islamic celebrations in the western town of
Mangrol and at least 13 people were killed, news reports said today.
   At least 50 people were injured in the clash Sunday night in
Mangrol, about 590 miles southwest of New Delhi, The Times of India
said.
   It was not immediately clear how many people died from police
fire and or when the Moslems battled each other with swords, steel
bars, stones and bottles, according to news reports.
   They did not say what prompted the clash in the remote area of
Gujarat state.
   United News of India and Press Trust of India said police opened
fire to quell the violence and that a deputy police superintendent
was seriously injured by the mob.
   The trouble started during celebrations of Eid al-Fitr, the
feast marking the end of the holy Ramadan month of fasting from
dawn to dusk.
   Moslems form 11 percent of India's 880 million people. Hindus
make up about 80 percent of the population.

<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France has told New Zealand it
soon will start a new round of nuclear testing in the South Pacific
despite strong regional opposition, a government official said
today.
   France has conducted 103 underground nuclear tests on the
Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls since 1975.
   Deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer said he discussed the
issue with Prime Minister Michel Rocard of France on Sunday while
the two were in the French territory of New Caledonia for the
funeral of slain independence leader Jean-Marie Tjibaou and his
aide Yeweine Yeweine.
   They were assassinated Thursday on the island of Ouvea.
   Palmer, in an interview with Radio New Zealand, said Rocard was
aware of strong regional sentiments against nuclear testing but
that it was beyond his power to do away with the program.
   Disarmament Minister Fran Wilde said Rocard's comments were
unacceptable to Pacific island nations.
   ``There is an urgent need to stop the nuclear tests ... and the
time to act is now,'' she said. ``New Zealand will continue not
only its strong opposition to the French testing program in the
Pacific but also its active promotion of a comprehensive test ban
treaty.''

<HEAD>China's Unemployment Rate to Jump This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's unemployment rate of 2 percent will rise
to about 3.5 percent this year as more people compete for fewer
jobs, an official newspaper said today.
   The China Daily quoted Xi Zhongsheng of the State Commission for
Restructuring the Economy as saying 10 million people will be
looking for work this year with just 5 million jobs guaranteed by
the state.
   Jobs are scarce this year mainly because the government, in an
austerity program to combat inflation and too-rapid economic
growth, has canceled or suspended thousands of construction
projects and cut off credit for new investment.
   Factory managers also have been given greater authority to hire
and fire workers, and have been encouraged to reduce the number of
employees.
   It has been estimated that 20 million to 30 million of China's
135 million workers are not really needed by their employers.
Workers are rarely fired and get paid regardless of whether there
is work to keep them busy.
   The actual number of unemployed is thought to be far higher than
government estimates because official figures apply to the nation's
urban workers, not rural laborers who have left farms in search of
jobs.
   Millions of people have given up farming to find work in rural
enterprises during the past decade of economic reforms, and
millions more have flocked to cities for jobs in the booming
construction and service industries.
   Since the austerity program was put into effect last fall,
however, construction jobs have dried up and many rural industries
have gone bankrupt because of a lack of credit and materials.
   According to government figures, about 2.7 million workers were
jobless last year. If 10 million additional people enter the work
force this year and the unemployment rate rises to 3.5 percent,
more than 5 million people would be without jobs.

   The dollar gained against the yen on Monday, and
the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index topped the 34,000 mark for a
record high.
   The dollar finished trading at 134.52 yen, up 0.67 yen from last
Tuesday's closing of 133.85. It opened at 134.43 yen, and ranged
between 134.40 and 134.70.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, the stock market's main
barometer, closed at 34,135.24, up 180.25 points or 0.53 percent.
   The political situation is now seen as more stable following
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's announcement two weeks ago that
he will resign, said a trader at an American securities firm.
   ``The political situation doesn't seem to be affecting the
market that much,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Traders described the dollar-yen currency market as quiet. ``The
dollar was strong for commercial reasons,'' said Midori Takeuchi, a
trading officer at Chemical Bank's Tokyo office. ``As usual for a
Monday, importers drove up the market buying dollars for the week's
transactions.''
   Both markets had been closed since Tuesday for several national
holidays and the regular weekend break.

<HEAD>Police Say Husband Implicated Wife In Babies' Deaths</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man whose two infant daughters died under
similar circumstances within three years told police his wife was
upset after giving birth, apologizing both times for not having
boys.
   Robert Sims implicated his wife in the deaths, and said he
thought the deaths were accidents, authorities said Sunday. The
couple had told police the infants were abducted from their home.
   Police Sgt. Rick McCain said investigators may have enough
evidence to file charges against Sims and his wife, Paula, but
added, ``I want to make sure we have all our ducks in a row.''
   McCain has said the Simses are the prime suspects in the
suffocation death April 29 of their 6-week-old daughter, Heather
Lee, but that officials were awaiting the results of FBI tests on
evidence before making arrests.
   The Simses also are suspects in the 1986 death of their
13-day-old daughter, Loralei, according to Jersey County Sheriff
Frank Yocom.
   McCain said Sims, 37, told him the night of April 29, when Mrs.
Sims reported Heather had been abducted, that Sims was ``somewhat
suspicious'' of her story but that both deaths were accidental.
   In the latest case, Mrs. Sims, 30, told police that a masked
gunman knocked her unconscious April 29, and that she believed he
took Heather. She said her husband was at work.
   A fisherman found Heather's body in a trash can Wednesday across
the Mississippi River in Missouri. The child's body had been
refrigerated since her death, about the time Mrs. Sims reported her
abducted, McCain said earlier.
   Mrs. Sims' account was nearly identical to one the couple gave
authorities in Loralei's case.
   The remains of a child believed to be Loralei's were found about
a week after her disappearance near the couple's home in nearby
Brighton, where the couple then lived.
   McCain said that Sims on Thursday night said ``he was unsure of
his wife's masked gunman story and that his wife might be involved
in the deaths of both his daughters.''
   The couple, who have been staying with Mrs. Sims' parents in
nearby Cottage Hills, have refused to comment. A person who
answered the phone at the home Sunday hung up when a reporter
identified himself.
   The Simses' attorney, Donald Groshong, was not at home Sunday
and could not be reached for comment. Groshong, however, has said
his clients are innocent.
   The Simses' 15-month-old son, Randy, was taken into state
custody on Friday after Sims told police the boy might be in
danger, McCain said.
   Yocom said Sunday that after Loralei's birth, Mrs. Sims asked
her roommate at the hospital what sex child she had had.
   When the roommate said she had had a boy, the sheriff said, Mrs.
Sims said, ``I wish we would have had a boy.''
   ``The next day she made an apologetic call to her husband,
crying, saying she was sorry she did not have a boy,'' Yocom said.
   McCain said Mrs. Sims made similar statements after giving birth
to Heather.

   The governing party declared victory
early Monday for its presidential candidate, Gonzalo Sanchez de
Lozada, who was poised in unofficial returns to upset former
military ruler Hugo Banzer Suarez.
   No contender won an absolute majority in Sunday's balloting,
however, so law required that the new congress select the president.
   While Banzer still held a razor-thin and shrinking lead in
unofficial returns, the campaign chief of Sanchez de Lozada's
party, Andres Petricevic, projected that he would win 29 percent of
the vote to 27 percent for Banzer.
   The balloting was peaceful as voters in this impoverished nation
stood patiently in lines to choose from among nine candidates to
replace 81-year-old President Victor Paz Estenssoro, who is
retiring from politics.
   Voters also chose representatives for all 27 senate seats and
all 130 house seats. According to the constitution, lawmakers must
choose the president from among the top three finishers when no
candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote.
   An independent television station, the Bolivian Television
Association, said Banzer of the center-right Nationalist Democratic
Action party had won 27.8 percent of the vote and 27.4 percent for
Sanchez de Lozada of the Conservative Revolutionary Nationalist
Movement.
   It based its computerized projections on a tally of 851,437
votes of the estimated 1.8 million cast nationwide.
   Jaime Paz Zamora of the Social Democratic Movement of the
Revolutionary Left was running third with 193,609 votes or 22.7
percent. Six other contenders trailed far behind.
   Banzer's percentages slipped steadily from more than 30 percent
in initial returns, and another station, American Television,
predicted Sanchez de Lozada would pull ahead as more votes from the
countryside came in.
   Banzer, the front-runner in polls, was known to be strong in the
cities, where the vote was counted first, while Sanchez de Lozada
and Paz Zamora were counting on heavy support from rural areas,
where the vote was tabulated more slowly.
   National election officials said they would not release any
returns until at least midday today. They said the complete count
would take nearly three weeks as ballots trickle in from remote
areas.
   The new congress convenes on Aug. 4, and will have two days to
decide on a new president, who is to be inaugurated for a four-year
term on Aug. 6.
   Banzer had hoped for a convincing win, by at least 5 percentage
points, to oblige congress to declare him president.
   Sanchez de Lozada said he was confident he could win the
presidency in congressional negotiations if he finished first or a
close second.
   Even if Banzer maintained his lead, he ran the risk of being
denied the presidency for the second straight time. He finished
first in the 1985 election, but congress picked the runner-up,
Estenssoro, whose Revolutionary Nationalist Movement had formed an
alliance with the third-place Movement of the Revolutionary Left to
shut out Banzer.
   The election day calm was notable in what was once was South
America's most politically volatile nation. Bolivia suffered 13
military coups this century and had nine governments between 1978
and 1982.
   No serious violence was reported on Sunday.
   Opposition parties made some complaints of fraud, and
authorities said three people were arrested for carrying several
different identity cards, apparently to vote more than once. A La
Paz provincial official was arrested for voting twice, officials
said.
   Nonetheless, election officials said they had no evidence of
widespread irregularities, and foreign observers said their initial
impression was of a fair vote.
   Garcia Pintos, an Uruguayan observer, said, ``Voters are being
provided with all guarantees. We haven't seen any sign of
irregularities.''
   Spirits ran high despite the long waits to cast ballots, which
were multicolored to help the 37 percent of the 6.7 million
population who are illiterate.
   ``This is a step forward for democracy,'' said La Paz
businessman Martin Cariaga as he waited. ``It's another example of
the maturity of the country.''
   Banzer, 62, seized power in a bloody coup in 1971 that toppled a
leftist military dictatorship. He ruled until 1978, when popular
pressure obliged him to call elections.
   Banzer, Sanchez de Lozada and Paz Zamora pledged to continue the
government's battle against cocaine production and trafficking. The
United States provides about $55 million a year for drug programs
to reduce coca leaf cultivation in Bolivia's jungles.
   An estimated 300,000 Bolivians depend on coca leaf farming,
cocaine processing or trafficking for their livelihood, government
figures show. Coca leaves are the raw ingredient in cocaine.

   Residents of this border city say the
woman believed to have been the ``high priestess'' in a
drug-running cult that sacrificed 15 people should be severely
punished.
   ``The people here want her to be burned in the plaza,'' said
farmer Jose Luis Martinez.
   Sara Maria Aldrete, a Texas college honor student described as
the ``godmother'' or ``witch'' of the cult, was arrested Saturday
night in Mexico City along with four others suspected of belonging
to the drug ring.
   The drug cult's ``godfather,'' Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, was
shot to death, apparently ordering one of his followers to kill him
when he realized he was going to be arrested.
   Mexican officials last month located 15 bodies at or near a
ranch west of Matamoros. The dead, including a U.S. college
student, are believed to be the victims of a cult that performed
human sacrifices and mutilations to bring magical protection to
drug smuggling.
   The father of one victim said he was not surprised Constanzo was
slain.
   ``The world wanted him caught,'' said James Kilroy, father of
Mark Kilroy, whose remains were found in a mass grave April 11.
``There were very few people who would put up with a guy like him.''
   ``It's unfortunate in a way that he was killed,'' said Kilroy
from his home in Sante Fe, Texas. ``He could have revealed a lot of
drug information. He could have revealed a lot of drug sources.''
   Kilroy said he and his wife, Helen, have tried not to think
about the savage death of their son, instead concentrating on a
non-profit foundation they have created in his name to fight drugs.
   ``We're definitely putting our feelings and energy into the
fight against drugs,'' Kilroy said. ``For that reason, we don't
look back. We try to look forward.''
   Ms. Aldrete, brought out into public for questioning by
reporters in Mexico City, said Sunday she had nothing to do with
the killings and learned about them on television.
   Mexican officials say some of the men in custody in the case
have reported that she played a major role in the cult's activities.
   Across the river in Brownsville, Sheriff Alex Perez said,
``Whatever she gets (in punishment), it won't be enough.''
   Of Constanzo, the sheriff added, ``I think that he should have
maybe died a little slower death, because that guy, he was a very
dangerous man.''
   The savagery with which the cult went about its drug-running
business stunned this border city's populace once the macabre,
ritual-tinged activities became known.
   Some say they'll regularly look back over their shoulders for a
while.
   ``It won't be as tranquil as before,'' Martin Cortez Alvarez,
25, said Sunday. ``Never, or at least not for a while.''

<TEXT>
   A self-described Jewish grandmother and a
no-nonsense Italian-American attorney top a crowded Democratic
primary field fighting for the legacy of the late Mayor Richard S.
Caliguiri.
   Sophie Masloff, a city councilwoman who succeeded Caliguiri
after his death last May, has been reported in recent polls to be
running neck-and-neck with Allegheny County controller Frank
Lucchino. Four other candidates trail.
   The winner of the May 16 primary should be the favorite in the
November. Democrats make up 82 percent of the city's 220,000
voters, compared to just 13 percent who are Republicans.
   The GOP hasn't held the mayor's office since 1933 and there are
no Republicans candidates for mayor yet.
   The Democratic contenders are battling for the right to continue
the work of Caliguiri, who was credited with transforming
Pittsburgh from a sickly steelmaking town to a proud and
progressive service-oriented city of 365,000.
   The popular Caliguiri held the office for 11 years and twice won
re-election by landslides before dying at 56 of a rare protein
buildup in his heart.
   Mrs. Masloff, 71, a Democratic loyalist for more than 50 years,
was city council president before succeeding Caliguiri.
   She often invokes her predecessor's memory, proudly proclaiming
their ``shoulder-to-shoulder'' work in City Hall, particularly in a
1985 drive to keep the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team in town.
Caliguiri's widow, Jeanne, has endorsed her.
   In her year at the helm, Mrs. Masloff has cut the city's wage
tax to 3.5 percent from 4 percent, paved selected streets and put
more police officers into the fight against drugs.
   In addition to stressing her experience, Mrs. Masloff seeks to
exploit her grandmotherly image and neighborhood folksiness.
   ``I'm Sophie to everybody,'' she says. ``Nobody says mayor and
nobody says Mrs.''
   
   Lucchino, 50, is a third-term controller and former city
councilman who also emphasizes his blue-collar and neighborhood
roots. But he counters Mrs. Masloff's grandmotherly image with that
of a no-nonsense administrator.
   ``My number one priority is economic development and jobs,''
Lucchino said.
   Using a large campaign chest that opponents charge was garnered
from rich and Republican supporters, Lucchino has aired television
spots showing him in rolled-up shirtsleeves fighting for steel
workers and other industrial jobs.
   Lucchino has won the endorsement of the city's two daily
newspapers.
   City Controller Tom Flaherty, 38, has the local party's
endorsement, but his campaign hasn't caught fire. Polls have shown
him drawing the support of 15 percent or less of likely Democratic
voters, behind Masloff and Lucchino at between 20 percent and 30
percent each.
   The other candidates include Byrd R. Brown, 59, an attorney and
self-described liberal who led the local branch of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People in the 1950s and
'60s; and Thomas J. Murphy Jr., 44, a state representative who
talks about neighborhood service and a high-technology future for
the city.
   Gary Henderson, 45, a little-known committeeman, stopped
campaigning for lack of funds but remains on the ballot.

   The dollar rose to a seven-month high against the
yen, and the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index closed at a record
high today after a long holiday.
   The dollar closed at 134.52 yen, up 0.67 yen from last Tuesday's
close of 133.85 yen. After opening at 134.43, it ranged between
134.40 yen and 134.70 yen.
   The dollar, which has gained 3.35 yen since April 25, closed at
its highest level since 134.58 on Sept. 27.
   Takaharu Murayama, a dealer at Sumitomo Bank, said the Bank of
Japan had intervened by selling about $200 billion, but that did
not seem to curb the dollar's advance.
   ``The Bank of Japan's intervention was not so much to keep the
dollar at a certain price, but to compensate for a shortage'' of
dollars due to the long weekend, he said.
   Japan celebrated a series of holidays last week, and financial
markets were closed Wednesday through Friday in addition to the
usual weekend closing.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, the stock market's main
barometer, closed at 34,135.24, up 180.25 points, or 0.53 percent.
   Kenji Ishizuka, a stock trader at Daiwa Securities, said, ``In
the morning, large manufacturing operations like steels and ship
building were traded heavily, but in the afternoon the action
shifted to electricals and financial issues.''

   A thinning crowd of opposition voters
waited patiently by the light of flickering fires as their ballots
were painstakingly counted by precinct officials.
   Some had voted early Sunday morning and had come back to watch
the count proceed into the night.
   ``They're not going to steal it this time. I'm going to stay
here until dawn,'' said a woman in a red blouse and pearls.
   Opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara claimed the
government that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega controls planned to
steal the election, as it is thought to have done in 1984.
   ``They're rabid for Endara here. I couldn't even wear my
(Carlos) Duque button, I was afraid they'd spit at me,'' said Wilma
Reina, among the few government supporters in this well-to-do
opposition stronghold.
   Opposition to Noriega is strong in Panama's business community
while the general gets much support from the lower classes.
   At box 2472, one of seven set up in a dusty empty lot, election
officials had sat in a shed at a rough wooden table with party
pollwatchers arrayed behind.
   Voters stepped up to the bench and profferred their
identification cards, which were checked by all and punched.
   An elderly man was guided to the correct booth; a man whose ID
card did not quite match the registration list was allowed to cast
his ballot after a quick discussion.
   ``The instructions say to assume minor problems are just
mistakes or typos,'' said one official.
   By the time the polls closed 281 people had voted out of 348
registered to box 2472.
   ``I was hoping for a higher turnout,'' fretted one opposition
worker. ``We need to win big here.''
   Poll workers burned unused ballots and other voting material on
the ground in front of the booth; smoke drifted across the booths
for hours.
   At 7 p.m., two hours after the polls closed, the count was
progressing slowly as more than 200 people watched at the seven
booths.
   Poll workers and watchers took turns opening envelopes and
reading the contents aloud. Laughter broke out when white cards
with the words ``I abstain'' printed in purple ink fell out of two
envelopes.
   ``The slower it goes, the better for us,'' muttered a lone
soldier from Noriega's Defense Forces.
   After the cardboard urn was finally emptied, at 9:30 p.m.,
everyone read their totals; when counts varied, the ballots were
counted one-by-one.
   An argument arose over how to inscribe the totals on the
official tally that goes to the Election Tribunal _ in figures or
also written out.
   ``If you don't write it out they'll put a one in front and
change the vote,'' said Alcibiades Broce, an Endara pollwatcher.
   Eduardo Martin, poll president, replied angrily.
   ``You should at least consult me before you decide,'' he said.
``There was nothing in the instructions about writing out any
numbers.''
   ``Stop discussing it and let's move on. We're wasting time and I
have a date,'' said a government party poll watcher.
   Meanwhile, poll secretary Yadira Funt was scribbling busily.
   ``I'm writing them out and that's the end of it. You're all
boobs,'' she announced.
   The total came to 229 votes for Endara, 43 for Duque, seven null
ballots and two abstentions. ``This is not our territory. They
rolled over us here,'' said Alexis Tulloch, a Duque man.
   He gazed glumly at the BMWs and Mercedes Benz parked nearby and
said he had gotten up at 4 a.m. to take the bus from Tocumen, a
working class district 16 miles to the east.
   Only 25 people were still watching as the total was announced.
The woman in the red blouse who had announced she planned to see
the dawn was not among them.

   The nation's farmers are beginning
to sow their fields for this year's crops, but probably not with
their first choice of seed since producers were so badly hurt by
last summer's devastating dry spell.
   ``It dramatically reduced the amount of seed produced,'' said
Harley J. Otto, executive vice president of the Minnesota Crop
Improvement Association, which certifies seed for certain
standards. Minnesota leads the nation in the number of acres of
certified seed.
   ``The more popular, better producing seeds are in short
supply,'' he said.
   Last summer's drought slashed yields of corn and soybean seed by
as much as 35 percent.
   The small crop forced seed producers such as Northrup King Co.
and Cargill Inc. to deplete reserves and call upon winter
production facilities. More than two decades had passed since
Northrup was forced to rely on winter facilities in Texas and
Argentina, the company said.
   Although farmers got all the corn seed they needed, not all got
the top-of-the line seed they wanted.
   ``They got good hybrids. But if they had a choice, they probably
would have chosen a different one,'' said Don Jacoby, Northrup's
vice president of agri-products sales.
   ``We did not have enough of our top-line hybrids for the central
and southern corn belt. We had to ration them out,'' said Bruce
Priebe, president of Cargill Hybrid Seeds.
   And if the drought continues, seed producers say some farmers
may be lucky to get quality seed at all for the 1990 growing season.
   ``If we have another drought this year, it's going to affect our
whole industry very severely,'' said A.G. Laos, vice president of
Northrup's U.S. agri-products group. ``It would be a major
catastrophe for the industry and for agriculture here in the U.S.''
   David L. Thomas, Northrup's executive marketing director, said
if the drought repeats itself, last year's dry spell will seem like
``playtime'' in comparison.
   ``It'll just be a disaster,'' he said.
   Jack Riopelle, owner of the 850-acre Riopelle Seed Farm in the
northwest Minnesota town of Argyle, agreed.
   ``This year will be a little tighter than it usually is,'' said
Riopelle, who lost one-fourth of his wheat, barely, soybean and pea
seed crop to last year's dryness. ``We'll be able to survive, but
it's going to be a pinch. If we have another drought, a person can
hold out only for so long.''

<TEXT>
   Nearly a half century has passed since
``Archie'' artist Bob Montana hung out at The Chocolate Shop,
drawing cartoons on napkins and gossiping with classmates who would
later inspire Veronica, Betty and company.
   But those days didn't seem very far away as the Haverhill High
School Class of 1940 met Sunday for the opening of an exhibit on
Archie, recalling their mischievious youth and how it was captured
in the comic strip adventures of freckle-faced Archie Andrews and
his hapless mates Jughead and Moose.
   Montana died in 1975, but the comics continue to be published,
along with a Saturday cartoon show.
   ``Let me tell you a secret. When I left high school I had 300
afternoon sessions to make up,'' said Arnold Daggett, the widely
accepted prototype for Moose. With his snowy white crewcut and
friendly, square-jawed face, the 68-year-old Daggett was
unmistakably the vintage version of hearty, football-playing Moose.
   Daggett said he did not know of his celebrity status until the
exhibit was organized, but he said he recognizes himself in one
strip _ ``where I was getting kicked out of class.''
   Others, such as Charlie Hayden who first saw the comics as a
serviceman abroad, said they recognized landmark statues and the
high school newspaper ``The Brown &amp; Gold.''
   Rita Walker, who lived two streets away from Montana, said she
recognized Haverhill High almost immediately when Archie burst on
the American comic scene in 1941, cheering at football games,
driving high school principal Mr. Weatherbee crazy and hanging out
at The Chok'lit Shop, Montana's spelling of the popular Haverhill
spot.
   ``The Chocolate Shop _ we all knew darn well where the Chocolate
Shop was. He used to go there all the time and draw cartoons on
napkins,'' said Mrs. Walker.
   All the graduates agreed that Daggett is Moose, partly because
of a high school cartoon of Daggett the football star that is very
similar to Moose the comic strip character. But on the other
characters, theories abound.
   Archie experts differ as to whether other Archie characters are
direct caricatures or composites. At the exhibit, excerpts from
Montana's diary were shown that contained many references to his
high school experiences.
   Montana traveled the vaudeville circuit with his parents as a
child and then lived in Boston's theater district. His years in
Haverhill were his first encounter with small-town life, said his
widow, Peggy Bertholet, now remarried.
   ``I think he enjoyed high school so much that he was more the
average American high school student than most high school students
are,'' she said.
   Mrs. Walker described Montana the high school boy as ``a tall,
lanky kid. To me, he appeared to be a shy guy from the outside
looking in and wishing he could be hellions like some of them
were.''
   In the years since his 1941 debut, Archie has swapped his
checked knickers for blue jeans and tackled such up-to-date issues
as dyslexia, but he and his friends haven't lost the concept of
idealized youth, said Brian Walker, exhibit director of the Museum
of Cartoon Art in Rye Brook, N.Y.
   Archie was the brainchild of John Goldwater, a partner in the
New York publishing company where Montana worked as an artist. From
the beginning, the comics strove for a humorous approach to
real-life issues, said Michael Silberkleit, chairman of the current
Archie Comic Publications Inc., whose father, Louis, was a company
founder.

   U.S. congressional observers, charged with
reporting to President Bush on the fairness of Panama's election,
watched, talked, questioned and came away with mixed reactions to a
presidential vote Latin-style.
   ``It is good that they are here,'' said Jorge Eliezer Miranda,
an 18-year old voting for the first time and representing the
governing party at a precinct in the town of Chilibre, about 20
miles south of the Atlantic Ocean side of the Panama Canal.
   ``They can show the world this is a democratic, not a Communist
country, as the oppositon claims,'' Miranda said during the Sunday
polling.
   ``You don't stand in line for two hours,'' said Rep. Lawrence
Coughlin, R-Pa., ``unless you hope for a free and honest election.''
   The Panamanian government did not issue visas to the Bush
observers and said they were not welcome. But the Americans came
into a U.S. military installation here and obtained visas under
terms of the Panama Canal treaties.
   The Panamanian government also invited teams of international
observers, including former President Jimmy Carter.
   But at the precinct level, Coughlin and Rep. Allan Mollohan,
D-West Virgina, received mostly warm welcomes and were allowed to
enter voting booths following reports that some party ballots were
missing or stolen.
   ``Anything else we can do for you?'' asked Gladys Estela de
Castro after showing the Bush observers around at a school in Buena
Vista, about 10 miles south of Colon.
   The observers noted what a Panamanian called ``normal
irregularities,'' meaning opening delays at voting precincts, late
arrivals of some party representatives or of some documents needed
by precinct officials.
   More serious charges included accusations that soldiers loyal to
Defense Forces chief Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega _ allowed by law
to vote at any polling station _ were being bused to different
places to vote repeatedly.
   However, most of the alleged violations were ``somewhere else,''
reported by ``someone who was told about them by someone else.''
   ``I do not think we have seen any hard evidence,'' said
Mollohan, referring to the possibility of outright fraud at the
precinct level.
   ``If they are going to do it, it will be at the place where all
the votes are tallied,'' Mollohan said. ``That's what I would like
to see.''
   ``The general belief is that the election will be stolen
sometime tonight,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., as polls closed
at 5 p.m. Sunday.
   ``Watch the counting, watch the counting'' an old lady softly
urged the congressmen as they went by. ``Everything is fine now,
but that's where the problem is going to be,'' she added wagging
her finger.
   A precinct official smiled and pointed her finger upward when
asked where the possibility of fraud was as she indicated it would
be done somewhere up along the line to the National Electoral
Tribunal.
   Albatina Gill, government candidate for a National Assembly
seat, met with the congressmen and told them she expected
differences with the United States over Noriega's de facto rule
would end soon.
   ``I believe in (government presidential candidate Carlos)
Duque's capacity and in the understanding of the government of the
United States to find a solution.''
   Carter, who led a non-official U.S. delegation from the Council
of Freely Elected Heads of State and signed the Canal Treaties, was
met with applause at polling precincts.
   ``I have checked with the opposition and the government
representatives at the polls ... and they don't seem to have any
problems at the places where I have been,'' Carter said.
   Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., also with the Bush delegation, said,
``People feel very strongly about this election.''
   Noting polls that favor the opposition, he said, ``It is going
to be difficult to have a fraudulent election and overcome what the
polls indicate.''

<HEAD>Indian Spearfishing Subsides After Hundreds Of Arrests</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAC DU FLAMBEAU, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All but two bands of Chippewa
Indians called off their treaty-protected spearfishing outings a
day after the state's general fishing season opened amid mass
protests and hundreds of arrests.
   ``We're not giving in to anything,'' Michael Allen, tribal
chairman of the Lac du Flambeau band, said Sunday.
   Calling off spearfishing was ``a gesture of good will that
neither the state officials nor the people of northern Wisconsin
deserve _ but that we are freely offering them anyway,'' Allen said.
   The spearfishing season, which coincides with the spring
spawning of walleye pikes, normally ends in the beginning of May.
   Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, who tried and failed last week to win a
federal court order ending spearfishing Friday night, expressed
relief at the announcement.
   ``I think people are tired, and it's been pushed as far as it
could be and as far as it should be,'' Thompson said. ``I'm glad
it's over. It's been a very trying, emotional period of time.''
   This is the fifth year the six Chippewa bands have speared
walleyes and other game fish from northern Wisconsin lakes off
reservations since a federal court ruling in 1983. That decision
held that the tribe retained rights to hunt, fish, trap and gather
wild grain in 19th century treaties that ceded most of the northern
third of Wisconsin to the United States.
   Chippewa spearfishing began April 23. More than 200 opponents of
the Indians' treaty rights have been arrested, primarily at lakes
used by the Lac du Flambeau band, when crowds crossed police lines
set up at boat landings used by tribal fishermen.
   This year's protests were larger than in previous years. More
than 200 opponents of the Indians' treaty rights have been arrested
since the season began.
   Opposition grew after state and court rules allowed tribal
fishermen to take up to 100 percent of what was considered a safe
catch _ or the number that could be taken without hurting the fish
population _ from the 254 lakes the tribe targeted for spearing.
The result is a reduction in the daily bag limit of walleyes for
sport fishermen using many of the lakes.
   The tribal catch wound up being much smaller than last year
despite the concerns of spearfishing opponents.
   The state Department of Natural Resources said the Chippewa as
of Sunday had taken a total of only 15,725 walleyes, including
8,326 taken by the Lac du Flambeau band.
   By contrast, about 25,900 were caught last year, and the tribal
fishing goal this year had been set at 43,801. The estimated catch
by non-Indian anglers last year was 672,000 walleyes.
   Allen said tribal officials would consult with spearers to
decide if and when to resume spearing.

   Surrounded by police, the leader of a
drug-smuggling cult accused of the ritual mutilation-slayings of 15
people along the U.S. border ordered a subordinate to kill him or
suffer in the afterlife.
   ``He said to kill him because if I didn't it was going to go
very badly for me in hell,'' Alvaro de Leon Valdez, 22, told a news
conference Sunday.
   De Leon killed cult leader Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo and the
ringleader's right-hand man with a machine gun as police closed in
on the Mexico City apartment where the gang was hiding, the
Attorney General's office said.
   ``He went crazy, crazy'', de Leon Valdez said.
   De Leon Valdez, along with four other people including
24-year-old Sara Maria Aldrete Villarreal, described by authorities
as the ``witch'' of the cult, were arrested after Saturday's
shootout.
   The Attorney General's office presented the five to reporters on
Sunday. They stood behind a table covered with cult items found in
the apartment, including two swords, black candles, a skull
apparently made of white wax and a blindfolded doll holding another
doll.
   Authorities have said they believe Constanzo, 26, and Ms.
Aldrete directed human sacrifices, mutilations and the boiling of
brains and other organs in rituals to bring occult protection to
their ring, which dealt mostly in marijuna.
   The bodies of the victims, including a University of Texas
student, were found buried on a ranch in Matamoros near the U.S.
border beginning April 11.
   Ms. Aldrete, who referred to Constanzo as el Padrino, or
Godfather, said she had nothing to do with the slayings and learned
about them in television reports.
   ``I couldn't believe it. It was amazing,'' said the former honor
student at Texas Southmost College in Brownsville, Texas.
   The search for Mark Kilroy of Santa Fe, Texas, who disappeared
while on spring break in Matamoros, across the border from
Brownsville, led to discovery of the bodies at the Santa Elena
Ranch.
   Asked who killed Kilroy, Ms. Aldrete said: ``Adolfo.''
   De Leon Valdez said he was present when the young American was
killed with a machete chop to the head. Kilroy's spinal column was
removed for a necklace, he said.
   ``I feel sorry because when he disappeared I was trying to help
the (Kilroy) family,'' Ms. Aldrete said in response to reporters'
questions. She did not elaborate.
   Ms. Aldrete said that shortly before Constanzo was killed he was
shouting that he and close associate Martin Quintana Rodriguez
should be ``killed since everything was finished for them.''
   ``He was telling him `do it, do it. If you don't do it, you're
going to pay with circumstances in hell.'''
   Their bodies were found slumped together inside a tiny closet of
the apartment.
   Ms. Aldrete told authorities Constanzo had invited her to join
``Christian Santeria'' and asked her to use voodoo to help people
with problems, Abraham Polo Uscanga, deputy city attorney general,
said.
   She said Constanzo initiated her into the cult in 1988.
   Asked if she was in love with Constanzo, a Cuban-American who
grew up in suburban Miami, Ms. Aldrete said, ``No, but I followed
him.''
   Santeria is a blend of Catholicism and old African beliefs that
includes animal sacrifices and is an offshoot of voodoo.
   The murders were carried out in a ``little temple,'' a small
building on the ranch, and body parts were put in a cauldron, De
Leon Valdez said.
   Bodies exhumed on the ranch had brains, hearts, sexual organs
and other parts removed.
   De Leon Valdez said Constanzo told them the people were killed
``so that it would go better for us on the road, in the future.''
   Neighbors said the group had been living for about two weeks in
the fourth-floor apartment of the rust-colored apartment building
in a quiet neighborhood of the capital.
   On Sunday, police armed with machine guns sat in a truck outside
the apartment building, saying there were there to ensure no one
tampered with evidence.
   Police sealed off the apartment. Seen through a keyhole, the
place was a shambles. A chair and bed were turned sideways and
litter was strewn about the floor.
   The others arrested were Maria del Rocio Cuevas Guerra, 43, of
Mexico City; Omar Francisco Orea, 23, a journalism student at the
National University who met Constanzo six years ago when he invited
him to take part in black magic; and Maria de Lourdes Guero Lopez,
29, whose connection to the case was not clear.
   They were were being held in Mexico on charges of homicide,
criminal association, wounding a police agent in the arrest, and
damage to property, Polo Uscanga said.

   The dollar was mixed in European trading late this
morning, and gold prices moved up.
   Traders said foreign exchange trading was calm with the dollar
moving within a narrow range. One Rome trader said ``movements were
minimal.''
   The dollar remained well supported by expectations that U.S.
interest rates would not fall and may even rise a bit because U.S.
economic growth is not slowing enough for the U.S. Federal Reserve
to ease monetary policy, they said.
   Another Rome trader said central banks would almost certainly
intervene to stem the dollar's advance, but that they would have to
increase their intervention significantly to have any effect.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar closed at 134.52 yen, up 0.67 yen from last
Tuesday. The Japanese market was closed the rest of the week for
holidays.
   Later, in London, the dollar was quoted at 134.60 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Friday:
   _1.8979 West German marks, down from $1.8988
   _1.6965 Swiss francs, down from $1.6985
   _6.4055 French francs, down from $6.4080

   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6739, compared with
$1.6740 on Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $376.95 a troy ounce, up
from $376.25 bid late Friday. At midmorning today, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $377.15.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $377, up from $375.85 bid late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 48 cents to close at a bid
$378.41.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $5.61 a troy

   The crewman who was trying to steer the Exxon
Valdez when it struck a reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound said
the captain did not appear to be drunk the night the ship ran
aground, a newspaper reported.
   ``There was no indication there was anything wrong,'' Third Mate
Gregory Cousins told the Tampa Tribune in his first interview since
the March 24 accident.
   Cousins, who Exxon has said was operating the 987-foot ship when
it hit the charted reef, has been on leave at home in Tampa
preparing his testimony on the 10 million gallon crude oil spill
for a National Transportation Safety Board hearing May 16 in
Anchorage, Alaska.
   Cousins, who described ship Capt. Joseph Hazelwood as
``extremely competent,'' defended similar statements from other
crew members about Hazelwood's apparent sobriety when the tanker
grounded.
   ``It's not like we're circling the wagons. It's just the
truth,'' Cousins said in the interview published Saturday.
   Hazelwood, of Huntington, N.Y., was fired by Exxon when tests
conducted more than 10 hours after the accident showed a
blood-alcohol level above the .04 permitted under Coast Guard
regulations. He faces trial June 20 in Valdez for allegedly
operating the vessel while drunk.
   Cousins, who was not certified to navigate the tanker in the
sound, said he is anxious to tell his side of the story, but his
attorney has advised him to wait for the NTSB hearing.
   The Associated Press was unable to reach Cousins over the
weekend because he has an unlisted telephone number.
   ``I think all the pieces have been reported, but they haven't
been put together right,'' said Cousins, who was responsible for
safety and emergency equipment on the tanker.
   He spent two days after the accident in Valdez, listened to
public reaction and was disturbed about misperceptions about tanker
crews.
   ``It's a tragedy of some enormity, you can't blame people for
being outraged,'' he said. ``Emotions were running high.''
   Cousins called the spill damage sickening but said he believes
Exxon is doing all it can with cleanup ``no matter what anyone
says.''
   He faces a Coast Guard review of his license and must testify at
state and federal trials resulting from the spill. The oil has
moved about 500 miles southwest of Valdez, fouling the shore at the
Katmai National Park wildlife refuge and other areas.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
characterized as incompetent a remark by U.S. Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney that Soviet efforts at economic restructuring would
fail, according to a magazine.
   Cheney said during a television interview April 29 that Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev ``would ultimately fail'' in his attempt
to restructure the Soviet economy and is ``likely to be replaced by
somebody who will be far more hostile'' to the West.
   ``That particular statement is incompetent and not serious. I
think President Bush understands the situation quite well when he
says perestroika is an irreversible process,'' Shevardnadze said in
an interview in the May 15 edition of Time magazine.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater last Monday said Cheney's
comments were ``personal observations'' and did not reflect the
views of the Bush administration.

   Police arrested a top dissident leader
today as part of a crackdown on anti-government groups to curb
violent protests, and the Defense Ministry warned it would block
strikes in key industries.
   Police officials announced the arrest of Lee Chang-bok, a leader
of the nation's main dissident alliance, the United National
Democratic Movement, on charges of violating national security laws.
   Officials said Lee had supported communist North Korea and
organized strikes and violent demonstrations.
   The arrest is part of a crackdown that follows the deaths last
week of six riot troopers in a clash with radical students in the
southern port of Pusan. Lee was the fourth alliance leader to be
arrested along with dozens of other suspected extremists.
   President Roh Tae-woo warned May 3 that he would invoke
emergency measures to halt a wave of violent protests and strikes.
He charged that dissidents were attempting to stage a leftist
revolution under the control of rival communist North Korea.
   Roh was to hold a Cabinet meeting Tuesday to discuss further
measures to curb protests and break up anti-government groups,
officials said.
   The Defense Ministry warned today it would use ``strong
countermeasures'' to keep strategic industries running if they are
hit by strikes. It did not specify any action, but officials have
said troops could be used to keep defense and other important
industries running.
   Defense officials, who declined to be named, said strikes in
defense industries are illegal and warned anyone organizing labor
unrest would be ``severely punished.''
   South Korea has been hit by a wave of violent anti-government
protests and labor strikes. The government has warned that efforts
by radicals to build an alliance with workers could threaten
political and economic stability.
   The government says strikes have cost the economy almost $4
billion in lost production so far this year.
   South Korean newspapers reported today that Roh would remove
some Cabinet ministers for failing to handle violent protests and
labor unrest. Government officials indicated a shakeup was
expected, but declined to provide details.
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung called over the weekend for the
entire Cabinet to resign to accept responsibility for the political
situation. Top officials in Korea traditionally resign to accept
moral responsibility for problems or failures even if it is not
their fault.
   The main opposition parties, which generally do not support the
dissidents, have called for curbs on violent protest but also
charged the government is trying to use the unrest as an excuse to
crack down on all opponents.
   Education Ministry officials said today that they would close
university student newspapers and other publications that publish
leftist or pro-North Korean articles.
   The officials, who also declined to be named, said they were
considering allowing riot police to raid college campuses to end
protests or to halt manufacture of firebombs and other weapons.
   Radical students and the anti-government dissident groups have
little support because of their violent tactics and extreme
political views. The radicals have been calling for the overthrow
of Roh and the creation of a leftist state ruled by workers and
farmers.
   Roh, a former general, won presidential elections in late 1987
after rival opposition candidates split the anti-government vote.
He has helped introduce democratic reforms but many Koreans
distrust the government because of its ties to the authoritarian
regime of former President Chun Doo-hwan.

   ``I reject this call in its totality,'' Arafat told a news

   Rafsanjani on Friday called for five Britons, French or
Americans to be killed for every Palestinian killed in the Gaza
Strip or West Bank by the Israeli army. Washington, London and
Paris condemned the statement.
   Rafsanjani is one of Iran's most prominent political
personalities and observers have said his statement of solidarity
for Palestinians, fellow Moslems, may have been motivated by
political ambition.
   He is the only declared candidate in Iranian presidential
elections scheduled for late summer.
   The 54-year-old speaker earned a reputation as a moderate
through his support for rebuilding ties with Western nations but
recently changed tack toward Islamic fundamentalist orthodoxy.
   Rafsanjani has come out in supported revolutionary patriarch
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei's call on Feb. 14 for the death of
Salman Rushdie for writing the novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' which
many Moslems consider blasphemous.
   Arafat on Sunday called on the international community ``to act
rapidly to put an end to the crimes and the massacres perpetrated
by Israel against the population of the occupied territories.''
   The Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile,
on Nov. 15 said it recognized Israel, renounced terrorism and will
work toward a peace settlement that includes a state of Israel and
a state of Palestine.
   Asked if he planned to give up the peace effort because of
continued bloodshed in the occupied lands, Arafat said: ``It is an
initiative of the Palestine National Council and it is not up to me
to modify it.''
   The PLO's peace initiative led the United States to resume a
dialogue with the organization after a decade of no contact.
   Robert H. Pelletreau Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia met
with a four-man Palestinian delegation in December and in March.
   More than 460 Palestinians have been killed since the
Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip began in December 1987.

   A man rocking a vending machine that
failed to release a can of soda was fatally injured when the
machine fell on him, authorities said.
   Lance Foster, 23, a University of Kansas student from
Stillwater, Okla., died Sunday while undergoing surgery for
injuries suffered in the Saturday accident, said Lt. Jeanne
Longaker of the university police.
   Foster told police he put 50 cents in the machine and began
rocking it back and forth when the machine did not release a can of
soda.
   Other students heard the noise and were able to lift the machine
off of Foster, Longaker said.
   Foster was taken to a Lawrence hospital and transported to the
medical center, where he died.

   Cardinal John O'Connor, who last month blasted
television as ``radioactive filth,'' says Lucille Ball's program in
the 1950s provided ``decent laughter.''
   O'Connor said Ball's ``was a TV marriage that was a good
marriage.'' He said that with her on-air pregnancy in 1953, ``she
made married pregnancy the sacrament that it is.''
   ``I was a real fan,'' he said.
   O'Connor said Sunday that Ball, who died two weeks ago in Los
Angeles, was owed a great deal for providing ``decent laughter.''
   The cardinal described her show as ``decent, human and
entertaining.''
   ``I'm not proposing her for canonization'' O'Connor said. ``She
had personal problems. She was a woman who overcame adversity.''
   A memorial Mass was scheduled for tonight in New York City.
Memorial services were also planned in Chicago and Santa Monica.

<HEAD>Shots Fired, Flares Thrown at Journalists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gunmen fired from a speeding car at a
vehicle carrying a journalist and photographer as they responded to
an anonymous telephone call about an explosion, but the two said
they were not hurt.
   Heidi von Egidy, a stringer for The Associated Press, and
free-lance photographer John Liebenburg said four bullets went
through the side and back of the car Sunday night.
   Late last week a journalist's car parked in front of the
Namibian Press Center was struck by a bullet and a military flare
was tossed into the center's garden during a cocktail party.
   Windhoek police Spokesman Kierie dur Rand said the incidents
were under investigation.
   Journalists from around the world are in Namibia to report on
the territory's transition to independence from South African
control. The United Nations is supervising the change.
   Ms. von Egidy said today that she and Liebenburg were driving on
the main road to Katatura to check on an anonymous call Liebenburg
had received at home about an explosion near police headquarters in
Windhoek's black township. The report was false.
   ``The road was deserted. There were no cars and we were not
followed. They must have been parked on the side of the road,
waiting, with their lights off,'' she said. ``We were looking the
other way when they started shooting. We just ducked.
   ``They drove close to John's side of the car, not a meter (yard)
away, with their headlights on bright, and immediately afterwards
disappeared down a side street. It was well planned. I'm sure they
were trying to kill John.''
   She said Liebenburg had been on his way to her home for coffee
when he received the call, so he took her along to check on the
explosion report.
   Kevin Jacobs, a correspondent for the South African newspaper
chain Times Media Limited said a military flare was thrown in the
press center's garden Thursday night during a cocktail party for
diplomats and U.N. officials. ``It exploded but no one was hurt,''
he said.
   Foreign journalists have their offices and residences at the
center.
   Jacobs said he was in his room reading on Saturday night when he
``heard what sounded like an explosion from the front of the
house.''
   He said he looked around in the darkness but so no evidence of
what he thought was another explosive flare. But the next morning,
a 1.6-inch hole was discovered below the front fender of a car
belonging to free-lance photographer Philip Littleton, who was out
of town.
   ``I don't think Littleton was the target. It was just the only
car in front of the press center,'' Jacobs said. ``Whoever fired it
was aiming at the fuel tank. It was a shotgun blast fired at close
range and flattened pellets were found under the car.''

<TEXT>
   A record snow continued to fall on upstate New York early today,
while rain showers fell across the middle part of the nation and
frost and freeze advisories extended from Michigan to South
Carolina.
   In western New York, more than 11 inches of snow had fallen by
early today in Rochester, and more than 8 inches had blanketed
Buffalo, setting snowfall records in both cities for May. The snow
was mixing with rain early this morning, leaving only an inch of
snow on the ground in both cities by 3 a.m. EDT.
   Frost and freeze advisories were in effect today over lower
Michigan, Indiana, western Ohio, eastern Kentucky, West Virginia,
southwest Virginia and inland areas of the Carolinas.
   Record-low temperatures were broken or tied Sunday in more than
30 cities, with temperatures fluctuating widely in some areas.
Temperatures at Manhattan, Kan., climbed from a low of 30 degrees
on Sunday morning to an unusually warm high of 88 degrees in the
afternoon.
   More record lows were expected today. Asheville, N.C., was down
to 30 degrees at 3 a.m. EDT.
   Elsewhere today, rain showers fell from Minnesota to Nebraska
and scattered showers dampened the northern Rockies and parts of
northern California.
   Skies were clear across most of the southern half of the nation
and much of the Pacific Northwest.
   Today's forecast called for showers extending across New
England, New York and northern Pennsylvania; scattered showers and
thunderstorms across the eastern Plains and much of the Mississippi
Valley, with possible severe thunderstorms over the eastern part of
Kansas and Oklahoma and most of Missouri and Arkansas; and mostly
sunny skies elsewhere.
   Highs were expected to be in the 40s over western New York; in
the 50s and 60s from the northern Plains across the upper
Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes and much of the Ohio Valley to
the northern and middle Atlantic Coast; in the 90s over western
Texas and much of New Mexico and California; in the 100s in the
desert Southwest; and in the 70s and 80s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 28
degrees at Marquette, Mich., to 87 degrees at Blythe, Calif., and
Phoenix, Ariz.

   East German police broke up anti-government
rallies in Leipzig after nationwide voting and arrested about 100
demonstrators who were demanding democratic reforms, church and
opposition sources said today.
   About 800 people rallied Sunday after voting in municipal
elections in which candidates of the ruling Communist Party ran
unopposed, the sources said.
   About 2,000 security forces, backed by water cannon and police
dogs, were dispatched and police used loudspeakers to order the
demonstrators to disperse, said the sources, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   They said some protesters were arrested after they tried to
march from downtown to a nearby square.
   The sources said police arrested another 15 people after
officers sealed off a Lutheran church where a group of
demonstrators gathered to protest the single-candidate elections.
   They said about 100 people in all were arrested.
   Sunday's municipal elections reflected East Germany's strong
resistance to democratic reforms occurring in the Soviet Union,
Poland and Hungary.
   Some church and human rights groups had urged voters to boycott
the elections.
   State-run television reported that 98.7 percent of East
Germany's 12.4 million registered voters went to the polls. It was
the first time East Germany officially reported a turnout of less
than 99 percent.
   Communist party officials use high voter turnout figures to
claim massive support for government policies. Voters who boycott
elections or cast invalid ballots face serious repercussions.
   West German officials said hundreds of East Germans were allowed
to emigrate in the days before the elections in an apparent
government effort to prevent disturbances during the balloting.
   Police in Leipzig banned reporters from the West German
television ARD from entering the city before Sunday's demonstration.

   American soprano Kalle Esperian won over the
demanding public at La Scala Opera House, returning for curtain
call after curtain call to the stage where Italy's Katia
Ricciarelli met rejection.
   Repeatedly booed and whistled during two performances last week,
Ms. Ricciarelli irately withdrew from the opera, saying ``I'll
never sing at La Scala again.''
   The 28-year-old American received rousing applause and shouts of
``bravo'' for her role in Giuseppe Verdi`s ``Luisa Miller'' on
Sunday night.
   ``Sensational success for Esperian, the new Luisa Miller,'' the
Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera said today, reporting that the
American singer received nine consecutive curtain calls.
   ``She conquered the audience with the quality of her voice and
her dramatic charge,'' Corriere della Sera added.
   Ms. Esperian, a pupil of Italian opera star Luciano Pavarotti
and a winner of the Philadelphia opera contest in 1985, said ``it
was an unbelievable experience. I was very tense for a debut in
extremely difficult conditions. Now I am overjoyed.''
   Ms. Ricciarelli, the wife of Italian television entertainer
Pippo Baudo, had been scheduled to sing three more nights at La
Scala through May 31.
   Her appearance was also marred by clashes between Baudo and some
fans who had been critical of his wife's performance.
   Baudo confirmed in a radio interview last week that he had
kicked one man who had insulted his wife.

<HEAD>Baker Leery Of Setting Date For Bush-Gorbachev Summit</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 2nd graf to update with departure</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   On his first Soviet trip, Secretary of State
James A. Baker III will ask for cooperation in the Middle East,
Central America and other trouble spots _ and steer clear of
preparations for a superpower summit meeting until the results are
in.
   Despite several steps by Mikhail S. Gorbachev to lower tensions,
Baker set out today on his first visit to Moscow, skeptical that
the Soviet leader's actions are in line with Gorbachev's ``new
thinking.''
   Baker has publicly questioned, for instance, whether reductions
in troops and defense spending announced by Gorbachev have done
much to offset Warsaw Pact edges in some military categories in
Europe.
   Two of Baker's closest aides, briefing reporters before his
takeoff for Finland, said he would discuss a summit meeting with
Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze only if they
raised the subject.
   ``If there are reasons to have such a summit, then we would
certainly be pleased to have one,'' said one aide, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   But prospects for a meeting between President Bush and Gorbachev
depend on progress in several areas, the U.S. officials said.
   They said Baker wants Soviet cooperation in Central America and
the Middle East, in combating terrorism and in slowing the
proliferation of ballistic missiles. The officials left unclear how
much had to be accomplished before Bush would consent to a
superpower summit.
   ``The president's past position is that one should not meet just
for the sake of meeting, but rather one should have particular
topics that are ripe for heads of government to engage in,'' a
Baker aide said.
   Gorbachev took exactly that position on summitry after rising to
power in 1985. But he then went on to hold five meetings with
former President Reagan, concluding a treaty to abolish
medium-range nuclear missiles and easing tensions in Afghanistan
and on a number of other fronts.
   But the Bush administration says that is not enough.
   In Central America, the administration wants the Soviets to
sharply reduce military aid to Nicaragua. It amounted to $500
million last year. U.S.-supported rebels are trying to overthrow
the Marxist government.
   In the Middle East, the administration wants the Soviets to
muffle their calls for an international peace conference and join
Bush in pushing for direct negotiations between Israel and
Palestinians.
   Also, Baker would like the Soviets to stop providing Syria with
missiles that add to Israel's military concerns.
   ``I think that that's a very potentially important topic that
the United States has not engaged the Soviet Union in depth on in
the past,'' an official said.
   Baker, who has never been on Soviet soil either in private or
government life, is stopping first in Helsinki to catch his breath
before going on to Moscow Wednesday morning. He also will meet with
Finnish leaders whose country is Western in outlook and has a
neutral foreign policy.
   Baker will see Shevardnadze on Wednesday morning and again on
Thursday morning and Gorbachev for two hours Thursday afternoon.
   U.S. officials said he would propose that U.S. and Soviet
negotiators resume their work in Geneva the third week of June on a
treaty to reduce long-range bombers, missiles and submarines by 30
to 50 percent.
   Baker will suggest that the talks basically pick up where they
left off in November, when they were recessed with about 90 percent
of the work completed.
   But he does not intend to outline to Gorbachev and Shevardnadze
the position the United States will take on specific issues at the
bargaining table, said the officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``Essentially, we are looking for continuity and keeping arms
control on a fast track,'' an official said.
   The negotiations had been tentatively scheduled to resume in
mid-February. But Bush, after taking office in January, ordered an
indefinite postponement while the administration reviewed U.S. arms
control and weapons policies.
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators have some tough problems to resolve.
These include whether to try to restrict mobile missiles and how to
verify such elusive weapons as cruise missiles fired from airplanes
and submarines.
   Meanwhile, a senior aide to Baker said the administration had
ruled out any deal with the Soviets to impose a coalition
government in Afghanistan.
   The official said the United States had neither the inclination
nor the power to persuade the Afghan rebels to strike a deal with
President Najibullah.
   Calling for the Soviet-backed leader's ouster, the official
said, ``We do not believe we will have peace in Afghanistan'' as
long as Najibullah is in power.

   Civilians scrambled for their bunkers
today when Moslem and Christian forces resumed heavy shelling
across the city after a brief morning lull.
   Police said Syrian and allied Druse Moslem gunners pounded the
coast near the ports of Jounieh and Byblos, blocking the only
escape routes for 1 million people trapped in the besieged
Christian enclave. Christian gunners struck back with barrages of
155mm howitzer fire aimed at west Beirut's seaside districts and
around the international airport, police said.
   Thousands of residents had left their basements and underground
bomb shelters during the lull to replenish food and water supplies.
   Police said 21,500 shells and rockets were fired on Beirut's
Moslem and Christian sectors from dusk Saturday to midnight Sunday,
ending a cease-fire negotiated by the Arab League.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing rules,
said 22 people were killed and 120 wounded in the 30-hour barrage.
   Since the current round of fighting in Lebanon's 14-year-old
civil war began on March 8, 300 people have been killed and 1,131
wounded.
   Lakhdar Ibrahimi of Algeria, the Arab League assistant
secretary-general, was to return to Beirut on Tuesday to try to
revive the cease-fire, Beirut newspapers reported. The papers said
he will be accompanied by Brig. Gen. Ali Al-Momen, the Kuwaiti
commander of a 321-man observer force that will be drawn from six
Arab nations to monitor the truce that was called on April 28.
   ``The Arabs face the difficult task of shoring up the
cease-fire. Otherwise the observers will have nothing to monitor,''
the police spokesman said.
   Gaping holes were blown in scores of apartment buildings on both
sides of Beirut's Green Line, which divides the city's Moslem and
Christian sectors. Hundreds of cars smoldered on streets blanketed
with debris, glass shards and dangling power cables.
   ``They've destroyed everything I own,'' said Mahmoud Younis, a
30-year-old Moslem as he stared at his gutted electrical tools shop
in west Beirut. ``I hope they will roast in hell, all of them.''
   One shell tore through the building that houses the west Beirut
office of the British Reuters news agency and caused extensive
damage. No one was injured the agency's staff reported.
   Another shell struck the newsroom of the state-run television
station in a building in west Beirut. ``It was a miracle no one was
hurt,'' said announcer Leena Saidi. ``We're now operating from the
station's bunker.''
   The fighting pits army commander Gen. Michel Aoun's 20,000
troops, most of whom are Christians, against Syrian army forces and
the 7,000-strong militia of Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's
Progressive Socialist Party.
   The latest round began after Aoun's troops blockaded illegal
harbors run by Moslem militias south of Beirut. He said the ports
cost the state about $100 million a year in customs levies.
Jumblatt retaliated by shelling the 310-square-mile Christian
enclave north of the capital. The Syrians later joined the fighting
and sealed off the enclave's land exits.

   Sure, winning $55 million in a lottery
changed Sheelah Ryan's life. She bought a new house and a car. But
much of money goes to a foundation that helps single mothers,
abused women and lonely senior citizens.
   ``A year ago I wished I could win the lottery so I could buy
whatever I want and never have to look at another price tag again.
My wish came true, but I still look at the price tags,'' she said.
   She won $55.2 million in Florida's lottery last year, the
nation's largest individual jackpot.
   ``I guess I've disappointed a lot of people,'' she said. ``I
could be traveling all over the world, or have a beautiful mansion
on the ocean or have a chauffeur-driven Rolls Royce. ... But that's
not my style.''
   The former real-estate saleswoman heads the Ryan Foundation.
Formed in Decembver, it is building low-cost housing in
north-central Florida and is paying overdue rents to spare single
mothers and their children from eviction.
   Ryan, who lives in Winter Springs, about 10 miles from Orlando,
also wants to create a fund to grant wishes to elderly people with
only a few months to live.
   ``I don't have enough money to solve the world's problems, or
Florida's problems or even Seminole County's problems,'' she said
recently at the foundation's modest office. ``But I can make a
difference. I can help people who are going through devastating
times.''
   Ryan's spends her days meeting with the directors of charities,
politicians and clergymen to discuss projects and scouting sites
for low-cost housing.
   The lottery prize pays out $2.7 million a year for 20 years, cut
to about $1.8 million a year by taxes.
   Part of the money is invested, part goes to the foundation and
Ryan lives on an allowance. She will not disclose how much of her
winnings go to the foundation, saying only that it is a
``substantial amount.''

<HEAD>City and County Expenses Rise Faster Than Income</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   America's cities and counties, like many of
their residents, are increasing their spending faster than their
income, according to a pair of new Census Bureau reports.
   Total city and county income still exceed spending, but the gap
is narrowing, and local governments are increasingly unable to turn
to Uncle Sam for help because federal aid is declining, said the
studies released Sunday.
   Spending by the nation's cities was 7.9 percent higher in the
1986-87 fiscal year than the year before, according to the reports.
During the same period revenues rose 6.9 percent.
   The result was spending totaling $164.1 billion by the cities,
compared with revenues of $169.8 billion.
   That left cities $5.7 billion in the black for 1986-87, although
that marked a reduction from surpluses of $6.6 billion the year
before and $7.7 billion in 1984-85.
   For counties, spending rose 11.2 percent while income climbed
9.3 percent between 1985-86 and 1986-87, the Census Bureau said.
   That totaled out to $105.8 billion in revenues and $102.9
billion in expenditures, for a surplus of $2.9 billion. Counties
were $4.2 billion in the black a year earlier and $4.6 billion in
1984-85.
   The reports also showed that federal aid fell by 14.2 percent
for cities and by 7.2 percent for counties between the 1985-86 and
1986-87 fiscal years.
   Overall, cities raised 71.0 percent of the money they spent,
while counties got 63.2 percent from their own sources. For both,
the balance came primarily from federal and state assistance.
   In spending, cities put more of their money into law
enforcement, while for counties public welfare was the top
expenditure. Education was the second largest expense for both
units of government.
   Police expenses accounted for $14.8 billion of city spending, up
8.8 percent from the year before. Education cost $13.4 billion, up
8.5 percent, while highway expenditures rose 8.0 percent to $10.1
billion.
   Debt interest was the fastest-growing city expenses, climbing
14.9 percent to $9.3 billion. Spending on sewerage rose 11.4
percent to $9.1 billion.
   Among counties, public welfare costs led spending at $14.3
billion, 8.3 percent more than a year earlier.
   Second place went to education, up 9.6 percent to $14.0 billion,
followed by hospital costs, which rose 5.4 percent to $9.8 billion.
   Rounding out the top five were highways, $8.2 billion, up 8.0
percent; and general management, which was up 8.8 percent to $6.7
billion.
   Although it didn't make the top five in total spending, debt
interest was also a big gainer for counties, rising 21.8 percent to
nearly $6.7 billion.

   The Navy's newest ship made a splashy debut
as NBC News anchorman Tom Brokaw's wife, Meredith, broke a
champagne bottle across the bow of the USS Rushmore to send it into
the muddy waters of the Mississippi River.
   The Rushmore is the second ship named for the Mount Rushmore
National Memorial in the Black Hills of South Dakota.
   ``We don't get to see many ship launchings in South Dakota,''
Gov. George Mickelson said during christening ceremonies Saturday.
   But Brokaw found parallels between the dry farmland of their
home state and the oceans where the ship will sail.
   ``The people of South Dakota appreciate their oceans of land,''
he said. ``Our ancestors sailed into the state of South Dakota on
prairie schooners.''
   Nearly 300 sailors from South Dakota were killed in World War II
and through the Vietnam War, he said.
   The first USS Rushmore, also an amphibious landing ship, was
launched in 1944 and decomissioned in 1946.

<HEAD>Israelis Riot in Hometown of Slain Soldier</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police fired tear gas today to disperse crowds
of Israeli rioters who blocked streets with burning tires to
protest the slaying of a soldier that has been blamed on
Palestinian guerrillas.
   The violence occurred in Ashdod, hometown of soldier Avi
Sassportaz, whose body was found buried in a field near the
occupied Gaza Strip on Sunday. He disappeared 81 days ago while
hitchhiking home from his army base.
   The body of Sassportaz, 21, was found as more than 1,000 troops
fanned out near Gaza in search of a second missing trooper, Ilan
Saadon, 18. He was last seen Wednesday hitchhiking in southern
Israel.
   Israel radio said preliminary findings showed Sassportaz was
shot in the head several hours after he was picked up at the
Hodiyya intersection, 20 miles southwest of Jerusalem. Police said
they believe Palestinians were involved in the disappearances of
Sassportaz and Saadon.
   Industry Minister Ariel Sharon was quoted by the Hadashot daily
as telling Israelis in southern Dimona that these cases were the
result of a ``serious national blunder'' in handling the
17-month-old Arab rebellion, in which 465 Palestinians and 21
Israelis have died. He did not elaborate.
   In the Gaza Strip today, the army maintained curfews on more
than 240,000 Palestinians in refugee camps in an effort to contain
violent outbreaks. At least 158 Arabs were wounded by gunfire in
weekend clashes with soldiers, according to U.N. figures.
Saturday's wounded toll, by U.N. count, was the highest daily
figure since the start of the uprising Dec. 8, 1987. The army put
the number of wounded Saturday at 77.
   Army curfews also were maintained on eight towns or refugee
camps in the West Bank that are home to about 200,000 Palestinians.
   Sunday night and early today, more than 200 Israeli youths took
to the streets of southern Ashdod shouting ``Death to the Arabs''
and burning tires, Israel radio and the Itim news agency reported.
   A police spokesman, Eli Elimelech, said there were two violent
outbreaks in the town of 75,000, in which tear gas was fired.
   In one case, 150 people rioted during a march toward the police,
Elimelech said. Later, 300 people burned tires on a main street
corner, he said.
   National Police Commissioner David Kraus issued an appeal for
restraint.
   ``I think it is worth urging the public to demonstrate
responsibility and restraint and not to force the police to turn
forces from its main task'' of anti-guerrilla patrols, Kraus said
on Army radio.
   Newspaper editorials reflected the frustration felt by many in a
country where all men serve in the army and where soldiers rely
heavily on hitching rides to get to and from their bases.
   The soldier's death also prompted calls by right-wing mayors to
consider firing thousands of Palestinians employed by Israeli
municipalities, the Haaretz daily reported.
   About 100,000 Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip
work in Israel, most at construction sites and sanitation jobs.

<HEAD>Fusion Researchers To Present Case To Their Electrochemical Peers</HEAD>

   Two scientists under fire to prove their
claims of ``cold fusion'' go before a jury of their peers tonight
at a chemists' conclave in Los Angeles.
   University of Utah chemist B. Stanley Pons and Martin
Fleischmann of the University of Southampton in England hoped to
bolster their claims that they achieved nuclear fusion in a jar at
room temperature _ a breakthrough that, if confirmed, could open
the door to a cheap and virtually inexhaustible source of energy.
   Pons said Sunday that he and Fleischmann would present their
evidence at the Electrochemical Society's biannual meeting.
   Last week in Baltimore, scientists at a meeting of the American
Physical Society discounted the fusion claims, accusing Pons and
Fleischmann of errors.
   Physicists have been the pair's chief critics since they
announced March 23 that experiments had produced fusion using rods
of palladium in electrically charged coils of platinum immersed in
deuterium-rich heavy water.
   The two said their experiment yielded more than four times the
energy needed to produce it. Pons said he and Fleischmann would
report on later research, including ``new results that exhibit very
large amounts of excess heat.''
   If confirmed, Utah's cold fusion claims would undercut the
long-held belief that fusion, which powers the sun and hydrogen
bombs, occurs only at extremely high temperatures.

   Governing party candidate Gonzalo Sanchez
de Lozada today claimed an upset election victory over former
military dictator Hugo Banzer Suarez, but the congress will have
final say over who becomes president.
   Neither candidate appeared to have won more than 50 percent of
the vote in Sunday's election so, by law, the new congress will
choose the president.
   Nevertheless, Sanchez de Lozada's surprising finish provided a
kind of public endorsement of the government's conservative,
free-market economic program, which has included severe austerity
measures.
   It also was expected to help ensure continuity in this
impoverished country's U.S.-financed war on cocaine production and
trafficking.
   All 27 Senate and 130 House of Deputies seats were also up for
election, but officials said there would be no clear indication on
how each party had fared until later today.
   No official figures were available and the tally was expected to
take nearly three weeks to complete as votes arrived from remote
parts of the landlocked, largely undeveloped South American country.
   An independent television station, the Bolivian Television
Association, said Banzer of the center-right Nationalist Democratic
Action party led with 27.7 percent of the vote to 27.3 percent for
Sanchez de Lozada of the Conservative Revolutionary Nationalist
Movement.
   It based its computerized projections on a tally of 851,437
votes of the estimated 1.8 million cast nationwide.
   The station said, however, that Sanchez de Lozada was projected
to eventually pull ahead a percentage point when the rural vote
came in. Banzer was strong in cities, which reported their returns
quickly,. Sanchez de Lozada was counting on a big vote from the
countryside.
   Sanchez de Lozada's campaign manager, Andres Petricevic, said
his party projected a victory with 29 percent of the vote to 27
percent for Banzer.
   Late Sunday, Banzer's party refused to concede defeat but said
it would respect the ``will of the people.''
   Jaime Paz Zamora of the Social Democratic Movement of the
Revolutionary Left was running third with 204,717 votes or 22.3
percent. Six other contenders trailed far behind.
   The new congress convenes on Aug. 4 and will have two days to
select the president, whose inauguration to a four-year term is
scheduled for Aug. 6.
   Banzer, 62, had sought victory by a margin of 5 percentage
points or more to oblige congress to respect the popular vote and
name him president. He finished first in the 1985 election with
28.6 percent but congress picked the runner-up, Victor Paz
Estenssoro, who had 26.4 percent.
   The 81-year-old incumbent is retiring after a tumultuous career
that spanned half a century and included three periods as president.
   Sanchez de Lozada, 58, said on the eve of the election that he
felt confident of being picked president if he finished first or a
close second. A wealthy mine owner, he was educated in the United
States and has a philosophy degree from the University of Chicago.
   Most opinion polls showed Banzer as the front-runner this year
and he was confident enough to say his party would back whomever
finished first. He called on other parties to do the same but,
trailing in the polls, they declined.
   The vote took place in a holiday-like atmosphere, with a calm
and order remarkable for what once was the continent's most
politically volatile country. Since the turn of the century there
have been 13 coups; with nine governments between 1978 and 1982.
   Some irregularities were reported, including the arrest of three
people who carried several different identity cards and apparently
planned to vote several times. There also were reports that some
voters were given already marked ballots, but foreign observers
said they had no initial indications of widespread fraud.
   Paz Estenssoro said upon casting his ballot that the elections
would help lead Bolivians to political maturity. ``The important
thing is to consolidate democracy,'' he said.
   He launched a severe economic program when he took office in
1985 to halt economic chaos, including an annual inflation rate of
23,000 percent.
   The austerity measures included laying off 35,000 state miners
and other public workers, a tenfold increase in the price of
gasoline and a 95 percent currency devaluation.
   Banzer, Sanchez de Lozada and Paz Zamora pledged to maintain the
program, which has cut inflation to 15 percent a year and
contributed to some small economic growth for the first time in a
decade.
   In addition, they all vowed to continue the government's battle
against cocaine production and trafficking. The United States
provides about $55 million dollars a year for the efforts, which
include programs to reduce coca leaf cultivation in Bolivia's
jungles.

<HEAD>Pravda: Stalin Ignored Warnings Of Nazi Invasion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pravda told Soviet readers today that dictator
Josef Stalin had detailed information about Nazi Germany's plans to
invade the country but ignored the warnings and failed to prepare
for war.
   The full-page article in the Communist Party newspaper, the most
detailed look yet at what Soviet spies knew about Adolf Hitler's
plans, came on the eve of the 44th anniversary of the Soviet
victory in World War II.
   The article marked a sharp break from the Soviet press tradition
of publishing uncritical, patriotic reminiscences of Soviet heroism.
   The report also contrasted with a jovial mood in Moscow, which
was festooned with red banners for Tuesday's holiday. On Red Square
a large banner stated simply, ``1941-1945,'' the years of the war
in which 20 million Soviets were killed.
   Western historians have written extensively about how Stalin
ignored intelligence reports about Hitler's plans, but little has
come out in the Soviet Union. Stalin traditionally had been
portrayed as a brilliant wartime leader.
   But under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost,
or greater openness, many Soviet writers and historians have
recently condemned Stalin's political repression of millions of his
people and re-examined his wartime role.
   Last summer, Pravda published a chapter of a new book about
Stalin that denounced him for signing a friendship treaty with Nazi
Germany, purging the Red Army when the nation was on the brink of
war, and ignoring warnings that war was imminent.
   Today's article further rewrote an embarrasing page in Soviet
history.
   Pravda said the article's author, history professor A. Baidakov,
gleaned the accounts from classified state security archives.
   He said the state security agencies managed to infiltrate the
Gestapo secret police, Germany's aviation ministry and its coding
service.
   According to Baidakov, security officials promptly forwarded
information to Soviet political leaders about Hitler's invasion
plans as early as November 1940. German forces invaded June 21,
1941.
   But, the historian said:
   ``The leadership of the U.S.S.R. people's commissariats
(ministries) of state security and defense did not, in my view, do
everything to convince Stalin and the country's other leaders of
the inevitability of an imminent confrontation with the Germans.''
   Then, he added, ``But the main blame for miscalculating the time
of the start of the war, for the country not being turned into an
armed camp in time, for not being brought into a state of full
military preparedness, lies with the U.S.S.R. political leadership
of that period.''
   Baidakov revealed a series of intelligence reports forwarded to
Stalin and his foreign minister, Vyacheslav M. Molotov. In April
1941, for example, the two were told that Hitler had revealed to a
Yugoslav prince that an invasion of the Soviet Union was planned
for June.
   On June 16, this urgent message was delivered to Stalin and
Molotov: ``All military operations of Germany on preparation of a
military aggression against the U.S.S.R. have been completely
stopped, and a blow can be expected at any time.''
   The next day, Baidakov wrote, Stalin asked intelligence
officials whether the sources who wrote the message were reliable.
Before the information could be rechecked, the Germans invaded.

   A bomb extensively damaged the
home of a white legislator, but caused no injury to his wife and
daughters, who were asleep at the time, police said today.
   ``It was the first terrorist attack on the home of a white
member of Parliament,'' state Radio South Africa said after the
explosion Sunday night at the house of B.L. ``Boy'' Geldenhuys in
Randfontein Park, west of Johannesburg.
   Police said right-wing extremists may have laid the blast.
   The explosion occurred next to a concrete pillar at the entrance
to the two-story house, causing damage estimated at $9,000-$14,000,
police said.
   Geldenhuys, who is senior director of information for the
governing National Party, was flying to Cape Town at the time. His
wife, Kallie, said one of the pillars at the front door was blown
away, the ceiling collapsed, the family room door was blown out of
its frame and windows were shattered.

   A small plane crashed and exploded as
it landed at a coastal airport today, killing all 16 people
believed on board.
   Among the passengers reported on the twin-engine Beachcraft 99
plane were five Swedish politicians, a parliament spokeswoman said.
   But the fire that followed the explosion was so severe,
authorities were unable to determine if the 14 passengers and two
crewmen listed on the Holmstrom Flyg flight from Stockholm were
actually on board, said police duty officer Sigurd Gustafsson. ``No
one survived the crash,'' Gustafsson said.
   The politicians included three members of Parliament, Anna-Greta
Wohlin, Anders Andersson and Hans Rosengren; a former legislator,
Klas Renfeldt; and the former Stockholm party boss of the governing
Social Democrats, John-Olle Persson, the Swedish national radio
reported.
   The five were on a parliamentary fact-finding mission on
domestic telecommunications and air mail links, according to the
Parliament spokeswoman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The plane hit the runway of Virkvarns Airport nose first, caught
fire, then exploded, witnesses told rescue workers.
   The cause of the crash was not immediately known. Gustafsson
said the weather was sunny and calm when the accident occurred at
the airport north of Oskarshamn, on the southeastern coast, 150
miles southwest of Stockholm.
   The propeller-driven aircraft belonged to the regional airline
Holmstrom Flyg, a family company that has seven small planes.

   A U.S. military official confirmed today that a
hydrogen bomb was lost in the Pacific Ocean near Okinawa when a jet
fell off an aircraft carrier in 1965. Many Japanese expressed
outrage at the disclosure.
   The report was the top story in most Japanese newspapers and was
featured on the television news. Japan, the only nation ever
attacked with nuclear weapons, remains very sensitive about nuclear
arms questions.
   The report was disclosed over the weekend in a report from
Washington in the current edition of Newsweek magazine.
   Asked about the report, a U.S. military spokesman in Tokyo said
a nuclear weapon was lost in the Pacific in 1965 when an A-4
Skyhawk plane fell from a U.S. carrier in international waters
about 80 miles from the closest point of the Okinawa island chain.
The spokesman demanded anonymity.
   The Newsweek article said the aircraft and bomb were lost in
waters with a depth of 16,200 feet.
   The Japanese government does not know the present location and
condition of the bomb, and there have been no discussions with the
United States about how to deal with it, said a Foreign Ministry
official who requested anonymity.
   He said his government had no plans to investigate the accident
or possible dangers posed by the bomb.
   The loss of the one-megaton bomb, which has a force of 1 million
tons of TNT, was kept secret at the time, Newsweek said, quoting a
report by the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington.
   The pilot was killed when the plane carrying the bomb
accidentally rolled off the aircraft carrier Ticonderoga, which was
on its way from Vietnam to the Japanese port of Yokosuka, said the
report.
   When the loss of the bomb was reported in a 1981 U.S. Department
of Defense listing of nuclear weapons accidents, there was no
indication that it occurred near inhabited islands, another Foreign
Ministry official said.
   ``The report said only that it happened 500 miles from the Asian
mainland,'' said the official, who also insisted on anonymity.
   In Okinawa prefecture, a string of islands stretching 570 miles
south of Japan's main islands, citizens expressed anger, Masaji
Shinzato, a reporter for the Okinawa Times, told The Associated
Press.
   ``Shock is running through Okinawa. This seems to represent how
Okinawa was used freely by the American military in those days,''
he said.
   There already was a great deal of bitterness over the continuing
presence of 35,000 U.S. troops, whose facilities occupy much of
Okinawa's territory, he said. At the time of the accident, Okinawa
was under U.S. control. It was returned to Japan in 1972, 27 years
after Japan's defeat in World War II.
   The report said the bomb was lost not far from one of Okinawa's
smaller islands, about 200 miles from heavily populated Okinawa
Island.
   Okinawan leaders of anti-war and anti-nuclear groups and
opponents of the U.S. military presence on the island immediately
issued denunciations of the way the accident apparently had been
handled, local press reports said.
   Japan's Socialist and Communist parties, both strongly
anti-nuclear, sharply criticized Japan's government and the United
States.
   ``The government must demand that the U.S. government take
responsibility for the accident,'' said Tsuruo Yamaguchi,
secretary-general of the Japan Socialist Party.
   Japan bans nuclear weapons. It says U.S. ships or planes cannot
bring nuclear arms into Japan without prior consulations with the
government, and there have been no such consultations. The United
States, meanwhile, refuses to confirm or deny the presence of
nuclear weapons in specific locations.

<HEAD>Oil Spill or Not, Alaska Senate Defeats Oil-Tax Hike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN S. AKRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alaska's oil industry proved its political
clout remains strong despite the Exxon Valdez spill when the state
Senate narrowly rejected an effort to raise oil taxes.
   The industry's credibility in the wake of the March 24 accident
was the center of debate late Sunday before the chamber voted down
the increase 11-9.
   A bill to revise an oil-tax break known as the Economic Limit
Factor, or ELF, took three years to get to the floor of the
Republican-led Senate. The Democrat-controlled House approved an
ELF bill twice, in 1987 and this year.
   Proponents of the bill said the tax break should not apply to
the two biggest oil fields in the nation, Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk
on Alaska's North Slope. Industry officials argued that changing
the tax formula ultimately would cost the state jobs and oil
revenue.
   The bill would have added $235 million to the state treasury
next year.
   Its last chance this year is a reconsideration vote, which was
expected to be one of the last items on the Senate agenda today.
Democratic Gov. Steve Cowper made passage of the bill a priority in
the 1989 session, which ends tonight.
   ``The oil companies won Sunday night,'' Cowper said. ``It's as
simple as that. Monday's final vote on this issue will prove one
thing: whether the oil industry runs this state or whether the
people of Alaska are in charge.''
   Hugh Motley, vice president of Arco Alaska Inc., said he was
pleased with the victory. ``It is a bad piece of legislation for
Alaskans,'' he said.
   The Exxon Valdez spill, which polluted Prince William Sound with
10.1 million gallons of North Slope crude, gave proponents of the
bill new ammunition in the Senate, which has long been a bastion of
oil industry support.
   Democratic Sen. Al Adams pleaded for passage of the bill, and he
cited an industry effort to swing votes against the bill with
promises of additional union jobs.
   ``Who has made these promises?'' Adams asked. ``Is it the same
industry that promised that a Prince William Sound oil spill would
never happen? Is it the same industry that promised that they would
not kill animals?''
   He urged his colleages to think of how the bill's defeat would
be seen by fellow Alaskans irate over the spill.
   ``They are looking to you tonight to stop giving this industry a
tax break, to stop doing them a favor and hold them accountable for
their actions,'' he said.
   Sen. Jan Faiks, a Republican and longtime industry supporter,
said the industry had ``a pretty incredible record'' of more than
8,800 tanker trips in and out of the Valdez harbor without a major
spill before March 24.
   ``We had a disastrous accident. Is that going to wipe out over
8,800 trips without any accidents and a 12-year record?'' she asked.
   Republican Sen. Dick Eliason said it would. ``Twelve years is
certainly not enough as far as I'm concerned. I was a believer at
one time _ until Good Friday,'' he said. He added, ``The politics
of Alaska has changed.''

   Reporters have had to play hide-and-seek with
the judge and stand up through jury selection in a child-murder
case.
   Cecil Steve Sutherland, 33, is charged with sexually molesting
and slashing the throat of a 10-year-old who had left her house to
look for her dog.
   Testimony begins this week in the trial, which was moved here
from Mount Vernon, 60 miles away, because of publicity.
   Despite the change of venue, Judge Lehman Krause imposed a gag
order on participants and did not reveal the location of the
proceedings to the press.
   Journalists said they traced subpoena requests to find where the
trial was being held. They said that Krause let them attend jury
selection only after a lawyer for the reporters complained but that
he refused to let them sit.
   ``It's outrageous,'' said David Bennett, director of the
Illinois Press Association. ``We think what he is doing is clearly
unconstitutional.''
   Krause denied violating the Constitution and said reporters were
not barred from jury selection; he said they never tried to enter
the chamber. The judge said reporters have not been able to sit
because there are not enough chairs.
   However, a reporter was told to stand Thursday even though a
chair was empty except for a clerk's purse, said The Sunday Courier
in Evansville, Ind.
   The judge said publicity has tainted potential jurors, even in
Olney. He said half of 120 potential jurors have been disqualified,
many because they had already decided Sutherland is guilty.

<HEAD>Government Puts Off Talks With Independent Student Group</HEAD>

   Government officials refused today to begin talks
with an independent group of university students formed after weeks
of unprecedented pro-democracy demonstrations, the students said.
   A group of journalists working for state-controlled media but
inspired by the protests for freedom planned to seek their own
talks with propaganda and publishing officials to push for an
easing of press restrictions.
   Pro-democracy activists say a dialogue with China's communist
leadership is a major goal of their movement, which seeks greater
freedom and clean government.
   The students had organized several mass demonstrations involving
tens of thousands of people and a citywide class boycott by
university students to press their demands, but such activity has
largely ended.
   Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang responded today by saying
students were acting with more reason.
   ``The situation has been prevented from becoming acute because
the party and government have all along adopted a very tolerant and
restrained attitude and because most students have acted with
increasing reason,'' the official Xinhua News Agency quoted him as
saying.
   Zhao repeated comments he made Thursday that Chinese authorities
are tackling the problems raised by students, but the Xinhua report
did not mention Zhao repeating his earlier call for dialogue with
students.
   Officials have refused to meet with the independent student
union that organized the three weeks of protests.
   A second organization, the Student Dialogue Representative
Group, was formed last week with members from more than two dozen
Beijing universities to renew the appeal for talks. They dropped
several earlier demands, including that the government
representative be at least a vice premier.
   Four group members met for nearly an hour with officials at the
government Receiving Department today. Shen Tong, one of the
student leaders, said after the meeting that ``we still have to
further talk things over.''
   Another student leader, Xiang Xiaoji, said the officials ``did
not rule out'' conducting a dialogue with the group, but he refused
to clarify the government's position.
   Government officials are not hesitating to talk with students of
their own choosing, however. The Communist Party paper People's
Daily said Agriculture Minister He Kang and five vice ministers of
the Ministry of Machine Buiding and Electronics met with two small
groups of university students Sunday.
   Topics included inadequate financing of education and official
corruption, the report said.
   Efforts by students to set up talks with the government come as
the pro-democracy movement seems to be losing focus. Leading
student activists seem unsure of what to do next to keep up the
momentum. There are no more marches planned and only Beijing
University is continuing a boycott called off by other schools
after two weeks.
   Student leaders at Beijing University, the nation's most
prestigious school, announced Sunday the strike would last at least
through Friday. But activists acknowledged that perhaps as many as
30 percent or more of the students were in class today.
   Wall posters continued to appear at Beijing University today,
including one from a group of journalists who oppose the tight
official control over the press. It announced they would deliver an
appeal Tuesday for talks with leading officials such as the
Communist Party Propaganda Department chief, Wang Renzhi.
   More than 100 reporters at The Youth News signed the petition,
which has several hundred supporters, one of the newspaper's
journalists claimed.
   Since the pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing began in
mid-April, ``the capital's media has been unable to completely,
fairly and objectively report because of all kinds of pressure,''
the appeal said, adding that the restricted coverage has crippled
the reputation of the Chinese press at home and abroad.

   The Bush administration censored ``one of our
government's foremost scientists'' by ordering him to change his
planned congressional testimony on global warming, Sen. Albert Gore
Jr. said today.
   Gore, D-Tenn., said at the outset of a hearing by a science
subcommittee he chairs that the administration sought to minimize
the seriousness of the problems found by Dr. James E. Hansen,
director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies.
   Gore said Sunday that the Office of Management and Budget
``censored'' the testimony on the so-called greenhouse effect.
   The senator added today, ``Scientists, like Dr. Hansen, tell us
that global temperatures could increase two to five degrees
centigrade in our lifetimes because of the billions and billions of
tons of carbon dioxide we pump into the air every year and because
emissions of other greenhouses gases ....''
   The senator said, ``There are a few environmentalists in this
administration, such as William Reilly at EPA (the Environmental
Protection Agency), who is first rate. But they are outnumbered by
the James Watt clones put in key posts throughout the
administration. The environmentalists are being overruled, and
worse, they're sometimes being muzzled.''
   As former President Reagan's interior secretary, Watt pursued
policies that were vehemently opposed by environmental groups.
   Gore said Hansen, ``one of our government's foremost
scientists,'' was censored ``not on questions of policy, but on his
scientific opinions concerning detailed, painstaking research.''
   The New York Times today quoted Hansen as saying OMB edited the
text of his testimony for today's hearing to soften the conclusions
and make the prospects of change in climate appear more uncertain.
   ``It distresses me that they put words in my mouth; they even
put it in the first person,'' Hansen told the Times, adding that he
had tried to ``negotiate'' with the budget office over the wording
but ``they refused to change.''
   ``I should be allowed to say what is my scientific position;
there is no rationale by which OMB should be censoring scientific
opinion,'' Hansen said. ``I can understand changing policy, but not
science.''
   The Times said Hansen's original testimony was that computer
projections of changes in climate caused by carbon dioxide and
other gases released into the atmosphere show substantial increases
in temperature, drought, severe storms and other stresses likely to
affect the Earth's biological systems.
   Hansen's original testimony would have supported the position
that, while there are still many uncertainties, enough is known now
about the general and even regional effects of the global warming
trend to start acting now to mitigate and prepare for those
effects, the paper said.
   Hansen was not reachable for comment Sunday night.
   White House spokesman B. Jay Cooper said he had no knowledge of
the matter.
   Officials ordered the scientist to change his testimony because
it would ``conflict with the ideologically based do-nothing
approach which they're most comfortable with,'' said Gore.
   Gore said he was told by sources in the Bush administration that
officials had ``censored the scientific opinions we have asked to
be presented.''
   ``I think they're scared of the truth. I think they're scared
that Hansen and the other scientists are right and that some
dramatic policy changes are going to be needed and they don't want
to face up to it because they prefer to do nothing.''
   Gore said he knew of no similar orders being given to other
scientists scheduled to testify. He said his committee would ask
OMB officials to explain why the testimony was changed.

   A car bomb this morning injured a former
Cabinet minister in the Socialist government as he was being driven
to work in Athens.
   Former Public Order Minister George Petsos, 42, a senior member
of the governing party, was rushed to a nearby hospital, where
doctors removed glass shards from his face and upper body. A
hospital spokesman, who requested anonymity, said Petsos was not
seriously injured.
   Police officials said the bomb, a remote-controlled device
hidden in a parked sedan, was nearly identical to one that killed
U.S. Navy Capt. William E. Nordeen in Athens in June.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for today's blast, but
police said they suspect November 17, an extreme Marxist terror
organization that said it planted the bomb that killed Nordeen.
   Two police officers in Petsos' car also were treated in the
hospital for slight injuries. Police identified them as driver
Yiannis Karachalios and bodyguard Christoforos Savakis.
   The explosion occurred a few yards from the former minister's
house in plush Philothei suburb.
   The force of the bomb destroyed the booby-trapped car and two
other vehicles parked on the narrow tree-lined street. It also blew
out a front door and shattered windows in nearby homes.
   Police who requested anonymity said Petsos was fortunate to have
survived. They said the explosion was triggered just after his car
passed the bomb.
   A smouldering engine block and an aluminum alloy wheel were all
that remained of the rigged car, pieces of which were found on the
roof of a house more than 100 yards away.
   November 17 has claimed 13 killings in as many years. Besides
Nordeen, the victims included three senior U.S. officials and
several Greek businessmen, publishers and police officers.
   Petsos was dropped from the Cabinet during a reshuffle in March
to rid the government of ministers accused of involvement in a
multimillion dollar financial scandal.

<HEAD>Khmer Rouge Rejects Cease-Fire In Cambodian War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TUAN SAI RIER, Cambodia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodia's largest guerrilla
group, the Khmer Rouge, today rejected a proposed cease-fire in the
decade-old jungle war.
   The Khmer Rouge appeared to reject all concessions made by the
guerrilla coalition leader, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, in talks last
week with Hun Sen, premier of the Vietnamese-installed government
in Cambodia.
   ``We cannot accept a cease-fire that keeps in place a puppet
regime,'' said Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan, referring to the
pro-Vietnamese government in Phnom Penh. ``Once there is an
international commission to supervise the Vietnamese pullout then
there will be a cease-fire, not before,'' he said.
   Vietnam has said it will withdraw its 50,000 to 70,000 soldiers
from Cambodia by Sept. 30. Vietnamese troops entered that country a
decade ago to oust the Khmer Rouge, under whose rule an estimated
one-fourth of Cambodia's 8 million people were executed or died of
hunger.
   Khieu Samphan and Sihanouk, president of the United
Nations-recognized resistance coalition government, spoke with
reporters at a Sihanouk army base about half a mile inside
Cambodia's Siam Reap province.
   Sihanouk joined the Khmer Rouge because of its military might,
estimated at 30,000 to 40,000, far more than the non-communist
Khmer People's National Liberation Front and forces led by Sihanouk.
   Thailand's prime minister, Chatichai Choonhavan, mediated talks
last week in Jakarta, Indonesia, between Sihanouk and Hun Sen. The
prime minister proposed they agree to a cease-fire before the
Vietnamese troops withdraw.
   Both Sihanouk and Hun Sen agreed to Chatichai's proposal.
   But Khieu Samphan said today a cease-fire could come only with
the simultaneous dismantling of the Hun Sen government. He said a
new provisional government ``should be formed outside the framework
of the two regimes,'' referring to the guerrilla coalition and Hun
Sen government. But Hun Sen has ruled out Khmer Rouge participation
in any new provisional government.

<HEAD>Report: Pan Am Bombing Ordered By Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran ordered the destruction of Pan
Am Flight 103 and paid a Palestinian terrorist more than $1 million
to carry out the bombing, a West German magazine said today.
   Munich-based Quick said the Boeing 747 was bombed to avenge the
shooting down of an Iranian civilian jet by the U.S. Navy in the
Persian Gulf.
   It said the Iranians paid Palestinian terrorist Ahmed Jibril
$1.3 million to carry out the attack.
   Pan Flight 103 blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21,
killing all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground. British
investigators determined the plane was downed by a bomb hidden in
radio-cassette recorder.
   Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt, changed planes in London and
was en route to New York when it exploded.
   Quick said the decision to retaliate by attacking the plane was
made in Tehran last summer, shortly after the Iran Air jetliner was
downed by the USS Vincennes on July 3. The Navy said it mistook the
passenger plane for an Iranian fighter jet. Iran said all 290
people aboard died.
   The magazine said the decision to bomb an American plane was
made in a ``narrow circle'' of close advisers to Iran's spiritual
leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   The Quick report is the latest of many assigning blame for the
disaster. Officially, authorities in West Germany, Britain and the
United States say they do not know who blew up the aircraft.
   Quick said its information was based on ``secret'' minutes of
the meeting in Tehran and said a Khomeini aide, Mehdi Karoubi,
offered money to the group that would carry out the attack.
   West German authorities are holding two suspected members of
Jibril's Syrian-supported group, the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command. West German officials have
insisted that they have no evidence to link the two men held in
Germany to the Pan Am bombing.

<HEAD>Snowstorms in May Surprise the East; South Assesses Tornado Damage</HEAD>

   A May storm dumped nearly a foot of snow on parts of the East
and left marathon runners in Pittsburgh battling rain, wind and
flurries. The South, meanwhile, dealt with the aftermath of storms
that killed 23 people.
   Snow fell in western New York today, breaking 80-year-old
records for this time of year. Frost and freeze advisories extended
over Michigan to South Carolina.
   The James River in Virginia caused flooding in Richmond, the
effects of a tornado-laced storm system that swept across the South
beginning Thursday night.
   In all, the thunderstorms and tornadoes were blamed for seven
deaths in Texas, five in Virginia, five in North Carolina, three in
Louisiana, two in South Carolina and one in Oklahoma. More than 100
people were injured.
   ``We survived the tornado of '89,'' said Ben Williamson, who
waited out the storm in the cellar of his 160-year-old house in
North Carolina's Davie County. ``I heard everyone talking about the
roaring of the freight train. Then I heard it. If you hear that
sound, you get right with your maker in a hurry. It'll put a fear
in a grown man.''
   In hardest-hit North Carolina, Tom Ditt of the Emergency
Management Office said 17 counties reported 166 homes and
businesses destroyed and 182 seriously damaged. The storms also
damaged or destroyed 79 farm buildings.
   Schools were closed today in Winston-Salem and Forsyth County
because some buildings had no power. Officials said it could be
several days before electricity is restored. About 30,000
households were without power Sunday.
   Low-temperature records were broken or tied today in at least 20
cities, following Sunday's records in more than 30 cities.
   Today's records included 36 at Augusta, Ga.; 30 at Bristol,
Tenn.; 48 at Jacksonville, Fla., and 42 at Tallahassee, Fla.
Asheville, N.C., had its lowest-ever May temperature, at 28 degrees.
   But behind the cold, warm air surged into the central part of
the nation. Manhattan, Kan., climbed from a low of 30 degrees
Sunday morning to 88 in the afternoon. The warm, moist air helped
thunderstorms form overnight in the lower Missouri Valley, and
parts of Kansas had half-inch hail early today.
   More than 11 inches of snow had fallen by early today in
Rochester, N.Y., the largest single-day snowfall ever for May and
three times the highest total ever recorded for the entire month.
Buffalo got more than 8 inches of snow.
   Roads on Sunday were ``wet and sloppy,'' said Shirley Kennedy, a
Monroe County, N.Y., sheriff's spokeswoman. The heavy, wet snow
knocked down power lines, cutting electricity to about 15,000 homes.
   In Pittsburgh, Margaret Groos overcame rain, wind, flurries as
she won her second consecutive Pittsburgh Marathon, by more than
four minutes.
   But the record cold, 38 degrees, took its toll as officials said
10 runners were taken to hospitals for treatment. About 150 of the
3,200 runners were treated at on-site medical tents, most for
hypothermia.
   In Ohio, a bus overturned and slid down an embankment in snow
and sleet near Sandusky on Saturday, injuring 16 people. In
Cincinnati, snow fell for the first time in May in nearly a century
as temperatures overnight dipped into the low 30s.
   In suburban Columbus, pro golfer Jack Nicklaus said he woke up
to snow outside his Dublin home Sunday, four days before the
opening of the 14th Memorial Tournament at his Muirfield Village
Golf Club.
   ``I looked at it and went right on back to bed,'' he said. ``I
said, `Oh, man. No reason to get up now.''
   Later, Nicklaus shook off the shock as the snow melted and got
in 18 holes.
   ``If it happens, it happens,'' he said of the snow. ``Nothing I
can do about it.''

   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, back from a
nine-day overseas trip, turned today to his last major task in
office: finding a successor who will help restore his party's
tainted image.
   Takeshita, who returned from Southeast Asia late Sunday, held a
series of meetings with government and governing party officials to
discuss the selection of a new prime minister.
   ``We will settle this matter as soon as we can. The procedures
are being decided in today's meetings,'' Kyodo News Service quoted
him as saying.
   Takeshita asked Shintaro Abe, secretary-general of the governing
Liberal Democratic Party, to coordinate the selection process, the
Japan Broadcasting Corp. reported. It said Abe would meet with
party elders on Tuesday in an attempt to form a consensus on a new
leader.
   Takeshita, 65, indicated in the Philippines on Sunday that he
hopes to be succeeded by former Foreign Minister Masayoshi Ito, 75.
But Ito has refused the post when approached by party officials,
citing his age and poor health.
   Takeshita announced on April 25 that he would resign after the
fiscal 1989 budget passes Parliament because of the Recruit bribery
scandal that has decimated his party's popularity and dominated
Japanese politics.
   Four days later, he went ahead with a scheduled visit to five
Southeast Asian nations, a move intended to show continuity in
Japanese foreign policy despite the impending leadership change.
   But opposition parties today refused to proceed with debate on
the budget in Parliament's upper house, renewing a demand that
former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone testify under oath about
his links to the scandal.
   The government has been operating on a 50-day provisional budget
since the fiscal year began April 1.
   Discussions about who will succeed Takeshita as head of the
governing party, who routinely becomes prime minister because of
the party's large majority in Parliament, continued to center
around Ito, who chairs the party's policy-making Executive Council.
   Ito is seen as one of the few senior members of the governing
party who is untainted by the scandal, in which the Recruit Co.
made massive donations to Takeshita and other leading politicians
and sold bargain-priced stock shares to about 160 politicians,
businessmen and others.
   With an election for half the seats in the upper house slated
for this summer, the Liberal Democrats hope they can find a leader
who can project a better image for the party, analysts say.
   In a new development today, Japan Broadcasting reported that
Katsuya Ikeda, former deputy secretary general of the opposition
Clean Government Party, received about $100,000 in donations from
Recruit in 1985-87.
   Ikeda, who has not appeared in public for several months, made
statements in Parliament on several occasions that were favorable
to Recruit. Prosecutors are said to have questioned him last week.
   So far, 14 bureaucrats and businessmen have been arrested on
bribery and other charges in the Recruit scandal, and prosecutors
reportedly are investigating several politicians. Three Cabinet
ministers also have resigned because of links to Recruit.

   The United States is waging an uphill fight to
prevent the Palestine Liberation Organization from being admitted
as a state member of the World Health Organization.
   The U.S. health secretary, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, met the WHO
director-general, Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, in Geneva today to stress
U.S. concern. Sullivan declined to comment on the possibility of a
last-minute compromise.
   The meeting came as the 166-member agency opened its annual
assembly _ a gathering which may be dominated by the PLO's bid to
have it upgraded from non-voting observer to state member.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III threatened last week to
strip the international health organization of U.S. funds if it
admits the PLO. Washington this year contributed $71 million to the
WHO, a quarter of the total budget for the agency which sponsors
public health programs throughout the developing world.
   U.S. officials were working feverishly to persuade other member
nations the PLO request should be withdrawn, deferred, or as a last
defense, voted down.
   The PLO mission to the United Nations in Geneva on Friday said
compromise proposals are ``sugar-coated bait'' and called on all
countries to oppose moves to delay a decision.
   Nakajima, who has warned a cutoff of U.S. funds would
``destroy'' the agency, made an unpublicized trip to Tunis,
Tunisia, on Saturday in an attempt to get PLO Leader Yasser Arafat
to change his mind and avert a showdown.
   ``I understand he got nowhere,'' a senior West European diplomat
said in Geneva today. ``Further developments now depend largely on
the moderates among the Third World nations.''
   Zaire's health minister, Dr. Ngandu-Kabeya Dibandala, opened the
meeting in Geneva by warning the agency ``must avoid questions
alien to health'' in its efforts to improve health throughout the
world. But Dibandala, president of last year's assembly, made no
direct reference to the controversy.
   China's health minister, Professor Chen Min-Zhang, was elected
to preside over the 1989 assembly. He told the 1,200 delegates that
they face ``important questions'' but that he is ``deeply
convinced'' these will be resolved.
   The New York Times reported that Nakajima _ who consulted with
U.S. officials in Washington last week _ is pushing a compromise
under which the WHO would offer more medical aid to Palestinians in
Israeli-occupied territories but defer consideration of the PLO
application until next year.
   This would keep the United States from cutting off aid to WHO.
   Arafat last year declared a Palestinian state on Israeli-held
land and about 100 of the 166 WHO members already have recognized
the ``State of Palestine'' or acknowledged its proclamation of
statehood.
   However, the Dec. 15 U.N. General Assembly resolution that
changed the Palestine Liberation Organization's nameplates to
``Palestine'' stressed this did not change its status as a
non-voting observer to the world body.
   In the WHO, only a simple majority is required for PLO
admission. The assembly is expected to deal with the issue by
Wednesday.

   Members of the PEN international
writers' association should avoid further criticisms of Iran's
death threats against British author Salman Rushdie, the group's
president said today.
   ``The best thing would be to let the matter die down,'' said
PEN's president, Francis King, said at a PEN conference in the
southern Netherlands.
   PEN _ or Poets, Playwrights, Editors, Essayists and Novelists _
has 10,000 members worldwide. Several local chapters have
vehemently criticized the death threats Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini made against Rushdie in February. Many Moslems consider
Rushdie's novel, ``The Satanic Verses,'' blasphemous.
   King said Rushdie's literary agent, Gillon Aitken, told the PEN
leadership the author thought letting the matter drop would best
serve his interests.
   On Wednesday, PEN's 53rd International Conference will vote on
two separate Rushdie resolutions. But both statements speak only in
defense of free speech and neither contains a condemnation of
Iran's role in the episode, according to PEN's international
secretary, Alexandre Blokh.
   The conference also is expected to admit a new Soviet chapter on
Wednesday in a move that would open the international writers'
group to artists from the Soviet Union for the first time in 65
years.

   ABC is pulling the shade on ``Moonlighting'' as
of May 14.
   The offbeat detective series, once a major hit for ABC, suffered
creative struggles and schedule overruns the last two seasons and
was moved last month to a Sunday time period, where its ratings
have been abysmal. In last week's Nielsen ratings, ``Moonlighting''
was the seventh lowest-rated show of the week.
   ``We feel the show has reached a creative conclusion and that
this is the appropriate time to end the series,'' ABC said in a
statement today.
   ``We are quite proud of the innovation which `Moonlighting'
brought to television during the past four years, and appreciative
of the program's tremendous contribution to ABC's program schedule
during that time.''
   ``Moonlighting'' debuted in the spring of 1985 as a mid-season
replacement. It rejuvenated Cybill Shepherd's career and made an
instant star of Bruce Willis.
   Audiences were wowed by the chemistry and sexual tension between
Shepherd's Maddie Hayes, a straight-laced former model whose
accountant ran off with her money, and Willis' David Addison, a
be-bopping, hang-loose private eye who ran a detective agency Hayes
didn't know she owned.
   The show broke tradition and television's ``fourth wall'' by
having the characters acknowledge behind-the-scenes realities such
as commercial breaks and scriptwriters.
   One episode paid homage to Shakespeare in a full-blown, costumed
send-up of ``The Taming of the Shrew.'' Another parodied film noir
with a black-and-white episode titled ``The Dream Sequence Always
Rings Twice.''
   Because of the complexity of the stories and the creative
control exerted by creator Glenn Gordon Caron, ``Moonlighting'' had
trouble staying on schedule, its season run often interrupted by
reruns. The problems were exacerbated two years ago when Shepherd
became pregnant.
   Audiences turned against a contrived storyline that had Hayes
pregnant and unsure whether Addison or another love interest (Mark
Harmon) was the father. A quickie marriage to an entirely new
character (Dennis Dugan) only made matters worse. Then the marriage
was annulled and Hayes suffered a miscarriage.
   Gordon had left the series for feature films, and new executive
producer Jay Daniel struggled to get the show back on track this
season, but to no avail. It had already lost its audience.
   ``We are extremely grateful to Glenn Caron, Jay Daniel, Cybill
Shepherd, Bruce Willis and the entire cast and crew for their
efforts,'' said ABC.

   A bomb blew an unmarked
military van off a road today, slightly injuring two soldiers,
police said. A civilian was shot in the head near the scene of the
bombing minutes later.
   It was not known immediately whether the two incidents near the
rural Northern Ireland town of Clogher were linked.
   Police said a bomb, possibly a land mine, went off under the van
outside Clogher, 45 miles west of Belfast.
   Twenty minutes later, a civilian was gunned down as he and a
second man pulled up on a motorcycle outside a farmhouse near the
scene of the bombing, police said. The civilian was hospitalized in
serious condition, they said, giving no indication who opened fire.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but soldiers are
a prime target of the Irish Republican Army in its campaign to rid
Northern Ireland of British rule and unite it with the Irish
Republic.
   On Saturday, nine soldiers were injured in two separate
explosions in County Armagh, police said.

   The heirs of 2,000 adults killed in the 1984
Bhopal gas disaster will begin receiving monthly compensation
checks from the government, officials said today.
   Accounts for the victims' descendants will be opened in the
government-owned State Bank of India, and $50 will be credited to
each one monthly beginning on Tuesday, a government statement said.
   More than 3,400 adults and children died and at least 20,000
were injured when on Dec. 2, 1984, poisonous gas leaked from a
pesticide plant operated by a subsidiary of the Union Carbide Corp.
   The Supreme Court ordered the monthly compensation while it
considers petitions contesting a $470 million settlement reached in
February between the government and the Danbury, Conn.-based
multinational company.
   Petitions challenged the government's right to act as the sole
representative of victims in the settlement negotiations. The
Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the issue and compensation
payments from the company have been delayed.
   The court-ordered monthly compensation will be deducted from the
final settlement, the statement said.

<HEAD>Speaker Rented Out Home While Given Free Lodging</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright collected more than
$25,000 by renting out his Texas home while he and his wife used
rent-free housing provided by the couple's business partner,
according to financial disclosure documents.
   Papers on file with the House show that from 1979 through most
of 1983, the Wrights rented out their Fort Worth duplex for an
annual total of between $5,000 and $15,000 in extra income.
   The extra money is over and above the $53,488 value of the free
housing provided by Fort Worth real estate developer George Mallick
which is the basis of some of the 69 charges of ethics violations
lodged against Wright.
   Wright, D-Texas, sold the residence in August 1983 for more than
$250,000, and continued to use a condominium provided by Mallick
into 1988, the records show.
   Members of Congress are required to report their finances only
in broad ranges, so it is impossible to determine the precise value
of the rental income from the disclosure documents.
   The embattled speaker continued to be pummeled today by news
reports of other suspect financial dealings:
   _The Wall Street Journal reported that Wright accepted a number
of free flights aboard the corporate planes of a financially
troubled nursing home chain in which he had a $100,000 interest.
   The newspaper, citing an unidentified former official of the
company, Jewell Enterprises, said the practice apparently violates
House rules against accepting gifts worth more than $100 from
individuals with a direct interest in legislation. Wright recently
reimbursed $8,000 to a former Texas savings and loan official four
years after he had used the official's plane for a campaign trip.
He termed the failure to pay earlier an ``oversight.''
   _A former Texas S&amp;L official and major Democratic fundraiser,
Thomas Gaubert, collected large political contributions from other
S&amp;L executives for a 1985 special House election in Texas in which
Wright was active.
   One of the officials, David Farmer, testified in federal court
in Dallas on Friday that he was told Wright would block legislation
viewed as unfavorable by the S&amp;Ls in return for $250,000 in
political contributions.
   _Wright in 1981 urged Reagan administration Cabinet members to
consider retaliating against Canada if it sought to restrict energy
exploration by U.S. companies, according to the Dallas Times Herald.
   At the time, Wright was House majority leader and owned stock in
American Quasar Petroleum, a Fort Worth company that was heavily
involved in Canadian oil and gas activities through its subsidiary,
Quasar Petroleum Ltd.
   The developments come as the House ethics committee is
considering whether to expand its case against Wright beyond the 69
original charges to include allegations stemming from his profits
from a 1988 gas well investment.
   Wright is expected to go before an ethics committee disciplinary
hearing late this month. At the proceeding, the panel's special
outside counsel, Chicago lawyer Richard J. Phelan, will present
evidence and Wright will have a chance to defend himself.
   The speaker's office said today that his legal defense team will
include Stephen D. Susman of Houston, expected to handle
questioning at the disciplinary hearing; Rep. Robert Torricelli,
D-N.J., who would be Wright's emissary to House Democrats; and
Robert Altman, a Washington attorney.
   Legal strategy will continue to be mapped by William C. Oldaker,
who has handled the case for Wright thus far. The speaker's backers
hope they will gain public stature and credibility by the
participation on the defense team of Clark Clifford, a former
defense secretary and longtime prominent Democrat.

   A tanker exploded as it unloaded jet fuel
at Iran's main naval base in the Persian Gulf, killing at least 40
people and destroying other small vessels, shipping sources said
today.
   Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit said the blast occurred
either April 29 or 30. It identified the ship as either the Minab 2
or Minab 3, both of which are 15,000-ton tankers owned by the
National Iranian Tanker Co.
   There was no indication why the reports were delayed for at
least nine days, said London-based Lloyds, which monitors shipping
traffic worldwide. The incident has not been mentioned by the
official Islamic Republic News Agency.
   A U.S. military source said the U.S. Navy had no information on
the incident. U.S. warships in the gulf frequently operate within
view of Bandar Abbas, a major military and civilian port in the
Strait of Hormuz.
   Gulf-based shipping sources, who also requested anonymity, said
there had been reports earlier of a fire at the Bandar Abbas port,
apparently touched off by a spark while fuel was being unloaded.
   ``Some people apparently were killed and the Iranians were
moving other ships out of the way,'' said one of the sources. ``It
was considered just an internal matter for the Iranians.''
   Iran on Sunday began five days of joint air-sea maneuvers in the
Strait of Hormuz and the gulf, according to the Iranian news
service.
   The maneuvers were at least the second in the area since Iraq
and Iran agreed Aug. 20 to a cease-fire ending their eight-year war.
   The U.S. sources said they were aware of the exercises but had
no details.

<HEAD>Big Character Posters Get the Message Out in Student Movement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   University students fighting for democracy and
clean government have taken a page from past Chinese mass movements
by heavily relying on ``dazibao'' _ big character posters _ to
state their views.
   The posters, several feet long, have gone up daily since April
15, when the death of the reform-minded former Communist Party
chief Hu Yaobang touched off student demonstrations for more
freedom.
   Because the news media is tightly controlled by the state, the
posters have emerged as a major means of expression for the
students.
   At first, the posters largely praised Hu, who was regarded as
sympathetic to calls for political reforms. ``Those who should not
die have died,'' said a poster at Beijing University, the nation's
most prestigious school.
   More recent posters have discussed the achievements of the young
student movement and debated what new steps students should take to
press their demands. After staging several pro-democracy marches
that involved tens of thousands of people and a class boycott at
universities throughout the city, student activists are divided on
what to do next.
   At Beijing University, the main outdoor bulletin board is thick
with posters pasted one on top of another in recent weeks, some
written by newly formed independent student unions and others by
individuals.
   Some are hastily scrawled on newspaper pages. Others are long
discourses written in a methodical hand on several pages of
notebook paper.
   Cartoons have appeared on the posters as have songs, including
``The Beijing University Pledge,'' which begins, in two-four time:
``Don't fear, don't fear, never be afraid.''
   Hundreds of students, workers and teachers read the new posters
daily. Some furiously copy the messages in notebooks, others read
them into tape recorders and still others take pictures.
   ``I'm doing this to maintain a historical record,'' said a
26-year-old management student from the central China city of Wuhan
who last week was snapping photographs of Beijing University
posters.
   ``In a few days, they might be torn down by students'' who
support the government, he added.
   Authorities at Beijing University and most other major schools
so far have tolerated the posters, which also have gone up on
dormitory walls and on outer walls surrounding the campuses.
   The Beijing College of Aeronautics, however, infuriated
activists earlier this month by hosing down the posters. A few new
ones have since appeared, including one written on a map of France
with bold black Chinese characters racing across the Pyrenees.
   Big-character posters seem to have lost the stigma attached to
them during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when they were a
principal source of the ultra-leftist upheaval's mass hysteria.
   During the decade of turmoil, posters of rival fanatical
factions were plastered everywhere, quoting from Mao Tse-tung's
``red book'' and heaping abuse on unpopular superiors and
government leaders in disfavor.
   Shoppers had difficulty finding the right store because some
city streets were blanketed with the posters.
   Mao forbade any tampering with the posters, no matter how
inflammatory, but they came down soon after he died in 1976.
   Deng Xiaoping, who soon emerged as China's supreme leader,
showed his distaste for the posters when in late 1979 he ordered
the removal of all political signs pasted on Beijing's Democracy
Wall.
   Shortly thereafter, China's Parliament removed from the
constitution the right to put up dazibao.
   The posters reappeared in late 1986 when students pressed
demands for greater freedom and democracy.
   But the official Chinese media denounced the signs, calling them
``dangerous cancers.'' That student movement quickly ended when Hu
was fired and three intellectuals accused of inciting the students
were purged from the Communist Party.
   The official media has yet to criticize the current campaign's
posters, keeping in line with the leadership's conciliatory public
stance toward the student movement.
   Newspapers have refrained from using the term ``big character
poster'' when describing the signs in an apparent effort not to
recall the dark days of the Cultural Revolution, when posters
provoked fear instead of thoughtful debate.

<HEAD>Officials Meet With Creditors; Debt Down To $2.2 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oral Roberts' ministry said the evangelist's
``life-or-death'' drive to raise $11 million by today is $2.2
million short of its goal.
   The figure was revealed this morning by Richard Roberts, son of
the evangelist, on his TV program.
   The younger Roberts gave no indication of what the ministry's
next move would be, but officials said last week they would meet
with creditors to get extensions on the ministry's debts if it
failed to raise the full amount.
   The elder Roberts said in March he had to raise $11 million by
Oral Roberts University's graduation Saturday or creditors would
start dismantling the university. On his Sunday program, he said
the deadline had been extended until today.
   Roberts has said that monthly contributions have declined from
$5 million to $2.7 million over the past two years. He blamed ``a
spirit of skepticism'' from scandals involving evangelists Jim
Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart.
   The ministry already has made some cost-cutting moves.
   Last week, Roberts announced the university is dropping out of
NCAA competition to save $500,000 to $1 million a year. The
4,000-student school has applied for admission to the National
Association of Intercollegiate Athletics.
   The ministry also said it is cutting back on its TV commitments.
   Roberts stirred a furor two years when he said he needed $8
million for his medical school by April 1, 1987, or God would end
his life.

<HEAD>Gov't Official Confirms Number Executed For 1956 Uprising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government official Monday said 247
people were executed for their roles in the 1956 anti-Soviet
uprising _ the first authoritative confirmation of the number of
Hungarians put to death.
   Unofficial sources had estimated the number at between 200 and
300.
   The independent daily newspaper Mai Nap quoted Gyula Borics,
state secretary in the Justice Ministry, as saying the number was
reached following an official review of government records.
   Borics said the figure covers deaths ordered between 1956 and
1961, and that it was believed to be accurate.
   He said the total included 13 executions for which records had
disappeared.
   Hungarians supporting democratic reforms revolted in 1956
against the Stalinist system. Soviet troops and tanks were sent in
to crush the uprising, whose leader Imre Nagy was imprisoned and
later executed.
   Janos Kadar became the new communist leader, surviving until May
1988 when he was replaced by Karoly Grosz. Kadar's role in ending
the revolt has never been spelled out, although there are
increasing demands for it to be clarified.
   The disclosure of the number executed after 1956 is seen as part
of the attempt by Communist Party reformers to tell the full truth
about what happened during and after the revolt.

<TEXT>
   The last princess of the royal dynasty
of Korea was buried Monday with musicians blowing conch shells and
honor guards in traditional red, blue and gold robes escorting the
coffin to the royal tombs.
   Prince Yi Pang-ja, a member of Japan's royal family who married
a Korean prince, died April 30 at age 88, nine days after the death
of Princess Tok-hye, her sister-in-law. The princesses were the
last two royal members of the Yi dynasty that ruled Korea for five
centuries until 1910.
   Hundreds of official mourners dressed in traditional white robes
and tall hats made of hemp followed the princess' only son in a
royal funeral procession from her home at Changdok Palace through
crowded downtown streets.
   Other marchers wore the red, blue and gold tunics of palace
guards and court officials of the Yi Dynasty. Musicians played a
funeral dirge on long trumpets, bells and conch shells as several
thousand people stood on curbs to watch the procession pass.
   ``Your majesty, your majesty,'' wailed a woman in the crowd who
said she worked at the palace.
   Officials said the ceremony would be Korea's last royal funeral
since none of the royal family's surviving descendants has a royal
title.
   Princess Pang-ja, whose Japanese name was Masako, was a cousin
of Japanese Empress Dowager Nagako, widow of Emperor Hirohito. She
married Prince Yi Un, a son of Korea's King Kojong, in Tokyo in
1920, 10 years after Japan annexed the Korean peninsula as its
colony. King Kojong was the last royal ruler of Korea.
   ``This is the passing of an era,'' said Peter Bartholomew, a
friend of the princess. ``There will never been another royal
funeral. A tradition and an era in history has died.''
   South Korean Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon said the princess
had bridged two cultures to ``become the loving grandmother of our
country. We'll never forget her.''
   Japan's Prince Mikasa, youngest brother of Hirohito, and his
wife, Princess Mikasa, attended the services as the representatives
of the Japanese Imperial household and followed the procession in a
motorcade.
   At the services in the palace grounds, Prince Mikasa bowed
toward the traditional white funeral altar, burned incense for a
happy afterlife, then bowed again to the princess' son, Yi Ku, who
was raised in Japan and lives there.
   The princess was buried, as she wished, beside her husband and
an infant son on a hillside in the royal burial grounds east of
Seoul, surrounded by the rice paddies and trees of her adopted land.
   ``I have two fatherlands: Korea and Japan. Japan has given me
body, while Korea has given me spirit,'' the princess once wrote, a
passage repeated at her funeral.
   She and her invalid husband came to Korea in 1963, and he died
in 1970. Princess Pang-ja devoted herself to philanthropic works,
founding a vocational training center for the handicapped and a
rehabilitation center for the mentally and physically disabled.

<TEXT>
   Two West German relief workers said
today they were freed from brief captivity last week to transmit
the demands of kidnappers holding a third West German hostage in
south Lebanon.
   It was the first time Heinrich Struebig and Petra Schnitzler met
reporters since their reported abduction Thursday night by five
gunmen outside south Lebanon's provincial capital, Sidon. They were
released the next morning.
   They said the kidnappers are holding Markus Quint, who works
with them for Asme-Humanitas relief agency and who was abducted
with them.
   But they refused to detail the kidnappers' demands, saying: ``We
don't want to endanger the life of Markus Quint.''
   Col. Wajih Abu Ali, PLO military police commander in the region,
said on Friday that Struebig and Schnitzler told him the kidnappers
have threatened to kill Quint unless confessed TWA hijacker
Mohammed Ali Hamadi receives a mild sentence after his trial in
West Germany.
   In Frankfurt, West Germany, today, the chief judge at the Hamadi
trial, Heiner Mueckenberger, said of the kidnappings: ``It should
be said that if anyone thinks that this can influence us, they are
wrong.''
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is charged with murder and air
piracy in the June 1985 TWA hijacking in which U.S. Navy diver
Robert Stethem was killed. Another 39 Americans were held hostage
for 17 days after TWA Flight 847 was seized on a flight from Athens
to Rome and diverted to Beirut.
   Prosecutors have demanded a life sentence for Hamadi, who will
hear the court's verdict and sentence May 17, the judge said today.
   Neither Struebig nor Schnitzler would say whether the
kidnappers' demands have been conveyed to the Bonn government.
   The two disappeared and reappeared under similar circumstances
last year, prompting a Bonn spokesman to term the latest incident
``strange.''
   Schnitzler said the two were ``shocked by a statement
insinuating that we've sort of stage-managed or engineered the
affair.''
   West German news reports said Quint, in his early 20s, was the
cook for the six-member Asme-Humanitas team that extends medical
care mainly to Palestinian refugees in Ein el-Hilweh and Mieh Mieh
camps.
   No group has claimed responsibility for kidnapping the three
West Germans.
   In addition to Quint, 15 foreigners are held hostage in Lebanon.
They are nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishman, an Italian and
a Belgian.
   The longest held is Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher met with
Nicaraguan leader Daniel Ortega for the first time today and
reportedly told him she was disappointed by his country's lack of
progress toward democracy.
   Mrs. Thatcher also made no promises to help Nicaragua improve
relations with the United States, a British source said on
condition of anonymity.
   Ortega is on a 10-nation West European tour to drum up support
for his battered economy and to help persuade the United States to
normalize relations with Nicaragua.
   ``This is the first time I've met the prime minister and that in
itself is a positive action, that the dialogue took place,'' Ortega
told reporters after his 75-minute meeting with Mrs. ``It was a
very frank conversation. We were both frank and direct.''
   After joking that they both wore green to the meeting, Ortega
said, ``On other points we might not have coincided so much, but we
can work toward a convergence.''
   The British source said Mrs. Thatcher voiced disappointment at
an absence of progress toward democracy, which would mean removing
East Bloc advisers from Nicaragua, and cutting the size of the
armed forces. According to U.S. officials, there are 8,000 Soviet
bloc and Cuban personnel in Nicaragua, including 3,500 military and
secret police.
   Ortega signed an accord with four Central Ameican nations in
which he promised electoral and other legal reforms to ensure fair
general elections, which will be held in February. But last week,
the government rejected an opposition demand to negotiate further
reforms.
   Mrs. Thatcher said there were ``doubts about Nicaragua's
commitment to democracy,'' the British source said.
   Ortega told reporters Mrs. Thatcher ``defines her own policy and
is going to be fair in monitoring Nicaraguan developments.''
   Turning to the United States, he said the prime minister's
status as a world leader ``allows her to be ... able to contribute
so that the problems which exist between the United States and
Nicaragua can be overcome.'' The British source said Mrs. Thatcher
``did not make any promises'' on that score.
   Ortega said she also did not promise any financial aid for
Nicaragua, but he added: ``we didn't have much hope for that.''
   Mrs. Thatcher reportedly told Ortega Nicaragua's economic
problems were largely his government's own fault. Ortega blames
them on his long war with U.S.-backed Contra rebels that has left
26,500 people dead and 23,500 wounded.
   Ortega and his delegation have visited France, Belgium, Spain,
Italy, Greece, Sweden and Norway. He leaves Britain on Tuesday for
West Germany and then Ireland.

<HEAD>Warhol Diary Tells of Valium Dependency</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pop artist Andy Warhol wrote in his diary two
months before he died that he was addicted to the tranquilizer
Valium.
   Warhol, 58, who died of a heart attack Feb. 22, 1987, after
gallbladder surgery at New York Hospital, wrote that he used Valium
before he went to the White House in 1982 and mentioned it again in
a Dec. 29, 1986, entry.
   ``I think all the vitamins I'm taking may be what's making me
have so much trouble sleeping. And I am addicted to Valium,'' he
wrote. Excerpts from the journal were published in the May 15 issue
of People magazine.
   In a Sept. 16, 1982, entry, Warhol wrote, ``I was nervous all
day because I knew I was going to the White House for the state
dinner for the Marcoses. Took Valiums. I can't stand going to
Washington, all those TV lights.''
   On other subjects, Warhol wrote:
   _That the Aug. 17, 1985, wedding of Madonna and Sean Penn was
the ``most exciting weekend of my life.''
   ``Somebody had tipped the reporters off about where the wedding
was and about 10 helicopters were hovering; it was like `Apocalypse
Now.' And I looked really close at Madonna and she is beautiful.
And she and Sean are just so in love.
   ``And someone said that Sean had shot at the helicopters the
night before. The only boring celebrity was Diane Keaton, really.''
   _His recollections of the April 26, 1986, wedding of Arnold
Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver: ``The crowd outside the church
screamed `Grace' (Jones) and `Andy!' There was the biggest mob I've
ever seen around a church.
   ``The cake was six or 10 feet high. ... (Sargent) Shriver gave a
speech. He was in tails. And he was talking about `losing a
daughter.' Well, I mean, she's 29 _ he's lucky to lose her.''
   Afterward, ``Arnold gave a speech and was saying wonderful love
things like that he'd make her happy. It was the first time I've
seen really announceable love, saying everything all out loud.''

<HEAD>Blood Test May Help Identify Suicide Risk in Children, Study Suggests</HEAD>

   A blood test that measures the amount of a
particular hormone may help in assessing a depressed child's risk
of suicide, a new study suggests.
   But researcher Cynthia Pfeffer stressed that the approach needs
further study and that results of her research provide ``just a
glimmer'' that the test may be useful.
   Pfeffer, an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at the
Cornell University Medical College, spoke in an interview before
presenting the study Monday at the annual meeting of the American
Psychiatric Association.
   Each year about 100 to 200 suicides occur among children age 10
to 14, a rate of about one per 100,000 children, writes Paul
Holinger, of the Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in
Chicago, in the newly published book ``Suicide Among Youth:
Perspectives On Risk And Prevention.''
   Thousands of other children in that age group attempt suicide
each year, said Herbert Hendin, executive director of the American
Suicide Foundation in New York.
   Pfeffer's research, done with colleagues at Cornell and at
Columbia University in New York, involved 51 child patients in
psychiatric hospital.
   The average age of the children was about 11. Within about six
months before admission to a hospital, three children had made
serious suicide attempts, 10 made mild attempts, 12 threatened
suicide and 14 had suicidal ideas. Ten others were not suicidal,
and the status of two could not be determined.
   The blood test focused on a hormone called cortisol. The hormone
is involved with the neuroendocrine system, which is part of the
hormonal system regulated by the brain, Pfeffer said. So cortisol
measurements may be able to reveal abnormalities in that system,
she said.
   Some previous studies have linked cortisol abnormalities to
depression, stress and suicide in adults and adolescents, but
little research on cortisol and suicide has been done in children.
   In Pfeffer's study, researchers measured cortisol levels in the
blood, and also performed a procedure called the dexamethasone
suppression test. Patients were given a substance called
dexamethasone to see if it made their bodies produce less cortisol.
   In most people, dexamethasone will lower their cortisol levels.
But others, including some depressed patients, do not show that
response.
   The children in the study were tested within two weeks of
admission to the hospital, and again seven weeks after admission.
   Researchers found that children whose cortisol levels were not
suppressed by the dexamethasone in the initial test tended to have
more serious suicidal thoughts at the seven-week point than the
others did. Seriousness of the thoughts was ranked by such factors
as whether the child had a plan for suicide and whether the plan
was worked out in detail.
   Researchers also found higher natural cortisol levels at the
seven-week point in children who showed suicidal behavior or
thoughts both at that time and upon hospital admission, than in
children who had shown such suicidal tendencies only in the first
test. So children with persistent suicidal tendencies averaged
higher cortisol levels, Pfeffer said.
   The study's results suggest the approach deserves further
research, but it is too soon to tell what the usefulness of
cortisol testing might be, Michael Stanley of the New York State
Psychiatric Institute said in an interview.
   Herbert Meltzer, psychiatry professor at the Case Western
Reserve School of Medicine in Cleveland, said children should be
followed for a longer period to see how well the experimental test
predicts suicidal behavior.
   He also noted that only three children in the study had made
serious suicide attempts before hospitalization.
   But because the study results were consistent with findings in
adults, the new work suggests that research about the biology of
suicide in adults also may apply to children, he said.
   Meltzer cautioned, however, that the new results are limited
because researchers evidently did not measure the amount of
dexamethasone in the blood when cortisol suppression was measured.
People differ significantly in how much dexamethasone stays in the
blood and that should be taken into account, he said.

<TEXT>
   An Air New Zealand jumbo jet carrying 350
people swerved to avoid a small plane less 500 feet away over the
Pacific, officials said today.
   A passenger and a crew member of the Boeing 747 suffered minor
arm injuries in the near-collision at 7,000 feet Sunday evening,
said an airline spokesman.
   ``It was close,'' said Gary Mucho, regional director for the
National Transportation Safety Board. He said the incident occurred
about 20 miles offshore.
   ``The Air New Zealand crew was given advisories by air traffic
controllers of conflicting traffic at their altitude and the Air
New Zealand crew took evasive action by making a left evasive turn.
The other aircraft came within less than 500 feet.''
   Air New Zealand Flight TE6 from Auckland to Los Angeles banked
sharply, said the airline spokesman, who declined to be identified.
The twin-engine plane, believed to be a Cessna, swerved to the
opposite side, he said.
   The small plane, which was not under control of air traffic
controllers because it was just outside the coverage boundaries,
wasn't identified, Mucho said.
   The jet landed undamaged at Los Angeles International Airport.
   An air traffic control specialist from Washington was en route
to Los Angeles as part of the investigation.
   Federal Aviation Administration and NTSB officials spoke with
the crew of the jetliner and were given its flight data and cockpit
voice recorders.

   Opposition leaders today claimed Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega's forces rigged the presidential election,
and witnesses said soldiers stole vote tallies at gunpoint from
precinct workers.
   The official tabulation board said today it had not received a
single vote to count. Witnesses said soldiers stole lists of
precinct results nationwide and that shots were fired into the air
in at least two instances when opposition members objected. There
were some reports of injuries by beating.
   Bishop Daniel Enrique Nunez said a Dutch priest who allegedly
was arrested and shot Sunday by Noriega's Defense Forces died
today. Unconfirmed reports said the priest, the Rev. Nichols Van
Cleef, was arrested after he urged a high voter turnout in the
northern town of Conception and denounced fraud.
   Both opposition and government-backed parties claimed victory in
Sunday's largely peaceful voting, a contest that was seen as a
referendum on Noriega's de facto rule and U.S. involvement in
Panamanian affairs. Opposition leaders called for a massive march
today to protest election fraud.
   Turnout was high and many people had to wait in line several
hours to cast ballots for president, two vice presidents and the
National Assembly.
   There can be no recount. When polls closed, poll workers burned
the ballots after official results were verified at each precinct
and put on tally sheets, a political tradition aimed at ending
recount demands.
   It was after the ballots were burned but before the tally sheets
were turned in to central election headquarters that the tally
sheets were stolen.
   Government and Defense Forces spokesmen did not immediately
return telephone requests for comment or a statements. A U.S.
Embassy spokeswoman said the embassy was getting many reports of
fraud but had no immediate comment.
   For more than a year, the United States has been trying to oust
Noriega, who was indicted on federal drug trafficking charges in
Florida. The United States imposed economic sanctions, supported
anti-government leaders and reportedly gave $10 million to the
opposition election campaign.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., part of a 13-member uninvited
delegation sent by President Bush, said Sunday: ``We've seen many
irregularities, but it is difficult to judge the extent of the
irregularities.''
   The opposition claimed that Noriega's 15,000-member Defense
Forces rigged the voting, with soldiers voting more than once and
some ballots cast in the name of dead voters.
   ``Despite all the irregularities, the opposition has
triumphed,'' opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara
told a news conference Sunday night. He claimed to have won by a
2-to-1 margin over Noriega's hand-picked candidate, Carlos Duque.
   Witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, said today that
final tallies of precinct votes were seized by soldiers in Panama
City, its suburb of San Migulito and the Atlantic port city of
Colon.
   At the Venezuela School in Panama City, witnesses said
government representatives offered to take the vote tallies to the
central counting place. When the opposition objected, the lights
went out and shooting began, and when the lights went back on the
ballots were gone, they said.
   Witnesses reported similar thefts elsewhere, but the extent of
the fraud was uncertain.
   In San Migulito, neighbors said soldiers entered the Orlando
Winter gymnasium, a ballot collection point, at about 3 a.m. and
began firing rifles and shotguns into the air. The witnesses said
people waiting for the tallies to come in from various precincts
fled over fences and into private homes.
   Vote tallies left behind showed the government losing badly,
witnesses said. Witnesses said people were beaten and at least one
arrested.
   ``They were in uniform. They were riot police, and they took
over the street. They knew the government had lost,'' said one
witness, Marcos Herrera.
   Elizabeth Escobar said a man ran into her house and left an
envelope containing a tally sheet for precinct 3655.
   ``He said, `Hang on to this, we'll be back to pick it up later.'
''
   Table 3655 went to opposition candidate Endara, 121-41 over
Duque. Other tallies the soldiers overlooked showed the government
losing badly, in some cases by a margin of 3-to-1.
   ``We are deeply perplexed and surprised that at this hour they
announce that they haven't got the tally sheets,'' said Fernando
Suarez Gonzalez, a Spanish member of a parliamentary observer group.
   ``Obviously if 120,000 votes were to disappear as a result of
violence it would be difficult to assume that this was an honest
election,'' he said. The San Miguelito district contained about
120,000 of Panama's 1.18 million registered voters.
   In Colon, an opposition spokesman said armed civilians stole
about 270 of 281 tally sheets, and that many party poll watchers
were beaten.
   In a statement read over National Radio this morning, Diomedes
Rosa, president of the National Tabulation Junta, said it had no
precinct reports from local vote collection points to tabulate as
of 8:50 a.m., almost 16 hours after voting ended.
   The government promised results by this evening and declared
today a holiday. The opposition called for an afternoon protest
march and threatened a general strike.
   Noriega, campaigning on behalf of his hand-picked candidate,
said a vote for the opposition would ensure suffocating U.S.
influence over Panamanian affairs. He also claimed that Washington
was preparing to renege on the 1977 treaty giving Panama sole
control of the Panama Canal in 1999.
   The Bush administration said last week that it expected Noriega
to rig the elections and that it was prepared to look for other
ways, including freezing Noriega's foreign assets, to oust the
military ruler.

   A top government scientist said the Office of
Management and Budget, over his strong objections, significantly
changed his conclusions on global warming in testimony prepared for
a Senate subcommittee today.
   Dr. James E. Hansen, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for
Space Studies, told the panel that OMB forced him to contradict his
findings that the so-called greenhouse effect will increase the
likelihood of drought.
   The White House confirmed changes were made, and it defended the
action.
   Hansen said that as a government scientist, he ``should be able
to say what my opinions are,'' but added he was unable to convince
OMB offiicals.
   ``They're scared of the truth,'' said Sen. Albert Gore Jr.,
D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate science subcommittee. ``It's a form
of scientific fraud by them.''
   ``If they attempt retribution they will have on their hands the
congressional equivalent of World War III'' Gore told Hansen.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the
practice routine, and said the changes were made by an OMB official
who was ``four of five levels down from the top.'' Still, he said
the ``administration stands behind it.''
   Fitzwater claimed that much disagreement exists among
scientists, within and outside the government, on the global
warming issue.
   Hansen's original testimony gave the appearance that ``there was
unanimity within the government on this matter. We simply wanted to
point out that there wasn't,'' the spokesman said. ``We thought we
were commenting on policy, not scientific evidence.''
   Opening the hearing today, Gore said: ``Scientists, like Dr.
Hansen, tell us that global temperatures could increase two to five
degrees centigrade in our lifetimes because of the billions and
billions of tons of carbon dioxide we pump into the air every year
and because emissions of other greenhouses gases ....''
   The senator said, ``There are a few environmentalists in this
administration, such as William Reilly at EPA (the Environmental
Protection Agency), who is first rate. But they are outnumbered by
the James Watt clones put in key posts throughout the
administration. The environmentalists are being overruled, and
worse, they're sometimes being muzzled.''
   As former President Reagan's interior secretary, Watt pursued
policies that were vehemently opposed by environmental groups.
   Gore said Hansen, ``one of our government's foremost
scientists,'' was censored ``not on questions of policy, but on his
scientific opinions concerning detailed, painstaking research.''
   The New York Times today quoted Hansen as saying OMB edited the
text of his testimony for today's hearing to soften the conclusions
and make the prospects of change in climate appear more uncertain.
   ``It distresses me that they put words in my mouth; they even
put it in the first person,'' Hansen told the Times, adding that he
had tried to ``negotiate'' with the budget office over the wording
but ``they refused to change.''
   ``I should be allowed to say what is my scientific position;
there is no rationale by which OMB should be censoring scientific
opinion,'' Hansen said. ``I can understand changing policy, but not
science.''
   The Times said Hansen's original testimony was that computer
projections of changes in climate caused by carbon dioxide and
other gases released into the atmosphere show substantial increases
in temperature, drought, severe storms and other stresses likely to
affect the Earth's biological systems.
   Hansen's original testimony would have supported the position
that, while there are still many uncertainties, enough is known now
about the general and even regional effects of the global warming
trend to start acting now to mitigate and prepare for those
effects, the paper said.
   Officials ordered the scientist to change his testimony because
it would ``conflict with the ideologically based do-nothing
approach which they're most comfortable with,'' said Gore.
   Gore said he was told by sources in the Bush administration that
officials had ``censored the scientific opinions we have asked to
be presented.''
   ``I think they're scared of the truth. I think they're scared
that Hansen and the other scientists are right and that some
dramatic policy changes are going to be needed and they don't want
to face up to it because they prefer to do nothing.''
   Gore said he knew of no similar orders being given to other
scientists scheduled to testify. He said his committee would ask
OMB officials to explain why the testimony was changed.

   A man who distributed a flier
pleading for information about his missing teen-age son was lured
to town by a phony tipster and then robbed at gunpoint, the man
said.
   Tom Lawson flew 1,725 miles from his home in Tulsa, Okla., to
southern Florida after a caller with a New York accent told him his
16-year-old son, Tom Jr., was at the ``Fort Lauderdale Boy's Club.''
   But instead of taking Lawson to his son Friday, the man robbed
him. The father returned home a day later without his son, or his
wallet, credit cards, watch and $150 cash.
   ``I feel stupid,'' Lawson, a 43-year-old marketing director,
said Saturday by telephone from his home in Tulsa. ``When someone
calls and says `I found your child,' your emotions take the lead
over reason.''
   Tom Lawson Jr. was living with his mother in Bethesda, Md., when
he ran away April 21. On April 30, Tom Jr. called her, saying he
was in New Orleans and needed cash. The teen promised to call again
in 30 minutes but never did.
   After learning from police in New Orleans that someone had seen
a youth fitting his son's description at a bus station in
Tallahassee, heading for Fort Lauderdale, Lawson Sr. sent a flier
and photos of his son to Fort Lauderdale police.
   The flier, urging people to call Lawson collect if anyone had
seen his son, was posted on a bulletin board n the lobby of the
police station.
   Within hours, a caller contacted Lawson, saying he knew where
his son was. When Lawson arrived at the agreed-on motel meeting
place Friday, he was greeted by a man who took his money, watch and
wallet and fled, he told police.
   ``I feel very sad I didn't bring my child home,'' he said.
``That hurts more than anything. I can replace my wallet, but not
my child.''

<HEAD>FAA Sends Inspectors to Miami</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration said
Monday it has sent inspectors to Eastern Airlines' main base in
Miami to see if there are any violations of maintenance
record-keeping rules such as those found in New York last week.
   The air carrier announced Thursday that it had temporarily
surrendered its repair station certificate at New York's John F.
Kennedy Airport after the FAA determined Eastern failed to follow
its system for recording and inspecting maintenance performed.
   The New York suspension was for actions that predated the start
of the strike by Eastern union workers on March 4, said Jack
Barker, public affairs officer at the FAA's Atlanta office.
   No maintenance work has been performed at Kennedy since the
start of the strike, he said.tificate will have the
effect of not allowing any future work until the deficiencies have
been Lifting the cer corrected.
   ``Since Miami is the home office of Eastern, we have a team in
Miami checking the main maintenance base to see if there is a
problem there,'' Barker said.
   ``Record-keeping problems are a big part of the (New York)
suspension, to show that aircraft are in fact airworthy,'' Barker
said. ``That, hopefully, is an isolated incident in New York. There
seems to be a communications problem within Eastern because there
was not proper recording of work perforild radar-evading bombers.
   ``A straightforward accounting of the B-2's cost, schedule,
capabilities and management would contribute to the program's
creditability and accountability,'' Aspin said in a two-page letter
to Cheney.
   The Armed Services chairman said a ``piecemeal approach to
declassification has only increased speculation about the status of
the program.''
   ``The rash of recent media reports on the program, its cost
increases, schedule slips and management deficiencies has done
little to reduce skepticism about the B-2, particularly in the
current budget environment,'' Aspin said.
   The Wisconsin Democrat did not provide reasons for the cost
increase.
   The Pentagon has envisioned a fleet of 132 planes. In the fiscal
1990 budget, Cheney proposed pushing back production of the B-2 a
year to 1993, with almost $4.1 billion cut from the fiscal 1990 and
1991 budgets.

   Two West German relief workers said
Monday they were freed from brief captivity last week to carry the
demands of kidnappers holding a third West German, but they would
not reveal the demands.
   In Bonn, West German officials said the demands had been relayed
by Lebanese authorities. They also refused to say what the
kidnappers wanted, but a spokeswoman for the relief agency said one
was that Mohammed Ali Hamadi be given no more than five years in
prison.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is being tried in Frankfurt
for murder and air piracy in the June 1985 TWA hijacking, during
which U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was killed and 39 Americans
were held hostage for 17 days.
   Prosecutors have requested a life sentence for the defendant,
who has admitted to the hijacking.
   Monday's meeting with journalists was the first for Heinrich
Struebig and Petra Schnitzler since the report that five gunmen
abducted them Thursday night on the outskirts of Sidon, provincial
capital of south Lebanon.
   They were freed the next morning and said the kidnappers were
holding Markus Quint, another worker for the private ASME-Humanitas
relief organization abducted with them.
   ``We were freed in the early morning of May 5 to transmit the
orders of the kidnappers to the responsible authorities in West
Germany,'' said a statement in English they distributed at a
meeting in the relief group's seaside compound at Aaqbieh.
   In the statement, they said: ``We can't and we don't want to
give any further information about this case now because we don't
want to endanger the life of Markus Quint.''
   Dagmar Nackunstz of ASME-Humanitas, said in Bonn: ``From what
I've heard, they want a mild sentence for Hamadi, not more than
five years. They also want a government mediator to travel to
Lebanon and brief them on the Hamadi case.''
   Col. Wajih Abu Ali, PLO military police commander in the region,
said Friday that Struebig and Ms. Schnitzler told him the
kidnappers threatened to kill Quint unless Hamadi got a mild
sentence.
   Identification of the captive as Quint dispelled confusion that
arose when officials of the Palestine Liberation Organization
initially identified him as Michael Markus.
   West German press reports said Quint, in his early 20s, was the
cook for a six-member ASME-Humanitas medical team that provides
medical care at Ein el-Hilweh and Mieh Mieh, Palestinian refugee
camps in Sidon.
   Neither Struebig nor Ms. Schnitzler would say whether the
demands had been conveyed to the West German government. They
disappeared and reappeared under similar circumstances last year
and an official spokesman in Bonn termed the latest incident
``strange.''
   Ms. Schnitzler said they were ``shocked by a statement
insinuating that we've sort of stage-managed or engineered the
affair.''
   ``We wondered how such a statement could be issued by the
Foreign Ministry, which has not tried to get directly to us for
information,'' she said. ``They have sought information from
various other parties but none directly from us.
   Asked whether the kidnappers had set a 10-day deadline for
compliance with their demands, Ms. Schnitzler, a 26-year-old nurse,
smiled and said: ``We do have a limited time to convey the demands
of the captors.''
   Abu Ali, the PLO commander, said Struebig and Ms. Schnitzler
also told him the kidnappers demanded freedom within 10 days for a
Lebanese jailed in Cyprus. He is believed to be Amin Zaarour,

   The State Department on Monday welcomed a
statement by Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser
Arafat criticizing a call by an Iranian leader for terrorist
actions against westerners.
   Deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said Arafat's statement Sunday
was consistent with the PLO's renunciation of terrorism and the
U.S. understanding that the PLO would denouce terrorism wherever it
occurs.
   Speaking at a news conference in Tunis, Arafat said, ``I reject
this call in its totality.''
   On Friday, Iranian Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani called
for five Britons, French or Americans to be killed for every
Palestinian killed in the Gaza Strip or West Bank by the Israeli
army.
   The State Department expressed outrage over Rafsanjani's
statement and it was condemned by the British and French
governments as well.

   An original copy of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's
famous dance hall poster ``Moulin Rouge'' brought a record $220,000
bid from a private collector, auction officials said Monday.
   The sale Sunday more than doubled the previous record for a
poster, $95,000 paid for another copy of the Moulin Rouge poster in
1987 in Paris, said Jack Rennert of Poster Auctions International,
which conducted the auction.
   ``It was an important poster because of Toulouse-Lautrec _ the
master of the medium of the poster _ and because it was his first
poster and launched his career. It is not only his finest and most
important, brilliant work, but it was his first attempt at
lithography,'' Rennert said.
   It was bought by a New York collector who asked not to be
identified.
   The mint-condition copy dates from 1891 and is said to be one of
only eight copies of the 4-by-6{ foot classic still in private
hands.
   Sunday's six-hour auction _ which included a collection from San
Francisco rock concerts featuring the Grateful Dead and the
Jefferson Airplane and a series of Mobil Oil advertisements for
``Masterpiece Theater'' _ brought in more than $1.3 million,
Rennert said.
   The San Francisco rock posters went for $4,000 for a group of
100.
   Toulouse-Lautrec's lithograph advertising ``concert, dancing
every night'' and ``masked ball on Wednesdays and Saturdays'' shows
the popular entertainer nicknamed La Goulue, or ``The Glutton,''
dancing the cancan.

<TEXT>
   Authorities seized a dissident leader
Monday and ordered the arrests of 90 other activists in a crackdown
on violent protests by leftist radicals.
   Police announced the arrest of Lee Chang-bok, a leader of the
nation's main dissident alliance, the United National Democratic
Movement. They said he was arrested on charges of violating
national security laws.
   Officials said Lee, 51, had supported communist North Korea and
organized strikes and violent demonstrations.
   Later, police authorized the nationwide roundup of 90 students,
workers and others involved in anti-government strikes and
protests. The number includes 25 student radicals, police said.
   The government began putting more pressure on the leftist
movement after six riot policemen were burned to death in a clash
with radical students in the southern city of Pusan last week.
   President Roh Tae-woo warned May 3 that he would invoke
emergency measures to halt the violent protests and strikes. He
charged that dissidents were attempting to stage a leftist
revolution under the control of North Korea.
   Also Monday, the Defense Ministry warned it would use ``strong
countermeasures'' to keep key defense industries running if they
are hit by strikes. Officials said troops could be used to keep
plants operating.
   Defense officials, who declined to be identified, said strikes
in defense industries were illegal and warned that anyone
organizing labor unrest would be ``severely punished.''
   The government says strikes cost the economy almost $4 billion
in lost production this year.
   Radical students and other radical anti-government groups have
little public support because of their violent tactics and extreme
political views. The radicals have been calling for the overthrow
of Roh, the creation of a leftist state ruled by workers and
farmers, and reunification with North Korea.
   Meanwhile, the National Assembly opens Tuesday for a 20-day
session that will include debate on whether to ban firebombs.
   Ruling and opposition lawmakers have agreed in principle to
enact a new law outlawing firebombs, a weapon commonly used in
anti-government demonstrations. But some opposition parties demand
that tear gas, a riot-control weapon used by police, be also
controlled as well.
   South Korean newspapers reported Monday that Roh, in response to
an opposition demand, may reshuffle his Cabinet and remove some
ministers for failing to adequately deal with the protests.

   A car bomb injured a former Cabinet
minister as he was being driven to work Monday, and authorities
blamed a leftist group they said may be trying to disrupt next
month's national elections.
   Former Public Order Minister George Petsos, a senior member of
the government Socialist party, was taken to a hospital in the
suburb of Philothei. Doctors operated to remove glass shards from
his face and body.
   Petsos, 42, was being driven to his office when his vehicle
passed an parked auto rigged with explosives, a police said.
   ``I got out from the right-hand door because the left one was
jammed and ran out to find a car to take me to a hospital,'' Petsos
told reporters from his hospital bed.
   A police driver and a bodyguard were slightly injured, police
said.
   ``We have no real leads in the case except that the (rigged) car
and its license plates were stolen,'' said a senior police
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but
police said they believe it was the work of the November 17
terrorist organization, an elusive group that has claimed 13
killings and many bombings since 1975.
   The government said the attack was aimed at disrupting the June
18 general elections.
   Police said the attack was nearly identical to one in June 1988
against U.S. Navy Capt. William E. Nordeen. Nordeen, the U.S.
defense attache in Greece, was killed by a bomb that was in a
parked car and exploded as he drove by in his armor-plated
automobile.
   The November 17 group is named after the day in 1973 when troops
and tanks crushed a student uprising against the 1967-74 military
dictatorship.
   The group aims to overthrow the government through armed
revolution and establish a Marxist regime.
   Petsos claimed the terrorist attack against him was the result
of the ``libel and false reports about me'' in Greek newspapers.
   ``(They) gave the terrorists the tools to justify my
eradication,'' he said.
   Greek newspapers have alleged that Petsos was involved in a
multimillion dollar financial scandal surrounding a Greek banker
who is in custody in the United States awaiting a hearing on a
Greek extradition request.
   The former chairman of the Bank of Crete, George Koskotas, fled
Greece in November after being indicted for fraud, forgery and
embezzlement in connection with $200 million missing from his bank.
   Petsos was dropped from the Cabinet during a March shakeup when
Premier Andreas Papandreou tried to rid his government of ministers
accused of involvement in the bank scandal.

<TEXT>
   Vermont's court administrator said Monday
he has acted to force the retirement of a Supreme Court justice who
is fighting a mandatory retirement provision in the state
constitution.
   Justice Louis Peck turned 70 in December and, according to the
Vermont Constitution, should have retired at the end of the year.
He did not, believing the state constitutional provision violates a
federal act that prohibits age discrimination.
   Thomas Lehner, administrator of the state court system, said
Monday that he had filed state forms ``terminating Justice Peck
from active service as of June 30.''
   ``I am doing this reluctantly to clarify the issue and establish
the clear precedent whether the Vermont Constitution or federal
statute prevails in this case,'' Lehner said.
   Peck said Monday he expects to file a complaint protesting the
move with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
   ``My hope is that the commission will act on my behalf and take
on this case,'' said Peck.
   As amended in 1974, the state Constitution says ``all justices
of the Supreme Court and judges of all subordinate courts shall be
retired at the end of the calendar year in which they attain 70
years of age.''
   But in late 1986 Congress amended the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act of 1967 to prohibit age discrimination, regardless
of age. Previously, the law did not apply to anyone older than 70.
   On Peck's side is an opinion from the state attorney general's
office saying the federal act prevails. But a recent federal
appeals court ruling involving a Massachusetts judge rejects that
reasoning.
   In filing the forms to retire Peck, Lehner wrote the state
commissioner of Finance and Management that ``I have delayed the
execution of this personnel action until today because the law in
this area is not clear.''
   However, the court administrator wrote: ``Because the
constitution mandates retirement, I have executed and forward to
you the enclosed personnel action form.''
   Peck is one of five justices on the state Supreme Court,
Vermont's highest court and only appeals court. He was appointed to
the court in 1981, and has three more years in his term and would
then have to seek legislative retention to continue on the court.
   He has said he might consider retiring before his term is up,
but only if the age issue is settled. ``I am not doing this for my
sake,'' he said. ``I'm doing this for the people who will come
after. I am determined to stay on until this is resolved.''
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in the Massachusetts
case last year that it could not find any evidence Congress meant
its law to usurp the state power to govern the tenure of judges.
   However, 1st Circuit rulings have no immediate effect in
Vermont, which is under jurisdiction of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals.
   Peck said he hopes a suit could be decided quickly. ``We will
probably seek an injunction stopping the retirement order from
going into effect,'' he said.
   The uncertainty over Peck's status has prompted a number of
lawyers to file motions challenging orders he has made so far this
year and seeking his disqualification from upcoming cases. The
state defender general's office alone has filed 30 such motions.
   The Supreme Court has tentatively scheduled two sessions next
week to hear all the motions involving Peck.

   Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang on
Monday praised students who have returned to class after three
weeks of pro-democracy protests, saying it showed ``increasing
reason.''
   Zhao also promised China will proceed with political reform,
which has lagged well behind decentralization of the economy.
   Although the ruling party has made some effort to separate its
work from that of the government and replace arbitrary
decision-making with laws, the government remains mainly the
executor of decisions made by a few top party leaders.
   Economic and political restructuring should ``support each
other,'' the official Xinhua News Agency quoted Zhao as telling a
Turkish delegation.
   The tens of thousands of students who have held marches, sit-ins
and other protests the past three weeks have demanded the pace of
political reform be stepped up and that basic freedoms such as the
right to speak and a free press be protected. They also called for
an end to worsening official corruption.
   ``Many of the demands voiced by the students represent problems
that the party and government are trying to solve,'' Zhao said,
without mentioning specifics.
   ``The situation (of the protests) has been prevented from
becoming acute because the party and government have all along
adopted a very tolerant and restrained attitude, and because most
students have acted with increasing reason,'' he said.
   Since a massive march Thursday on Tiananmen Square, many student
activists have said they will change tactics and concentrate on
spreading their message of democracy to the public rather than
marching.
   The only protest still continuing is a class boycott at
prestigious Beijing University. Activists said about 70 percent of
the school's more than 10,000 students remained out of class Monday.
   Most other students in Beijing have ended the boycott, which
began April 24.
   Beijing students also have continued to press their appeal for a
formal dialogue with the government on political reform and
democracy.
   The Student Dialogue Representative Group, established by about
30 universities to pursue a dialogue, met with officials at the
government reception department for nearly an hour Monday.
   A member of the group said later the officials ``gave us a phone
number and told us to call them by Thursday with our proposal for a
specific time and place.'' The student, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the group was not assuming this meant acceptance
but was preparing for talks anyway.
   Xinhua reported late Monday that the head of the reception
department, Zheng Youmei, told the students the government and
party would have ``broad contacts and dialogues with workers,
peasants, intellectuals, students, teachers and people with
non-party affiliations.'' However, he stopped short of saying
whether officials would meet with the Student Dialogue
Representative Group.
   Various government officials have met with selected students in
the past nine days but have refused to recognize any of the
independent associations the students have formed since beginning
their democracy movement April 15.
   Instead, the government has sought to divide the students by
field. For example, Agriculture Minister He Kang met Sunday with
about 20 students of two agricultural schools and answered their
questions about rural problems. He acknowledged not enough money
was being invested in agriculture but offered no solutions,
according to a report in Monday's official People's Daily.
   The graduate student said such talks did not represent all
Beijing students or cover the broad topics that the Student
Dialogue Representative Group hopes to discuss.
   The group also hopes for protracted talks, not a single meeting
limited to students asking questions.
   Journalists for the official media also are pursuing a dialogue
with the government. Several hundred planned to present a petition
Tuesday calling for talks on censorship and the dismissal of the
editor of china's most outspoken newspaper, the World Economic
Herald of Shanghai.
   The editor, Qin Benli, was fired two weeks ago after refusing to
alter an edition in keeping with government instructions.
   Qin's firing and tight censorship of reports on the student
movement prompted about 300 reporters to march with the students
Thursday in an unprecedented rebellion by members of China's
official media.

<HEAD>Scientists Urge Destruction of Most Nuclear Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of American and Soviet scientists,
saying technology is available to verify virtually all forms of
arms control agreements, urged on Monday that up to 90 percent of
existing U.S. and Soviet nuclear weapons and warheads eventually be
destroyed.
   At a briefing in a House hearing room, American physicists also
demonstrated a device which they said shows the feasibility of
detecting anti-satellite laser bursts, effectively monitoring a
future ban on laser beams of destructive intensity.
   The briefing was held under the auspices of Rep. George Brown,
D-Calif., who said that ``these scientists have shown that
essentially all the major verification problems can be solved,
given a little creativity and some solid cooperation.''
   The problem of assuring effective verification is an obstacle to
a new treaty making deep cuts in strategic, intercontinental
nuclear weapons. U.S.-Soviet negotiations on such a treaty are
expected to resume in Geneva later this year.
   Previous treaties, such as the pact banning medium-range,
nuclear-armed missiles in Europe and elsewhere, require the
destruction of only the delivery systems, not the actual warheads.
   Warheads were not affected for various reasons, including the
fear on both sides that an inspection of their destruction would
reveal the secrets of their design.
   Frank von Hipple, a physicist and professor of public policy at
Princeton University, representing the American Federation of
Scientists, outlined a system in which, for example, Soviet nuclear
warheads would be taken to a central facility to be dismantled in
privacy by Soviet technicians.
   American inspectors on the perimeter of the facility would make
sure that actual warheads entered the facility and that no warheads
were removed.
   The fissionable material would be removed under international
safeguards to civilian reactors, and the facility would be
inspected to make sure no warheads had been hidden.
   Von Hipple said other verification obstacles also could be
overcome.
   For example, a limit on the number of nuclear-armed warheads on
a single missile could be verified by sensors without the necessity
of actually looking under the weapon's protective shroud, he said.
   Von Hipple said that effective verification could lead to far
deeper reductions in nuclear arms than so far contemplated and to
shutting down nuclear reactors producing weapons-grade material.
   ``We are looking toward 90 percent reductions,'' he said, adding
that he believes the remaining nuclear deterrent on both sides
would be secure and stabilizing.
   A senior Soviet scientist, Roald Z. Sagdeev, chairman of the
Committee on International Security and Arms Control of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences, said the proposals outlined by Von Hipple
would provide ``a technical basis for the future.''
   ``It is conceptually feasible to create the technology for
verification which would at the same time provide protection for
the secrets of military design,'' he said.
   A team of American scientists, who had set up a small laser in
the hearing room, demonstrated how the scattered light produced by
the laser beam could be detected by a monitoring device and fed
into a computer to measure its intensity.
   They suggested that equipment could be developed that would fit
into a van to be parked in the vicinity of an actual or suspected
laser generating facility.
   They said laser rays could be detected from a site up to a
kilometer away from such a site. The distance would be sufficient,
they said, not to intrude on the actual site itself.
   Sagdeev was asked if the Soviet Union would permit such
intrusive on-site inspection.
   ``I would suspect it's negotiable,'' he replied.
   Brown said if it can be proved that bursts from a ground-based
laser can be monitored and measured, that could serve as the basis
for a treaty blocking the development of such laser-powered
anti-satellite weapons.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita huddled with
governing party leaders Monday to resume the search for a
scandal-free successor and a way to revive the party's plunging
popularity.
   By all accounts, most party members already have agreed that
former Foreign Minister Masayoshi Ito should replace Takeshita. But
Ito has resisted the overtures.
   Takeshita, who returned Sunday from a nine-day trip to Southeast
Asia, indicated he hopes to be succeeded by Ito, who chairs the
governing Liberal Democratic Party's policy-making Executive
Council.
   But Ito on Monday again refused the post when approached by
party officials, citing his age and poor health.
   Ito, 75, suffers from diabetes and a heart condition and has
been told by his doctor not to work more than three hours a day,
government and party sources said.
   ``I am not inclined to accept the offer,'' Ito told a fellow
Liberal Democrat, according to a source close to the meeting.
   Ito is seen as one of the few senior Liberal Democratic Party
members not touched by the Recruit bribery scandal, which has
severely eroded public support for the party that has dominated
Japanese politics for more than three decades.
   With elections for half of Parliament's upper house due this
summer, party leaders hope that a leader with a clean image will
help it regain lost popularity.
   In a poll reported Monday by the newspaper Asahi Shimbun, only
about 25 percent of those responding said they would vote for
Liberal Democratic candidates in the upper house election, down
from about 45 percent in the previous poll, conducted in May 1986.
   In talks Monday, Takeshita asked Shintaro Abe, the governing
party's secretary-general, to meet with party elders on Tuesday to
seek a consensus on Ito's selection, and then meet with Ito on
Wednesday, news reports said.
   The head of the ruling party routinely becomes Japan's prime
minister because of the Liberal Democrats' large majority in
Parliament.
   In the scandal, the Recruit Co. made large donations to
Takeshita and other leading politicians, chiefly from the ruling
party, and sold bargain-priced stock shares to about 160
politicians, businessmen and others.
   In a new development Monday, the Japan Broadcasting Corp.
reported that Katsuya Ikeda, former deputy-secretary general of the
opposition Clean Government Party, received about $100,000 in
donations from Recruit in 1985-87.
   Ikeda made statements in Parliament on several occasions that
were favorable to Recruit. Prosecutors are said to have questioned
him last week.
   Fourteen bureaucrats and businessmen have been arrested so far
in the scandal, which also has led to the resignation of three
Cabinet members.
   Takeshita announced April 25 that he would resign after the
fiscal 1989 budget passes Parliament to take responsibility for the
scandal's effects.
   But on Monday, the Liberal Democrats and opposition parties
failed to agree to begin budget debate in the upper house. The
opposition renewed a demand that former Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone testify under oath about his links to the scandal.

<TEXT>
   Greek and U.S. negotiators on Monday began
a 17th round of talks on U.S. military bases in Greece, the last
set of discussions before the June 18 national elections.
   The previous talks ended April 14 with ``no notable progress
made,'' a government spokesman said.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou reiterated Saturday during a
pre-election speech that a national referendum would determine the
future of the bases if an agreement was reached by the two
governments.
   The negotiations on a new Defence and Economic Cooperation
Agreement have stumbled on Greece's insistence that the United
States provide assurances that it will help solve Greece's
differences with its neigbor and NATO ally Turkey.
   Greece and Turkey have longstanding disputes over seabed mineral
rights, military control of the Aegean sea and the war-divided
Mediterranean island of Cyprus.
   The five-year base agreement expired Dec. 20. Under the accord,
signed in 1983, the United States has 17 months to pack up and
leave if a new agreement is not reached.
   The negotiations, which began in November 1987, will be
temporarily suspended at the end of this week for the June 18
national elections, spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos said.

<HEAD>Relocated Workers, Who Came to Texas from Big Apple, Now Face Layoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>IRVING, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of New Yorkers who came to Texas
in 1982 when their international oil company fled Manhattan for
spacious quarters in an exlusive development feel stranded now that
they're getting layoff notices.
   Many say they can't afford to return to the Big Apple and fear
they won't be able to find a comparable job if they remain in this
economically depressed region.
   Caltex Petroleum Corp. moved more than 600 employees when it
relocated in 1982 from New York to ``Las Colinas,'' a business
development in the Dallas suburb of Irving. Workers jumped at the
chance to live in the Dallas-Fort Worth area on New York salaries,
many buying their first homes and first cars.
   But corporate staff will fall below 200 next month when the
company completes restructuring begun last year. Caltex officials
say the belt-tightening was necessary because of the continuing
slump in the petroleum industry.
   Some of those being let go have more than 25 years of service.
   The relocation ``was a good move for all of us,'' said Carole
Morizio, who has been with Caltex for 30 years. ``But now, in this
economy, there is no way we're going to match our salaries. And we
can't afford to move.''
   Mrs. Morizio told The Dallas Morning News the home she and her
husband sold on New York's Long Island in 1982 is now ``triple what
I sold it for.''
   Anita Lauria, a 17-year company veteran, said the Dallas-area
job market ``offers me entry-level positions that would result in
me losing my house.''
   Caltex, a 50-50 joint venture between Chevron Corp. and Texaco
Inc. dating to 1936, operates refining and marketing operations in
55 nations in the Middle East, Far East, Australia and Africa.
   It historically has had a stable work force characterized by
longevity of service, but revenues in the past three years have
been less than half the level of 1984.
   ``This wasn't an easy decision,'' said Bill Dunning, a Caltex
vice president. ``We realize we're affecting people's lives, but we
felt it was absolutely necessary for the long-term survival of our
company.''

<HEAD>Federal Panel Cites Danger in School Bus Loading Zones</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal panel rejected the idea of requiring
seat belts in most school buses Monday and said safety officials
ought to concentrate on bus loading zones where children are in
much greater danger.
   Nearly 40 children are killed each year while trying to get on
or off school buses, compared to about 10 deaths among children
riding the buses, said a report by a committee of the National
Research Council.
   ``While most of the public controversy about school bus safety
has revolved around seat belts and other measures to protect
students en route to school, this emphasis is really misplaced,''
said Charley Wootan, chairman of the panel of safety and
transportation experts.
   In an 18-month study ordered by Congress and paid for by the
Transportation Department, the group said it would cost $40 million
a year to install and maintain seat belts on the 300,000 large
buses that transport most children. Only small van-like buses that
make up 20 percent of the fleet are now required to have belts.
   The panel concluded that if half the students on all buses used
the belts, perhaps one life a year would be saved and several dozen
injuries avoided _ statistics it termed ``not sufficient to justify
a federal standard mandating installation.''
   The study did say the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration should require that seat backs on new buses be at
least 24 inches high, a four-inch increase. The change would save
two to three lives and avert about 95 injuries a year at a cost of
$6 million annually, Wootan said.
   In addition, the panel said all states should immediately ban
standing in the aisles on school buses. Standing is specifically
permitted by law in 14 states: Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Missouri, Mississippi, New York, Ohio and Wyoming.
   Districts also were urged to phase out as quickly as possible
buses built before 1977, which lack protected fuel tanks, extra
seat padding and other safety requirements instituted that year.
   The panel studied school bus safety records for the period
1982-1986 and found that two-thirds of loading-zone fatalities
occur when children are struck by a school bus, usually their own.
Five- and six-year-olds are the most frequent victims.
   The group recommended standards for bus driver training, better
education of children about safety in the loading zone, and
installation of stop-signal arms on all new school buses with
consideration to putting them on older models as well. The arms are
stop signs with flashing red lights that extend from the left side
of the bus when it stops; they are required in 28 states.
   Wootan said districts should also consider the use of
loudspeakers, crossing-control arms, improved cross-view mirrors,
and electronic and mechanical sensors that could reduce the number
of children struck by their own buses.
   While there is no crisis in school bus safety, Wootan said, the
steps recommended by his panel ``should be able to produce
important reductions in deaths and injuries without burdening
already strained school budgets with high financial costs.''
   The recommendation on phasing out buses built before 1977 is
similar to the one made by the National Transportation Safety Board
five weeks ago in connection to the head-on collision of a pickup
truck and an older school bus a year ago in Kentucky.
   The crash was especially severe because the bus' unprotected
fuel tank burst into flames that spread fire and smoke through the
bus. Three adults and 24 children were killed.
   Asked why his panel did not recommend an immediate halt in the
operation of older buses, Wootan replied, ``It's an economic issue.
... We recognize that it is not going to be possible in many of the
poorer school districts that do not have the money to replace these
buses immediately.''
   More than one-fifth of the nation's school bus fleet dates from
before 1977, and the life expectancy of a bus ranges from 15 to 30
years, panel members said.
   While the 13-member panel agreed the federal government should
not require seat belts in buses, it split on whether to encourage
states and districts to install them anyway if they have the money.
   Wootan said a strong minority argued that buses should have
belts to be consistent with the other vehicles in which children
ride ```so you could maintain that seat belt habit.'' But he said a
narrow majority favored no encouragement, on the grounds that the
money could be more effectively spent to improve safety in other
ways.
   There are 390,000 school buses in the country and they travel 4
billion miles a year.

   American soprano Kallen Esperian succeeded
where Italy's Katia Ricciarelli failed, winning over the demanding
public at La Scala Opera House.
   Ms. Esperian, 28, of Chicago, received rousing applause and
shouts of ``Brava!'' for her role in Giuseppe Verdi`s ``Luisa
Miller'' on Sunday night.
   ``Sensational success for Esperian, the new Luisa Miller,'' the
Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera said Monday, reporting that she
received nine curtain calls.
   ``She conquered the audience with the quality of her voice and
her dramatic charge,'' Corriere della Sera added.
   Ms. Esperian, a pupil of Italian opera star Luciano Pavarotti
and a winner of the Philadelphia opera contest in 1985, said ``it
was an unbelievable experience. I was very tense for a debut in
extremely difficult conditions. Now I am overjoyed.''
   Ms. Ricciarelli, the wife of Italian TV entertainer Pippo Baudo,
irately withdrew from the opera and announced ``I'll never sing at
La Scala again'' after being repeatedly booed and whistled in two
performances last week. She was scheduled to sing three more nights
at La Scala through May 31.
   Her appearance was also marred by clashes between Baudo and
people who had been critical of his wife's performance. Baudo said
in a radio interview last week that he had kicked one man who had
insulted his wife.

<HEAD>Pravda: Stalin Ignored Warnings of Nazi Invasion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dictator Josef Stalin ignored warnings from Soviet
spies that Nazi Germany was planning to invade and failed to
prepare his country for a war that cost 20 million Soviet lives,
Pravda told its readers on Monday.
   The full-page article in the Communist Party newspaper came on
the eve of the 44th anniversary of the Soviet victory in World War
II. It marked a sharp break from the traditionally patriotic and
positive reminiscences of Soviet heroism.
   The article also contrasted with a festive mood in the capital,
which was festooned with red banners for Tuesday's holiday. On Red
Square, a large banner stated simply, ``1941-1945,'' the years of
the war.
   Western historians have written much about how Stalin ignored
intelligence reports about Hitler's invasion plans, but little has
come out in the Soviet Union. The dictator typically had been
portrayed as a brilliant wartime leader who rallied the nation
against Nazi invaders.
   But under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost,
or openness, historians and others have condemned Stalin's
repression of his own people and recently have begun to re-examine
his wartime role.
   Last summer, Pravda published a chapter of a new book about
Stalin that denounced him for signing a friendship treaty with Nazi
Germany, purging the Red Army when the nation was on the brink of
war, and ignoring warnings that war was imminent.
   Monday's Pravda further rewrote an embarrassing page in Soviet
history and gave Soviets a fresh, bone-chilling look at what Soviet
spies learned about Nazi war preparations.
   Pravda said the article's author, history professor A. Baidakov,
gleaned the accounts from classified state security archives. He
said the state security agencies infiltrated the German secret
police, aviation ministry and coding service.
   Baidakov wrote that security officials forwarded concrete
information to Soviet political leaders about Hitler's invasion
plans as early as November 1940. German forces invaded June 21,
1941.
   But, the historian said:
   ``The leadership of the U.S.S.R. people's commissariats
(ministries) of state security and defense did not, in my view, do
everything to convince Stalin and the country's other leaders of
the inevitability of an imminent confrontation with the Germans.''
   Then, he added, ``But the main blame for miscalculating the time
of the start of the war, for the country not being turned into an
armed camp in time, for not being brought into a state of full
military preparedness, lies with the U.S.S.R. political leadership
of that period.''
   Pravda's editors added their criticism, saying in an
accompanying note that the information ``was supervaluable, however
the political situation devalued it.''
   Baidakov revealed several intelligence reports that he said were
sent to Stalin and his foreign minister, Vyacheslav M. Molotov.
   In April 1941, he wrote, Soviet spies learned that Hitler told a
Yugoslav prince that an invasion of the Soviet was planned for
June. Later that month, German troops began massing on the
Romanian-Soviet border later that month.
   In early June, Soviet agents intercepted a Romanian police
telegram directing that ditches be dug by June 15 in
German-populated areas to protect against air bombardment.
   Baidakov also wrote that Stalin was told a source close to
Hermann Goering, a key Hitler aide who founded the Gestapo and
headed the Luftwaffe, had ordered maps of targets in the Soviet
Union.
   Also, Soviet agents in Berlin reported June 12 that aviation
officials had been told a final decision to attack was taken and
that ``therefore an unexpected strike should be considered
possible.''
   Stalin also was told that German reconnaisance planes and agents
had repeatedly violated the Soviet border, Baidakov wrote.
   Then, on June 16, this urgent message was delivered to Stalin
and Molotov:
   ``All military operations of Germany on preparation of a
military aggression against the U.S.S.R. have been completely
stopped, and a blow can be expected at any time.''
   The next day, Baidakov wrote, Stalin asked intelligence
officials whether the sources who wrote the message were reliable.
Stalin was quoted as saying, ``There isn't a German besides Wilhelm
Pieck, who can be trusted. Is that clear?'' Pieck was a German
Communist leader.
   Before the information could be rechecked, the Germans invaded.

<HEAD>Mauritania Blames Senegal for Violence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NOUAKCHOTT, Mauritania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Maouya Sidi-Ahmed Ould
Taya blamed Senegal for violence in which more than 250 nationals
of the two West African countries have been killed in each other's
territory.
   In a speech broadcast Sunday night, Taya told Mauritanians ``any
attempt at disturbing public order'' in this country would be
considered ``high treason and treated as such.''
   He apparently referred to rumors in the capital about possible
trouble between white and black Mauritanians stemming from the
recent violence.
   Two-thirds of Mauritania's estimated 1.7 million people are
whites of Arab-Berber descent known as Moors. The other third,
generally living in the southern part of the country, are black
like the Senegalese.
   Violence began after shooting April 9 in the border village of
Diawara, Senegal, in which two Senegalese were killed, some say by
Mauritanian border guards and others in a fight between local
tribesmen.
   Senegalese began attacking Mauritanians in their country and
Mauritanians did the same.
   No official casualty toll has been issued by either country, but
unofficial reports put the number of dead at 200 in Mauritania and
60 in Senegal.
   Taya said Senegalese news media inflamed the situation by
distorting events after the Diawara shooting. He also mentioned
``the remarkable passivity'' of Senegalese authorities and police.
   His accusation that distorted accounts ``instigated
confrontation among nationals,'' apparently responded to a
televised speech a week earlier by President Abdou Diouf of Senegal.
   Diouf cited ``inhuman and degrading treatment'' of Senegalese in
Mauritania and accused the government in Nouakchott of being behind
the violence.
   ``The government statement and the statement of the Senegalese
president gave the impression of an instigation to carry out more
of these acts,'' Taya said.
   An airlift was established between Mauritania and Senegal to
repatriate their nationals. Among countries supplying aircraft were
France, Algeria, Morocco and Spain.
   Mauritanian officials said 50,000 Mauritanians were repatriated,
30,000 by air and 20,000 across the Senegal River border. About
30,000 Senegalese residents of Mauritania were sent home.
   Taya said Sunday night the border shooting was not the cause of
the strife, but a pretext. He demanded compensation for
Mauritanians whose shops were looted in Senegal and the return of
money he said Senegalese authorities confiscated before expelling
them.
   Until the violence, Mauritanians controlled about 80 percent of
the small retail business in Senegal. In Mauritania, Senegalese did
most of the work in the fast-growing fishing industry and served as
drivers and domestic employees.
   Many black Mauretanians in Nouakchott and other northern areas
fear a resurgence of racial friction with the Moors and have begun
moving south toward the Senegal River, where blacks are the
majority.
   Officials deny racism still exists in Mauritania, but it has led
to bloody confrontations in the past between blacks and white
Moors, who have controlled the government since independence from
France in 1960.
   Reports from Senegal said Mauritania used the air shuttle to get
rid of some of its own black citizens, including policemen who
turned up in Dakar with their identity cards and in uniform.
   Mustapha Ould Abedarrahman, Mauritania's information minister,
said no Mauritanians had been sent to Senegal, but he did not deny
some people may have had Mauritanian papers.
   ``In the formation of our young state, a certain number of
papers were made fraudulently,'' the minister said.
   No immediate official reaction to Taya's speech was reported in
Dakar, but the Senegalese press showed no reticence.
   A commentator for Agence de Presse Senegalaise, the official
news agency, said Taya, ``after a long silence since the beginning
of these events, has just made an unfortunate and deplorable
response. Facile denunciation, gratuitous affirmations and
argumentation without proof have always been the arm of those who
are in a weak position in disputes with others.''

   ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,'' a collection of
songs from old musicals, and the comedy ``The Heidi Chronicles''
received Tony nominations as the best of Broadway 1988-89.
   ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' earned 10 nominations, including
best musical, actor and actress in a musical and best director.
``Black and Blue,'' the tap and blues revue, also took 10
nominations, including best musical, actress, director and
choreography. ``Starmites,'' a space-age, comic-book fantasy,
earned nominations for best musical, best actor and best actress
   The Pulitzer Prize-winning ``Heidi Chronicles,'' Wendy
Wasserstein's comedy about the tribulations of an art historian
from the late 1960s to the present, took a best-play nomination.
Others in the category were ``Shirley Valentine,'' Willy Russell's
one-woman play about a bored English housewife; ``Lend Me a
Tenor,'' a farce by Ken Ludwig, and ``Largely New York,'' a comedy
with no dialogue, written, directed and performed by Bill Irwin.
   Irwin also received nominations for best director and best
actor. Also nominated in the acting category were Mikhail
Baryshnikov, ``Metamorphosis''; and Philip Bosco and Victor Garber,
both for ``Lend Me a Tenor.
   Nominated for best actress in a play were Joan Allen, ``The
Heidi Chronicles''; Pauline Collins, ``Shirley Valentine'';
Madeline Kahn, ``Born Yesterday'', and Kate Nelligan, ``Spoils of
War.''
   Nominations for best revival went to four productions that have
closed _ ``Our Town,'' ``Ain't Misbehavin','' ''Cafe Crown'' and
``Ah, Wilderness!''
   Best actor nominees for a musical were Jason Alexander and
Robert La Fosse, ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway''; and Brian Lane Green
and Gabriel Barre, ``Starmites.''
   Top actress in a musical nominations went to Sharon McNight,
``Starmites''; Linda Hopkins and Ruth Brown, both of ``Black and
Blue,'' and Charlotte d'Amboise, ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway.''
   There were only three nominations for best musical. And two
musical categories _ best book and best score _ were eliminated,
reflecting on the poor quality and quantity of this season's

   President Bush paid tribute on Monday to the
nearly 4 million of Americans of Asian and Pacific ancestry, saying
they enrich the nation and have a ``soaring love of freedom.''
   He proclaimed Asian-Pacific-American Heritage Week at a ceremony
in the White House Rose Garden, where he also announced his
nomination of Julia Chang Bloch, of Chinese ancestry, to be
ambassador to Nepal, and Kyo Jhin, a Korean-American, to be chief
counsel for advocacy in the Small Business Administration.
   Bush said Asian-Pacific-Americans earned recognition ``through

self-sacrifice, humility, compassion, an abiding belief in work,
(and) a soaring love of freedom.''
   The president said that while he was the U.S. envoy to China in
1975, he and his wife saw that the center of Asian values is the
family.
   ``The Asian-Pacific community has a special place in my heart,''
Bush said, then quoted a Chinese proverb: ``One generation plants

   He added that ``for decades, Asian-Americans have planted the
trees of prosperity, opportunity and human dignity. And in the

<DATELINE>NARITA, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael J. Armacost, the new U.S.
ambassador to Japan, arrived Monday to take up his post amid
heightened trade tensions between Tokyo and Washington.
   Armacost, a career diplomat who succeeds Mike Mansfield as envoy
to Japan, arrived from Hawaii, where he held consultations with the
commander-in-chief of U.S. Pacific Forces.
   He was accompanied by his wife, Roberta, and was met at Tokyo's
Narita airport by Ambassador Hajime Nishimiya, a protocol official
from the Japanese Foreign Ministry, and Desaix Anderson, deputy
chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy.
   Mansfield retired in December at the age of 85 after serving as
ambassador to Japan for 11 years.
   Armacost, who served as special assistant to the U.S. ambassador
in Tokyo in 1972-74, said he was delighted to be back in Japan and
looked forward to working with the Japanese people.
   Armacost's arrival comes less than a week after the Office of
the U.S. Trade Representative announced 54 items ranging from
helicopters to cosmetics on which it said it may slap tariffs to
penalize what it called Japan's failure to open its
telecommunications market.
   ``Everybody benefits from trade, the more even the better,''
Armacost said at the airport.
   Asked about the Trade Representative's recent move, he said,
``They really haven't made those decisions yet. We're awaiting the
results of those deliberations.''
   Before leaving Washington, Armacost said he hoped to negotiate
trade issues ``in a mature way which benefits us both,'' avoiding
the emotional attacks sometimes called ``Japan-bashing.''
   He said he wants to ``contribute in some way to discussing these
issues in a kind of low-key, cool, objective way which avoids
histrionics and hyperbole and a lot of unnecessary nationalism on
both sides.''
   The United States registered a trade deficit with Japan last
year of about $52 billion, according to U.S. figures.
   Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, Japan's minister of international trade and
industry, said Monday he was hopeful a solution could be worked out
on U.S. complaints alleging barriers to American products in Japan.
   Mitsuzuka, who returned Sunday from talks with top trade
officials in the United States and Canada, told reporters, ``I
asked the United States to give us more time to study'' the trade
representative's report.
   On April 30, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said her
office was reviewing the trade activities of 34 nations whose
markets were not open to U.S. goods.
   Japan was the nation most frequently cited in her report, which
threatened retaliatory tariffs as high as 100 percent.
   The trade representative has set May 30 as a date by which
foreign governments must start market-opening negotiations with the
United States if penalties are to be avoided.
   Mitsuzuka said he hoped a reply could be made by May 27, when
Japan's fiscal 1989 budget is to take effect.
   He said, however, the telecommunications issues were up to the
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.
   Armacost, 52, was undersecretary of state for political affairs,
the State Department's highest-ranking career official, before
being named ambassador to Japan by President Bush.
   He was ambassador to the Philippines in 1982-84 and deputy
assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs in
1980-82.
   He served as deputy assistant secretary of defense in 1978-80,
and for one year prior to that was senior staff member for East
Asia at the National Security Council.
   Armacost taught government at Pomona College in Claremont,
Calif., in 1962-68, was a visiting professor at International
Christian University in Tokyo in 1968-69, and a lecturer at Johns
Hopkins University in 1970-71 and at Georgetown University in
1971-72.

<HEAD>Judge Vows to Resist Pressure, Sets Hamadi Verdict for May 17</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief judge said Monday a
verdict on TWA hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi will be delivered May
17 and pressure from kidnappers who seized a West German in Lebanon
won't affect the case.
   Reports have linked the abduction in south Lebanon on Thursday
of Markus Quint, a young West German relief worker, to the Hamadi
case.
   ``It should be said that if anyone thinks this can influence us,
they are wrong,'' said Judge Heiner Mueckenberger at the opening of
court Monday. ``Here we are dealing with German law and it shall
remain so.''
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is charged with murder and air
piracy in the June 1985 TWA hijacking.
   U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was killed and 39 Americans were
held hostage for 17 days after TWA Flight 847 was seized between
Athens and Rome and diverted to Beirut.
   Prosecutors demand a life sentence for Hamadi, who admits taking
part in the hijacking but denies shooting Stethem.
   ``The verdict will be on the 17th,'' Mueckenberger said. If
Hamadi is convicted, he also will be sentenced on that day.
   Security sources in Bonn said privately there was ``a certain
connection'' between the Quint kidnapping and the Hamadi case, but
gave no details.
   A spokeswoman for ASME-Humanitas, the private relief agency for
which Quint worked, said the kidnappers demand that Hamadi be given
a sentence of five years or less.
   Hamadi went on trial July 5, 1988, in a heavily guarded
courtroom inside Frankfurt's Preungesheim prison. In addition to
determining whether he is guilty, the court must decide whether he
was an adult when the hijacking occurred.
   He could receive a lighter sentence if the court rules he was
under 21. Hamadi claims he is younger than court records indicate.
   Defense lawyer Hans-Burkhardt Steck told the court Monday his
client ``must be judged as a juvenile or adolescent.'' Even though
court documents show Hamadi was born June 13, 1964, he said,
planning of the hijacking began before he was 21 so he should not
be deemed an adult at the time.
   Steck argued that the planning phase was the actual beginning of
the hijacking. The plane was seized June 14, 1985.
   The lawyer said Hamadi acted ``with limited reponsibility''
because he was influenced by those who ordered the hijacking, and
should get no more than five years for his part in the operation
and three years transporting explosives.
   Stethem, 23, of Waldorf, Md., was shot at Beirut airport and his
body thrown from the plane.
   His parents, Richard and Patricia, and their sons Kenneth and
Patrick listened quietly to the closing defense arguments Monday
with no show of emotion.

   Burmese troops attacked rebel bases
near the Thai border, and 40 people were killed and 70 wounded,
Thai military sources said Monday.
   Thai authorities evacuated 100 villagers after 2,500 soldiers
attacked Karen strongholds at Wan Kha and Ban Wang Takian on Sunday.
   Several artillery shells were reported to have fallen inside
Thai territory and Burmese troops crossed into Thailand during the
assault, the military source said on condition of anonymity.
   About 30 Burmese soldiers and 10 guerrillas were killed, he said.
   Also Sunday, 3,000 Burmese civilians fled into Thailand at Sai
Luad to escape fighting at a third border location, Myawaddy.
   Karen rebels are among a dozen ethnic minority groups fighting
for greater autonomy from the Rangoon government. The government in
recent months has intensified its campaign against the Karens and
has severely disrupted the cross border trade that sustains their
insurgency.
   The Karen strongholds are located along Thailand's western
border with Burma.

   Police and drug agents seized 100
pounds of heroin and four tons of marijuana worth more than $80
million in the United States, where the narcotics were to be sold,
a U.S. diplomat said Monday.
   The drugs were packed in cans labeled as containing noodles and
stored in a warehouse near Bangkok's airport, said U.S. Embassy
spokesman Ross Petzing.
   Officers from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency and a local
narcotics unit raided the warehouse Sunday and Monday, Petzing
said. Thai police Lt. Col. Amarerit Watanavibool said one person
was arrested.
   The drugs were brought by road from northern Thailand and were
to be shipped via Mexico to the United States, he said. There, the
heroin would have a street value of about $80 million, and the
marijunana would be worth about $320,000, Petzing said.
   Thailand is a major conduit for heroin, made from opium grown in
the hills of Burma, Thailand and Laos.

<HEAD>364 Vietnamese Refugees Arrive In Philippines In Six Days</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 364 Vietnamese refugees
arrived in the Philippine in the last six days, the U.N. High
Commission for Refugees said Monday.
   Pierce Gerety, the commission's representative in Manila, said
1,286 Vietnamese boat people landed in the Philippines in April,
compared with 276 in the same month last year.
   All have been transferred to refugee centers for medical
attention, rehabilitation and interviews, Gerety said.
   The Philippine government announced March 21 it would screen
boat people to determine if they suffer political persecution in
their homeland. Under a new policy adopted by the six-member
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, those who fail to prove
persecution will be turned back.
   Other member nations are Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore
and Thailand. Association officials say the refugees seek better
economic conditions.
   The refugees brave the seas in flimsy boats and increasing
attacks by pirates who since March have killed more than 200 boat
people.
   Hong Kong blames the influx of refugees on the Hanoi government.
Security Secretary Geoffrey Barnes said Friday he believes Hanoi is
allowing the exodus to achieve ``benefits'' at an international
conference on Indochinese refugees in Geneva next month.
   Barnes spoke after announcing more than 1,400 refugees from
Vietnam arrived in the British colony this month, forcing the
government to set up tents at a detention center because of a lack
of accommodation.
   In Seoul, maritime police said a South Korean fishing boat
rescued 78 Vietnamese refugees adrift in a wooden boat in the
Yellow Sea.
   They were rescued Sunday morning in South Korean territorial
waters and taken to a nearby island for protection, the police said.
   They quoted Unha-ho, captain of the rescue boat, as saying the
refugees looked healthy and were waving a flag on which ``S.O.S.''
was painted in red when he found them.

   Ted and Heddy Hess say they've never
had second thoughts about having a human pacemaker implanted in
their pet pooch, Susie.
   ``She is just like our baby, since all of our children have left
home,'' Mrs. Hess said. ``She is one of the family.''
   The 12-year-old Dalmatian underwent the procedure in late March
after being diagnosed as having total blockage of the blood vessels
to her heart.
   Veterinarian Michael Koch referred the Hesses to Ohio State
University's veterinary college teaching hospital in Columbus,
where researchers are experimenting with pacemakers in small
animals.
   ``I'd be willing to bet that this is the only dog in the state
with one,'' Koch said. He said pacemakers used in animals come from
humans who no longer need a pacemaker, have changed pacemaker
styles, or have died.
   ``It's a shame to throw a good, working pacemaker away,'' he
said.
   Hess, owner and operator of a jewelry store in Williamson, said
he and his wife got Susie from a Charleston pound 11 years ago.
She's doing well with her new pacemaker, he said.
   Hess said doctors in Columbus were anxious to try the procedure
on Susie and donated their time. Mrs. Hess said when the dog dies
she and her husband plan to donate the pacemaker back to Ohio State.

   It may sound like sending coals to
Newcastle, but Arizona and Texas nurseries are shipping palm trees
to Florida.
   That's because so many home owners and developers want that
Florida-postcard look of streets lined with swaying palms that
demand has outstripped supply.
   ``Orlando, Florida, is not tropical. But they want to look
tropical,'' said Tom Wallis of the architectural firm of Wallis,
Baker &amp; Verlander P.A. in Orlando. His company placed more than 300
palms around Orlando International Airport during its expansion
project.
   Gateway Gardens, a nursery in Oviedo that grows palms, has
doubled the acreage devoted to palm trees in the past eight years,
said nursery manager Kathy Cox.
   ``Everybody thinks when they come to Florida from up north they
have to have palm trees,'' Cox said.
   Enter imports to the rescue.
   Gerald Marston, a senior associate with Sasaki Associates Inc.,
said the 30-foot Washingtonia and Canary Island date palms that
grace the perimeter of the Orlando Arena were grown in Texas and
Arizona.

<HEAD>National Guard Delivering Drinking Water To Six Counties</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Iowa National Guard began delivering
drinking water Monday to communities in six southern Iowa counties
parched by two consecutive years of drought.
   Officials said the number of communities getting water is sure
to grow, possibly later this week.
   ``It's a growing problem in other counties, and we're going to
continue to monitor that situation,'' Gov. Terry Branstad said at
his regular meeting with reporters.
   Guard trucks dropped off 1,850-gallon water tanks in eight small
farming communities whose wells have gone dry in the six counties
and planned to replenish the tanks daily. The water delivery
program is the first in the state.
   Cities on the delivery list are Grand River, Pleasanton, Maloy,
Benton, Redding, Delphos, Beaconsfield and Thayer. Packwood will be
added later this week, said Ellen Gordon, Disaster Services
director.
   Water has been rationed in the communities and residents have
been traveling as far as 30 miles to bring in drinking water, Ms.
Gordon said.
   The water is being delivered free. State officials are
negotiating with the Army Corps of Engineers about laying water
pipes to drought-stricken areas.
   Branstad said the cost to the state would be about $500 a day.
   Department of Natural Resources officials are still developing
plans to ship in water for livestock.
   Officials are checking quarries, gravel pits, abandoned wells
and other areas as possible sources of water, Branstad said.
   Although drought has struck several sections of the state, it
has hit hardest in southern Iowa where areas of several counties
have been declared disaster areas. Just before it adjourned, the
Legislature approved a $250,000 drought relief program that is
trigged when 15 counties are declared disaster areas.
   ``We recognize the problem is severe in these counties,'' said
Branstad.

   Nine soldiers went on trial Monday
on charges of trying to burn down the military academy in Belgrade
last year, the state Tanjug news agency said.
   The military prosecutor's office accused the soldiers of trying
to cause extensive damage to the facilities when they set the fire
in August, Tanjug said. The blaze was extinguished and damage was
minor, the agency said.
   The prosecutors also accused the soldiers of belonging to an
illegal Albanian nationalist organization that seeks to gain
control of southern Kosovo province and secede to join neighboring
Albania.
   Five of the soldiers are ethnic Albanians, who form a 90 percent
majority in Kosovo. Christian Serbs allege they are harassed by the
Moslem Albanians in the province.
   If convicted, the nine face a maximum prison term of 15 years.

<HEAD>Taiwan Officials Return From Historic China Trip</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first Taiwanese officials to visit
China stood for the communist nation's national anthem, but this
did not imply recognition of Beijing, a government official said
Monday.
   Finance Minister Shirley Kuo, who led the 12-delegate team, said
they stood because they feared they would ejected from the annual
meeting of the Asian Development Bank in Beijing.
   ``We did not pay any respect to the anthem at all. I even made a
gesture by crossing my arms to signal that I do not recognize
(China),'' Kuo told a news conference on her return Monday from the
three-day meeting.
   The action sparked controversy in Taiwan. Some lawmakers and
newspapers labeled it tacit recognition of the communist regime.
   Analysts say the six-day China trip is part of a Taipei
initiative to break its diplomatic isolation with a more flexible
foreign policy.
   In an editorial Monday, the China Times said the trip signaled
Taipei has readjusted its relations with Beijing by abandoning its
conservative, staunch political ideology to face reality.
   ``The breakthrough has not only won praises from this nation and
abroad, but also triggered worries and dissatisfaction from the
conservatives,'' it said.
   President Lee Teng-hui said Sunday the delegates completed their
mission successfully.
   The liberal Independence Evening Post reported Monday that 82.3
percent of 407 readers questioned said in a telephone survey they
were satisfied with the delegation's performance. Only 3.2 percent
of those polled said they were disappointed. The rest declined
comment.
   The Asian Development Bank, which Taiwan helped establish in
1966, is the only major international organization in which Taiwan
is a member.
   Only 23 countries have diplomatic ties with the Nationalist
government on Taiwan, while 136 countries recognize China.
   Taiwan boycotted the bank's meetings in 1986 and 1987 after
China became a member. It attended last year's meeting, but its
delegates covered their name plates with Nationalist flags and
placed signs that read ``Under Protest.''
   ``The trip is a significant step toward thawing the longtime
hostilities between both sides of the Taiwan Straits,'' said Chang
Ling-chen, a political science professor at National Taiwan
University.
   ``It indicated that we no longer ignore the fact of communist
rule on the mainland,'' she added.
   The Nationalists, who fled to this island in 1949 after losing a
civil war on the mainland, still are technically at war with the
Chinese communists.

<HEAD>Records Show Free Housing Enabled Wright to Collect Extra Income</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Free housing given to House Speaker Jim Wright
by a business partner enabled him to collect upward of $25,000 in
extra income by renting out the duplex residence he owned in Fort
Worth, Texas, House records show.
   Financial disclosure documents show that Wright rented out the
house from 1979 through most of 1983 before selling it for more
than $250,000. Wright reported rental income in each of those years
of $5,000 to $15,000, made possible because he and his wife had
moved their belongings to housing provided by Fort Worth real
estate developer George Mallick.
   The housing Mallick provided, first in an apartment building and
later a condominium, was valued by the House ethics committee at
$53,488 for the period 1979 through 1988 and is the basis for some
of the 69 House rules violations alleged against the Texas Democrat.
   Members of Congress are required to report their finances only
in broad ranges, so it is impossible to determine the precise value
of the rental income from the disclosure documents.
   Wright will have to defend himself beginning late this month at
a trial-like disciplinary hearing, and on Monday he announced he
has assembled a three-pronged legal team to make his case before
the committee, the full House and the public.
   The team also was drafting defense motions which were expected
to be filed later in the week, contesting some aspects of the
charges. A media briefing on the defense arguments was scheduled
Tuesday.
   At the same time, Wright continued to be pummeled by news
reports of other questionable financial dealings, including a Wall
Street Journal story citing a number of free flights accepted by
Wright in 1983 and 1984 aboard corporate planes of a financially
troubled nursing home business in which he held a $100,000 interest.
   The newspaper, citing an unidentified former official of the
company, Jewell Enterprises, said the practice apparently violates
House rules against accepting gifts worth more than $100 from
individuals with a direct interest in legislation.
   Referring to the company's owner, T.R. Jewell, Wright said:
``Mr. Jewell gave me a ride but it wasn't on any airplane. He took
me for a ride,'' a reference to the company's eventual bankruptcy
and Wright's loss of most of his $100,000 investment.
   ``I have absolutely no recollection of ever being on any
airplane I thought was owned by anybody connected with that firm,''
Wright said. He declined to answer when asked whether Jewell, an
official of the Arlington, Texas, bank which loaned Wright the
money to buy into the nursing home venture, had helped him get the
loan.
   Wright also took issue with testimony at a federal fraud trial
in Dallas involving allegations that officials of Commodore Savings
Association raised illegal corporate political contributions for a
1985 special House election in which Wright took a personal
interest.
   On Friday, the institution's former chief financial officer,
David Farmer, said he was told Wright would kill legislation
opposed by the savings and loan industry in return for $250,000 in
campaign contributions.
   He testified that he was ``amazed ... that someone as high up as
Jim Wright would be involved in this.''
   Wright denied the allegation and said he does not know Farmer.
He invited reporters to go to Fort Worth and interview constituents
he has tried to help. ``You can look until you're blind, ask until
you're hoarse, listen until you're deaf and you will never find
anybody of whom I've asked anything in return,'' he said.
   In an announcement, the speaker's office said his legal defense
team will include Democratic patriarch and former defense secretary
Clark Clifford as senior legal and political adviser; Stephen D.
Susman of Houston, expected to handle questioning at the
disciplinary hearing; Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., adviser and
emissary to House Democrats; Robert Altman, a Washington attorney
and associate of Clifford; and Neal S. Manne, a former counsel to
the Senate Judiciary Committee who is a member of Susman's firm.
   Overall legal strategy will continue to be mapped by William C.
Oldaker, who has handled the case for Wright thus far, along with
co-counsels Lyn Utrecht and Eric Kleinfeld.
   Susman's firm represented the Hunt brothers in their efforts to
resist collection of $1.5 billion in debt stemming from the Hunts'
attempt to corner the world silver market.
   Legal bills for the defense team are being paid out of Wright's
campaign funds, a permitted use, said spokesman Mark Johnson.

<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department scientist said
Monday the mysteries of outer space are no more perplexing than
those a few inches below Earth's surface.
   Richard W. Zobel, a plant geneticist, said the root zone of
plants, called the rhizosphere, is a teeming world of minerals,
gases, water and life forms _ insects, earthworms, microscopic
nematode worms, a host of microorganisms, living and dead plant
roots, and the chemicals they exude.
   ``We don't even begin to thoroughly understand it, although
we're slowly pulling it together,'' he said. ``I'd say our
knowledge of the area six inches to two feet below the soil's
surface is comparable to our knowledge of outer space right now.''
   Zobel works for the department's Agricultural Research Service
at the agency's laboratory in Ithaca, N.Y.
   One reason for lack of knowledge about the world at our feet is
that ``only recently have we had the tools to study it, and they're
still not up to the job,'' he said. ``Soil physics and chemistry,
plant biology and physiology, entomology and microbiology all
provide tools, but none of them is designed to work with more than
a single microorganism or a single plant at a time.''
   And when a scientist has to ``put all these elements together
and try to study them, it's tough,'' Zobel said. ``We need to learn
how microorganisms interact with the plant, and with each other.
Plant roots aren't all the same; they're functionally different and
have different growth patterns. Some die back every two weeks,
continually feeding the microorganisms in the soil.''
   Zobel spoke at an annual symposium held by the agency at
Beltsville, Md. His remarks were included in reports issued by the
department.
   Topics in the four-day conference include genetic engineering
and some of the new technologies for investigating the Earth's root
zone.
   At a ceremony, Henry A. Wallace, who died in 1965, was honored
as the first member of a new USDA honor roll of agricultural
scientists. Wallace was secretary of agriculture in 1933-40 and
U.S. vice president 1941-45.
   Wallace, whose roots were deep in Iowa agriculture, gained
acclaim for his work as a corn breeder and as the founder of the
first commercial hybrid seed company. His father, Henry C. Wallace,
was secretary of agriculture in the early 1920s.

   Atlantis' astronauts
glided out of orbit to a safe landing in the Mojave Desert today
after a four-day mission that sent a robot spacecraft streaking
through the solar system toward Venus.
   Commander David Walker guided the 97-ton winged spaceship to a
stop on a concrete runway at 12:43 p.m., concluding a flight that
covered 1.68 million miles and launched the first U.S.
interplanetary mission in 11 years.
   ``Congratulations and a nice landing, and you've extended the
shuttle reach far beyond Earth orbit now. Magellan would be
proud,'' said Mission Control, referring to the 16th century
Portugese explorer for whom the unmanned Venus probe is named.
   About 27,500spectators, the smallest crowd ever to watch a
shuttle landing, were on hand in 90-degree heat. The smallest
previous crowd was 35,000, in 1985. An estimated 460,000 were here
for Discovery's landing March 18, a Saturday.
   An hour before landing, Walker fired braking rockets 184 miles
above the Indian Ocean to drop Atlantis out of orbit and start it
on a blazing dive through the atmosphere on a course over the
Pacific and across the California coast.
   Two sonic booms crackled over the desert as Atlantis swooped
powerless through the clear sky, making wide circles as it
descended. NASA selected a concrete runway because of crosswinds
gusting up to 28 mph on two hard clay runways.
   As the five astronauts ended the journey, the Magellan probe
they released on Monday was more than 640,000 miles from Earth on a
15-month, 800-million-mile voyage to Venus to map its cloud-veiled
surface with super-sharp radar.
   Scientists say the images should tell them about the history of
Venus and the evolution of its sister planet, Earth. Sulfuric acid
clouds and a carbon dioxide atmosphere have had a ``greenhouse
effect'' on Venus, with surface temperatures of 900 degrees, and
some scientists fear Earth may similarly overheat.
   On Sunday, the astronauts stayed up an hour past bedtime to stow
equipment after replacing one of its four main computers, which
failed briefly in the only major glitch of the journey. The
computers actually fly the shuttle most of the time.
   The problem posed no threat to the flight _ the shuttle has four
computers, a backup and a spare and can land on one computer _ but
NASA decided to take no chances and had the crew cut short their
experiments and install a spare.
   The crew took 4{ hours to install the computer and then got
about seven hours of sleep.
   ``We send our congratulations. Good work,'' said Mission Control
communicator Tammy Jernigan. ``We wanted to point out that this is
the first time that such a changeout has ever taken place on
orbit.''
   The astronauts' wake-up call this morning consisted of a barking
dog and the Beatles' song ``A Hard Day's Night,'' a reference to
the repair work the night before.
   ``Good morning. It's time to come home,'' Mission Control
communicator Ken Cameron told the crew, whose members also included
pilot Ronald Grabe and mission specialists Norman Thagard, Mark Lee
and Mary Cleave.
   The crew abandoned plans to melt and then crystallize a metal
sample in a furnace and to photograph lightning and polluted areas
on Earth.
   Before the problem, Walker noted, ``You couldn't ask for a
better flying machine.''

   The Ashmolean, Britain's oldest museum,
launched an urgent appeal Monday to raise $5.3 million because of
cuts in government grants.
   Dr. Christopher White, the museum's director, said funds were
needed to offset an annual deficit of $158,650 and avoid closing
galleries, cutting staff and charging admission. He said lack of
funds had already forced the museum to close on Mondays.
   Entrance has been free since the museum opened in 1683. The

<HEAD>French Conservative Opposes Elimination of US Nukes in Europe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former French Premier Jacques Chirac on Monday
said the United States insist on modernizing short-range nuclear
missiles in Europe despite broad West German opposition.
   ``Nuclear deterrent is the only means to insure peace,'' Chirac
told reporters. ``For people to be sensible, they have to be
frightened. ... Anything that would lead to denuclearization is too
dangerous.''
   He said he thought Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev would
succeed in his reforms, but that made no difference to the nuclear
question because ``we will never eliminate the risk of war.''
   Chirac, who met with President Bush on Monday, in in the United
States on a nine-day visit.
   The French conservative leader said he understood the fears of
West Germans about upgrading the Lance missiles, most or all of
which would be based on their territory.
   But, he said, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl ``is a sensible
man, a European and a man of peace, and I am absolutely convinced
that he will find a way to have the modernization of the Lance
accepted by German public opinion and that there will be no crisis
in NATO.''
   ``Naturally,'' Chirac said, ``this means that the Americans must
be very firm.''
   He said he was fully in accord with Bush and with British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher that the missiles should be modernized
and that he didn't think West Germany would withdraw from NATO if
the alliance does build new weapons.
   ``There is absolutely no question'' that Mrs. Thatcher will
remain adamant in her support, Chirac said, adding that French
President Francois Mitterrand ``must also use his influence on the
Germans.''
   He recalled that, at Kohl's invitation, Mitterrand made a speech
in 1983 to the West German Parliament. The speech played a decisive
role in winning German agreement to the deployment of medium-range
U.S. Pershing 2 missiles in Germany, Chirac said.
   ``It's true that that today we do have the impression that Mr.
Mitterrand is less firm,'' he said, but added that he thought the
French president would in the end come out strongly for
modernization.
   Chirac said Mitterrand appeared to be showing restraint out of
concern for Kohl and because of his own policy toward the Soviet
Bloc, ``which perhaps would leave him to be more open that in the
past in negotiations.''
   ``I personally feel that he (Mitterrand) will be firm and in the
spirit of very deep friendship with the Germans he will make use of
his influence to support a solution which will lead to a
modernization of the Lance.''
   Kohl, Chirac said, ``is faced with serious domestic policy
problems. Naturally we don't want to interfere because this perhaps
might entail the risk of a Red-Green coalition, which certainly
wouldn't be an improvement of the situation from our point of
view.''

<HEAD>White House Tones Down NASA Scientist's ``Greenhouse'' Testimony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writrer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top NASA scientist told a Senate panel
Monday that testimony he'd prepared on likely harsh effects of
global warming was toned down by the Bush administration despite
his vigorous objections.
   Dr. James Hansen said the Office of Management and Budget forced
him to contradict _ within his own prepared statement _ his finding
that a buildup of ``greenhouse effect'' gases would increase the
likelihood of drought.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., who questioned Hansen at a subcommittee
hearing, said he saw ``a form of scientific fraud'' by the
administration, which has been taking what environmentalists
consider a go-slow position on dealing with global warming.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater confirmed that changes
had been made in Hansen's prepared testimony, but he said the
scientist had ``never been muzzled.''
   The development came two days after it became known that William
Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, and other
officials had been rebuffed by the White House when they suggested
the U.S. government call for an international convention on global
warming.
   Gore, D-Tenn., chairman of a science subcommittee, commended
Hansen for courage, and said that if administration officials
``attempt any kind of retribution in return for candor they will
have on their hands the congressional equivalent of World War III.''
   Another government scientist, Dr. Jerry D. Mahlman of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said he had a
similar experience with the budget office in congressional
testimony he prepared in February.
   Mahlman said he successfully fought changes that would have been
``embarrassing to me'' in facing his fellow scientists, and told
senators, ``If we do not have the right to be wrong, we have
squelched the right to be creative.''
   At the White House, Fitzwater said that Hansen's written
testimony, as submitted, represented administration policy. He
called the practice of alterations routine, and said the changes
were made by a budget official ``four of five levels down from the
top.''
   He said the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
scientist was free to express his own views in answering committee
questions: ``He's never been muzzled. He's free to say whatever he
wants.''
   Fitzwater said that much disagreement exists among scientists,
inside and outside the government, on the global warming issue and
said that Hansen's original testimony gave the appearance that
``there was unanimity within the government on this matter. We
simply wanted to point out that there wasn't.
   ``We thought we were commenting on policy, not scientific
evidence,'' Fitzwater said.
   Hansen told the committee that it was unlikely scientists would
alter the conclusions of computer models that greenhouse gases
would increase drought in low and middle latitudes. But the
testimony also said the computer models were not reliable.
   ``Why did you contradict yourself?'' Gore asked Hansen, who then
related his confrontation with budget office officials.
   ``I did object,'' he said. ``I don't believe the scientific
aspects in testimony should be altered. I did try to get them to
compromise. ... I was not successful.''
   Hansen said officials also added a sentence that it was unknown
whether the buildup of greenhouse gases was from natural forces or
from human activities. Hansen and others at the hearing said humans
were primarily responsible by burning fossil fuel, cutting down
tropical rain forests and other actions.
   ``Every scientist that testified here today ... and every
reputable scientist in the field supports your conclusion this is
primarily a human cause. It's not an act of God. OMB forced you to
say it may ... be just the forces of nature,'' Gore said.
   ``They're acting as if they're scared of the truth,'' the
senator added. ``It's a form of scientific fraud by them. ... The
administration does not want to act. It wants to sit still and do
nothing.''
   The greenhouse effect is said to occur when gases in the earth's
atmosphere trap radiant heat near the planet's surface. In addition
to natural buildup, scientists say the gases have increased greatly
because of burning coal, oil, and gas, and destruction of tropical
rain forests.
   At a separate hearing Monday, William M. Diefenderfer III,
nominated to be OMB's deputy director, told the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee that he had no first-hand knowledge of the Hansen
changes, and added that he was told Hansen's protests had not
reached the agency's upper echelons.
   ``If there was an attempt to alter or change scientific fact or
conclusion, it would not be a policy I would support,'' he said.
But he defended the agency's right to change a witness' conclusions
if they differed from the president's policies.
   Administration officials said Saturday that EPA head Reilly and
other government proponents of a greater U.S. leadership role on
global warming had urged the White House to call _ at a
U.N.-sponsored meeting beginning Monday in Geneva _ for an
international convention on the subject but Chief of Staff John
Sununu had said the idea was premature.
   EPA spokesman David Cohen said Saturday of Sununu, ``Basically,
he has been extremely supportive and he has said only that he has
some questions that he wants answers.'' Cohen said Reilly also
believes the questions ``deserve answers.''

   A masked gunman demanded car
keys from a farmer and was shot in the face Monday, police said.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said the
wounded man and a companion who also wore a mask apparently were
fleeing the scene of the explosion 20 minutes earlier.
   The bomb near Clogher, a small town 45 miles west of Belfast,
blew an unmarked military van onto its side and slightly injured
two soldiers. Police said the bomb may have been a land mine.
   Press Association said the masked men abandoned a motorcycle
close to the farm house outside Clogher and told the farmer to hand
over his car keys.
   The seriously wounded intruder was hospitalized.
   British Broadcasting Corp. television reported he was confronted
by a resident of the farm, who was carrying a shotgun. However, it
was not clear who that person was.
   Police provided no other details. They did not say who shot the
farmer and whether the other man escaped.
   A spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary, speaking on
condition of anonymity, also said police had not identified the
wounded man or determined whether he belongs to the Irish
Republican Army.
   Soldiers have been a frequent target of the outlawed IRA in its
20-year campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the van
attack.
   On Saturday, nine soldiers were injured in two separate
explosions in County Armagh, police said.

<HEAD>Wisconsin Governor Calls For Federal Payments For Spearfishing Costs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Wisconsin's governor called on the federal
government Monday to help pay for security provided at lakes where
Chippewa Indians spearfish under the guarantee of 19th century
treaties.
   Gov. Tommy G. Thompson said the arrests of more than 170
non-Indian protesters during the Indians' spring spearfishing
season, which essentially ended Sunday after two weeks, signaled
the need for federal intervention.
   ``I can't imagine that the federal officials would want to see
this situation continue,'' Thompson said.
   The Republican governor met with reporters before leaving for
Washington, where he was to meet with Wisconsin congressmen. On
Tuesday, he is to meet with U.S. Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan
about the burdens the federal treaties with the Chippewa have
placed on the state.
   The Chippewa began spearfishing two years after a federal court
ruled that the tribe retained rights to hunt, fish, trap and gather
wild grain off their reservations when they gave the northern third
of Wisconsin to the United States. Sport fishermen complain that
spearing fish when they are in shallow water is so much easier than
catching fish by rod and reel that Indians have an unfair advantage.
   Opposition to spearfishing grew even more heated this year after
the state announced it would reduce walleye pike catch limits for
sport anglers because a federal court had ruled the Chippewa could
spear up to 100 percent of the fish that biologists determine can
be safely taken from the lakes.
   Thompson said the state could not continue picking up the cost
of enforcing the treaties. The Legislature recently appropriated
about $300,000 for meeting peace-keeping costs at the lakes this
spring, plus $150,000 to complete reimbursing local enforcement for
last year's enforcement expenses.
   ``If this was a state issue, I would figure out a way to solve
it immediately,'' he said. ``I would call the Legislature into
session.''
   Thompson wouldn't detail what he would discuss with federal
officials. But he said he would not seek abrogation of the Chippewa
treaties.
   Four of the six Chippewa bands in Wisconsin confirmed Sunday
they have ended spearfishing this spring after two weeks of
enduring racial slurs and rock throwing from anti-treaty protesters.
   The tribal chairman of the Lac du Flambeau band, most active of
the Chippewa spearers, said the continuation of spearfishing amid
the violent protests was a victory over racism and empty promises
from politicians.
   Michael Allen said the clearest victory occurred Saturday night
when an estimated 1,000 vocal supporters of Chippewa treaty rights
outnumbered the 600 or so protesters at Butternut Lake.
   ``We showed that we can, if pressed, outnumber the racists at
the boat landings,'' Allen said.
   ``All season long we have shown that racial violence can't bully
us into surrendering the right,'' he added. ``Having shown all
that, we have decided it's time to stop for now.''
   DNR spokesman Dave Kunelius said the four Chippewa bands ended
spearing mostly because of the weather and the end of walleye
spawning, when the fish leave shallow water.
   The tribes could spear later in the year or use gill nets after
June 1 on lakes of more than 1,000 acres, according to tribal
ordinances and federal court rulings.

<HEAD>Small Firms Urged to Help With Child Care</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Monday challenged small
businesses to ``take the lead'' in finding more creative ways to
provide child care for working parents.
   He said small business ``is at the cutting edge of the economic
expansion that's 77 months old and still going strong.'' Small
businesses during the past decade have created two out of every
three new jobs in the U.S. economy, Bush said.
   The president spoke during a White House ceremony at which he
announced the selection of Tad Bretting of Ashland, Wis., president
of a family-run machinery business, as National Small Business
Person of the Year.
   He said the issue of child care ``should be on the top of the
list for all all small business people,'' claiming: ``A small
business is less a corporation than a family.''
   ``I urge America's small businesses to take the lead in
developing creative solutions in child care,'' Bush said.
   The president has proposed legislation to give low-income
working families up to a $1,000 tax credit for each child under age
4.
   However, rival legislation sponsored by Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn., under which the government would provide more direct help
to businesses and individuals providing child care, is headed for
Senate action.
   Bush indicated opposition to such an approach. ``I think it has
to be decided by the federal government making as flexible as
possible the use of child care tax credits,'' he said.
   Speaking of this year's award winner, Bush said Bretting had
entered the business in 1958, ``and those 30 years have seen the
Bretting Company grow adn prosper from 11 employees to 260 today,
from $120,000 in sales to $30 million.''
   ``And today his company is the world's leading producer of high
tech custom-designed machinery for making paper products,'' Bush
said. ``And the secret of Tad's success is the one small business
people know so well _ it all comes down to taking good care of
customers.''
   The business has been in Bretting's family since 1890, when it
produced machinery for sawmills.
   Bush presented Bretting with a plaque in a ceremony in the East
Room attended by other small business leaders and many of the 52
men and women who were in contention for the award.
   ``This room is full of success stories today,'' Bush said.
   The award is given annually by the Small Business Administration.
   Bush also announced other finalists in the competition,
including first runner-up Richard Barlow of Salina, Kans, president
of REMA Bakeware Inc.; and second runners-up Carolyn Stradley,
president of C&amp;S Paving Inc. of Marietta, Ga; and Chad H. Olson,
chairman of The Pro Image Inc., in Bountiful, Utah.

<TEXT>
   A House panel asked former Housing and Urban
Development Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. to testify so it can
evaluate statements by one of his associates Monday that the blame
for abuses in a federal housing program goes beyond what an
investigator has reported.
   Former federal housing commissioner Thomas T. Demery told the
House Government Operations subcommittee on employment and housing
that problems existed in a low-income housing rehabilitation
program before he gained the post in October 1986.
   Demery told the panel that one of his HUD predecessors, Silvio
Debartolomeis, had been reluctant to sign funding requests for the
so-called moderate rehabilitation program in 1986. Once, Demery
said, Debartolomeis left town rather than sign a funding request.
   Demery said a HUD inspector general's report two weeks ago with
his name on the cover was motivated by ``malice, negligence and a
cover-up, or a combination of the three'' by the inspector
general's office.
   He questioned why Deborah Gore Dean, former executive assistant
to Pierce, was mentioned only briefly in the 700-page report, even
though he considered her one of the program's major participants.
   Demery's statements that he has been ``singled out'' will be
assessed by the committee, which has asked Pierce to appear, said
panel member Christopher Shays, R-Conn.
   Demery ``is saying his direct predecessor had problems with the
program and just left town and had someone else sign. We need to
check that out, and it happened on (Pierce's) watch,'' Shays said
after the hearing.
   The inspector general's report two weeks ago alleged ``a
perception of favoritism'' in the awarding of funds to fix up
housing for the poor. HUD Secretary Jack Kemp shut down the program
temporarily and blocked some $100 million of pending contracts.
   Part of the problem was poor documentation in the
decision-making process, Inspector General Paul Adams told the
committee. Another, he said, was the volume of highly-paid
consultants _ many of them former HUD or other government officials
_ who used clout to win contracts for developers.
   ``Your view of the role of the consultant was really not one of
providing technical expertise, but of providing inside information,
privileged information, special access to the individuals who made
the decisions?'' subcommittee Chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif., asked
Adams.
   ``Yes, sir, that's correct,'' Adams replied.
   The committee has asked former Interior Secretary James Watt to
testify about his work on behalf of a 312-unit project in Essex, Md.
   Watt earned a $300,000 fee despite indicating that he ``had
little if any knowledge of the program,'' Adams said. But Adams
said he knew of no instance where laws were broken by consultants.
   Most projects selected during the past five years were done
without open competition, and appeared to be concentrated in
Florida, Puerto Rico and a few other areas, Adams testified.
   But Demery said Florida and Puerto Rico simply had ``long
waiting lists'' and that other areas were also funded on the basis
of need. Still, Demery said he recognized problems with the
program, and sought in May 1988 to ensure the selection system was
fair and well-documented.
   He said he never stated or implied ``an ability on the part of
HUD to favor a specific project.''

<TEXT>
   Officials of the Smithsonian Institution and
the Museum of the American Indian in New York signed an agreement
Monday to transfer the world's largest collection of American
Indian artifacts to the Smithsonian.
   As a symbol of the agreement, Roland Force, director of the New
York museum, presented Robert McC. Adams, secretary of the
Smithsonian, with a peace pipe-tomahawk.
   ``This single piece does, in a very real way, symbolize the
entire collection,'' Force said of the pipe, which had been given
to Tecumseh, the Shawnee chief, by Col. Henry A. Proctor of the
British Army in 1812.
   The museum agreement capped years of often-acrimonious
negotiations among federal, state and local politicians, officials
of the Smithsonian and the Indian museum, and American Indians
concerned for the preservation of their heritage.
   A memorandum of understanding covering the transfer was signed
at a ceremony overlooking the site where the Smithsonian hopes to
build the National Museum of the American Indian. The museum _
which would be the Smithsonian's 14th in Washington _ is to display
objects from the Heye Foundation collection of more than a million
artifacts.
   ``I don't think there ever will have been a museum quite like
the one we foresee, with great confidence, going up on the site
behind me,'' Adams said, with his back to the plot between the
National Air and Space Museum and the U.S. Capitol, the last
available place on the Mall.
   The signing came after the Smithsonian board of regents voted,
without dissent, to approve a plan to build a national Indian
museum in Washington and also to move the existing Museum of the
American Indian to larger quarters in the old U.S. Custom House, a
landmark lower Manhattan building owned by the federal government.
Part of the collection will be exhibited at the new New York site.
   Under the agreement, the Smithsonian also will build additional
storage space at its museum support center in Suitland, Md., for
the part of the collection moving to Washington.
   Suzan Harjo, a member of the New York museum's board and herself
an AmericanIndian, said she hoped the new museum would foster ``a
great healing process in America'' between Indians and other
Americans.
   ``It's going to be a long way between now and actual bricks and
mortar, but this is more than a museum; it has more than that
meaning to all of us,'' she said.
   Legislation is still needed to give the Smithsonian the millions
of dollars necessary for the undertaking. The plan also must be
approved by New York state courts, which Force said he expected to
be easily given.
   Adams estimated that it would take about six years before the
Washington museum's doors open. The memorandum of understanding did
not include a cost estimate, but earlier this year Adams put a
pricetag of more than $150 million on the entire undertaking.
   Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, who was a principal architect
of the agreement, said he would introduce legislation this week to
authorize the startup.

<HEAD>Study Says Army Relying More on Reserves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army has responded to budgetary
constraints by relying more on reserve units which are less capable
than regular forces, said a study released Monday.
   ``Because so many assets are in the reserve components, it is
not in particularly good shape to execute a worldwide `strategic
concept' of multiple contingencies,'' said a report written for the
Brookings Institution by analysts Martin Binkin and William
Kaufmann.
   Reserve units account for 43 perent of Army combat units and 70
percent of tactical support personnel, said the study by the
liberal think tank.
   ``Such a degree of dependence would not be a source of concern
if the reserve components came close to matching their active-duty
counterparts in capability and readiness. But they do not,'' said
the 162-page report, ``U.S. Army Guard and Reserve: Rhetoric,
Realities and Risks.''
   Traditionally, reserve units have been ``forces held in reserve,
with a cushion of time to complete mobilization and traiing,'' it
said. ``Today, many of the Army's reserve units are expected to
deploy along with the active forces, some with only a few days
notice and most of the remainder within weeks rather than months or
years as in the past,'' it said.
   ``Reserve units, both combat and support, would be among the
first deployed in a range of conflicts -- from fast-breaking
limited contingencies to major confrontation in Central Europe''
said the report.
   Under current plans, 40 percent of Army forces to be deployed in
the first month of a European war would consist of reserve forces,
it said.
   Reserve and National Guard units would make up 50 percent of the
service's force structure under the proposed Bush administration
budget for the 1990 fiscal year, Maj. Gen. Merle Freitag, director
of the Army budget office, told reporters on April 25.
   But the Army maintains that ``the reserve component question is
not directly related to our ability to fight on multiple fronts,''
said Army spokesman Lt. Col. John Chapla.
   The Army has acknowledged that ``we do not have a force capable
of doing everything in the world that we might face, so the ability
to fight on multiple fronts is a different issue,'' Chapla said.
   In an era of fiscal restraint, the Pentagon budget is expected
to shrink rather than expand, and the Army anticipates no reversal
of its growing dependence of reserve units.
   ``Our general position has been that the reserves play a very
vital role in any future contingency planning,'' said Chapla. ``Our
policy has been to equip units on a first-to-fight basis. In some
cases, that means that reserve units get equipment modernization
before some active units'' if the reserves are slated to go into
battle before the regular units.
   ``Of those divisions stationed in the United States slated for
deployment overseas, all of them have some kind of reserve compoent
round-out,'' said Chapla, explaining that one brigade, or about
one-third of the maneuver units in those divisions, consists of
reserves.
   Of the divisions that would be mobilized quickly in the event of
war, he said, the following front-line divisions have reserve
components: First Cavalry, Fourth Infantry, Fifth Infantry, Ninth
Infantry and 10th Mountain.

<HEAD>Banker: Extradition to Greece Means Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A fugitive Greek tycoon accused in a banking
scandal that has rattled his Socialist government said Monday he
faces death at the hands of terrorist squads or secret police if he
is forced to return to his homeland.
   George Koskotas, 35, a former chairman of the Bank of Crete,
filed papers in U.S. District Court seeking to be released on bail
and fighting extradition to Greece, charging that senior officials
of the Greek government authorized plans to embezzle millions from
the bank and would kill him to ensure his silence.
   The $200 million scandal has embarrassed Greek Prime Minister
Andreas Papandreou's government, prompting the conservative
opposition to file a censure motion that was narrowly defeated in
Parliament.
   ``As the `Koskotas Affair' began to unfold in Greece last
October, Mr. Koskotas was given strong reason to believe that he
would be killed before he could give testimony incriminating the
(Greek) government and its leaders, including, in particular, Prime
Minister Papandreou,'' the petition said.
   A spokeswoman for the Greek Consulate in Boston declined to
comment on Koskotas' charges.
   Koskotas is being held without bail at a Salem jail pending the
extradition process.
   ``I am the one individual in the United States most
knowledgeable about the improper political motivations that the
PASOK government of Greece has in bringing charges against me and
in seeking my extradition,'' he said in court papers.
   Koskotas said he fled Greece for Brazil last November, ``because
I was informed that I would be killed either by terrorists or by
PASOK agents desiring my silence.''
   He left Brazil, he said, for the United States shortly after
that because he learned Greek secret police were dispatched to
Brazil with orders to kill him.
   Federal prosecutors say the reciprocal nature of international
extradition treaties demand cooperation despite the political
ramifications.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Victor Wild said Monday prosecutors
received the proceedings and will review them.
   ``We will be opposing his various motions,'' Wild said.
   A conference was scheduled May 17 before U.S. Magistrate Joyce
Alexander to discuss the extradition proceedings, he said.
   Papandreou, who is up for election in June, filed a libel
lawsuit against Time magazine last month over an article involving
allegations of financial wrongdoing at the bank that quoted
Koskotas saying he had passed millions from the Bank of Crete to
Papandreou and other government officials.
   Koskotas was arrested by FBI agents in Bedford last November
when he landed in a private jet with his wife and five children. He
fled Greece shortly before he was to face charges of forgery and
embezzlement.
   Meanwhile, the Bank of Crete has brought a civil lawsuit against
Koskotas seeking more than $100 million.

   Temperatures dropped to record lows Monday as far south as
Florida following a weekend of storms that killed 23 people and a
very unusual May snowstorm that dumped 10 inches of snow at
Rochester, N.Y.
   Temperatures as low as the 20s in South Carolina prompted worry
about crops.
   ``We've never had frost in May before,'' said Johnny Nobles of
the Soil Conservation Service in Bamberg. ``We do not know what
effect it will have. I've never seen it happen this time of year,
so I can't tell you.''
   South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell declared a state of
emergency Monday in Spartanburg and Cherokee counties, hard-hit by
tornadoes.
   Since Thursday, thunderstorms, tornadoes and floods have been
blamed for seven deaths in Texas, five in Virginia, five in North
Carolina, three in Louisiana, two in South Carolina and one in
Oklahoma. More than 100 people were injured.
   Low-temperature records were broken or tied Monday in at least
21 cities, following record lows Sunday in more than 30 cities.
   Monday's records included 36 at Augusta, Ga.; 30 at Bristol,
Tenn.; 48 at Jacksonville, Fla.; and 42 at Tallahassee, Fla.
Asheville, N.C., had its lowest-ever May temperature, at 28 degrees.
   Light snow continued to fall Monday in parts of western New York
state, after breaking 80-year-old records for this time of year.
   Sunday's 10 inches at Rochester also was the largest single-day
snowfall ever for May and three times the highest total ever
recorded for the whole month, forecasters said. The previous high
in Rochester _ both for a single day and the month _ was 3.3 inches
on May 2, 1909. Until Sunday, Rochester's biggest snowfall this
year was 6 inches.
   But by Monday morning, the snow had just about disappeared.
   In Pittsburgh, Sunday's snow flurries, rain, and wind, and a
temperature of 38 degrees, took a toll on the second consecutive
Pittsburgh Marathon. Officials said 10 runners were taken to
hospitals for treatment and about 150 were treated at on-site
medical tents, most for hypothermia.
   In Ohio, a bus overturned and slid down an embankment in snow
and sleet near Sandusky on Saturday, injuring 16 people. In
Cincinnati, snow fell for the first time in May in nearly a century
as temperatures overnight dipped into the low 30s.
   Behind the cold weather, warm air surged into the central part
of the nation. Manhattan, Kan., climbed from a low of 30 degrees
Sunday morning to 88 in the afternoon. On Monday in Texas, Lubbock
hit a record high of 99 and Midland tied its record of 103.
   In North Carolina, hardest hit by Friday's thunderstorms and
tornadoes, claims for insured losses totaled an estimated $35
million Monday, acording to the Insurance News Service, which
represents 32 insurance companies serving North Carolina.
   Schools were closed Monday in Winston-Salem and Forsyth County
because some buildings had no power. Officials said it could be
several days before electricity is restored. About 20,000 people
remained without power in the Winston-Salem area Monday, half as
many as originally lost electricity.
   One man said he and his pickup apparently were sucked up inside
a tornado and then dropped several hundred feet away.
   ``I remember the truck lifting off the ground and I knew that
was it, I was gone,'' said Detective Sgt. Larke Plyler, 31, of the
Union County Sheriff's Department. ``I have no idea how far up. It
was jet black. And I don't know how high off the ground I was _ two
feet or 200 feet.''
   He credited his seat belt with keeping him inside the truck as
the windows burst. ``I was just being thrown around. I was still
conscious, and I could see I was in the air,'' he said.
   At first, Plyler said, the noise was extremely loud, but it grew
``deathly quiet'' once he was inside the tornado's eye. ``Then it
laid me back down on Airport Road about 125 yards from where it
first picked me up,'' he said.

   The pilot of an Air New Zealand jetliner
carrying 350 people swerved to avoid hitting a twin-engine plane
that was less than 500 feet away over the Pacific Ocean, officials
said Monday.
   ``It was close,'' said Gary Mucho, regional director for the
National Transportation Safety Board, which was leading the federal
investigation into the near-collision at 7,000 feet.
   One passenger and one crew member, both male, aboard the Boeing
747 airliner suffered minor arm injuries as a result of the
near-collision about 5:30 p.m. Sunday, said an Air New Zealand
spokesman.
   Air traffic controllers told the Air New Zealand crew that
another plane was near it, ``and the Air New Zealand crew took
evasive action by making a left evasive turn,'' Mucho said.
   ``The other aircraft came within less than 500 feet,'' he said,
pinpointing the incident about 20 miles offshore over the Pacific
Ocean.
   Air New Zealand Flight TE6 from Auckland to Los Angeles was
traveling at about 7,000 feet when it had to bank sharply to avoid
a plane believed to be a Cessna, said the airline spokesman, who
declined to be identified.
   The other plane, which wasn't under the direction of air traffic
controllers, swerved to the opposite side. It wasn't identified,
Mucho said. Federal Aviation Administration and NTSB officials
spoke with the crew of the jetliner and were supplied with the
plane's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder.
   On Aug. 31, 1986, a small plane and an Aeromexico jetliner
collided near Los Angeles International Airport, killing 82 people
in the air and on the ground.

   Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada of the
governing party and Hugo Banzer, a former military dictator,
claimed victory Monday in a close presidential race, and Congress
will choose the winner.
   Officials said the outcome of Sunday's presidential and
congressional elections were an endorsement of the government's
economic austerity program, which both Banzer and Sanchez de Lozada
supported.
   Since none of the nine presidential candidates got a majority,
the new Congress will convene Aug. 4 to elect Bolivia's 77th
president, who will inaugurated two days later for a four-year term.
   ``The tendencies are clear,'' Sanchez de Lozada told a news
conference Monday. ``I will be the next president of Bolivia, and
my primary goals will be social programs and economic stability.''
   Jaime Cespedes, a spokesman for Banzer, claimed victory for his
party and said: ``We will not accept the victory of Sanchez de
Lozada because the only victory acceptable is that of the electoral
court. There is evidence to indicate fraud and the annulment of
votes favorable to Banzer.''
   Foreign observers who visited voting places throughout the
country reported some problems that appeared to stem from the
ignorance of rural electoral officials, but said they found no
evidence of widespread fraud.
   U.S. Ambassador Robert Gelbard told journalists his office
monitored the vote in eight cities and found only minor
irregularities. He called it ``one of the most impressive Latin
American elections in contemporary times.''
   The electoral college is to present its final tally May 28.
   Bolivia's constitution requires Congress to choose the president
when no candidate gets a majority. The 27 seats in the Senate and
130 in the House of Deputies will be divided among the parties
according to the number of votes they received in each electoral
region.
   A projection by the private Bolivian Television Association said
Sanchez de Lozada's government party would gain four Senate seats
to 13 and Banzer's party would lose four, leaving it with five
members.
   It said Sanchez de Lozada would have 38 seats in the new Chamber
of Deputies, maintaining the current two-seat advantage over the 36
of Banzer's party.
   Eight other parties would share the rest of the seats.
   According to the Television Association's tally of 1,059,305
votes, an estimated 60 percent of those cast, Banzer and his
center-right Nationalist Democratic Action led with 284,028 votes,
or 26.8 percent, and Sanchez de Lozada of the conservative
Revolutionary Nationalist Movement was a close second with 279,385,
or 26.4 percent.
   Jaime Paz Zamora of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left was
third with 233,568 votes, or 22.1 percent, it said.
   The projection said Sanchez de Lozada probably would pull ahead
of Banzer by one or two percentage points when the vote came in
from rural areas, where early returns showed him with a solid lead.
That would put Sanchez de Lozada, 58, in a good position to win
congressional approval.
   Banzer, 62, seized power in 1971 and was forced out in 1978. He
said before the elections that all candidates should support the
one who won the most votes.
   Information Minister Herman Antelo told The Associated Press on
Monday: ``In the name of President Victor Paz Estenssoro, I would
like to express satisfaction for the form and results of the
election. Independently of who is the winner, more than two thirds
of the population has given its endorsement to the government's
economic policy and the need to continue with it.''
   The 81-year-old incumbent is retiring after a career that
spanned half a century and included three periods as president.
   Sanchez de Lozada, a wealthy mine owner, was educated in the
United States and has a philosophy degree from the University of
Chicago.
   Voting was calm and orderly in what once was the continent's
most politically volatile country. Since the turn of the century
there have been 13 coups, with nine governments between 1978 and
1982.
   Some irregularities were reported, including the arrest of three
people who carried several different identity cards and apparently
planned to vote several times. There also were reports that some
voters were given already marked ballots, but foreign observers
said they had no initial indications of widespread fraud.
   Paz Estenssoro said upon casting his ballot that the elections
would help lead Bolivians to political maturity. ``The important
thing is to consolidate democracy,'' he said.
   He launched a severe economic program when he took office in
1985 to halt economic chaos, including an annual inflation rate of
23,000 percent.
   Banzer, Sanchez de Lozada and Paz Zamora pledged to maintain the
program, which has cut inflation to 15 percent a year and
contributed to some small economic growth for the first time in a
decade.
   In addition, they all vowed to continue the government's battle
against cocaine production and trafficking. The United States
provides about $55 million a year for the efforts, which include
programs to reduce coca leaf cultivation in Bolivia's jungles.

   Contributors have whittled the $11 million
debt of the Oral Roberts Ministries down to $2.2 million, with the
rest expected to be raised by Wednesday, the son of the founder
said Monday.
   ``We haven't quite done it, but we're very close,'' Oral
Roberts' son and fellow evangelist, Richard, said on his daily
television show.
   Oral Roberts said March 28 that the $11 million was owed to
4,000 vendors and suppliers of the Oral Roberts Ministry, Oral
Roberts University and the City of Faith Medical Center. He said if
the money wasn't raised by May 6, graduation day at the university,
creditors could begin to dismantle the university and hospital.
   He said later the date was extended until Monday because May 6
was a Saturday. Monday, his son said on his TV show that creditors
were being asked for a three-day extension.
   Mark Swadener, the ministry's chief financial officer, issued a
statement saying that while all vendors have not been paid, ``we
have attempted to make some payment to virtually all of them since
April 1.''
   ``Our vendors generally do not view us in a bad light, but they
do want to be paid,'' the statement said.
   Attempts to reach Swadener for further comment were not
successful. Ministry workers repeatedly said he could not be
disturbed. Other ministry officials referred callers to Swadener's
office.
   One vendor, the company that provided medical personnel for the
hospital, filed a lawsuit last week seeking $17,032 in staffing
payments for the period from Dec. 16 through Feb. 3.
   Oral Roberts has blamed ``a spirit of skepticism'' from scandals
involving TV evangelists Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart for a
decline in monthly contributions from $5 million to $2.7 million
over the past two years.
   It was two years ago that the elder Roberts made his
controversial announcement that he needed $8 million for his
medical school or God would end his life.
   Both Roberts and his son have made pleas for money on their
television shows since March 28. They also staged a four-hour,
prime-time telethon.
   Some cost-cutting moves have been initiated by the ministry.
Roberts announced last week that the 4,000-student university is
dropping out of NCAA competition to save $500,000 to $1 million a
year. In addition, some television commitments also are being
curtailed.

<HEAD>Mixed Reviews For Bennett's Anti-Drug Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal drug czar William Bennett's suggestion
that first-time drug offenders be sent to boot-camp style prisons
drew mixed reviews Monday from correctional experts.
   Prison experts said submitting offenders to rigorous programs of
military-style discipline and rigorous physical exercise might
teach self-control and discipline.
   But they disputed Bennett's assertion that such programs, aleady
being operated in Mississippi, Georgia, New York and several other
states, necessarily reduce the number of repeat offenders.
   Bennett's idea, however, drew support from one influential
member of Congress.
   ``I support the concept very strongly,'' said Rep. William
Hughes, D-N.J., chairman of the House criminal justice subcomittee.
``I don't think there is any question but that we've always
intended to develop alternatives.''
   Hallem Williams, head of the District of Columbia's corrections
department, said city officials have studied the idea and ``we
would not be averse to this as an option in the overall scheme of
things.''
   On the CBS News show ``Face the Nation,'' Bennett said Sunday he
was studying a proposal to encourage more states to set up ``boot
camp'' prisons for drug offenders as a cheaper, more effective
alternative to incarceration.
   ``It's inexpensive, it teaches good lessons and the recividivism
rate is very, very low because it so grueling and so unpleasant
people don't want to back to it,'' Bennett said.
   Jerry Miller, who heads the National Center for Institutions and
Alternatives in Alexandria, Va., questioned the research cited by
Bennett.
   ``There is almost no controlled research that shows they work,''
said Miller, who formerly ran youth corrections programs in
Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.
   While programs in Georgia and Mississippi programs claim high
success rates, ``they will put through such lightweight offenders
they generally tend not to be repeat offenders anyway,'' Miller
said.
   His comments were echoed by criminologist James Finckenauer of
Rutgers University in Newark, N.J., who said there isn't ``any
empirical evidence to support that it actually does what people
think it's going to do.''
   ``I would suspect if one looked at recidivism rates you are not
going to find any differences,'' Finckenauer said.
   In fact, the New York State Department of Correctional Services
says the recidivism rate among inmates who successfully complete
its boot-camp program is not any lower than among inmates who spend
two or three years in prison.
   But department spokesman James Flateau said that ``to the extent
you can compress a program into six months and be that successful
makes it a very successful program.''
   New York operates three camps that hold a total of 570 inmates
who are freed from the state prison system if they successfully
complete the six-month program, Flateau said.
   To qualify, an inmate must be serving a prison term of less than
three years for a non-violent crime, he said.
   ``Ours is definitely not a boot camp,'' said Flateau. ``Boot
camp by definition is a place of rigorous physical activity.''
   Besides physical activity ``there is an equal emphasis on
mandatory academic education and mandatory individual counseling
and group therapy for people with drug problems,'' Flateau said.
   ``You must complete all phases of it,'' he said.
   The legislature is considering a proposal to build more camps
and to extend the program to other inmates.
   Robert Gangi, director of the Correctional Association of New
York, gave the program high marks.
   ``The concept is good, but the key thing is to have the staff
dedication to make sure it works so that it doesn't become another
gimmick.''
   ``The key thing is that everybody in the progam, from the top
staff on down, is committed to rehabilitating the inmates,'' he
said ``That is not true of every other prison I have been into.
Most prisons see themselves as more or less warehousing people
until the time they are to be released.''

<TEXT>
   New details about the Navy's 1965 loss of a
hydrogen bomb in the Pacific show that the errant weapon was much
closer to a heavily populated Japanese island than the military has
acknowledged, a research analyst said Monday.
   The analyst, William Arkin, said the evidence showed that U.S.
ships ignored Japan's ban on nuclear weapons during the Vietnam War
era, and he said he will publish evidence that the Navy continues
to carry nuclear weapons on ships in allied ports. The Navy
declined comment.
   Arkin and an associate, Joshua Handler of Greenpeace, said their
research had established that many other nuclear devices have been
lost in the sea _ 48 nuclear warheads and 11 reactors, ``the
majority of them Soviet.''
   He said there was little danger of detonation from the
one-megaton bomb, which has a force of 1 million tons of TNT,
although he said the materials do threaten the environment as they
deteriorate over time.
   The Navy acknowledged the 1965 accident more than 15 years after
it occurred but revealed few details such as which ship was
involved, where it was destined and where it was bound. It did
concede in 1986 that the incident was classified as among its two
most serious nuclear accidents.
   The new evidence shows the accident occurred aboard an aircraft
carrier that was steaming past Okinawa and bound for the Japanese
port of Yokosuka after war duty off the Vietnam coast.
   In 1981, the Navy revealed that the mishap occurred on Dec. 5,
1965; involved an A-4 attack jet loaded with one nuclear bomb and
took place ``more than 500 miles from land ... at sea in the
Pacific.''
   The Navy said the jet ``rolled off the elevator of a U.S.
aircraft carrier and fell into the sea'' and that the pilot, plane
and bomb were all lost.
   
   Arkin said recently declassified documents reveal the incident
occurred aboard the USS Ticonderoga bound for Japan after a
deployment off Vietnam, and that the bomb was a one megaton B-43
hydrogen device. It was lost in international waters about 80 miles
from the closest point of the Okinawa island chain and only about
200 miles east of the heavily populated island of Okinawa Arkin
said.
   
   ``This accident occurred 500 miles from land alright, but the
Navy forgot that Japan was between the ship and China,'' said
Arkin, an expert on nuclear matters with the Institute for Policy
Studies, a liberal think tank.
   A newly declassified memo described the strategic mission of the
Ticonderoga at the time of the accident as including ``the
capability to launch a nuclear strike when and where directed by
the president.'' The A-4 was the Navy's main deep-strike aircraft
at the time, and an undisclosed number on each U.S. carrier would
always be equipped with the B-43 hydrogen bomb, Arkin said.
   Japan bans nuclear weapons. It says U.S. ships or planes cannot
bring nuclear arms into Japan without prior consultations with the
government, and there have been no such consultations. The United
States refuses to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons
in specific locations.
   Arkin, who is about to publish a study on serious naval
accidents around the world along with the environmental group
Greenpeace, said the mishap demonstrates ``that nuclear weapons
were carried on aircraft carriers during the Vietnam War, something
that no U.S. administration has ever admitted.''
   He said he assumed that U.S. ships still carry nuclear weapons
in Japanese waters, although he provided no details. He told a news
conference that he would issue a report next year providing
evidence that U.S. ships regularly carry nuclear weapons into
allied ports, including those in Japan.
   The Navy declined comment on Arkin's findings, beyond repeating
its standard policy of never confirming nor denying the presence of
nuclear weapons on its ships.
   Japan, the only nation ever attacked with nuclear weapons,
remains very sensitive about nuclear arms questions. The report was
prominently featured in Japanese newspapers and on television.
Leaders of anti-war and anti-nuclear groups and opponents of the
U.S. military presence on Okinawa immediately issued denunciations.
   At the time of the accident, Okinawa was under U.S. control. It
was returned to Japan in 1972, 27 years after Japan's defeat in
World War II.
   Besides its 1981 admission of the accident, the Navy hasn't
commented on the mishap beyond a January 1986 report describing it
as one of only two so-called ``Broken Arrow'' accidents ever
experienced. Broken Arrow is the code name for the most serious
nuclear accident. The other Broken Arrow was the 1968 loss of the
submarine Scorpion in the Atlantic.
   ``The Navy kept the true details of this accident a secret not
only because it demonstrates their disregard for the treaty
stipulations of foreign governments, but because of the questions
it raises about nuclear weapons aboard ships in Vietnam,'' Arkin
said.
   Arkin asserted that the United States sidesteps the Japanese ban
by arguing that a temporary transit or port call by a ship does not
amount to the ``introduction'' of nuclear weapons and thus
consultations are unnecessary.
   The researcher said there was probably little danger of the lost
bomb exploding.
   ``But we do think there is a threat to the environment,'' he
added. ``Over time, the pressure, water circulation and corrosion
are likely to lead to the release of radioactivity.''
   The estimate of the number of other lost nuclear devices is
contained in Arkin's study, ``Neptune Papers 3,'' describing naval
accidents from the end of World War II through last year. Arkin
said that 48 nuclear warheads and 11 reactors, most of them Soviet,
were ``sitting on the bottom of the ocean.'' The figure includes
two reactors aboard the Soviet Mike class submarine that sank last
month in the Norwegian Sea.

<HEAD>Relative Remembers Life With Trumans On Harry's Birthday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Harry and Bess Truman's white Victorian
house still stands, dish cloths still in the kitchen sink, his
beige trenchcoat and tan hat still hanging by the back door.
   And the 33rd president's sister-in-law remembers them and still
plays bridge as she did with Mrs. Truman.
   May Wallace, 94, moved to the house behind the Truman home with
her husband, George Wallace, in 1916. She remembers her trips to
Washington, time spent with Truman's daughter, Margaret, and the
president's honest nature.
   Mrs. Wallace recalled life with the Trumans in a recent
interview, before the annual observance marking Truman's birth on
May 8, 1884.
   Mrs. Wallace said Mrs. Truman, her husband's sister, was a
``cordial, good, sweet woman.''
   ``If somebody came along and tried to kid her, she wasn't in for
something like that,'' Mrs. Wallace said. ``She might wish you
weren't there but you wouldn't know it,''
   After the Trumans lived at the White House nearly a year, Mrs.
Truman invited 10 members of the Tuesday Bridge Club from
Independence to Washington. At the time, Life magazine reported
that the club's real business was to ``exchange menus, gossip, talk
about children, fashions, and husbands.''
   Mrs. Wallace isn't sure if she is the last remaining member of
the original bridge club, started by the president's wife when she
was a teen-ager.
   A White House employee once said Mrs. Truman would make more of
a fuss over her bridge club than she would over the social queens
of Washington.
   When the president's daughter, Margaret, was a child, she would
often come to the Wallace house for pre-dinner dessert. Aunt May
``Beufie'' and Uncle George ``Da'' would give her ice cream and by
dinnertime young Margaret's appetite was gone.
   When Margaret was older, the Wallaces took her to movies. ``The
Trumans didn't like to go out at night so Margaret used to sneak
out of the house,'' she said.
   The extended family converged on the Truman house at Christmas.
   ``One of my fondest memories of the `Big House' is the way the
big living room looked on Christmas morning,'' Mrs. Wallace said in
a handwritten statement for the National Park Service, which cares
for the Truman house. ``Margaret always insisted that the Christmas
tree be tall enough to reach the ceiling _ a 9-foot one at that.
   ``The tree trimming took place on Christmas Eve when all
gathered to help. Actually, my husband, George, and Margaret did
the real trimming with much comment from the sidelines.''
   Truman was thrust into the public spotlight in 1944 when he was
elected vice president. Just five months later, President Franklin
Roosevelt died and Truman became president.
   Mrs. Wallace said it was a difficult time for the Trumans, who
resisted attempts by the press and curiosity-seekers to invade
their privacy.
   ``It was hard to live. You had to be so careful about what you
say all the time,'' she said.

<HEAD>Safety Tests Started In England On Third AIDS Vaccine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Safety tests on a candidate AIDS vaccine will
begin soon in England, an American researcher announced Monday.
   Allan Goldstein, an AIDS researcher at the George Washington
University School of Medicine, said 24 volunteers are being sought
in London to test the safety of a vaccine known as HGP-30.
   The volunteers, he said, must be free of any AIDS infection. A
second 24, to be used as a control group, also will be selected.
   Goldstein said the purpose of the year-long trial is to
determine if the candidate vaccine is safe to use on humans.
Earlier tests on laboratory animals did not reveal any problems of
toxicity or other adverse effects, he said.
   Control trials in the United States have not started, Goldstein
said, because the drug has not been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for human experimentation.
   HGP-30 is a synthetic copy of a protein that is part of the
internal structure of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which
causes AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   In laboratory tests, Goldstein said HGP-30 has been shown to
stimulate the production of antibodies which attack and kill both
the AIDS virus and cells in the body that are infected with the
AIDS virus.
   Two other vaccines, developed by other researchers, are also in
early safety trials, according to an FDA spokesman.
   The main advantage to the HGP-30 vaccine, said Goldstein, is
that the protein copy is based on a region of the HIV, called p17,
that does not change. The other vaccines are been based on proteins
in the envelope of the virus, a region that tends to change in a
process called ``genetic drift.'' Because of this change, vaccines
based on stimulating antibodies against the viral envelope may not
be as effective as HGP-30, he said.
   Developing the HGP-30 vaccine is still at a very early stage.
Goldstein said it will be at least a year before the start of any
clinical trials testing how well the vaccine actually prevents
AIDS. Those trials, he said, could last for years.
   Goldstein said it will be ``at least'' five to six years before
any AIDS vaccine is ready for general use and it could be much
longer.

<TEXT>
   The McDonnell Douglas Corp. easily retained
its position as the Pentagon's top research contractor last year,
winning awards totaling almost $2.9 billion, the Defense Department
said Monday.
   The Martin Marietta Corp. ranked second for the second year in a
row with contracts totaling $2.03 billion, the Pentagon added.
   Among educational and non-profit entities, the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology continued to hold down the top ranking,
winning research contracts during the year worth $403.7 million.
The Aerospace Corp. of El Segundo, Calif., was close behind with
contracts worth $367 million, followed by the Johns Hopkins
University with $353.9 million.
   Overall, the Pentagon increased its spending on research by just
over 3 percent in fiscal 1988, with awards worth a total of $22.5
billion. By contrast, the department spent $21.8 billion on
research in fiscal 1987.
   A great deal of last year's spending appeared to be related to
work on the ``Star Wars'' anti-missile defense system. The amount
of money invested in research on ``missile and space systems''
totaled $7.8 billion in fiscal 1988, or 34.6 percent of the total,
the Pentagon said.
   Those numbers were little changed from fiscal 1987, when missile
and space systems research consumed $7.9 billion.
   The second-ranked program category was research on aircraft. It
consumed 22.4 percent of the total, or about $5.1 billion.
   The latest figures are contained in a statistical report
prepared annually by the Pentagon to rank the top 500 companies or
non-profit groups performing ``research, development, test and
evaluation'' work. The rankings are based on a review of all
contracts totaling $25,000 or more awarded during the fiscal year
that ended last Sept. 30.
   McDonnell Douglas, which earlier this year also claimed the
overall ranking as the nation's largest defense contractor, had
climbed into the top spot for research work in fiscal 1987 when it
displaced the Lockheed Corp.
   It widened its lead in fiscal 1988, with two of its units
ranking in the Top 10 on their own. McDonnell Douglas Aircraft held
down first place with $2.16 billion, while the parent McDonnell
Douglas Corp. received other contracts worth $664 million and
ranked in 8th place.
   Other McDonnell Douglas subsidiaries received $57 million in
research contracts, giving the entire corporation its total of
$2.88 billion.
   After McDonnell Douglas Aircraft and Martin Marietta, the
remainder of the Top 10 included the Boeing Co. in 3rd place with
awards totaling $878.7 million; Grumman Aerospace Corp., $843.4
million; Raytheon Co., $840.9 million; Rockwell International
Corp., $737.7 million; General Electric Co., $710.2 million;
McDonnell Douglas Corp., $664 million; TRW Inc., $658.7 million,
and Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co., $611.2 million.
   While Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co. ranked 10th, other Lockheed
units received awards worth $134.5 million, giving that entire
corporation a grand total of $745.7 million in fiscal 1988.
   The $403.7 million in research contracts won by MIT was enough
to give it the 15th ranking overall. In fiscal 1987, MIT had won
contracts worth $407.6 million and was ranked 11th overall.
   All told, the top 500 concerns accounted for 97 percent of the
total research contracts awarded, or $21.9 billion. The top 500
included 377 business firms; 103 educational and non-profit
organizations; three U.S. government agencies, and 17 foreign
contractors.
   That breakdown was little changed from fiscal 1987.
   The research awards to foreign concerns totaled $129 million, a
small increase compared to the $114.3 million reported in fiscal
1987. The leading foreign contractor was West Germany's
Messerschmitt-Boelkow Blohm, with awards totaling $27.2 million.

<HEAD>Passengers May Sue Eastern For Mental Distress From '83 Flight</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: RETRANSMITTING a0675 to fix category code.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Passengers on a 1983 Eastern Airlines flight
forced to make an emergency landing after all three of the jet's
engines failed, have a right to sue for emotional injury, a federal
appeals court ruled.
   A lower court judge had ruled that Florida and federal laws did
not provide an avenue for the 25 plaintiffs to make a case. But the
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the Warsaw Convention, an
international treaty drafted in 1929 that governs airline
liability, provides for such cases.
   The 11th Circuit, however, said the passengers may not seek
punitive damages.
   The case involves Eastern flight 855, which left Miami for
Nassau, Bahamas, on May 5, 1983. During the flight, one of the
plane's engines lost oil pressure. The crew shut it down and headed
back to Miami.
   During its return, the jet's other two engines failed and the
plane began to lose altitude. The crew told the passengers they
would have to ditch the plane in the Atlantic Ocean, the court said.
   The crew managed to restart one of the engines, and the plane
landed safely at Miami International Airport, court records show.
   Twenty-five of the passengers sued, contending they suffered
mental distress from the incident. Two of the passengers also
claimed physical injury.
   The Warsaw Convention sets terms under which passengers can seek
damages for problems related to air travel. It was accepted by the
United States in 1934. The original liability limit of $8,300 has
been amended several times to the current $75,000 per person.
   In its decision, made Friday but not released until Monday, the
11th Circuit said the Warsaw Convention takes precedence over local
laws.
   There has been considerable legal debate over whether the
language of the original document, drafted in French, provided
compensation for mental and emotional injury, the court said.
   The 11th Circuit concluded it did, saying it talked about
``personal injury'' rather than ``bodily injury.''

   A handyman was convicted of felony
murder Monday for the death of an elderly woman who suffered a
fatal heart attack while being raped on Christmas night 1987.
   Jeffrey Washington faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison,
and could be sentenced to life without parole because the jury
found the case involved aggravating circumstances, said Thomas
Connell, spokesman for the attorney general's office.
   The day after the attack, relatives found Alice Carcieri, 73,
whose legs had been amputated several years ago, dead in her bed.
Her wrists had been tied to the bed.
   Washington, 33, who sometimes did chores for Miss Carcieri, was
arrested four days later and confessed to police.

   British rock singer Sting met Monday with
King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia in his campaign to create a nature
reserve in the Amazon River basin.
   Sting led a delegation that included Brazilian Indian chief
Raoni and American Indian Sioux tribal leader Red Crow. The group
was midway through a 14-nation, 28-day tour to publicize the
campaign.
   Sting told a Spanish television network an Amazon nature reserve
would be a first step to curb the destruction of the rain forest
that generates a significant part of the world's oxygen.
   He denied news reports the group wanted to link any conservation
action by Brazil to concessions by Western creditor nations on
repayment of Brazil's $115 billion foreign debt.
   ``You can't trade debt for jungle. We are not giving money to
the Brazilian government. We're cooperating with the agency that
deals with the Indians _ buying boats, blankets, a plane,'' he told
the network TV-3.
   The group began its tour last month in Paris and plans to travel
to the United States, Japan and Australia.

<HEAD>U.S. to Pay Severance to Spanish as Base Closes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States, which agreed to Spanish
demands to remove 72 F-16 fighter bombers from Spain by 1992, will
pay severance to about 700 Spanish employees who worked at the
fleet's air base.
   Lt. Gen. E.S. Leland Jr., chief of staff of the U.S. European
Command, said Monday that under an agreement the State Department
negotiated with Spain, the United States will pay severance that
``at the very most'' could total $12 million.
   In light of Spain's pressure on the United States to remove the
jets and 3,600 U.S. troops and 600 civilians attached to the unit,
Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Subcommittee on Readiness, Sustainability and Support, said he
wouldn't blame Americans for feeling like fools in the deal.
   Leland said that at the time, the U.S. officials who negotiated
the agreement thought it was to the Americans' advantage. He also
reminded Dixon that there was a good chance the severance cost
would be less because the Spanish government will try to find other
jobs for the workers.
   In January 1988, the United States accepted Spain's demands that
the U.S. Air Force withdraw its 401st Tactical Wing from the joint
U.S.-Spanish air base at Torrejon de Ardoz, just east of Madrid.
   Italy has agreed to provide a new home base for the jets, troops
and civilians at Crotone.
   The cost of moving the 401st from Spain to Italy is estimated at
$830 million, with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization paying a
large share of the cost, said Cmdr. Mel Sundin, a Pentagon
spokesman. The United States is expected to pay about 28 percent of
the cost.
   Dixon questioned whether the United States could have saved
money by returning the jets and troops home. ``It looks to me like
a missed opportunity,'' the Illinois senator said.
   But Leland said NATO favored keeping the tactical wing in Europe.

   People slipped out of bomb shelters
Monday to get food and water during a lull in the fierce artillery
war, but Christian and Moslem gunners resumed shelling, killing at
least 16 people and wounding 53.
   The third day of fighting since a cease-fire collapsed raised
casualties in the two-month battle to 316 dead and 1,184 injured.
   Arab League envoys prepared to fly back to Damascus, Syria, and
Beirut to try to obtain compliance with the cease-fire called 11
days ago in the latest round of Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   Police said 25,000 shells and rockets hit Beirut's Moslem and
Christian sectors from dusk Saturday to dawn Monday, then resumed
after a brief lull. The fighting escalated at dusk Monday.
   Shells blew gaping holes in scores of apartment buildings on
both sides of Beirut's sectarian dividing line. Hundreds of
burned-out cars smoldered in streets covered with debris.
   Shopkeepers banged down their shutters when the shooting started
and motorists sped away, blaring their horns at pedestrians
scurrying for cover. Police said streets emptied in less than 15
minutes.
   ``They've destroyed everything I own! I hope they roast in hell,
all of them!'' said Mahmoud Younis, 30, staring at his gutted
electrical shop in the Mosseitbeh district of Moslem west Beirut.
   Police said gunners of the Syrian army and allied Druse militia
pounded the coast around the ports of Jounieh and Byblos, blocking
the only escape routes for a million people who live in the
besieged Christian enclave north and east of Beirut.
   Christian gunners struck back with barrages of 155mm howitzer
fire aimed at seaside Moslem districts in Beirut and at the
airport, which was closed soon after the fighting began March 8.
Police said the Syrian fire came from those points.
   Lakhdar Ibrahimi, assistant secretary-general of the Arab
League, was expected in Damascus and then Beirut in an attempt to
salvage the truce called by the league April 28.
   He is accompanied by Brig. Gen. Ali Momen, the Kuwaiti commander
of a 321-man observer force to be drawn from six Arab nations to
monitor a cease-fire.
   An Arab League mediation panel made three earlier calls for
truces, but league official say this one is different because of
the provision for monitoring.
   Shells were fired only sporadically during a lull that settled
over the city at dawn Monday, but the pace quicked again before
noon, catching people in search of supplies. Shells and rockets
rained down on the city and resort towns in the mountains above
Beirut.
   One shell hit the building that houses the west Beirut office of
the British news agency Reuters. The staff reported extensive
damage but no injuries.
   Another crashed into the newsroom on the second floor of the
seven-story state TV station in the Tallet Khayyat district of West
Beirut.
   ``It was a miracle no one was hurt,'' said Leena Saidi, an
English-language announcer. ``We're now operating from the
station's bunker.''
   Several salvos exploded around the seven-story building that
contains offices of The Associated Press and the NBC and CBS
television networks in west Beirut's Hamra commercial district.
People in the offices fell to the floor and then crawled uninjured
into back rooms for shelter.
   The battle pits Gen. Michel Aoun and his 20,000 Christian army
troopers against an alliance of the Syrians and Druse militiamen
led by Walid Jumblatt. Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under a
1976 peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League and has become the
country's main power broker.
   Fighting began two days after Aoun's forces blockaded illegal
harbors run by Moslem militias south of Beirut, which deprive
government ports of an estimated $100 million a year in customs
revenue.
   Jumblatt's men began shelling the 310-square-mile Christian
enclave. The Syrians soon joined them and sealed off the area with
the aid of Maj. Gen. Sami Khatib, who commands the 22,000 Moslem
army soldiers.
   Aoun declared a ``war of liberation to drive out the Syrian
occupation army.''
   Lebanon has had competing Christian and Moslem governments since
September, when the six-year term of President Amin Gemayel ended
and Parliament could not agree on a successor.
   He appointed Aoun and Moslems swore allegiance to Premier Salim
Hoss, who had served under Gemayel. A split in the army command
followed.
   Under an unwritten agreement since independendence from France
in 1943, Lebanon's president is Christian, the premier Sunni Moslem
and the parliament speaker Shiite Moslem.

   Britain urged Monday that a world
conference be convened to chart ways to combat global warming, and
said the Security Council should monitor environmental trends that
could threaten world peace.
   The proposal would expand the council's peacekeeping
responsibilities dramatically.
   Sir Crispin Tickell, Britain's U.N. ambassador, announced
London's new approach in a speech before the U.N. Economic and
Social Council.
   ``The atmosphere knows no boundaries, and the winds carry no
passports,'' he said.
   ``Just as member states of the United Nations came together to
take action on damage to the ozone layer, so we now need to come
together to see how to cope with the wider problem of likely global
warming.''
   Scientists believe global warming is caused by an increase in
the ``greenhouse effect,'' when gases in the earth's atmosphere
trap radiant heat near the planet's surface. In addition to natural
buildup, scientists say the gases have increased greatly because of
burning coal, oil, and gas, and destruction of tropical rain
forests.
   The ambassador said global warming and climate change could
undermine world peace as fertile nations are beset by droughts;
coastal cities are inundated by rising oceans; and storms,
hurricanes and floods strike with greater frequency and intensity.
   Tickell said the international conference should proceed
cautiously, avoiding utopian pronouncements or demands for
immediate and obligatory changes in energy use patterns.
   ``In working out guidelines, we would try to look at measures to
dissuade governments from taking actions that have a bad effect on
somebody else,'' such as manipulating rainfall, river flows or
ocean currents, said Tickell.
   ``We can look into the ways that energy could be better
conserved; again, you could look at guidelines which would try to
dissuade people from using certain sorts of fuel; for example, coal
and oil produce far more carbon dioxide than natural gas, and that
produces a bit more than nuclear energy,'' he said.
   ``So there are a whole variety of subjects in which the world is
not ready for a formal treaty, but you can perhaps work out and
point in certain directions in these guidelines which would help
nations to understand the nature of the problem and what is to be
done about it.''
   He said the framework for an international convention already
exists in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a year-old
body with three study committees chaired by the United States,
Soviet Union and Britain.
   The Security Council could monitor progress toward dealing with
the effects of global warming under Article 34 of the U.N. Charter,
said Tickell.
   The article allows the council to look into ``any dispute or any
situation which might lead to international friction or give rise
to a dispute.''
   ``In the past, wars have been about productive land, they have
been about the supply of fresh water and they have been about the
movements of people. Now all of those could be very directly and
disagreeably affected by climactic change,'' Tickell said.
   Tickell is a key adviser on environmental affairs to Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher and is author of a book on the effects
of climactic change on international relations.

<HEAD>Britain Warns Nationals to Leave Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Foreign Office warned Britons Monday to leave
Iran because an Iranian official urged Palestinians to kill
Westerners to retaliate for Arab deaths in the Israeli-occupied
lands.
   The European Economic Community and the Netherlands on Monday
joined other Western nations that have already condemned the
Iranian statements. Those countries include Britain, the United
States, France and Israel.
   Iran's parliamentary speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani, said Friday
that planes should be hijacked and five Britons, Americans or
Frenchmen killed for every Palestinian killed by Israel.
   The British Foreign Office said, ``We hold the Iranians directly
responsible for any actions taken against British or any other
nationals as a result of these remarks.''
   It said with the British Embassy in Tehran closed, it could
offer only ``extremely limited'' consular protection to its
citizens in Iran.
   It advised Britons to ``consider carefully whether their
continuing presence in Iran is essential.'' It also recommended
that Britons outside Iran not travel there.
   The Foreign Office said its warning was directed at 150 British
wives of Iranians living in Iran and 12 other British nationals
known to be there.
   In Madrid, the Spanish Foreign Office issued a statement for the
12-member EEC calling Rafsanjani's appeal ``absolutely
unacceptable.''
   The Dutch government called his remarks ``totally
reprehensible'' and urged joint EEC action. However, it announced
no concrete proposals.
   Earlier this year, the EEC nations recalled their ambassadors
from Tehran to protest Iran's call for the death of British
novelist Salman Rushdie. Many Moslems view his novel ``The Satanic
Verses'' as blasphemous.
   Most of the ambassadors, including the Dutch envoy, have since
returned to Iran.
   Both the EEC and the Dutch government applauded officials of the
Palestine Liberation Organization for joining in Western protests
of Iran's call for the campaign of terrorism.
   PLO-allied underground leaders in the occupied lands have
orchestrated many of the protests that led to Palestinian deaths.

   Troops sealed the occupied lands Monday to
reduce the risk of violence in Israel during two national holidays,
and Jews angered by the killing of a soldier stoned Arab-owned cars.
   In Kiryat Malachi, police detained three teen-age Jews who threw
a firebomb at an Arab vehicle, Israel radio reported. It said the
device exploded on the road, causing no injuries or damage.
   Arab reports from the Gaza Strip said army gunfire wounded 11
Palestinians and soldiers injured three children with rubber
bullets, including an 11-year-old shot in the left eye. In the West
Bank, two Palestinians were reported wounded.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told Memorial Day ceremony Monday
night: ``Arab terrorism has reached new heights of violence and
murderousness against the Israeli people.''
   He accused leaders of the Palestinian uprising of escalating
violence to sabotage his election proposal for the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip. The uprising is entering its 18th month.
   Shamir wants Palestinians elected in the occupied lands to
negotiate a temporary peace settlement. The Palestine Liberation
Organization says elections only can be held after Israel withdraws
and as part of a comprehensive peace plan.
   The army clamped an indefinite curfew on 700,000 Palestinians in
Gaza Strip and barred 1 million West Bank residents from entering
Israel until Wednesday night. The restrictions were imposed to keep
Palestinians out during Israel's Memorial and Independence Day
holidays.
   Between sunset Monday and Tuesday, Israelis remember the 16,740
soldiers killed in wars with its Arab enemies. Celebrations marking
the 41st anniversary of Israel's independence begin sundown Tuesday
and end at sundown Wednesday.
   Earlier Monday, dozens of Israelis stoned Arab-owned cars along
the main coastal highway to protest the slaying of Avi Sassportaz,
a 21-year-old soldier whose body was discovered Sunday buried in a
field near the Gaza Strip.
   Before Sassportaz's funeral Monday, police fired tear gas to
disperse hundreds of residents from the soldier's hometown, Ashdod,
who burned tires in the streets and screamed: ``Death to the
Arabs!'' and ``No more Arabs in Israel!''
   Police arrested protesters from three vans, but stone-throwing
riots continued into the night, at one point involving hundreds of
residents, Israel Television said.
   Police warned against planned Tuesday protests.
   ``We will not permit any disturbances. We shall have forces that
will allow us to respond immediately and efficiently,'' said local
police commander Tuvia Golan.
   Thousands attended the funeral, including Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin and Maj. Gen. Dan Shomron, the chief of staff.
Journalists were barred by the family.
   In northern Israel, hundreds of Israeli Arab vacationers
abruptly left resort towns when the news spread that Sassportaz'
body had been discovered, a senior police commander said.
   The soldier disappeared Feb. 16 while hitchhiking home from his
army base. On Monday, more than 1,400 troops searched for a second
missing soldier, Ilan Saadon, 18, who last was seen Wednesday
hitching a ride in southern Israel.
   Police say they suspect Palestinians were involved in both cases.
   ``We are losing our patience,'' Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, army
commander of the Gaza Strip, was quoted as saying by Hadashot
newspaper. ``We will take a heavier hand so they won't reach a
situation of making our lives intolerable.''
   In an editorial, Hadashot wrote: ``We are nearing the hour when
a society that feels itself threatened will choose its security
first, as in, `He who rises to kill you, kill him first.' We appeal
to the Palestinians, `Don't drag us to this moment.'''

   A bomb believed set off by
Basque separatists exploded Monday night in the path of a bus
carrying police to prison guard duty, killing two officers and
wounding two, officials said.
   The explosion occurred at a crossroads leading to the
Alcala-Meco maximum security prison about 20 miles east of Madrid,
where a number of convicted Basque terrorists are held, said a
spokesman for the Madrid province civil governor's office.
   The spokesman said on condition of anonymity that police put up
roadblocks and were hunting for people seen fleeing the blast site
in an automobile.
   It was not immediately known whether a car bomb or some other
kind of device caused the explosion.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility, but police said the
blast bore the earmarks of ETA, the Basque organization that has
killed more than 600 people in a 21-year campaign to gain
independence for the three-province northern Spanish Basque country.
   ETA is an acronym standing for homeland and liberty in the
Basque language.
   On April 4, ETA called off its moratorium on attacks against
government targets after talks broke down between the ETA and the
Spanish government in Algiers.
   Since then, ETA claimed responsibility for the shooting death
April 12 of a paramilitary Civil Guard officer and of an army
lieutenant April 25.

<HEAD>Solidarity's `Election Gazette' Hot Off the Presses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's first mass-circulation
independent daily newspaper in more than 40 years rolled off the
presses Monday with a masthead declaring, ``There is no freedom
without Solidarity.''
   Its editors gathered in jubilation to watch the press run at the
state printing house, which is normally used to put out the
Communist Party and government dailies.
   Editor-in-chief Adam Michnik smiled broadly as he scrutinized
the first issues of Gazeta Wyborcza, or The Election Newspaper.
   Deputy editor Helena Luczywo obliged ink-covered printers who
lined up and asked her to autograph copies of the paper.
   ``It's wonderful,'' she said. ``I can't believe it.''
   The newspaper obtained offices less than a week ago. A lack of
telephones in the office and the scarcity of newsprint in Poland
had left Monday's publication up in the air as late as Sunday
morning.
   Communist authorities agreed to allow the opposition to publish
its own daily newspaper during talks that ended April 5.
   The government also agreed to legalize the Solidarity
independent trade union movement in return for the opposition's
participation in Poland's first partially democratic parliamentary
elections.
   The first issue of Gazeta Wyborcza featured a front-page picture
of Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa with a quotation in large type:
``For it to be different and better, we must win these elections.''
   The newspaper will publicize the opposition's campaign until the
election on June 4 and then plans to continue as a daily with an
opposition editorial viewpoint.
   The first run was 150,000 copies of an eight-page, five-column
newspaper. The editors hope to circulate 500,000 copies by the end
of the week.
   Only the first and last pages carried news. The inside pages
contained short biographies for all 261 Solidarity-backed
candidates running for the National Assembly.
   A front-page note explained the newspaper's aims, saying,
``Here, after more than 40 years (of Communist rule), is a normal,
mass-printed independent daily, the first in Poland and probably
the whole (Soviet) bloc.
   In a probable first for a legally published newspaper here,
Gazeta Wyborcza instructed readers to tune in to U.S.-financed
Radio Free Europe to hear interviews with Solidarity-backed
candidates.
   The newsstand price was high by Polish standards, about 8 cents,
because there was not enough paper to include ads, the editors said.

   A siren wailed for one minute Monday as Israel
mourned the 16,740 soldiers killed in its five wars with Arab
nations and in Arab guerrilla attacks on the Jewish state.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, in a letter to bereaved
families, urged them to carry on the struggle to defend the nation.
   ``I know that your nights are filled with nightmares and your
days lack the pleasures of life,'' he wrote. ``Still, I'm asking
you to persist for the sake of yourselves, your sons and daughters
who are no longer with us and, most of all, for future
generations.''
   The siren brought Israel to a standstill Monday night.
Pedestrians and motorists stopped in silent tribute. Restaurants
and movie theaters were closed and radios broadcast solemn music.
   Memorial Day officially began when President Chaim Herzog lit a
torch at the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site, in the walled
Old City.
   ``On this day, we remember that we have paid the price of fallen
soldiers, of blood and suffering for the state of Israel,'' he
said. ``Let this memory be an order of unity for us, an order to
hate war and love peace. Let God give courage to His people. Let
God bless His people with peace.''
   A two-minute siren Tuesday marks the beginning of services in 40
military cemeteries and at the 50 monuments to fallen soldiers.
   The 24-hour mourning period will end with a ceremony at the
Mount Herzl cemetery in Jerusalem, burial place of many of Israel's
soldiers and founding fathers. This also marks the start of
Israel's 41st Independence Day celebrations.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, speaking at a ceremony in
Jerusalem, focused on the Palestinian uprising in the occupied
territories, saying that ``Arab terrorism has reached new heights
of violence and murderousness against the Israeli people this
year.''
   He said that ``courage, self-sacrifice and devotion'' of fallen
soldiers encouraged Israeli troops ``to repel the stone-throwers,
the firebombers... the mad murderers led by their hate of the
Jews.''
   To prevent possible Palestinian attacks over the holidays, the
army sealed off the occupied West Bank for 53 hours, beginning
Monday evening. The order barred all of the area's nearly 1 million
Palestinians from traveling to Israel.
   About 700,000 Palestinians living in the occupied Gaza Strip
were placed under an indefinite army curfew.
   Leaders of the Palestinian uprising called a general strike for
Tuesday to mark the beginning of the revolt's 18th month.
   At least seven Israeli soldiers have died in the conflict, as
well as 14 Israeli civilians and 465 Palestinians.
   The latest victim was Sgt. Avi Sassportaz, 21, whose body was
found Sunday a mile from the road junction where he was last seen
nearly three months ago trying to hitchhike home. Israeli officials
said Sassportaz was shot by Palestinian guerrillas.
   In Sassportaz's hometown of Ashdod, thousands turned out for his
funeral. Mourners later poured onto a main road and stoned
Arab-owned cars, and police arrested dozens of protesters,
witnesses said.
   ``The last year has not been good for us, and we paid a high, a
painful price,'' Rabin said in his letter.
   The army says 16,740 soldiers have died in Israel's five wars
and in guerrilla attacks, including 785 in the 1967 Middle East war
in which Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza. In Israel's last
war, the 1982 invasion of Lebanon and three-year occupation, 1,183
soldiers lost their lives.

<DATELINE>BOLZANO, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The neo-fascist Italian Social Movement
strengthened its hold as the leading party in the capital of Alto
Adige province in the Alps, according to complete local election
returns Monday.
   It won 27 percent of the vote in Sunday's election, up 5 points
from the last city election in 1985. The party has tried to curb
the influence of German speakers in the province, once part of the
Austrian Tyrol.
   Finishing second was the South Tyrol People's Party, which runs
the provincial government, with 19.5 percent, down from 20.5
percent in 1985.
   Big gains also were posted by the Greens party, which runs both
Italian-speaking and German-speaking candidates. It got 12 percent
of the vote, up from 8 percent.
   German speakers outnumber those who speak Italian by
280,000-124,000 in the province, which was separated from Austria
at the end of World War I. Italian speakers are a majority in
Bolzano, however.
   The province is offically bilingual, but a quota system gives
the German-speaking majority the upper hand in jobs and public
housing. The Christian Democrats, Socialists and other mainstream
Italian parties lost votes in the Bolzano election.
   Bomb attacks blamed on German-speaking separatists marred the
provincial election campaign last year, but the city election
campaign this month was free of violence.

<HEAD>Eds: To update with comments from Baker, adds 3 grafs after 5th graf

<TEXT>
   The White House indicated Monday that a
superpower summit is not a high priority for Secretary of State
James A. Baker's talks in Moscow and said there is no guarantee his
trip will produce a date for resuming arms talks.
   Baker left Washington Monday and will arrive in Moscow on
Wednesday after a stop in Helsinki. He will see Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze Wednesday and again Thursday morning
and meet with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev for two hours
Thursday afternoon.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater suggested Baker
would not even mention a summit without prompting from the Soviets.
   Fitzwater said Baker ``is willing to discuss a summit, should
that be raised by the Soviets and should he feel that it is
warranted by the circumstances at hand.''
   The White House spokesman said Baker ``goes there with an open
mind, but it's a first meeting, a chance to explore any number of
issues, and we just couldn't predict whether that would be an
outcome or not.''
   Baker, who arrived in Finland on Monday evening for a rest stop
before heading for Moscow, told reporters he intends to make clear
that the Bush administration is ``seeking an active, constructive,
positive and expanding relationship.''
   ``We want to test the (Soviet) new thinking across the full
range of our relations,'' Baker said. ``If we find that the Soviet
Union is serious about new global behavior, then we will seek
diplomatic engagement in an effort to reach mutually beneficial
results.''
   ``We recognized that there is real change taking place in the
Soviet Union,'' he said. ``We think this provides the United States
and the West with an opportunity.''
   Baker is expected to propose that U.S. and Soviet negotiators
resume talks the third week of June on a treaty to reduce
long-range bombers, missiles and submarines by 30 to 50 percent.
   The negotiations were suspended last November and were
tentatively set to resume in February. But the talks were put on
hold when Bush announced a review of policies toward the Soviet
Union and other issues.
   Asked if he expects Baker to reach agreement in Moscow on a date
for resuming talks, Fitzwater said he ``would not predict anything
that specific.''
   He said a review of the U.S. position on long-range nuclear arms
is not due for completion ``until probably June, July _ mid-summer
is the latest I've heard.''
   In recent weeks, the Bush administration has come under
increasing criticism for moving too slowly and cautiously toward
steps by Gorbachev to lower tensions, such as reductions in troops
and defense spending. The administration has questioned whether
those steps have done much to offset Warsaw Pact military
advantages in Europe.
   Reporting on the results of the foreign policy reviews,
President Bush will outline his position on the Soviet Union and
East-West relations in a speech Friday at Texas A&amp;M University.
   On May 21, Bush will deliver a speech at Boston University on
NATO and how the West should ``deal with the continuing threat from
the Soviet Union,'' Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman said Bush's speech Friday would talk ``in terms of
taking advantage of the changes that have been made under General
Secretary Gorbachev, would address the president's view of the
impact of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (economic reforms)
and talk about how the Western nations should define its
relationships with the Soviet Union in that changing political
climate.''
   Fitzwater acknowledged that the West will have to redefine its
relationship with Moscow.
   ``The United States, indeed all of the Western countries, have
had a certain attitude and a set of policies since World War II and
even before, based upon the Soviet threat,'' he said.
   ``There are a number of activities underway in the Soviet Union
which are changing the nature of our relationship with them.''
   Under Gorbachev, the West is discussing issues such as regional
conflicts, arms control and human rights ``with a degree of
openness that has not been possible in the past,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said it seems clear that ``we are at a point that suggests a
definition of a different relationship between the East and West''
from an economic, military and trade standpoint.
   On a related subject, Fitzwater said the presence of short-range
nuclear weapons in Europe is ``part of the equation that goes with
having our troops in Europe.
   ``There is no intention of changing that policy at this time,''
Fitzwater said. West Germany has called for negotiations with the
Soviet Union to curb short-range nuclear weapons, but the United
States has rejected the idea.
   Meanwhile, Jacques Chirac, the mayor of Paris and former French
prime minister, met with Bush and said later that Bush's opposition
to East-West talks on eliminating the short-range weapons was
widely supported by most European leaders.

<HEAD>Borden Pulls Milk From Louisiana and Mississippi Markets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN McGILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Borden Inc. pulled milk from stores in two
Southern states Monday after learning that milk from some northwest
Louisiana and east Texas dairies might contain traces of a compound
used in rat poison.
   Borden, the world's largest dairy company, pulled milk off store
shelves throughout Mississippi and in north Louisiana.
   Gwen Stewart of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals
said officials believe they kept all milk contaminated with
dangerous amounts of barium carbonate from reaching store shelves.
   ``The bottom line is, there is not and has not been any
contaminated milk on the market,'' Stewart said.
   Some milk with trace levels of barium was allowed on the market,
but it was considered an acceptable level, she said. Health
officials in Mississippi agreed.
   ``The amount you can drink is far less than the amount that
would be dangerous,'' said Dr. Ed Thompson of the Mississippi
Department of Health. ``There's just not a significant health risk
involved.''
   A person would have to drink about seven 8-ounce glasses of the
milk in succession for it to have any ill effect, and more than 100
8-ounce glasses for it to be fatal, Thompson said.
   There were no reports of anyone suffering any ill effects from
drinking any of Borden's milk, officials said.
   Borden's spokeswoman Chris Tilton said they learned of the
barium contamination on Sunday and decided to voluntarily pull its
milk as a precautionary measure, even though tests indicated the
amounts of barium present was below the acceptable level.
   The problem first came to light when cattle died at an east
Texas dairy farm on April 22 and a Louisiana dairy farm on April
24, Stewart said.
   The milk was ordered held at the dairies and was not sent to
companies for processing and therefore did not reach the general
public, officials said.
   Frozen milk samples taken after the withhold orders were given
revealed the presence of barium _ from 2 parts per million to 5
parts per million _ Stewart said.
   A check with a Purina feed mill in Shreveport revealed that feed
used by the farmers had been carried in a rail car used to
transport barium carbonate.
   Stewart said tests were done later at dairies and at plants that
received milk from those dairies. Traces of barium _ less than half
the maximum amount listed in government water standards _ were
found in some samples, Stewart said.
   Barium carbonate is a white powder used in rat poison and a
variety of processes, including manufacture of some kinds of glass
and ceramics, according to the Mississippi Emergency Management
Agency. It is toxic if swallowed.
   There are no standards set for barium in milk, Stewart said.
However, she and Tilton said government standards for water limit
barium to 1 part per million.
   After checking records, Purina told the state that contaminated
feed had been sold to other farmers in the northwest Louisiana and
east Texas area.
   Tilton, speaking by telephone from Borden's Columbus, Ohio,
offices, said the company did not know whether any of the milk, ice
cream and other products it distributed to stores was contaminated.
   ``We made the assumption that this was in our milk supply,'' she
said.
   Purina picked up the unconsumed feed that went to Louisiana and
Texas farmers and tests were being conducted to make sure milk from
those areas was uncontaminated, Stewart said.

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Edwin Edwards, whose third
term was marked by his trial and acquittal of federal racketeering
charges, said Monday that he will seek a fourth term as the state's
chief executive in 1991.
   ``I can tell you that Buddy Roemer will not be the next
governor, so I decided to make the run,'' Edwards said of the
incumbent at an impromptu news conference at the Capitol.
   Asked why he was visiting the Capitol just over a week after
Roemer's tax revision package was rejected by voters, Edwards
replied: ``I'm going to tell the people `I told you so.'''
   ``This governor just wants to increase taxes,'' he said.
   Roemer was not available immediately for comment, said his press
officer, Sidney Coffee.
   Roemer's tax package was aimed at reducing a $700 million
deficit projected for the new fiscal year beginning July 1.
   Edwards, a Democrat, said he will again push for a lottery and
casino gambling, as he did in 1987 when he trailed Roemer in the
gubernatorial primary and bowed out of a runoff. Roemer had
campaigned calling for budget reductions, no new taxes and no
lottery.
   Pressure is mounting in the Legislature for a lottery but the
governor continues to oppose it.
   ``A lottery and casino gambling are the only answers in these
economic times,'' Edwards said. ``There are some long-range things
that can be done but the state needs something sooner, and not
taxes on the backs of the people.''
   Edwards, elected in 1971 and 1975, was constitutionally barred
from seeking re-election in 1979. In 1983, he defeated Dave Treen,
Louisiana's first Republican governor since Reconstruction.
   Edwards said he would open a campaign office in about a year.
   ``Right now, I'm handling volumes of telephone calls and mail,
strictly political things _ people wanting favors, advice and
counseling. I'm doing that out of my own pocket,'' he said.

   The Khmer Rouge on Monday
rejected a cease-fire proposal, saying Cambodia's
Vietnamese-installed government must first be dismantled.
   ``We cannot accept a cease-fire that keeps in place a puppet
government,'' said Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan. ``Once there
is is an international commission to supervise the Vietnamese
pullout there will be a cease-fire, not before.''
   Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia in December 1978, ousted the
radical Khmer Rouge that had ruled for more than three years and
set up another communist government.
   Vietnam has said it will withdraw its estimated 50,000 to 70,000
military personnel from Cambodia by Sept. 30.
   Prince Norodom Sihanouk, head of a three-party resistance
coalition that includes the Khmer Rouge, held talks last week in
Indonesia with Cambodian Premier Hun Sen on the formation of a
provisional government.
   Khieu Samphan and Sihanouk spoke with reporters after a
diplomatic ceremony at a guerrilla base here in Cambodia's Siam
Reap province about a half mile from the border with Thailand.
   At the ceremony, ambasadors from China, North Korea and Senegal
presented their credentials to Sihanouk as president of the
coalition government.
   During the Indonesian conference Thai Prime Minister Chatichai
Choonhavan proposed that Sihanouk and Hun Sen agree to a cease-fire
before the Vietnamese withdrawal is completed.
   Sihanouk and Hun Sen agreed, but Khieu Samphan said Monday a
cease-fire could come only with the simultaneous dismantling of the
Hun Sen government. He said a provisional government ``should be
formed outside the framework of the two regimes'' _ the guerrilla
coalition and Hun Sen government.
   Sihanouk had no immediate comment on Khieu Samphan's rejection.
   Hun Sen opposes Khmer Rouge participation in any new government.
   The Vietnamese communists and Khmer Rouge came to power in the
spring of 1975, defeating U.S.-backed governments in South Vietnam
and Cambodia.
   It is estimated that under Khmer Rouge rule more than 1 million
people in Cambodia's population of 8 million were executed in
purges or died of starvation.
   Sihanouk leads the resistance coalition but the Khmer Rouge,
with as many as 40,000 combatants, is far stronger than the other
two members _ Sihanouk's supporters and the non-communist Khmer
People's National Liberation Front.
   Sihanouk, who has condemned the Khmer Rouge atrocities, said
that in Indonesia Hun Sen suggested they join forces to defeat the
Khmer Rouge.
   Sihanouk on Monday did not rule out that possibility and said he
would decide by November.
   But he also said as long as Vietnamese troops remain in Cambodia
he would insist that Hun Sen allow the Khmer Rouge a place in a
four-party provisional government.
   He said he was insisting on a four-party government ``not as an
accomplice of the Khmer Rouge but because I have to be realistic.''
   ``To make them (the Khmer Rouge) bandits and rebels would be the
worst solution for a post-Vietnamese Cambodia,'' Sihanouk said.
``What I fear most is a civil war.''

<HEAD>Moscow to Keep Sending Weapons to Nicaragua, Officials Say</HEAD>

   Moscow will keep supplying
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government with weapons as long as
the United States sends arms to other Central American nations, two
Soviet diplomats here said Monday.
   ``Nicaragua would be at a disadvantage if all the region
continues getting weapons and Nicaragua doesn't. You must remember
that Honduras is practically a North American base in Central
America,'' said Yury Sajnin, political counselor at the Soviet
Embassy in the Costa Rican capital of San Jose.
   ``With Nicaragua we have diplomatic relations and agreements,
and these include supplying weapons, even though armament shipments
have been reduced,'' said Vadim Rozanov, the Soviet ambassador to
Costa Rica.
   They spoke at a news conference in the Soviet Embassy called to
commemorate the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic
relations between the Soviet Union and Costa Rica.
   Rozanov said Moscow ``believes the conflicts in Central America
should be solved by the Central Americans themselves, without
outside interference.''
   He said the Soviet government supports a peace effort undertaken
in 1987 by the presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras,
Nicaragua and Guatemala.
   ``The Soviet Union is willing to respect the agreements reached
or to be reached by the Central American governments and to
contribute to a peaceful solution to the conflicts in the area,''
Rozanov added.
   The peace initiative, begun by President Oscar Arias of Costa
Rica, seeks a negotiated end to the civil war between the
Sandinista government and U.S.-supported rebels, known as Contras,
who are based in Honduras. It also seeks negotiations to end
rebellions in El Salvador and Guatemala and calls for
democratization in Central America.
   The five regional presidents have met periodically to advance
the plan. To date, the Sandinistas and Contras have achieved a
tenuous cease-fire, while Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has
called for national elections in February 1990.
   Rozanov rejected a recent accusation by Salvadoran
President-elect Alfredo Cristiani that the Soviet Union supplies
aid to that country's leftist insurgency. ``No one has proof of
that. It is a deception of public opinion,'' he said.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms In Central Part of Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms developed Monday over the central part of the
nation, with showers scattered elsewhere, after a morning of record
low temperatures scattered across the Southeast.
   Light snow was scattered over parts of upstate New York a day
after 10 inches fell in Rochester, N.Y.
   Thunderstorms developed along and ahead of a warm front and
produced hail and locally heavy rain over parts of Kansas and
Missouri, and drifted into northern Arkansas.
   One thunderstorm produced hail an inch in diameter during the
morning southeast of Kansas City, Mo., in the suburb of Lee's
Summit. Afternoon thunderstorms caused hail in Arkansas.
   A cold front pushing southeastward across the central part of
the nation was expected to trigger thunderstorms in the warm, moist
air over the south-central states.
   Showers were scattered across the upper Mississippi Valley and
the northern Atlantic Coast, and across the northern Rockies and
the northern high Plains.
   These record and record-tying lows were reported by the National
Weather Service: Asheville, N.C., 28 degrees; Athens, Ga., 37;
Augusta, Ga., 36; Beaufort, S.C., 43; Bristol, Tenn., 30;
Charleston, S.C., 45; Charlotte, N.C., 35; Cincinnati, 33, tie;
Columbia, S.C., 35; Evansville, Ind., 38, tie; Greensboro, N.C.,
32; Greer, S.C., 31; Hollywood, Fla., 55; Jacksonville, Fla., 48;
Macon, Ga., 42; Montgomery, Ala., 45, tie; Paducah, Ky., 39;
Raleigh, N.C., 36; Savannah, Ga., 43; Tallahassee, Fla., 42; and
Wilmington, N.C., 38
   But in Texas, Lubbock hit a record high of 99 degrees and
Midland tied its record of 103.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 37
degrees at Bradford, Pa., to 106 at Gila Bend, Ariz., and Palm
Springs, Calif. Monday's low for the 48 contiguous states was 24 at
Gunnison, Colo.
   For Tuesday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast from
Georgia, the Carolinas and the middle Atlantic Coast states into
Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. Scattered showers were forecast across
Maine, and across the Pacific Northwest.
   Highs in the 50s were predicted across the Great Lakes region
and the northern Atlantic Coast states; in the 50s and 60s from the
middle and upper Mississippi Valley to the middle and northern
Atlantic Coast states; in the 60s along much of the Pacific Coast;
in the 80s over much of the rest of the West, and from Florida and
southern Georgia to Louisiana; in the 80s and 90s in Texas; and in
the 90s or above 100 over southern sections of California, Nevada,
Arizona and New Mexico.

<HEAD>Former CBS News President Criticizes Networks Coverage</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 5th graf, `In less...,' to CORRECT bureaus closed to Warsaw
and Bangkok; picks up 6th graf, `But Turner...'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RADNOR, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   News coverage by television networks has been
deteriorating, while Ted Turner's Cable News Network is improving,
a former CBS News president said.
   Ed Joyce, who headed CBS News from 1983 to 1986, critiqued
current news coverage in the May 13 TV Guide magazine.
   The three broadcast networks changed owners in the past four
years, and the ``big losers'' in those transactions have been
television viewers who have depended on network programs as their
primary source of news, Joyce contends.
   The networks' ability to provide adequate news coverage ``has
been sacrificed to protect bloated stock values,'' he wrote.
   In less than 18 months, CBS dismissed one-third of its news
staff and closed bureaus in Warsaw and Bangkok to cut costs, Joyce
said. NBC and ABC made similar reductions.
   But Turner tightened CNN's budget in other ways and in December
announced the addition of seven new foreign bureaus, bringing CNN's
total to 18, Joyce wrote.
   For decades, the broadcast networks have made decisions on what
is major news based on where their foreign bureaus are located,
Joyce said.
   ``Labor unrest _ say, a miners strike _ in England, where each
network has a large bureau, is news. A similar story in Santiago
(Chile), where they don't have bureaus, is not.''
   The broadcast networks' cutbacks are predictable, he said,
because they are no longer being run by entrepreneurs but by people
who view them as investments. As such, network decisions are based
on the minimum risk factor, whereas Turner's strategy is surrounded
by the aura of risk.
   ``If Ted Turner can maintain an expanding global news service,
he deserves applause and a measure of gratitude,'' he said.
   ``For the networks, the failure to preserve their news franchise
is a colossal blunder. They are creating a situation in which they
will become increasingly irrelevant.''

<HEAD>Sanchez Appointed Prime Minister</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADD 10 grafs UPDATING with Garcia quotes, new violence. No pickup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armando Villanueva resigned as prime minister
on Monday and was replaced by Vice President Luis Alberto Sanchez
as criticism of government anti-insurgency policies increased.
   Sanchez, who is 88 and nearly blind, is also a senator and is
one of Peru's most respected political figures. Despite his age,
Sanchez frequently travels abroad on state business, participates
regularly in Congress and plays a leading role in the internal
affairs of the center-left Aprista Party.
   The government said President Alan Garcia's entire 15-minister
Cabinet also submitted resignations, as is customary when a prime
minister quits.
   A Peruvian prime minister is not as powerful as in a
parliamentary system such as Britain or Canada, where the position
is the highest government post in the nation.
   Sanchez will keep both his senate seat and his vice presidential
post, which is largely ceremonial.
   Garcia is expected to replace some Cabinet members to more
effectively combat Peru's economic and insurgency woes.
   Villanueva, who also quit his interior minister's post, said a
recent increase in terrorism, including the assassination of two
congressmen in 10 days, prompted the resignation.
   Peru has fought a leftist insurgency by the Mao-inspired Shining
Path guerrilla group for nine years. More than 14,000 people have
been killed, including about 1,000 so far this year.
   Sanchez is the fourth prime minister of the Garcia government,
which holds power until July 1990. Critics said Cabinet changes
have not had much impact because Garcia is the dominant personality.
   Garcia on Monday called Sanchez a national institution who has
``the prestige and knowledge ... to unite us in two fundamental
areas: the fight against subversion and to reactive the economy.''
   Garcia, a populist, took office in July 1985 for a five-year
term. After two years of prosperity, the economy has entered a deep
recession. Analysts said the economic and insurgency problems
undermine Peru's democracy.
   Shining Path guerrillas killed seven people in attacks that also
left two rebels dead, police at Huancayo, 140 miles east of Lima,
said Monday.
   Also Monday, more than 200 soldiers swept through the state-run
University of Huancayo, seeking leftist guerrillas and hoping to
defuse a planned `armed strike,' reporters and school officials
said.
   They said 10 students were detained. Security forces call the
school a haven for rebels.
   A band of guerrillas shot and killed two police guards early
Monday at a dance in a jungle village near Satipo, 200 miles east
of Lima, then entered the dance and killed one man, Huancayo police
said.
   In the highlands, two policemen, two Shining Path guerrillas and
a civilian were slain when rebels Sunday night attacked a police
post in Huariaca, a village about 135 miles northeast of Lima,
police said.
   In La Oroya, 95 miles northeast of Lima, Shining Path assassins
shot and killed a mining labor leader Monday on a city street,
police said.
   A note left by the body demanded that people in the region
surrounding Huancayo join a three-day armed strike set to begin
Wednesday, police said.
   The Shining Path began armed strikes about a year ago as a tool
to foment economic chaos. The strikes carry with them the threat of
violent reprisal against anyone not participating.

   The World Bank said Monday it has approved a

economy by revamping the commercial banking system.
   The funds will be disbursed in two $150 million installments,
one shortly and the second after the government carries out agreed
reforms in trade, tax, agricultural and administrative policy, the
World Bank said.
   The new loan is for 20 years at a variable interest rate,
currently 7.65 percent.
   The World Bank gave the Philippines a $300 million economic
recovery loan in March 1987 and a $200 million loan for reforming

<HEAD>Newspapers Heavily Fined for Publishing Spy's Memoirs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>L.ONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge on Monday fined three newspapers $83,500
each for contempt of court for publishing material from a former
intelligence agent's memoirs in violation of a court injunction.
   High Court Judge Sir Andrew Morritt ruled that the newspapers
published excerpts from ``Spycatcher,'' by retired secret service
man Peter Wright, knowing that publication could prejudice the
court case against the book.
   The government fought a 2{-year court battle to suppress
``Spycatcher,'' arguing that Wright was bound to a lifetime vow of
secrecy. It lost the case and the book is now legally available in
Britain, but the state pursued prosecution of The Independent, The
Sunday Times and the now-defunct News on Sunday.
   Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil vowed to fight the ruling all
the way to the European Court in Strasbourg, France.
   ``It seems that now, to get a proper value put on freedom of the
press, you have to go outside this country,'' he said. ``There was
not one word in this judgment today about the freedom of the press
or about the importance of a newspaper publishing things that
powerful people don't want published.''
   Independent editor Andreas Whittam Smith said the ruling meant
``that injunctions can now be manipulated as a sort of blanket gag
on the press.''
   The editors said they were worried because the ruling meant an
injunction obtained against one newspaper automatically applied to
other newspapers even if they had not had time to argue the case
for publication before a judge.
   ``It's another nail in the coffin of those of us who think we
ought to be able to publish what we want in the public interest,''
said Neil.
   The judge said Whittam Smith clearly knew that printing part of
the unpublished text of ``Spycatcher'' in April 1987 would
``inevitably interfere in the proper administration of justice.''
   The Sunday Times, which had bought the serialization rights,
also published in the knowledge it would ``damage or destroy'' the
secrecy of Wright's material, Morritt ruled.
   He said Brian Whittaker, former editor of The News on Sunday,
published with the intention of doing ``exactly what the courts had
said should not be done.''
   On the day after the House of Lords, sitting as Britain's
highest court, barred publication, the paper's banner headline
said: ``We defy the House of Lords _ a law made to be broken.''
   Neil told BBC-TV the public would be baffled why the case was
still going on when the book was freely available.
   ``You can buy it two blocks down the road from here,'' he said.
``Publication of it hasn't brought the roof down in this country.
... Yet here we are in still in the courts, still battling over
it.''

   President Bush's ambassadors-designate to
France, Italy and Sweden assured senators Monday they will keep
alert to arms sales from those European countries to the Third
World.
   The United States has been concerned about the supply of weapons
to developing countries, prompting questions at the Senate Foreign
Relations Committe's hearing on the nominations of Walter J.P.
Curley as ambassador to France, Charles E. Redman to Sweden and
Peter Secchia to Italy.
   Redman said the Swedish record is overall a good one and Sweden
tries to avoid sending arms into areas of tension and conflict.
   The Italian government has committed itself to tightening
restrictions on arms exports, Sechhia said.
   Curley said France, a big arms exporter, has a special
relationship with Iraq and its control over and monitoring of
weapon supplies to French-speaking African countries has been
``quite tight.''
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the panel, said he
intends to move quickly on the nominations of Secchia and Curley so
that they can be in their new posts when Bush visits Europe later
this month.
   The committee will likely report the three nominations to the
Senate floor Wednesday, he said, with action probable by the end of
this week.

<DATELINE>LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 30,000 Slovenians marched
through downtown Ljubljana on Monday night protesting the trial by
a military court that sentenced three journalists and a soldier to
prison.
   The four were convicted in July of making public a classified
military document and were given sentences ranging from 10 months
to four years.
   The defendants contended the document outlined illegal military
actions planned against political activists in Slovenia, considered
to be the most liberal of Yugoslavia's six republics.
   Protest organizers accused Slovenian officials of bowing to army
actions.
   Participants in the peaceful two-hour march carried banners
saying, ``Freedom for the four means freedom for all of us,'' and
``Against militarism _for human rights.''
   The rally was called by newly formed opposition and human rights
groups.
   Speakers at the rally denounced military leaders and Communist
Party conservatives, saying they used the four defendants as
scapegoats in a political attack on Slovenian liberals.
   ``We demand a revision of the judicial process ... and we want
this farce to be declared null and void,'' said Joze Skolc, head of
the official Youth Forum.
   France Tomsic, leader of the new Slovenian Social Democratic
Party, said, ``An end must come to meddling in civilian affairs by
Yugoslavia's ... Soviet-style Stalinist army.''
   Earlier Monday, students at Ljubljana University voted to begin
on Thursday a boycott of classes to protest the military trial.
   One of the defendants, Janez Jansa, was taken to the Dob
penitentiary Friday after he failed to win a reversal of his
18-month sentence.
   Jansa and Franci Zavrl, editors of the Mladina youth weekly,
were sentenced to 18 months and David Tasic, a Mladina reporter,
was given a 10-month sentence. Sgt. Maj. Ivan Borstner, who is to
report to the Dob prison on May 16, was sentenced to four years.
   Zavrl and Tasic are still appealing their sentences.
   A special commission set up by Slovenia's Parliament to study
the document obtained by the defendants said some of the military
outlines it contained were ``illegal and unconstitutional.'' But it
said because the document is still classified it could not specify
what plans were contrary to Yugoslav law.
   In another development, Slobodan Milosevic was elected president
of Serbia by a unanimous vote in Parliament. Milosevic, who had
been the republic's Communist Party chief, was unopposed.
   Under Yugoslavia's system of annual rotation of key political
officers Milosevic had to resign his party post to become president.
   As party leader Milosevic led the campaign to gain more control
over Serbia's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo, which have ethnic
Albanian majorities.
   At least 24 people were killed in battles between ethnic
Albanians and police in March after Serbia's Parliament approved
constitutional amendments giving Serbia more control over police
forces and education in Kosovo.

<TEXT>
   It was 3 a.m., and the vote tallies
were showing the opposition winning by a lopsided margin, poll
watchers said. Then the soldiers came.
   ``They fired a few shots and everybody scattered, everybody ran
and jumped through fences and sought refuge in nearby homes,'' said
Marcos Herrera, an opposition poll watcher who was in the gymnasium
where the votes were being tabulated Monday.
   The soldiers beat a few stragglers and seized most of the tally
sheets from the Panama City suburb of San Miguelito, where more
than 120,000 of Panama's 1.18 million voters were registered for
Sunday's presidential election.
   But the raid was not thorough. Scores of sheets were left on the
floor of the gym; some were still in the polling stations' large
yellow envelopes.
   All sheets examined by an Associated Press reporter showed a
clear lead, often by more than 3-1, for opposition candidate
Guillermo Endara over Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's hand-picked
candidate, Carlos Duque.
   It was a brazen show of force in an election that the opposition
claimed already had been rigged by Noriega, commander of the
Panamanian Defense Forces commander and the country's de facto
ruler.
   ``You should not be surprised about this,'' said a man sitting
on the porch of his home near the gymnasium. ``This is that they
did in 1984,'' when the govenrment also was accused to rigging the
elections.
   Similar instances of tally sheet seizures took place throughout
the nation.
   It was not known where the soldiers took the sheets. But the
national tabulation board announced Monday morning it had not
received tallies from any of the 40 electoral districts.
   Said Elizabeth Escobar, whose house is about 50 yards from the
gym:
   ``A man who said he was bringing a tally sheet came running into
the house and gave it to me, saying `Hang on to this, we'll be back
to pick it up later.'''
   She showed the tally sheet of precinct 3655 and other
documentation to journalists. Endara had beaten Duque, 121-41.
   A member of the Defense Forces and a policeman watched
journalists as they walked into the gymnasium. An hour later the
doors to the gym were locked.
   ``Talk to the neighbors if you want to know what happened,'' an
officer said.
   A few blocks away government sympathizers gathered in a
politician's office. Victor Schailer, an alternate candidate for
the National Assembly, said he had not heard about the attack on
the gym.
   ``If anything happened it was probably the result of the flow of
adrenaline and the emotions of people,'' he said, adding he had not
heard any shots fired.
   When told of the scene at the gym, with ballots scattered on the
floor, Schailer said he would have to confirm it himself.
   At a news conference in Panama City, European and U.S. election
observers expressed concern.
   Voting was peaceful until 5 p.m. Sunday, when the polls closed,
said Fernando Suarez Gonzalez, a Spanish member of a parliamentary
observer group. ``Our doubts begin at five.''
   Angry residents of San Miguelito, a working-class suburb,
gathered in knots on the street Monday and vented their
frustrations at some foreign journalists.
   ``You were here in the morning'' shouted one man, referring to
Sunday, when former President Jimmy Carter visited the area.
``Where were the international observers, where were you, when the
soldiers came in?''

Karnataka state.
   Indian central and state governments and private institutions
are also providing $217 million for the second phase of the Upper
Krishna River Irrigation Project in the southern India state.
   The World Bank funds will help pay for surveying, road
construction, training, land distribution, relocation allowances,
community service facilities and dams and canals for nearly 370,500
acres of drought-prone farmland.
   The World Bank said it will lend $165 million at a variable
interest rate that is currently 7.65 percent, and provide $160
million interest-free through its International Development
Association affiliate.
   An earlier phase of the Upper Krishna project has irrigated
100,000 247,000 acres, and future stages are planned to bring the
total land under irrigation to 2.47 million acres.

   A toddler whose throat was slashed in a
rampage that killed seven people is making a strong recovery and
``throwing temper tantrums'' like a normal youngster, her doctor
said Monday.
   Carmina Salcido ``is behaving like any 3-year-old,'' Dr. Ralph
Keill said at a news conference outside Petaluma Valley Hospital
about 30 miles north of San Francisco.
   Carmina, who is in good condition, has been ``playing, pouting
and throwing temper tantrums'' like a normal youngster, Keill said.
   The girl, recovering from her throat slashing, talks in a
whisper, said hospital spokeswoman Mary Frost.
   ``It sounds pretty good to us,'' Frost said, adding that Carmina
is expected to be discharged within two weeks.
   Carmina leaves the hospital for walks and rides on her new
tricycle, and has gone on an outing with her grandfather, Robert
Richards, officials said.
   The youngster was discovered in a trash heap on April 15, her
throat slashed from ear to ear and left for dead next to the bodies
of her slaughtered sisters, Sofia 4, and Teresa, 1.
   Carmina was the only survivor in the killing spree that also
took the lives of her mother, Angela, 24; her grandmother, Marian
Richards, 47; two of her daughters, Marie, 8, and Ruth, 12, and
winery co-worker Tracy Toovey, 35. They were shot, beaten or
stabbed to death on April 14.
   Carmina's father, Ramon Salcido, 28, was captured in Mexico and
deported to California to face multiple murder charges. He pleaded
innocent to the crimes and is in solitary confinement in the Sonoma
County Jail.
   Carmina's recovery has been eased by a bounty of toys she
received from the public after the ordeal, hospital officials said.
   ``Carmina has been lovingly cared for by the nurses in the
intensive care unit,'' Keill said. ``We have worked closely with
Carmina's grandfather, Mr. Richards, and with (Sonoma County) Child
Protective Services in making decisions regarding her care.''
   Richards has asked the Child Protective Services to allow him to
become the girl's legal guardian.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega is
stealing Panama's presidential election for his own candidate by
substituting phony vote counts, former President Jimmy Carter said
Monday.
   ``I hope there will be a worldwide outcry against this dictator
stealing this election from his own people,'' said Carter, who came
to Panama as an independent observer at the government's invitation.
   A delegation of U.S. observers named by President Bush made less
dramatic charges of irregularities in Sunday's election. The
delegation said it concluded that Noriega's soldiers intimidated
voters and carried out widespread fraud.
   Carter's charges appeared to support those of opposition
leaders, who said soldiers raided voting stations nationwide and
stole tally sheets.
   The opposition said Noriega, Panama's de facto leader, ordered
the move to prevent his candidate, Carlos Duque, from losing to
opposition candidate Guillermo Endara.
   Carter told a news conference he was permitted to examine vote
tallies at the election center and determined they were counterfeit.
   He said the military seized thousands of tally sheets in a
nighttime sweep.
   ``During the day, those records have been discarded and
counterfeit documents have been substituted,'' said Carter.
   He said the documents at the election center were not signed by
opposition poll watchers, while all sheets had been signed before
leaving polling booths.
   The tally sheets contain numbers based on a count of ballots,
which are burned afterward to prevent tampering.
   Carter said the Panamanian government stopped cooperating with
his mission as soon as he raised the issues. His news conference
was held in a hotel lobby as a crowd of Noriega supporters jeered
outside.
   At a separate news conference at the officers' club at Albrook
Air Force Base, the chairman of the official U.S. delegation, Rep.
John Murtha, said his group could not certify that the election was
``free and fair.''
   Murtha, D-Pa., said the archbishop of Panama, Marcos McGrath,
told him a church exit poll indicated the opposition won in a
landslide.
   ``This election was a terrible fraud on the Panamanian people,''
said one delegation member, Rep. Larry Smith, R-Fla.
   The 13 U.S. observers said they witnessed fraud firsthand,
watching individual Panamanian Defense Forces soldiers voting in
more than one precinct around the capital.
   Noriega is chief of the Defense Forces.
   The Panamanian Committee for Human Rights, which invited 279
observers from 21 nations, also branded the election as fraudulent.
   The committee said the military intimidated voters and tampered
with precinct tally sheets. It called on the Noriega-controlled
government ``to respect the decision of the Panamanian people.''
   Smith said his delegation saw polls open late, voter lists with
some names missing and names of dead people included
   ``It was all small, different fraud,'' he said.
   The U.S. delegation steered away from policy questions, saying
it would consult Congress and the White House before suggesting
what methods may be used to dislodge Noriega. The general was
indicted in February 1988 in Florida on federal drug-trafficking
charges, which he has denied.
   Some members of the delegation, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said the Pentagon should withdraw 5,700 military
dependents in Panama and ``tighten the economic screws.''
   Others were more vocal. In Miami, Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., an
observer who left early Monday, said the United States ``should now
consider the use of force in Panama.
   Florida's other senator, Republican Connie Mack, said that if
Noriega's candidate is declared the winner, he expects to introduce
legislation this week to cancel the 1977 treaty that is to give
Panama control of the canal in 1999.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, faced with reports of rampant
fraud in Panama's election, huddled with top advisers Monday to
weigh what steps the United States should take next in its efforts
to oust dictator Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   An administration official who asked not to be identified said
one possibility is to beef up the U.S. military presence in the
Canal Zone to protect U.S. citizens.
   Some 10,000 U.S. military personnel are already based in the
Canal Zone, which remains under U.S. control despite the decade-old
treaty that cedes control of the Panama Canal to that Central
American country at the end of the century.
   Also under consideration, in addition to beefing up the U.S.
military presence, are further economic sanctions, the official
said.
   Bush will get a first-hand report at the White House on Tuesday
from the team of U.S. observers he sent to monitor Sunday's
balloting. He will make no decision until after that meeting, the
administration official said.
   The president met Monday with Vice President Dan Quayle; Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney; White House Chief of Staff John Sununu;
Director of Central Intelligence William Webster and other aides to
weigh U.S. options.
   Meanwhile, the State Department expressed deep concern Monday
night over evidence that forces loyal to Noriega were using
fraudulent means to ensure victory for his candidate.
   The evidence cited by the department was based partly on
comments by the head of the presidential observer delegation in
Panama, Rep. John Murtha, R-Pa., who claimed the electoral process
was marked by ``fraud and manipulation.''
   The State Department also said the vote tabulation had been
interrupted after the election Sunday and European parliamentarians
reported that 127,000 ballots were destroyed.
   ``We are deeply concerned by evidence pouring in of electoral
fraud on the part of the pro-Noriega forces,'' the statement said.
   It added that opposition demonstrators were met Monday by a show
of force, including water cannons, riot police and armed civilian
supporters of the government.
   Earlier, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater noted
there were numerous reports of fraud and intimidation and he cited
independent exit polls showing the opposition slate had well over
60 per cent and the government coalition in the ``low 20s.''
   At the State Department, deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said,
``At this juncture, it appears clear that the people of Panama have
voted for democracy. It is now up to Gen. (Manuel Antonio) Noriega
to respect the wishes of the Panamanian people.''
   He refused to say what action the United States would take if
the administration concludes that Noriega, the Defense Forces
commander, rigged the results in favor of his hand-picked
candidate, Carlos Duque.
   Other officials said last week the administration is weighing a
series of options if Noriega retains power through fraudulent means.
   One option would be to take legal action to seize Noriega's
personal assets in the United States and Europe. According to the
officials, these assets are believed to total in the hundreds of
millions of dollars.
   Imposing a trade embargo against Panama is another option, the
officials said.
   Meanwhile, two U.S. senators arrived in Miami from Panama on
Monday, saying the United States should consider force against
Noriega if his military government steals the election.
   Democrat Bob Graham and Republican Connie Mack, both of Florida,
along with Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez, spent Sunday as White House
observers at polling places in various parts of Panama.
   At an airport news conference, all three said they saw strong
evidence of irregularities, including soldiers allowed to vote
repeatedly, pre-marked ballots and padded voter lists.
   ``I believe the United States should now consider the use of
force in Panama,'' said Graham. ``We've tried economic sanctions,
which ... have had almost no effect on Noriega and the people who
keep him in power.''
   At a Washington news conference, Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, a
leader of anti-Noriega forces in exile, disagreed with Graham's
assertion that Noriega is as strong as ever.
   He said Noriega has been ``weakened tremendously'' since early
1988 and is now on the verge of being deposed.
   ``Overthrowing a dictator is a sometimes slow and painful
process. But the actions (by Noriega's opponents) have taken their
toll,'' he said.
   Sosa said he was encouraged by indications that many members of
the Defense Forces voted against Duque on Sunday. This reduces the
possibility that bloodshed will be required to end Noriega's rule,
he said.

   Government forces killed at least 23
communist guerrillas in clashes around the country, the military
reported Tuesday.
   It gave no casualties of its own during the battles, which it
said took place in the 24 previous hours.
   In the biggest fight, soldiers attacked a camp of the New
People's Army at dusk Monday in the mountain town of Vintar in
Ilocos Norte province about 250 miles north of Manila.
   The two sides fought in sporadic clashes that continued Tuesday,
the army said. It said at least nine rebels were killed and two
captured.
   In Quezon province, about 100 miles southeast of Manila,
soldiers killed three rebels and captured two Monday, another
military report said.
   On Mindanao island, about 530 miles southeast of Manila,
troopers searching for six soldiers captured by rebels fought
insurgents Monday on the outskirts of Properidad in Agusan del Sur
province and killed seven guerrillas, the army said.
   In neighboring Surigao del Norte province, soldiers killed four
rebels near Malimono on Monday, the military said.
   The guerrillas have fought for 20 years to overthrow the
government.

   Hank Williams Jr. got his airplane back
after his agents agreed to pay arena owners $65,000 to cover losses
when the country singer showed up for a concert but failed to make
it through a single song.
   Centroplex management got a court order holding the plane until
they were satisfied damages would be paid, said Michael M. Pierce,
director of the 11,000-seat arena.
   The plane was released Sunday afternoon. ``They were anxious to
get out of town,'' said Pierce.
   Angry fans in the Saturday night audience of about 7,000 threw
beer bottles and burned souvenir T-shirts and a Confederate flag
with Williams' picture on it after he stumbled offstage following
20 minutes of starting and stopping songs. Nobody was arrested and
nobody got hurt, police said.
   ``We don't want any hard feelings,'' said Williams spokesman
Kent Arwood, interviewed by telephone from his home in Nashville.
``It was just an unfortunate thing that occurred. It's not the norm
for this kind of thing to happen with Hank Williams Junior.''
   Arwood later said Williams told him somebody had slipped him
drugs.
   The spokesman said Williams told him he had several alcoholic
beverages before the concert, but remembered feeling fine. ``He
said, `I wasn't drunk on stage. I know what it's like to be drunk,
and I wasn't drunk,''' Arwood said.
   ``Hank said, `I know for a fact someone slipped me some drugs or
something. I had a problem with drugs years ago and I know that
feeling. That's obviously what happened,' '' the spokesman said.
   Arwood said earlier that the incident had nothing to do with an
incident last month in which Williams, voted entertainer of the
year three times by the Academy of Country Music, stormed offstage
40 minutes into a concert in Bristol, Tenn.
   Arwood said several times that Williams, 39, whose father died
in 1953 at age 29 from the effects of alcohol abuse, is not an
alcoholic and that he put the problem with pills behind him years
ago.

   Lily Tomlin's one-woman show, ``The Search for
Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe,'' won three Helen Hayes
awards Monday as the Washington theater world honored its best
productions.
   The Arena Stage, one of the nation's oldest regional theaters,
won five awards, including three for its production of the Luigi
Pirandello play, ``Six Characters in Search of An Author.''
   The Arena staging was best resident production and Rumanian
director Liviu Ciulei was chosen outstanding director for his
staging of the surrealist play. It also won for outstanding
lighting.
   Tomlin's touring show was named outstanding non-resident
production and the actress was picked outstanding lead actress.
Jane Wagner, the writer and director of Tomlin's show, won the
award as outstanding director for a non-resident production.
   Texas playwright Larry L. King won the outstanding new play
honor for ``The Night Hank Williams Died,'' a current off-Broadway
hit in New York that premiered last year at the New Playwrights'
Theater.
   The New York Shakespeare Festival production of ``Wenceslas
Square,'' by the late Washington writer Larry Shue, was honored for
outstanding actor, Victor Garber, and outstanding supporting
performer, Bruce Norris.
   Arena's final two awards came for its adaptation of the 1920s
Marx Brothers musical, ``The Cocoanuts,'' which was picked as the
city's top musical. Charles Janasz, who played Harpo Marx, was
chosen outstanding musical actor.

<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Televison evangelist Jim Bakker relaunched
his television ministry on Monday from a nearly deserted shopping
center on the outskirts of this central Florida city.
   Bakker, his wife and co-host Tammy, and a handful of followers
wasted no time to videotape a prayer of thanks for the ``miracle''
of their new home, the little-used South Orlando Shoppers World.
   ``Orlando seems like it's the crossroads of the world,'' Bakker
told reporters inside the vast, empty space filled with loose wires
and dangling pipes. ``The thing I like about it is it's a place
where it seems like everyone is welcome.''
   The only other tenants at the partially boarded-up, faded
shopping center are two bars and a Far East import store.
   At one of the bars _ Nasty Ed's Pub _ the clientele squinted
through windows to see their new neighbors.
   Bakker, 49, is free on $50,000 bond while awaiting federal trial
on 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy. He is charged with stealing
millions of dollars from PTL, the television ministry he founded.
   Bakker was ousted from PTL in 1987 after revelations that he had
a liaison with a church secretary and paid her with ministry money
to keep her quiet.
   American Shopping Centers Inc. owner Stuart Gilman, whose
company controls the strip mall, said the Bakkers have leased a
department store space and had the right to use the remainder of
other unleased space.
   Neither Bakker nor Gilman gave further details of the lease.
   The Bakkers said they rented a home nearby and hope to
eventually buy the entire 90,000-square-foot shopping center. They
said they also hoped to buy between 2,000 and 10,000 acres in the
region for a religious theme park.
   ``I believe there's great religious tolerance here,'' said
Bakker.
   A single protester at the shopping center, however, wanted no
part of it.
   Frankie Skinner, 23, of Orlando, marched around the mall
carrying a sign that read: ``Just Say No. Keep Our City Clean.''
   ``I think it's so wrong,'' Ms. Skinner said of the Bakkers' move
to Orlando. ``They shouldn't get another chance.''
   The move is the latest development in the Bakkers' odyssey to
find a new home for their embattled television ministry.
   The Bakkers spent the last five weeks at the Lake George
Ministries Retreat, a 29-acre compound east of the north Florida
town of Ocala. From the camp, the Bakkers and about 25 cast and
crew members taped several installments of ``The Jim and Tammy
Show.''
   During that time, the couple has been shopping for a permanant
spot for their television ministry.
   The Bakkers came to Florida after running into zoning problems
while taping their program at a rented home near Charlotte, N.C.
   The long-term goal, according to the Bakkers, is to bring
central Florida something similar to Heritage USA, the sprawling
Christian theme park in Fort Mill, S.C.

released from prison Monday.
   Orlandi, 64, left the Justice Palace with his lawyers after the
decision was handed down in federal court.
   Orlandi's sentence of three years and nine months was the
lightest passed on the five former commanders of the regimes that
ruled between the March 1976 coup against President Isabel Peron
and the election in October 1983 of President Raul Alfonsin.
   The other four, including ex-presidents and ex-army commanders
Jorge Videla and Roberto Viola, remain at Magdalena military
prison, 60 miles southeast of the capital, Buenos Aires.
   At lest 8,961 Argentines were arrested by security forces, never
seen again and presumed executed between 1976 and 1983, according
to a commission appointed by Alfonsin. Human rights groups say the
total could be twice as high.
   Agosti still faces separate charges stemming from his
participation in the 1976 coup.

<TEXT>
   The 150-member Association of Polish Air
Traffic Controllers began a protest action Monday seeking higher
wages and modernization of radar equipment.
   Three controllers, speaking for the group, said a
work-by-the-rules slowdown started with takeoffs allowed only at
10-minute intervals and lengthening of the distance between planes
coming in to land.
   In the first significant strike since the April 5 agreement
between the government and Solidarity union, workers at four copper
mines remained off the job.
   Negotiations continued Monday with the workers whose four-day
strike has cut ore production by 100,000 tons daily, the state PAP
news agency reported.
   Warsaw television said the strike, by about 20,000 miners, has
spread to copper mine employees working in Warsaw on the city's
subway system.
   The Solidarity Information Service said about 6,000 strikers
were occupying the four mines near Lubin.
   The strikers are seeking a 50 percent increase in pay that now
averages between $118 and $176 per months.
   Solidarity, suspended in December 1981 and subsequently
outlawed, was restored as a legal union under the April 5 accord in
which Communist authorities also agreed to political and electoral
reforms.
   The strikes began Friday at the four mines that produce most of
Poland's copper. Copper exports to the West in 1987 amounted to
$233 million, according to the government's Statistical Yearbook.
   The three air traffic controllers, speaking with the condition
they not be identified, said the controllers were on a ``strike
alert.''
   They said the protest action began because the the controllers
did not receive a satisfactory response to repeated requests for
improvements in equipment and pay.
   Flights in and out of Warsaw were running up to 40 minutes
behind schedule because of the job action, the controllers said.
   Zbigniew Dabkowski, director of commercial cargo for Poland's
LOT Air Lines, said, ``I don't think it affects us to such a degree
that anybody would want to comment on it. Talks continue.''
   The controllers said a letter was sent last month to Prime
Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski complaining of the ``deterioration
over a number of years'' in the air traffic control system.
   They said that old, unreliable radar and the decline in wages
compared to the 80-percent inflation rate has caused a number of
controllers to leave the service and forced others to take second
jobs.
   Controllers now earn an average $147 per month with overtime, or
about the national average, according to the three.
   They said the controllers are seeking salaries ranging from
about $220 per month for assistant controllers to $470 montly for
senior supervisors.

   About 1,000 people crowded into a church Monday
night to pay tribute to Lucille Ball in one of three memorial
Masses scheduled across the nation at an hour when Americans ``were
used to being with Lucy.''
   ``This is really not a requiem Mass,'' the Rev. James Fox told
those gathered for the Roman Catholic Mass at St. Ignatius Loyola.
``It's a Mass of thanksgiving, of gratitude for a life that was
full and brought joy to millions.''
   A memorial Mass was also held in Chicago, and another began in
the Los Angeles suburb of Santa Monica. All three Masses were set
to begin at 8 p.m. local time.
   The 77-year-old star of ``I Love Lucy'' died April 26, eight
days after heart surgery.
   ``We all grew up with her,'' the Rev. John Cusack, assistant
pastor at Old St. Patrick's Church in Chicago, said before the
service celebrated by the Rev. Jack Wall. More than 200 fans, young
and old, came to say goodbye to the actress known for her red hair
and whacky humor.
   Broadcaster Diane Sawyer, invited to speak by Miss Ball's
family, said in New York that Miss Ball ``united us in the
redeeming act of laughter.''
   ``I can't remember a thing about my real life compared to what I
remember about the Ricardos. I can remember where every stick of
furniture was in their apartment,'' Miss Sawyer said.
   Elizabeth Varanda, a 33-year-old fan of Miss Ball, said she was
``crazy about Lucy.''
   ``I liked her so much. I felt like I lost a personal friend,''
she said.
   ``Monday night was the time when most of the nation was used to
being with Lucy,'' Miss Ball's family said in a statement
announcing the services.
   Two of the three long-running comedy shows in which Miss Ball
starred, ``The Lucy Show'' and ``Here's Lucy,'' aired Monday
nights, while ``I Love Lucy'' had starting times on Monday and
other days as well.
   Fox said Miss Ball's family ``wanted to have an opportunity for
Lucille's fans to express their gratitude for Lucy. They wanted to

   In Santa Monica, fans began lining up four hours before services
at St. Monica's Catholic Church were to begin and the more than 900
seats in the church were filled an hour before.
   Electricians wired speakers for those unable to get inside the
church, and florists delivered flower arrangements, including a
3-foot-square red carnation heart with the words ``I Love Lucy''
written across.
   ``My children grew up watching her,'' said Lucie Nye, 69, of
Santa Monica, a fan and church parishioner. ``I thought of how
people really love her ... People are trying to say, well, she gave
us something, she's a part of everyone's life.''

   Men in civilian clothes firing
automatic rifles broke up a march on Monday by thousands of people
who were alleging massive election fraud. At least three people
were wounded.
   About 15,000 people joined the march to protest raids by Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega's soldiers, who witnesses said seized
thousands of vote tally sheets and prevented Sunday's presidential
election from being tabulated.
   ``I hope there will be a worldwide outcry against this dictator
stealing this election from his own people,'' said former President
Jimmy Carter, an invited observer.
   Polls closed at 5 p.m. Sunday, but it was not until 3 p.m.
Monday that the government said it received any votes to count.
   Opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara and
government candidate Carlos Duque both claimed victory. The new
president is to take office Sept. 1.
   Duque, Noriega's hand-picked candidate, said he was leading by
207,121 to 186,487 with 43 percent of the vote counted.
   Carter cited an exit poll by the Roman Catholic church as a
reliable indicator that Duque had lost by about 3-to-1.
   Carter said the government was in the process of creating
counterfeit tallies to replace those stolen by Noriega's soldiers
during the night.
   Noriega as Defense Forces chief is Panama's de facto ruler.
   Ricardo Arias Calderon, the opposition's vice presidential
candidate, declared, ``The government is confessing that it lost
the elections by seizing the tallies across the nation.''
   President Bush met with top advisers in Washington on Monday to
weigh what steps America should take next in its efforts to oust
Noriega. An administration official who spoke on condition of
anonymity said one possibility is to reinforce the U.S. military
presence in the Canal Zone to protect U.S. citizens.
   A delegation of official U.S. observers in Panama declared the
election fraudulent.
   Duque denounced what he called ``obvious American intervention
in affairs that only concern Panama and the abuse by observers of
Panamanian hospitality.''
   The attack on the demonstration seriously injured a TV
cameraman. A reporter for the French newspaper Le Monde and a
marcher were slightly hurt.
   The assault came as the two-hour march was breaking up near the
Electoral Tribunal. Endara and other leaders had already left when
a car bearing a large Duque poster drove into the crowd.
   Demonstrators threw stones, but the crowd scattered when the men
inside the car fired in the air. Troops nearby also began firing in
the air, and the men leaped from their car, firing AK-7 assault
rifles, carbines and shotguns.
   One, asked if he was military or civilian, replied: ``We are
from the people.''
   After the incident the crowd moved back about 500 yards and
started building bonfires in the street. Caravans of cars belonging
to rival party members drove through the city, some occupants
firing weapons in the air. Barricades of stones or rubbish burned
in some neighborhoods.
   The march, led by Endara, began near the city center and headed
for the eastern part of town.
   ``The people are going to defend their victory!'' Endara
declared. ``The people will rule.''
   The crowd surged around the heavily guarded Electoral Tribunal
building but moved back when Endara said he wanted to avoid a clash
with riot police.
   Noriega was indicted on federal drug trafficking charges last
year in Florida. Washington imposed economic sanctions, supported
anti-government leaders and reportedly gave $10 million to the
opposition election campaign.
   Noriega, who denies the drug charges, accused the United States
of conspiring with the opposition to oust him.
   The official delegation of election observers sent by Bush said
Noriega's soldiers intimidated voters and carried out widespread
fraud. They said they witnessed fraud firsthand, watching
individual Panamanian Defense Forces soldiers voting in more than
one precinct in the capital area Sunday.
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., an observer who left early Monday, said
in Miami the United States ``should now consider the use of force
in Panama.''
   The Panamanian Committee for Human Rights, which invited 279
observers from 21 nations, also condemned the election as
fraudulent.
   Before Monday's raids by soldiers, the opposition had also
charged during Sunday's voting that soldiers voted more than once
and that there were 100,000 extra names on voter rolls.
   In the Panama City suburb of San Miguelito, where Carter had
praised voting procedures the day before, troops arrived at 3 a.m.
and dispersed poll workers with gunshots and beatings.
   ``They knew the government had lost,'' said opposition poll
watcher Marcos Herrera. Tally sheets left behind and scattered
across the ground were viewed by The Associated Press, and overall
they showed a 3-1 margin for Endara.
   ``Obviously, if 120,000 votes were to disappear as a result of
violence, it would be difficult to assume this was an honest
election,'' said Fernando Suarez Gonzalez, a Spanish member of a
parliamentary observer group.
   San Miguelito served as the counting center for 120,000 of
Panama's 1.18 million registered voters.
   A spokesman for the election board, Boris Moreno, only would say
that no official complaints had been filed about events in San
Miguelito.
   In the Panamanian system, ballots for each precinct are counted
at the polls and then burned to prevent recounts. Tally sheets
listing the vote totals are then taken to a counting center.
   The opposition coalition said in a statement it had managed to
obtain figures from 1,039 of the nation's 4,255 precincts, many of
them in its own strongholds.
   The figures showed Endara with 174,510 votes to Duque's 59,729,
with 21,857 blank ballots.

   Nicaragua's foreign minister said Monday that
President Bush doesn't have Ronald Reagan's ``gut commitment'' to
destroy the Sandinista government and there are hopes for better
relations with the United States.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Miguel d'Escoto said
he felt Bush is more pragmatic than former President Reagan.
   ``(With) Bush at least I don't think there's the degree of gut
commitment to the destruction of the (Sandinista) revolution,''
d'Escoto said, speaking in English.
   He said he also was ``led to have some optimism on the fact that
(Secretary of State) James A. Baker III I think is a pragmatic
man.'' He said Baker does not differ ideologically from Reagan's
secretary of state, George P. Shultz, but he believed Baker is in
the presidential ``inner circle'' and Shultz was not.
   D'Escoto, who is accompanying Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega
on a 10-nation Western European tour, said Reagan ``was a man with
a pathological obsession about Nicaragua. I really think it can
only be described as that.
   ``Then he (Reagan) got himself into this so much that there was
no coming back because of a fear to lose credibility.''
   Ortega conferred with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on
Monday, and a British source said Mrs. Thatcher told him she was
disappointed by his government's lack of progress toward democracy.
   Ortega said Mrs. Thatcher did not promise any financial aid for
Nicaragua and he said, ``We didn't have much hope for that.''
   Later, at a rally in the Central Hall Westminster, Ortega told a
rally attended by about 2,500 cheering supporters that he was ``not
asking favors of anyone.''
   ``If I were to draw up the balance sheet of the sum of all the
wealth that market-oriented, developed countries have extracted
from all third countries of the world, all of our foreign debt
would be paid off and they would still owe us,'' he said.
   Ortega was introduced by novelist Graham Greene who said,
``Let's look at the darkness in our own country and not an
imaginary darkness in your own republic.''
   About 50 opponents of the left-wing Sandinistas gathered outside
the building and engaged in a shouting exchange with Ortega's
backers. Police kept the two groups apart but reported three
arrests.
   D'Escoto said the United States, which recently extended its
trade embargo against Nicaragua, ``is not really helping''
relations.
   He said the only positive sign was the U.S. decision to allow
Nicaragua to replace seven of its diplomats kicked out by the
Reagan administration in retaliation for the ouster of seven U.S.
diplomats 10 months ago. The Sandinistas accused the American
envoys of fomenting unrest.
   Nicaragua insists on respect from the United States, the foreign
minister said. ``All that we are asking for is a new type of
relationship with the States, in other words we want to be friends,
and their response is, `Who in the heck are you to be friends with
the United States?
   ``I believe with the United States it's a question of time,'' he
added.
   Ortega, after his 75-minute meeting with Mrs. Thatcher, said,
``It was a very frank conversation. We were both frank and direct.''
   He told reporters that Mrs. Thatcher's status as a world leader
``allows her to be ... able to contribute so that the problems
which exist between the United States and Nicaragua can be
overcome.''
   The British source, speaking on the condition he not be
identified, said the prime minister ``did not make any promises''
on that issue.
   Mrs. Thatcher expressed ``doubts about Nicaragua's commitment to
democracy,'' according to the British source.
   Ortega this year signed an agreement with four other Central
American presidents in which he promised electoral and other legal
reforms to ensure fair elections, set for February. But last week,
his government rejected an opposition demand to negotiate reforms.
   Ortega and his delegation leaves Tuesday for West Germany and
then Ireland before returning home.

   A member of a drug-smuggling cult accused in
the ritual mutilation-slayings of 15 people along the U.S. border
said he shot to death the gang's ``Godfather'' at the ringleader's
behest when police closed in.
   ``He said to kill him because if I didn't it was going to go
very badly for me in hell,'' Alvaro de Leon Valdez, 22, told a news

   De Leon had killed cult leader Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo and
right-hand man with a machine gun as police surrounded the Mexico

   De Leon Valdez, along with four other people including
24-year-old Sara Maria Aldrete Villarreal, described by authorities
as the ``witch'' of the cult, were arrested after Saturday's

   A May storm dumped nearly a foot of snow on parts of the East
and left marathon runners in Pittsburgh battling rain, wind and
snow flurries. The South, meanwhile, dealt with the aftermath of
storms that killed 23 people.
   Snow was falling in western New York early today, breaking
80-year-old records for this time of year. In Ohio, snow fell in
Cincinnati on Sunday for the first time in May in nearly a century.
Frost and freeze advisories extended over Michigan to South
Carolina today.
   The waters of the James River in Virginia overflowed their banks
and flooding was reported today in Richmond, the effects of a
tornado-laced storm system that swept across the South beginning
Thursday night.
   In all, the thunderstorms and tornadoes were blamed for the
deaths of seven people in Texas, five in Virginia, five in North
Carolina, three in Louisiana, two in South Carolina and one in

   Exxon stalled in its response to the
Alaska oil spill and gave bad information, the state's top
environmental official told congressional investigators.
   The five-member subcommittee of the U.S. House Interior
Committee also heard from fishermen who said they fear their
multimillion-dollar catch in Prince William Sound will be reduced
this season to protect seafood lovers from the effects of the spill.
   ``We've been told, we've been emphatically told, that we're
going to have a normal fishery this summer. We're going to have
anything but a normal fishery,'' Ken Adams of the Cordova District
Fishermen United said Sunday.
   Dennis Kelso, commissioner of the state Department of
Environmental Conservation, said Exxon's response was ``reluctant
and myopic, characterized by stalling techniques, disinformation,
and a refusal to pay real attention to damage outside of Prince
William Sound.''

   Just about everybody in the Democratic Party
seems pleased at the prospect that Jesse Jackson might run for
mayor of Washington in 1990 _ and not for president of the United
States in 1992.
   ``It's a great idea from a Democratic point of view, a strategic
point of view, and for Jesse and the city,'' said Donna Brazile, a
political consultant who has worked for Jackson and other
Democratic presidential candidates.
   After two groundbreaking presidential campaigns that altered
Democratic politics, Jackson is tantalizing party leaders with
hints he might forego a third campaign and run instead for mayor of
Washington. He has said he would consider the race only if his
friend Marion Barry does not seek re-election.
   ``It's a win-win-win situation, for everybody except Mayor
Barry,'' said Al From, executive director of the Democratic
Leadership Council, a group of moderate Democrats, many of them
Southerners.

   Hoping to rebuild the ancient Jewish Temple
where Islamic shrines now stand, a group of Israeli rabbis is
compiling computerized lists of potential priests, weaving seamless
linen robes and reproducing a gem-studded breastplate described in
Exodus.
   The plan would place the Temple altar on what some
ultra-religious Jews believe is its historical site. The spot is
where the gold-topped Dome of the Rock now stands, a Jerusalem
landmark and one of the holiest sites of Islam.
   The seemingly irreconcilable claim by Arabs and Jews to the
area, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Arabs as Haram Al
Sharif or ``Noble Enclosure,'' is one of the most emotional issues
of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Any attempt by Israel to reclaim it would be certain to stir
tensions throughout the Moslem world. The government does not
support the rabbis' plan to rebuild the Temple.
   ``All Jewish history as far as we're concerned is one big
parenthesis until the Temple is returned,'' said Rabbi Nahman
Kahane of the Temple Institute.

<HEAD>John Hurt: What's All the Fuss About?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The scandal about ``Scandal'' is much
overblown, declares John Hurt, star of the movie about naughty
goings-on among the high and mighty in 1960s England.
   The British actor was recently in Los Angeles for the opening of
the film, and he termed the fuss over its X rating ``a storm in a
teapot.''
   ``The scene that was allegedly the demon was what we call `the
orgy scene,'' he said. ``It was certainly not a sexy scene. It was
really a rather tawdry, nasty scene behind closed doors with a
particular tired old (upper) class.
   ``It was directly opposite to what the protagonists, Christine
Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davis represent, the `Swinging '60s.' It was
a different kind of permissiveness.''
   ``Scandal,'' which concerns the sex revelations that helped
topple Harold Macmillan's Tory government, was handed an X rating
by the Motion Picture Association of America's rating's board.
After making a few snips from the orgy scene, the film was rated R.
An X would have meant box-office death _ few bookings, fewer ads.
   Hurt viewed the film before and after the cuts and concluded:
``It says the same thing. Apparently somebody took exception to
what is known as `rocking motion.' The `rocking motion' went, and
something else was put in its place.''
   The reaction in England to ``Scandal'' was something else. ``We
had quite a lot of flak for making the film. The Establishment
somewhat closed ranks, really. What I call `the poor old Jack
syndrome' came up. `Why drag him through it again?'
   ``Which is understandable, I suppose, but most of the criticisms
were made by people who hadn't read the script or certainly seen
the film. That's not surprising, I suppose, because they may have
thought that we were making some kind of specious movie. Which is
not the outcome at all.''
   ``Poor Old Jack'' is John Profumo, Britain's former minister of
war, a married man who was bedding Keeler at the same time she was
having an affair with a Soviet naval attache and suspected spy.
   ``I can't say that we did (Profumo) a favor, but I think the
film has put him in a different light,'' Hurt said. ``Our
perception is different from the public's perception at the time,
largely gleaned from the sensationalist press.''
   Hurt portrays the late Stephen Ward, an osteopath who was
charged with pimping for his celebrity clients.
   ``I think it's pretty clear from the evidence that he was a
scapegoat,'' the actor said.
   With his gaunt face and intense manner, John Hurt has made a
specialty of difficult portrayals. The most notable was the title
role in ``Elephant Man,'' which drew an Academy nomination as best
actor.
   ``Robert DeNiro would do something like `Raging Bull' the same
year,'' Hurt said about the actor who won the prizethat year.
   He was the mad emperor Caligula in ``I, Claudius,'' and the
eccentric homosexual Quentin Crisp in ``The Naked Civil Servant.''
   In ``Champions,'' he was a famed jockey who conquered cancer,
the inmate of a Turkish prison in ``Midnight Express'' _ for which
he received an Oscar nomination as supporting actor, and the
homosexual cop in ``Partners'' with Ryan O'Neal.
   Hurt moves smoothly between the London and New York stage,
television and films. Surprisingly for a stage-trained actor, he
prefers movies.
   ``If I were told that I could only do one medium and had to cut
the rest out, I think I would choose film,'' he said.

<HEAD>Iran a Killing Ground of Executions Since Cease-Fire With Iraq</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Since its cease-fire with Iraq, Iran has
become a killing ground of executions.
   Hundreds of people _ some say thousands _ have been put to death
in purges that reflect political turmoil inside Iran since the
fighting stopped in the Persian Gulf in August.
   It is the biggest wave of executions in Iran since 1980-81, when
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's loyalists turned on their leftist and
secular allies who helped topple Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in the
1979 Islamic revolution.
   Fears mount that a growing outcry against ``liberals'' and the
power struggle within the Tehran hierarchy indicate that more
executions are likely.
   The radical newspaper Jomhuri Islami said in a recent editorial:
``The liberals are in conflict with the revolution.
   ``Why have they been left ... to infiltrate every place they
want to carry out wicked acts? ... The snakes are in their holes
and waiting to release their poison.''
   Among those executed were followers of Ayatollah Hussein Ali
Montazeri, the most prominent of the so-called moderates, who was
ousted in March as Khomeini's successor as Iran's spiritual leader.
He had called for a halt to the executions, wider freedoms and
openly criticized the shortcomings of the 1979 Islamic revolution.
   Many who were executed were middle-ranking Islamic clerics,
including Hojatoleslam Omid Najafabadi, a former revolutionary
judge. They were described by Intelligence Minister Mohammad
Rey-Shahri as ``psuedoclergymen ... involved in various political,
moral and corrupt offenses.''
   The purges appear aimed at eliminating dissident or outlawed
factions opposed to Khomeini in the postwar era or deemed to be too
liberal for the new radicalism.
   The Iraqi-based Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors who
make up the main anti-Khomeini opposition movement, claim that more
than 12,000 political prisoners have gone to their deaths at the
hands of the state in the last six months. It has given out the
names of 1,600 it says have been victims.
   The United Nations, Amnesty International and the U.S. State
Department estimate that about 1,000 political prisoners have been
executed, although they acknowledge that the true figure is
probably far higher.
   Iranian officials deny the dissidents' claim. But the official
media have reported that scores of ``counterrevolutionaries'' have
been publicly executed since August.
   The media have also reported nearly 550 alleged drug smugglers
have been hanged from mobile cranes and expressway overpasses in a
score of cities under a new anti-narcotics law that makes the death
sentence mandatory for possession of even small amounts of drugs.
   The Mujahedeen rebels claim Tehran has sought to mask the purge
of dissidents by claiming that many of those executed without trial
were drug smugglers.
   The rebels alleged that 200 people it said were executed in the
western city of Hamedan in recent weeks as smugglers were
dissidents.
   Reports persist of mass executions in Iranian prisons. Some
dissident accounts claim that hundreds of prisoners, some of them
held without trial for years, were blown up, while other groups
were gassed.
   Khomeini's supporters say that the deposed Montazeri was
politically naive and allowed himself to become the mouthpiece for
opponents of the regime.
   But diplomats and other analysts believe Montazeri was
reflecting growing uneasiness among many Iranians about the
direction the Islamic revolution had taken.
   With the radical resurgence, Interior Minister Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi has called for a purge of ``so-called liberals'' and
``the enemies of Islam'' in Iran.
   Tehran newspapers have been echoing the outcry against the
``liberals,'' believed to include Mehdi Bazargan, the Islamic
Republic's first prime minister.
   He resigned in 1979 in protest of the storming of the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran and the taking of its staff hostage. Since then
he has led Iran's token opposition party despite constant
harassment and was becoming increasingly close to Montazeri.
   Iran's military has not escaped the purge. Senior Iranian
officials claimed in April that several networks of U.S. spies had
been smashed within the military.
   They allegedly included senior figures in the navy and army,
long distrusted because of their links with the shah, and even the
Foreign Ministry, whose officials have been branded as too
pro-Western.

<HEAD>Pirates Kill Hundreds of Vietnamese Boat People</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pirates have killed scores if not
hundreds of Vietnamese boat people this year in Southeast Asian
waters. Children have been clubbed into the sea, women and young
girls have been raped or abducted and men have been shot or beaten,
according to official accounts.
   ``The level of violence, the viciousness, of attacks has gone up
... even though the number of attacks has gone down,'' a Western
aid official said.
   The pirate attacks began with the flight of Vietnamese from
their homeland with the communist takeover in 1975 but in recent
years they had been in decline.
   Generally the pirates are after the refugees' possessions, which
sometimes include gold or other valuables.
   On April 16, pirates off Malaysia set fire to a refugee boat and
killed 130 Vietnamese in a rampage of rape, shootings and
clubbings, relief officials in Malaysia said.
   Survivors of other attacks have told of scores of people
drowning in single attacks as the pirates rammed Vietnamese boats
and used hammers, sticks and other objects to beat adults and
children back into the water when they tried to cling to pirate
boats.
   More than 100 people are missing and presumed dead from two
attacks in March, according to the United Nations High Commissioner
For Refugees (UNHCR).
   On March 19, three pirate boats with about 15 crewmembers
attacked a boat with 46 Vietnamese on board. They abducted 10
women, then rammed the Vietnamese vessel until it capsized. A
passing vessel rescued the only known survivor.
   On March 25, pirates abducted as many as 30 women and children
after looting a boat with 58 Vietnamese on board. Armed with knives
and metal objects, the pirates beat the other passengers and threw
them overboard. A teen-age boy and an old man who floated to an oil
rig were the only known survivors.
   U.N. officials in Malaysia said they only recently learned of
the April 16 massacre from a lone survivor, a 22-year-old man they
identified as Pham Ngoc Minh Hung.
   They said he told them he fled Vietnam on April 14 on a
motorized wooden boat with about 130 refugees, including 20
children.
   Two days later, pirates from two boats boarded the vessel, shot
and killed its two pilots and its mechanic and raped some, if not
all, of the 15 to 20 women and girls as young as 12, a U.N.
statement said.
   Then the pirates set the boat ablaze.
   ``In the ensuing panic, many refugees grabbed buoys and
jerrycans and floats and plunged into the sea,'' the U.N. statement
added.
   The pirates ``used sticks to prevent refugees from clinging on
floating objects. Those who resisted were shot at.''
   Pham survived by clinging to dead bodies or other debris until
he was picked up by another refugee vessel 29 hours later.
   ``It is one of the worst incidents of piracy we have heard of,''
said Jean Marie Fakhouri, the U.N. refugees commissioner in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia's capital.
   Western officials say most pirates are Thais in the South China
Sea, the Gulf of Thailand and waters near Indonesia.
   Pirates have attacked Vietnamese boat people since they began
fleeing the communist takeover in April 1975. In recent years,
however, the attacks had been steadily decreasing with the
strengthening of a Thai anti-piracy program coordinated by the
UNHCR and funded by Western nations, mostly the United States.
   Some Western officials say the pirates were emboldened by the
official Thai government policy early last year of repelling boat
people from Thai shores as a deterrent to others. Aid officials
said more than 100 people were killed in such pushoffs from
Thailand, some in rammings by Thai fishermen authorities had asked
to help.
   Thailand claimed in April 1988 it had restored asylum for the
Vietnamese. But sources say authorities since then have sent
thousands of them away and directed them south to Malaysia. They
said at least one Vietnamese boat was attacked by pirates last year
after Thai authorities drove it away.
   ``Clearly anyone that wants to engage in (piracy) has to feel it
is easier to get away with it when the government is making the
kinds of statements they are making about refugees,'' said Shephard
Lowman, president of the U.S.-based voluntary group Refugees
International.
   Western officials said the Thai policy has prompted most boats
leaving Vietnam to sail south to Malaysia instead of east to
Thailand. They say that puts them in the waters beyond the patrols
of the anti-piracy vessels. It also forces them to spend a much
longer time at sea.
   Thai government officials would not commentd on the record, but
some dismissed the accounts by survivors as fabrications designed
to win sympathy and quicker resettlement in the West. They also
dismissed suggestions the government's policy had encouraged the
violence.
   Western officials believe that most assailants are ``pirates of
opportunity'' _ fishermen who chance upon Vietnamese boats and
cannot resist an easy plunder.
   In 1988, authorities arrested 21 suspected pirates. Fourteen
were found guilty and given sentences ranging from six to 50 years,
the maximum under Thai law.

   Japan's largest underworld syndicate, which has
21,000 members, has just named its new boss and said it plans a
formal installation. The police are scrambling to find out when and
where.
   Yoshinori Watanabe takes over as head of the Yamaguchi-gumi
syndicate, a post that had been vacant for more than four years
because of a gang war.
   Watanabe, 48, a muscular gangster known for his crew-cut and
violent bent, was annointed by 13 members of the syndicate's Elder
Brother Council in mid-April, according police in Kobe, a port city
in western Japan where the huge syndicate is based.
   A police official there said that following the council's
decision, more than 80 of the syndicate's top dons, who each
control a network of sub-gangs, met at central headquarters April
27 to give Watanabe their approval.
   The move was expected, but police hope jockeying for posts in
the new hierarchy may lead to disunity. They are closely watching
who will be appointed to executive ranks in the tightly knit empire.
   ``The day after they made their decision, we held a meeting to
discuss tightening our crackdown,'' said Takashi Ishii, assistant
director of the National Police Agency's Organized Crime Control
Office.
   ``Right now we are trying to gather information on who will be
the new leaders under Watanabe, while trying to make sure the
gang's celebration is never held.''
   Watanabe heads the powerful Kobe-based Yamaken gang, which has
3,000 members, the largest single group within the Yamaguchi-gumi
organization. He is now facing charges involving an assault
committed in 1984. A verdict is expected May 26.
   ``If he goes to jail it will only be for a short time, maybe a
year, and won't effect his position as boss,'' said an underworld
source. He added that having lived through four years without a
boss, another year or so would pose no real problem for the gang.
Watanabe is free on bail.
   Watanabe is credited with single-handedly negotiating an end to
a conflict with the Ichiwa-kai gang and forcing its boss to retire.
Police reported more than two dozen deaths in 315 armed incidents
during the four-year battle, making it the bloodiest ever in
Japan's underworld.
   The Ichiwa-kai, which had 6,000 members at its peak, was created
in June, 1984, after an internal dispute over Yamaguchi-gumi
leadership led to a revolt. Fear of a similar split, and an equal
balance of power between Watanabe and Acting Boss Kazuo Nakanishi,
66, helped keep the gang from naming a new boss until Watanabe
ended the ``Yama-Ichi War'' in late March.
   In keeping with underworld custom, leaders of the gang hope the
Watanabe ceremony will usher in a new era and publicly reaffirm
their establishment status.
   ``It's an important matter of face for both the police and the
gang because the Yamaguchi-gumi wants to use the party to
demonstrate its power,'' said the underworld source. ``The police
want to stop them, or if they can't, force them to simplify the
ceremony.''
   When the last inauguration was held in Naruto on the southern
island of Shikoku in 1985, about 1,000 police surrounded the
meeting place but had no grounds to stop it. More than 300
gangsters, dressed in formal black suits or kimono, attended that
rite, part of which was televised. No incidents were reported.
   In most Japanese gangs, members have complex ``family''
relations created at elaborate ceremonies where participants sip
sake to seal their vows of fidelity. Through these rites, gangsters
develop intricate elder and younger brother relationships, and
dedicate their lives to their father, or boss.
   Police estimate overall gang membership in Japan at about 90,000
and say nearly half are affiliated with the three largest
nationwide syndicates _ the Yamaguchi-gumi, the Sumiyoshi Rengo and
the Inagawa-Kai.
   Japanese underworld operations range from extortion and illicit
gambling to the drug and sex trades. They are also often involved
in construction, real estate, money laundering and entertainment.
   Though the Yamaguchi-gumi's activities are primarily domestic,
police have said it has close relations with Taiwan's United Bamboo
gang, which allegedly produces stimulants for illicit sale in
Japan. Strict gun-control laws have also sent Japanese gangs abroad
in their search for weapons, many of which come from the United
States and the Philippines.
   National police officials say a full-scale expansion of Japanese
gangs abroad is constricted by the lack of large Japanese-speaking
communities and add that, aside from the gun and drug trade,
operations outside Japan often center on Japanese tourists.

<HEAD>Spain Hopes New U.S. Military Agreement Will End Bitter Era</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new agreement reducing the U.S. military
presence in Spain should bring an end to an era of sometimes bitter
relations between the two countries, Spanish officials say.
   ``We have to recover all this wasted time,'' said Leopoldo
Stampa, an adviser to Spain's defense minister. ``I am very
optimistic. We have to relaunch our relationship based on this.''
   Nuno Aguirre de Carcer, a former ambassador to the United
States, said, ``The end of negotiations brought a situation of
normality in the relations.''
   The agreement accepts a Spanish demand that the United States
withdraw a highly visible Air Force fighter wing from the Torrejon
Air Base on the outskirts of Madrid, the capital. The unit's 72
F-16s will be transferred over the next three years to southern
Italy.
   The United States also is allowed under the eight-year pact to
continue using three Spanish military bases and nine communications
posts.
   The agreement reduces the authorized maximum number of U.S.
troops from 12,545 to just over 8,000. About 4,000 are assigned to
the Torrejon base.
   The accord, replacing a five-year agreement, was recently
ratified by wide margins in both houses of the Spanish Parliament.
The two countries signed the texts of the new agreement in
December, ending several years of sticky bargaining.
   Carlos Miranda, director of international security affairs at
the Foreign Ministry, said the American decision to trim its forces
in Spain was regarded by the public as ``a kind of test.''
   Spaniards, he said, ``have seen after this agreement that the
United States is a country with which you can talk on equal terms.''
   The new levels set for U.S. personnel represent, he said, ``what
both countries feel is needed but not something imposed from
Washington to Spain.''
   The Spanish demand for removal of the 401st Tactical Air Wing
had angered U.S. officials, who were worried about finding a new
location and paying for the move at a time of budget austerity.
   Moreover, Spain was seen as shirking its responsibility as a
member of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The
F-16s comprise a crucial part of U.S. front-line striking power in
Europe and are assigned to the defense of NATO's southern flank
along the Mediterranean Sea.
   Italy has agreed to take the wing. The relocation expenses will
be picked up by NATO, except for housing and recreational costs for
American troops.
   In demanding the removal of the jets, officials said the
Socialist government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez was
responding to public pressure.
   In a March 1986 referendum, a majority of Spaniards voted to
remain in NATO _ but with conditions. These included keeping Spain
out of NATO's integrated military structure, maintaining a ban on
nuclear weapons on its territory and reducing the U.S. military
presence. Spain joined NATO in 1982.
   The United States was given the right to use Spanish bases under
a military cooperation agreement first signed in 1953 during the
authoritarian regime of Gen. Francisco Franco.
   Many Spaniards still associate the U.S. military arrangement
with Franco and argue it gave support and legitimacy to his regime.
   With the removal of the fighter wing, Spanish officials said
they have met the requirements of the 1986 referendum on reducing
the U.S. presence.
   ``There's no reason why there should be further reductions,''
said Stampa.
   The Foreign Ministry's Miranda agreed.
   ``The U.S. presence in Spain was excessive so there was no need
of having the kind of presence we had,'' he said. ``And this goal
has been attained.''
   In comparison with other West European countries, Spain has more
U.S. troops on its soil than Greece and Italy but fewer than
Britain and Germany.
   U.S. forces will remain at bases in Zaragoza, Moron and Rota.
   About 5,100 U.S. personnel are assigned to Rota, a naval base on
the Atlantic Ocean in southwestern Spain, mostly providing support
for the U.S. 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. No U.S. ships are
permanently stationed there.

<DATELINE>LAUGHARNE, Wales (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A few photos of Dylan Thomas, stuck on
the wall of the bar in Brown's Hotel, are all there is to tell the
visitor he has stumbled into the poet's adopted hometown.
   Laugharne has always been in two minds about Thomas, torn
between pride at being associated with a giant of 20th-century
poetry and the suspicion that he made the town a laughing stock.
   So while they don't disavow him, they certainly don't exert
themselves to publicize the connection either. That means no
souvenir stores, not even a sign directing visitors to his house or
grave.
   ``People are always surprised at this,'' says Tommy Watts, who
owns Brown's Hotel where the poet used to tipple the evenings away.
``They expect to find Dylan Thomas bookshops and Dylan Thomas
teacups.''
   Thomas spent his last four years in the little seaside town in
South Wales, living with his wife Caitlin and their three children
in the Boat House overlooking the bay.
   On the edge of the cliff above the wooden house is the work shed
_ ``my wordsplashed hut,'' he called it _ where he wrote such
memorable poems as ``Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night,''
``Poem on his Birthday'' and the comic verse play ``Under Milk
Wood.''
   Rumpled, impoverished and hard-drinking, Thomas embodied the
legend of the romantic, self-destructive poet, dying in New York in
1953 during the last of his three U.S. poetry-reading tours. He was
39.
   The Boat House _ ``My seashaken house on a breakneck of rock'' _
is a museum now. The hut, overlooking a forested slope that may
have been Thomas' fictional Milk Wood, is in danger of sliding off
the cliff and workmen are shoring up its foundations.
   The path to the house was renamed Dylan's Walk in 1976, which is
the only way you'd guess who once lived there.
   The living room is furnished with a tattered rug, an old radio
and overstuffed 1950s chairs in which visitors are encouraged to
relax and listen to recordings of Thomas reading his poems.
   Lorraine Scourfield, the curator, doesn't believe in the
do-not-touch approach.
   ``We want people to have the feeling that they're really coming
into his room,'' she said.
   Thomas would lie in bed with a cold or a hangover, feasting on
his children's candy and bleating mournfully to Caitlin for milk
and sugared bread. Most mornings he would amble over to the pubs,
then to the shed where, Caitlin later wrote, it was ``bang into
intensive scribbling, muttering, whispering, intoning, bellowing
and juggling of words.''
   Thomas liked to stand on the verandah, tossing bread crumbs to
the herons. After his death, his mother went through his clothes
and found crumbs in the pockets.
   As the tide went out one recent spring morning, a sand bank
glittered like mother of pearl in the sunshine. The town of 1,500 _
``a timeless, mild, beguiling island'' _ looks scrubbed and tidy
with its sun-bathing cats, lazy dogs and townfolk hurrying about
their business with brisk ``good mornings'' to each other.
   Dylan Thomas called Laugharne ``the strangest town in Wales,''
and it certainly is different. Laugharne's name rhymes with barn,
the mayor goes by the rare and ancient title of portreeve, and
wears a ceremonial chain of gold cockle-shaped medallions, in
tribute to what was once Laugharne's main industry.
   It is English-speaking in a predominantly Welsh-speaking region,
and regards the nearest neighboring town as a foreign country.
   People are generally reluctant to talk about Thomas.
   Watts, 57, says he generally tells curious visitors to go away,
but this day, he says, he's in a good mood.
   ``I remember him all right,'' he says. ``We used to throw stones
at him.''
   Why?
   ``Because he was a foreigner.''
   Thomas came from Swansea, 27 miles away.
   ``Dylan Thomas to local people doesn't mean much,'' says the
portreeve, Terry Thomas. ``They feel Laugharne was always here,
always will be, always had its local characters, and Dylan was one
of them.''
   In a letter, the poet called Laugharne ``the best town, the best
house, the only castle, the mapped, measured, inhabited, drained,
garaged, townhalled, pubbed and churched, shopped, gulled and
estuaried one state of happiness!''
   ``Under Milk Wood'' was a richly comic tribute to Laugharne's
eccentricities, and although the play is now performed in the town
every three years, Laugharne was less enthusiastic at the outset.
   ``At first I was angry, yes,'' said Watts. ``I thought, who does
this bloody man think he is, coming here and writing about us, all
that stuff about webfoot cocklewomen.''
   ``One lady was up in arms because she thought one of the
characters was her father. Now she's turned around. Now she tells
everybody, oh yes, that was my father.
   ``You see, time immortalizes everything. We're stuck with Dylan
Thomas whether we like it or not.''
   Thomas had been visiting Laugharne regularly since 1938, but
only in 1949 did he move in permanently after a friend, Margaret
Taylor, rented the Boat House to him. He wrote to her: ``This is
it: the place, the house, the workroom, the time. Here I am happy
and writing.''
   He moved his parents into Laugharne, and when his father was
dying, it inspired his most famous poem:
   ``Do not go gentle into that good night,
   ``Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
   ``Rage, rage against the dying of the light. ...''
   Young though he was, it could have been his own epitaph.
   His drinking was becoming uncontrollable. He and Caitlin fought
incessantly. Poverty, always his curse, was far more acute now with
three children to feed.
   ``I can't think. I'm cold, it's raining on the sea, the herons
are going home,'' he wrote.
   Nine days after his 39th birthday, he collapsed in a New York
City hotel. Four days later, on Nov. 9, 1953, he was dead.
   He lies now buried in Laugharne's churchyard, under a simple
wooden cross and a bed of wild primroses.

<HEAD>Ethical Line a Fine One for Lawmakers</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For a member of Congress, there's a thin line
between properly representing a constituent with a gripe against
the government and improperly twisting arms.
   Ethics monitors have been trying for generations to determine
how and where that line should be drawn. They haven't succeeded yet.
   The subject is once again at issue in the ethics case against
House Speaker Jim Wright, even though the House Ethics Committee
decided not to press charges over his heavy-handed intervention
with federal regulators on behalf of Texas savings and loan
interests.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., Wright's original accuser, says he
thinks the S&amp;L accusations will be revived if charges against the
speaker involving outside income and unreported gifts come to the
House floor for action.
   Gingrich said Wright's intercession led to delays in House
action while the problem worsened, and that the delays, in turn,
may have added $40 billion to the cost of settling the S&amp;L crisis.
   Both his points are hypothetical, but they illustrate the
problem a congressman can face when he takes up the cause of a
constituent who is having trouble with the federal government.
There's no telling where it might lead.
   Yet, for the member of Congress who wants to remain one,
intervening for constituents with problems is essential work. It is
part of the process of representing a district or a state. It also
is one of the ways Congress oversees the executive branch.
   From the missing Social Security check to the overzealous
regulator, that kind of intercession can solve problems. Besides,
this year's constituent with a problem solved becomes next year's
voter, donor, perhaps campaign volunteer.
   The trouble is that it is hard to determine who really is out of
bounds _ the constituent or the civil servant. A Senate panel tried
to set guidelines as far back as 1951, and wound up offering advice
instead of rules.
   ``A legislator should not immediately conclude that the
constituent is always right and the administrator is always
wrong,'' wrote Paul H. Douglas, the late Democratic senator from
Illinois, who headed that ethics subcommittee. He said the senator
or representative should investigate, try to determine the merits
of each case and proceed accordingly.
   That advice was cited by Richard J. Phelan, special counsel to
the House ethics committee, in his report recommending that Wright
be charged with improperly pressuring the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board in behalf of Texas savings and loan operators.
   A House ethics report in 1970 said members are in bounds when
they seek information about cases before executive or independent
agencies, arrange appointments, make judgments and ask for
reconsideration of decisions they think are not supported by law.
   The report also said the congressman's services should be
provided to all constituents on an equal footing, without regard to
politics or position; and that any suggestion of either favoritism
or reprisal against the agency involved ``is unwarranted abuse of
the representative role.''
   The Douglas subcommittee said pressure against federal agencies
through ``hostile action in budgets or legislation is a kind of
blackmail which is damaging to the public interest. ...''
   At the same time, the Senate panel said members of Congress
should intercede for their constituents so long as they do it with
proper restraint, ``for civil servants frequently become
perfunctory in their work and careless of the people whom they are
presumed to serve.
   ``Legislators can, therefore, legitimately serve as an informal
board of inspectors,'' the subcommittee said. ``They can prevent
administrators from flagging in their zeal and can detect and check
abuses in the conduct of public business.''
   But the panel saw ethical quicksand in efforts by members of
Congress to get favorable rulings for constituents in specific
cases. It said legislators should insist on fairness but shouldn't
try to force specific outcomes.
   That sounds simple. It isn't. When a government agency is ruling
on a case vital to an individual, a business or a group, the people
involved are likely to see fairness in only one outcome.
   In the end, the individual member of Congress has to decide
what's fair and proper. When those decisions come due, no rule book
can substitute for conscience and common sense.

<HEAD>After 33 Years of Legal Abortion, Some in Poland Want It Outlawed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abortion has been legal under communist
rule for 33 years in predominantly Roman Catholic Poland, but now
with conditions relaxed and open elections ahead there's talk of
outlawing it.
   At a recent meeting of Solidarity union activists preparing for
the elections, nominees were challenged on their positions on
abortion.
   In a television special, a parliament member suggests the
possibility of a nationwide referendum on the law that has made
abortions legal since 1956.
   A proposal submitted by 78 of the 460 members of the Sejm, as
parliament is called, would ban abortions altogether. It provides
for three-year jail terms for women who have them and the doctors
who perform them.
   Catholic church loyalists within the government alliance support
the ban, but it is opposed by the communist party leadership. There
are strongly religious strains against abortion within the
Solidarity-led opposition movement, while others in the movement
defend abortion as a personal matter.
   Abortion was legalized in Poland as part of a communist economic
and social policy unfettered by religious considerations or public
debate.
   Poland now has one of the world's highest rates of abortion,
with some estimates suggesting that more than half of all
pregnancies are terminated.
   The most recent statistics available record 605,500 births and
122,500 abortions in 1987, but the abortion figure does not count
the vast numbers performed in private doctors' offices. One
demographic study puts the total at 600,000 abortions a year and
church attacks on abortion have estimated 800,000 to 1 million
procedures annually.
   Since the abortion bill was submitted in the Sejm on Feb. 28,
the official press and television have carried lengthy discourses
on abortion and hundreds of abortion foes attended a Catholic Mass
and protest march, while opponents of the ban circulated petitions.
   The recent negotiations between Solidarity and the government
only touched on abortion, partly because of the divided opinion
within the union.
   Dr. Zofia Kuratowska, who leads the Solidarity side on health
issues, considers the proposed ban ``very repressive'' but says
that within the movement, ``people who are very strongly with the
Catholic church are not so strongly against (the ban) as I am.''
   Two Solidarity activists who are election candidates awkwardly
played both sides of the issue during a recent meeting _ opposing
the proposed law because of its stiff jail terms while agreeing
that abortion was wrong.
   The church is organizing anti-abortion drives in parishes and
outlining its opposition.
   ``The law legalizing abortion is the work of totalitarian ruling
of the Stalinist type, which has common ideological roots with
Nazism,'' said the Rev. Jerzy Bajda, an anti-abortion leader.
   ``Looking at the (1956) law from today's perspective, one should
say its aim could only be the moral and biological destruction of
the Polish nation.'' Jan Dobraczynski, a Catholic Sejm deputy and
head of the national patriotic group PRON, voted against the
abortion law in 1956 while one of the five non-party Sejm members
and is a leader in the fight now.
   ``From the moment the new law was in force ... it quickly became
more dangerous than it looked in theory,'' he said. ``The law
allowed abortion but set many social and economic conditions. Soon,
it gave doctors the freedom to do it without any justifications.''
   Opponents of the ban say that forbidding abortion after 33 years
would drive it underground, making it less safe and more costly.
   ``This proposed law is dangerous because we may return to the
secrecy of abortions,'' said Jan Mlynarski, a Warsaw hospital
physician. ``Some doctors will be making fortunes on it, but women
will only suffer.''
   Mlynarski added that most women seeking abortions give him
economic reasons: ``Women are afraid of what might happen with
their second or third child.''
   The impact of unplanned pregnancy takes on special poignancy
because couples often are hard pressed to support children with
whom they may be sharing two tiny rooms.
   The wait for an apartment is a decade or more for young couples.
The housing crisis and poor economic conditions have an deep impact
on decisions to have children.
   Married women in Poland work out of economic necessity, if not
professional reward, but child and essential family care remains
their responsibility.
   Banning abortion would ``accelerate the pauperization of
millions of women who are already the most burdened part of our
society,'' a group of intellectuals wrote in a women's magazine.
   The government-backed Polish Women's League has also spoken out.
   ``We oppose the assumption included in the draft (law) that the
woman is to bear all legal responsiblitiy for abortion, which
contradicts the legal acts that provide for women's and men's
equality in rights and duties,'' league secretary Elzbieta
Dehnel-Luszczynska told the state news agency PAP.

<HEAD>Divided at Home, Lebanon Speaks With One Voice at U.N.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In Lebanon, two rival governments _ one
Christian, the other Moslem _ battle each other for power, but at
the United Nations Lebanon speaks with one voice.
   The division raised questions at the United Nations over which
faction Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and other U.N.
officials should deal with.
   ``The secretary-general deals with the permanent representative
of Lebanon at the U.N.,'' said U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani.
That representative is Ambassador Rachid Fakhoury.
   But to whom does Fakhoury and all other Lebanese diplomats
around the world answer?
   ``Under a mutual understanding, without any public declarations,
the secretary-general of Lebanon's Foreign Ministry transmits
positions from both factions,'' said Clovis Maksoud, the Arab
League's ambassador to the United Nations and the United States.
   The secretary-general of the Foreign Ministry in Beirut, Farouk
Abilama, ``is the de facto foreign policy adviser for the divided
government, but this is being strained now, in the current
crisis,'' said Maksoud.
   ``There is no attempt on the part of the governments to
challenge the unity of the embassies or missions abroad, or to
embarrass them by getting them to take a factional position,'' he
added.
   Since there is no way the divided government could agree on
appointing any new ambassadors for overseas posts, the Lebanese
diplomatic corps has been frozen pending the outcome of the current
crisis.
   ``All embassies are getting a new lease on their tenure,'' said
Maksoud.
   ``The assumption is that this is a transitory stage, and
hopefully a short one.''
   Ambassador Fakhoury declined to be interviewed.
   Lebanon's U.N. mission consists of four diplomats, two
Christians and two Moslems who, from all indications, work together
amicably.
   Arab League mediators have tried to arrange a cease-fire to halt
the violence in Lebanon, which has claimed at least 278 lives since
March 8.
   Maksoud noted that a few key government institutions survive in
Beirut, the Central Bank in particular.
   ``The Central Bank pays for the expenses of both factions of
government impartially, and for the missions and embassies,'' he
said.
   The government crisis broke out Sept. 22, when the Christians
rejected Moslem nominees for president to succeed the outgoing
President Amin Gemayel, a Christian.
   Gemayal then chose Gen. Michel Aoun, commander of 20,000
Christian troops, to lead the government and the Moslem faction
picked Acting Prime Minster Salim Hoss to head the rival government.
   By tradition, Lebanon's president is Christian, the prime
minister a Sunni Moslem and the Parliament speaker a Shiite Moslem.
But this time, the Moslems wanted one of theirs to be president.

people killed. As the Pennsylvania mountain town prepares to
observe the 100th anniversary of the disaster, a 106-year-old woman
is the only survivor who still who recalls that terrible day, that
afternoon in May when her father burst into their home to warn,
``The dam has broken!''

   A century later, Elsie Frum remembers
vividly the steady, shrill whistle of warning and the horrifying
wall of water that killed 2,209 people in the Johnstown Flood of
1889.
   ``My father ran into the house and said, `Run! The dam has
broken!' And we ran. We just got out in time,'' Mrs. Frum recalls.
   ``It was terrible. It sounded like thunder. It took everything,
everything in front of it _ railroad engines, the roundhouse. It
took all the buildings. It looked like an ocean.
   ``Then there was nothing left. It was like a beach when it was
over. We just stood there and watched it. Everyone was stunned. We
didn't know what to do.''
   Mrs. Frum, 106 years old and a great-great-grandmother, is the
last known survivor who remembers the flood of May 31, 1889, the
first of three floods to devastate this western Pennsylvania
mountain city and nearby villages.
   One of the five worst natural disasters in U.S. history, the
Johnstown Flood of 1889 was caused by the collapse of the South
Fork Dam about 15 miles northeast and 450 feet above Johnstown.
   The 72-foot-high earthen dam held a private lake for the
exclusive summertime recreation of such 19th century industrial
barons as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick and Andrew Mellon.
Experts said later it was weakened by poor maintenance and
extraordinarily heavy rains of up to 10 inches in 24 hours.
   The dam's collapse sent a 35- to 80-foot surge of water racing
down the narrow Little Conemaugh River Valley, sweeping away
houses, barns, railroad cars and locomotives, telegraph poles,
livestock, people and nearly everything else before it hit
Johnstown at 4:07 p.m., 57 minutes after the dam broke.
   Then a budding industrial city of about 10,000 deep in a
bowl-like valley, Johnstown was already under several feet of water
from the rains.
   The mid-afternoon flood waters, pushing a roll of debris before
it, crashed into the city's busy steel mills, fragile wood-frame
homes and finally into its sturdy Pennsylvania Railroad bridge.
   ``Most of the people in Johnstown never saw the water coming;
they only heard it,'' historian David G. McCullough wrote in his
1968 book, ``The Johnstown Flood.''
   ``Those who actually saw the wall of water would talk and write
about how it `snapped off trees like pipestems' or `crushed houses
like eggshells,''' McCullough wrote. ``But what seemed to make the
most lasting impression was the cloud of dark spray that hung over
the front of the wave...It was talked of as `the death mist' and
would be remembered always.''
   Scores of stranded people floated on a huge jumble of wreckage
covering about 30 acres that jammed up at the stone railroad bridge
just below downtown. But the great pile caught fire and 80 helpless
victims died in a second horror.
   Clara Barton, then 67 years old and eager to promote her new
American Red Cross, rushed in from Washington, D.C., and set up
headquarters inside a boxcar.
   The new Red Cross helped organize field hospitals, kitchens and
laundries. Five months later, Johnstown's citizens bid her farewell
with a diamond locket and their grateful thanks.
   Mrs. Frum, then a 6-year-old schoolgirl, lived with her parents
and two younger sisters in East Conemaugh, just upriver from
Johnstown. Her father, John Shaffer, owned a planing mill next door.
   Mrs. Frum remembered her father was a nosy and nervous man,
especially about increasing rumors that the South Fork Dam was in
trouble.
   Shaffer had stepped outside in the rain to see if nearby wooden
bridges were still standing when, Mrs. Frum recalls, everyone heard
engineer John Hess' heroic warning whistle from the cab of
Pennsylvania Railroad Engine 1124.
   McCullough wrote, ``Hess in his engine blazed down the valley,
the water practically on top of him, in an incredibly heroic dash
to sound the alarm...Nearly everyone in East Conemaugh heard it and
understood almost instantly what it meant.''
   ``That was our Paul Revere,'' Mrs. Frum recalls. ``A man had
taken his train up and he was on the way down, and saw the dam had
broken. And he tied his whistle down. He jumped. He was saved. He
stayed on it till he got into Conemaugh.
   ``My father knew then that the dam had broken,'' she says.

   From the safety of a nearby hill, Elsie and her family saw
``everything just roll away.''
   ``We could see things tumbling around in the water,'' she says.
   Shaffer sent his family into the country for a week. When Elsie
returned, her father was building coffins for the dead brought to
the nearby United Methodist Church.
   ``I remember they brought the bodies there to wash, took them
across to the church and laid them across the top of the seats,''
Mrs. Frum says. ``They put a robe over them. He made the coffins to
bury them in. That's what I remember. I saw all that.
   ``It was horrible. I was scared to death of dead people.
   ``I remember the cleanup. Every time they would dig a place for
a home, they would find a body. And every time they would dig
anyplace, they would find something, you know, a body or
something.''
   Johnstown's dead were found miles past the stone bridge for
weeks. Debris was recovered as far away as Pittsburgh, about 75
miles to the west. The last body was discovered 15 years later.
   Many bodies could not be identified and 663 of the unknown were
buried in a common plot in nearby Grandview Cemetery three years
later.
   In terms of lives lost, the Johnstown Flood ranks as the second
worst natural disaster in U.S. history. A hurricane that hit
Galveston, Texas, in 1890 left 6,000 dead. The San Francisco
Earthquake of 1906 ranks fifth, with 500 killed.
   The nation's press sensationalized the tragedy, sometimes filing
false stories of heroism and looting. But the press also helped
mobilize quick national and international help for the stricken
area.
   Within days, trainloads of food, tents, clothing, lumber,
construction supplies, and even coffins, arrived. Cash
contributions from around the world totaled $3.7 million, according
to McCullough.
   Mrs. Frum remembers the relief efforts, the immediate rescue and
reconstruction activity.
   ``All kinds of food came in and all kinds of clothing,'' she
says.
   Later, fingers of blame were pointed at the millionaires' South
Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, which had allowed the dam at the
former reservoir to deteriorate. Several lawsuits were filed and,
without a lake, the club soon closed.
   But, McCullough reported, ``not a nickel was ever collected
through damage suits from the...club or from any of its members.''
   ``Every person was warned, oh, long before it broke,'' Mrs. Frum
says. ``Oh yes, they were warned. Every time it rained, they said
the dam was going to break and it didn't. And, of course, when it
happened, why, nobody thought it was going to happen and nobody ran
_ but us.''
   The Shaffers were lucky. The high water flooded their house and
they returned to live in it.
   But Mrs. Frum lost everything, including the contents of her
Johnstown home, on March 17, 1936, when a warm rain melted heavy
winter snows too quickly and the city suffered its second major
flood. The 1936 flood left 25 people dead and caused $41 million in
damage.
   Moving to a nearby suburb atop a mountain, Mrs. Frum missed
Johnstown's third great flood on July 22, 1977, when 11 inches of
rain fell in the area in nine hours. The 1977 flood left 80 people
dead and caused $350 million in damage.
   Mrs. Frum never left the Johnstown area and she has survived two
husbands. All of her 30 descendants are still alive.
   ``I have wondered, yes, a lot why I'm here,'' she says. ``I
guess it's just not time for me to go. I've gone through a lot. I
don't want another flood, I know that.''
   There have been other hard times for Johnstown. Stung by rapid
declines in the steel industry, Johnstown at one point in 1983 bore
the nation's highest unemployment rate, 26.6 percent, at the same
time it maintained the nation's lowest crime rate.
   The city, now about 35,000 people and slowly recovering
economically, has planned more than 100 commemorative and special
events this summer to mark the flood's 100th anniversary under the
slogan, ``A Triumph of the American Spirit.''
   ``The reason for the celebration is to show how the city has
been resilient, not only from the floods, but from the various
economic adversities,'' says Mayor Herbert Pfuhl Jr.
   Referring to survivors of the 1889 flood, Pfuhl says, ``I think
they'd be pleased with the changes and the progress that has
happened.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The Communist insurgency in the Philippines
appears to have weakened since a popular uprising toppled President
Ferdinand Marcos' authoritarian administration in February 1986.
But the rebels still number about 23,000 fighters, according to
government estimates, and last year more than 3,900 people were
killed in the fighting.

<TEXT>
   The recent killing of an American
colonel reflects a shift in strategy by Filipino Communist rebels
seeking to reverse setbacks suffered since President Corazon Aquino
took power three years ago.
   As part of the shift, the Communist Party of the Philippines is
reverting back to a rural-based strategy after the failure of an
urban campaign and is becoming more selective in recruiting after
military agents infiltrated its ranks.
   The rebels are also focusing on American influence, especially
the presence of six U.S. military installations, in a bid to gain
support in urban areas, where opposition to the bases is strongest.
The rebels have offered peace talks if the government agrees to
close the bases.
   They also took responsibility for the April 21 assassination of
Col. James N. Rowe of the Joint U.S. Military Advisory Group. A
rebel statement said the colonel was slain because of American
interference here.
   Assessing the strength of the rebellion is difficult, since most
activity takes place in remote areas where communications are poor.
Much of the information on rebel activity comes from the
163,000-member Armed Forces of the Philippines.
   ``Today at the national level, the insurgents appear to be on
the defensive and attempting to regroup,'' Rear Adm. Timothy W.
Wright, acting U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense, told a
U.S. congressional committee recently.
   ``In the provinces, however, where the struggle is primarily
waged, the picture is less clear because much of the insurgents'
grassroots program is not conducted on the military battlefield.''
   Nonetheless, there is a public perception, especially in Manila,
that the insurgency has weakened since a popular uprising toppled
President Ferdinand Marcos' authoritarian administration in
February 1986.
   Rebel propaganda portrays Mrs. Aquino as no different from
Marcos. But most Filipinos still support her and do not blame her
personally for the shortcomings of her government.
   ``Without going into statistics, there is a feeling in the
population that the insurgency is in disarray,'' military Chief of
Staff Gen. Renato de Villa said in an interview with the
Philippines Free Press magazine. ``I think the most important
development is the realization that is spreading that the insurgent
alternative is not that palatable.''
   That perception has arisen despite military reports that
fighting actually escalated in 1988. Military reports show the
number of clashes rose from 3,118 in 1987 to 3,525 last year.
   Areas reporting increased fighting include southern districts of
Luzon, the main island, and the Davao and Misamis Oriental
provinces on Mindanao.
   According to the military, more than 3,900 people, including
guerrillas, government troopers and civilians were killed last year
in ``insurgency-related incidents,'' a 1.63 percent increase over
1987.
   The military also acknowledges that guerrillas influence nearly
8,000 of the 41,000 villages and urban wards. Rebels operate in
about 65 of the 73 provinces.
   But the military also claims guerrilla strength declined by 8.4
percent last year to about 23,000 fighters. Western sources, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, suspect this may be simply a
refinement in the military's estimate, which was too high in the
final years of the Marcos administration.
   De Villa says captured rebel documents indicate demoralization
in the ranks due to a 21 percent increase in battlefield deaths
during the first three months of this year. Military officials
believe Rowe was killed in part to boost morale in rebel ranks.
   Wright noted the favorable military reports but said there was
no way to verify them ``nor are they conclusive of a significant or
lasting setback'' to the rebels.
   Clearly, however, the party has suffered reverses. They include
the arrests in the past year of eight members of its central
committee, including Secretary General Rafael Baylosis, and more
than 30 regional and provincial officers.
   Western sources with close ties to the military say the arrests
were made because government informants penetrated senior party
ranks during the final years of the Marcos administration when
membership rolls swelled.
   Despite rebel attempts to win foreign support, both Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping have personally assured Mrs. Aquino that they will not
support the insurgents. The rebels acknowledge their main source of
weapons comes from raids on government forces.
   The perception that the insurgency is waning may stem in part
from a reduction in rebel and left-wing activity in the capital,
which peaked in the months following Marcos' ouster and the rise of
Mrs. Aquino to power.
   Since the party was founded in December 1968, it had followed
the strategy of late Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung in building a base
in the impoverished rural areas from which to isolate the urban
centers.

   But the overthrow of Marcos and the rise of Mrs. Aquino afforded
the party new opportunities to expand into Manila. The rebels
acknowledge they made a tactical error in boycotting the February
1986 election between Marcos and Mrs. Aquino, held two weeks before
the uprising.
   After taking power, Mrs. Aquino freed hundreds of political
prisoners, including party founder Jose Maria Sison, who now lives
in the Netherlands. She offered peace talks and negotiated a 60-day
cease-fire in December 1986.
   Rebel leaders such as Satur Ocampo and Antonio Zumel, both
former journalists, emerged from years in the underground to appear
on television talk shows and public rallies.
   Both joined nearly 100,000 people in a funeral march for slain
labor leader Rolando Olalia during which communist flags were
openly displayed.
   The rebels also used the cease-fire to infiltrate nearly 3,000
``armed city partisans'' into Manila. After peace talks collapsed
and fighting resumed, guerrillas launched a campaign of street
assassinations, killing nearly 100 police officers, soldiers and
civilian officials during 1987 in Manila alone.
   But rebels acknowledge that the urban strategy failed.
Indiscriminate killings alarmed the urban classes. They also
prompted sometimes draconian responses from the police.
   In Bacolod, police drew up a list of suspected left-wing
sympathizers and warned the rebels they would liquidate five of
them for every policeman slain. Street killings there ceased.
   Manila police organized a network of armed informants and
launched a series of mass raids in which hundreds of civilians were
rounded up for questioning.
   The strategy led to protests from human rights groups but
prompted slum dwellers to turn in guerrillas to avoid harassment.
   Human rights groups even took out paid advertisements in Manila
newspapers urging the rebels to scale down their killings for fear
the military would target them in reprisal. The military claims
such groups are rebel sympathizers.
   The military claims the failure of the urban strategy led to a
shake-up of the party's Manila branch in which more than 50 members
were investigated, either for mistakes or as suspected military
informants. Some of them were executed, the military claims.
   In a recent issue of its official organ Ang Bayan (The Nation),
the central committee acknowledged it was reassessing ``the nature
and style of operations of armed city partisans'' and would be more
selective in choosing targets.
   The rebels apparently are gambling that killing an American
colonel will not elicit the same public outrage as indiscriminate
attacks on lowly Filipino policemen.
   Meanwhile, rebel offers of peace in return for closing the six
U.S. bases appear to be a bid to build support among urban groups.
Opposition to the bases is substantial among the nationalistic
intelligentsia and the urban classes.
   Mrs. Aquino has not accepted the offer, and the rebels
apparently hope this will make her appear an ``American puppet'' in
the eyes of many Filipinos.
   Meanwhile, the rebels have put new emphasis on rural organizing.
About two-thirds of the 58 million Filipinos live in rural areas,
which have so far not benefited from improvements in the economy.
There, the rebels hope to expand their system of shadow governments
and recruit followers.
   ``We are now trying to professionalize leaders in preparation
for building provisional revolutionary governments,'' said one
rebel official on Negros Island, who used the pseudonym Fidel
Castro. ``We also need a higher level of training'' to combat
government counterinsurgency strategy, he said.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said in December that rebels have
seized more than 76,500 acres of land nationwide and are
distributing tracts to landless farmers.
   The military last September drafted a two-stage, three-year plan
for crushing the insurgents. The first stage, which is near
completion, calls for retraining troops, reorganizing command
structures and selecting targets.
   The second phase, beginning this spring, calls for
systematically eliminating rebel forces, first in remote mountains
and jungles and then nearer towns and cities.
   Under the plan, the military is training and deploying thousands
of civilian militiamen to augment rural security. Plans called for
deploying about 80,000 militiamen, but the figure was scaled down
to about 50,000 because of budget restraints.
   Military and civil officials concede that the campaign cannot
succeed unless the government can improve the livelihood of its
people, provide essential services and eliminate social injustices
that are still widespread.
   ``There are disturbing signs that basically the situation of our
people has not changed,'' said The Manila Chronicle in an
editorial. ``Seventy percent still live in abject poverty and there
are those who hold power, wealth and influence who have not learned
to share resources with the majority. For as long as these symptoms
persist, the insurgency will find a fertile and hospitable ground.''

   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Here are the major forces involved in
the Philippine Communist insurgency.
   Armed Forces of the Philippines: The 163,000-member volunteer
force is divided into four branches: Army, Navy, Air Force,
Philippine Constabulary and Marines. It is acknowledged to be the
poorest equipped military force among non-Communist nations of
Southeast Asia. It is augmented by thousands of civilian militamen
and anti-Communist vigilante groups, many of which are armed.
   Communist Party of the Philippines: The party was organized in
December 1968 by Prof. Jose Marie Sison. Its philosophy follows
that of the late Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung. The party claims
about 35,000 members but says its supporters number about 1 million
in a nation of 58 million.
   New Peoples Army: The New Peoples Army is the armed wing of the
Communist Party of the Philippines and operates in 65 of the 73
provinces. It was organized in 1969 from the remnants of the HUKs,
a pro-Soviet force that fought Japanese occupation troops in World
War II and then waged an unsuccessful, peasant insurgency in the
1950s and 1960s. The military estimates NPA strength at 23,000, but
the rebels claim 30,000. Both the military and the rebels say no
more than half the guerrillas are fully armed.
   National Democratic Front: This is a federation of 12 rebel
groups, including the Communist Party of the Philippines and the
New Peoples Army. The other 10 affiliates include left-wing
teachers, farmers, intellectuals, youth and Roman Catholic clergy
and laymen. It was organized by the party in an attempt to recruit
leftists who share Communist goals but who do not accept all
tenants of Marxism.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Around the coal mining town of Wayne, W.Va.,
Junior Ramey and his con games are part of the local lore. Now
Little Junior Ramey, not to be confused with his brother, Big
Junior Ramey, is making a name for himself in politics. But he
intends to stay on the right side of the law, now that he's had a
taste of prison.

<TEXT>
   Little Junior Ramey, who was West Virginia's
youngest mayor before he was sent to prison, is back in town and
planning on getting back into politics.
   But James Ramey Jr. III has a family reputation to live down, or
live up to, depending on who's doing the talking.
   A lot of folks hereabouts have fond memories of his father,
James Ramey Jr., who before his death in a federal penitentiary in
1983 had become known as West Virginia's greatest con artist.
   ``He could sell you anything, whether he had it or not,'' says
Little Junior, who is back running his diner, where the menu
features things like chicken and dumplings and corn bread. ``He
could convince you your black jacket was white.''
   Despite making his living as a con man, Junior Ramey was elected
time after time as a county constable. The citizens of Wayne also
elected his wife, Louise Ramey, a justice of the peace. And they
elected his son, James Ramey Jr. III, mayor of the town at the
tender age of 22.
   Ramey, now 26, resigned that job in 1987 after he pleaded guilty
to a tax evasion charge and was sentenced to two years in a federal
prison _ a sentence that many people consider to have been unfair.
Regardless of that, Ramey is back in Wayne, having been released
from prison on parole in January 1988. He plans to run for mayor in
June, after he completes his parole.
   ``I always said that I didn't know which it was that got me that
jail sentence _ being Junior Ramey's son or being the mayor of
Wayne,'' Ramey says. ``Any other person that got caught for what I
did wouldn't have gotten two years in prison. If I'd been an
average small business person, they would just have made me file
and pay my taxes.''
   At first, Ramey says he was reluctant to seek office again,
fearing that it was his prominence as the youngest mayor in the
state that helped get him a jail sentence.
   ``But everybody in this town kept insisting for me to run
again,'' Ramey says. ``And I like being a small town mayor. It's
not like real politics; it's just trying to do your best to help
your community.''
   The town of Wayne, population 1,495, has indeed supported the
Rameys. When Little Junior pleaded guilty to the tax charge, nearly
1,100 people put their signatures on a petition urging that the
young mayor be given probation and community service work for his
sentence.
   But it's said the ghost of Junior Ramey raised its head at the
younger Ramey's sentencing. Once a Ramey, always a Ramey, the
prosecutor said a day before the 1987 tax filing deadline.
   ``People can either sit down tomorrow night and do the right
thing, or look at Mr. Ramey and feel they've been taken,''
assistant U.S. attorney Joe Savage said in asking U.S. District
Judge Charles Haden to impose a jail term on the young mayor.
   ``The legacy of Junior Ramey apparently remains with us today,''
Savage told Haden, who also had sentenced the famed con artist.
   This raft of Rameys tends to confuse outsiders. After all, James
Ramey Jr. had eight wives and 13 children. One of the sons was
named James Robert Ramey, another was named James Ramey Jr. II and
was known as Big Junior. Thus, James Ramey Jr. III, the youngest,
came to be called Little Junior.
   Although he never really asked for an explanation of the muddled
names, Little Junior has a pretty good idea why his father named
his sons as he did.
   ``It probably had to do with confusing the IRS,'' Ramey
explains. ``And if somebody came in here looking for Junior Ramey,
we could always say he wasn't here.''
   And somebody was always looking for Junior Ramey.
   ``He was good at what he done, no question,'' Ramey says of his
father. ``Everybody here knew what my father did for a living, but
he always took his money from the rich people. The people of this
town always liked my father, and the people he beat out usually
were looking for something for nothing.''

   One of Ramey's most famous cons was selling people on the idea
of a ``money-cranking machine,'' with which the lucky owner could
turn $1 bills to $10 bills: Just put in a dollar bill, turn the
crank, and out comes a green portrait of Alexander Hamilton,
complete with serial numbers and seals. In another con, Ramey sold
his mark a process for making $20 bills in a bathtub, by soaking
two real bills in chemicals and pressing them against a blank piece
of paper.
   ``It was usually just one crook taking off another crook _ like
selling somebody counterfeit money that didn't exist,'' Ramey says.
   ``He was taking off two and three a week, making thousands and
thousands of dollars. But he had to keep looking over his shoulder
for people coming after him.
   ``I know that if I lost $20,000 to a con man, I'd probably shoot
him.''
   Junior Ramey also enlisted his children in his schemes.
   ``I loved my father, don't get me wrong,'' Little Junior adds.
``At 13 or 14, he taught me how to do everything, run all the cons.
He knew they couldn't do anything to me, because I was under age.''
   It frequently meant life on the run for much of the Ramey
family. In 1974, Junior Ramey was arrested in Phoenix after an
Alabama coin dealer accused him of selling him a non-existent coin
collection. The arrest came, according to Little Junior, after a
scene right out of the movies.
   ``They chased us through the desert with a helicopter, and he
tore up three FBI cars as well as our car before they stopped us,''
Ramey says. ``Then, somehow, he talked that Arizona judge into
setting his bail at just $20,000. He was out the next day and
gone.''
   Throughout his colorful career, wherever Junior Ramey landed,
his family went along. Little Junior has been to every state but
Hawaii. When his father was sentenced to prison in Lexington, Ky.,
for 18 months, the family pulled up stakes and moved to Kentucky to
be close by.
   ``I missed three days out of 18 months of seeing my father every
single day,'' Ramey says. ``I was there Monday through Friday from
5:30 p.m. to 10 p.m., and on Saturdays and Sundays from 8:30 a.m.
to 3:30 p.m. _ every single day.''
   Despite an early start as a junior con artist, most people in
this area say Little Junior Ramey is an exemplary citizen.
   ``After I turned 18, my father wanted me to go straight,'' Ramey
says.
   So he took over the Pioneer Drive-Inn, once owned by his father,
and made it into one of the booming businesses of Wayne.
   ``The tax charge, that was the only thing I was still doing that
my Dad told me to do,'' Ramey says. ``Most of my brothers have been
in and out of jail all their lives.''
   Ramey says the investigation of his failure to file tax returns
started when one of his half-brothers, former Kermit Police Chief
David Ramey, was being investigated for selling drugs and tried to
get prosecutors to go easy on him by steering them in other
directions.
   When Little Junior was subpoenaed to testify before a federal
grand jury, he says, ``I went in and told them I was guilty. I
signed that plea agreement that day.''
   ``He's the only one of that whole family who's made something of
himself,'' says James E. Chambers, a respected Huntington lawyer
whose son and law partner is the speaker of the state House of
Delegates.
   Representing Ramey at his sentencing on the tax charge, Chambers
_ who also had represented the elder Ramey in the past _ told the
judge that young Ramey had ``pulled himself up by his own
bootstraps from the environment in which he was raised.''
   Coming back to Wayne after his prison sentence wasn't hard,
Ramey says. ``The people of this town have supported me
unbelievably. And in the last year, our business has really
boomed.''
   He's considering running against John Wesley Mills, who was
appointed mayor after Little Junior was sentenced. When he resigned
after his first stint as mayor, Ramey says, ``This town had a new
fleet of cars, it was $28,000 to the good and didn't owe anybody
anything.''
   But his months in prison _ even though it was a Florida camp
``with white lines on the sidewalks instead of fences'' _ taught
him the lesson his father never learned, Ramey says .
   ``I feel like he should have learned his lesson when he first
went to prison,'' he says. ``I did. I know I'll never take another
chance at going back to prison _ and I was at a country club.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's an irrigation system regulated by computer,
modern technology at work to restore marshes and swamps to their
natural state, before man started altering the landscape. This
experimental project north of Chicago is helping scientists learn
how wetlands work and could serve as a model for similar efforts
elsewhere.

   The prairie marshes, ponds and streams
near this town just north of Chicago would look familiar to the
Europeans who first settled northern Illinois 150 years ago.
   But the wetlands today are being fed by a maze of underground
pipes with the flow of water from the Des Plaines River regulated
by a computer.
   It's part of a $10-million project to help scientists better
understand wetlands. Researchers worldwide are watching, because
the work could become a model for similar projects to restore vital
marshes and swamps.
   ``We're aiming for a natural prairie landscape, so when you look
across it you will see what the early explorers would have seen,''
says Donald Hey, who heads the 450-acre Des Plaines River Wetlands
Demonstration Project.
   ``Most of what we're doing is trying to compensate for the loss
of landscape through the introduction of concrete and controls,''
says Hey, director of Wetlands Research Inc., a non-profit group
funded by corporate and government grants.
   Nationwide, more than half the 200 million acres of wetlands
that existed when European settlers arrived on the continent have
disappeared. They continue to be destroyed at an annual rate of
275,000 acres, or more than one-third the area of Rhode Island,
according to figures compiled by the federal Fish and Wildlife
Service.
   Wetlands _ marshes, swamps and bayous _ can soak up flood waters
and help improve water quality, many conservationists say.
   ``One of the key values of wetlands is they serve as a kind of a
filter _ some people might call it a kidney _ within an aquatic
system,'' says David Davis, director of the Environmental
Protection Agency's wetlands protection program.
   ``We need to be finding ways to restore areas that have been
degraded,'' Davis said in a telephone interview from Washington.
   He said the Des Plaines project probably will be examined around
the country as a model for other projects spurred by increased
awareness of wetlands and their benefits.
   The 3-mile stretch of the Des Plaines River, about an hour's
drive north of Chicago's Loop, will in the next few years be
restored to the kind of flora and fauna that inhabited the site
before settlers drained it for farming in the 1850s.
   ``We're reversing a 130-year trend,'' Hey says. ``We're taking
out a lot of vegetation that is ecologically out of place.''
   Much of the vegetation that had overtaken the natural plants
during the last century-and-a-half has been cleared. That has
involved bulldozing the land so it more resembles its natural
contour, and taking out many of the trees that settlers had planted.
   ``It was choked _ it was overgrown with trees when we started,''
Hey says. ``I've been amazed that there hasn't been more outcry
over the cutting of the trees.''
   Where the project has been completed, the bullrush marshes are
peppered with highlands of oak, making the site a textured
patchwork of browns and greys. Since the beginning of the spring,
it has begun to turn various shades of green and migratory birds
have returned to roost.
   Hey hopes to see more of the osprey, heron and bufflehead duck,
as well as fox and beaver that have already begun to repopulate the
area.
   ``It's amazing the change we've had in waterfowl,'' Hey says.
``The more we open up the land, the more we'll see the waterfowl
coming back.''
   The site looks like a nature preserve, but with numerous
conduits, pumps and monitoring stations hooked up to an on-site
computer, the project is also a laboratory for experimenting with
various aspects of wetlands management.
   ``One of the things that is particularly interesting about the
project is that it combines both wetlands restoration and applied
research,'' says Davis of the EPA. ``It's kind of a living
laboratory.''
   Hey says the project will explore what water depths, soils and
plant types are most effective in improving water quality, how long
to retain the water, and what kinds of other elements are needed in
the system.
   So far, with only $5 million of the $10 million price tag for
the project raised, Hey and his colleagues have built four
experimental wetland areas. They can be filled to any depth, water
can be retained for any length of time and then drained in various
cycles.
   ``We're really trying to find out how to make wetlands work, how
to restore them, how to keep them running,'' Hey says. ``We really
don't know which kinds of plants do the most in terms of water
purification.''
   Plans ultimately call for another four experimental areas by the
time construction is completed in early 1990, Hey says. Congress
has authorized another $2.2 million for the project, but has not
yet appropriated any of the money.
   Scientists from many states have visited the site, and in March
a group of wetlands researchers from China toured the project.
   A documentary film and manual on wetlands restoration are also
planned.
   Lt. Col. Jess Franco, Chicago district coordinator for the Army
Corps of Engineers, said the corps hoped to use much of the data
from the project to restore other wetlands.
   ``What's being done here can be used for similar wetlands
projects across the nation,'' Franco says. ``In Louisiana, on the
coast of California, in Florida _ they're different from what we
see in the Midwest. But this is a good first step.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Get the homeless off the streets and put them to
work. That's the goal in a lot of cities, often without much
success. But a joint effort of private businesses and social
service agencies in Denver may be on the right track.

   Less than a year ago, Pete Shields had $5 to his
name, a drinking problem and nothing but the sky to sleep under. He
had spent 20 years living on the street.
   Shields, 46, now has more than $400 in the bank, an apartment
and a 40-hour-a-week job, and not just at the minimum wage.
   ``I don't figure I've done too bad,'' he was saying the other
day as he took a breather from his work at Osage Resource Recovery
Inc., which hires only homeless or indigent people.
   The company, which handles promotional mailings, is owned by
Osage Initiatives, a combination of public and private concerns
that was created just under a year ago as a new approach to solving
the problem of the homeless.
   Osage has placed about 90 homeless people in jobs with
Denver-area businesses and has created about 25 jobs through its
own business ventures, such as ORRI, which hired Shields.
   ORRI is Osage's first wholly owned business, but it also works
with companies in ``allied ventures'' to provide other jobs. Such
ventures include the maintenance company Artisan Initiatives,
Dominion Services asbestos removal company, and a cafeteria on
Osage's premises that trains the homeless for work in the food
service industry.
   Osage also houses five community agencies offering job training
and counseling and a day care center.
   ORRI pays its employees a minimum of $4.50 an hour, plus
benefits, and says it has been competitive because of low overhead
costs. Osage's complex of renovated buildings lies along the
railroad tracks just west of downtown Denver.
   ``It demonstrates that you can have a social conscience and be a
capitalist all at once,'' says Marcia Malone, head of business
development at Osage. She says many firms have responded favorably
to doing business with the company.
   ``Businesses like what we're doing because we're doing it
without federal funds.''
   Osage director Earl Belofsky says more than 60 percent of
Denver's homeless mainly need jobs.
   ``We're saying, `Don't give us money, give us the contracts and
the jobs,''' he says. ``If we can catch them before they fall
through the cracks, they haven't lost their self-esteem. Most of us
aren't very far from that line.''
   Most of the people Osage hires or places come out of shelters,
which screen them to make sure they are willing and able to work.
   Each night there are between 2,100 and 2,600 homeless people in
Denver, according to a census the Colorado Coalition for the
Homeless conducted about a year ago.
   Shields is one of about a dozen men working in ORRI's renovated
warehouse, filling an order from a local brewery. They are putting
gift items into kits for a promotional mailing.
   ``I was just one of those people who didn't want to settle
down,'' says Shields, who was married three times but ``drank my
way through all my marriages.''
   ``One day I just decided I'm about that age where I should do
something and not thrash around on the street,'' he says.
   Shields joined an alcohol treatment program and was directed to
Osage for a job. He had some construction experience, he says, and
would like to get back to that eventually.
   ``Here, I can make my way up the ladder if I use my head,'' he
says. ``I'd like to get back into construction. I have skills. I've
got the brain to do it if I just put my mind to it.''
   Also working in the warehouse is John Velasquez. In the two
months he has been working there, Velasquez and his wife and their
four young children have been able to move out of a shelter.
   Velasquez had lost his job as a machine adjuster and ended up in
jail for failing to appear in court on drunken driving charges.
When he decided to sober up, he couldn't get hired again.
   ``I had gone to electrical and mechanical school and I know I've
got some talents here,'' he says. ``I knocked on a lot of doors,
even tried dishwashing.''
   Velasquez says Osage is teaching him new job skills.
   ``They opened doors for hope _ I'm so grateful,'' he says.
``When you make a mistake, it hits so hard.''
   The idea for Osage developed after Jack MacAllister, the chief
executive office of U S West, the telephone company, visited a
Denver shelter for the homeless. MacAllister was struck by the
sight of a man meticulously ironing a pair of pants for a job
interview.
   Soon after, he contacted the five agencies and worked to
establish Osage. U S West donated the buildings and, along with
other community businesses, provided a $2.8 million loan to help
renovate them. U S West also provided $300,000 in seed money for
business development, and gave ORRI some of its first contracts _
fixing parts of phone booths.
   Belofsky says Osage will pay back the loans.
   Malone says ORRI made its first sale in June and had sales of
$66,000 in the next six months. Then in January alone it took in
$70,000. Malone says she is optimistic that ORRI can gross at least
10 times that much this year.
   ``Our product is as good as anybody's,'' Belofsky says, noting
that ORRI is set up to handle big promotional mailings and similar
projects that most companies are not set up to handle in-house.
   Belofsky says the Adolph Coors Co., for instance, placed its
first order with Osage for $1,800. Its second was for $42,000.
   Belofsky says companies in other cities have contacted him for
advice in starting up ventures similar to Osage.
   ``We're in business to create jobs,'' he says. ``We have to make
money so we can keep doing that.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Americans are suckers for a slick sales pitch
says a psychology professor who spent three years learning the
tricks of a salesman's trade before he wrote a book on the subject.
And Robert B. Cialdini learned one important lesson while doing his
research. He learned to say no.
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Robert B. Cialdini wrote his book about sleazy
sales techniques to warn consumers to be on guard. Now he's
frequently invited to speak to the people in charge of the selling.
   The 43-year-old professor of psychology at Arizona State
University in Tempe spent three years researching his book,
``Influence: The New Psychology of Modern Persuasion.'' He became a
used-car salesman, peddled products door-to-door, sold advertising,
made ``cold calls'' on the telephone, learning all the sales
pitches.
   Now he's on the lecture tour, taking his message to marketing
and sales executives, negotiators, attorneys, fund-raisers and the
like.
   ``The people who invited me to come for lectures already
understood the process in an inarticulated way,'' he says. ``That
is, they knew what worked, but they wanted to know why it worked.
They wanted the psychological underpinnings.''
   Thus Cialdini began speaking more about the ethics of the
persuasion process than the process itself. He says he has a
natural interest in the subject since he describes himself as a
typical patsy for a sales pitch.
   But he says he's not alone. He maintains that we are socialized
in such a way that if someone gives us something for free, such as
a Hare Krishna flower at an airport, we feel we must reciprocate in
some way. Or, we are taught not to interrupt, so we subject
ourselves to a long telephone pitch because we are too polite to
just hang up.
   Cialdini's research shows how the salesmen capitalize on these
civilities without the consumer being aware.
   In his own research, he found a fire safety sales pitch among
the seamiest. The salesman would come in for a free inspection of a
home and the lucky homeowner would receive a free fire extinguisher.
   ``First, the salesman would show pictures of burned children,''
he says. ``It was just awful.''
   After the inspection, he would ask the homeowners to fill out a
questionnaire while he went out to the car to get something.
   ``He would always say, `Stay seated. I'll let myself out and
come back in.' That's very important. Think of it. Who do you let
in and out of your house? Someone you trust. So the salesman has
established himself as a trusted person by this simple technique.''
   Then came the pitch. It went something like, ``Charles, do you
think your wife and litte girl here are worth $2,000?'' What other
way can you answer that?
   If the potential customer was still resistant, the salesman
would ask permission to call his office and report he had failed at
another sale, a failure he explains that might cost him his job.
But then the front office, all part of the central plot, would
explain that he could offer them the products for $500 less since
his job was on the line.
   Cialdini also took breathing lessons so he could make a pitch on
the telephone without taking a breath, thus not allowing the other
party to interject, ``I'm not interested.''
   He regrets that consumer groups showed a lack of interest in his
book, but he says the interest of corporate America changed his
life.
   ``IBM flew me to Monte Carlo for a month _ twice _ for big
educational conferences,'' he says. ``That's the kind of boondoggle
I always read about somebody else getting. But I got it and they
paid me money besides.''
   He gets $3,500 per lecture, or $5,000 for half a day, but he's
had to cut his speaking down to twice a month. He's back teaching
psychology after a sabbatical.
   Cialdini says he's pleased that the book did not turn him into a
``pop psychologist'' and that he did not lose academic standing
because of it.
   The book, published in 1984 and re-issued as an academic text in
1988, outlines the six ``triggers'' people respond to in
decision-making: authority, reciprocity, scarcity, commitment,
consensus and liking.
   In discussing the authority technique, Cialdini offers an
ethical and unethical use.
   If nine out of 10 doctors really did prefer a certain brand,
that's one thing, he says. But it's something else to have an actor
whom the public identifies with the physician he portrays endorsing
a decaffeinated coffee.
   Cialdini describes the difference as the ``detective'' approach
and the ``smuggler'' approach. The detective approach is to find
naturally hidden triggers in the product. The smuggler approach is
to create them, such as the actor in a white doctor's coat
endorsing a product.
   Let's say you have spent about half an hour with a used-car
salesman. Do you feel as though you like him? If the answer is yes,
watch out. You are being manipulated. The question is whether the
price on the car is a good deal.
   That technique explains the success of such products as
Tupperware, Avon, and Mary Kay, he says. The seller of those
products is likely to be a friend, or at least an acquaintance.
   Let's say you are looking at a house to buy and your real estate
agent becomes aware that another family is also interested. He
tells you that someone else might get it. That is perfectly
legitimate. He's acting in your best interest. However, in an
unethical scenario, there is no other buyer out there, but the
agent creates one to get you to put down a firm bid.
   How do you know when it's real?
   Unfortunately, often, you don't.
   ``That's why all salesmen tend to get tarred with the same brush
and end up ranking down there below undertakers,'' Cialdini says.
   ``When I talk to business groups, the point I make is that they
are going to do better in the long term by being ethical,'' he
says. ``Then they sit up and take notice.''
   He uses as an example a trusted mechanic who told him the
repairs necessary on his car would be $45. The previous mechanic
had estimated $500.
   ``He was very ethical and he now has me as a customer for
life,'' Cialdini says.
   Although he's back teaching now, Cialdini says that the research
he put in on his book gave him one more advantage.
   ``I can say no a lot better now.''

   Cindy Pickett, who portrays the mother of a
California boy who was abducted at age 7, says the boy's real
mother never abandoned hope during the seven years her son was held
by his abductor.
   A new NBC miniseries tells the story of Steven Stayner, who was
kidnapped from his home in Merced, Calif., in 1972 and held captive
until he was able to escape in 1979. During those seven years he
lived an apparently normal life as the son of his abductor, Kenneth
Parnell, a convicted child molester.
   But Steven's parents never gave up hope of finding him alive.
   ``She said she knew Steven wasn't dead because a mother would
know,'' says Pickett, who portrays Kay Stayner, the mother, in ``I
Know My First Name is Steven.''
   The two-part miniseries, which will be televised on Monday and
Tuesday, also stars John Ashton as the father, Del Stayner, Arliss
Howard as Parnell, Corin ``Corky'' Nemec as the teen-age Steven and
Luke Edwards as the 7-year-old Steven.
   Larry Ellikan directed. J.P. Miller and Cynthia Whitcomb adapted
the screenplay from a story by J.P. Miller.
   Parnell told Steven that his parents didn't want him any more.
   ``The boy thought he haof off-Broadway's most
innovative theaters, particularly as a home for plays that deserve
a second chance.
   From its beginnings in an Upper West Side hotel, where audiences
had to cross a drug-infested Columbus Avenue to get to the theater,
to its current space in a gentrified area of shops, restaurants and
co-ops on Upper Broadway, Second Stage has made its mark.
   During that decade, its commitment to re-evaluating plays like
Lanford Wilson's ``Serenading Louie,'' Jules Feiffer's ``Little
Murders'' and ``The Woods'' by David Mamet hasn't waivered. Yet the
theater's vision has altered slightly.
   ``We've evolved,'' explains Miss Goodman, a one-time actress who
gave up acting for fund raising and administration. ``When we came
on the scene, we fulfilled a need that wasn't present off-Broadway.
Everyone was doing new plays. No one was doing contemporary plays a
second time.''
   Things have changed. Today, from Lincoln Center to the New York
Shakespeare Festival to the Humana Festival for New American Plays
in Louisville, Ky., theater companies offer playwrights second
productions.
   ``We also did plays that maybe hadn't been done in New York
before, like `How I Got That Story' or `My Sister in This House,'
'' Miss Rothman says. ``They had been done in other theaters around
the country but not here, so they seemed like new plays.''
   The women were diligent in their search for properties, reading
scripts, doing library research, reading reviews and meeting with
every artistic director in New York to ask them, ``If you could do
a play again that you did in the past, what would it be?''
   The women spent a year raising money _ $90,000 _ and planning a
three-play season before the theater finally opened in 1979.
   ``We did that so we could just concentrate on the plays,'' Miss
Goodman recalls. ``We thought we were pretty smart. Ten days before
we were supposed to start the first play, nearly everybody quit _
the director, the lighting designer, the set designer _ and the two
lead actors walked out along with them.''
   Miss Rothman took over the direction of the play. Miss Goodman
took over all its technical aspects, and both begged two actor
friends to come in and save them. They did. The play didn't get
great reviews, but it and the theater survived even if audiences
had to take an elevator to the shabby building's top floor to see
the shows.
   ``If you lived to get to the 16th floor, you were happy to see
anything,'' Miss Goodman says.
   Among the works presented that first season was a revival of
Michael Weller's ``Split.'' Weller has been a mainstay of Second
Stage. He was the focus of the Second Stage's last season when it
presented two old Weller plays, ``Moonchildren'' and ``Loose
Ends,'' as well as the world premiere of ``Spoils of War,'' a new
Weller work starring Kate Nelligan that later went to Broadway.
   It wasn't until the theater's third season that it attempted a
new play. The premiere was ``Pastorale'' by Deborah Eisenberg.
   ``The reason we did it was because it had been rejected by
everybody in and outside New York,'' Miss Goodman says. ``We read
the play and fell in love with it. She wasn't going to get a
production unless we did it.''
   The following season, a subscriber and playwright named Tina
Howe came to them with ``Painting Churches,'' a play already turned
down by the New York Shakespeare Festival.
   The duo decided to do it. The play was a success and transferred
to the Lamb's Theater near Times Square for an extended run.
   ``As we began to see we were making our mark, proving our point
and had good relationships with playwrights, it seemed silly for
them, if we had a good working experience, to take their new play
somewhere else,'' Miss Goodman says.
   The relationship with Miss Howe has continued through the years.
   In 1986, the theater presented the playwright's next work,
``Coastal Disturbances,'' which also went on to Broadway and
received another best play Tony nomination.
   The relationship has continued with ``Approaching Zanzibar,''
Miss Howe's latest work, currently enjoying a run at Second Stage.
The play, which stars Jane Alexander and Harris Yulin, looks at a
family as it travels across the country to visit a dying aunt.
   Miss Rothman has directed the play, something she tries to do at
least once each season. Her partner used to act in one play a year,
but after the first four years, gave it up.
   ``It was painful to be acting in my own theater,'' Miss Goodman
says. ``That's a lot of responsibility. Every once in a while, I
say `Hey, I could do this part.' But then I say to Carole,
`Wouldn't Judith Ivey or Diane Wiest be good in this role?'''
   Second Stage moved into its modern, 120-seat theater, christened
the Walter McGinn@John Cazale Theater, in 1984. It was named for
actor Walter McGinn, Miss Goodman's husband, who was killed in an
automobile accident in 1977, and a good friend of his, John Cazale,
another actor, who died of cancer the following year.
   Today, the theater has an annual budget of more than $2 million
for its four-play season, and shows no sign of being a victim of
its increasing success.
   ``Our mutual strength is that we have the same taste in plays,''
says Miss Rothman. ``We usually agree on things.
   ``Robin is incredibly giving to a production,'' she adds. ``Even
if a play doesn't get great reviews, she'll still be in there,
talking to people. Just making sure that the experience of working
here is a positive one. We're not here to make a lot of money, so
you should get some joy out of the experience.''

   Many U.S. and European officials fear improved
relations will lead to even more rapid acquisition by the Soviet
bloc, legally and illegally, of the West's sensitive military
technology.
   American officials say the Soviets spend at least $1 billion a
year to obtain Western technology and often will pay more than
three times market value for something they want.
   Analysts say the Soviets obtain high technology with the help of
unscrupulous Western businessmen who may acquire the goods legally,
then divert them to the East illegally. Soviet agents get other
material through espionage.
   The diversions are taking place in the more relaxed atmosphere
created by Mikhail S. Gorbachev's peace and disarmament overtures,
which have altered Western perceptions of the Soviet threat.
   ``There is no sign that Soviet efforts have diminished, and
evidence is that they are increasing,'' said William Waldegrave,
Britain's deputy foreign secretary.
   Francois Heisbourg, head of the International Institute for
Strategic Studies in London, said losses now may surpass those of
the late 1970s, when Soviet agents penetrated key ministries in
France and West Germany.
   ``We will see an enormous draw from the West,'' said John
Galvin, the American general who commands NATO forces in Europe.
``We'll probably lose the technological edge we've had for
decades.''
   The United States and 16 allies belong to the Coordinating
Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, known as CoCom, which
tries to stem the flow of sensitive military goods to the Soviet
bloc.
   Stephen Bryen, former U.S. deputy undersecretary of defense for
trade security, estimated Western businessmen smuggled items worth
up to $2 billion to the Soviet East in 1988.
   Recent diversions and thefts, analysts say, have allowed Soviet
engineers to make more accurate missiles, quieter submarines and
stronger aircraft wings, and to clone advanced computers they might
have taken years to develop.
   They say the Soviets also are acquiring such new battlefield
technology as helicopter weapons systems and tank armor, and
Western experts worry that the trend to greater trade between East
and West will increase the flow.
   ``There is no question they are ... on a path toward getting
more technology,'' said Richard Perle, a former top Pentagon
official who championed export controls. ``We certainly gave away a
lot during detente, and this looks like a rerun.''
   Gorbachev's ambitious plan to modernize the Soviet economy has
created intense interest in Western business circles.
   Dozens of Western companies are entering joint ventures that
eventually may offer Soviet consumers a variety and quantity of
goods and services not available now. Joint ventures also may
provide Western technology, money and management expertise
Gorbachev sorely needs.
   Some Western allies urge caution lest such cooperation allow the
Soviets to concentrate its scarce resources on defense projects,
but others want to help Gorbachev's liberalization program.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany said
recently: ``In view of the great economic problems confronting the
Soviet Union, as well as its process of restructuring, a Western
readiness for cooperation in the economic sector is strongly
needed, not least in our own interest.''
   An American serving in Paris said privately that, if the thaw
continues, ``it will probably be more and more difficult to
maintain the support for CoCom that we've had.''
   John C. Kelley Jr., director of strategic investigations for the
U.S. Customs Service in Washington, said increased trade will
provide ``more opportunity to mask some of the items and ...
commingle more high-technology merchandise'' with legitimate goods.
   CoCom, based in Paris, regulates shipments of weapons, nuclear
technology and ``dual-use'' products, such as communications
equipment, that have both commercial and military applications.
   Aaron Karp of the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute said Soviet engineers now are seeking manufacturing
processes rather than single items.
   In March, West German authorities accused several German
computer hackers of pirating technical data from the Pentagon and
research centers in the United States, Europe and Japan over two
years. Investigators say the hackers sold it to the Soviets for
money and drugs.
   Authorities said the information helped Soviet engineers read
data in some crucial industrial and military installations.
   ``This is a new quality of espionage by the East,'' said Gerhard
Boemen, chief of West German intelligence services.
   Espionage successes for the Soviets mean Western researchers
must invest heavily to find something better than what has been
lost.
   NATO officials say a spy ring in the U.S. Army in West Germany,
broken up last August, gave the Kremlin even more sensitive
information than originally believed.
   Italian authorities charged two men in February with selling
secrets about a computer system being developed for the alliance.
   French police seized a disassembled particle accelerator packed
in 18 crates and destined for the Soviet Academy of Sciences in
Moscow. The police arrested Aime Richardt, who was implicated in
previous cases. French customs charged that the machine is used to
accelerate heavy ions, which gives it military applications. But
Richardt claimed it was an accelerator of light ions and was
suitable only for scientific research. The case is still pending in
a French court.
   Viktor Karpov, the Soviet arms negotiator, laughed when asked
whether Moscow's theft of technology had increased.
   ``Look at that Florida case,'' he said. ``The man tried to sell
to the FBI, not the KGB.''
   A former defense worker in Florida had called the Soviet Embassy
to offer plans. FBI agents on the line arrested him.

   ``They're getting more than ever,'' a ranking Pentagon official
said privately. ``They've come up with ways to pull together
systems from separate directions. That's new.''
   He said the U.S. Commerce Department recently granted export
licenses to Austria for three apparently unrelated components, none
seen as sensitive on its own. Together, they allowed the Soviets to
make advanced fiber optics.
   ``All they needed was a little piece of software to make it all
hum, but Commerce did not see the overall context,'' the Pentagon
official said.
   CIA estimates say the Soviet Military Industrial Commission
obtained 30,000 pieces of hardware and 400,000 technical documents
between 1976 and 1980.
   In the early 1980s, the Reagan administration pressed its allies
to clamp down, but Gorbachev came along in 1985 with his talk of
peace and reform.
   Waldegrave, the British deputy foreign secretary, said: ``We
must not let Gorbeuphoria sweep away our defenses.''
   West Germany, which borders the Soviet bloc and depends heavily
on export earnings, argues energetically for cooperation and more
selective controls.
   ``We don't want to have a new artificial division between East
and West,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Hanns Schumacher said.
   Officials in the United States, Britain and France said they
worried about West Germany's ability, and will, to control
sensitive exports.
   A U.S. Defense Department document made available to The
Associated Press identifies West Germany as ``the greatest single
source of illegal transfers of sensitive technology.''
   After West German sales of chemical weapons components to Libya
and the Middle East were criticized, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
government agreed to crack down on sensitive exports.
   Enforcement officers remained skeptical. German companies can
sue officials for delaying goods and no pre-license or
post-delivery checks guard against fraud. Investigators have
limited access to company records.
   ``There are 20 cases where the Germans are pretending nothing is
going on,'' said Perle, the former U.S. defense official.
   ``We pleaded with them, but they have not put in place a
mechanism for enforcement. They let the companies go out and sell.''
   Differences in philosophy divide even close allies.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain recently allowed the
company Simon Carves to sell electronic machining equipment worth
$450 million to a factory in Soviet Armenia despite U.S. objections.
   Britain said nothing new was given away and the deal warmed the
East-West climate. U.S. officials argued against helping with such
complex projects.
   Technology theft made headlines when Toshiba Machine of Japan
and Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk of Norway were caught faking documents
to sell the Soviets milling equipment to produce silent submarine
propellers.
   The case broke in 1985, but one Pentagon specialist said the
full effects would not be known until the mid-1990s. Western
engineers had to design better noise-detecting devices.
   Japan tightened controls, but subsequent probes found similar
violations in France, West Germany and Italy. Americans and Britons
were involved in other cases.
   Punishment is seldom harsh for diverting technology, and
investigators complain that governments sometimes mask details to
avoid scandal.
   Bryen, the former U.S. trade security official, likened the more
recent Forest-Line case in France to Toshiba-Kongsberg because it
allowed the Soviets to machine sophisticated aircraft wings.
   Last April, four executives of the Forest-Line company were
charged with smuggling machine tools to the Soviet Union.
   They were released pending trial. The Paris daily Liberation
reported much later that a fifth man, a government consultant, was
also under investigation.
   A French official confirmed a fifth suspect who worked for the
government, then shrugged and said: ``True, we didn't exactly shout
it from the rooftops.''
   From a U.S. Embassy annex in Paris, CoCom's small staff protects
a list of components and processes the size of a city telephone
book. A separate U.S. list controls items for reasons of security
or foreign policy.
   The agency was not established by treaty and depends on the will
of governments to apply national laws or priorities. Some Europeans
accuse CoCom of needlessly limiting their markets.
   Many say the list is outdated and too long. As a Dutch delegate
put it, CoCom needs ``a higher wall around a smaller garden.''
   U.S. officials fear sensitive technology will move unchecked
toward the easiest exit when the European Economic Community lowers
internal customs barriers in 1993.
   In Washington, the Defense and Commerce departments argue over
what to deny the Soviet Union and how much to sacrifice in export
earnings.
   Under ``foreign availability,'' an exporter can sell a
restricted item if he demonstrates someone else already is doing
it. Officials say that invites abuse.
   Paul Freedenberg, undersecretary of commerce for export
administration, agreed with others that controls at best could slow
an inevitable process, stopping big diversions while smaller ones
passed unnoticed.

   Late last year, Dutch businessman
Franciscus Govaerts traveled to Boston to supervise the packing of
$1.4 million worth of high-technology equipment he had ordered from
Teradyne Inc.
   Was Govaerts just a nervous buyer worried about his fragile
cargo?
   No, says U.S. Customs. Its allegations say he was making sure
Teradyne would abide by a bargain to mislabel the boxes so they
could be exported illegally to Bulgaria in the Soviet bloc.
   In the boxes was equipment for testing and repairing computer
chips that can be used in personal computers, video games and
missile guidance systems.
   Teradyne participated in an undercover ``sting'' operation.
Govaerts was arrested and charged with violating federal export
laws.
   Western officials say the export of militarily sensitive goods
is difficult to control, and some liken the flow to narcotics
traffic.
   ``To completely stop it is impossible,'' said Viktor Jacobson,
the U.S. Customs attache in Bonn, West Germany.
   Roger Urbanski, who heads the U.S. Customs office in Vienna,
said ``it's a race without a finish line'' because of rapid
technological advances.
   Over the years, legally or illegally, the Soviets and their
allies have obtained billions of dollars worth of sensitive
technology.
   Analysts say the acquisitions have aided Soviet research and
development efforts, enabling them to devote scarce resources to
other areas.
   A CIA report said the Kremlin captures high technology through
an espionage program run by the Soviet Military Industrial
Commission and an illegal trade operation in the Foreign Trade
Ministry.
   It said most of the ministry's program involves Western traders
under contract to the Soviets.
   When the suspects in the Boston case pressed ahead with the
order despite legal problems, authorities said, Teradyne grew
suspicious of their persistence and notified the Customs Service.
   Officials said they have been alerted to other cases by
competing companies, disgruntled employees, intelligence services
and random checks of export shipments.
   One investigator was tipped to a case when he overheard an
exporter boasting in a Belgian bar about how easy it was to divert
high technology, officials said. He learned that the braggart
operated two German ``front,'' or dummy, companies.
   G. Jonart, head of Belgium's customs investigations, recalled
that a spot check of goods being shipped through Belgium uncovered
a scheme to divert U.S. computer equipment worth about $100,000 to
Bulgaria.
   Requests from the Soviets to their contacts for sensitive
technology usually are detailed, officials said.
   ``The other side knows exactly what they want,'' said Jacobson,
the Customs attache in Bonn. ``They are looking for specific items
down to the model number.''
   In a June report on technology transfer, the North Atlantic
Assembly said Moscow earmarked $1.4 billion in the late 1970s for
purchases of ``one-of-a-kind Western hardware and documents.''
   ``Each year, between 3,000 and 5,000 new, amended and
re-approved requirements for hardware and documents are issued and
form the basis for the Soviet `shopping list' of Western
technology,'' it said. The assembly is made up of legislators from
the 16 NATO nations.
   About one-third of the high-tech requirements established by the
Soviet Military Industial Commission are completely or partially
filled annually, said the report by the CIA's Technology Transfer
Assessment Center.
   Soviet trade agents often contact unscrupulous businessmen at
European trade fairs where hundreds of companies gather for a few
days to do business, officials said.
   They also have an elaborate network of foreign trade
organizations, commercial offices, joint companies and foreign
procurement offices, according to the CIA report.
   Urbanski, the Customs man in Vienna, said: ``The Soviets put out
the request. The first one with the market and best price gets the
deal. It's a normal transaction at an inflated price.''
   If the Kremlin really wants an item the sky is the limit,
officials said, and the Soviets may pay triple the going rate or
more.
   ``Ideology seems to have drained out of all of it,'' Urbanski
said. ``They do it only for money,'' said Jacobson.
   With the deal struck, a Western European company, possibly a
front for the Soviets, may order the merchandise and have it sent
legally to a NATO nation such as France, Germany or Belgium.
   Once the goods are in Europe, the diverters may disguise the
packaging and shipping instructions and send the material through
other countries _ possibily neutral Switzerland or Austria _ before
slipping it into the Soviet bloc.
   ``Money is no object in transportation,'' Jacobson said. ``It's
the cost of doing business.''

   Perched on South America's northeast shoulder,
Guyana is about the size of Idaho, has fewer people than major U.S.
cities and is sinking into economic depths after attempting a
``transition from capitalism to socialism.'' This is another in a
series of periodic reports by The Associated Press on the economic,
social and political turbulence that has turned South America into
a continent in crisis.

<TEXT>
   Although it has bountiful resources,
including gold and diamonds, Guyana is in the throes of one of the
worst economic declines in the developing world.
   Its 750,000 people face chronic shortages of electricity, water,
transportation, fuel and food. Jobs are scarce and prices are
soaring. A gallon of milk costs the equivalent of $3, three times
the average daily wage.
   Its only thriving economic sector is the black market.
   Frustration is giving way to violence and strikes.
   Fearing riots similar to those that killed 176 people in
neighboring Venezuela in late February and early March, Guyana's
military is on alert. The unrest here is simmering at its worst
since race riots left hundreds dead in the mid-1960s.
   The World Bank estimates Guyana, a former British colony on
South America's northeast shoulder and the continent's only
English-speaking nation, has had the worst economic decline in the
Third World over the past decade.
   ``We have sunk almost to the bottom of the table, perhaps just
above Haiti and Bolivia,'' the independent daily The Stabroek News
commented recently.
   Guyana has had virtually no economic growth in 10 years and in
the mid-1980s suspended payments on its foreign debt, now $1.9
billion. Western creditors have stopped most aid to the country.
   But not only does Guyana, which is about the size of Idaho, have
a big foreign debt for its size, it has no foreign exchange
reserves. It has borrowed $1 billion just to keep foreign
currencies on hand for emergencies.
   Last year, when the government needed more local currency _ the
Guyanese dollar _ it simply printed it.
   Without hard currencies such as the U.S. dollar, Guyana can't
afford to import parts or buy technology, and this has left its
infrastructure _ roads, bridges, sewers, electric and water
treatment plants _ to deteriorate. This, coupled with an exodus of
the skilled workers and poor production of its three major exports
_ sugar, bauxite and rice _ contribute to the slump.
   But the crisis also points to the government's establishment in
1980 of a cooperative republic ``in transition from capitalism to
socialism.''
   In the past two years, President Desmond Hoyte has backed away
from much of the socialism of his predecessor, Forbes Burnham, who
led Guyana to independence from Britain in 1966.
   Burnham died in 1985 after 21 years of authoritarian rule.
During his presidency, he nationalized 80 percent of the economy
and discouraged foreign and private investment in a bid to make
Guyana a self-sufficient, non-aligned socialist republic.
   Critics also blame the crisis on mismanagement, resistance to
democratic reform and alleged corruption by Burnham's People's
National Congress, which has dominated politics since he became
president in 1966. The elections in December 1985 that brought
Hoyte to office were widely regarded as fradulent.
   ``There is a big question over elections which has never been
addressed, and it's a cancer in the life of the country,'' said
Anglican Bishop Randolph George. ``The style has changed with
Burnham's death, but it's the same old gang. It's a
mini-dictatorship.''
   Although the government maintains Burnham's socialist policies
were not responsible for Guyana's decline, a pending agreement with
the International Monetary Fund signals a change of course.
   ``Private enterprise doesn't conflict with socialism,'' said
Prime Minister Hamilton Green. ``We need large inputs of money and
we hope the IMF program will provide incentives needed to grow.
   ``But it's going to be rough, very rough.
   Western creditors want an IMF agreement before giving Guyana new
aid. So on March 31, Hoyte imposed a three-year IMF program that
devalued Guyana's currency by 70 percent, doubled interest rates to
35 percent and triggered 300 percent price hikes.
   To soften the blow, the government gave state workers a
20-percent pay increase. But that's small change for salaries that
dropped in value to $1 a day from $2.50 as a result of the
devaluation. Food prices skyrocketed. Workers have to work two days
to buy a pound of chicken or a pint of cooking oil.
   ``A 20 percent increase is not enough. We need 1,000 percent,''
said Lincoln Lewis, president of the Guyana Mine Workers Union,
representing 4,000 of the 5,000 workers in the bauxite industry.

   Some 20,000 workers from the sta' he said.
   He also said Exxon's response was ``reluctant and myopic,
characterized by stalling techniques, disinformation, and a refusal
to pay real attention to damage outside of Prince William Sound.''
   The subcommittee today was to conclude two days of hearings
investigating the nation's largest oil spill. Today's session was
expected to include testimony from Exxon, which has defended its
actions.
   Alyeska's vice president for operations, Theo L. Polasek, said
the industry's response plans were sufficient to deal with a spill,
but that there was confusion after the tanker ran aground.
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., told Polasek that ``I'm not so
sure this (the cleanup) was a high priority for you people.''
   The tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on a reef in the sound on
March 24 after filling its storage tanks with crude oil from the
pipeline. More than 10 million gallons of oil poured into the sound.
   Also Sunday, state officials said Exxon's decision to pull crews
from an oil-stained beach on Smith Island was surprising.
   But Exxon spokesman Bill Stillings said the crews were moved off
the northern beach to attack more heavily soiled areas. The island
is considered crucial to the annual seal pupping cycle.
   ``I think we fully intend to come back to that beach. I won't
tell you we'll be back on that beach tomorrow,'' Stillings said.
``(Exxon's) best judgment at this point is that it's time to move
on.''
   Two days earlier, Yost said the beach was far from clean.
   Exxon, in a plan that has yet to win Yost's approval, has called
for the worst of the oil to be cleaned off five islands in the
sound by Wednesday, with 364 miles to be cleansed by Sept. 15.

<DATELINE>GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some facts and figures on Guyana.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ The Guianas, a region that today includes Suriname,
French Guiana, Guyana and parts of Brazil and Venezuela, was
sighted by Columbus in 1498. But Guyana was not settled until late
in the 16th century by the Dutch. The British became the rulers in
1796 and established British Guiana in 1831. Independence was
granted in 1966. Guyana, which means ``Land of Many Rivers,''
became a republic in 1970 and was declared a cooperative republic
``in transition from capitalism to Socialism'' by the 1980
constitution. Forbes Burnham became president in 1966 and ruled
until his death in 1985.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ The majority of the population of 780,000 is made
up of English and Creolese-speaking people. They are highly
literate, about 90 percent. Most of the people are descendants of
African slaves or indentured servants, mostly from India and a few
from Portugal. Slavery was abolished in 1833.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Guyana is a tropical country on the northeastern
coast of South America between Suriname and Venezuela. Its
83,000-square-mile area is about the size of Idaho. About 80
percent of the land is rainforest and savanna, laced by rivers and
rich in ricelands, wildlife, gold, diamonds, semi-precious stones
and timber. The most populated region is along the 235-mile
Atlantic coastline.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   POLITICS _ Politics are based more on ethnic lines rather than
ideology, with the governing People's National Congress supported
by urban blacks and the People's Progressive Party of Cheddi Jagan
by Indo-Guyanese, who are about 49 percent of the population. The
National Congress, first under the late President Forbes Burnham,
and now under President Desmond Hoyte, has governed since 1964.
Opposition parties, Western governments and human rights
organizations charge the National Congress maintains power by
election fraud. National elections were held in 1985. The next
elections must be held no later than this December, although Hoyte
could call them earlier.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE GOVERNMENT _ Guyana has a modified Parliamentary system,
with legislative power in a unicameral National Assembly. The
president who is the leader of the majority party is the chief
executive and appoints a prime minister and a Cabinet. The prime
minister is the vice president.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ The government has launched a major drive for
foreign investment to spur the economy, which is nearly stagnant
and dominated by a black market created by the country's depleted
foreign exchange account. Economists estimate black market
transactions account for 80 percent of the country's economic life.
The country has a foreign debt of $1.9 billion. Official estimates
of unemployment and inflation are unavailable.

   ``Gorillas in the Mist'' (MCA Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95.
Rated PG-13)
   
   Dian Fossey was a driven, committed woman _ a woman who gave up
the comforts and safety of home, her love life and her appendix to
live with gorillas in central Africa.
   But she crossed that fine line between commitment and obsession,
between a illusion and reality and paid for the voyage with her
life.
   ``Gorillas in the Mist'' attempts to examine the life of the
anthropologist who dedicated her life to saving an endangered
population of gorillas in Rwanda. She fought poachers, government
officials, animal traders and her own colleagues.
   Sigourney Weaver stars as Fossey. But her performance is more a
character study for a drama class than a finished product. She
stumbles through an array of emotions, from joy to enthusiasm to
wonder to rage, but simply doesn't have the depth to be convincing.
Fossey was a complex, unconventional woman; in Weaver, we see only
a silly shrill.
   But the gorillas are cute, and far more interesting than the
star.
   Bryan Brown puts in an admirable performance as a National
Geographic photographer and Fossey's sometime lover. There also are
good support jobs by John Miluwi as Fossey's house man and tracker,
and Julie Harris as a white local who befriends the anthropologist.
They overpower Weaver, who seems an amateur out of her league,
despite an Academy nomination for the role.
   If you can suffer through Sigourney Weaver's acting, you'll
enjoy the stunning vistas and beautiful photography of ``Gorillas
in the Mist.''

   ``Punchline'' (RCA-Columbia Pictures Home Video. VHS-Beta,
$89.95. Rated R)
   
   The manic, melancholic, merry world of stand-up comedy is
studied in David Seltzer's ``Punchline,'' starring Tom Hanks and
Sally Field.
   Critically acclaimed when released theatrically last year, it
was overlooked by the Academy at Oscar time. Too bad, because Hanks
gives a much better performance as the brilliant comic Steven Golda
than he did playing a 12-year-old in ``Big.''
   And the movie itself is a tightly written, fast-paced portrait
of that special world of comedy. It is a movie that will make you
laugh, cry and think.
   Everybody tells Lilah Krytsick (Field), a housewife from New
Jersey, how natually funny she is. More than anything else, Lilah
would love to be comic. So she spends her nights in a Manhattan
comedy club called the Gas Station.
   But the personable Lilah isn't too funny on stage _ she's a yawn
with her Polish jokes and her New Jersey jokes. Enter Steven, the
hit of the club with his Lenny Bruce-type deliveries and acerbic
satirical stabs. He wants to make it big. Lilah just wants to make
it.
   She enlists his help. He sees her potential and encourages her.
She sees his pain and befriends him. Along the way, she and her
husband weather a crisis in their marriage (over Lilah's avocation)
and become closer still.
   The movie climaxes with two amazing monologs by the stars,
especially Hanks' brilliantly paced diatribe against ``stylists.''
   ``Punchline'' is a must-see. Rent it, if you must, but try to
buy it. It's a worthy addition to your movie library.

   ``Like a Prayer'' (Sire) _ Madonna
   
   The perfumed inner sleeve is a tip-off, if any is needed, that
this is not just a record but a Pop Culture Event. But put aside
the hype, the soft drink commercials, the soap opera marriage and
the controversial videos, and what are we left with? Ah, yes, the
music.
   The fact is, Madonna knows how to make ear-catching pop music.
This is not high art, but neither is it the pasteurized processed
music substitute that fills the airwaves of radio stations with
such names like as 101. It may be bubble gum, but with a spicier
flavor than most.
   The most interesting track is ``Love Song,'' a collaboration
with Prince. The two flamboyant stars work surprisingly well
together, their vocal tricks backed by sinuous guitar and
synthesizer music to create a mood of sexual tension. Less
successful is ``Express Yourself,'' imitation Motown that calls for
a huskier voice _ Madonna is no belter.
   Several songs deal with family relationships: the death of a
mother in ``Promise to Try,'' a cruel parent in ``Oh Father,'' a
violently crumbling marriage in ``Till Death Do Us Part.'' However
close the stories may be to Madonna's own life, a bit of genuine
emotion does come through amid the slick production and stylized
singing. But don't look for insight; the lyrics are simple and
sentimental. The cause of marital strife: ``He's not in love with
her anymore.''
   Then there's the hit title track with its quasi-religious
imagery (``When you call my name it's like a little prayer'').
There's really nothing new about that _ references to heaven and
angels abound in teen love songs. The viewpoint here, as throughout
the album, is adolescent. But then, consider the audience.

   ``Don't Tell a Soul'' (Sire) _ The Replacements
   
   The Replacements' gradual switch from a raucous punk sound to a
more mature, melodic rock has drawn plenty of complaints from old
fans who snipe that they're selling out.
   It's all rather silly.
   If the music's good, it will find an audience. But in this case,
the audience won't be terribly large. ``Don't Tell a Soul'' isn't a
breakthrough because too many of its songs lack the bite and wit of
leader Paul Westerberg's best work, whatever the style.
   Westerberg's a critic's darling because he combines the scruffy
attitude of lower middle-class punk, a weary voice roughened by too
many cigarettes and a keen writer's eye that frequently explores
the vulnerability of himself and others.
   His band used to thrash Westerberg's songs out in a drunken orgy
of noise, but they're getting older now. Slower tempos and acoustic
guitars are showing up in the Replacements repertoire.
   Westerberg's strengths are used best on the country-flavored
``Achin' to Be,'' about trying to unwrap the mysteries of a woman
who ``dances alone in a nightclub.''
   The album opener, ``Talent Show,'' is extremely effective in
capturing the mood of anticipation that comes with a rock show. The
jaunty ``Asking Me Lies,'' which talks about a Mexican bar mitzvah,
and ``I'll Be You'' are also strong.
   But songs such as ``Back to Back'' and ``We'll Inherit the
Earth'' sound tentative and self-conscious. It's not the style
changes; it's just a lack of strong material. And the Replacements
aren't adept enough at covering up the lost feeling that comes when
they're working on a sub-par composition.
   Despite the occasional flashes, ``Don't Tell a Soul'' is flat, a
workmanlike album from a band that probably has better days ahead.

<HEAD>Star Watch: The Odd Couple</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Talk about odd couples: one is calm, Jewish
and deaf, the other is excitable, black and blind.
   That's the basis for the new comedy-adventure, ``See No Evil,
Hear No Evil.'' Wally, the deaf one, is played by Gene Wilder.
Dave, who is blind, is Richard Pryor. It's the third pairing of the
two disparate stars, whose careers and personal lives have had a
bumpy ride in recent times.
   Wilder, born Jerry Silberman in Milwaukee 53 years ago, won an
Academy nomination for Mel Brooks' ``The Producers,'' starred in
``Blazing Saddles'' and ``Young Frankenstein,'' directed himself in
``The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother'' and ``The
World's Greatest Lover.'' His film appearances have been few in
recent times, largely because of the illness of his wife, the
comedian Gilda Radner, who has been treated for ovarian cancer.
Pryor, 48, who grew up in his grandmother's Peoria, Ill., brothel,
has starred in headlines almost as much as movies. His marriages,
divorces, paternity suit, near-death and recovery from burns while
freebasing have made lively reading. He wrote and directed the
autobiographical ``Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling.'' His recent
films have been overshadowed by the new kid on the block, Eddie
Murphy.
   Wilder and Pryor co-starred successfully in ``Silver Streak''
and ``Stir Crazy.'' Before the opening of ``See No Evil, Hear No
Evil,'' they sat down for a joint interview. Here are highlights of
that conversation:
   Q. Both of you have directed your own films. Was there ever a
time during this movie when you wanted to say, ``Hey, let's do it
this way''?
   Pryor: Arthur Hiller directed this picture. To me, it was just
amazing how he kept the geometry of the picture in his head. He
always knew something that nobody else knew.
   Wilder: The only thing I wanted to say was, ``Thank you, thank
you, thank you, for staying for the rushes until 9:30, for eating
your dinner at 11, and getting to the set before anyone else, and
answering all those questions about the props and the lights and
costumes. Thank you for letting me go off when shooting is over,
take my time, take a little stroll.''
   Q. But you both will direct again, yes?
   Pryor: Unfortunately, yes. That's something you don't get over.
It's great fun.
   Wilder: Yes, I'll direct again. If I write something and I say,
``This I will have to direct,'' I will. If it's personal enough, it
might get lost somewhere. Otherwise, I'll let someone else direct.
   Q. What is that magic chemistry that seems to work between you
two?
   Wilder: We've talked about it, believe me. But we've said,
``Let's shut up, because we don't know the answer.'' We might get
in trouble if we tried to intellectualize it.
   Pryor: I'm just glad it works.
   Wilder: It's there, it works: cold fusion. I don't know how or
why.
   Q. Don't you ever get a little bit exasperated with each other
and say, ``Hold it, we can do this better''?
   Wilder: It's not an exasperation with each other. It's like,
we've done (a scene) 10 times and everyone's anxious to get on to
the next setup and Richard has a sad face. I know it wasn't right
all the way, but I see that sad face, and I say, ``What's the
matter?'' ``I don't think it was so good.'' ``I don't think so,
either. Arthur, oh Arthur.'' He doesn't question that we don't
think it was there yet.
   Q. Gene, how would you analyze Richard's comedy?
   Wilder: I don't know if he should hear this. He came up in
comedy from a different road, and we seemed to have met somewhere
at a similar point, but from very different backgrounds. I don't
think it matters much what the path was. I laugh at him, and I make
him laugh. Together we're very funny. That's the only thing that
counts.
   Q. Richard, can you analyze Gene's comedy?
   Pryor: I want to listen to him, I know that. I listen to what
he's saying, and it triggers something in me. That's one element:
listening to him. It's a pleasure.
   Wilder: When most actors do a scene 14 times, it will be pretty
much the same each time; it's not the nature of the art, but it's
the nature of the beast.... If we did a scene 14 times, it's going
to be different 14 times. Not only do you have to pay attention,
you're compelled to pay attention.
   Q. There are a lot of laughs in ``See No Evil, Hear No Evil,''
making comic use of deafness and blindness. Are you worried that
some people might say you're poking fun at infirmities, just as
they criticized ``A Fish Called Wanda'' for making fun of
stuttering.
   Wilder: We don't think so. We took great pains for months before
the first day of shooting to make sure there would be no fun made,
to make sure ... that people with seeing and hearing disabilities
would be laughing.
   Pryor: Gene did a lot of research here at the Braille Institute
and went through the script to eliminate anything that might be
offensive. He was very aware of it, and so was I. Arthur Hiller,
too.
   Q. You did some research of your own, Richard?
   Pryor: Yes, I went to the Braille Institute and studied to find
out what it would be like if you were blind after being sighted
most of your life. I wanted to find out what not to do, and the one
thing I was told was: ``Don't tap your cane.'' Little things like
that were very helpful.
   Q. You've had personal trials, Gene, with Gilda's illness.
What's the situation now?
   Wilder: Gilda's got a book coming out in June called ``It's
Always Something.'' Everything you want to know is in the book. ...
I didn't work for 2{ years or three years. When I started working
on this picture, it was a great relief. I was back home where I
belong.
   Q. And you, Richard? You haven't been in the public prints
lately.
   Pryor: Good! Today I'm a very happy man. I'm thrilled about the
work we've done in this film. I was delighted with the work Gene
did on the script (he shares credit with four other writers). I
liked working with an excellent director and very good actors. We
worked hard to make it look like we were not working hard. I'm
happy.
   Q. What about future projects?
   Pryor: I'm working in a film now, ``Harlem Nights,'' with Eddie
Murphy.
   Wilder: I'm writing. I want to write something that's right for
Richard and me.

<HEAD>The Artists: Menotti Directs First Mozart Opera at Spoleto Festival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Composer Gian Carlo Menotti will direct his
first Mozart opera in the United States at this year's Spoleto
Festival.
   ``The Marriage of Figaro'' is already sold out for seven
performances at the Spoleto Festival U.S.A. in Charleston, S.C.,
which runs May 26 through June 11.
   However, in an interview before leaving for the 13th annual
festival, Menotti was more enthusiastic about performances by the
Colla Family Marionettes.
   ``When I was a child in Milan, there was a small theater, a
replica of La Scala, for the Colla puppets,'' he said. ``All
children from Milan were dying to go see them on Sundays. They had
ballets. Some were replicas of the 1890s _ very small.
   ``Then they were just forgotten _ except by Gian Carlo. When I
started the festival in Spoleto, Italy (in 1958), I made an
investigation about the Colla puppets. I called up the family and
said, `Please unpack those puppets and come to Spoleto.' They were
thrilled to come. ... They are quaint. They are like old-fashioned
dolls; they have that charm.''
   The Colla Marionettes were a hit at the Charleston event in
1987; this time Menotti sought, and got, sponsorship from Coca-Cola.
   About ``The Marriage of Figaro,'' the composer-conductor said it
was an opera of love.
   ``All the music is sweet tenderness,'' he said. ``It's nothing
to do with politics. The acidity of the Beaumarchais play is
nowhere to be felt. At the end, everybody is happy.''
   When he rehearses ``Figaro,'' Menotti does the first scene to
see what the singers can do, then jumps to the fourth act.
``Everybody does the first and second act very well, the third a
little less and they don't direct the fourth act at all.
   ``In my first rehearsals, I don't say anything. I want to see
what they do instinctively. Some, all you have to do is guide them.
I like to work with young people. You get with stars, sometimes you
have trouble.''
   His ``Figaro'' staging won't be eccentric, Menotti said. ``I go
straight to the score, read what the librettist said, see what the
music tells me to do. It may already have been done. I don't care.''
   Menotti is acclaimed as an opera director. H took over the
``Figaro'' when Patrice Chereau dropped out for a film commitment.
Menotti had declared that he'd stage only his own operas after the
``Parsifal'' he directed last summer in Trieste.
   ``I love `Parsifal.' The opera is about compassion,'' he said.
``One thing is so clear in the score. Parsifal is epileptic.
Everytime he talks about his mother he starts to tremble. In the
second act I make him faint. He has a tremendous mother complex _
before Freud.
   ``The only thing I changed from Wagner is, the grail is taken
away. At the end Parsifal takes the grail and goes out into the
world. For me the grail is the symbol of hope and peace.''
   ``Otello'' is an opera in which the title character is usually
directed as epileptic. Menotti believes Otello suffers instead from
jealousy. ``You've never been jealous like I have been. I've
suffered jealousy so strong I could have killed.''
   Menotti's most recent opera is ``Wedding Day,'' composed for the
Olympics in Seoul last September and based on a Korean legend.
   ``I had chosen a cast in America of Koreans,'' he said. ``I was
only allowed to bring two of them. I was in a theater where the
curtain took a whole minute to go up or down. The opera was in six
scenes so 12 minutes was spent on the curtain.''
   Menotti also ran into cultural problems in nearly every scene.
In the first, he had two friends who hadn't seen each other for
years meet and embrace.
   ``They said, `They can't touch.' I had the music passionate and
the people facing each other with praying hands,'' he said.
   In Charleston, Jean-Yves Thibaudet will give a recital on
opening night, dedicating the festival's new Steinway piano from
Germany. Besides ``Figaro,'' there also is Bellini's ``La
Straniera,'' which was last fully staged in the United States at a
New York performance in 1834.
   There also will be a play, chamber music, dance and jazz.
   Menotti is trying to raise money to build a theater near his
home in Scotland. ``It's so I won't have to travel around the
world. I'd like to have a theater outside my door so I can prepare
my things there. All I need is $1 million.''
   The composer of ``Amahl and the Night Visitors'' said that one
of several commissions he has is for a children's opera for the
Atlanta Symphony.
   ``Robert Shaw (Atlanta director) wants it for his farewell,''
Menotti said. ``One is a trio for the Chamber Music Society of
Lincoln Center. One is a piano concerto.''
   He also is starting a book, to be titled ``Memoirs and
Fantasies.''
   ``It's going to be like Swiss cheese, full of holes. What I
can't remember, I'll make up,'' he said.
   But don't look for Menotti to ``get even'' with anybody. ``I
think there is nothing worse than being vindictive. It's one thing
I want to avoid.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: The Return of Phoebe Snow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1980s haven't been too kind to Phoebe Snow.
But then, nor have the '70s or any other time.
   ``I've had an incredibly difficult life,'' the song stylist
says, as she lets the world know that Phoebe Snow is back, alive
and quite well.
   ``I feel a little bit like I'm in the safety zone. Things are
fairly peaceful compared to how they've been. It sort of makes you
appreciate how tenuous life can be and how fragile and how precious.
   ``I'm afraid to say that too much, afraid the house will fall on
me. When you've been scuffling, you don't want to do anything to
start trouble in the waters again.''
   Snow, who describes herself as a former ``wandering minstrel,''
is finding her comeback welcome. Critics and fans hailed her recent
performance at the Bottom Line in New York, and her new LP,
``Something Real,'' has received an enthusiastic response. It's her
first since ``Rock Away'' in 1981.
   The main reason Snow hasn't been able to pursue her career
consistently is because she has been living in New Jersey caring
for her 13-year-old daughter, Valerie, who was born severely
brain-damaged.
   ``I have a wonderful woman, since November,'' Snow says. ``She's
a blessing from God. We've had some not-so-nice people. ... She
spoils Valerie rotten, but that's OK.
   ``To do what I do most efficiently, eventually I'll have to have
more than one person to take care of my daughter.''
   Snow's husband, musician Phil Kearns, left her while Valerie was
still a baby. Their marriage ended legally in 1979.
   Her career, which quickly took flight in the early '70s, slipped
away just as easily. Inexperienced in the music business, she broke
a number of contracts with record companies and others and found
herself embroiled in a number of lawsuits and severe financial
problems. But her career and all other problems have taken a back
seat to her daughter.
   Though the '80s haven't been easy, Snow maintains a sense of
humor.
   ``The busiest live year was 1983. I did almost 90 dates that
year. It was the Invisible Phoebe Snow Tour. It was the best-kept
secret, pretty low budget, not much advertising,'' she said.
   ``It was anybody's guess as to whether we'd survive. I was ill.
I'm one of those people who feels quite driven to do things and
regrets it afterwards. I'll never forget San Francisco. I had
bronchial pneumonia. They found a doctor who said, `Don't worry,
I'll get her on stage.' This is not an uncommon story.
   ``I was so sick I was almost crawling on my hands and knees on
stage. I couldn't sing. My throat was completely closed up. I did a
comedy routine. I thought, `I better keep talking or I'm going to
pass out.' It was spontaneity based upon desperation. Everytime I
looked at the keyboard player he was in tears laughing.
   ``I can't remember one thing I said.
   ``I'm going to write a book. Part of it is going to be some of
the road experiences. Promoters come up with the doctors: `You're
geting the mystery doctor.' People think this is a glamorous job.
Surprise!''
   Last year, Snow had a hit duet record with Dave Mason, ``The
Dreams I Dream.'' Earlier, she did a featured background part on
Joe Cocker's ``The One,'' the B side of his ``Unchain My Heart.''
   She also gave a number of performances at Acme, a downtown
Manhattan club. ``A lot of my friends were in the house band. Every
Wednesday night was blues night. Nothing was allowed but 12-bar
blues. Cyndi Lauper came down and jammed one night. John Waite and
Carole King and her daughter sang. It was really fun.''
   At the time her first album, ``Phoebe Snow,'' and hit single,
``Poetry Man,'' came out in 1974, Snow was an insecure person. No
more.
   ``There are turning points in everyone's life where you decide
if you're going to sink or swim. My insecurity wasn't serving me
well at all. It was really a stumbling block,'' she said.
   ``You read up on it. You watch how other people function.
Wallowing in insecurity can be a very tiresome thing for yourself
and anyone around you. I'm in analysis. You don't like the way
things are working, you've got to change them. Searching your soul
can also be exhausting.
   ``I want my life to run as smoothly as it can run. In this
business, that's a joke.''
   There's no man in her life now. ``I'm tired of having failed
relationships, so I'd prefer not to have any. I don't know if I
came out and said that before. I'm saying it now. I'm saying to all
the men who've been in my life, `Thank you very much for the
experience. Goodbye.'
   ``I'm not conventional or conservative. But in that regard, I
always thought I'd live with a man who was my friend and partner in
life. I believe I will meet a nice man and settle down. That's
something I'm striving for. I'm not ready yet.''
   Snow took a visualization course to help her reorganize her life.
   ``You close your eyes, relax your body and see how your life is
now juxtaposed with how you'd like it to be. We practiced it every
week. There was a lot of humor in it,'' she said.
   ``A good percentage of what I visualized is happening now. You
can say it would have happened anyhow. But I would recommend
visualization. For one thing, it takes your mind off everything
else.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Outside Her Glass Walls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GERMAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TROY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inside her house of glass, Joyce Carol Oates
lives to haunt her readers, writing books with all the anguish of
Thomas Hardy and all the breadth of Dickens.
   Outside her glass-walled house in Princeton, N.J., there's a
different Oates, one who makes fewer demands, one who really wants
to be liked.
   Oates surprised her audience at a recent literary reading at
Russell Sage College in Troy, just north of Albany. The audience
knew of Oates' fascination with doubles and alter egos. They also
wondered how one writer could churn out two or more hefty books a
year while teaching and lecturing. But hearing her on stage, they
thought there really might be two Joyce Carol Oates, and that night
they got the funny one.
   She began with a terse, cryptic piece that was over before the
audience had a chance to really tune in. There was a silence, a few
coughs. No one was sure if literary etiquette allowed them to
applaud.
   ``If that means nothing to you, you're very lucky,'' Oates said
before moving on to a slightly longer piece. ``I feel you're
getting strength now and can handle longer work.''
   Later, when the audience did applaud, she thanked them, but
added, ``I assume you're applauding to hurry me up.''
   The audience had come to hear the bookish, 50-year-old Princeton
professor who has published 50 works since 1963 _ harsh and
haunting and lyrical books in which used furniture salesmen fall
victim to McCarthyism, and suicide is always an option.
   Instead, they saw a lanky woman who told funny stories.
   When she first started publishing, she submitted stories under
the name ``J.C. Oates.''
   ``I had the erroneous idea it was a world inhospitable to women
writers,'' she said. ``Editors would assume `J.C. Oates' was a man.
Maybe they were right in some symbolic way.''
   That leads to her fascination with doubles. The worst day of her
life was caused by her alter ego, or ``the double who undone me,''
Oates says. The double is Rosamond Smith, the pseudonym she adopted
to publish last year's novel, ``Lives of the Twins.'' Oates didn't
tell her agent or her publisher, E.P. Dutton. Both were peeved.
   ``I just wanted a new identity, kind of a freshness, to have a
book come out where nobody was comparing it to other books,'' she
said in an interview. ``You can't escape your identity. That's very
frustrating.''
   ``Lives of the Twins'' deals with twin brothers whose polar
personalities merge as they fight for the same woman. Oates has
written a second novel as Rosamond Smith _ being happily published
by Dutton _ which centers again on doubles. ``Soul Mate,'' due out
this spring, is about a Princeton-type professor involved with her
opposite, a charming, Ted Bundyish psychopathic killer.
   Her latest novel, ``American Appetites,'' takes place in a
fictional town in New York's lower Hudson Valley. The setting is a
camouflaged Princeton, and the main characters live in the same
glass-walled house Oates shares with her husband, Raymond Smith.
   Like all her writing, ``American Appetites'' has an intensity
and ferocity that disturbs readers. The main character, Ian
McCullough, is tried for manslaughter in the accidental death of hi
wife:
   ``Had he really thought she would be returned to him and their
life would continue as always? _ as if nothing had happened? _
seizing her shoulders as he had, in a paroxysm of murderous rage,
and throwing her backward, helplessly backward, into death: into a
sheet of glass.''
   A Princeton colleague has called Oates the fourth Bronte sister,
while John Updike suggested Oates was born 100 years too late, that
she belonged amid ``a race of Victorian word-eaters.''
   ``She has, I fear, rather overwhelmed the puny, parsimonious
critical establishment of this country,'' Updike writes.
   She won the National Book Award for her novel, ``them,''
received the O. Henry Prize for Continuing Achievement in the Short
Story and is a perpetual Nobel Prize candidate.
   Even so, critics complain about the complexity of Oates' work
and her handling of traditionally male subjects. She's been accused
of writing like a man, even of writing too much.
   If there's a question Oates hates, it's ``Why so much
violence?'' In her novel ``Wonderland,'' a father kills his family
before shooting himself. In ``Expensive People,'' a young son plans
suicide by gorging himself after killing his mother. In
``Bellefleur,'' a vulture flies off with a bleeding baby in its
talons, and the heir-apparent of a dynastic clan wipes out his
family by crashing an airplane into their castle.
   So why so much violence?
   Most writers have violence in their fiction, Oates says, citing
former Princeton colleague E.L. Doctorow's novel ``Billy
Bathgate,'' about gangster Dutch Schultz.
   ``It's much more violent than anything I've written,'' she said.
``But I notice in the reviews that (Doctorow) gets, there's never
any mention of that. I think that's because he's a male writer.''
   There's violence in Oates' ancestry. Oates' grandfather died in
a tavern brawl, and her great-grandfather killed himself after
trying to shoot his wife.
   Oates grew up just outside the Erie Canal town of Lockport, N.Y.
Her father, Frederic, was an autoworker and signpainter; her
mother, Carolina, a housewife.
   Fred Oates, a former amateur boxer, got his daughter interested
in boxing when he took her to Golden Gloves matches in Buffalo in
the 1950s. The interest revived when she researched her novel,
``You Must Remember This,'' leading her to a friendship with
heavyweight champ Mike Tyson and to ringside commentary at fights.
Oates also wrote a book-length essay, ``On Boxing,'' examining the
sport not so much as athletics but as drama or dance.
   Felix Stevick, a character in ``You Must Remember This,'' is a
boxer; Oates' research makes her feel as if she's been in the ring
herself.
   ``I really had to be in that mind that would naturally think
like a boxer, so I just imbued myself with it,'' she said. ``It was
as if I had a lifetime partly as Felix Stevick.''
   Filmmaker Martin Scorsese, who memorialized boxer Jake LaMotta
in ``Raging Bull,'' has optioned the movie version of ``You Must
Remember This.''
   As Rosamond Smith, Oates writes simpler tales of suspense, books
that might win her broader appeal. But she doesn't believe she'll
ever have a huge following.
   ``I don't think I could be a popular writer,'' she said. ``My
writing's too difficult. `Bellefleur' was a best seller, but my
secret feeling is that people bought the book and couldn't finish
it.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: He Walked 1,600 Miles to Sing on Opry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For country music singer David Stewart,
nothing will ever beat how he was given a guest spot on the Grand
Ole Opry: He walked 1,600 miles,
   Stewart, at age 37, spent about three months last year walking
from Wyoming to Nashville to try to impress Opry officials how much
he wanted to sing on the fabled country music show. He left his
home in Gillette, Wyo., on April 30 and arrived in Nashville July
22, having lost 25 pounds and worn out three pairs of walking shoes.
   As a reward, the Opry gave him a one-time guest shot on the show
and he sang two songs last July 23.
   ``We all have dreams,'' he says, looking back on his ambitious
adventure a year later. ``But not all of them come true. Mine did.''
   Since his walk and the Opry performance, he has moved to
Nashville. He has taken voice lessons, pursued a songwriting career
and made a music video about his trek.
   ``If nothing else happens, I've fulfilled my dream,'' he said in
an interview. ``There's not a thing I can complain about.''
   Stewart, who has been singing country music most of his adult
life, walked through Wyoming, Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois
and Kentucky before reaching his destination.
   Accompanied by his dog, Snicker, he averaged 22 miles a day, six
days a week. A friend followed him in a motor home, where he slept
except for occasional complimentary lodging that was offered.
   ``The chamber of commerce in a couple of places arranged for a
room and a hot bath,'' he recalled. ``That was nice.''
   After reaching Nashville, he placed a call to Opry manager Hal
Durham, who had heard about the walk through news reports.
   Stewart, born and raised in Bradenton, Fla., recounted the
conversation: ``He said, `I understand you walked 1,600 miles to be
on the Opry. That's a long way son.' I said, `Yes sir.'''
   Durham then invited him to sing the next night, and Stewart sang
``In the Wings of the Grand Ole Opry'' and ``Jambalaya.''
   ``I had all the emotions of excitement and anxiety,'' he
recalled. ``I hear the recording of that night and I can hear that
I was on the edge of breaking up. I have to pinch myself to realize
it's true. I still get chills when I think about it.''
   He was received warmly by the audience after finishing his first
song, and did an encore.
   He decided not to return to his job in Wyoming at a fast food
restaurant which he partly owned. But he still realizes income from
it, which has helped him to meet expenses while trying to further
his singing career in Nashville.
   ``For the first couple of months here, I just unwound,'' he
said. ``I gathered my thoughts and figured out where I was going
with my career.''
   He has visited backstage at the Opry, but not performed any more.
   ``I realize it's for established stars,'' Stewart said.
   He has not pursued a recording contract, preferring to finish
the video which he plans to use as a selling point for a contract
with a major label. In case a music career doesn't pan out, he's
passed the exam for a real estate license.
   ``I found people here receptive, but it's still hard to break in
because there's so much talent here,'' he said. ``It's a matter of
getting the right breaks at the right time and meeting the right
people.''
   ``I still don't feel like I've broken in in a big way. My
biggest dream has come true _ singing on the Opry. Now I intend to
work hard to become a (regular) member of the Opry. I want to be
able to walk on that stage many more times.''
   Most of the 25 pounds he lost on his walk have returned to his
tanned frame.
   ``My wife tells me every day I need to get this weight off,'' he
said. ``I have a weakness for catfish. That fried food will put it
on you.''

<HEAD>Careers: Nurse Salaries</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP LaserPhotos NY700, NY701</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Nurses' salaries are beginning to improve in response to the
critical nursing shortage.
   Salary increases during l988 averaged 6.9 percent for
entry-level nurses and 10.6 percent for more experienced nursing
staff, reports Richard McKibbin, who handles research for the
American Nurses Association in Kansas City.
   Advancement opportunities, flexible scheduling, tuition
assistance and other enticements also are being brought into play
to help hospitals replenish their nursing staffs.
   About 165,000 jobs were open for registered nurses at the
beginning of l989, according to the Secretary's Commission on
Nursing of the Department of Health and Human Services.
   The recent wage settlement for nurses at New York's
Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital may be a harbinger. The hospital
agreed to raise starting salaries for nurses to $31,500, and nurses
with more than 20 years' experience will receive $47,000. The pact,
negotiated with the New York State Nurses Association, eliminates
both mandatory overtime and assignment of nurses outside their
specialties. Some of the money to pay for the settlement will come
from New York state, which recently set aside $193 million to
increase nursing salaries statewide for the year.
   The settlement for the first time ``addresses nurses as
professionals,'' said Sheila O'Rourke, Columbia-Presbyterian nurse,
as the agreement was made.
   The figures are well above the $22,416 entry-level and $32,160
senior nurse averages for l988 reported by the ANA. Spokeswoman
Carol Grimaldi says these figures are still more realistic for most
of the country, which doesn't share the high cost of living with
metropolitan centers on both coasts.
   Specialist nurses like anesthetists can expect salaries
averaging slightly more than $45,000 per year, says Mary Jeannette
Mannino, president of the American Association of Nurse Anethetists
in Park Ridge, Ill. Starting salaries for anesthetist nurses is
estimated at between $31,000 and $40,000.
   ``The money didn't make any difference at the time I chose nurse
anesthesia, but it does make a difference now, and I think it
should make a difference,'' says Margaret Faut, associate
chairperson of surgical nursing at Rush Presbyterian St. Luke's
Medical Center in Chicago. `` Personally, I think salary should be
a consideration in making career choices.
   ``I'm a single parent with two children, and I'm thankful that I
have this career. You don't want to pick a profession because the
pay is good, but it doesn't hurt, either.''
   The University Hospital Consortium, Inc., a network of 48
not-for-profit teaching hospitals and clinics, has launched a
recruitment campaign that emphasizes improved pay, advancement and
working conditions.
   ``By and large, today's nurses look for more than a steady
income,'' says Kristi Kelsey, a nursing personnel specialist and RN
who directs UHC's Recruitment Network, based in Oakbrook Terrace,
Ill. ``They want opportunities to progress through their work to
the point where they can specialize, manage, conduct research or
teach.''
   She says that many of the teaching hospitals are offering nurses
continuing education for advancement, tuition reimbursement,
nursing rounds and in-depth orientation and internships.
   ``In light of a steadily growing population of older Americans,
expanding medical technology and the greater incidence of
catastrophic diseases, we will need more, not fewer, nurses as we
enter the next century,'' Kelsey says.
   The shortage is letting experienced nurses ``pick and choose
exactly what they are looking for,'' she says.
   Salaries for nurses have risen faster than for any other
profession during the past year, says Dr. Carol A. Brooks, vice
president for nursing at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New
Hyde Park, N.Y. ``At last, the money's getting there to provide a
lifestyle to go with a busy professional life.''

   Judi Devin's career ladder had hit a ceiling.
Joan Lieb needed more rewards from her job.
   Their reasons were different, but the result was the same _ both
women decided to start their own businesses.
   And their numbers are growing _ both in people and in profits.
   An estimated 5 million women now own businesses in the United
States, says the Chicago-based National Association of Women
Business Owners.
   Statistics compiled by the association show women contributed
$250 billion to the economy in 1988. Of that, $37 billion went into
the U.S. Treasury and $13 billion into state and local coffers.
   Devin, who serves as a spokeswoman for the association, says
women are starting businesses at three to five times the rate of
their male counterparts. Many of the new female entrepreneurs
entered the corporate world in the 1970s, she said in a recent
interview.
   ``These women were the most educated in history,'' she added.
``Many were feeling frustrated for not being allowed to reach their
full potential in a business sense and started looking for
alternatives.''
   That condition is known as the ``glass ceiling,'' and it's a
condition Devin herself knows well.
   In 1975, she was the first woman manager in her division at one
of the country's largest computer and data service companies. But
four years later, she felt her options were ``not as many as I
would have liked.''
   So she started her own Minneapolis company, Medium Well Done,
which designs and develops instructional projects. And now her list
of international clients includes her former bosses.
   Lieb was unhappy at a large Chicago real estate company, so in
1980, with five other women, she founded Beliard Gordon &amp; Partners,
a residential real estate company.
   She and her partners felt their take-home pay should have been
increased as their sales volume increased _ something their
previous company did not offer. So they decided to work for
themselves.
   ``We sell homes from $50,000 to $2 million, and we lead all the
other real estate companies in the area in the sale of single
family homes,'' Lieb said.
   She said the firm sold $140 million in residential property in
1988, though she would not give profit figures.
   Ironically, Lieb said, most of the top producers in residential
real estate sales are women _ one reason all but one of the firm's
25 sales associates also are women.
   ``Buying or selling a home is an emotional experience,'' she
said. ``Sometimes it's done in the worst period of life for the
customer, who many times is buying or selling because of
relocation, divorce or death.
   ``We are dealing with people at a time of upheaval, you have to
be sensitive. We are not dealing with just two bedrooms and a bath,
which is why women are good at it.''
   And the increasing number of women business owners serves as an
incentive to other women.
   Peggy Leonard, president of the 14-year-old National Association
of Women Business Owners, says the organization offers forums for
women to ask questions and give advice in running businesses.
   Ms. Leonard, who operates Computer Training and Support Services
in Lake Geneva, Ill., says many of the women in the organization
came from the corporate world, though the group does not keep track
of the reasons its members start their own companies.
   ``We like our remedy, which is business ownership,'' Ms. Leonard
said.
   The association is involved in extensive lobbying in Congress on
issues affecting women business owners, and it helped convince
Congress to approve the Women Business Ownershp Act last year.
   That law requires the federal government to collect data on
female-owned businesses, something not done in the past.
   The bill also allows the Small Business Administration to give
out loans, and it established a task force look into problems faced
by women-owned businesses.
   However, Congress dropped a provision that would have created a
government outreach program to bring women-owned businesses into
federal contract procurement.
   ``Government had $200 billion in procurement contracts last
year,'' Ms. Devin said. ``Women's businesses got less than 1
percent.''
   ``Access to U.S. contracts is a big negative,'' added Ms.
Leonard. ``There is much inequality.''
   She noted that the government never has had an outreach program
to encourage women-owned businesses to obtain government contracts.
   ``In addition, women are not traditionally in the circle in
which such contracts are obtained,'' Ms. Leonard said.
   ``There is an old boy network, but that is starting to change.''

   It takes money to turn good ideas into thriving
businesses.
   And since 28 percent of all small businesses in the United
States are owned by women, the American Woman's Economic
Development Corporation has formulated a ``10 C's of Loan
Literacy'' checklist.
   Credibility. Be straightforward and cooperative with information
when applying for a loan.
   Competence. Show a resume to the lender that demonstrates your
experience in your field or a related business.
   Capital. Your company must meet its current obligations from
cash internally generated, and profits should be re-invested in the
business. Show where start-up capital comes from, i.e., family,
friends, or associates.
   Credit. You need a ``clean'' credit history, meaning that your
business debts have been repaid as agreed. Both your business and
personal credit histories must be clean, as well as those of any
co-signers who agree to guarantee the debt.
   Collateral. This is especially important for a start-up company.
You should be able to show what it is, where it is, what it's
worth, and who appraised it.
   Cash flow. Past cash flow performance and your projected cash
flow will be examined by the lender. Show all prior financial
statements. If the company is just starting, show a projected
profit-and-loss statement for at least one year. The lender wants
to know what profits will be left after expenses, including
interest on the proposed loan, to ensure that principal
installments will be paid.
   Contingencies. Demonstrate to the lender that you are aware of
business risks and have a reserve set aside to deal with them.
   Control. The lender wants to be assured that you manage daily
operations well enough to collect accounts receivable and to
generate cash to pay current expenses on time. The terms you've
negotiated with suppliers and how they can be improved are part of
your managerial profile.
   Competition. Show how your business compares with others in
sales and profits and what gives your business the edge over
competitors. Tell how you plan to improve your company's
competitive position.
   Confidence. In requesting a loan, show how well versed you are
in the language of finance.
   AWED, a non-profit organization, points out that preparing a
loan presentation takes practice and planning. Technical assistance
programs to help you put it together may be available locally, or
from AWED in New York City.

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) _ What makes a successful entrepreneur? A
recent Massachusetts Institute of Technology survey reports that
many are immigrants, the offspring of self-employed parents, and
hold advanced degrees.
   The survey of 99 graduates recently honored by the university
gives some insight into people who give up the security of salaries
and take risks to start their own businesses.
   The honored graduates include sociology consultants, financial
managers and computer technicians, singled out for their ``hard
work, foresight and courage.''
   Collectively, they have created 100,000 jobs in Massachusetts
and 250,000 worldwide in fields that range from women's apparel to
geotechnical engineering. The cumulative sales of their companies
total $25 billion annually.
   According to the survey, 73 percent earned a degree above the
bachelor level, and 33 percent went on to doctoral or post-doctoral
work.
   Sixteen percent started their companies while they were still at
school, 34 percent set up shop within five years of graduating, and
23 percent opened for business between six and 10 years after
graduation. Two percent began their companies more than 20 years
after graduation.
   The survey said more than half were children of parents who
founded their own companies.
   Many companies had inauspicious beginnings in basements or rough
neighborhoods with minimal staff and equipment. But some of the
entrepreneurs had more colorful starts.
   Clark Abt, founder of the social sciences consulting firm, Abt
Associates, built ship models and sold them to Saks Fifth Avenue
when he was only 12. Harold ``Doc'' Edgerton, whom the institute
called ``the father of flash photography,'' attempted to market his
first strobe equipment through General Electric Co., but GE wasn't
interested.
   The most important lessons they learned at MIT, the
entrepreneurs said, were problem solving, the importance of hard
work, confidence and the belief that anything is possible.
   The entrepreneurs recommended that aspiring business owners
begin by identifying a market opportunity and matching it with an
appropriate technology. They advised selecting partners with
talents that complement their own, pointing out that the success of
the enterprise depends on employee performance.

   Corporate managers may have themselves to blame
for the secretary shortage, says the president of one of the
country's biggest business schools.
   ``Management needs to understand what it takes to attract and
keep intelligent people as secretaries,'' says Eleanor P. Vreeland,
president of Katharine Gibbs School, Inc. ``Managers have to
recognize secretaries as an integral and productive part of their
team and include them in the planning and goals of the business.
This will make secretaries feel like they have a direct link to the
success of the business and will, in turn, reduce secretarial
turnover.''
   There are 3 million secretaries in the United States,
representing the largest single part of the office work force.
Salaries range from about $15,000 to $30,000 a year for this
predominantly female profession (98.4 percent), yet about 80,000
secretarial jobs a year remain unfilled. The Bureau of Labor
Statistics projects that 400,000 new secretaries will be needed in
the coming decade, making them the eleventh largest job category
overall.
   Vreeland says the reason for high secretarial turnover is
because so many managers don't consider the secretary part of the
managerial team, even though the average secretary shoulders more
administrative responsibility and must have higher technical skill
than she did five years ago.
   ``By the l990s, we hope the secretarial profession is what Gibbs
always envisioned it to be _ the secretary as a true part of the
management team.''
   Vreeland recommends that the manager improve his or her
relationship with the secretary by conferring regularly about
priorities, keeping her informed about changes, using her as a
sounding board, asking her to attend meetings, and challenging her
to grow through new assignments.

   In this era of corporate
downsizing and entrepreneurial uprising, the second career may be
the norm.
   ``We're beginning to see changes in the way the working economy
is structured, with more people leaving the corporate environment
and going into smaller businesses or into business for
themselves,'' says placement specialist Phyllis Macklin. ``I don`t
have any figures for it, but it is a dramatic shift.''
   The average person usually changes jobs five times in his work
life, she observes.
   Ms. Macklin, a partner in Minsuk, Macklin, Stein &amp; Associates of
Princeton Junction, specializes in outplacement, most often working
with people who have lost their jobs in corporate cutbacks. But
many of her clients are employees who initiate change themselves.
``They know they want to move, but they can't quite figure out what
they want to do. They want to be sure they make a good move.''
   Both the fired and the restless employee face changes in fields,
income and attitudes, Ms. Macklin says.
   She encourages the terminated employee to look at his new
situation positively. ``If he has the resources to hold up for a
while, that person has the opportunity to look backward as well as
forward. Very often that person will find that what he was doing
was not as satisfying as it should have been. He can now look at
the future, at what can be new and different.''
   Many people, she says, aren't even aware of the changes they've
already made in their work lives. ``For example, someone who worked
for one company for 20 years may have started as an engineer, then
moved on to project management and other activities in which
engineering was no longer the primary function.''
   She says that those who change fields often discover that their
income level drops, at least for a while. But since the changes
frequently occur at mid-life, when children are educated and out of
the nest, the financial demands are not as high. People at this
stage are in a better position to take risks.
   ``Highly paid executives may come to recognize that they're
looking for something else. They begin to think of what they want
for themselves personally. While the salaries were wonderful, to
maintain they way they lived, they'd have to keep it flowing. Their
values change.''
   Some people shift to a self-employed or entrepreneurial status
because they truly enjoy independence, Ms. Macklin says. But if a
still-angry dismissed employee says he want to be on his own
because he says he'll never work for a company again, she tries to
discourage him.
   ``We have to get him to look for something to go to rather than
something to escape from.''
   Being let go by a large corporation is especially painful
because corporate culture has encouraged the idea of loyalty _
``the feeling of family, the security, the trappings, the idea of
going to the office.
   ``Very often, when people start their jobs, they think of the
company. They don't think of their careers as something apart.
These people need to become attuned to the business, not the
corporate, environment.''
   That business environment, she observes, is one that is
demanding higher skill from employees and is forcing them to change.

   Jo Brans' own metamorphosis from an outstanding
tenured professor to a professional writer was the starting point
for her new book, ``Take Two'' (Doubleday).
   The book chronicles the lives of 38 people who made radical
changes in their lives and careers at mid-stage. The author tells
the stories of well known people such as Hope Cooke, the former
Queen of Sikkim who is now an American housewife and tour guide,
and ordinary people like Rachel Weissman, a single white teacher
who adopted a biracial child.
   Ms. Brans taught English and achieved tenure at Southern
Methodist University in Dallas, along the way picking up a Danforth
fellowship and other honors. In l984, she put all that behind her
when she and her husband moved to New York. Instead of continuing
her academic career, she chose to become a full-time writer.
   ``I was terrified,'' she says of the beginning of her
second-stage life. But in l987 she published her first book,
``Mother, I Have Something to Tell You,'' about women whose
children chose radical news ways of life. Another book, ``Listen to
the Voices,'' a collection of interviews with writers, followed in
l988.
   That succeess inspired the new book. In her interviews she
identified many stages that were common to all second-success
stories: the first discontent, the provocation, the crisis, and the
change itself.

   For Pat Swift, it was a textbook case of being in the right
place at the right time.
   Cruising the aisles at Bloomingdale's, a New York fashion mecca,
her blond good looks and her 185-pound frame would have been hard
to miss. A clothing manufacturer with a line of large-sized
fashions spotted her and asked if she would model for an ad.
   At that moment, her professional path took a 360-degree turn.
She knew right away that she wanted a modeling career. She accepted
the offer immediately, and she's never regretted it.
   Until then, she planned a career in criminal justice and had
taken a store detective job at Bloomingdale's, waiting for a
probation service slot to become available.
   ``You have to know how you feel about what you want to do. You
have to follow your gut,'' she says.
   One of the first things she discovered along this new path was
that there were no fashion modeling agencies for large-sized women
and that she wanted to start one.
   ``There was no turning back. I got the business incorporated and
rented an office.''
   That was 11 years ago. Today her firm, Plus Models, has annual
billings of over $2 million and represents 70 large-sized models.
The success reflects manufacturers' realization that large women
want fashionable clothes and that they constitute a large part of
the market.
   She says she relishes the responsibility of managing and the
network of other attractive large women she's discovered as a
result of her work. ``I happen to enjoy working with women,'' she
says.
   In her opinion, the field has room for expansion; she says
manufacturers could offer yet more variety to the large-sized
customer.
   Her advice to anyone who encounters an unexpected opportunity is
to follow one's instincts. `` People should learn to trust
themselves.''
    --_
   More than 20 years ago, Mildred Kramer was a typical Los Angeles
housewife, tapping out figures with an adding machine to help her
husband, an accountant, during overload periods.
   Without realizing it, she was laying the groundwork for a $5
million business, helping corporations the same way, except on a
larger scale.
   In l969, with her husband's encouragement, she began processing
payments for some local businesses, including a hospital. Within
two years, she had a fully incorporated business.
   Alpha Beta Data Services, Inc., the business she founded, now
processes rent and food checks, mortgage payments and other
transactions for such firms as Bank of America, Security Pacific,
First Interstate, Imperial Bank, General Telephone, Exxon and other
corporations. The checks come in from consumers to post office
lock-boxes, and Mrs. Kramer's firm, working around the clock,
records and processes them speedily by computer.
   ``It's the small companies like ours who will prosper in the
`90s by seeking the niche that corporations find costly and
burdensome,'' Mrs. Kramer says.

   You are going to be a great artist. But how do you begin your
career?
   Back up your fine arts specialty with liberal arts and solid
business and scientific studies, advise fine arts educators. The
first interview you face will be designed to discover if you can
function in the commercial world.
   ``Indeed the artist is also an entrepreneur,'' says A. Wesley
Tower, dean of the College of Fine Arts at Millikin University in
Decatur, Ill. `` There's no shortage of talent. What we have to do
is help students develop the skills they need to be successful
artists as well as men and women.''
   Millikin is typical of many universities in insisting on strong
liberal arts and practical studies to augment fine arts major
programs. Students can major in studio or fine arts, art therapy,
art management and commercial and computer art. But they must
complete at least 35 hours of liberal arts courses for their
degrees.
   At Columbia College in Columbia, Mo., art majors must complete
programs including the same general education requirements as other
majors. ``A liberal arts background is essential for an artist,''
says Ben Cameron, associate professor of art. ``Artists, too, must
be well-read and know how to write. Otherwise you get technically
good students who have no ideas.''
   Dr. Wayne Kirby, chairman of the music department of the
University of North Carolina at Asheville, also backs liberal arts
for his students. ``We want students who can communicate and think
critically. Students must understand their place in history as far
as art goes. Otherwise, you have students who just know how to push
buttons.''
   UNCA students can major in music and recording, but they must
take math, physics and computer science to get their degrees.
   Theater students at Duke University in Durham, N.C., can get
practical grounding in the profession now that the university
theater is being used for previews of Broadway-bound commercial
productions. During the previews of Franz Kafka's
``Metamorphosis,'' marking ballet star Mikhail Baryshnikov's
dramatic debut, Duke theater management majors sat in on phone
calls and reviewed contracts for the production. Students also were
involved in set design and as understudies for the play,
``Moonlight and Valentino,'' written by Neil Simon's daughter Ellen.
   David Ball, Duke's director of drama, says that these activities
help students learn about theater as it really is.
   And at Millikin, music students also work in real performances,
starting as soon as they arrive on campus by joining any of 36
performing groups. Some of these perform nationally.
   Last winter, several Millikin students were invited to perform
at Las Vegas. `` We were asked to turn in our resumes after
performing at the Sahara Hotel,'' says student Philip Fabry. ``It
felt great. This is going to lead to bigger and better things.''

   The small Illinois community of
Effingham, population 12,000, decided two years ago to stop its
brain drain, losing its youngsters to the big cities.
   Effingham area businesses last year found themselves being
interviewed by high school students to identify career
opportunities and resource needs. The students surveyed over 100
local employers to find out what job categories existed and what
the educational requirements are.
   The about-face was part of a program dubbed ``Project
Opportunity,'' an economic development program for high school
seniors started by city officials in l987. They made a financial
commitment as well, aimed at creating or finding existing
``quality''career opportunities for the city's young people.
   Students also have designed brochures, produced marketing
videos, written pitch letters and contacted corporate presidents
and CEOs to lure new businesses into this rural area.
   As a result, the students are sharply attuned to the business
climate in their own backyard, and they've made recommendations
about the kinds of companies they`d like to see in Effingham.
Architectural and computer processing services are examples of
firms they say they`d like to work for in the future.
   The payoff of the program may not develop for several years, but
N.W. ``Bud'' Althoff, the city's industrial commission chairman,
says the project is worthwhile already because it has given
students business awareness and marketing skills. And, he says, if
nothing else it will make students take a closer look at what their
own city has to offer.

   A new fast-food franchising company is
targeting the disabled as potential owners or operators of its
stores.
   Heavenly Hot Dogs, Inc., has designed its stores to be operated
by physically disabled franchisers. ``A Heavenly Hot Dogs franchise
can be successfully operated by any entrepreneur, including an
individual whose handicap confines him to a wheelchair 100 percent
of the time,'' says Lee Lanktree, the president and chief executive
officer of the new, publicly traded company.
   Lanktree says he expects disabled people to operate at least 25
percent of all Heavenly Hot Dog franchises. The first store with a
handicapped operator opened early this year in West Palm Beach, Fla.
   The Florida Council of Handicapped Organizations and the Florida
Paraplegic Association have been working with the company and Sun
Belt banks to line up financial packages that will make ownership
possible for handicapped individuals.
   The self-contained modular Heavenly Hot Dog units, being
manufactured by Molded Fiberglass Shapes, Inc., are designed with
ramps, indented counters, cooking equipment that can be reached
from a sitting position, and aisles wide enough to provide
clearance for wheelchairs. The buildings, in the shape of giant
wooden barrels, each have 300 square feet of internal space to
support an inventory of 3,000 hot dogs and related items.

   With 900,000 new college graduates in
the job market this year, you`ve got to make it easier for your
first full-time employer to find you.
   The key elements in your campaign to stand out in the crowd are
your resume, your appearance, and the interview. Placement experts
at Dunhill Personnel System, Inc., a national employment services
organization, offer these tips for all three.
   Your resume is the first bid for attention, and its purpose is
to get you an interview.
   Keep it brief, and keep it neat. One page with wide margins is
best, but don't let it run any more than two. Use plain bond paper,
cleanly typed. Re-read it to catch typing, spelling or grammatical
errors, then have someone else read it to backstop you.
   Summarize your track record. If you've worked before _ even in a
summer job _ describe what you did, including special contributions
such as saving the company time or money. Include volunteer work.
Use active verbs; tell what you did, not what you were. Highlight
your accomplishments, experiences and academic achievements. Make
sure the resume prominently displays your name, address and phone
number. Omit any other information.
   Your resume has done its job, and now you must prepare for your
interview. Your interviewer's first impression will be the
strongest, and it will be based on your appearance. So groom and
dress carefully and appropriately for business.
   If you're a man, choose a well-fitted dark gray or navy business
suit and a crisp white long-sleeved dress shirt, with either
straight or button-down collar. Pick a traditional stripe, foulard
or paisley tie, and wear well-shined black shoes with plain dark
socks.
   If you're a woman, wear a skirt suit or a dress with a jacket,
and conservative jewelry. Choose fleshtone or neutral hosiery
shades for pump or mocassin dress shoes with low or medium heels.
   Avoid vivid colors or patterns, trendy or daring styles, and
scents of any kind _ aftershave, cologne or perfume. Grooming and
makeup should be neat and understated.
   Treat the interview the same way you would an examination at
school _ learn what you can about the company and the industry, and
anticipate what questions you may be asked. Be ready with relevant
facts about yourself, such as the strengths that will be assets to
the company and any background or interests that may relate to the
position.
   Arrive a few minutes before your appointment, allowing time to
carefully fill out any application that may be required. Greet your
interviewer cordially , maintaining eye contact. Be cooperative,
poised and friendly during the interview, and let the interviewer
lead the discussion. Don`t ask about salary, vacations, and other
benefits early in the talk. Don't make derogatory or negative
comments about past employers.
   When the meeting concludes, thank the interviewer, expressing
interest in the position (or not, as the case may be). Follow up
with a personal note in the same vein, written soon after the
appointment.

<TEXT>
   It will be easier to get a job this summer
because of economic growth, but to make the most of your
opportunities, heed the advice of Manpower, Inc., a company that
specializes in temporary jobs.
   Start early. This will give you an edge when employers make
their hiring decisions, usually at the end of May.
   Follow all leads. Newspaper ads are obvious starting points, but
don't overlook ideas from relatives, teachers and friends. Call
companies to ask about openings and get in touch with temporary
service firms. Include government job service offices in your
search. And if you've worked before, call your former employer.
   Apply in person. Dress appropriately, even for a drop-in visit
to pick up an application. Remember that phone calls may not get
past the switchboard, and messages may not get noticed.
   Be honest. Don't claim you can do something you can't. You may
be dismissed when the deficiency becomes obvious.
   Look for jobs that are learning opportunities. If you show your
eagerness to learn, you can pick up valuable skills in word
processing, computer operation, and business practices that can
help you in the future. And your summer job might turn into a
permanent one.
   Have proper identification. The Immigration Law requires legal
proof of citizenship, so have a passport, Social Security card or
picture driver's licence ready to avoid delays in landing your job.
   Make and keep commitments. If you've agreed to work for the
season, don't leave in the middle of summer. Hanging in for the
duration shows your employer you are businesslike and realize that
a replacement would be costly and difficult for him. Leaving an
employer in the lurch can destroy valuable contacts for future
employment.

   Despite rapid changes in the job market,
Americans can make the most of their career opportunities by
developing ``transferrable'' skills, says the director of career
services at the University of Rochester.
   ``Many people ignore or underestimate their skills,'' says Jim
Case. ``If you ask them what skills they have, they think of what
they've done in the present or past jobs. But while every job
entails skills that are specific to a particular job at a
particular organization, `transferrable' skills are key to a wide
variety of occupations.''
   Among the transferrable skills, he says, are:
   Communication and persuasion, the ability fo write and present
reports to others, or to instruct others;
   Research and investigation, including writing research papers or
reports, conducting surveys, or laboratory experiments;
   Information management, or the organization and retrieval of
data and knowledge;
   Human services, including counseling, social work, teaching,
personnel hiring;
   Organizational management, guiding a group in completing tasks
and attaining goals.

   Teenagers preparing for college and careers have
to make long-term and expensive commitments, yet often lack
information and perspective about the job market, according to
college counselor Charles J. Shields.
   His new book, ``How to Help Your Teenager Find the Right
Career,'' (College Board) aims to help teens and their parents sort
out the possibilities.
   Shields, career and college counselor at Homewood-Flossmoor High
School in suburban Chicago, notes that the teen years are the time
for discovering interests and talents, and that parental support
and guidance has much to do with how successfully youngsters choose
their careers. He advises parents not to press for choices too soon.
   ``As a rule, it's better for parents to respond to announcements
of career plans with the suggestion to explore careers rather than
choose one; then children don't have to worry about losing face
should they decide to overturn their previous plans,'' Shields
writes.
   The book includes list of occupational areas and sources of job
outlook information, along with a self-scoring ``Career Interest
Inventory.''

   The urge to do good in the world still
lives among young university graduates, according to a college
career specialist.
   ``Our top college seniors are looking for experience, the
opportunity to explore, to be involved in something significant,''
says Barbara-Jan Wilson, director of career planning at Wesleyan
University in Middletown.
   The image of egocentric, money-driven college students doesn't
match the reality, Ms. Wilson says. ``The real students that I work
with are struggling very hard to strike a balance in their lives.''
   Ms. Wilson says that when she ran a career option workshop for
two-year financial analysts at an investment brokerage firm last
year, most of the questions centered on how the analysts could get
into teaching or the Peace Corps.
   They want to do something that really matters, yet they want to
be able to pay off their college loans and make enough to send
their own children to college, she says.
   ``At a time when it costs $65,000 to get an education at one of
the top ivy-tinged schools, a student may graduate with more than
$12,000 of debt. It seems impossible for graduates in this
situation to take volunteer positions in Appalachia or the inner
city for $100 a month. Yet they do it all the time.''
   One of the healthiest trends she's found among students is
postponement of career choices until a year or two after graduation.
   ``How can a 21-year-old know he or she wants to be a doctor, a
lawyer, an actor? It is more honest, more difficult and more worthy
of praise to admit, `I have no idea what I want to do for the rest
of my life,' and plunge into counseling battered women in New York
City, teaching English to the Japanese in Kyoto, traveling to the
Himalayas with a sleeping bag, serving in Africa for the Peace
Corps or experiencing the excitement and drama of the world of Wall
Street firsthand.
   ``I predict this generation will not be consumed by the mid-life
career crisis; they are doing their thinking now.''

   Welding _ one of the older skills of civilization _
is also a sure bet for the future.
   Skilled welders are almost an endangered species, and the
shortage of welders and welding engineers means security and
advancement for those who choose this field, according to the
American Welding Society.
   ``Welders are leaving or retiring at an annual rate of nearly 18
percent, with a severely inadequate number of replacements coming
along in our schools today,'' says John M. Gerken, president of the
society. ``Our requirements exceed our actual replacements by
nearly three to one.''
   The society projects the shortage well into the next century,
and that will positively affect salary and advancement. Gerken says
that welders currently earn from $10 to $25 per hour, depending on
their skills and the locations. A welding engineer with a four-year
college degree can expect to start at about $30,000 a year.
   The options for welders is wide, too, Gerken says. Many welders
can become engineers, educators, designers, researchers or managers
as they add to their education and experience.
   Thought to be about 6,000 years old, the welding profession
today covers major and basic industries such as aerospace,
automotive, construction, electronics, metalwork, nuclear power and
shipbuilding. The field's newer technologies include working with
lasers, microjoining, plasmas and robotics.
   Gerken says that the potential welder should have good
mechanical aptitude, mathematical skills, a logical mind,
imagination, and the ability to work as a team member. Education
requirements range from high school vocational courses to college
degree programs.

   One of the best-remembered scenes in the
movie ``The Graduate'' is when the character played by Dustin
Hoffman is urged to ``get into plastics.''
   At Ball State University here, they believe that's still good
advice for off-screen graduates.
   ``There are more job openings (in plastics) than there are
qualified people to fill them,'' says Gerald Steele, director of
the school's Plastic Research Center, ``and the pay is excellent.''
   Steele says starting salaries for recent graduates with
bachelor's degrees in plastics manufacturing technology range from
$25,000 to $30,000 a year.

   Your speaking voice can make or break your chances during a job
interview, says a professional voice consultant.
   ``Your voice is often more important than your words,'' says
William Rush, a Chicago-based voice specialist who advises singers,
salespeople, trial attorneys, floor traders and others whose
livelihoods depend on their voices.
   Hall advises an applicant to speak in a normal voice during an
interview but to rehearse answers to likely questions ahead of
time. The ready answers will convey confidence. The job-seeker also
can boost the odds of landing a job by learning to use his voice to
convey enthusiasm for the position, he says. --_
   It's the individual quality of psychologists and consultants who
work with displaced executives that ranks highest in the
outplacement process, according to one of the country's largest
outplacement firms.
   The firm, Drake Beam Morin, Inc. of New York, surveyed 116
companies which use outplacement services and found that 96 percent
rated the caliber of consultants as the most important factor in
selecting an outplacement service. Program results and content also
are important factors, the survey showed.
   ``The DBM survey shows that no matter how large a service
company becomes, its effectiveness is still measured in the quality
of its individual client contact,'' says William Morin, chairman
and chief executive officer of DBM. --_
   The cost of living in a new area is a big attraction in
recruiting a top prospect, advises one business consulting firm.
   ``A great incentive for taking a job in a less expensive
location is not having to spend as much of your paycheck,'' says
Wallace J. McDonough, executive vice president of Runzheimer
International, a consulting company based in Rochester, Minn.
   Using an average comparison of a $50,000 income for a family of
four, McDonough says that family would need $62,116 to maintain its
standard of living in a high cost area like Boston. But if the
family moved to Baton Rouge, it could live as well at $44,020. A
company should expect to pay more through cost-of-living
adjustments to an employee going from a relatively inexpensive area
to a high cost city, he says.
   Runzheimer lists Boston, Mass.; Bridgeport, Conn.; Honolulu,
Hawaii; and San Diego, Calif., as examples of locations that entail
higher living costs. Low cost areas identified include San Antonio,
Texas; Spokane, Wash.; and Charleston, S.C.

   The ability to adapt to changes brought on by rapidly developing
technology and business conditions is rated by students as one of
the most essential skills for their worklife in the 21st century.
   In a survey conducted by Manpower, Inc., a temporary-help agency
based in Milwaukee, students also identified computer literacy and
communication or ``people'' skills as being vital for their future
job success.
   The survey was taken among student temporaries placed by
Manpower.
   The study also indicated that students believe they should
become generalists with broad educational backgrounds and
experience.
   The students said they will need to be familiar with computers
to manage information and automation. They also say they are
preparing themselves to communicate their technical expertise to
co-workers and managers at all levels. ``The acceleration of
technological change in the office and plant has produced a
plethora a new skills requirements, accompanied by the need for
adequate training,'' says Mitchell S. Fromstein, president and
chief executive officer of Manpower. --_
   Push the job-hunting odds in your favor by making sure your name
appears on one or more recruiting data bases, advises a search firm
that maintains such files.
   Colin A. Hanna of the Cheshire Group, which maintains the Bank
Executives Network data base, says employers are making use of
these computerized resume files to lower recruiting costs.
   He advises both active job-seekers and those who want to be
alerted to opportunities to file their resumes with university
alumni placement offices, search firms, employment agency networks,
government job offices and firms whose primary business is
recruiting data bases. Only the last will charge for putting your
resume into a data base.

   With the job market leaning in the potential employee's favor,
corporations must develop a marketing strategy to compete for the
best candidates, say two college marketing professors.
   Advancement opportunity tops the list of incentives, according
to a survey conducted on campus at Miami University in Oxford,
Ohio, by Dr. Edwin Simpson, associate professor of marketing at
Miami, and at San Diego (Calif.) State University by Dr. Thomas R.
Wotruba, SDSU marketing professor.
   Their study of 209 marketing seniors also indicated that a
company's perceived financial stability and the opportunity for a
new employee to express opinions rank high among reasons students
would accept job offers.
   Other factors listed, in preferential order, were good
communication, job security, the recruiter's interest in the
applicant, low stress, international opportunities, whether the
company entertained the student well, American ownership of the
company, and whether an acquaintance worked there.
   ``There's an overheating of the marketplace going on, and
employers really have to look at it as a selling situation,'' says
Simpson.
   Bonuses or incentives are attractive items to students, he adds,
but emphasis on commissions seem to have a neutral or even negative
effect.

<HEAD>Batus Reports 15 Earnings Gain in 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Batus Inc. announced Monday its earnings
rose 15 percent in 1988 as its Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.
subsidiary enjoyed record high sales.
   Batus, which also has interests in retailing, paper products and
insurance, said it earned $535 million, up from 466.2 million in
1987.
   The company, the U.S. arm of the British firm BAT Industries
PLC, said it had revenue of $6.3 billion, up from $5.83 billion the
year before.
   The company did not announce its per-share earnings.
   In December, Batus achieved its long-term goal of entering the
financial services market by acquiring Farmers Group Inc. for $5.2
billion. However, the insurance company's 1988 income figures were
not incorporated into the Batus income statement, contained in the
company's annual report.
   The report said Brown &amp; Williamson, the third-largest cigarette
manufacturer in the United States, had record sales of $2.8
billion, an 11 percent increase from 1987 with operating income up
6 percent to $651 million.
   The company said the gains represented continued development in
the international and domestic cigarette market.
   Appleton Papers Inc., a leading producer of carbonless paper,
increased sales 8 percent to $844 million while operating income
was $131 million, a gain of almost 4 percent.
   Despite intensified competition and sluggish consumer spending,
Batus' retailing companies _ Saks Fifth Avenue, Marshall Field's,
Ivey's and Breuners _ achieved modest profit gains from 1987, the
company reported. Total retail sales were up 3 percent, to $2.6
billion, with operating income advancing 3 percent to $177 million.
   Sales at Saks Fifth Avenue were particularly strong in the New
York and Florida markets, including the flagship Fifth Avenue
store, the company said. Marshall Field's had a record year,
increasing its market share in Chicago and positioning itself for
additional growth, the Batus statement said.
   The buy-out of the Farmers Group was the latest portion of a
diversification plan Batus initiated in the early 1970s, according
to the annual report. Under that plan, the business has grown from
a single tobacco company to several leading corporations in four
key industries.
   Nearly all of Batus' sales came from tobacco in the early 1970s
but non-tobacco operations accounted for almost 40 percent of the
company's sales by 1980.
   The non-tobacco operations were responsible for 56 percent of
Batus' sales in 1988, the company said, and that figure should grow
still higher when Farmers Group's sales are included in the
company's 1989 report.
   Batus employs 55,000 in the United States.

   The stock market fell in relatively thin volume
today, amid continued worries about inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 17.77 points to
2,364.19 at noon EDT. The blue-chip indicator was 4.21 points lower
an hour earlier.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 11 to 4 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 949 issues down, 342 issues up and
503 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 66.27 million shares.
   Analysts said an increase in hourly earnings last month and a
new agreement between Bethlehem Steel Corp. and the United
Steelworkers helped fuel inflationary fears late last week.
   The Labor Department reported Friday that unemployment rose 0.3
percentage point in April to 5.3 percent, a signal that the
economy's growth is slowing. But the report also showed that hourly
earnings rose 7 cents last month.
   Also Friday, the nation's second largest steelmaker reported it
had reached a pact with the steelworkers union that some economists
said could boost wages and benefits substantially and trigger a
wage hike throughout the industry.
   ``Today's market is driven by what happened with the Bethlehem
contract, although I don't agree that it is as inflationary or as
bad for the company as some think,'' said Dennis Jarrett, technical
analyst with Kidder, Peabody. ``The contract was perceived as a
forerunner of things to come in the industry.''
   Analysts said market participants also were turning their
attention to this week's Treasury bond auction and a report on
producer prices due out on Friday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 1.37 to 170.77.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was down
1.14 to 345.70.
   Among actively traded issues, Bethlehem Steel was off | to 21~;
Service Merchandise was off 1 at 18| and IBM had lost { to 108~.
   Fairchild Industries was up 1{ to 17|, Avon advanced \ to 36]
and Upjohn gained ~ to 31\.
   In over-the-counter trading, Ogilvy Group was up 2 points to
51~. The advertising agency said today it received a higher
takeover offer from British marketing and communications company
WPP Group PLC.

   Representatives from three states and a Canadian
province are forming a task force to prevent or minimize a disaster
in their waters similar to the massive Exxon oil spill in Alaska.
   Officials from Alaska, Washington, Oregon and British Columbia
all have separate regulations and laws governing oil shipments
through their waters, as well as different plans for responding to
oil emergencies.
   Members of the newly formed Oil Spill Task Force say a regional
approach is more effective than each of the four governments
working alone.
   They plan to meet Tuesday to coordinate policies.
   ``We're all speaking in one voice,'' said Carolyn Young of
Oregon's Department of Environmental Quality, a member of the group.
   The group may recommend changing state, provincial and federal
laws to help prevent spills, said Greg Sorlie, program manager for
Washington's Department of Ecology.
   The regional approach has already been effective in putting
pressure on the Exxon Corp. since more than 10 million gallons was
spilled into Prince William Sound on March 24, said Rick Wilson,
director of Planning and Assessment for the British Columbia
Ministry of Environment.
   Combined efforts by the four jurisdictions made it ``remarkably
easy'' to demand that Exxon drain all the oil from the Exxon Valdez
before taking it to Portland, Ore., for repairs, Young said.
   ``The leverage of the four governments when combined is greater
than when each works alone,'' Wilson said.
   Task force members also plan to share information on ways to
recover costs and damages and technology for coping with spills.
One item on the agenda Tuesday is a demonstration of oil removal
equipment by Clean Sound, a cleanup consortium of oil and
transportation companies in Puget Sound.
   Wilson said government and public pressure could be a ``moral
force'' to encourage a better cleanup response.
   ``Exxon is seeing governments and the public saying certain
standards are required,'' he said.
   The first meeting occurred shortly after the spill and involved
only officials from British Columbia and Washington. Alaska and
Oregon were invited to join soon afterward.
   The task force was formed by Washington Gov. Booth Gardner and
British Columbia Premier William Vander Zalm after an oil spill in
December off the central Washington coast.

<HEAD>WPP Raises Bid for Ogilvy to $50 a Share</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Ogilvy Group Inc. today said it received a
revised takeover offer of $50 a share or as much as $800 million
from British marketing and communications company WPP Group PLC.
   The latest offer is $5 a share higher than WPP's initial offer
for Ogilvy, parent of the Ogilvy &amp; Mather advertising agency.
   Kenneth Roman, Ogilvy Group chaiman and chief executive officer,
stated in a brief news release that WPP's proposal would be
considered ``in a proper manner and in due course.''
   The revised WPP proposal would be worth $800 million based on
the purchase of all Ogilvy's outstanding common stock and
equivalents, which total 16 million shares. On this basis, the
previous offer was worth $720 million.
   Wall Street had expected WPP to increase its offer possibly to
as much as $55 a share and Ogilvy stock traded above $50 a share in
national over-the-counter trading late last week.
   In early trading today, Ogilvy shares jumped $2 to $51.87{.
   When WPP Chairman Martin Sorrell made his original offer, he had
said that all terms of the proposal were negotiable, indicating
that he would be willing to pay more for Ogilvy. A merger of WPP
and Ogilvy would create the second largest advertising group in the
world after Britain's Saatchi &amp; Saatchi PLC.
   In 1987, WPP acquired JWT Group Inc. for about $566 million in
the first hostile takeover in the advertising business ever, a deal
that gave WPP a powerful presence in the U.S. market. JWT is the
parent of the New York-based J. Walter Thompson ad agency.

   General Motors Corp. is offering quick oil
changes through a pilot program at about 100 dealerships in four
cities.
   The company said in a written release that it has established
programs at GM dealerships in Birmingham, Ala.; Columbus, Ohio;
Pittsburgh; and San Diego. Each of the dealerships have areas set
aside for the service, and prices are based on other quick oil
change offers in each of the cities.
   GM's test is to end in September.
   Last month, Ford Motor Co. said its pilot quick oil-change
program that it had operated since October was being made available
to dealers nationwide who wanted it.
   John Kerekanich, accessory merchandising manager for Ford's
service and parts division, estimated a dealer would spend no more
than $22,000 to set up a quick oil-change operation.
   Chrysler Corp. spokesman Tom Houston said the automaker surveyed
its dealers a few years ago and found no overwhelming desire for
the corporation to set up such a program.
   Drive-through quick oil-change operations, some owned by oil
company subsidiaries, have been growing during the last five years.
   Many programs claim to offer an oil change and other services in
less than 15 minutes.

   Stock prices opened lower in light trading
today, taking a cue from a weak bond market and Friday's
last-minute sell-off.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 7.33 points at
2,374.63 at 10 a.m. EDT, a half-hour after trading began.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 11 to 5 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 659 issues up, 294 down and 467
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 18.85 million shares.
   Larry Wachtel, vice president for Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., said a combination of Friday's close and a weaker bond market
was pulling the stock market down.
   Stock prices surged early Friday after the government reported
that unemployment rose 0.3 percentage point last month to 5.3
percent. But late in the day, the market pulled back sharply,
partly on concern that inflationary pressures still remain.
   Despite the unemployment number, average hourly earnings
increased seven cents in April.
   Analysts said investors also were awaiting the outcome of this
week's Treasury auction and Friday's inflation numbers, before
making commitments.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 0.58 to 171.56.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was down
0.36 at 346.48.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average, up more than 20
points in early trading, closed with a 2.94 loss at 2,381.96.
   That left the average with a loss of 36.84 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 4 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 795 up, 608 down and 543 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 180.81 million shares, against 153.13

<HEAD>Banner to Acquire Fairchild for $265 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHANTILLY, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Banner Industries Inc. will buy rival
aerospace concern Fairchild Industries Inc. for $265 million cash,
the companies announced Monday.
   The $18-a-share deal from Cleveland-based Banner outbid a
$17-a-share offer from the Carlyle Group, a Washington-based
merchant bank that has been pursuing Fairchild since last year and
has a 15 percent chunk of the company's stock. There was no
immediate comment from Carlyle on the Fairchild-Banner agreement.
   ``This transaction gives Banner a unique opportunity to acquire
a major aerospace company which complements our existing aviation
businesses, but more importantly will enable the companies to
benefit greatly from synergy opportunities,'' said Banner chairman
Jeffrey Steiner in a prepared statement.
   The agreement was negotiated by a special committee of
Fairchild's board of directors appointed to consider the
unsolicited Carlyle offer and any others.
   The Banner offer was accepted by Fairchild at a special board
meeting Sunday. The committee, however, has until Friday to solicit
other offers.
   Under terms of the deal, Banner was given an option to acquire
Fairchild's aerospace fasteners division for $150 million in the
event Fairchild's board accepts a better offer.
   Banner also received an option to acquire 2.2 million
authorized, but unissued, shares of Fairchild stock for $18 per
share in the event the Fairchild board determines to accept a
higher offer.
   Mortimer M. Caplin, chairman of the Fairchild special board
committee, said, ``in the absence of a superior offer, the board
wholeheartedly endorses the agreement and will recommend the
acceptance of the tender offer by Fairchild's stockholders.''
   Banner, with 1988 annual sales of $840 million, distributes and
manufactures aerospace parts, including aircraft tires, avionics
and fasteners.
   Fairchild, with a large fasteners division, also is involved in
space systems, defense electronics, industrial products and
communications services.

   The oil and gas rig count rose this past week by
13 to total 764, Baker Hughes Inc. reported Monday.
   Last week, the number of working oil and gas rigs had fell by 16
to total 751, the company said. A year ago, the count totaled 897.
   Baker Hughes' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively
producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Louisiana was the big loser
this week, with its count dropping by 11.
   Texas, meanwhile, increased by 16. Other states posting gains
included Pennsylvania with four; Colorado, Michigan, North Dakota
and Wyoming, each with two; and Kansas with one.
   Other states showing losses were California with three; Ohio
with two; and New Mexico and Oklahoma each with one.

   ``In relation to our business, we feel that the intensified
interest and preliminary proposal activity, together with our

<HEAD>Adviser Says Smaller Stocks Offer A Bonus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On most lists you might be inclined to choose
from the top. Here's one where you'd have been much better off
choosing from the bottom.
   It's the Fortune 500 list of the largest industrial companies.
   Had you invested in the 15 smallest companies on that list in
the period 1975 through 1988 you'd have increased your investment
more than 14 times. Had you chosen the 15 biggest your return would
have been 8.5 times.
   The test was conducted by Gerald Perritt, former mathematics
professor and now chairman of the Chicago-based Investment
Information Services and publisher or Investment Horizons, a
newsletter.
   For years, even before he became an investment adviser, Perritt
has been perhaps the leading supporter of the thesis that
investments in smaller stocks may contain a premium over the
returns available from their bigger cousins.
   Various explanations have been offered. Well-managed smaller
companies are likely to be entrepreneurial, sometimes even being
run by the founders. Their size alone offers greater potential for
percentage increases.
   But one of Perritt's key findings was that smaller companies
tend to be undervalued because they aren't closely followed by
analysts and do not receive equal publicity.
   However, as they grow and become more visible, that situation
becomes rectified. More brokerage house and other analysts follow
the company, and institutional investments begin, thus changing the
valuation of the shares.
   Continuing his research, Perritt a few years ago matched
investments of stocks at the top and at the bottom of the Fortune
list and found the smaller companies out-returned the giants by
more than two to one.
   With that study now more than three years old he decided to
update his research with a hypothetical portfolio of the 15 largest
and 15 smallest companies on each Fortune list from 1975 through
1988.
   Each year he revised the two portfolios according to changes in
the list, selling those that disappeared and adding the newcomers.
He rebalanced each portfolio so that an equal dollar amount was
committed to each stock.
   Results: Capital and dividends for the 15 smallest totaled 1,338
percent in 14 years; the total return for the 15 largest was 752
percent. Both portfolios beat the 491 percent return of the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index.
   Assume a total investment of $10,000. At the end of 14 years you
would have had $59,100 in the S&amp;P 500 index, $85,200 in the 15
largest companies and $143,800 in the 15 smaller companies.
   Perritt concedes that none of the companies involved was small.
In this test, the median equity of the 15 biggest was $24.5 billion
and that of the smallest $306 million _ a figure that still is
quite large. To Perritt, a small company has less than $90 million
in equity capitalization.
   Nevertheless, the smaller companies in his test did fit the
large versus small thesis. That is, companies at the top of the
list had a large percentage of shares held by institutions and a
small share held by management, while the reverse was true for the
smaller companies at the bottom of the list.
   The implication, he states, is that when you are assembling a
portfolio of large-firm stocks you should select the common stocks
of relatively smaller and less visible companies.
   By concentrating on these companies, he says, large-company
common stock investors will be able to enhance total investment
returns by a significant amount over the long run.

<HEAD>Reports 13 Percent Gain in First Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pharmaceutical maker A.H. Robins Co., in
its fourth year of Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, reported a
13 percent increase in earnings Monday for the first quarter of
1989.
   The Richmond-based company reported earnings of $16.3 million,
or 68 cents per share, for the quarter ending March 31, up from
$14.5 million, or 60 cents per share, for the first quarter of 1988.
   First-quarter revenues totaled $226.9 million vs. $217.7 million
a year earlier, a 4.2 percent increase.
   The 1989 earnings include a write-off of $18.3 million invested
in Robins' subsidiaries in Colombia and Venezuela because of
dividend and import restrictions and exchange controls imposed by
those countries, company spokesman Roscoe E. Puckett Jr. said.
Robins will continue to operate the subsidiaries and will record
their earnings on a cash basis, he said.
   The 1988 earnings included a $30.2 million charge for
anticipated expenses related to the company's proposed Chapter 11
reorganization, under which Robins will be acquired by the New
York-based American Home Products Corp. for $3.2 billion.
   Robins filed for Chapter 11 protection in 1985 in the face of
thousands of injury claims by women who used its Dalkon Shield
birth control device. The merger plan with American Home includes a
$2.5 billion trust fund to settle those claims.
   The reorganization plan was confirmed by a federal judge in July
1988 and is now awaiting a decision by the 4th Circuit Court of
Appeals on a challenge to the plan.

<HEAD>Announces Jet Sale To South Africa Airways</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. confirmed today that South African
Airways has ordered two 747-400 jumbo jets and taken options for
two more.
   The aircraft deal, valued at about $256 million for the two firm
orders, came under heavy criticism last week from several members
of Washington state's congressional delegation.
   Sen. Brock Adams and Rep. Jim McDermott, both Democrats,
objected to Boeing selling the planes because of South Africa's
policy of racial segregation.
   Boeing, however, said its policy is to sell aircraft, unless
prohibited from doing so by U.S. law.
   ``The company is in business to sell airplanes to airlines all
around the world so long as they are in countries the U.S.
government permits commercial sales in,'' company spokesman Dick
Schleh said.
   The two jets ordered are to be delivered in November 1990 and
May 1991, while the optioned jets would be delivered in 1992.
   South Africa Airways has chosen Rolls-Royce engines for the
planes.
   In South Africa's configuration, the planes would be capable of
carrying 385 passengers in three classes 8,350 miles nonstop.
   Boeing now has received 206 orders from 22 carriers for
747-400s, the world's largest passenger jet. Orders for all
versions of the 747 total 924 from 74 customers.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Prices Slip Amid Rain Forecasts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were trading
mostly lower this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting
forecasts for rain in the Midwest and Great Plains.
   Strong thunderstorms were expected in the central United States
with showers moving east into the Corn Belt.
   A National Weather Service six-to-10-day forecast issued on
Friday called for more rain early next week in the Midwest.
   The early losses were limited by reports of frost damage to corn
plants over the weekend, and by the Agriculture Department's
announcement after the close of trading on Friday that the Soviet
Union had purchased 200,000 metric tons of U.S. corn and 300,000
metric tons of U.S. wheat.
   The frost damage occurred in the upper Midwest, where corn has
just begun to sprout.
   ``I don't know if it killed it completely, but it definitely
stunted its growth,'' said Jerry Gidel, director of research for
LIT America Inc. in Chicago.
   In early trading, wheat was 1} cents to 3{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.35 a bushel; corn was unchanged
to 1{ cents lower with May at $2.80{ a bushel; oats were } cent to
2\ cents lower with May at $1.95{ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to
2{ cents lower with May at $7.58 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .13 cent higher with June at 72.55
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .23 cent higher
with May at 77.20 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent lower to
.28 cent higher with June at 47.55 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .38 cent to .65 cent higher with May at 31.55 cents a
pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on Friday.

<HEAD>Senate Investigators Say Some Oil Firms Cheat Indians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate investigators say some oil firms have
cheated Indians and the Interior Department out of millions of
dollars of oil and oil royalties.
   Investigators worked for six months to obtain evidence extending
back almost 10 years, said Sens. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and
John McCain, R-Ariz.
   They said the names of the companies would be revealed at
hearings, beginning Tuesday, by the special investigative unit of
the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs, which DeConcini
heads.
   The senators said that the oil companies under investigation
aren't among the top seven corporations. They are independent,
multimillion-dollar ``middle-level'' companies, the senators added.
   Earl Ross, spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, said
none of the companies involved are members of his organization, the
largest oil trade association in the country. He said the institute
supplied the committee with technical information on how to measure
oil.
   DeConcini said committee's staff examined 700,000 pages of
subpoenaed documents. He said undercover investigators went into
the oil fields and saw theft taking place.
   McCain said millions of dollars in royalities are not going to
the rightful people. He and Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., are the other
two members of the special investigative committee.
   ``To a poor native American, being deprived of only a few
dollars is significant,'' McCain said.
   DeConcini said some of the committee's findings will be turned
over the Justice Department.
   Ken Ballen, chief counsel for the committee, said two issues are
involved _ one is actual theft of oil from wells, the other is
underpayment of royalties.
   ``It's a sophisticated kind of theft,'' said Ballen. He said
that companies ``mismeasure'' the amount of oil they take and are
able to get away with it because the areas are so remote that
nobody is watching.
   DeConcini said investigators hid behind bushes to observe the
theft taking place.
   McCain said the goal of the committee is to determine how well
the federal government is fufilling its responsibility to the
Indians.
   ``Our job is to review policies, programs and management so we
can recommend changes so problems won't happen again,'' he said.
   In February, the special committee held three weeks of hearings
focusing on contracting fraud, child abuse and organized crime on
Indian reservations and among those doing business with them.
   The senators said that they will spend this week on oil
companies and next week on problems within the Indian Health
Service.
   Both senators said the hearings on the health service would
reveal ``gross mismanagement.''
   DeConcini called the federal agency's approach to Indian health
care a ``tragedy of all tragedies.''
   He said the standard at the health service was ``less than the
norm for the nation.''
   DeConcini said he expected to have a report on all of the
committee's findings by October.

<HEAD>Shearson Acting as Financial Adviser to Potential Eastern Bidder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investment firm Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said
it is acting as financial adviser to a Chicago futures trader who
may make a bid for strike-torn Eastern Airlines.
   Joseph Ritchie, the chairman of CRT Group, reportedly plans a
bid for Eastern and is being advised in the matter by former
defense secretary Frank Carlucci. Carlucci is a vice chairman of
Carlyle Group, an investment company based in Washington, and
sources say the federal bankruptcy court almost tapped him in
mid-April as a special interim trustee to run the airline.
   Shearson ``is acting as financial adviser to Joseph Ritchie in
connection with a potential bid for Eastern Airlines,'' Shearson
spokesman Michael O'Neill said Monday.
   O'Neill refuted a report in Monday's Wall Street Journal,
however, that Shearson is providing financing to Ritchie for the
bid.
   Ritchie didn't return calls to his Chicago office.
   CRT is one of the most active commodity options and futures
trading companies, with $250 million in capital, according to the
Journal. The company itself is not participating in Ritchie's
potential bid, the newspaper said.
   The Journal quoted an unidentified attorney for Ritchie as
saying details of financing for the bid and the nature of the
Eastern unions' participation were still being worked out. It said
Ritchie would have an as-yet undetermined portion of his own money
invested in Eastern under the deal.
   Miami-based Eastern has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
from creditors since March 9, five days after the start of a strike.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland has set Wednesday as a
deadline for all interested bidders to submit their offers for
Eastern or its Northeast shuttle service to the court, which must
approve any sales.
   Besides Ritchie, other potential bidders include takeover
strategist Carl C. Icahn, billionaire hotel mogul Jay Pritzker and
a group led by former airline executive William Howard and
investment firm Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Developer Donald Trump has agreed to buy the profitable shuttle
service for $365 million, but the deal still awaits approval by the
bankruptcy court. America West Airlines, an aggressive regional
carrier, last week offered $726 million for the shuttle routes and
landing slots, along with 10 Boeing 757 jetliners.
   Eastern management insists that the airline is not for sale and
is proceeding with its recently announced plan to rebuild as a
smaller carrier and raise $1.8 billion by selling aircraft and
other assets.

   Ocean Beauty Inc., a Seattle-based seafood

   Officials said the merged company, to be called Ocean Pride-Salt

   The company will be located in Salt Lake City at the present
Booth Fisheries plant, serving grocers, restaurants and food
distributors.
   Sales for Booth and Idaho Fish have increased rapidly, and ``the
merger gives us the financial and marketing strength that will
ensure that kind of growth,'' said Jack Whitney, former general
manager of Idaho Fish and general manager of the newly merged
fishery.
   Ocean Beauty has production facilities in Oregon, Washington and
Alaska and distribution outlets in seven western states.
   Booth Fisheries was established in Salt Lake in 1901 and was a

   Exxon must put more crews to work if it
hopes to meet its September deadline to clean up shores fouled by
the nation's largest oil spill, a top Coast Guard officer testified
today.
   Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins told a five-member U.S. House Interior
subcommittee investigating the spill and its cleanup that ``it
appears they need to expand their resources in order to meet the
fall completion.''
   He described the spill as ``one of the worst economic and
environmental calamities this nation has faced.''
   Robbins is directly responsible for coordinating the cleanup,
reporting to Coast Guard Commandant Paul A. Yost Jr., President
Bush's emissary to the spill site.
   On Monday, the state's top environmental official testified that
Exxon stalled in its response to the spill and gave bad
information. The panel also heard from fishermen who said they fear
their multimillion-dollar catch in Prince William Sound will be
reduced this season because of the spill.
   ``We've been told, we've been emphatically told, that we're
going to have a normal fishery this summer. We're going to have
anything but a normal fishery,'' Ken Adams of the Cordova District
Fishermen United said Sunday.
   Adams said the state could put a large portion of the sound
off-limits when the commercial salmon season begins May 15. The
state has not yet set any limits while it monitors the spill's
movements.
   At an estimated $84 million, Prince William Sound has the
nation's eighth-largest commercial fishing industry, Adams said.
About 85 percent of the catch is salmon.
   Riki Ott, a member of the Cordova group's board of directors,
said the fishing industry has long been fearful of a spill. Cordova
is a fishing town on the edge of the sound, about 50 miles from
Valdez, which is the terminal for the trans-Alaska pipeline.
   ``We knew we were playing with Russian roulette,'' she said.
   Dennis Kelso, commissioner of the state Department of
Environmental Conservation, questioned Exxon's statements that it
could have more effectively contained the spill had it been allowed
to use chemical dispersants.
   Kelso said neither Exxon nor Alyeska, the oil industry's jointly
owned operator of the pipeline, was prepared to deal with the oil
spill.
   ``Neither of them had the equipment on site to deal with it
either through mechanical means or chemical means,'' he said.
   He also said Exxon's response was ``reluctant and myopic,
characterized by stalling techniques, disinformation, and a refusal
to pay real attention to damage outside of Prince William Sound.''
   The subcommittee today was to conclude two days of hearings
investigating the nation's largest oil spill. Today's session was
expected to include testimony from Exxon, which has defended its
actions.
   Alyeska's vice president for operations, Theo L. Polasek, said
the industry's response plans were sufficient to deal with a spill,
but that there was confusion after the tanker ran aground.
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., told Polasek that ``I'm not so
sure this (the cleanup) was a high priority for you people.''
   The tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on a reef in the sound on
March 24 after filling its storage tanks with crude oil from the
pipeline. More than 10 million gallons of oil poured into the sound.
   Also Sunday, state officials said Exxon's decision to pull crews
from an oil-stained beach on Smith Island was surprising.
   But Exxon spokesman Bill Stillings said the crews were moved off
the northern beach to attack more heavily soiled areas. The island
is considered crucial to the annual seal pupping cycle.
   ``I think we fully intend to come back to that beach. I won't
tell you we'll be back on that beach tomorrow,'' Stillings said.
``(Exxon's) best judgment at this point is that it's time to move
on.''
   Two days earlier, Yost said the beach was far from clean.
   Exxon, in a plan that has yet to win Yost's approval, has called
for the worst of the oil to be cleaned off five islands in the
sound by Wednesday, with 364 miles to be cleansed by Sept. 15.

   Borden Inc., the world's largest dairy
company, said it pulled its products from the shelves in two
Southern states today after finding milk with traces of a toxic
substance from contaminated feed.
   Chris Tilton, a Borden spokeswoman in Columbus, Ohio, said it
isn't known if any of the contaminated products had been purchased,
but a state health official said the substance is present in
amounts too small to be dangerous.
   Borden pulled milk, ice cream and other liquid dairy items from
stores in Mississippi and the northern two-thirds of Louisiana,
where 32 dairies that apparently used feed tainted with barium
carbonate supplied milk, she said.
   It was not immediately known if the dairies supplied other milk
processors.
   Barium carbonate is a white powder used as rat poison and in
glass, ceramics, paint, rubber and electronics, said Michael
Hughes, managing director of the poison control center at the
University of Mississippi Medical Center.
   ``We've done our own testing and the state of Louisiana labs
also tested, with some of the milk testing positive in trace
amounts,'' Tilton said. ``We would not want any of our products
going out with any level of this in it, no matter how small.''
   ``The amount you can drink is far less than the amount that
would be dangerous,'' said Dr. Ed Thompson, a state Health
Department epidemiologist. A person would have to drink more than
100 8-ounce glasses of the milk in succession for it to be fatal,
Thompson said.
   Tilton said Borden discovered the contamination after learning
from Louisiana that some cattle had died or become ill.
   Louisiana Agriculture Commissioner Bob Odom said investigators
believe the feed became contaminated when it was put in a railroad
hopper that had held barium carbonate.
   Tilton said it was not immediately known how many items were
pulled and how many stores were involved. She said the company was
checking to see when the tainted products were put on shelves.
   ``We will be supplying those markets later today with products
shipped from plants outside the area until the local milk supply is
clean,'' Tilton said.
   The government allowable standard for barium carbonate in water
is one part per million, Tilton said, and ``we have found nothing
close to that, just percentages of one part per million.''
   Odom said today he had not been informed of the recall but that
state officials last week learned that 25 to 30 cows had died
mysteriously at Louisiana dairy farms. Officials ordered companies
that received milk from those dairies to hold milk from
distribution until samples could be tested.
   ``The information we got was that the milk had been bottled, but
it had not reached the shelf,'' said Odom. He said he didn't know
how many farms were affected or how many distributors might have
had to hold on to their milk.

   The U.S. dollar gave a mixed performance Monday as
cautious European traders stepped to the sidelines amid speculation
about the possibility of central bank intervention. Gold prices
rose.
   Dealers said the dollar moved within a narrow range in calm
trading. The dollar remained well supported by expectations that
U.S. interest rates will not decline, they said.
   In Frankfurt, dealers said some participants were fearful of
dollar-selling by the West German central bank as the dollar edged
up toward a critical level of 1.9000 marks. But there was no sign
of intervention by the Bundesbank or other European central banks.
   Earlier, in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan sold an estimated $100
million for Japanese yen in an apparently unsuccessful bid to
depress the dollar.
   The dollar closed at 134.52 yen, up 0.67 yen from last Tuesday.
Japanese financial markets were closed the rest of the week for
holidays. In London late Monday, the dollar remained at 134.52 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Friday included: 1.8975 West German marks, down from 1.8988; 1.6945
Swiss francs, down from 1.6985; 6.4025 French francs, down from
6.4080; 2.1400 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1285; 1,385.00 Italian

policy.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. Monday announced
the retirement of John J. Creedon, president and chief executive
officer and a 47-year veteran of the company.
   Creedon will step down on Sept. 1 after holding the position
since it was created in 1983. Met Life has a mandatory retirement
policy for certain high-level executives once they reach 65.
   His successor will be Met Life Chairman Robert G. Schwartz, who
will assume the additional responsibilities of president and CEO.
   Creedon will continue as a director and chairman of the
executive and dividend policy committee of Met Life, one of the
nation's largest insurance and financial services companies.
   While Creedon has been president and CEO, Met Life has expanded
its insurance services and diversified into other fields, including
financial services. It extended its geographical presence, opening
offices in European and Far Eastern countries, and acquired new
businesses, such as Century 21, a large real estate sales operation.
   In his role as chairman of the board, Schwartz has directed all
of Met Life's investment activities and pensions operations. He
started his career at Met Life in 1947.
   ``We plan to continue on the course that has been charted,''
Schwartz said in a company announcement.

   The stock market was lower in dull afternoon
trading, as investors drifted to the sidelines to await more news
on the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 11.73 points to
2,370.23 at 3 p.m. EDT. The blue-chip indicator was 15.39 points
lower an hour earlier.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 7 to 3 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 995 issues up, 428 down and 495
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 111.53 million shares.
   Analysts said bearish forecasts about the economy, including
growing talk of a recession, sent jitters through the market and
investors to the sidelines.
   The market's nervousness follows Friday's government report that
hourly earnings rose in April despite an increase in unemployment.
   The Labor Department reported that unemployment rose 0.3
percentage point in April to 5.3 percent, a signal that the
economy's growth is slowing. But the report also showed that hourly
earnings rose 7 cents.
   Analysts said many institutional investors took to the sidelines
to await the outcome of this week's three-day Treasury auction,
which starts Tuesday, as well as Thursday's figures on retail sales
and Friday's producer price numbers.
   Softer bond prices ahead of the auction were helping to weaken
stocks, traders said.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 1.16 to 170.98.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was off
1.52 to 345.32.

   Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed
mostly lower Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid rain
forecasts, but soybean oil futures surged on rumors of an impending
sale to the Soviet Union at subsidized prices.
   ``They want up to half a million (metric) tons but we don't
think the offer will be anything like that. They might get 100,000
tons,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a grain trader with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Soybean oil for spot delivery closed 42 cents higher at $23.81
per hundredweight.
   Soybeans for spot delivery were boosted by signs of active
farmer selling and other indications of tight nearby supplies. But
forecasts for rain in the Corn Belt on Monday night, Tuesday and
early next week kept pressure on most corn and soybean contracts.
   Wheat futures were narrowly mixed in cautious trading ahead of
Thursday's Agriculture Department estimate of the 1988-89 winter
wheat crop.
   At the close of trading, wheat was 1 cent lower to 1{ cents
higher with the contract for delivery in May at $4.38{ a bushel;
corn was unchanged to 1{ cents lower with May at $2.80{ a bushel;

<HEAD>Automakers' Move To High Tech Cited As Role Model</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The challenge from imports that hustled Detroit
automakers into a high-technology age should be taken seriously by
other businesses, U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said
Monday.
   The government can help by pushing to end some other countries'
restrictions on imports from the United States, Mosbacher told a
news conference before a meeting of the Economic Club of Detroit.
   He said cutting capital gains taxes and continuing tax credits
for research and development spending would give businesses more
financial and technological resources to compete.
   ``There's no panacea. We've got to realize that it's a shrinking
world and if we want to do more than flip the hamburgers for the
world we've got to come out with quality products,'' Mosbacher said.
   The auto industry and others, including aerospace,
telecommunications, biotechnology and medical products, have met
challenges from imports and improved, Mosbacher said.
   ``They woke up. They did a very good job of adapting,''
Mosbacher said.
   To help others, he said, the government is preparing to enforce
laws to penalize countries that restrict imports from the United
States.
   ``We are in the throes of deciding which countries to cite,''
Mosbacher said. He said those decisions will be made by the end of
May.
   The object is not to hurt any other country but to press for
removal of trade barriers, he said. ``The whole point is to open
other markets and level the playing field.''
   Mosbacher advocated capital gains tax cuts as a means of
reducing the cost of capital for business.
   More readily available capital would create jobs and stimulate
long-term projects by businesses, Mosbacher said.
   Mosbacher also proposed making permanent a tax credit for
research and development spending.
   Reitering comments he made in Washington recently, Mosbacher
said antitrust law changes should be considered to allow innovative
pooling of research teams from small and large companies to take on
European and Japanese competitors.
   Mosbacher said he expected economic growth to slow for the
remainder of the year but still show some increases. ``I feel very
confident about less inflation problems and continuing growth in
the economy,'' he said.

   The stock market declined today in fairly quiet
trading, pressured by growing talk of a recession amid ongoing
concern about inflation.
   The market opened lower on a carryover from Friday's last-minute
sell-off and in response to a weaker bond market ahead of this
week's three-day treasury borrowing.
   Prices drifted lower during the session as many big players
withdrew to the sidelines to await fresh news on the economy.
Traders said airline stocks were among the most active on the sell
list as investors took profits.
   Last Friday's employment figures touched off dual concerns about
inflation and a recession, analysts said.
   The Labor Department reported that unemployment rose 0.3
percentage point in April to 5.3 percent, a signal that the
economy's growth is slowing. But the report also showed that hourly
earnings rose 7 cents.
   Analysts said growing talk of a recession was producing jitters
in the marketplace and raising concern about future corporate
profits.
   ``The mention of a recession worries investors,'' said Philip
Puccio, senior vice president with Dillon, Read &amp; Co.
   Among other indicators of the economy's health, investors were
focusing on this week's three-day Treasury auction.
   ``The market is really going to turn on the auctions
themselves,'' said Larry Wachtel, vice president of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Also diverting the market's attention are upcoming figures on
retail sales and producer prices, due out Thursday and Friday
respectively.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northrop Corp. Chairman Thomas V. Jones was
formally reprimanded for ``his management style'' in attempting to
sell F-20 jet fighters to South Korea, the aerospace company said
in proxy material.
   Northrop's executive committee and outside directors issued the
reprimand, divulged in proxy material dated April 24. Jones
announced earlier he would retire as chief executive officer by
Dec. 31.
   A House subcommittee and a federal grand jury have been
investigating $7.8 million in payments made by Northrop from 1984
to 1986 in connection with attempts to sell the F-20. Northrop
never found a buyer for the plane.
   Jones has been subpoenaed to testify before the subcommittee.
   ``The executive committee of the board of directors is
continuing its own investigation into these matters,'' the proxy
statement said.
   The board didn't elaborate on what it meant by Jones' management
style.
   ``In addition, the executive committee together with the other
outside directors reprimanded Mr. Jones regarding his management
style in connection with Northrop's efforts to sell the F-20 to the
government of South Korea,'' it said.
   Tony Cantafio, spokesman for the aerospace giant, said he
couldn't expand beyond the proxy statement. Jones was traveling and
unavailable for comment, the spokesman said.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Drop On Reports Of Overproduction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reports of overproduction by OPEC member nations
Monday knocked oil futures prices to their lowest levels in nearly
two months.
   The contract for June delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 58 cents to $19.44 a barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   That was the lowest close for a near-month contract since March
14, when the contract for April delivery settled at $19.29 a barrel.
   Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
boosted their production last month to 20.9 million barrels a day,
the authoritative Petroleum Intelligence Weekly reported Monday.
   OPEC's self-imposed quota is 18.5 million barrels a day.
   The oil futures market was hit by the overproduction report and
by technicians who concluded from price charts that the market was
in a downtrend, said Mary Haskins of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Traders who bought contracts in hopes of a price rise sold them,
while others sold borrowed contracts in the expectation of a fresh
decline, she said.
   The selling in the crude market spread to the market for refined
products.
   The June contract for unleaded gasoline dropped 2.52 cents to
64.98 cents a gallon, a decline of close to 4 percent, even steeper
than the less than 3 percent drop in crude oil.
   Heavy selling of unleaded gasoline futures had taken hold
Friday, when the June contract had fallen 2.12 cents. Ms. Haskins
said technical traders led the charge. ``The bloom is off the rose
for gasoline,'' she said.
   The contract for No.2 heating oil fell .68 cent to 46.69 cents a
gallon.
   The downward moves of Friday and Monday were a sharp reversal
from the previous two sessions, when prices surged after an
announcement that repairs on a North Sea oil platform would take
longer than expected.
   Brent crude production in the North Sea may be disrupted until
the end of May, officials said last week.

   Eskimo Pie Corp., responding to concerns
about saturated fat and cholesterol in food, will market a new
version of its famous ice-cream bar devoid of tropical oils.
   Light Eskimo Pie, to be officially introduced next week, has
less saturated fat and cholesterol and 40 fewer calories than its
180-calorie regular Eskimo Pie, the company said Monday.
   The new bar uses safflower and cottonseed oils to replace the
butterfat in the ice cream and the coconut and palm oils in the
chocolate covering.
   The Richmond-based company already produces a sugar-free version
of the product.
   Saturated fats found in tropical oils such as palm and coconut
oil have been identified as a cause of high blood cholesterol
levels, a contributor to the risk of heart attacks.
   Food companies including Nabisco Brands Inc., General Mills
Inc., Pillsbury Co., Quaker Oats Co. and Kellogg Co., have said
they will drop tropical oils from some products.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose broadly in brisk U.S. trading
Monday as Federal Reserve intervention proved ineffective in
deterring buyers.
   Gold prices fell in the United States, reversing course after
rising modestly overseas. Republic National Bank of New York quoted
a troy ounce of gold bullion at $375.40 as of 4 p.m. EDT, $1.60
lower than Friday's late bid.
   ``The market is beginning to believe now that the major central
banks are not committed to holding the dollar at current levels,''
said Jon Lopatin, a vice president in Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.'s
foreign-exchange department.
   This conviction was at least partly responsible for driving the
dollar to its highest level in months against the West German mark.
   In U.S. trading, the dollar ended at 1.9097 marks, up from
1.8977 Friday, and piercing what was described as an important
technical threshold of 1.90 marks. It was the highest closing level
since August 1988.
   A variety of factors fed the dollar's advance. Key catalysts
were comments by the president of West Germany's central bank and
the fact that the dollar remained above levels identified as
significant from a technical standpoint, despite Fed intervention.
   Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl indicated the dollar's
value against other major currencies is a matter being decided by
the markets and countries would have to live with the decision.
   Speaking in Basel, Switzerland, after a regular meeting of the
Group of Ten central bankers, he said the dollar's strength is
remarkable given the trade imbalances among leading industrialized
countries.
   Foreign-exchange dealers interpreted his remarks to imply that
government monetary authorities are unlikely to act aggressively to
influence the dollar.
   Dealers in the United States reported the Fed sold dollars for
marks and Japanese yen when the U.S. currency was trading at 1.9080
marks and 134.75 yen. But the intervention had no discernible
impact and the dollar continued to rise.
   Earlier, on foreign-exchange markets in Europe and Asia, the
dollar had a mixed showing.
   Dealers in Frankfurt, West Germany, said some participants were
anticipating dollar-selling by the Bundesbank as the dollar
approached 1.9000 marks. But there was no sign of intervention by
the Bundesbank or other European central banks.
   In Tokyo, the Bank of Japan sold an estimated $100 million for
Japanese yen. The dollar closed at 134.52 yen, up 0.67 yen from
last Tuesday. Japanese financial markets were closed the rest of
the week for holidays.
   Later, in London, the dollar remained at 134.52 yen. In New
York, the dollar rose to 134.89 yen from 134.25 Friday.
   The British pound fell to $1.6710 in London from $1.6740 late
Friday. In New York, sterling fetched $1.6646 compared with $1.6755
on Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with rates late
Friday, included: 1.7025 Swiss francs, up from 1.6963; 6.4405
French francs, up from 6.4020; 1,392.75 Italian lire, up from
1,384.63; and, 1.1846 Canadian dollars up from 1.1842.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Friday
included: 1.8975 West German marks, down from 1.8988; 1.6945 Swiss
francs, down from 1.6985; 6.4025 French francs, down from 6.4080;
2.1400 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1285; 1,385.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,379.00; and, 1.1850 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1842.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
settled at $376.90 a troy ounce, down from $377.70 Friday.
   Gold bullion rose in London to a late bid price of $377.50 a
troy ounce, up from $376.25 bid late Friday. In Zurich,
Switzerland, the metal rose to $377.75, up from $375.85 bid late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 48 cents to close at a bid
$378.41.
   Silver bullion for current delivery closed on New York's Comex
at $5.588 a troy ounce, down from Friday's settlement of $5.598.
Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid price of $5.64 a troy
ounce, up from $5.60 late Friday.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Slide On Sharp Rise In Stocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices tumbled Monday on New York's Commodity
Exchange following an unexpectedly large increase in warehouse
stocks of copper reported by the London Metal Exchange.
   On other markets, palladium surged while gold and silver prices
slipped; energy futures plummeted; grains and soybeans were mostly
lower; cattle futures dipped, and pork prices advanced.
   Copper settled 2.7 cents to 5.2 cents lower with the spot
contract for delivery in May at $1.259 a pound and the most active
contract, for July delivery, at $1.216 a pound.
   It was the second straight declining day for copper, a market
that reached a record high of $1.6475 a pound last December on
tight supplies and strong demand.
   Analysts attributed the sell-off mainly to the London Metal
Exchange's weekly report, which showed a 17,175-ton net increase in
warehouse stocks tracked by the exchange, to 131,275 tons.
   ``It was a very large increase and very unexpected,'' said Bette
Raptopoulos, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in
New York. ``They were expecting about 4,000 or 5,000 tons.''
   Experts cited increased copper exports from Zambia and an
unusually small amount of drawdown of stocks in Singapore. But it
was not clear whether the rise in overall stocks signaled a
significant change in market fundamentals.
   The possibility of a miners' strike in Poland kept the market
from falling further, as did expectations of labor unrest as
contracts with some of the major North American copper companies
approach expiration at the end of June.
   ``By the end of May, I think we'll begin to see anticipatory
buying and enhanced demand for copper,'' said analyst George
Anagnos of Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York.
   Palladium futures rallied on renewed supply fears, while gold
and silver slipped in dull trading.
   Palladium settled $4.35 to $4.85 higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange with May at $163 a troy ounce. On the Commodity
Exchange, gold was 60 cents to 90 cents lower with June at $378.40
a troy ounce; silver was 1 cent lower across the board with July at
$5.677 a troy ounce.
   Unleaded gasoline futures plummeted the permitted
2-cents-a-gallon daily limit on the New York Merc as the energy
market extended a steep decline begun on Friday.
   The sell-off was linked to reports last week of overproduction
by OPEC members and was fueled Monday by technical signals that the
market was due for a downward correction.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 15 cents to 58 cents
lower with June at $19.44 a barrel; heating oil was .68 cent to .79
cent lower with June at 46.69 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
1.96 cents to 2.52 cents lower with the nearby June contract, to
which the daily limit does not apply, at 64.98 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower on the Chicago
Board of Trade amid rain forecasts, but soybean oil prices surged
on rumors of an impending sale of U.S. soybean oil to the Soviet
Union at subsidized prices.
   Soybean oil for spot delivery settled 39 cents higher at $23.78
per hundredweight and traded as high as $23.90 during the session.
   Wheat settled 1 cent lower to { cent higher with May at $4.36 a
bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2} cents lower with May at $2.79{ a
bushel; oats were 4\ cents to 6 cents lower with May at $1.92{ a
bushel; soybeans were 12} cents lower to 5 cents higher with May at
$7.64{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures prices sank on ideas that demand for beef would
slacken after Memorial Day. Pork futures advanced on expectations
of a slowdown in hog marketings as producers increasingly turn
their attention to fieldwork.
   Live cattle settled .10 cent to .30 cent lower with June at
72.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .25 cent lower
with May at 76.77 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent lower to
.55 cent higher with June at 47.82 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .20 cent to 1.07 cents higher with May at 32.02 cents
a pound.

the economy is going to do.''
   The government is scheduled to report on retail sales and
producer prices later this week.
   Analysts said the market is concerned that producer prices could
show that inflation is still a problem, which could lead to further
credit tightening.
   On Friday the government reported unemployment rose 0.3
percentage point to 5.3 percent in April, providing further
evidence of slower economic growth. But the report also showed that
hourly earnings rose seven cents during the month.
   Despite inflationary fears, analysts said talk of a slower
economy has raised concerns about a recession.
   ``People are beginning to wonder how much of a slowdown we'll
have,'' Jensen said.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Avon Products Inc. filed a federal lawsuit Monday seeking a
court order preventing a partnership of Amway Corp. and Minneapolis
investor Irwin Jacobs from acquiring more Avon stock.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in New York, accused
Amway and Jacobs of violating disclosure requirements of federal
securities laws in their acquisition of Avon stock, Avon said in a
statement.
   The suit asked that Amway and Jacobs be ordered to sell the Avon
stock they already have purchased, the New York-based cosmetics and
household products company said.
   ``We're not familiar with it,'' Amway spokeswoman Kim Bruyn said
Monday afternoon. ``We haven't seen it, and therefore we have no
comment.''
   Earlier Monday, Amway co-founder Jay Van Andel said the Ada,
Mich.-based company had nt decided whether to pursue acquisition of
Avon, its larger rival in the direct selling business.
   Amway, a large direct seller of personal and home products, has
purchased more than 10 percent of Avon common stock in the past
month in partnership with Jacobs, a well-known takeover strategist.
   Van Andel told the Grand Rapids, Mich., Economic Club that a
takeover would have to benefit both companies.
   He compared Amway's position to that of a diver who walks out on
the diving board ``and has to decide whether to make a swan dive
... or a belly flop. We haven't made that decision yet. We're still
on the board looking around.
   ``If we were to decide to make the plunge ... the plunge would
have to be good for Amway as a company and Avon as a company,'' Van
Andel said.
   The statement released by Avon described Amway as ``a
controversial purveyor of a pyramidal direct marketing scheme that
has never made a major acquisition.''
   It also described Jacobs as ``a well-known raider who has not
completed an acquisition for many years or any acquisition for
significantly more than $500 million.''
   Amway, owned by Van Andel and partner Richard DeVos, claims 1
million distributors worldwide. Avon says it has 1.475 million
independent sales representatives.
   Avon reported 1988 revenue of $3.06 billion but lost $404.5
million due to losses from discontinued operations. The company has
been divesting unprofitable businesses in the health care services
field and concentrating on its direct selling and beauty products
operations.
   James E. Preston, Avon's chairman, has said the company is not
for sale and that shareholders stand to do better if Avon remains
independent.

   The sale to a group formed by Salomon Brothers Holding Co. Inc.

   The sale is part of the company's restructuring program, which
it adopted last year to foil a hostile takeover attempt from the
Rales brothers, a pair of Washington investors.
   In December, the company sold Londontown Corp., the manufacturer
of London Fog rainwear for $178 million.
   The company has said it would retain its Converse and Florsheim

<TEXT>
   Quaker Oats Co. said Monday it will repurchase up
to 7 million shares of its outstanding common stock in a bid to
increase the value of remaining shares.
   The company said the repurchase of 2 million of those shares
would be used to offset a new issue of up to $125 million of
convertible preferred stock for the company's employee stock
ownership plan.
   Quaker said in a news release that at least part of the share
repurchase would be financed with an unspecified amount of borrowed
money.
   ``We believe increased leverage will lower our cost of capital
and create more value for our shareholders,'' said William D.
Smithburg, chairman and chief executive officer. ``We feel
comfortable increasing our debt over time, given the stong
performance of our core businesses.''
   The company's stock price rose 12{ cents to $56.62{ a share
Monday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Based on that
price, the cost of Quaker's share-repurchase plan could exceed $395
million.
   The stock program will be accomplished through open-market
purchases and privately negotiated transactions, the company said.
   Quaker, an international processor and marketer of food, pet
food and toys, had about 79.5 million common shares outstanding as
of March 31.
   Spokesman Ronald Bottrell said Quaker had about $424 million in
long-term debt and $450 million in short-term debt at the end of
March.
   The additional borrowing for the stock buy-back will increase
Quaker's debt load to a little more than 50 percent of its total
capitalization, up from the current 42 percent, Bottrell said.
   Quaker, like many food, tobacco and beverage companies, is a
``cash cow,'' generating relatively large amounts of cash and
having highly predictable earnings, said John Maxwell Jr, an
analyst with Wheat First Securities Inc. in Richmond, Va.
   ``You can put more debt load on these companies than those in
highly volatile situations,'' such as airline and high-technology
firms, he said.
   The greater debt load and the expanded employee stock ownership
plan could make Quaker less attractive as a takeover target,
analysts said. Takeover rumors sent Quaker's stock price up sharply
last August.
   Quaker said it would complete a previously announced
2-million-share repurchase program, probably by the end of June,
before beginning the new repurchase plan.
   Quaker said it hopes to complete the new repurchase program by
June 30, 1990, the end of its 1990 fiscal year.
   In addition to its Quaker Oats products, Quaker owns the
Gatorade and Aunt Jemima food brands and toymaker Fisher-Price.

<TEXT>
   J. Bruce Johnston will leave as head of labor
relations at USX Corp. this month, two years after he lost the last
big piece of his former domain as one of the most powerful labor
negotiators in the steel industry.
   Johnston, 58, will join the Pittsburgh law firm of Alder, Cohen
&amp; Grigsby to advise clients on labor matters, while continuing as a
consultant to the Pittsburgh-based oil and steel giant USX, the
company said Monday.
   Johnston was chairman of the committee that negotiated labor
contracts for the nation's largest steelmaking companies until
coordinated bargaining dissolved in 1985 amid the industry's
financial crisis.
   As committee chairman, he was the lead negotiator for the
industry during the 1977, 1980 and 1983 talks with the United
Steelworkers union. Johnston saw the tail end of the industry's era
of expansion and world dominance and the beginning of its painful
contraction and awakening to a new order of world competition.
   He still headed bargaining for USX in 1986 when the producers
negotiated separate contracts. USX, the largest steelmaker in the
United States, took a six-month strike by the union in its
determination to keep labor costs to a minimum.
   ``He's a wonderful raconteur and a brilliant debater, and it's a
great challenge to be in an argument with him, which I was from
time to time,'' said Lynn Williams, USW president.
   Johnston deserves some credit for the beginnings in the 1980
industry talks of labor management participation teams, one of the
progressive arrangements that has become a hallmark of the
industry's restructuring, Williams said. But whatever progress USX
made on its own in labor relations soon disintegrated in the bitter
battle with the union over an aborted company plan to import steel
from Britain for processing on USX mills.
   USX remains a laggard among major steelmakers, he said.
   ``They're certainly not one of the leaders, but they're not
entirely removed from the process,'' Williams said.
   Thomas Sterling, a vice president, took charge of labor
relations at the USX steel division after the strike ended Feb. 1,
1987. The oil and diversified units by then had their own labor
relations hierarchy, shrinking Johnston's domain to the 900-member
corporate staff, although he remained responsible for pension and
benefit programs corporatewide.
   USX Chairman David Roderick said he was disappointed to learn
from Johnston six months ago of his plans to leave by the end of
May. Roderick said he and chairman-elect Charles Corry feel
fortunate Johnston will be available as a consultant on labor
matters.
   ``Johnston ... is the only person ever to serve as chief
negotiator for five separate industries: basic steel, bituminous
coal, portland cement, iron ore and Great Lakes shipping,''
Roderick said.
   USX had operations in each of those industries at one time.

   The South Korean government bought 6.6 million
pounds of U.S. beef in Denver from a Los Angeles company, one of
the first times a foreign government has purchased beef on this
scale in the United States, the U.S. Meat Export Federation said
Monday.
   The Livestock Product Marketing Organization, a
quasi-governmental group responsible for Korean meat imports,
bought the U.S. boneless boxed beef valued at $11.4 million from
the All American Corp. of Los Angeles, the Denver-based federation
said in a news statement.
   The federation said the purchase, which was completed last
Friday, came after bids were made by 16 U.S. companies.
   ``This purchase is important because it represents the opening
of a significant market for U.S. beef producers and packers,''
federation President Alan Middaugh said. ``Koreans have
demonstrated a keen demand for beef products, and compose the
fastest-growing market for U.S. beef exports next to Japan.''
   Korea is expected to buy more than 100 million pounds of beef in
1989. Australia is one of the United States' largest competitors
for this market, according to the Meat Export Federation.

<TEXT>
   Southland Corp. announced Monday it will seek a
purchaser for its 50 percent stake in Citgo Petroleum Corp. and may
consider offers for its distribution and processing centers.
   The convenience store chain also announced its losses widened to
$169.4 million in the first quarter of 1989.
   Southland President Jere W. Thompson attributed the loss, which
included $56 million from a one-time debt exchange offer in
January, to the high interest and non-cash charges brought about
its 1987 leveraged buyout.
   The costly after-effects of the LBO, which Southland officials
expect to continue until 1992, obliterated a successful three-month
merchandising period, company officials said.
   Thompson said Southland must continue to ``aggressively seek
ways to reduce the size and cost of our LBO-related debt.''
   Alternatives to reduce the company's debt include selling its
share in Citgo and seeking a way to generate cash from the
distribution and processing centers _ possibly through a sale,
financing or some sort of joint venture, the company said.
   Citgo, based in Tulsa, Okla., has attractive assets, including
the nation's eighth largest petroleum refinery, in Lake Charles,
La., Thompson said.
   Thompson said Southland intends to continue its product supply
contract with Citgo, even if its stake in the company is sold.
   The five distribution centers and six food centers supply more
than 8,000 retail and food service customers in 43 state, the
District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
   ``We expect that the majority of the proceeds we receive will be
applied to, and would significantly reduce, the remaining $1.56
billion of our LBO bank debt,'' Thompson said.
   The first quarter loss of $169.4 million compared with a deficit
of $71.5 million in the first three months of 1988.
   Revenue as pegged at $1.90 billion, an increase of 6.1 percent
over the $1.79 billion for the same period a year earlier.
   Southland is the world's largest convenience retailer, and has
about 7,000 7-Eleven and other convenience units in the United
States and Canada.

<TEXT>
   Top Exxon executives contradicted
government witnesses Monday, insisting they repeatedly urged the
quick use of chemicals to disperse the nation's largest oil spill
but that federal authorities turned them down.
   Their testimony before a five-member subcommittee of the U.S.
House Interior Committee went against earlier statements by both
the Coast Guard and the state's top environmental official, who
said the oil company did not seek widespread use of dispersant
chemicals to break down the oil.
   Exxon executives also disclosed for the first time that the
cleanup has cost the oil giant $95 million to date.
   ``We came to Alaska to use dispersants,'' Exxon Shipping Co.
President Frank Iarossi told the panel. ``I was pleading on my part
to begin dispersal use ... we were very aggressive.''
   He said opposition from the state Department of Environmental
Conservation and the Coast Guard blocked the chemicals' use or
limited them to tests or only small-scale use.
   ``We're confidant that had we obtained prompt permission to use
the dispersant, the environmental damage (of the spill) would have
been mitigated,'' said Exxon USA President Bill Stevens.
   Stevens said early use of dispersants or early burning would
have broken up large amounts of spilled oil. Iarossi said the
chemicals would have dispersed perhaps 40 percent of the Alaskan
crude oil.
   Dennis Kelso, commissioner of Alaska's Department of
Environmental Conservation, refuted that testimony and described
Exxon's account Monday as a ``fabrication.'' Dispersants in parts
of Prince William Sound had been pre-approved by the state even
before the oil spill, he said.
   ``Dispersants were not used extensively in the three days
following the tanker accident because the winds and seas were too
calm to provide the turbulence necessary to mix them with oil,''
Kelso said in a statement.
   On Sunday, Kelso said Exxon and its pipeline service company,
Alyeska, spread ``disinformation'' by contending use of dispersants
was sought. Kelso testified that Exxon did not request permission
to use the chemicals.
   ``Neither of them had the equipment on site to deal with it,
either through mechanical means or chemical means,'' he said.
   The subcommittee held two days of hearings to investigate the
oil spill, which occurred March 24 when an Exxon tanker struck a
reef outside normal shipping channels in Prince William Sound,
about 25 miles out of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline terminal at
Valdez. The tanker's bottom was ripped open and it leaked more than
10 million gallons of crude.
   The former captain of the vessel, Joseph Hazelwood, 42, is
accused of operating the ship while intoxicated and faces trial
June 20 in Valdez.
   Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins, the No. 2 Coast Guard official involved
in the spill cleanup, also testified Monday that the oil industry
did not seek permission to use large amounts of dispersants
immediately after the spill.
   Robbins and the Coast Guard's Valdez commander both said Exxon
and Alyeska did not urge the use of dispersants, although tests on
a small scale were conducted. They proved inconclusive.
   The issue of the dispersants is significant because Alyeska as
well as Exxon has said the spill could have been contained more
effectively if permission had been granted for the chemicals' use.
The question of their use will likely play a major role in lawsuits
stemming from the spill, said Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., the
subommittee chairman.
   Robbins also testified that Exxon must put more work crews on
the beaches if it hopes to meet a September deadline to clean up
oil.
   ``It appears they need to expand their resources in order to
meet the fall completion,'' Robbins said. He described the spill as
``one of the worst economic and environmental calamities this
nation has faced.''
   ``I don't expect the beaches by the end of the summer to be
squeaky clean,'' Robbins said. ``But I would like to see some
places that are clean and places where the impact (of the oil) is
removed.''
   Robbins is directly responsible for coordinating the cleanup
operation, reporting to Coast Guard Commandant Paul A. Yost Jr.,
President Bush's emissary to the spill site.
   Exxon, in a plan that has yet to win Yost's approval, has called
for the worst of the oil to be cleaned off five islands in the
sound by Wednesday, with 364 miles to be cleansed by Sept. 15. The
leading edge of the floating oil has reached Wide Bay, about 450
miles southwest of Valdez.
   The subcommittee also heard from fishermen who said they fear
their multimillion-dollar catch in Prince William Sound will be
reduced this season to protect seafood consumers from the effects
of the oil.
   At an estimated $84 million, Prince William Sound has the
nation's eighth-largest commercial fishing industry, said Ken
Adams, a fishing industry leader from Cordova. About 85 percent of
the catch is salmon.

   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. on Monday
reported a net loss of $421,000 for the first quarter, the lowest
shortfall since the company acquired MGM-UA three years ago.
   The loss, which came on revenue of nearly $232 million, compared
with a $14.1 million deficit on revenue of $182.6 million a year
earlier.
   TBS Chairman Ted Turner said in a statement greater operating
profits and a $3 million gain from land sales offset some of the
company's losses.
   Revenue for TBS' entertainment segment for the quarter ended
March 31 rose to $82.3 million from $57.8 million, mainly because
of the addition of Turner Network Television, the company reported.
   TBS' news division, which includes Cable News Network, had
revenue of nearly $79 million, up from $59.8 million a year earlier.
   The company's syndication and licensing division brought in
first-quarter revenue of $57.4 million, up from $51.5 million. The
company said that growth came from a new wrestling operation,
increased home video sales and merchandise licensing.

   Halliburton Co. reported Monday its earnings
