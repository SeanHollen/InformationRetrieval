   Solidarity and government negotiators said
Tuesday that talks on political and economic reform were threatened
by the failure of the official trade union alliance to agree on a
plan to index wages to prices to protect workers' incomes.
   But both sides expressed hope that agreement still could be
reached. The representatives made their comments in separate
statements carried by the state-run news agency PAP early Tuesday.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and other top Solidarity leaders
and advisers appeared exhausted after they returned to the Roman
Catholic Episcopate after 10 hours of talks with Interior Minister
Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak and other top government and officials from
OPZZ, the official trade union alliance.
   ``The situation is relatively dramatic. The talks are not
finished. We will continue them today. Of course, there are still
chances, even big ones,'' Walesa told reporters waiting outside the
Episcopate.
   PAP also said the talks would continue Tuesday.
   It was the second time in less than a week that top
representatives of both sides met at a government residence in
Magdalenka south of Warsaw to discuss issues blocking progress at
the talks, which began Feb. 6.
   The key outstanding issue appears to be a Solidarity proposal to
index wages to prices to protect workers' incomes against inflation.
   The executive committee of the OPZZ on Monday opposed the
Solidarity plan and called for a lump sum indexation of wages.
   ``The executive committee does not accept the method of
indexation of wages compensating for only 80 percent of price
increases, particularly as this has been conditioned on the wage
capacities of work places,'' an OPZZ statement said.
   The OPZZ warned ``against the social consequences which the
introduction of indexation mechanisms agreed by (Solidarity) and
the authorities could have. ... It does not contribute to a cooling
down of unrest, but can even lead to its aggravation.''
   Solidarity charged that the OPZZ position presented ``the state
of negotiations and the stand of Solidarity in a lying and
irresponsible way.''
   The Solidarity statement also accused the OPZZ of trying to
break down the round table and ``destroying an apparent chance to
save the country. ... They (OPZZ) are playing with Poland.''
   The banned union called on the government to stop raising prices
until indexation is introduced and called for the legalization of
Solidarity as soon as possible.
   However, the statement ended on an optimistic note.
   ``Solidarity states it is possible to lead the round table to
the end. It lies in Poland's interests. Solution of the present
situation depends on the consequences and imagination of Polish
political authorities.''
   The government side also expressed its concern over the stance
of the OPZZ, saying in a statement that ``solutions proposed in the
OPZZ resolution threaten the economy, create a danger of social
conflicts and seriously hinder the process of the round table.''
   The group that accompanied Walesa included journalist Tadeusz
Mazowiecki and historian Bronislaw Geremek, union leaders Zbigniew
Bujak and Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, political theorists Adam Michnik and
Jacek Kuron as well as Gdansk Bishop Tadeusz Goclowski and Rev.
Alojzy Orszulik.
   Wednesday is the tentative date set for the final agreement on
legalizing Solidarity and introducing a package of political and
economic reforms, according to a communique issued after a meeting
between the sides March 29.
   But Solidarity spokesmen have expressed doubt that the target
can be met.
   Three groups on economic, political and trade union reforms are
scheduled to meet Tuesday. Mazowiecki said the further top level
meeting could be held after the conclusion of those discussions.
   The broad outline of an agreement was reached some time ago.
   In exchange for legalization of Solidarity and other independent
groups that were banned after the December 1981 martial law
crackdown, the opposition would agree to participate in June
parliament elections that would guarantee the Communist Party and
its allies 65 percent of the 460 seats.
   A presidency and a senate of about 100 members would be created.
The opposition would be expected to win the senate, which would be
picked in an open democratic vote.
   The president would likely be a member of the Communist Party
and would be elected jointly by parliament and the senate given the
strength of the communist party and its allies in the larger
parliament.
   The opposition also would have access to mass media, including a
daily newspaper and two weeklies and at least one program a week on
national TV and radio.
   The opposition wants the authorities to agree to a formula of
indexing workers' wages to compensate for Poland's unabating
inflation which topped 60 percent last year.
   Authorities proposed talks last August during the year's second
nationwide wave of crippling industrial strikes.
   They hope agreement will provide Poland with political and labor
stability so economic reforms designed to combat Poland's $39
billion foreign debt. They also hope agreement will persuade the
West to invest in Poland.

<HEAD>Report Pirates Massacred 56 Vietnamese Boat People</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of two known survivors of a
massacre of Vietnamese boat people by pirates in the South China
Sea said the men were killed and the women and girls abducted.
   The report carried Monday by the Bernama news agency quoted
14-year-old Doa Hoa as saying 58 people were aboard the craft
seeking refuge in Malaysia when the pirates attacked March 25.
   He said 35 people, most of them men and boys, were killed and
their bodies dumped overboard, and the pirates forced the remaining
women and girls aboard their boat.
   Bernama reported the other survivor was a 33-year-old man who
hid in the engine compartment. He was not identified.
   The U.N. Office of High Commissioner for Refugees said it sent a
report of the massacre to the regional anti-piracy center in
Songkhla, Southern Thailand.
   Jean-Marie Fakhouri, the UNHCR's deputy representative here,
said law enforcement agencies would try to find the pirates and
take action.
   Bernama reported Doa Hoa was being treated at a hospital in
Kuala Trengganu, 210 miles northeast of Kuala Lumpur, for face and
head wounds.
   The national news agency reported Doa Hoa gave this account:
   On the third day of the journey six pirates attacked and
``stabbed and battered many of the men and boys before throwing
them into the sea. The others, mostly girls and women, had their
hands tied and were herded into the pirates' boat.''
   He was thrown into the sea but managed to swim back to the boat
after the pirates had gone.
   The boat drifted near an oil rig, and a vessel delivering
supplies to the rig spotted the boat and rescued Doa Hoa and the
other survivor. They were given medical treatment at another oil
platorm and then flown to Kuala Trengganu.
   Some of the victims were Doa Hoa's relatives, also seeking
refuge in the West, but his parents were not aboard. His parents,
who work at a banana plantation near Ho Chi Minh City, formerly
Saigon, has asked the relatives to care for the boy.
   Fakhouri said 55 cases of piracy against boat people from
Vietnam were reported in 1988, and 13 have been reported in the
first two months of this year.
   He said that in the 68 attacks, 388 people disappeared and were
presumed dead.
   Fakhouri also said 2,802 boat people landed in Malaysia in March
compared to 1,759 in February.
   About 16,500 Vietnamese refugees are in Malaysia now, down from
a peak of 76,500 in June 1979.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Government forces on Monday battled
mutinous soldiers who demand the release of an alleged coup leader,
and at least four rebels were killed, radio stations and witnesses
reported.
   The fighting began after members of the elite Leopards Battalion
occupied the airport. Several of them roamed the capital, shooting
in the air and shouting: ``Get off the streets, the city belongs to
us.''
   Residents stayed home, and businesses and schools were closed.
Streets were littered with burning tires, but it was not known who
set them on fire.
   The Leopards took over the government television and radio
stations at 3:30 p.m. and halted broadcasts.
   The shooting between guardsmen and Leopards broke out Monday
afternoon, when the two sides confronted each other driving on
Delmas Road, a main commercial throughfare in the capital.
   Radio stations gave varying reports on casualties, from four to
eight killed and eight wounded. The reports could not be confirmed.
   Radio Metropole, an independent station, said 300 demonstrators
supporting the Leopards paraded down Delmas Road shouting
anti-government slogans, demanding Avril resign and erecting
barricades of flaming tires.
   In the afternoon, several Leopards made three demands over the
independent radio station Haiti-Inter. They said they want alleged
coup leader Lt. Col. Himmler Rebu released, a civilian government
to replace Avril, and the complete restoration of the 1987
constitution, which was suspended last June.
   The constitution has 37 articles which mostly limit the role of
the army.
   U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Susan Clyde said the rebels occupied
Haiti's international airport, which remained closed.
   ``Everything is calm except for the Leopards,'' she said. ``They
say they want Rebu released, and that's the standoff.''
   The Leopards were created in the 1960s by ousted dictator
Jean-Claude Duvalier and are the best trained and most professional
in the military. As opposed to others in the 7,000-man army, the
Leopards have not been associated with human rights violations.
   Sources have said Rebu and the other three led the attempt
Sunday to overthrow Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, the military ruler put
in office by a coup six months ago.
   Avril's government removed Rebu from command of the Leopards and
put him under military guard at an undisclosed location. The fates
of the other three alleged coup leaders were not known.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said: ``We are pleased that President Avril's authority has been
restored. U.S. policy objectives for Haiti remain the promotion of
democratic reform, respect for human rights, credible economic
development programs and cooperation on narcotics issues.
   ``President Avril has made significant progress on this agenda
in the last six months and the United States government will
continue to support his efforts as the process moves forward.''
   Loyal soldiers in tanks rescued Avril as he was being driven to
the airport Sunday night, in handcuffs, to be flown into exile. It
would have been the impoverished Caribbean nation's third coup in
less than a year.
   He made a televised speech soon after midnight, flanked by
soldiers in battle gear, but gave no details of the coup attempt.
He blamed it on ``some members of the army forces, blinded by their
exorbitant ambitions,'' but said he still had ``faith in the army.''
   How many of the battalion's 300 members were involved in the
mutiny Monday was not known.
   Motives for Sunday's coup remained unclear, but it appeared
linked to the arrest last week of four ranking army officers who
have been accused of drug trafficking.
   Fritz Longchamp, director of the Washington Office on Haiti
research group, said by telephone that rumors had circulated in the
military that Avril had a long list of officers to be fired in a
crackdown on narcotics and corruption.
   He said four of those were rumored to be the coup leaders: Rebu;
Col. Guy Francois, commander of the Dessalines Barracks behind the
presidential palace; Col. Phillipe Biambey, commander of the Palace
Guard, and Col. George Valcin, police chief of Port-au-Prince.
   Longchamp said the coup attempt ended after the government
negotiated the release of hostages held at the Leopards camp. At
least five people were believed held at one stage, including
Avril's wife, Marie-Ange, one of their sons and the defense and
interior minister, Acedius St. Louis.
   Louis Dejoie, a moderate politician, said pressure for a coup
had grown for a month and dismissal of the army officers ``was the
last straw.''
   The United States made a crackdown on drug trafficking a
condition for restoring $70 million in aid suspended after the
abortive elections of 1987, during which thugs killed 34 voters.

   The old people make their way in ones or
twos across the cobbled street, down the steps to the church
basement and the registration tables.
   There they pour out tearful, horrifying stories of brutal work
in freezing conditions, a daily ration of less than one pound of
watery bread, and relatives who did not make it back from the
wastelands of Siberia.
   The stories have been repeated thousands of times since January
as people register for membership in the newly legalized ``Union of
Siberiaks,'' Polish slang for people deported to Siberia _ or more
generally to the Soviet Union _ during the Stalinist era.
   ``Siberiaks'' are coming into the open after decades of silence
because of a changed political climate that permits them to speak
publicly about wrongs committed against them by Soviet secret
police and their Polish helpers.
   ``There are people who come now and say they spent eight years
there, 10 years, 14 years _ two or three times more than the entire
war. That is what so terrible about it,'' said Ryszard Reiff,
president of the association.
   ``If one travels for six weeks in a boxcar built for cattle,
during such travel out of 90 people locked up in a car, 20 died and
were thrown out .... Small children are freezing or suffocating in
the car. And then those tiny bodies are simply thrown out ....
   ``Can one ever forget a thing like this?''
   According to Reiff, about 1.5 million Poles were deported deep
into the Soviet Union between 1939 and the early 1950s.
   Most of the deportations came soon after the Soviets invaded
Poland from the east in September 1939 while Nazi Germany was
invading from the west. The two powers had secretly agreed to
partition Poland in the Ribbentrop-Molotov non-aggression pact of
August 1939.
   A smaller wave of deportations took place at the end of the war
when the Red Army won back control of Poland from the Nazis, and
the Soviet NKVD secret police arrived to sweep away any possible
resistance to communist control of postwar Poland.
   Of those deported, about 500,000 Poles died in the Soviet Union,
500,000 remained there or emigrated to other countries, and 500,000
eventually returned to Poland, Reiff said.
   Reiff said he was an underground resistance officer who was
caught by the Soviets in 1944 and sent away for two years until he
escaped and walked back to Poland. He remembers Siberia as a
``strange and terrible country.''
   ``There they care neither about space nor about time ....
Siberia is big, even the Soviet soldiers wore unhemmed coats. They
wore endless coats, like the endless land. And they didn't care
about time either. They would say `for five minutes' and it lasted
five years.''
   Reiff was asked to lead the Siberiaks by a group of about 20
people who won permission from communist authorities to organize
the union in December 1988. A former head of the Catholic political
group PAX, the 65-year-old journalist-politician is known in Poland
as the man who was removed from the Council of State after he was
the only member to protest martial law in 1981.
   Since the union's first meeting Jan. 13, 6,000 people have
registered in Warsaw alone, and a bigger group has formed in the
southwestern city of Wroclaw, said group spokesman Jerzy-Marek
Wlodarek. A nationwide membership count has not been completed.
   Some members have shocking accounts. One man reported being sent
to Siberia as late as 1953, when deportations of Poles were thought
to have ended. Another wrote claiming to have seen Polish officers
being taken to their executions by the NKVD, predecessor of the
KGB, at Katyn in 1940.
   Although the Polish government has begun to admit Soviet guilt
for the massacre of Polish officers at Katyn, and there have been
several pieces in the official press about Siberian deportations,
such topics remain very sensitive.
   Siberiaks seem to care little about eventual compensation for
pension and disability payments for these imprisonments. Their main
interest seems to be speaking loudly about the crimes against them
so that they are not forgotten.
   ``The truth finally comes out that not only Germans were killing
Poles, but somebody else was too,'' said one elderly woman at St.
Andrew's Church, moments after enrolling in the union.
   ``I was 10 years old and went to Siberia with my mother, brother
and sister. And before that, they arrested my father for having
volunteered in 1920 (to fight with Poland in a war against the
fledgling Soviet Union.)''
   Her father was put in a camp at Kotlas, she said. ``There were
thousands of Poles killed there. They were leading people into the
woods, and those people never came back. They were murdering them
there, like in Katyn.''
   Taken from her home near Bialystok in 1940, she did heavy labor
for four years until her release at age 14.
   White-haired Jadwiga Cieslicka came to the union in March
clutching a bound, typewritten manuscript and scrapbook by her late
husband, Kazimierz, recounting his fate and that of his fellow
villagers taken to Siberia.
   She opened it delicately to show a letter he wrote his mother on
a scrap of brown paper and photos of 21 men from his village who
had been arrested.
   ``This is the moment where it first sees daylight,'' said Mrs.
Cieslicka. ``Up to now, I could not show it to anybody. I want to
reveal everything my husband left, so it is not forgotten.''
   Her husband, who died two years ago, lived in Urzedow, a village
near Lublin in eastern Poland. He fought along with other men of
the village in the Home Army against the Germans.
   ``In '44, when the Soviets came in, he was taken away. And it
was totally unexpected because they thought they were fighting the
same enemy,'' she said.
   He and his brother were put to work as miners for two years.
``It was in Siberia where they have white bears and temperatures of
40 degrees below zero,'' she said with a shudder.
   Their son, Jaroslaw, a doctor, says conditions in Siberia
hastened his father's death.
   ``We can speak about it out loud now. It's wonderful that there
is this union,'' he said.
   ``It can't be forgotten, the people who did it, who killed our
fathers. They should be held responsible.''

<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 41 years of flying dangerous
missions around the globe, comic-strip hero Steve Canyon was
hanging up his blue flight suit today.
   Air Force Col. Stevenson B. Canyon was to be retired in a
ceremony at Ohio State University. Canyon's creator, cartoonist
Milton Caniff, was a graduate of Ohio State and willed many of his
drawings and papers to the university. He died last year at age 81.
   ``Through Steve Canyon, Milt Caniff did a lot to keep up the
spirits of fliers and the Air Force,'' said 1st Lt. Lynn Ellen
Bryant of McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey. ``He really became
a part of Air Force lore, and people remember.''
   A biography and list of Canyon's exploits have been prepared by
the Air Force for this afternoon's presentation to the university.
An exhibit will be established in the journalism school's library,
which recently was dedicated to Caniff's memory.
   The final Steve Canyon strip appeared in newspapers on June 4,
shortly after Caniff's death.
   Ohio State spokesman Leon Rubin said today's presentation was
the Air Force's idea. Canyon is said to have attended Ohio State
before joining the Army Air Corps _ the predecessor of the Air
Force _ in 1947.
   Ms. Bryant said the Air Force went through all the old Canyon
comic strips to compile a ``personnel record''for the character.
   ``People here and in New York have dediced a lot of time,
energy and imagination to the project,'' Ms. Bryant said. ``We are
very happy and honored to do something that will be seen by others
and is going to last.''
   Canyon's service record ``includes decorations, citations,
movement orders for each base, family data, all sorts of good
stuff,'' she said. ``We also put together a flight record listing
all his flying achievements, the planes he was qualified to fly,
the hours in each plane, the instructor, how many missions he
flew.''
   The Air Force decided that since his record was so varied, he
should be assigned to the Office of Special Investigations.
   ``That also allowed us to say certain things were classified and
we coudn't discuss them,'' Ms. Bryant said.
   The Air Force planned to present the university with a modern
uniform with Canyon's insignia, rank and name tag, along with a
retiremente for Canyon and his wife, Summer Smith.
   The officers at McGuire made a case for the display that will
hold Canyon's 13 medals and eight ribbons. It is inscribed:
``Stevenson B. Canyon, AAF-USAF, 1947.''

<HEAD>Coup Attempt By Rebel Officers Foiled, Avril Speaks To Nation</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to CORRECT Tuesday to Monday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The government said it foiled an
attempt Sunday to overthrow Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, and U.S.
officials said loyal troops apparently rescued Avril as he was
being driven away to be deported.
   Avril told the nation early Monday in a televised address that
rebel soldiers ``blinded by their exorbitant ambition'' attempted
to overthrow his government and appealed to Haitians to support his
leadership.
   He did not provide details of attempted coup or say how it was
foiled. There were no reports of casualties.
   A government communique read earlier over state-run television
said ``certain officers besieged'' the presidential palace ``and
attempted to overthrow the government.''
   Presidential guardsmen told journalists Avril was taken captive
at his mansion in Canape Verte, a wealthy neighborhood in the hills
overlooking the capital, as he returned home from a party early
Sunday.
   Sources said four military officers had tried to overthrow
Avril, who assumed power six months ago in this impoverished
Caribbean country's second coup in less than a year.
   In his 10-minute speech, Avril said: ``At a time when the
government is doing its utmost to ensure democratic progress and
economic recovery, once again the stability of the Haitian nation
was threatened.''
   He was flanked by at least a dozen soldiers dressed in battle
gear, including Sgt. Major Joseph Heubreux, who led the coup by
noncommissioned officers who put Avril in power last September.
   ``On the night of April 1 and 2, some members of the armed
forces blinded by their exorbitant ambitions attempted to overthrow
the government which I assumed Sept. 17 1988 as commander and chief
of the armed forces and president of the military government,''
Avril said.
   U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Susan Clyde said earlier that reports
indicated the coup attempt occurred about 4 a.m. and that Avril was
detained for a time.
   ``But it appears that when he was being taken to the airport to
be deported ... members of the presidential guard arrived at the
airport and escorted him back to the palace to be president
again,'' she said in a telephone interview.
   She said the attempted coup was ``totally bloodless.''
   However, Radio Liberte quoted an unidentified soldier as
Port-au-Prince would be ``set on fire'' unless the government
released one of the alleged coup leaders, identified by the soldier
as Lt. Col. Himmler Rebu, commander of the Leopards battalion
commando unit.
   Military sources said Rebu was under military guard at the
National Palace.
   Loyal soldiers told journalists that Avril's wife, Marie-Ange,
and her mother were taken captive with Avril but released a couple
hours later.
   They also said two of Avril's brothers and Interior Minister
Col. Acedius St. Louis and his son were seized by the rebels.
   Avril's son, brothers and St. Louis and his son reportedly were
freed after two tanks rolled into the Leopards' barracks and
negotiated their release Sunday night. There were no reports of
casualties.
   Initial reports had said the army commander, Maj. Gen. Herard
Abraham, was among the coup leaders. But later accounts said that
was not correct and that the plot collapsed when Abraham refused
the rebels' offer of the presidency.
   Abraham was foreign minister under the government of Lt. Gen.
Henri Namphy, who Avril replaced.
   The attempt came four days after the discharge of four top army
officers accused of drug trafficking.
   Unconfirmed reports said four army officers planned the coup,
including Gen. Guy Francois, commander of the Dessalines barracks
in Port-au-Prince, which is the base of the most feared unit in
Haiti's 7,000-man army. The reports said all four officers had been
detained, but there was no confirmation.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Dennis Harter said the
situation in Haiti ``remains fluid.''
   Haiti's international airport was closed and large numbers of
soldiers were at the palace and on the streets, which were calm.
   Gunfire was heard twice near the palace in the pre-dawn hours.
Several hours later there was another spurt of gunfire in the same
area.
   Five soldiers of the Presidential Guard arrived at independent
radio station Liberte at 11:45 a.m. and read a statement denying
Avril was ousted.
   ``There has not been any visible reaction from the people,'' Ms.
Clyde said. ``The streets are very calm. People are going about
their business as usual.''
   Richard Melton, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for
Caribbean affairs, visited Haiti last Monday and told Avril
resumption of U.S. aid depended in part on Haiti's efforts to crack
down on the narcotics trade.
   On Wednesday, four top army officers accunvolvement in
the drug trade were discharged.
ay, a conservative political leader, said those
dismissals mighriggered the coup attempt.
   Leslie Manigat, Haiti's last civ president, was elected in
violence-marred elections in January replaced a junta led
by Namphy that had governed since dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier
fled to exile in France 9-year family
dictatorship.
   Namphy then overthrew Manigat in a coup June 20, 1988. On Sept.
17, Avril came to power in a coup.
   Two weeks ago, Avril partly restored constitutional rights
suspended in 1987. He also appointed a mostly civilian Cabinet and
agreed to the establit of an electoral council to prepare for
free elections.
   But there was widssatisfaction over the pace of his
reforms, and human rights groups accused the of
continuing repression.

   Japan is showing off its lead in a new generation

baseball tournament to viewers in cinema-quality

   For an hour a day during the 10-day tournament, Japan's public
television network, NHK, is broadcasting via satellite the wider,
crystal-clear pictures with sound quality similar to that of
compact discs.
   Millions of Japanese were expected to watch the tournament, but
only viewers watching on a few hundred specially equipped sets will
see the sharper images.
   ``Because of the extra screen width, a broadcast of a baseball
game can show the pitcher winding up to throw to a batter and
runners on first and third base, all in the same picture,'' said
Sosuke Yasuma, director of high-definition TV programs for NHK.
``TV cameramen will need to relearn how to compose their pictures.''
   The new technology creates its dramatically sharper images by
using about twice as many horizontal scanning lines and five times
as much video ``information'' as current television.
   Industry officials say the technology, known as HDTV, will
revolutionize other industries that deal with images, such as
printing, graphic design and movie-making.
   Some parts of the Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea, were
broadcast on HDTV last fall. But this week's broadcast represents
the beginning of regular programming.
   NHK next plans to broadcast a two-week sumo wrestling tournament
in May and then begin regular hourlong daily HDTV transmissions in
June.
   Although few people will be watching at first _ the special
monitors now cost about $60,000 and only several hundred have been
made _ the broadcasts demonstrate Japan's lead over the United
States and Europe in the race to commercialize HDTV technology.
   At stake, NHK says, are potential worldwide HDTV sales estimated
at $80 billion by 1995.
   In addition, countries that don't develop HDTV industries will
have difficulty competing in a wide range of future commercial and
military products, analysts say. HDTV ties together a variety of
advanced technologies, including digital image processing,
high-capacity satellite transmission, fiber optics and
micro-electronics.
   Because of potential military applications such as in image
sensors for missiles or spy satellites, the U.S. Department of
Defense announced in December a $30 million program of grants to
develop an American HDTV system.
   But U.S. industry officials and some congressmen call the
Pentagon program too little, too late.
   ``The United States should have gotten into this long ago,''
said John Stern, who represents U.S. electronics associations in
Japan. ``Japan has already commercialized this technology, while
the United States today is approximately six years behind.''
   Japanese makers are so far ahead of U.S. companies that they
could quickly dominate the U.S. market if their system gains
international acceptance in the near future, Stern said.
   Engineers at NHK began in the 1960s to develop an improved TV
system they hoped would unify the world's seven current TV systems.
Since then, under NHK leadership, Japanese companies reportedly
have spent more than $700 million on HDTV development, with little
government involvement.
   In a crash program over the last two years, European companies
designed and produced a separate HDTV system. The European Economic
Community wants to begin consumer HDTV equipment sales and
satellite broadcasts by 1992.
   Recently, South Korea announced it will spend about $150
million, including $90 million from private companies, in a
four-year effort to develop an HDTV industry.
   But while European and South Korean companies have remained
strong in consumer electronics, American companies would need to
rebuild an industry they largely abandoned or sold to foreign firms.
   Except for Zenith Electronics, all major television factories in
the United States are now owned by overseas companies.
   While HDTV will be broadcast in Japan and Europe directly from
satellites on special frequencies, Federal Communications
Commission standards say U.S. HDTV broadcasts must use current TV
channels and be viewable on present televisions. But special HDTV
monitors would still be necessary for the improved picture quality.
   Both Japan and Europe still hope their systems will be adopted
worldwide, at least for professional studio equipment such as video
tape recorders and cameras.
   ``We still wish Japan would see the wisdom of a single world
system based on the European standard, rather than trying to impose
a non-compatible system on the rest of the world,'' said Michael
Lake, spokesman for the EEC in Japan.

<HEAD>Dollar Down, Shares Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished lower against the Japanese yen
today following intervention by the Bank of Japan, while share
prices hit a new record high on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which gained a marginal
12.55 points Friday, surpassed the 33,000-point mark for the first
time and added another 203.39 points, or 0.62 percent, to finish at
33,042.07.
   Today's index marked the fifth consecutive gain in six days.
   Dealers said the beginning of Japan's new business year was
sparking strong buying interest, especially among individual
investors. For most Japanese companies, the new fiscal year starts
April 1.
   A well-balanced mixture of supply and demand in the stock
market, as well as stabilized oil prices, also encouraged buying,
said a dealer with a securities firm in Tokyo, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Trading was active with first section volume estimated at 1.4
billion shares. Among the winners were automobiles, chemicals and
papers.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 132.26 yen, down 0.29
yen from Friday's 132.55 yen. Opening higher at 133.18 yen, the
currency plunged while moving in a range of 132.20-133.33 yen.
   The Bank of Japan's dollar-selling, yen-supporting intervention
during early morning trading helped push the dollar down, said Yuko
Kawai with Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   She said the Tokyo market opened with an upward trend following
dollar-buying in the Sydney market, which had opened earlier, but
Japanese investors sold off their U.S. currency after the Japanese
bank's intervention.
   The Bank of Japan sold dollars for yen in Tokyo early today for
the first time since the Plaza currency agreement in late 1985,
traders said. In the Plaza Accord, monetary authorities for major
currency nations agreed to bring down the value of the dollar,
which then was trading at about 242 yen.
   Traders estimated the central bank sold about $10 million. The
Bank of Japan does not comment officially on its market
interventions.
   Finance officials from the so-called Group of Seven leading
currency nations met Sunday near Washington and issued a communique
saying they had ``reiterated their commitment to cooperate closely
on the exchange markets.''
   The release of the G-7 communique today also helped weaken the
dollar, but it did not boost yen-buying incentives in Tokyo either,
Ms. Kawai said.
   Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita was reported today as
saying the G-7 was more concerned about an excessive rise of the
dollar than an excessive fall.
   Sumita said the G-7 had ``reaffirmed to the markets'' its
determination to keep foreign exchange markets steady.

   Crews today searched for more bodies in
the rain-swollen Hatchie River, where at least seven people plunged
to their deaths after a 60-foot-section of a half-century-old
bridge collapsed.
   Months of flooding on the Hatchie may have eroded the foundation
of a bridge pier, causing the U.S. 51 span to fail, said the state
highway commissioner.
   A tractor-trailer rig and at least four other vehicles fell 25
feet into the river.
   A 1987 inspection found no abnormalities, but the collapse
probably will lead the state to review its procedures, said Bill
Moore, a state transportation department inspector.
   ``We certainly will look at other bridges after this failure.
We'll probably re-evaluate our whole program of inspection on this
type of bridge,'' Moore said Sunday.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators were to meet
with state bridge inspectors today, authorities said.
   The collapse of the two-lane, northbound bridge occurred
Saturday night about 45 miles north of Memphis. A companion
two-lane southbound bridge was unaffected, although it remained
closed following the cave-in, the Tennessee Highway Patrol said.
   It was not known how many people were riding on the bridge when
it crumbled, authorities said.
   ``Some of the cars are chopped up so bad they're not sure how
many cars they are talking about,'' said Cecil Whaley, operations
officer of the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency.
   ``They don't have good eyewitness accounts to determine how many
cars were on the bridge.''
   Among the seven bodies recovered were those of a trucker and his
wife who had been returning home with a tractor-trailer they had
just bought in Memphis, police said.
   Billy Herron Sr., 49, of Ripley, was driving the 18-wheeler and
his wife, Betty, was following in a pickup truck, said Henning
Police Chief Charles Fain. Herron's parents, who had eaten dinner
with their son that night in Covington, apparently crossed the
bridge just before it failed, Fain said.
   Also recovered were the bodies of Mary Annette Davidson and her
husband, Jimmy Davidson, of Ripley.
   The bodies of Wilma Bonds, Jr., a 49-year-old Jehovah's Witness
minister; his wife, Barbara, 25; and their 4-year-old daughter,
Sophia, of Ripley, were pulled out Saturday night, Fain said.
   ``He never went to town otherwise. The only time we ever knew
they were in town was coming or going to church. They were real
religious, going to church every night,'' Fain said.
   The Hatchie was at 14.7 feet, 2.7 feet over flood stage, about
where the accident occurred, the National Weather Service said. It
was not raining when the bridge gave way but had been in previous
days.
   The river had been at flood stage at the bridge for most of the
last three months, Whaley said.
   The river is now about 300 feet wide and the pier that gave way
stands in water even when the river is below flood stage, Whaley
said.
   The flooding may have eroded the foundation of a bridge pier,
said Highway Commissioner Jimmy Evans.
   ``Continuous overbank flooding will cause a scouring that
actually took the vertical support of the pier out and the pier
fell,'' Evans said.
   Thunderstorms that brought heavy rain and 50 mph winds hampered
the search for bodies, Whaley said. Divers suspended their efforts
until morning, but workers continued to use a crane to lift parts
of the roadway out of the water, he said.
   Larry Prater of Covington said residents have been concerned for
some time that the bridge was getting old. Prater said three of his
relatives were in a pickup truck that drove over the bridge shortly
before it collapsed.
   ``I was telling my wife the other day, saying `That bridge with
as much water as we've had is a dangerous thing,''' he said.
   Aging highway bridges have collapsed in other states in recent
years. In April 1987, an upstate New York span collapsed, killing
10 people. In 1983, part of the Mianus Bridge in Connecticut
collapsed, killing three people.

<HEAD>Maine To Release Caribous With Hopes Of Restoring Herd</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GLENN ADAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Caribou, once so abundant in the north
Maine woods that a city was named after them, are being brought
back to state wilderness areas, where herds haven't roamed for more
than 80 years.
   Fourteen young caribou will be taken to an undisclosed area
within the 200,000-acre Baxter State Park in northern Maine, under
a 2-year-old campaign to restore the animal to the state.
   Seven males and seven females, born to a herd that originated in
Newfoundland, will be tranquilized and trucked to the area on
Tuesday and Wednesday.
   The caribou will spend several weeks in a 3-acre enclosure,
feasting on pellets they have lived on while in captivity. Then,
they will be released.
   Officials are keeping the location of the enclosure a secret,
fearing that people would disturb the herd.
   ``Essentially, I think the caribou could be loved to death,''
said biologist Mark McCollough, director of the privately funded
Maine Caribou Reintroduction Project. ``Too many people out there
could drive them away from the best habitat.''
   The reindeer-like animals were pushed to extinction in the state
by over-eager hunters, disease and development. The last Maine
caribou was seen in 1908 on the mile-high Mount Katahdin in what is
now Baxter park.
   State officials have talked about bringing back the caribou
since the 1920s. An attempt was made in 1963, but the two dozen
Canadian caribou released in Baxter park soon vanished, a result of
poaching and natural predators.
   Biologists and wildlife officials see the latest project as an
experiment, but are resolved to try a more sophisticated, phased-in
approach.
   In December 1986, more than two dozen caribou destined to become
the state's ``nursery herd'' were captured in Newfoundland and
trucked 1,200 miles to Maine. The animals to be released are the
offspring of those caribou.
   Even after the 14 caribou are released, 27 others will remain
protected in an enclosure at the University of Maine in Orono,
where the oldest will continue producing calves for future
releases. Up to 14 calves are expected to be born next month.
   Between 80 and 100 young caribou are expected to be released in
Maine's wilds during the next four years, said McCollough.
   Biologists plan to keep close tabs on the released caribou by
attaching radio collars that send a signal when the animals die.
   Two other research projects at the university are investigating
a potential threat to the caribou _ the ``brainworm'' parasite,
which also affects deer.
   Coordinators of the reintroduction project have hired a
biologist to monitor and protect the caribou at the park until
their final release this spring. After that, poaching remains a
threat, but the Legislature has imposed maximum fines of $10,000
and three years in prison for illegally killing a caribou.

   More than 20,000 people marched in a show
of support for a woman's right to have an abortion, one of several
demonstrations held around the country.
   Sunday's ``March for Women's Lives,'' was timed to counter
demonstrations by anti-abortion groups like the New York
state-based Operation Rescue, whose members disrupt clinics
nationwide where abortions are performed.
   In New York City, about 400 abortion rights activists, some
hoisting giant clothes hangers, clashed with anti-abortionists in
front of St. Patrick's Cathedral. Nine activists were arrested.
   In Los Angeles, pro-choice demonstrators gathered at City Hall,
where they drew outlines of women's bodies on the ground and placed
red-stained clothes hangers inside each outline. And in Atlanta,
about 75 activists bearing the slogan ``we will not go back''
rallied at the Capitol.
   Both sides have been galvanized by a recent U.S. Supreme Court
decision to hear a case that could eventually overturn the court's
1973 Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion.
   ``My mother had a choice. Will I?'' read a sign on a baby
carriage pushed by Jeanette Badal, 39, of Berkeley.
   ``I was able to make the choice because of Roe versus Wade. I
don't want anyone denied that choice,'' she said as she pushed her
9-month-old daughter.
   ``It's been my conviction but I hadn't actually come out and
marched before,'' added Carolyn Brady, 42, of Palo Alto. ``I just
think there's too much pressure from the other side, the
right-to-lifers. They're in the minority but they're getting much
more attention than they represent.''
   Margaret Connell, 59, of Santa Barbara, marched with her
85-year-old mother and 30-year-old daughter, carrying a sign that
said ``Three generations for choice.''
   The San Francisco march was sponsored by more than 100
organizations, including the National Organization for Women, the
Planned Parenthood Association and the American Civil Liberties
Union. It was held in conjunction with a scheduled April 9
``pro-choice'' rally in Washington, D.C.

   Police clashed in the western city of
Poznan with hundreds of marchers protesting the planned
construction of a nuclear power plant, and the government said 17
policemen were injured.
   A spokesman for the Solidarity Information Service blamed police
for Sunday's violence, saying officers blocked exit routes from a
rally then beat several hundred marchers.
   ``SIS is of the opinion that the incident occurred as the result
of the attitude of police which made it impossible for
demonstrators to disperse peacefully,'' said Wojciech Maziarski, a
spokesman in Warsaw for the service, which publicizes information
on opposition activities.
   The state-run PAP news agency said, ``Groups of youths acting
under the slogan of protecting the environment committed hooligan
acts by throwing stones, screws and benches at law enforcement
forces.''
   Seventeen officers were injured, one had to be taken to a
hospital and five police vehicles were damaged, PAP said. It did
not report any arrests or injuries.
   Maziarski said about 2,000 people participated in the march
protesting plans to construct a nuclear power station at Klempicz,
a city of about 585,000 people about 30 miles northwest of Poznan.
   The plant, to be built by the year 2000, would be Poland's
second nuclear power station. The first is under construction in
Zarnowiec on the Baltic coast, and is to be finished in two years.
   After attending a Mass in Poznan, the protesters marched to the
town square but could not leave for two hours because of police
blockades, Maziarski said.
   Maziarski said police beat marchers who tried to exit by one
street, then announced that the protesters could leave by another
street. When the marchers went to that street it too was blocked
and police used batons, tear gas and water cannon on the marchers,
he said.
   Maziarski said police later lifted the cordons.

   Security police said they imprisoned
two dissidents and raided offices today in a crackdown triggered by
a surprise trip to communist North Korea by a dissenting clergyman.
   The action came as South Korea's security agencies and police
formed an alliance to investigate anti-government activity, and
protesters battled riot police in support of the Rev. Moon Ik-hwan
and striking shipyard workers.
   Police said they charged Lee Jae-oh, 45, and Koh Un, 56, with
violating security laws and jailed them for seeking unauthorized
contact with North Korea.
   Koh, a poet, was accused of attempting to take six literary
figures to the North Korean border March 1 for unification talks.
Lee, a co-chairman of South Korea's main dissident United National
Democratic Movement, also was charged with conspiring to plan
Moon's trip. Moon went to North Korea last week.
   Government officials said they will arrest Moon when he returns.
He left Pyonyang today and is expected to come back to Seoul via
other countries, they said.
   North Korea has warned Moon's arrest would hurt its relations
with South Korea. The two Koreas maintain limited yet official
channels of dialogue on unification of the divided peninsula and
other matters.
   South Korean officials say Moon's trip aids North Korean
attempts to cause unrest and discredit the Seoul government.
   Dissenters in South Korea say the government is using it as an
excuse to clamp down on them.
   Also today, police barred 25 dissident leaders from leaving the
country, saying they might be wanted for investigations.
   Security officials also seized hundreds of leaflets and books in
raids on three Seoul offices, said sources requesting anonymity.
   South Korea's police, prosecutors and officers of the Agency for
National Security Planning and the Defense Security Command today
announced they are joining forces ``to guard the nation's
democratic system against all anti-state attempts by leftist
forces.'' These include leftist publications and illegal contact
with North Korea, they said.
   Today was the fourth day of clashes between thousands of radical
students and militant workers wielding firebombs, rocks and steel
and wood clubs against police armed who fired tear gas to disperse
demonstrators.
   There were no immediate reports of arrests or injuries.
   Dissidents were protesting the police storming of the Hyundai
Heavy Industries Shipyard in the city of Ulsan, about 150 miles
southeast of Seoul, to end strikes that have crippled the yard for
three months.
   Thousands of other students rioted in sympathy at college
campuses in seven cities. They students command little support
among rank-and-filed South Koreans.
   Earlier reports said authorities had ended the strike to demand
Hyundai recognize a workers' union and increase wages.
   However, Hyundai officials said today more than a quarter of the
plant's 19,500 workers are either striking or sympathizing with the
strike. A newspaper said more workers had joined in other company
subsidiaries.
   Lee Yong-jun, the vice minister of labor, and National Police
director-general Cho Chung-suk flew from Seoul to Ulsan by
helicopter today to discuss the labor violence.

   The man accused of strangling a pregnant
pathologist at a New York City hospital says he felt no sympathy
for the doctor.
   Steven Smith, 23, said in three recent telephone interviews with
The State newspaper that Dr. Kathryn Hinnant's slaying Jan. 7
received an inordinate amount of media attention because she was
white and middle class.
   The interviews were conducted while Smith, who is black and used
to sleep in a storage area at Bellevue Hospital, was in the Rikers
Island prison and at a pretrial holding facility, the newspaper
reported today. He has since been transferred to a psychiatric unit
in Brooklyn.
   Hinnant, a 33-year-old native of Lake City, was beaten, raped,
strangled and robbed. Smith was arrested Jan. 9. He said he robbed
the doctor but maintains he is innocent of the other charges.
   When asked if he sympathized with Hinnant, who was five months
pregnant, Smith sharply responded that he did not and began
speaking of his slain sister.
   ``It ain't nothing new to me,'' said Smith, who said he had sold
crack and robbed people since he was 16. ``When my sister died, she
wasn't even in the news.''
   His sister, Diane Eunice Flowers, was shot to death at her New
London, Conn., home in 1980, when Smith was 16. Police said it was
an accident.
   A New York judge is considering whether statements Smith gave to
police are admissible in court, and prosecutors are awaiting
results of a genetic test that could link Smith to the sexual
assault.

<HEAD>Court to Hear Child Protection, Parental Rights Dispute in Maryland
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether a Maryland mother may be jailed for refusing to reveal the
whereabouts of her son, who authorities fear may be dead.
   The justices said they will hear arguments by prosecutors who
say the need to protect abused children in such cases outweighs a
parent's constitutional right against self-incrimination.
   The court also granted an appeal filed in behalf of the woman's
son.
   The case dates back to Jan. 23, 1987, when Jacqueline
Bouknight's three-month-old son Maurice was admitted to a Baltimore
hospital with a broken leg and other partially healed fractures.
   Suspecting the infant had been abused, Baltimore social workers
put Maurice in foster care and later obtained a court order giving
the city protective custody of him.
   City officials also said Ms. Bouknight suffered from emotional
problems and had been observed throwing Maurice into his crib
during the infant's hospitalization. Ms. Bouknight did not dispute
the city's assertions.
   Maurice was returned to Ms. Bouknight's custody on July 17,
1987, after she agreed not to punish him physically and to undergo
training in acquiring parenting skills.
   But nine months later, the social workers said Ms. Bouknight no
longer was cooperating with them. They said Maurice's father
recently had been shot to death, and that Ms. Bouknight was using
drugs.
   They also said they feared Maurice might be dead.
   Ms. Bouknight was held in contempt by a judge on April 28, 1988,
after she refused to disclose Maurice's whereabouts. The day before
she told the judge the boy was with her sister in Texas, but the
sister said she had not seen Maurice.
   The judge ordered Ms. Bouknight jailed until she revealed where
her son is.
   The Maryland Court of Appeals, by a 5-2 vote last Dec. 19, ruled
that jailing Ms. Bouknight for refusing to disclose information
about her son's whereabouts violated her constitutional protection
against self-incrimination.
   The state court said, ``In these circumstances, if the
information discloses that Maurice is now dead, or has been subject
to criminal abuse, as the prosecution candidly fears, suspicion
concededly would focus on Bouknight as the criminal agent.
   ``By disclosing the demanded information, therefore, Bouknight
would, in the event a crime had been committed upon Maurice's
person, be incriminating herself.''
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist set aside the state court
decision pending further review of the case by the full Supreme
Court. He thus reinstated the contempt citation and the indefinite
jailing of Ms. Bouknight.
   In any event, prosecutors said she was behind bars on
independent grounds _ a theft conviction that resulted in an
18-month jail sentence.
   Advocates for Children and Youth in Baltimore joined Maryland
officials in urging the justices to reverse the state court's
ruling that Ms. Bouknight's constitutional rights were violated.
   The children's rights organization said the state court ruling
could tie the hands of juvenile courts in protecting neglected and
abused children.
   The cases are Baltimore Department of Social Services vs.
Bouknight, 88-1182, and Maurice M. vs. Bouknight, 88-6651.

   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that dismissed
the Helmsleys' challenge to the 47-count indictment.
   Today's action comes less than a week after the high court, in
an unrelated case, limited the right of criminal defendants to
challenge indictments before trial.
   The justices on March 28 ruled that federal criminal defendants
who fail to persuade a judge to throw out their indictments because
of alleged misconduct by prosecutors cannot appeal before they are
tried and convicted.
   The Helmsleys' appeal raised the same issue.
   They were indicted with two hotel executives a year ago on
charges they evaded some $1.2 million in federal taxes over a
three-year period.
   The Helmsleys said the indictment should be thrown out because
of pre-indictment publicity generated by federal prosecutors.
   On numerous occasions, the Helmsleys contended, unnamed law
enforcement officials were quoted in news articles making accusing
and unflattering comments about the hotel owners.
   For example, one newspaper article that appeared two weeks
before the indictment quoted an anonymous investigator as saying
``people were waiting in line to testify against'' Mrs. Helmsley.
   A federal judge who refused to throw out the indictment said
there was no persuasive evidence that the grand jury was influenced
by the news coverage.
   The case is Helmsley vs. U.S., 88-732.

   The Supreme Court today refused to scuttle the
Iran-Contra trial of Oliver North or block the trials of two of his
co-defendants.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments aimed at
dismissing the case because of testimony the defendants gave to a
congressional committee.
   Today's action comes less than a week after the high court
limited the right of criminal defendants to challenge indictments
before trial.
   The justices on March 28 ruled that federal criminal defendants
who fail to persuade a judge to throw out their indictments because
of alleged misconduct by prosecutors cannot appeal before they are
tried and convicted.
   In the Iran-Contra case, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here
rejected on Sept. 30 an attempt to stop the Iran-Contra prosecution.
   The appeals court said it was premature to consider arguments
that the defendants' congressional testimony had been used
illegally to indict them. The appeals court said it would study the
issue only if there are convictions in the case.
   North, a former National Security Council aide, is currently on
trial. Separate trials are planned for his co-defendants.
   Those defendants are former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter and arms dealer Albert Hakim. They are to be tried
separately at a later date.
   A fourth defendant in the Iran-Contra prosecution, retired Air
Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, was not involved in the appeal
acted on today.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell on Jan. 13 dismissed major
charges against North after independent counsel Lawrence Walsh and
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said a trial on those charges
could jeopardize national security.
   The dismissed charges included allegations that North diverted
more than $14 million from the sales of U.S. arms to Iran to the
Nicaraguan rebels, or Contras.
   The remaining charges against North include that he concealed
from Congress and former Attorney General Edwin Meese III his
efforts on behalf of the Contras.
   North, Poindexter and Hakim said grand jurors and grand jury
witnesses were exposed to the highly publicized congressional
testimony the defendants had given under a limited grant of
immunity from prosecution.
   The defendants had been guaranteed that their congressional
testimony would not be used against them in the criminal
prosecution.
   Gesell has ruled that the issue of whether any so-called
``tainted'' congressional testimony was used to indict the
defendants can be decided after any possible convictions in the
case.
   The appeals court here agreed.
   The defendants said the only way to protect their rights was for
the courts to decide before trial if tainted testimony contributed
to their indictments.
   The case is Poindexter vs. U.S., 88-888.

<HEAD>Two Hungarian Physicists Claim They Produced Controlled Nuclear Fusion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Hungarian physicists replicated an
experiment first done in Utah to produce controlled nuclear fusion
using basic chemistry, the official MTI news agency reported today.
   Gyula Csikai and Tibor Sztaricskai from the experimental physics
department of Lajos Kossuth University in Debrecen, eastern
Hungary, succeeded in reproducing the experiment on Thursday, MTI
said.
   They produced an electrolysis in ``heavy water'' _ water that
includes an isotope of hydrogen _ between platinum and palladium
electrodes and were able to register nuclear fusion by neutron
counters, the agency said.
   Fusion occurs when the nucleus, or core, of one hydrogen atom
fuses with the nucleus of another hydrogen atom, creating heat.
    ``This result was reinforced by subsequent control tests,'' the
agency said.
   The report on the experiment was confirmed today by Istvan
Palfy, rector of Kossuth University.
   B. Stanley Pons, chairman of the University of Utah's chemistry
department, and Martin Fleischmann of Southhampton University in
England claimed the breakthrough in nuclear fusion March 24. They
predicted the development could lead to a technology capable of
driving electrical generators.
   Other nuclear scientists said the experiment would have to be
duplicated independently before the findings of Pons and
Fleischmann could be accepted.
   Nuclear fusion, the power that fuels the sun, is regarded as
science's next great frontier in developing new sources of energy
but has generally been considered to be years away from commercial
exploitation.
   It differs from conventional processes in that it fuses atoms,
rather than splits them, and generates little radioactive waste.
But standard fusion experiments have required extremely high
temperatures for the reaction to occur.
   MTI said the departmentplans to conduct further experiments ``to
trace the exact mechanism of the process taking place in palladium,
which may finally make the practical application of nuclear fusion
possible.''

<HEAD>Court Accepts Contractor-Severence Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether defense contractors violate a federal conflict-of-interest
law when paying severance to employees who quit to take important
government jobs.
   The court said it will hear appeals by the Boeing Co. and five
former employees who received $485,000 in severance when they left
to take jobs in the Reagan administration.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last May ordered either
Boeing or the former employees to turn the severance payments over
to the government.
   The appeals court said Boeing paid the money to the employees to
compensate them for taking lower-paying government jobs.
   Such payments create at least the appearance of a conflict of
interest, the appeals court said.
   ``We hold that payments made to future federal employees before
they begin government service can violate (federal
conflict-of-interest law) if they are made with compensatory
intent,'' the appeals court said.
   Government lawyers urged the Supreme Court to reject the appeals
by Boeing and the five former employees.
   The government said the severance payments ``were classic
violations'' of federal law because ``they were intended to
encourage the recipients to accept (the government) positions and
they were calculated to supplement the recipients' federal salaries
by making up the difference between their government pay and their
higher pay with Boeing.''
   The five are Thomas K. Jones, who received $132,000 from Boeing
before he became deputy under-secretary of defense for strategic
and theater nuclear forces in 1981; Herbert A. Reynolds, $80,000,
deputy director of space and intelligence policy in 1981; Melvin R.
Paisley, $183,000, assistant secretary of the Navy for research,
engineering and systems in 1981; Lawrence H. Crandon, $40,000, a
computer scientist for the NATO air command and control systems in
1982; and Harold Kitson, $50,000, deputy assistant secretary of the
Navy for command, communications and control intelligence in 1982.
   The former employees, in the appeal acted on today, said they
were not responsible for Pentagon contracting or procurement, and
said they had exemplary records with the government.
   They argued there was no question of divided loyalties for any
of them because each ``received an irrevocable severance payment
... before he entered into government service.''
   The cases are Crandon vs. U.S., 88-931; Boeing vs. U.S., 88-938.

<TEXT>
   A mother who put her 3-year-old daughter
out of her car along a highway and drove on to California, striking
nine vehicles on the way, has been hospitalized for psychiatric
evaluation.
   Kimberley Mae Owuor, 30, of Topeka, Kan., was hospitalized near
Malibu, Calif., where she was arrested Saturday night, sheriff's
Detective Trevan Woolbright said.
   Her daughter, Elizabeth or ``Buffy,'' was found wandering
barefoot and confused along Interstate 40 about 40 miles west of
Flagstaff on Wednesday. Broadcast of her picture on a Fort Worth,
Texas, television station led to her being identified Friday as the
daughter of George Owuor of Arlington and his ex-wife.
   George Owuor, 29, a native of Kenya, talked to the girl by
telephone in Flagstaff on Friday and is attempting to retrieve her
from child protective services' care. But Woolbright said Mrs.
Owuor has had legal custody of the child since the couple's divorce.
   According to Buffy and the motorist who rescued her, the girl
was abandoned by her mother, Woolbright said. The witness saw the
driver of the car in front of him put the child out and drive off,
he said.
   ``She (Buffy) said Mommy screamed at her and told her to hit the
streets. She stopped the car and told her to get out,'' Woolbright
said.
   Mrs. Owuor faces charges in California in connection with nine
hit-and-run accidents in three different areas.
   ``She was apparently playing bumper cars on the freeway,''
Woolbright said.
   He said the county attorney had not yet reviewed possible
charges in Arizona.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Allows Police Drug Tests in New Jersey Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
that city police officers may be required to undergo random drug
tests and tests that are part of annual physical examinations.
   The justices, without comment, turned away arguments in behalf
of Washington Township, N.J., police officers.
   The high court last month handed down its first drug-testing
decisions _ upholding drug and alcohol tests for railway workers
involved in accidents and U.S. Customs Service employees applying
for drug enforcement jobs or those jobs that require carrying a
firearm.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, dismissing claims the
Washington Township tests violate privacy rights, ruled last June
that police officers are part of a ``highly regulated industry''
subject to such searches even if drug abuse is not suspected.
   The appeals court noted that rules specify what police may wear,
how they may cut their hair and when they may smoke.
   The 3rd Circuit court previously approved random drug tests for
jockeys because they are part of a highly regulated industry.
   ``The police industry is probably the most highly regulated,
with respect to performance of its employees, of any industry in
New Jersey,'' the appeals court said.
   It added that police officers exercise ``the most awesome and
dangerous power that a democratic state possesses with respect to
its residents _ the power to use lawful force to arrest and detain
them.''
   In their decisions last week, the justices did not decide the
constitutionality of random drug tests for public employees.
   Washington Township, a small suburb of Philadelphia, adopted
drug testing for municipal workers in November 1986 in response to
a call from President Reagan for a campaign to assure drug-free
workplaces.
   Mayor John Robertson said, ``I firmly believe that as employees
of the taxpayers we have an obligation to show the way toward
achieving a drug-free workplace.''
   The Policemen's Benevolent Association, with support from the
American Civil Liberties Union, said the tests infringe on
constitutional protections against unlawful searches and seizures.
   A federal judge agreed, ruling that tests are permissible only
when there is ``an individualized, reasonable suspicion'' an
officer is using drugs.
   But the 3rd Circuit court reversed that ruling.
   In appealing to the Supreme Court, the police union said there
have been no problems with drugs among municipal employees. The
tests are an improper response to public concern, the union said.
   ``Heightened public attention to the law enforcement problems
created by illegal drug trafficking has engendered powerful
pressures to weaken the constitutional protections long afforded to
all citizens,'' the union said.
   In another case, the court, without comment, let stand the
firing of James B. Copeland as a Philadelphia police officer.
   Copeland tested positive for mariujuana or hashish after his
former girlfriend, also a police officer, told his superiors he
used drugs.
   The cases are Policemen's Benevolent Association vs. Washington
Township, 88-706, and Copeland vs. Philadelphia Police Department,
88-66.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact a ruling
that permits widespread drug testing of workers in the nuclear
power industry.
   The court, without comment, turned away an appeal by workers
applying for jobs with a company that does maintenance work on a
nuclear plant in Washington state.
   The justices last month handed down their first drug-testing
decisions _ upholding drug and alcohol tests for railway workers
involved in accidents and for U.S. Customs Service employees
applying for drug enforcement jobs or jobs that require carrying a
firearm.
   The Washington Supreme Court last July upheld a mandatory
urine-testing program for applicants at Bechtel Construction Inc.
The company does repair and maintenance work during nuclear plant
shutdowns for the Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS).
   A group of plumbers, pipefitters and welders said the tests
violate privacy safeguards in the state and federal Constitutions.
   The state court threw out the state constitutional claim on
grounds it is pre-empted by federal law regulating nuclear power
plants.
   The state court also said that the tests do not violate the
federal Constitution because the nuclear industry is so heavily
regulated, and that those working in the industry have a reduced
expectationof privacy.
   ``The lingering effects of drug abuse can impair one's physical
and mental capacity, and such impairment can have catastrophic
consequences in the setting of a nuclear power facility,'' the
state court said.
   It added that testing applicants for such jobs is the only
opportunity the employer will have to determine whether a
prospective worker is using drugs. Unlike workers already on the
job, there is no opportunity to observe a job applicant, the state
court said.
   WPPSS does not test those already employed, unless there is
reason to suspect a worker is using drugs.
   ``Routine drug testing in the context of pre-employment
screening is virtually the only way in which the operators of the
WPPSS facility can effectively monitor compliance'' with rules
against drug use, the state court said.
   It noted that those who test positive are not prosecuted for
drug use and may reapply for employment six months later.
   ``There is no permanent stain on an applicant's record,'' the
state court said.
   The case is Alverado vs. WPPSS, 88-645.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril went on
national television early today to announce that forces loyal to
his government thwarted a coup attempt by power-hungry soldiers.
   There were indications the attempt to overthrow Avril may have
been related to his vow to crack down on officers involved in drug
smuggling.
   The international airport remained closed early today and
soldiers patrolled Port-au-Prince streets, now quiet, that had
echoed with gunfire 24 hours earlier.
   Avril, who assumed power in a coup six months ago, was
reportedly seized at his suburban home early Sunday and rescued by
loyal soldiers as he was being driven to the airport to be deported.
   ``Some members of the armed forces, blinded by their exorbitant
ambitions, attempted to overthrow the government,'' Avril said in a
10-minute speech on state-run television.
   ``I appeal to the nation to cooperate with us in peace and unity
for the realization of our democratic objectives,'' he added.
   Avril gave no details of the attempted coup, but said, ``I have
faith in the army.'' There were no reports of casualties.
   He was flanked by a dozen soldiers, including Sgt. Major Joseph
Heubreux, who led the September revolt by non-commissioned officers
that put Avril in power after ousting a regime blamed for
widespread human rights abuses.
   ``Today's events have shown that the establishment of democracy
in Haiti under the present circumstances is a long and arduous
task,'' said Avril, who has promised presidential elections this
year and other reforms.
   Loyalists in tanks thwarted Sunday's coup attempt by rescuing a
handcuffed Avril as he was being driven by rebel officers to the
airport to be flown out of Haiti, according to presidential
guardsmen and a U.S. Embassy official.
   A government communique said that in the early hours of the coup
attempt ``certain officers besieged'' the presidential palace ``and
attempted to overthrow the government.''
   Last week, Avril fired four senior army officers for alleged
drug trafficking and promised the crackdown would bring more purges
in the military.
   Richard Melton, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for
Caribbean affairs, had told Avril that resumption of $70 million in
U.S. aid depended partly on efforts to curb the drug trade.
   An army officer, Col. Jean-Claude Paul, was indicted by a Miami
grand jury on drug smuggling charges last year but died in October
after eating soup that officials said was poisoned.
   U.S. officials began to talk of restoring the funds after the
50-year-old Avril came to power Sept. 17, 1988 in the coup that
ousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy. Namphy had ruled the country for most
of the 2{ years after Jean-Claude Duvalier was deposed in a 1986
popular uprising that ended three decades of Duvalier family rule.
   Details on Sunday's events were sketchy and sometimes conflicted.
   Presidential guardsmen said Avril was taken captive early Sunday
at his mansion in Canape Verte, a wealthy neighborhood in the hills
overlooking Port-au-Prince after he returned home from a party.
   They said Avril's wife, Marie-Ange, and her mother were taken
captive with Avril but released a few hours later.
   Loyal soldiers said one of Avril's sons, two of his brothers,
and Interior Minister Col. Acedius St. Louis and his son were also
seized by the rebels. They were reportedly freed Sunday night after
loyalists in two tanks rolled into the Leopards commando
battalion's encampment outside the capital.
   U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Susan Clyde said reports indicated the
coup attempt began at about 4:30 a.m. Sunday and that Avril was
detained for a time. Unconfirmed reports said four army officers
planned the coup, including Gen. Guy Francois, commander of the
powerful Dessalines barracks. The unit's fortress next to the
National Palace houses the most feared fighters in Haiti's
7,000-man army.
   The reports said the four officers were detained.
   Military sources confirmed that one officer identified as a
leader, Lt. Col. Himmler Rebu, was under military guard at the
National Palace. Rebu commanded the Leopards battalion.
   The sources said coup leaders asked army commander Maj. Gen.
Herard Abraham to assume the presidency and the plot collapsed when
he refused.
   Although Avril has promised elections this year and restored
some suspended constitutional rights two weeks ago, critics say he
is moving too slowly toward democratic reforms.
   ``The only way for Haiti to stop having coups is for it to have
a legitimate, constitutionally elected civilian government,'' said
Louis Dejoie Jr., a moderate politician with presidential
aspirations.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today turned away a dispute
over the confidentiality of lawyers' documents in a case stemming
from a defense contractor's fraudulent travel reimbursement scheme.
   The court, without comment, refused to hear appeals by Martin
Marietta Corp. and a former employee who said the company is trying
to make him the scapegoat for the scheme.
   Martin Marietta, based in Bethesda, Md., pleaded guilty in 1987
to mail fraud and furnishing the government with a false statement.
The company was fined $12,000 and ordered to repay $250,000 the
government spent investigating the case.
   Martin Marietta also paid the government more than $4.3 million
in a separate non-criminal settlement with the Pentagon's
procurement arm, the Defense Logistics Agency.
   Federal investigators said a Martin Marietta subsidiary and a
travel agency it hired billed the government for the full price of
air fare when Martin Marietta employees traveled in connection with
Pentagon contracts.
   The investigators said the employees actually used discount
fares and received rebates that Martin Marietta kept for itself.
   While under investigation, Martin Marietta's lawyers turned over
various documents to federal prosecutors in an attempt to persuade
the government not to seek an indictment.
   The case acted on today involves an effort by indicted former
Martin Marietta employee William Pollard to obtain those records.
   Pollard headed a subsidiary the company set up to handle travel
arrangements for its workers.
   He was indicted on April 7, 1987, by a federal grand jury in
Baltimore on fraud charges.
   Pollard said he sought the records of the company lawyers to
help him prove that Martin Marietta is trying to make him the
scapegoat for the travel-rebate scheme.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last September ruled
partly in his favor and partly for the company.
   The appeals court ordered Martin Marietta to turn over a
substantial portion of the documents, including internal audits and
lawyers' memos. The appeals court said the usual secrecy protection
for exchanges between lawyers and clients was surrendered when the
Martin Marietta attorneys agreed to provide the documents to
federal prosecutors.
   But the appeals court said Pollard is not entitled to see
material in those memos and related documents in which lawyers
discuss theories of the case or give their impressions of such
matters as the credibility of witnesses.
   ``What should not be ordered to be disclosed (to Pollard) are
pure expressions of legal theory or metal impressions,'' the
appeals court said.
   Martin Marietta asked the Supreme Court to bar Pollard from
seeing any of the lawyers' memos.
   The company was supported by the American Bar Association, which
said the 4th Circuit court ruling compromises lawyer-client
confidentiality and jeopardizes efforts by suspects' lawyers to
cooperate with the government.
   Pollard, in a separate appeal, asked the high court to let him
see the uncensored versions of the memos, including the opinions
and impressions of the attorneys.
   The cases are Martin Marietta vs. Pollard, 88-1157, and Pollard
vs. Martin Marietta, 88-1338.

<HEAD>Justices Rule Texas Policy Doesn't Discriminate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today ruled that a Texas
school board's policy does not violate the voting rights of
Hispanics.
   The court, by a 7-2 vote, upheld a policy limiting the power of
a single board member to place an item on the agenda for board
meetings.
   Justices Byron R. White and Antonin Scalia dissented, saying the
court should hear oral arguments in the case before deciding it.
   The school board in Victoria, Texas, has seven members. Since
1984, five board members have been elected from single-member
districts and two in at-large voting.
   Theresa Gutierrez became the first and only Mexican-American
elected to the school board in 1985. She represents a district with
a 51.4 percent Hispanic population and a 14 percent black
population.
   The school board in 1987 changed its policy for placing items on
meeting agendas. The new policy says the school board president may
require the approval of two board members _ also called trustees _
before an item can be added to the agenda for an upcoming meeting.
   Mrs. Gutierrez and others in her district said the new policy
affects the rights of voters she represents by reducing her power
to recommend agenda items.
   She said the federal Voting Rights Act requires that the U.S.
attorney general approve the policy before it can be implemented.
   But a three-judge federal court last year ruled against Ms.
Gutierrez and her constitutents.
   The federal court said the new policy's ``effect on the powers
of the elected trustees was at most minuscule.''
   The three-judge court compared the policy to the standard
parliamentary procedure that requires someone to second any motion
or resolution before it can be submitted to a vote.
   ``It seems plain to us that if Mrs. Gutierrez is unable to
persuade even one other trustee to join her in placing a matter on
the board's agenda, she would have no better succeess in procuring
a second should she have moved it at a meeting,'' the federal court
said.
   Also, the federal court said the policy ``in no way singles her
out for unfavorable procedural treatment.''
   The case is Rojas vs. Victoria Independent School District,
87-2118.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Revive Lawsuit by Penthouse Against Atlantic City
Casino</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to revive a
lawsuit by Penthouse International stemming from its failure to get
financing for an Atlantic City, N.J., casino.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw out a
$128.7 million judgment Penthouse won against a Virginia savings
and loan company and a Washington law firm.
   The court also rejected a related appeal by the savings and loan
company.
   Penthouse and its president, Robert Guccione, had invested some
$70 million in the proposed hotel and casino by June 1983 when the
company decided to seek outside financing to complete the project.
   Dominion Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association of McLean, Va.,
agreed to provide $35 million as part of a lending syndicate.
Dominion Federal retained the Washington law firm of Melrod, Redman
&amp; Gartlan to represent it in the negotiations.
   The savings and loan association pulled out of the deal in 1984,
and Penthouse then filed a federal suit in New York City accusing
the lending institution and the law firm of illegally breaking a
contract.
   A federal judge ruled for Penthouse, awarding it $128.7 million
in anticipated lost profits from the casino. The judge also ordered
Dominion Federal to pay another $7.7 million to Queen City Savings
&amp; Loan Association, which tried to arrange the casino financing.
   Both awards were thrown out last August by the 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
   The appeals court said Dominion Federal and its law firm did not
act illegally in backing out of the deal.
   The appeals court also threw out a counterclaim by Dominion
Federal against Queen City.
   In the appeal acted on today, Penthouse lawyers said the appeals
court ruling ``fashions a rule of law for commercial transactions
completely at odds with the law of the state of New Jersey, which
the court had a duty to apply in this case.''
   The cases are Penthouse vs. Dominion Federal, 88-1144, and
Dominion Federal vs. Penthouse, 88-1339.

<HEAD>Court Turns Back Challenge to Conviction of Fortas' Friend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today turned away an appeal
by financier Louis Wolfson, a key figure in the scandal-marred
ending of the late Abe Fortas' career on the nation's highest court.
   The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that Wolfson
properly was convicted in 1967 of selling unregistered securities.
   Wolfson's appeal had sought to have his conviction overturned,
arguing that only expansive judicial interpretations of federal
securities law rendered his conduct illegal.
   Fortas, a brilliant Washington lawyer appointed to the Supreme
Court in 1965, resigned in 1969 following a disclosure that he had
agreed to accept a $20,000 annual fee from a foundation headed by
Wolfson.
   Fortas served as one of President Johnson's closest advisers
before, and at times after, his appointment to the nation's highest
court.
   During his court tenure, he was a staunch member of the liberal
wing headed by then-Chief Justice Earl Warren.
   Although denying any wrongdoing in accepting the Wolfson-led
foundation's fee, Fortas resigned under the threat of impeachment.
   He conceded that the fee was intended to be the first of a
series of annual $20,000 payments for the rest of his life _ and,
in the event of his death, for the life of his wife _ for
``continuing services'' to the foundation.
   At the time of the disclosure, Wolfson was serving a one-year
prison sentence on the securities law conviction.
   The case is Wolfson vs. U.S., 88-1422.

<HEAD>Reconsideration of Ruling Ordered in District of Columbia Drug-Testing
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today ordered
reconsideration of a ruling that allows District of Columbia
officials to require drug testing for employees involved in the
busing of handicapped students.
   The justices said a federal appeals court should re-examine the
case in light of their rulings last month on mandatory drug tests.
   The justices on March 21 announced their first drug-testing
decisions _ upholding drug and alcohol tests for railway workers
involved in accidents and U.S. Customs Service employees applying
for drug enforcement jobs or those jobs that require carrying a
firearm.
   The District of Columbia case stems from the firing _ and later
reinstatement _ of Juanita M. Jones, an attendant on a bus used to
transport handicapped students between their homes and schools.
   Ms. Jones was fired after testing positive for marijuana, and
was ordered reinstated by a federal judge who said she could not be
fired on the basis of the drug test conducted by the city because
of its questionable reliability in determining on-the-job drug use.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled in 1987 that the
city government generally may require workers in such jobs to
undergo routine testing for drugs because they are responsibile for
the safety of schoolchildren.
   But the appeals court ruling did not alter the judge's decision
reinstating Ms. Jones. That sparked a Supreme Court appeal by
school district officials.
   Justice John Paul Stevens dissented from the high court's order
today. He said the school district's appeal should be turned down.
   The case is McKenzie vs. Jones, 87-1706.

Court action.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The former head of the Marine Corps testified
today that he reluctantly extended Oliver North's tour at the
National Security Council after high administration officials
persuaded him that North's work was too important for him to leave.
   Former Marine Corps Commander Paul X. Kelley testified at
North's trial that in spring 1984 ``there were a number of people''
who intervened in the North matter, including CIA Director William
Casey and United Nations Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick. They urged
that North be permitted to remain at the NSC.
   Also today, the Supreme Court refused to scuttle North's
Iran-Contra trial or block the trials of two of his co-defendants.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments aimed at
dismissing the case because of testimony the defendants gave to a
congressional committee.
   Contacts with Casey and Kirkpatrick followed a plea from Robert
McFarlane, then National Security Council adviser, that North was
engaged in ``extremely important work'' and should stay on, said
Kelley.
   The former Marine commandant said he was concerned that a delay
in returning to the corps would hurt North's military career, but
he acquisced to the request.
   While Kelley was on the witness stand, prosecutor John Keker
presented a series of messages between North and McFarlane showing
that North did not want to return to the Marine Corps base at Camp
Lejeune to command a battalion.
   A major private contributor to the Contra cause, Mrs. Ellen
Garwood, testified that North never asked her for money and that at
no time did she make out a check in his presence. She said that a
$75,000 check she wrote to a fund-raising organization was drafted
after she left a briefing by North in his office.
   ``He said, `this is a desperate situation for the freedom
fighters. I'm not asking you for money. As a member of the
government and the National Security Council I cannot ask for
money','' said Mrs. Garwood, an Austin, Texas, heiress who has said
previously that her contributions to the Contra cause totaled $2.2
million.
   On Sept. 12, 1985, Mrs. Garwood said, she wrote out a check for
$32,000 after a briefing from North at a Dallas airport.
   ``While Colonel North was present, did (fund raiser Carl)
Channell ask you for money that night?'' asked defense counsel
Brendan Sullivan.
   ``No, he never did that,'' she said. ``Colonel North wouldn't
have allowed it.''
   Kelley became the first witness for the defense, following a
six-week presentation by the prosecution, which formally concluded
its case today.
   Kelley said that in February 1985 McFarlane asked in a breakfast
meeting McFarlane had requested that North's NSC tour be extended
again.
   ``I was not favorably disposed'' to grant the extension, but
again did so, said Kelley.
   By February 1985, North was deeply involved in a secret effort
to ship arms to the Contras. Congress had banned military aid to
the Nicaraguan rebels as of October 1984.
   A third request to extend North's tour came in the spring of
1986 and was granted through the ``normal channels,'' said Kelley.
   North had sought to call President Reagan as his first witness,
but the judge in the case said Friday there was not any evidence to
bolster a claim that Reagan had authorized North to commit illegal
activities.
   North lawyer Barry Simon jumped Friday on the prosecution's weak
points, citing uncertainty by McFarlane about whether North wrote a
key draft of a letter to Congress.
   The September 1985 letter to then-U.S. Rep. Michael Barnes
denied North was assisting the Contras and resulted in a charge
against him of making false statements to Congress.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell reserved the right to set
aside a verdict on another charge on grounds the alleged crime
might not have been committed in Washington, D.C., but rather in
adjacent Virginia.
   The charge accuses North of accepting a security system free of
charge from co-defendant Richard Secord, whom North had enlisted to
run arms to the Contras.
   Proving the charge is complicated by the testimony of former CIA
employee Glenn Robinette, who testified he sent backdated bills to
North demanding payment for the security system without being
asked. Robinette said he engaged in a cover-up after getting a
phone call from North pointing out that he hadn't sent him a bill.
   Robinette had been paid months before by Secord and North didn't
contact Robinette about the matter until a week or so after being
fired from his National Security Council staff job in the
Iran-Contra affair. The attorney general had announced when North
was fired that a criminal investigation would be conducted.
   At Friday's hearing, the judge mused whether Robinette was on
``a frolic of his own or CIA bias or what'' when he launched a
cover-up without being specifically asked to do so.
   Gesell dashed North's hopes that he could call Reagan as a
witness in an attempt to bolster the defense's central contention,
that if North told lies, he was authorized to do so.

   A prairie fire burning out of control for five

China, the official Xinhua News Agency said Monday.
   The blaze destroyed 24,700 acres of grassland and jumped a fire
belt cleared by firefighters, the report said.
   Officials have called in 1,500 people, including forest guards,
soldiers and residents, to battle the blaze, Xinhua said.
Reinforcements were being called in.
   No casualties were reported.
   The fire occurred in a southern section of the Daxinganling
mountain region, which also suffered a devastating forest fire in
1986. That fire burned for a month and killed 193 people.

   Lt. Col. Robert Earl, rebuffed by the Senate
for promotion last year because of questions about his role in the
Iran-Contra affair, failed this year to win nomination for
advancement from the Marine Corps, officials said Monday.
   Earl, 43, served as the deputy to Lt. Col. Oliver North on the
staff of the National Security Council from February 1986 to
January 1987. North is on trial in U.S. District Court here,
accused of concealing from Congress and former Attorney General
Edwin Meese III his efforts on behalf of the Nicaraguan Contra
guerillas.
   Earl, now a plans officer at the Marine Corps Combat Development
Command in Quantico, Va., has acknowledged that he was aware of the
diversion of profits from arms sales to Iran to support the
Contras, and said that he aided North in the destruction of records
after the affair became public.
   Last fall, a Marine Corps promotion board selected Earl for
advancement to the rank of colonel. The Senate Armed Services
Committee, however, took the unusual step of refusing the promotion
while allowing others on the Marine list to go forward.
   At the time, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman of the panel,
said he was troubled that the corps apparently had not considered
Earl's activities at the White House when it reviewed his military
record.
   Monday, Maj. Ron Stokes, a spokesman for the corps, said that a
list of 130 Marine lieutenant colonels selected for advancement to
colonel had been sent to the Senate two weeks ago and that Earl's
name was not on the list.
   The spokesman said Navy Secretary William L. Ball III had
ordered a special three-member board of generals to study the
matter after the Senate panel's rebuff last year. The generals
later submitted a report recommending that certain Iran-Contra
activities by Earl be included in his military personnel records,
the spokesman continued.
   ``Secretary Ball approved, and Lt. Col. Earl then had an
opportunity to review the report and respond in writing to the
recommendations, which he did,'' said Stokes.
   ``Then the whole package was sent to the selection board. But he
wasn't selected by this board, that's true.''
   Earl testified last week at North's trial under a grant of
immunity, which he received in exchange for the testimony he had
given Congress. Earl said through a spokesman that he would not
comment on the promotion board's decision.
   Earl, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, is a 22-year Marine
Corps veteran. He is not required to retire and remains eligible
for promotion each year. His rejection by the board this year,
however, reduces his chances for next year.
   Besides Earl, the Senate last year also rebuffed the selection
of Army Col. James Steele to become a brigadier general. Steele is
the former head of the U.S. Military Assistance Group in El
Salvador and played a role in the secret Contra resupply operation.
   The Army has not decided whether to again recommend Steele for
promotion, Lt. Col. Greg Rixon, a spokesman, said Monday.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is seeking House and
Senate co-sponsors for a $422 million education bill containing the
president's proposals for merit schools, magnet schools and other
education programs.
   The Educational Excellence Act of 1989 is scheduled for
introduction Wednesday by Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., and Rep.
Bill Goodling, R-Pa., according to a sponsor-recruitment letter
circulating on Capitol Hill.
   The programs in the bill are the same ones President Bush
proposed in his budget message to Congress. Administration
officials have said they don't know whether the new spending would
be offset by cuts in other education programs or added to the
Education Department budget submitted by then-President Reagan.
   The bulk of the money in the Bush bill, $250 million, would go
for a ``Presidential Merit Schools'' program of cash awards to
public and private elementary schools that have made substantial
progress in raising student educational achievement, creating a
safe and drug-free environment, and reducing the dropout rate.
   Another $100 million would create a new ``magnet schools of
excellence'' program to set up or enhance magnet schools to
strengthen academic and vocational offerings as well as promote
open enrollment and parental choice. Bush's program would be
separate from an existing magnet schools program designed to
achieve desegregation.
   Bush is also proposing $25 million apiece for programs of
emergency grants to urban schools with the nation's most severe
drug problems and grants to states to develop alternative ways to
certify teachers and principals.
   He is seeking $10 million to use as challenge grants for
endowments at historically black colleges and universities and $7.6
million for ``president's awards for excellence in education'' to
outstanding teachers. Another $5 million would go for scholarships
to high school seniors with top grades in science and math under a
``national science scholars program.''
   In a draft message to Congress, circulating along with the bill,
Bush said the plan rewards excellence; directs federal dollars to
those most in need; gives parents and school systems greater
flexibility and choice; and increases accountability by measuring
and rewarding progress toward quality education.
   Congressional response to Bush's proposals has been mixed.
Several lawmakers, including House Education and Labor Committee
Chairman Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., have said the administration
plan gives short shrift to effective existing programs and have
offered alternative education spending blueprints of their own.

   A group identifying itself as the Animal
Liberation Front claimed responsibility for two early-morning arson
fires that caused an estimated $100,000 damage and may have
unleashed a potentially deadly disease.
   The group claimed in a letter sent to news organizations that it
freed more than 1,000 animals from three research facilities at the
University of Arizona and set fire to a diagnostic lab and a
converted house near the medical college campus.
   Charles Sterling, a professor of veterinary science, said 30
young mice infected with what he described as a Third World disease
were among those taken.
   The mice carry the disease cryptosporidium which Sterling said
cause severe diarrhea lasting two to four weeks. He says the mice
will overcome the disease in a week to 10 days but they and their
fecal matter are infectious until then.
   Sterling said the disease has been known to be fatal to AIDS
patients, other immuno-suppressed individuals and malnurished
children, and he said there is no known treatment for it.
   Fire Capt. Keith Richter said no one was injured in the fires,
one on the main campus and one near the medical campus. Two
laboratories were gutted and two others partially damaged and
classrooms were damaged in the first fire, he said.
   Richter said there was about $10,000 in damage to ceilings and
walls in a hallway area at the second site.
   He said the fires were intentionally set.
   The group's statement said 950 mice, 50 rats, 16 rabbits, 14
guinea pigs, 10 frogs and other animals were freed ``from certain
torture and death at the hands of U of A students and researchers.''
   Sharon Kha, director of public information for the university,
said researchers were being asked to inventory their animals. There
was no immediate comment as to how the animals were being used.
   Graffiti on walls and doors of one building included ``Nowhere
is Safe _ A.L.F,'' ``A.L.F. We Shall Return'' and ``Vivisection
Will End.''
   The group said the animals, ``many of whom were found with open
sores and wounds and dying from overdose injections of various
substances, are being placed in good homes around the country where
they will live free from the invasive curiosity of researchers and
vivisectionists.''
   It also claimed that arguments that animal research benefits
human health are ``blatant lies spread by the research industry to
protect itself from the truth. Animal research never has and never
will benefit human health'' because of radically different
physiological makeup from that of humans, it said.
   ``Concrete and steel doors will not stop us,'' the statement
said. ``We will be back and will keep coming back until all animal
torture at U of A is stopped.''

<TEXT>
   A lack of snow didn't stop Vermont from a
good ski season, it's third best, because resorts were able to rely
heavily on fake stuff.
   The Vermont Ski Areas Association estimates skier day visits at
4.2 million, down from 4.85 million last season.
   The best season on record was 1986-87, when 5.2 million skier
days were recorded.
   Business was good at some of the smaller resorts, which spent
considerable money on snowmaking and advertising before the season
began. Okemo Mountain, which advertises heavily in the New York
area, said business was up 3-5 percent.
   Resorts in the north also seemed to fare well, thanks to heavier
snowfall. Jay Peak reported a 16 percent increase in business and
Burke Mountain an 8 percent increase, the VSAA said.
   But Killington was down 4 percent and Mount Snow also reported a
drop in skier visits, said Candace Moot, VSAA associate director.
   ``Killington is a large percentage of the market, and Mount
Snow, too. They brought the statewide average down,'' she said.
   Business was also down at smaller, family-owned operations like
Cochran Ski Area in Richmond.
   ``People didn't think skiing,'' said co-owner Virginia Cochran,
whose area has 30 percent snowmaking. ``I also think it was a nice
winter to be outdoors. Kids could ride their bikes all winter or
play basketball in the driveway, or they could go hiking.''
   Many of the resorts will likely close this month. Ascutney
Mountain, Burke, Suicide Six, Maple Valley, Haystack and the
Middlebury College Snow Bowl have already closed, while Bromley and
Magic Mountains are only open on weekends.
   Killington, Mount Snow and Stratton normally try to stay open
through May.

   An expanded acreage of flue-cured and burley
tobacco could boost 1989 production significantly but reduced
carry-in stocks would mean a smaller total tobacco supply, the
Agriculture Department said Monday.
   Overall, tobacco acreage may be up about 13 percent this year to
about 713,000 acres, which chiefly reflects an 11 percent increase
in the effective quota for flue-cured and a 20 percent increase for
burley, the department's Economic Research Service said in a
preliminary report.
   ``If growers of flue-cured carry out their intention, acreage
would rise to 403,000 (acres), 10 percent above last year and 31
percent above 1986's record low of 308,000 acres,'' the report said.
   Average yields would mean about a 15 percent boost in 1989
tobacco output from last year's 1.35 billion pounds. However, the
report added, smaller carry-in stocks would reduce the domestic
tobacco supply for 1989-90 from the current season's level.
   Cigarette production last year rose about 1 percent to 695
billion ``pieces,'' the report said. Domestic use declined by about
2 percent as forecast previously, but exports rose significantly.
   The use of cigarettes by adult Americans 18 and older declined 3
percent last year to an average of 3,096 cigarettes, the report
said. The annual average by adults peaked at 4,345 cigarettes per
person in 1963 but generally has declined since then.
   ``Domestic cigarette consumption will probably continue to fall
this year because of higher prices, antismoking activity and
increased restrictions on where people may smoke,'' the report
said. ``Cigarette exports, on the other hand, are expected to rise
again this year.''

<HEAD>Housing Affordability Measure Down Sharply in February</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs first 2 grafs with Realtors' CORRECTION that drop was sharpest
in 15 years, instead of sharpest drop ever</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An index measuring the ability of the typical
American family to buy a home made its sharpest drop in 15 years
last month, as rising mortgage rates and home prices resulted in a
loss of purchasing power, a real estate trade group said Monday.
   The National Association of Realtors said its affordability
index was at 105 in February, down 5.1 index points from a revised
110.1 in January. It was the biggest month-to-month decline since
the measure dropped 5.2 index points from 137 to 131.8 in January
1974.
   February's index level meant that a family earning the median
income of $32,314 annually had 5 percent more income than needed to
qualify for a mortgage covering 80 percent of the purchase price of
a median-priced home.
   The median price for an existing home in February was $93,100,
meaning half the homes sold for more and half for less. February's
median price was up $3,400 from January.
   The mortgage rate used to calculate the index rose to 9.77
percent in February from 9.61 percent, representing a composite of
fixed and adjustable rates.
   John A. Tuccillo, chief economist for the Realtors, said the
index was likely to decline again in March, since mortgage rates
continued to increase, although prices and rates should level off
later this spring.
   The affordability index has been above 100 since it hit 99.8 in
May 1986.
   ``For nearly three years, housing affordability for the typical
buyer has been well above the break-even point,'' said Ira Gribin,
president of the Realtors group. ``But hikes in mortgage rates and
prices have made buying more difficult.''

<HEAD>Oil Tanker Runs Aground In Rhine, Spill Averted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WIESBADEN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salvage crews on Monday towed a
badly damaged oil tanker into port after it ran aground in the
Rhine River, and officials said any danger of a major oil spill was
over.
   Workers pumped about 42,000 gallons of fuel oil out of the
vessel Rhinetank 24 and towed it to Oppenheim harbor, where the
rest of the load was being pumped out, said the Hesse state Water
Protection Police.
   The ship was originally carrying about 300,000 gallons of fuel
oil.
   Officials had been worried the vessel could break apart because
of the strong Rhine currents and spill its cargo into the river,
but the police said that danger had passed now that the ship was in
the protected harbor.
   The vessel ran aground on an underwater stone wall near the city
of Oppenheim, about 25 miles southwest of Frankfurt, early Monday,
according to the Water Protection Police.
   The ship later dislodged from the wall but was badly damaged.
   Small amounts of fuel oil spilled into the Rhine, and shipping
was backed up for several hours as crews pumped oil out of the
crippled 300-foot tanker in preparation for towing it to port.
   Water protection authorities surrounded the stricken vessel with
oil containment booms and transferred some of the oil from the
damaged tanker to another ship, said Jochen Boehm, a spokesman for
the Water Protection Office in Mainz.
   He said one of the ship's 12 oil storage containers was damaged
and initially leaked small amounts of the ship's cargo, but that
the oil was quickly cleaned up by salvage crews.
   Boehm said he did not know the size of the leak or whether there
had been any environmental damage.
   More than 100 ships had to wait for several hours as workers
pumped oil out of the crippled tanker. The shipping lane at
Oppenheim was reopened in late afternoon.

<HEAD>Gata Kamsky Makes First Appearance Since Defection</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet chess prodigy Gata Kamsky said Monday
that he and his father defected to the United States because Soviet
chess officials had blocked his career for the last three years.
   ``I decided to leave the Soviet Union because I can't play in
chess tournaments, so I can't grow in chess. Here I can play in all
the tournaments every year,'' the 14-year-old Kamsky, speaking in
English, said at a crowded news conference at the Marshall Chess
Club in Greenwich Village.
   His father, Rustam Kamsky, reading from a statement in faltering
English, said: ``Now we get the freedom. My son can play in
different cities in all the world. Please help my wife.''
   Rustam said his wife, Bella, who is Gata's stepmother and
remains in Leningrad, knew in advance of their decision to request
asylum in the United States when they came here for a chess
tournament three weeks ago.
   ``Yes, they discussed it, all together as a family, and they
jointly came to this decision that they would stay here,'' said Lev
Albert, a grandmaster who defected from the Soviet Union in 1979
and translated for the Kamskys.
   Rustam Kamsky said discrimination against the family because
they were ethnic Crimean Tatars also had some bearing on their
decision.
   ``Tatars don't have their homeland. ... Moscow is like an
occupying power,'' he said. ``Organizers in the other republics are
able to support their players. But because there is no such thing
for the Tatars, they are in an underprivileged position compared
with other chess players.''
   As they fielded questions, the defectors fiddled with a
miniature of the Statue of Liberty, which stood on a table in front
of Gata. Asked if he knew what it was, Gata replied, ``It's the
Statue of Liberty. The symbol of America, the symbol of freedom.''
   Using a term first employed by world champion Garri Kasparov for
the Soviet chess establishment, Gata said, ``In Soviet Union, I
can't do anything with the mafia.'' The elder Kamsky said Soviet
officials had limited his son's opportunities to play. ``Garri
Kasparov was trying to fight against this group which controls
Soviet chess, but even Kasparov is often unsuccessful,'' he said.
   Kamsky said their position was far weaker than Kasparov's and in
the end they decided, ``We couldn't do anything here.''
   Last Tuesday, the young Kamsky, who experts predict will reach
the highest echelons of world chess, and his father asked for
political asylum in the United States before the last round of the
New York Open tournament.
   Kamsky won his final round game and was spirited away to an
undisclosed address in Princeton, N.J., where the Kamskys have been
staying with James Sherwin, the president of the American Chess
Foundation.
   Later this week, they are expected to move into their own
apartment, probably in the Russian-speaking neighborhood of
Brighton Beach in Brooklyn.

<HEAD>Unmarked Graves Will be Investigated, Attorney General Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Unmarked graves that may contain
victims of political repression by the deposed regime of Gen.
Alfredo Stroessner will be investigated, the attorney general said
Monday.
   In a separate development, provisional president Andres
Rodriguez extended voter registration by another 10 days for the
May 1 elections, and said indelible ink would be used on voters'
hands to prevent multiple voting. Both were concessions to
opposition demands.
   On Saturday, human rights activist Francisco de Vargas excavated
what he said may be one of 30 graves on a river bank near Colonia
Esperanza, 90 miles east of Asuncion. He said residents told him
they saw police execute victims near the grave site.
   The grave contained shards of bone, false teeth and a skull with
possibly a bullet hole through it, he said.
   ``We view this finding with concern and will put all our effort
into gathering enough information to begin a formal
investigation,'' said Attorney General Diogenes Martinez.
   Three Asuncion police officers accused of torturing prisoners
during the Stroessner regime have been suspended from duty.
   Rodriguez, also the army commander, pledged to respect human
rights and uphold civil liberties shortly after he toppled
Stroessner in a Feb. 3 coup.
   Rodriguez this weekend formally accepted the nomination as
ruling Colorado Party candidate in the May presidential elections.
He is widely expected to win.
   On Monday, he said he extended voter registration so that ``the
largest amount of people possible can vote in upcoming elections,
and that they will be considered clean.''
   Indelible ink will be used during balloting ``so there really
will be no possibility of fraud, and each person can deposit only
one vote,'' he said.
   Both measures were requested by opposition political parties.
   They also demanded Rodriguez support a constitutional reform and
agree not to seek re-election in 1993 if he wins May 1. Rodriguez
endorsed the latter two requests on Sunday.

   Government workers have been busy answering
questions or listening to complaints on a controversial new tax
reform that features a 3 percent sales levy, an official said
Monday.
   The Fair Trade Commission has received more than 300 phone calls
from Tokyo residents about the reform, which was implemented
Saturday, said commission spokesman Eiichiro Kokubo.
   Most callers to the ``cartel emergency line'' pointed out
unwarranted price markups, and expressed fears of inflation, he
said.
   Japan's first tax reform since World War II covers everything
from taxi rides to apartment rents. It offsets cuts in corporate,
inheritance, higher-level income and residential taxes by $44.6
billion in fiscal 1989 with the sales tax, designed to gather $24
billion in this first year.
   Under the reform, the government adjusted a variety of taxes
unevenenly, befuddling consumers.
   For example, the price of expensive imported liquor fell, while
milk prices rose and the price of soft drinks sold in vending
machines stayed the same. Television sets were cheaper, but
newspapers raised their prices.
   The government granted a special exemption for small businesses,
who were not required to collect the 3 percent sales tax on goods
and services. Small business and agriculture are the political
mainstay of the government, led by Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.
   But many exempt enterprises such as taxis and discount stores,
raised prices anyway. Some, to offset increased operating costs,
others simply for profit.
   The commission's telephone advisory service will continue for
two years as the government looks for abuses in the new system,
Kokubo said.
   The Economic Planning Agency has also received about 760 phone
calls and consumer unions nationwide about 400 queries since
Saturday, agency spokeswoman Mitsuko Asada said.
   The tax reform and a stock-profiteering scandal involving
Takeshita and many party members have led to support ratings as low
as 9 percent in recent opinion polls.

   The chairman of the House subcommittee with
jurisdiction over the Alaska pipeline will fly to Alaska on Tuesday
to examine the damage caused by the oil spill in Prince William
Sound, congressional aides said Monday.
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., whose Interior subcommittee on
water, power and offshore energy resources will be considering
legislation that would allow exploration for more oil on Alaska's
North Slope, said the spill could change congressional attitudes
about future drilling.
   ``The oil spill has raised many serious questions about the
ability of the industry to safely operate in a fragile
environmental area,'' said Miller.
   ``I plan to witness first hand the impact of the spill and to
investigate its possible implications for future oil development in
Alaska and for U.S. energy policy in general.''
   Miller's office said a staff attorney has been collecting
confidential information in Alaska since March 29. The spill
occurred March 24 when the oil tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground,
dumping 10 million gallons of oil into the sound.
   Miller, the attorney and Miller's subcommittee staff director
will tour the port at Valdez and Cordova, the fishing hub in
eastern Prince William Sound.
   They also will meet with representatives from Exxon, the Alyeska
Pipeline Co., local fishermen, the state Department of
Environmental Conservation, the Coast Guard, the U.S. National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service and the governor's office.
   Miller's subcommittee held 12 hearings in the last congressional
session on legislation to allow oil development in the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge, near Prudhoe Bay. The bill was never
voted out of the subcommitee.
   The legislation was reintroduced this session, but no hearings
have been held in the House yet. The bill has already passed the
Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and is awaiting a
vote by the full Senate.

<HEAD>Cornell Says Ethics, Not Security, The Key to Preventing Computer
Worms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM KATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Cornell University commission reported
Monday that a graduate student acted alone and with ``reckless
disregard'' when he unleashed a computer ``worm'' that clogged
thousands of computers around the country.
   But a university official said that raising ethical awareness,
not security barriers, is the best way to stop such problems.
   The commission concluded in its report that Robert T. Morris Jr.
did not intend for the worm launched into the Internet network last
Nov. 2 to destroy data or files, but that he did want it to spread
widely.
   The commission said the program was not technically a ``virus''
_ a program that inserts itself into a host program to propagate _
but was a ``worm,'' an independent program that replicates itself
once placed in a computer system.
   Contrary to Morris' claim, release of the worm was not a
``heroic event that pointed up the weaknesses of operating
systems,'' the commission wrote. The commission also denied that
Morris was a genius for creating the worm, saying although it was
technically sophisticated, it could have been created by many
students.
   In fact, Morris' ``juvenile act'' did little in the way of
providing new insights into the already well-known security flaws
of the Internet system, a national research network used by
universities, industry and the government, said M. Stuart Lynn,
Cornell's vice president of technologies.
   Lynn and Cornell Provost Robert Barker said the incident's
greatest impact was the breach of trust it caused among researchers
who use the network. However, both cautioned that employing drastic
security steps was not a solution to prevent similar incidents from
happening in the future.
   ``Violations of such a trust cannot be condoned,'' said Lynn.
``A community of scholars shouldn't have to build sky-high walls in
order to protect a reasonable expectation of privacy, particularly
when such walls would impede the free flow of information and
ideas.''
   Although security has been improved, Lynn said it's unlikely any
steps could guarantee an impenetrable system ``in a community of
individuals possessed of all the knowledge and skills required to
scale the highest barriers.''
   Instead, the Cornell officials stressed the need for improved
awareness of computer ethics.
   ``The focus of our report is on heightening the ethical
considerations, rather than the security considerations,'' said
Lynn.
   Cornell has an express policy about computer abuse, which Morris
had been given a copy of, said Barker.
   Morris, who is on a leave of absence from the school's doctoral
program in computer science, declined to be interviewed by the
commission.
   The commission made no recommendation about disciplinary action.
Barker said Morris' case would be reviewed by a panel of graduate
students and faculty members, which could bar him permanently from
the university. Barker said the punishment would not be made public.
   Morris, 23, of Arnold, Md., remains under investigation by a
federal grand jury in Syracuse and the U.S. Justice Department.

   Rio had one of its most violent

surrounding areas, newspapers reported Monday.
   Helio Saboya, secretary of police for Rio de Janeiro state,
called the figure alarming.
   Police spokesman Luiz Luz would not confirm the number of
killings.
   The newspapers said that there are about 25 killions on an
average weekend.
   Rio de Janeiro is Brazil's second-largest city, with a
metropolitan area of 9 million people.
   Saboya said poverty was the main cause of rising crime. In
Brazil, 60 percent of workers earn less than $40 a week, according

   Thieves slipped unnoticed into a security company's

cash and checks, police said Monday.
   The theft occurred Sunday evening at the offices of Controlpol,
a private security agency where department stores and other firms
keep money over the weekend.
   There was no sign of forced entry and police said the thieves
apparently had duplicate keys.
   A resident of the neighborhood told police later he saw two
well-dressed men carry large bags from the building and put them
into two cars with Milan license plates.
   He said he alerted police after he learned of the robbery.

<HEAD>Apartment Owners Block Traffic to Protest Boost in Interest Rates</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of apartment owners blocked
streets in a lower-class neighborhood of the capital Monday to
protest austerity policies that led to soaring mortgage interest
rates.
   The protesters in the Baruta district shouted against the plan
aimed at fighting inflation that ran 35 percent last year in an
oil-producing country hit hard by lower prices on crude.
   Office workers who live in the district said morning bus traffic
was halted and many people were forced to walk to get to work.
   Protests prompted by the the economic measures left at least 270
people dead last month, according to government figures, although
unofficial estimates place the toll between 300 and 500.
   The new interest rate policy allows banks to float rates on
loans and on deposits according to market pressures. Government
economists have indicated the free-floating interest rates are
necessary to prevent capital flight and promote savings.
   But critics of the policy charge that the new interest rates,
which have gone from 13 percent on an average mortgage contract to
28 percent as of last month with promises of higher rates to come,
will force thousands out of their homes.
   Neighborhood associations and political figures have filed a
lawsuit in the Venezuelan supreme court contesting the interest
rate policy. Neighborhood groups have threatened to withhold their
payments until the court decides the case.
   News reports have indicated President Carlos Andres Perez may be
forced to adjust the program by creating additional subsidies for
homeowners or placing a ceiling on interest rates.
   The interest rate changes are part of an austerity plan begun to
comply with International Monetary Fund plans for a realignment of
Venezuela's economy.

   A judge gave a photographer a suspended prison
term of four months Monday for entering a Palestinian refugee camp
classified as a closed military area.
   In the occupied territories, soldiers shot and killed a
20-year-old Palestinian during a riot at the Amari refugee camp in
the West Bank.
   Officials at Ramallah Hospital said Mohammed Ismail Baba sufferd
a gunshot wound in the chest and was dead on arrival at the
hospital. The army confirmed the death and said it was
investigating.
   Arab hospital sources said at least eight Palestinians were
wounded by troops in scattered clashes in the Gaza Strip Nusseirat
refugee camp and in the West Bank towns of Hebron, El-Bireh and
Ramallah. The military confirmed one Palestinian was wounded and
said it was checking further.
   At least 419 Palestinians and 18 Israelis have been killed in
the 16-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation.
   A children's advocacy group said a 10-year-old Gaza Strip boy
detained for throwing stones was held for two weeks in March,
although Israel's age of criminal responsibility is 12. Eitan Haber
of the Defense Ministry said he was checking the report.
   Judge Edna Bekenstein of the district court in Netanya gave
Claudio Nutkiewicz the suspended sentence and fined him 1,000
shekels (about $555) for entering the Balata camp in West Bank in
December 1987, the photographer said.
   He said the judge told him he violated a 1970 law that
designates all refugee camps as closed military areas. He and other
journalists said the decision could hamper coverage of the occupied
territories, where a Palestinian uprising began 16 months ago.
   An army spokesman said paragraph 90-A of the 1970 law allows the
military to declare any refugee camp closed if the authorities deem
it necessary for operational reasons, ``but it is certainly not
automatic.''
   Since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987, journalists have entered
refugee camps freely unless the camps were under curfew or specific
closure orders.
   Army officers are allowed to declare areas closed and ban news
coverage during times of violent unrest. The army requires officers
who do so to show journalists a paper defining the closed areas.
   Robert Slater, chairman of the Foreign Press Association, said
he was not aware of the law Nutkiewicz said the judge cited.
   ``I hope this will not affect press coverage,'' he said, noting
that Nutkiewicz was the first journalist covering the uprising to
be convicted of violations connected with his work.
   The Argentine-born Israeli, who works for the Images photo
agency, said he and other journalists entered Balata to cover a
women's demonstration and no one told him it was a closed area. He
was detained briefly that day.
   In another press development Monday, Israeli journalists said
they would boycott activities of Jewish settlers in the West Bank
until the settlers stop placing fake ``Press'' signs in their car
windows.
   Reporters said the phony signs make press identification useless
as a protection from Arab protesters, who usually let journalists
pass unharmed.
   ``Today, they impersonate the press; tomorrow they'll pose as
ambulance drivers,'' said Roni Shaked of the Israeli Journalists
Union, who reports for the newspaper Yediot Ahronot.
   ``The settlers think (the signs) will help, but the result will
be that the Arabs will stone both of us and in the end democracy
will suffer,'' Shaked said on Israel radio.
   Yitzhak Kadman, director of the independent National Council for
the Child, said he sent a letter to Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin
protesting detention of the 10-year-old Palestinian. He said the
parents were not told their son was in army custody in Gaza.
   An army spokesman said the child was detained for throwing
stones and told soldiers he was 12. Kadman said the boy told the
troopers repeatedly he was 10.
   According to Kadman, the child was walking to his uncle's home
in the Rafah refugee camp when soldiers in pursuit of
stone-throwing youths grabbed him. The boy was held in Gaza
detention centers for two weeks and was released March 9, he said.
   ``Even if he was over 12, it is inconceivable that they did not
let the parents know their son was being held,'' Kadman said.

   Syrian and Christian gunners shelled
residential areas of the divided city Monday, and politicians
failed once again to stop the most violent chapter in Lebanon's
long civil war since 1985.
   A police spokesman said 20 people were killed and 42 wounded

began at dusk Saturday.
   That brought the casualty toll to 147 killed and 481 wounded,
nearly all civilians, since the battle began March 8 between the
Christian army units of Gen. Michel Aoun and Druse militiamen
backed by Syrian troops.
   A lull at midday Monday allowed people to leave underground
shelters for the first time in 40 hours. They replenished stocks of
food, powdered milk, water and tranquilizers, then rushed back to
bunkers.
   ``This is driving me crazy,'' said Paula Trad, a Christian
university student who lives in east Beirut's Sin el-Fil district.
``How long can people take it?''
   Sources at Aoun's headquarters said his U.S.-trained 8th Brigade
in Souk el-Gharb repulsed Syrian tank assaults on the deserted
mountain resort with armor-piercing rockets.
   It was the Syrians' ``first tank assault ... to test the 8th,''
a source said privately. ``They seem to be preparing for all-out
onslaught.''
   Souk el-Gharb, 15 miles southeast of Beirut, overlooks roads
leading from the Druse-controlled Chouf Mountains to Christian
territory.
   In Washington, the State Department accused both sides of
``reckless disregard'' for human life and called for an immediate
cease-fire.
   A Lebanese militia chieftain who has stayed out of the fight
said leaders of 20 Moslem and leftist militias would meet Wednesday
with an Arab League committee about how to end the confrontation.
Nabih Berri of the Shiite Moslem militia Amal made the announcement
in the Syrian capital.
   Chances of an immediate settlement collapsed Monday when Aoun,
who also heads a Christian military cabinet, rejected a suggestion
by Premier Salem Hoss, leader of the competing Moslem government,
that both resign.
   An aide, speaking anonymously by telephone, quoted Aoun as
saying: ``That wouldn't work. It's nonsense.''
   Hoss made the suggestion Sunday in a plea for the factions to
``stop shooting at once; stop the bloodbath, stop the massacre.''
   ``If Gen. Aoun and myself have become the two sides of the coin
in the current crisis, then we had better rid our country and
people of this problem,'' he said in a broadcast on Moslem radio
stations.
   Abdulla Rassi, interior minister in the Hoss cabinet, told
reporters Monday: ``We're at a loss. We can't find a way out of
this horrific, vicious circle.''
   He proposed a joint Christian and Moslem military committee of
the fractured Lebanese army to pursue ways of securing and
monitoring a cease-fire.
   Aoun insists any such committee include the Syrian army and have
a mandate to enforce a truce and set a timetable for Syrian
withdrawal from Lebanon.
   A political crisis that began in September led to the two
governments and division of the army on sectarian lines. Aoun leads
the 20,000 Christian troopers and the 22,000 Moslems, poorly
equipped, are commanded by Maj. Gen. Sami Khatib.
   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under a peacekeeping
mandate from the Arab League granted in 1976, a year after the
civil war began, and has become the country's main power broker.
Aoun has declared a ``war of liberation'' to drive the Syrians out.
   Fighting began two days after Aoun's forces imposed an air-sea
blockade March 6 on illegal ports run by militias, which cost the
government's five legal ports on the 130-mile coast an estimated
$100 million a year in revenue.
   Walid Jumblatt's Druse militia responded with artillery fire,
soon joined by Syrian gunners, and the Syrians and Khatib's Moslem
army troops blockaded the 310-square-mile Christian enclave north
and east of Beirut.
   Aoun's blockade continues, covering four ports run by Moslem
militias and a northern port operated by former President Suleiman
Franjieh's Marada Party. Sources close to Franjieh have said he was
willing to hand it over to Aoun but the Syrians, who control the
area, would not permit it.
   Gunboats raked the Druse port of Jiye with machine-gun fire at
midnight Sunday and again before dawn, police said, but no reports
on casualties or damage were available.
   Jiye, 15 miles south of Beirut, is the main port operated by
Jumblatt, whose militia that controls the central mountains and the
Chouf region.
   Police said Moslem gunners had fired 10,000 shells since
Saturday into the enclave where 1 million Christians live, and
Aoun's men rained 4,300 rounds on Moslem west Beirut, the central
mountains and the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of east Lebanon.
   President Amin Gemayel appointed Aoun to lead an interim
government when Gemayel's six-year term ended in September and
Parliament could not agree on a succesor. Moslems rejected the
appointment and swore allegiance to Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who served
under Gemayel.
   By unwritten agreement since independence from France in 1943,
Lebanon's president is Christian, the premier Sunni and the
parliament speaker Shiite Moslem.

<HEAD>Eighth Massachusetts Victim Identified, Tipster Comes Forward</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The eighth victim of an apparent
serial killer was identified Monday as a 27-year-old New Bedford
woman, and authorities said a previously anonymous letter writer is
aiding investigators.
   The body found Friday along Route 88 in Westport was identified
as that of Mary Rose Santos, a mother of two young boys who had
been missing since July 16.
   Meanwhile, investigators, aided by dogs trained to sniff out the
dead, resumed their search Monday for more bodies along highways in
southern Massachusetts. The dogs are trained with an aromatic
compound called ``Cadavarine.''
   Like the previous seven victims, Santos had ties to this port
city's drug community, said Bristol County District Attorney Ronald
A. Pina.
   An anonymous letter reached Pina on March 16, telling him that
investigators might find a body along Route 88. If a body was
found, the author said he might come forward.
   After two boys found Santos' body, the informant contacted
authorities.
   ``He witnessed an event taking place along Route 88,'' said Jim
Martin, a spokesman for Pina. ``This person is providing us with
some good information and we need to protect this person.''
   Martin added that he did not wish to say whether the informant
was male or female.
   Investigators have met with the informant in secret and at
various locations to maintain the informant's anonymity, Martin
said.
   A special grand jury was to reconvene Tuesday to hear testimony
from 18 subpoenaed witnesses, but Martin said that the informant
would not be among them because the news media will be present
outside the court.
   The informant's testimony could be taken by a police officer and
then presented to the grand jury, he said.
   Connecticut State Police loaned two ``body dogs'' and
Massachusetts State Police added one to the search Monday, Martin
said.
   Three of the eight victims found along routes 140, 88 and
Interstate 195 in towns near New Bedford were discovered by police
dogs.
   Massachusetts has 15 patrol dogs that have undergone a 10- to
16-week course to learn to search for bodies, according to State
Trooper Kathy Barrett, whose German Shephard, Cyros, has been busy
in the highway killings case.
   Cyros is also trained to do routine patrol work and search for
missing persons or fugitives. The Connecticut dogs, under the
direction of Trooper Andy Rebman, work only on body searches.
   Rebman trains many of the region's police ``body dogs'' as part
of a New England consortium of state police.
   At first, handlers try to make a game out of the training by
``inserting'' the smell of a decaying corpse on a favorite toy or
ball. The trainers then hide the ball in thick brush and the dog
seeks it.
   The smell is placed on the ball with ``Cadavarine,'' a compound
that simulates the odor of a dead body. It is also known as
1,5-Diaminopentane and sold by Pfaltz and Bauer Inc. of Waterbury,
Conn.
   ``Cadaverine is a chemical equivalent of the gases and odors
that are given off by a decaying body,'' said New Hampshire State
Police Cpt. Ernest Loomis.
   New Hampshire had its first dog trained for body work just six
months ago. Loomis said handlers are careful to wear rubber gloves
when training Kaizer with the Cadaverine because of the potent and
long-lasting nature of the odor.
   ``A little of it goes a long way,'' he said.
   Massachusetts State Trooper Walter Keenan, whose shephard,
Stark, does body work, said Cadavarine sells for about $50 an ounce.

<HEAD>Glance At 23-Year War In Namibia</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Namibia, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a brief overview of the 23-year
war in Namibia between the South African-led security forces and
the guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's Organization.
   ORIGIN: SWAPO began military operations in 1966 after South
Africa defied a United Nations resolution to relinquish control of
the territory it had captured from the Germans in World War I. An
estimated 20,000 people, mostly SWAPO guerrillas, have been killed.
   FIGHTING: Almost all the fighting has taken place in northern
Namibia and involved bush battles and sabotage attacks carried out
by SWAPO forces that infiltrated from bases in southern Angola.
SWAPO has never been able to establish permanent bases inside
Namibia, and only a small number of guerrillas have been active in
the territory at any time. Until the fighting in recent days, both
sides had observed an informal cease-fire since August.
   SIZE: South African military officials estimate SWAPO has 8,000
members in its military wing. SWAPO says it also has 80,000
supporters at refugee camps outside Namibia, although the U.N. has
put the figure at about 60,000.
   South Africa had an estimated 50,000 troops in Namibia,
concentrated in the north. The figure includes Namibians belonging
to the South-West Africa Territorial Force. The number must be
reduced to 12,000 by mid-May and 1,500 by July 1 under the peace
accords signed last December.
   Also, South Africa has agreed to cut the territorial police
force from 8,300 to 6,000 during the independence process.
   The United Nations has authorized 4,650 peacekeeping troops for
the operation, but only about 1,000 have arrived.
   ANGOLA: In the civil war in neighboring Angola, 50,000 Cuban
troops have supported the Marxist government in its fight against
the UNITA rebel movement, which is backed by the United States, and
until the recent peace accord, South Africa.
   UNITA bases in southern Angola are to the east of the SWAPO
camps. The two guerrilla groups are hostile toward one another, but
have virtually no contact. The Cubans and the Angolans support
SWAPO, but do not directly assist the guerrillas with attacks
inside Namibia.

<HEAD>Witness Quotes Casey as Saying North Would handle Contras' Needs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A witness on Monday quoted the late CIA
Director William Casey as saying President Reagan had designated
Oliver North to handle the Nicaraguan Contras' military needs in
the event of a congressional ban on official U.S. aid.
   Vincent Cannistraro, a defense witness in North's trial, said
Casey made the statement in the spring of 1984 during a meeting at
the CIA attended by CIA official Duane Clarridge; the CIA station
chief in Costa Rica, Joseph Fernandez, and a Contra leader who was
not identified.
   The witness said at the outset of his testimony that he was
knowledgeable about activities of the CIA in support of the Contras
in the two years before the ban on aid went into effect and he
intimated, but never said, that he was with the CIA at the time. He
said that in September 1984 he went to work for then-National
Security Adviser Robert McFarlane and had an office next door to
North's.
   It had become obvious, Cannistraro said, that in the fiscal year
starting in October 1984 Congress would cut off funds for the
Contras.
   ``He, Bill Casey, speaking on behalf of the president of the
United States, wanted to assure the freedom fighters that the U.S.
government would find a way'' to support them after the ban took
effect, Cannistraro testified. ``He said Colonel North would not be
subject to those restrictions.''
   Casey died in 1987.
   North maintained in congressional testimony that he acted in the
belief that the ban applied only to intelligence agencies and not
the National Security Council where he was an aide.
   Reagan told the Tower Commission on Jan. 26, 1987 that ``he did
not know that the NSC staff was engaged in helping the Contas.''
   Charges against North include allegations that he concealed from
Congress and former Attorney General Edwin Meese III his efforts on
behalf of the Contras.
   At a subsequent meeting attended by North and Contra leader
Adolfo Calero, Cannistraro said, ``there was more specific
discussion that Colonel North would be responsible at the White
House after October 1984 _ the only one dealing with the Contras on
paramilitary support.''
   Cannistraro was asked by U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell who
had given authority for that arrangement, and he quoted Casey as
having said earlier that ``he had discussed this with the president
of the United States and agreed with the president this is how it
should be handled.''
   Earlier Monday, a Texas woman who contributed more than $2
million to help the Nicaraguan guerrillas asserted firmly, and at
times indignantly, that North never directly asked for or received
money from her while he was a White House aide.
   ``That was a lie,'' Ellen Garwood testified when told of a
fund-raiser's earlier testimony at North's trial that she may have
signed a $75,000 check in North's office. She said North did
describe ``desperate'' Contra needs to her, but the fund-raiser
didn't ask for the money until after they had left.
   Mrs. Garwood was the second defense witness. She followed former
Marine Corps commandant Paul X. Kelley, who testified that he
reluctantly extended North's tour at the National Security Council
three times after high administration officials persuaded him that
North was needed there.
   Also Monday, the Supreme Court refused to scuttle North's trial
or block the trials of two of his co-defendants, former National
Security Adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealer Albert Hakim.
   The three had sought dismissal of all charges, arguing that
grand jurors and grand jury witnesses were exposed to the highly
publicized congressional testimony they had given under a limited
grant of immunity from prosecution.
   The justices did not give a reason for rejecting the argument.
However, in a separate case last week, the court ruled that federal
criminal defendants who fail to persuade a judge to throw out their
indictments because of alleged misconduct by prosecutors cannot
appeal before they are convicted.
   Mrs. Garwood said she had met North a half dozen times and that
he had briefed her on the Contra fight on Aug. 23, 1985, before she
signed a check.
   ``Colonel North showed me a map of Central America. ... He said,
`This is a desperate situation for the freedom fighters. I'm not
asking you for money. As a member of the government and the
National Security Council, I cannot ask you for money,''' she
testified.
   Mrs. Garwood, who lives in Austin, Texas, said she left North's
office in the White House complex with fund-raiser Carl Channell en
route to a hotel, across a small park.
   ``Mr. Channell asked me for money after we left,'' she said.
``We were probably a half block away from the hotel. He asked, `Can
you give $75,000 to help the situation?' I wrote a check for that
amount.''
   When he testified March 8, Channell was asked whether she signed
the check in North's office.
   ``Or very shortly thereafter, an hour at the most,'' Channell
said. When the question was asked a second time, Channell said, ``I
think it was right there in that office.''
   Mrs. Garwood said her father, then a State Department official,
had worked on the Marshall Plan that helped save Greece and Turkey
from communism after World War II.
   ``I felt if Greece and Turkey were threatened, how much more the
people of Nicaragua,'' she said.
   Mrs. Garwood told of a second contribution, of $32,000, that she
made after a meeting with North and rebel leader Calero at a Dallas
airport.
   ``While Colonel North was present, did Channell ask for money?''
asked defense lawyer Brendan Sullivan.
   ``No, he never did. Colonel North wouldn't have allowed it.''
   In April 1986, Mrs. Garwood met with Reagan ``after lunch to
have Sanka'' on a trip to Washington which resulted in her giving
$2 million to the Contras, largely through donations of stock
certificates.

<HEAD>Shouts of `Long Live the King' As Hapsburgs Leave Church</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands cheered and people shouted
``Long Live the King!'' when Otto von Hapsburg and other members of
the family left a church Monday after a Mass for his mother Zita,
the last queen of Hungary.
   Inside St. Matthew's Church, where Hungary's rulers were
crowned, parishioners sang the national anthem as Mass was
celebrated by Cardinal Laszlo Paskai, the Roman Catholic primate.
Zita died March 14 at age 96.
   One report said the anthem was sung again as Otto, eldest son of
the the queen, and several other Hapsburgs left the church, but
witness Janos Gudenus said he was not aware of it being sung
outside. He is a descendant of the Gudenus barons of Hungary.
   The requiem in Budapest, now a communist capital, occurred two
days after the most elaborate funeral Vienna has seen in more than
70 years. Zita, also the last empress of Austria, was buried at the
Capuchin Vault, the last resting place of the Hapsburg dynasty.
   Otto von Hapsburg made his first official visit to Hungary last
month. He was cheered at Karl Marx University, where he delivered a
lecture, and at other public appearances.
   At the town of Nagyarmos on the Danube River, between 5,000 and
6,000 people demonstrated against a hydropower project Monday and
demanded the Hungarian government resign, state radio reported.
   About 130,000 Hungarians have signed a petition asking that
construction stop and a referendum be held.
   The Nagymaros dam and power plant is being built in conjunction
with a similar complex upstream at Gabcikovo, Czechoslovakia.
Parliament voted earlier this month to continue the project, which
is financed largely with Austrian money in provided in exchange for
future power supplies.
   Critics say the dams will destroy wetlands and wildlife and
endanger supplies of drinking water for hundreds of thousands of
Hungarians.
   The demonstrators, who gathered near the site, demanded the
entire government resign but particularly the environment minister,
Laszlo Maroti.

<HEAD>Watkins Targets Summer For Decision On Restarting Key Reactors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins on Monday
told Congress he expects to give final approval by August to a plan
for restarting an idled nuclear reactor in South Carolina that
makes materials for atomic weapons.
   Watkins told a special panel of the House Armed Service
Committee he had begun reviewing restart recommendations from
Westinghouse Electric Corp., which operates the Savannah River Site
reactors under an Energy Department contract.
   He indicated that while he was pleased with Westinghouse's
approach to attempting to resolve the safety and managerial
problems at the site, near Aiken, S.C., its recommendations fell
short of what is needed to get the plant back in operation.
   ``We have, I'm afraid, a lot more work to do than I see even in
that plan at this point,'' Watkins said.
   He said a series of reviews by Energy Department officials and
outside experts will be undertaken to ensure a safe resumption of
tritium production at Savannah River. Tritium is a radioactive gas
needed in the production of nuclear warheads.
   The three active reactors at Savannah River have been shut down
for nearly a year because of safety, structural and managerial
problems. A massive campaign has been underway in recent months to
retrain reactor operators, upgrade some plant equipment and
establish more Energy Department control of operations there.
   Earlier this year, the Energy Department had said it was aiming
to restart the K reactor at Savannah River by the end of the year.
It said a further delay would put a serious pinch on supplies of
tritium, thus undermining national security.
   Watkins appeared to suggest that a restart was not likely until
1990, although he said it is too early to say for certain when a
safe restart can be accomplished.
   He said he had detected ``some significant voids'' in restart
preparations shortly after he was nominated for the energy job in
January ``that we were not addressing, in my opinion, sufficiently
and could well have delayed unnecessarily the reactor startup next
year.''
   Watkins stressed several times during his testimony that much
work remains to be done before he will be ready to authorize a
resumption of reactor operations.
   ``The steps we have to take for a safe starting will be totally
different than anything we have done in the past,'' he said.
   Watkins also reaffirmed the Bush administration's committment to
winning congressional approval for a $6.8 billion project to build
a new generation of tritium-producing reactors, one at Savannah
River and another in Idaho, to replace the current Savannah River
complex, which was built in the early 1950s.
   The department has encountered opposition to the plan by some
legislators and environmental groups. Critics say no more than one
new reactor is necessary, but Watkins said he wants extra
production capacity in case of emergencies.
   ``This duality makes strategic sense,'' he said, since it would
mean no loss of nuclear capability in the event an earthquake or
other natural disaster disabled one reactor.

<TEXT>
   Iran recalled its ambassador to Ankara on
Monday in apparent retaliation for a similar decision announced
earlier by Turkey.
   Turkey's decision followed a string of incidents which have
severely strained relations in recent weeks. It also reflected
official anger at Iranian efforts to export the Islamic revolution
to Turkey, which takes pride in its secular system.
   State-run Tehran television, monitored in Nicosia, quoted an
unidentified spokesman at the Iranian Foreign Ministry as saying
the decision to recall Ambassador Manouchehr Mottaki stemmed from
the ``Turkish government's unprincipled and unfriendly treatment of
the Iranian ambassador.''
   Hours earlier, Nuzhet Kandemir, a Turkish foreign
undersecretary, told reporters that Ambassador Omer Akbel will be
recalled from Tehran within a week.
   Kandemir said Iran had ``shown an unaccustomed and bothersome
interest'' in a recent decision by Turkey's constitutional court to
ban Turkish university women from wearing traditional Islamic
headscarves on campus.
   Iranians marched in Tehran to protest the decision, and the
Iranian state-run radio broadcast commentaries critical of the ban.
   Iranian spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini denounced
the ruling in a speech last month and voiced support for
demonstrations by Turkish Moslem fundamentalists against the ban.
   Kandemir also criticized the activities of the Iranian
ambassador in Turkey, noting that Mottaki took a prominent role at
a rally organized by a political party, the religious Prosperity
Party.
   He also cited a recent statement to Turkish newspapers by
Mottaki, who reportedly said Iran would reduce its imports from
Turkey because of the headscarf controversy.
   Kandemir said the ambassador had been warned several times to
refrain from such statements.
   The resurgence of revolutiary puritanism in Iran follows
Khomeini's death sentence on British novelist Salman Rushdie for
allegedly blaspheming Islam in his book, ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Fourteen European countries called home their ambassadors for
consultations to protest Khomeini's edict, and Iran later severed
ties with Britain over the affair.

   Three former defense contracting
executives heard themselves accused of ``bribing ... cheating ...
lying'' on Monday at the start of the first trial stemming from the
federal investigation into fraud in the Pentagon's purchasing
system.
   The defendants' lawyers said they had done nothing wrong.
   The three former Teledyne Electronics executives _ George Kaub,
Dale Schnittjer and Eugene Sullivan _ are charged with bribery,
conspiracy and making false statements in an indictment handed up
by the grand jury three months ago.
   All worked for the Newbury Park, Calif., company that is a
subsidiary of Teledyne ndustries, which has already pleaded guilty
in the case. In addition, a former Navy procurement official and
two private consultants have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate
with prosecutors.
   ``This is a case about bribing, about cheating, about lying,''
said Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert DeHenzel Jr. in his opening
arguments in the case before U.S. District Judge Richard Williams.
   DeHenzel outlined a complicated scheme in which he said the
executives agreed to pay money to private consultant William
Parkin, who in turn indirectly bribed a Navy official, Stuart
Berlin, for inside information about a $24 million contract to
build hand-held radar test equipment. The middleman between Parkin
and Berlin was consultant Fred Lackner, DeHenzel said.
   ``Berlin provided Lackner with confidential information. ...A
lot of the information should not have been given to anyone outside
government,'' he said.
   Kaub and Sullivan were initially involved in agreeing to a
$10,000 contract that Parkin had with Teledyne starting in late
1985, the prosecutor said. The initial contract called for Parkin
to provide help in reversing a decision that might have dimmed
Teledyne's chances for the contract by setting it aside for a small
business entity.
   Once Teledyne was awarded the deal in June, 1987, the agreement
called for Parkin to receive $150,000 over two years for his
services, the prosecutor said.
   Kaub was Teledyne Electronics' executive vice president dealing
with government contracts. Sullivan and his successor, Schnittjer,
were also executive vice presidents.
   Lawyers for the three men denied that their clients had done
anything wrong and argued that they were victims of a conspiracy
between Parkin and his associates.
   ``No one can be found guilty unless they know what is going
on,'' said George O'Connell, Sullivan's attorney.
   Mark Tuohey, Kaub's attorney, told the jury that when they
evaluate the evidence they will find ``there was a conspiracy of
silence'' between Parkin and those whom he had agreed to pay for
his information.
   Schnittjer's attorney, Stan Mortenson, said his client didn't
even begin work at the Newbury Park facility until a month after
the government contract was negotiated. ``Schnittjer is an innocent
victim ... wrongly charged with 14 crimes,'' Mortenson said.
   The government's first witness in the case, Charles Jones, an
Air Force contracting officer, testified that if information was
released to one contractor the same data should have been made
available to everyone.
   The government began its investigation into the
$150-billion-a-year Pentagon procurement system nearly three years
ago but the probe was not publicly revealed until June 1988. Agents
used telephone wiretaps and tape-recorded conversations to gather
evidence in the case that centers on allegations that consultants
paid bribes to get information useful to their clients in winning
contracts.
   The tapes are expected to be played in court.

   President Bush, who once captained the Yale
baseball team, pitched his first ball as president Monday at the
season opener between the Baltimore Orioles and the Boston Red Sox.
   As the president of Egypt and a sellout crowd of 54,000 looked
on, southpaw Bush hurled a game-opening pitch that was a little
high and outside. Orioles catcher Mickey Tettleton had no problem
snagging it over his right shoulder.
   ``He caught it before it started breaking,'' Bush insisted
afterwards.
   Bush brought with him Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who told
reporters this was the first baseball game he had been to although
``I saw it on television several times.''
   Bush defended his pitch later during a picture-taking session in
a glass-enclosed box above third base.
   ``What do you think? You're an objective judge?'' he asked
baseball great Ted Williams, a longtime friend.
   ``A high, hard fastball,'' Williams answered.
   Bush then asked A. Bartlett Giamatti, the commissioner of
baseball, for his opinion. ``Superb. I didn't see it, but I
heard,'' the commissioner said.
   Bush and Mubarak munched on hamburgers and hot dogs and drank
soft drinks in Orioles cups.
   At one point, Mubarak put on an Orioles baseball cap for
photographers. Bush's tie was in the Orioles' team colors _ orange
and black.
   Mubarak said that he was enjoying the game and that Bush was ``a
good teacher, of course. He was the captain of the biggest team in
the United States.''
   ``That's what I told him,'' joked Bush.
   Also in the box were Secretary of State James A. Baker III,
Chief of Staff John Sununu and Budget Director Richard Darman,
wearing a Red Sox cap.
   The sky was overcast when Bush and Mubarak left Washington by
helicopter. By the time the game began shortly after 2 p.m.,
however, the sun had poked through the clouds and was shining
brightly.
   Bush and his party stayed through the fifth inning, missing most
of the game's action. When he left, the score was Orioles 1, Red
Sox 0. The Orioles went on to win, 5-4, in 12 innings.
   Bush was captain of the 1948 Yale baseball team. A first baseman
known for his fielding, Bush's batting average was a modest .167.
   But that didn't stop him of dreaming of ``a fat contract to play
professional baseball,'' as he put it in his 1987 biography
``Looking Forward.''
   Bush, who bats right-handed but throws with his left, has been
an avid baseball fan ever since. He freout first
balls in his eight years as vice president and during the 1988
presidential campaign.
   After ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' by rock singer Joan Jett,
Bush strode jauntily to the mound in his shirt sleeves. Catcher
Tettleton moved forward a teps to catch the president's pitch.
   Of the 26 opening day pitchers in major league baseball, 23 are
paid more than Bush's $200,000 salary as president.
   Of those, Orioles starting pitcher Dave Schmidt will make
$625,000 this season and Red Sox opening pitcher Roger Clemens,
$2.3 million.
   In addition tfelong enthusiasm for the game, Bush has
baseball in his family. His oldest son, George W. Bush, recently
became the leader of a partnership ts Rangers.

<HEAD>Company Wants To Use Tobacco To Fight Cancer And Create Beneficial
Products</HEAD>

   Tobacco plants may be enlisted in the war
on cancer by a spray that turns them into factories for making
anti-cancer drugs, sunscreen and other useful chemicals, an
executive said Monday.
   ``It's a way to use tobacco for products other than cigarettes
for smoking,'' said geneticist Robert L. Erwin, president of
Biosource Genetics Corp., a privately held company backed by
venture capitalists.
   ``This technology might be a way to reduce the cost of producing
many medically important chemicals.''
   Erwin said the Vacaville, Calif., company has applied for
patents on a method of genetically engineering tobacco plants so
they can produce various desired products. Biosource Genetics also
wants to patent the process to help make melanin, a natural skin
pigment that might be used as a more effective sunscreen to prevent
skin cancer from ultraviolet sunlight.
   Experiments so far have been performed indoors, where tobacco
plants and cells successfully produced two enzymes to test the
method, as well as an enzyme that helps make melanin, Erwin said
during the American Cancer Society's annual seminar for science
writers.
   Within 12 months, the privately held company hopes to conduct
field tests of tobacco genetically engineered to produce the
anti-cancer drug interleukin-2 and serum albumin, a major protein
in blood that is used as a supplement in transfusions.
   Erwin said other potential products of genetically altered
tobacco include an insecticide, a substance that allows the
time-release of flavors in foods and fragrances in perfumes,
enzymes to help make paper and reduce cholesterol levels in foods,
and other cancer drugs such as interferon and vincristine.
   Biosource Genetics used tobacco plants because they are
well-understood, easily manipulated and serve as plant researchers'
equivalent of the laboratory mouse, Erwin said. The company was
considering the same method to genetically alter pepper, potato,
and tomato plants, he added.
   The effort to convert tobacco plants into living factories for
the cheap mass production of industrial chemicals, medicines and
cosmetics drew criticism from an environmental group. But it also
garnered interest from a tobacco growers group and cautious praise
from the former director of the National Cancer Institute.
   Dr. Vincent T. DeVita Jr., who left NCI last year to become
physician-in-chief at New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center, said he thought the possibility of using tobacco to fight
cancer instead of causing it ``is really kind of cute.''
   ``It's a very interesting idea,'' DeVita said. ``It sounds too
good to be true, but looks real enough to pursue.''
   Andrew Kimbrell, attorney and policy director for the
anti-biotechnology Foundation on Economic Trends, said a substance
sprayed on tobacco plants to profoundly change what they produce
``could go to other plants with results unknown. We have real
concerns about what other plants it might affect.''
   Erwin said his company's method is safe because the spray
degrades quickly, creates only a temporary genetic change in the
tobacco plants, and the changes are not passed from plant to plant
or from one generation of plants to the next.
   The process ``should help make the cigarette habit increasingly
expensive as tobacco production is shunted into more constructive
end uses,'' he said.
   Reginald Lester, managing director of the Tobacco Growers'
Information Committee in Raleigh, N.C., said, ``Certainly growers
would be interested in taking a look at this if it could be shown
to be commercially viable.''
   Biosource Genetics alters tobacco plants by spraying them with
molecules of RNA _ part of the fundamental hereditary information
of all living things _ taken from the tobacco mosaic virus and
encased in a protein coating.
   This virus-like substance invades the plant, carrying with it a
gene, or hereditary command, that orders production of the desired
chemical.
   Because the new genetic command dies with the plant, a farmer
would plant tobacco, then decide later in the season whether to
sell it for cigarettes or spray it to produce a medicine or
industrial chemical. Erwin said a different spray could be used the
next season to make the tobacco produce another substance.

<HEAD>Legislators Approve Peace Plan</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: LEADS throughout to CLARIFY that legislators approved the policy
statement, but future of suspension of Islamic law in doubt because of
bill that goes before assembly Tuesday. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMED OSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislators on Monday approved the new
government's program, which includes a peace plan to end the
6-year-old civil war in southern Sudan.
   The peace plan endorsed the suspension of Islamic law.
Suspending Sharia is a key demand of the rebels, most of whom are
African-descended Christians or animists. Northern Sudan and the
government are dominated by Moslems, and fundamentalist Moslems
have vowed stiff and even violent opposition to the removal of
Islamic law.
   It generally had been assumed that legislative approval of the
peace plan would automatically freeze action on a bill to amend the
existing Sharia-based penal code. But the bill is scheduled to go
to the assembly Tuesday, indicating the issue has not been
resolved. Provisions of the amended law, drawn up by a
parliamentary committee, have not been disclosed.
   After Monday's vote, assembly speaker Yusuf Ahmed Yusuf said,
``Endorsement does not necessarily mean dropping other bills.''
   The remark by Yusuf, a member of the fundamentalist National
Islamic Front, was seen as a challenge to the promised suspension
of Islamic law.
   Sudan's Constituent Assembly voted 128-23 for the policy
statement Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi presented after creating a
peace Cabinet under pressure from the armed forces. The colonels
had demanded Mahdi make peace with the rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army or step down.
   About 100 legislators abstained from voting on the measure, but
Mahdi's Umma Party and its coalition partners command more than 200
seats to the Islamic Front's 50.
   Mahdi's peace plan calls for a cease-fire, an end to a state of
emergency in force since 1985 and a constitutional conference that
would deal with a final settlement with the insurgents.
   On March 26 Mahdi's government adopted the peace plan based on
one negotiated in November with rebel leader John Garang.
   Garang has said he would open peace talks with the government
only after legislators approved the plan including the suspension
of Islamic law.
   The Islamic penal code provides for amputation of limbs for
theft, execution by stoning for adultery, and public flogging for
drinking alcohol.
   The newspaper Al-Khartoum on Monday quoted Islamic Front
Secretary-General Ali Haj Amin as saying his party ``will resist
any move aimed at blocking ratification of the Islamic bill.''
   Last week the front's regional secretary, Mohamed Osman Mahjoub,
told a rally: ``We will mobilize all Moslem households and call all
Sudanese Moslems to come out in the streets to fight for their
pride.''
   Islamic law has not been practiced in Sudan since President
Gaafar Nimeiri was ousted by the military in 1985.
   Mahdi tried to defuse the issue Sunday, telling reporters, ``We
are making an effort to reach peace, and we have decided that
(action on) Islamic laws be postponed until the convening of the
projected constitutional conference.''
   That indicated the proposed constitutional conference would have
the final say on the issue.
   Garang's rebels began fighting in 1983, demanding greater
autonomy and a better economic deal for the southern zone. No
reliable figures are available on how many people have been killed
in the civil war.
   Western relief agencies estimate that in 1988 the fighting and a
war-created famine killed between a quarter million and a half
million southern Sudanese.

   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's chief
adviser on Monday welcomed a call by President Bush for a Middle
East peace conference and Israel's withdrawal from its occupied
territories as an ``important and serious development.''
   Bassam Abu Sharif told The Associated Press the Palestine
Liberation Organization feels ``this will give a real push for
peace efforts in the Middle East.''
   ``We hope that the positive position of President Bush would
convince the Israeli government that peace could be established in
the Middle East on the basis of a two-state solution, two states
living side-by-side in peace,'' Abu Sharif said.
   Bush also told a White House news conference after a meeting
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that he supported
``achievement of Palestinian political rights.''
   Earlier the PLO central committee, ending a four-day meeting in
Tunis, ruled out any let-up in the Palestinian uprising in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip in exchange for Israeli-sponsored elections.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir announced last week his
government would allow limited elections in the occupied
territories, and withdraw troops from major Arab cities, if the
Palestinian uprising stopped.
   But the Israeli leader, due in Washington for talks this week,
envisions only limited autonomy for the Palestinians and refuses to
talk with the PLO, which he views as a terrorist group.
   ``The Central Committee announced to the world that the
intefadeh (uprising) will not cease and our people's struggle will
continue,'' said the statement telefaxed to the AP in Cyprus by the
official Palestinian press agency, WAFA.
   At least 419 Palestinians and 16 Israelis have been killed in
the nearly 16-month-old uprising against Israel's military
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza strip.
   The 70-member Central Committee is an interim group of the
450-seat Palestine National Council, which is scheduled to meet
once a year. The Central Committee and the smaller, 15-member
Executive Committee, make policy recommendations to be weighed by
the full body.
   The Central Committee reviewed the United States-PLO talks,
``welcomed the continuation of these talks and stressed their
importance,'' the statement said. The United States began talks
with the PLO in December for the first time in 13 years after
Arafat renounced terrorism and said he recognized Israel's right to
exist.
   Also Monday, the Persian Gulf newspaper Al-Khaleej reported that
Tunisia had barred the entry of Abul Abbas, the leader of the
Palestine Liberation Front who has accused of masterminding the
hijacking of the Italian cruise vessel Achille Lauro in 1985.
   Al-Khaleej, a United Arab Emirates newspaper based in Sharjah,
quoted a Palestine Liberation Front source as saying Abul Abbas was
not able to attend the Central Committee meeting.
   Abul Abbas was asked to stop trying to enter Tunisia, but the
Tunisian government gave no reason for banning him, said the
unnamed source in a dispatch from Algeria.
   There was no immediate confirmation of the report from Tunisia,
where the PLO, umbrella for all guerrilla factions including Abbas'
group, is headquartered.
   Abul Abbas, whose full name is Mohammed Abbas, has been branded
as a terrorist in the United States since the 1985 incident in
which an American citizen, 69-year-old Leon Klinghoffer, was killed.
   The United States reportedly wants Abul Abbas expelled from the
PLO, and the paper, which is known for its hard-line stance on the
Palestinian issue, dropped hints that Arafat was complying.
   Abul Abbas was convicted in absentia in an Italian court and
sentenced to life for the Achille Lauro affair.

   Jackhammer crews Monday began breaking
up 200 tons of concrete that crashed down on at least three cars
and a tractor-trailer truck when a section of a U.S. highway bridge
collapsed into a river.
   Seven people died and an eighth was reported missing in the
accident Saturday night about 50 miles north of Memphis.
   Authorities planned to bring in a 60-ton National Guard crane to
remove the concrete once engineers pronounced the bridge safe to
support the equipment, said Jim Thacker, regional manager of the
Tennessee Emergency Management Agency.
   A possible eighth victim was a local man missing since Saturday
night when the bridge fell.
   ``He's missing and he should have been on this road at that
time,' said Jacky Carter, an investigator with the emergency agency.
   Divers found the other victims in the swirling, coffee-colored
water Saturday and Sunday. There were no survivors in the vehicles
known to have plunged into the 30-foot-deep water, authorities said.
   Bill Tucker, county executive for Lauderdale County, said
authorities know of no other local residents who might be in the
river.
   ``There's a possibility that somebody from out of state or
something could be somewhere further on down, but that's just a
remote possibility,'' Tucker said. ``We think we've got it isolated
to one area.''
   But Terry Petty, a diver with the Tennessee Highway Patrol, said
the water was so dark it was hard to tell if other vehicles might
be in the river. The current was eight to 10 knots, he said.
   ``With this current, if a car went off after it fell (and was
not trapped under the concrete), it could be a mile down the
river,'' Petty said.
   The 55-year-old bridge, eight-tenths of a mile long, carried two
north-bound lanes of U.S. Highway 51 across the Hatchie River about
five miles north of Covington at the Tipton-Lauderdale county line.
   A companion bridge, built in the mid-1970s to carry the
highway's south-bMilliganes, was unaffected but has been closed
indefinitely whiMilligan's hit-and-run single.
   After Mike Smithson replaced Bob Stanley, Worthington flared a
1-0 pitch into left-center field past Ellis Burks' dive, foiling a
Boston formation of five infielders.
   Brian Holton, acquired in an off-season trade that sent Eddie
Murray to Los Angeles, pitched 4 1-3 scoreless innings for the
victory. Stanley entered after Lee Smith left with a pulled groin
and took the loss, Boston's fourth straight defeat on opening say.
   The Orioles set a major league record last year for futility at
the start of the season. This time, Bush helped Baltimore beat
another Massachusetts rival. The president attended the game with
Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak.
   Clemens, 6-2 lifetime against the Orioles, left after Brady
Anderson led off the eighth inning with his second double. He
pitched seven innings, allowing seven hits and four runs, as he
earned his second no-decision in two opening-day starts.
   Cal Ripken's three-run homer in the sixth put Baltimore ahead
4-3. Anderson doubled, Phil Bradley walked and Ripken sent a 2-1
pitch over the left-field wall.
   Boston tied the score with a run in the seventh when Jody Reed
singled home Nick Esasky, who led off with a double and took third
on a ground out by Rich Gedman.
   Trailing 1-0, Boston scored three times in the sixth inning.
Dwight Evans' RBI double tied the score and Mike Greenwell hit a
two-run homer off starter Dave Schmidt.
   The Orioles took a 1-0 lead in the fourth when Anderson walked,
stole second and scored on a single by Joe Orsulak.
   Baltimore rookie Steve Finley had to leave the game after the
third inning after crashing into the wall in right-center field
after making a catch on Esasky's drive. X-rays on Finley showed a
sprained right shoulder.
   Wade Boggs, a five-time American League batting champion, went
2-for-4. The Red Sox have tried to trade him because of the
commotion his affair with Margo Adams caused, but have found no
takers.

   A strong earthquake shook the San
Francisco Peninsula on Monday, but there were no immediate reports
of injury or serious damage.
   ``I went outside and watched the windows rattle,'' said Marcey
Beaupre, manager of the Super Yarn Mart in nearby Santa Clara. ``I
got 20 windows and all they did was rattle. Nothing happened.''
   The U.S. Geological Survey set a preliminary magnitude of 5.0 on
the Richter scale for the temblor, while the University of
California's seismographic stations at Berkeley rated it at 4.4.
   A 5.0 quake is considered powerful enough to cause considerable
damage in populated areas.
   Witnesses reported a rolling quake lasting 15 to 20 seconds. It
was felt in most of the San Francisco Bay area, including as far
north at Petaluma and in the region south and east of San Jose.
   USGS spokeswoman Pat Jorgenson said the quake struck at 10:46
a.m. on the Calaveras Fault and was centered eight miles east of
Milpitas, about 50 miles southeast of San Francisco.
   ``We don't have any reports of major damage,'' said Vince
Montane, regional manager of the state Office of Emergency
Services. ``The cities and counties have called in with a few
instances of broken glass and plates falling off shelves and
pictures off the walls and that kind of thing.''
   A 100-square-foot pane of glass shattered in the control tower
at Reid-Hillview Airport, showering glass into the parking lot
three stories below. No injuries were reported.
   There were reports of telephone outages, but Pacific Bell
officials blamed it on overloaded circuits.
   April 18 is the anniversary of the great San Francisco
earthquake of 1906, which triggered fires which destroyed most of
the city.
   The open-ended Richter scale is a measure of the energy released
by an earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a
seisomograph.
   Each increase of one number, as in a jump from magnitude 5.5 to
6.5, means that the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of
3.5 can cause slight damage in populated areas, while a quake of
6.0 can cause severe damage. In March 1964 an earthquake in Alaska
hit 8.5 on the Richter scale, killing 114 people.

   The Justice Department's ethics office found
no basis to investigate an allegation that Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh planned to use a government computer for political
purposes, officials said Monday.
   The Office of Professional Responsibility conducted a
preliminary inquiry after an unidentified person alleged that last
fall, Thornburgh aides sought to compile a list of the attorney
general's contacts dating back to his days as Pennsylvania
governor, said David Runkel, a special assistant to the attorney
general.
   The OPR preliminary inquiry concluded there was no basis for
further investigation of the allegation that the names of 10,000 of
Thornburgh's political supporters from Pennsylvania would be placed
on the computerized mailing list, Runkel said.
   ``That had never been contemplated, suggested or planned,''
Runkel said.
   But the project has become a matter of dispute in the
department, where some employees jokingly dubbed it ``DICKPAC,''
reflecting concerns the computerized list would be misused for
political purposes, said a department source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Runkel said the plan, still under active consideration, was
merely ``to put the A.G.'s meeting and schedules on computers.''
   It is envisioned as a way to keep pertinent information about
the attorney general's contacts so that when Thornburgh ``meets
with a person he can say `We met last July and I know you were
interested in X, Y, Z,'' he said.
   ``There are a lot of people who communicate with the attorney
general,'' Runkel said. Some are from Pennsylvania and ``some
obviously are political supporters.''
   The OPR inquiry found ``there was nothing wrong'' with using
Justice Department computers to keep track of the people Thornburgh
meets, Runkel said.
   The brief report concluded ```Why are we wasting our time on
this stuff?''' said Runkel. It concluded ``this is a
misunderstanding by one person of what someone else said.''
   ``The whole complaint was based on a misunderstanding,'' Runkel
said. He declined to release the page-and-a-half document saying:
``It's an investigative report, we don't make it public.''
   The inquiry was conducted after Thornburgh aide Murray Dickman
asked the Office of Litigation Support in the civil division to
write a computer program for the project, said the department
source.
   The project created consternation in litigation support office,
where those involved feared it might be misused for political
purposes and violate the Justice Department's ethics guidelines
that prohibit use of government facilities for unofficial business,
said the source.
   John R. Bolton, the assistant attorney general in charge of the
civil division, confronted Dickman and Robert Ross Jr.,
Thornburgh's executive assistant, about the project after learning
of its existence, said the source.
   Runkel also took issue with this account, saying ``there was
never anything to suspend.''
   ``Civil got involved in this only because the computers up here
are hooked into the system it has ownership or has control over,''
Runkel said.
   Aides decided that division's litigation system known as AMICUS
was not a good idea, Runkel said.
   Runkel said aides concluded they could ``use it on some PC and
buy a $50 program and start plugging it in.''
   Bolton declined to comment. Dickman did not return a reporter's
telephone call.

   The prosecution and defense agreed Monday
that a man who killed six people in a shopping center rampage was
mentally ill. But the prosecutor said it was no excuse.
   Prosecutor Larry Holmes told jurors the evidence was so
overwhelming that William Cruse killed with premediation that Cruse
had no other choice but to plead innocent by reason of insanity.
   ``Mental illness was the motivator for the crime, not its
justification,'' said Holmes, arguing that mental illness is not
enough for acquittal under Florida law.
   Holmes's co-counsel, Assistant State Attorney Chris White,
argued that Cruse had acted out of anger, not illness.

in the rampage, the prosecutor added that Cruse had purchased ``the
perfect weapon for mass murder.''
   The defense contended that Cruse, 61, was driven by delusions
about homosexuality and was unable to control his actions when he
began shooting people at two shopping centers.
   Public defender Marlene Alva said Cruse was temporarily insane,
and therefore couldn't be convicted of premeditated, first-degree
murder.
   ``You have here before you a madman, a crazy person, someone who
went berserk on April 23, 1987,'' she said.
   Six people, including two policemen, were killed and 10 were
wounded in the bloody rampage in Palm Bay, on Florida's East Coast.
The state is seeking the death penalty on six counts of murder, 24
counts of attempted murder and two counts of kidnapping.
   After arguments by attorneys, the jury was to return Tuesday
morning for instructions by the judge before deliberating Cruse's
fate.
   Much of the morning Monday was spent in argument over whether to
admit testimony by Tampa forensic psychiatrist Robert Berland.
   Berland told the court out of the presence of the jury that
Cruse was so psychotically fearful of attack that he ``always
carried a gun ... always slept with a gun ... always kept a knife
ready for a quick draw.''
   White objected to the introduction of the testimony at this
point in the 4-week-old trial, saying much of the information had
been obtained by Berland in mid-March, after the trial started, and
from Cruse himself.
   Circuit Judge John Antoon overruled the objection on hearsay but
agreed the defense could have presented such findings earlier.
   To do so now, Antoon said, ``would give the defendant an unfair
advantage'' or would force the state to bring in other testimony
``and allow the war of experts to go on and on.''
   Four other psychiatrists and a psychologist testified,
disagreeing sharply on whether Cruse legally was temporarily insane
when he systematically picked off victim after victim at two
shopping centers.
   Under Florida's definition of temporary insanity, the defense
must show that Cruse not only was mentally ill, but did not know
the consequences of his actions or that they were wrong.

<HEAD>Hungarian Shoppers Invade Austria for Final Fling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungarians crossed the border in huge
numbers Monday to buy video equipment and other goods on a last
spree before their communist government raises the cost of bringing
the booty home.
   Austrian television said 300,000 shoppers visited Austria and
that 130,000 of them reached Vienna.
   Most Hungarian businesses were closed Monday, the eve of a
national holiday observed on the date Soviet soldiers liberated
Budapest from the Nazis in 1945.
   Cars were backed up more than 40 miles on the Hungarian side of
the frontier by midmorning, the Austrian Automobile and Touring
Club reported.
   On Saturday, Hungary's customs duties will rise from from 30
percent to 45, a special low rate of 15 percent for computers and
video machines will end and duty-free allowances will be reduced
sharply.
   Under current rules, each member of a family of four may bring
back duty-free goods worth $200 on each trip and the shares may be
combined to cover a major purchase. On Saturday, the per-person
allowance will be cut in half and no totaling will be allowed.
   Official figures in Budapest say Hungarians spent the equivalent
of about $600,000 in Austria between January 1988, when visa-free
travel to the West began, and Feburary of this year.
   How Hungarians acquire the necessary Austrian currency is not
clear, but some sources are the black market and relatives, friends
or other connections in the West.
   A similar rush of Hungarian customers, who can travel to the
West without visas as often as they want, was registered Nov. 7,
1988, when more than 100,000 Hungarians went shopping across the
border.
   On Monday, traffic was snarled in many parts of Burgenland,
Austria's easternmost province, and thousands of Hungarian cars
contributed to the usual congestion in Vienna.
   A policeman in Burgenland, who asked that his name not be used,
described it as a ``madhouse.'' A radio reporter described the
congestion there as ``hardly imaginable.''
   In Vienna's Mariahilferstrasse, a favorite shopping street,
Hungarians lined up at 6 a.m. outside closed stores that sell video
machines, other electronic equipment and household appliances.
   An Associated Press reporter saw at least 23 Hungarian buses
parked near Mariahilferstrassse. Scores of Hungarians were seen
carrying everything from color television sets to computers,
refrigerators and stereo equipment.
   A storekeeper said business was three times normal. A large shoe
store advertised products in both German and Hungarian.
   Reports said Hungarians arrived in Zurndorf at 2 a.m., parked
their cars everywhere and roused the village, so the outraged
residents went on strike and kept their children home from school.

<HEAD>Soviet Economists Debating Convertible Ruble Backed by Gold, Goods</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading Soviet economist said Monday that
officials are debating establishment of a second currency that
would be convertible and backed by gold, foreign currency reserves
and export goods.
   Abel Aganbegyan, secretary of the economics department of the
Academy of Sciences, said the special-purpose ruble would be issued
in amounts large enough to facilitate foreign trade, which is now
hampered by the Soviet Union's shortage of hard currency.
   It could be tied in with proposals to create special foreign
trade zones on the Finnish border and in the Soviet Far East, where
foreign firms would enjoy tariff, tax and other benefits, he said.
   He noted that the ``gold ruble,'' as some have called the
proposed currency, is still just an idea, and is opposed by some
Soviet economists. He alluded to the fact that it would have to be
accepted by the major Western banks to work.
   Pepsico Chairman Donald Kendall, speaking at the same news
conference, said that some companies would buy a hard ruble and
some would not, ``but I'd certainly rather have a gold-backed ruble
than the one we have now.''
   Pepsico is one of the Soviet Union's major trading partners,
exchanging Pepsi for Stolichnaya vodka.
   The second currency would be an interim step while the Soviet
Union is trying to bring the regular ruble closer to
convertibility, Aganbegyan said.
   Officials say that may take a decade or more, as the Soviet
Union now has little to sell on world markets and the official
exchange rate of $1.60 to the ruble is far too high. In comparison,
the black market rate is 10-25 cents per ruble.

   A train that may have been speeding
derailed as it entered the station in this southern city Monday,
wrecking the bar and a ticket booth and killing at least five
people, officials reported.
   Two coaches slammed into the station wall, causing the bar to
collapse and demolishing the ticket booth and the freight and
baggage section, the reports said.
   A national police official in San Severo said five bodies had
been found and 16 injured people were hospitalized. The officer,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the death toll could rise
because rescue workers still were searching the rubble.
   He said it was not clear whether the casualties had been on the
train or in the station, but the news agency AGI said the station
manager was among the dead.
   Smoke poured from holes in the coaches as workers helped pull
the wounded out. Other rescuers used dogs to search in the debris.
   Railroad authorities said it appeared the train was going faster
than the customary speed of about 18 mph when it entered the
station, Italian news agencies reported.
   The eight-car train arrived Monday afternoon in San Severo, 135
miles southeast of Rome, from the Tyrrhenian port of Bari, and had
been scheduled to return.

   The United States announced new measures to
combat sky terrorism Monday as relatives of passengers killed in
the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing mounted a high-profile campaign to
complain about aviation security and the government's ``lack of
compassion'' following the disaster.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, who along with
President Bush met with several relatives of those killed in the
explosion over Scotland, told a news conference that airlines will
be required to install devices to detect plastic explosives in
major U.S. and foreign airports.
   Relatives of victims in the Dec. 21 explosion over Scotland,
which has been blamed on a plastic device hidden in a
radio-cassette player, praised Bush for concern shown in the
meeting and said Skinner's announcement was a good first step.
   But spokesman Bert Ammerman of Demarest, N.J., told a rally
across the street from the White House that measures announced by
Skinner were ``not enough.''
   Ammerman, whose brother Tom was one of 270 victims of the crash,
asked for a unified congressional investigation of the disaster,
hand-searching of all luggage put aboard airliners, and an end to a
system that allows notification only of airline, airport and
government security personnel when there's a terrorist threat.
   Skinner said he would recommend against a coordinated
congressional inquiry, although Bush told the relatives he would
consider pressing for such a probe as opposed to several separate
congressional investigations. Skinner said the FBI and Scotland
Yard were best qualified to conduct the criminal investigation, and
there is no indication government response to the explosion has
been inadequate.
   Meantime, CBS News, quoting unidentified intelligence sources,
said new anti-American attacks may be coming. The television
network said the group that is believed to have been involved in
the bombing of Flight 103 is planning new attacks on American
targets.
   CBS said a terrorist coalition is plotting revenge attacks in
about 10 days, which would be the third anniversary of the U.S.
bombing of Tripoli and the headquarters of Libyan leader, Col.
Gadhafi. The Libyan Secret Service has asked three terrorist groups
to design the attacks _ the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command; Abu Nidel, one of world's most infamous
terrorists, and the Japanese Red Army, CBS said.
   The transportation secretary, in his announcement, also ordered
airlines to acknowledge all Federal Aviation Administration
security bulletins within 24 hours. He said compliance would be
mandatory.
   Such bulletins tell airlines of possible threats, and sometimes
recommend steps that can be taken to avert them. In the past, such
recommendations generally have been advisory.
   Skinner said the government would help negotiate for the
installation in foreign airports of the latest thermal neutron
analysis equipment _ which can detect plastic explosives _ but
airlines would have to pay the cost, estimated at up to $100
million or more to cover major airports.
   Skinner gave no timetable for installing the devices. An FAA
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it could take
years to get all of the units installed.
   The government has plans to install six such devices, which cost
nearly $1 million each, in various airports before the end of the
year. Skinner said cost of the equipment likely would add between
20 cents and a dollar to each airline ticket.
   Additional FAA security specialists were being sent to the
busiest U.S. and foreign airports to aid in surveillance, Skinner
said. He also announced that the FAA will propose changes in
security programs to require state-of-the-art X-ray and
metal-detection equipment in airports and to require that airline
pilots get ``appropriate security information.''
   More than 150 relatives and friends of Flight 103 victims
gathered in a church near the White House for prayers, poetry
reading and songs remembering loved ones killed in the explosion
103 days ago over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   The relatives have complained that the administration gave them
little information or comfort after the bombing.
   The group said neither former President Reagan nor Bush called
any family members to offer personal condolences to any family
members of those aboard the flight.
   Paul Hudson of Albany, N.Y., who lost his 16-year-old daughter
Melina, said that relatives of hostage victims told Bush pointblank
that they thought the government failed to respond adequately.
   ``The opinion of the group was absolute outrage at the lack of
compassion, the incompetence, and frankly, the embarrassment that
we suffered with our State Department services,'' Hudson said. ``We
had to deal with foreign governments as an organization, and
individually, virtually alone, and we have heard from other victims
of terrorist actions that we are not the first to have experienced
this. The president assured us that this sort of thing would be
corrected.''
   Following the session, a White House statement said Bush had
``expressed his sorrow and deep concern'' about the incident and
termed the meeting ``sensitive, solemn and productive.''
   At the church, relatives wearing tags with the names of loved
ones killed in the bombing and pins saying ``the truth must be
known,'' wept as they sang ``On Eagle's Wings,'' a hymn.
   ``We want a full investigation,'' said George Williams,
Joppatowne, Md., whose 24-year-old son Geordie died in the crash
while en route home for Christmas from a military assignment. ``I
don't care who forgets it, but I will not forget it.''
   Bob Monetti said relatives organized their group to support each
other through a sorrowful time, to help make air travel safer and
to push for more effective federal policy in combatting air
terrorism. Monetti lost his son, Rick, a 20-year-old journalism
student at Syracuse University.
   Elizabeth Dix of London, whose husband Peter died aboard the
plane, represented a group of British relatives who organized on
Saturday. The group is trying to raise $2.5 million for a reward to
catch the bombers.
   ``We are troubled by the silence,'' said Mrs. Dix. ``We don't
feel the governments involved have been sensitive to this
disaster.''
   The flight which originated in Frankfurt, West Germany, with a
different airliner, blew up over Lockerbie en route from London to
New York.

<HEAD>Westinghouse's President Promises Safe Restart At Savannah River
Site</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM STRONG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AIKEN, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Westinghouse Electric Co. began its first
full week of operations at the Savannah River nuclear weapons plant
Monday by conceding the difficulty of the task it faces.
   But officials at Westinghouse, the world's largest builder of
commercial nuclear power plants, expressed confidence they would be
able to gain public confidence and restart three idle reactors at
the problem-plagued plant.
   On Saturday, E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. ended 38 years as
operator of the nation's largest nuclear weapons facility, turning
the plant over to Westinghouse Savannah River Co., a subsidiary of
the Pittsburgh-based parent.
   ``We've been convinced that ... we can make this a model of
excellence,'' Westinghouse Savannah River Co. President James S.
Moore said at a news conference Monday.
   The Savannah River Plant, which Westinghouse renamed the
Savannah River Site, is the nation's only source of tritium, a
highly radioactive gas used at other government defense plants to
make nuclear warheads.
   The three active nuclear reactors at the plant have been shut
down for nearly a year because of safety and structural problems,
and a series of mishaps in recent months has raised doubts about
whether improvements are likely anytime soon.
   Moore said a new name and freshly painted signs at the
300-square-mile complex near Aiken will not erase the facility's
troubled history.
   ``Our first task now that transition is over is to enhance the
public trust and, obviously, (ensure) a safe restart of the
reactors,'' said Moore, whose company has a five-year contract.
``The ultimate way to gain trust is to perform. Actions speak
louder than words.''
   He stressed that Westinghouse would not jeopardize safety for
production.
   ``We are not putting production ahead of safety, even if they
tell us to,'' he said, referring to the federal government.
   The Pentagon has said that unless at least one of the reactors
is restarted by the end of the year it might have to deactivate
some warheads to preserve supplies of tritium.
   Moore said a clause in the company's contract with the
Department of Energy ``allows me to go directly to (DOE)
headquarters if I feel I'm being told to do something contrary to
what we believe is right or safe.''
   ``My view is that if I have to do that, I've failed on my job
because I've failed to communicate with my customer here at the
site.''
   Moore also said he would shut down the reactors if the Energy
Department asked for more tritium than could be produced safely in
the alotted time.
   The DOE has tied the amount of money Westinghouse will be paid
to how well it performs.

<HEAD>Government Media Denounces Reports On Iraqi Nuclear Programs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government media on Monday denounced
reports in the American press saying Iraq plans to produce nuclear
warheads.
   Front page editorials in three state-run newspapers accused
Israel of orchestrating a campaign that they said was aimed at
``defaming Iraq and influencing the peace talks with Iran.'' Iran
and Iraq agreed to a cease-fire in August that ended their
eight-year-old war.
   The papers did not specifically deny the reports about nuclear
weapons.
   Last week, the Washington Post said Iraq has embarked on a crash
program to produce a nuclear warhead within two years.
   An Israeli general said Sunday there was some basis to reports
that Iraq is engaged in an effort to build nuclear warheads for
missiles that could reach Israel.
   Maj. Gen. Ehud Barak, deputy armed forces chief of staff, in an
interview on Israeli Television, was asked about the Washington
Post report and he said, ``Iraq has not abandoned its aim to reach
nuclear capability. As far as I know, these reports have at least a
nucleus of truth.''
   Iraq's government-owned Al-Joumhouriya newspaper said the
reports were leaked by Israeli officials to the U.S. media to
distract world public opinion from the Palestinian uprising in the
Israeli-occupied territories and to pave the way for new attacks
against Iraqi nuclear installations.
   ``If the aim is to frighten Iraq and launch a pre-emptive strike
... you should understand that Iraq is fully alert and will be
ready to answer back with all the potential at its disposal,'' the
newspaper said.
   Israeli warplanes destroyed Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor in
1981.
   The ruling Baath Party's Al-Thawra newspaper said the American
press ignored Israel's nuclear weapons program while spreading lies
about the alleged danger of Iraq's nuclear program.
   Al-Qadissiya, the army newspaper, said any Israeli action would
be dealt with in ``an appropriate way.''
   ``They will get nothing but humiliation, disgrace and
destruction,'' it said.

   Democrat Richard M. Daley worked Chicago's
``Magnificent Mile'' on Monday while his chief rival in Tuesday's
mayoral election campaigned with Jesse Jackson in a final bid to
retain black control of City Hall.
   Daley, whose iron-fisted father ruled Chicago for 21 years, is
widely favored to win the race in the nation's third largest city.
   Alderman Timothy Evans, an independent and the lone black in the
race, campaigned at a South Side housing project, where Jackson
invoked the memory of Dr. Martin Luther King, the civil rights
leader murdered 21 years ago.
   ``April 4th, 1968, Dr. King was killed,'' Jackson said. ``Did
not our hearts bleed? April 4, 1968, our backs were against the
wall. Bowed down heads, broken hearts, people rioting.
   ``Well, April 4th, 1989, no more riots and despair; voting and
hope, voting and hope,'' he repeated, leading a chant of those last
three words.
   Earlier, Daley donned a hard hat at a construction site,
appropriate head gear as he started the the final day of
campaigning and his opponents prepared their last shots.
   Tuesday's winner will complete the last two years of the late
Mayor Harold Washington's second term. Washington, the city's first
black mayor suffered a fatal heart attack in November 1987.
   Daley, who defeated acting Mayor Eugene Sawyer in the Feb. 28
Democratic primary, faces Evans and Republican Edward Vrdolyak, a
former Democrat who hasn't won elective office since switching
parties in 1987.
   While Evans, 45, who is running on the Harold Washington Party
ticket, and Vrdolyak, 51, spent quiet mornings, Daley made his way
to the construction site along downtown Michigan Avenue's
``Magnificent Mile'' shopping strip.
   ``Hey Rich! Good seeing you. Good luck tomorrow,'' called iron
worker and former Daley neighbor Jim Crowley, 24.
   Daley smiled and shook hands, signing a hard hat for Greg
Engelman, a superintendent. Engelman said he also had a hat signed
by Daley's father, Richard J. Daley, mayor from 1955 until his
death in 1976.
   Daley's father ran a patronage army, and despite later court
rulings limiting city hiring and firing for political reasons,
Evans has often invoked the name of the late Daley in warning that
his son would bring back ``machine politics'' to serve only the
well-connected.
   ``It's all rhetoric,'' Daley said Monday in an interview on
WGN-AM. He has often promised an open government and said that as
Cook County state's attorney since 1980, he has run a non-political
shop.
   The latest poll results, released Monday by The Daily Chicago
Southtown Economist and WBBM-TV, gave Daley 51 percent to 35
percent for Evans and 3 percent for Vrdolyak.
   The telephone poll of 918 registered voters, with an error
margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points, showed 8 percent
undecided, most of them black in a city where the voting population
is 48 percent white, 42 percent black and 7 percent Hispanic.
   Sawyer lost to Daley by more than 100,000 votes in the primary
partly because of low black turnout that many blamed on the battle
he and Evans waged to succeed Washington. Sawyer, a black South
Side alderman, was selected to be acting mayor by fellow City
Council members. Tuesday's election was ordered by the state
Supreme Court.
   The city elections board estimated that 70 percent of Chicago's
1.56 million voters would go to the polls on a day the National
Weather Service said would be windy and cold with the threat of
rain.
   Daley won the endorsement of Chicago's two largest daily
newspapers and has a campaign fund reported at about $6 million.

hunger strikes to protest their detention without trial were
released from custody Monday, a lawyer said.
   The three were freed from St. Aidan's Hospital, where they had
been treated for the effects of their fast, said attorney Dhaya
Pillay.
   Miss Pillay said one of the men, Sandile Thusi, had refused to
eat for 38 days _ the longest fast of more than 500 detainees held
without trial who have staged hunger strikes since January.
   The attorney said Thusi was placed under restrictions that
require him to report to police twice a day and bar him from
talking to the news media or leaving his house from dusk to dawn.
   She identified the two other men freed as Isaac Nzuza and Paulos
Mvulana but did not say if they were placed under restrictive
orders.
   South Africa's white-dominated government says it has released
almost 600 detainees since the hunger strikes began. Human rights
groups say about 250 people who have not been charged remain
imprisoned and many of the others freed were placed under severe
restrictions.
   An estimated 30,000 people, almost all blacks, have been
detained for varying lengths of time during the 33-month-old state
of emergency.

<HEAD>Drnovsek Will Become Yugoslavia's New President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Janez Drnovsek, a 38-year-old
Slovenian economist, will become communist Yugoslavia's first
directly elected president next month.
   Drnovsek, a member of the federal parliament virtually unknown
outside Slovenia, defeated Marko Bulc, 62, who is president of the
republic's trade chamber, in elections Sunday for Slovenia's
representative to the largely ceremonial collective presidency.
   Under Yugoslavia's rotating system, the six republics and two
provinces each have a representative in the presidency and take
turns leading the nation's top body.
   This time it is Slovenia's turn, and Drnovsek takes over in
mid-May from Raif Dizdarevic of Bosnia. The ninth seat in the
presidency is reserved for the Communist Party chief.
   The economist won 56 percent of votes and Bulc 41 percent,
according to unofficial results quoted by the official Tanjug news
agency.
   By government count, 87.5 percent of Slovenia's 1.47 million
registered voters took part.
   President Josip Broz Tito created the rotating presidency to
avoid power struggles after his death and prevent the emergence of
a dominant leader who could disturb the country's ethnic balance.
   Slovenia has led the drive for more democracy in this
single-party state and has allowed several non-communist, human
rights and political groups to function freely.
   It also has allowed a Social Democratic Union, which claims to
be Yugoslavia's first independent political party since the
communists took power after World War II.
   Drnovsek, who will become Yugoslavia's youngest president, is a
doctor of economic sciences who worked in several Yugoslav
companies and banks as well as in the diplomatic service.
   He reportedly has specialized in his country's economic matters
and monetary and credit policies.
   Drnovsek is a strong supporter of the drive to have non-aligned
Yugoslavia join the European Economic Community.
   Bulc and Drnovsek remained in the Slovenian race from six
original candidates after a complicated election system began at
grassroot levels.
   Previously, members of the presidency were elected by republican
legislatures that gave rubber-stamp approval to single candidates
picked by the Communist Party.
   The southern republic of Montenegro will choose its
representative among three candidates in an April 9 ballot. The
other republics namd their members through the old system.
   Slovenian candidates were involved in a Western-style campaign
of speeches and television debates in which they faced probing
questions and had to defend their programs.
   Both candidates called for radical market-oriented reforms to
overcome the country's deep economic crisis, which includes 400
percent annual inflation and a $21 billion foreign debt.

<HEAD>U.N. Investigators Report Major Border Crossing by SWAPO</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.N. investigators have found that
guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's Organization mounted a
major invasion from Angola into Namibia over the weekend, according
to diplomats.
   The findings of the U.N. investigators were relayed to
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, who briefed Security
Council members, said three senior diplomats from Western nations,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Their findings were incorporated into a report the U.N. chief
presented to the Security Council on Monday evening under unusually
heavy security.
   More than 1,000 SWAPO guerrillas infiltrated northern Namibia,
but their motive was not known, said the diplomats.
   Since fighting broke out Saturday, 129 SWAPO guerrillas and 18
Namibian territorial police have been killed, according to
Namibia's police force.
   South Africa says the SWAPO rebels infiltrated Namibia from
southern Angola; SWAPO officials say their men were already in the
country and only fired in self-defense.
   Publicly, U.N. officials scrupulously avoided making any comment
that might be interpreted as blaming one side or the other.
   But SWAPO's foreign secretary, Theo-Ben Gurirab, castigated the
world body for allowing South African military units to reinforce
territorial police in their battle against the guerrillas.
   ``Our people are being butchered under the United Nations
flag,'' said Gurirab.
   He spoke as the 15 members of the Security Council met privately
to hear the report on the clashes.
   Part of the mission of the U.N. Transition Assistance Group was
to see that guerrillas of the South West Africa People's
Organization were confined to bases in Angola and Zambia, and make
sure no one infiltrated Namibia.
   However, only about 1,000 members of UNTAG, which was envisioned
to have a full strength of 4,650 peacekeepers, were in Namibia by
Friday night, when gun battles broke out between SWAPO rebels and
territorial police.
   ``UNTAG is not yet fully in Namibia,'' Perez de Cuellar said.
``We have 300 men in the northern part of the area. You cannot say
it is a failure.''
   Perez de Cuellar's report in January to the Security Council on
UNTAG's mission recommended 4,650 peacekeepers, but also asked for
authority to send as many as 7,500 if the situation required more
soldiers.
   The bulk of the troops are expected to arrive during April,
bringing the force to nearly full strength by the end of the month.
   Undersecretary-General Marrack Goulding, the U.N.'s chief
peacekeeping official, was dispatched to Luanda, Angola, to meet
with Angolan officials and with three U.N. peacekeepers who
investigated the weekend clashes.
   Goulding was expected to arrive in Luanda on Tuesday.
   A Western diplomat involved in the negotiations that led up to
the independence plan for Namibia said SWAPO argued throughout that
it had fighters in the country who should be allowed to maintain
U.N.-supervised barracks in Namibia on the same basis as South
Africa.
   ``Possibly they were trying to get men in at the 11th hour to
bolster their argument that they had them in Namibia, and therefore
they should have bases in the country,'' said the diplomat,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Until Saturday, the United Nations recognized SWAPO as the
legitimate representative of the Namibian people.
   With the inauguration of the U.N.-supervised independence plan,
the United Nations recognized SWAPO as one political force among
many contending for power in Namibia, and was to remain impartial.

   A ``brilliant blue'' object with a streaking
yellow tail that was seen rocketing across Colorado skies Monday
may have been a rare daytime meteorite, a planetarium spokeswoman
said.
   ``From all the details we have been able to get, it sounds like
it was a meteorite,'' said Suzy Gurton, program supervisor at Fiske
Planetarium in Boulder.
   ``We haven't been able to determine yet whether it landed or
exploded before it hit the earth,'' she said.
   Reported sightings of the object filtered into atmospheric and
space-related agencies shortly after noon from metropolitan Denver,
Salida in south-central Colorado, and Garden City and Salinas in
Kansas.
   ``We got lots of calls on it. It doesn't correlate with anything
we're tracking,'' said Capt. Thomas Neiman, a spokesman for the
North American Defense Command near Colorado Springs.
   NORAD, which tracks about 7,000 objects in space, received calls
about the object from Federal Aviation Administration officials at
Longmont and from Scott Air Force Base in Illinois, Neiman said.
   A spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration in Boulder said he received a query about the object
from Salinas, Kan.
   Gurton said one of the people who contacted the planetarium said
the object had ``brilliant blue color for the head. ... There was a
yellow tail streaking behind it.''
   She said the witnesses indicated it was traveling north, but
``where it landed, we don't know.''
   In Salida, witnesses said there was a loud boom and the object
appeared to burst into flame.
   Gurton said it is fairly unusual to see a meteor in the daytime.
   ``It doesn't happen often anywhere,'' she said.
   Planetarium officials were attempting to pinpoint where the
meteorite may have landed by tracking the reports they received,
she said.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir indicated Tuesday
that during his U.S. visit he will state his opposition to
President Bush's call for an end to Israeli occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip and his endorsement of an international peace
conference.
   ``My position on all these issues is known. I'll have something
to discuss with the leaders of the United States,'' Shamir said as
he left for a 10-day visit to the United States.
   ``We shall insist that negotiations be held within a reasonable
framework, and be conducted directly and without preconditions,''
he said.
   ``We are looking for the right solutions ... for the problems we
are facing. I hope that the leaders of the United States will find
an interest in our proposals, (and) there are some proposals,'' he
said at Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv.
   Bush, speaking Monday after meeting in Washington with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, called for a ``properly structured''
Middle East peace conference _ a concept which Shamir opposes.
   ``Egypt and the United States share the goals of security for
Israel, end of the occupation and achievement of Palestinian
political rights,'' Bush said.
   Shortly before Shamir's departure, about 500 hundred activists
from the anti-war group Peace Now marched through downtown
Jerusalem to Shamir's residence with burning torches.
   They shouted slogans such as ``Talk with the PLO'' and ``Two
states for two peoples.''
   ``It's very important that (Shamir) takes into account that a
large segment of the Israeli public sees this special time as an
historic opportunity to achieve peace with the Palestinians,'' said
Tazli Reshef, a leader of Peace Now.
   Arguments broke out with right-wing counter-demonstrators, and
Israel radio said five right-wingers were arrested for disturbing
the march.
   Shamir has repeatedly rejected an international conference,
saying it would resu lt in other countries ganging up on Israel and
forcing it to yield land that Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc
maintains is an inextricable part of Israel.
   Finance Minister Shimon Peres of the Labor Party, Shamir's rival
in the coalition government, supports an international conference
and territorial concessions. He said Israel had to take the lead in
peacemaking or suffer a further loss of support in the United
States.
   ``It's clear we have real losses in U.S. public opinion, and the
American public opinion is one of our most important political
assets,'' he said on Israel army radio.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, a close Shamir ally, said in a
radio interview he did not expect American pressure to change
Shamir's opposition to talks with the PLO or the establishment of
an independent Palestinian state.
   Yossi Ben Aharon, Shamir's chief of staff, indicated Shamir was
willing to listen to U.S. proposals for easing tensions in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, such as freeing some of about 5,000
Palestinians held in Israeli jails.
   ``We have no problem with such measures as long as they are not
one-sided, which would compound the problem and give the impression
we were knuckling under to pressure,'' he said.
   On the other hand, Ben Aharon said in an interview, ``we don't
need sermons'' on the conduct of Israeli soldiers.
   Ben Aharon said Shamir was taking with him some new ideas ``but
not a blueprint'' for Middle East peace. He stressed that while
Israel was willing to be flexible on some points it would not
accept even an indirect dialogue with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Among the proposals is one for elections in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip to choose Palestinian representatives for
negotiations with Israel on autonomy for the 1.7 million Arabs.
   However, prominent Palestinians said in interviews the election
proposal would be unacceptable as long as Israel refused to commit
itself to ending the occupation and declined to deal with the PLO
or accept a Palestinian state.
   ``We know that Shamir who was an obstructionist throughout his
life cannot deliver any of these things,'' said Saeb Erakat, a
political science professor at An Najah University in the West Bank.
   ``He will take old ideas in new cans, under new labels,'' said
Erakat, who predicted there would be a new flareup in the nearly
16-month-old uprising if progress was not made soon in peace
efforts.
   Hanna Siniora, editor of the pro-PLO daily Al Fajr newspaper,
said Palestinians would not agree to elections unless Israel
withdrew its troops and turned over control to U.N. peacekeeping
forces.

<HEAD>British Officials Mistake Pet Reproduction For Animal Attraction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attempt by an advertising agency to ship
videotapes called ``Sex Talk'' and ``Tiger'' to the Cannes Film
Festival prompted British officials to bar them as pornography.
   In fact, the tapes were television ads prepared for the
Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
encouraging pet owners to neuter their dogs and cats.
   But customs officers at London's Heathrow International Airport
mistook the messages on pet reproduction for films of animal
attraction, a spokeswoman for the ad agency said Monday.
   Regina Ryan of Cosmopulous, Crowley &amp; Daly, said the tapes and
two others were intercepted March 16 on their way to the
international film festival in Cannes, France, which is later in
the spring.
   The festival awards prizes and has a category for public service
announcements, Ms. Ryan said. Entry rules require each submission
to have the name of the piece and its length clearly marked on the
package.
   The other spots were Liberty Mutual Insurance Co.'s ``Buried
Treasure'' about the risk of drunk driving, and the Salvation
Army's ``Places to Eat,'' about hunger and homelessness. But
British Customs evidently took one look at the ``Sex Talk'' label
and decided to send it all back where it came from.
   An agent in London notified the Cosmopulous agency and
repackaged tapes stating their destination were sent just in time
for Cannes' March 18 deadline, Ms. Ryan said.
   ``After all this, I hope we win,'' she said.

   Hundreds of marchers protesting plans to
build a nuclear power plant clashed with police in the western city
of Poznan, and the government said 17 policemen were injured.
   A spokesman for the Solidarity Information Service blamed police
for Sunday's violence. He said officers blocked exit routes from a
rally and beat several hundred marchers.
   ``SIS is of the opinion that the incident occurred as the result
of the attitude of police which made it impossible for
demonstrators to disperse peacefully,'' said Wojciech Maziarski, a
spokesman in Warsaw for the service, which publicizes information
on opposition activities.
   The state-run PAP news agency said, ``Groups of youths acting
under the slogan of protecting the environment committed hooligan
acts by throwing stones, screws and benches at law enforcement
forces.''
   PAP said 17 officers were injured, one had to be taken to a
hospital and five police vehicles were damaged. It did not report
any arrests or injuries.
   Maziarski said about 2,000 people joined in the march protesting
plans to construct a nuclear power station at Klempicz, a city
about 30 miles northwest of Poznan.
   The plant, to be built by the year 2000, would be Poland's
second nuclear power station. The first is under construction in
Zarnowiec on the Baltic coast, and is to be finished in two years.

<HEAD>One of Every Nine People in U.S. Is A Californian</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 150-year-old rush to live in the
Golden State has swelled the population to 28.3 million, making one
of every nine people in the nation a Californian, researchers said
Monday.
   The population estimate for the fiscal year ending last July 1,
up a record 662,000 over the year before, places the nation's most
populous state more than 10 million people ahead of the next
largest state, New York, with 17.8 million, said officials in the
state Finance Department's Demographic Research Unit.
   ``We just have too much to offer everyone, I guess,'' said John
Malson, a manager in the unit.
   The migration of people into California, which started with the
Gold Rush of 1849, outstripped the number who left in 1987-88,
adding 372,000 to the population and accounting for 56 percent of
the overall increase, he said.
   The gain through migration, though a continuing trend, was the
greatest of modern times, exceeded only by the fluctuations due to
World War II, Malson said. The previous year's gain was 366,000.
   The other 44 percent in population growth was due to a greater
number of births than deaths, he said. Births totaled 504,000;
deaths, 215,000.
   California's 28.3 million total population was up 2.4 percent
over the 27.6 million on July 1, 1987.

<TEXT>
   A judge on Monday revoked his
predecessor's order for the release of three alleged members of a
kidnapping ring involving military officers.
   Judge Ricardo Mejia Angulo of the 3rd Criminal Court told
journalists he voided a ruling issued Friday afternoon by Judge
Hector Larios. Mejia Angulo's action, which included a new order
for the provisional detention of the three, began to calm outrage
vented following Larios' surprise order.
   ``The genie is back in the bottle,'' a high-ranking U.S.
diplomat said in an interview. The United States, which provides El
Salvador about $1.5 million a day in aid, was upset by Larios'
order.
   Washington considers prosecution of the kidnapping ring case a
top priority in establishing a viable judicial system in this
country.
   The kidnappers, masquerading as leftist guerrillas, abducted
five wealthy businessmen for ransom between 1980 and 1985.
   Larios, minutes before leaving his post as the head of the 3rd
Criminal Court, ruled that Maj. Alfredo Jimenez Moreno, former Lt.
Rodolfo Lopez Sibrian and wealthy farmer Orlando Llovera Balette
should be released.
   President-elect Alfredo Cristiani of the rightist Republican
Nationalist Alliance party, or Arena, is to meet Friday in
Washington with President Bush.
   Diplomatic sources said Cristiani called U.S. Ambassador William
Walker late Friday to inform him of Larios' order. Cristiani, who
won the March 19 presidential election by a wide margin over the
candidate of the incumbent Christian Democrats, was described as
incensed by Larios' move.
   Some Arena leaders, including cashiered army Maj. Roberto
d'Aubuisson, have been linked to death squads and other rights
abuses in the early 1980s.
   Llovera, Lopez Sibrian and Jimenez, as well as others implicated
in the kidnapping ring, are former friends and associates of
d'Aubuisson, who is an Arena legislator.
   The U.S. source, who commented on condition of anonymity, said
the case was Cristiani's first human rights test as president-elect.
   ``He passed with flying colors,'' said the diplomat.
   Jose Guerrero, president of the Supreme Court, told journalists
that Larios, who transferred to a Civil Court post Monday, has been
suspended pending investigation of his ruling regarding the alleged
kidnappers.
   Larios had ruled that the three had been arrested in 1986 under
emergency legislation no longer in effect, making their detentions
illegal.
   Only Llovera was released. His whereabouts were unknown Monday.
The release order concerning the other two men was not implemented
before Mejia Angulo's action.
   The judge also issued new arrest warrants, replacing those
cancelled by Larios, for five other people allegedly involved in
the ring.
   The ring, in which at least two fugitive military officers are
implicated, was broken in 1986, when Llovera, Jimenez and Lopez
Sibrian were arrested.
   Lopez Sibrian was expelled from the armed forces. Jimenez
remains in the army, though under arrest.
   The case has not gone to trial.

   A tornado touched down in southern Illinois on Monday and
thunderstorms crackled over Missouri. Snow continued to fall on the
Colorado Rockies, where ski resorts boasted that winter had
returned.
   The mayor of Fargo, N.D., declared a state of emergency as
floodwaters continued to rise on the raging Red River. The
declaration clears the way for construction of temporary dikes and
the leasing of pumps.
   The Red River and other rivers and creeks in the eastern end of
North Dakota rose rapidly over the weekend because of ice jams,
runoff and rain. Light rain continued to fall Monday.
   A tornado watch was posted over much of southern Illinois and
parts of Missouri, Kentucky and Arkansas. In Grayville, Ill., a
tornado snapped trees and utility poles and overturned cars and
trucks.
   There also were reports of hail the size of golfballs and
baseballs in Grayville, a town of 2,000 on the Indiana border.
   A severe thunderstorm watch was posted for much of central
Missouri and a small portion of western Illinois. Golfball-size
hail fell near Flowery Branch, Ga., Osawatomie, Kan., and Drexel,
Versailles, Owensville and Red Bud, all in Missouri.
   Wind advisories were posted for California's Antelope Valley,
the Mojave Desert and a portion of the central mountains of
California. Winds gusted to 55 mph at Mojave, Calif., during the
morning.
   Nine inches of snow fell at Winter Park, Colo., between 11 p.m.
Sunday and dawn Monday. Snowfall in other Colorado ski areas since
Sunday included 18 inches at Breckenridge, 16 inches at Loveland
and 15 inches at Beaver Creek.
   Colorado ski resorts capitalized on the fresh snowfall by
touting mid-winter skiing conditions. Fifteen resorts reported
powder snow.
   There also were snowshowers at the higher elevations of
Vermont's mountains, but accumulations were less than an inch.
   Rain reached from New England across New York state and northern
Pennsylvania by mid afternoon. Rain and occasional thunderstorms
extended from northeast Georgia across central Alabama, from
central Illinois across the northern Missouri and eastern Kansas,
over southeastern South Dakota, northern Wisconsin and central
Minnesota. Rain over eastern and central North Dakota changed to
snow over northwestern North Dakota and northeast Montana. Snow
also fell over west-central Montana.
   The lowest temperature in the nation Monday morning was 6
degrees below zero at Yellowstone, Wyo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 27
degrees at Evanston, Wyo., to 97 degrees at Cotulla, Texas.
   The National Weather Service forecast for Tuesday called for
rain and thunderstorms from Mississippi and the Florida panhandle
across Georgia, from the Carolinas and eastern Tennessee across the
Ohio Valley and Pennsylvania; rainshowers from New Jersey across
New England and New York state, and over lower Michigan, Wisconsin
and southeast Minnesota; snow or snow mixed with rain over
northeast Minnesota and upper Michigan, with snow over western
Montana changing to rain over Idaho and northern Utah. Rain was
forecast along the northern Pacific Coast.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 40s over northern
Maine, from northern Michigan across Wisconsin, northern Illinois,
the upper Mississippi Valley, eastern South Dakota, much of North
Daota and from northwest Montana into northeast Washington state;
in the 50s and 60s from central Maine across Maryland and Delaware,
the lower Great Lakes, the Ohio Valley, western Tennessee, the
central Mississippi Valley, Arkansas and from the remainder of the
northern Plains across Oklahoma and the Texas panhandle, and from
the upper Missouri Valley across northern New Mexico, the Rockies,
the Great Basin and the northern half of the Pacific Coast; and
into the 90s over the desert Southwest. High temperatures over the
remainder of the nation generally were expected to be in the 60s
and 70s.

   Nicaraguan rebels will observe a
unilateral cease-fire until February, when the Sandinista
government is to hold general elections, a source in the rebels'
directorate said Monday.
   The source, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said
Commander Enrique Bermudez told the rebels about the decision
during visits Friday to their camps on the Honduran side of the
border with Nicaragua. Bermudez is the chief military leader of the
rebels, known as Contras.
   Radio Liberacion, the Contras' radio station, broadcast on
Monday a message from Bermudez that said: ``The rebels will not
launch any attack against the Sandinistas until February 1990. We
will not look for combat but will permanently be on the defensive.
   ``The rebel army will be preserved intact, on the defense and
watching for the Sandinistas to fulfill their promise of greater
democracy for Nicaragua.''
   Nicaragua's left-wing government has declared monthly unilateral
cease-fires since the expiration of a temporary truce the two sides
signed in March 1988. The truce was to lay the groundwork for a
permanent peace but talks collapsed last September.
   In February, five Central American presidents agreed to come up
with a plan by mid-May to disband the Contras. Nicaragua, in turn,
agreed to elections in February and to take other steps toward
democratic reforms.
   The message broadcast by Radio Liberacion quoted Bermudez as
saying: ``The weapons of the freedom fighters constitute the only
guarantee that the Nicaraguan people have to pressure the
Sandinistas into fulfilling their promise of introducing democracy
to Nicaragua.
   ``For that reason, our troops will remain intact and alert, but
will not participate in actions of destruction or attacks against
Sandinista military positions.
   ``We reaffirm our desire to achieve democracy and freedom for
our country through peaceful means, but we reaffirm also our
decision to achieve these desires through weapons if the peaceful
means fail.''
   Bermudez reportedly left for Miami on Friday.
   The rebel source also said Juan Ramon Vivas Romero, known as
Commander Quiche, had temporarily stepped down as head of the
Contras' chiefs of staff because of pain from an old combat wound.
The source said Israel Galeano, known as Commander Franklin,
replaced Vivas Romero.
   Fighting in the 7-year-old war has diminished to sporadic
skirmishes since U.S. military aid to the Contras ended in February
1988.
   It is estimated that about 11,000 rebels and members of their
families are living in camps in Honduras near the Nicaraguan border.
   The rebel source said Bermudez told the Contras about a
bipartisan agreement between Congress and the Bush administration
to provide about $45 million in non-military aid to the rebels
through February 1990.

   Socialist Mayor Bernard Sanders stepped
down Monday after running Vermont's largest city for eight years,
and was succeeded by a political ally who shares his philosophy if
not his label.
   At an evening ceremony at City Hall, Sanders relinquished his
office to Peter Clavelle, the former city director of community and
economic development who was the candidate of Sanders' Progressive
Coalition.
   Clavelle, 39, won the office last month, defeating the
Democratic candidate by a margin of 11 percent.
   In his inaugural remarks, Clavelle called for ``radical changes
... in the relationship between state and local government.''
Burlington has had several tussles with the state Legislature over
home-rule issues.
   He also promised to continue Sanders' Progressive platform,
saying it has made the city an example. ``Yes, a small state and a
small city can make a difference ... and give hope and aspiration
to the whole country,'' Clavelle said.
   A change in style is expected to be felt almost immediately.
Clavelle, who does not label himself a socialist, favors a more
pragmatic approach than the confrontational Sanders.
   Clavelle developed a good rapport with business while serving as
Sanders' development director. Those who worked with him said he
was often the person who built and maintained working coalitions
with business while Sanders gave business-bashing speeches.
   For his part, Clavelle says he and Sanders are different people,
but share the same philosophy.
   ``I'm no Bernie Sanders,'' Clavelle said. ``Our backgrounds are
different, our styles are different, but our political visions are
the same.''
   Sanders, who decided to step down to teach and write, said
Clavelle's election shows the progressive movement in Burlington
``was and is much more than a one-man band.''

   A single-engine plane crashed on the
eastern edge of the capital Monday, killing all three people on
board and injuring three on the ground, aviation officials said.
   Among those killed was the pilot, retired Gen. Luis Federico
Fuentes Corado, 53, who was assistant defense minister in the
mid-1970s.
   It was not clear why the plane crashed. It headed back to Aurora
International Airport about 15 minutes after taking off for Puerto
Barrios, on the Caribbean coast, but crashed into a house under
construction, said Julio Cesar Motta, assistant civil aviation
director.
   Also killed were a photographer and an engineer. They planned to
take aerial photographs of ranches near Puerto Barrios, 185 miles
northeast of Guatemala City, according to the owner of an aerial
photography company that chartered the plane.
   The three injured were construction workers at the house.
   After serving as defense minister, Fuentes Corado was ambassador
to El Salvador and was director of the National Reconstruction
Committee under military governments in the early 1980s.

<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Strategic Air Command ordered the
nation's B-1B bomber fleet back into the air, nearly a week after a
mechanical glitch was discovered in one plane, an Air Force
spokesman said.
   All 97 planes were returned to active status in an order
received by B-1B bases Sunday evening, said Lt. Col. Paul Muehring,
chief of public affairs for McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita,
where 16 of the bombers are based.
   The order by Gen. John Chain Jr., SAC commander-in-chief, was
based on inspections that began shortly after the planes were
grounded last Tuesday.
   A Strategic Air Command spokesman, Capt. Harry Edwards of Offutt
Air Force Base, Neb., said two planes passed inspection and flew
from McConnell Air Force Base Monday. But although some of the
B-1Bs were again operating, the order was not a blanket approval
for the entire B-1B fleet to return immediately to the air, he said.
   ``Each aircraft will be returned to flying status upon
completion of the inspection and correction of any deficiencies,''
Edwards said. ``We do have some flying.''
   The grounding was a result of a problem discovered last Monday
during a pre-flight check of a B-1B at Dyess Air Force Base in
Texas. It was the third time the multimillion-dollar planes have
been grounded in the past 18 months.
   The B-1B's wings, which can move from a forward position to a
swept-back position, did not appear to be working in
synchronization with each other. A mechanic disconnected a switch
to investigate the problem, but that disabled the mechanism that
prevented the wing from going past the forward limit.
   One wing moved a few inches too far forward and punctured a fuel
tank, Muehring said.
   After the problem developed, 25 B-1Bs were spot-checked at six
bases, including two of McConnell's planes. No problems were
discovered, Muehring said.
   A second order was issued later in the week to check all 97
planes in the fleet, Muehring said, and inspections continued
through the weekend.

<TEXT>
   Police on Monday called the slaying of an anti-drug
crusader a contract hit, and said they are seeking three men who
allegedly ordered the killing last month.
   Two men were arrested Sunday on first-degree murder charges for
the shooting death of Lee Arthur Lawrence, the owner of a small
grocery store who was unflagging in his efforts to rid his
neighborhood of drugs.
   Lawrence, 51, was killed in a fusillade of up to 30 bullets
March 20 outside his store in Perrine, an impoverished community
about 10 miles south of Miami.
   The two men arrested Sunday were identified as Ronnie Johnson
and Rodney Newsome, both 21. In addition to the murder charges,
they face attempted murder counts for wounding two men who were in
Lawrence's grocery store during the shooting.
   Fred Taylor, head of the Metro-Dade police force, said the
amount of money and the motives for the crime could not be revealed
immediately.
   ``I'm afraid that some of the speculation will continue in the
case until we know why and who and where the death was ordered
from,'' he said. ``We feel we have those who did the shooting in
this case.''
   Information helping to break the case was phoned to a police tip
line, he said.
   In addition to Lawrence's death, Johnson was charged with the
mid-March killing of a reputed drug dealer in Perrine, and the
attempted murder of a Perrine man on March 5, police spokeswoman
Myriam Royle said.
   Also on Monday, the county began tearing down crack houses only
a few blocks from the site where Lawrence was killed.
   ``The neighbors are very happy that we're taking these houses
down because of the activities that go on at night,'' said Dade
County Commissioner Larry Hawkins. ``They feel unsafe.''
   The parking lot next to Lawrence's store was the scene of
frequent drug transactions and the market was the target of a
failed fire-bombing attempt in 1987. A week before the shooting,
Lawrence reported the latest in a series of death threats that
began in late 1986.
   More than 800 mourners, including President Bush's son Jeb,
attended Lawrence's funeral. President and Mrs. Bush sent
condolences to his family.

   President Bush, opening a week of intensive
talks on the Middle East, met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
on Monday and said ``a new atmosphere'' must be created between
Israel and Arab nations as the first step toward peace.
   After more than an hour of discussion, Bush urged an end to
Israel's occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza, endorsed the
``achievement of Palestinian political rights'' and said a
``properly structured'' international peace conference could play a
useful role.
   The tone of Bush's remarks suggested the United States may
attempt to exert pressure for compromise on Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, who arrives in the United States on Wednesday and
confers with Bush on Thursday.
   Shamir's government has opposed any settlement based on trading
land for peace, and has been deeply skeptical about any
international conference.
   Mubarak, standing alongside Bush at a departure ceremony in the
Rose Garden, said, ``We found ourselves in agreement on most issues
at stake.''
   In Nicosia, Cyprus, PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's chief adviser
welcomed Bush's call for a Middle East peace conference and
Israel's withdrawal from its occupied territories as an ``important
and serious development.''
   Bassam Abu Sharif told The Associated Press the Palestine
Liberation Organization feels ``this will give a real push for
peace efforts in the Middle East.''
   But in Jerusalem, Shamir indicated that during his U.S. visit he
will state his opposition to Bush's call for an end to Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and his endorsement of
an international peace conference.
   ``My position on all these issues is known. I'll have something
to discuss with the leaders of the United States,'' Shamir said as
he left for the United States. ``We shall insist that negotiations
be held within a reasonable framework, and be conducted directly
and without preconditions.''
   Bush did not specify whether his administration was demanding
total Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and the Gaza, seized in
the 1967 Middle East war.
   Nor did he define what he meant by a ``properly structured''
international conference, although a senior U.S. officials said
Bush emphasized ``the key factor of direct negotiations in any
peace process.''
   U.S. policy on the occupied territories has been to urge Israel
to trade land for peace while leaving open the possibility of
Israel retaining some of the land for security reasons.
   In his talks with Bush, Mubarak rejected Shamir's suggestion for
elections among Palestinians to find leaders who would negotiate
their future with Israel, according to a senior U.S. official.
Mubarak said elections under Israeli supervision were unacceptable
to the Palestinians, the official added.
   Rather than let the idea drop, Bush asked Mubarak if other forms
of supervision would be acceptable, the official said, refusing to
discuss the matter further or to be identified.
   In a warm gesture of friendship after the formal talks at the
White House, Bush took Mubarak to Baltimore for the opening day of
the baseball season and a game between the Orioles and the Boston
Red Sox. Bush left his guest briefly to throw out the first ball.
   Mubarak also will be the president's guest at a White House
dinner on Tuesday night.
   The 15-month Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza and
Israel's tough tactics in dealing with it have created pressure on
the search for a peace settlement.
   ``We share a sense of urgency to move toward a comprehensive
settlement through direct negotiations,'' Bush said.
   ``A new atmosphere must be created where Israelis and Arabs feel
each other's willingness to compromise so that both sides can
win,'' Bush said.
   ``Violence can give way to dialogue once both sides understand
that the dialogue will offer political gain,'' he said. ``Egypt and
the United States share the goals of security for Israel, the end
of the occupation and achievement of Palestinian political rights.''
   Endorsing one of Mubarak's principal proposals, Bush said that a
``properly structure international conference could play a useful
role at an appropriate time.''
   Mubarak wants a peace conference to be convened by the end of
this year or the beginning of 1990, the official said. The U.S.
position, according to the senior U.S. official, is that ``there's
a lot of ground that has to be covered before there could be a
possible useful role for an international conference.''
   Mubarak said he and Bush shared the belief that any peace
settlement ``should be a comprehensive one that addresses all
aspects of the dispute, particularly the Palestinian problem.
   ``That settlement should be achieved through direct negotiations
between Israel and all Arab parties within the framework of the
international peace conference,'' the Egyptian president said.
   Mubarak said that U.S. talks with the Palestine Liberation
Organization represent one of the ``breakthroughs'' in the Middle
East. Moreover, he said, the PLO ``has accepted unequivocally the
requirements for peace.
   ``An Arab consensus has emerged in favor of preace and
reconciliation ... (and) a majority of of the Israeli people is
shaping up in support of peace.''
   Mubarak said, ``In short, the situation is right for an active
effort more than ever before.'' He said the United States ``remains
highly qualified to play a pivotal role during the months ahead.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle hosted a reception for Mubarak at his
residence on Massachusetts Avenue. The Egyptian President, in a
brief speech, said peace would come easily to the Middle East once
negotiations began. He invited Quayle to visit the country.
   Later, American businessmen gave a dinner for Mubarak. The
Egyptian leader said he was not asking the Bush administration to
put pressure on Israel. ``Exerting pressure won't solve anything,''
Mubarak said.
   He called the Mideast peace conference he has been promoting a
``psychological umbrella'' that would not interfere with direct
negotiations between Israel and the Arabs.

   Three civilian service secretaries have been
selected by the Bush administration to be in charge of the Army,
Navy and Air Force, the Washington Post reported.
   The newspaper said Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard L.
Armitage will run the Army, Undersecretary H. Lawreance Garrett III
takes over the Navy and Donald B. Rice of the Rand Corp. will head
the Air Force, according to unnamed defense officials.
   The three are versed in the issues facing the services they are
slated to run and have a low-key style that would not overshadow
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, the paper said in its Tuesdy
editions.
   The primary responsibility of civilian service secretaries is to
see that the policies formulated by the civilian defense secretary
are implemented by the generals and admirals.
   Armitage, 43, had been slated to leave the Pentagon for an
executive position at the State Department, the Post said, but
Cheney and others prevailed on him to stay with a promise of a
higher position than his present one as assistant secretary of
defense for international security affairs. Since 1983, he has
played a major role in policymaking in the Persian Gulf and in the
ouster of Philippine leader Ferdinand Marcos.
   Garrett, 49, a former Navy officer, was an associate counsel to
former President Ronald Reagan from 1983 to 1986, moved to the
Pentagon as general counsel and has been Navy undersecretary since
1987, a job in which he found himself at odds with the Pentagon's
inspector general over his management of shipbuilding, the Post
said.
   Rice, 49, is an engineer and economist who has been a cost
analyst at the Pentagon and White House Office of Management and
Budget. Since 1972, he has been chief executive at the Rand Corp.,
a think tank.

<HEAD>NATO Faces Manpower Problem Because of Declining Birth Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT J. WIELAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CASTEAU, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization
is facing a manpower shortage because of falling birth rates in its
16 member nations.
   One remedy, officials here at NATO headquarters say, is the
talks with the Soviet-led East bloc in Vienna, Austria, which could
bring an accord on reducing troops and conventional arms in Europe.
   The U.S. Institute for Defense Analysis has forecast that by the
year 2000, NATO nations will see an average 12.4 percent drop in
draft-age males while there will be a 15.2 percent increase among
the seven Warsaw Pact nations.
   One reason is what the West Germans call the ``pillenknick''
(pill dip), a falling birth rate due to greater use of the birth
control pill in recent decades.
   According to statistics supplied by the Supreme Headquarters
Allied Powers, Europe, the problem is most acute in West Germany,
whose supply of draft-age males will decline 45 percent from 1985
to 2000.
   In that same period, the statistics indicated, the Netherlands
will see a drop in males in the 18-to-24 age group of 30 percent,
followed by Belgium, 27 percent; Britain and Luxembourg, 25 percent
each; Italy, 23 percent; Denmark, 17 percent; France, 13 percent,
and Portugal, 9 percent.
   Greece's supply of draftable males will remain even over the
next decade. Only Turkey expects an increase.
   The U.S. armed forces also face a declining manpower base.
   In 1979, 2.2 million Americans were old enough to sign up for
military service. This fell to 1.9 million last year and will dip
to 1.6 million by 1992.
   To maintain adequate defenses, NATO is considering improving the
combat role of reserve forces, possibly by amending the way they
are deployed in times of crisis.
   ``The need to tap this potential has taken on a new urgency,''
said Gen. John Akehurst, the deputy supreme allied commander in
Europe.
   In wartime, under present plans NATO forces would include 5
million people, half of them reserves or volunteer citizen-soldiers
whose key wartime task would be to provide logistical support for
combat troops.
   The United States has begun strengthening its military reserves.
Since 1980, their numbers have increased from 1.4 million to 1.7
million.
   West Germany also has begun doubling the number of reservists
for military excercises, but with mixed results: in 1985, a third
of its reservists never showed up for their service.
   Reservists do not enjoy equal prestige in all allied nations,
and there are a variety of rules regarding their function.
   ``The education and training periods are different, the time a
country is really going to use its reservists, i.e. keep them
trained and keep them on the list for active duty, is different,''
one NATO official said.
   ``As a result, there is a large pool of reserves ... not trained
to the extent required.''
   The increased use of reserves would offset the effect of falling
birth rates, but the ``graying'' of NATO populations also will
reduce the ranks of reserves.
   This is already evident in West Germany, which has 1.6 million
reservists but will have only 1 million by the mid-1990s.
   Finding enough manpower poses special problems for the volunteer
armed forces of Britain, the United States and Canada, which
compete with private industry for a shrinking pool of personnel.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's aging Communist leadership is under
increasing pressure as disappointment grows over its refusal to
follow Mikhail S. Gorbachev's lead on economic and political
reforms.
   The Soviet president has gained popularity in East Germany,
particularly among young people, who often are seen wearing ``I
like Gorbi'' buttons.
   Interviews and conversations across East Germany during a recent
two-week period indicate that resentment is mounting and that even
Communist Party officials have grown impatient and disillusioned
with the government's rejection of Gorbachev-style reforms.
   ``The senile old men are doing everything they can to stop the
flood of new ideas from Moscow,'' said a 22-year-old student at
East Berlin's Humboldt University.
   The East German leader, Erich Honecker, is 76 years old and his
Politburo deputies also are in their 70s.
   Many East Germans also are becoming increasingly frustrated with
the government's continued hardline approach toward dissent, the
gap between the economic successes reported in the state-run media
and the realities of the marketplace, and severe restrictions on
travel to the West.
   On the Berlin-Leipzig Express one recent day, East German
passengers turned away from the window as the train passed the
barbed wire, gun towers and steel barriers at the Berlin Wall.
   ``It is simply not possible emotionally to confront this
division and isolation all the time,'' said a 35-year-old man.
   ``You try not to think about it because it is an obscene symbol
of your own powerlessness. But you never really succeed. It's
always there in your mind even when you don't see it.''
   According to West German government statistics (none are made
available in East Germany), at least 750,000 people have applied to
leave East Germany. In a rare public demonstration, more than 600
people protested recently in Leipzig over the government's refusal
to grant them exit visas.
   Exit visas are especially difficult for highly trained East
Germans, such as doctors, engineers and scientists.
   ``I speak two foreign languages and it looks like I'll never get
out of the country to use them,'' said a 27-year-old East Berlin
engineering student.
   ``We don't all want to leave. If they would let me travel I'd
come back. This is my home.''
   The government has made clear it has no intention of taking the
Berlin Wall down, contending it protects East Germany from
``plunderers'' and those aiming to disrupt ``stability and peace in
Europe.''
   ``This is ridiculous, cynical cant,'' said another East Berlin
student. ``Anyone with eyes can see that the binoculars and rifles
are pointed East.''
   The government also has banned several Soviet publications and
films because of the growing public popularity of Gorbachev's
reforms.
   Lutheran Church bulletins advocating a dialogue with the
government over reforms have been censored and security authorities
have cracked down on human rights groups.
   While the party's leaders continue to insist that such reforms
are unnecessary, many lower-level party members, intellectuals and
workers insist that Gorbachev's experiments should be tested.
   Gorbachev's policies, which are known as glasnost and
perestroika and call for openness and some decentralization in
political and economic life, have been hailed by dissidents as the
first good thing to come from the Soviet Union in decades.
   ``For many (in the party leadership) the changes are coming too
fast,'' said a party official in East Berlin, speaking only on
condition of anonymity.
   ``But many in the party ranks believe these ideas would prove
useful.''
   Government intransigence appears to be having an effect on party
membership.
   Neues Deutschland, the Communist Party's newspaper, reported in
January that more than 3,000 people had left or had been expelled
from the party in East Berlin over the past year.
   Stefan Heym, one of East Germany's best-known authors, said
Gorbachev's changes in th Soviet Union appear to have caused a rift
in the party's upper echelons.
   ``There seem to be differing views about what should be done,''
he said.
   However, one of the party's chief ideologues, Otto Reinhold,
made it clear in a recent article in the state-run media that East
Germany has no plans to follow the Soviet Union and other Warsaw
Pact allies with reforms any time soon.
   ``There are those who believe that we have to change the way the
economy is led, to expand the market and to create competition,''
Reinhold said.
   ``We on the other hand, believe the best way is to build step by
step on a system that has proven successful for us.''
   East Germany has one of the most prosperous economies in the
Warsaw Pact and its citizens enjoy among the highest standards of
living in the region. But the economy is slowing down, and East
Germans complain of shortages.
   ``There's a terrific new gas oven in my kitchen but no valve to
connect it to the gas lines,'' said a middle-aged man from Dresden.
``I've been looking for this valve for four months.''
   Owners of some of the private business establishments permitted
say strict government regulations continue to hamper enterprises
that can produce many goods and services that East German consumers
want and are ready to pay more for.
   At a popular private nightspot in Leipzig, the restaurant's
operator scanned the crowded tables and the line of people outside
waiting to get in.
   ``We are in a daily battle with the authorities just to keep
going,'' he said. ``The system is designed to make it as difficult
as possible to prosper.''

<HEAD>East Germans Still Attempt to Scale Berlin Wall</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-East German-Discontent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 5,000 East Germans have made it safely
over the Berlin Wall since it went up in 1961 and 30,058 others
have fled into West Germany at other border areas, according to the
August 13 group in West Berlin.
   But 189 people are known to have died while attempting to flee,
said Horst Schumm, deputy director of the group, which monitors
human rights in East Germany.
   The lastest fatality at the Berlin Wall was a 22-year-old man
who was shot and killed by border guards Feb. 6 as he tried make it
over the top with a ladder.
   Another East Berlin man was killed recently when he fell to his
death from the platform of his homemade hot air balloon. On March
10, East German border troops wounded one of three men during an
escape attempt.
   ``The economic and political situation in East Germany has
deteriorated considerably and many people have no hope that things
will change or get better,'' Schumm said. ``People are becoming
more desperate.''
   East German leader Erich Honecker, who supervised construction
of the Berlin Wall after it was ordered built by Communist Party
chief Walter Ulbricht in August 1961, said this past January that
the wall ``will still be standing in 50 years and even in 100 years
if the reasons (for its existence) are not set aside.''

<HEAD>Quayle Jokes by Dan Quayle</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Live, from Washington, it's a new crop of Dan
Quayle jokes, as told by Vice President Dan Quayle.
   He poses no retaliatory threat to the TV comics who have made
him the butt of their humor, but Quayle is polishing his style as a
black and white-tie humorist.
   ``Mr. President,'' he said to George Bush and 629 other people
at a formal dinner Saturday night, ``you've been so supportive of
me.
   ``The other day he called me into the Oval Office and said ... I
want to do something that will show the nation what faith I have in
you, in your maturity and your sense of responsibility.
   ``Would you like a puppy?''
   The Quayle performances at the dinner of the Gridiron Club and
earlier at the Radio and Television Correspondents Association's
dinner are in keeping with the springtime rites of Washington,
which include a round of formal dinners featuring the leaders of
government needling journalists and themselves.
   Self-effacing humor is deemed best, and the higher the rank, the
bigger the laughs. Curiously, that is doubly so if the official
involved has been facing the kind of sharp, sometimes personal
criticism that has been Quayle's lot ever since he was nominated.
   Quayle made his debut as a humorist at the 45th Radio and
Television Correspondents dinner a couple of weeks ago. Reviews
varied. He was panned in the Post.
   But his delivery is improving. As for the material, that's a
judgment that can only be made by the listener-viewer-reader.
   He opened that night by remarking on the cocktails and the wine
at every table, saying he realized ``most of you do not want to be
secretary of defense,'' the job John G. Tower was denied largely
because of reports of excessive drinking.
   That drew more groans than laughs, although variations on the
gag had been making the rounds since Tower's rejection by the
Senate. ``It gets better,'' Quayle told his tough crowd.
   Quayle said some people expected that as vice president he'd
behave like Spiro T. Agnew, public enemy of the news media during
the Nixon administration until he resigned rather than face
prosecution on bribery charges. So, he joked, he'd sought Agnew's
advice on press relations. ``This time around, tell them `No More
Mr. Nice Guy,''' he said Agnew counseled.
   Gridiron dinners have been the setting for the repair of some
political reputations and the denting of others. Nancy Reagan sang
``Second Hand Clothes'' early in the Reagan administration and
deflected criticism of her costly, borrowed gowns and White House
china.
   In keeping with the ritual, Quayle turned his best lines on
himself. He said Bush had offered him a new title to describe his
duties: ``funeral czar.''
   ``I think the president truly appreciates my insights,'' he
said. ``Just the other day he was telling the Cabinet `If there's
one thing I won't tolerate, it's yes men.'
   `` `Isn't that right, Dan?' ''
   Quayle looked down the head table at Secretary of State James A.
Baker III. ``I owe him so much,'' he said. ``During the campaign he
took me under his wing.
   ``And kept me there.''
   He said Baker advised him on the way to handle the questions
about his experience in the vice presidential campaign debate.
``Wait for a strategic moment, then compare yourself to John
Kennedy.
   ``Thanks, Jimmy.''
   Quayle said complaints about youth and inexperience didn't
really bother him during the campaign. ``What really burned me up
were all the stories about my so-called handlers. I finally got so
mad I went right to the top. I said `Marilyn, you've got to do
something about this.' ''
   Marilyn, of course, is Mrs. Quayle. Some of the vice president's
critics say she's the brains of the family.
   ``I'll never forget that magic moment we met,'' Quayle said.
``You remember, dear. When you caught me peeking over your shoulder
during the bar exam.''
   Trying to outdo the hostile humor may seem a strange way to
counter it. But it's worked before. Still, there's a lot of mileage
left in Quayle jokes. At the Gridiron dinner, Ronald H. Brown, the
Democratic chairman, reminded everyone that Washington now has an
11 p.m. curfew for juveniles who do not have essential employment.
He turned to Quayle.
   ``You've only got about an hour and a half, Mr. Vice President.''

   Today is Tuesday, April 11, the 101st day of 1989. There are 264
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   Three hundred years ago, on April 11, 1689, William III and Mary
II were crowned as joint sovereigns in Britain, two months after
their reign had begun as part of the ``Glorious Revolution'' that
deposed James II.
   On this date:
   In 1814, Napoleon Bonaparte abdicated as emperor of France and
was banished to the island of Elba.
   In 1898, President William McKinley asked Congress for a
declaration of war against Spain.
   In 1899, the treaty ending the Spanish-American War was declared
in effect.
   In 1921, Iowa became the first state to impose a cigarette tax.
   In 1947, Jackie Robinson made his major-league debut, playing in
an exhibition game between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York
Yankees.
   In 1951, President Harry S. Truman relieved Gen. Douglas
MacArthur of his command in the Far East.
   In 1953, Oveta Culp Hobby became the first Secretary of Health,
Education and Welfare.
   In 1970, Apollo 13 blasted off on its ill-fated mission to the
moon.
   In 1980, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued
regulations specifically prohibiting sexual harassment of workers
by supervisors.
   In 1981, President Ronald Reagan returned to the White House
from George Washington University Hospital, 12 days after he was
wounded in an assassination attempt.
   In 1986, two FBI agents were killed in a wild shootout in Miami
that also resulted in the deaths of two robbery suspects.
   In 1987, the government of South Africa outlawed any action,
word or written document that protested the practice of detention
without trials or called for the release of detainees.

<TEXT>
   You might be able to get a fairly accurate view
of what's ahead for the economy if you simply interview your
friends or neighbors at the next social event you attend.
   While it won't make you the life of the party, and conceivably
could kill it, such interviews might provide you with a fair
picture of future interest rates, jobs, inflation and even the
gross national product.
   You must accept whatever social consequences ensue, but isn't
that a fair enough price for a look into the mysterious future?
   The suggestion arises from evidence that consumers en masse are
pretty good at forecasting the economic future and even at making
the proper moves in anticipation of developments.
   Consumers are so good at this, in fact, that the Department of
Commerce recently announced the Index of Consumer Expectations
derived from studies at the University of Michigan will be included
among its leading, or advance, indicators.
   While your informal survey will be informative, it won't, of
course, carry the authoritativeness of the Michigan survey, which
is scientifically construed and professionally analyzed and has a
track record dating to 1946.
   In that time, consumer expectations have foretold by weeks and
months the movement of several significant economic measures. There
is no magic to it; perhaps instinct plays a large role, and
self-concern too.
   Consider these factors:
   1. Most consumers are not mere robots who automatically grab the
lure of advertisers. They do have minds and sometimes they use them.
   2. When it concerns their own money, most consumers have a high
sense of fiduciary responsibility.
   3. This a consumer economy. Consumers account for more getting
and spending than business or government. Taken as a whole,
consumers are a vast economic power that can dictate economic
changes when perceptions are acted out.
   Richard Curtin, director of Michigan's Survey Research Center,
states that consumer expectations change, on average, two quarters
in advance of movements in the prime interest rate, three quarters
in advance of changes in the jobless rate and one quarter in
advance of changes in the consumer price index.
   Moreover, he says, the subjective assessments of consumers in
regard to current business conditions usually are documented by the
official statistics, which aren't released until weeks and months
later.
   In the latest reading of the consumer mind, financial prospects
for the year ahead were considered quite favorably. The majority
expected good times financially in the economy as a whole.
   Unemployment was expected to remain unchanged at its very low
levels, but a record number of consumers expected interest rates to
rise. Inflation was foreseen averaging 4.8 percent, or not much
different from the existing rate.
   You may, if you choose, conduct your own test among neighbors,
friends and relatives, but a couple of caveats should be observed.
   You should be aware that the larger the group the more
representative it is likely to be. Individuals might be overly
optimistic or pessimistic; what is important is aggregate opinion
and objective analysis of the results.
   The second caveat is that should you actually attempt such a
survey at a socialt you must assume full responsibility for
the consequences.

<TEXT>
   It is easier to see the present's failure
than the past's legendary elegance in what remains of the Hotel
Bristol.
   And it is hard for people of Warsaw today to believe that the
Bristol will ever reopen, its scaffolded facade and stripped
interior having stood for so long as a nagging reminder of Poland's
dismal economic slide.
   Even now, as workers shoulder sacks of cement through its doors
and decorators slip bits of pink brocade onto blueprints, there is
rampant skepticism that the communist government can carry off its
grand plans to recapture the days when the pianist Ignacy
Paderewski commanded a block-long suite and tipsy guests tripped
carefree through the garden fountain.
   But government-backed renovators, who have been at work 18
months, say will recreate a first-class hotel on deadline, Sept.
25, 1991.
   ``It has been too long that this hotel has had its magnificence
taken away,'' said Krzysztof Wojcik, director of the Investment
Realization Board of ORBIS, the national tourism company.
   The government has allotted 18 billion zlotys ($31.5 million at
the official exchange or $6 million at the black market rate) for
the Bristol.
   Once among Europe's most elegant hotels with silver settings
that included four pieces just for eating crayfish, it was much in
decline even from its postwar incarnation with a ``people's
tavern'' when it closed for renovations in 1980.
   The martial-law crackdown on the independent Solidarity union
movement in 1981 intervened. Western loans and investments were cut
off and Poland's staggering economy had no room for the project.
   About 1.5 million zlotys have been spent so far to pare the
block-square, eight-story hotel down to brick and beam and to begin
to install new services.
   Although built at the turn of the century with all the modern
techniques and conveniences of the time, the difficulty of
``installing the technology of the 20th century into these old
walls'' also has slowed the work, said Tadeusz Jarecki, a
renovation coordinator.
   Just how sumptuous the Bristol will be depends on the special
team of designers charged with recapturing the Viennese art-nouveau
style of its first decades and how much the elements imported from
the West cost in precious hard currency.
   ``We also hope that there will be some interest shown (by
investors) on the American side,'' said director Wojcik. ``We all
know America, rich and beautiful as it is, lacks the historical
monuments we have in Europe.''
   Renovators say they plan to restore the hotel's marble stairs,
mirrors, chandeliers, furniture and even Paderewski's piano.
   Design schemes call a grand entrance with a brass crest in a
granite sidewalk. The Raspberry Room restaurant will be recreated
in pink and gilt and each floor of the 344-bed hotel will be color
coordinated down to the chambermaids' uniform.
   Now, however, there are few walls, no doors and much rubble. In
the courtyard where a glass conservatory once glittered are piles
of pipes and boards dumped unceremoniously over the years in what
one project director called ``a socialist hell.''
   Built by Paderewski's investment company, the Bristol flourished
between the two world wars, when he served briefly as premier.
   The guest register was studded with notables from the world of
diplomacy, finance, the arts and aristocracy. Hollywood's famous
couple, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, surveyed the
tree-lined boulevard from their balcony in 1926 and the renovators
hope their names and others will hang from a ``visiting card tree''
in the lobby of the new Bristol.
   The Nazi occupiers took the hotel over during World War II.
   The Bristol was one of the few buildings in the city's historic
center still standing when the Soviet Red Army entered Warsaw in
January 1945.
   On Josef V. Stalin's birthday in 1949, the ``People's Tavern''
opened at the Bristol and the Russian-Polish menu instructed
customers that ``tipping offends the dignity of the working man.''
   ORBIS took over in 1952, redecorating and modernizing. Many
dignitaries still took rooms, including Sen. John F. Kennedy, who
needed a special bed board because of back problems during his 1959
stay.
   It remained the smartest hotel in Warsaw through the 1960s. But
even the official history acknowledges that no repairs were made
after 1952 and the Bristol was being used as a dormitory for
students when it closed.
   To this day, however, the Bristol is warmly remembered by many
Poles as a bright spot in an often-bleak postwar period. They
recall animated debates around the cafe's tables as students from
nearby Warsaw University and festive evenings out at the Column
Room restaurant.
   ``As with everyone living in Warsaw, I have personal memories,''
said Wojcik. ``My sister was working in this hotel for 25 years
until it was closed. That is why I have a deep personal and
professional conviction to have this hotel restored.''
   And so Warsaw is waiting.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's another question of whether the feds should
tell the states what to do and, if so, who should foot the bill?
This time the debate is about the quality of day care for children,
and when kids are involved emotions run high. More than two dozen
child care bills are now before Congress while President Bush has
some ideas of his own.

   A baby sitter recently saved the lives of
eight young children by tossing them from the window of her burning
apartment to the arms of rescuers three stories below.
   There was heroism in the tale, but it also raised some questions.
   Should one person have been looking after eight children ranging
in age from 5 months to 3 years? Were the children getting the
individual attention considered vital to healthy child development?
Even more basic, was the situation safe? And who's to blame for day
care that is abusive, hazardous, emotionally damaging or
intellectually barren?
   Day care for children traditionally has been regulated by the
individual states. Now Congress is debating whether to enact
minimum federal standards and force states to toe the line.
   No fewer than two dozen child care bills are pending on Capitol
Hill, with advocates of federal regulation insisting that some
states simply are not doing a proper job.
   The controversy over federal encroachment on the turf of the
states was a major factor holding up child care legislation last
year and the fireworks promise to be equally as lively this year.
   Are states doing the job?
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, who is leading a National Governors
Association push for federal incentives instead of requirements,
says, ``The record reflects a significant effort in most states to
improve child care standards.''
   But officials of the Children's Defense Fund maintain there are
wide discrepancies in the standards from state to state. In some
states, for example, a single adult cannot care for more than three
infants. But in Idaho, a new mandatory licensing system
theoretically permits one person to care for 12 infants.
   ``The states that are generally moving forward are the ones that
weren't in such bad shape to begin with,'' says Helen Blank, day
care director for the CDF. ``But we still have a situation where in
many states licensing standards don't give children the protection
they need to grow up safe _ much less give them a good
developmental experience.
   ``The bottom line is that a few states have gone backwards. In
some states, what they call progress makes you a little
uncomfortable.''
   Meanwhile, President Bush is pushing for a tax break for
low-income families with young children, on the premise that it
gives parents a choice. One parent can decide to stay home or the
family can use the money for the child care of their choice.
   Bush's plan presumes that parents don't want or need federal
intrusion in the day care field. Any federal requirements would
decrease the supply of care and infringe on parental choice,
backers of the plan contend.
   But some parents have told Congress they always assumed the
government regulated child care until tragedy struck their family.
And experts contend that most parents aren't qualified to judge day
care _ and why should they have to?
   ``We don't ask restaurant patrons to inspect the kitchen for
violations,'' says Dr. Sue Aronson, a child care consultant who
teaches pediatrics at Hahneman University in Philadelphia.
   There is little disagreement among experts over ideal day care
conditions for children. Some are physical, such as requiring
staffers to frequently wash their hands to prevent the spread of
infectious disease, providing immunizations, fire extinguishers and
enough adults on hand to get infants and young toddlers to safety
in an emergency.
   Then there is quality _ ``warm, positive, individual, one-to-one
interactions between adults and children,'' as described by Dr. Sue
Bredekamp, director of professional development at the National
Association for the Education of Young Children.
   Such interactions have a long-term effect on language,
self-esteem, social development and intellectual competence, she
says. Her group has identified three factors that most influence
the quality of day care interactions: group size, the
staff-to-child ratio, and staff training.
   Bredekamp says proper training might have averted the recent
death of a 9-month-old infant whose nanny banged her head against
the wall because she would not stop crying. ``We must face the very
real possibility that the nanny did not know any better,'' she says.
   Training not only can prevent child abuse but also enables
care-givers to help children grow and learn, she says. ``Our goal
is not that children just survive child care. We want and need for
them to thrive in child care.''
   To that end, she says, 20 preschoolers and two adults is far
superior to 40 kids and four adults in terms of noise level,
psychological space and opportunities for individual interactions
with adults and other children. And, she says, one adult for every
three or four infants is critical if babies are to be adequately
held, rocked, comforted and protected from physical harm.
   Even states with relatively stringent regulations often fall
short of standards recommended by professionals.
   Only 15 states meet NAEYC guidelines for infant ratios and group
size. Only five meet the guidelines for toddlers and 10 for
preschoolers. Nearly half don't require any training or experience
of day care teachers.
   On the health and safety front, about half the states don't have
specific day care center hand-washing requirements, according to a
forthcoming study by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the
American Public Health Association.
   The federally funded study, meant to be a comparative report
card for states, also has found that only 6 percent require that
center children be immunized for meningitis. And only 18 percent
require energy absorbing surfaces below climbing equipment,
although one-half to two-thirds of all injuries occur on
playgrounds.

   Many state legislatures have agreed to some minimum standards,
but have balked at more stringent regulations urged by some
agencies.
   In Idaho, for example, the state has just instituted a mandatory
licensing system _ its first. But while the new law requires fire
and health inspections and criminal history checks, it doesn't
require any education or training of staff members. The staff-child
ratio is 1 to 12, regardless of the ages of the children. Staffers
watching no more than six kids are not regulated at all.
   ``The law is less strict than our regulations were under the
previous law,'' says Perry Ackerman, child care licensing
coordinator for the state. ``But that was voluntary. There wasn't
any penalty for being unlicensed.''
   Is that progress?
   ``We lost a lot in the area of quality,'' Perry replies. ``But
we got a mandatory law after eight or nine attempts. I guess it's
progress.''
   In Texas, regulations for the state's 14,000-plus family day
care homes are about to be revised. Under the current system, the
only qualification for care-givers is that they be 18 years old.
And they can watch up to 12 children, depending on their ages. One
mix allows one adult to care for four infants and two toddlers.
Another permits six young children and six school-age siblings.
   While Texas requires centers to be licensed, its much weaker
registration system for day care homes was highlighted by toddler
Jessica McClure's well-publicized tumble into an abandoned well
shaft. With six children in her care, the baby sitter thought she
didn't need to register with the state. She was wrong.
   But even if she had registered, the state would have done no
more than run checks for a criminal record or reports of child
abuse. No one would have visited the house and discovered the well
shaft in the yard.
   ``It's providing a false sense of security to parents,'' says
Cris Ros-Dukler, the state's assistant commissioner for licensing.
   Ros-Dukler says she has unsuccessfully sought money to put teeth
in the registration process. An attempt two years ago to limit
family day care homes to six children ``got nowhere,'' she says.
Hopes for change at this point turn on raising the minimum
care-giver age to 21 and requiring training both before and after
becoming a provider.
   At the other end of the spectrum, Delaware upgraded family day
care in 1985 and just completed an overhaul of center regulations.
The ratio now is one staffer to four infants. Health and safety
requirements are much more stringent. Care-givers now must
participate in 15 hours of training a year and expose children to a
range of daily activities appropriate to their age.
   What does Delaware have that Texas doesn't?
   ``You really have to determine what is the community standard
that is going to be acceptable,'' says Pauline Koch, Delaware's
director of licensing services.
   Gwen Morgan, a professor at Wheelock College in Boston and
author of the ``The National State of Child Care Regulation,''
doesn't agree that federal standards are the answer.
   ``I'm amenable to one federal standard: infant care,'' she says.
``I'm convinced that a one to seven infant ratio can have extremely
harmful effects.''
   The dangers, she says, include borderline retardation from lack
of stimulation; increased spread of infectious disease, and the
sheer physical impossibility of exiting a building quickly with
seven infants.
   The federal government should otherwise stay out of the mandate
business unless they are willing to fork over $20 billion to $30
billion to help parents and states pay for the upgraded care,
Morgan says.
   The nation's governors agree. They are proposing the development
of national model standards on everything from nutrition and safety
to staff size, training and parental involvement, and seeking
federal financial incentives for states to upgrade their systems.
   ``If the states have incentive grants and after a few years you
can show me people still doing things that are certifiably bad for
kids, then I personally will be glad to take another look at this
federal standards issue,'' Clinton says.
   Model standards have failed to influence states in the past, and
hard-liners hold little hope of progress _ even with a federal
carrot. ``In some states there is such strong opposition to making
improvements that money incentives will not work,'' says Blank, the
Children's Defense Fund day care director.
   Blank and her allies note that the states must meet a variety of
conditions to get federal money for Head Start, school lunches,
nursing homes, highways and anti-pollution projects. So why not day
care?
   ``Taxpayers do not want their tax dollars used to place babies
and children in dangerous situations,'' says Joyce Strom, deputy
director of the Child Welfare League of America.
   But Clinton says mandatory child care standards would be like
mandatory elementary school standards. ``We have smaller class
requirements now in Arkansas,'' he says. ``It's very expensive,
it's very controversial and it's very good for at-risk kids. I'm
glad we did it, but I wouldn't recommend it as a national
standard.''
   The debate at the Clinton household, half a continent away from
the talk on Capitol Hill, has a familiar ring. For while Clinton
has been designated lead governor in the NGA bid to discourage
mandated national standards, his wife Hillary is chairman of the
Children's Defense Fund _ the fiercest standards champion of all.
   ``If it was just the two of us, I think we could work it out,''
Clinton said with a laugh. ``But it's not.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) _ There are more than two dozen child care bills
pending in Congress, according to the clerk of the House. The major
bills include:
   _Act for Better Child Care Services, sponsored by Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn., and Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, in the Senate, and Dale
Kildee, D-Mich., in the House. The bill authorizes $2.5 billion, 70
percent of it for direct assistance to low-income families. The
rest would be to improve child care quality, expand the supply and
underwrite a liability risk fund. Care-givers receiving federal
funds would have to comply with minimum health and safety standards
no later than about five years after enactment.
   _Working Family Child Care Assistance Act, the so-called Bush
plan, introduced by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan. The
bill would provide a tax credit of up to $1,000 a year for each
child under age 4 in low-income working families. Some 2.5 million
families making $8,000 to $13,000 a year would benefit in 1990, the
first year of the tax break. The administration said it does not
know how much the program would cost in lost tax revenues.
   _Child Development and Education Act, sponsored by Rep. Augustus
Hawkins, D-Calif. The bill authorizes $2.5 billion to be split
three ways: one-third to expand Head Start for 3- and 4-year-olds;
one-third for school-based programs for children age 5 and older,
and one-third for infant-toddler programs. The third section is
essentially the ABC bill noted above, but sharply focused on
children under age 3.
   _Expanded Child Care Opportunities Act, sponsored by Sens. Bob
Packwood, R-Ore., and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. The bill
increases the child care tax credit to families with incomes under
$25,000; makes the credit fully refundable to benefit lower income
families who pay little or no income tax; and adds $400 million to
the Social Services Block Grant (Title XX) for the purpose of
improving child care services.
   _Child Care Standards Improvement Act, sponsored by Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., would authorize payments to states to help them
improve child care standards.

   WASHINGTON (AP) _ What should a parent keep in mind when looking
for child care? Here are suggestions from the National Association
for the Education of Young Children and Kinder-Care Learning
Centers, Inc.
   1. Who will care for your child? Have the adults had any
training or coursework in child development? Do they enjoy and
understand how young children learn and grow? Do they appear warm
and enthusiastic?
   2. Are there enough adults to work with a group and care for the
individual needs of children? NAEYC recommends infant groups of no
more than eight with at least two adults; toddlers in groups of no
more than 16 with at least two adults; and preschoolers in groups
of no more than 20 with at least two adults.
   3. What program activities and equipment are offered? Is there a
balance between indoor and outdoor play? Are self-help skills
encouraged? Are there toys, books and other materials appropriate
to your child's age?
   4. Are parents encouraged to visit at any time? Are they welcome
to discuss policies and make suggestions?
   5. Are good health practices followed, including frequent
hand-washing? Are meals and snacks nutritious? Are surfaces,
equipment and toys cleaned daily? Are medical records and emergency
information kept on hand for each child and staff member?
   6. Is the facility safe? Does it have a smoke alarm? Are toxic
materials stored in locked cabinets?
   7. Is the center or home licensed? Licensing and registration
requirements vary from state to state, with standards much stiffer
in some places than others. So check with your state licensing
agency to find out whether licenses are required in your area, and,
if so, what standards a care-giver must meet.
   A more detailed brochure can be obtained by sending a stamped,
self-addressed envelope to the National Association for the
Education of Young Children, Box C, 1834 Connecticut Ave. NW,
Washington, D.C., 20009.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Socrates today might have his own parking space
and his name on an office door as a professional ethicist, instead
of walking barefoot in the streets of Athens to proclaim his
message of ``know thyself.'' From Wall Street to Washington,
classrooms to newsrooms, the emphasis is on ethics these days. As
one consultant put it, ``Ethics is red-hot right now.''

   A Lear jet whines into the South Bend, Ind., airport to pluck a
theologian from the Notre Dame campus for consultation with senior
management of a West Coast timber giant on environmental ethics.
   In Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a stretch limo with a bar and TV set
whisks Maryknoll priest Ed Wroblewski, who has spent much of his
life in the African mission fields, off to join corporate
executives at a weeklong seminar on values and ethics.
   As dawn breaks over Capitol Hill, more than a dozen congressmen
sit down at a prayer breakfast to meditate on government service,
which President Bush in his first week in office declared to be
``noble calling, a public trust'' and appointed an eight-member
commission to frame a new code of ethics for enlightened official
behavior.
   On the other side of the Potomac, beefy backs and burly linemen
with the Washington Redskins gather in cornerback Darrell Green's
living room to pray for fellow athletes fighting a drug habit.
   Manhattan's Trinity Church, from its vantage point at the head
of Wall Street, now runs an outreach center headed by Dr. David
Schmidt, an ethicist, to help firms like Standard Oil and Champion
International develop programs for responsible corporate behavior.
   The American Medical Association reports that 90 percent of the
country's major hospitals now have a staff ethics consultant or
regularly meeting ethics committee.
   ``Ethics is red-hot right now,'' says the Rev. James Joyce at
the Jesuit office around the corner from the New York Stock
Exchange, where at noon on Tuesdays investment bankers, market
analysts and various management types bring a brown-bag lunch to
chew over the moral implications of tender offers, forced
acquisitions, plant closings and insider trading.
   ``Ethics is certainly enjoying a huge comeback,'' says
philosopher Lisa Newton of Connecticut's Fairfield University.
   ``It's almost a fad,'' says Schmidt.
   Beginning this school year, Harvard Business School now requires
all first-year M.B.A. candidates to take a ``Decision Making and
Ethical Values'' course taught by nine senior faculty members.
Former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman John Shad gave
Harvard a $20 million endowment to teach future traders and money
managers the difference between right and wrong.
   Barry Bingham Jr., former editor and publisher of The
Courier-Journal in Louisville, Ky., has launched FineLine, a
newsletter for professionals in print and broadcast news dealing in
actual case histories of ethical problems confronting the media.
   Deni Elliott, director of Dartmouth's Institute of Ethics, has
spent months in the newsrooms of The Philadelphia Inquirer, The
Courier-Journal, WCHS-TV in Portland, Maine, and similar clients
coaching journalists on how to think morally when the ``tough
calls'' come in near deadline. Should we reveal the name of a rape
victim? Go with the gory pictures of a fatal accident on the
Interstate? Protect the source blowing the whistle on city contract
scandals?
   Lisa Newton of Fairfield University wrote the study guide for
Public Broadcasting's critically acclaimed 10-part series on Ethics
in America that featured such diverse panelists as former U.S.
Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia,
takeover specialist T. Boone Pickens, former U.N. delegate Jeane
Kirkpatrick, Gen. William Westmoreland, Surgeon General C. Everett
Koop, civil rights activist C. Vernon Mason and Katharine Graham of
The Washington Post.
   Schmidt of the Trinity Center spent several months going through
the in-house training program of a leading Wall Street investment
firm ``to be able to talk their language'' and ``serve as midwife''
at the birth of a values program.
   ``There are companies now that have positions of high corporate
responsibility staffed by theologians and philosophers,'' he says.
   Socrates today might have his own parking space and his name on
an office door as an ethicist, instead of walking barefoot in the
streets of Athens to proclaim his message of ``know thyself.''
   Like Jesuit John Langan at Georgetown's Kennedy Institute of
Ethics, he might be a values consultant to Chemical Bank, the
nation's fourth-largest.
   Or, like Chuck Powers, he might have his own consulting firm,
Resources for Responsible Management, to provide ``hands-on''
training for business managers and policy makers concerned about
whether the Golden Rule is obsolete in drawing the bottom line.
   Powers epitomizes the pilgrim's progress of the modern ethician
or ethicist, as they are now interchangeably called in personnel
job descriptions. He went from the faculty of the Yale Divinity
School to vice president for public policy at Cummins Engine, the
Indiana diesel manufacturer that was the first to introduce a
companywide ethics training program.
   Powers next was recruited by industry and government to found
the Health Effects Institute and Clean Sites, innovative,
non-profit organizations looking into problems of motor vehicle
exhausts and cleaning up toxic waste dumps.
   His wife, Barbara Ley Toffler, a psychologist in organizational
behavior with clients such as American Can, GTE, Aetna and even the
Internal Revenue Service, is his partner in the consulting firm
which does not advertise but depends on client referrals.
   Is there a livelihood in ministering to the troubled soul of
industry?
   ``The bottom line is that we made money last year,'' says
Barbara Toffler.
   Webster defines ethics as ``the philosophy of human conduct with
emphasis on the determination of right from wrong.'' Ethics pitches
its tent on the high ground beyond and sometimes contrary to what
the law allows.
   Fred Friendly, the former CBS news boss who hosted the PBS
ethics series, remembers well a gentle scolding by Supreme Court
Justice Potter Stewart: ``The trouble with your profession,
journalism, is that you are all confused about what you have a
right to do under the Constitution and the right thing to do.''

   Since the early days of the Vietnam War, most daily headlines
and leading items on the TV evening news have involved moral as
well as legal choices: The Pentagon papers. The Watergate break-in.
The village of My Lai. Pulling the plug on Karen Ann Quinlan. Lust
and greed among TV evangelists. Oliver North, hero or villain?
   Lt. Col. North argues he lied to Congress to serve a higher
good. Socrates defied the law in refusing to finger fellow
Athenians opposed to the rule of the 30 Tyrants. From jail cells,
Henry Thoreau and Martin Luther King urged disobedience to unjust
laws. Jeb Magruder said his role model for breaking the law in the
Watergate affair was his old ethics teacher at Yale, the Rev.
William Sloane Coffin, who ``recommended that students burn their
draft cards, shut down the city of Washington.''
   On ``house calls'' to industry, ethicist Newton shies from the
designation philosopher: ``That's someone who stands around the
water cooler all day,'' she says.'' A cartoon on her office door
comes closer to describing the role of the ethicist in industry. A
harried executive is pushing a button on the intercom and intoning:
``Miss Wattles, will you send someone in who knows right from
wrong.''
   Lately, leaders in the fields of government, medicine, law,
engineering, computers, journalism have been pushing the button for
an expert consultant to help write some ethical guidelines or deal
with cases of misconduct.
   A recent example of job opportunities for a latter-day Socrates
is the nationwide search conducted by Florida's Poynter Institute
for a theologian or philosopher to head up its Ethics Center. Three
other branches of this highly respected institute concentrate on
improving skills and standards of working journalists in writing,
graphics and management.
   ``We believe people at every level can be trained to think about
ethical dilemmas,'' says institute president Robert Haiman. ``So
when that big call comes up at 10:40 and you're going to press at
11, you have a more orderly way to approach it.
   ``A lot of these ethical calls have to be made by street
reporters. We're talking about reportorial behavior. Is it OK to
read upside down on somebody's desk? Is it OK to open a guy's file
cabinet while he's out of the office? Is it OK to lie about who you
are, to pretend you're an ambulance attendant or whatever?''
   Some at the top of the executive ladder argue that ethics
training should begin at the very bottom, long before college or
professional school.
   ``If an MBA candidate doesn't know the difference between
honesty and crime, between lying and telling the truth,'' wrote IBM
Chairman John Akers in a recent issue of the Sloane Management
Review, ``then business school, in all probability, will not
produce a convert.''
   Akers finds it ``ludicrous that even divinity schools and law
schools and departments of philosophy have to pay proctors to pad
up and down the aisles at examination time to make sure nobody is
looking at crib notes or copying from a neighbor.''
   An increasing number of Fortune 500 companies and countless
smaller firms are calling in experts to help draft a formal code of
ethics.
   Chemical Bank's ``Code of Ethics,'' which must be read and
signed by all its 30,000 employees worldwide, is among the most
widely copied. To translate the code into an ``operating
philosophy,'' more than 250 vice presidents have undergone a
two-day seminar on ``decision making and corporate values,''
presided over by the bank's chairman.
   The code is credited with Chemical's decision to create a
special lending unit for minority businesses and its refusal to
finance arms exporters and corporate raiders, or do business with
pornographers, massage parlors, and several countries run by
dictators.
   Chief executive officer James Burke calls Johnson and Johnson's
``credo,'' which dates back to 1945, ``the glue'' that held the
health care multinational together during two nightmare Tylenol
poisoning incidents and played ``the most important role'' in
withdrawing the capsules.
   The credo also dictated management's decision to stop
advertising their baby oil as a tanning lotion after medical
evidence showed the product speeded up the sun's harming effects on
the skin. Sales immediately plunged from $10 million to $5 million,
but again the firm bounced back.
   Why are ethics suddenly hot now?
   In the wake of the scandals in Wall Street, Chicago's commodity
market and defense contracts, there is an awareness that the
company which acts responsibly can avoid fines and jail sentences,
reduce court suits that entail costly legal and accounting fees,
diminish the threat of more government regulation, increase company
morale and attract a higher type, more loyal employee.
   ``There is a growing conviction that strong corporate culture
and ethics are a vital strategic key to survival and profitability
in a highly competitive era,'' concludes The Business Roundtable, a
public issues forum for some 200 top chief executive officers,
after an in-depth study of the corporate ethics of 10 leading
firms, including Boeing, Chemical Bank, General Mills and Xerox.
   A few weeks ago, New York's Harvard Club witnessed an unlikely
gathering of theologians, philosophers and Wall Street brokers and
analysts to launch ``Ethics in the Financial Marketplace,'' by John
Casey, managing director of the investment firm Scudder, Stevens
and Clark.
   When Casey, a disciple of Chuck Powers, sat down at his Apple II
word processor to write a ``how-to'' guide to responsible business
behavior, friends on Wall Street joked that it would be ``one of
the shortest books ever written.''
   The Rev. Langan, who never disguises the fact he is a Jesuit
priest when going into a firm, notes that the Yuppie philosophy of
grab it all quick any which way is somewhat in decline.
   ``Some of the fast-trackers are more cautious now that the
market is less giddy,'' he says. ``Also, when you see people barred
for life from the security industry, it gives pause to think.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ More than one-third of the estimated 122,000
Roman Catholic nuns and monks in the United States are now over age
70 while fewer and fewer young women and men are entering convents
and monasteries to support them. There are serious deficits in the
orders' retirement budgets, but the nuns are not afraid of being
put out on the streets because, as one sister in Michigan says,
``We care for one another.''

   For 53 years, Sister Alice Trese labored
in the Lord's vineyard as a college registrar and social worker for
the Sisters of St. Joseph.
   Now 89, Sister Alice spends her days in the order's retirement
home, a wing on the convent she entered as a young woman in 1929.
   ``I can't get used to the idea I can't do what I used to do,''
says Sister Alice, who worked as a receptionist and in the order's
laundry even after retiring seven years ago. ``I can't get used to
the idea of failing health.''
   Now, Sister Alice and her retired friends attend Mass every day,
say their rosaries, and root for the Detroit Tigers just like they
have since their younger days.
   These frail women of God are part of an aging breed of Roman
Catholic nuns and monks moving into retirement while fewer and
fewer young women and men are entering convents and monasteries to
support them.
   The result is a fiscal nightmare that has left an estimated $3
billion deficit in retirement budgets across the country, says
Sister Mary Oliver Hudon.
   She is director of a retirement project of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops, Conference of Major Superiors of
Men and the Leadership Conference of Women Religious.
   Nearly 36 percent of the estimated 122,000 nuns and monks in the
United States are over age 70 and less than 1 percent are under 30,
she says.
   ``The base that can support the older religious (nuns and monks)
has just been eroded away,'' she said.
   Few orders stashed money away for retirement, in part because
nuns worked for low wages and because they preferred to spend the
money building hospitals or adding services, Sister Mary Oliver
says.
   ``They made that choice on the assumption that when people were
no longer active, they died,'' she says. ``It sounds terrible, but
I don't think anybody foresaw the social changes'' that led to
longer life spans and far fewer people entering religious life.
   Diocesan priests, who aren't members of religious orders,
weren't included in the retirement project, she says. Their
pensions are funded by all the churches in the diocese for which
they worked, rather than a single order.
   The Sisters of St. Joseph mirror the national picture, with 220
of their 455 members retired, says Sister Betty Veenhuis, president
of the congregation.
   The order, founded 100 years ago by nuns from New York who came
west to staff Borgess Hospital in Kalamazoo, once had 950 members
working in hospitals, nursing homes, orphanages, and Catholic
schools across southern Michigan.
   Thirty years ago, Sister Betty says, as many as 50 young women
would have been preparing to enter the convent, which comprises the
spot on the map called Nazareth.
   Now it has only 18 women under 40 and just one woman _ in her
40s _ preparing for admission, she says. At the other end of the
spectrum, 13 are over 90.
   Sister Betty says mergers with other orders could bolster the
sisters' ranks in the future, as could discussions with a group of
about 100 lay people in the Kalamazoo area who want to be
affiliated in some way with the Sisters of St. Joseph.
   Like many orders, the Sisters of St. Joseph joined Social
Security in 1971 when the law was changed to permit nuns and monks
to make back payments and enter the system.
   Sister Emily Simons, treasurer of the order, says Social
Security provides just $2,000 of the $10,000 annual cost of caring
for a retired member. The rest comes from the earnings of younger
sisters, who take vows of poverty and turn their earnings over to
the order.
   But Sister Betty says that isn't enough and this year the order
will need to tap the interest on a retirement fund that it has been
paying into since 1971.
   Sister Emily says the congregation's assets, including its
members' earnings, Social Security, retirement fund and the
proceeds from selling all its property except the motherhouse,
would be 45 percent short of the amount needed to care for the
current members until their death.
   She estimates the deficit to be in the millions of dollars, but
declines to be more specific.
   The sisters know of the looming financial crisis and try to cut
corners, Sister Betty says.
   ``I don't think they at all fear that we're going to run out of
money and that they're going to be on the street,'' she says.
   ``It simply calls us to good stewardship and good planning and
good use of our resources over the next five or 10 years.''
   Sister Mary Oliver says some orders try to sell off their land
and buildings, but often can't find buyers for their aging
facilities.
   Despite the growing problem, she says, most orders still can pay
their bills.
   ``There is not a sister or brother I know of who is starving or
not getting medical care,'' she says. ``The crunch is going to come
in five to 10 years.''
   Sister Betty is putting her faith in old-fashioned Christian
charity and a committee that advises the order on investment
decisions.
   In December, Michigan Catholics contributed more than $1.45
million to a new fund set up to bail out religious orders, says
Sister Monica Kostelmy of the Michigan Catholic Conference.
   Final figures aren't in, but Sister Mary Oliver expects more
than $20 million will be collected nationwide in the first of 10
annual appeals.
   The funds will go first to desperate orders, such as one with 17
of its 18 members over 70, and then be divided among the others'
retirement funds, she says.
   Sister Betty says the Sisters of St. Joseph will stick together,
rather than going back to their families or elsewhere for care in
their twilight years.
   ``We care for one another,'' she says.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ She's the buffer between the people and the
communist-run bureaucracy in troubled Poland, a country where the
average wait for an apartment is 15 years, 13 years for a
telephone. In her first year as the government's ombudsman, Ewa
Letowska has received 55,000 complaints, far surpassing the cases
handled by her counterparts in the West.

   Ewa Letowska, the first and only
government ombudsman in the East bloc, likes to tell the tale of
two frogs who fell into a vat of milk: One drowned but the other
kept swimming until he churned butter and climbed out.
   She's been swimming hard for a year now.
   When Mrs. Letowska opened Poland's ombudsman's office in January
1988, she had 1,800 letters on her desk and 18 people waiting in
line. And the deluge hasn't subsided. She has received 55,000
cases, an ``absolute world record,'' and many times the number
facing her 40 or so counterparts in the West.
   Why have so many Poles turned to her for help?
   ``Frustration'' is Mrs. Letowska's explanation.
   The Polish parliament created the ombudsman's office in July
1987 as part of legal reforms aimed at curbing abuse by the
communist-run bureaucracy and making government agencies more
accountable.
   The law allows the ombudsman to operate independently during her
four-year term, with immunity from prosecution. She can demand
information from officials for her investigations _ except in cases
involving the military, national security or state secrets _ and
file administrative or court appeals.
   It took an extensive search to find an ombudsman acceptable to
the government while independent enough not to be dismissed
out-of-hand by the opposition led by the Solidarity union.
   Mrs. Letowska, an exuberant, erudite 48-year-old expert on civil
law and consumer rights, started work on Jan. 4, 1988 with no
staff, no equipment and no methodology.
   ``The first day of the ombudsman's work opened a great stream of
complaints against everything and everybody and, after one month,
another wave, this time of curses and abuses from people who didn't
receive answers,'' she told the parliament in her first annual
report.
   There is plenty for Poles to complain about, from 15-year waits
for housing to the seemingly inconquerable mazes of forms, stamps
and ``arrangements'' required for many transactions.
   Mrs. Letowska says the volume of cases forces her to look for
groups representing ``typical, repeatable mistakes of the legal
system and functioning of the state violating people's rights and
freedoms.''
   For example, she took on numerous cases concerning Warsaw
landowners still not compensated as promised for properties
nationalized after World War II. Parliament now has ordered the
claims be resolved.
   Mrs. Letowska, who is also host of a radio program on opera with
her lawyer husband, discusses her work in a newspaper column and on
a television show. She recently delivered a lecture at the European
Law Center in London.
   She has compared notes with the other ombudsmen in the West and
non-aligned Yugoslavia and found ``the only difference is the
number of cases, and maybe the expectations, because people there
probably don't want apartments from them since they have them
already.''
   Mrs. Letowska says she looks at the legal issues in a case, not
the political issues.
   As she puts it, ``I don't deal with political prisoners. I deal
with toilets in prisons. If there are cleaner toilets, both
political prisoners and non-political prisoners will benefit.''
   This legalistic path can be hard to follow in politicized
Poland. The head of the Solidarity commission monitoring human
rights faults Mrs. Letowska for a reluctance to take on political
cases or drastic cases of corruption, but he directs most of his
criticism at the system itself.
   ``The ombudsman's office is an institution that is in a rather
hopeless situation,'' says Zbigniew Romaszewski. ``The legal system
of this country is simply broken and there is general anarchy. The
authorities have used the law completely as an instrument and
destroyed it in this way.''
   Mrs. Letowska, who describes herself as ``a lawyer from head to
toe, not a bureaucrat,'' also is disturbed by the degree of
distrust for the government bureaucracy that decides pensions and
the like.
   But, she adds, ``It's not that everything is being regulated
from the top. There is the law.''
   In a country where the average wait to get a telephone is 13
years, Mrs. Letowska ruled recently that telephone workers should
not have priority for obtaining phone service, as had been provided
by a special regulation. Such privileges, she said, give rise to
``a sense of social injustice.''
   Yet she does not argue against special shops for miners and free
electricity for power workers when institutionalized as laws.
   ``There is a fundamental difference between legal acts granting
privileges to specific professional groups of special significance
to the national economy and privileges usurped by...internal
regulations,'' she wrote.
   During her first year, Mrs. Letowska organized doctors to handle
prison health complaints, filed nine appeals to Poland's supreme
court, looked into complaints that letters from the West are held
up or damaged by the post office, and took up the causes _ among
many others _ of a prisoner trying to get information about her
children at an orphanage, a woman denounced by a son-in-law trying
to get her apartment, and the widow of an officer executed during
the Stalinist period.
   There are 55 lawyers and office workers handling the cases, but
no computer. Three guards keep a list of waiting clients and two
aides screen for emergency cases.
   About 23 percent of the complaints filed with the ombudsman
concern the justice system, and about the same percentage involve
social welfare problems, such as pensions and insurance.
   Seventeen percent have to do with housing, 12 percent with
property disputes, another 12 percent concern financial matters and
3 percent with education, cultural and health service problems.
   About 10 percent of her cases concern civil rights but Mrs.
Letowska says surprisingly few are purely political.
   ``There is a general picture in the West that people are
repressed or fired from their jobs for their views,'' she says.
While that's often true, she says, sometimes politics has nothing
to do with the firing.
   She cites as an example an engineer at a town's only factory who
has a fight with his boss.
   ``The guy will say, `They are harassing me because of political
reasons,' and there are no politics in the whole case.
   ``I cannot convince those people they are not being repressed
for their views, but for everything in general. Such cases wouldn't
see daylight in the West.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ He's been called the ``Wizard of Weston,'' a
professional inventor who doesn't believe in wasting his time on
products that won't sell. But one of the problems inventors have,
says Stanley Mason, is selling their ideas to the companies that
employ them. To help remedy that, he's teaching a course on
creativity to a group of graduate business students.

   Inventor Stanley Mason, who lays claim to
the world's first microwave cookware, the squeezable ketchup bottle
and the granola bar, among other things, says he's seen a lot of
million-dollar ideas get lost because of a lack of vision in
corporate America.
   Like the disposable diaper he designed and the company ignored.
   Mason, who's been called ``the Wizard of Weston,'' hopes to do
his part to remedy that shortsightedness with a course on
creativity he's teaching to graduate business students at the
University of Connecticut's Stamford campus.
   The white-haired, 67-year-old inventor has a laboratory in a
two-story barn where elaborate _ and secret _ experiments are in
progress. There are blackboards and long conference tables for
brainstorming sessions.
   Mason isn't trying to turn his students into Thomas Edisons, but
he does think he can impart some of his curiosity and ability to
think creatively, which he credits for the 30 patents he holds.
   ``In large companies, people are divided up into departments
that are so insular, they don't understand what goes on in the next
office,'' Mason said during a recent interview at Simco Inc., the
product development company he founded in 1973 after a corporate
career that included stints with Hunt Foods Inc., the Glenn L.
Martin Co., Armstrong Cork Co. Inc., American Can Co. and U.S.
Steel Corp.
   ``They don't understand the totality, the continuum, the
interaction between products and consumer. It's possible, with
patience, to teach people how to think in a creative way, how to
take a tentative point of view about everything, how not to be so
damn sure about everything.''
   Norman C. Parrish of Moraga, Calif., president of the National
Congress of Inventor Organizations, calls Mason ``one of the most
widely respected inventors'' in America.
   Mason's work, he says, is ``valuable enough that Johnson &amp;
Johnson and companies of that caliber give him essentially open
contracts to come up with new products for them.''
   Most people make the mistake of thinking that being an inventor
simply means dreaming up a great idea, Mason says, but the
successful inventor is someone who recognizes the market for a
product that doesn't yet exist, and figures out how to provide it.
   ``Edison's greatest invention was not the electric light or the
phonograph,'' he says. ``His greatest invention was the product
development laboratory.
   ``Edison was a real psychologist. He knew what could sell. He
didn't invent things that couldn't sell. He didn't waste his time.''
   Mason's 15-week course consists of a series of three-hour
seminars that include lectures by successful entrepreneurs and
exercises designed to stretch the students' minds.
   For one recent assignment, he sent students into a Norwalk store
and told them to pick out a product that they as consumers thought
needed improvement. They returned to the classroom, divided up into
three companies, and spent the rest of the night playing ideas off
each other.
   ``It sort of frees one's way of thinking,'' says David Chang, a
research chemist at Clairol Inc. who is working toward his master's
in business administration. ``It will be very, very helpful to
people in technical management.''
   Mason has experienced the frustrations of corporate life
firsthand.
   In the 1970s, when he developed Masonware, which he says was the
first cookware for microwaves, Mason was told by a major American
corporation there was no market for it. Today, such cookware is a
$350 million-a-year business, he says.
   When he developed the granola bar as an alternative snack
product for Nestle S A in the 1970s, the company decided it wasn't
interested. Quaker Oats Co. and others eventually came out with
their own.
   Then there was the disposable diaper debacle. Mason was
exasperated trying to put a square diaper on his son's round bottom
_ not to mention the drudgery of laundry and those painful pricks
from safety pins.
   So when he was working for a major paper-products company, he
designed a disposable diaper lined with soft, absorbent paper,
shaped like an hourglass to fit a baby's bottom, and substituted
sticky tape for pins.
   The company patented the invention and Mason got $100 for his
efforts. The company, which he didn't want to be identified, sold
the patent rights to another corporation, which also failed to act
on the idea.
   Since then, shaped disposable diapers have become a
billion-dollar product line.
   Such lack of vision helps explain why half the patents issued in
America last year went to inventors outside the country, Mason says.
   ``Product development is a risky business,'' he says. ``There's
no security in working in product development in any U.S. company
because if the product doesn't work, they kill the messenger.''
   According to one survey, the average tenure for research
directors at American corporations is only 13 or 14 months, Mason
says.
   ``I've worked for lots of companies _ I've been fired from lots
of companies,'' he says.
   Today, Simco's clients include 40 Fortune 500 companies, such as
Johnson &amp; Johnson, Kimberly-Clark Corp., Proctor &amp; Gamble Co.,
Hunt-Wesson Foods Inc. and Primerica Corp.
   It has a full-time staff of about eight employees, plus about
125 associates, mostly academics, who provide creative input on
various projects, such as Mason's latest venture: How to get
petroleum substitutes, including fuel, from Chinese tallow trees.
   That project has been funded in part by the National Science
Foundation, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the state of
Hawaii.
   Among his other inventions: the first plastic underwire bra for
Playtex, a super-strong Velcro for Velcro Fastening Systems, a
burglar alarm that hangs on a doorknob and square milk jugs that
save shipping space.
   Mason dates his first invention to his youth, when he sold a
slingshot-like weapon to scores of friends. His inventive spirit
was nurtured by his father, an electrician who developed the first
electric chair for the state of New Jersey, Mason says.
   His first real job was as a teen-ager at the Trenton Free Public
Library, which also served as one of 12 regional depositories for
patents issued by the U.S. Patent Office. He'd spend hours poring
over other people's inventions, and realized that's what he wanted
to do with his life.
   ``Part of what I do is feed my unconscious and conscious brain
with lots of things,'' he says. ``It's furniture you move around in
your head and the more that you have there, the more connections
take place.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ When Hollywood producers take their cameras to
Nevada, as they are doing more and more these days, they rely on a
former New York model to pave the way and round up a cast of
extras. She's Christine O'Rourke, who operates the only movie
location management company in the state.
</TEXT>

<NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It takes a lot of chutzpah to close down
a busy section of Interstate 15, orchestrate a simulated shootout
in a crowded airport lobby, or fake the firebombing of a casino on
the Las Vegas Strip.
   But for a former New York model, such challenges have become
routine.
   Christine O'Rourke, who saw dreams of a modeling career derailed
19 years ago, now runs the only licensed movie casting and location
management company in Nevada.
   In that role, she finds her ingenuity tested almost daily by
Hollywood producers, taking part in the production of films such as
``Rain Man,'' which won the Oscar as the best picture of 1988,
``Midnight Run,'' ``Heat,'' ``Starman'' and the television series
``Crime Story.''
   Her toughest assignment was setting up a scene in which a casino
was firebombed _ a near impossible feat in a city where gaming
executives are skittish about even having photographs taken in
their establishments.
   The firebombing was shot for one of the episodes of the TV
series ``Crime Story.''
   ``We had to clear everything through security, deal with fire
codes, get clearance of city and county officials, etc.,'' O'Rourke
recalls, sitting in an office lined with autographed photos of
stars with whom she's worked. ``We had to practice the scene, then
shut down the entire casino operation to make it work.''
   Another scene involved tossing a Molotov cocktail in a
restaurant.
   ``It takes a lot of finesse to get an owner to let you do
something like that,'' she says, laughing.
   She found herself enlisting the aid of the governor's office in
closing a section of I-15, the main artery between Las Vegas and
Los Angeles, to film a scene for ``Starman.''
   On other occasions, has cleared a mountain of legal and public
relations problems to close down sections of the Las Vegas Strip
and downtown's Glitter Gulch.
   ``You've got to get the approval of every casino owner who's
affected,'' she explains. ``You've got to go to all the property
owners, even the guy who runs the hot dog stand and the owner of
the pawnshop. If just one of them says no, it's my job to convince
them it would be good for them.''
   O'Rourke handled the Nevada locations and casting of extras for
``Rain Man.''
   But she found ``Midnight Run'' one of her toughest challenges,
especially a scene filmed at McCarran International Airport in Las
Vegas.
   ``These people were sticklers for realism,'' she recalls. ``They
wanted real cops, real FBI agents. They said, `If you can't get us
real cops and FBI men, we'll find someone who can.'''
   O'Rourke found herself calling powerful Clark County Sheriff
John Moran in the pre-dawn hours one day to enlist his aid in the
search for extras. She delivered, and the airport scene, involving
400 extras, was one of the more dramatic segments of the hit film.
   The airport scene was not without its problems.
   She blocked off the ticketing counters at the busy facility,
filming overnight when traffic was lightest.
   ``We had signs up to indicate we were filming, but it still
caused a scene when someone shouted, `Look out, he's got a gun,'
and everyone started pulling guns,'' she says.
   Martin Sheen needed soldiers in his upcoming movie
``Nightbreaker.'' The extras were to portray American servicemen
used in atmospheric nuclear testing at the Nevada Test Site in the
1950s. Veterans have contended they were subjected to radioactive
fallout from the testing, a charge denied by the government.
   The sensitive nature of the film ruled out government agencies
as a source for the extras. So O'Rourke recruited high school and
college ROTC students to provide the needed manpower.
   She enlisted the aid of the principal at her children's
elementary school when a producer wanted two Eskimo kids, a
Russian-looking youngster, and a 10-year-old Mr. T look-alike.
   The heady world of Hollywood was something of a natural
progression for O'Rourke, 38, who began modeling in her hometown of
San Jose, Calif. at the age of 15. She headed for New York City two
years later, modeling for magazines such as ``Seventeen.''
   That career came to a halt when she married at the age of 19. A
divorce, then a move to Las Vegas nine years ago found her
searching for a new career while trying to support her children,
Patrick, 13, and Tara, 12.
   She started Spectrum Services, her location and casting company,
on less than $100.
   The use of Nevada locations in filming motion pictures is
growing annually, with direct film revenues to the state topping
$50 million last year _ 10 times the revenues generated five years
ago.
   Much of Nevada's recent success in wooing Hollywood producers
can be attributed to Robert Hirsch and his state Motion Picture
Division.
   Las Vegas offers many attractive features for filmmakers,
O'Rourke says.
   ``This is a 24-hour town,'' she says. ``You can film anytime of
the day or night. There's a lot of lore and history. It's an
attractive area.
   ``And Nevada is something of a last frontier. It's the last
state where you can come in and do a tremendous amount of things
without a lot of red tape.''

   Peter Ustinov's round-the-world travel
schedule would give the Jules Verne characters of Phileas Fogg and
Detective Fixx a serious case of jet lag.
   Ustinov, winner of two Oscars and three Emmys, was in Los
Angeles recently to talk about his role as Fixx, the intrepid
English detective who trails Fogg in the NBC miniseries ``Around
the World in 80 Days.'' The comic adventure, featuring Pierce
Brosnan as Fogg and dozens of other stars in cameo roles, will be
televised Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.
   The day before his arrival here, Ustinov had been in the
Netherlands Antilles, resting, working on a novel called
``Reunion'' while it rained, and soaking up sunshine on the few
days when it wasn't.
   (``I write in longhand,'' says Ustinov, who has published four
novels and two books about Russia. ``All I need is a monk to
illuminate the first letter of each chapter. I'm very old
fashioned.'')
   Before the Antilles, Ustinov had been in Hamburg, West Germany,
for a celebration of Former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's 70th
birthday.
   Ustinov lives in Switzerland and Paris with his French-born
wife, Helene.
   This was Ustinov's second offer to play the role of Detective
Fixx. The first came in 1956 when Mike Todd made his version of the
Jules Verne novel about an English gentleman who bets his entire
fortune that he can circle the Earth in 80 days. Fixx chases after
Fogg in the mistaken belief that he has robbed the Bank of England.
   ``Mike Todd asked me to do it,'' Ustinov recalls, ``but I had a
contract with 20th Century Fox, which had money invested in
CinemaScope and didn't want Todd to succeed with his Todd-AO
wide-screen process. They wanted me to play Van Johnson's sidekick
in `23 Paces to Baker Street.' I got out of that, but still
couldn't do `Around the World.' Now, 30 years later, I have the
satisfaction.''
   His present role came about when he was offered a cameo in the
miniseries.
   ``However much they tempt you with money,'' he says, ``it's very
unsatisfying to go off having tasted food and not being able to
swallow. Then they suggested another cameo. I said I just didn't
like cameos.
   ``Then they said how about Fixx? I said that was possible. With
Fixx I had my revenge on all the sergeants in the army. He's very
much like sergeants _ plebian, shrewd, stupid, everything mixed.''
   Ustinov, a private in the British Army in World War II, said he
made Detective Fixx into a touching figure.
   ``He's an idealist,'' Ustinov says. ``He's in love with a very
unlovely woman. In times of stress, he consults her picture. In the
end, he marries her.''
   Ustinov's work on ``Around the World in 80 Days'' added to his
reputation as a world traveler. He filmed in Macao, Bangkok, Hong
Kong, San Francisco, Liverpool and Yugoslavia.
   ``We filmed on a plain east of Belgrade for China,'' he says.
``I wondered where they were going to get all the Chinese needed
for the scenes. Even if we raided all the Chinese restaurants, I
didn't think we'd find enough people. But, they showed up. I said
where did they all come from? I was told they were in Yugoslavia to
study Serbian.''
   The three-part series also stars Eric Idle as Passepartout and
Julia Nickson as Princess Aouda.
   After he completed work on the miniseries, Ustinov immediately
went to work on an Italian movie called ``The Paradise of Dogs.''
   ``I played a veterinarian who drinks,'' he says. ``It's a comedy
and they said it's like Disney. I said it's not like Disney, it's
Italian. It's a rather charming observation of people and animals.
He drinks to get rid of his inhibitions so he can communicate
better with the animals. That itself is very Italian.''
   Ustinov will also appear in a French miniseries commemorating
the bicentennial of the French Revolution. He plays Mirabeau in the
show, which also stars Jane Seymour and Klaus Maria Brandau.
   On Feb. 1, Ustinov was inducted into the French Academy of Fine
Arts, filling the vacancy created by the death of Orson Welles. His
sword was made by his son, a sculptor, and youngest daughter, a
jeweler.
   Ustinov, who won his Oscars for ``Spartacus'' and ``Topkapi,''
is also well-known for playing another detective, Hercule Poirot.
He played the Agatha Christie creation in three feature films and
three television movies.
   ``Poirot did nothing but ask questions and ask them in an
interesting way,'' Ustinov says. ``It can be exhausting. Only in
the last 10 minutes do you have the luxury of expanding and
explaining why everything happened as it did.
   ``Agatha Christie was jealous of her creation. Despite all her
other work, publishers kept asking for more Poirot stories. She
treated it as an attempt to take over her authority. She finally
wrote a story killing him off and put it away. When she became ill
her daughter authorized its publication.
   ``She had the pleasure of killing off Poirot a few days before
she went herself.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Musicals that flop out of town rarely are
resurrected on Broadway. One exception is ``Chu Chem,'' which
folded in Philadelphia in 1966 and now has found a new life nearly
23 years later at New York's Ritz Theater.
   ``It's the longest work-in-progress in the history of
Broadway,'' jokes Mitch Leigh, the man who wrote the music for this
show about a Jewish community in 16th-century China. Leigh also is
co-producer of the latest and, he hopes, final version.
   ```Chu Chem' was never finished in Philadelphia,'' Leigh says.
``We knew what was wrong. We just never rewrote it.''
   For its four creators and especially Leigh, the new ``Chu Chem''
is more than a revival. It is a tying up of loose ends, a
completion of tasks left undone.
   ``It all started when I was approaching my 60th birthday,'' the
61-year-old Leigh says. ``I was thinking about what I hadn't done
in my life that I wanted to do. One thing was to play my music in a
jazz band, which I eventually did at the Metropolitan Museum of Art
last year. The other was `Chu Chem.'''
   The idea for the show originated with Ted Allan, a Canadian
actor and writer, who first thought about ``Chu Chem'' more than 30
years ago during a visit to China.
   ``I discovered that there were still people in a town called
Kaifeng who called themselves Hebrews,'' he recalls. ``Then I began
to match my knowledge of Talmudic folk tales with what I was
discovering about Chinese folk tales. They were similar.''
   What Allan learned eventually evolved into the book of ``Chu
Chem,'' the story of the search by an old man and his family for a
lost tribe of Jews in China.
   ``I wrote it for Zero Mostel,'' the author says. ``But Zero
turned it down and went into something called `Fiddler on the
Roof.'''
   But Mostel showed the script to director Albert Marre who
brought in Leigh. ``Chu Chem'' was on its way _ at least as far as
Philadelphia. The show, which starred Menasha Skulnik as the aging
patriarch and Molly Picon as his wife, died there, the victim of
poor reviews and the departure of Miss Picon who left the cast even
before opening night.
   ``In Philadelphia we were guilty of overkill,'' says co-lyricist
Jim Haines. ``The story got subverted. Its poignancy, its humor,
its simple beauty and what it was trying to say were lost.''
   Leigh agrees. He and Marre felt that lurking in the flop show
was a marvelous musical. But work on it didn't resume until the
middle of 1986 when the director and composer got together with
Allan. Soon Haines and co-lyricist Jack Wohl got involved again.
   Getting the collaborators together wasn't easy. Leigh, the
composer of ``Man of La Mancha'' and producer of Yul Brynner's last
marathon tour of ``The King and I,'' lives in New York. Allan
resides in Toronto. Wohl lives in Los Angeles, while Haines makes
his home in South Africa.
   ``I stopped getting bills from the telephone company. I got
thank-you notes,'' Wohl says. ``It was difficult for us to get
together, but when we did, it was very rewarding.''
   ``Let me put it another way,'' says Leigh. ``It's very difficult
to argue under those circumstances.''
   Allan eliminated the mother from the tale, so the plot could
focus on the relationship between the father and his outspoken
daughter as well as a love story between the daughter and a Chinese
prince. Leigh added four new melodies, while Wohl and Haines
rewrote 80 percent of the lyrics.
   ``Once we had agreed to do this rewrite, we all felt very secure
having Mitch around,'' Allan says. ``We felt secure because he not
only wrote good music, but we knew he had a lot of experience
producing shows. I sensed that if we came up with something good,
Mitch would get it on.
   ``Basically, it's a new play but we held onto the old title
because we were all in love with it,'' Allan says. ``I saw it
always for what it was. Meaning, that if it were done, it's a
fable. It's a fairy tale.''
   The new incarnation of ``Chu Chem'' was first done last December
at the Jewish Repertory Theater, a tiny playhouse on 14th Street.
   ``The purpose of the production downtown was to get `Chu Chem'
on its feet so people could hear it,'' Wohl says. And they liked
what they heard. The show created enough box-office interest that
it could have run for two years at the 99-seat theater.
   ``The discipline imposed on the collaborators at JRT forced us
to keep the show's simplicity intact,'' Haines says. ``What emerged
was a simple, beautiful, poignant piece of work.''
   The reviews also were positive, encouraging Leigh and
co-producer William Rollnick to move the musical to Broadway and
the Ritz. Leigh knows he is taking a chance with a modest musical
with a cast of unknown performers, headed by Mark Zeller and Emily
Zacharias, by subjecting it to the harsh light and economics of
Broadway.
   But he believes good word-of-mouth and cheaper-than-usual
tickets, priced under $40, will bring in theatergoers. Even if it
doesn't, Leigh believes he has been paid back.
   ``The resurrection of `Chu Chem' was my interest,'' he says.
``The fact that it occurred means I already have been paid off. It
will now exist for all time as a musical, and that's enough for
me.''

<HEAD>Israeli Soldiers Feel Both Anger and Guilt in Arab Uprising</HEAD>

   Dozens of times every day in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip, Israeli soldiers face young Palestinians
throwing stones. Anger builds steadily in many of the soldiers _
reserves called up from civilian life _ and the order comes to
drive them off. Then comes the guilt, the guilt that some of the
Israelis will carry with them perhaps for life. An Associated Press
correspondent talked to Israeli veterans of the Arab uprising in
the occupied territories. This is her report.

   In hot pursuit of a stone thrower, an Israeli
lieutenant charged into an Arab home and and began bashing his
night stick down on beds to rouse a suspect. A tiny quiver under
one bedcover suddenly stopped him.
   Trembling, the officer pulled back the cover and lifted a baby
boy from the bed. He gently cuddled the infant and handed him to
his frightened mother.
   Then he bolted out the door.
   ``He went crazy thinking that if he hadn't stopped banging that
stick in time, he would have killed that baby,'' said Moshe Golan,
a reserve paratrooper who was with the officer named Itzik during
the angry search for a young Palestinian stone thrower who had
injured a fellow soldier.
   Nearly a year later Golan recalls Itzik's words as they left the
house in the occupied West Bank.
   ``Moshe, hold me before I collapse. You don't know what I almost
did.''
   The encounter was one of dozens occurring daily as the Israeli
army tries to halt the Palestinian uprising in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Fifteen months after the revolt began, some
soldiers have begun questioning their role in putting down the
civilian rebellion.
   The questions have surfacd in letters to newspapers and to
members of the Knesset, Israel's parliament, and in one angry
exchange with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir when he visited reserve
paratroopers in the West Bank.
   More than 100,000 Israeli soldiers have served in the occupied
territories and the reactions are mixed.
   Some feel guilt over harsh methods used against youthful stone
throwers, some in their pre-teens. Others feel the army has an
undeserved mean image, that in fact soldiers' moral scruples get in
the way of effectively halting the revolt.
   Many feel ambivalent about their actions. Soldiers tell of being
demoralized by confrontations with Arab youths who curse them and
hurl stones even under gunfire, making troops feel they are
fighting a losing battle. The frustration often makes them lose
their tempers.
   Combat training, they add, has left them unprepared to fight
civil insurrection, where soldiers must hesitate to open fire
because their enemies don't use guns. Some soldiers were sent to
quell protests while still in basic training.
   Golan, who served two months in the West Bank, was among
soldiers and army officials interviewed by The Associated Press on
the troops' feelings about their role in the occupied lands.
   ``I feel constant conflict,'' he said. ``After all an Arab is a
human being. But even the most moderate guys tend to get this
feeling they have to grab the first Arab and take out all their
anger on him, to beat him or break his bones.''
   Golan now is a nature guide.
   Doru Ehrlich, a 36-year-old reserve artilleryman, said his
service in the West Bank town of Qalqilya left him with the same
confusion.
   ``I have a guilty conscience ... about doing things like going
into homes to arrest people.'' he said. ``You go to conduct an
arrest. They're all sleeping on the floor. A small boy wakes up
with your gun in his face. I think of my own son.''
   But Erhlich added that he thought the army had no choice in
doing what it has been doing and perhaps should try even stronger
measures.
   ``I've gotten to the point where I'm sick of it all. We have to
make a decision. Either get an order to open up machinegun fire on
them or to the contrary. But just to get this over with.''
   Erhlich described an instance where he lost his temper after
giving some youngsters candy, then spotting the same children
gathering to throw stones at his patrol.
   ``I wanted to slam somebody I was so angry. It makes you feel
like doing things you don't want to do. They get you into such a
mood that even if you want to remain human, they don't let you.''
   Ehrlich said he searched an entire week for one of the boys.
   ``Finally I found him. I found out where he lived. I even found
a hatchet in his house. That kid, when I caught him, I just bashed
him in the head. Even if you love children, at that same moment
you're going to hit him. It's just because you're there.''

   Prime Minister Shamir, facing the anger and frustration of
soldiers on a visit to troops in the West Bank, tried to encourage
the soldiers by blaming the Palestinian Liberation Organinzation
and saying Israel's security was at stake.
   ``They force us to bear arms,'' he said.
   Army officials also have repeatedly said troops open fire only
when their lives are in danger from barrages of stones.
   Among the six troops killed in the uprising, one has died during
a stone-throwing incident. His skull was crushed by a concrete
block dropped from a roof. More than 400 Palestinians have died in
the revolt, most by Israeli gunfire.
   But some soldiers said they rarely felt danger from the stones
and added that anger or a hurt sense of national pride could incite
them to react violently.
   ``You feel like you're playing a game of tag _ we can run around
and make you run after us,'' said Neil Shergin, 25, an immigrant
from Rockville, Md., who spent about two months in the Gaza Strip
and West Bank.
   ``They're quite courageous. If I saw a number of soldiers with
automatic weapons in their hands I'd be asking what I could do for
them and not what I could throw at them.''
   Soldiers also say that orders on when to open fire or beat
protesters are too vague, leaving too much to the discretion of
individual soldiers in the heat of a clash.
   Controversy over these orders has emerged in the still
unfinished trial of four troops charged with beating a 42-year-old
Palestinian man to death in the Gaza Strip while conducting an
arrest last August.
   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the Israeli military chief of staff,
acknowledged at the trial that standing orders left ``many gray
areas.''
   ``There can be some incident where commands are not clear, even
with the best of soldiers,'' Shomron testified. A civilian who
resists arrest can be beaten, he said, ``but when someone stops
resisting, that is a matter of opinion.''
   Some 50 troops have been formally charged or punished for
illegal beatings and shootings during the uprising. The army
acknowledges others have been punished by officers in individual
units, but no record is available of how many.
   On the other hand, about 60 soldiers have been tried for
refusing duty in the occupied territories. The small number results
from Israelis' pride in their citizen army, in which all Jewish men
and women do compulsory duty. Men serve in the reserves until age
55.
   The army has started to replace some reserve soldiers in the
territories with border police to cut down reserve duty, which rose
to 62 days from the normal 42 days last year because of the
uprising. They also hope the border police, better trained in riot
control, can cut down the number of civilian casualties.
   Army authorities have acknowledged that some casualties grow
from soldiers' fits of temper.
   ``I know it happens and we try to prevent it,'' said Brig. Gen.
Ehud Gross, the army's chief education officer who is in charge of
a new program to help soldiers cope with their role as policemen.
   ``This is not a normal situation for military forces who have
been fighting for survival for 40 years in real wars,'' he said.
``We have to face something new in which we really cannot use the
power we have.''

<HEAD>Star Watch: A 74-Year-Old Wonder of the Movie Season</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert Wise is the wonder of the movie
season: a 74-year-old Oscar winner who has directed an
action-filled, tightly budgeted movie on the mean streets of
Manhattan's lower East Side.
   ``Rooftops'' has proved less than a wonder with critics and at
the box office, but reviewers have generally praised Wise's
direction. And more than one observer has marveled at his
achievement after a 10-year layoff.
   ``I hadn't been on a set for so long that I didn't know how I
would go,'' he admitted in an interview at his Beverly Hills
office. ``I found I got right back into it as if I had never missed
a beat. I think I really had the respect of the crew people who
were there. I had several of the crew say, `Hey, what kind of
vitamins are you taking? You're always up here ahead of us.'
   ``It felt good. I don't intend for it to be another eight-10
years before I do another film.''
   ``Rooftops'' concerns homeless youngsters who occupy the roofs
of abandoned tenements, and the drug dealers who prey on the
neighborhood. It may seem like an unlikely subject for the
producer-director of ``The Sound of Music,'' but Wise, who also did
another street movie, ``West Side Story,'' doesn't think so.
   ``When you look back over my films,'' he pointed out, ``you'll
see I've had a wide range of genres.''
   Indeed, his first film as director was ``The Curse of the Cat
People'' in 1943. His credits include Westerns (``Tribute to a Bad
Man''), science fiction (``The Day the Earth Stood Still,'' ``The
Andromeda Strain''), dramas (``I Want to Live,'' ``Somebody Up
There Likes Me''), romance (``Two for the Seesaw'') and war films
(``Run Silent, Run Deep,'' ``The Sand Pebbles'').
   Wise was approached for ``Rooftops'' by Howard W. Koch Jr., who
was producing the film for Taylor Hackford's New Visions company.
The director was attracted to the idea of working with young people
in a contemporary setting. Although not a musical, the film
included ``combat dancing'' and the Afro-Brazilian martial arts
Capoeira, all set to a rock score.
   ``I admit that is not my style of music,'' Wise said, ``but I
had a lot of help from Taylor and Howard, who are more familiar
with it.''
   Wise's last film, ``Star Trek: The Motion Picture,'' had an
open-end budget that reportedly reached $50 million. ``Rooftops ''
was something else.
   ``I started out making films in the 1940s on 20-day schedules
and budgets of $150,000,'' he recalled. ```Rooftops' was nothing
like that; we shot for 45-46 days, and the budget was about $8
million, which is a modest picture nowadays.
   ``I had a fine crew in New York, and we worked very hard. We did
put in long days. ... One day it was 17 hours when we shot a disco
scene, starting at 7 in the morning and finishing at midnight. I
think the picture indicates a lot of that work and effort. It shows
the backgrounds of lower East Side in fine style.''
   Born in Westchester, Ind., Robert Wise came West to enter the
movie business and landed a job in the editing department of RKO in
1933. His editing of ``Citizen Kane'' won his first Academy Award
nomination in 1940. After serving his apprenticeship as director,
he became known as a man who could deal with varied temperaments
and complex productions.
   Wise has been laden with honors, including Oscars for ``The
Sound of Music'' and ``West Side Story'' (for which Jerome Robbins
shared director's credit), and the Academy's Irving Thalberg award.
One of Hollywood's civic-minded figures, he has served as president
of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences, and the Directors
Guild of America.
   Why the long lapse between ``Star Trek'' and ``Rooftops''?
   ``I didn't plan it that way,'' Wise replied. ``I got very busy
with the Academy, where I served three years as president, and the
Directors Guild, chairing its 50th anniversary. I've done a lot of
work with the American Film Institute and I've spoken at
universities.
   ``I spent 22 months preparing the musical of `Zorba,' working on
the script with Ernie Lehman and the music with Saul Chaplin (his
`Sound of Music' collaborators). We had scouted locations, worked
on casting (Anthony Quinn, John Travolta) and were ready to start
production. Then the bottom fell out of Cannon Films.''
   Wise also worked on a love story to be filmed in China, and
biographies of Mae West and singer Anita O'Day; all were abandoned.
He is now considering other projects, but hasn't decided on his
next one.

<HEAD>The Artists: New Berlioz Biography Hailed As Classic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He was the son of a country doctor who rebelled
against his father, went to Paris with no musical training and
within eight years had written one of the world's greatest
symphonies.
   Now the life of Hector Berlioz, the grand 19th-century romantic,
the Frenchman of whom Paganini once said, ``You begin where the
others leave off,''n a new biography that is
already being hailed  is celebrated ias a classic.
   The plaudits should please the University of California. Author
David Cairns, a London music critic, drafted more than a third of
``Berlioz 1803-1832: The Making of an Artist'' at the university in
Davis where he spent two terms as a visiting professor.
   ``Kern Holoman, chairman of the music department there, arranged
it and it meant I was free from journalism. He's one of the world's
leading Berlioz scholars and is writing a life-and-works of the
composer,'' the author said.
   Asked why he got such help on what might be seen as a rival
project, Cairns explained: ``Holoman is a friend of mine and it's
good for the prestige of a university to be able to say a book that
might be well regarded waentury biographies.
   Hugh Canning in The Guardian judged it ``one of the most
important composer biographies of our times.''
   Berlioz was famous for the ``Symphonie fantastique,'' which
mirrors his passion for the Irish actress Harriet Smithson and
which can always fill a modern concert hall.
   Cairns sees parallels between Berlioz and Daniel Barenboim, the
Israeli pianist and conductor, who was fired in January as musical
and artistic director of the new Paris Bastille Opera for allegedly
demanding too much money and not providing the required repertory.
   Berlioz often complained of French bureaucratic interference in
musical life. When he was commissioned in 1837 to write a requiem
for the 1830 revolution, he said he had to camp out in the
government offices to get paid.
   Cairns, who also retranslated Berlioz's own autobiography,
``Memoirs,'' is most pleased with his picture of the composer's
early life, which he unearthed from the family archive of letters
and papers and by spending time in the composer's hometown, La Cote
St. Andre near Grenoble.
   ``It's an extraordinary story. Berlioz didn't have a musical
upbringing so we don't quite know where his genius came from. He
goes to Paris knowing almost nothing about music and in seven or
eight years writes the `Symphonie fantastique.' My book is about
how this happened,'' the author said in an interview.
   ``Berlioz was full of contradictions, that's why people find him
disconcerting.
   ``He was an idealist but also extremely practical: a composer
concerned with every detail, the layout of the orchestra, how to
organize a concert, how to publicize it. People like to pigeonhole:
`the dreamer,' `the man of action.' When a man is both, they don't
quite know how to take him,'' Cairns said.
   ``Life was always a struggle for Berlioz. He couldn't make his
music pay and his love affairs were not very successful. Whenever
he met someone who embodied his ideal woman he went overboard, but
reality brought him back to earth.
   ``He found it difficult to find a woman to feel as passionately
about him as he was about her. Most people don't live on that
intense high plain. It was a disappointment to him but it helped
make him what he was as a composer.''
   Cairns said Berlioz was rare among egoists in his ability to
laugh at himself, and that is reflected in his music, a mixture of
the romantic and classical.
   He was also ``a fastidious Frenchman who couldn't sponge.''
   ``His sense of pride prevented him,'' the author said. ``I think
he would have written much more music, but he would have had to
have had it performed and as the work had to be hand-copied, it
meant large bills which he couldn't afford.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: The Heartbeat of New Orleans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LYNNE BERNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They're called the ``heartbeat of New Orleans.''
   And in music circles, the Neville Brothers are known as
``musician's musicians.''
   For over 30 years, the Neville name has been synonymous with all
the traditions of the Crescent city. Their sound is culled from a
gumbo of styles _ jazz, Caribbean, African, Cajun, rock, funk _
resulting in music as distinctive as New Orleans itself. Charles
Neville, who plays saxophone, calls it New Orleans rhythm and blues.
   The brothers _ Art, Aaron, Charles and Cyril _ worked
individually for more than two decades before they finally merged
their diverse talents in 1977. After several albums and a two-year
interlude, the band has just released their new album, ``Yellow
Moon.''
   The collection, including eight original songs, is perhaps their
most political and personal album, one in which they express their
concern for social issues.
   The album's first single, ``Sister Rosa,'' is a tribute to Rosa
Parks, who became one of the catalysts for the civil rights
movement in 1955 when she refused to give up her seat for a white
person on a segregated bus in Montgomery, Ala. The rap-reggae
number, written and performed by percussionist Cyril, reflects the
album's overall theme: to educate people by increasing their
awareness.
   ``If you don't learn from history, it tends to repeat itself
because it can definitely happen again,'' said Art, the keyboardist.
   ``Look at the neo-Nazis and Skinheads,'' added Cyril, wearing a
``Stop Apartheid'' button. ``We want to give youth a chance to look
at each other on their own terms, rather than how it was in the
last generation who had a certain amount of fear and hatred pumped
into them before they got a chance to look at people and decide for
themselves.
   ``We want to convey to youth that they don't have to be
superhuman or smart to make a change for the better in the world.''
   ``My Blood,'' another song by Cyril, speaks about the roots of
oppression, with particular mention of South Africans, Haitians and
American Indians.
   There's also a remake of Sam Cooke's ``A Change Is Gonna Come,''
and two Bob Dylan covers, ``The Ballad of Hollis Brown'' and ``With
God on Our Side.'' Although Aaron and Cyril trade off as lead
vocalists on most of the album, Art gets the chance to belt out
``Fire and Brimstone'' with the same enthusiasm he seems to have
for life in general. Charles is heard prominently on the
instrumental ``Healing Chant.''
   There is a tenuous and harmonious thread to ``Yellow Moon,''
partly due to producer Daniel Lanois' (Peter Gabriel, U2) recording
style. He used a New Orleans apartment instead of a studio.
   ``His method of recording is to build the studio around the
artist, rather than force the artist to conform to some existing
environment,'' Charles said.
   ``The nickname for the studio became `the swamp,''' Cyril said
with a laugh. ``A whole atmosphere was created which you are able
to hear on the record.''
   Jonathan Demme (``Something Wild,'' ``Married to the Mob'')
directed the video for ``Sister Rosa.'' The filmmaker shares the
musicians' interest in Haiti. After working with artists there and
hearing Cyril sing ``My Blood,'' Demme wanted American artists to
go to Haiti to perform.
   ``But he didn't want it to be like a Sun City,'' said Cyril,
referring to the so-called integrated music venue in South Africa.
``He wanted people with more similar roots and backgrounds.'' The
brothers and Demme are working on a video with the Haitian band La
Fere Parent.
   The brothers' musical roots go back to the '50s. Art was part of
the Hawkettes in 1954 when they recorded the legendary New Orleans
anthem, ``Mardi Gras Mambo.'' In the 1970s, he helped form the
Meters, a funk group with great impact on fellow musicians and such
new bands as The Police.
   Charles was busy touring with Big Mac Bell, Bobby ``Blue'' Bland
and B.B. King. Aaron had a Top 10 hit in 1967 with ``Tell It Like
It Is.'' Cyril was involved in his own band before he joined Art
with the Meters in Europe, who were touring with the Rolling Stones.
   When Charles and Aaron joined the Meters to record ``The Wild
Tchoupitoulas'' album, it was the first time in years the brothers
had all played together.
   ``It happened so easily and beautifully, and we were so proud of
the finished product,'' said Cyril. So they decided to form the
Neville Brothers.
   Although their popularity stems from their hometown of New
Orleans, they initially didn't have a large following as a group.
   ``We used to play Tipitinas. You could blow it up and get no one
but the Neville Brothers,'' Art recalled. ``But we're just enjoying
it as it happens.'' Tipitinas is a popular New Orleans music hall,
and was featured in the film ``The Big Easy'' along with The
Neville Brothers music.
   After the release of their first album, ``The Neville
Brothers,'' the group took off. Their 1981 ``Fiyo on the Bayou''
was a critical and commercial success. Rolling Stones guitarist
Keith Richards called it the best album of that year. But their
1987 ``Uptown'' didn't quite make it. Even devoted fans felt it was
an attempt at mass appeal. ``Yellow Moon'' should dispel any doubts
of the brothers integrity.
   A Cinemax special in May will include such guests as Bonnie
Raitt, Gregg Allman, Buckwheat Zydeco, Jimmy Buffett, John Hiatt
and TV journalist Ed Bradley who will perform ``Sixty Minute Man''
with the Brothers. Bradley is one of many fans who has danced with
wild abandon at a Neville Brothers concert. ``Our music is
definitely dance music. That's the way to respond to it,'' said
Charles. ``The same energy we put out is recycled through the
audience. In a place with no dance floor, there's less energy
coming back from the audience.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: The Resurrection of History's `Invisible Men'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENEVA COLLINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Historical novelist Barbara Chase-Riboud, whose
first book dusted the cobwebs from the obscure tale of Thomas
Jefferson's slave mistress Sally Hemings, has a new work reviving
another of what she calls history's ``invisible men.''
   ``Echo of Lions'' (William Morrow, $19.95) tells the story of
what is believed to be the only successful slave rebellion in
American history.
   Joseph Cinque, a Mende warrior, is brought to Cuba in 1839 to be
sold as a slave in the New World. After he and more than four dozen
other men are purchased and put aboard the Spanish schooner Amistad
to be taken to their owners' homes, he masterminds an uprising,
kills the captain and orders the surviving crew to sail them back
to Africa.
   For two months the ship zig-zigs up the coast of the United
States as the men think they are heading home. When the vessel, its
sails in tatters and those aboard nearly dead from lack of food and
water, finally lands at New York's Long Island, the men are taken
into custody.
   The young nation's court system must decide whether the Africans
are property belonging to the Spaniards who bought them or free men
who had been abducted and illegally taken to Cuba. Abolitionists
push the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, with former President John
Quincy Adams arguing the men's cause before the justices. The high
court, in issuing one of its earliest civil rights opinions,
upholds a lower court's ruling that the men are free.
   In a recent interview, Chase-Riboud (pronounced Ri-BOO), is
asked, ``Why isn't this story taught in every high school American
history class?''
   ``I think that's a common reaction _ how, why, hasn't it become
a part of American history,'' she said. ``And I can just say that
he (Joseph Cinque) is one of those invisible men of history _ he's
not the only one _ that have for one reason or another been
eliminated or forgotten, because of race, because of status or
simply by accident.''
   Chase-Riboud is a Philadelphia-born sculptor, novelist and poet
who has lived in Paris since the early 1960s. She is a striking
woman with exquisite cheekbones and a pleasing voice who frames her
words carefully when she speaks. She will not give her age;
reference works say she was born in either 1936 or 1939.
   Her first work of fiction, ``Sally Hemings,'' created a
sensation in 1979 with its imaginative depiction of the affair that
Thomas Jefferson is believed to have had with one of his slaves for
38 years, fathering her seven children. After its publication,
Jefferson historians insisted anew that there has never been any
substantiation of the affair. The book earned Chase-Riboud the
Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize for Excellence in Fiction by an
American woman.
   Chase-Riboud said one of her most surprising finds in
researching the saga of Joseph Cinque was discovering that the
19th-century Mende society of the Guinea coast had a judicial
system ``amazingly similar to the American one. They had a Supreme
Court, a district court, a circuit court. They had appeal, witness
cross-examination and bail.
   ``That allowed me to present Cinque not as a kind of dumb savage
in a situation he doesn't understand, but as a man, a very
perplexed man, stuck in a situation that he does understand.''
   Chase-Riboud spent three years working on ``Echo of Lions,''
poring over court transcripts recorded in longhand at the archives
of the U.S. Supreme Court, the Library of Congress and elsewhere.
   But why use the novel form after such painstaking historical
research?
   ``To dramatize a historical personage who has not entered into
the mainstream, you have to find his personality, imagine one for
him,'' she said, then recited a favorite quotation by Voltaire:
``There is no history, only fictions of varying degrees of
plausibility.''
   ``You have only to read two books on the same historical person
to know that there's a lot of interpretation, even in history,''
she said.
   Chase-Riboud, who studied fine arts at Temple and Yale
universities, was already a recognized sculptor before she began
writing novels. Her bronze-and-textile pieces are in the permanent
collections of the Museum of Modern Art and Metropolitan Museum of
Art in New York, and the Centre Pompidou in Paris, her writer
friends to take on these little-known tales she found so
fascinating. ``Valide,'' her novel published two years ago, is in
the same spirit; it is about white slavery in the Ottoman empire.

   ``Lite'' olive oil may have no fewer calories,
cereal boasting ``all natural fruit flavors'' may have more salt
and coloring than flavor, and ``sugar-free'' snacks may have
sweeteners as fattening as sugar.
   And how many grams does it take to fill you up anyway?
   What's a health-conscious consumer to do?
   Frank E. Young, who heads the federal agency that regulates the
labels on much of our food, can sympathize. He's a doctor, and even
he has trouble.
   It's hard ``to read labels and figure out what to eat,'' said
Young, commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which
is responsible for labels on foods not regulated by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture. Labels on food, he said, are ``a relic.''
   He'd get no argument from consumer groups.
   Statements on food packages by law must be true, but
manufacturers may not tell consumers all they want to know. That
sugar-free snack, for example, or an oat bran muffin with several
tablespoons of fat, at 100 calories a tablespoon.
   ``Saturated fat is still not listed, cholesterol is still not
listed, and fiber is still not listed... These are the nutrients
the surgeon general has told the American public to watch for when
they go shopping,'' said Bruce Silverglade, director of legal
affairs for the Washington-based consumer advocacy group Center for
Science in the Public Interest.
   Food processors say the problem is that many consumers aren't
sufficiently informed about ingredients to interpret information
already on labels.
   ``You get into good food-bad food, good ingredient-bad
ingredient, when what you want to look at is your overall diet,''
said Allen Matthys, director of regulatory affairs for the National
Food Processors Association. Its 450 processors favor current
regulations making many nutrition labels voluntary.
   ``You can reduce risks by modifying diet,'' Young said. ``That
means you have to give much more information, you have to give
interpretations of the information.''
   The FDA was sidetracked from food label reform by such issues as
AIDS and food additives, he said. But labeling will be a dominant
issue this year, and the agency is considering new regulations on
fiber and cholesterol.
   Young wouldn't speculate what those rules might require.
   Silverglade agreed that prospects for reform appear better.
``What's changed is that several very important reports have been
issued ... advising Americans to modify their diet.''
   Among them was Surgeon General C. Everett Koop's report last
summer that nearly 1.5 million people died in 1987 from diseases
associated with diet.
   Also, consumers ``are becoming increasingly frustrated'' with
labels, Silverglade said. A coalition that includes several medical
and dietary groups, the National Council on the Aging and Consumer
Federation of America is meeting with federal officials to lobby
for changes this year from the FDA or Congress.
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest has proposed
labels with a ``traffic light'' system of colored panels for
calories, fiber, fat and salt. Its proposal would require labels
for fast foods; percentages of major ingredients in a food; and
disclosure of cholesterol, saturated fat and fiber.
   ``Food labels could be one of the greatest measures we could
take to benefit the health of Americans,'' said Silverglade, noting
the costs in lives and dollars from diet-related disease.
   Still, Young said, it likely will be years before consumers see
changes.
   The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service approves labels
for products that contain at least 2 percent poultry or 3 percent
meat. Its standards say, for example, that a product called beef
with gravy must be at least 50 percent beef, while gravy with beef
must be 35 percent beef. It also regulates eggs.
   Of the rest of food, regulated by the FDA, only about 55 percent
have nutrition labels. Regulations the FDA adopted in 1973 require
them only if nutrients are added or if a nutritional benefit claim
is made.
   All food labels must provide the name of the product; the name
and location of the manufacturer, packer or distributor; and the
net contents or net weight. But not all foods must list even the
ingredients; the FDA has a ``standard of identity'' for about 300
foods _ such as mayonnaise and ketchup _ and doesn't require
ingredient lists for products that fit the standard.
   There are two issues the FDA must consider:
   One is nutrition labels, now on the back or side of packages
listing ingredients in descending order by weight, and per-serving
amounts of calories, protein, and certain vitamins and minerals.
   The second is health claim labels, which first appeared in 1984,
usually on the front of a package.
   ``Health claims are claims that talk about the people that eat
the food. Nutrition claims are claims that are made about the
properties of the food,'' said John L. Stanton, professor of food
marketing research at St. Josephs University in Philadelphia.
   ``We really need a strategy that includes both of them,'' Young
said. But there is no consensus whether all packaged foods should
have labels, what information should be included or how it should
be provided.
   In the meantime, the FDA has a proposal _ its second such effort
_ awaiting Office of Management and Budget approval that would
regulate health claims.
   ``The FDA is taking a cautious approach, limiting label
statements to things on which there is a consensus, based on the
surgeon general's report,'' said F. Edward Scarbrough, deputy
director of the FDA's Office of Nutrition and Food Sciences, Center
of Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.
   Five things would be addressed: fats and heart disease, fats and
cancer, fiber and cancer, calcium and osteoporosis, and sodium and
hypertension. The FDA would come up with model label statements
that manufacturers could use, or companies could write their own
within certain guidelines.
   Young would not even guess whether OMB would act on the proposal
this year, and some consumer groups say there's little chance a
rule would be adopted.
   Silverglade said FDA and OMB are ``caught in a bureaucratic
trench warfare over the wording of the rule. OMB is insisting on a
very weak rule that will allow manufacturers to write their own
ticket and slap practically whatever health claims they choose on
their product.''
   FDA inaction has prompted nine states to start negotiating with
food companies directly, said Steve Gardner, assistant attorney
general in Texas. ``We've seen a plethora of pretty outrageous
claims of health benefits. Even with the good products, the basic
venal nature of the companies is such that they can't avoid making
misleading or untruthful claims.''
   In addition, legislation has been submitted to Congress that
would require disclosure of more information about saturated fats
and establish standards for ``lite'' foods. Currently, ``lite'' or
``light,'' except on meats, can mean fewer calories or just a
lighter color or texture.
   Other bills are expected, including one requiring nutrition
labels on all FDA-regulated foods.
   Despite a lack of regulation, health claims already appear on
many foods.
   Kellogg Co. broke the ice in 1984 when it linked consumption of
All-Bran cereal with reduction of cancer risks. The label said in
part: ``The National Cancer Institute reports that high-fiber,
low-fat diets may reduce some kinds of cancer. All-Bran is a
high-fiber cereal.''
   FDA's options were to declare the cereal a drug and force
Kellogg to undergo the lengthy procedures for drug approval, or to
try to come up with a regulation that would allow such labels.
Seizing All-Bran, Young said, would have been ridiculous. The
agency still is seeking a solution.
   Because many consumers are trying to eat better, some officials
fear poorly regulated health claims might do more harm than good.
   A food high in fiber might brag about that without owning up to
also being high in salt. ``So you don't have a heart attack,''
Gardner said. ``You would have a stroke instead.''

<HEAD>Definitions of Some Food Label Terms</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-EXP--Food Labels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are definitions of some terms used on food labels, as
provided by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CHOLESTEROL: Fat-like substances found in meat, poultry and
dairy products. Cholesterol is essential to some body functions,
but the body can make what it needs so the amount in many diets is
excessive, increasing risk of heart disease.
   EMULSIFIERS: Widely used in food processing, these stabilize fat
and water mixtures so they won't separate. In mayonnaise, for
example, egg yolks emulsify the oil and lemon juice or vinegar. In
chocolate and margarine, lecithin, derived from soybeans, is the
emulsifier.
   HUMECTANTS: Chemicals such as glycerol, propylene glycol and
sorbitol that are added to foods to help retain moisture, fresh
taste and texture. Often used in candy and shredded coconut.
   HYDROGENATED and PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED: Labeling terms that
describe the process of adding hydrogen to an unsaturated fat to
make it saturated; oils may be hydrogenated to varying degress to
make them suitable for use in products such as margarine. The more
an oil is hydrogenated, the more saturated fatty acids it contains.
   LIGHT or LITE: Labeling language that suggests a food is lower
in calorie content, unless some other meaning is specified or
obvious. A ``lite'' product intended to be useful in
weight-reduction must have no more than 40 calories a serving and
no more than 0.4 calories a gram to be called ``low-calorie.'' A
``reduced-calorie'' food must be at least one-third lower in
calories than the food to which it is compared. Foods naturally low
in calories cannot use these terms. Foods labeled ``diet'' or
``dietetic'' must meet the requirements for low- or reduced-calorie
foods or be clearly marked as useful for another special dietary
purpose.
   NATURAL: A term that appears on many products but has no
official definition for FDA-regulated foods. Natural meats,
however, are minimally processed and contain no artificial flavors,
colors or preservatives.
   SODIUM: A chemical essential for regulating body fluids and
muscle function, but in excessive amounts linked with increased
risk of high blood pressure. Food labeled ``sodium-free'' must have
less than 5 milligrams per serving; ``very low sodium,'' 35
milligrams or less a serving; ``reduced sodium,'' the usual level
reduced by 75 percent. Table salt, or sodium chloride, is one kind
of sodium.
   SUGAR-FREE or SUGARLESS: Table sugar (sucrose), fructose and
corn syrup are among the calorie-containing sweeteners in food. A
food labeled sugar-free may have calories from natural sugars
(xylitol, sorbitol and mannitol), provided the basis for the claim
is explained.

<HEAD>What the Patient Doesn't Say Can Be Very Important</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH PICHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Physicians need to ``listen'' with their
eyes, according to a doctor who believes patients sometimes say
``yes'' while their bodies are really saying ``no, no, no'' to
treatment.
   The doctor who understands that body language can deal with the
conflict and try to help instead of sending the patients away
unhappy, said Dr. Cecile Carson, chief of behavioral and
psychosocial medicine at Genesee Hospital.
   ``It's not what we say, but how we say it and how a patient
hears it, that makes a difference,'' agreed Dr. Robert E. McAfee of
Portland, Me., a member of the American Medical Association Board
of Trustees. ``It goes to the question of who you want for your
doctor. If you come to me and keep coming back to me, it's probably
because I, quote, tend to hit off with you, unquote.''
   Carson, supported by a grant from the National Fund for Medical
Education, has adapted non-verbal communication theories _ shrugs,
folded arms and glances _ and is teaching medical students and
lecturing around the country.
   Suppose a doctor believes her patient should change medication
to lower his blood pressure. The doctor notes all the potential
benefits, explains why she thinks it would be a good idea and then
asks her patient what he thinks.
   The patient crosses his arms, raises his shoulders slightly and
leans back in the chair. His eyes get noticeably wider and he holds
his breath as he says, ``It sounds like a good idea to me.'' The
mouth said yes, the body said no.
   ``The important thing is to notice that you're getting a mixed
message. Then I ask, `Which message do you think would predict that
patient's behavior.' The answer is the non-verbal one and you have
to know that,'' Carson said.
   ``You may not have time to work it all out at that visit but you
need to note it so you're not frustrated or angry when they come
back and say they haven't taken it,'' she said.
   To better read body language, a doctor must ``calibrate'' the
patient by asking particular questions and watching the physical
response. The doctor also should be aware that sitting behind a
desk to give a prognosis can be perceived as uncaring and distant
and that standing over a patient in a hospital bed and talking can
make a patint feel weak and unsafe, Carson said.
   She also emphasizes ``pacing'' _ adjusting body movements to a
patient's movements in order to make a patient feel more
comfortable. ``So if a patient has her arms crossed, the doctor
might want to cross his arms. If the patient is leaning forward,
the doctor might want to lean forward.''
   Carson believes that non-verbal communication is a skill that
can be acquired with practice, and that even people who recognize
and respond to many non-verbal actions need to be taught. ``Some
people are sort of innately better at this, but they may not be
doing this consciously. People who do this as a matter of style,
even they hit snags.''
   Generally, when the doctor-patient interaction falls apart, she
said, the first the doctors say is that they've got a hostile or an
uncooperative patient on their hands. ``They don't ask if there's
something they can do.''

<HEAD>Hobbyist's Radar Provides Early Warnings In Tornado Season</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT G. WIELAND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CORSICANA, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When towering thunderstorms threaten,
Lloyd Huffman fires up the Doppler radar he built from military
surplus parts.
   Unlike conventional radar, Doppler can detect the speed and
direction of raindrops within a storm, allowing Huffman to spot
rotation that could indicate the formation of a tornado and warn
the weather service and local authorities.
   ``It just kind of grew over the years,'' Huffman said of the
radar he's been tuning up in anticipation of the April-through-June
tornado season.
   With a few differences _ cost being a big one _ Huffman's S-band
Doppler is like the NEXRAD system being tested at the National
Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Okla., and planned for
nationwide installation in the coming decade.
   Huffman asked the laboratory for the plans to build his Doppler.
``After they believed us, they gave us the information we needed,''
he said.
   Huffman built his first radar station in 1976, using World War
II surplus Army and Navy equipment and putting the antenna on the
local hospital. He began working in 1979 on the present station,
which became Doppler-capable in 1985.
   ``I'm very interested in thunderstorm structure,'' he said.
   Huffman, 42, has a degree in physics from North Texas State
University. After working as a communications systems designer for
Motorola in Dallas, he returned to his hometown in 1974 and started
his own communications business.
   Huffman and his crew staff the station whenever severe weather
is possible. He's in microwave link with WFAA-TV in Dallas and
talks by radio with National Weather Service meteorologists in Fort
Worth.
   The radar can detect rain intensity for several hundred miles,
but can only process Doppler information for about 150 miles. The
radar pulses about 1,000 times a second, sending a beam about 1{
degrees wide. The reflected data is sorted into ``range bins'' each
150 meters deep.
   A computer remembers and compares the location of raindrops,
allowing it to determine the speed and direction. ``The speed of
rotation is the rate of change of phase angle _ that's the
velocity,'' Huffman explained.
   The computer assigns a color to each velocity _ red indicates
movement toward the station, green is away _ painting a picture of
the storm. The right combination of colors on the southwest corner
of a thunderstorm provides a ``meso-cyclone vortex signature,''
indicating rotation.
   After several minutes of observation and tilting the radar beam
up and down, Huffman might spot elongation into a cylinder that
could mean a tornado. He then makes sure the National Weather
Service knows and uses police-band radios to notify authorities in
surrounding counties.
   Huffman has the money to upgrade his system by speeding up the
computer and adding memory but said ``it takes a lot of time. It's
a mechanical, electrical, electronic and computer project _ a
little of everything involved in in it.''
   He calls the project ``a good community thing to do.''
   It is funded by the Navarro Community Foundation, money from
wealthy families that profited from two oil booms. Operating
expenses are covered by WFAA-TV in Dallas, which shows the radar
during weathercasts. The station sits on an acre provided by the
Corsicana Independent School District. A donated 80-foot oil
derrick supports a 25-foot-diameter Fiberglas dome containing the
16{ foot dish antenna. At the base of the derrick is a building
housing the radar and the computer equipment that makes it
different from conventional systems.
   NEXRAD _ costing millions as opposed to Huffman's $50,000 since
1976 _ will differ by having built-in computer programs to compare
data with regional models and issue an automatic warning of tornado
likelihood.
   But Huffman enjoys being able to interpret his data by himself.
   ``They'll never completely replace the man in front of the radar
screen,'' agrees Weather Service severe storms specialist Al Moller
in Fort Worth. ``We have to strike a balance in technology,
research and training of people responsible for issuing watches and
warnings.''

   Here are some tornado facts from the National Weather Service,
Insurance Information Institute and news accounts:
   _Tornadoes can occur in any month, but are more frequent from
April through June and between 3 and 6 p.m.
   _Most tornadoes track southwest to northeast, but their paths
can spiral erratically.
   _The portion of a thunderstorm adjacent to large hail is where
tornadoes are most likely to occur.
   _There were 32 tornado-related deaths reported in 1988, down
from 59 in 1987 and well below the average of 99 a year.
   _Less than 2 percent of all tornadoes are classified as violent,
with wind speeds of more than 200 mph and a path averaging 26
miles. The longest tornado on record went 219 miles across
Missouri, Illinois and Indiana in March 1925.
   _Tornadoes travel at an average 30 mph, but can stand still or
go 70 mph.
   _The largest single outbreak of twisters on record was in April
1974, when 148 storms killed 300 people in 13 states over two days.
   _When a tornado threatens, seek shelter in the basement or
central parts of the house, office or school building, away from
windows.

radar pulses about 1,000 times a second, sending a beam about 1{
degrees wide. The reflected data is sorted into ``range bins'' each
150 meters deep.
   The computer assigns a color to each velocity _ red indicates
movement toward the station, green is away _ painting a picture of
the storm. The right combination of colors on the southwest corner
of a storm indicates rotation.
   If Huffman detects the formation of a cylinder that could mean a
tornado, he contacts the National Weather Service and local
authorities.
   NEXRAD _ costing millions as opposed to Huffman's $50,000 since
1976 _ will differ by having built-in programs to compare data with
regional models and issue an automatic warning of tornado
likelihood.

<HEAD>Apples, Grapes, Broccoli Apparently Help Body Use Calcium</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fruits and vegetables high in boron _ like
apples and broccoli _ appear to keep bones stronger by preventing
loss of calcium.
   ``You could drink milk to kingdom come and never get any
boron,'' said Forrest H. Nielsen, director of the Department of
Agriculture's Human Nutrition Research Center in Grand Forks, N.D.
   Nielsen led a study of five men and 10 women who were given a
low-boron diet for nine weeks, then boron supplements for seven
weeks. When the boron was reduced, the subjects excreted more
calcium _ their bodies weren't using it.
   When boron was increase, ``there was less calcium in their
urine,'' and more calcium and an active form of vitamin D in their
blood, he said.
   Nielsen said nobody knows yet exactly what boron does in the
body; the first studies suggesting that it might be important were
done in 1987. ``Before 1987 there was no evidence that it might be
important in human nutrition. We'd known it was essential to plants
since 1910, but we still don't know what its biochemical role is
(in plants).''
   Nielsen said he isn't suggesting boron supplements. Large
amounts can cause changes similar to osteoporosis _ brittleness of
bones resulting from a loss of calcium _ and a well-balanced diet
will include enough, he said.
   Boron is found in broccoli, cabbage and other leafy vegetables;
nuts, legumes and fruits _ especially apples, pears and grapes, he
said. ``But when you talk about a meat and potatoes and milk and
cheese diet, you're talking about a diet low in boron. I think it's
absent in a lot of diets.''
   Harold Sandstead, chairman of preventive medicine and community
health at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston,
said, ``The findings are extremely interesting and might have
importance for human health. They have to be confirmed by another
researcher. But these are very careful workers.''

<HEAD>Earth Berms Cheaper, More Effective At Highway Noise Reduction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Earth berms on either side of a
highway cut noise levels in nearby neighborhoods better than
barrier walls, a researcher says.
   ``These are even more effective if they are covered with grass
or other vegetation because the carpet of plants absorbs the
sound,'' said Sabih Hayek, a professor of engineering science and
mechanics. Without vegetation, the berms simply reflect most of the
sound back onto the roadway.
   Most trees increase noise to neighborhoods near busy
thoroughfares because sound is reflected off leaves, he said. ``Fir
trees will work better because their needles do not reflect sound.
In fact, they absorb sound.''
   Artificial walls of concrete, fiberglass or wood reflect noise
back onto the roadway or over the barrier, said Hayek, whose
research was sponsored by the National Cooperative Highway Research
Program of the Transportation Research Board, representing 50 state
highway departments.
   ``It is possible to cut as much noise as you want using noise
barriers,'' Hayek said, ``however costs increase dramatically with
the increase in desired noise reduction.'' A 15-foot-high wall
costs $200 to $250 a foot to build.
   ``We have tested noise barriers covered with materials that
absorb sound, but the added cost of construction is notical
compared with the slight increase in noise reduction achieved with
absorbent barriers,'' he said.
   Double walls decrease noise levels behind them three-fold over a
single wall, and horizontal overhangs on vertical walls also can
greatly decrease noise levels, but are very expensive to buildhe
said.

<HEAD>Archaeologists Study Evidence Of Cannibalism Among Anasazi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Human bones found in an Anasazi ceremonial
chamberuggest the generally peaceful farmers may have turned to
cannibalism, at least for rituals that likely included prisoners,
an archaeologist says.
   ``My first reaction was, `Oh my God. Soch for our peaceful
farmers,''' said John Cater, a graduate student at
Colorado-Boulder. ``They were so shattered that it was all very
clear what was going on.''
   Archaeologists discovered the bones piled in neat patterns and
some smashed to bits in a ``kiva.'' Near the central firepit lay
stone axes and knives still smeared with microscopic traces of
ancient gore. The wooden ceiling of the kiva was collapsed when the
carnage was compleed, obscuring the evidence for nearly 1,000
years, near what is now the town of Yellow Jacket, Cater said.
   He believes the victims may have been prisoners, and rules out
hunger as a reason for the carnage. ``We've seen too many examples
of when times got rough, people just got up and left. That would be
a bption than eating the next-door '
   Frederick Lange, curator of anthropology at the university
museum, endorses Cater's analysis. But he said evidence at other
sites suggests some desperate Anasazi may have resorted to
cannibalism to ave off starvation.
   The Anasazi started a network of high-rise cliff dwellings in
the Southwest about A.D. 400 and deserted them 900 years later,
presumably after drought or invasion. Barely 10 percent of known
Anasazi ruins in Colorado, Utah, Arizew Mexico have been
excavated. Signs of cannibalism have been found in up to 20 digs,
scattered over thousands of square miles and centuries.

   Anglo-French consortium Eurotunnel said Monday
that it pushed back by one month the completion of its 31-mile
underwater rail link between Britain and France amid escalating
expenses.
   The opening is to take place June 15, 1993 instead of May 15 of
that year, the company said following negotiations with the
construction companies working on the project.
   Eurotunnel also disclosed that its expenses, after investment
income, rose to $926 million in 1988 from $652 million a year
earlier. By the end of 1988, total costs, after investment income,
for the three years of operation were $1.7 billion.

<HEAD>Bergner Offers $282 Million For Carson Pirie</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Department store chain Carson Pirie Scott &amp; Co.
says its board of directors will review a $282 million takeover bid
from competitor P.A. Bergner &amp; Co. but it already has cast doubts
on the likelihood of a merger.
   Carson spokeswoman Kate Leatham declined to comment Sunday on
whether the $20-per-share cash takeover bid was welcome. But in a
statement, Carson characterized the proposal as ``unsolicited,
highly conditional (and) ambiguous.''
   Ms. Leatham said the proposal was received late Friday
afternoon. She said the board will consider the bid but that a
board meeting had not yet been set. According to the Carson
statement, Bergner offered at least $20 per share in cash for
Carson, or, alternatively, offered to acquire only Carson's
department store division for ``an unspecified combination of cash,
stock and notes.''
   Bergner spokesman Jerry Seeman said the company had retained
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Financo as its advisers for the
proposal and had been assured by its commercial bank of funding for
a possible acquisition.
   The offer appears to clash with several recent moves announced
by Carson Chairman Peter Willmott.
   Last month, Willmott said Carson planned to sell its catalog
operation and close its Corporate Level specialty store in
Washington D.C. as part of a restructuring program begun in 1987.
   Carson's department store business consists of 33 stores in the
Chicago area and in Minnesota. The company also owns County Seat, a
jeans and casual-clothing specialty chain with about 400 stores.
   Carson reported revenues of $1.02 billion and a net loss of $38
million _ much of it resulting from the catalog operation _ for
fiscal 1988.
   Bergner operates 31 department stores in Illinois and Wisconsin.
Seeman said the company reported revenues of $470 million last
year, but added that a profit or loss figure was not available
immediately.
   Bergner is owned by the Maus and Nordmann families, Swiss
nationals who operate 70 department stores in Switzerland and the
well-known Au Printemps department store in Paris.

   OPEC will consider boosting its daily 18.5 million
barrels production quota if oil prices remain at the $18-a-barrel
level in the next two months, the cartel's president, Rilwanu
Lukman said in a published report Monday.
   ``If we found oil prices in June stabilized at the level of $18
a barrel or more, we would increase the organization's production
ceiling,'' Lukman told the dialy Al-Watan. ``Otherwise, the
reference price will remain as it is. We cannot predict what is
going to happen in the coming two months.''
   Lukman, who is also Nigeria's oil minister, was interivewed in
Vienna where he last week attended a meeting of OPEC oil ministers.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries instituted a
production ceiling of 18.5 million barrels a day as on Jan. 1 in a
bid to boost sagging oil prices. Since then, oil prices have risen
as high as $20 a barrel.

<HEAD>Consumers' Tax Calls Keep Government Busy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government workers were manning the telephones
Monday, answering questions and listening to complaints on the
sweeping overhaul of the nation's tax system.
   The Fair Trade Commission has received more than 300 inquiries
from Tokyo residents alone on the new 3 percent sales tax
implemented over the weekend, commission spokesman Eiichiro Kokubo
said.
   Most of the callers to the commission's ``cartel emergency
line'' pointed out unwarranted price markups, and expressed fears
of inflation, he said.
   The across-the-board tax on commodities and services, known here
as a consumption tax, was the highlight of the reform led by Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita.
   With adjustments in a variety of taxes under the reform prices
fluctuated. For example, some imported liquor prices fell, while
milk prices rose and soft drinks in vending machines stayed the
same. Television sets were cheaper, but newspapers raised their
prices.
   The government granted a special exemption for small businesses
with annual sales of less than $232,558, freeing them from
collecting the 3 percent tax.
   But many enterprises which are technically exempt, such as
independent taxis and discount stores, raised prices anyway. Some
did so to offset increased operating costs, others simply for
profit.
   The commission's telephone advisory service will continue for
two years and the the commission will be on guard for pernicious
cases, Kokubo said.
   Meanwhile, the Economic Planning Agency has received some 760
phone calls since April 1, spokesperson Mitsuko Asada said.
   About one-third of the callers complained of unreasonably high
price hikes, she said, while many other callers had a questions
about the tax system itself.
   ``We cannot directly impose administrative guidance on the
retailers, but the agency notifies related ministries if we receive
a number of similar complaints, or if the price hike exceeds 3
percent,'' Ms. Asada said.
   Consumer unions throughout the nation also have received about
400 phone calls from consumers in the last two days, she added.
   Concerns over inflation and excessive price hikes discouraged
many shoppers last weekend, and a sale at the Takashimaya
department store in Tokyo brought in 10 percent less sales than
normal for weekends, said Takashimaya spokesman Satoshi Ogawa.
   ``I guess this is a kind of setback from the sales we made in
March, when consumers bought so much to stock up,'' he said.
   He said it will take more than a month to determine how the
consumer tax will affect the store's sales.
   The tax reform and a stock-profiteering scandal involving
Takeshita and many of his party's elite have led to support ratings
as low as 9 percent in recent opinion polls.

   The stock market was little changed today,
starting the second quarter of the year on an indecisive note.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.10 to 2,294.72 in
the first half hour of trading.
   But losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 326 up, 405
down and 450 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.58 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The pace of business activity dropped off significantly in
March, according to the results of a monthly survey of corporate
purchasing executives.
   That was taken as supporting evidence for the widely held belief
on Wall Street that the economy has been slowing since February,
responding to credit-tightening over the past year by the Federal
Reserve in its efforts to restrain inflation.
   Slower growth would presumably benefit the securities markets by
reducing upward pressure on inflation and interest rates.
   But some Wall Street analysts have voiced concern lately that
stock prices might suffer as investors anticipated an accompanying
decline in corporate earnings growth and a possible recession.
   Among actively traded blue chips, General Motors rose [ to 41|;
McDonald's gained [ to 51{, and Exxon slipped \ to 43|. Exxon
shares have been under pressure for more than a week since the
accident involving a company tanker near Valdez, Alaska that
resulted in a huge oil spill.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .04 to 165.59. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .26 at 328.57.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 12.28 to
2,293.62, finishing the week with a net gain of 50.58 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 1,030 up, 413 down and 508 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 170.96 million shares, up from 159.95

   Nissan Motor Manufacturing Coro. USA.
announced today that it will spend $490 million to upgrade its
manufacturing plant here to add another line of cars.
   The expansion will add 2,000 new jobs and boost annual
production to 440,000 cars and light pickup trucks, said Jerry
Benefield, president of Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corp. USA.
   ``The vehicle will be a new four-door model that will compete in
the lower middle market segment,'' Benefield said.
   Nissan now produces 205,816 vehicles annually at the Smyrna
plant, its only plant in the United States, and employs more than
3,000 people.
   Benefield announced in October that Nissan planned to produce a
new line of cars in the early 1990s. The company said at that time
the expansion was intended to offset fluctuations in the dollar-yen
rate, to reduce trade frictions between the two countries and to
meet consumer demand in the United States.
   Nissan is a subsidiary of Nissan Motor Co. Ltd., which is based
in Japan.
   Last year, Nissan announced a $31.1 million expansion to produce
Sentra engines, rear axles for trucks and plastic bumper coverings.
The company said that program would create no new jobs because
increased productivity would allow existing employees to fill the
positions.
   Nissan announced a joint venture with Ford Motor Co. in the past
year to design and build a mini-van, and begin production in 1991.
The Smyrna plant will produce doors, fenders and other major body
parts.

   Sony Corp. denied reports today that the
Japanese electronics company was negotiating to buy MCA Inc., the
entertainment conglomerate that owns Universal Studios.
   ``That's a rumor,'' said Jason Farrell, vice president for
corporate communications at Sony's offices in New Jersey. ``Sony is
not negotiating with MCA.''
   Los Angeles radio station KNX-AM reported on Friday that a deal
for Sony to buy MCA would be announced today.
   But Farrell, asked if an announcement was forthcoming, told a
reporter, ``You know better.''
   MCA President Sidney Sheinberg has refused to comment on the KNX
report, which came on the heels of an announcement that the film
studio United Artists was being sold for $1 billion to
Australian-based Qintex Group.
   MCA, based in Universal City, Calif., is worth an estimated $5.5
billion.
   Securities analysts have said for some time that Sony was
interested in buying a U.S. movie company. The Japanese company
moved into the American entertainment industry last year with the
purchase of CBS records.
   Qintex owns an Australian TV network but is best known in the
United States as one of the makers of the CBS miniseries ``Lonesome
Dove.'' The company would get the United Artists moviemaking group
and its 4,000-film library, including the James Bond, Rocky and
Pink Panther movies, and the Oscar-winning ``Rain Man.''

<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and gas rigs jumped
this week by 13 to total 779, marking the second consecutive weekly
increases after a lengthy downward trend, Baker Hughes Inc.
reported Monday.
   Last week the rig count increased by 26 following a decline of
three in the previous week. A year ago, the total was 941, the
company said.
   ``We like to see three weeks in a row before we declare that
it's up, but we've got two of the three already,'' Baker Hughes
economist Ike Kerridge said.
   ``We haven't had a normal year recently, but if you look back
over a number of years the count usually bottoms out in late March
or early April and then it turns back up,'' Kerridge said. ``We're
hopeful that this will prove to be the upturn.''
   The rig count is a widely watched industry index of drilling
activity and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for
oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing
oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker copmany that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Texas had the biggest increase
with 15 additional rigs, followed by New Mexico, eight;
Pennsylvania, two; and Colorado, Kansas and North Dakota, one each.
   Oklahoma showed the sharpest decline with six fewer rigs,
followed by California, five; Wyoming, three; Ohio, two; and
Louisiana and Michigan, one each.

<TEXT>
   Construction spending was virtually unchanged
in February as an increase in work on government projects was
offset by a decline in building activity on homes and
non-residential facilities such as factories, the government said
today.
   Construction spending took place at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of $423 billion in February, a slight increase from the pace
of $422.8 billion during the previous month, the Commerce
Department reported.
   It was the weakest performance since construction spending
declined 0.2 percent last August. Rising interest rates have
dampened building activity in most sectors, with fixed-rate
mortgages averaging 11.19 percent last week, compared with 9.87
percent a year earlier.
   In February, spending on residential construction declined 0.2
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $203.4 billion. The
pace of building activity on single-family homes was unchanged,
while spending on apartment construction rose 5.8 percent and home
improvements decreased.
   Non-residential construction, meanwhile, declined 0.3 percent to
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $97.8 billion. Spending on
industrial projects such as factories was down 1.9 percent, hotel
and motel spending was down 4.2 percent, and work on offices rose
1.8 percent.
   Spending on government construction, meanwhile, rose 0.7 percent
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $82.7 billion. The largest
category of government construction, highways and streets, was down
3.3 percent.
   Most other government categories posted gains or were unchanged,
with spending on construction of educational facilities rising 4.8
percent.

<HEAD>Chrysler Announces `No More Mr. Nice Guy'' Financing: Free Loans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. plunged into a new automaker
incentive battle today with interest-free loans, undercutting 2.9
percent financing deals offered last week by its two big U.S.
rivals because of slow sales.
   The No. 3 automaker's ``No More Mr. Nice Guy'' program, gives
free financing on two-year loans for 1988- and 1989-model cars and
some trucks. The rates for longer loans range from 5.9 percent to
10.9 percent. No expiration date for the program was set.
   ``It can't get any lower,'' Chrysler Motors Chairman Bennett E.
Bidwell said. ``It can't get any simpler. It can't get any better
for the customer.''
   The zero percent financing program covers all Chrysler's 1988
and 1989 cars, 99 percent of its trucks and about 25 percent of its
hot-selling Jeep models.
   Ford Motor Co. started the latest wave Wednesday with a plan
featuring 2.9 percent interest rates on two-year loans. General
Motors Corp. followed a day later, basically matching Ford's move.
   It's the first time in nearly two years that the Big Three have
brawled so aggressively with cheap financing for cars, reflecting
their fear of a consumer buying slowdown that could create huge
backlogs of unsold 1989 models.
   Ford's vice president for North American sales, Robert Rewey,
acknowledged last Wednesday that part of the motivation for the No.
2 automaker's move into heavier incentives was because early 1989
sales have been below expectations.
   Low-financing or cash rebate incentives, when they're working,
can shrink automakers' inventories, make serious buyers out of
casual lookers and give the industry a shot in the arm during
sagging sales periods.
   When they don't work, they can eat profits and put an unwelcome
burden on dealers.'
   Automakers are betting that incentives will provide the boost
the industry needs to get back on track during the normally busy
early spring period.
   The new incentive programs from Ford and GM also make four-year
financing more attractive by reducing the interest rate from 8.9
percent to 6.9 percent.
   Car and truck sales during the middle 10 days of March were up 5
percent over the same period of 1988, but down 5.3 percent for the
first 20 days of the month and down 5.4 percent since Jan. 1.
   Sales figures for all of March are due Tuesday.
   Some analysts have been revising their earnings projections for
the automakers this year. One reason is slower sales and another is
the costly incentives designed to raise sales in the first place.

Reserve in its efforts to restrain inflation.
   Slower growth would presumably benefit the securities markets by
reducing upward pressure on inflation and interest rates.

stock prices might suffer as investors anticipated an accompanying
decline in corporate earnings growth and a possible recession.

   CBS Records announced Monday that Don Ienner has
been named president of Columbia Records on Monday, becoming at age
36 the youngest executive ever to head the record label.
   The announcement was made by Tommy Mottola, president of the CBS
Records Division, which oversees Columbia Records.

<HEAD>Sumita Promises $4.5 Billion in Loans to Third World</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Satoshi Sumita, governor of the Bank of Japan,
said Monday the Export-Import Bank of Japan would make $4.5 billion
available over the next few years to help Third World countries out
of their debt problems.
   A spokesman for the World Bank said that Japanese authorities
have promised its president, Barber Conable, that these loans would
not be tied to purchases of Japanese goods, as is usually the case
with loans from such government-owned banks.
   Sumita made his announcement at a meeting of the Interim
Committee of the International Monetary Fund.
   Last fall at a meeting in Berlin the Japanese had said they
would be making such loans available but they did not announce a
figure. Sumita's announcement was made in the context of proposals
by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady on the reduction of
the Third World's debt of $1.3 trillion.
   In addition to reductions of their old debts, Third World
countries need new loans for investments that will create new jobs
and production and raise their living standards.
   Sumita made it clear that these loans by Japan would be granted
only in conjunction with the International Monetary Fund and the
changes in policies it requires from debtor countries so that they
will be in better position to repay.
   ``I would like to make it clear that our
initiative...presupposes that the parties concerned agree to the
principal elements of Secretary Brady's proposal...,'' Sumita said
in a prepared statement to the Interim Committee.

<HEAD>High Court Says Federal, Not State Courts Should Decide FSLIC Disputes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court handed down a victory Monday
to thousands of creditors owed billions of dollars by failed
savings and loans.
   Overturning a lower court ruling, the high court decided that
disputes in which the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
takes over failing state-chartered thrifts should be decided by a
federal judge, not in state courts. The Justice Department had
argued that the lower court ruling, if allowed to stand, could have
serious consequences for the FSLIC, which is under financial
strains to insure deposits in failing savings and loan associations.
   In another decision, the high-court justices gave a boost to
state treasuries by ruling that states don't have to provide tax
relief for companies paying federal windfall profit taxes.
   In a suit filed against New Jersey by 13 oil companies,
including giants Exxon Corp. and Texaco Inc., the high court said
an additional state tax does not unduly interfere with interstate
commerce since the companies operated numerous refineries in that
state but do not drill for oil there.
   The windfall tax, imposed by the Carter administration, was
repealed by Congress last year but there may be some companies
still paying on past earnings.
   In the FSLIC dispute, the Supreme Court decided an insurer could
sue in federal court when it seeks to collect money, potentially
hundreds of millions of dollars, allegedly owed to the failing
thrift institutions.
   The FSLIC acts as receiver in helping liquidate scores of
state-chartered savings and loan institutions.
   An appeals court had ruled in a case involving Manning Savings
and Loan Association in Illinois that the federal courts lacked
such authority when the alleged violations of federal law are
secondary to related state law charges.
   Former Manning directors were accused of declaring two illegal
dividends in the early 1980s.
   An Illinois regulatory agency ruled the dividends violate state
law because Manning's net worth was insufficient. However, the
deadline for suing the Manning directors in Illinois state courts
had passed.
   In other court rulings Monday, the justices:
   _Agreed to decide whether defense contractors violate a federal
conflict-of-interest law when paying severance to employees who
quit to take important government jobs. The court said it will hear
appeals by the Boeing Co. and five former employees who received
$485,000 in severance when they left to take jobs in the Reagan
administration.
   _Dismissed a dispute over the confidentiality of lawyers'
documents in a case stemming from a defense contractor's fraudulent
travel reimbursement scheme. The court refused to hear appeals by
Martin Marietta Corp. and a former employee who said the company is
trying to make him the scapegoat for the scheme.
   _Left intact a ruling that permits widespread drug testing of
workers in the nuclear power industry. The court turned away an
appeal by workers applying for jobs with a company that does
maintenance work on a nuclear plant in Washington state.
   _Ordered reconsideration of a ruling that allows District of
Columbia officials to require drug testing for employees involved
in the busing of handicapped students. The justices had decided
last month that drug and alcohol tests should be administered for
railway workers involved in accidents or jobs that require carrying
a firearm.
   _Refused to throw out an indictment accusing New York hotel
owners Harry and Leona Helmsley of federal income tax evasion. The
court let stand a ruling that dismissed the Helmsleys' challenge to
the 47-count indictment.
   _Refused to revive a lawsuit by Penthouse International stemming
from its failure to get financing for an Atlantic City, N.J.,
casino. The court let stand a ruling that threw out a $128.7
million judgment Penthouse won against a Virginia savings and loan
company and a Washington law firm.

<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign investors are moving through this town
as though it were a giant swap meet, with Australia's Qintex Group
offering $1 billion for United Artists and Japan's Sony Corp.
browsing for a similar major film production property.
   Never before has overseas fascination in the entertainment
industry reached such a feverish level, as large and small studios
are now changing hands at the rate of one a month.
   ``The (foreign) interest in the properties is certainly not
going down,'' Jeffrey Logsdon, director of institutional research
for Crowell Weedon &amp; Co., said Monday.
   Sparked by the prospects of a deregulated European television
market, advances in entertainment technology worldwide and a
favorable exchange rate, companies and investors from England to
Italy are clamoring to obtain enough programming to fill the
pending void.
   In addition to Friday's agreement by Qintex, co-producers of the
miniseries ``Lonesome Dove,'' to buy ``Rain Man'' maker United
Artists for $1 billion, British broadcaster Television South PLC
acquired television producer MTM Enterprises for $310 million in
July.
   Australian businessman Alan Saffron bought film producer
Atlantic Entertainment in December for an undisclosed amount and
Italian producers Giancarlo Parretti and Florio Fiorini have been
grabbing up a variety of Hollywood properties in 1989, including
mini-studios Cannon Group and New World Pictures.
   For the past few days, Hollywood has been buzzing with rumors
that Sony Corp. was set to purchase entertainment conglomerate MCA
Inc., a deal that analysts price at around $5 billion. While
officials from both companies insist that no buyout is in the
works, such a merger does make sense for the Japanese entertainment
hardware giant.
   Sony purchased CBS Records (home of Michael Jackson and Bruce
Springsteen) for more than $2 billion in 1988, and has made no
secret that it wants to buy a film studio.
   ``We're looking at Hollywood because of our interest in video,
precisely the same reason we looked at CBS Records because of our
interest in audio,'' Sony Vice Chairman Michael Schuloff said not
long ago.
   Even though the film industry is enjoying record profits
overall, several studios are desperately in need of money.
   Although MCA is not one of them, a Sony purchase would give the
Japanese enterprise not only premium film producer Universal
Studios, but also a valuable film and television library, MCA
Records; ``Murder, She Wrote'' maker Universal Television; MCA Home
Video; MCA's growing theme park franchise; a cable television unit;
a publishing group; a concert and sports merchandising arm, and a
49 percent share in movie theater chain Cineplex Odeon.
   ``(Sony) is probably looking for software to complement their
hardware,'' said Chris Jones, an entertainment analyst with Bateman
Eichler. ``What they could be interested in buying is up to
question. They could even just be interested in obtaining the Asian
distribution rights (to movies, television and music).''
   Logsdon of Crowell Weedon said that by buying a successful film
producer, foreign companies are absolved from the challenge of
matching Hollywood expertise.
   ``There are four parts to a successful movie studio,'' Logsdon
said. ``You have to have creative talent. You've got to have
production capabilities. You've got to have marketing and
distribution clout. And then you've got to have finance. Wherever
you go in the world, people just don't seem to be able to duplicate
the first two parts that are inherent within U.S. studios.
   ``So, rather than trying to go out and trying to reinvent the
wheel yourself _ and as long as American culture is going to be
held out as some kind of world standard _ I think there's going to
be an attractiveness to those assets,'' Logsdon said.
   MCA has quite a few assets.
   In 1982, Universal released the highest-grossing movie ever,
``E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial,'' and the film went on to set records
at the nation's video stores in 1988. The company has also reaped
large profits from 1973's ``The Sting,'' 1975's ``Jaws,'' 1985's
``Back to the Future'' and last year's ``Twins.''
   MCA Records carries the popular teen vocalist Tiffany, as well
as the sultry star Sheena Easton and young soul singer Bobby Brown.
In June 1988, a joint venture which is 20 percent owned by MCA
acquired the record company assets of Motown Record Corp.
   Universal Television has produced the shows ``Murder, She
Wrote,'' ``Miami Vice,'' ``The A-Team'' and ``The New Leave it to
Beaver.''
   Universal Studios Hollywood was the nation's fourth most popular
theme park last year, drawing 4.2 million visitors. The $500
million Universal Studios Florida is set to open in May 1990 with a
combination of behind-the-scenes tours of moviemaking and thrill
rides based on movies.
   The foreign equation can work both ways. A few leading
programmers _ Disney and NBC among them _ have begun spreading
their franchises overseas. So far, though, the advances have been
tentative.
   Nonetheless, said entertainment lawyer and film producer Charles
Meeker, ``I think you're going to see the successful U.S. studios
make major moves into foreign markets.''

   The price of MCA Inc. common stock climbed
Monday despite Sony Corp.'s denial of a report that it was
negotiating to acquire the entertainment giant.
   ``Sony is not negotiating with MCA.'' said Jason Farrow, vice
president for corporate communications at Sony's offices in New
Jersey.
   MCA President Sidney Sheinberg has called the report a rumor.
   Nonetheless, MCA gained $3.87{ a share to $56.62{ in trading
Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Analysts said Sony and MCA were likely candidates for talks.
   ``I think there's a relatively low probability (of a merger). I
think that they have probably spoken to each other, like Sony has
spoken to many, many people on the street,'' said Harold Vogel,
entertainment industry analyst for Merrill Lynch Pierce, Fenner &amp;
Smith Inc. ``My best guess is that there will be nothing
happening.''
   Chris Jones of the investment firm Bateman Eichler, Hill
Richards in Los Angeles said MCA and Sony were likely candidates
for talks, but warned that Sony could have many interests in the
MCA conglomerate, which includes movies, music, entertainment
parks, books and licensing.
   But the Sony style, Jones noted, has been to move carefully.
   ``I can tell you that their strategy has been one of building
relationships with companies,'' she said. ``They had a 20-year
relationship with CBS before they acquired their music catalogue.''
   ``They are very methodical _ slow. They are constantly
reevaluating and have historically worked from long-term
relationships in making acquisitions,'' she said.
   Her firm estimates MCA is worth just over $5 billion and well
positioned as a major force in the entertainment industry.
   Meanwhile, Los Angeles' KNX-AM Newsradio stood by its story of
Friday that said a deal was in the works between the two corporate
giants.
   One aspect of any merger would be the likely need for the
combination to dispense with MCA's huge music catalog to avoid
antitrust problems. Sony already owns CBS Records, with such
artists as Bruce Springsteen and Michael Jackson, and its huge
library of recordings.
   The MCA catalog includes some of the best-known artists in 20th
century American music, including Duke Ellington, Count Basie,
Woody Herman, the Ink Spots, the Mills Brothers, Judy Garland,
Patsy Cline, B.B. King and Buddy Holly. There is also the entire
Chess records rhythm and blues catalog, including Chuck Berry, Bo
Diddley, Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf.
   Modern artists include Elton John, Tiffany, The Boys, New
Edition, and country stars Reba McEntire, George Strait, Lyle
Lovett, Lacy J. Dalton and the Bellamy Brothers.

   International Thomson Organization said Monday it
would add to its media empire by acquiring the publisher of a group
of Canadian medical journals.
   International Thomson said Monday it will pay 8.5 million
Canadian dollars for the publishing arm of Trimel Corp., a Toronto
firm that provides services to the pharmaceutical industry. Trimel
shareholders still have to approve the deal at a meeting April 28.
   Thomson, which has proposed to merge with Thomson Newspapers
Ltd. to form a multi-billion-dollar media giant under the name
Thomson Corp., controls more than 100 magazines and 70 newspapers.
   In announcing the merger plan last month, Ken Thomson, chairman
of both organizations, said the new company would focus on
acquiring new publishing companies.
   Alan Lewis, treasurer for International Thomson, said the Trimel
deal was in the works before the announcement.
   Trimel produces such publications as Drug Protocol, Pharmacy
Practice and Today's Health.
   The company also operates an electronic information network for
doctors that is not part of the deal.
   Company president Eugene Melnyk said Trimel is selling its
publications to concentrate on electronic services and on its
pharmaceutical business, Galen Pharma.

   Consumer confidence dropped in March as
Americans grew more concerned about rising interest rates, the
Conference Board said Monday.
   The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index fell to
117.7, down from 120.7 in February. The index has a base of 100.
   Despite the drop, the index remained at a relatively high level,
noted Fabian Linden, an economist with the business-supported
research group.
   ``There is, however, increasing concern about interest rates,''
Linden said.
   ``Some 80 percent of consumers expect interest rates to rise
during the next year,'' he said.
   Rising rates were of the greatest concern to homeowners and
potential home buyers faced with changes in both conventional and
adjustable home mortgage rates.
   The Conference Board said the number of Americans who plan to
purchase a home was sharply lower in March than at the same time
last year.

<HEAD>Grain and Livestock Futures Tumble</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Most grain and livestock futures prices closed mostly lower
Monday in response to supply figures released last week by the
Agriculture Department.
   On other markets, precious metals prices were mostly higher and
most energy futures declined.
   Analysts attributed the grain and soybean declines on the
Chicago Board of Trade to the government report of
higher-than-expected supplies of wheat, corn and soybeans.
   Also weighing on prices were weekend rains in growing areas,
said grains analyst Dale Gustafson of Drexel, Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Prices regained some ground after soybean contracts fell under
the psychologically-important $7-a-bushel level, a said analyst
Steve Freed of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Wheat settled 4} cents to 7{ cents higher, with the contract for
delivery in May at $4.08{ a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 9{ cents
lower, with May at $2.59 a bushel; oats were 1 cent higher to 10
cents lower, with May at $1.87 a bushel; and soybeans were 10 cents
to 28\ cents lower, with May at $7.10 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat prices generally fell on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Only one contract, for April live hogs,
managed to finish higher.
   Friday's report on the supply of hogs and pigs indicated no
shortage of hogs at any time soon, said livestock analyst Chuck
Levitt of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Cattle also suffered from the government's pork report, Levitt
said.
   He explained: ``It showed competition from pork would be heavy.''
   Record high prices at retail counters also has reduced consumer
demand, Levitt said.
   Cattle settled .67 cents to 1.47 cent lower, with the contract
for delivery in April at 77.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were
1.30 cents to 1.50 cents lower, with April at 79.80 cents a pound;
live hogs were .12 cent higher to 1.38 cents lower, with April at
40.37 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .75 cent to 2
cents lower, with May at 35.35 cents a pound.
   Prices for gold and silver futures were mostly higher on the
Commodity Exchange in New York.
   ``The market showed little movement,'' said William O'Neill,
director of research for Elders Futures Inc., adding that prices
were supported in late trading by the U.S. dollar being under
pressure.
   Gold settled 10 cents lower to $1.10 higher, with the contract
for delivery in April at $386.20 a troy ounce; and silver was .6
cent lower to 1 cent higher, with April at $5.788 a troy ounce.
   Most energy futures prices fell slightly on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   Traders said they were nervous over the news that the U.S. Coast
Guard has reopened the Alaskan port of Valdez to 24-hour tanker
traffic. It was closed due to the disastrous oil spill by an Exxon
Corp. tanker on March 24.
   Crude oil settled 24 cents to 32 cents lower, with the contract
for May at $19.95 a barrel; heating oil was .62 cent to 1.12 cents
lower, with May at 52.50 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline
ranged .39 cent lower to .88 cent higher with May at 67.85 cents a
gallon.

   Bond prices strengthened Monday, although they
were knocked off their highs of the day by central bank action to
knock down the value of the dollar.
   The Treasury's key 30-year bond rose $3.13 per $1,000 in face
amount and its yield, which moves inversely, fell to 9.06 percent
from 9.09 percent late Friday.
   The central banks' dollar sales were more effective than usual
because the Bank of Japan joined in the dollar-lowering efforts
after a long absence from intervention.
   Finance ministers of seven major industrialized democracies said
Sunday after a meeting they would combat the dollar's appreciation
by selling the currency in coordinated intervention.
   Bonds held their gains for awhile after the dollar began its
descent but eventually weakened, said Marilyn Cohen, an analyst at
Capital Insight Inc. in Beverly Hills, Calif.
   An outlook for a declining dollar makes investors reluctant to
invest in dollar-denominated securities as well as raising the risk
of inflation spurred by more costly imported goods.
   The bond market was helped by a report the Nationalf Purchasing Management
released over the weekend that suggested
economic growth slowed significantly in March.
   The reporther eased fears of inflation and higher interest
rates, which hurt the value of fixed-income investments such as.
   Another report released Monday by the Cotment showed
construction spending remained unchanged in Februay, viewed as
another signal the economy is slowing.
   In thedary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short,-term governments
rose about \ to about ] point, the
financial information service Telerate Inc. reported. The movement
of a pnt is equals a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a

   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, ros 1,124.77.
   In corporate trading, industrials also strengthened. Moody's
Investment Grade Corporate Bond Inures price
movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of fears or
longer, rose 0.92 to 299.07.
   In th the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rosint to 90\. The average yield to
maturity dropped to 7.78 percent from 7.79 percent late Friday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 9.12 percent as the

bills fell to 9.38 percent as the di basis points to
8.86 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 9.45 percent as the
discount fell 10 basis poi to 8.74 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percent. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Trasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 9~ percent, down from 10 percent late Friday.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Increases Share In Venture With Philips</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said Monday
it increased its share in a joint European telecommunications
venture with NV Philips to 85 percent from 50 percent.
   Neither company would comment on how much AT&amp;T paid to raise its
percentage ownership of the venture, AT&amp;T Network Systems
International BV of Hilversum, the Netherlands.
   AT&amp;T said the action was in keeping with both companies'
long-standing desire to bring in other companies as partners in the
venture. AT&amp;T does not want to retain its entire 85 percent stake
indefinitely.
   The venture, formerly named AT&amp;T and Philips Telecommunications,
was formed in 1984 mainly to sell switches and other equipment to
Europe's government-owned phone companies. It had revenue last year
of more than $600 million and about 5,000 employees.
   Marj McKean, an AT&amp;T spokeswoman, said AT&amp;T was not necessarily
disappointed at the delay in getting other European partners, which
could help the company expand its market share.
   She said the venture was profitable last year, but could not say
how large its profits were.

<HEAD>Nissan Plans $490 Million Expansion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corp. USA said
Monday it will spend $490 million on a plant expansion that will
make it the largest single auto manufacturing plant in the nation
and create 2,000 jobs.
   The company, which is a subsidiary of Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. in
Tokyo, plans to expand the 3.4-million-square-foot plant by 1.2
million square feet to make a new car line, said Jerry Benefield,
president and chief operating officer of the company. The expansion
will boost Nissan's investment in Tennessee to $1.2 billion.
   ``Today we are announcing an even greater presence in our
community and in this great state,'' Benefield told a news
conference at the plant located about 25 miles from Nashville.
   The company produces 240,000 Sentras and light trucks a year.
The production of the new car will boost the total output to
440,000 vehicles by 1992.
   ``That will make us the largest automobile manufacturer in the
United States (in number of vehicles and size of the plant),''
Benefield said.
   Bert Serre, North American Regional public affairs manager for
Ford Motor Co., said Ford does not have a single facility or
complex that would produce that many vehicles.
   ``We don't have a plant that would approach that. We're
geographically distributed all across North America. We don't
believe in putting all our eggs in one basket,'' he said.
   A call was placed to General Motors Corp. but it was not
immediately returned.
   Details of the new car were kept secret except to say that it
would be a four-door, family-sized car that would be pitched to the
same market as the Nissan Stanza. The cost of a 1989 Stanza at a
nearby Nashville dealership ranged from $11,500 to $17,000.
   ``For competitive reasons I won't tell you any more about it,''
Benefield said. `` We won't discuss the power train, the options or
any part of the design.''
   The design for the car's styling is expected to be completed
within a few weeks, Benefield said. But design of the engine and
other options won't be complete for up to 18 months.
   ``It is a completely new car being designed with completely new
styles and developed from scratch,'' Benefield said.
   The new car is scheduled to roll off the line in the summer of
1992, in time for the 1993 model-year introduction.
   The company, which employs 3,200, will hire 1,750 production
technicians and about 250 administrators beginning next year.
   The company said it will spend $90 million on a training program
and has asked the state to chip in $9 million for the program.
   ``We have training money available in Tennessee and naturally we
will go to the Legislature and discuss it with them,'' said Gov.
Ned McWherter, who attended the news conference.
   The Nissan jobs, which are highly sought, pay $11.50 to $13.50
per hour in addition to a base salary bonus of $1.45 per hour and
other incentives. Benefield said worker satisfaction is high and it
is unlikely that the United Auto Workers union, which has tried to
organize the plant before, would take root.
   ``Our employees continue to tell us they are doing alright
without the UAW. I expect it to stay that way,'' he said.
   The company preferred to hire workers without previous
car-making experience, he said. Therefore, Nissan would be unlikely
to entice workers away from the UAW-organized GM Saturn plant,
which is expected to be operating by 1991 in nearby Spring Hill,
the president said.

<HEAD>Arco Says Delivery Schedules Imperiled by Alaska Spill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crude oil customers of the Atlantic Richfield
Co. were warned Monday that delivery schedules for Alaskan crude
might be delayed because the massive oil spill off Valdez has
slowed tanker shipments.
   ``What we are telling our customers now is we can't meet every
requirement in their contract,'' Arco spokesman Albert Greenstein
said. Vessel delays at the Port of Valdez were blamed.
   Customers were told Friday that deliveries may be pro-rated in
the near future, ``but we are not at that point yet,'' said
Greenstein. Arco sells 50,000 to 70,000 barrels a day of Alaskan
crude oil.
   Arco's share of North Slope oil is about 520,000 barrels daily,
most of that processed in its own refineries.
   Earlier last week, British Petroleum's BP America Inc. and the
Exxon Corp. said they had temporarily halted April Alaskan crude
oil contracts.
   On Monday, Exxon apologized for causing the nation's biggest oil
spill and promised to clean up every fouled beach in Prince William
Sound, but workers on those greasy-smelling beaches said their
efforts were futile.
   The tanker Exxon Valdez crashed into Bligh Reef on March 24,
spilling 10.1 million gallons of North Slope crude. The oil slick
has now grown larger than Rhode Island, the nation's smallest state
at 1,214 square miles.

<HEAD>Trump, Guccione Sued By Pratt Hotel Corp.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE A. VENEZIA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pratt Hotel Corp. filed a civil
racketeering suit Monday against developer Donald Trump and
Penthouse magazine publisher Robert C. Guccione in a continuing
dispute over an unfinished casino project.
   Trump, Guccione and their corporate entities also were accused
of civil conspiracy, antitrust and fraud in the Superior Court
lawsuit filed by Pratt, which alleged Trump wanted the Penthouse
property to avoid increased competition for his rival Trump Plaza
Hotel and Casino.
   Pratt had a contract to purchase the incomplete Penthouse
project and convert it into the Sands Hollywood casino, but on
March 19 Trump made a surprise announcement that he purchased the
Penthouse site for $56 million and planned to convert it into a
non-casino hotel.
   Trump ``consistently and vehemently opposed the development of
the Sands Hollywood Casino Hotel project _ a competitor immediately
next door to Trump's major profitable asset in Atlantic City,''
Pratt said in a prepared statement.
   Pratt seeks to void Trump's contract with Guccione and force
Penthouse International Inc. to honor the Pratt contract. It also
asks for compensatory and punitive damages and asks that Trump's
casino license be revoked.
   Attorneys for the Pratt, Trump and Penthouse are scheduled to
appear at a conference before Superior Court Judge L. Anthony
Gibson on April 11.
   Pratt Hotel officials said Trump deliberately delayed the Sands
Hollywood project with legal challenges and attempts to purchase
parcels of land needed for the casino's parking facility.
   Pratt President William P. Weidner said Monday that Penthouse
violated the terms of its contract with Pratt by signing the deal
with Trump.
   ``Trump did everything he could _ both legally and illegally _
to ensure he did not have a competitor next door,'' said Roberto
Rivera-Soto, attorney for Pratt. ``And Guccione, through his
corporate entities, did everything he could to either have us
finance him or increase the value of his property at our expense.
   Trump on Monday referred calls to his Atlantic City attorney,
Patrick T. McGahn Jr., who said the Penthouse property was an open
target after Pratt's extended option to buy expired Feb. 1.
   ``It appears that the Sands and Pratt organizations may be
merely trying to cover up their own negligence and that of their
corporate officers and directors in failing to exercise the
option,'' McGahn said said.
   Penthouse International spokeswoman Leslie Jay said Monday the
company would have no comment until officials reviewed the lawsuit.
   In 1978, Penthouse bought the 392-room Holiday Inn on the
Boardwalk and the Four Seasons Motel on Pacific Avenue and
announced plans to link the two to create a casino hotel.
   A steel superstructure was put in place to link the two
buildings together, but construction stopped when Guccione ran out
of money.
   Trump has said he intends to demolish the rusting framework, but
refurbish the Holiday Inn facility into a non-casino hotel
connected to Trump Plaza. The back section of the Boardwalk
property at first would become parking space but a luxury hotel
would eventually be built on the site.

<HEAD>IBM Heads Forbes List Of Most Valuable Companies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. was the
most valuable company in the United States in 1988 for a fifth
straight year, Forbes Magazine plans to report in its May 1 issue.
   The world's largest computer company was worth $71.8 billion at
the end of 1988, going by the price of a share times the number of
shares outstanding, Forbes said Monday.
   IBM grabbed the top spot in 1984 after American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. fell off because of the breakup of the Bell System.
   The top five companies kept their positions last year. The
companies making the biggest jumps among the top 10 were Ford Motor
Co., which rose to sixth from ninth, and Du Pont Co., which fell to
ninth from sixth.
   The top 10 companies in market value were:
   1. International Business Machines Corp., $71.8 billion, up 4.2
percent from 1987.
   2. Exxon Corp., $56.7 billion, up 7.9 percent.
   3. General Electric Co., $40.4 billion, up 1.3 percent.
   4. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., $30.87 billion, up 6.5
percent.
   5. General Motors Corp., $30.85 billion, 25.3 percent.
   6. Ford Motor Co., $24.1 billion, up 29.7 percent.
   7. Philip Morris Cos. Inc., $23.5 billion, up 16.5 percent.
   8. Merck &amp; Co. Inc., $22.9 billion, up 10.1 percent.

<HEAD>Daytime-Only Restriction Reimposed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard on Monday reinstated
daytime-only restrictions on oil tanker traffic in Prince William
Sound after state officials raised concerns, spokesman Rick Meidt
said.
   Night traffic was allowed Sunday for the first time since the
Exxon Valdez disaster. But after a Monday meeting, the Coast Guard
decided again to limit traffic until all agencies are satisfied
that Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the operator of the Valdez
terminal, has the equipment to handle another spill, Meidt said.
   ``If something were to happen, let's make sure we have enough
gear there to respond,'' he said.
   The Coast Guard cut traffic in half through Prince William Sound
after the Valdez ran aground March 24, spilling more than 10
million gallons of crude oil into the water.
   Valdez is the only port from which North Slope oil is shipped.
The partial closure reduced North Slope crude deliveries of 2
million barrels a day to fewer than 1 million, causing West Coast
refinery shortages and higher oil prices.
   The Coast Guard said Sunday that restrictions would remain in
effect until the Valdez was emptied of its remaining oil, probably
Tuesday. But the agency decided later Sunday to lift the daylight
restriction.
   Other restrictions, such as allowing only one tanker at a time
through the area and requiring an escort of two tug boats, remain
in effect.
   Meidt said Valdez averages three tankers a day, and with
additional tug boats, ``we're not too far away from that.''

<HEAD>Harold Simmons Made His Billion Through Corporate Raids</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Lockheed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Billionaire Harold C. Simmons, who may have
Lockheed Corp. in his takeover sights, doesn't mind being called a
corporate raider. After all, buying other companies has propelled
the son of two Texas public school teachers to billionaire status.
   ``I think that's OK, because that's what I am,'' Simmons told an
interviewer last year. ``I think that term raider is very
misleading because it implies that somebody is taking something by
force without paying for it. Basically, corporate raiders are
willing to pay a price for a stock higher that anyone else is
willing to pay, or else they don't buy it.''
   Simmons, 57, last week upped his stake in Lockheed to 5.3
percent, but said in a letter to Daniel M. Tellep, chairman of the
defense contractor: ``We have no plans, or desire, to disrupt
management. We expect to be a constructive, long-term shareholder.''
   However, Simmons has made no secret of his plans to get back
into the acquisition game after he has ``digested'' his $1 billion
purchase last year of NL Industries Inc.
   ``I'll be looking for an acquisition in the range of $2 billion
and upwards,'' Simmons told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram last year.
``My philosophy has always been that a big deal is as easy to do as
a small deal, so you might as well do the biggest one you can do''
_ a philosophy he has repeated several times to various
interviewers.
   Simmons, a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of Texas
with bachelor's and master's degrees in economics, worked for three
years as an investigator for the U.S. Civil Service, and then a
year as an examiner at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   Then, in 1956, he moved to Republic National Bank, where he
worked for four years before quitting, according to his official
biography, because ``my bosses and I disagreed on who was the
smarter.''
   Simmons, then 29, put down $5,000 of his own money and borrowed
$95,000 to buy a drug store across from the Southern Methodist
University campus.
   ``He has never worked for anyone else since,'' says his
biography.
   ``He made hamburgers, washed dishes, stocked shelves, kept books
and polished the floors,'' the bio says.
   He also read financial statements; ``I only know how to do one
thing well, and that's read a financial statement,'' he said in an
interview in the current issue of Fortune magazine.
   In 1966 he began acquiring drug store chains, eventually owning
100 stores before selling them in 1973 to Jack Eckerd Corp. for $50
million.
   Fortune estimates his current holdings in chemical, timber and
sugar to be worth about $1.5 billion. He told the magazine, ``I
expect to be worth $5 billion to $10 billion before I die.''
   Besides NL Industries, which he split into a chemical division
with $1 billion in 1988 sales and a petroleum services division
with $492 in sales, through his totally owned Contran Corp. he
controls all or most of The Amalgamated Sugar Co., with 1988 sales
of $401 million; Medford Corp., $127 million in forest products;
Medite Corp., $86 million in fiberboard; Sybra Inc., a large
franchiser of Arby's fast food restaurants with $81 million in
sales; and the Hardware Division, which sold $59 million in locks
and medical products.
   Separately, through Contran, he owns 52 percent of Keystone
Consolidated Ind., a steel and wire products company.
   In addition, Simmons has made $328.9 million over the past
decade through the buying and selling of large chunks of companies
_ from PSA Inc. to Sea-Land Corp to GAF Corp.
   He has given some of it away, the largest chunk a $41 million
gift last year to the University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center at Dallas for cancer and arthritis research.
   Along the way, he also has had brushes with the law. In the
1970s, he was acquitted of mail and securities fraud charges and
settled a civil suit for $500,000.
   In 1983, he was found to have violated pension fund management
rules, even though he had increased the value of the pension fund.
   Although once described as working 80-hour weeks, Simmons now
spends only about six hours daily at his office on the 17th floor
of a north Dallas office building. ``Can't let my job get in the
way of my tennis game,'' he says.
   ``I'm not a long-hours worker,'' he told a reporter last year.
``Two hours of good thinking time a day beats 20 hours of hard
work. From my viewpoint, you've got to come up with the ideas.''
   Simmons was born in Alba, Texas, east of Dallas, and grew up in
nearby Golden, where his father was superintendent of schools and
his mother a teacher in the town of about 200.
   His official biography says Simmons was 16 before his parents
and two brothers lived in a house with indoor plumbing.
   Now Simmons has two homes in Dallas, a duplex in Aspen and a
24-acre villa in Santa Barbara, about 80 miles from Lockheed's
Calabasas, Calif., headquarters _ so near, Simmons told Lockheed's
Tellep he would come by for a visit someday soon.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Citizens and Southern Corp., parent
corporation of Georgia's C&amp;S Bank, announced Monday that its board
has decided to fight an uninvited takeover attempt by the giant
NCNB Corp. which would create the nation's sixth-largest banking
concern.
   The Atlanta-based bank holding company, in a statement, termed
the NCNB stock swap offer ``inadequate,'' and said C&amp;S' present
management is better able to serve the bank's customers,
shareholders and communities than NCNB.
   ``We have managed this bank for service, growth, profitability
and long-term service to shareholders _ not for a quick sale,'' C&amp;S
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bennett A. Brown said. ``The
board of directors and the management have concluded that this
offer is clearly inadequate and not in the best interests of C&amp;S
shareholders, customers and employees.''
   NCNB, the Southeast's largest banking company, surprised C&amp;S
late last Thursday with a $2.4 billion stock offer for the
Atlanta-based bank. C&amp;S management was cool to the idea from the
start.
   ``It was unsolicited,'' said C&amp;S Chief Financial Officer James
D. Dixon. ``It was uninvited.''
   In a statement Monday night, NCNB Corp. called its offer ``fair
and generous'' and said its legal advisers felt there is no
regulatory block to such an acquisition.
   ``We are determined to proceed, and request the C&amp;S Board to
reconsider our offer and promptly authorize negotiations,'' the
release said.
   In its official offer, NCNB had told C&amp;S it wanted to begin
``active merger discussions'' within five business days. That now
is unlikely to happen.
   C&amp;S' board, in addition to voting unanimously to reject the NCNB
offer, also decided in its meeting Monday to adopt a new article in
the corporation's bylaws, under Georgia's Business Combination Act,
preventing any major shareholders from combining with the
corporation for five years, unless certain conditions are met.
   The bid for C&amp;S followed a highly publicized push by the
Charlotte, N.C.-based NCNB into Texas last year, buying into the
Republic Bank Corp. of Dallas. A combined NCNB and C&amp;S would create
a formidable bank with $76 billion in assets. NCNB officials
characterized their buyout offer as a friendly one, and vowed to
leave C&amp;S' managers _ and its name _ in place in Georgia.
   Under NCNB's plan, each C&amp;S shareholder would bet 1.075 shares
of NCNB common stock for each of their C&amp;S shares.

<HEAD>States To Get At Least $135 Million From Supreme Court Oil Company
Tax Ruling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM MARTELLO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven states will gain at least $135
million as a result of a Supreme Court ruling Monday that upholds a
tax on oil company profits, officials said.
   The high court, by an 8-0 vote, upheld a New Jersey tax that 13
major oil companies said unfairly had cost them tens of millions of
dollars.
   The court said New Jersey officials lawfully refused to allow
state tax deductions for what the oil companies paid in federal
windfall profit taxes.
   The ruling also applied to six other states that refused to
allow such deductions.
   Lawyers for the oil industry, mining interests and natural gas
producers had contended that a New Jersey victory in the nation's
highest court could encourage other states to adopt similar tax
systems.
   Writing for the court, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said the state
tax does not unduly interfere with interstate commerce.
   The ruling was lauded by state officials and criticized by oil
company representatives.
   The outcome of the case was of particular interest in New
Jersey, which included an anticipated $98 million windfall from the
oil companies as revenues in its tight state budget for next year.
   Georgia stands to gain at least $25 million from oil companies
as a result of the ruling, said Marcus Collins, commissioner of the
state department of revenue.
   South Carolina officials said the ruling means the state won't
have to pay out an estimated $10 million in refunds to the oil
companies.
   In Minnesota, the state will get at least $2.2 million from oil
companies, officials said.
   Officials from the other states affected by the ruling _ New
York, Iowa, and Wisconsin _ said they did not know Monday how much
money will be coming in because of the ruling.
   The federal windfall profits tax was imposed on oil retrieval
after President Carter announced he would gradually remove controls
on domestic crude oil prices beginning in mid-1979.
   The windfall profits tax allowed the federal government to
recover billions of dollars in increased profits the oil companies
realized by the jump in oil prices resulting from decontrol.
   The windfall tax, which yielded more than $78 billion in federal
revenue, was repealed by Congress last year but there may be some
companies still paying on past earnings.
   New Jersey's corporate business tax imposes a levy on a portion
of the ``entire net income'' of a corporation that does business in
the state.
   Under the state tax formula, a corporation's net income is the
same as its federal taxable income ``before net operating loss
deduction and special deductions.''
   The state tax law also includes an ``add-back'' provision that
says ``entire net income shall be determined without the exclusion,
deduction or credit of ... taxes paid or accrued to the United
States on or measured by profit or income.''
   The oil companies sought to avoid ``adding back'' the amount of
their federal windfall profit taxes _ in effect claiming a
deduction for that tax from its ``entire net income.'' New Jersey
authorities disallowed such a deduction.
   ``We conclude that the add-back provision does not discriminate
against interstate commerce,'' Blackmun said.
   ``We're disappointed with the ruling,'' said James Benton,
executive director of the New Jersey Petroleum Council. ``We
believed that a state such as New Jersey, which has no oil
production, could not impose such a corporate business tax.''
   Benton said oil companies will promptly pay the balance owed New
Jersey.
   The companies that challenged the tax are Amerada Hess Corp.,
Atlantic Richfield Co., Conoco Inc., Citgo Petroleum Corp., Exxon
Corp., Phillips Petroleum Co., Chevron Corp., Mobil Corp., Unocal
Corp., Gulf (a division of Chevron), Shell Oil Co., Tenneco Inc.
and Texaco Inc.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor did not participate in the case for
unannounced reasons.

<HEAD>Price Quits New York Post To Join TV-Radio Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York Post Publisher Peter Price said Monday
he has quit the morning tabloid to become a partner in an
international television and radio company.
   The move came one year after the Post was saved from a
threatened closing, when real estate developer Peter Kalikow bought
it from Rupert Murdoch and named Price publisher. Four weeks ago
the paper began a Sunday edition.
   Kalikow said in a statement that he accepted the resignation
``with regret'' and said he would immediately assume the duties of
publisher, but a spokesman would not say whether that move was
permanent.
   Kalikow said Price ``did a fantastic job and played a key role
in taking a nearly defunct afternoon newspaper with a circulation
that had dropped as low as 2 million a week and bringing it back to
a strong newspaper with a Sunday edition and a weekly circulation
of over 4 million.''
   Price, who created the upscale Manhattan magazine Avenue, said
he would be forming a partnership with Univisa, an international
company that produces and distributes television and radio
programming.
   ``I have been in the communications business for most of my
professional life,'' his statement said. ``This opportunity will
allow me as a partner in the enterprise to explore a range of new
media ventures.''
   Univisa is the American sister company of Televisa, a Mexico
City-based conglomerate with wide business holdings. It is
privately held and has estimated revenues of more than $600 million
annually, the statement said.
   Price said he was leaving the Post in good shape.
   ``The financial losses have been stemmed and the paper should be
profitable by the end of 1989,'' his statement said. ``Daily
circulation has increased by over 100,000 since the paper was
acquired'' and advertising linage is up.
   Price, a graduate of Princeton University and Yale University's
law school, joined Time Inc. in 1965 and rose to become assistant
to the publisher of Life magazine, circulation manager of Sports
Illustrated and director of corporate development for Time Inc.
   From 1970 to 1976, he and partners formed Media Networks, which
provided advertising services to newspapers, magazines and cable TV
companies.

   The U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese yen
Tuesday morning, while share prices rose sharply on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
203.39 points Monday, added another 276.06 points, or 0.84 percent,
to finish the morning session at 33,318.13, another new high.
   The dollar, which opened at 131.63 yen, down 0.63 yen from
Monday's closing, was changing hands at about 131.40 yen at late
morning. The currency traded in the range of 131.20 to 131.88 yen
during the morning.
   A communique released Monday by the Group of Seven leading
industrialized nations in Washington, in which finance officials
reaffirmed the desirability of stable currency rates, forced the
U.S. currency lower, dealers said.
   The dollar also fell in Tokyo because of dollar-selling by
European central banks in New York and London overnight, traders
said.
   The Bank of Japan reportedly sold dollars Monday for the first
time since 1985.
   But market sentiment in Tokyo still favored a strong dollar,
mainly because of higher interest rates in the United States, said
a trader with a major commercial bank in Tokyo, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   On the stock market, the gain in the Dow Jones industrial
average in New York on Monday, lower oil prices and a strengthening
of the yen boosted stock- buying orders from Japanese investors,
said Yoshio Shimoyama of Nikko Securities.
   He said the yen's recent upward move relieved investors.
   ``In addition to individual investors, institutional investors
who had been sitting on the sidelines finally began participating,
and helped make trading active,'' he said.
