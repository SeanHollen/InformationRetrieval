   The state of Nevada has filed suit
against U.S. Energy Secretary James Watkins over Watkins' continued
efforts to locate a high-level nuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain.
   Brian McKay, the state's attorney general, said Wednesday he
filed the lawsuit in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San
Francisco, seeking the court's endorsement of the 1989
Legislature's formal rejection to Congress of the Yucca Mountain
site.
   ``Despite our notice to Congress ... and Congress' silent
acceptance of that fact, Secretary Watkins continues to pursue the
project,'' McKay said, adding that the DOE is violating terms of
the federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act.
   The state contends that Watkins has made it clear to Congress
that he is pushing for the Yucca Mountain site ``in excess of his
statutory jurisdiction and authority and contrary to constitutional
right.''
   The lawsuit asks for an order that the site is unsuitable for a
dump, and that Watkins stop all site studies and related activity.
   The suit was filed a day after Gov. Bob Miller said he had
rejected four permit requests by the DOE to study the suitability
of the proposed Nevada site for the nation's first high-level
radioactive waste dump.
   ``The Legislature has passed and I have signed bills that make
the dump illegal here,'' he said. ``We cannot issue permits
allowing the DOE to begin testing a site we have outlawed. They
can't proceed without these permits.''
   Carl Gertz, project manager for the energy department at the
proposed Yucca Mountain site agreed that Miller's action made a
court battle inevitible. He said a lawsuit would be filed early
next year to obtain the permits.
   ``It seems strange to us that state officials say Yucca Mountain
is not suitable for the repository, yet the state will not grant us
the permits needed to make that determination scientifically,''
Gertz said.
   Energy department officials maintain the state cannot ban the
repository until the president recommends a site to Congress.
Miller said Nevada's position and that of the energy department
will have to be resolved in court.
   Current plans call for a waste site to be established by the
year 2010 to store 70,000 metric tons of radioactive wastes for
10,000 years. Yucca Mountain is the only location in the country
that currently is under consideration.

   NASA has started testing sensors aboard
Galileo, five days after the spacecraft successfully fired its
thrusters for a second course correction on its journey to Venus
and Jupiter.
   ``We're testing all of the scientific instruments to ensure they
are ready to observe Venus'' when Galileo whizzes past the
cloud-shrouded planet Feb. 9, said Jim Wilson, spokesman for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   On Friday, Galileo fired its thrusters during a 2{-hour period
so that it will fly about 6,200 miles above the Venusian cloudtops,
Wilson said.
   ``The maneuver went off exactly as planned,'' Galileo mission
director Neal Ausman said.
   Wilson said another maneuver may be needed in late January to
fine-tune the spacecraft's trajectory. The first trajectory
maneuver was performed in November.
   Galileo was launched from the space shuttle Atlantis on Oct. 18.
It will swoop by Venus once and Earth twice so those planets can
act as ``gravity slingshots'' to propel Galileo toward its 1995
encounter with Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet.
   On Wednesday, the spacecraft was 12{ million miles from Earth,
but had traveled almost 105 million miles along its looping
185-million-mile path to Venus, Wilson said.
   The spacecraft still has 2.3 billion miles left out of its
2.4-billion-mile trip to Jupiter.
   After flying past Earth in December 1990 and December 1992,
Galileo will separate into an orbiter and a probe in July 1995.
   The orbiter will circle the giant gas planet for 22 months
starting in December 1995, the same month the probe will parachute
into the Jovian atmosphere, collecting information for 75 minutes
until it is crushed by overwhelming atmospheric pressure.
   Scientific information that Galileo collects during February's
Venus flyby won't be transmitted back to Earth until late October,
after the spacecraft unfurls its umbrella-shaped, high-gain
antenna, Wilson said.
   The antenna would be damaged by heat if it were as deployed near
Venus, the second planet from the sun, he added.

<HEAD>State Proposes `Instant Housing' Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A glut of unsold condominiums around
Connecticut could provide ``instant housing'' for families with low
or moderate incomes, state Housing Commissioner John F. Papandrea
said Wednesday.
   He proposed that his agency help non-profit corporations and
housing authorities acquire the units using grants or loans from
his department. He said entire developments, parts of developments
and even individual condos would be considered for inclusion in the
program.
   The non-profit sponsors then would sell or rent the units to
families with incomes at or below 100 percent of the area median
for rental housing and at or below 135 percent of the area median
for ownership.
   Papandrea said the goal is to get as many as 500 condos sold
under the program.
   He called it ``a unique opportunity'' for his department to help
low- and moderate-income residents.
   ``It's not a bailout of developers, or of banks holding
construction mortgages in default. We will openly consider prices
that are below market rate,'' he said.
   ``We're looking for the most favorable deals to benefit the
greatest number of people (while using) the least amount of state
funds,'' the commissioner said at a news conference. ``Connecticut
is faced with a severe shortage of affordable housing. There are
thousands of ill-housed families throughout the state.''
   Jude D. Brennan, president of the 17,000-member Connecticut
Association of Realtors, said he hoped the program would not
compete with other state housing programs that have proven
beneficial to Connecticut families.
   But, he said, ``we simply do not know enough of the details of
the new program to make an informed judgment.''
   Department officials said the program is intended to help meet a
goal of providing 3,000 new units by the end of next year for
families now unable to afford the rental or home-buying markets.
The officials said there are thousands of vacant condominiums for
sale in the state.
   The criteria for selecting the condominiums, in addition to
price and local housing needs, would be to provide affordable units
in suburbs and small towns.
   The Connecticut Housing Finance Authority would provide
low-interest mortgages to some of the families who buy the units
from the housing authorities or non-profit agencies.
   The state treasurer's office is expected to coordinate the
involvemet of banks or other lenders in providing either mortgage
or down-payment assistance. The lenders also would provide loans to
non-profit agencies to finance the purchase of the vacant
condominiums.

<HEAD>South Koreans Watch Romanian Collapse ... And Think Of The North</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Koreans watched Romania's
revolution stirred by the hope that communist North Korea will see
itself in the mirror and decide to change its rigid, totalitarian
ways.
   Romania's executed president, Nicolae Ceausescu, was the last
hard-line communist leader in the Warsaw Pact. His repressive rule
in isolated Romania often was compared to that of North Korea's Kim
Il Sung.
   Newspapers and TV stations here exhaustively covered the
collapse and a flood of editorials cautioned that North Korea risks
similar bloodshed if it fails to change.
   ``The North Korean leadership may well realize that its days are
numbered,'' said a Korea Times editorial. Romania, it added, ``will
hopefully serve as a grave warning to the Pyongyang leadership.''
   North Korea recognized the new Bucharest government on
Wednesday, saying it regards recent events as an internal Romanian
matter and expects to keep its ties with the Romanian people.
   Longtime observers saw the north's move as predictable and a
stall for time while it prepared a scenario to explain the new view
of the world to a citizenry used to accepting as dangerous any but
hard-line communist ideology.
   One Western diplomat, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said: ``Hope for change is premature. North Korea feels change in
East Europe is the result of a bungled bureaucracy and since it has
no bureaucracy, it feels it needs no reform and has no problem.''
   In addition, North Korea is an Asian nation, not a European one
_ a nation bordered on the north and west by the Soviet Union and
China and on the east by the Sea of Japan. Capitalist South Korea,
inaccessible to North Koreans, is portrayed as a beggar country, a
stooge of American imperialists.
   North Koreans are isolated. They have no access to Western TV,
publications or merchandise, symbols diplomats call ``singing
commercials for capitalism.'' Citizens cannot leave the country
without permission.
   U.S. and South Korean observers see little possibility of a
popular uprising in the north. Any hint of dissent is crushed there
and the only news is that dictated by the government over
government-controlled radio stations.
   President Roh Tae-woo of South Korea said in a Christmas address
that North Korea is a tyranny which ``continues to hold sway,
seemingly uninfluenced by the winds of change blowing across so
many other communist states.''
   Still, Romania is bad news for the communist regime in the
north, which has portrayed Romania as a brother state, said Kim
Chang-soon, president of the Seoul government-funded North Korean
Affairs Research Institute.
   ``A news blockade may be the only choice they can make,'' ge
saud,
   Many South Koreans hope the north will see Romania's collapse as
a signal to be more receptive to capitalism and eventual
reunification of the two Koreas.
   The Korean peninsula was split into communist north and
capitalist south in 1945, a 155-mile Demilitarized Zone dividing
them. The DMZ is site of one of the world's greatest military
concentrations with 1.5 million heavily armed troops patrolling the
border.
   To help ease tensions, Seoul has worked to establish ties with
communist and East bloc nations. A spate of north-south talks has
been held this year, with little progress. The two countries remain
enemies.
   North Korea kept ties with communist and East bloc allies
undergoing change, but it shared a special kinship with Romania.
   Only last month, North Korea sent a congratulatory message to
the 14th Romanian Communist Party Congress in which it stressed a
joint struggle against capitalism. North Korea's foreign minister,
Kim Yong Nam, reportedly visited Bucharest just weeks ago to
reaffirm relations between the two countries.
   North Korea remains a totalitarian, inflexible regime under
77-year-old Kim Il Sung, who has dominated it with a personality
cult since the late 1940s. Kim designated his son as his political
heir in what would be the world's first communist dynasty.
   Most South Korean and U.S. observers reckon as almost nil the
prospect of change in North Korea while Kim Il Sung remains in
control. They say his son Kim Jong Il appears bent on continuing
the system.
   ``There are many similarities in the way Romania and communist
North Korea have held onto clannish despotism,'' said a Korea
Herald editorial. ``Few expected ... (Ceausescu) could be toppled
so quickly and easily. The Pyongyang regime must realize that
change will be the only option it will have in the very near
future.''

   A librarian stood in the ashes of a
half million books inside the scorched, shell-pocked walls of the
once prestigious University Library and wondered aloud if Romania
can ever return to normal.
   ``Things are not returning to normal because we don't know what
normality is,'' said librarian Ion Visoiu.
   ``We have to learn how to live as decent, normal beings. We know
about civilized life only from books, from our traditions and from
our parents. Nobody here knows it personally.''
   The burned-out library near the center of Palace Square was
destroyed by the fierce weekend fighting that followed the ouster
of Nicolae Ceausescu, the Communist dictator whose 24-year reign of
terror still frightens and mystifies.
   ``Probably in each of us there is a little of Ceausescu,'' said
Visoiu. ``He wasn't so special. He was rather common. But he was
shrewd enough to get enough power to become a monster.''
   Tanks and armored cars still filled the square on Wednesday
afternoon, but the mood was light and jubilant. Old men embraced
young soldiers. Groups of women handed up pastries and hot coffee
to tank crewmen lounging beside their machine guns, some of which
have bouquets of flowers taped to the barrels.
   Smiling children posed in front of massive tanks for their
parents' cameras. Thousands of people strolled through the square,
gawking at the Royal Palace battered by machine guns, at the ruins
of the library and at other buildings shattered and burned by the
fighting.
   There was still some scattered shooting. After dark, isolated
bursts of automatic weapons fire crackled in the distance.
   ``But there is no fighting here,'' shrugged a smiling soldier in
Palace Square. Ceausescu's dreaded security police had put up a
fierce fight but were reported surrendering by the hundreds after
learning of his execution.
   Glazers were already at work Wednesday replacing some of the
windows shot out along Victoria Street, which leads into the square.
   Apartment dwellers cleared the debris from their balconies
overhead and boarded up bullet-shattered windows.
   Romanians are digging out, preparing to go on with their lives.
   A few blocks south of Palace Square three barbers calmly clipped
hair in their small shop. A line of about 35 people stretched out
in front of a store where cheese and sausage could be bought.
   ``This is just the beginning,'' said Sorin Serb. ``Maybe after a
year we can talk about our political destiny.''
   He looked at the ruins and shell-scarred buildings and shook his
head as he thought about what had happend.
   ``All this in just one day,'' he said. ``There was this
wonderful eruption of the people'' in Bucharest exactly one week
ago.
   A few blocks north of Palace Square scores of people lined up to
buy canned vegetables, bottled juice, cheese and some bags of dry
pasta.
   ``It is the kind of food we had before the revolution but now
you don't need a ration card. The goverment has stopped the exports
of food,'' said one student who asked not to be identified.
   It is a commonly heard complaint in Romania that Ceausescu
exported food for profit while his people went hungry.
   Across the street from the food store about 200 people stood in
line in temperatures just above freezing outside a shop where an
18-wheel truck had just unloaded a huge shipment of frozen beef.
   ``There was nothing like this before. This was for export,''
said the student, suggesting the new government has redirected food
formerly for export to the state stores.
   ``It is a good idea. The first step is to build confidence in
the government,'' he said.
   Others agreed, saying their lives had already changed
dramatically.
   ``I feel completely transformed. Things that did not happen in
30 years happened in a few days. We are not the same men we were on
Dec. 21,'' said Marin Ghezu, a furniture maker in line outside the
meat store.
   That was the day before Ceausescu was overthrown in the revolt.
On Monday, both he and his wife and second-in-command, Elena, were
summarily tried and executed.
   ``Life will be more beautiful than it was before. These changes
will last. They will last for eternity.'' said Ghezu.
   ``We cannot speak any more about the Comunist Party. We cannot
say those words. We must wipe them from our mind,'' said Ghezu.
   ``About what party are you talking?'' a middle-aged woman asked
Ghezu. ``There is no party any more,'' she scolded. ``Do not talk
nonsense. ''

   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was
rocked by a special hit list as Armed Forces radio played through
loudspeakers pointed at his refuge, the Vatican Embassy.
   ``Baby You're No Good,'' by Linda Ronstadt, ``Voodoo Child'' by
Jimi Hendrix and Bobby Fuller's ``I Fought the Law and the Law
Won'' were some of tunes that appeared on the radio playlist
Wednesday afternoon.
   The olive-green loudspeakers were set up by some of the 100
soldiers who ringed the embassy compound to keep Noriega from
getting away.
   Standing by their armored cars, the soldiers first heard David
Bowie's ``Modern Love,'' played so loudly it easily reached the top
of the nearby Holiday Inn, where reporters kept a vigil on the
embassy.
   The radio then played a string of rap songs, which shook the
building, before switching to the news.
   If Noriega wasn't wearing earplugs, he heard that the United
States is trying to freeze millions in his alleged cocaine earnings
in foreign countries.
   He also heard newly installed President Guillermo Endara call
him ``a common criminal of the worst kind ... accused of homicides
and narcotraffic and very, very horrendous crimes.''
   Later in the day, the troops moved up a tank with a 152mm cannon
next to the embassy's west wall, although the cannon was not
pointed at the embassy.
   The Cuban Embassy, in downtown Panama City, was surrounded by
coils of barbed wire. And along the street leading to the Cuban
ambassador's residence in the plush San Francisco district,
American troops manned roadblocks and allowed only people who live
in the street to go in.
   The embassies of Nicaragua, Spain and Libya were also surrounded
to prevent Noriega henchmen from seeking refuge there.
   American diplomats have declined comment on the legality of the
actions in a swift little war in which the rules seemed to have
vanished with the first puff of gunsmoke.
   On Tuesday, the Vatican ambassador, Monsignor Sebastian Laboa,
was frisked and his car searched by American troops as he left the
embassy, a rare if not unheard of occurrence because accredited
diplomats carry immunity rights that are especially valued in Latin
America.
   Noriega's ouster and capture were among the top goals of the
U.S. invasion. The Vatican Embassy, which Endara once used for
sanctuary when he was in the opposition and Noriega ran the
country, was one of the likely places of refuge the Americans
didn't stake out.
   But now that he is in there, it is vigilantly guarded.
   A few troops in sandbagged positions remain around the Cuban
Embassy, which is close to that of Spain. Nobody answers the
embassy doorbell.
   At the residence, Cuban Ambassador Lazaro Mora was apparently
inside with a considerable number of other people, but polite U.S.
soldiers told inquiring reporters, ``You can't come here.''
   Neighbors said that in the days immediately after the American
troops invaded there was a flurry of activity outside the home.
``Cars were going in and out three and five at a time and they
looked like they were full of food,`` said a woman who lives nearby.
   ``A man in that house over there can see into the courtyard and
he said he saw 14 cars. There is never that much activity there,''
she said.
   Speculation about who may be inside varies. A call went out for
a pediatrician a couple of nights ago. On Wednesday, one resident
said she saw a man crawl over the compound wall and run.
   ``We told him the Americans would shoot him if he ran. He told
us, `The Americans will shoot me if they catch me,''' she said.

   A men's climbing club plans to

while a women's group plans a more sedate celebration on top of a
nearby mountain.
   The AdAmAn Club plans to set off $3,000 worth of fireworks,
including a barrage of rockets and mortar shells, from atop Pike's
Peak on New Year's Eve.
   It will be the 66th annual climb for the AdAmAn Club, which gets

$7.50 in sparklers atop 8,720-foot Pyramid Mountain.
   At midnight, the women plan to wave sparklers and sing, ``I Am

   So when NBC announced plans for the TV movie ``Dreamer of Oz,''
resort officials campaigned to have the movie filmed on location.
   But Michigan's unpredictable and often nasty winter weather
persuaded NBC to make the movie in sunny Southern California.
   ``The weather everywhere else is really unpredictable,'' said

<HEAD>Companies, Not Taxpayers, to Pay for Nuclear Arms Mistakes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government will stop reimbursing operators
of nuclear weapons plants for their own criminal fines,
environmental penalties, fraudulent losses and other questionable
costs, officials say.
   The decision, spurred by growing congressional criticism of the
weapons program, marks the most fundamental change in the Energy
Department's weapons contracting system since companies were
recruited to build the first atomic bombs in the 1940s.
   The companies traditionally have been allowed to recover
virtually all their costs, even those resulting from their own
negligence. The logic was that weapons production was so
specialized and vital to national security that the government
could not afford to risk losing a plant operator over money matters.
   The new thinking, under Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, is
that the weapons contractors will perform better if they are held
accountable for their mistakes.
   Under the new system, the government will continue paying
contractors' normal operating expenses, but for the first time all
costs resulting from negligence will be borne by the companies
instead of the taxpayers, Stephen A. Wakefield, the Energy
Department's general counsel, said in an interview.
   Wakefield said a formal proposal to amend the department's
regulations to end the practice of reimbursing all contractor costs
will be announced in January, and it could become official policy
by late spring. Detailed application would be made in the annual
negotiations with each contractor that normally set the terms under
which bonuses are awarded in the coming year.
   Private companies run all 17 major facilities in the nuclear
weapons complex. The Energy Department spends about $11 billion a
year on the arms program.
   The issue of liability is important because the plants have
billions of dollars in environmental problems, and some continue to
violate environmental laws. The Rocky Flats plutonium processing
plant in Colorado is under FBI investigation for possible criminal
violations of federal hazardous waste laws.
   In exchange for assuming a bigger share of the financial risk of
operating the weapons plants, the contractors will be offered
bigger bonus payments for excellent work, Wakefield said.
   Wakefield declined to say how much extra bonus money would be
made available, but he said ``it would not be unreasonable'' to
think current fees might be doubled.
   The companies typically can earn several million dollars a year
for operating the plants. For example, Westinghouse Electric Corp.,
which holds contracts to run several of the plants, earned $3.9
million in bonus fees from April through September for operating
the Savannah River nuclear facility near Aiken, S.C.
   Wakefield said ``there are varying levels of concern'' among the
companies which have been briefed on the outlines of the contract
changes.
   ``A couple of them have said, `Well, this is one more thing we
have to consider in ... deciding do we want to be in this
business,''' Wakefield said, adding that none so far has indicated
it would withdraw as a result of the changes.
   Wakefield cited several examples of circumstances under which
the department no longer would reimburse the contractors:
   _Environmental fines and related legal costs stemming from
actions by the contractor that could reasonably have been avoided.
Last month the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, reported that the department had reimbursed two plant
contracts for $295,000 in fines levied for violations of hazardous
waste laws _ plus $529,000 in the companies' legal costs.
   _Damage to government property as a result of negligence.
Wakefield said that if the new contract provision had been in place
in January, E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., which then was operator
at Savannah River, would have been liable for damage to several
nuclear reactor valves caused by improper testing procedures. The
department has estimated the valve damage at $20,000.
   _Damage to third parties, including people and property outside
the plant, due to negligence by the contractor. Wakefield said this
could, under some circumstances, mean the contractor instead of the
government would have to pay for environmental or health damage
resulting from the spread of radioactive contamination.

   The nation will need 15 percent more classroom
teachers by the year 2000 to cope with a dramatic increase in the
number of pupils, the Department of Education says.
   The teachers are expected to be better paid than today, said a
department study released Wednesday.
   Total elementary and secondary school enrollment is expected to
reach 49.5 million by the end of the century, a gain of about 9
percent, said the study titled ``Projections of Education
Statistics to 2000.''
   Enrollment has declined 4 percent in the past 11 years. The
expected turnaround is attributed to an increase in births that
began in 1977 and has continued in most years since then.
   Its impact will be felt most strongly at the secondary school
level, which has lower student-teacher ratios and a greater range
of subjects. Enrollment in secondary schools is expected to climb
to 14.8 million, an increase of 18 percent.
   The pupil-teacher ratio will continue to drop, although not as
steeply as in the 1980s, the study said. By the year 2000, the
ratio for elementary and secondary schools, both public and
private, is expected to be 16.1 students per teacher. It is now
16.9, and in 1978 it was 19.2.
   The average public school teacher is expected to earn 14 percent
more in real purchasing power, after adjusting for inflation, in
the year 2000 than now, the study said. The national average today
is $31,200.
   ``This publication will be a useful planning tool for our
nation's governors, federal, state and local leaders and members of
the business community,'' Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said in
a statement.
   College and university enrollments are expected to increase from
12.8 million to 13.4 million, a gain of 4 percent. Faculty also
will increase by 4 percent, from 741,000 in 1988 to 771,000 in 2000.
   In 1999, for the first time, more doctoral degrees are expected
to be awarded to women than to men. Women have led men in
associate, bachelor's and master's degrees for several years. Men
are expected to continue to dominate first professional degrees in
such fields as medicine and law.

   Angry homeowners, besieged oil delivery
companies and governors across the Northeast are calling on federal
officials to find out why home heating oil prices skyrocketed this
month to their highest levels ever.
   The price jump from about 85 cents a gallon two weeks ago to as
high as $1.62 per gallon now has led officials from Gov. Mario
Cuomo of New York to Gov. Judd Gregg in New Hampshire to call for
federal investigations of possible gouging and price-fixing.
   Whether oil companies are in collusion or not, public officials
and industry experts agree that an unusual confluence of events has
led to the highest prices ever for home heating oil.
   Events ranging from low water levels on the Rhine River in
Germany to a refinery explosion in Louisiana have contributed to
the upsurge, officials say. Above all, though, is the record cold
spell that has gripped much of the nation this month. For the
Northeast, forecasters are calling for more chill temperatures this
weekend after a brief respite.
   ``It's pretty grim,'' said Sam Livieri Jr., vice president of
Apple Oil Co. in Branford, Conn. ``No, it's very grim. We're
telling people $1.29 a gallon and they can't afford it. I don't
blame them for being upset.''
   J. Wallace Malley, chief of the public protection division of
Vermont's attorney general's office, said, ``It's what some people
might call a gouge.'' But he added that as yet there is no evidence
of unlawful price-fixing.
   Cuomo on Wednesday called on the Justice Department to
investigate the heating oil price increases. ``Home heating oil is
a necessity, not a luxury,'' Cuomo said. Massachusetts Gov. Michael
S. Dukakis was the first to call for a probe, writing to the
Department of Energy last week along with Rep. Richard Neal, a
Massachusetts Democrat whose office has been deluged with calls
from angry homeowners.
   New Hampshire's Gregg ordered his energy chief to call federal
energy officials. Rhode Island Gov. Edward D. DiPrete sent a
telegram Wednesday to the head of the Federal Trade Commission
requesting an investigation into the price hikes.
   ``I'm outraged by what's happened here and it's not a factor and
force of the market place,'' Neal said. ``Supplies could well have
been kept low in anticipation of a cold winter in an effort to jack
the prices.''
   About two-thirds of the homes in New England use truck-delivered
heating oil, according to the New England Fuel Institute, which
represents 1,300 companies. Unlike electricity and natural gas,
home heating fuel is unregulated and therefore subject to market
fluctuations.
   Institute spokesman Bernard Smith rejected the charge of price
manipulation.
   ``If you take one word it's `demand' and the second word is
`weather,''' said Smith. The low water level of the Rhine River in
Germany is slowing deliveries to Europe and thus tying up supplies,
he said.
   In addition, cold weather in southern states has caused about a
half-dozen refineries to shut down or limit production because the
temperatures hamper the refining process, he said. And, an
explosion over the weekend at an Exxon refinery in Baton Rouge,
La., caused the heating oil futures market to soar.
   Prices this week topped the previous peak of $1.35 per gallon in
1981 at the end of the Arab oil embargo, according to Smith. The
lowest level of the past decade came when prices dipped to about 55
cents per gallon during the summer of 1986, according to Smith.
   ``One supplier jumped 12 cents from yesterday, and our retail
price is now $1.23 per gallon, with a small discount for people who
pay on delivery,'' Joe Bosse of Bosse Fuel in Waterbury, Conn. said
Wednesday. ``That reflects the 12-cent jump in wholesale prices in
New Haven yesterday.''
   Energy Department spokeswoman Mary Kayne Heinze said the
department was aware of the concern in the Northeast and was
collecting information to assess the situation, but had reached no
conclusions.
   In Maine, prices are running about 10 cents per gallon behind
the rest of the region.
   ``The port of Portland is probably in the best shape in terms of
supply of any port on the East Coast,'' said Eugene A. Gilford,
president of the Maine Oil Dealers Association. Nevertheless,
Gilford said, even oil delivery companies in Maine are calling for
an investigation into the skyrocketing wholesale prices.

<HEAD>Golden Globe Nominations Mix Likely Films With Unusual Selections</HEAD>

   Mixing the predictable with the
unusual, the nominations for the 47th Annual Golden Globes honored
pop hits like ``When Harry Met Sally ...'' but ignored acclaimed
movies such as ``Henry V.''
   The Golden Globes, announced by the Hollywood Foreign Press
Association on Wednesday, often serve as a bellwether for the
Academy Awards. But some of this year's selections were so unusual
it seems unlikely the Oscars will follow suit.
   The foreign press, unlike the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences, divides films and star performances into two categories,
drama and musical or comedy.
   Among the stranger nominations: Jack Nicholson, picked for best
actor in a musical or comedy for ``Batman,'' which almost everyone
considers a drama; and Bruce Willis, named for best supporting
actor for ``In Country,'' the movie in which Willis is the most
prominent player.
   The critically acclaimed Holocaust drama ``Enemies, A Love
Story'' was blanked, as was Steven Spielberg's ``Always.'' ``Henry
V'' and its star Kenneth Brannagh did not collect any nominations.
``Drugstore Cowboy'' was ignored as well.
   ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' ``Glory'' and ``When Harry Met
Sally ...,'' all films released in the second half of the year,
drew five Golden Globe nominations apiece. Earning four nominations
each were ``Dead Poets Society,'' ``Do the Right Thing'' and ``The
Little Mermaid.''
   Tom Cruise, who stars in ``Born on the Fourth of July'' as the
paraplegic Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic, received one of the movie's
five nominations, for best dramatic actor.
   The film was also nominated for best dramatic motion picture,
best director (Oliver Stone), best screenplay (Stone and Kovic),
and best original score (John Williams).
   ``Glory,'' the story of an all-black Civil War regiment,
collected nominations for best dramatic motion picture, best
director (Edward Zwick), best supporting actor (Denzel Washington),
best screenplay (Kevin Jarre) and best original score (James
Horner).
   The romantic comedy ``When Harry Met Sally ...'' was selected
for best musical or comic picture, best comic actor (Billy
Crystal), best comic actress (Meg Ryan), best director (Rob Reiner)
and best screenplay (Nora Ephron).
   Steven Soderbergh, the heralded director of ``sex, lies and
videotape,'' was nominated not for his directing but for his
writing. The film also was picked for best dramatic actress for
Andie MacDowell and best supporting actress for Laura San Giacomo.
   The Golden Globe voters paid little attention to some of this
year's box-office blockbusters, including ``Honey, I Shrunk the
Kids,'' ``Look Who's Talking'' and ``Ghostbusters II,'' which
received no nominations. ``Batman'' and ``Indiana Jones and the
Last Crusade'' earned only one each.
   In the foreign press' TV nominations, the leading nominee was
``L.A. Law'' with eight. ``Cheers'' and ``Lonesome Dove'' followed
with four each.
   Joining ``Glory'' and ``Born on the Fourth of July'' in the race
for best dramatic motion picture are ``Crimes and Misdemeanors,''
``Dead Poets Society'' and ``Do the Right Thing.''
   Apart from ``When Harry Met Sally ...,'' the battle for best
comic or musical movie includes ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' ``The
Little Mermaid,'' ``Shirley Valentine'' and ``The War of the
Roses.''
   The Golden Globes will be presented at the Beverly Hilton Hotel
on Jan. 20 and will be seen on the TBS Superstation in a show
produced by Dick Clark.
   The foreign press will present its honorary Cecil B. DeMille
award to Audrey Hepburn.

   Former President Reagan regaled the
University of Southern California football team with tales of his
portrayal of George Gipp, but the role didn't impress Michigan
coach Bo Schembechler.
   Reagan, a Bel-Air resident, showed up at a recent practice to
watch the 12th-ranked Trojans prepare for their Rose Bowl contest
with No. 3 Michigan on New Year's Day.
   Reagan told the team a story about the filming of ``Knute
Rockne, All-American,'' in which he played the legendary Notre Dame
running back.
   ``I saw him play in the movie, and he didn't look good enough to
beat us,'' Schembechler said Wednesday. ``And he should be down in
Miami, supporting the Gipper's team, Notre Dame.''
   The Fighting Irish play No. 1 Colorado in the Orange Bowl on New
Year's Day.
   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, planned to visit the Palm Springs
desert estate of friend Walter Annenberg on their annual New Year's
pilgrimage.
   The Reagans are scheduled to leave Friday for the 110-mile trip
to the luxurious walled estate of the former ambassador to Great
Britain. It will be their 22nd annual New Year's holiday at the
Annenberg compound.

   Rock 'n' roll legend Chuck Berry has
been accused in a lawsuit of secretly videotaping women using a
restaurant restroom.
   Hosana A. Huck, 48, a former cook at a restaurant owned by
Berry, filed the lawsuit Tuesday in St. Charles County Circuit
Court seeking unspecified damages.
   Huck, who worked at the Southern Air in Wentzville, about 30
miles from St. Louis, said she and other employees and customers
were taped and that it humiliated her and caused her distress.
   Berry, 63, who lives near Wentzville, was unavailable for
comment. Calls to his restaurant went unanswered Wednesday.
   The lawsuit says the videotapes ``were created for the improper
purpose of the entertainment and gratification'' of Berry's
``sexual fetishes and sexual predilections.''
   The duck-walking guitarist is known for such hits as ``Roll Over
Beethoven'' and ``Johnny B. Goode.''

   Irish lawmaker Pat Gallagher has married
a woman who served nine years in prison after being convicted of
Irish Republican Army activities in Britain.
   Anne Gallagher, 38, and her sister Eileen Gillespie, were
sentenced to 15 years in prison for conspiring to cause explosions
and possessing explosives. They were released in 1983.
   The trial judge described the sisters as ``sinister and evil IRA
bombers.''
   Gallagher, 41, said earlier this year that his wife deserves a
chance of a normal life.
   ``I know my constituents do not think any the worse of me,''
said the junior minister in Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey's
government.
   The couple married Wednesday in Dunlewy, County Donegal, 140
miles northwest of Dublin.
   The IRA is fighting British rule in Northern Ireland. It wants
to unite the predominantly Protestant province with the 95 percent
Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland under socialist rule.

   Actress Greer Garson Fogelson is
reconsidering the sale of her 10,000-acre ranch after learning the
proposed buyer would convert it into a resort, her representatives
said.
   Although the 81-year-old Mrs. Fogelson had decided at one point
to sell the ranch, she no longer is certain after learning of the
extent of the proposed development, spokeswoman Jean Carpenter said
Wednesday in Dallas, where the actress lives.
   Pecos National Monument Superintendent Linda Stoll said last
week that Indian ruins at the monument could be damaged by air
traffic and housing if the adjacent 10,000-acre Forked Lightning
Ranch along the Pecos River in central New Mexico became a resort.
   Capital Developers International Inc. of Orlando, Fla., is
negotiating to buy the property. Stoll said plans for the resort
include an airfield, private hunting reserve, two golf courses, a
454-acre shopping center, a race track for cars and motorcycles and
housing developments.
   Capital's answering service said Wednesday nobody from the
company would be available to comment until Jan. 10.
   The actress starred in such films as ``Mrs. Miniver,''
``Goodbye, Mr. Chips,'' ``Pride and Prejudice'' and ``Sunrise at
Campobello'' in a career that spanned 40 years.

<HEAD>Drugs Blamed for Making '89 a Record Year for Homicide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Murder rates soared to new highs in some of the nation's largest
cities in 1989, but at least eight cities saw a surprising drop in
homicides.
   Police were quick to blame crack for homicide records that were
set in at least seven cities, but they were less certain about why
there was less killing elsewhere.
   One official suggested that violence may have ebbed in cities
where drug dealers have already won their turf wars by killing off
rivals and dividing up territory.
   Final 1989 statistics in most cities won't be prepared for at
least several weeks, but a preliminary survey by The Associated
Press of police departments in more than 30 cities shows that the
number of homicides rose in most of them.
   ``A large amount of the increase has to do with the violence
associated with the drug trade,'' said Hubert Williams, executive
director of the Police Foundation.
   Police officials across the nation echoed his statement.
   More homicides were committed this year than ever before in
Washington, Philadelphia, New Orleans, Kansas City, Milwaukee,
Charlotte, N.C., and New Haven, Conn.
   Several other cities, including New York City, are likely to
have set records when final 1989 statistics are compiled.
   In some big cities _ Chicago, Los Angeles and Baltimore, among
them _ the number of killings is up from last year but nowhere near
the all-time high.
   At least eight cities, including Miami, Dallas and Denver,
expect to end the year with a slight decline in homicides. The
other cities: Minneapolis; Indianapolis; Portland, Ore.; Virginia
Beach, Va.; and Newark, N.J.
   Police offered no explanations for the decline, but Williams of
the Police Foundation said those cities might just be ahead of
others in the sophistication of their drug kingpins.
   ``It's my sense, at least, that the homicides related to drug
trafficking begin to peak as the turf battles begin to break out,
and diminish as someone gains control,'' he said.
   In New York, which always has the largest number of homicides in
the nation, killings totaled 1,773 as of Nov. 24. That is 19 more
than were committed in the same period of 1988.
   In September alone, 197 people were killed, making it one of the
bloodiest months in the city's history.
   Assistant Police Chief Raymond Kelly attributed the rise to
crack, the smokeable form of cocaine. He noted that in 1978, there
were 1,504 homicides in New York.
   ``What's different now than in the late '70s and early '80s? The
answer is crack,'' Kelly said.
   Although New York claims the largest number of violent deaths,
Washington is the most murderous big city on a per capita basis.
   A police spokesman there, Lt. Reginald Smith, estimated that 60
percent of this year's homicides were drug-related.
   Through Dec. 21, 419 people had been killed in the District of
Columbia in 1989, compared with the previous all-time high of 369
set last year.
   In Philadelphia, there were 481 killings by Dec. 21, well above
the 15-year-old record of 444. Police blamed not just drugs but the
fact that today's drug dealers are far better armed than their
counterparts in the past.
   ``Before they had zip guns and homemade weapons. Now they have
automatic weapons, Uzis,'' said Sgt. Robert Snyder, a 32-year
police veteran.

<HEAD>Ag Department Working on New Slug-Killing Chemical</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department scientist has
duplicated a quackgrass chemical that is deadly to slugs, those
slimy things that nibble at backyard gardens and farm crops.
   The slug-killing chemical is emitted into the soil by quackgrass
after it is killed. Thus, the department said Wednesday, when
farmers destroy quackgrass they also kill some slugs.
   ``The poison is highly specific to slugs,'' said weed scientist
Roger D. Hagin. ``It has been tested with no ill effects on three
species of freshwater snails, as well as mammals in general.''
   Hagin, who works at the agency's Plant Protection Research Unit
in Ithaca, N.Y., has successfully isolated and synthesized the
quackgrass compound. A patent on the material is in the works,
which could clear the way for commercial development of a new
lethal bait for slugs.
   Commercial poisons are available now to kill slugs, but those
also are toxic to birds and animals, he said. The quackgrass
treatment could be applied at much lower rates and at less cost.
   Hagin field-tested the compound for two years in snapbeans,
alfalfa and other crops. He said the snapbean yields were nearly
doubled as a result of reduced slug damage.
   Quackgrass is widespread and competes strongly for fertilizer
and water in crops such as corn, soybeans and forages, Hagin said.
   ``Most of the crops that grow in temperate regions have problems
with quackgrass,'' he said. ``Cattle will graze it fairly well, but
there are other things you'd rather have them eat.''
   Slugs are especially troublesome in humid areas and have taken a
heavy toll of West Coast strawberry fields and citrus orchards.
Hagin said they also interfere with corn production on the East
Coast.
   Further, slugs are a serious problem in no-till or
minimum-tillage farming, where the soil is not cultivated heavily.
   ``We're currently looking at the possibility of using the slug
poison compound as a seed treatment in minimum-tillage
situations,'' Hagin said. ``We might be able to get the crop plants
to take this material up as a defense against slug attacks.''
   Hagin accidentally discovered the quackgrass connection in 1981
after he had used herbicides to get rid of weeds before he planted
no-till corn on land where red clover had been raised.
   ``When the corn was about six inches tall, I noticed that slugs
were attacking it heavily,'' he said. ``But there were little
islands in the field where quackgrass had been growing with the
clover, and in those areas the slugs weren't attacking the corn at
all.''
   Quackgrass is known to leave two ``allelopathic'' chemical
compounds behind in the soil that inhibit the growth of certain
other plants. But those are different from the compound that kills
the slugs, Hagin said.

   Snow cover helped protect winter wheat from
the arctic blasts that ripped across the Great Plains into the
fruit and vegetable areas of Florida and Texas, says the
government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility.
   ``Cold temperatures and lack of moisture stressed winter wheat
in Oklahoma and Texas,'' the facility said Wednesday in its report.
``The extent of the freeze damage was still unknown.''
   The report covered the week of Dec. 18-24 and noted that ``a
brutal blast of arctic air'' tumbled temperatures to record lows in
many areas.
   Below-normal readings in major citrus and vegetable areas of
Florida and Texas caused widespread damage, although losses have
not been fully determined, the report said.
   The facility is operated jointly by the departments of
Agriculture and Commerce. Weekly reports cover general crop
conditions but do not include production forecasts.
   Besides destroying undetermined quantities of citrus and
vegetables, the sub-normal readings slowed the peanut harvest in
south Texas, although 97 percent had been completed by the end of
the week.
   ``In the Rio Grande Valley, freeze damage to sugar cane was
expected to be light to moderate,'' the report said. ``In Florida,
sugar cane suffered some freeze damage but the extent was unknown.
In Louisiana, sugar cane harvest was slowed by cold temperatures.''
   The severe cold put stress on cattle and other livestock
throughout the Great Plains, Corn Belt, Delta and the Southeast,
the report said.

   John M. Beshoar, U.S. agricultural counselor in Brussels, said
Belgian consumers are ``beginning to develop a taste'' for yogurt.
One company introduced the frozen product in early 1989 with four
flavors: exotic fruits, strawberry, raspberry and vanilla.
   ``Because many consumers are unfamiliar with the new dessert,
the company is developing a new product _ a mixture of ice cream
and yogurt _ to encourage more consumers to try it,'' he said. ``If
this product is successful, it could pave the way for similar
frozen dairy treats.''

   The South Lebanon Army, created by Israel
to help guard its border, has honed its fighting skills and
expanded in size. But there is no sign Israel is ready to withdraw
from southern Lebanon and leave the fighting to its allies.
   On Tuesday, Israeli ground and air attacks wiped out two
guerrilla bases of the Communist Party in central and southern
Lebanon in the largest such action in a year. Thirteen people were
reported killed.
   With Israeli advisers and reporters watching, the SLA recently
showed off its gunnery prowess in a live-fire exercise with a dozen
Soviet T-55 tanks captured by the Israelis from the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Gun barrels flashed and the aging tanks, painted gray, knocked
out rusty trucks on a hillside nearly a half-mile away.
   The Lebanese crews, silhouetted on a ridgeline, could be seen
jumping and waving their arms with delight.
   The exercise, Israeli advisers stressed, marked a significant
improvement in the military capabilities of the militia that helps
Israeli troops patrol a security zone that is 2.5 to 12 miles deep
just north of Israel's border.
   However, some observers see a major problem with the militia's
reliability and discipline.
   The SLA has caused Israel political embarrassment by getting
involved in shooting incidents with the nine-nation, 5,700-member
United Nations peackeeping force that patrols north of the security
zone.
   It also has stirred up anti-Israeli sentiment with
indiscriminate shellings of Shiite Moslem villages.
   The SLA commander, Antoine Lahad, 62, a retired Lebanese army
general, told reporters his force made a ``lot of improvement''
since Israel withdrew the bulk of its troops from Lebanon in 1985.
   ``The SLA was more like a militia. Now it has developed into a
small regular army,'' he said, adding the force numbered 3,000 men,
up from 2,000 a year ago, and may expand further.
   Lahad, who survived a communist-inspired assassination attempt
in November 1988, said an Israeli presence was needed until Syria
withdrew its 40,000 troops from Lebanon.
   ``The day we face Lebanese opponents only, we can do without the
backing of the Israeli army,'' said Lahad, a Christian whose
militia controls an area with a predominantly Shiite Moslem
population of 200,000.
   Israel has stationed troops in Lebanon since shortly after
Lebanon's civil war began in 1975.
   Col. Renaan Gissin, deputy spokesman for the Israeli army, said
Israel had no plans to leave but also had no interest in Lebanon
beyond protecting its 60-mile border.
   He added that the zone had proved a success because life in
northern Israel was normal and no Israeli civilian had died in an
attack from Lebanon since 1985.
   The SLA's reliability remains a major question mark, however.
   In recent years, the Christian-led force was riddled with
defections by Shiites, had its positions overrun by Iranian-backed
Hezbollah guerrillas and proved unable to stop Palestinian
infiltrations into the security zone.
   The SLA has also borne the brunt of Shiite and Palestinian
attacks, suffering 188 killed and 600 wounded in the past four
years. So far this year, the SLA came under 350 guerrilla attacks,
about half the level of the previous year.
   Despite the improvements, some experts are less confident of the
SLA's ability to restrain its militiamen from exacting revenge and
say the force is incapable of standing up to guerrilla attacks
without Israeli troops, estimated by foreign reports to number at
least 1,000.
   ``The SLA will hold on as long as Israeli army is the backbone.
Discipline is good as long as Israeli officers are there,'' said
Yoram Hamizrachi, a retired colonel who was in charge of training
the SLA from 1977 to 1980.
   ``They are improving in military skills. They can read maps and
coordinate their actions. But they have a tendency to lose their
tempers. I wouldn't trust them in anything major.''
   In early December, for example, SLA gunners retaliated for the
ambush killing of three SLA militiamen by firing sporadic barrages
at civilian areas north of the security zone. Lebanese reports said
nine civilians were killed in the Shiite town of Nabatiyeh.
   The Shiite leader, Nabih Berri, responded with a warning that
his Amal militiamen would shell Israeli settlements if the SLA
attacks persisted.
   Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled, Israel's northern front commander,
conceded in a recent interview that he had frequent arguments with
SLA commanders about the use of force.
   He said that it was normal for Lebanese militias to fire 100 to
300 shells into a small village.
   Peled said it was ``quite difficult'' to get the SLA to
understand Israel's objections but ``during the past two or three
years we succeeded to change their behavior. I don't know if it
will go back the way it was, but there has been a tremendous
change.''

   A factory propane tank exploded
Wednesday, shooting a huge plume of smoke and fire into the sky and
forcing fire and emergency crews to retreat from the blaze after
evacuating about 3,500 people.
   No injuries were reported at White-Rodgers Co. when the tank
exploded shortly before 4 p.m. Workers were evacuated and people
who live within a 1{ miles were ordered from their homes, said Dale
Rust of the Independence County Office of Emergency Services.
   ``It is the most thickly populated area of the city,'' said Rust.
   Independence County Sheriff David Hunter said there had been
some reports of burglaries in the evacuated area. Rust said 10
state troopers were being sent to the city to help control looting.
   ``We're having people ripping us off out here,'' Hunter said.
   Two hours after the blast, firefighters were pumping water on
the burning tank and about a half-dozen others that are mostly
surrounded by a fire wall in an area separate from the main plant
building, Rust said.
   The evacuation area was expanded to a radius of 1{ miles from
the fire after 7 p.m. Police placed road blocks around the area,
said Faye England, a dispatcher at the Batesville Police Department.
   ``It should burn itself out ... if it doesn't rupture and
explode before then,'' Rust said. ``We're trying to keep the tanks
cool to keep them from rupturing.''
   At 9 p.m., officials withdrew emergency workers and eight
firefighters from the fire scene after gas was detected in the air
around the fire. The firefighters left untended nozzles playing
streams of water onto the fire.
   There was no immediate word on when the emergency workers would
be allowed back into the fire scene.
   The plant, a division of Emerson Electric, manufactures water
heater and gas controls and employs about 1,000 people.
   County Judge David Wyatt said about 3,500 people were removed
from the area around the plant.
   About 12,000 gallons of propane is contained in 14
interconnected tanks at the plant, which could cause damage within
a mile if it all exploded, Rust said.
   Rust estimated that the fire was burning up about 500 gallons of
propane an hour.
   In addition, the tank is burning from both a safety valve at its
top and a leak at its base, adding to the risk of an explosion,
Rust said. The lower fire could boost temperatures and pressure in
the tank, he said.
   Ambulances were used to evacuate residents of the 121-bed
Wood-Lawn Nursing Home, and emergency officials drove through some
neighborhoods using loudspeakers to urge residents to leave their
homes.
   The nursing home patients were evacuated to a Methodist church,
and other churches opened to accommodate people forced from their
homes, Rust said.
   Ross Jones, who was at a nearby store when the blast occurred at
mid-afternoon, said he witnessed ``both vibrations and something we
heard,'' then saw smoke rising into the air.
   Jones said he heard a second blast about 10 minutes later and
saw a second plume of smoke. He said he drove by the plant and saw
the blaze and heard ``a roar like jet engines,'' apparently the
noise of pressurized propane gas escaping from the tank.
   Rust said officials had no idea what caused the tank to rupture
and explosion. An investigation would begin when the fire was
brought under control, ``but we're not worrying about that right
now.''

<HEAD>Congressional Report Urges Tax Hikes, Spending Cuts to Cut Deficit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As a new decade begins, President Bush and
Congress must find a way to raise taxes and cut spending to solve
the country's most pressing economic problem _ the huge federal
budget deficit, a congressional study concluded today.
   Efforts to attack the deficit thus far have relied heavily on
budgetary gimmicks, according to the study by the staff of the
congressional Joint Economic Committee.
   ``The economic policies of the 1980s have not prepared us for a
brighter future,'' said committee chairman Rep. Lee Hamilton, who
directed preparation of the new report. ``We need new polices for
the 1990s.''
   The study offered a somewhat bleak assessment of U.S. economic
prospects, contending the United States must do more to boost
savings, increase investment and spur gains in productivity if it
intends to compete internationally in the 1990s.
   Eliminating the budget deficit, which totaled $152.1 billion in
the fiscal year that ended in September, is the country's top
economic priority, Hamilton said.
   The study said it would be impossible to reduce the budget
deficit without tax increases to accompany spending cuts, a
conclusion Bush has repeatedly rejected.
   His administration is putting the finishing touches on a $1.23
trillion budget proposal for next year which will meet the
Gramm-Rudman target of reducing the deficit to $64 billion without
raising income taxes.
   But the study said Bush's efforts to rely on rosy economic
forecasts and squeezing savings out of already strapped government
programs would prove as unsuccessful for him as it did for
President Reagan.
   A tax increase alone would not be politically acceptable and
therefore it should be part of a package deal including cuts in
spending and a moderate increase in taxes, the report said. It said
the needed revenue could be raised without increasing income tax
rates, which are currently at 15 percent, 28 percent and 33 percent
for individuals. The study, however, did not offer suggestions on
where taxes should be raised.
   Among other findings in the report:
   _Short-term economic growth prospects are weak with the economy
expected to grow at a sluggish pace even if it manages to avoid a
recession in 1990.
   _Attempts to boost America's trade performance have stalled with
the trade deficit expected to remain at more than $100 billion per
year. This unacceptably high level will unleash renewed calls for
the erection of protectionist trade barriers.
   _The problems plaguing the United States in the 1990s are a
direct result of an imbalance between fiscal and monetary policies
throughout most of the past decade. The Reagan administration
pursued a stimulative fiscal policy through tax cuts and big
deficits while the Federal Reserve was keeping monetary policy
tight with high interest rates. The study called this combination
of large budget deficits and high interest rates the ``worst
preparation'' the country could have made for trying to compete
internationally.
   The report devoted an entire chapter to suggestions on how the
country can reduce its huge trade imbalance, but it warned,
``Reaching trade balance will be difficult and painful. We must
change not only our own practices, but also those of other nations
and of the international trade and financial systems.''
   It said efforts to boost the savings rate were essential as a
way of reducing Americans' appetite for foreign goods and providing
a larger investment pool needed to modernize U.S. industry.
   It called for international organizations such as the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to devote more
efforts to resolving the Third Word debt crisis, which has severely
limited U.S. export opportunities in Latin America.

   Repairs are being made at a Jewish
secondary school in this Washington suburb, which was ransacked by
vandals in a ``hate-violence incident'' while it was closed for
Hanukkah, officials say.
   Police said the 12-room school, Yeshiva of Greater Washington,
apparently was invaded late Tuesday, the fifth night of the Jewish
festival of Hanukkah.
   Lockers were ransacked, ceiling panels ripped out, windows and
doors smashed and books strewn all over the floors.
   The school, which has 85 students in grades 7 through 12, was
closed this week, and officials said they were not sure they could
make repairs in time to re-open on Tuesday.
   ``Driving here, I was prepared for the worst,'' said Rabbi Zev
Katz, assistant principal. ``But this goes beyond anything I could
prepare myself for.''
   The vandalism was classified as a ``hate-violence incident''
because of messages left by the vandals, officials said. The word
``Satan'' was written in chalk on the blackboard of one classroom.
In the hallway, across six lockers, the words ``Roman Catholics
rule'' were scribbled.
   In 1977, when the school was located in a different building
nearby, the building was defaced with swastikas, anti-Semitic
slogans and obscenities, and later was damaged by arson.
   The school is located in the Kemp Mill neighborhood, where many
Orthodox Jews live and which was the target of burglaries and
vandalism last summer. After those incidents, about 300 residents
of the neighborhood sought aid from Montgomery County police.
   However, police said they believe the incidents were isolated
and not the work of any organized group.
   In one incident, swastikas were painted on cars; in another
anti-Semitic act, epithets were painted on a sidewalk.
   Jerry Pasternak, president of the Kemp Mill Civic Association,
said residents were pleased with increased police patrols and there
had been no incidents since September.

<HEAD>Organized Crime Strike Forces Will Be Disbanded on Jan. 1</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh says a
restructuring of the Justice Department's organized crime strike
forces will enhance efforts against both traditional organized
crime families and new organized crime elements.
   Starting Jan. 1, the Justice Department's 14 strike forces will
be folded into 23 U.S. attorneys offices across the country,
Thornburgh said Wednesday in announcing plans to proceed with the
reorganization, despite some congressional claims the move is
unwarranted.
   He defended the reorganization, which had been revealed
previously, on the grounds that traditional organized crime run by
Mafia families has changed, with the mob often working in tandem
with Colombian drug cartels and others.
   Moreover, organized crime is also operated by elements in the
Asian community and gangs ``such as the Crips and Bloods and the
Jamaican posses,'' he said.

   The Army has set up a 24-hour operation to
screen the flood of offers it's had from volunteers who want to go
to Panama and help restore battered public services.
   So many have volunteered, spokesman Maj. Henry Fitts said
Wednesday, that he's been unable to get a count.
   The Pentagon already has dispatched 25 reserve civil affairs
specialists along with 107 active duty experts to Panama.
   Civil affairs specialists act as liaison officers between the
military and the civilian government to help re-establish public
services disrupted by fighting, such as utilities and
transportation.
   Virtually all the Army's civil affairs specialists are in
reserve units, and the Pentagon paged those units for volunteers,
said Fitts, a spokesman at the U.S. Army Reserve Special Operations
Command at Fort Bragg, N.C.
   The Army particularly sought specialists, such as engineers or
people familiar with transit systems or sanitation programs.

   Mexican officials are denying U.S. allegations
that its territory has been used by Cuba to transport weapons to
leftist rebels in El Salvador.
   An official Mexican source on Wednesday rejected the allegation
``categorically'' because Mexico has built up a ``surveillance
infrastructure'' to avoid use of its territory for such purchases.
   U.S. officials have said that there are strong indications that
Cuban-supplied weaponry is being sent to the Salvadoran rebels via
a remote route that begins in the Yucatan Peninsula.
   The Mexican source, asking not to be identified, called the
statements by the U.S. officials ``irresponsible, lacking in

<TEXT>
   Hunting deaths in Maine aren't unusual _
two generations ago the state recorded 15-plus a year. But the lone
death last season has ignited a debate greater than all the rest
combined.
   The accidental shooting of Karen Wood in the trees behind her
home struck a raw nerve in a state where tens of thousands pour
into the woods when deer season opens each autumn.
   More than a year later, the death of the 37-year-old mother of
year-old twin daughters remains a focus of wrangling between
hunters and non-hunters.
   The case sparked arguments over the adequacy of the state's
hunting regulations and raised questions about the criminal justice
system after the grand jury that first heard the evidence declined
to hand up an indictment.
   A second grand jury this month returned a manslaughter
indictment against Donald Rogerson, the Bangor man who admitted
shooting Mrs. Wood when he mistook her for a deer while hunting in
woods in the Bangor suburb of Hermon.
   The 45-year-old Rogerson, a supermarket produce manager, has
pleaded innocent and remains free on his own recognizance while
awaiting trial. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison.
   The case prompted some people to call for tighter restrictions
on hunting near homes. The current law forbids shooting within 300
feet of an occupied residence.
   But others suggested Mrs. Wood should have worn bright clothing,
like the fluorescent orange garb required of hunters, before
venturing into the woods during deer season. Some faulted her for
wearing white mittens that could have been mistaken for the
underside of a deer's tail.
   The head of the state Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Department
notes the uproar comes at a time when state safety programs have
reduced hunting deaths to their lowest level in history, even
though more hunters are in the woods than ever.
   ``The public has been somewhat tolerant over the years of
hunters shooting other hunters,'' said Commissioner William J.
Vail, noting that hunters assume some risk whenever they go into
the field. ``This particular case involved a non-participant,
someone who was not hunting, and I think that was at the root of
the outrage.''
   Mrs. Wood, who had just moved to the area from Iowa that summer,
was shot in the chest the afternoon of Nov. 15, 1988, while she
stood amid some hardwoods behind her home in a new residential
subdivision.
   Rogerson was arrested that evening and charged with
manslaughter. But the charge was dropped the following month after
the grand jury concluded that his actions were neither criminally
negligent nor criminally reckless.
   Vail bristles at the suggestion Mrs. Wood may unknowingly have
contributed to her death.
   ``That sort of criticism is outrageous,'' he said. ``Hunters are
required to wear fluorescent orange. Non-hunters are not, and there
are literally thousands of people who live and work in the Maine
woods in November who do not wear it.''
   While anyone in Maine during that time of year should be aware
that deer season is on, Vail said, ``the responsibility is clearly
with the hunter to make sure of his target before firing.''
   Stephen Duren, executive director of the Sportsman's Alliance of
Maine, said he believes Rogerson bore some blame for the killing.
   ``There must have been some violation of the hunter safety code
that you be certain of your target,'' Duren said. ``The hunter
knows very plainly what Don Rogerson should have done and failed to
do.''
   A year after Mrs. Wood was shot, the Legislature rejected an
attempt to increase the 300-foot restriction on firearms
discharges. Fish and game officials opposed the change, saying the
current law was adequate.
   A wrongful death lawsuit by Mrs. Wood's husband against Rogerson
was settled for $122,000, most of it covered by Rogerson's
homeowners' insurance. Rogerson also agreed he wouldn't seek a new
hunting license, according to his lawyer, Lewis Vafiades, who said
his client doesn't want to resume the sport.
   Rogerson has declined to talk to reporters.
   Mrs. Wood's husband, Kevin, a pediatric psychologist who has
since moved back to Iowa with his daughters, said he was encouraged
by the indictment and believes that the grand jury had reached
``the only decision logic and reason would allow.''

<HEAD>`I Love Lucy' Still Pulls In an Audience After 33 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of Americans are still saying, ``I
Love Lucy.''
   A 33-year-old Christmas special from the 1950s sitcom finished
sixth in the latest Nielsen ratings.
   The black-and-white episode, which hadn't been seen on
television since Dec. 24, 1956, was CBS' highest-rated show of the
week and helped propel the network to its second straight
second-place finish in the ratings.
   Miss Ball, who died in April at age 77, starred in one of
television's most popular shows through much of the 1950s. The
``Lucy'' special starred Miss Ball, Desi Arnaz, Vivian Vance,
William Frawley and Richard Keith as Little Ricky.
   NBC's ``Cheers'' was the top-rated show of the week ended Dec.
24. ABC's ``Roseanne'' was second.
   CBS beat out ABC for second place without much help from its
usual Top 10 shows, ``60 Minutes'' and ``Murder, She Wrote,'' both
of which finished far down the list.
   Fox Broadcasting Co.'s ``Married ... With Children'' plummeted
in the ratings to 72nd place after its Christmas special reached
13th.
   NBC was first in the A.C. Nielsen Co. survey with an average of
12.8. CBS was next with 11.7, and ABC scored 11.3. The ratings
represent the percentage of the nation's 92.1 million households
tuned to a show.
   For the season to date, NBC leads with 14.8; ABC follows with
13.1 and CBS with 12.2.
   The Top 10: NBC's ``Cheers,'' ABC's ``Roseanne,'' NBC's ``Dear
John,'' NBC's ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC's ``A Different World,'' CBS'
``I Love Lucy'' Christmas special, ABC's NFL Monday Night Football
(Philadelphia vs. New Orleans), NBC's ``L.A. Law,'' and a tie
between NBC's ``Heat of the Night'' and CBS' ``Murphy Brown.''
   Other than the ``Lucy'' show, it was a ``bah, humbug'' week for
Christmas specials.
   CBS' ``Frosty the Snowman'' was 20th, CBS' ``A Very Brady
Christmas'' was 21st, CBS' ``Charlie Brown Christmas'' tied for
29th, CBS' ``Claymation Christmas'' tied for 41st, NBC's
``Christmas in Washington'' tied for 55th and CBS' ``A Christmas
Carol'' tied for 61st.
   The ABC movie ``Santa Claus: The Movie'' was 63rd and the CBS
telecast of ``The Christmas Gift,'' the pilot movie for ``The
Waltons,'' tied for 64th. ABC's ``Julie Andrews: The Sound of
Christmas,'' tied for 69th, NBC's ``Magical World of Disney: A
Muppet Family Christmas'' was 73rd and Fox's ``Simpsons
Christmas,'' repeated from the week before, was 74th.
   It was a big week in news, however, with the American invasion
of Panama and the revolution in Romania. ABC's ``World News
Tonight,'' first for the 12th week, got its highest rating since
the week ended Feb. 3. ABC led with 11.8; CBS scored an 11.0 and
NBC 10.8.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar inched up against the yen Thursday,
while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed at another
record high.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues added 75.31
points, or 0.19 percent, to close at 38,876.94 points. It had
gained 120.32 points Wednesday and closed at the previous record
high of 38,801.63.
   The dollar closed at 142.15 yen, up 0.05 yen from Wednesday's
finish of 142.10 yen. After opening at 142.00 yen, the dollar
ranged between 141.99 yen and 142.17 yen.
   Currency dealers said the dollar remained in a narrow range in
thin trading, normal for a holiday season.
   A dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, who spoke anonymously, said the
dollar should move lower early next year in anticipation of a
further decline in U.S. interest rates, which have been speculated
about in recent weeks.
   Lower interest rates tend to erode the value of a nation's
currency.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index lost its earlier gains,
with profit-taking selling in midmorning outpacing small-lot buying
during early trading, securities dealers said. The index had gained
65.01 points shortly after the market opened.
   ``The index was pushed back by profit-taking, small-lot selling,
by institutional investors,'' said Nomura Securities' Toshinao
Nakamura.
   Other dealers said some investors retreated to the sidelines
ahead of the New Year's holiday.

   Lysa Biffle was nine months pregnant and hoping
for a boy. Ebony Williams was looking forward to college.
   Their fates became linked in the final moments of Christmas
night, when both women were shot and mortally wounded by random
shots apparently fired by drug dealers in a turf battle over a
housing project's cocaine trade.
   ``These people happened to be in the wrong spot,'' said police
Lt. Eugene Dunbar.
   But the randomness of the shootings has shocked residents of the
Queens housing project. They now must fear being the target of drug
dealers who Dunbar believes had no other purpose than ``flexing
their muscles'' in the neighborhood.
   ``That's the horror of the whole thing,'' said state
Assemblywoman Barbara Clark, whose district includes the South
Jamaica Houses project. ``I'm ready to call out the National Guard
to stand around the project and defend people against these
drive-by shootings.''
   Miss Williams, 18, who planned to attend nearby York College
next fall, lived with her mother in another section of the
neighborhood. She had eaten Christmas dinner at her grandmother's
house and was meeting friends who lived at the project. The friends
had planned to see a movie.
   The teen-ager and a friend were making a call at a corner pay
phone when the bullets struck her twice in the head at 11:50 p.m.
Monday, killing her instantly.
   Witnesses told police three or four men in a Toyota Camry then
coasted about 200 feet and pulled up next to Mrs. Biffle, her
husband, Dwayne, 25, and his brother, Vincent, as they were getting
into their car after visiting a relative.
   The gunmen fired several shots into the Biffles' car before
speeding off.
   Mrs. Biffle, 26, was shot once in the back, with the bullet
striking her aorta, spleen, pancreas and colon, but missing the
fetus. Her husband was shot once in the left foot, police and
hospital officials said.
   The Biffles were taken to a hospital where doctors delivered a
healthy 6-pound, 7-ounce son by Caesarean section.
   Mrs. Biffle died Tuesday. Her husband and son were reported in
good condition at the hospital.
   ``This is a tragedy compounded to an infinite degree,'' said
Benjamin Suckewer, a partner at the Manhattan law firm of Dreyer &amp;
Traub, where Mrs. Biffle worked as his secretary. ``Along with her
love of her family there always shined through an incredible
faith.''
   He said that when she had a spare moment she would study
Scriptures at her desk.
   Her co-workers, who gave the expectant mother a baby shower last
week, were waiting for her funeral plans to be announced. The law
firm is helping co-workers set up a fund for her son.
   The South Jamaica neighborhood that surrounds the
1,047-apartment project has been the scene of violent clashes by
gangs fighting to gain control of the drug turf left by the 1988
arrests of Howard ``Pappy'' Mason and Lorenzo ``Fat Cat'' Nichols.
   Mason was convicted of racketeering, as well as ordering the
February 1988 murder of Police Officer Edward Byrne. The rookie
officer was fatally shot as he sat in a marked patrol car guarding
the home of a witness in a drug case. Nichols also is imprisoned on
murder and drug charges.
   Dunbar said it is not unusual for drug dealers in the area to
fire at people ``to get a message across to other drug dealers that
someone else is moving in.'' He said during the past year there
have been three other similar shootings in the South Jamaica area.
   ``In the last couple of months there have been at least six
murders in and around the project,'' Ms. Clark said. ``It's just
become unreal.''
   The assemblywoman said she met with Mayor-elect David Dinkins on
Wednesday to demand ``the same kind of response we had when Officer
Byrne was killed, because so far, nothing has happened.''

<HEAD>Study: Birth Centers Safe Alternative for Many Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many women can opt for the homey surroundings of
birth centers instead of hospital obstetrical wards without undue
risk to themselves or their babies, said a study published today.
   ``Normal birth ought not be considered a sickness requiring
hospitalization,'' said Dr. Allan Rosenfield, a co-author of the
study.
   The study found that women who were at low risk of complications
do just as well in birth centers that are located outside hospitals
as they do having babies in hospitals, and they are far less likely
to have Caesarean sections.
   Rosenfield, an obstetrician who is dean of Columbia University's
School of Public Health, said that ``properly screened, this is a
reasonable alternative to a hospital delivery for women who prefer
it.''
   The study, based on nearly 12,000 childbirths, was intended to
answer lingering doubts about the safety of birth centers.
   Despite the positive findings, however, some physicians remained
skeptical.
   In an editorial published with the findings in today's New
England Journal of Medicine, Drs. Ellice Lieberman and Kenneth J.
Ryan of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston said that more
research will be necessary ``to evaluate fully the safety of
delivery in free-standing facilities.''
   The Boston doctors criticized the study because it failed to
include all the birth centers in the United States or to enroll a
comparison group of women who gave birth in hospitals.
   They said that birth centers should be located inside hospitals,
which have the emergency equipment needed to deal with rare,
unexpected complications.
   ``Hospital-based birth centers combine the best of both
facilities by offering the atmosphere of a birth center without
sacrificing the safety of a hospital,'' they wrote.
   Presently, 132 free-standing birth centers operate in the United
States and deliver about 20,000 babies annually. Typically, women
are assisted by midwives rather than physicians.
   The study was organized by the National Association of
Childbearing Centers and directed by Judith P. Rooks, a
nurse-midwife at Columbia.
   ``The whole idea is to make it like women's homes and to give
them the control they want over their childbirth experience,'' said
Eunice K.M. Ernst, the association's director. ``We take the
position that birth is a family event, and for the majority of
women it's a normal event in their lives.
   ``It's true that it can become complicated and require medical
intervention. But women have the right to consider it normal until
proven otherwise.''
   Ernst noted that birth centers cost one-third to one-half less
than hospital deliveries.
   The study was based on the experiences of all 11,814 women who
used 84 of these centers over a 2{-year period. They were typically
white, middle-class and well educated.
   Among the findings:
   _71 percent had only minor or no complications during childbirth.
   _8 percent had serious emergency complications, and 1 in 6 had
to be transferred to hospitals.
   _No women died. The newborn death rate was 1.3 per 1,000 births.
The rate of infant deaths and abnormalities was similar to that
seen in large studies of low-risk hospital births.
   _4 percent of the women had Caesarean sections. Nationally,
about 25 percent of women deliver their babies surgically.
   _99 percent of those who gave birth in the birth centers said
they would recommend the the centers to friends, as would 97
percent of those who were transferred to hospitals.
   Safety has been the primary concern about birth centers. The
American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists have discouraged their use until
better data are available.
   Questions were also raised by an Institute of Medicine review in
1982. The latest research was intended to answer these concerns.
   ``We did the study because we really wanted to know if birth
centers were safe,'' said Rooks. ``We looked very carefully and
hard. We did not find an excessive incidence of poor outcomes from
these birth centers.''

   A suspected burglar was killed after setting
off a booby trap rigged by a homeowner who complained of frequent
break-ins.
   Police said Wednesday that 37-year-old Leroy (or Lee Roy)
Woodard of Mobile was shot in the neck and killed about 11:30 p.m.
Tuesday when he stepped into a trap laid by the homeowner.
   Police spokesman Tom Jennings said the booby trap included two
hunting rifles in separate locations, one pointing down a
staircase. He said one rifle fired when Woodard stepped on a wire
rigged to the rifle trigger.
   The homeowner, 29-year-old Mark McClammy, was questioned and
released. But Jennings said the case would be presented to a county
grand jury.
   Joy Patterson, a spokeswoman for the state attorney general,
said, ``It's illegal to take a life to protect property, but it
could be legal where someone is defending their own life or someone
else's life.''
   McClammy told police he lived alone in the house that was under
renovation. He said he was in Mississippi when the shooting
occurred.
   A neighbor called McClammy and told him he had heard a shot from
inside the house. McClammy and the neighbor went inside and found
the man on the floor at the foot of the stairwell.
   Woodard had three prior arrests, Jennings said.
   James Miller, who has lived in the downtown neighorhood for 26
years, said he has a burglar alarm, but would not rig a booby trap.
   ``That sounds like a cruel thing to do,'' Miller said.
   But a woman who owns a store near the house said the
neighborhood has a problem with burglaries.
   ``I'm glad it happened,'' said the woman, who spoke on condition
of anonymity. ``People break into places out here all the time.''

<TEXT>
   Felicidad Pena de Navarro's
supermarket cart overflowed with canned goods, rice, sugar and
other non-perishables as she shopped for the first time following
the U.S. invasion.
   But the housewife was not only concerned with serving her family
dinner Wednesday night. She was shopping ahead in case of more
turmoil, which in recent years has engulfed Panama often and with
little warning.
   ``We're going to put this away and not touch it, put it away for
the next time,'' Mrs. Pena de Navarro said.
   She and others lined up outside the Gago supermarket, one of the
few that reopened because it hadn't been looted following the U.S.
invasion that toppled Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``This time it hit us at night,'' Mrs. Pena de Navarro said of
the Dec. 19-20 military assault.
   ``I was going to go shopping the next day and my husband said I
was an idiot, why didn't I think ahead. Well look, now I'm thinking
ahead,'' said Mrs. Pena.
   A battalion of stock clerks raced to pile foods on shelves
faster than shoppers could pull them off. Trucks rolled up with
fresh vegetables and milk, unseen here in recent days.
   A group of U.S. soldiers in combat gear mingled with the
shoppers to buy cartons of juice or soft drinks and to pose with
shoppers who wanted their pictures taken.
   Store employees gleefully waved them to the head of the long
checkout lines, where they deposited hefty tips on the bewildered
bagboy who sacked up their orders.
   Hundreds of stores hit by looters were left bare of items from
food to furniture, and even cars were stolen from dealerships.
   Looters tended to favor jewelry shops, camera stores and
electronics such as stereos and television sets. Bookstores were
not bothered.
   While most Panamanians live fairly well by regional standards,
it still is a country where aspirin tablets and cigarettes often
are sold one at a time.
   The small open-air markets that sell everything from soup to
soap are concentrated in the poorer areas of the capital where the
fighting was heaviest, and are just beginning to reopen with scant
merchandise.
   Produce is starting to arrive from the countryside but shipments
are being slowed by a gasoline shortage.
   Earlier this week, large piles of produce reportedly were
rotting in rural areas because there was no way to get the food to
market or to refrigerated storage.

<HEAD>Police Try to Link Admitted Rapist to Unsolved Murders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MELBOURNE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man dubbed the ``vampire rapist'' and
now serving a 25-year prison sentence may be released by 1992
unless police succeed in linking him to six unsolved slayings, a
prosecutor says.
   ``We will continue to work these cases as hard as we can'' in
hopes of bringing murder charges against prison inmate John
Crutchley, said State Attorney Norm Wolfinger.
   Crutchley pleaded guilty in 1986 to kidnapping and raping a
19-year-old woman who said her assailant called himself a vampire
and drained blood from her arms and legs through needles, drinking
some of it.
   In exchange for his guilty plea, prosecutors dropped several
charges, including the unusual count of robbery for taking nearly
half the woman's blood.
   Doctors said the woman would have died if she hadn't escaped
through a window in a locked bathroom while Crutchley, a former
Harris Corp. engineer, was at work.
   Wolfinger commented on the six unsolved murder cases this week
after Crutchley's former lawyer, Joe Mitchell, disclosed that he
tried to begin plea negotiations on the deaths in 1986.
   Crutchley would have admitted to some of the 1985 slayings and
taken investigators the victims' burial sites, Mitchell said. But
the negotiations fell through because prosecutors lacked evidence
linking him to any of the killings.
   ``He was going to admit to from three to six murders, but the
negotiations never got off the ground,'' Mitchell said.
   Crutchley, who blamed pornography for his obsession with bizarre
sexual rituals, refused through prison officials to be interviewed.
   Wolfinger said Tuesday that ``very informal'' negotiations never
reached a point at which Crutchley would have pleaded guilty to
murder.
   ``There comes a point in the negotiations when the state has to
show something,'' the prosecutor said. ``If we had had anything to
tie a charge to, we would have done it. But we had nothing.''
   Police said they have long suspected Crutchley in the unsolved
deaths in Brevard County. Although he is serving a long sentence,
he may be eligible for early release within three years because of
time earned behind bars, officials said.
   Investigators are looking for evidence in the deaths of five
victims whose bodies were discovered in 1985 and the disappearance
of another woman.

<HEAD>Stocks At Another Record High, Dollar Inches Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading index closed at
a record high for the third consecutive day today, while the dollar
inched up against the Japanese yen after a five-day decline.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed up 75.31
points, or 0.19 percent, at 38,876.94. The index has gained 453.32,
or 1.18 percent, in the last three days.
   The dollar closed at 142.15 yen, up 0.05 yen from Wednesday's
finish of 142.10 yen. After opening at 142.00 yen, the dollar
ranged between 141.99 yen and 142.17 yen. It had declined a total
of 2.13 yen in the previous five trading days.
   The key stock index fell moderately in today's early trading,
with profit-taking selling outpacing small-lot buying. But the
index rebounded in the afternoon on buying by investment trust
funds, said Nomura Securities dealer Toshinao Nakamura.
   With most institutional and corporate investors on the sidelines
ahead of the New Year's holidays, trading generally was slow and
quiet, other dealers said.
   With no focus to trading, investors might have left for the
holidays without waiting for Friday's session, the last of the
year, they said.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at a small 550 million
shares, down from 930 million Wednesday.
   Currency dealers said the dollar remained in a narrow range in
thin trading, a usual trend toward the year-end.
   A dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the dollar would move lower early next year in
anticipation of a further downswing in U.S. interest rates, the
subject of speculation in recent weeks.
   Lower interest rates tend to make a nation's currency less
attractive to investors.

<HEAD>Homeowners May Be `Landlocked' if Private Road Closed</HEAD>

   Russell Oberman doesn't much care for ``you
can't get there from here'' jokes, ever since a squabble over a
railroad crossing began threatening the only access he and five
other homeowners have to their homes.
   ``We are legally landlocked,'' Oberman, a village police
officer, said Wednesday. ``I can put my truck into four-wheel drive
and drive across some guy's field _ but my wife doesn't have a
four-wheel drive.''
   Oberman and others who live nearby get to their homes by driving
down a narrow gravel road across a set of railroad tracks _ but
there's the rub.
   Detroit-based Grand Trunk Western Railroad Co. has always asked
the road's residents to sign an agreement stating they will not
hold the railroad liable for any accident at the unmarked crossing.
Residents have done so.
   The railroad also has asked that residents maintain a private
insurance policy to cover any claims filed because of accidents at
the crossing. They've done that, too.
   But after a 1986 accident at the crossing that left three people
dead and resulted in several lawsuits _ one of them against the
insurer _ the insurance company canceled its coverage.
   Residents called a number of insurers, but were unable to secure
new coverage.
   To complicate matters, some residents have decided because of
the lawsuits that they will no longer sign the agreement with the
railroad.
   Oberman said the railroad has threatened to erect barricades to
keep residents from crossing the tracks, but a spokesman for the
railroad said Wednesday that Grand Trunk would like to avoid that.
   ``That's an option they would prefer not to use,'' spokesman
Chuck Ragains said. ``They're not ruling it out, but they prefer
not to use it.''
   Another possible solution: converting the road to a public
thoroughfare, thus shifting liability from the residents. But that,
too, is problematic.
   Village officials say to upgrade the road to make it public,
they must charge residents for at least 40 percent of the
improvements _ at a cost of between $15,000 and $20,000 per
household.
   The railroad is behind it, but residents say they can't afford
it.
   The issue is expected to come up again at next month's Village
Board meeting.

   A Canadian cold front settled southward across the Dakotas,
Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa today, while the East and South
looked for warmer weather and the Great Lakes area braced for more
snow.
   Northeasterly winds were forecast to bring lake-effect snow
showers to the shores of lakes Superior and Michigan. Snow
advisories were called for much of Delaware, Maryland and Virginia
and in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia.
   The Coast Guard and barge operators said warmer weather expected
by Friday could help loosen ice up to 6 inches thick which covered
70 percent to 100 percent of the Allegheny, Monongahela and Ohio
rivers.
   ``The river people I talk to are saying this is the worst (ice)
they've seen since the winter of 1977-78,'' said Coast Guard Cmdr.
Anthony Regalbuto said.
   Frozen pipes and broken water lines continued to plague
residents in areas from the Carolinas to Alabama. Many communities
still report low water pressure or shortages caused by broken mains
and people leaving their faucets running to protect against frozen
pipes during the four-day cold snap.
   Forecasters were predicting some relief for the Carolinas today
_ sunshine, highs in the 50s and lows in the 30s.
   While the cold high pressure system was expected to creep into
the northern tier of states tonight and Friday, low pressure should
spread northward from Texas to the Upper Ohio Valley.
   As the cold front moves south today, snow or freezing rain may
fall on parts of South Dakota and into Minnesota and Wisconsin.
Temperatures north of the front will be in the 20s and 30s. South
of the front, the mercury should range from the 30s in Illinois to
the 50s in Nebraska.
   A weak front is expected to move out and high pressure move over
Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia's eastern panhandle.
Temperatures today in the four-state region should be above
freezing, with the southern areas enjoying highs in the 40s.
   The nation's high on Wednesday was 77 degrees at McAllen, Texas.
   Beckley, W.Va., shattered its coldest reading for the date with
a temperature of zero. The old record of 7 degrees was set 13 years
ago. Beckley also is having its snowiest December on record,
already surpassing the old mark of 24 inches set in 1962.

<TEXT>
   Maverick Communist Boris N. Yeltsin is running for
president of the Soviet Union's largest republic, a Soviet news
service reported today.
   Yeltsin, who won more than 5 million votes in Moscow elections
with his anti-elite stance and calls for more radical reform, has
accepted a nomination to be president of the Russian Federation,
the Interfax news agency said.
   Voters in Ramenki, a town near Moscow, nominated him, said
Interfax, which is affiliated with state-run Radio Moscow.
   Yeltsin was dumped from his job as Moscow Party chief in late
1987 for his outspoken criticism of the slow pace of President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms. He was later given a state post in
construction with the rank of minister.
   The 58-year-old former engineer parlayed his image as a fighter
for justice and victim of the party apparatus into a sweeping
victory in March elections for the Soviet Congress, when he won 89
percent of the Moscow vote.
   At the Congress, Yeltsin has emerged as a leader of the
fledgling opposition to Communist Party leaders and has continued
to push for speedier reform.
   Elections are scheduled for March in the Russian Federation, the
biggest of the Soviet Union's 15 constituent republics with some
150 million people and land stretching from the Baltic Sea to the
Pacific Ocean.
   The nomination process has just begun, and no other prominent
candidates for the presidency have been announced.
   The current Russian Federation president is Vitaly I.
Vorotnikov, the longest-standing member of the ruling Politburo
except Gorbachev.

   State lotteries may create millionaires overnight,
but the newfound wealth brings with it stresses that can make or
break even family ties.
   In two contrasting cases in the past week, a disabled New
Hampshire man gave his brother a lottery ticket worth millions,
while a hospitalized Massachusetts man and his wife lost their
legal battle over winnings they say his sister promised to share.
   ``Even in the most stable families, there's lots of things that
have to be renegotiated when someone gets a lot of money. But
chances are, the problems did exist before,'' said Dr. Lyn
Styczynski, who works at a family counseling center in Boston.
``It's not all a godsend.
   ``It's very stressful, and it's a strange stress, not one we get
a lot of preparation for.''
   The case of Earl and Elwood Havlock was extraordinary, however,
said David R. Ellis, a spokesman for the Massachusetts State
Lottery Commission.
   ``That's very unusual, very, very unusual, and very nice,'' he
said.
   Earl Havlock, who is disabled and unable to work, was buying his
brother a series of lottery tickets for Christmas when he hit a
$8.94 million jackpot.
   The 42-year-old man lives alone in the central New Hampshire
town of Ashland, on his Social Security checks and his brother's
generosity. He said he never considered holding the ticket for
himself, and he handed over the multimillion-dollar present to his
brother without qualms.
   ``Why not?'' Earl Havlock said. ``Ain't goin' back on my word.''
   Earl bought the winning tri-state lottery ticket for northern
New England on Saturday, a few minutes before the drawing.
   Elwood, who makes about $31,000 a year working for the Plymouth
Highway Department, said he plans to quit his job in three weeks.
   As for Earl, Elwood said he would continue to help care for him.
   ``Anything he needs or wants, I get him,'' Elwood said.
   In contrast, the gift of money served to rend the bonds between
Toni Ann Lydon and her sister-in-law, Catherine Beauregard. The
pair ran a beauty salon together until Beauregard and her husband,
Francis, bought a winning ticket in 1985.
   Last week, a Middlesex County Superior Court jury refused to
award Lydon and her husband, Thomas, half of a $2.8 million
Megabucks jackpot the Beauregards won. The jury found that previous
agreements the couples used to split ticket winnings were
unenforceable.
   Lydon and her husband, who is Catherine Beauregard's brother,
said the couples had plans to share the earnings as they had done
before.
   The day before the jury verdict, Thomas Lydon was admitted to
the hospital, his son, Bobby, said Wednesday.
   ``That's our main concern,'' said Bobby Lydon, who would not
comment on whether the family was seeking an appeal of the
decision. He would not comment on his father's illness.
   The Lydons suit said that after the Beauregards bought their
winning ticket, they told the Lydons they would pick them up to
drive to get their checks together. The Beauregards never showed
up, according to court papers.
   Edward Sokoloff, the Lydons' attorney, said the Beauregards
thereafter began denying there had ever been an agreement. He said
they claimed the splitting of previous smaller winnings with the
Lydons was simply a nice gesture on their part.
   Ellis said the Massachusetts State Lottery Commission does not
get involved in such disputes, which are rare.
   ``We cannot be involved in this. How could we get involved?'' he
said. ``We try to give them guidance, but it's up to them to
protect themselves. These are legal, voting-age adults.''

<TEXT>
   A Canada goose caught off-guard by a fast
freeze was trapped by its feet in ice on a pond, and it looks as if
there's little hope of a quick rescue.
   The goose, attended by its mournfully honking mate, caught the
eye of Wayne Wilson as he walked around a pond at Crowders Mountain
State Park. The goose's webbed feet were stuck in about four inches
of ice.
   But his report brought little action Wednesday from wildlife
officials, who preferred to let nature take its course as
temperatures rise at the pond 30 miles west of Charlotte.
   Wayne Smith, head of the Gaston County Animal Control
Department, said goose rescue is out of his jurisdiction.
   ``They're used to this kind of weather,'' he said of the birds.
``They can take care of themselves. Just throw some bread out to
them.''

<TEXT>
   A bomb squad discovered sex and drug
education pamphlets in a suspicious parcel addressed to schools
with the largest black student bodies, officials said.
   ``We classified it as a suspicious package. We have since then
been able to open it. ... It contained harmless sex and drug
education material,'' Maj. Marvin Minor, the deputy police chief,
said Wednesday evening.
   The parcel was addressed to ``the principal of the largest black
high school in Greenville and to the school that had the most black
children,'' said Assistant Superintendent Arthur Peyton.
Greenville's public school system is mostly black.
   After the parcel was discovered Wednesday morning, 105 workers
were evacuated for nearly two hours from the federal building,
which includes the post office. Other buildings in a two-block
radius also were evacuated.
   Police took the padded parcel to a remote area near the
Mississippi River, where they were joined by an explosives handling
team from Pine Bluff, Ark. Agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, FBI and U.S. Marshals Service also were on
the scene.
   ``It just so happened to look like a bomb,'' Minor said. ``It
was sent by some guy from Washington, D.C.''
   Minor identified the man only as ``Rev. Babb.''
   Also Wednesday, authorities in Charlotte, N.C., removed a
package from the porch of state District Judge Bill Constangy's
home and destroyed it, discovering it held only a doll, police said.
   Authorities were investigating whether the incidents were
related to a spate of mail or package bombs directed against
judges, courts, attorneys and civil rights organizations in
Alabama, Georgia, Florida and Maryland.
   Three of those bombs exploded, killing a federal judge in a
Birmingham, Ala., suburb Dec. 16 and a black civil rights attorney
in Savannah, Ga., on Dec. 18. A Hagerstown, Md., judge was wounded
in the third incident last week.

<TEXT>
   The Japanese government said today it was dropping
its inquiry into the U.S. hydrogen bomb lost at sea 24 years ago
off the coast of Japan.
   The U.S. Defense Department had said further queries on the
accident could endanger U.S. military policy.
   ``The Japanese government understands the U.S. position and has
no intention of making further requests of it,'' Kyodo News Service
quoted an unidentified Foreign Ministry official as saying today.
   The case embarrassed both governments _ Japan because it bans
nuclear arms but appeared to have turned a blind eye to passage of
such weapons through its waters, and the United States because its
policy of not commenting on the location of such weapons came under
new scrutiny.
   In 1965, a U.S. Navy A-4 Skyhawk accidentally rolled off the
carrier Ticonderoga bearing a one-megaton H-bomb. The pilot died,
and the bomb sank in waters 16,000 feet deep.
   The incident was kept secret until 1981, when the Navy said it
had occurred 500 miles from land.
   But in May it was disclosed that the bomb had sunk about 80
miles from a Japanese island in the Okinawa group.
   Under pressure from the opposition Socialist Party and other
anti-nuclear groups, the Japanese government insisted that
Washington explain what had happened. Scientists tested the waters
near the site for signs of radioactive pollution from the bomb's 33
pounds of plutonium. No radiation was found, the government said.
   The Pentagon has assured Japan that scientists had conducted
experiments and determined that the bomb had been crushed by water
pressure and its nuclear material would have dissolved. It was not
armed when it went into the sea, the Pentagon said, and it could
not explode.
   Japan is the only country ever attacked with nuclear bombs and
the public is strongly against having them in the country. Japan
bans the introduction of nuclear weapons as a matter of policy but
has not passed a law to that effect.
   The Socialists, who oppose the U.S.-Japan defense treaty, say
the ban should be enforced strictly and accuse the conservative
government of giving tacit approval to the transit of U.S. nuclear
weapons aboard Navy warships that dock in Japan.
   The Japanese queried the United States about the 1965 accident
and the Foreign Affairs Committee of the opposition-dominated upper
house of Parliament said on Dec. 13 the government should ask again
for a U.S. report.
   Pentagon officials met with Japanese diplomats in Washington
Tuesday and said the United States understands Japan's special
concerns about nuclear weapons but cannot disclose anymore about
the accident, a Foreign Ministry official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Kyodo News Service quoted Washington as having said, ``The U.S.
government feels any further discussion on this matter could
compromise our operational policies and have an adverse effect on
our national security interests.''
   Under the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, the United States is
obliged to consult with Japan about bringing nuclear weapons into
Japanese territory. Japanese officials say that since there has
been no consultation, Japan trusts the United States has not
violated the treaty.

<TEXT>
   A poster map of Shreveport that depicts
blacks as roaches being sprayed by a white hand will be recalled,
the head of the local tourism bureau said.
   The poster, a cartoon map of the Shreveport area, shows roaches
in predominantly black neighborhoods being sprayed by a white hand
bearing a can of insecticide. Blacks also are shown as suspects
running from a white judge.
   In the Cedar Grove area, torn by race riots in 1988, a large
gorilla was shown saying ``Yea, we bad!''
   The poster, in the style of humorous promotional maps produced
by booster groups in many cities, was printed by Centennial
Publishing of Lafayette, which sold spots on the map to Shreveport
area businesses.
   It bears the logo of the Shreveport-Bossier Convention and
Tourist Bureau, whose chief, Preston Friedly, promised to have the
posters recalled and burned.
   Friedly apologized to citizens and the City Council Tuesday,
calling the poster ``totally repugnant and in poor taste.''
   The tourist bureau gave the publisher a letter of introduction
to local businesses, but didn't approve the design, Friedly said.
   The artist who designed the poster, former Shreveport resident
Doug Fowler, apologized earlier, explaining he intended to poke fun
at all groups in town.
   The City Council voted unanimously to denounce the poster as
racist.
   Shreveport psychiatrist Strother Dixon was one of those who
complained to the council about the poster.
   ``We have ghosts in Shreveport that are haunting us,'' Dixon
said. ``There are no black businesses represented in the
Shreveport-Bossier area. It tells me that black people and people
of color are non-existent.''
   Councilman Larry Ferdinand said the poster could deter
businesses from investing in the area.
   ``It's not going to help us with Wall Street, with our bond
rating, or to help us get McDonnell Douglas in here,'' Ferdinand
said.

   The crew of a commuter plane didn't indicate
any trouble in communications with the airport control tower just
minutes before the plane crashed, killing all six people aboard, a
federal investigator said.
   United Express Flight 2415 made a normal request to land, and
the tower operator at the Tri-Cities Airport acknowledged, said
Barry Trotter, the National Transportation Safety Board official
leading the investigation.
   ``There were no distress signals. All conversations were normal
two to three minutes before final impact,'' Trotter said of late
Tuesday night's crash.
   The British Aerospace Jetstream 31 slammed into a sagebrush
field short of a runway and burst into flames. The two crew members
and four passengers were killed.
   Trotter said investigators would try to determine whether ice
found at the wreckage site came from a wing of the airplane, a
19-passenger turboprop.
   Craig Belmondo, president of the United Express regional
airline, said it was too early to speculate on the cause of the
crash.
   The flight was en route from Seattle to Pasco via Yakima.
   United Express _ one of several similarly named commuter
airlines around the country _ serves as a feeder to United Airlines
and uses the United logo, but is separately owned.
   Federal investigators arrived in Pasco Wednesday and began
sifting through the wreckage. They planned to interview a tower
official who may have seen the crash, and appealed for any other
witnesses to come forward.
   The plane was built in Prestwick, Scotland in October 1987 and
delivered to United Express in December of that year, Belmondo
said. It had 5,000 hours of flight time when the crash occurred and
was in for its last maintenance inspection on Dec. 20, he said.
   The pilot, Capt. Barry Roberts, 38, had more than 11 years of
regional flying experience, including more than 660 hours in
Jetstream aircraft, Belmondo said.
   Co-pilot Doug McInroe, 25, joined United Express in August with
more than two years flying experience, Belmondo said.
   The plane wasn't equipped with the voice and flight-data
recorders that larger commercial airlines use to tape cockpit
conversations.
   United Express, owned by NPA Inc., is based in Pasco and serves
15 cities in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana.

<HEAD>Call-In Cable TV Program Offers Help With a National Problem: Homework</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students who once turned to the ``boob tube'' to
avoid homework may now seek help from the small screen.
   In a new twist on the TV call-in talk show, Cablevision of
Boston offers youngsters a place to call after school with their
homework questions.
   Begun this fall with Boston teachers who take queries at all
levels of mathematics as well as a preparatory course for the
Scholastic Aptitude Test, ``Extra Help'' will be expanded early
next year with a call-in show for English as a second language, and
reading.
   ``It's not a novel idea,'' said Lisa McNulty, education producer
for Cablevision. She pointed out that similar call-in homework help
has been offered since 1976 on Long Island, N.Y., and elsewhere.
   What is unique about the Boston program is that it's tied to the
curriculum used throughout the Boston system, she said.
   The program is available as part of the basic package offered
the system's 100,000 subscribers in Boston and Brookline.
   The size of the audience isn't known, McNulty said, but a
90-minute installment of the program aired live twice a week
typically gets 20 to 25 calls.
   One regular viewer is Billy Marsden, a 17-year-old senior at
Muriel Snowden High School.
   Marsden said Wednesday the program has helped him climb out of
the depths of a flunking grade in algebra last year to become an A
student.
   ``When you're at home and have no one to turn to, (now) you have
someone there, live, to help with your homework,'' said Marsden,
whose parents both work.
   ``One thing I like about it, the teachers are very personable.
They thank you for calling up the line. They don't have this air
like `You should know this' _ I know of some teachers that have
acted like that.''
   The TV teachers start with a three- to five-minute lesson and
then take phone calls from students who ask questions. The TV
teacher helps by guiding the student callers through the problems.
   Nicholas Rubino, program director of citywide mathematics for
the Boston Public Schools, said ``Extra Help'' is one tool Boston
schools are using to improve education.
   ``A lot of the students in high school don't go home and study
two to three hours at night,'' Rubino said. ``That's all over.
They're going to work or to play sports.''
   This causes particular problems in subjects such as science and
mathematics that require repetition and review, he said. ``Extra
Help,'' which is broadcast on Sundays as well as during the week,
is an effort to get around this, he said.
   It's too soon to tell if the program will improve performance,
Rubino said.
   But the program might also be useful to teachers, Rubino said.
Educators tune in to watch their most imaginative and enthusiastic
colleagues in action.
   ``One of the biggest things we're trying to do is retrain
teachers,'' Rubino said. ``What we're trying to do is make teachers
more sensitive.''

<HEAD>Veterans Plead for Respect at Homeless Shelter</HEAD>

   For Ben Colon, Vietnam was the beginning of a
downward spiral that led him to the nation's first homeless shelter
for veterans and now a liquid diet to protest conditions there.
   He said he and other veterans have been fighting for their
dignity since returning to the United States and a public which
viewed them as part of a problem.
   ``They were protesting us, calling us baby killers, throwing
eggs at us,'' he said of protesters who met his plane when it
returned from Vietnam in the early 1970s.
   He went home to Brooklyn, broke up with his girlfriend, jumped
from job to job and ended up homeless a year ago, shortly after
overcoming a drug dependency.
   Now 36, Colon stood Wednesday outside the Salvation Army's
shelter in the New York borough of Queens, with Earl Beddoe, 41.
The two of them have had nothing but juice since Dec. 17.
   The shelter's administrator, Al Peck, said the 400 veterans are
free to go elsewhere if they dislike the rules and conditions.
   ``They know beforehand what the rules and regulations are. There
are 2,000 other guys who want to come in,'' Peck said.
   About 15 veterans joined Beddoe and Colon in 15-degree weather
outside the shelter to push demands for better conditions and a say
in running the shelter, which is run by the Salvation Army
specifically for veterans.
   Homeless veteran Fred Tyus read a statement describing the
Salvation Army's treatment of the veterans as ``arrogant,
dictatorial, unresponsive and iron-fisted.''
   ``The management of this residence uses the homeless veterans as
a superb public relations tool and an excellent conduit for
charitable contributions,'' he said.
   The veterans called for posting of job openings at the shelter,
where two of the 40 workers are homeless veterans; better efforts
to find employment and housing for residents; improved medical
care; observance of religious dietary rules and modification of
curfew policies.
   They also want an end to frisking by security officers;
restoration of laundry service; improved ventilation; a
modification of the system in which three infractions of the rules
are grounds for expulsion; and a change in staff attitude.
   ``This is a veterans residence, not a jail or a concentration
camp,'' homeless veteran Richard Catalano said to applause from the
veterans around him. ``We served our country and should not be
treated as undesirable outcasts or children.
   ``We need compassion, sensitivity and support, not disrespect
and hostility.''
   Colon said the last straw came when veterans were told that if
they went to stay with family during Christmas and missed curfew,
they would lose their beds.
   Peck acknowledged the curfew rule hadn't been altered for the
holidays, and said he didn't expect rules and regulations to change.
   ``They can choose to come here or not to come here. There are 25
other shelters in the city system,'' he said. ``It's a difference
in philosophy. They basically want to run their own shelter.''
   Peck planned to meet with homeless veterans, American Civil
Liberties Union Executive Director Norman Siegel and a
representative of Mayor-elect David Dinkins about the dispute.
   Siegel said he hoped the 1990s would end treatment of ``the
homeless, especially the veterans, as undesirable outcasts or
children or crazies or criminals.''
   Beddoe and Colon both said they were willing to die of
starvation, which Peck called ``an effective tool to get attention
from the press.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was fluctuating in a narrow range in
Europe late this morning after having lost ground earlier in the
session.
   Gold prices fell.
   Foreign exchange traders stressed that the dollar's recent
weakness had only limited significance because of the lack of
trading volume.
   One Milan trader said activity was limited to a few customers
who need to close commercial positions before the end of the year.
   ``The market really doesn't exist,'' another Milan trader said,
adding that the dollar's decline ``takes place in a vacuum.''
   He said he expected the dollar to rebound next week when volume
returns to normal at the beginning of the new year.
   In Tokyo, the dollar edged up 0.05 yen to a closing 142.15 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 142.05 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.6770 West German marks, down from 1.6895
   _1.5255 Swiss francs, down from 1.5355
   _5.7360 French francs, down from 5.7760
   _1.8957 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9080
   _1,258.00 Italian lire, down from 1,266.00
   _1.1573 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1587
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6270 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6255 late Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $402.10 a troy ounce,
down from $406.25 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $400.40.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $400.25, down from $406.00 bid late
Wednesday.
   Gold in Hong Kong dropped $6.88 to close at a bid $401.61.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.26 a troy ounce from
Wednesday's $5.41.

<HEAD>Leading Law Agency Seeks Indictment of Top Senator in Latest Coup
Attempt</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 11 grafs to UPDATE with Enrile denial. Picks up 8th
pvs, `Early today...'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By OLIVER TEVES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Bureau of Investigation
recommended today that Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile be charged with
rebellion for an alleged role in this month's attempt to topple
President Corazon Aquino, an official said.
   Enrile denied involvement and said the accusations were meant to
harass the opposition.
   Fernando de Leon, the chief state prosecutor, said witnesses
claimed to have seen Enrile with mutiny leaders on Dec. 1, when
thousands of troops launched the sixth and strongest attempt to
topple Mrs. Aquino.
   De Leon said the recommendation would be referred to a panel of
prosecutors to decide whether charges would be filed. Enrile was
fired as defense minister in November 1986 after a failed coup by
his followers.
   ``The statement of the witnesses points to the fact that at the
height of the coup on Dec. 1, many soldiers with white patches on
their shoulders were seen at the residence of Sen. Enrile and some
guests there inside the house were conferring with him,'' said de
Leon.
   De Leon said those reportedly seen with Enrile included former
Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, believed to have been a key
leader in the failed putsch.
   De Leon said the witnesses were hotel waiters who were catering
a meal at Enrile's Makati residence on the first day of the
nine-day coup attempt, which claimed the lives of 113 people and
left more than 500 wounded.
   Enrile said there were no soldiers at his residence. He said
``not more than 20'' bodyguards in civilian clothes were present
that day along with some guests who attended a Mass traditionally
held every first Friday of the month at his house.
   ``I welcome the opportunity to face them ... in the courts,''
Enrile said. ``I know that I have not done anything that is
criminal under our laws. I am not part of the rebellion.
   ``They want to seal the lips of the opposition in the country
and to threaten them, but I will tell them now ... that they cannot
silence me,'' he said. ``This government is like a wounded tiger
flailing its paws.''
   Early today, panic-selling swept the country's major stock
exchange after a senior general warned of a possible new coup
attempt. Government institutions bought stocks to ease selling
pressure.
   Dealers blamed the decline on a statement Wednesday by Maj. Gen.
Ramon Montano, chief of the Philippine Constabulary, that a new
coup may be launched after Jan. 17.
   Montano warned the new attempt could be launched by renegade
leaders of this month's coup attempt. Many of the key ringleaders,
including Honasan, remain at large.
   ``Our intelligence data tell us that the next possible timetable
for a coup could be between Jan. 17 and 30,'' Montano told
reporters.
   In a related development, the newspaper Malaya today published
what it said was a secret government ``watchlist'' of 55 people
allegedly linked to the failed coup. The list included Vice
President Salvador Laurel and Enrile.
   Laurel, a longtime political rival of Mrs. Aquino, demanded that
the government confirm whether the report was true and if so,
explain the basis for the allegations. There was no immediate
comment from the presidential staff.

<HEAD>4 Soldiers, Sailor Killed in Panama Are Buried</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Four soldiers and a sailor who died in the U.S. invasion of
Panama were buried with full military honors before scores of
military personnel, elected officials and clergyman.
   The funerals were held Wednesday in West Virginia, South
Carolina, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Alabama. Altogether, 23
American troops died in the fighting last week.
   In Central Falls, R.I., some 300 mourners filled Notre Dame
Church for the funeral of Army Cpl. Ivan Perez, a native of
Colombia who grew up in Rhode Island. The 22-year-old Perez was
killed in an ambush by forces loyal to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
the Army said.
   ``This isn't the Christmas that any one of us planned,'' the
Rev. Dennis Reardon told mourners. ``We are grateful to him for the
sacrifice he made. We value and appreciate all the honors and
awards being given to him today.''
   Gov. Edward D. DiPrete and U.S. Sen. Claiborne Pell were among
those at the ceremony.
   In Princeton, W.Va., Army Pvt. 2 Kenneth Douglas Scott, 20, was
buried in the snowy mountains he called home as about 100 mourners
looked on, including his foster parents and the woman he had
planned to marry next month.
   ``I think the one thing that makes us all go on is that they did
not die in vain,'' said state Director of Veterans Affairs John
Moon.
   A military honor guard from Fort Knox, Ky., saluted Scott's
casket one by one at a Princeton funeral home.
   Scott, who joined the Army in June and was stationed at Fort
Polk, La., died serving with the 6th Infantry Division in early
fighting in Panama City on Dec. 20, according to the Defense
Department.
   At St. Agnes Parish church in Arlington, Mass., about 550
family, friends and sympathizers, including Roman Catholic Cardinal
Bernard Law, mourned Navy Lt. j.g. John Connors.
   Connors, a 25-year-old Arlington native, had volunteered for
service in Panama. He had joined the Navy in 1987 and served in the
special operations unit known as the SEALS, or Sea, Air and Land
teams. The Pentagon did not release the circumstances of his death.
   ``We celebrate a common loss and recognize a common grief,''
said the Rev. John McIntyre, one of Connors' teachers at Boston
College High School. ``We do not come here this morning to find
anything like sense, because there is no sense.''
   Among the mourners was the new Panamanian ambassador to the
United Nations, Eduardo Vallerino, who lives in the neighboring
town of Belmont.
   In Seneca, S.C., nearly 400 people attended the funeral of Army
Specialist Phillip S. Lear, one of three South Carolina natives
killed during the invasion.
   The infantryman who had planned to get married when his tour was
over next summer died Dec. 20 of gunshot wounds while American
troops were mopping up an area near Rhiohato Air Force Base, about
65 miles west of Panama City.
   The service at the United Assembly of God Church for the
21-year-old Westminster native was attended by scores of military
personnel from each branch of the service. Lear was buried at the
Oconee Memorial Park and, like the others, given a 21-gun salute.
   The Rev. Harvey Gainer described Lear as a soldier who
``willingly gave his life in what he believed was an effort to
protect American lives and his country.''
   Maj. Gen. John A. Renner handed an American flag to Lear's
mother after the burial and thanked her ``on behalf of the
president of the United States and a very greatful nation ... for
the selfless and honorable service of your son.''
   At Fort Mitchell National Cemetary in Alabama, two military
brothers buried a third brother, Army Sgt. Michael DeBlois, at a
ceremony attended by about 40 friends and relatives.
   DeBlois, 24, of Columbus, Ga., was eulogized as a good soldier
who turned in an honorable performance in Panama, despite an
earlier flesh wound he received when hit by debris from an
exploding building.
   The radio operator was one of two soldiers killed when someone
tossed a grenade inside a building in Panama City that had been
``cleared'' by U.S. troops, according to DeBlois' squad leader.

   Moderate earthquakes struck in Southern California and in
Hawaii, but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries
in either temblor.
   The California quake rattled residents along a 100-mile stretch
from Palm Springs to Los Angeles today, officials said.
   The quake, centered about seven miles northwest of San
Bernardino, hit at 1:41 a.m. and measured 4.3 on the Richter scale,
said Hall Daily, spokesman for the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena.
   ``It shook us pretty good,'' said Jay Diamond, a disc jockey for
KFRG-FM. ``The glass on the booth was shaking.''
   In Hawaii, a quake that registered 4.6 on the Richter Scale
shook Hawaii Island's Puna district at 11:13 p.m. Wednesday, said
William Mass, a geophysist at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center on
the island of Oahu.
   It didn't cause a tsunami, or tidal wave, Mass said.
   Police checked the area around the epicenter for signs of
damage, but found none, said Officer Randy Arello.
   ``It was strong enough to feel, but not that bad,'' Arello said.
   Quakes ranging in magnitude from 4 to 5 on the Richter scale of
ground motion are considered moderate, and can cause some local
damage, mostly broken houseware, items falling from shelves, broken
windows and cracks in poorly built structures.

   Contract negotations to bring a veteran
television producer to the ``Today'' show have collapsed, network
officials said.
   Dave Nuell, the guiding force behind the syndicated program
``Entertainment Tonight,'' was to join ``Today'' as senior
executive producer on Jan. 8. But Michael Gartner, president of NBC
News, notified Nuell last Friday that negotiations were being
terminated.
   Nuell, a former news director at NBC's Washington station, WRC,
joined ``Entertainment Tonight'' in 1986 and is credited with
turning the troubled program into a top-rated show.
   He left the show several weeks ago in anticipation of the job at
NBC. He told The Washington Post that he ``had a three-year firm
deal that NBC reneged on. I intend to take every remedy I have to
try to repair the damage.''
   Gartner, in news release, said talks had gone on for three
months.
   ``We are disappointed that in the end, we were unable to reach
an agreement in a timely manner,'' Gartner said.
   Reportedly, the hangup involved questions about whether Nuell's
three-year, $2.7 million contract would be guaranteed.
   Peggy Hubble, an NBC spokesman, said only that the problems
involved ``some points in the contract that we didn't agree to.''
   She said that Marty Ryan, the executive producer of ``Today,''
would continue to act as producer as well.

<TEXT>
   The 11th person extradited from Colombia to the
United States since its current crackdown against drug traffickers
began in August has pleaded innocent to drug charges.
   Victor Eduardo Mera-Mosquera, 36, a convicted cocaine smuggler,
was turned over to U.S. marshals by Colombian authorities on Sunday.
   Mera-Mosquera was mistakenly released from federal detention in
New York and fled to Colombia before his trial in 1984. He was
convicted in absentia of drug conspiracy and distribution, for
which he faces up to 30 years in prison.
   He also faces trial on a subsequent charge of running a
continuing drug enterprise, with a maximum penalty of life in
prison. He denied the charge Wednesday before U.S. District Judge
Morris Lasker, who ordered him held without bail.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mary Lee Warren said the government
would drop the new charge if Mera-Mosquera receives the 30-year
sentence he faces on his 1984 conviction. Colombia's extradition
treaty with the United States has a 30-year maximum on the terms
fugitives may face here.
   Mera-Mosquera was convicted of co-directing U.S. operations of a
ring that smuggled more than 2,200 pounds of cocaine, starting in
1982, according to his indictment. The new charge stems from the
same activities.
   Lasker did not set a sentencing date.

   Two gunmen posed as customers before robbing
a jewelry district wholesaler of more than 100 pounds of scrap gold
and gold products worth about $1 million, police said.
   The two owners and five employees were tied up in the robbery
Wednesday at the Rope Mine Corp.
   At least 103 pounds of fine gold, gold chains, locks and scrap
bars were stolen from an open safe in the offices of the downtown
jewelry district company, said Khatchik Djigardjian, who owns the
wholesale business with his brother, Liouduig.
   ``It's a pretty good-size robbery,'' said Detective Manny
Garcia, who estimated the haul at 115 pounds of gold.
   Djigardjian said the robbers pressed the door buzzer about 8
a.m. and were in his sixth-floor office. There was momentary
business talk, and the men said they were from New York.
Djigardjian said he was then suddenly held at gunpoint and never
made a move for the unloaded shotgun propped against his desk or
the loaded gun in his desk drawer.
   The men handcuffed him in his office, he said, and the employees
were called in singly, then tied up. Wearing surgical gloves, the
robbers put the gold in a briefcase and fled. Two of the bound
employees were able to wrest a phone from a desk and call for help.
   The exact loss would have to be determined by an inventory but
was ``close to a million dollars if not more than that,''
Djigardjian said.
   The detectives' report said both robbers may have been Middle
Eastern and both were armed with handguns.

<TEXT>
   Southerners just beginning to thaw out after four days of record
cold struggled to patch water systems, reckoned their losses from
crop damage and missed tourism in a normally busy resort week.
   Consumers in the East and Midwest will soon be feeling the
effects of the South's Christmas chill as the devastation on
Florida's vegetable farms drives up prices in the grocery stores,
agriculture experts said.
   Meanwhile, the early winter cold wave continued to make itself
felt farther north today, with barge traffic on Pittsburgh's three
rivers slowed to a near standstill by ice.
   The long, cold weekend gave way to mostly clear skies and
temperatures in the 40s, 50s, even 60s in much of the Deep South on
Wednesday, and most of the region will get highs in the 60s today,
forecasters said.
   Highs in the teens and 20s were forecast from the Northeast to
the Rockies today, with milder temperatures elsewhere.
   More than 100 deaths nationwide have been blamed on the cold
since Dec. 15.
   In communities from Houston to James Island, S.C., plumbers
worked overtime Wednesday to repair water pipes that split in the
freeze, and homeowners faced another day of dry faucets or low
water pressure.
   Governments hoping to restore water pressure begged people to
conserve and to shut taps they left trickling to prevent freezing.
   In central Louisiana, residents of Boyce were without water for
two hours Wednesday afternoon and again for five hours overnight as
the town's wells were shut off to allow water levels to rise. In
Pollock, residents will have only limited water service at least
until the weekend, because the town's three wells failed on
Christmas Day.
   In New Orleans, firefighters pumped water from a bayou to fight
an eight-alarm fire at an abandoned cannery after leaks in pipes
reduced water pressure throughout the city. And the same problem
loomed elsewhere.
   ``If we have a fire, we're in trouble,'' said Mayor George Sides
of Dora, Ala., where volunteers helped look for broken pipes. ``You
can only put so many bricks on the wagon before it breaks.''
   Shortages were reported in five Alabama counties, and in Mobile,
pressure wasn't expected to return to normal for 93,000 customers
for two more days.
   Wilmington, N.C., declared two days of emergency conservation,
cutting off water to non-essential businesses. Leaks were forcing
the city to pump more than 18 million gallons of water a day,
almost double the normal 10 million gallons.
   Thousands of acres of produce froze in the fields of Florida
over the long weekend, and experts said wholesale prices began
climbing Wednesday because of the short supply of tomatoes, bell
peppers, lettuce, cucumbers and other vegetables.
   ``Everything has just tripled in price. Green cabbage was doing
about $8.75 (a box) and they're asking over $20 for it now,'' said
Paul Graff, manager of the Len Strom brokerage in Miami. ``Zucchini
is way up in the $25 range, which was between $11 and $12 before,
and so it goes.''
   Prices will begin climbing in the markets of the Midwest and
Northeast within a week, said Reggie Brown, spokesman for the
Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association in Orlando.
   Production in California and Mexico should ease the shortages
somewhat, he said, but prices are likely to remain high for three
months, until Florida farmers can replant.
   The weather put a damper on tourism around Orlando, Fla., in
what is normally one of the busiest weeks of the year, but resort
operators around Walt Disney World and elsewhere hoped the return
of 60- and 70-degree sunshine would turn that around by year's end.
   Hotel occupancy and attendance at attractions began picking up
rapidly Wednesday.
   ``Between Christmas and New Year's, it's usually a bonanza. But
this year, no,'' said Ron Caimano, general manager of the Embassy
Suites hotel in Orlando, where occupancy Tuesday was just 75
percent.
   The big chill wasn't all bad news, though.
   While it was bringing the rare thrill of a white Christmas to
some, it may have been killing off millions of fleas, ticks, gnats,
mosquitoes and flies, said Frank Funderburk, an extension agent in
Bibb County, Ga.
   ``It's hard to say what nature is going to do,'' Funderburk
said, ``but the insects that bother man should be less in number
early in the summer.''
   Unfortunately, household pests like cockroaches probably
survived, he said.

   A man charged with murder for running
over an acquaintance with his car told police that the victim had
paid him to kill him.
   The victim, Graham Glickfeld, 31, of Fremont, paid Michael K.
Doeschot, 27, of Newark, to kill him in a community center parking
lot, police said Wednesday.
   ``It was a murder for hire,'' based on Doeschot's account, said
Sgt. Mike Eads.
   Doeschot was arraigned Wednesday on a charge of first-degree
murder. No bail was set at the hearing in Fremont-Newark-Union City
Municipal Court.
   Police refused to speculate on the motive for the alleged
agreement carried out Friday night.
   Doeschot, a San Jose State student, and Glickfeld, a supermarket
employee, attended a Christmas party with friends Friday evening,
police said.
   Shortly before midnight, police were called to the Fremont
Community Center, where they found Glickfeld lying in the empty
parking lot. Glickfeld, who had been run over by a small car, was
taken to Washington Hospital, where he died a short time later,
according to police.
   Doeschot later phoned Newark police ``to let us know what's
going on,'' Eads said. ``There was an admission that (Doeschot) had
run over this guy.''
   Officers stopped Doeschot at a grocery store and took him to the
police station.
   Eads would not say how much Glickfeld allegedly paid to be
killed but said it was ``not a lot of money.''

<TEXT>
   Marin Ceausescu, the older brother of
executed Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu, was found dead at the
Romanian Embassy in Vienna today after apparently committing
suicide, police said.
   A police spokesman who refused to be identified said the
74-year-old diplomat, who reportedly headed Western European
operations of the dreaded Romanian secret police, was found hanged
in the basement of the embassy' trade mission.
   The spokesman said it appeared to be suicide and there were no
indications that anyone else was involved in his death.
   Authorities ordered an autopsy, the Austria Press Agency
reported.
   Little was known about Marin Ceausescu's career until he was
listed as the director of the Romanian presentation at the 14th
International Engineering Fair in Brno, Czechoslovakia, in 1972.
   In April 1974, he moved to Vienna as chief of the Romanian Trade
Agency.
   A man who answered the telephone at the Romanian Embassy said he
was not authorized to answer any questions about Ceausescu and
added that no one else was available for comment.
   The Austria Press Agency said the embassy in the last few days
had repeatedly said Ceausescu was not there.
   In its edition today, the Vienna daily Kurier reported that a
spokesman for the trade mission had claimed Ceausescu had traveled
to Bucharest out of concern for his family, particularly his
daughters, Gabriela and Mihaela.
   Kurier, referring to unspecified sources in the new Romanian
government, alleged Ceausescu ``managed the Romanian secret service
headquarters for Western Europe in Vienna.''
   There was no additional information to corroborate the claim,
and the report could not be independently verified.
   Nicolae Ceausescu was executed with his wife, Elena, on Monday
after he was found guilty of ``grave crimes'' during his harsh
24-year rule. The Communist dictator was toppled Friday after a
popular uprising that began Dec. 15.

<HEAD>The Gates of Downing Street: Barrier for Mrs. Thatcher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Steel security gates built across Downing Street
to block the entry to the official residence of Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher do not fit, photographs published today suggest.
   A chain and padlock holding the gates together was published in
the Guardian newspaper.
   But a spokesman for the Property Services Agency, the body which
deals with government property, said work hasn't finished on the
10-foot tall gates.
   ``These gates have been put into position but final adjustments
will not be made until next week, which was always the timetable
for this job,'' he said, speaking anonymously in keeping with
British custom.
   ``You get so far with the job and then you send your technicians
in to finish it off. They will come next week. It is not therefore
true to say that the gates don't fit. It is much ado about
nothing.''
   The gates are backed up by a steel screen designed to spring up
from the road in the path of any attacker.
   Downing Street used to be open to anyone to wander along for a
look at the modest building housing the head of government. Crowds
would collect at times of comings and goings for government changes
and over many years a man turned up every day to kneel in the
street to pray for the prime minister.
   All that is now over.
   The street was first closed off by a waist-high wooden barrier
and police guards eight years ago, when the Irish Republican Army
was conducting a bombing campaign in Britain to back its struggle
to end British rule in Northern Ireland.
   The iron gates which have now replaced the wooden barrier were
designed by architect Steve Pashnam and have been criticized by
other architects and by conservationists for their size. They also
have been the butt of jokes by political opponents of Mrs. Thatcher
who say she wants the barrier to protect her from public opposition
to her policies.
   The Guardian said completion of the gates ``marks the final
abolition of what was a public right of way for 200 years.''
   The street is named after Sir George Downing who built the
cul-de-sac of brick row houses in 1680.

<HEAD>Food Store Chain Hopes Police Cutouts Will Cut Out Crime</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A food store chain is hoping that the unblinking
stares of three police officers will deter shoplifting, even if the
cops are only 6-foot cardboard cutouts.
   The police officers stationed in Kroger stores this week are
life-size and look pretty real. But they're scarecrooks, operating
on the same principle as scarecrows.
   Police in London noticed a decrease in shoplifting after they
put up cardboard bobbies in stores, Dallas Police Lt. A.J.
D'Alessandro said Wednesday.
   Kroger put officer cutouts _ made from photos of three Dallas
police officers _ in three stores in Dallas, and move them around
each month. After three months, Kroger plans to review the campaign
to see whether it has been as successful as its British inspiration.
   ``I'm pretty sure we'll have some success,'' D'Alessandro said.
``This campaign can be a limited-time success, but we'll move the
officers around to other stores. The people will be faced with a
different officer, and they'll be startled again.''
   The cutouts portray officers in uniform in natural poses. A sign
at the cutouts' feet reads: ``Shoplifting is a Crime.''
   Police Cpl. Chip Bulin appeared satisfied with the life-size
cardboard photograph of himself. Also pictured are Cpls. Robert
Garcia and Rodney Woods.
   The cutouts are placed in areas conducive to theft, Tyner said.
Bulin's likeness was in the cosmetics department, Woods' guarded
cigarette cartons, batteries and the automated teller machine.
Garcia's cutout was placed near soda machines.
   The photos, at D'Alessandro's request, were shot straight on,
``to make it appear that wherever you move, they are looking at
you.''
   Charlie Tyner, security supervisor for Kroger, said the store is
not trying to fool anyone with the cardboard cops.
   ``But it's a startling way to say the same old message, that
shoplifting is a crime,'' he said.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The gun collection program set up by
U.S. armed forces to sweep Panama City clean of illegal weapons has
been a huge success _ maybe too much so.
   One person turned in a beautiful antique flintlock musket _ at
least 150 years old _ with brass handle, hand-carved wooden stock
and loading tools, including what looked like a wooden mallet.
   All of it fit snugly in special compartments of a soft leather
case lined with red velvet.
   ``I tell them that this kind of stuff is worth far more than the
$100 we give them for a pistol,'' said Army Sgt. Tim Harper of the
193rd Brigade stationed at Fort Clayton on the outskirts of Panama
City near the canal.
   But apparently, the people would rather have the cash than an
old, odd-looking musket that shoots lead balls, which in any case
may just have been acquired in the looting that destroyed the
city's main shopping avenue.
   Most Panamanians, however, have been bringing in regular stuff _
Soviet designed AK-47 automatic rifles, Belgian-made FAL assault
rifles (``The sniper's weapon,'' Harper said), hand and
rocket-propelled grenades as well as light anti-tank weapons,
dynamite and even tear-gas grenades.
   That doesn't include the ``exotic'' guns that Harper said he
wasn't actually expecting to get _ Uzi submachine guns,
American-made M-60 machine guns, ``and lots and lots of
ammunition.''
   ``It's a gun lover's paradise,'' said Harper, of Allen Park,
Mich., as he surveyed hundreds of weapons in small piles lying on
exercise mats covering the entire floor of Ancon Gym.
   By paying cash for weapons brought in to four special collection
points, the U.S. military is trying to lessen the chances that they
could fall into the hands of diehards from Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega's disbanded Defense Forces.
   Authorities pay $25 for each hand grenade brought in; $100 for
pistols; $125 for shotguns; $150 for automatic rifles; $150 for
mines. On items not outlined in the payoff schedule, Harper
bargains.
   Bazookas, for example, go for about the same as an automatic
rifle; tear-gas grenades are negotiable, but closer to the price
for regular hand grenades.
   An Army official said today that $150,000 had been paid for
2,208 weapons turned in by 721 people.
   Harper said the weapons would eventually probably be returned to
Panama's new government, which was sworn in Dec. 20 when the United
States invaded to oust Noriega. Members of the Defense Forces who
surrender are screened and incorporated into a new armed force that
includes police and security.
   Already, some are performing tasks alongside U.S. troops and
taking over police duties, such as directing traffic.
   Armed with their regular weapons, the Panamanian forces also are
patrolling streets and guarding government buildings, looking for
looters and the occassional sniper.
   At Ancon Gym, about 100 Panamanians lined up late Wednesday
afternoon to collect their money. Some said they had been there
since morning, when they turned in weapons.
   Most people interviewed said they had ``found them in the
trash.'' One man said he found his weapon ``in the bushes.''
   When asked why they were looking through the trash, or in the
bushes, those interviewed tended to want to change the topic of
conversation.
   One man, 23-year-old Luis Reyes, admitted he was a former
Defense Forces sergeant and had been in the Panamanian military for
nearly five years.
   A native of the central provincial town of Los Santos, Reyes
said he was a high school dropout and had joined the Defense Forces
as just a quick way to start earning a living.
   He said he has a wife and two toddlers. He brought in a
.38-caliber handgun, for which he was to get $100.
   ``I'll use it to buy food and other things that are needed in my
house, what else?'' Reyes said.
   He said he would like to form part of the new armed force, but
if there are civilian jobs available, then he'd rather have one of
those.
   ``I would be more at rest and closer to my family,'' he said.

<HEAD>Safety Inspectors Shut Down Five SF High-Rise Cranes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angry officials say inspectors have found
safety violations in half the high-rise construction cranes
operating in the city a month after a crane collapse killed five
people.
   Inspectors ordered two more cranes shut down Wednesday, bringing
to five the number of cranes ordered to stop work by the California
Occupational Safety and Health Administration. In most cases, the
cranes were allowed to go back into operation after violations were
corrected.
   Two other construction cranes were found to be in proper order,
while the other three cranes in use at high-rise construction sites
around the city have not yet been inspected, officials said.
   Mayor Art Agnos, who requested Cal-OSHA to do the inspections
after the Nov. 28 disaster, promised to seek stricter supervision
of the machines, warning careless operators that ``we're coming
after you.''
   He said he would tell other mayors throughout the state of the
result of the inspections and hoped that together they could
pressure the state Legislature for stricted regulation.
   Cal-OSHA inspectors on Wednesday shut down a skyscraper crane at
a construction site because the operator lacked equipment to test
for unsafe loads. They shut down another crane because of
improperly set safety devices, said Cal-OSHA spokesman Rick Rice.
   ``Our feeling is one of being upset and very surprised,'' Rice
said.
   On Tuesday, Cal-OSHA shut down a crane because it lacked a
required warning light and bell to tell workers of dangerously
heavy loads. Inspectors, citing similar problems, earlier shut down
two other cranes.
   A huge tower crane was being raised from the 16th to the 20th
floor of a Financial District skyscraper on Nov. 28 when it fell to
the pavement, killing the operator and four other people. The
accident is still under investigation.
   State inspectors do not regularly examine tower cranes,
generally relying on the owners and operators of the equipment to
certify them as safe.
   Agnos, at a news conference, criciticized the practice as
``unacceptable'' and comparing it to ``a system that allows the fox
to guard the chickens.''
   Both the state Legislature and the San Francisco city government
are considering measures to tighten regulation of crane operators.

   A pickup truck slammed into an
overturned tanker carrying 1,100 gallons of fuel, triggering an
explosion and wall of fire and killing four people, authorities
said.
   The driver of the tanker was not in the vehicle and thus escaped
injury in Wednesday night's crash on Interstate 10, said Capt. Rick
Stone of the Los Angeles County Fire Department.
   The four fatalities were all inside the pickup truck that
smashed into the rear of the tanker, Stone said. The identities of
the victims and the tanker driver were not immediately available.
   The fire was finally doused about 3 a.m., and both eastbound and
westbound lanes of the interstate were reopened by 6:30 a.m., said
Officer Joe Johnson.
   The driver of the tanker owned by Dedicated Transportation Co.
was westbound on the freeway in Montclair, about 35 miles east of
Los Angeles, when he lost control of the vehicle and its rear
trailer overturned, said Stone.
   While the tanker driver was outside checking the damage, the
pickup hit it, setting off the explosion and fire, he said.
   Although early reports said the tanker had been carrying 20,000
gallons of fuel, Stone said the tanker held only 1,100 gallons. The
tanker had a capacity for 8,800 gallons, he said.

<HEAD>More Questions Raised About Durenberger Condo Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. Dave Durenberger signed backdated
real estate partnership documents to justify collecting living
expense reimbursements from the Senate in 1983, according to a
published report today.
   The Star Tribune of Minneapolis said the backdating made it
appear that the Minnesota Republican's partnership with a local
businessman was operating as the official owner of his Minneapolis
condominium in mid-1983, when in fact legal documents were not
drawn up until months later, apparently in the spring of 1984.
   Durenberger's chief of staff, Bert McKasy, said an oral
partnership agreement between Durenberger and Roger Scherer had
been reached in 1983, and that backdating official documents ``is
done'' in that kind of circumstance.
   ``What in fact happened was that in July of 1983, Mr. Scherer
and the senator agreed to form a business partnership, and their
lawyers did not reduce the partnership to writing until sometime in
December of that year,'' McKasy said.
   The backdating was disclosed in documents Durenberger filed
voluntarily with the Senate Rules Committee last week.
   Durenberger sold his downtown Minneapolis condominium to a
partnership, in which he was a member, and later to a company owned
by his former campaign manager. In both instances, he continued to
live there, but used Senate expense account funds to pay his rent.
According to previous reports, Durenberger collected at least
$9,947 in living expense payments from the Senate for time spent in
Minneapolis from July 1983 to June 1987.
   Durenberger has asked the Senate Rules Committee to review the
propriety of using his Senate expense account to pay rent for his
condominium and has said he will repay any improper expenditures.
   The Rules Committee staff believes that the senator apparently
did not violate Senate rules with his deal, but tentatively
determined that questions about the matter should be referred to
the Senate Ethics Committee.
   The Ethics Committee already is investigating a book deal in
which Durenberger made $100,000 between 1984 and 1986, and trips to
Boston in 1987 paid for by lobbyists.
   Durenberger apologized to Minnesotans at a news conference last
week, saying he did nothing illegal but acknowledging mistakes and
``lapses of judgment.''
   State Sen. Bill Luther announced Wednesday that he and other
Democrats will ask the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate the
condo arrangement, including the backdating of documents.
   ``It appears that the deed has actually been backdated in order
to justify payments that were made out of the public treasury,''
Luther said.
   According to the Star Tribune, deeds turning over the
Durenberger condo to the partnership are dated July 28, 1983. They
were notarized by Hennepin County Commissioner Randall Johnson,
then a legal adviser to Durenberger's campaign.
   However, documents Durenberger turned over to the Rules
Committee indicate that, as of March 1984, Durenberger had not
signed documents setting up the partnership. He signed them
sometime in mid-1984 and dated them July 1983 to reflect an oral
agreement made in 1983 with Scherer, the newspaper said.
   Senate records show Durenberger began filing for reimbursement
for rent in August 1983.
   In a Dec. 28, 1983, letter to Durenberger, which he gave to the
rules panel, Johnson told him: ``It is important that you conclude
the condominium transaction in order to justify the per-diem
(per-day) reimbursement you received during the August recess.'' He
added, ``Everything should be dated before Aug. 1, reflecting the
oral agreement between you and Roger.''
   On May 15, 1984, a deed signed by Durenberger, notarized by
Johnson and dated July 28, 1983, was filed at the Hennepin County
courthouse, the Star Tribune said.
   Johnson declined to comment because the matters concern a
relationship with a client, the newspaper said.
   Because Minnesota law requires a written document to make
property transfers valid, Durenberger would still have been the
legal owner of his condominium in August 1983, when he began filing
for reimbursement under the partnership arrangement that had not
yet been signed, the Star Tribune said.
   Four months later, Durenberger filed papers with the Senate
changing his official Minnesota residence to Avon, his family's
hometown, retroactive to July 28, 1983, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
   About 1,000 people packed into a small chapel to
honor a French television reporter crushed by a tank as he reported
on the revolution in Romania.
   A Romanian flag with its Communist symbols cut from the center
draped the coffin of Jean-Louis Calderon, 31, before his burial
Wednesday in the Parisian suburb of Poissy.
   A ceremony was held earlier in the afternoon at the Chapelle
Notre-Dame de Compassion in western Paris near the headquarters of
La Cinq, the station where Calderon worked.
   In attendance were Minister for Humanitarian Affairs Bernard
Kouchner and Robert Hersant, the French media magnate who serves as
president of the private network.
   Calderon arrived Friday in Bucharest to report on the ouster of
Nicolae Ceausescu and fighting between the army and security forces
loyal to the former dictator.
   About 30 army tanks entered the square before the Central
Committee headquarters about 2 a.m. Saturday, where Calderon and
cameraman Patrice Dutertre were photographing a crowd of
demonstrators.
   One of the tanks turned unexpectedly and ran over Calderon.
Dutertre narrowly avoided injury.
   Calderon had worked as a radio and television reporter since
1981 and reported from Lebanon, Chad, Chile, South Africa, Morocco,
Portugal and the United States. His survivors include a wife and
two daughters.
   A Belgian TV reporter, Danny Huwe, 42, died Sunday when snipers
ambushed a car bringing him and other journalists from Sofia,
Bulgaria to Bucharest. Turkish reporter Emre Aygen was wounded.
   At least four other journalists have been wounded, including
John Daniszewski of The Associated Press, John Tagliabue of The New
York Times, Italian photographer Pasquale Modica and a Yugoslavian
reporter.

<HEAD>GM Plans to Cut 3,200 Jobs at Kansas, Georgia, Oklahoma Plants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. said today it will cut 3,200
production jobs in February and March at three midsize car assembly
plants because of slow sales.
   The production cuts are in addition to previously announced
short-term shutdowns next month at 28 of GM's 34 North American
assembly plants.
   Two plants will scale back production Feb. 26, said GM
spokeswoman Nettie H. Seabrooks.
   GM will lay off the 1,900-employee afternoon shift at the
Doraville, Ga., plant, where the Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme is
built. About 700 of the 4,200 workers at GM's Fairfax, Kan., plant
will be laid off, cutting production of the Pontiac Grand Prix,
Seabrooks said.
   On March 26, about 600 of the 6,000 employees at GM's Oklahoma
City plant will be taken off assembly line work as production of
the Buick Century, Pontiac 6000 and Oldsmobile Cutlass Cira is
slowed.
   Rather than being laid off, those employees will be transferred
to a ``jobs bank'' that provides them with other work while
production jobs are suspended.
   Seabrooks said the cutbacks are for an indefinite period.

   A cold wave in normally tropical
northern Bangladesh has killed at least 33 people in the past week,
a newspaper reported Thursday.
   Temperatures in the region have hovered at about 42 degrees
Fahrenheit since Monday, and the New Nation newspaper said the
victims were laborers and other poor people unable to protect
themselves from the cold.
   At least 18 people were reported killed in the Kurigram
district, 150 miles north of Dhaka, in the past three days, the
English-language daily said.
   Another 15 deaths were reported from the Pabna and Rangpur
districts, also in the north.
   Such low temperatures are rare in Bangladesh, which has a
tropical climate for most of the year. Its 110 million people are
among the world poorest and earn an average $160 per person per
year.
   Most people live in houses with mud floors and walls woven from
straw and bamboo, offering little protection from the cold. Many of
people who died in the cold spell had no houses.

   Hundreds of policeman today surrounded a
Sikh temple in the northern state of Punjab and battled militants
inside, police said. At least four policeman were reported killed.
   Deputy Inspector General Gurinder Singh Bhullar said about 500
policemen surrounded the Darbar Sahib temple and exchanged fire
with entrenched extremists who had tried to ``take over the
gurdwara.''
   The gurdwara, a Punjabi-language word for Sikh temples, is in
the Tarn Taran town, 15 miles north of Amritsar where the holiest
Sikh shrine, the Golden Temple, is located.
   The government ordered an army attack on the Amritsar shrine on
June 3, 1984, to flush out Sikh extremists entrenched inside. Sikh
militants have fought since 1983 to establish a separate homeland
in Punjab, a rich farming state bordering Pakistan.
   The militants first opened fire inside the temple, ``apparently
to intimidate the clergymen,'' Bhullar said. They later fired on an
investigating police team, and ``soon it turned into a gunbattle.''
   At least four policemen were killed, reported Press Trust of
India news agency, quoting an official statement.
   The militants escaped with a wireless set, a light machinegun
and three rifles belonging to the slain policemen of the
paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force, PTI reported. But it was
unclear if the fighting had ended.

<HEAD>Report: Officers Failed to Obey Orders to Crush Democracy Movement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 100 Chinese army officers and 1,400
troops defied orders or left their posts during the military
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement last spring, a newspaper
reported Thursday.
   The accusations were made in an unpublished speech by Yang
Baibing, chief political commisar of the People's Liberation Army,
at a conference on army political work in Beijing earlier this
month, the English-language South China Morning Post said.
   The only officer named by Yang for disobeying orders was Xu
Qinxian, head of the Beijing-based 38th army. The newspaper said Xu
reportedly has been court-martialled and given a stiff sentence.
   Senior Communist Party leader Deng Xiaoping called on the 38th
army to restrict the scope of the pro-democracy demonstrations as
early as April, but its failure to clamp down helped lead to the
rapid growth of the protests, the newspaper said.
   Yang reportedly said 21 officers and cadres with ranks of
divisional commander or above, 36 officers with ranks of regimental
or battalion commander, and 54 officers with the rank of company
chief ``breached discipline in a serious manner during the struggle
to crush the counterrevolutionary rebellion.''
   He also said 1,400 soldiers ``shed their weapons and ran away.''
   Unconfirmed reports of dissension among Chinese soldiers spread
after the army killed hundreds and perhaps thousands of civilians
as it shot its way through Beijing on June 3-4 to quash the
protests.
   Yang, the younger brother of President Yang Shangkun, recently
was promoted to secretary-general of the Central Military
Commission of the ruling Communist Party and is considered a rising
star.
   The newspaper report said he has been given the task of ensuring
the loyalty of military officers in case students and workers again
challenge the government.

   Staff at a plush restaurant found
themselves serving turkey on a silver platter to a dog whose name
was chosen in a raffle over hundreds of human contestants.
   The cocker spaniel, appropriately named Lucky, was entered in
the competition by his owner, Phyllis Walmsley, of Shanklin, on the
Isle of Wight, off England's southern coast.
   Hundreds of people entered the raffle organized by the 1st
Shanklin Scouts group, but Lucky was the winner of the first prize
of a Christmas meal at a top restaurant on the island.
   Alan Priddle, owner of the Cottage Restaurant, said Thursday he
settled Lucky down at a table with a platter of turkey on Dec. 18.
The restaurant owner skipped the potatoes and turnip.
   ``We thought we'd just stick to the meat,'' Priddle said. ``He
ate all the turkey, yes.''
   He added: ``The dog was very well behaved. The only time he
growled was when we tried to put a party hat on his head.''
   Mrs. Walmsley said: ``I only entered Lucky for a joke, but he
lived up to his name.''

<HEAD>Discovery of Fake Bomb Touches Off Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fake bomb discovered on the desk of a
city council member has touched off a police investigation,
authorities said. But the council member says the whole thing was a
joke that was blown out of proportion.
   Police Chief John Scagno said Wednesday officers are
investigating the discovery of a look-alike bomb on Jay J. Armes'
desk Tuesday evening. City Hall was evacuated after a custodian
spotted the device about 6 p.m.
   The realistic-looking bomb had seven sticks of wood wrapped with
waxed paper used on actual sticks of dynamite and a working mercury
switch that caused lights to flash when the thing was tilted, said
Lt. Dave Hamrick, a member of the police's Bomb Squad.
   ``Until we had a chance to check it out, it looked very real,''
Hamrick said.
   But Armes says the ``bomb'' was a gag Christmas gift from his
adult son and that he brought it into his office to use as a clock
Tuesday morning. Armes said his son ordered the device through a
magazine.
   He accused the police of overreacting to the bomb because he has
been feuding with Scagno for months, often questioning the chief's
competence at City Council meetings.
   ``This is the only way they can get back at Jay Armes,'' Armes
said.
   Police deny they are seeking revenge. ``This case is being
handled like any other investigation,'' said Lt. J.R. Grijalva,
police spokesman.
   Earlier this month, bombs killed a federal judge in Alabama and
a city council member in Savannah, Ga., and wounded a state judge
in Maryland. Other bombs were found before they exploded in
Jacksonville, Fla., and Atlanta. El Paso police officials said the
fear created by those incidents was one reason they evacuated City
Hall when the ``bomb'' was found Tuesday.
   In Texas, making or possessing a device that causes somebody to
believe it is an actual bomb or causes emergency officials to
respond is a Class A misdemeanor.
   Scagno said his department will turn over its investigation to
the county attorney's office. Scagno said the attorney's office
will decide if charges should be filed.

<HEAD>Editors Vote: Fall of Communist Regimes Tops 1989's Stories</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN BARBOUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The overwhelming story of 1989 was the disintegration of
communism in Eastern Europe and Mikhail S. Gorbachev's efforts to
lead the Soviet Union into a freer society, according to a poll of
Associated Press newspaper editors and broadcast news directors.
   The communist turnaround received 3,256 points, almost the sum
of the two stories that finished second and third, the crushing of
China's Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement, and the Alaskan
oil spill.
   The China story narrowly outpolled the oil spill in editor
interest, 1,690 points to 1,687.
   In the poll, 315 editors and news directors ranked the stories.
A first-place vote earned a story 10 points and a 10th-place
listing one point.
   Late-developing stories were not on the ballots, which were due
by Dec. 15, five days before the United States invaded Panama and
seven before the bloody ouster of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in
Romania.
   The decline of communism was voted No. 1 by almost the same
margin as in an earlier AP poll of the top stories for the decade,
a poll in which the AIDS epidemic was voted No. 2 for the 1980s.
   The No. 4 story for 1989 was the San Francisco earthquake, with
1,616 points, followed by: the continuing abortion controversy,
1,225; the international drug war, 1,061; Hurricane Hugo, 935;
government ethics, including scandals involving the Department of
Housing and Urban Development and the Pentagon, 751; the federal
bailout of savings and loans, 515; the conviction of Oliver North
and the lingering investigation of the Iran-Contra affair, 511.
   Notable stories of 1989 that did not make the top 10 included
the Malta summit; the crash of United Flight 232 and the skill of
its crew in saving 184 lives; the conviction and 45-year sentence
of TV evangelist Jim Bakker; the lifetime ban of Pete Rose from
baseball; the unprecedented meeting of Gorbachev and the pope; the
USS Iowa gun turret explosion; the death of Iran's Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini; the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan; the
plight of the hostages in Lebanon, and the election of New York
City's first black mayor and Virginia's first black governor.
   The top 10 stories:
   1. When Mikhail Gorbachev rose to power in 1985 and gave the
world two new words, glasnost and perestroika, no one could have
guessed the incredible changes that would burst forth, like a genie
from a bottle, four years later.
   But there it was in 1989: thousands standing in the streets of
Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and East Germany, demanding a
voice in government, a more open society, and eviction of the old
Communist guard. In Poland, Solidarity won an election and began to
build economic ties with the West to try to pull the country out of
poverty.
   In the Soviet Union, Gorbachev had to slow the rate of change
while he struggled to improve the economy with links to the West.
But even there, ethnic republics pressed for more independence.
East-West relations also underwent change, leading even the most
resistant American doubters wondering whatever had happened to
``the evil empire.''
   2. Beijing was hosting the first Chinese-Soviet summit in 30
years, but the historic event was upstaged by the drama unfolding
in Tiananmen Square.
   For seven weeks, the hundred-acre square had been occupied by
thousands of demonstrators, demanding greater democracy and
humiliating the government. For seven weeks, the government had
responded with tolerance and restraint.
   Then, at 2 a.m. Sunday, June 4, barely two weeks after Gorbachev
left Beijing, a convoy of trucks accompanied by 10,000 foot
soldiers of the People's Liberation Army swept through the streets
and opened fire on the crowds.
   By 5 a.m., the square was empty, except for the charred hulks of
vehicles and debris left by the protesters. Hundreds _ perhaps
thousands _ were dead.
   The United States condemned China's military crackdown on the
pro-democracy demonstrators. At year's end, controversial
fence-mending visits by National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft
were followed by signs of a warming between the two countries.
   3. Early on March 24, the tanker Exxon Valdez strayed off course
and struck a reef in Alaska, spilling 11 million gallons of crude
oil into the pristine waters of Prince William Sound.
   The spilled oil contaminated 1,000 miles of coastline and killed
tens of thousands of shore birds, including 138 bald eagles.
   Volunteers from the lower 48 states, responding to news photos
of oil-soaked otters and crippled birds, joined Alaska fishermen
hosing down beaches, rescuing wildlife and wiping off rocks, one at
a time. Ultimately, more than 2.6 million gallons of oil was
recovered.
   The worst oil disaster in U.S. history sullied Exxon's
reputation as well as Alaska's coast. It also resulted in criminal
charges against Exxon Valdez Capt. Joseph Hazelwood, 42, who was
fired amid allegations he'd been drunk at the time of the accident.
is trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 22.
   4. As 58,000 fans packed San Francisco's Candlestick Park with
21 minutes to go before the start of the World Series' third game
between the Oakland A's and the Giants, television screens across
America suddenly went black.
   The nation's next look at San Francisco was of a city in
darkness except for a fire fed by open gas lines in the Marina
District and the headlights of thousands of vehicles inching along
in countless traffic jams.

   The earthquake, centered 75 miles south of San Francisco,
measured 7.1 on the Richter scale, the strongest to hit the United
States since the Alaska quake of 1964. It lasted 15 seconds, killed
67 people and injured 3,000 others. Property damage was placed at
$7 billion.
   A 50-foot section of the Bay Bridge collapsed, as did a few
apartment buildings, and a 1.5-mile stretch of double-decker
Interstate 880 toppled onto the lower roadway, crushing cars and
trapping motorists.
   Among the safest places during the quake: San Francisco's high
rises, built to strict building codes adopted after the San
Fernando quake of 1971.
   5. When the Supreme Court opened the door for states to regulate
the standards for abortions within their borders, limiting the 1975
Roe vs. Wade decision, it also moved the battleground between
pro-choice and anti-abortion advocates to state legislatures and
state elections.
   The anti-abortion side wanted to require teen-agers to seek
permission from their parents for abortions, or married women to
seek their husband's OK. Other questions focused on the use of
federal funds for abortions.
   Pennsylvania passed the most restrictive abortion statute in the
nation. Illinois settled a suit that would have limited abortions
in that state. Virginia and New Jersey elected governors who drew
considerable support from pro-choice voters. Pro-choice advocates
in Congress were readying a federal statute to broaden abortion
rights along the lines of Roe vs. Wade.
   The issue was sure to affect state and congressional elections
in 1990.
   6. The Colombian government declared war on the druglords in
August, in response to the assassination of a leading presidential
candidate.
   Within four months, 10 middle-level drug suspects had been
extradited to the United States. Drug traffickers retaliated with a
campaign of bombings and shootings that included a Dec. 8 car-bomb
attack that killed 63 people. The government also blamed the
druglords for the Nov. 27 bombing of an Avianca jetliner near
Bogota, which killed 107.
   The government claimed a major victory in December with the
killing by security forces of Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, a
billionaire leader of Colombia's biggest cocaine gang, the Medellin
cartel, and the man accused of directing the campaign of terror.
But the euphoria over Gacha's death was tempered by fears that his
reputed partner, Pablo Escobar Gaviria, would seek retribution.
   In the United States, a record 21.4 tons of cocaine was seized
near Los Angeles and near-record amounts intercepted elsewhere.
President Bush unveiled a $7.9 billion drug control strategy, and
planned to meet with South American leaders in Colombia in February
1990.
   7. For a week in September, Hurricane Hugo cut a wide swath of
destruction along a 2,300-mile path from the Caribbean to the
Carolinas. The storm killed 56 people in the Caribbean and 40 more
on the mainland, despite an exodus of residents along the Southeast
coast.
   In hard-hit St. Croix, 90 percent of the houses and buildings
were destroyed by Hugo's 200-mph winds. Hundreds of looters
plundered stores of everything from food and clothing to VCRs and
jewelry in the aftermath of the storm, prompting President Bush to
send Army troops, FBI agents and federal marshals to restore order
in the U.S. territory. Officials say it could be spring before
power is restored. Full recovery could take years.
   In South Carolina, the storm did nearly $6 billion in damage.
Hugo demolished downtown Charleston, which had not been hit by a
major hurricane in 30 years. It also left homeless an estimated
16,000 South Carolinans, many of them beach residents who vowed to
rebuild.
   8. The scandals that rocked Congress, the Defense Department and
the Department of Housing and Urban Development seemed endless. A
congressman admitted to a brief sexual relationship with a man who
claimed to run a male prostitution ring. The speaker of the House
resigned after being cited for ethics violations. Five senators
were to be investigated for intervening with federal regulators on
behalf of a scandal-ridden savings and loan. Pentagon procurement
irregularities led to indictments, and HUD influence peddling
became a running national story.
   In three separate cases, congressmen were convicted of
money-laundering, perjury and contributing to the delinquency of a
minor.
   Finally Congress passed the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 that would
bar congressmen, but not senators, from accepting fees for
speeches, starting in 1991. In return, congressmen, but not
senators, would receive a $24,000-plus pay raise. The act also
provided substantial raises for other top executive and judicial
branch officials.
   9. The so-called thrift institutions _ the nation's savings and
loans _ turned out not to be thrifty at all. When the failures
piled up, Congress passed a $159 billion bailout bill in August and
established the Resolution Trust Corp. to oversee the rescue of the
pillaged S&amp;Ls, which had grown to 280 by the end of the year. In
December the RTC was pressing the S&amp;Ls under its control to begin
selling more than $300 billion in assets.
   The RTC had disposed of 33 of the ailing thrifts and had its eye
on 220 more.
   10. Hampered by the non-availability of secret documents, the
Iran-Contra investigation ground on, trying to unravel the scheme
by which the United States sold arms to Iran and used the proceeds
to finance pro-American guerillas in Nicaragua.
   Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, the former National Security
Council aide who won national prominence in dramatic congressional
hearings probing the arms deals, was convicted of three of 12
felony counts, including destroying or falsifying government
documents and receipt of an illegal gratuity. Punishment totaled
over $500,000 in fines and more than five years in prison.
   At year's end there were still cases pending in the Iran-Contra
investigation.

<HEAD>Oil Companies Want Spill Facts Kept Secret</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp., Alyeska Pipeline Service
Co. and other defendants in more than 150 lawsuits resulting from
the Exxon Valdez oil spill are asking that all evidence be kept
secret until the cases go to trial.
   The order, requested earlier this month, has come under fire
from the state and other plaintiffs, who contend that Alaska's
legislative responsibilities and the public's right to know demand
release of such information.
   Superior Court Judge Brian Shortell is scheduled to rule on the
secrecy order next month. Violating the secrecy order would result
in contempt charges.
   As requested by the oil companies, the order would bar all
parties from disclosing virtually anything learned during the
discovery phase of the litigation.
   It would apply to legal motions, corporate records and sworn
statements of company officials.
   Attorneys say the lawsuits may not go to trial for a decade, and
most probably will be settled out of court.
   A secrecy order could prevent the public from learning exactly
what caused the March 24 wreck of the Exxon Valdez, or why efforts
to contain and clean up the nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil
from Prince William Sound failed.
   Even the state would be forbidden to disclose what it had
learned about the spill. Critics of the request said that would
impair the ability of lawmakers and environmental officials to do a
better job of regulating the industry.
   National Wildlife Federation President Jay Hair calls the
proposed order a ``blatant and outrageous attempt to hide the facts
from the American people.''
   ``These oil companies are terrified that the public could learn
the complete details about what they have done,'' he said.
   John Anderson, a management consultant for Exxon, said release
of large quantities of internal business records could result in
disclosure of trade secrets _ even if the individual documents
contained no secrets.
   Competitors could piece together millions of bits of
information, creating a mosaic of Exxon operations that would
betray trade secrets, he said.
   Alyeska is owned by a consortium of seven oil companies that
pump about 2 million barrels of oil a day to the Valdez tanker
terminal and into tankers.
   All of the state court cases have been consolidated for pretrial
motions and discovery, the evidence-gathering stage of a lawsuit.
   Plaintiffs in the cases range from the state of Alaska, which
wants to prove Exxon and Alyeska were negligent in preparing for
and responding to the spill, to fishermen, tourism companies and
environmental groups.
   ``The idea that this will all be done behind closed doors is
unacceptable,'' said Dave Oesting, a counsel for the plaintiffs.
   The state wants Exxon and Alyeska to prove confidentiality on a
document-by-document basis.
   ``Basically, we just think this case is a uniquely public case
and affects a broad section of the public, virtually the entire
state of Alaska. And the public does have a broad right to know
what is going on,'' said Assistant Attorney General Craig Tillery.
   If Exxon obtains a blanket secrecy order, the state will seek an
exception for the Legislature and administration ``so they have
access to make policy regarding future spills,'' he said.
   Oil companies' trade secrets are protected by state and federal
rules of evidence. But courts have ruled in several major cases,
such as the Agent Orange suits and claims against cigarette makers,
that the public has a right to know.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said
Thursday he will travel to the Soviet Union in February and March,
and expected to meet with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``I have been prepared for this visit for a long time. I want to
talk about political subjects, also social subjects, but above all
I want to talk about trade unions,'' Walesa said at a news
conference in the port of Gdansk.
   Walesa said his advisers are preparing the visit, but there was
no need to rush the trip.
   The Solidarity leader traveled to Moscow for the first time Dec.
18 to attend the funeral of fellow human rights activist and Nobel
Peace Prize winner Andrei D. Sakharov.
   Solidarity activists have been developing contacts in recent
months with opposition activists both in Moscow and other major
cities in the Soviet Union.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, an adviser to Walesa when the

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Banks reopened today, the Panama
Canal resumed 24-hour operations, and a U.S. spokesman said nearly
$6 million in confiscated funds had been turned over to the new
government of President Guillermo Endara.
   The former strongman, Manuel Antonio Noriega, remained inside
the Vatican Embassy. Panama's archbishop, the Rev. Marcos McGrath,
said several of Noriega's associates left the embassy voluntarily.
   ``In general, the number has been getting lower and it will
continue to do so,'' McGrath told reporters outside the Vatican
Embassy. He said some were leaving because there were no charges
against them, and others were negotiating with the new Panamanian
government.
   A U.S. Justice Department spokesman in Washington, when asked
about the report that some had surrendered, said, ``I don't believe
so.''
   But the spokesman, David Runkel, said it's possible ``there may
have been one or more people who have left ... that may include
children.''
   Army Lt. Col. Jerry Murguia, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern
Command, said $5.82 million belonging to Noriega had been
confiscated and released to the Panamanian government.
   Officials said the Panama Canal had returned to its regular
24-hour schedule and worked through the night. The Panama Canal
Commission said 21 ships passed through Wednesday, 35 were
scheduled to go through today and another 150 were waiting for
transit.
   The canal was closed for 48 hours after the United States
invaded Dec. 20, and has been gradually increasing the hours of
operation since then.
   Murguia also said Panama City's international airport should be
reopened by Saturday. It has been closed to commercial aviation
since the invasion.
   Banks in this international financial center reopened throughout
the nation, with First Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon
appearing at a ceremony at the Central Bank.
   Endara, in a news conference Wednesday, had appealed again to
the Vatican Embassy to surrender Noriega for trial on drug
trafficking charges, but the Vatican today said it had received no
formal request from the Panamanian government and would not simply
push Noriega out and hand him over to U.S. authorities.
   ``We have not received any letter,'' said Joaquin Navarro, the
Vatican's chief spokesman.
   In Texas, President Bush said his administration was determined
to bring Noriega to the United States to stand trial, but admitted
that the Vatican's stand ``complicated things.''
   The U.S. invasion began Dec. 20 and Noriega was on the run until
appearing at the Vatican Embassy on Sunday.
   U.S. troops, armored cars and helicopters have stood watch
outside around the clock to ensure he doesn't escape or get
spirited away.
   Navarro said the Vatican still hoped to resolve the crisis
within days but he gave no details about negotiations.
   He also declined to comment about a story in today's Los Angeles
Times in which the Vatican Embassy in Panama reportedly authorized
U.S. forces to take necessary measures in the event that Noriega or
his associates take the Vatican envoy or any other staff hostage.
   The newspaper said the authorization has been interpreted by
some U.S. officials as an invitation to the United States to seize
the ousted Panamanian dictator from the embassy, while others have
said that isn't the case.
   Navarro said he couldn't comment on the report because he didn't
know the source of information for the report.
   Panama's new government hustled to restore order, screening
members of Noriega's disbanded Defense Forces and incorporating a
growing number of them into a new armed force that includes police.
   Murguia told reporters today that Lt. Col. Arnulfo Castrejon
left the embassy and was detained by U.S. forces. Castrejon was the
officer on duty at Defense Forces headquarters when Panamanian
forces fatally shot a U.S. Marine officer Dec. 16 in one of the
principal incidents leading to the U.S. invasion.
   The U.S. Southern Command said all but a few hundred of the
15,000 members of the Defense Forces had surrendered or been
arrested.
   The U.S. Justice Department asked France, Switzerland,
Luxembourg and Britain to freeze bank accounts in which Noriega is
believed to have stashed more than $10 million in ``illegal drug
money.''
   France froze accounts in two banks holding $3.3 million and
Swiss officials placed a ``precautionary'' freeze on two accounts.
   The United States and the Endara government, which was elected
in May balloting that Noriega nullified, renewed their pleas to the
Vatican to turn over the ousted military ruler.
   U.S. troops cannot go after Noriega, who was thought to be
trying to negotiate safe passage to a third country, because
embassies are inviolable under international law.
   Noriega was indicted by two federal grand juries in Florida in
February 1988 on charges of trafficking in Colombian cocaine and
money laundering.
   The Southern Command said Wednesday 23 American servicemen and
two dependents have been killed and 322 Americans wounded since the
United States invaded. It said 297 Panamanians troops were killed
and 123 wounded.
   Murguia cited an army surgeon as saying at least 250 civilians
were killed. That figure did not include others who were quickly
buried in the first days of the invasion, Murguia said.

   If there were a truth-in-packaging law for
federal spending, President Bush's forthcoming budget proposal
might have to carry this warning label: ``This plan is optimistic
at best and is likely to bear only a partial resemblance to
reality.''
   Bush is expected to propose $30 billion to $40 billion in
savings when he submits his $1.2 trillion spending blueprint for
fiscal 1991 in late January. That would meet a requirement in the
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law that the projected 1991
shortfall not exceed $64 billion.
   The numbers make the proposal sound like a tough attempt to mop
up the government's red ink, which has been about $150 billion
annually for the last three years. But a look back at how the
administration and Congress went about their budget work for this
year is instructive in assessing how the plan for next year may be
translated into reality.
   White House and legislative budget writers began the year by
agreeing to use a set of optimistic economic assumptions that let
them shrink the size of the anticipated 1990 deficit.
   By projecting 1990 economic growth of 3.4 percent and inflation
of 3.5 percent _ both of which now seem rosey _ they were able to
calculate lower government spending and higher revenues than are
likely to occur. Look for a repetition of the age-old tactic next
year.
   Fiscal planners were also able to take advantage of technical
budget rules to chip away at their projections of red ink.
   In one case, the Pentagon ``saved'' nearly $3 billion by
shifting a payday from a Monday in early October to a Friday in
late September. The reason: the new federal fiscal year begins Oct.
1.
   In another instance, of the many billions of dollars the
government expects to spend to bail out bankrupt savings and loan
associations this year, only about $1.4 billion of it will show up
on the budget. The reason: Bush and Congress agreed that the bulk
of the operation would be ``off-budget.''
   ``We did a better job than we have in most previous years in
trying to achieve some deficit reduction, but much of what we did
was to redefine or take advantage of scorekeeping options that
didn't give us real savings,'' concedes Rep. Bill Frenzel of
Minnesota, ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee.
   Last February, a month after outgoing President Reagan submitted
a proposed 1990 budget to Congress, President Bush presented a
$1.16 trillion spending plan of his own.
   Bush said his blueprint would leave a $91.1 billion deficit _
well within the $100 billion target the Gramm-Rudman law required
for fiscal 1990, which began last Oct. 1. It relied heavily on
domestic program cuts, user fees, and new revenues Bush believes
would be generated by reducing the tax rate on capital gains.
   The plan was shrugged off by Congress, which complained that
Bush failed to specify which domestic programs would be slashed.
Serious budget work did not begin until April, when administration
officials and congressional leaders agreed to a plan that would
reap a $99.4 billion shortfall.
   But when Congress adjourned for the year on Nov. 22, lawmakers
and the White House had achieved less than half of what they had
agreed to do. The two sides shook hands in April on $28 billion
worth of deficit-cutting, but in the end wrote only about $13
billion of it into law.
   ``The targets they set were modest,'' says Robert Reischauer,
director of the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, which
studies fiscal issues for lawmakers. ``And they had a difficult
time even coming to those targets.''
   Indeed, practically one-third of the $13 billion was not a true
bite out of the deficit at all, but rather book-keeping tricks and
changes in federal payment schedules.
   Budget-writers claimed savings of $1.8 billion by not counting
the money the Postal Service is likely to lose this year; $800
million by slowing the rate with which Medicare claims are paid;
and $700 million by delaying for a year some of the payments
federal retirees can collect.
   They also took credit for saving $400 million by moving some
assistance to farmers off-budget; $250 million by accelerating the
payment of gasoline and airline taxes to the government; and $50
million by delaying some federal payments to farmers.
   Few of the savings that were written into law were part of the
April budget pact, or Bush's February budget.
   The president's coveted capital gains tax reduction was gone.
And $4.6 billion of the savings _ a third of the total _ came from
letting indiscriminate cuts in most federal programs imposed by the
Gramm-Rudman law remain in effect for the first 130 days of the
fiscal year.
   The threat of those automatic cuts has been seen since the 1985
enactment of the law as a terrible alternative that would prod
Congress and the White House to work out a better deficit-reduction
deal. Now, they could become a regular part of the budget process.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alexander Dubcek, the former
Communist Party chief ousted two decades ago for leading the
``Prague Spring'' reforms, returned triumphantly to power today as
speaker of Czechoslovakia's parliament.
   In a political renaissance unimaginable only two months ago,
Dubcek was elected unanimously by 269 deputies present out of the
350-member, Communist-dominated Federal Assembly.
   The newspaper Vecerni Praha today reported that the former
Prague Communist Party boss has been in custody since Dec. 23 under
indictment on charges of abuse of power.
   Miroslav Stepan oversaw police attacks on demonstrators in
Prague in November that sparked Czechoslovakia's peaceful
revolution against its hard-line Communist leadership.
   In the parliament, Dubcek shook hands quietly with a few
colleagues and shuffled papers nervously during the vote.
   ``This is a moral satisfaction to the hundreds of thousands of
people who have upheld the ideals of the `Prague Spring,''' Dubcek
said in an address carried live on state TV.
   In 1968, Soviet-led tanks and troops crushed Dubcek's reform
movement and oversaw the installation of a hard-line Communist
leadership that ruled until the peaceful uprising began Nov. 17.
   Dubcek praised the revolution and said it was inspired by ideas
that began in 1968.
   Earlier, Dubcek sat unsmiling before the parliament as deputy
Josef Simuth praised Dubcek as a man who ``showed courage and
resolve in making a personal sacrifice for truth.''
   Simuth, who represents the Slovak district of Uhrovce where
Dubcek was born 68 years ago, said the current democraic revolution
is an outgrowth of the liberal reforms championed by Dubcek.
   Dubcek was among 23 new deputies elected by parliament today to
replace hard-liners and serve until free elections next year.
   Among the new deputies were at least five former dissidents who
signed the human rights manifesto Charter 77.
   The 35O-member Federal Assembly has been dominated for more than
four decades by the Communist Party, and the ``restructuring'' to
take place today is the latest victory by the opposition that has
overturned party control in the past two months.
   Communists will continue to hold a majority in the bicameral
parliament, although without many of the most rigid members.
   Of the 23 new deputies, only one was a member of the Communist
Party. The rest were members of other, smaller parties or were
unaffiliated members of the opposition.
   Those named to fill the seats were agreed to during negotiations
last week between the opposition, the Communist Party and several
other smaller political forces.
   Dubcek was ousted from power one year after the Soviet-led
invasion in 1968 that crushed his ``Prague Spring'' reform movement.
   The current speaker, Stanislav Kukral, resigned today.
   The election will be a vindication of the humanistic reforms
that Dubcek tried to introduce as Communist Party secretary general
in 1968. His hopes for liberalization and his political career were
crushed under the invasion that ushered in 21 years of hard-line
Communist rule.
   Dubcek was expelled from the party and sent to work as a
forestry manager in Bratislava.
   On Nov. 24, he made a triumphant comeback, speaking to 250,000
admirers gathered on Prague's Wenceslas Square for a pro-democracy
demonstration.
   Next to Vaclav Havel, the opposition leader and sole
presidential candidate, Dubcek is the second most potent symbol of
reform in Czechoslovakia and is the favorite son in his native
Slovakia.
   Havel said a condition of his accepting the presidency was that
Dubcek be ``somewhere close by my side.''
   On Friday, deputies will reconvene in special televised session
at Prague's Hradcany Castle to vote for president. Havel will be
sworn in immediately afterward.
   Deputies began the session today by amending the presidential
oath that Havel will take, eliminating a pledge of allegiance to
Socialism.

<HEAD>Swedish Couples Rushing to Walk Down Aisle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Live-in couples who have put off
marriage are rushing to wed before Jan. 1 because of a change in
the death-benefit law.
   Couples are flocking to churches and town halls to marry before
the new rules come into effect in the new year. At stake are
widow's pensions of up to $160 a month.
   ``We've performed 100 civil marriage ceremonies daily since
November. We've had to hire extra staff,'' Stockholm City Hall
official Anna Barrett said Thursday.
   Stockholm City Hall registrars used to perform about 12
marriages a week, and only on Fridays. Now they carry out six
weddings every 30 minutes, seven days a week. Couples chose between
three-minute or 20-second ceremonies.
   A clerk at the Two Hearts goldsmiths said gold rings were in
such demand that some couples had to get married without them.
``Some borrow our test-rings for the occasion and get their own
later,'' she said.
   At the Lutheran parish of Storkyrkan _ ``The Big Church'' _ in
the medieval part of Stockholm, Anna Ekstrom said more than 50
marriage ceremonies were performed this year, compared with 35 in
1988.
   Many Swedish couples prefer to live together in common-law, or
``sambo'' relationships. Cohabitation is socially accepted and
children in such families have virtually the same legal status as
children of married parents.
   ``Sambo'' is short for ``sammanboende,'' which means, ``people
living together.''
   Until now, women who took part in such relationships qualified
nearly automatically for supplementary pension benefits after their
partners died.
   Under the new rules, women who are under 45 years old and who
have children will not receive the same benefits unless they have
been legally married to their partners.
   Childless women in common-law relationships will continue to be
eligible for supplementary death benefits. But officials say many
childless couples, not fully understanding the new regulations, are
also rushing to get married.
   Maud Gardelius of the National Social Insurance Office said the
new benefits rules have made couples see the financial side of
romance.
   ``They discovered that they were not protected in the old
relationship. This change has put a spotlight on the situation,''
she said.

<TEXT>
   Premier Li Peng on Thursday ordered the People's
Armed Police to keep alert against subversion, and the Foreign
Ministry vowed that political changes in East Europe won't affect
China.
   Chinese authorities are raising defenses _ with both
surveillance and by ideological work _ against any renewal of
pro-democracy protests inspired by Romania's example.
   Work units began holding political meetings to instruct their
employees not to let the ouster of Romania's hard-line president,
Nicolae Ceausescu, shake their faith in socialism.
   More plainclothes police were seen on Beijing's college
campuses, where several anonymous, illegal posters have gone up in
the past week mocking Ceausescu and urging China to learn from
Romania.
   At Beijing University, Qinghua University, Beijing Normal
University and other colleges whose students led massive
pro-democracy protests in Beijing in the spring, Romania was the
main topic of conversation, with most students expressing joy over
Ceausescu's ouster.
   Several Chinese and Western sources said students at two
colleges planned marches to celebrate events in Romania but were
found out and stopped. The reports could not be independently
confirmed.
   The Beijing city government reiterated Thursday that it or the
central government must approve any gatherings or demonstrations in
Tiananmen Square, the focal point of the spring protests. The
central government recently approved a law making most
demonstrations illegal.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Li, party General Secretary
Jiang Zemin and top military and police officials met with the
party committee of the People's Armed Police, an armed force
separate from the army that is responsible for guarding state
installations and putting down major disturbances.
   Li paid tribute to the force for helping crush the spring
democracy movement, but added, ``China faces a long-term struggle
and we cannot afford to slacken our vigilance,'' Xinhua said.
   It said he told the force to ``firmly fight against any hostile
forces that try to subvert the socialist system in China.''
   On Wednesday, Li told a meeting of the State Council, China's
Cabinet, that ``despite the changes in the international situation,
China will maintain a firm belief in itself (and) adhere to the
socialist direction.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Jin Guihua reiterated the message
Thursday at a weekly news briefing.
   ``We are well-convinced that socialism will eventually overcome
the difficulties on its way ahead and continue to develop,'' he
said.
   ``With regard to what impact the situation in Romania and in
East Europe as a whole will have on China, I just want to say that
each country has its own circumstances.''
   Although China has maintained outward neutrality on the collapse
of Communism's monopoly of power in East Europe, Chinese and East
European sources say Chinese leaders privately regard the changes
as revisionist, or ideological backsliding.
   Chinese sources said authorities have issued a document setting
forth the line on Romania, stressing the need for sobriety and
faith in socialism.
   Work units have begun holding special meetings on the subject.
Teachers at the Beijing Normal University were called to such a
meeting Wednesday.
   Although students and foreign teachers said excitement over
Romania was high on campuses, they noted that students are busy
with end-of-term exams and will begin leaving for winter vacation
in a week, reducing chances for any efforts at protests.
   After initially maintaining silence on events in Romania, the
official Chinese media has reported Ceausescu's ouster and
execution, although tersely. It has not mentioned the reasons for
the uprising or the mass arrests and killings of civilians by
secret police, but many Chinese have heard such reports on foreign
radio broadcasts.
   Xinhua also reported that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
has sent a series of letters to Chinese leaders, with a senior
Soviet envoy presenting the latest one on Thursday.
   Xinhua did not say what was in the letters.
   The letter was given to Zemin by Valentine Falin, director of
the Soviet party's International Department.
   Xinhua said Jiang ``expressed his thanks to Falin for the letter
and to the Soviet ambassador, who had also passed on letters from
Gorbachev to Jiang and Deng Xiaoping,'' China's senior leader.
   Falin, who arrived Saturday, is the highest-ranking Soviet
official to visit Beijing since May, when Gorbachev came to
normalize state relations and restore party ties broken in the
1960s over ideological differences.

<TEXT>
   About 4,800 residents who were evacuated
after a propane explosion and fire were allowed to return to their
homes this morning when firefighters extingished the remaining
flames.
   No injuries were reported at White-Rodgers Co. when propane
surged from a faulty tank and exploded shortly before 4 p.m.
Wednesday. Workers were evacuated and people who live within a mile
of the plant were ordered from their homes, said Dale Rust of the
Independence County Office of Emergency Services.
   Officials in this town of 9,000 lifted the evacuation order
shortly after 8 a.m., and by midday a skeleton staff of about 30
had resumed work in the plant's payroll and shipping operations.
   Dean Kent, vice president for human resources for the company,
said a small amount of vapor was still leaking from the
38-foot-long tank. It was not dangerous but it prevented
investigators from immediately examining the tank.
   ``Until that completely goes out, we won't be able to determine
what happened,'' Kent said. ``Hopefully, we'll find out what caused
it and do what we can to prevent it from happening again.''
   The fire, which had burned into the night, ebbed this morning
after workers managed to shut off one of the leaking valves that
fed the flames, Mayor Jim Shirrell said.
   ``We're on our way,'' said Amy Boister of Batesville as she left
a shelter set up in a church. Her husband, Lewis, had two green
pillowcases under one arm and a worn plaid sleeping bag under his
other arm.
   Sheriff's officers began pulling back some of the roadblocks in
the evacuated area, at first only allowing residents living in
areas farthest from the plant to return. Later, everyone was
allowed back to their homes.
   Workers using gas meters had determined that there were no
significant propane vapors lingering at the plant or in the
evacuated neighborhood, while firefighters kept their hoses trained
at the tanks to cool them.
   Earlier, officials had expressed fears that the heat could set
off blasts among other nearby tanks.
   The explosion sent a large plume of smoke and fire into the sky
over the town about 80 miles northeast of Little Rock.
   Ten state troopers were sent to the city to help control
looting, after Independence County Sheriff David Hunter said there
had been some reports of burglaries in the evacuated area.
   ``We're having people ripping us off out here,'' Hunter said.
   Emergency workers withdrew from the fire site about 9 p.m. after
gas was detected in the air near the burning tank, County Judge
David Wyatt said. The eight firefighters who had been battling the
blaze retreated to Batesville High School, about a mile away.
   They left three unmanned trucks with their hoses trained on the
fire and adjacent tanks. The mayor said each of the trucks pumped
1,000 gallons of water a minute.
   ``We think we've got it stabilized right now. It should burn
itself out ... if it doesn't rupture and explode before then,''
Rust said. ``We're trying to keep the tanks cool to keep them from
rupturing.''
   Police erected roadblocks to keep people from entering the
evacuated area. Emergency officials drove through some
neighborhoods using loudspeakers to urge residents to leave.
   The eight tanks at the plant contained about 12,000 gallons of
propane, Rust said, which could inflict damage within a mile if it
all exploded.
   The fire was burning about 500 gallons of propane an hour, he
estimated.
   Several churches opened facilities to accommodate people forced
from their homes, Rust said.
   Spokesmen at the city's three motels said they had rented nearly
all of their total of 216 rooms, about half of them to evacuees.
   Officials do not know what caused the tank to rupture and
explode, Rust said.
   The plant, a division of Emerson Electric, manufactures water
heater and gas controls and employs about 1,000 people.

   The White House said today the fate
of ousted Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega is now ``in the
hands of the Vatican,'' although President Bush's spokesman said
U.S. troops surrounding the Vatican embassy are prepared to move in
if hostages are taken.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that the U.S.
position on Noriega, who is holed up in the Panama City papal
nunciature with several supporters, remains the same:``We believe
that he is, as an indicted person, a criminal and not a poliical
refugee in the normal sense of someone who seeks political asylum.''
   However, the spokesman suggested negotiations on Noriega remain
delicate.
   ``We continue to make our views known, the Vatican continues to
consider this matter, and we leave it to them to work this out as
they see fit,'' he said.
   ``This matter is now in the hands of the Vatican,'' said
Fitzwater, briefing reporters in Corpus Christi as Bush enjoyed a
hunting vacation on an isolated ranch near the south Texas
community of Beeville.
   Asked about a reported letter from the papal representative in
Panama City saying U.S. troops could go into the embassy if a
hostage situation arose, Fitzwater said:
   ``We have no indication there is trouble within the nunciature.
There are no hostages that we're aware of.''
   But, he added, ``Certainly, would there be any danger there, we
would be prepared to offer assistance to help.
   Noriega has been in the Vatican embassy since Christmas Eve.
   Fitzwater said that, altough some Noriega loyalists that had
been in the embassy with Noriega have been released to U.S.
authorities, ``most of his cronies are still there.''
   Fitzwater said that, overall, ``the situation is good and
steadily improving'' in Panama, with the U.S.-backed government of
Guillermo Endara ``continuing to expand its control.''
   Although Bush has voiced continued determination to have Noriega
returned to the United States, administration officials said
privately that little headway has been apparent in prying Noriega
from the Vatican Embassy to face drug trafficking charges in the
United States, and they expressed some frustration at the pace of
negotiations.
   ``I want to see this man who is under indictment brought to
justice for poisoning the children of the United States of America
and people around the world,'' Bush said at a barbecue held in
Beeville Wednesday night in his honor.
   The president and fellow Texan, Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, are spending the next few days quail hunting on the
10,000-acre ranch of William Farish, a wealthy Houston oilman and
longtime Bush friend.
   Bush, who has been coming to Texas for a holiday season quail
hunt annually for more than two decades, thanked the crowd of more
than 700 people ``for this homecoming.''
   Fitzwater said Bush was receiving briefings in writing and by
phone on any developments in Panama, but otherwise intended to
spend the day hunting.
   ``Look, I don't make any cover. I'm going to be enjoying myself
and I think the American people understand that,'' Bush told
reporters on his arrival at the Corpus Christi Naval Air Station.
   The president spent several hours fishing on nearby San Jose
Island, where he said he and Baker caught about a half-dozen fish.
   Meanwhile, Justice Department officials are planning to ask
``one or two'' more European countries to freeze bank accounts
where Noriega is thought to have hidden illegal drug profits,
spokesman David Runkel said today.
   Similiar requests were made Wednesday to the governments of four
nations _ France, Luxembourg, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
Runkel said those governments are cooperating.
   Authorities in France responded by freezing accounts in two
banks holding $3.3 million under the names of Noriega and members
of his families. Swiss officials placed a ``precautionary'' freeze
on two accounts in banks in Zurich and Geneva.
   Speaking to reporters in Corpus Christi, Bush congratulated
Romania's new president, Ion Iliescu, and said he was ``amazed and
respectful'' of the changes there.
   ``My concern is for tranquility and freedom in Romania,'' Bush
said.
   He declined to criticize harshly the quick executions of former
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife, adding, ``We did say that
we were concerned that the trial of Ceausescu should have been more
open, but that's their matter.''

   Fourteen mothers who were once on
welfare have found jobs doing what they know best _ being moms.
   The women have been taken off government assistance and receive
$21,000 annual salaries for being foster mothers to disabled
children under a state program called LIFE, or Living in Family
Environments.
   ``These women are capable of doing something, but for the most
part they're best at being moms, and they're happy being moms,''
said state Rep. Shirley Johnson, who helped win funding for the
program.
   ``I was scared to death at the beginning _ how would you match
the right mom with the right child? But it has worked beautifully.''
   The 3-year-old program, which operates primarily on a $200,000
grant from the state Department of Mental Health, was the idea of
Mounir Sharobeem, president of the Judson Center in Royal Oak, a
Detroit suburb. The center helps abused and neglected children and
disabled adults.
   ``Instead of stereotyping welfare recipients as lazy, let's
train the families, let them select a developmentally disabled
child and use their time and energy more effectively,'' Sharobeem
said.
   ``People said we would be endangering handicapped children by
putting them with welfare families. But these families have been
doing a great job with them, and it's not easy.''
   Sharobeem said one disabled child in an institution costs the
Mental Health Department $45,000 a year. A welfare family of four
costs the Department of Social Services $16,000 a year.
   The children are also given more personal care inside a home,
even though most of the mothers are single parents, Sharobeem said.
   The mothers are screened and licensed by the Judson Center and
receive training in caring for disabled children, said Diane
Devine-Abdullah, LIFE director.
   ``They go through a seven-day, 28-hour training, then 20 hours
home training in a current foster home,'' Devine-Abdullah said.
``We have four more families ready and waiting for placement.''
   The mothers are then matched with children from Michigan
institutions. The average age of most of the children is between 15
and 16, Devine-Abdullah said.
   DSS Director C. Patrick Babcock said the state is looking to
expand the program. But Johnson said budget constraints won't allow
a full-scale program.
   One mother, Darlene Gisel of Warren, cares for 11-month-old
William, who was born with tuberculosis of the brain. The condition
was stabilized but could result in a learning disability or
retardation.
   ``He was in the hospital six months before I took him,'' Gisel
said. ``He didn't respond at all. He's gotten farther than they
ever thought he would.
   ``There's a lot of joy in watching them grow. These are kids who
probably wouldn't have had a chance in life.''
   Gisel said her mother also was a foster mom and worked with
handicapped children.
   ``I knew I wanted to deal with handicapped kids,'' she said.
``They need a little more of a chance. I think we can show that
they can learn and they can live a normal life with a disability.''
   Mothers in the LIFE program also find that the salary allows
them to provide more for their own children.
   Bertha Crawford is foster mother to Dorothy, 17, who can't dress
herself and can't talk. Crawford also has two high-school-age
children of her own.
   ``I feel good about helping someone else,'' Crawford said. ``It
also gave me the chance to send my daughter on her senior trip. I
couldn't have afforded it without the program.''

   President Bush is completing plans to have the
U.S. military interdict drug supply routes from Latin America, the
White House said today. A defense official said one proposal
includes drawing a ``much, much tighter noose'' around Colombia
with a virtual air and sea blockade.
   Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, confirmed that ``final plans
are now being made'' to interdict ``supply routes in South and
parts of Central America,'' but he offered no specifics.
   The overall program is evolving from proposals that senior
military commanders submitted to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. He,
in turn, relayed them to the White House.
   Fitzwater, speaking with reporters today in Corpus Christi,
Texas, confirmed that Bush is mapping plans to use the U.S.
military to disrupt the drug supply routes from Latin America.
   ``We have decided to take certain actions to help the countries
of Latin America interdict those supply routes,'' he said. ``We are
anxious to work closely with Colombia. Whatever actions we would
undertake in this regard will be done with the closest consultation
with them and coordination with them.''
   Bush is slated to attend an anti-drug summit in Colombia in
February.
   Although the military's interdiction operation could be launched
before the summit, the senior defense official declined to offer a
start-up date for the maneuver.
   ``It's supposed to be a big-time operation,'' said the official,
who spoke on condition on anonymity. ``We want to make it
impossible for any drugs to come out of there by air or sea.''
   The operation would involve positioning an aircraft carrier
battle group and its accompanying air wing off the Caribbean coast
of the South American country, the source said in a recent
interview.
   The Pentagon official stressed that there would be no question
of U.S. military shooting down planes flown by suspected drug
dealers.
   ``There are no plans to start blowing people out of the sky,''
the official said. ``The role would be one of support and focus on
forming a much, much tighter noose.''
   The official said the plan was being formulated in cooperation
with the Colombian government and is not designed to impede the
export of legal products.
   The official cautioned there were problems involved in such an
effort. First of all, he said, the plan could be delayed because
the U.S. military's attention has been diverted by the Panama
invasion.
   And ``one weak link'' in the massive operation could be the
hand-off to Colombian authorities, who are expected to take up the
enforcement role, he said.
   In addition, the official pointed out, because the drug problem
is so pervasive, the drug lords most certainly will choose more
land routes to move their illicit products.
   ``They've got a lot of money and they're not fools,'' the
official said. ``We know this is a hydraulic problem. No sooner do
you squeeze and close off one route than it spurts out through
another.''
   The official said the plan could be altered by the president.
   The maneuver targets Colombia ``because that country is one of
the major flow points (for drugs). We are proposing a virtual air
and sea blockade,'' the official said.
   The Navy will play the key role in the operation, the official
said, because of its ability to put airborne warning and control
planes, E-2C ``Hawkeyes,'' in the air from carriers.
   Such planes, with saucer-like radar equipment mounted on their
frames, are able to keep tabs on drug-smuggling suspects in planes
or ships because they can track surface and air targets over a wide
region.
   The anti-drug summit is slated to be held in Cartagena, a port
city 680 miles north of Bogota. It is located in a Medellin cartel
stronghold in a country ravaged by bombings and assassinations
since Colombian President Virgilio Barco declared war on the drug
traffickers three months ago.
   Peru has decided to resume joint anti-drug operations with the
United States a week after canceling the activities as a protest of
the U.S. military intervention in Panama, U.S. and Peruvian
officials said Wednesday.
   The Peruvian Embassy said joint operations resumed because ``the
fight against drugs is so important.'' Last week, Peru also
canceled plans to participate in the summit.

   Two fights broke out among Vietnamese at a

police said.
   The cause of the fights, which police said were quickly ended by
police and involved about 150 men, was not clear.
   The injured were hospitalized and police were investigating. No
one was arrested.
   In the last few months, many fights have broken out among the
Vietnamese, but all were brought under control quickly by the
police.
   About 56,000 Vietnamese boat people are housed in squalid camps
in Hong Kong. About 12,000 of them who arrived before June 1988 are
considered refugees eligible for resettlement, but those who
arrived after that are being screened. If they are classified as
illegal immigrants, they must either go back home voluntarily or be
repatriated by force to Vietnam.
   More than 50 were repatriated against their wishes earlier this
month.

   President Bush on Thursday voiced
sympathy for victims of a strong earthquake that rocked
southeastern Australia.
   In a message to Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke, Bush
expressed ``condolences at the loss of life and the destruction of
property,'' according to White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater.
   The quake crumbled buildings and homes in the vicinity of
Newcastle, Australia, an industrial hub 75 miles north of Sydney.
   Reports suggested at least 11 people were killed, and possibly
as many as 30, with more than 120 injured in the quake which
measured 5.5 on the Richter scale.

   A strong earthquake today crumbled
buildings and homes in this southeastern city, killing at least 11
people and injuring more than 120, officials said. The army was
called in to help prevent looting.
   Some reports said as many as 30 people died in Newcastle, an
industrial hub of 500,000 people about 75 miles north of Sydney.
Hundreds of thousands of homes were reported without electricity
and phone service was cut off. An insurance official estimated
damage at $1 billion.
   Rescue workers frantically hunted for victims in the rubble.
Severe damage was reported.
   The quake, which measured 5.5 on the Richter scale, struck at
10:28 a.m. and lasted 45 seconds. Police said it was the first in
Australian history to strike a heavily populated area.
   ``It felt like there was someone under my bedroom floor who
lifted the house,'' said one Newcastle resident, who reported two
aftershocks.
   The worst damage appeared to be at the Newcastle Workers' Club
where drinkers, relaxing after night-shift work, were crushed by
collapsed walls, police said. At least eight people died there,
police spokesman Simon Latimer said. Police recovered five bodies
and were working to free three others.
   There could be at least another six still trapped in the
building, Latimer said.
   ``It just shook and everything just caved in, the walls caved
in. Everything inside the club. Piping, machines going down every
way,'' an eyewitness at the workers' club told broadcasters.
   ``The room just shook, everybody just got thrown onto the floor.
It went black. We were all told to get out, there was a bomb in
there.''
   Three people were killed in a suburban shopping center when they
were hit by bricks and awnings from shops, Latimer said. Police
said 122 people were injured.
   Police Inspector Kenneth Holmes, commanding the police rescue
operation, said he expected the death toll to rise.
   ``I saw at least six people lying in the road,'' said a shocked
emergency worker in the city. ``As we looked back, we could see
destruction all around us. The second story of the carpark also
gave way, bringing the structure down and crushing scores of cars.''
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke visited the scene and condemned reports
of widespread looting in the business section. He warned that
looters would be punished.
   Latimer said 200 soldiers were called into the city and to the
suburb of Hamilton to help police patrols. Medical crews were
airlifted from Sydney for the emergency.
   Newcastle, Australia's sixth-largest city, also is a major coal
mining center but there were no immediate reports of any miners
trapped or injured underground.
   The Insurance Council of Australia put damages at $1 billion.
Council chief John Westmore described the figure as ``a very early
estimate.''
   Many buildings were reduced to rubble. The Newcastle Hospital
reported major structural damage and doctors treated the injured on
the grass outside.
   ``Ambulances are reporting lots of devastation, lots of damage,
lots of injuries,'' a spokeswoman for the Child Care organization
was quoted as saying by the Australian Associated Press.
   The quake was felt across New South Wales, Australia's most
populous state. There was a short jolt in Sydney but the temblor
lasted 45 seconds in some places; Newcastle and the adjoining
Hunter Valley wine growing region were hardest hit.
   Vicki Klein, a seismologist at the Australian Seismological
Center in the federal capital of Canberra, said: ``If the quake had
struck right in Sydney it would have brought down (high-rise)
buildings. They are simply not built to withstand something of this
magnitude.''
   Bureau of Mineral Resources Associate Director Peter Cook said
the quake was unusually large for Australia and warned of
aftershocks.
   A quake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale can cause
considerable damage. The scale is a gauge of the energy released by
an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   In Canberra, a spokesman for the Australian Seismological Center
put the quake's epicenter at 50 miles northwest of Sydney.
   The Australian Broadcasting Corp. said hundreds of thousands of
homes lost electricity as a result of the quake.
   ``Many homes, banks, shops and stores have been demolished,''
its report said. ``There is severe damage.''
   A traffic control officer said Sydney's Harbor Bridge shook for
three seconds during the quake. He said the windows, desks, and
computer screens in the office built into the bridge shook.
   The quake was the second disaster to hit Australia during the
Christmas season. Last week, a bus crash claimed 36 lives, the
country's worst road crash.
   In London, Queen Elizabeth II offered sympathy to relatives of
the victims and said she was praying for rescuers searching for
trapped victims.

<HEAD>Army Orders Inquiry in Shooting of Four Palestinians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LaBELLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army ordered an investigation into the
shooting of four Palestinian youths who reportedly were fired on
early Thursday as they drove a donkey cart to market in the Gaza
Strip.
   The youths, age 12 to 16, were among 10 Palestinians reported
shot and wounded by troops in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip. The 12-year-old boy was in serious condition.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, a leaflet signed by PLO chief
Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction called for a halt to the killing of
accused collaborators with Israel and said only Arafat had
authority to order such slayings.
   The slayings of 163 Palestinians by fellow Arabs during the
2-year-old uprising have prompted Israeli charges that Arafat is
using the label ``collaborators'' to get rid of political
opponents. Palestinians deny the accusation.
   At least 640 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis during
the revolt, and 43 Israelis have been slain.
   Thursday's shooting of four Palestinians by soldiers came
shortly after 3:30 a.m. in Gaza City.
   An army spokesman said an initial report indicated soldiers
opened fire on four masked Palestinians. It said the Palestinians
were barricading a road, refused orders to halt and ignored warning
shots in the air.
   But the spokesman, who was not identified under army
regulations, said an investigation was ordered into whether
soldiers acted properly following Arab reports the four victims
were driving a cart to a wholesale vegetable market.
   One of the youths said neither he nor his companions were
wearing masks, but that one of the wounded youths ran away in fear
as the soldiers approached.
   Arab reporters said the 16 year old who was driving the cart
went to the market each morning to pick up vegetables to sell door
to door. One reporter said he counted 10 gunshots after being
awakened by the soldiers' fire. He said the donkey was killed.
   One of the boys, Khaled Salim Shawwa, 12, was in serious
condition with gunshot wounds to the chest and stomach.
   In the biblical town of Bethlehem, paramilitary border police
shot and seriously wounded Fadi Khalil Zabagli, 18, during a
protest. The army said he was wearing a mask.
   An army statement said one youth was shot when soldiers opened
fire at the eight Palestinians, who were armed with axes and ran
away despite orders to halt and warning shots.
   Army regulations allow soldiers to open fire at the legs of
masked men if they disregard such warnings and flee.
   The Fatah plea against killing suspected collaborators came
after earlier leaflets by PLO-backed uprising leaders failed to
stop such killings, especially in Nablus, where masked attackers
have shot, stabbed or beaten to death 20 Palestinians.
   ``In the name of the brother, the leader, the president Yasser
Arafat, we call on national forces and all our organizational units
to stop immediately and finally the killings of collaborators,''
said the leaflet signed by the Fatah unit in Nablus.
   ``Only the president of the state of Palestine has the authority
to issue a decree to execute collaborators,'' it said. Arafat was
named president of the self-declared Palestinian state by the PLO's
parliament in November 1988.

actor.
   ``They've established my character as Mr. Big, (which) is not
true at all,'' Mark Miller, 63, said by telephone Wednesday from

   Susan Schafer, an attorney for the producer of the movie, the

``Rock Hudson'' is scheduled for broadcast Jan. 8 on ABC.
   Miller said he believes the script is being used to support an
account of Hudson's final years by Marc Christian, the star's
lover. Hudson died of AIDS in 1985.
   Christian sued the Hudson estate, saying the actor should have
revealed to Christian that he was infected with the AIDS virus. He
was awarded $21.7 million, which was cut to $5.5 million. The case
is under appeal.

   Rebels fighting for 14 years to turn
Ethiopia into a Stalinist state claim to have captured three key
towns and are making perhaps their biggest push yet against the
foundering government's dispirited forces.
   The rebels claim to be battling the Marxist government's troops
along the nation's main north-south highway and are fighting within
100 miles of the capital of Addis Ababa, Western diplomats said
Thursday.
   The escalating bloodshed comes as a devastating drought
threatens to bring famine to 4 million people, most of them in
northern Ethiopia, where the rebels are based.
   The rebels, the Tigre People's Liberation Front, say that in the
last 10 days they have captured the garrison town of Debre Tabor in
northwest Gonder province and the towns of Rabel and Mehal Meda in
Shoa province.
   Addis Ababa is located in Shoa province.
   Those battles, the insurgents said, have caused the government
nearly 3,000 dead, wounded or captured soldiers.
   Diplomats in Addis Ababa say the claims appear to be true and
that the rebels now are in control of the 25-mile road from Debre
Tabor to Lake Tana, source of the Blue Nile.
   They say the rebels also are continuing their southern push in
Shoa and are battling government troops along the main north-south
highway around Debre Sine, 100 miles northeast of Addis Ababa.
   ``It obviously looks like things are hotting up,'' said one of
the diplomats, all of whom spoke in telephone interviews from Addis
Ababa and requested anonymity. ``But what's going to happen, no one
knows.''
   The rebels claimed the battle for Debre Tabor, where the
government garrison has been increased to 10,000 to 15,000 troops,
was the beginning of a government counteroffensive to drive the
rebels back.
   However, the diplomats were doubtful the government could muster
much resistance.
   ``I don't think we're looking at much of a government
counteroffensive at all, if they're even capable of making one,''
said one diplomat. ``The government hasn't succeeded in pushing
them back to any degree.''
   The source said President Mengistu Haile Mariam's army,
disorganized and dispirited after a failed army-led coup attempt in
May, had been reinforced by hundreds of thousands of poorly trained
conscripts ``of dubious quality.''
   ``I think the best they might be able to do is hold the rebels
in position,'' he said.
   The Tigrean rebels began their offensive in August after joining
forces with a smaller rebel group, the Ethiopia People's Democratic
Movement.
   They control all of their home province, Tigre, and have made
significant advances into Tigre's southern neighbor, Wollo. In the
last two months they also have moved into Gonder and Shoa provinces.
   ``They've proven to be much stronger, much more coherent than
they were believed to be several months ago,'' said one of the
diplomats. ``They've basically rolled over one government position
after another.''
   The Tigrean rebels have been fighting for 14 years to topple
Mengistu's Marxist government. They themselves are Marxists who say
they want a government modeled after Albania's harsh
Stalinist-Leninist rule.
   Mengistu's government and the rebels have held two rounds of
preliminary peace talks, the last of which ended Dec. 19 in Rome
with both sides agreeing to meet in March.
   However, the peace talks ``don't appear to be going very far
now,'' said a diplomat who pointed out that the latest offensive
began immediately after the negotiating sessions ended.
   He said there was speculation that the Tigrean rebels had
launched their ``one-two'' attack in Gonder and northern Shoa in
coordination with another rebel group, the Eritrean People's
Liberation Front.
   The diplomat said sources in the capital understood the Eritrean
front was planning an offensive in their province of Eritrea and
that the Tigre rebels were effectively pinning down government
forces in preparation for that attack.
   The Eritrean rebels, who have been fighting a 28-year
secessionist battle for Eritrea, Ethiopia's northernmost province,
fought their last major offensive in mid-1988. That push also was
coordinated with the Tigre rebels and resulted in the Eritrean
rebels gaining much of Eritrea.
   In addition to the fighting, the United Nations says northern
Ethiopia is again the scene of drought and famine.
   On Wednesday, the United Nations called for an ``international
relief operation of major proportions'' and appealed for 700,000
tons of food to prevent a repeat of the 1984-85 famine that killed
an estimated 1 million.
   Relief agencies have so far unsuccessfully appealed to the
rebels and Ethiopia's government to agree on air and ground
corridors through which supplies can move, unhindered by fighting.

   All Robert Cooper wanted to do was start a
ruckus, get arrested and spend one of Florida's coldest nights in a
warm jail cell.
   But police say the unemployed roofer went too far and now faces
up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.
   Cooper, 36, who has lived in several Florida cities since moving
from the North in September, said he came up with the idea of
getting arrested Saturday night while sitting in a grocery store in
this Orlando suburb.
   ``I figured I would get arrested for disturbing the peace,''
Cooper said. ``I did not want to get arrested for doing anything
violent.''
   Because of a power failure, police were directing traffic at the
busy intersection near the store. Cooper walked into the road,
refused to leave and wound up hitting an officer in the mouth
during a scuffle, police said.
   He was charged with battery on an officer and resisting arrest
with violence.
   Cooper denied hitting the officer, claiming that he himself was
punched in the head.
   He said that before the scuffle, he asked police to take him to
jail but that they refused.
   ``No way in the world I would even think about hitting a police
officer,'' he said Thursday from jail.
   Police Lt. Butch Yelvington said Cooper never asked police for
their help. Officers would have tried to get him transportation to
a shelter if he had, Yelvington said. ``All he asked for was to go
to jail,'' he said.
   Cooper, whose next court appearance is in mid-January, said: ``I
guess my idea backfired. I had no idea I would have to spend this
much time in jail.''

<HEAD>Dubcek Elected Leader of Parliament</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alexander Dubcek, the champion of
the ``Prague Spring'' reforms, triumphantly returned to power
Thursday as the leader of parliament after two decades in forced
obscurity.
   ``This is a moral satisfaction to the hundreds of thousands of
people who have upheld the ideals'' of political pluralism and
individual freedom, Dubcek told legislators after he was
unanimously elected by the 269 deputies present.
   The televised vote by the Communist-dominated 350-member Federal
Assembly for a man ousted and banished by authorities would have
been unimaginable just two months ago.
   Dubcek's political renaissance is just the latest in a series of
historic political victories for Czechoslovakia's pro-democracy
movement. Since mid-November, it has ousted the hard-line Communist
leadership and installed a reform government dominated by
non-Communists.
   Czechoslovakia's changes have come amid democratic reforms in
Poland, Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria and Romania this year.
   On Friday, the parliament was to meet Prague's Hradcany Castle
to elect playwright and opposition leader Vaclav Havel as
president. Havel is to be inaugurated immediately after the vote.
   Deputies voted Thursday to amend the presidential oath to be
taken by Havel to eliminate the pledge of allegiance to socialism.
   In his acceptance speech before parliament, Dubcek praised the
peaceful revolution as a continuation of the reforms that began in
1968 and were crushed by a Soviet-led invasion.
   ``The deep changes in society ... have resulted in my return to
responsible work in the highest legislative body in the land,''
Dubcek said. ``The autumn of 1989 developed the ideals of the
Prague Spring of 1968 and inspires our nation today toward new
creative actions.''
   After the Soviet-led invasion, Dubcek was ousted as Communist
Party chief, expelled from the party and sent to work as a forestry
manager in Bratislava where he was kept under police surveillance.
Although renowned abroad, he was excluded from the state-controlled
media in Czechoslovakia.
   He recaptured the spotlight Nov. 24, speaking to 250,000
pro-democracy demonstrators on Prague's Wenceslas Square.
   Next to Havel, Dubcek is the second most powerful symbol of
reform in Czechoslovakia and is the favorite son in his native
Slovakia.
   Dubcek's role in the new government was decided during intense
negotiations between the opposition, representatives of the
Communist Party and members of smaller parties and political
groups. The talks also produced a list of new deputies to replace
23 hard-line Communists who resigned.
   The government is to serve until elections are held next year,
possibly in July.
   Parliament voted Thursday to amend the constitution to allow the
appointment of the new deputies, including Dubcek.
   Only one of the 23 new deputies is a Communist Party member. The
others are members of smaller parties or are independent, although
Communist Party members will continue to hold the majority until
free elections.
   Communist Party leaders Ladislav Adamec and Vasil Mohorita sent
a message of congratulations to Dubcek and said the ideals of 1968
are a ``source of political inspiration for the Party's new
policies of democratic socialism.''
   The Prague daily Vecerni Praha reported Thursday the first
arrest of a major Communist Party figure since the revolution.
   Miroslav Stepan, ousted Prague Communist Party boss, was being
held in custody following his arrest Dec. 23, the newspaper
reported.
   ``Stepan was indicted for preparing the criminal act of abuse of
power of a public official,'' the newspaper reported, quoting the
General Prosecutor's office.
   If convicted, Stepan faces up to 10 years in prison.
   Stepan was in charge of police actions against demonstrators in
January in Prague and was held largely responsible for the violent
police crackdown on students Nov. 17 which sparked the revolution.
   Together with former Communist party leader Milos Jakes, Stepan
was expelled from the party Dec. 12 ``for serious political
mistakes.''

   Romanians still learning to openly
question their government said Thursday they are nervous about the
number of former Communists leading their revolution.
   Less than a week after Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was
overthrown, captured and executed by a popular revolt, Romanians
are sure of only one thing: they won't turn back.
   ``We will continue the revolution until we get democracy,'' said
Valentin Hornicar, who was with the student protesters occupying
the Communist Party's Central Committee building.
   ``We want a real democracy with a government and an opposition.
There is no way back. We suffered too much,'' he said.
   Romania's interim government is a group of intellectuals,
dissidents and disaffected former Communist officials who call
themselves the National Salvation Committee.
   The committee has promised free elections by April and has
repealed some of Ceausescu's most repressive laws.
   ``I don't trust this government because it includes Communists.
They turned once, they could turn again,'' said Hornicar, 26.
   ``This is the symbol of power in this country,'' he said,
gesturing to the massive Central Committee building.
   ``We want the government to come here and say who elected
them,'' Hornicar said. ``They think that if they change some of
Ceausescu's hated laws that will be enough. It is not enough.''
   Others offered support to the interim government but tempered it
with concern about former Communists in its ranks.
   ``Not all the people have made up their minds on this thing,''
said Aurel Palea, a computer technician.
   ``I trust this government,'' he said. ``But there are Communist
members in this government. We only hope they want to help and to
make something for this country.''
   The National Salvation Committee decided at a meeting last night
to separate government from political functions, with the committee
itself acting as a makeshift legislature, Western diplomats said.
   The diplomats, who asked not to be further identified, said the
fluid membership of the committee originally consisting of 37
people, had been expanded to 101, including representatives from
all of Romania's 40 regions.
   The committee includes some prominent ex-Communists who had been
ousted or demoted for criticizing Ceausescu. They include newly
chosen President Ion Iliescu, former Foreign Minister Corneliu
Manescu and Silviu Brucan, former ambassador to the United States.
   Another leading member is Dumitru Mazilu, a diplomat under house
arrest for most of the last two years because he refused to doctor
a report for the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva.
   Other prominent members are grass-roots dissidents, such as
University Professor Doina Cornea, clergyman Laszlo Toekes and poet
Mircea Dinescu.
   But even Dinescu was a member of the Communist Party until last
spring.
   Diplomats note that Communist Party membership was virtually
automatic for anybody in leading positions.
   ``The Communists are compromised. Communism made it to power
with terrorism, and now it must be destroyed everywhere. The people
will not be fooled again,'' said Gheorghe Tagarta, 40.
   But university librarian Ion Visoiu said in Romania everyone had
to be a Communist of a sort just to work.
   ``You can't compare us with the other Eastern European countries
that have changed. They did it more slowly. Their opposition was
better organized.
   ``Structurally, we are still peasants. We still think like
peasants. We will make a lot of political mistakes, but in time we
will have a good thing,'' he said.
   Visoiu said he has confidence in Iliescu and the new government,
and he said it is trying to recruit the best experts to run the
country.
   ``My worry is that the enthusiasm of the moment will pass too
soon,'' Visoiu said.

<HEAD>Cease-Fire Between Rival Shiite Moslem Forces Collapses</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KFAR MELKI, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem militiamen traded
grenade-throwing assaults behind artillery and tank cannon barrages
in south Lebanon Thursday, hours after agreeing to a cease-fire
organized by Iran.
   The upsurge of hostilities at midday around this hamlet came on
the sixth day of heavy fighting that has left 46 people killed and
187 wounded.
   Police said no new casualties were reported from the fighting
between the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the
pro-Syrian Amal militia.
   The two factions have been vying for more than two years for
control of the 1.2 million Shiites who make up the largest sect
among Lebanon's four million population.
   Amal leader Nabih Berri visited the frontline at Kfar Meshki and
said his militia was determined to evict Hezbollah from two
villages captured when the fighting erupted Saturday.
   ``The fate of south Lebanon is being decided at this region,''
Berri told reporters as he climbed out of his bulletproof
limousine, toting an AK-47 assault rifle.
   ``We will stop shooting only when they (Hezbollah) return to
their original lines,'' said Berri, who doubles as minister of
water and hydraulic resources in the Lebanese government.
   His fighters unleashed thunderous rocket barrages from
multibarreled launchers at Hezbollah positions on the eastern
flanks of Kfar Melki as he spoke. Palls of black smoke billowed
from the targets.
   Iran's first deputy foreign minister, Mohammed Ali Besharati,
negotiated the truce, which began Wednesday night. The fighting
resumed 12 hours later.
   Besharati held a new round of talks with Hezbollah and Amal
leaders Thursday to try to shore up the cease-fire.
   In another development, Beirut's Moslem sector observed a
two-hour strike as the Lebanese Communist Party buried members
killed in Israel's ground and air attacks two days ago.
   Schools, shops, cafes, restaurants and other businesses were
closed throughout west Beirut as party members carried the coffins
of seven slain colleagues through the streets to a mosque before
burial.
   ``Your blood will be avenged!'' and ``The enemy will pay
heavily!'' shouted thousands of mourners as the procession,
escorted by long lines of armed militiamen, reached the mosque.
   The seven were among 12 people killed in separate ground and air
attacks against the Communist guerrilla base in southeast Lebanon
and a party command post in the coastal town of Rmeile south of
Beirut.
   Two other victims were buried at their south Lebanon hometown of
Kfar Meshki on Thursday shortly before the upsurge of
Amal-Hezbollah fighting nearby. The three remaining fatalities were
civilians.

   Flooding worsened through Brazil's
normally arid northeastern region, forcing more than 200,000 people
to flee their homes, many by canoes and rowboats, a civil defense
official said Thursday.
   At least 24 people drowned or were buried by mudslides or
collapsing houses, according to unofficial reports.
   Rain-swollen rivers overflowed and hit 175 cities and towns in
eight of Brazil's 26 states, civil defense spokesman Silvio Reiner
said by telephone from Brasilia, the capital, 745 miles northwest
of Rio.
   In northeastern Bahia state, 105,000 people were driven from
their homes after more than two weeks of heavy rain, he said.
   Worst hit was the historic city of Cachoeira, 930 miles
northeast of Rio. The Paraguacu River overflowed and covered much
of the city, considered a national historic monument for its 18th
century Portuguese colonial houses and churches.
   Many of the 20,000 residents evacuated their homes by small
boats, taking whatever belongings they could carry. Police said
looters broke into stores and houses by boat, entering through
second-story windows.
   In Minas Gerais state, south of Bahia, 26,170 people were driven
from their homes and 6,417 houses were damaged or destroyed, Reiner
said.
   Schools and government buildings in many towns were converted
into temporary shelters. Air Force planes flew emergency shipments
of 200 tons of food, 5,000 blankets and 5,000 sleeping mats to the
hardest-hit areas, he said.
   The Health Ministry shipped a ton of medicine to combat typhoid
fever, pneumonia and dysentery, he said.
   Globo TV said floodwaters washed out a section of Highway 316,
the main road between northern Para state and the northeast region.
Interstate buses reportedly were forced to detour up to 600 miles.
   The weather bureau forecast more rain in the next 48 hours,
Reiner said.
   The rains have nearly filled reservoirs, the government's
northeastern regional electric company announced.

<HEAD>Black High School Seniors Suffer Highest Failure Rate Since 1962</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only 42 percent of South
Africa's black high school seniors passed their final exams, the
lowest rate since 1962, and only one of 190,081 youths who took the
tests got an ``A'' average, the government said Thursday.
   Bernhard Louw, director-general of the Department of Education
and Training, described the results as ``unsatisfactory.'' Among
the causes, he said, were a rapid growth in the number of black
pupils and the lingering effects of classroom boycotts that were
widespread during nationwide political unrest in 1984-86.
   A total of 74,249 black students passed the exams last month,
including 17,553 who did well enough to qualify for automatic
admission to universities, Louw said. Last year, 54 percent of
170,966 black exam takers passed, including 27,865 who qualified
for university admission, and in 1987 the overall pass rate was
56.3.
   The most recent year with a lower pass rate was 1962, when only
910 black students took the exams and 60 percent failed.
   Nationwide exam results for South Africa's three other official
race groups _ white, Indian and mixed-race _ have not yet been
released. But in Transvaal, the most populous province, 96.9
percent of the white students and 72.7 of the mixed-race students
passed the exams.
   Louw said one reason for the poor results at black schools was a
new grading policy aimed at ensuring that students from all race
groups were graded by identical standards. In the past, Louw said,
officials overseeing black education set their own grading
regulations.
   ``In view of the drastic effect'' of this policy, Louw said, the
government has ordered an urgent ``in-depth analysis of the
examination results.''
   Louw said several other factors contributed to the poor test
results, including an average annual increase in school enrollment
of 13 percent in recent years.
   Many teachers and administrators lack the experience to deal
effectively ``with the problems flowing from the provision of
education to such a large number of pupils, often under very
difficult conditions,'' he said.
   He said a period of relative tranquility at schools in recent
months ``was not enough to compensate for losses in groundwork
suffered over a period of years when severe disruption of the
education system occurred.''
   Past disruptions led to particularly bad results on math and
science exams, he said.
   Louw said was encouraged by recent appeals from black leaders
for youths to rededicate themselves to education.
   Among those making such calls was Walter Sisulu, a senior leader
of the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement who
was freed in October after 26 years in prison.
   ``Our young people must continue to participate in the struggle
for liberation,'' Sisulu said in a message to a black education
conference last month. ``But, at the same time, it is also very
important we learn to read and write so that we equip ourselves for
the South Africa of tommorrow.''

   The rap group Public Enemy has raised hackles
again with a new single that has been denounced as anti-Semitic by
the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and others.
   The song, ``Welcome to the Terrordome,'' was released Wednesday.
Its lyrics _ a multitude of statements and images focusing on black
life in 1989 _ include the lines ``Told the rab, get off the rag''
and:
   ``Crucifixion ain't no fiction
   ``So-called chosen, frozen
   ``Apology made to whoever pleases
   ``Still they got me like Jesus.''
   The group's critics argue that Public Enemy is accusing the Jews
of killing Christ and of treating Public Enemy the same way. The
same critics say descriptions of Jews as the ``so-called chosen
people'' are common among Black Muslims who say they and not the
Jews are the chosen people.
   Public Enemy leader Chuck D. said the song refers to last
summer's controversy involving Professor Griff, the group's
non-performing ``minister of information,'' who was quoted as
saying that Jews were responsible for most of the wickedness in the
world.
   Chuck D. fired Professor Griff and disbanded Public Enemy.
Within weeks, the group came together again, with Griff as a
community liaison who was no longer supposed to give interviews.
   Chuck D. insisted that the criticized lyrics of ``Welcome to the
Terrordome'' were not anti-Semitic.
   ``It says I apologized (for Griff's comments) and then the media
crucified me. Griff was wrong and I was the first to admit it. ...
But a lot of wrong things happened after that, too,'' he told the
Daily News.
   He said ``so-called chosen'' referred to both Jews and Muslims _
he does not believe that any people are chosen, he said. And he
suggested that critics were misinterpreting the record because they
were ignorant of rap language.
   Ridiculous, said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the
Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies in Los Angeles.
   ``The people who wrote it, the people who sang it, the people
who produced it, the people who distributed it all know that this
song is anti-Semitic,'' Cooper said.
   Jeffrey Sinenski, head of the ADL's Civil Rights Division, said,
``We've been in the business for 25 years and the Anti-Defamation
League is very familiar with the language of bigotry. We know it
when we see it.''
   In a letter to Tommy Mottola, president of CBS Records, which is
distributing the record, Sinenski said the song revives ``the
repulsive and historically discredited charge'' that the Jews
killed Christ. CBS Records, he said, was helping to distribute
anti-Semitic statements.
   Sinenski said he had received no response from Mottola and there
was ``a wall of silence in the music industry.'' Cooper, who has
met with Chuck D. several times in recent months and has introduced
him to a Holocaust survivor, agreed.
   ``Where is it said in the First Amendment that the mainline
record companies must distribute the rantings of racists and
anti-Semites? We do not reward, in any other area of American life,
bigots,'' he said.
   Officials at CBS Records said Mottola was on vacation and could
not be reached for comment; other company spokesmen also were
unavailable, they said.
   Russell Simmons, president of Def Jam Records, Public Enemy's
recording company, told The New York Times that ``Welcome to the
Terrordome'' is ``a good record,'' but he did not praise the
controversial lyrics.
   ``They're not great lines, and I'm not happy about it,'' Simmons
said. ``But he was frustrated and that's what he wanted to say. I'm
not defending everything he's saying, but chopping people's records
up is not what I do. And in the end, Public Enemy has done a lot
more good than harm.''

<HEAD>Yeltsin Reported Running for President of Largest Soviet Republic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maverick Communist Boris N. Yeltsin is running for
president of the Russian republic, it was reported Thursday.
   Yeltsin won more than 5 million votes in a landslide victory
last spring to become Moscow's representative in the national
parliament.
   He will have to win a second legislative seat in the regional
parliament of Russia _ the largest of the Soviet Union's 15
republics _ to seek the presidency. The Russian parliament will
elect the president from among its members.
   Yeltsin has won wide popularity with his anti-establishment
stance and calls for more radical reform. He rejected a suggestion
last spring that he run against Mikhail S. Gorbachev for presidency
of the Soviet Union.
   Russia is the largest republic in the Soviet Union, stretching
from Leningrad through the vast spaces of Siberia to the Pacific
coast. About half the nation's 286 million people live in Russia.
   Voters in Ramenki, a town near Moscow, nominated Yeltsin, said
the Interfax news service, which is affiliated with state-run Radio
Moscow.
   Yeltsin was dumped from his job as Moscow Communist Party chief
in 1987 after his outspoken criticism of party leaders. He was
later given a state post in construction.
   The 58-year-old former engineer parlayed his image as a fighter
for justice and victim of the party bureaucracy into a sweeping
victory in elections for the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies
last March, when he won 89 percent of the Moscow vote.
   As a national legislator, Yeltsin has emerged as a leader of the
fledgling opposition to Communist Party leaders and has continued
to push for faster reforms.
   Elections are scheduled for this March in the Russian republic.
No other prominent candidates for the presidency have been
announced.
   The current president of the Russian republic is Vitaly I.
Vorotnikov, a member of the party's ruling Politburo.

<HEAD>Officials Warn of Neo-Nazi Tendencies, Soviet Memorial Desecrated</HEAD>

   An East German newspaper on Thursday warned
of growing right-wing extremism in the country, and the official
news agency reported that a memorial to the Soviet soldiers who
fought the Nazis had been defaced.
   A researcher who requested anonymity told the newspaper Junge
Welt that neo-Nazi groups were growing in number and creating a
``pogrom atmosphere.''
   The newspaper said the researcher, a sociologist, wished to
remain anonymous because of threats from right-wing extremists.
   Junge Welt also printed a letter it said was received recently.
   ``We are not to be stopped anymore,'' said the hand-written
letter, signed with the Nazi salute ``Sieg Heil'' and carrying a
swastika in the bottom left corner.
   East German opposition leaders and the coalition government late
Wednesday issued a joint statement expressing ``deep concern'' over
the increase in neo-fascist incidents.
   The statement said 44 acts of violence by suspected neo-Nazis
were registered by police in 1988, while there were already 144
such incidents by the end of November this year.
   The official news agency ADN said vandals in East Berlin defaced
a 40-foot bronze statue of a Soviet soldier carrying a child, a
momument to Soviet soldiers killed in the 1945 battle to liberate
Berlin from the Nazis.
   One spray-painted message scrawled overnight said, ``Occupiers
Go Home,'' and another said, ``Blast the last prison of peoples,
the USSR,'' ADN said.
   The agency said the slogans were removed but officials had
temporarily closed the park.
   East Germany is the Soviet Union's most important strategic ally
in the Warsaw Pact, and the Soviets keep about 380,000 troops in
East Germany, according to Western estimates.
   In the Junge Welt interview, the unidentified researcher said
that in early 1988 there were about ``1,000 organized neo-fascists,
but their numbers now are much larger, not including their
sympathizers.''
   He said most of the extremists were between 18 and 26 years of
age and were particularly aggressive toward foreigners and
leftists, ``who for them represent slovenliness, disorder and
dirt.''
   Peter Przybylski, a spokesman for the general prosecutor's
office, said 185 people had been prosecuted for neo-Nazi activities
in 1988, while the number rose to 296 in 1989, excluding December.
   He told ADN that about 1,100 people were known to the police
through previous neo-Nazi offenses.
   Since the ouster of the Communist leadership and the opening of
the country's borders, East German officials have frequently warned
of possible infiltration by West German rightist radicals.
   West Germany's Republican Party, which has won as much as 10
percent of the vote in some local elections, claims to have set up
cells in East Germany.
   Ultra-rightists have also been seen distributing leaflets to
reunification advocates at pro-democracy rallies in Leipzig,
despite vows by authorities that the party will not be allowed to
function in East Germany.
   At recent rallies, students said so much disdain had built up
against the Communists in 40 years that they thought East Germany
could provide fertile soil for rightist sentiments.
   A wave of protest demonstrations forced the resignation of
hard-line Communist leader Erich Honecker on Oct. 18 and his
replacement by Egon Krenz. Krenz opened the Berlin Wall and gave
East Germans freedom to travel but growing pressure from the
pro-democracy movement forced the entire Communist leadership to
step down on Dec. 3.
   The Communist-led coalition government of Premier Hans Modrow
and the opposition have agreed to hold free elections on May 6.

<HEAD>Administration Seeks Help In Rebuilding Panamanian Economy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The United States has asked Japan to help
rebuild Panama's shattered economy and has dispatched a team of
experts to assess the costs of repairing the devastation caused by
last week's military invasion, officials said Thursday.
   In addition, representatives from the Treasury, State and
Commerce departments have begun deliberations on long-term plan to
repair the damage wrought by two years of U.S. economic warfare
against former Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The Panama Economic Reconstruction Committee, the name for the
inter-agency task force, is holding meetings this week with a
three-man Panamanian team headed by a leading economic planner,
Guillermo Chapman.
   That task force will travel to Panama next week to review the
situation, said a State Department official who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   The focus of the Panamanian-American meeting is the transfer of
some $400 million in Panamanian government money frozen last year
in the United States. President Bush last week ordered the funds
released, but the process is expected to take several weeks,
administration officials said.
   The administration, in talks both before and after the operation
that removed Noriega from power, urged Japan to help Panama, said a
Japanese Embassy official. ``The U.S. expects Japan to play a
significant role,'' said the official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Japan stopped its aid to Panama six months ago because of the
instability created by Noriega, who has been twice indicted in the
United States on drug trafficking charges. The Japanese official
said that once his government recognizes the new Panamanian
government installed with U.S. support last week, ``we will offer
new economic programs.''
   Japan has a strong interest in Panama's stability because many
Japanese exports to the United States pass through the Panama Canal.
   To meet an urgent need for funds, the United States transferred
$5.82 million in money confiscated from Noriega to the new
government headed by Guillermo Endara, an American military
spokesman in Panama City said Thursday.
   The immediate U.S. priority is to assess the direct damage from
four days of bombing and shooting, which destroyed homes and
offices and left thousands homeless, and from several days of
extensive looting.
   Alfredo Maduro, president of the Panamanian Chamber of Commerce,
said Thursday that insurance brokers had estimated losses from
looting or other damage to businesses in the capital at $750
million to $1 billion.
   Maduro said businessmen planned to ask the United States for
``something like a Marshall Plan for Panama'' to recover.
   An estimated 570 people, of them 23 American servicemen, were
killed in the military operation launched last Wednesday to remove
Noriega from power in Panama.
   The team of experts assembled to deal with the immediate
problems resulting from the military intervention arrived in Panama
Thursday, led by the head of the Office of Foreign Disaster
Assistance, Andrew Natsios. The group will try to determine how
much money the Endara government needs for rehabilitation projects,
said a spokesman.
   It also will also consult with the Defense Department to
determine its needs for building shelters and providing food and
medicine to Panamanian refugees, said Michael Marlow of the Agency
for International Development. AID is the State Department's aid
arm.
   The administration has not yet asked Congress for money for
Panama's rehabilitation, relying for now on the $400 million in
unfrozen Panamanian assets.
   But Rep. Lee Hamilton, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee
of the House and Senate, said that money would not go far enough.
   ``The Panama economy is in a mess, maybe in a bigger mess than I
think,'' he said.
   Panama's needs must be identified and aid must be provided,
Hamilton said at a news conference. ``You can't promote their
democracy unless you help their economy.''
   The economy of Panama, once a prosperous banking center with a
per capita income far higher than that of its neighbors, has shrunk
at an estimated annual rate of 10 to 15 percent since 1987,
according to economic analysts.
   Economic sanctions by the United States and a loss of confidence
in Noriega led U.S. firms, including large-scale employers like
Xerox and IBM, to scale down their businesses in Panama.
Unemployment has risen to more than 20 percent.
   In addition, Panama owes at least $5.6 billion to foreign banks,
governments and international lending agencies such as the World
Bank and International Monetary Fund.

<HEAD>Swiss Banks' Role Questioned Again After Ceausescu, Noriega</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LORENZ WOLFFERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whenever authoritarian rulers are
toppled, the question invariably arises: What about their Swiss
bank accounts?
   The role of Swiss banks, traditional havens of capital from
other countries, has prompted criticism following the recent
ousters of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega of Panama. Both are alleged to have stashed
personal fortunes in Switzerland.
   ``Once more, the reputation of the Swiss financial center is
being dragged through the mud,'' said the Geneva newspaper Tribunbe
de Geneve on Thursday.
   Sergio Salvioni, a Swiss lawyer representing the Philippine
government in its efforts to recover Ferdinand Marcos' funds, said,
``If this continues, (the Swiss) will be considered as ...
receivers of stolen goods.''
   The government, concerned about its image, swiftly slapped a
freeze on any accounts Ceausescu may hold, even without waiting for
a formal request by the new Romanian leadership. It also responded
immediately to a Washington request to block assets linked to
Noriega.
   But tracking down the funds won't be enough. If similar cases in
the past set a pattern, a long and complicated legal battle is
likely before any assets are repatriated. And estimates of their
size vary widely.
   Ceausescu, according to Romanian exile sources, is believed to
have transferred $400 million, much of it in gold, to Switzerland
during his reign. The Romanian National Bank asked all countries to
freeze any Ceausescu accounts.
   Ceausescu had denied that any such accounts exist. Credit
Suisse, one of the two Swiss banks that received the freeze order,
has said it had no evidence of Ceausescu funds. The other, Union
Bank, declined comment, citing banking secrecy rules.
   Noriega's alleged accounts might be easier to come by because
the U.S. request for assistance names the banks where funds are
suspected. U.S. Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said
Noriega was thought to have transferred at least $10 million into
various accounts in Europe.
   In both cases, Swiss reaction was as prompt as it was following
the ousters in 1986 of Marcos and of Haiti's Jean-Claude Duvalier.
But efforts by new leaders to recover the allegedly ill-gotten
wealth drag on.
   Assets held in Switzerland by Marcos and his associates are
estimated by the Manila government at hundreds of millions of
allegedly ill-gotten dollars. They remain frozen since 1986 pending
completion of complex proceedings.
   Lawyers for the Marcos family filed appeals at virtually every
level so that a final decision is likely to have to come from the
Federal Tribunal, the Swiss supreme court. Last week, however, an
initial $2.3 million returned to Manila.
   No appeal was filed in the proceedings concerning Duvalier
assets, suggesting that only minor amounts were involved. In
November, the supreme court formally granted legal assistance to
the Haitian authorities. But so far there have been no word of any
funds being repatriated.
   In 1974, the military leaders who overthrew Emperor Haile
Selassie of Ethiopia claimed that he had transferred $15 billion
abroad, much of it to Switzerland. But they never addressed a
formal request to the Swiss government and did not renewed their
claim later.
   Similarly unconfirmed reports about secret Swiss accounts
allegedly held by Third World leaders have abounded in the Swiss
press for decades. Former presidents Juan Peron of Argentina,
Anastasio Somoza of Nicaragua and Hugo Banzer of Bolivia were among
many names mentioned.

   They gave Dutch Morial a New Orleans sendoff
Thursday _ a sometimes mournful, sometimes jubilant jazz funeral
procession to and from St. Louis Cathedral, where a Mass was held
for the city's first black mayor.
   ``He had a vision and the lives of black people in Louisiana
were changed forever,'' retired Archbishop Phillip Hannan said at
the Mass. ``He saw that equal rights for all would bring in a new
era for Louisiana.''
   Morial, who also broke ground as the first black to graduate
from the Louisiana State University law school, the first black
judge in New Orleans and first black Louisiana state representative
since Reconstruction, died of a heart attack Saturday. He was 60.
   Morial's son Marc received a standing ovation during the Mass
when he ended a eulogy with the words that were a campaign theme
for his father:
   ``Daddy,'' he said, ``we're going to keep the drive alive.''
   City and state officials and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson
were among the approximately 1,000 people at the service.
   Thursday's jazz funeral procession was led to the church, and
afterwards to St. Louis Cemetery No. 1, by the Olympia Brass Band
and members of the Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club, the city's
original all-black Mardi Gras club.
   Thousands who lined the route of the procession moved with it in
parade fashion to Jackson Square and waited outside the cathedral.
Many along the route cried. Some wore small pictures of Morial
pinned to their clothes.
   The Olympia musicians, regulars at the jazz funerals that
traditionally mark the passing of New Orleans musicians, played
mournful renditions of ``Nearer My God to Thee'' and ``The Battle
Hymn of the Republic,'' then a spirited ``Gloryland'' that sparked
dancing and clapping among the mourners who fell in behind the
five-block motorcade.
   ``I've played for a million of these,'' bandleader Harold Dejan
said before the procession moved into the French Quarter. ``It's an
honor to play for someone like Dutch. He was a great man. He
deserves a great sendoff.''
   Men and women wept in the church and Wynton Marsalis played
``Just A Closer Walk'' as the coffin was moved to the hearse at the
end of the ceremony.
   Outside, the band _ including tuba, trumpet, bass drum, trombone
and wailing clarinet _ picked up the mournful tune, but quickly
switched to ``Down By the Riverside'' as people held aloft gaily
decorated umbrellas and pictures of Morial and danced.
   ``Time to cut loose and think about him in happier days,'' said
one woman as she moved toward the cemetery.
   Morial participated in numerous successful integration lawsuits
aimed at education, transportation and public institutions. He
chaired Jackson's presidential campaign in Louisiana in 1984. In
1988, he was an adviser to Democratic presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis.
   During his two terms as mayor from 1978 to 1986, Morial was
recognized for his pioneering policies in fields such as minority
business development. He was a president of the National Conference
of Mayors.
   Morial failed to get a change in the city charter so he could
run for a third consecutive term and spent the last three years out
of office.
   But Morial remained in the thick of local politics.
   Eleven days before he died, he announced that he would not run
for mayor again but held out the possibility he might someday seek
another office _ possibly a congressional seat or the governor's
office.

   The Seattle Public Library has never been busier,
both at the circulation desk and the various reference desks where
staffers this year took tens of thousands of questions from a
puzzled and curious public.
   Book circulation topped 5 million for the first time, and the
reference desks handled questions from the ordinary to the absurd,
said head librarian Liz Stroup.
   For example:
   Do hummingbirds hitch rides on geese to fly over the Gulf of
Mexico? Answer: No.
   Do deer have tonsils? A stumper, said Stroup, who couldn't find
a good answer.
   What's the life span of a flea? Answer: 36 days if unfed.
   Who invented the wheel? The answer is lost in antiquity, said
Stroup.
   The history department spent a good bit of time trying to help a
caller determine the place in American history of a Richard Stans.
   It turned out the caller misunderstood President Bush recite a

   One of the most popular local TV

Ventilator.
   The coffee- and cream-colored cat sometimes climbs all over the
news copy that Sam Malone is reading as he delivers the evening
news on a cable station.
   ``He does it to get attention,'' Malone said. ``If I'm trying to
type, he'll lay right across the typewriter.''
   Sometimes the cat crawls up on Malone's shoulders and nuzzles
the 68-year-old newsman's hair.
   ``People just eat it up and it's not something I taught him,''
Malone told The Dallas Morning News in an interview published
Thursday.
   Malone's wife, Margaret, said the telephone rings constantly on
days Ventilator decides he doesn't want to go on the set.
   ``The cat gets more calls than we do,'' Mrs. Malone said.

<TEXT>
   Alexander Dubcek suffered two
decades of humiliation at the hands of hard-line Communists who
ousted and banished him for trying to humanize socialism and
increase freedom for his people.
   But with his stunning return to power Thursday as leader of
parliament, the man once considered by many as Czechoslovakia's
tragic hero may be remembered as one who fought the noble fight and
won.
   ``This is a moral satisfaction to the hundreds of thousands ot
people who have upheld the ideals of the `Prague Spring,''' Dubcek
said Thursday in his acceptance speech before the Federal Assembly.
   Elected to replace Antonin Novotny as head of the Communist
Party in January 1968, Dubcek led a courageous band of reformers
who dreamed of a ``socialism with a human face.'' For an
exhilarating eight months, Czechoslovaks felt new personal freedoms
and saw the emergence of political pluralism and economic reforms.
   Intellectuals, straining at the leash of Communist control,
provided ideological ammunition for Dubcek as he argued with Moscow
for the abolition of censorship and the curbing of police, all in
the name of a rejuvenated Party.
   The radical novelty of the ``Prague Spring'' was the realization
that economic reform was impossible without political
decentralization, an idea proposed nearly 20 years later by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   But under Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev in 1968, the ideas
Dubcek championed were considered dangerous.
   At the head of a column of Warsaw Pact troops, Soviet tanks
rolled into Prague's broad Wenceslas Square on Aug. 20, 1968, to
crush the liberal reforms. It was a dramatic and enduring message
to the world that the Soviet Union would not refrain from using
force if its imperial position was threatened.
   The Soviet invasion became a watershed in Eastern European
history and Dubcek came to personify all those who challenged
Communist tyranny.
   Like thousands of Czechoslovak intellectuals and reformist
politicians, Dubcek was the target of repression after the invasion.
   He was flown to Moscow and forced to sign an agreement
sanctioning the invasion and allowing 80,000 Soviet troops to
remain inside Czechoslovakia.
   By May 1970, Dubcek had been ousted from parliament, his last
public position, and stripped of his party membership.
   His name was removed from history books and his picture
airbrushed out of official photos, leaving an empty space where the
popular leader once appeared.
   He was sent with his wife and three sons to work as a forestry
manager in Bratislava, the capital of his native Slovakia, and was
kept under constant police surveillance.
   Dubcek, while not actively involved in dissident human rights
activities throughout the 1970s, was embraced by the opposition
during November's peaceful revolution.
   The dramatic photo of a triumphant Dubcek, 68, waving to
hundreds of thousands of pro-democracy supporters and admirers from
the balcony over Wenceslas Square on Nov. 24 made front pages
around the world.

<HEAD>Enrile Recommended For Prosecution in Coup</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Government investigators recommended
Thursday that opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile be prosecuted for
alleged involvement in the latest attempt to overthrow President
Corazon Aquino, an official said.
   Enrile, a former Aquino supporter, denied involvement in the
coup attempt, saying the accusations wer meant to harass the
opposition. He said he welcomed the opportunity to face his
accusers in court.
   Fernando de Leon, the chief state prosecutor, said the National
Bureau of Investigation recommended prosecution after witnesses
claimed to have seen Enrile with mutiny leaders Dec. 1, when
thousands of troops launched the sixth and strongest attempt to
topple Mrs. Aquino.
   De Leon said government prosecutors would review the
recommendation to decide whether charges would be filed.
   Enrile joined with Mrs. Aquino in the military-civilian uprising
that swept her to power in February 1986. He was named as defense
minister but fired from the post that November after a failed coup
by his followers.
   De Leon said those reportedly seen with Enrile at his home
included former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, believed to
have been a key leader in the failed coup attempt.
   De Leon said the witnesses were hotel waiters catering a meal at
Enrile's Makati residence.
   Enrile denied that there were soldiers at his residence. He said
he had ``not more than 20'' bodyguards, all in civilian dress.
   He said there also were some guests attending a Mass customarily
held at his house on the first Friday of every month.
   ``I know that I have not done anything that is criminal under
our laws,'' Enrile said. ``I am not part of the rebellion. I have
not seen any of the participants in this military rebellion.''
   He called the accusations a ``machination'' of the presidential
palace.
   ``They want to seal the lips of the opposition in the country
and to threaten them, but I will tell them now ... that they cannot
silence me,'' Enrile said. ``This government is like a wounded
tiger flailing its paws.''
   In all, 113 people were killed and more than 500 wounded in the
Dec. 1-9 coup attempt.
   Many of the coup leaders, including Honasan, are at large.
   Government institutions bought stocks Thursday to ease
panic-selling on the Manila Stock Exchange. Dealers blamed a
statement Wednesday by Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, chief of the
Philippine Constabulary, that intelligence reports indicated a coup
attempt may be launched between Jan. 17 and Jan. 30.

   The White House said Thursday that
Manuel Noriega's fate rests ``in the hands of the Vatican,'' and it
ruled out the possibility of a third-country refuge for the
ex-dictator of Panama.
   Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the United States has
agreed to come to the papal nuncio's rescue should Noriega and his
cronies take hostages inside Panama City embassy where Noriega has
been holed up since Christmas Eve.
   But Fitzwater, briefing reporters here while Bush was off
hunting quail at a remote ranch 60 miles away, said, ``We don't see
a hostage situation or any danger at the moment. But we're willing
to offer assistance should that be necessary.''
   On another issue, Fitzwater confirmed that Bush is readying
plans to use the U.S. military to disrupt drug supply routes in
South and Central America. Asked about a report that the Pentagon
was planning a virtual blockade of Colombia, Fitzwater said, ``We
have decided to take certain actions to help the countries of Latin
America interdict those supply routes.''
   Whatever is done will be in close concert with Colombian
authorities, he said.
   Papal officials reportedly sent U.S. authorities a letter
Tuesday authorizing a rescue effort should a hostage situation
develop. ``I assume that when you have people of the ilk of Mr.
Noriega and his cronies in the embassy, there certainly is reason
to be concerned,'' said Fitzwater.
   A Vatican spokesman said Wednesday in Italy that the papal
nuncio could not legally turn Noriega over to U.S. authorities, who
want to try him on drug trafficking charges. The papal embassy in
Panama City is empowered only to deal with the government of
Panama, and no other foreign governments, the spokesman said.
   ``Our position remains the same, that we want Noriega returned
to the United States for prosecution, but this matter is now in the
hands of the Vatican and we will work with them and with the Endara
government to calmly consider the issue,'' said Fitzwater.
   Asked why the United States opposes letting Noriega seek refuge
in a third country _ as both the Reagan and Bush administrations
had suggested over the past two years as part of deals to restore
democracy in Panama _ the presidential spokesman said those offers
were contingent on Noriega giving up power peacefully.
   ``We had to go in militarily. We have paid a price for this,''
said Fitzwater, referring to the 23 American servicemen killed and
322 wounded in the Dec. 20 invasion that toppled Noriega's regime.
   Fitzwater said U.S. authorities have detained and interviewed
some Noriega associates who have left the Vatican Embassy. ``Most
of his cronies ... are still in the embassy with him,'' said
Fitzwater, who would not disclose how many there were.
   U.S. authorities blared loud rock music _ including such tunes
as ``Nowhere to Run'' and ``I Fought the Law and the Law Won'' _
outside the Vatican Embassy Wednesday.
   Fitzwater said it was not a pressure tactic on the Vatican, but
simply ``fairly standard practice'' to disrupt any attempt to
eavesdrop on U.S. officials' conversations. The same thing was done
during the 1988 Moscow summit, he said.
   Of the choice of records, he added, ``I'm certainly glad to see
the American sense of whimsy comes forward in this situation.''
   Bush was off hunting quail with Secretary of State James A.
Baker III at their friend Will Farish's 10,000-acre Lazy F Ranch
outside Beeville, Texas, on a vacation that began Wednesday and
continues through New Year's Day.
   Fitzwater said he had no response to protests by animal rights
activists against the hunt, an annual Christmastime ritual for
Bush, an avid outdoorsman.
   The quail that Bush bags are ``always dressed for consumption,''
said Fitzwater, who added that in his own youth on a Kansas farm he
hunted and ate quail ``all the time. It's a great dish.'
   Bush departs the Lazy F Ranch late Friday afternoon to join his
wife Barbara for the weekend in Houston, still their legal

they use when there.
   They will visit servicemen wounded in Panama at two military
hospitals on Sunday and Bush will stop in Montgomery, Ala., to go
bass fishing before returning to the White House Monday night.
   Bush was accompanied by an ever-present military aide and
personal assistant Tim McBride on the ranch, as well as Baker and a
Secret Service contingent. But neither national security adviser
Brent Scowcroft nor deputy Robert Gates accompanied him to Texas,
and Bush relied on written reports for his daily morning
intelligence briefing, Fitzwater said.
   Bush got up at 6 a.m., read the intelligence report and morning
newspapers, ate breakfast and was out hunting by 8:45 a.m.,
Fitzwater said. It was a foggy, chilly morning in much of south
Texas.

   A series of small earthquakes rattled
Southern California on Wednesday and Thursday, raising scientists'
concern somewhat about the possibility of a major jolt.
   A quake measuring 4.3 on the Richter scale jarred people awake
at 1:41 a.m. Thursday in an area stretching about 120 miles from
Los Angeles to east of Palm Springs. No injuries or damage were
reported.
   That quake was the largest of about 10 that began Wednesday
afternoon and were centered in an area seven miles from downtown
San Bernardino, said seismologist Kate Hutton of the California
Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
   A magnitude-3.3 aftershock at 2 a.m. Thursday and a 3.2
foreshock at 2:10 p.m. Wednesday were in the same area.
   The tremors were cause for slightly increased concern because
they were centered close to the San Jacinto Fault, which itself
produced several quakes this month.
   ``We've had slightly unusual activity, and we're keeping a watch
on it,'' said Lucile Jones, a seismologist at the U.S. Geological
Survey's Pasadena office. ``I'm a little more concerned than I was
yesterday, but not much more.''
   A 1988 forecast by the Geological Survey said a magnitude-6.5 to
7 quake is 50 percent likely by the year 2018 somewhere on the San
Jacinto Fault, which starts at a point northwest of San Bernardino
and runs roughly 130 miles southeast into eastern San Diego County.
   State emergency services officials said in 1988 that such a
quake could kill a few hundred people, injure 1,000 and cause more
than $1 billion damage.
   Hutton noted that previous quake sequences, situated a bit
farther northwest of San Bernardino in Cajon Pass, ended without a
large jolt.
   In southeastern Australia on Thursday, a strong earthquake
crumbled buildings and homes in Newcastle, killing at least 11
people and injuring more than 120, officials said. Scientists don't
believe quakes in widely distant areas are related.
   Thursday's magnitude-4.3 quake in California ``was a good sized
one,'' said Jay Diamond, a disc jockey at San Bernardino station
KFRG-FM, which received several calls from jittery residents. ``It
shook us pretty good. The glass on the booth was shaking.''
   ``There was a bit of a rolling, then a sharp jolt,'' said
Christie Hall, who was awake in her Lake Arrowhead home when
Thursday's quake and aftershock struck. ``The aftershock was much
milder.''
   Quakes ranging in magnitude from 4 to 5 on the Richter scale of
ground motion are considered small to moderate but can produce some
local damage knocking items off shelves and sometimes breaking
windows.
   Palm Springs is about 100 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Turner Sues for CNN Broadcasts to Vietnam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Turner Broadcasting System is suing the Bush
administration to be allowed to provide its Cable News Network to
Vietnam, a Turner official said Thursday.
   Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting wants to provide a satellite
receiving station to the Vietnamese at no charge and give them the
right to take the CNN signal for 50 Vietnamese dong a year, worth
less than a penny, said Bertram Carp, a Turner vice president in
Washington.
   U.S. law prohibits most trade with Vietnam. Turner said in its
lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Washington that CNN would qualify
under a 1988 amendment to trade law that exempts information
materials from trade sanctions.
   Turner believs that under the amendment, ``we're entitled to
this,'' Carp said.
   The suit names as defendants Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady,
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, Carp said.
   The administation interprets the law to mean that physical
materials such as books or videocassettes may be exchanged with
Vietnam, but not ``immaterial'' commodities, including TV
broadcasts.
   Vietnam now provides videocassettes for CNN's ``World Report''
program, Carp said.
   Carp said the suit, filed Wednesday, asks the court to order the
Treasury Department's office of foreign assets control to allow CNN
to provide the receiving station and signal to Vietnam.
   Carp said the Commerce Department would have to approve sending
the Earth station.
   Treasury Department spokesman Larry Batdorf said he could not
comment until department attorneys had reviewed the suit.

   A chartered Romanian airliner on a
relief mission crashed Thursday in bad weather about 40 miles from
Bucharest, killing seven people, including a British free-lance
photographer, news reports said.
   Ian Parry, on assignment for The Sunday Times, was the only
passenger on the Romanian Airlines Tarom aircraft, which was bound
for Belgrade to collect medical supplies.
   Independent Television's Channel 4 news reported that the
plane's six-member Romanian crew also was killed.
   The Romanian news agency Agerpres said the plane, a Soviet-built
Antonov-24 was trying to open the first international air link ``of
new Romania'' when it crashed at Gaiesti near Bucharest because of
bad weather.
   A commission of experts went to the site to investigate the
cause of the crash.
   The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said the plane took off for
Belgrade to bring a new consignment of Yugoslav humanitarian aid
for Romania.
   Parry, 24, was trying to get his film back to London.
   The Sunday Times said Parry asked to cover the events in Romania
and arrived on Monday.
   ``Ian Parry was young, dedicated and undoubtedly a rising star.
He had argued to go into Romania, feeling it was an opportunity
which should not be missed,'' said Roy Greenslade, managing editor
for news of The Sunday Times.

<HEAD>Newspaper Readers Can Drop a Dime on Dealers By Clipping a Coupon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reporting suspected drug dealers here is
as easy as clipping a coupon.
   Newspaper readers fill in the blanks on the coupon and mail it
to police under a program started by a citizen group a month ago in
this city of 52,000 outside New Haven.
   Police have received 15 report-a-dealer coupons, and the
complaints are being investigated, Officer Edward Kelly, a police
spokesman, said Thursday.
   ``Just because there is information on the coupon doesn't mean
we can go right out and make an arrest,'' Kelly said. ``We have to
make sure it is valid. People are going to have to be a little
patient.''
   The campaign was organized by Drug Free Milford Inc., a group
trying to help police fight drugs. The coupons, marked by a
hypodermic needle with a slash through it, are published daily for
free in the Milford Citizen.
   ``We will make it extremely uncomfortable for the dealers. We
are going to eradicate this poison by getting everyone involved,''
said DeForest Smith, president of Drug Free Milford.
   Topped by a bold black box that exclaims ``ENOUGH!'' the coupons
read: ``I've had enough of drugs in my neighborhood. I've reason to
believe that (blank) is using (or) dealing drugs. I'm suspicious of
activities at (blank). I've noticed the following license plates on
cars in the vicinity of suspected drug activity.''
   Tipsters are given the option of identifying themselves for a
possible reward of up to $1,000 if there is a conviction resulting
from the information.
   The report-a-dealer coupons could cause expose the anti-drug
group to lawsuits if someone decides to turn in a name just to
embarass that person, said William Olds, executive director of the
Connecticut Civil Liberties Union.
   But Smith said the group has liability insurance. ``We
anticipate lawsuits _ dealers will do their best to derail this
program,'' he said.
   Drug Free Milford has also helped set up a drug hotline, but has
received only six calls, police said. The coupons are more
effective, Kelly said, because many people are hestitant to talk on
the phone about illegal activity.

<TEXT>
   Kurdish rebels fighting for an autonomous
homeland have repulsed an Iraqi army assault on their bases in the
northern mountains, a guerrilla spokesman said Thursday.
   The official of the banned Patriotic Union of Kurdistan told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview that about 180 Iraqi
soldiers were killed in the Dec. 24-25 attack on the bases, which
dot snow-covered Mount Sadir near Qala Diza.
   The spokesman said 10 guerrillas _ known as Peshmergas, or
``those who face death'' _ were wounded in the fighting, which he
said was continuing in a diminished capacity. The official spoke
from a West European capital but asked that his name and location
be kept secret for security reasons.
   The official, who is known to The AP, said soldiers from the
Iraqi army's 24th battalion launched the offensive because ``they
were determined to capture those bases.'' He said one helicopter
gunship was downed by the guerrillas.
   Residents of Qala Diza were forcibly evacuated by the Iraqis
this year in a drive to create a buffer zone along the Iranian
border to prevent the guerrillas from receiving support from the
Islamic Republic.
   The last big assault on the area was in September. Iraq has
launched several concerted attacks against the Kurdish rebels since
the August 1988 cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq conflict.
   Iraq's 3{ million Kurds have been fighting on and off for more
than a half-century for their own homeland.

   The State Department on Thursday said
Nicaragua was citing specious reasons for delaying the monthly U.S.
flight carrying supplies for the American Embassy in Managua.
   The Sandinista government took the action on Wednesday after
complaining that U.S. forces blocked the departure of two
Nicaraguan planes parked at the airport in Panama City.
   State Department press officer Adam Shub said the Nicaraguan
planes have been unable to leave because of limited capacity at the
airport, a problem that has affected other aircraft as well. He
said the problem is expected to be resolved shortly.
   ``It is unfortunate that the Sandinistas, who say they want
better relations with the United States, have chosen to make this a
political issue by delaying our embassy's monthly C-130 supply
flight,'' he said.
   He added that Nicaragua knows full well the circumstances at the
airport in Panama City.
   ``If the Sandinistas are sincere about wanting better relations
with the U.S. and their neighbors, they should stop raising such
specious issues,'' Shub said.
   The next monthly supply flight to Managua is scheduled for Jan.
11.

   Harvard University, the first Ivy League
school, has become the last to try to protect its name with a
trademark after years of seeing it emblazoned on sweatshirts and
other goods around the world.
   Under new licensing procedures, towels, watches and boxer shorts
for the Crimson may still be allowed.
   But string bikinis? Maybe not.
   ``We just don't want it to be outrageous,'' said Ellen Mitchell
of the Harvard Office of Patents, Copyrights and Licensing. ``We
don't want to look silly.''
   More than 100 U.S. colleges and universities already issue
licenses for the use of their names, including the seven other Ivy
League colleges, according to the office of Robert Scott, vice
president for finance.
   Margot Naulleau, international licensing coordinator for
Champion Products Inc., one of the main suppliers of athletic wear
with college insignias, said Harvard _ America's oldest college _
was one of the last major schools in the nation to seek a trademark.
   ``It's simply that we are very old and very conservative. It
took us a long time to decide if it was something that we ought to
do,'' said Joyce Brinton, director of the Harvard patent office.
She said there was no incident that led to the decision to apply,
such as a particularly egregious product on the market.
   ``It was just that the time has come,'' she said.
   Before the Harvard Corporation decided in June to apply for a
trademark on their name from the U.S. Patent and Trademarking
Office, Brinton's office had inquiries from many manufacturers
about getting a license.
   Brinton said the trademark has not yet been approved but she
didn't anticipate any problems.
   ``I think most of the companies have felt uncomfortable that
they don't have a license from Harvard,'' she said. Those companies
worried about being left with hundreds of products if the school's
lawyers suddenly cracked down, she said.
   Harvard ran a few trial programs before moving toward licensing
on a broad scale. At the school's 350th anniversary in 1986,
Harvard wanted to ensure commemorative items were of high quality.
Another program licensing the trademark in Japan has been booming,
bringing in $130,000 in royalties annually.
   Under the new licensing procedure, if someone wants to make a
product bearing the name Harvard, Harvard University, or the
school's insignia, he must first show designs and samples to
demonstrate the quality of the product before Harvard will grant a
license.
   And the cost of renting the Harvard name? A bargain, Mitchell
said. Brinton said companies that market Harvard products pay a
flat fee of $300 and sales royalties of 7{ percent.
   Only a few licenses have been distributed so far. After a couple
of years, officials expect from $300,000 to $500,000 to come in a
year. But with an endowment of some $4.5 billion, the income from
licensing is a drop in the bucket.

<TEXT>
   The famous leaning tower of Pisa shifted less
this year than its average annual tilt of the last three decades,
university technicians said Thursday.
   The inclination of the 180-foot tower was about 0.03 inches,
compared to an average 0.045 inches recorded over the past 30
years, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.
   ``(The measuring instruments) are set for very small values,
which show that the tower is slowing its fall,'' said Gero Geri, a
topography professor who has been measuring the lean of the tower
since 1969.
   His findings are reassuring to the shopowners, merchants and
hoteliers who depend on the 800,000 tourists who clamber up the
tower's spiral staircase every year. Nonetheless, Pisa's mayor
recently agreed to close the tower starting next month for
temporary restoration work.
   The tower, begun by Bonnano Pisano in 1173, started to lean
almost immediately because the ground shifted underneath. The tower
now tilts about 13 feet off the perpendicular, but tower experts
say it will not topple for at least another century.
   Public Works Minister Giovanni Prandini sparked an outcry this
fall by sounding an alarm about the decay of the national symbol.

<TEXT>
   The United States begins the 1990s facing a
host of tough decisions needed to erase policy mistakes in the last
decade that are threatening America's global economic leadership, a
congressional study concluded Thursday.
   The study, prepared by the staff of the Joint Economic
Committee, said the No. 1 economic problem facing the country was
the federal budget deficit.
   ``Eliminating the deficit will not by itself solve all of our
economic problems or put an end to our national consumption
binge,'' the study said. ``However, we will not solve our most
pressing economic problems unless we reduce the deficit.''
   The study called on President Bush and Congress to come up with
a credible package that would include a mix of both tax increases
and spending cuts to eliminate the deficit.
   The study said policymakers must abandon the budetary gimmicks
they have used in recent years to give a false appearance of making
progress in eliminating a budget deficit that has been stuck near
$150 billion for the past three years.
   ``The economic policies of the 1980s have not prepared us for a
brighter future,'' said committee chairman Rep. Lee Hamilton,
D-Ind., who directed preparation of the new report. ``We need new
economic policies for the 1990s: policies that will improve U.S.
economic performance and make us a richer nation and a fairer one.''
   The study offered a stark assessment of America's economic
prospects if policies are not altered, contending that the United
States must do more to boost savings, increase investment and spur
gains in productivity if the country hopes to compete
internationally.
   ``Our country has been driven for most of this decade not by
investment but rather by a binge of consumption that threatens our
long-run standard of living and our standing as the world's leading
economic power,'' the report said.
   It said the huge federal deficit was the biggest contributor to
this consumption binge, but it also cited a big 20 percent drop in
new business investment over the past 10 years and productivity
growth that is far below the levels of the 1950s and 1960s.
   The study, which did not have the backing of Republican members
of the committee, said it would be impossible to reduce the budget
deficit without tax increases to accompany spending cuts. This is a
conclusion that Bush has repeatedly rejected.
   His administration is putting the finishing touches on a $1.23
trillion budget proposal for next year that will meet the
Gramm-Rudman target of reducing the deficit to $64 billion without
raising income taxes.
   The study said Bush's efforts to rely on rosy economic forecasts
and elusive savings in goverment programs would prove as
unsucessful as similar policies pursued by President Reagan.
   While a tax increase alone would not be politically acceptable,
it could win approval as part of a package deal that would combine
modest tax increases with spending cuts, the study said.
   In other findings, the report predicted that economic growth
prospects over the next year were weak, in part because the effort
to reduce America's huge trade deficits had stalled out with the
trade imbalance stuck at levels above $100 billion a year.
   The report devoted an entire chapter to suggestions on how the
country can resume making progress on trimming the trade deficit,
but it warned: ``Reaching trade balance will be difficult and
painful.''
   It said efforts to boost the savings rate were essential as a
way of curbing over-consumption in the United States and reducing
Americans' appetite for foreign goods. A bigger savings pool would
also provide the capital U.S. industry needs to modernize, the
report said.
   It called for international organizations such as the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to devote more
efforts to resolving the Third Word debt crisis, which has severely
limited U.S. export opportunities in Latin America.

   The Justice Department says it obtained guilty
pleas or convictions in 107 environmental criminal cases in the
last fiscal year, a record.
   Richard Stewart, assistant attorney general for the land and
natural resources division, said the numbers reflected a 70 percent
increase over the previous year and demonstrate the Bush
administration's commitment to environmental protection.
   But department officials acknowledged Thursday that many of the
107 cases concluded during the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30
and cited in Wednesday's announcement may have been initiated
before President Bush took office last January.
   The number of indictments alleging environmental crimes actually
declined in fiscal 1989 by about 20 percent to 101, the lowest
number in three years, compared with 124 in 1988 and 127 in 1987.
   Spokeswoman Amy Casner acknowledged that the sharp increase in
the number of cases won in fiscal 1989 in part reflected the high
number of indictments filed in previous years.
   She said she did not know how many of the 107 convictions
reflected cases initiated in earlier years.
   The 107 cases resulted in the collection of $12.7 million in
fines, including a $2.25 million penalty paid by Ashland Oil Co.
for the discharge of 500,000 gallons of diesel fuel into the Ohio
River.
   Justice had sought $7.5 million from Protex Industries for
endangering workers at a hazardous waste site, but a judge later
suspended all but about $400,000 of that fine. Ms. Casner said the
suspended portion of the fine was not included in the $12.7 million.

   The family that helped Nicolae Ceausescu
rule Romania for 24 years was in ruins Thursday, its leading
members dead by firing squad, a brother hanged by his own hand and
eight other relatives under arrest.
   Marin Ceausescu, 74, the eldest brother of the deposed dictator,
was found hanging in the trade section of the Romanian Embassy in
Vienna on Thursday, an apparent suicide, Vienna police said.
   A sister and her son also were reported arrested Thursday in
Romania, bringing to at least eight the number of family members
known to be under arrest and awaiting trial.
   Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were killed by a firing
squad on Monday after a trial by the revolutionary government found
them guilty of grave crimes against Romania.
   Marin Ceausescu had been active as a trade counselor here since
1973. The Vienna daily Kurier, citing unspecified sources in the
new Romanian government, alleged Thursday that Marin ``managed the
Romanian secret service headquarters for Western Europe in Vienna.''
   The claim could not be confirmed.
   Nicolae Ceausescu was overthrown on Dec. 22 by a mass uprising
backed by the army. He mistrusted many, and he was believed to have
put at least 40 of his relatives in power to help him maintain his
oppressive rule.
   Elena Ceausescu was a member of the now-disbanded Politburo and
the first deputy premier, the second-most powerful person in the
nation.
   Ceausescu's two other brother's, Ilie, an army general and
deputy defense minister, and Nicolae Andruta, a police general and
deputy interior minister, were captured the day their brother was
deposed and have since been in detention.
   Romanian soldiers and police on Thursday arrested Ceausescu's
sister, Elena Barbulescu, and her son, Emil, as they were hiding
out in Ceausescu's hometown of Scornicesti, the official Romanian
news agency Agerpres reported.
   Also arrested with them was Ilie's wife. The news agency did not
give her first name.
   Checks worth about $50,000 and about $3,600 worth of Romanian
currency were found in Mrs. Barbulescu's possession, said Agerpres.
   Mrs. Barbulescu is the wife of Vasile Barbulescu, who was
Ceausescu's agricuture chief and is currently under arrest.
   Ceausescu's youngest son, Nicu, and daughter, Zoia-Elena, have
been in custody since last week.
   Nicu Ceausescu was party secretary in Sibiu in southern
Transylvania, home to a powerful military and security garrison. He
was reportedly a heavy drinker and womanizer who killed two people
while running red lights.
   Among the items police found in Zoia Elena's apartment were
seven expensive watches, jewelry, $95,000 in cash and valuable
paintings. Also found was a golden scale used to weigh the imported
meat fed to her two lapdogs. She reportedly was head of the
Bucharest Institute of Mathematics.
   Scores of other more distant members of the clan occupied
positions in the security, trade and agriculture, but their fate
was not known.

   The main shipping link between

   ``We'll probably not even reach the tons we carried in 1988.
We'll probably be even or down as much as 2 million tons,'' George
Ryan, president of the Lake Carriers' Association, said from
Cleveland.
   Shippers in 1988 posted their best year since the crash of the
steel industry six years before. This year's slump reverses a trend
of increases since the recession.
   Ryan blamed the weather. November gales prompted ships to drop
anchor, and ore, coal and stone shipments that month dropped 10
percent or 12.8 million tons. Coal alone was down 17 percent.
   Early December ice closed the major link between the lakes, Soo
Locks on Lake Superior, two weeks early.
   An estimated 2 million tons of cargo, most of it iron ore, was
stranded in port until spring when the last freighter, the American
Republic, locked through Sault Ste. Marie at 2:44 p.m. Wednesday.
   On Thursday, 22 ships remained on the four lower lakes, fighting
the ice to finish their deliveries before heading home for winter.
Ryan said cargo should continue to move down Lake Michigan to
Indiana ports through the middle of January.
   He was unsure what 1990 will bring, but some carrier customers
expect more of the same.
   ``We'll have some slowdown, not drastic,'' said M. Thomas Moore,
chairman of Cleveland-Cliffs Inc., the nation's largest iron ore
producer.
   The biggest Great Lakes cargo traffic is in moving ore from
mines in Minnesota and Michigan's Upper Peninsula to steel mills on
the lower lakes. Deliveries began the year at a pace to break
1988's post-recession record, but stalled over the summer.
   Reduced demand for the raw ore that goes into steelmaking is the
problem, Moore said. Steel sales are down and more mills are
recycling steel rather than producing it, he said.
   Coal shipments have been depressed since May by a strike at
Pittston Co. mines in West Virginia, Virginia and Kentucky. As of
December, Lake Erie ports had moved 2.4 million tons less coal than
they had by December 1988.
   Shipping lanes this week remained open in the lower lakes,
though they are restricted in some areas.
   Conditions on western Lake Erie and the Detroit River have
improved since late last week, when eight vessels were stopped or
slowed by ice, the Coast Guard said.

   A man paid a college student to kill him
by running him down with a car, police said Thursday.
   Graham Glickfeld, who was killed over the weekend, had made
similar requests before, but it was not clear why he wanted to die,
said police spokesman Dennis Satariano. ``But this was obviously a
man with some emotional problems,'' he said.
   The driver, Michael K. Doeschot, 27, a student at San Jose State
University, was arraigned Wednesday on murder charges and held
without bail.
   ``It was murder for hire,'' said Sgt. Mike Eads.
   Police would not say how much money was involved, only that it
was not a lot, and would not give details of the earlier offers by
the victim.
   The two men attended a Christmas party separately Friday night,
police said.
   Police responding to a call around midnight found Glickfeld, a
31-year-old supermarket worker, seriously injured in the empty
parking lot of a community center. He died a short time later at a
hospital.
   The arrangement between the two men ``probably took place within
a couple hours,'' said Eads.
   After the car hit Glickfeld, Doeschot ``called police to let us
know what's going on,'' Eads said. ``We had some idea it was an
intentional act from the beginning.'' Doeschot admitted running
over Glickfeld, the sergeant said.
   Detective Ken Bingaman said the men were acquaintances from a
theater class at a community college.

<HEAD>Koch Vows to Fight Staten Island Secession in Court</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN SHANAHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vowing ``Not now, not ever!'' outgoing Mayor
Edward I. Koch said Thursday the city is challenging a new law that
permits the borough of Staten Island to vote on secession.
   He said the bill signed Dec. 15 by Gov. Mario Cuomo could
``dismember this, the world's greatest city.''
   The bill violates the state and federal constitutions because it
was passed by the state Legislature without the consent of the City
Council or the mayor, Koch said, and would allow only the residents
of Staten Island to vote on a matter that directly affects citizens
of the city's other four boroughs.
   ``New York City is and should continue to be one city _ not two,
not five, just one,'' he said at a news conference in City Hall.
``Secession _ not now, not ever!''
   Koch, who leaves office Jan. 1, said the city filed a lawsuit
challenging the law in state Supreme Court on Thursday.
   The bill was sponsored by state Sen. John Marchi, a Staten
Islander who said his borough would lose its political clout in the
city under a reorganization that eliminated the powerful Board of
Estimate. Marchi did not immediately return a telephone call to his
office Thursday.
   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last spring that the Board of
Estimate, which has broad authority over contracts and planning and
approves the city's annual budget, violated the one man-one vote
principle because it gave equal voting power to the boroughs
despite vastly different populations.
   Staten Island has fewer than 400,000 residents while Brooklyn
has about 2.6 million.
   Koch said secession would have an enormous impact on the
property, affairs and government of the city.
   ``Would the residents of New York state stand silently by if the
City of Buffalo were to annex itself to Canada?'' he asked. ``I
don't think so. They would put up a fight.''
   ``We too will put up a fight to make sure that one of the five
jewels in our city's crown _ the Borough of Staten Island _ remains
a shining, vital part of our community,'' Koch said.
   He said when Cuomo signed the bill he ``plunged a dagger into
the heart of New York.''
   Koch said secession would remove substantial housing resources
from the city. Staten Island has the largest share of single and
two-family dwellings as well as the most available land for future
housing development, he said.
   ``The city also owns buildings and other properties on Staten
Island worth billions of dollars. There are sewer lines, water
mains, over 50 schools, over 25 parks, police precincts,
firehouses, a ferry terminal, streets and bridges and cultural
facilities,'' he said.
   ``The citizens of all five boroughs have contributed financially
to the construction and the operation of all of these facilities,''
Koch said.

   The U.N. General Assembly met Thursday in
emergency session and prepared to rebuke the United States and
deplore its invasion of Panama. Nicaragua said America was trying
to impose ``the law of the jungle.''
   After hearing Nicaragua, the 159-nation assembly adjourned until
Friday.
   It was expected to adopt a resolution then, sponsored by
Nicaragua and Cuba, which demands withdrawal of U.S. forces from
Panama and calls the U.S. military intervention a flagrant
violation of international law.
   In his speech, Nicaraguan Ambassador Alejandro Serrano Caldera
condemned the invasion, saying:
   ``This affront to sovereignty in Panama is a new and especially
dangerous threat to the entire peace process in Central America.
   ``There can be no moral, juridical or political justification
for one country invading another militarily. The day this ceases to
be the case, the day that brute force is justified for any reason .
.. we will have established violence as a norm of conduct and the
law of the jungle will become the guilding principle of foreign
relations.''
   The assembly will reconvene Friday to hear more speakers before
voting on a resolution that ``strongly deplores'' the U.S. invasion.
   U.S. troops drove Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega from
power last week after diplomatic and economic efforts failed to
budge him following his indictment in 1988 on U.S. drug-trafficking
and money-laundering charges.
   Serrano said the latest military intervention was the sixth time
over the years that the United States has invaded Panama. ``Can
there be any possible justification for this?'' he asked. ``The
U.S. representatives says this was an act of self-defense ... Has
Panama committed an act of armed aggression?''
   Proceedings were delayed because Central American and other
nations offered a compromise resolution to modify the draft measure
proposed by Nicaragua and Cuba, and incorporate elements that would
appeal to more moderate nations.
   The new resolution, expected to pass overwhelmingly Friday, was
still forceful. It used the same language to ``strongly deplore''
the invasion and to ``demand'' withdrawal of U.S. forces. It called
the U.S. intervention a ``flagrant violation'' of international law
and respect for sovereignty.
   But it included an element considered vital by the United
States: It recognized the need to re-establish conditions in Panama
to ensure respect for human rights and democracy.
   Both Nicaragua and Cuba endorsed the new resolution, which
expresses ``profound concern'' over serious consequences the
invasion might have for peace and security in Central America.
   It deletes the statement that the U.S. invasion definitely
endangers peace and security in the region and now says it
``might'' threaten stability there.
   The U.S. government said it launched the invasion to unseat
Noriega and restore democracy in a nation where it had been
trampled by that military leader.
   The new resolution was expected to be supported by most Latin
American nations, the Soviet Union and some of its allies, and the
movement professing non-alignment with either superpower.

<HEAD>New Census Figures Could Affect Reapportionment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The populations of five states grew at rates
faster than 10 percent in the last half of the 1980s, the Census
Bureau said Thursday in a report that is causing revised estimates
for congressional reapportionment.
   The Census figures on state population, issued for release
Friday, showed Nevadawith the biggest population gain at 18 percent
from 1985 to the middle of 1989. Arizona had the second highest
growth rate, at 12 percent, followed by Florida and New Hampshire
at 11 percent and California at 10 percent.
   Seven states lost population during the same period, the bureau
said: Iowa, North Dakota, Montana, West Virginia, Wyoming,
Louisiana and Oklahoma.
   The population figures are closely watched at the end of each
decade because they determine how many seats in the U.S. House of
Representatives each state will have. The next reapportionment will
be based on the final 1990 Census figures, which will be collected
in the 10-year census next year.
   The report issued Thursday represents one last checkpoint before
that final, official count, and two forecasting groups on Thursday
issued revised reapportionment predictions based on the trends.
   While the two reports varied on some specifics, they agreed on
the overall trend: states in the Sunbelt will generally pick up
seats lost by states in the Northeast and Midwest.
   The non-profit Population Reference Bureau said that if the
trends in Thursday's report hold true through the final 1990
figures, 11 states are likely to lose one or more seats in Congress
while seven will gain.
   It said New York will lose three seats, Pennsylvania two, Ohio
two, Michigan two, Illinois two, New Jersey one, Massachusetts one,
Iowa one, Kansas one, West Virginia one and Montana one.
   The Population Reference Bureau said California will gain seven
seats, Texas will gain three, Florida three, Virginia one, North
Carolina one, Georgia one and Arizona one.
   The comparable prediction by Election Data Services Inc., a
Washington-based political consulting firm, differed only for a few
states. It said Florida is likely to pick up four seats, rather
than three, and it added Kentucky to the list of those losing
seats, dropping one.
   There is still a wild card in the deck which cannot, at this
point, be predicted with certainty. The Census Bureau figures on
which the projections are based do not include members of the
military and their dependents living overseas.
   The government recently announced that they will be counted in
the 1990 reapportionment. This change could tip the balance in some
states that now appear close to winning or losing a seat.

   The United States would like the
extra troops it sent here out by February but that is unlikely
because Panama's security forces must be rebuilt from scratch, a
senior U.S. Embassy official said Thursday.
   The official told a press briefing the newly formed security
forces are made up largely of officers and troops from Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega's old Panama Defense Forces and that adjustments
are being made province by province.
   ``We cannot get to that fully in one month,'' he said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   He said one change already was made in the southern city of Las
Tablas in Los Santos province.
   While people there were celebrating, he said, the zone military
commander told them to whoop it up all they wanted but to bear in
mind that the Americans were leaving _ and he was staying.
   The man was arrested and replaced, but this is the type of thing
that needs to be sorted out, the official said.
   ``It is no secret that the new government does not have a lot of
confidence in some of these people,'' he said.
   He said former officers who were exiled, arrested or retired
because Noriega didn't like them were called back to duty, but they
make up a small minority of the officer corps.
   He said no indication emerged of a guerrilla movement taking to
the hills following last week's U.S. military invasion that drove
Noriega from power. Should that happen, he said, the United States
_ not Panama _ probably would deal with it.
   The United States had 12,000 troops stationed in Panama and
14,000 more were brought in as reinforcements. The official said
authorities had hoped to be able to withdraw all the extra troops
by February.
   ``That's probably not meetable,'' he said
   He said one problem is that the strength of Noriega's
paramilitary ``Dignity Battalions'' is not known. He said the
battalions are ``still there to be turned back on again.''
   U.S. troops are convinced of Cuban troop involvement but no
evidence has surfaced, he reported.
   He said about 3,300 ``shooters'' were in the 16,000-strong
Defense Forces and about three-fourths of those have been accounted
for. The rest were in support or police roles, he said
   The official said he believes the new government is looking at
forming a security force at a lower level than a conventional army
but stronger than a police force. Also, there may be a move to
decentralize and move some functions to other agencies. Noriega had
consolidated all police-related functions within the Defense Forces
to keep better control.
   The AP reported Tuesday that U.S. military officials want to
establish a professional army but officials of President Guillermo
Endara's government fear an army would become a threat to
democracy. The armed forces ruled Panama the last 21 years.
   The U.S. official said a list exists of people sought by
Panamanian and American forces. Most were caught, but some are
believed to be in the Vatican Embassy and the Cuban Embassy
residence.
   Noriega's wife, Felicidad, is in the residence. She is not on
the wanted list, but investigators want to see if she came by all
she has legally, he said.
   He said former Finance Minister Orville Goodin, who holds
Panamanian and American citizenship, had $3 million in cash with
him when arrested.
   ``I think they just gave it back to the bank he took it from,''
the official said.
   He said the United States does not want to be seen as running a
puppet government in Panama.
   ``What we want to do is fix it right,'' he said. ``We sure don't
want to do this again.''

<HEAD>Deadline Looming for Brennan to Decide on Gubernatorial Race</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JACKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joseph E. Brennan, who traded the
governorship for John R. McKernan's seat in Congress three years
ago, faces a self-imposed deadline this week to decide whether to
challenge McKernan's re-election bid for governor in 1990.
   Brennan, a Democrat, was constitutionally barred from seeking a
third consecutive term in 1986, when he was first elected to
Congress and Republican McKernan was elected governor, but no
longer faces that obstacle.
   For months, Brennan, 55, has courted speculation he would take
on McKernan, 41, and he has been under increasing pressure from
Democratic activists to do so.
   Brennan's closest advisers insisted Thursday that even they did
not know whether he would seek the governorship or a third term in
Congress.
   ``He still hasn't made up his mind completely,'' David Redmond,
Brennan's congressional chief of staff, said after having lunch
with his boss Thursday.
   No announcement was expected before Friday, and ``it's liable to
be Sunday'' at midnight, Redmond said, referring only half-jokingly
to Brennan's promise that he would disclose his plans before the
year's end.
   Brennan's supporters' hopes were buoyed by a recent independent
poll showing that a Brennan-McKernan race would be a virtual dead
heat, and Brennan fueled speculation earlier this month by
appearing before 300 Democratic faithful who had gathered on his
behalf in Augusta.
   ``In a sense,'' he told the crowd on Dec. 9, ``a governor is a
little bit more like a quarterback and, in some respects, in the
United States Congress, you're a little more like an offensive
lineman.''
   McKernan, who has not yet announced his candidacy for
re-election but has begun soliciting campaign contributions, has
said he is convinced Brennan will enter the race.
   Brennan has held open the prospect for too long to do otherwise,
McKernan said last week. ``I just think that when it gets right
down to it ... it's going to be very hard for him to go to his
friends and say, `I'm not doing it.'''
   Brennan's deliberations also are being monitored by Maine's
other member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Republican Rep.
Olympia J. Snowe, whom McKernan married this year.
   Democratic leaders were hedging their bets on Brennan's future
Thursday.
   ``Right now I would not call it, but I'm not a betting person,''
said Democratic State Chairwoman Keron Kerr.
   ``What do you hear?'' state Sen. Barry J. Hobbins, a former
state party chairman and one-time congressional candidate, asked a
reporter who had called to ask him the same question.
   Hobbins said he was surprised that speculation about Brennan's
future has spread so far outside of political circles. He said the
subject came up Thursday morning when he stopped at a rural grocery
store in western Maine.
   ``It's unbelievable,'' said Hobbins. ``Everyone's asking the
question, whether it's in Denmark, Maine, or the State House.''

   U.S. troops prevented a man from
entering the Cuban ambassador's residence Thursday because he
wasn't carrying the proper diplomatic credentials, a U.S. embassy
spokesman said.
   The man was riding with Cuban Ambassador Lazaro Mora when the
two were stopped for inspection by U.S. forces that have surrounded
the embassy, said U.S. spokesman William Barr.
   Mora had his credentials and identified the other man as his
first secretary, said Barr, but the other man didn't have his
credentials.
   After a brief conversation with U.S. troops, the two men drove
off to get the other man's credentials, Barr said.
   ``He was never detained,'' Barr said of the ambassador.
   The Cuban embassy residence has been surrounded since Dec. 20 by
U.S. troops to prevent Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega or his henchmen
from entering or leaving the grounds.
   Earlier, the ambassador's wife told The Associated Press her
husband had been taken away in a U.S. armored car. In a telephone
interview, Maria Elena de Mora said her husband, his personal
secretary and the embassy's commercial attache were involved in the
incident.

   Yo! Put out those fires!
   For generations, merchants at their stalls in the open-air
Italian Market _ a Philly tradition along with the Liberty Bell and
soft pretzels smeared with mustard _ have warmed their hands around
roaring trash fires in metal drums. And millions of moviegoers
watched doo-wop singers crooning around street fires in ``Rocky.''
   But in a state where clean-air laws have banned the burning of
leaves for years, the street fires of South Philadelphia must go,
says city Managing Director James White. He wants the fires doused
by Jan. 7.
   Produce vendors at the Italian Market paused between sales
Thursday to say they'll probably obey, but not cheerfully.
   ``I was born here in 1928 and there's always been fire cans on
this street to keep warm,'' said Anthony Messina. ``But times
change. What can I do? What can I say? I'll probably get a kerosene
heater, but I don't like it.''
   Next door, Lawrence Lacovara, 31, fed cardboard boxes and boards
into a steel-drum fire. What will he do in two weeks, when the ban
will be in force?
   ``Get a kerosene heater, probably, or a heater with a blower.
It's going to cost more, though,'' he said.
   Up the street Joseph Girado carved up empty produce boxes while
his wife and son waited on customers. The cardboard went, piece by
piece, into a drum 20 feet away, where the flames helped ward off
temperatures in the low 30s.
   ``I don't see any damage from that fire, do you?'' he asked.
``That's a tradition. It keeps me warm. It keeps my customers
warm.''
   ``We're trying to make an honest living here. We're working like
dogs _ like animals. If I had any sense I wouldn't be here. We
don't get any benefits, no paid vacation, no retirement _ and now
this.''
   City Councilman James Tayoun, who is going to bat for the
vendors, said the ruckus started because of complaints from the
Health Department.
   ``The merchants cannot physically operate without a decent
source of heat,'' Tayoun said. ``They've been there long before us.
I see no reason we can't allow them to burn clean wood. If they
burn other trash, they should be cited.''
   The federal Environmental Protection Agency isn't involved, but
an EPA spokesman said putting out the fires is probably a good idea.
   ``Research indicates that any kind of open burning is a serious
problem,'' said Lee Blackburn, an EPA expert on air quality. ``A
lot of particulate matter comes out. Inks, solvents and plastics
being burned can release a lot of toxic components.''
   Standing over a roaring trash fire on Ninth Street, Pervis Adams
was unconvinced.
   ``I think kerosene heaters give off as much pollution as this,''
he said. ``What about fireplaces? Are they going to make people
quit using them, too? Go look at junkyards, they're burning there
all the time.''

<HEAD>Snow Scattered Across Northern States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow was scattered from coast to coast across the northern
states Thursday, and temperatures were closer to seasonable levels
than during the last couple of weeks.
   At midday, snow was reported in parts of western Washington
state, southwestern Oregon, the Idaho Panhandle, northern Montana,
western North Dakota, northeastern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin,
Michigan, eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania, New York state, and
northern and central Maine.
   Despite Thursday's snow, a temperature inversion over Washington
state has put warmer air at high elevations and precipitation fell
as rain in the mountains, meaning only a few of the state's ski
resorts have been able to open.
   The heaviest snowfall during the six hours up to noon included 3
inches at Syracuse, N.Y., and 2 inches at Duluth and Hibbing,
Minn., and Havre, Mont.
   About 2 inches of snow fell across northern Wisconsin during the
morning and an additional 2 to 4 inches of snow was expected.
   No record low temperatures were reported Thursday, a marked
change after a month in which more than 700 records were broken or
tied, the National Weather Service said.
   There were no reports of significant rainfall during the six
hours up to noon, although rain extended from west-central Texas
across south-central Texas.
   Thursday's low for the Lower 48 states was 15 degrees below zero
at Houlton, Maine.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 3
degrees at Houlton and Limestone, Maine, to 78 at McAllen, Texas.

   Police were holding eight reputed
members of a notorious Colombian drug ring on Thursday to determine
if they should be extradited to the United States, a police
official said.
   Miguel Gomez Padilla, the national police chief, said the men
belong to the so-called ``Ochoa clan'' and would be held until
authorities could establish whether they were wanted in the United
States on drug trafficking charges.
   Gomez Padilla said there were apparently no outstanding charges
against the men in Colombia.
   He added that all were close relatives of Jorge Luis
Ochoa-Vasquez, Juan David Ochoa-Vasquez and Fabio Ochoa-Vasquez,
the three brothers considered central figures in the powerful
Medellin cocaine cartel. The three are on a list of 12 top drug
traffickers wanted by the United States.
   An anti-narcotics police unit captured the suspects in a raid on
a ranch Wednesday about 125 miles north of Bogota. They were
brought to this capital city.
   Gomez Padilla said authorities were searching intensely for
Pablo Emilio Escobar-Gaviria, the reputed leader of the Medellin
cartel and the most wanted man in Colombia. But he stressed that
the manhunt was part of a general battle against the drug
traffickers.
   ``We are not obsessed with the capture of one or two bandits,''
the police chief told reporters at a news conference on Wednesday.
   Gomez Padilla said that the government's drug crackdown would be
reinforced by the installation of a new government in neighboring
Panama.
   The Colombian press, echoing charges by the U.S. government, has
repeatedly said the country's former dictator, Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, was an important ally of the drug cartels.
   It is charged that Noriega allowed the Colombian cartels to
import cocaine processing chemicals from Panama, to launder drug
money in the country and to use it as a transfer point for cocaine
deliveries to the United States.
   Colombian security forces have seized 31 tons of cocaine this
year, and in the last four months the administration of President
Virgilio Barco has extradited 11 drug suspects to the United States.
   Gomez Padilla said the immediate objective of the government
campaign was to destroy the traffickers' terrorist and paramilitary
organizations.
   Officials have said that the groups are responsible for the 260
terrorist attacks that have killed 209 people since the government
declared war on the traffickers in August.
   The government scored its biggest victory in the struggle when
police shot and killed Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez-Gacha, 42, a Medellin
cartel leader, in a Dec. 15 gunfight on Colombia's northern coast.
   The police chief said that groups of criminals formerly owing
their allegiance to Rodriguez-Gacha had begun to disband as a
result of his death.
   In the last two weeks, police have found the bodies of 22 people
suspected of formerly working for Rodriguez-Gacha, and riots in two
Bogota jails have resulted in the death of 12 prisoners also linked
to the Medellin cartel.
   Officials have blamed the violence on traffickers and other
gangsters battling for control of the slain drug lord's vast
criminal enterprise, which generates billions of dollars each year.
   On Wednesday, a White House spokesman said the Pentagon was
studying a naval and air blockade of Colombia, particularly along
Colombia's Caribbean coast, to cut the flow of cocaine reaching the
United States.
   But the U.S. Embassy here said in a statement Thursday that it
``never has considered a blockade of Colombia'' and that a proposed
anti-drug operation would be conducted in international waters
without affecting legitimate shipping interests.
   The report caused outrage among many Colombians, who think their
country's battle against drug traffickers since the August slaying
of a leading presidential candidate has helped the United States.

   Unfavorable weather Thursday night
forced the seventh postponement of the maiden launch of Martin
Marietta Corp.'s commercial Titan 3 rocket.
   Company officials reported winds about 30,000 feet above the
launch area were too high and the temperature on the ground was a
few degrees too cold.
   A Titan 3 launch requires a reading of at least 62 degrees to
preserve the resiliency of synthetic O-rings between joints in the
two solid fuel rocket boosters.
   The launch was rescheduled for 7:06 p.m. EST Friday. It was
originally scheduled for Dec. 7, but a combination of bad weather
and technical problems resulted in repeated delays.
   The Titan 3 is to boost into orbit communications satellites for
a Japanese company and the British Ministry for Defence.

<HEAD>Peruvian Rebels Attack Police; U.S. Helicopters Reported Involved</HEAD>

   Maoist guerrillas attacked a jungle police
post at dawn Thursday in the coca-rich Upper Huallaga Valley but
were repelled with the help of U.S. helicopters stationed in the
area for drug raids, officials said.
   One policeman was killed and four were wounded, they reported.
   At about 6:45 a.m., about 100 Shining Path rebels with
submachine guns and bazookas attacked the police post in Nuevo
Progreso, a jungle area 260 miles northeast of Lima, according to
Interior Minister Agustin Mantilla.
   Mantilla said the guerrillas fled after three Peruvian police
helicopters attacked them.
   A government anti-narcotics official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the three helicopters were dispatched from the
U.S.-built antidrug base at Santa Lucia, about six miles from Nuevo
Progreso.
   Eight helicopters on loan to Peruvian police from the U.S. State
Department are stationed at the base for use in antidrug
operations. The helicopters are flown by American contract pilots
but are officially under police command _ the only police
helicopters that operate in the area.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Gene Bigler said no U.S. helicopters or
personnel were involved in the battle.
   He told The Associated Press two helicopters piloted by
Americans flew a reconnaissance mission Thursday morning from the
base. He said base personnel received a request for assistance from
the police post at Nuevo Progreso, but said he did not know if the
reconnaissance flight was related to the attack.
   Bigler said three Peruvian army helicopters stationed in nearby
Uchiza picked up the police casualties and took them to Santa Lucia
so they could be flown to Lima.
   A military spokesman in Lima had no comment.
   The Peruvian drug official said three helicopters from the base
flown by Peruvians took part in the Thursday fray and pursued
retreating rebels.
   Bigler said no Peruvian pilots or co-pilots currently are at the
base.
   Santa Lucia is the operations center for U.S. drug agents
working with Peruvian police to attack clandestine airstrips and
coca-processing laboratories used by cocaine smugglers.
   Twenty to 40 Americans, including agents, contract pilots and
mechanics, work out of the base, where eight UH-1 (Huey)
helicopters are stationed. The helicopters have door-mounted M-60
machine guns.
   Huallaga Valley is the world's single largest source of the coca
leaf. Most of the leaf is made into coca paste and sent to Colombia
to be refined into cocaine.
   Joint operations began in September. Peru suspended them Dec. 21
to protest the U.S. invasion of Panama. The government lifted the
suspension and operations resumed Tuesday.
   Valley drug traffickers operate in league with Shining Path
rebels, who protect them from police for a share of drug profits.
   Bigler said U.S. law bars U.S. personnel and helicopters from
being used to fight the guerrillas. U.S. officials have
acknowledged, however, that antidrug operations could result in
confrontations with the rebels.
   The Shining Path began its insurgency in 1980 near Ayacucho, 235
miles southeast of Lima in the Andes Mountains. The rebels now
operate throughout the highlands and in the coca-producing jungles
of the northeast.
   The government says more than 17,000 people have died in the
violence.

<TEXT>
   Peru's ambassador to Panama, Mario Castro, has
resigned because of differences with President Alan Garcia over
Panama, according to a letter made public Thursday.
   Castro said in his resignation letter that he was leaving
because of ``substantial differences'' with the Garcia government's
position concerning the ``Panamanian problem.'' He also cited the
``injurious language employed to describe democratic leaders'' in
Panama.
   Garcia recalled Castro from Panama City three months ago to show
displeasure with the regime of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   But the president condemned the U.S. invasion of Panama and
refused to recognize the government of Guillermo Endara, installed
after U.S. troops ousted Noriega. Castro has publicly expressed his
support for the Endara government, however.
   Foreign Minister Guillermo Larco Cox called Endara a ``Judas,''
suggesting he betrayed other Latin American lands by going along
with the U.S. action.
   In a news interview, Castro opposed Garcia's call for new
elections in Panama. He said Endara qualified as legitimate
president of Panama because of his victory in the May 7 elections,
which Noriega annulled.
   ``The votes that elected Mr. Endara are just as valid as those
that elected Alan Garcia'' in 1985, Castro said.

   The pilot of an F-15 Eagle jet fighter
was missing Thursday after his plane crashed into the Gulf of
Mexico during a mock dogfight, an Air Force spokesman said.
   The single-seat jet from Eglin Air Force Base crashed about 40
miles southeast of this Florida Panhandle community at 11:42 a.m.,
said Capt. Gary Perugini, public affairs officer for the 33rd
Tactical Fighter Wing.
   The plane was one of two F-15s from the 33rd that were engaged
in a combat training mission against two F-16 Falcon jets from
Moody Air Force Base in Georgia, Perugini said.
   The other three planes returned to their home bases, he said.
   The Coast Guard assumed responsibility for search and rescue
Thursday afternoon, but there were no reports of either the pilot
or any wreckage, military spokesmen said.
   An interim accident investigation board was convened after the
crash Thursday.
   The F-15, manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, is the Air Force's
most sophisticated fighter, powered by twin jet engines and capable
of flying at 2.5 times the speed of sound.

<HEAD>Member of Noriega Defense Team Says He Wants Out</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An attorney representing Manuel Antonio Noriega on
federal drug charges said Thursday he is unhappy with public
discussions of the case by other members of the defense team and
has asked to withdraw from the case.
   Neal Sonnett of Miami said one of the reasons for his request is
his disagreement with the other attorneys ``over some of the
statements to the media.'' He said he would prefer not to go into
detail or discuss the other reasons.
   ``It was a question of drawing the line between function as a
lawyer and a general spokesperson,'' he told The Associated Press.
``I didn't really want to create a firestorm. There have been other
conflicts between me and co-counsel but nothing I feel is
appropriate to discuss.
   ``I have consistently refused to comment on Panamanian affairs _
they are outside my responsibility. It's important for me to
practice law.''
   Sonnett made the announcement official Wednesday in a five-page
motion asking the U.S. District Court here to allow him to quit the
case.
   Two of the three other Noriega attorneys reacted with surprise
to Sonnett's motion. Both Frank Rubino and Raymond Takiff said they
had experienced no conflict. Attorney Steve Kollin said he had no
comment.
   ``We've had no problems whatsoever, just general differences of
opinion,'' Takiff said.
   He said he found it puzzling, especially after Sonnett recently
appeared on CNN to talk about Noriega.
   ``It's just too hot in the kitchen,'' Takiff said.
   Sonnett denied he had talked about the deposed Panamanian
dictator on the news show. He said he appeared as president of the
National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers to talk about
forfeiture of attorney's fees.
   A February 1988 indictment accuses Noriega and 14 others of
running drugs into the United States and using Panama as a safe
haven.
   Noriega, driven from power in a U.S. invasion of Panama last
week, is currently seeking asylum at the papal embassy in Panama
City while the U.S. government attempts to negotiate his
extradition.

   U.S. forces arrested an Israeli
security adviser and three other top aides of Manuel Antonio
Noriega on Thursday, including two associates who abandoned the
Vatican embassy where the ousted general has taken refuge.
   Banks meanwhile opened for the first time since the Dec. 20 U.S.
invasion and thousands of public workers were paid as millions of
dollars confiscated by U.S. troops were returned to Panama's new
government.
   Noriega, the nation's fallen strongman, remained in the Vatican
embassy with 17 other people, including at least two senior aides,
according to the Rev. Javier Villanueva.
   ``Noriega has spoken very little and does not go out on the
patio. Generally he stays in his room,'' said Villanueva in a
telephone interview with The Associated Press.
   But two of the general's top aides, Lt. Col. Carlos Velardes and
Lt. Col. Arnulfo Castrejon, left the shelter of the embassy and
were taken into custody by U.S. troops that surround the area,
according to U.S. Army Lt. Col. Jerry Murguia.
   Murguia also said Lt. Col. Roberto Cedeno was arrested in the
last 24 hours, and a senior U.S. Embassy official said Michel
Harari, a former Israeli intelligence agent and top security
adviser to Noriega, had also been detained.
   The senior official said the United States would like to pull
out by February the 14,000 troops it sent in for the attack, but
said the soldiers will probably stay longer because Panama needs
time to recreate a security force.
   Traffic jams resumed in the capital of 1 million, and the Panama
Canal returned to 24-hour operation for the first time since the
invasion.
   People raced to withdraw money from banks. With Noriega
seemingly out of the picture, many Panamanians said they felt a
sense of security returning.
   ``I'm here because I need some cash. I don't want to withdraw
all my money,'' said a man who identified himself only as Carlos.
``It is safer here now than ever before.''
   A Panamanian official said President Guillermo Endara's
government sent a letter to the Vatican asking that Noriega be
turned over.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
letter was sent by the Foreign Ministry, but he did not know
whether the government asked that Noriega be turned over to U.S.
authorities or to Panama.
   U.S. armored cars were on the streets, and occasional patrols
roamed residential neighborhoods to search cars for Noriega
loyalists.
   The U.S. Embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the United States estimated the Panamanian Defense Forces had
been 16,000 strong, and that most of the 3,300 ``shooters'' capable
of resistance were accounted for.
   He said the security forces are being reconstituted, but there
is some concern about holdovers from the Noriega days.
   ``It is no secret that the new government does not have a lot of
confidence in some of these people,'' said the official.
   Troops surrounding the Vatican embassy seemed prepared to stay
awhile as negotiations lingered. In Rome, spokesman Joaquin Navarro
said the Vatican still hoped to resolve the crisis within days but
he gave no details.
   Villanueva came out of the embassy at one point Thursday and
appeared to argue with U.S. soldiers, pointing to his ears and then
to small but powerful olive-green loudspeakers blasting rock music.
   The troops set up the outdoor stereo system Wednesday, but it
was unclear whether it was to relieve their own boredom or serenade
Noriega with such tunes as ``Somebody's Watching You'' and ``You're
No Good.''
   In Texas, where President Bush is hunting, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said Noriega's fate is now ``in the hands of the
Vatican.'' He said U.S. troops were ready to move in if hostages
were taken but that there was no indication this could happen.
   The Los Angeles Times reported that Monsignor Sebastian Laboa,
the papal nuncio, had given U.S. forces a letter authorizing them
to enter the embassy if Noriega took hostages, but the existence of
a letter could not be confirmed.
   Villanueva, a parish priest helping the papal nuncio, said
Noriega largely keeps to his room, speaks with few people and does
not go out in the yard.
   ``Remember, he is not the owner of this house,'' said
Villanueva. ``He does not move around.''
   Velardes, who left the embassy, was chaplain of the Panamanian
Defense Forces, and Castrejon had been the officer on duty at
Noriega's military headquarters on Dec. 16, the day an unarmed U.S.
Marine officer was killed nearby.
   Harari had served as one of Noriega's top security advisers and
an instructor for the Defense Forces, while Cedeno had been chief
of Noriega's state security intelligence.
   Villanueva said Col. Nivaldo Madrinan, chief of Noriega's
investigations department, and Capt. Eliezer Gaytan, chief of
security, were among those inside the nunciature.
   He said four members of the Basque separatist group ETA, along
with one of their wives, also had taken shelter as a precaution.
They were in exile in Panama as part of an agreement with the
Spanish government, Villanueva said.
   He refused to identify 10 other people staying at the embassy.
   The embassy official said Noriega's wife, Felicidad, was inside
the Cuban Embassy residence. That embassy is also surrounded by
U.S. troops because it was thought Noriega henchmen would flee
there.
   Fitzwater reiterated the U.S. stance that Noriega should be
handed over to the United States, where he is wanted on drug
trafficking charges.
   A U.S. military spokesman said Thursday that $5.8 million had
been confiscated from Noriega's men and turned over to the
Panamanian government.
   As Panama's 110 banks reopened and the cash began to flow into
the economy, the country's 150,000 public employees began receiving
their paychecks. Customers lined up early.
   Comptroller Ruben Dario Carles said Japanese ships will keep
flying the Panamanian flag. More than 12,000 Japanese ships fly
Panama's flag, representing nearly $50 million in annual income
through fees and services.
   In its efforts to oust Noriega, the Bush administration had
ordered U.S. ports closed to Panamanian-flag ships and imposed
economic sanctions that froze $400 million in government assets and
revenues.
   U.S. officials also told the government the United States will
consider some form of assistance to compensate for the $1 billion
lost when looters sacked hundreds of stores after the U.S. invasion.
   The U.S. Embassy official said about 300 Panamanian civilians
died in the fighting. He said reports of large numbers of civilian
bodies being found were unfounded.
   The Southern Command said Wednesday that 23 American servicemen
and two dependents have been killed and 322 Americans wounded since
the United States invaded. It said 297 Panamanians troops were
killed and 123 wounded.

   The Lincoln Park Zoo announced Thursday the birth

   The baby was born Wednesday to a gorilla named Kowali, who is
mated to Gino, said senior keeper Pat Sass.
   The sex of the yet-unnamed baby is still undetermined because
Kowali is guarding it closely, Ms. Sass said. ``It depends on when
we can get a good enough look,'' she said. ``Mother is very
protective.''
   The birth of the infant brings the lowland gorilla population at
the Great Ape House to 22, the majority of them born in captivity.
   Ms. Sass said it is the second baby for 11-year-old Kowali,
whose mother and grandmother were born in captivity, and the first
child sired by Gino, who will turn 9 on Saturday.

<TEXT>
   Friends and former classmates of ``Today''
co-host Jane Pauley say it will be hard to wake up without her when
she leaves the show after 13 years Friday.
   Among the former schoolmates of the Indianapolis native is Ken
Conway, an Indianapolis psychiatrist who teamed with Pauley on
Warren Central High School's speech team until they graduated in
1968.
   ``I thought the world of Janie then and still do, which is how
most of us who knew her back then feel,'' Conway said.
   A spokesman for the NBC-TV show confirmed that camera crews have
been in Indianapolis this month capturing footage of Pauley's
hometown to be used in a tribute when she says goodbye Friday.
   Pauley, 39, an Indiana University graduate and former reporter
for WISH-TV in Indianapolis, will be replaced by Deborah Norville.
   ``Janie's favorite expression used to be, `Bless your heart,'''
said Mary Murphy Fridlund, a physical therapist at Community
Hospital and '69 Warren Central graduate. ``That's the kind of
person she was, neighborly and caring.
   ``I just get to see bits and pieces of `Today.' ... I only tune
in to see how Janie is and how she looks. I doubt I'll watch if
she's not there, unless there is an overwhelming news event like a
hostage crisis.''
   Bill Shaw, 41, a writer and contributor to People magazine,
dated Pauley for several years and remains a close friend. He
served as a go-between with Pauley and Life magazine, which
features her in this month's cover story.
   ``When I was talking to Jane, all this controversy over Deborah
Norville was breaking. Yet she was handling it with class, poise
and even a sense of calm,'' Shaw said. ``I shouldn't have been
surprised. It reminded me of the way she handled the Chicago
situation.''
   TV critics blasted Pauley, then 24, when she became the Windy
City's first evening news anchorwoman. She survived those attacks
and replaced Barbara Walters on ``Today'' in 1976.
   Pauley, elected 1967 governor of Indiana Girls State, also was
state champ in girl's extemporaneous speaking.
   ``Regardless of subject, in any class I was in with Jane she
always got the highest grade on the test,'' recalled Ward Beckham,
39, director of marketing for Community Centers of Indianapolis.
``Not only was she intelligent and attractive, she was always
approachable, never `stuck up.'''
   ``I won't watch `Today' with the same interest. I certainly
won't watch with the same feeling in my heart.''

   Interest rates skyrocketed to 600
percent a month at Argentine banks Thursday as economic turmoil
continued to undermine the credibility of the government of
President Carlos Menem.
   Banks resorted to paying their largest depositors a 600 percent
annual rate to retain funds that otherwise might be withdrawn and
converted to U.S. dollars.
   Investors here traditionally covet dollars for stability and
safe returns but the last two months have increasinly bought as
many dollars as are on the market, driving down the austral,
Argentina's national currency, to 1,950-1 on Thursday from 728-1 on
Nov. 1 _ 63 percent lower.
   During that time, one economy minister and two Central Bank
presidents were sacked, two economic stabilization plans were
launched and financial institutions were closed four times by
government order.
   Said local historian Felix Luna, ``There is no reason to be
optimistic, even if one wants to be.''
   Analysts attribute the turmoil in financial markets to a lack of
public confidence in the ability of Menem, who took office in July,
to carry out his proposed program of economic reform because of
opposition by powerful unions, businesses that sell to the state
and his own labor-based Peronist Party.
   He is seeking reduction of state expenditures that contribute to
chronic inflation and the sale of public companies that annually
ring up huge deficits.
   A survey by the Federation of Commercial Centers meanwhile
indicated that in the capital Buenos Aires, medicine prices soared
by an average 334 percent in December; food, 210 percent; hardware
items, 240 percent; clothing, 200 percent.
   Pharmacies reported their distributors were refusing to deliver
goods, particularly imported medicines, for fear of charging too
little and not being able to cover the cost of resupplying.
   Wages, linked to the government's calculation of inflation, have
failed to keep pace. Many public and private employees received
raises of 6.5 percent in early December to compensate them for the
cost of living in November.
   Economy Minister Antonio Gonzalez predicted that inflation in
December may top 50 percent.
   Ground crews at Aerolineas Argentinas staged a surprise strike
Thursday that resulted in the suspension of outgoing flights. They
demanded immediate wage hikes and participation in the proposed
sale of the state-owned carrier.
   Bus drivers, subway and commuter train operators, court clerks,
doctors and nurses at municipal hospitals, teachers and other
public employees all have conducted job actions in recent weeks in
demand of higher pay.
   Inflation for the first 11 months of 1989 increased by 3,731
percent, according to the National Institute of Statistics and
Census.

   Rescuers crawled through the rubble
of a workers' club Friday seeking victims of Australia's first
fatal earthquake, which killed nine people, injured 107 and
devastated sections of the nation's sixth largest city.
   State police headquarters in Sydney, 75 miles south of
Newcastle, revised the death toll in Thursday's quake from 11 to
nine, but said more people may be trapped in the wreckage of the
Newcastle Workers' Club.
   A preliminary estimate put overall damage from the quake at $1
billion.
   The army was sent in to stop looting.
   The temblor toppled buildings, crumbled walls, damaged pipes and
knocked out power.
   From Texas, President Bush sent a message of condolence to Prime
Minister Bob Hawke.
   Britain's Queen Elizabeth II also sent quake condolences.
   Two floors of the workers' club collapsed into the parking
basement, where 24 cars lay under broken concrete slabs, police
said. Six bodies were taken from the club. Most were elderly women
who met Thursdays to play bingo after getting their pension checks,
a police officer said.
   He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Three other victims were killed by falling debris and shop
awnings as the quake, measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale, hit at
10:28 a.m.
   Cave expert David Rothbury said he climbed into open spaces in
the rubble but found no bodies.
   ``There are some spaces big enough to get into, but there was no
one there,'' he said. ``We asked for the machines to be quiet so we
could hear any cries for help, but we didn't hear anything.''
   Elsewhere in this industrial city of 500,000, residents were
surveying the damage and waiting for the predicted aftershocks.
   Police cordoned off the debris-littered central business
district until high-rise office builings could be inspected for
damage.
   Army Maj. Brian Jordon said up to 150 buildings, including
homes, were so badly damaged they may have to be demolished. He
heads a 200-member unit ordered in by Hawke to help police.
   The city council met in emergency session Friday to gauge the
damage and plan relief programs for homeless residents.
   Water and telephone services were gradually being restored, a
council officer said.
   Scientists at Canberra-based Australian Seismological Center
said the quake was one of the most severe on record and the first
to cliam lives.
   Its epicenter was eight miles west of suburban Hamilton,
occurred at a depth of slightly more than six miles, and lasted 29
seconds.
   Australia's biggest earthquake was at Meeberrie, in remote,
sparsely populated Western Australia in 1941 and measured 7.7 on
the Richter scale.
   Thursday's quake was felt throughout New South Wales state _
including Sydney, where it struck like a sharp jolt _ and police
said it was the first in Australia to hit a heavily populated area.
   Newcastle is the most populous city in New South Wales after
Sydney. The city on the southeast coast is a major shipping port
and coal-mining center.
   Hawke, grieving over the Christmastime death of his 92-year-old
father, cut short holiday plans to visit the disaster site.
   The army was called in to patrol streets. Police spokesman Simon
Latimer said there were reports of looting in the business district.
   A vast number of homes across the state lost electricity and
emergency services were stretched thin. Crews were flown from
Sydney to help.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of of the energy released by an
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seimograph. A quake measuring 5 can cause considerable damage and a
quake measuring 6 can cause severe damage.
   The earthquake that hit Northern California on Oct. 17 killed 67
people and measured 7.1.

<TEXT>
   South Korea agreed in principle to
bear the estimated $3 billion needed to relocate all U.S. military
facilities out of Seoul, the Yonhap News Agency reported Friday,
quoting government sources.
   It said a final decision will be made at U.S.-Korean talks in
February.
   U.S. military spokesman Bill Fullerton declined to comment but
noted that Gen. Louis C. Menetrey, the top U.S. military commander
here, expressed hope on several occasions that the Seoul government
would cover all relocation costs.
   Both countries have been discussing the relocation after
agreeing in principle on moving all U.S. military facilities out of
the capital by 1996, including an 18-hole golf course.
   The facilities consist mainly of army headquarters and support
units in Yongsan, covering 670 acres. Many Koreans say the location
hampers city development.
   Yonhap said the facilities will be relocated in Taejon in
central South Korea instead of Osan, originally suggested by the
American side.
   About 43,000 U.S. troops are in South Korea under a 1954 mutual
defense treaty.

<HEAD>Whimsical Depression Musical Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs Planned.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Romance in Hard Times,'' a new musical set in
the Depression, attempts to be whimsical but follows too many
tangents and rattles around rather messily.
   At least it has some goofily charming moments. The show was
written and composed by William Finn, who has been acclaimed here
for ``March of the Falsettos.'' It opened Thursday night at the
off-Broadway Newman Theater at the Public Theater complex.
   Lillias White is a plus. She has a striking voice, which she
wisely doesn't push to its limits, and a stage presence which adds
up to adorable. She played Effie the second time ``Dreamgirls'' was
on Broadway.
   Finn's abilities to write good songs, at least for part of his
extensive score, and to float more than one song at the same time
are pluses. So are some of the other performers, particularly a
five-person singing-dancing chorus of unemployed. But the plot,
which doesn't really arise from the Depression, is a mess.
   ``Romance in Hard Times'' is set in a Manhattan soup kitchen.
The unemployed are ``Standing in Line'' for soup.
   Hennie, played by Miss White, tells her always silent husband
Harvey (Lawrence Clayton) that she's pregnant and hopes that he
will now speak. Everybody sings ``Harvey Promised To Change the
World,'' explaining that when he didn't, he quit talking. However,
Clayton displays a fine voice in songs which convey his thoughts.
   Boris, played by Cleavant Derricks, proclaims his love for
Hennie, though she is married.
   Now, events, fantasy and the muddle speed up. Eleanor Roosevelt
enters, made up like Pat Nixon, in Nancy Reagan's red and Barbara
Bush's pearls, with a shallow optimism like nobody's. She stays.
Babe Ruth, Shirley Temple and Bojangles have walk-ons.
   Hennie saves the Supreme Court from a fire, is promised a
reward, doesn't get it. Boris robs a bank. Harvey gets shot. Hennie
decides not to have her baby in that kind of world and gets
continually larger for some two years.
   The soup kitchen becomes prosperous selling Hennie's Soup. But
Boris, who robbed to give money to Hennie, has become a national
hero. Buyers boycot the soup when Boris is imprisoned after
proclaiming his love to the now-widowed but still-pregnant Hennie.
She called the police.
   In a final plea for romance, no matter what, Victor Trent Cook
steps out of the chorus and unleashes his rock-oriented high tenor
on ``You Can't Let Romance Die.'' That is, presumably, the message.
   David Warren directed, keeping movement flowing briskly over a
stage design by James Youmans in which ``outdoors'' is a ramp above
the soup kitchen. Marcia Milgrom Dodge choreographed. Bruce
Coughlin's orchestrations didn't enhance the songs.

   The state's attorney general refused
Thursday to reopen an investigation into the fatal shootings of two
13-year-old Hmong boys by a police officer.
   ``For me to go forward with (a new investigation) would raise
serious ethical questions,'' Hubert H. Humphrey III said after
meeting for about two hours with a coalition representing
Minnesota's minority communities.
   A Dakota County grand jury on Dec. 8 refused to indict Kenneth
Murphy, an Inver Grove Height police officer, for the fatal
shootings Nov. 15 of Ba See Lor and Thai Yang, both from St. Paul.
   The boys were shot in the back as they fled from a stolen car.
   The officer told authorities he believed Yang was pointing a gun
at him. Police found no weapon, but they believe Murphy mistook a
screwdriver found near the boys' bodies for a pistol.
   The attorney general's office investigated the shooting at the
request of Dakota County authorities and presented the case to a
Dakota County grand jury, which on Dec. 8 declined to indict Murphy.
   Humphrey defended the state's investigation Thursday, and said
the case could not be reopened unless significant new evidence were
disclosed.
   Although Humphrey refused to reopen the case, members of the
coalition said they were satisfied with his plan to appoint a task
force to look into their other concerns.
   ``We had what I would consider a very good meeting,'' said Steve
Zachary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People.
   John Huyen, president of the Vietnamese-American Association,
said the coalition's main concern is to prevent future incidents.
   About 350 people attended a vigil for the dead boys in the
Capitol Rotunda while Humphrey met first with the boys' families
and then with the coalition representatives.
   Among the coalition's other requests were:
   _Annual training for all law enforcement officers and attorneys
representing law enforcement agencies on the use of deadly force
and on the cultural diversity in their communities.
   _A code of conduct for law enforcement officers with special
emphasis on the use of deadly force.
   _Creation of panel with powers of a grand jury to review
allegations of police misconduct and violations of the proposed
code of conduct.
   ``What we need to do is turn the tragedy of these circumstances
into the opportunity to realize that we must confront racism and
discrimination,'' Humphrey said. ``We must use this as an
opportunity to look toward the future as to how we can prevent that
in Minnesota.''
   Yusef Mgeni, president of the Urban Coalition of Minneapolis and
an organizer of the vigil, said the minority communities were
united in protesting the deaths.
   ``This is not just a Southeast Asian issue,'' Mgeni said. ``It
affects all communities of color.''
   Mgeni said there were parallels between the Inver Grove Heights
shooting and other recent shootings of minority members in the Twin
Cities, as well as in incidents of alleged police brutality against
non-whites.
   The vigil was held ``to keep this and similar cases in the
public eye,'' Mgeni said, ``and to try to prevent an incident like
this from reoccurring, with anybody's children: white, black, red,
brown or yellow.''

   A twin-engined plane crashed into the second
floor of a house Thursday, killing the pilot and his passenger,
authorities said.
   The pilot, Floyd E. Smith, 75, and Elwood Graham were testing
the Beech 60 aircraft in preparation for a flight Friday to Florida
when it crashed around noon into the home of Willard and Antoinette
Flatley, not far from Lake Erie.
   The Flatleys were not home when the plane crashed, heavily
damaging the second floor of the house.
   ``I looked up. I saw it was low and it was making a strange
noise,'' said Paul Petak, a neighbor. ``Then it looked like it was
upside down. And it straightened up and went right down.''
   Smith was the president and founder of Automation Devices Inc.
in Fairview, and Graham was a shop employee who had been with the
company for more than 20 years.
   The flight originated from Erie International Airport and was
scheduled to return there. Airport Director Rosemary Noble said the
pilot apparently radioed the tower shortly before noon about an
engine problem.
   The pilot's first report indicated one of the engines was going
on and off, Ms. Noble said. The second report mentioned trouble
with the second engine. The crash apparently occurred about 30
seconds later.
   The plane was owned by Automation Devices, which employs 44
people in the manufacture of vibratory feeders, devices that feed
parts onto production lines.

<TEXT>
   The winds of change sweeping across the Communist
world have reached distant Mongolia, where a newly formed
organization is demanding democratic reform.
   The Mongolian Democratic Union, made up of students, writers,
artists and intellectuals, has held two Sunday open-air rallies in
the capital Ulan Bator this month, a foreign diplomat there said
Thursday.
   The diplomat, reached by telephone from Beijing, said the
government had not interfered in the peaceful demonstrations and
the official press and television carried reports on the rallies,
saying they attracted up to 1,000 people. He said there were no
reports of arrests.
   Mongolia, ruled by Communists since 1921 and long a client state
of the Soviet Union, in recent years has cautiously followed the
Soviet lead in embracing ``perestroika,'' or reform.
   But it appears the recent dramatic changes in the Soviet Union
and Eastern Europe, which have been reported in Mongolia's press,
may be reverberating in this sparsely populated nation of vast
grasslands and deserts.
   Ulan Bator Radio said in a recent broadcast the Mongolian
Democratic Union's 15-member coordinating council had adopted a
draft charter and had petitioned the Great Hural, the nation's
parliament, for official status.
   Soviet reports said the union was demanding an end to Communist
Party influence over government affairs, debate on setting up a
multiparty system, a full-time parliament and establishment of a
commission to investigate those who supported past repressive
regimes. The reports said demonstrators shouted for an end to
bureaucracy and special privileges for those in authority.
   The size of the union, and the outcome of its bid for
legitimacy, were not known, but it appeared to have sympathizers
within official quarters.
   The party-controlled press, while not outrightly criticizing
today's leaders, prints articles about social and economic
problems. The party paper Unen recently noted that thousands of
innocent people had been victimized by repression in the past, and
demanded ``large-scale legal renewal'' to guarantee the rights and
freedoms of Mongolia's 2 million people.
   Unen also wrote that writers in the past had been killed and
imprisoned for their social convictions, and called for the
state-run Union of Mongolian Writers to be replaced by an
independent national pen club.
   Ulan Bator Radio also said that at a session of the parliament
earlier this month, members were outspoken in criticizing the
slowness of economic reform, saying fundamental changes in price
and wage systems had yet to be carried out.
   The Communist Party, in a plenary session this month broadcast
for the first time on television and radio, reasserted its role as
the ``political vanguard'' of the nation. But it also said it must
``render active influence on the process of reconstruction in all
spheres of social life by renewing itself first.''
   Jambyn Batmonh, a former university rector who became party and
state leader five years ago, told the plenum Mongolia has ``natural
interest in the experiences of reforms and renovation taking
place'' in the Soviet Union and other Communist countries.
   So far, open criticisms of the party have been directed at the
Stalinist purges in the 1930s and 1940s, when the nation's religion
and culture were suppressed, and the forced collectivization
policies of Yumjaagiyn Tsedenbal, ruler for 40 years until his
ouster in 1984.
   The foreign diplomat said direct attacks on current leaders are
still avoided, and the Mongolian Democratic Union is working within
existing legal frameworks, ``not wishing to break from the mold.''

<TEXT>
   Officials said Thursday that the last
senior leader of the militant, ultranationalist Sinhalese People's
Liberation Front was killed in a gun battle after being taken into
custody.
   They also said the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the
dominant Tamil guerrilla group, killed 28 members of a rival Tamil
organization in an ambush late Wednesday, but three Tigers also
died.
   Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne said Sinhalese extremist Saman
Piyasiri Fernando was seized Tuesday in a Colombo suburb but died
``when a police team escorting him was fired at from inside a
house.''
   He said six more men were killed inside the house by police
gunfire, including another Sinhalese extremist leader known as
Ragama Soma.
   Three other leaders died earlier in similar circumstances,
including the Sinhalese front's supreme leader, Rohana Wijeweera,
after he was captured in November.
   According to accounts by government officials and witnesses, as
of Thursday at least 67 people died over a three-day span in the
ethnic wars.
   The Sinhalese People's Liberation Front began a terrorist
offensive against the Sinhalese-dominated government in 1987,
saying it compromised the interests of the Sinhalese majority
through its peace efforts with the Tamil minority.
   Initial fighting tended to pit Sinhalese against Tamils, but
massacres and jungle wars led to killings within each ethnic
community.
   Sri Lankan military officials said the Tigers ambushed two
trucks carrying 35 members of the Eelam People's Revolutionary
Liberation Front near Nelukulam, about 130 miles northeast of
Colombo.
   Residents of the area gave the casualty figures of 31 dead.
   Sri Lanka's violence grew out of friction between the Sinhalese
and the Tamils, who make up 18 percent of the country's 16 million
people and claim they are discriminated against in jobs, education
and language.

   Gunmen defending positions inside a
Sikh temple fought an hourlong battle with security forces
Thursday, and at least four police officers were killed,
authorities said.
   The suspected Sikh extremists escaped after the fighting at the
Darbar Sahib temple in this rural area in the northern state of
Punjab, which borders Pakistan.
   The temple, one of the holiest Sikh shrines, is next in
importance to the Golden Temple in Amristar, about 15 miles south.
   The Amritsar shrine was attacked by the army on June 3, 1984, to
flush out Sikh extremists. Sikh militants have been fighting since
1983 to establish a separate homeland in Punjab, a rich farming
state in northern India.
   The deputy inspector-general of police, Gurinder Singh Bhullar,
said the fighting began after extremists ambushed and killed four
policemen outside the temple.
   ``The extremists then ran inside taking with them a wireless
set, a light machine gun, three rifles and some ammunition of the
policemen,'' Bhullar said.
   The extremists defended their positions for an hour as about 500
policemen surrounded the temple and exchanged fire, he said.
   About 85 Sikhs came out with their hands raised after the
shooting, but police failed to find any of the militants inside.
   Sikh militants are demanding an independent nation because they
say they are discriminated against culturally and politically by
Hindus and the Hindu-dominated government.
   Sikhs, who form 2 percent of India's 880 million people, are in
a slight majority in Punjab. Nationwide, Hindus comprise 82 percent.

   The government will stop reimbursing operators
of nuclear weapons plants for their own criminal fines,
environmental penalties, fraudulent losses and other questionable
costs, officials say.
   The decision, spurred by growing congressional criticism of the
weapons program, marks the most fundamental change in the Energy
Department's weapons contracting system since companies were
recruited to build the first atomic bombs in the 1940s.
   The companies traditionally have been allowed to recover
virtually all their costs, even those resulting from their own
negligence. The logic was that weapons production was so
specialized and vital to national security that the government
could not afford to risk losing a plant operator over money matters.
   The new thinking, under Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, is
that the weapons contractors will perform better if they are held
accountable for their mistakes.

   Angry homeowners, besieged oil delivery
companies and governors across the Northeast are calling on federal
officials to find out why home heating oil prices skyrocketed this
month to their highest levels ever.
   The price jump from about 85 cents a gallon two weeks ago to as
high as $1.62 per gallon now has led officials from Gov. Mario
Cuomo of New York to Gov. Judd Gregg in New Hampshire to call for
federal investigations of possible gouging and price-fixing.
   Whether oil companies are in collusion or not, public officials
and industry experts agree that an unusual confluence of events has
led to the highest prices ever for home heating oil.
   Events ranging from low water levels on the Rhine River in
Germany to a refinery explosion in Louisiana have contributed to
the upsurge, officials say. Above all, though, is the record cold
spell that has gripped much of the nation this month. For the
Northeast, forecasters are calling for more chill temperatures this
weekend after a brief respite.

   President Bush is mulling a Pentagon plan to
draw a ``much, much tighter noose'' around Colombia with a virtual
air and sea blockade designed to halt illicit drug exports, a
senior administration official says.
   The plan is part of a comprehensive set of proposals from the
nation's regional and specialized military commanders that Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney directed to the White House, said the
Pentagon official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Bush is slated to attend an anti-drug summit in Colombia in

   Although the operation could be launched before the summit, the
official refused to offer a start-up date for the maneuver.

   Murder rates soared to new highs in some of the nation's largest
cities in 1989, but at least eight cities saw a surprising drop in
homicides.
   Police were quick to blame crack for homicide records that were
set in at least seven cities, but they were less certain about why
there was less killing elsewhere.
   One official suggested that violence may have ebbed in cities
where drug dealers have already won their turf wars by killing off
rivals and dividing up territory.
   Final 1989 statistics in most cities won't be prepared for at
least several weeks, but a preliminary survey by The Associated
Press of police departments in more than 30 cities shows that the
number of homicides rose in most of them.

   The Japanese economy heads into the 1990s riding a
boom based on spending at home. Its fundamental shift away from
export dependence may make it an even greater powerhouse in the
next century, say economists.
   At the same time, American exports to Japan have been rising.
They jumped 34 percent in 1988 and were increasing at a 19-percent
rate for 1989 by mid-December.
   The Japanese are still working overtime, but not necessarily to
send cars, TV sets or VCRs to Main St., U.S.A., or elsewhere abroad
but to satisfy their own appetites.
   ``I'm thinking of buying a new car since two of my children
graduated from school this year,'' said a middle-age man looking
over Nissans in a showroom. ``I am now living comfortably. Now I am
going to enjoy life with my wife.''
   Akihiro Nagayama, a junior at Meiji University, said he already
has a car, a stereo and a video and now was shopping for a leather
coat. He said he wasn't as conscious of brand-name products as the
older generation.
   ``I buy what I need. I have a part-time job and get some money
from my parents when I go shopping. I'm satisfied with the way
things are.''
   ``Japan is entering a long-term cycle of consumer spending like
the United States in the 1950s and 1960s,'' says Kenneth Courtis,
economist at DB Capital Markets in Tokyo.
   Economists think the present domestic-based expansion may well
outlast the export boom. In the quarter ended in September, Japan's
gross national product grew at an annualized 12.2 percent _ the
fastest of any quarter since 1973, based primarily on strong
spending on investment in plants by Japanese companies.
   The problem is, says Courtis, that ``the world hasn't
crystallized what's happening here.'' Just as the world woke up in
the 1970s to discover Japan had an automobile industry, ``in the
1990s we'll wake up and say, `Look at these companies.'''
   In 1985 exports made up 16.5 percent of Japan's GNP, the measure
of a country's production of goods and services; today they are
less than 10 percent of GNP. This ratio is lower than any major
industrial country except the United States, according to Bank of
Japan figures. Relatively sluggish export growth has actually
slowed down the Japanese economy for the past three years.
   Still, competition with Japanese exports remains a formidable
problem for countries like the United States, which suffers a
$50-billion trade deficit with Japan. But the Japanese challenge
comes from an export sector that is only one small part of Japan's
total economy.
   Japan is the most profitable market in the world, according to
more than half of the American and European companies polled by
consultants Booz, Allen and Hamilton.
   American products finding profitable niches in Japan include
Levi jeans and other apparel items; bourbon, beer, California wine,
soft drinks, instant film, razor blades, ``muscle cars'' and Jeeps,
fast food and processed foods.
   Japan is investing three times more per capita than the United
States in factories, research and development, says Courtis. Most
of that is aimed not at increasing export capacity but at reducing
labor costs and developing new technologies and products.
   Based on this investment and the restructuring of the economy
away from exports, Japan will probably be a more powerful _ and
resilient _ economic force than ever in the next century, believe
many economists.
   Ironically, the present boom was spurred by an event that some
doomsayers said would cripple the economy _ the rise of the yen
starting in 1985, pushed by governments trying to reduce Japan's
worldwide trade surplus. Exports were indeed hurt as the exchange
rate made them more expensive and less competitive. But the economy
came out stronger than ever.
   Like the discipline imposed by the oil shocks of the 1970s, the
pain of the high yen was in the end a tonic for Japan.
   ``Manufacturers started switching markets from foreign to
domestic and found (Japan) was a very profitable market,'' says
Tsutomu Tanaka, an economist at the government's Economic Planning
Agency.
   In 1987 real GNP grew a healthy 5.2 percent, in 1988 5.1 percent
and the overall level for 1989 is expected to be about 5 percent.
   ``The change is rather dramatic,'' says Tanaka. ``We used to
depend on exports for growth.''
   Anyone who visited Japan in 1985 and returns today can see the
changes wrought by the high yen.
   In 1985 a foreign car was a rare sight; most people worked on
Saturdays; people constantly complained that Japan was a ``poor
island country with no natural resources that must export to
survive.''
   Today shoppers cruise the Tokyo boutique scene in Maseratis and
Mercedes Benzes. Surfboard-laden RVs head for the beaches on
two-day weekends. Tiffany's displays jewels in the windows of a
Ginza department store that now is part owner of the luxury
retailer.
   Tokyo stores today make the typical American mall look
out-of-date.
   Every week seems to spawn a new health drink, a smaller portable
video player, wilder fashions, a new ethnic restaurant.
   Japanese need what-to-buy magazines with names like Trendy and
Goods Press just to keep up.
   Domino's Pizza scooters buzz pepperoni-and-mushroom specials to
Japanese couch potatoes playing with electronic gadgets not yet
available in the United States.
   Neighborhoods where ``rabbit hutch'' houses huddled five years
ago are sprouting solidly built condominiums. The only rub is that
prices are too high for most young families, who console themselves
with new cars and appliances and overseas vacations.
   A recruiting pamphlet for giant Nippon Steel does not feature
factories, but spiffily dressed young men enjoying life in the
flashy Roppongi nightlife district. Nowadays steel manufacturers
are building resorts and importing wine; they're also selling so
much steel to the booming domestic construction market that there
isn't enough left over to meet export demand.

   Love's labor has not been lost for Jabra
Ibrahim Jabra, one of the giants of contemporary Arab letters who
has translated Shakespeare's plays and sonnets into Arabic. Critics
say they are the best translations of The Bard yet in Arabic.
   It took him 24 years, from 1959 to 1983, to translate
``Hamlet,'' ``Coriolanus,'' ``King Lear,'' ``Macbeth,''
``Othello,'' ``The Tempest'' and 40 of the sonnets.
   Now he says that's it.
   ``I wanted to translate all his plays,'' Jabra said in an
interview at his home in a fashionable Baghdad suburb. ``But after
finishing `The Tempest' I realized it was virtually impossible. I'd
never have the time to do anything else.''
   He said ``The Tempest,'' which he completed in 1979, was the
toughest to translate because ``it was deceptively lyrical, which
makes it very difficult to render in another language.''
   ``His translations of Shakespeare and other Western works are
very, very beautiful,'' said Professor Abbas al-Tonsi of the
American University in Cairo.
   Eisa Abu-Shamsieh, an Arab academic, noted in a literary thesis
on Jabra that his Shakespeare translations ``as well as scholarly
studies on Shakespeare's works stand as a remarkable contribution
to the modern Arabic drama in particular, and literature in
general. His accuracy in translation is a characteristic upon which
his critics agree.''
   Jabra, 69, is one of the most prolific and versatile Arab
writers; he is a novelist, poet, essayist, critic and translator as
well as artist.
   He has translated Oscar Wilde, Emile Zola, Guy de Maupassant,
Chekov, Andre Maurois, Walt Whitman, Dylan Thomas, Ezra Pound,
Edith Sitwell and William Faulkner along with many English poets
such as Shelley, Keats, Dryden and Byron.
   ``It took me a year to do `Hamlet,' the first Shakespeare play I
translated,'' Jabra said.
   ``It was an agony and a pleasure,'' he added, sitting in his
study lined with books in Arabic, English and French as well as
paintings and sculptures by himself and other Iraqi artists.
   ``It was something I'd always wanted to do. I'd had this
ambition since I was a young man,'' he explained.
   ``Ever since I first read `Julius Ceasar' in Jerusalem when I
was a boy I'd always wondered if it was possible to make
Shakespeare's characters talk in Arabic without losing the force of
his words in English.''
   When he studied at Cambridge University in England, he found
that Arabic translations of Shakespeare were ``verbally awkward,
strangely static.''
   So he decided to do his own and found himself immersed in ``the
almost impossible task'' of sustaining the ``same verbal charge,
the evocative imagery, sustained metaphors, diversity of rhythm and
tone, the eloquence and the word play'' into another language.
   Apart from such works as his novel ``Hunters in a Narrow
Street,'' which was originally written in English and published in
1960, and several collections of poetry, he has written seven major
novels in Arabic, among them ``The Ship,'' ``The Search For Walid
Masoud'' and ``The Other Rooms.''
   Professor Tonsi noted: ``Jabra and another novelist,
Abdel-Rahman Munir, are considered the only two Arab novelists
whose influence could go beyond that of Naguib Mahfouz,'' who won
the 1988 Nobel Prize for Literature.
   Jabra was born in Bethlehem in pre-1948 Palestine, the son of a
Christian farmer who fell on hard times, forcing the family to move
to Jerusalem.
   There, Jabra quit school to work as a carpenter and plumber. But
he continued studying at the Arab College and later went to
Cambridge. In 1952-54, he studied at Harvard.
   He returned to Palestine in 1943 and worked as a teacher in
Jerusalem before being driven into exile, at the age of 29, when
the state of Israel was declared.
   Exile has been one of the central creative forces of his life,
engendering a passion for his Arab heritage and Arab nationalism.
He converted to Islam in Baghdad, where he wound up in 1948.
   He taught English literature at Baghdad's College of Arts and,
he said, ``preached change unashamedly.''
   He said he told his students: ``We lost Palestine because we had
confronted a ruthless force with an outmoded tradition.
   ``We had been cheated and betrayed by thousands of years of
decay. We've been victims of our insane rhetoric.''
   Jabra noted as he puffed on his ever-present pipe: ``Change has
to begin with a change of vision, with a new way of looking at
things.''
   Jabra's understanding of the West and European literature has
combined with a burning belief, shared by many Arab intellectuals,
that the Arab world has to change in all facets of life to survive
and preserve its rich heritage.
   The heroes of his novels are generally Arab intellectuals
standing alone, facing up to the unknown and dreaming of change.
   Like other Arab writers who have long fought decline and
darkness, Jabra believes he has a special obligation to the young
Arab generation, and that as a writer he can do that only through
vision and awareness.
   To that end, he now writes exclusively in Arabic.
   ``I write not only to renew my own energy, but above all to
renew the energy within the new Arab generation,'' he said.

<HEAD>What's in a Name? For Some Rock Bands, a Lawsuit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JESSICA BALDWIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For some of the rock groups of the 1960s and '70s,
the comeback trail includes a gig in the courtroom to try and
reclaim their household names.
   Lineups have changed, founding members have retired, died or
gone solo, and in some cases, the reunion has entailed lawyers
poring over dusty old files to establish who owns the name of the
group.
   Members of the British group Yes, which won popularity in the
'70s, have just fought through tortuous litigation to win a
Solomonic ruling on use of the name. Another British group, Pink
Floyd, suffered similar tribulations.
   The American rock-pop group the Byrds had to reunite temporarily
for three concerts in California last January just to lay renewed
legal claim to their name, because three different groups, all
fragments of the original, were calling themselves the Byrds.
   ``A lot of acts are getting back together again and touring, so
the name is absolutely crucial,'' said Patrick Isherwood, a music
industry lawyer at Frere Cholmeley, the London-based law firm that
represents the Beatles. ``In a sense that's your passport to make
money or not.''
   ``The names count for a lot. That's why Pink FLoyd had their
battle with Roger Waters,'' said Brian Howard, a lawyer at
Russells, a London law firm that represents Waters. ``At the end of
the day if you've got a good name you sell albums before people
have even listened to them.''
   Pink Floyd illustrates the power of the name.
   Forbes magazine estimates that the group's reunion tour and
album, ``Momentary Loss of Reason,'' pulled in $56 million and put
Pink Floyd among the 10 biggest entertainment earners of 1989.
   Meanwhile, the latest album by Waters, who founded Pink Floyd in
1967 but went solo five years ago, sold fewer than 1 million copies.
   Had Waters kept the name Pink Floyd and used different artists,
he might have been much more successful, says Chris Gilbert, a
London-based music industry manager, because, ``You could argue
that Waters was the creative spearhead of that band from day one.''
   Waters sought a court order to dissolve the band, calling it ``a
spent creative force.'' He lost, but the giant pig that has been
one of the group's best-known stage props is still in litigation.
   Nostalgia buffs provide a large market for oldies, and
middle-aged classic rock bands are taking advantage of the
nostalgia wave.
   The Rolling Stones are touring North America, selling out four
Shea Stadium shows in six hours. The Kinks are on the road, as are
Crosby, Stills and Nash. Jefferson Airplane and the Stray Cats are
reuniting, while The Who has just completed a successful tour.
   In Yes's case, a U.S. District court ruled in July that four
former members of the rock band led by singer Jon Anderson cannot
use the name. The judge awarded ownership to bass player Chris
Squire, who said he paid a hefty sum for it. The four musicians are
touring under their own names but billboards advertise ``an evening
of Yes music.''
   A band's name is particularly important when it comes to
merchandising.
   `It's the ultimate brand name,'' Gilbert said in an interview.
``It's as valuable as Kit Kat, or Gordon's gin. When you think of
the sums of money going into those brand names and then multiply
them by the creative care and measure that's gone into a group's
name you can see why someone is upset not to be able to use that
name.''
   Entertainment industry lawyer Alexis Grower said the name
battles began with Fleetwood Mac in the late 1960s, when their
manager, who had registered ``Fleetwood Mac'' under his name,
attempted to retain it after the band had replaced him.
   ``Fleetwood Mac got the name even though the ex-manager went out
and hired four other people,'' Grower said. ``The court established
the precedent that it doesn't matter who has the ownership of the
name. What matters is who the public thinks the name is.''
   The image of bands that once stood for the counterculture now
surrounding themselves with high-priced lawyers may not sit well
with hard-core fans. But some rockers may wish they had been with
lawyers from the beginning.

<HEAD>New Plays Taking Center-Stage in London</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New plays are about to take center-stage in London
as the theater capital moves away from the star-filled revivals and
classic productions that have dominated recent seasons.
   Alan Ayckbourn, Michael Frayn and Simon Gray are just three of
the well-known English dramatists who will open new plays on
London's commercial West End in the first six months of 1990.
   Howard Barker and David Hare, two well-known leftist
playwrights, will premiere three plays between them in London's
government-subsidized theaters.
   Barker kicks off the activity with two plays starting
performances Jan. 4: ``Seven Lears,'' at the Royal Court, which
takes its title from Shakespeare's ``King Lear''; and ``Scenes From
an Execution,'' at the Almeida.
   The latter brings two-time Academy Award-winner Glenda Jackson
back to the London stage following her performance this fall in a
Los Angeles stage revival of Edward Albee's ``Who's Afraid of
Virginia Woolf?''
   The new play casts her as a painter in Renaissance Venice.
   Feb. 8 sees the bow at the Royal National Theater of ``Racing
Demon,'' David Hare's play about four south London clergymen. The
show marks Hare's first play since his 1988 ``The Secret Rapture,''
which had a long run at the National but flopped quickly this fall
on Broadway.
   Alan Ayckbourn's ``Man of the Moment,'' the prolific author's
36th play, opens Feb. 14, with Michael Gambon (TV's ``The Singing
Detective'') heading the cast.
   ``It's my play with a swimming pool,'' Ayckbourn, 50, said in an
interview, referring to the setting for one of the scenes. The
play's theme, he added, was ``what the media selects from people.''
   ``I'm always amazed that it picks out the people it likes, and
the people who might be nicer it leaves alone,'' he said. ``Some of
the nicest people on TV are the nastiest people in real life.''
   ``Look Look,'' Michael Frayn's first completely new play since
his 1984 ``Benefactors,'' opens April 17 at the Aldwych. The
dramatist has been busy lately translating and adapting the plays
of Anton Chekhov and writing for television. Frayn, who had
Broadway successes with both ``Benefactors'' and ``Noises Off,''
was reluctant to discuss his new play's plot.
   ``Silence is what one had better preserve at this point,'' he
said. The play stars Stephen Fry and Serena Gordon, and is directed
by Mike Ockrent (``Me and My Girl'').
   Simon Gray, who wrote ``Butley'' and ``The Common Pursuit,'' is
expected to have a new play on the West End by the summer, and John
Osborne and Christopher Hampton are two other noted playwrights
readying new works.
   The flurry of new writing contrasts with 1988 and 1989, when the
primary theatrical excitement came from seeing stars do the
classics _ Vanessa Redgrave in ``Orpheus Descending'' and Dustin
Hoffman in ``The Merchant of Venice,'' to name two London
productions that traveled to Broadway.
   This past year's most revelatory staging was Trevor Nunn's
tightly focused revival of William Shakespeare's ``Othello'' for
the Royal Shakespeare Company. The production paired Tony-winning
actor Ian McKellen and opera singer Willard White as Iago and the
jealous Moor.
   Unlike recent years, there are few new musicals to whet
theatergoers' appetites. By far the most eagerly awaited are the
British debuts of two shows by Stephen Sondheim: ``Sunday in the
Park With George,'' opening March 15 at the Royal National; and
``Into the Woods,'' which bows next fall on the West End.

<HEAD>Bush's Chin Proves He's a Macho Guy, Face `Reader' Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   While President Bush talks about ``a
kinder, gentler nation,'' Laura Rosetree says everything about his
face _ from his straight eyelids to his narrow nose and thin-lipped
smile _ suggests that Bush isn't very keen on kindness.
   And about those lips. Bush says ``read my lips'' about not
raising taxes, but what are his lips really saying?
   ``What they suggest is that Bush controls his speech very
carefully,'' says Ms. Rosetree, a self-proclaimed expert in
analyzing faces to learn what they reveal about personality.
   ``He doesn't say whatever he's really feeling or thinking,'' she
said. ``If you literally read his lips, they are proclaiming, `I'm
not ever going to get sentimental on you. I'm not going to be a
bleeding heart.'''
   Ms. Rosetree, 41, is a former self-development teacher who
became interested in ``reading'' faces in New York in 1976, when
she met an elderly Chinese practitioner of an ancient method known
as siang mien.
   After a decade of research, she says, she developed her own
psychic roadmap of the human face, which she describes in a
285-page book titled ``I Can Read Your Face.''
   She claims that every facial feature from eyebrows to chin
dimples can betray how people think, behave and handle life's
challenges. While most psychologists would scoff at such a claim,
Ms. Rosetree says she's been hired by several businesses to train
salespeople and real estate agents how to read the faces of
prospective customers.
   Sitting in her sunny apartment in this Washington suburb, Ms.
Rosetree studied a close-up photo of Bush and a videotape of a Nov.
7 news conference for clues to his personality.
   Her conclusion: Bush is a hard-nosed pragmatist and skeptic, a
die-hard ideologue, a shrewd negotiator and skilled conciliator, an
intellectual who revels in the realm of ideas, a decision-maker who
respects facts, disdains feelings and isn't afraid of criticism.
   ``He's not a people person, he's more of an idea person,'' Ms.
Rosetree says. Even the small inner circle of Bush's ear suggests
that he ``listens for facts and objective information rather than
feelings, emotions or spiritual aspects,'' she says.
   ``Kindness is not a major trait of George Bush's, judging by his
face,'' Ms. Rosetree said. ``He has other strengths, but kindness
is not one of those. There are at least 10 facial traits that
indicate kindness, and Bush doesn't have a single one.''
   When Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev met at the waterlogged Malta
summit, she said, they may have differed on some East-West issues
but ``they have noses in common'' _ long and straight, with tips
pointing down.
   Ms. Rosetree said that means Bush and the Soviet leader both
tackle problems logically, they're good at long-term strategy and
they have a strong sense of self-interest. But she says they are
strikingly different in the shape of their eyelids.
   Bush's lower eyelids are straight, meaning he's naturally wary
of new people, while Gorbachev's are curved, meaning he probably is
``the open-hearted one of the two,'' Ms. Rosetree says.
   To set the record straight, she says, Bush is a macho man _ it's
right there in the semicircular knob on his prominent, square-jawed
chin.
   ``That semicircle relates to being very proud of his
masculinity, the macho aspect, forcefulness, and being very
sensitive to appearing weak in front of other people,'' she said.
   ``The wimp image in the presidential campaign must have bothered
him excruciatingly,'' she added.
   ``His straight chin shows that he makes his major life decisions
based on principles and ideology, not on compassion or other
people's feelings. This is not the chin of a Santa Claus, it's the
chin of a crusader.''
   Further, she says, the way Bush's ears lie flat against his head
indicates he is a strong conformist, a stickler for ``correct''
behavior and intolerant of kooks. And his deep-set eyes, she says,
suggest he'd make an expert poker player.
   ``His strong suit isn't hearts, it's clubs,'' Ms. Rosetree said.

Bazilian in explaining the genesis of the band's third LP, ``Zig

   ``But it seemed to be, when the smoke cleared, the political

Rob Hyman.
   As political novices, the Hooters turned to some veterans for
assistance: Peter, Paul and Mary, who contributed vocals to an
updated version of the folk classic ``500 Miles.''
   Bazilian and Hyman wrote new verses to insert in Hedy West's

Tiananmen Square, particularly the shot of a lone student halting a

   For the first time since Turkey invaded
in 1974, openings are appearing in the line that divides Greek and
Turkish Cypriots. Some see it as the first sign of a breakthrough
toward reunification.
   Withlittle fanfare, ordinary Greek and Turkish Cypriots have
been in touch with each other to seek an end to 15 years of
political and religious division on this east Mediterranean island.
   ``Contact between the two communities has been increasing,''
noted columnist Petros Andreou in the Cyprus Mail, an
English-language newspaper published in the Greek Cypriot sector.
   ``At last, the two sides are beginning to understand each
other's position.''
   Events in Eastern Europe may have inspired the grassroots trend.
Since the Berlin Wall began to crumble in November several groups
from the rival communities have come together for the first time
since the Turkish army in 1974 seized the northern third of the
island in the wake of a short-lived coup by those seeking union
with Greece.
   The Moslem Turkish Cypriot minority declared the
Turkish-occupied north a republic in 1983, but it is recognized
only by Turkey.
   Cyprus still has a long way to go before the barriers come down
as they have in Europe. But columnist Andreou said that the
570,000-member Christian Greek Cypriot community's growing
awareness of social and economic problems is finally taking the
edge off their obsession with the island's divisions.
   ``People are beginning to realize that there's more to life than
the `national question','' Andreou wrote.
   ``Perhaps the same realization is crystallizing in the north. If
it is, then it's quite probable that people will eventually begin
to shed all their nationalistic fixations and instead start to deal
with what is really important _ how they can live in peace on this
island.''
   Since the invasion, Rauf Denktash, president of the northern
statelet, has banned Turkish Cypriots from visiting the Greek
sector and refused to allow Greek Cypriots to visit the north. The
Greek Cypriots have imposed no travel restrictions.
   But Denktash recently allowed the door to open a crack:
   _World War II veterans from the two communities who fought side
by side against the Germans held an emotional reunion in the
no-man's land of the United Nations-patrolled buffer zone in
December. Old comrades-in-arms embraced, complaining about their
separation and voicing hopes of a settlement.
   _Alpay Durduran, a member of the Turkish Cypriot Parliament and
leader of the newly formed opposition New Cyprus Party, attended a
public discussion in the Greek sector of Nicosia, the island's
divided capital, on whether the two sides could live together again
in harmony. He described his visit as ``a unique and historic
event.''
   _A month earlier, Denktash allowed Greek Cypriot journalists to
visit the Turkish sector for the first time since the invasion and
permitted Turkish Cypriot doctors to attend a buffer zone meeting
with Greek physicians.
   United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar noted
in December: ``The recent relaxation in the crossing procedures by
the Turkish Cypriot side and the growing number of contacts between
groups of the two sides are positive developments which should be
built on.''
   Until now, most of the drive for reunification has come from the
Greek Cypriots, 200,000 of whom were forced to flee the Turkish
north. They left homes, businesses and roots put down many
generations ago.
   The Turkish Cypriots, outnumbered 5-1, believe that having their
own enclave affords protection from the sectarian violence that
plagued the island for years before 1974, when some 40,000 Turks
fled north from the predominntly Greek south.
   U.N.-sponsored talks between Denktash and President George
Vassiliou, the Greek Cypriot leader, on reunifying Cyprus in a
bizonal federation have deadlocked.
   The Greek Cypriots are reluctant to meet Denktash's demands for
political parity or make concessions they believe would be
tantamount to recognizing a state they and the United Nations brand
illegal.
   Denktash rejects U.N. resolutions calling for the withdrawal
from the north of an estimated 30,000 Turkish army troops and
35,000 to 50,000 Turkish settlers and the return of Greek Cypriots
who fled in 1974.
   Denktash argues that this would create security problems for his
community and trigger fresh intercommunal clashes.
   But an emerging opposition bloc in the north believes
reunification, with the proper guarantees for both sides, is the
right road.
   Durduran, the Turkish Cypriot member of Parliament, acknowledged
that both sides still fear and mistrust each other.
   ``Both communities have committed atrocities against each
other,'' he said. ``But if we want to live in a federated state
democratically, respecting human rights, we must avoid the mistakes
of the past.
   ``Today's challenge is: Can we honestly care about each other?
Can we escape from the past? Our mistakes will teach us how to
proceed to build a common future together.''
   A predominantly Greek Cypriot gathering loudly applauded his
words.
   The Greek Cypriot newspaper Phileleftheros said: ``It takes
courage and vision for a Turkish Cypriot politician to come to the
Greek Cypriot side and address a Greek Cypriot audience, ignoring
the overt and covert threats and intimidation of the chauvinists of
his side.''
   Denktash maintains that Turkish Cypriots oppose reunification.
But Durduran rejected that.
   ``The leadership in the north has tried to tie our tongues and
forbid us from using the word reunification,'' he said.
   ``When we talk in a language that annoys our leaders we get
bombs at our doors.''
   Two small bombs have exploded outside Duduran's home in
Nicosia's Turkish sector, causing slight damage, in recent weeks.
   Reunification is also supported by Mustafa Akinci, mayor of
Nicosia's Turkish sector, who for years has been quietly working
with his Greek Cypriot opposite number, Lellos Demetriades, to
build sectarian bridges.
   Akinci has said he will run against Denktash in presidential
elections in the north this coming spring. He's taking on
Denktash's powerful party machine, and an Akinci victory is seen as
very likely to spur reunification.

   From classroom news video to waiting-room TV,
hardcover book inserts to Spanish magazines, Whittle Communications
keeps inventing ways for advertisers to reach the audiences they
want.
   The gutsy media company has angered Madison Avenue critics who
say its new ad vehicles aren't road-tested and may not work. But
Whittle has forced rivals to at least think about similar
strategies and concoct a few of their own.
   Whittle executives say the competition is one reason they are
scrambling to devise other offbeat ways to reach consumers through
the power of advertising. They say their approaches are the best.
   ``We have minor competition in virtually every area of our
business,'' said Whittle founder and chairman, Christopher Whittle.
   But he said no competitor had yet matched all 40-odd areas in
which Whittle offers advertisers a focused approach to reach
specific customers, from high-school sophomores to blue-chip CEOs.
   Whittle, a Knoxville, Tenn.-based concern 50 percent owned by
multimedia giant Time Warner Inc., has ambitious expansion plans
that easily could double the $180 million in revenue expected for
the year ended next June 30.
   In November, Whittle debuted the first in a series of short
hardcover books with ads interspersed among the pages, like those
in conventional magazines.
   That concept has stirred considerable skepticism among big book
publishers, who historically have limited ads in hardcover books to
short plugs for an author's other works on the inside jackets.
Whittle said its books, written by such well-known authors as David
Halberstam and John Kenneth Galbraith, will be sent free to people
whom the company considers American opinion leaders.
   Whittle perhaps is best known for its Channel One daily news
program for the classroom, scheduled to debut in March. The company
is signing up schools nationwide for the program, which has aroused
heated debate among educators because it is sponsored by
advertisers, like ordinary television shows.
   Schools get free video equipment for subscribing to Channel One,
but in return they subject captive audiences of students to ads for
products ranging from jeans to dandruff shampoo.
   The uproar over Channel One evidently was enough to convince
another pioneering media entrepreneur, Ted Turner, to launch a
rival news show for high schoolers in August. Turner's program
contains no ads but subscribers must use their own video gear.
   Unfazed by the Channel One controversy, Whittle is evaluating
whether to make televised programming available in another
captive-audience situation, doctors' waiting rooms. Some physicians
already subscribe to Whittle's Special Reports quarterly magazines
for patients to browse.
   The company plans a Spanish-language magazine distributed
through medical offices and beauty salons in Hispanic
neighborhoods. Whittle also will produce brief programs for
Spanish-language TV.
   Additional projects are under study _ a magazine for women in
beauty salons and a magazine for senior citizens, for example.
   Whittle's aggressive approach has raised questions about whether
the company is moving too fast into too many untested areas. But
the company's founder said it was designed to concoct ways to
communicate a message to a tightly defined group.
   ``For virtually everything we are doing now, we started planning
three years ago,'' said Whittle, a doctor's son and
multimillionaire who started the company as a college graduate in
1971.
   While some projects have died in the laboratory, Whittle said,
``I can't remember putting a property into the marketplace that
doesn't work.''
   One reason so many projects can be launched simultaneously, he
said, is that the company is divided into five parts, each headed
by a partner responsible only for its performance.
   Ed Winter, for instance, runs the Channel One school project,
while Peter Finn heads the division with the book and
Spanish-language projects and Alan Greenberg is in charge of
publishing Special Reports magazine and evaluating a pilot project
the company is calling Waiting Room TV.
   While they operate separately, one division's work often helps
the others.
   Whittle said the staff of 70 trained to sell the Channel One
system in schools probably will be pressed into service next year
to help sell Waiting Room TV to physicians if the company proceeds
with that project. The same goes for the Channel One network of
equipment installers.
   ``We realized that to develop all of that infrastructure and
then to dismantle it didn't make any sense,'' Whittle said.
   He usually goes directly to top management of companies such as
Kraft General Foods and Federal Express Co. with his proposals,
bypassing ad agencies. He argues that his magazines and TV programs
give advertisers the opportunity to precisely target the people
they want as buyers, without having to compete for airtime or page
space purchased by other advertisers.
   Whittle's approach has aroused some hostility among traditional
Madison Avenue ad agencies. Some ad executives also have expressed
skepticism about Whittle's claimed results.
   ``None of his media projects are proven yet,'' said Richard
Kostyra, director of media services at J. Walter Thompson Co., one
of the largest and best-known ad companies.
   Kostyra said Whittle's own audience research results for Special
Reports waiting-room magazines, for example, are inconclusive. This
has complicated the agency's efforts to advise clients on where to
place their ads.
   Other agency executives, speaking privately, said they suspected
Whittle's Waiting Room TV project might be an effort to boost ad
renewals for Special Reports, now in their second year.
   Whittle called such talk ``competitive chatter'' from rivals and
ad agents who feel threatened.
   He said his company had to create its own audience research
system because Whittle products are different. ``The measurement
system for newsstand magazines can't measure what we do,'' he said.
   Special Reports overseer Greenberg said he expects current
sponsors will buy two-thirds of the advertising space in the
magazines and new advertisers will buy the rest.
   Several Special Reports advertisers declined comment on their
plans. But Kraft General Foods spokesman Mike Caruso said that
company doesn't dispute Whittle's research.
   Greenberg denied that Waiting Room TV was promoted now to
invigorate renewals in Special Reports. Nonetheless, advertisers in
the magazines get the first opportunity to advertise on the TV
program.
   Whittle said the company was promoting the Waiting Room TV
project because it knew waiting rooms were a powerful media
environment. ``We knew we had better get into that business or
someone else will,'' he said.
   He was right. Another company, headed by former advertising and
programming executive Frederick Doner, is testing the Good Health
Channel, a program on health topics with commercials, to debut in
doctor's waiting rooms by April.

<HEAD>Other Voices Remind Yeutter of Needed Actions in 1990</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The big-ticket item in 1990 for Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter is the Uruguay Round of trade talks in
Geneva, followed by a new farm bill in Congress.
   OK, but what about other closer-to-home consumer issues such as
nutrition labeling or fish inspection? Or a sensible approach to
rural development?
   Those topics so far have been relatively muted in the
Agriculture Department's agenda, overshadowed in the Yeutter camp
by the drumbeat of global trade and farm bill strategy.
   In a recent year-end assessment, Yeutter characterized 1989 as
``one of the best ever'' years for the American farmer.
   The Yeutter list of top priority issues faced by USDA in 1989 _
his first year as secretary _ included world agricultural trade,
food safety, the environment, research and ``serving rural
America'' in general.
   ``We have worked hard this year to lay the groundwork for
enactment of the 1990 farm bill and for successful conclusion of
the Uruguay Round,'' Yeutter said. ``We now need a strong, vigorous
push if we are to open up market opportunities for the future.''
   The Geneva talks, held under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, are due to conclude in a year. If successful, they will
be a big step toward reducing and eliminating distortions in global
agricultural trade.
   Eileen Kugler of the Washington-based consumer group, Public
Voice for Food and Health Policy, was asked in a telephone
interview what kind of recommendations she had for Yeutter in the
new year.
   The federal meat and poultry inspection system in USDA should be
strengthened, she said. And microbiological criteria should be set
for meat and poultry products to help cut down on contamination by
salmonella and other harmful organisms.
   In the National School Lunch Program, Kugler said, the USDA
should ``take the leadership in reducing fat and set maximum
permitted levels of fat'' in meals served to children.
   Another item on her wish list for 1990 is better labeling on
food products to show nutrition information ``in a clear,
informative manner.''
   Kugler said she would like to see USDA take the lead in
promoting safer food supplies, to assert itself in such a way that
when Congress approves legislation for fish inspection the
department can show itself to be ``more than capable of
implementing a strong fish inspection program.''
   Overall, she said Yeutter's first year has included both pluses
and minuses.
   ``We think that in some cases he's headed in the right
direction, and his heart's in the right place,'' Kugler said.
``We've given the Bush administration a honeymoon, so to speak, and
now we'd like to see some real action.''
   Most general farm organizations and commodity groups see at
least some good things coming out of the GATT talks that occupy so
much of Yeutter's dream for a futuristic agriculture.
   No one really quarrels with gaining better foreign access for
U.S. commodities. Few would argue against the objective of getting
the 12-nation European Economic Community to open its doors wider
to U.S. goods, for example.
   There are many differences, however, on how great would be the
benefits _ or losses _ to American farmers from a global ``free
market'' arrangement, and whether the Geneva negotiations are a
major step toward the abandonment of U.S. price support programs.
   Bob Frederick, legislative director for the National Grange,
said he wishes that the EEC ``instead of talking like a world
trading leader would start acting like one'' by opening markets and
reducing its trade-distorting subsidies.
   Another item on Frederick's 1990 wish list would be that ``all
U.S. farm organizations and commodity groups stop speaking in
tongues that sound like a Babel of voices'' when it comes to
agricultural policies.
   Frederick said he also wishes that Yeutter ``would place more
emphasis on keeping agriculture a part of rural development and not
let Congress solve rural problems'' by imposing urban solutions.
   Asked to elaborate, Frederick said the Grange for some time has
been critical of rural economic remedies that would involve
factories and electric generating facilities to create a
``small-town Detroit'' environment.
   By doing that, he said, a community's base would be shifted from
agricultural to industrial or business in character.
   Many communities got in trouble when they were all based on
agriculture, and Frederick said it could be as disastrous to shift
entirely away from agriculture to one particular kind of industry.
   ``Rural development has never been high on USDA's list during
any administration,'' Frederick said. ``There have been stabs at
it. ... Hopefully, we can get it organized.''
   Frederick said he fears that important aspects of agriculture
may get lost in the shuffle as farm and rural development
legislation now in Congress is implemented.
   ``There's very little mention, if any, of the maintenance of
agriculture as the nucleus for rural communities,'' he said. ``Not
every rural community has the resources or the infrastructures to
take on economic development. So, they're going to have to build on
what that have _ and that's agriculture.''

<HEAD>Hostages the Decade's Great Unresolved Dilemma</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   On the eve of a New Year and a new decade, an
agonizing image haunts the emblems of hope, for the 1980s are
ending as they began, with Americans held hostage.
   And the scrapbook of the '80s could hardly be complete without a
collection of out-of-focus instant photographs of long-held
hostages in Lebanese captivity, sent out from time to time by men
waging what they deem to be holy war.
   For most of the decade there have been American hostages in the
Middle East. The names and faces have changed, but not the torment.
   Ten years ago there were 52, in Tehran, and the hostage impasse
was a crisis that helped undo a president, ending only as another
came to office.
   Now there are eight, in Beirut, and the air of crisis has long
since yielded to a grim, seldom spoken concession that for all its
might, there seems to be nothing the United States can do to force
the safe release of its people.
   The standing government statement is a demand that
hostage-takers and their sponsors free all the captives, and that
the United States is pursuing every possible avenue to that end.
   But there are no known avenues.
   President Bush calls the situation one of enormous frustration.
``It's on my mind an awful lot,'' he said in a review of his first
year in office.
   The U.S. hostages are among 18 Westerners kidnapped and believed
held in Lebanon. Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of
The Associated Press, has been held longer than any other hostage _
nearly five years now. He was seized in Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   They are held by militant Shiite Moslems aligned with Iran, with
different factions claiming to control groups of hostages. Anderson
and Thomas Sutherland are held by a group calling itself Islamic
Jihad, or holy war. It has made one demand from the beginning,
offering to free them in exchange for 15 Shiite Moslems jailed in
Kuwait for terrorist bombings.
   The administration stands firm on the no-deals policy declared
by Ronald Reagan, who secretly breached it with the Iran
arms-for-hostages dealings disclosed in 1986.
   The new Iranian government said at one point last fall that it
would seek to help gain the hostages' release if the United States
would free assets frozen during the Tehran hostage crisis. Assets
disputes are in the hands of an international tribunal in The
Hague, which has been releasing funds it determines to belong to
Iran. The administration insists there is no link, although after
one decision releasing assets to Iran, Bush said he hoped it might
help the situation.
   It hasn't so far. Nor have administration suggestions of
improved relations that could benefit Iran should the hostages be
released.
   One American hostage, Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, was killed,
and his captors issued a photograph of his hanging body last summer
after Israel kidnapped a Shiite leader in southern Lebanon. While
Bush denounced the brutality, there was no retaliation. He was said
to have been preparing reprisals in the event death threats against
a second hostage were carried out.
   But the plight of the other American hostages limits U.S.
options.
   A week after he took office, Reagan had said he wouldn't stand
for hostage episodes. ``Our policy will be one of swift and
effective retribution,'' he said in welcoming the Tehran embassy
hostages seized on Nov. 4, 1979, and held until his inauguration
day, Jan. 20, 1981.
   It was a warning on which he could not deliver when his own
hostage problems began three years later with the kidnappings in
Lebanon.
   Lacking options or answers, Bush has uttered no such warnings,
and has played down the hostage situation he inherited.
   The number is small, the victims are isolated and unseen. It is
an unrelenting problem, but not a crisis forcing its way onto the
national agenda.
   Nevertheless, the haunting figures of Americans held hostage
stand as symbols of the 1980s, and as unfinished business in the
new year.

<HEAD>`Leap Second' Puts Earth Clocks in Sync with Heavens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poised on the brink of a new decade the world
will pause tonight for just a second.
   A ``leap second'' will occur at the very end of Dec. 31, 1989,
making it the longest day of the year.
   The extra second is needed to keep the world's clocks in time
with the rotation of the planet, according to government
timekeeping officials.
   The turning of the Earth has always been the time standard for
humans, who marked the passage of days by the hours of light and
darkness and years by the seasons as the planet moved around the
sun.
   But while early timekeeping sought to measure the planet's
movement, today's clocks might be called more accurate than the
Earth itself.
   ``Time measured by the rotation of the Earth is not uniform when
compared to time kept by atomic clocks,'' reports the U.S. Naval
Observatory, the government agency in charge of keeping track of
what time it is.
   As a result of this difference, atomic clocks can get out of
sync with the Earth and have to be adjusted. Since it's the atomic
clocks that are used to set all other clocks, a leap second has to
be added or skipped from time to time to make up the difference.
   Fifteen leap seconds have been added to human time since an
international time agreement was signed in 1972, when a full 10
seconds had to be added to the atomic clocks to get them together
with the Earth. This will be the first leap second in two years.
   The leap second will occur officially at 23 hours, 59 minutes
and 60 seconds, Coordinated Universal Time, when a one-second pause
will occur before the arrival of zero hours on New Years Day.
   Coordinated Universal Time, popularly known as Greenwich Mean
Time, is the time experienced in London, England, and serves as a
standard reference for the world's timekeepers.
   In the United States, the actual adjustment will be made one
second before 7 p.m. EST.
   Atomic clocks are extremely accurate because they measure time
based on the frequency of regular events in atoms of cesium,
hydrogen, rubidium or mercury.
   The National Institute of Standards and Technology, formerly
called the National Bureau of Standards, is the government agency
in charge of timekeeping.
   Over the years the rotation of the Earth has tended to slow down
somewhat, and thus all 15 leap seconds needed so far have had to be
added to atomic clocks. If the Earth were to speed up, leap seconds
would have to be subtracted.

<HEAD>Discovery Of `Editing' Of Genetic Messages Offers Hope Against Diseases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have made the startling discovery
that some chemical messages sent by genes are changed before they
arrive at their destinations, a finding that challenges a central
tenet of genetics.
   ``It's an absolutely astounding concept,'' said Olke Uhlenbeck
of the University of Colorado in Boulder, a biochemist familiar
with the research. ``Nobody has the foggiest idea how it works.''
   The phenomenon is called ``RNA editing.'' One of its
discoverers, Larry Simpson of the University of California, Los
Angeles, said the discovery could lead to new treatments for
African sleeping sickness, a similar South American ailment called
Chagas' disease, and leishmaniasis, a disfiguring skin disease.
   Those diseases are all caused by the group of parasites called
trypanosomes. The first evidence for RNA editing was found in
trypanosomes by Rob Benne of the University of Amsterdam, who
reported the discovery in 1986.
   RNA editing has since been found in a slightly different form in
a slime mold called physarum, in measles virus, and in the human
gene for the protein called apolipoprotein B, associated with heart
disease.
   Most recently, independent teams in France and Canada reported
in Nature magazine in October that they had discovered RNA editing
in wheat plants.
   Researchers do not yet know how widespread RNA editing is or why
it evolved, but it appears to be a normal part of the functioning
of some genes. In trypanosomes, for example, researchers found that
certain genes were missing crucial elements. Yet the elements were
present in the genetic messenger chemicals associated with those
genes.
   ``RNA editing'' is the name that researchers gave to the process
by which the missing elements were restored.
   Although the initial discovery was made in 1986, the existence
of the phenomenon has not been widely accepted until now, says
another discoverer, Kenneth Stuart of the Seattle Institute for
Biomedical Research.
   ``It was initially met with extreme skepticism,'' said Stuart,
who has occasionally collaborated with Simpson. When Stuart
presented some findings to biologists last year, they were ``met
with disbelief,'' he said.
   Now, he said, other research groups have confirmed the findings
and more clear-cut examples of RNA editing have been found. ``We
now have three examples in which more than 50 percent of the gene
has been edited,'' Stuart said.
   ``It's been found by too many people in too many places now,''
said Uhlenbeck, who studies interactions between RNA and proteins.
``The reason I like it is that RNA has consistently been putting
out surprises for the last couple of years, and this seems to be
the next one.''
   Earlier work on RNA splicing, a different process in which RNA
is altered in accord with genetic instructions, earned a Nobel
Prize last year for Thomas Cech of the University of Colorado in
Boulder and Sidney Altman of Yale University in New Haven, Conn.
   RNA editing differs in an important way from RNA splicing and
other forms of RNA processing that were known previously, Stuart
said. RNA editing is the only process that appears to require the
addition of information not provided by the genes.
   ``It means that the genetic system has more capability than we
had previously recognized,'' he said. ``People who think about
things like this would not have predicted that such a complex
mechanism for changing information even existed.''
   The reason for the initial skepticism was that RNA editing
seemed to violate what biologists call the central dogma of
genetics, which holds that genetic information contained in the
genes passes from the genes, by way of a messenger chemical, to
proteins.
   The genes, made of DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, direct the
manufacture of messenger RNA, made of ribonucleic acid. The
messenger RNA travels from the cell nucleus to protein factories
called ribosomes, where the RNA directs the manufacture of the
myriad proteins the cell needs to survive and reproduce.
   In RNA editing, changes are made in the RNA after it is produced
by the genes but before it arrives at the ribosomes.
   ``Imagine a book that has less than half its pages,'' Stuart
said, ``and somehow, upon reading it, all the missing pages get
magically put back in. Or you type it into your computer and all
the vowels are missing, and when you send it to the printer all the
vowels somehow get put back in.''
   The discovery of RNA editing poses a difficult question. Where
are the missing pages _ or the missing vowels _ coming from? Where
does the cell get the information to restore or delete parts of the
messenger RNA?
   If the information is not coming from the genes, the central
dogma of genetics has been violated.
   ``What I hypothesize is that the genetic information actually
resides in the genes in encrypted form _ in an abbreviated or
compact form,'' said Stuart. If that is the case, then the central
dogma would not be violated; the editing information would be
coming from the genes.
   Simpson, who calls the edited genes ``cryptogenes,'' also
believes that the information added by the editing is somehow
hidden in the genetic code.
   The discovery of RNA editing in trypanosomes could lead to the
development of a drug that would kill them without harming human
cells, Simpson said.
   ``These are very important human and animal parasites,'' he
said. If RNA editing is found to be widespread in human cells, it
is likely to occur in a different form; drugs that attack
trypanosomes by interfering with RNA editing might, therefore, have
no ill effects in humans.
   ``We could kill the parasite and not harm the host,'' he said.
``Any time you find something that's unique to a parasite, it's
incredibly significant.''
   Simpson said there are similarities in the RNA editing in the
trypanosomes and in physarum, the slime mold. In both organisms,
the RNA editing occurs in the cells' energy-producing structures,
called mitochondria.
   ``What gets me excited is if the trypanosome type and the
physarum type are the same, which we don't know yet, then that
implies there was a common ancestor that had RNA editing in its
mitochondria.''
   If RNA editing was present in the ancient ancestor of
trypanosomes and physarum, then it must have developed early in
evolution and could have by now spread to many other organisms,
Simpson said.

<HEAD>CFCs Mysteriously Being Absorbed into Earth, Oceans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM McCALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons are
being absorbed by the soil and oceans, according to scientists who
say they still don't know where exactly the chemicals are going or
what the process means.
   Researchers Aslam Khalil and Reinhold Rasmussen were studying
Australian termite mounds to see how they dumped the gas methane
into the atmosphere when their measurements indicated that the soil
was absorbing CFCs.
   ``And it's not confined to Australian termite mounds. We looked
at areas of Brazil and found it. We also found it in Chinese rice
fields,'' said Khalil, a physicist at the Oregon Graduate Institute
of Science and Technology.
   The process may have only a minor effect on the atmosphere, but
to Khalil it suggests that CFCs' interaction with the environment
is more complex than has been thought. ``I don't think, on a global
scale, this will be significant, but compare the greenhouse gases.
They have only a minute effect by themselves. What's important is
their additive effect.''
   Two other atmospheric scientists, F. Sherwood Roland of the
University of California, Irvine, and Mario Molina of Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, agree the mechanism of chlorofluorocarbon
absorption by the soil may be worth studying, but that the effect
on the atmosphere is minimal.
   ``It's not a process that's materially shortening the
chlorofluorocarbon lifetime in the atmosphere,'' Roland said.
``It's not a major sink.''
   The ocean appears to be merely storing the CFCs, the scientists
said. ``CFCs are permanently lost in atmospheric processes but in
the ocean that's not so, it's just dissolving,'' said Khalil.
   The oceans' capacity is huge, so it's possible ``they will build
up over a very long time scale, on the order of thousands of
years,'' Roland said. ``But only about 1 percent of all CFCs are in
the ocean now, which again doesn't change the overall calculation
very much.''
   A much more serious concern is the amount of chlorofluorocarbons
stored in polyurethane insulation, vehicle air conditioning units
and home refrigerators, the scientists say.
   ``The ban on CFCs in aerosol sprays merely put them into
polyurethane insulating foam, just being stored for future
release,'' Khalil said. ``That's more alarming than soil uptake,
which at best is good, at worst is nothing.''
   Chlorofluorocarbons were widely used in aerosol propellants
until evidence mounted they were contributing to the depletion of
the Earth's protective ozone layer, which shields the planet from
harmful ultraviolet radiation.
   In May, representatives of 81 nations met in Helsinki and called
for the elimination of CFC use by the year 2000. Their declaration
seeks to toughen the provisions of a 1987 ozone-protection treaty
called the Montreal Protocol.
   ``About 85 percent of the CFCs manufactured already have been
released into the atmosphere,'' Roland said. ``For aerosol
propellants it's about a six-month lag time. For automobile air
conditioners, it's about two to three years. For home refrigerators
it may be 20 years.
   ``What that means is that we'll reach the maximum concentration
of CFCs in the atmosphere about five to 10 years after
manufacturing stops.''
   Khalil said, ``In a way, it's not bad that CFCs are tied up
somewhere, so their release is slow and won't bother anybody. It's
better than going into the air in large quantities.''
   Greenhouse gases that could contribute to global warming, such
as methane, are a far more serious threat, he, Roland and Molina
said.
   ``You can ban CFC production in the narrow, highly
industrialized band of cities in the Northern Hemisphere,'' Khalil
said, ``but you can't ban methane or carbon dioxide. You can't tell
bacteria to stop making it.''

<HEAD>Peanut Butter Again? Should A Parent Worry?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peanut butter sandwiches and apple juice day
after day _ after day. Dinner table negotiations over exactly how
many peas a child will eat, how many forkfuls of spinach. What's a
parent to do?
   ``Finicky is pretty normal for lots of kids,'' said Vicki
Lansky, author of ``Feed Me! I'm Yours.'' And common sense will
indicate whether a child has gone beyond fussy to worrisome.
Parents should not be short-order cooks or spend every dinner
pleading, ``Eat your broccoli,'' Lansky said.
   Easier said than done, right?
   Dinner needn't be a battleground if parents make non-negotiable
rules, which most children will follow, said Dr. William Dietz of
Boston's New England Medical Center, citing the wide use of cod
liver oil a generation or so ago.
   ``Talk about a terrible food. But the message and the culture
was that cod liver oil was good for kids. So millions of kids
obediently opened their mouths and swallowed that stuff, and it was
awful,'' he said.
   ``It's more the dynamic than the child's eating, per se,'' said
Ellyn Satter, author of ``How to Get Your Kid to Eat ... But Not
Too Much.'' ``I recommend a division of responsibilities in
feeding, which says essentially that the parent is responsible for
what is offered and when and where. ... It's up to the child to
decide what to eat, and whether to eat.''
   Parents have to judge whether a finicky child truly doesn't like
what's on the table, is trying to get attention, or has some other
motive.
   ``A lot of times kids are trying to push their parents to see
how far they can go,'' said Martha Stone, a nutritionist at
Colorado State University. ``Saying yes and no to food is one way
of exerting control.''
   It's also natural for children to play with food.
   Toddlers are ``exploring, trying to develop a sense of what does
or doesn't taste good, learning how to feed themselves. All those
add up to finicky,'' said Dr. Ronald Kleinman of Massachusetts
General Hospital.
   Telling a child who refuses to eat that there's no more food
until the next meal is OK. ``That throws the situation back to the
child, a choice of eating, or being hungry,'' Stone said. Parents
must be consistent about such rules, Dietz said. ``You have to be
wiling to let them go hungry.''
   Parents also should respect strong food dislikes and not give
rewards for eating. If a child rejects a food once, serve it again,
as many as 10 times. Sometimes children need to grow accustomed to
new tastes. And try to wait out food jags, which begin around 18
months and can occur throughout childhood.
   What counts is a balanced diet _ protein, fruits and vegetables,
dairy and grains _ even if only one or two things are eaten from
each group.
   ``They don't have to have variety in their lives at that age,
they have to have the nutrients to grow,'' Kleinman said. With his
own children, now 12 and 14, Kleinman and his wife only made food
an issue if meals were skipped. ``We kind of insist that at least
two times a day we see them eating a meal.''
   It's important to get a pediatrician's opinion on whether a
child's weight is appropriate for height, several experts noted.
But despite reports of well-off parents underfeeding youngsters to
keep them thin, children are more likely to face problems today
from too much food. They should not be forced to clean their plates
and usually are the best judges of how much to eat, Stone said.
   ``Keep in mind that the grownup way of eating is not necessarily
a pattern to be admired or emulated,'' Satter said. ``Grownups have
pretty systematically learned to ignore their internal cues.''
   The best way to prevent obesity, she said, is to nurture
children's ``exquisite senstivity to their own hunger.''

   A strikebound coal company sued the

its nearby Glen Daniel mine because of what it called union
violence stemming from the UMW's selective strikes.
   The UMW has been on strike against New Beckley since January,
idling 130 miners. The union also is engaged in a bitter strike
against the Pittston Coal Group Inc. in West Virginia, Virginia and
Kentucky.

   Negotiators for striking coal miners and the
Pittston Co. resumed talks and were expected to bargain around the
clock to settle the 9-month-long walkout by New Year's Day.
   The two sides returned Wednesday after a Christmas break from
negotiations that officials said came close to agreement last week.
   ``A great deal of progress was made,'' said Herb Fishgold,
spokesman for mediator W.J. Usery.

   Two major television networks, CBS and ABC, have
decided not to run commercials featuring President Bush and Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev unless they get permission from the two
heads of state.
   Schering-Plough Corp. is using pictures of Bush and Gorbachev to
help promote its own weapon against the cold war, Drixoral cold
medicine. The company is using footage of the two leaders from
their recent summit talks in Malta in a television and newspaper
advertising campaign for Drixoral starting today.

   For many people, trips to crowded shopping malls, airports or
restaurants this holiday season weren't complete without a stop at
an automated teller machine.
   One of the world's largest ATM networks, Plus System Inc. of
Denver, predicts that between Dec. 1 and New Year's Day consumers
will have used the high-tech bank machines twice as much as last
year, largely for withdrawals.
   That's good news for many financial institutions who charge
anywhere from 10 cents to $3 per transaction for such ATM services
as cash withdrawals, deposits, transfers or balance inquiries.

   The Energy Department soon will end its
decades-old practice of paying all bills, including environmental
fines and other penalties, incurred by the companies that run
nuclear weapons plants, officials said.
   The government will continue paying normal operating expenses,
but for the first time since nuclear arms production began in the
1940s, costs resulting from negligence by the plant operators will
be borne by the companies instead of taxpayers, Energy Department

   World economic growth will continue next year _
but barely, a business research group reported.
   The Conference Board's international economic scoreboard,
released Wednesday, shows the composite leading index for 11 major
industrial countries inching up at an annual rate of 1 percent,
down from 4 percent six months ago and 5 percent a year ago. The
leading index is designed to foretell economic activity.
   ``Throughout the industrial world, the outlook for economic
expansion is not very exciting,'' said Edgar R. Fiedler, vice
president and economic counselor for the group.
   ``Although neither a recession nor an inflationary boom is
impossible in the months ahead, neither seems probable,'' Fiedler
said.
   One of the few countries with any vigor is Taiwan. Its leading
economic index is rising at an 8 percent yearly pace, the same as
three months ago and up slightly from the 7 percent pace posted six
months ago.
   But Taiwan's economy apparently has cooled from a year ago when
its leading index was rising at a 15 percent rate.
   Here are the annual rates of change in the latest leading
indexes for the other 10 countries included in the Conference
Board's international economic scoreboard, compared with the rates
released a year ago:
   United States, 1 percent vs. 3 percent
   Canada, 3 percent vs. 1 percent
   West Germany, 5 percent vs. 4 percent
   France, 0 vs. 9 percent
   United Kingdom, -1 percent vs. 2 percent
   Italy, 0 vs. 2 percent
   Japan, 1 percent vs. 8 percent
   Australia, -2 percent vs. 3 percent
   South Korea, 2 percent vs. 9 percent
   New Zealand, 4 percent vs. -1 percent.

<HEAD>U.S. Textile Imports, Profits Both Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. textile imports rose by 13 percent and
their value climbed to more than $32 billion in 1989, the American
Textile Manufacturers Institute said.
   Imports of cloth and clothes increased to 12.19 billion square
meters this year from 10.74 billion square meters in 1988, the
institute said Wednesday. The U.S. market, though, increased by
only 4 percent, the industry group said.
   Imports were valued at $32.36 billion, compared with $29.63
billion last year. The biggest increases came from China and Taiwan
and smaller increases from Canada and Thailand, institute
spokeswoman Deborah Anderson said.
   U.S. imports are held down by a series of agreements between
industrial countries and Third World exporters. Textiles are a
major industrial export of Third World countries, since large
quantities can be produced with labor that requires little training.
   U.S. exports rose to $5.952 billion from $5.226 billion last
year. After-tax profits of the U.S. textile industry rose to an
estimated $1.7 billion from $1.6 billion in 1988.
   ``This year brought still larger numbers of textile and apparel
imports into this country, which had a direct negative impact on
employment in the domestic industry,'' said institute president
Edward P. Schrum said in a statement.
   The institute reported 727,090 jobs in the U.S. industry this
year, compared with 729,000 in 1988. Average weekly earnings rose
to $313.85 from $302.96, it said.

   The Commerce Department has ruled that imports
of mechanical transfer presses from Japan were being sold in the
United States at less than fair value.
   Mechanical presses are automatic metal-forming machine tools,
machines that are used to make other machines.
   With the ruling Wednesday by the Commerce Department, the U.S.
International Trade Commission now has 45 days to determine whether
the low-cost imports are injuring U.S. manufacturers of the same
products.
   If the commission finds that U.S. companies are being hurt, then
the Commerce Department will issue a final order imposing higher
duties on imports of the mechanical presses from Japan.
   The department proposed anti-dumping duties of 15.16 percent on
Komatsu Limited; 7.49 percent on Aida Engineering Limited and 14.51
percent on all other Japanese companies manufacturing the
mechanical presses.
   The U.S. investigation began last January after a complaint was
filed by the Verson Division of Allied Products Corp. Two unions,
the United Auto Workers and the United Steel Workers, also
petitioned the government for relief.
   Imports of mechanical transfer presses from Japan totaled $109.2
million in 1988.

<HEAD>Two Networks Decline To Run Ads Featuring Bush, Gorbachev</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS and ABC have rejected a commercial for a
cold medicine that features the leaders of the superpowers in a
play on the term ``cold war.''
   The two television networks said Wednesday they would not run
Schering-Plough Corp. commercials for the cold remedy Drixoral
featuring President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
unless the company obtains permission from the two heads of state.
   Schering is using pictures of Bush and Gorbachev at their recent
summit talks in Malta in a television and newspaper advertising
campaign that starts today.
   But CBS and ABC notified the company's ad agency Wednesday that
they would not run the ads without government permission, said Kent
Roman, an account supervisor for the agency, Messner Vetere Berger
Carey Schmetterer. NBC still plans to run the ads and Schering is
considering placing them on cable television channels, he said.
   In the past, the White House has sent stiff cease-and-desist
warnings to companies using the president's picture to make him
appear to endorse a product.
   Schering did not ask Bush's permission before making the ads,
company officials said.
   Presidential aides with Bush in Texas were unavailable for
comment Wednesday, a secretary in the White House press office said.
   Several principals of the ad aency worked on commercials for
Bush's 1988 presidential campaign.
   ``They (Schering) should obtain the consent of the White House''
and Soviet authorities, said Matthew Margo, a vice president for
program practices at CBS. It is ``not appropriate'' to use the
presidency to sell products, he said.
   Margo said, however, that CBS would run the commercials if the
leaders gave their permission.
   ABC officials couldn't be reached for comment late Wednesday on
their refusal to run the ads.
   Tom Feitel, a senior brand manager of Schering, said NBC plans
to air the commercial and newspapers will run the ads.
   ``It is extremely tasteful,'' he said in a telephone interview.
``We feel there's no attempt to make it appear that either of the
individuals involved are exponents for the product.''
   Schering also is shipping boxes of Drixoral to the heads of
state of East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania and
Bulgaria ``to help ease the effects of their treacherous winter,''
the pharmaceutical company said in the news release.
   ``In the new year, may the only cold war in the world be the one
being fought by us,'' say the ads for the antihistamine and nasal
decongestant.
   Schering, which is spending more than $200,000 on the campaign,
claims it is the first time Bush and Gorbachev appear in an ad
promoting a product.
   Among the newspapers scheduled to run the ad is Novoye Russkoye
Slovo, a Russian paper published in the United States.
   Other U.S. companies ranging from Pepsico to American Telephone
&amp; Telegraph Co. have capitalized on the Cold War thaw to promote
themselves in television commercials. But these ads have not shown
any political leaders appearing to endorse a specific product.
   Schering is a leading pharmaceutical and health-products maker
based in Madison, N.J., with sales of nearly $3 billion in 1988.

   Wholesale vegetable prices have tripled in some
cases as Florida farmers scramble to harvest crops that survived a
deadly two-night freeze and plant replacement vegetables.
   ``A lot of people have a built-in resistance to paying over a
dollar a pound for tomatoes or over a dollar a head for lettuce,''
said Pete Packett, spokesman for the state Department of
Agriculture. ``Some people will obviously choose other foods until
the price comes back down.''
   Prices jumped Wednesday at the wholesale level as vegetables
harvested before the freeze Saturday and Sunday night are shipped
from cold storage to stores, primarily in the East and in Midwest.
   ``The pipeline stays filled for three to seven days in advance
of any major prices change in the marketplace,'' said Reggie Brown,
spokesman for the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association in
Orlando. ``You'll start seeing it showing up probably within a
week.''
   Wholesalers are seeing the early effects of the freeze and
passing them along.
   ``Everything has just tripled in price. Green cabbage was doing
about $8.75 (a box) and they're asking over $20 for it now,'' said
Paul Graff, manager of the Len Strom brokerage in Miami. ``Zucchini
is way up in the $25 range, which was between $11 and $12 before,
and so it goes.''
   All of the state's major vegetables, including tomatoes, bell
peppers, sweet corn, lettuce, cucumbers and celery, have been hurt,
Brown said.
   Collier County agricultural agent Steve Dobbs estimated $150
million damage to vegetables in the Immokalee area alone, a prime
growing district southwest of Lake Okeechobee.
   ``In the near term, 40 to 60 days, we're going to see some very
strong prices come out of Florida,'' said Brown. ``Then about 60 to
90 days down the road we'll probably see a large return in the
marketplace of volume, and we'll see those prices fall.''
   But even with the bitter cold taken into consideration, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture is predicting a modest 3 percent to 5
percent rise in consumer food prices for 1990.
   Buyers for Lakeland-based Publix Super Markets Inc., the
nation's eight-largest chain with 370 stores in Florida, have been
told it will be another day or two before the full extent of crop
damage is determined.
   ``It's a devastating blow, but nobody is pressing any panic
buttons because of the alternative sources on standby,'' said
Publix Vice President Bill Schroter, referring to substitute
supplies from California, Mexico and Latin America.
   But the widespread arctic chill also hurt crops elsewhere,
further clouding the supply.
   ``Not only did we get it but Texas got it,'' Packett said.
``We're the kingpins in the market. Now you're going to be looking
all the way across the country to California and Mexico for
imported produce.''
   More than 80 percent of the state's 700,000-acre citrus crop was
still on the trees when the freeze hit, but a large juice reserve
in Florida, a boom year in Brazil and swift processing of iced
oranges were expected to stabilize juice prices.
   The fresh citrus growing region of Indian River County showed
limited damage, Packett said.

   A United Mine Workers spokesman terms
as ridiculous a lawsuit filed by a strikebound coal company
alleging the union's selective strike program is a thinly veiled
racketeering operation.
   The $60 million lawsuit was filed Wednesday in U.S. District
Court in Beckley by New Beckley Mining Corp., which also announced
it is closing its Glen Daniel Mine in Raleigh County because of
alleged union violence, including ``murderous attacks on
employees.''
   ``The decision to shut down and seal New Beckley's Glen Daniel
Mine was reached because the continued organized violence
orchestrated against New Beckley by the UMWA has reached an
intolerable level of acceptibility by any rational standard,'' said
New Beckley President Jay Sasell at a press conference.
   ``Marauding pickets continue to cause great hardship upon the
company and its families on a daily basis. We are disappointed that
the UMWA has chosen this path of destruction of a fine company,
forcing us to take these severe steps to prevent further harm to
our employees,'' Sasell said.
   The UMW has been on strike against New Beckley since January,
idling 130 miners, and also is engaged in a bitter strike against
the Pittston Coal Group Inc. in West Virginia, Virginia and
Kentucky.
   The 53-page lawsuit cites alleged violence at more than 20 coal
companies in West Virginia, Kentucky and Virginia since 1983, when
the union began its selective strike strategy, in which the UMW
targets specific companies for work stoppages. Previous strikes
were industrywide.
   The suit alleges New Beckley employees have been the victims of
vandalism, death threats, shootings and beatings at work and at
home.
   ``Indeed, the violence affects not one company or group of
companies, but rather pervades the coal industry, discouraging
productivity and inhibiting the economic well-being of individuals
living and working in coal-producing communities,'' the suit says.
   ``That's ridiculous,'' said union spokesman John Duray, who
accused the company of engaging in a ``press-release lawsuit'' by
hiring a public relations company to notify the media of the filing.
   ``It looks to me like these guys are a lot more interested in
trying their case in the media than in court,'' Duray said.
   UMW District 29 President Everett Acord said he knew nothing of
the lawsuit or the mine closing, although he said it isn't
unprecedented for a company to close a mine that is being struck.
   The suit, filed under the federal Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act, contends the union has engaged in a
pattern of racketeering that includes 34 counts of attempted
murder, 23 counts of arson and 79 counts of extortion.
   Under the RICO statute, the company's requested $20 million in
damages can be tripled if the union and various individuals are
found to have violated the act.

<HEAD>Baxter Signs $2.5 Billion Supply Pact With HCA Hospital Companies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Baxter Healthcare Corp. is continuing its
medical-supply relationship with the Hospital Corp. of America _
but there's a twist.
   The company that was HCA is now three companies, and Baxter has
signed contracts with them all. The $2.5 billion deal covers more
than 450 hospitals nationwide.
   Under separate contracts that become effective Jan. 1, Baxter
will provide products and services for six years to HCA,
HealthTrust Inc. and HCA Management Co. Together, they own or
manage 452 hospitals nationwide.
   HealthTrust and HCA Management are former HCA units that became
independent companies through a reorganization completed in the
four years since HCA's original contract with Baxter.
   That contract, a five-year pact worth $1.25 billion, was due to
expire at the end of 1990, Baxter spokesman Geoffrey Fenton said.
   The new contracts replace and expand upon the old one, providing
products and services that meet the different needs of the new
companies, Fenton said.
   HCA owns and operates 78 U.S. medical-surgical hospitals and 53
psychiatric facilities.
   HealthTrust, a network of 93 former HCA hospitals, was formed in
1987 through an employee stock ownership plan.
   HCA Management became independent this year when HCA sold the
unit to a holding company formed by a group led by senior managment
and the New York-based investment firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson and
Stowe.
   Fenton said the company manages 228 hospitals.
   Baxter, based in Deerfield, Ill., outside Chicago, manufactures
a wide range of healthcare products including medical and surgical
supplies, intravenous fluids and diagnostic equipment.
   Baxter also offers inventory management and strategic planning
services.
   HCA's initial contract with Baxter was an outgrowth of their
1985 battle for American Hospital Supply Corp. American Hospital
Supply had agreed to merge with HCA but Baxter offered more money
and bought the company for $3.7 billion.
   Baxter paid HCA $150 million to terminate the merger agreement
and HCA agreed to buy $250 million worth of Baxter products
annually for five years.
   ``We've been very satisfied with the products and services we've
received during this term so once we went through the divestiture,
we asked to renegotiate,'' said David McFadden, an HCA spokesman.
   In 1988 Baxter signed its largest supply agreement, a 5{-year
pact worth up to $6.4 billion with American Healthcare Systems, a
group of more than 1,000 healthcare facilities.
   Baxter also has multi-year supply agreements with the Daughters
of Charity National Health System and Massachusetts General
Hospital.
   Baxter Healthcare is the principle U.S. operating company of
Baxter International Inc., the world's leading manufacturer and
marketer of healthcare products and services.
   Baxter International reported 1988 net income of $388 million on
sales of $6.9 billion. Through the first three quarters of 1989,
Baxter had net income of $307 million on sales of $5.4 billion.

<TEXT>
   Detectives at the downtown Nordstrom store who
chased a shoplifter now find their employer embroiled in a personal
injury lawsuit.
   Two men who were run over by the shoplifter claim the detectives
were negligent and have filed suit against the national retail
chain.
   Nordstrom lawyers say the store sympathizes with Alexander
Passovoy, 63, of Lake Oswego, Ore., and William Pack, 64, of
Britain, but feels their legal recourse should be aimed at the
shoplifter.
   Pack suffered cracked ribs and Passovoy said he will need
surgery to repair torn leg ligaments caused by the Sept. 20, 1985
incident. Passovoy said he fell to the bottom of some stairs with
his leg twisted under him.
   ``There was a sort of heavy pounding behind us and we were
knocked sideways,'' said Pack.
   Pack and Passovoy, longtime friends, contend the store and its
lawyers have been anything but sensitive about the case, scheduled
for trial June 25.
   Three years ago, King County Superior Court Judge Susan Agid
threw out their suit. She said Nordstrom could not be held
accountable for the actions of a fleeing criminal.
   Last year, the state Court of Appeals reinstated the suit,
saying a jury should decide whether the detectives' failure to
shout a warning for customers in the store amounted to negligence.
   To concede responsibility would be to restrict store workers
from doing their jobs, Nordstrom lawyers have said.
   ``Nordstrom is not taking care of a prison,'' Michael Reilly,
Nordstrom lawyer, told The Seattle Times. ``They're not prison
wardens. They're merchants. Merchants shouldn't be required to walk
around with balls and chains,'' he added.
   He said the Nordstrom store detectives exercised reasonable care
in the crowded store and ``did exactly what they should have done.''
   The shoplifter who was the object of the chase was eventually
grabbed near the downtown Monorail by a couple of Bon Marche
department store security officers who heard shouts from Nordstrom
store detective David Siler.
   Siler gave chase after he saw two men stuffing suits into bags.
One shoplifter was tackled in the store. The other was pursued
through the store and onto the sidewalks of downtown Seattle.
   ``I'm not looking for the moon here,'' said Passovoy. ``We just
want some equity. But they claim they weren't responsible.''
   Nordstrom and the National Retail Merchants Association were
upset by the appeals court ruling. The association represents 4,500
retailers nationally.
   ``No appellate court in the United States has ever gone so far
as to impose a duty to warn customers of the possible dangers
caused by a fleeing shoplifter,'' the association said.

<HEAD>Duff &amp; Phelps Downgrades Sears Securities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Uncertaintity about the prospects for Sears,
Roebuck and Co.'s new retailing strategy has led Duff &amp; Phelps Inc.
to lower its rating on Sears' fixed-income securities, the credit
rating agency said.
   Duff &amp; Phelps said in announcing the downgrade on Wednesday that
the move reflected the ``increased risks and earnings volatility''
of Sears' retail operations after the nation's largest retailer
switched last spring to a strategy of ``everyday low pricing.''
   The strategy, designed to win back market share from discount
retailers, involves offering more name-brand goods, lower prices
and fewer sales than in the past.
   Some retail analysts believe the strategy is failing, but Sears
says it is committed to the strategy and is still in the process of
converting its stores to the format.
   Sears' advertising of ``everyday low prices'' was attacked last
week by the attorney general of New York, who claimed in a lawsuit
that the prices at Sears stores are actually as high or higher than
before the strategy shift.
   Sears has denied the charge, which it contends is based on
comparisons of only 14 of the more than 100,000 items it sells.
   Duff &amp; Phelps downgraded Sears' senior debt, acceptance senior
debt and Discover Card credit senior debt Wednesday to AA-minus
from AA.
   At the same time, however, Duff &amp; Phelps reaffirmed the
commercial paper rating of all three entities at Duff 1-plus.
   The downgrading affects about $2 billion of debt securities.

<HEAD>Conair Buys Cuisinarts Product Line</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conair Corp. officials say they have
gained a major asset in purchasing Cuisinarts Inc.'s product lines
for an undisclosed price.
   The transaction, announced Wednesday, also included the purchase
of trademarks, patents, inventory and equipment of the world-famous
food processor maker, Conair announced.
   The purchase came five months after Stamford-based Cuisinarts
Inc. filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. bankruptcy code. The case remains pending in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Hartford.
   At the time of the bankruptcy filing in August, Cuisinarts
stated that it owed $43.2 million and had assets of $34.5 million,
most of it in inventory in a Norwich warehouse.
   Cuisinarts officials have blamed the company's financial
troubles on a failure to capitalize on its famous name by using it
on other products. Only recently had it begun to branch out to such
things as cooking utensils, hand blenders and other cookware.
   Rachel Litner, a Conair spokeswoman, said Conair did not assume
Cuisinarts' liabilities.
   With the purchase, Stamford-based Conair will have five product
divisions. These include the kitchen line involving Cuisinarts
products; consumer appliances, consumer toiletries, consumer
electronics and professional beauty salon products.
   Conair officials said the company would also be expanding its
international market with its participation in a 50 percent
ownership in a Cuisinarts-Japanese joint venture to market the new
Cuisinart line.
   Cuisinarts product lines include food processors, stainless
steel cookware, accessories, and other kitchen appliancess such as
hand mixers.
   Leo Rizzuto, chairman and president of Conair, said Cuisinarts
will prove to be a ``major asset'' to Conair.
   Rizzuto said Conair hopes to double Cuisinarts sales within two
years by expanding the business.
   ``We will expand the business by applying the same manufacturing
and marketing expertise to Cuisinarts as we have to our other
businesses,'' Rizzuto said in a statement. ``We intend to spend
significant dollars to advertise and promote exclusive, top-quality
features of the Cuisinarts brand.''
   Rizzuto said Conair will broaden the Cuisinarts line with
professional quality products in other kitchen categories in the
future.
   The first Cuisinarts products available through Conair will
reach store sheleves in February, the company said.
   Cuisinarts was founded 18 years ago by Carl Sontheimer, a
retired inventor who holds dozens of patents, and his wife,
Shirley, both of Greenwich. Sontheimer sold the company in 1988 to
a group of investors.

<HEAD>Dallas Entrepreneur Wants To Buy Braniff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Dallas entrepreneur who tried last year
to found an airline for smokers now wants to purchase Braniff Inc.,
a newspaper reported.
   Kay Cohlmia was to meet with representatives of the troubled
carrier today, he told the Orlando Sentinel in a telephone
interview. He said he has arranged financing but would not give
details.
   Orlando-based Braniff filed Sept. 28 for bankruptcy protection
and has been short of cash since.
   Lawyers for the carrier's unsecured creditors said they have not
been approached by Cohlmia.
   ``We're interested to hear what his offer is,'' said attorney
Richard Levy, who represents the unsecured creditors' committee.
Levy said his office does not have an appointment to meet with
Cohlmia.
   In October, Braniff hired Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, an
investment banking company, to find sources of financing, including
possible buyers.
   Cohlmia, 54, said he worked for Braniff as a baggage handler in
the 1960s.
   ``I love that airline,'' he said. ``It could be the best _ and
will be _ if we buy it.''
   Describing himself as a ``hustler and an idea man,'' Cohlmia
said he would turn Braniff into a service-oriented airline catering
to business fliers.
   For 20 years, he operated Cohlmia Aviation Inc., which at its
peak used a fleet of more than 60 planes to ferry checks among
banks, he said. It ceased operating in December 1987.
   In 1988, Cohlmia helped found the Great American Smokers Club,
an organization based in Texas that wanted to form an airline for
smokers only. In 1986, he ran the Las Vegas, Nev., air hub for the
U.S. Postal Service, which flew mail to the city from locations in
13 states.
   ``I thought he was a good operator,'' said Joseph A. Ryan, the
Las Vegas postmaster. Cohlmia kept the contract for about 18
months, eventually losing it to a lower bidder, Ryan said.
   Cohlmia said he does not have the money to buy Braniff on his
own but has lined up financing. He and his lawyer will meet with
the airline's creditors Friday, he said, adding that they may not
like his proposal.
   ``The problems we have are with the creditors,'' he said.
``Funny thing, everybody is looking after their own self on this
thing. I'm interested in the airline going back into business. I
think people have to be put back to work.''
   Braniff returned five new jets last week because it could not
make $3 million in lease payments. The company would not comment on
the possibility of a buyout.

<HEAD>Lord Drogheda Dead, Developed London's Financial Times</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lord Drogheda, who helped create the modern
Financial Times, Britain's business daily, died on Dec. 24 at age
79.
   An obituary in the newspaper on Thursday said: ``He combined a
vision of excellence with a relentless attention to detail and a
refusal to be satisfied with anything less than the highest
standards.''
   Drogheda and his editor Sir Gordon Newton built the Financial
Times in the 1950s from a newspaper of small circulation for
London's City financial district into a daily journal read
throughout the world. The newspaper is renowned for the accuracy,
impartiality and scope of its worldwide business and political
coverage and it also has a closely read arts section.
   The Financial Times was founded in 1888 and now sells around
300,000 copies daily, including an international edition printed in
Frankfurt, New York and Paris.
   Drogheda, who was Charles Garrett Ponsonby Moore before he
inherited the 300-year-old earldom in 1957, came from Anglo-Irish
stock and sold advertising space on the Financial Times in the
1930s. He became managing director in the 1940s, chairman in 1971
and retired in 1975.
   Drogheda, pronounced Droyeda, had been chairman of the Royal
Opera House, Covent Garden, and a director of the Royal Ballet.
   His wife, concert pianist Joan Carr, died eight days before him.
They had one son.

<HEAD>United To Match Midway Fare Cuts; Northeast Shuttles Hike Fares</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: edits grafs 6-8 to ADD Trump confirmation, comment; uppicks
8th graf pvs: United's fare ...</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Winter travelers around the country may start the new year with
lower air fares, as several airlines announce cuts in the cost of
flying for the first months of 1990.
   But the two principal air shuttle services in the Northeast,
which cater mostly to business passengers, are raising their fares
for the first time since August 1988.
   Chicago-based United Airlines, the nation's second-largest
carrier, followed the lead of cross-town rival Midway Airlines and
said Wednesday it would lower some fares as much as 30 percent.
   ``We have matched them in most markets,'' United spokesman Joe
Hopkins said.
   Northwest Airlines and Trans World Airlines followed suit late
Wednesday, announcing they were matching the fare cuts. It wasn't
immediately clear whether other major carriers also planned to join
the move.
   Separately Wednesday, Trump Shuttle told travel agents it was
raising fares from $99 one way to $119 on weekdays and from $69 to
$79 on weekends, agents said. Pan Am Corp. spokeswoman Pamela
Hanlon said that company's shuttle service, which competes with
Trump's, was matching the increase, effective Jan. 3.
   The hourly shuttle flights link New York with Boston and
Washington. Billionaire developer Donald Trump bought his service
from Eastern Airlines for $365 million in early June.
   Trump spokeswoman Joan Fudala today cited increased costs for
fuel, labor and aircraft maintenance as the reason for the increase.
   United's fare reductions are effective immediately and require a
14-day advance purchase and a Saturday night stay, said Rob
Doughty, another spokesman for the airline.
   The new United fares are based on mileage. Round-trip fares for
flights of up to 1,000 miles are $198 for peak times and $178 for
off-peak times. Peak times are Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays;
off-peak fares apply other days.
   For flights from 1,001 to 2,000 miles, fares will be $258 peak
and $238 off-peak, the airline said in a statement. Flights of more
than 2,000 miles will cost $318 peak and $278 off-peak.
   United's action spread the fare-cutting that began last week
when Southwest Airlines reduced prices on its longer routes, a move
other carriers followed on a limited basis.
   Midway, which operates its main hub at Chicago's Midway Airport,
had announced one-way fares ranging from $19 to $99 across its
50-city route system within the continental United States.
   ``The entire industry is seeing soft bookings (for) the first
quarter,'' said Midway spokeswoman Laura Podlesny, explaining the
fare cuts.
   Passengers wanting to take advantage of United's lower fares
must make reservations by Jan. 31 and may travel through March 6.
The fares are available only on a round-trip basis and are not
refundable.
   Midway cut its Chicago-Los Angeles round-trip fare from $318 to
$198, and its Chicago-Washington round-trip fare from $228 to $158.
   Midway's new $38 round-trip fares _ $19 one way _ apply to
routes connnecting Chicago with Detroit and Kansas City, Mo. The
fares previously were $43.
   Midway waived minimum-stay requirements that usually apply to
discount tickets, but said the reduced-rate tickets must be
purchased by Jan. 20 and travel completed by March 31.

<HEAD>Canadians Drawn By Low Prices, Strong Dollar Flood U.S. Stores</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Canadian shoppers have made this
holiday season jolly for U.S. retailers, but some residents are
feeling a lack of goodwill toward fellow shoppers from across the
border.
   Low U.S. prices and a comparatively strong Canadian dollar have
caused Canadians to throng grocery stores, liquor marts and factory
outlets throughout this border city.
   ``The prices _ check it out,'' said Manny Hilario, 23, who drove
100 miles from Brampton, Ontario, to shop at the Factory Outlet
Mall one recent Saturday. Outside, in an overflowing parking lot,
Ontario plates outnumbered New York plates more than three to one.
   The crowded lots, long checkout lines and delays entering Canada
on the area's three international bridges have caused tempers to
rise at times.
   A group of six Niagara Falls residents announced recently they
were forming a group called ``People Against Canadian Shoppers'' to
press local merchants to deal with the problems.
   ``We have nothing against them (Canadians) personally, but we do
think something could be done to improve the situation for
everyone,'' Steve Hughes, a spokesman for the group, told The
Niagara Gazette.
   Hughes said his group is circulating petitions blaming Canadians
for everything from litter and rudeness to unsafely transporting
gasoline across the border in extra tanks.
   That effort, in turn, has prompted U.S. business and tourism
officials to hasten to assure Canadians that they are still welcome.
   ``It's easy to blow this out of proportion and make out that
there's a major war going on,'' said Ray Wigle, spokesman for the
Niagara Falls Convention and Visitors Bureau.
   The convention and visitors bureau and the Niagara Falls Area
Chamber of Commerce have urged businesses to clean up the trash and
expand checkouts. Local governments have been asked to increase
traffic control in order to reduce the complaints.
   Local Canada Customs officials have asked the agency that
operates the international bridges to expand the customs facilities
and are trying to persuade Ottawa to allocate more staff.
   Same-day shopping traffic across the Rainbow and Whirlpool
bridges has increased by almost 60 percent over the past four
years, and at the Lewiston-Queenston bridge, the main route to
major Canadian cities such as Hamilton and Toronto, traffic is up
107 percent over that period, said John Johnston, district manager
for Canada Customs operations in Niagara Falls.
   Theories abound over why the number of shoppers has multiplied,
though the year-old U.S.-Canada free trade pact isn't considered a
direct cause. The agreement has reduced wholesale tariffs on
several categories of merchandise but has not yet affected the
duties paid by individual shoppers at the border.
   Still, free trade may have subtly boosted cross-border shopping
by helping to strengthen the Canadian dollar. The Canadian dollar
trades at about 85 U.S. cents these days after falling as low as 70
cents earlier in the decade.
   Niagara Falls, N.Y., also has a built-in price advantage because
western New York is one of the cheaper regions of the United States
while Niagara Falls, Ontario, is an extension of the pricey Toronto
metropolitan area, said Wigle.
   Price is not the only attraction of the United States, some
Canadian shoppers said.
   ``In groceries, anything new they come out with (in the U.S.) is
in Canada the year after,'' said Lisa Morrice of Hamilton, Ontario.
   ``You just don't have the choices (in Canada),'' agreed a
Toronto woman who declined to give her name. ``You see different
things down here.''
   U.S. grocery chains began advertising heavily across the border
in the past few months after seeing the stronger dollar and the
increased willingness of Canadians to cross the bridges.
   ``Their money is worth a lot more than it was two years ago,''
said Ralph Meranto, manager of a local Tops supermarket. ``It
wasn't even worthwhile before.''
   Canadian merchants say they can't compete with U.S. prices, but
are not calling for stronger government action to protect them.
   Turkeys that cost 69 cents a pound in the United States sell for
the equivalent of $1.28 to $1.49 a pound in Canada, said Justin
Sauve, manager of Hy and Zel's Supermarket in Niagara Falls,
Ontario.
   ``A lot of people I know buy a case of beer for 10 bucks (in the
U.S.) and over here it's $22 or $23,'' Sauve said. ``People go over
there to gas up and they go to the stores while they're there.''
   Canada, unlike the United States, has no duty-free allowance for
shoppers who have been out of the country less than 24 hours. Sauve
said a lot of Canadians are escaping the duty and federal sales
tax, which can add up to 19.8 percent to the cost of a purchase,
but declined to fault customs officials for letting them through.
   ``If you take everybody who you could pull over, you'd be
pulling everybody over,'' he said. ``You'd be there all day pulling
them over.''
   Johnston, the customs manager, said his agency's penetration
rate was ``reasonable'' given the need to keep traffic flowing.
   ``When we have to take enforcement action, it tends to slow
things down,'' he said.

   A company owned by leveraged buyout
specialists Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts &amp; Co. filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection after bondholders rejected a restructuring
plan.
   Hillsborough Holdings Corp.'s Wednesday filing in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Tampa marks the first Kohlberg Kravis private
holding to seek bankruptcy protection. The action will be closely
watched for its impact on the ``junk bond'' market.
   Junk bonds, used to finance corporate takeovers, have been
battered in recent months because of problems facing numerous
heavily indebted companies.
   New York-based Kohlberg Kravis formed Hillsborough last year as
part of its $2.4 billion takeover of Jim Walter Corp., a building
materials company. Jim Walter, which is not involved in the
bankruptcy filing, was later sold by Kohlberg Kravis.
   Hillsborough is expected to file bankruptcy petitions for its 31
subsidiaries, said bankruptcy court clerk Chuck Kilcoyne. By 8 p.m.
Wednesday, Kilcoyne had received Hillsborough's petition and those
of nine subsidiaries.
   Hillsborough's bankruptcy petition did not list creditors, and
reported assets of $304.2 million and liabilities of $347.6
million, he said.
   Hillsborough's case has been assigned to the court's Chief Judge
Alexander P. Paskay, said Kilcoyne.
   Kilcoyne said he had not yet received word from Paskay if a
court date had been set.
   Earlier this month, Hillsborough officials said they would file
for bankruptcy if an exchange offer for $624 million worth of the
company's bonds was not accepted by at least 80 percent of the
company's bondholders.
   Hillsborough said it could not repay its bonds in full.
   Hillsborough is the third company owned by Kohlberg Kravis to
encounter financial difficulties in recent months.
   In August, Kohlberg Kravis confirmed that Seaman Furniture Co.,
a leading furniture retailer, could not meet its debt payments and
might not be able to continue operating. The company's debt
payments were later rescheduled successfully.
   SCI Television Inc., of which Kohlberg Kravis owns 45 percent,
is also involved in a bond exchange offer that is facing resistance
from bondholders.
   But neither of those Kohlberg Kravis holdings is as large as
Hillsborough.

<HEAD>Heating Oil Prices Soar Past $1 a Gallon; Other Fuels Also In Demand</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Consumers are paying more than $1 a gallon for
home heating oil in many parts of the country as cold weather
continues to deplete supplies and drive prices higher.
   But oil users aren't the only ones in a bind. Prices are rising
for other fuels and some utilities are asking natural gas customers
to limit consumption.
   In Philadelphia, a gallon of heating oil at one distributor went
from $1.35 Wednesday morning to $1.40 in the afternoon. In
Westchester County, N.Y., just north of New York City, the average
price of home heating oil was $1.35 a gallon, up 27 percent in just
a month.
   The cold weather has kept demand, and in turn, prices, running
high. Transportation problems and refinery shutdowns have
complicated the situation.
   ``The increases are incredible and they're coming just about
every day, from a penny to a nickel per gallon,'' said W. Claiborne
Coupland Jr., marketing director for Papco Oil Co., a supplier in
southeastern Virginia.
   Oil prices are high even in places where the weather has been
temperate.
   In Seattle, where temperatures have been running in the 40s,
slightly above normal for this time of the year, heating oil was
selling for nearly $1.02 a gallon. In Portland, Ore., where
temperatures ranged from the 30s to the 50s, heating oil costs as
much as $1.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, home heating oil for
delivery in January soared 7.23 cents Wednesday to 99.71 cents a
gallon _ 37 cents higher than the Nov. 30 price and up sharply from
53.77 cents a gallon a year earlier. On Tuesday, the contract rose
10.74 cents.
   In early trading today, the contract rose another 2.29 cents to
$1.02 a gallon.
   A contract comprises 42,000 gallons of oil, which means one
contract for heating oil would cost $41,878 at Wednesday's price.
However, the price paid by most distributors _ the people who
deliver oil by tanker truck to residential customers _ was $1.15 a
gallon Wednesday in what is known as the New York spot, or cash,
market.
   ``It's very cold outside and the inventories of heating oil got
dangerously low and it's difficult to get heating oil here prior to
the second half of January,'' said James Fiedler, an analyst with
E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc.
   Shutdowns at many refineries have worsened supply problems and
driven prices even higher.
   The most prominent shutdown was of a huge Exxon facility at
Baton Rouge, La., where a weekend explosion killed two workers. But
production at many Gulf Coast refineries has been slowed because of
frozen water pipes _ just when the oil companies were trying to
step up their output to meet the increased demand.
   ``It seems like every refinery was affected,'' Fiedler said.
``Most of the refineries have got some of their units back to
normal ... and most were talking that they'd be back to full
operation by the weekend.''
   Oil companies continued to report low heating oil supplies at
some terminals.
   At Star Enterprise, a Texaco Inc. affiliate, supplies were
tightest in the Boston area, spokesman Top Ingram said. Star has
begun limiting the amount of oil its customers can buy, he said.
   Freezing temperatures also have increased the demand for propane
and kerosene.
   In South Carolina, deliveries of the two fuels have been
hampered by icy roads and a shortage of supplies, dealers said.
Some suppliers said they were raising their prices and giving
priority to long-time customers.
   Propane prices have risen about 10 cents to $1 a gallon during
the last two weeks, while kerosene prices have risen 20 cents a
gallon, to 80 cents, dealers said.
   In Iowa, state officials said prices for liquid propane for
residential consumers have increased from under 50 cents a gallon
last month to a range of 80 cents to 95 cents a gallon.
   Natural gas customers, while not facing delivery problems of
oil, propane and kerosene users, also suffered shortages because of
increased demand.
   Philadelphia Gas Works, a city-owned system, on Wednesday asked
its 517,000 residential, commerical and industrial customers to cut
back consumption.
   PGW spokesman Don Kenley said the company's two main suppliers,
Texas Eastern Corp. and Transcontinental Pipeline Corp., cut
supplies by 28 percent because of higher demand.
   Even wood was in short supply in some areas.
   Walter Holdsworth, owner of Wakefield Firewood Inc. in
Wakefield, Va., said his wood lot was empty Friday for the first
time in 10 years. The rush began, he said, about three weeks ago
when the cold weather first set in.

   The stock market was mixed today, marking time
in the next-to-last session of the year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 2.77 to 2,721.63
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 559 up, 397 down and
538 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 17.56 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Much of the activity appeared to be devoted to last-minute
maneuvering by investors for tax and yearend portfolio reporting
purposes.
   Analysts said money managers at many investing institutions had
pretty well closed their books on 1989, and thus were making few
waves in the marketplace.
   The government is due to report Friday on the index of leading
economic indicators for November.
   Advance estimates call for a flat to slightly higher showing by
the index, which would presumably do little to resolve the
questions in investors' minds about the economic outlook for the
first half of 1990.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
rose { to 45[; International Business Machines was steady at 94};
Philip Morris lost [ to 40[, and Exxon was down [ at 50].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .17 to 192.86. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .14 at 373.10.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average gained 15.14 to
2,724.40.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 931 up, 549 down and 476 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 133.73 million shares, up from 77.61
million in the previous session.

   Stock prices hovered in a narrow range today,
marking time in the next-to-last session of the year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 2.56 to 2,721.84
by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers held a narrow edge on losers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 606 up, 598 down and
557 unchanged.
   Much of the activity appeared to be devoted to last-minute
maneuvering by investors for tax and yearend portfolio reporting
purposes.
   Analysts said money managers at many investing institutions had
pretty well closed their books on 1989, and thus were making few
waves in the marketplace.
   The government is due to report Friday on the index of leading
economic indicators for November.
   Advance estimates call for a flat to slightly higher showing by
the index, which would presumably do little to resolve the
questions in investors' minds about the economic outlook for the
first half of 1990.
   Germany Fund led the active list, up 2 at 19\. The stock of the
closed-end investment company has soared in recent days on
expectations of big benefits to West German business from the
opening up of Eastern Europe.
   Campbell Soup gained 3{ to 56{ on word that some members of the
company's founding Dorrance family want to find a buyer for their
stock.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.20 to 192.89. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .02 at 372.94.

<HEAD>Private Army Guards Legitimate Business in Rebel-Controlled Jungle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSE GONZALES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PALMA DEL ESPINO, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a remote jungle region infested
with drug smugglers and radical guerrillas, Peruvian entrepreneurs
have enlisted a private army to protect their struggling palm oil
business.
   About 1,200 workers at one of the wrld's largest palm oil
plantations go about their tasks protected by a hundred men dressed
in jungle fatigues and armed with automatic rifles.
   The guards, most of them ex-Peruvian marines, are deployed to
repel guerrilla attacks on the Palma del Espino complex, a model
project that Peru hopes will help solve its shortage of vegetable
oils.
   The private fighting force is an example of the security that
more and more legitimate businesses in this impoverished South
American nation have been forced to organize to protect themselves
from rebel sabotage.
   Located near the town of Uchiza in Peru's Upper Huallaga valley,
245 miles northeast of Lima, Palma del Espino and its 16,000 acres
of African palm trees form an oasis in a region under the domain of
cocaine traffickers and fanatical Maoist insurgents who call
themselves the Shining Path.
   The entire complex is ringed by a 6-foot-high fence and its
managers come and go by plane to avoid ambushes.
   Begun in 1979, the project is intended to help eliminate Peru's
imports of 80,000 metric tons of vegetable oils each year, which
cost more than $30 million and drain the country's foreign-exchange
reserves.
   When the first trees were planted in 1982, the company's major
concern was draining swamps, said Ruperto Raygada, the plant's
chief of operations.
   But today the illegal coca fields that stretch up and down the
150-mile-long valley have reached the plantation's doorsteps, and
rebels who prowl the surrounding jungle pose a serious threat.
   The Shining Path guerrillas have been fighting Peru's government
since 1980. They expanded into the valley from Ayacucho, their
stronghold in Peru's Andean mountains.
   The Upper Huallaga valley generates about 70 percent of the
world coca-leaf supply, the raw material for cocaine. Police say
the jungle surrounding the plantation contains 13 drug trafficking
organizations and nearly a thousand guerrilla fighters.
   Government officials say the rebels ``tax'' coca growers and
smugglers for permission to operate in the area. In return the
guerrillas provide protection from police.
   The $56 million project is proceeding and expanding despite
terrorist threats. The complex includes a processing plant, a
barracks for the workers and 18 technicians, offices and security
equipment.
   Squadrons of workers toiling by hand cultivate the African palm,
which produces 20 times more vegetable oil than any other plant.
They lug it to the processing plant using 250 mules. The result is
a red, dense liquid transformed into vegetable shortening, oil and
cosmetics ingredients.
   Palma del Espino, owned by a Peruvian industrial group, expects
to produce 20,600 tons of palm oil in 1989, more than twice what it
produced in 1987, its first year of production.
   The biggest threat, however, appears to be the insurgents who
ring the plant's perimeters. Besides their threat of attack, they
demand payment of protection money from the truckers who take the
oil to the cities.
   Some trucks have been turned back at guerrilla blockades,
forcing the plantation to store the oil in big tanks that can
accomodate 4,000 tons. The plantation recently began running out of
room, so workers gouged pits in the ground and lined them with
plastic sheets to store the excess.
   Last year the rebels dynamited nine bridges along the 70-mile
stretch of road that connects the plantation with Tingo Maria, the
largest town in the area.
   Since 1984, when the plantation was attacked for the first time,
the rebels have burned 14 trucks. The last major attack occurred in
March 1988.
   ``When they attacked us the first time, we only had one guard,''
Raygada said. ``Now we have constant patrols.''

   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly

   Slight losses in the wheat market reflected mild temperatures in
the Great Plains, where winter wheat is grown.

increase in farmer selling kept a lid on gains in the corn futures.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pan Am Corp. says it intends to protest American
Airlines' planned purchase of Eastern Airlines' profitable Latin
American routes.
   ``We strongly object to the further concentration of American's
market dominance in Latin America and the Caribbean through the
purchase of these government route authorities and facilities,''
said Pan Am spokeswoman Elizabeth Manners.
   Pan Am contends that the route transfer from ailing Eastern to
the nation's largest airline will hinder competition.
   After months of negotiations, American said Dec. 19 it would buy
Eastern's Latin American routes and certain other assets from
Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp. for $471 million.
   ``The surest sign that an asset sale is good for consumers and
enhances comepetition is the opposition of a competitor in the
market,'' Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said today. ``I don't
think anyone's surprised'' by Pan Am's plans, she said.
   Officials of American, based in Fort Worth, Texas, weren't
immediately available for comment.
   Pan Am intends to file its objections to the deal with the
Justice Department and the Department of Transportation after
American files its acquisition plan.
   Federal officials and the U.S. bankruptcy judge overseeing
Eastern's Chapter 11 financial reorganization must approve the
purchase.
   The sale would shake up the strength of airlines at Miami
International Airport, catapulting American from third place there
to first ahead of Eastern and Pan Am.
   Both American and New York-based Pan Am have boosted their
presence in Miami since Eastern was hit by a strike March 4 and
filed for bankruptcy protection five days later.

   Three members of the family that founded
Campbell Soup Co. disclosed today they would sell their 17 percent
stake and urge a sale of the entire food-products company.
   The announcement intensified speculation that Campbell, the
company that founded condensed soup popular with millions of people
around the world, would be put on the auction block due to a rift
among family members who control it.
   An investor group pushing for the sale, composed of nieces of
Campbell's late chairman John T. Dorrance Jr., said in documents it
planned to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it
was seeking ``a price per share significantly in excess of current
market value.''
   The group also said it actively would encourage Campbell's board
of directors to do the same and would consider trying to oust
members opposed to the sale.
   James H. Moran, a spokesman for Camden, N.J.-based Campbell,
said the company had no comment on today's announcement.
   Wall Street, however, responded enthusiastically. On the New
York Stock Exchange, Campbell soared $3.75 to $56.75 in active noon
trading.
   ``It's not particularly surprising,'' Pavlos M. Alexandrakis, an
industry analyst with Argus Research in New York, said of the
Dorrance familiy announcement. ``There has been a split among the
family members for some time.''
   Alexandrakis said those pushing for the sale of Campbell
probably had little interest left in running the company, and with
the right price could draft other family member to their cause.
   He described Campbell as a laggard in the food industry, slow to
update facilities and products.
   Heirs of Campbell founder John Dorrance Sr., Dorrance's father,
control about 59 percent of Campbell's 129.6 million outstanding
common shares. Speculation about their intentions have grown since
Dorrance Jr. died last April.

<HEAD>Legacy of The Reagan Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Grand economic hopes often disappear under a
mountain of emergencies, but some of the broader plans of the
Reagan administration held up remarkably well.
   Failures were big, such as budget deficits and negative trade
balances, and an inability to show statistically that Federal
spending had indeed been reduced as a percentage of gross national
product.
   Important parts of the vision were maintained, however, and the
impact of some of them can be seen in domestic and world politics
and economics, perhaps even in the overthrow of communist regimes.
   One of the primary aims of the administration was to bring
inflation and interest rates down by freeing the economy from
regulatory controls, restraining the money supply and lowering
spending.
   Such action was needed in order for other plans to work. In
December 1980, the prime rate had reached a record 21.5 percent and
three-month Treasury bills had doubled in yield in a matter of
months.
   Better control of the money supply, thanks to Federal Reserve
cooperation, helped reverse the climb in rates. An immediate tax
cut not only stimulated economic activity but helped take inflation
down from double-digit levels.
   The Economic Report of the President, sent to Congress in
February 1982, expressed the broad hopes. ``A critical element in
this outlook is the assumption that inflationary expectations will
continue to recede,'' it said.
   If the process continued as expected, the report stated,
``market rates of interest will decline significantly, wage demands
will continue to moderate, and the pro-inflationary biases ... will
quickly disappear.''
   They did, and the impact continues today.
   However, a far greater impact of the Reagan plan for the decade
can be traced to the report's section on government and the
economy. It had domestic and international ramifications.
   The section begins with this preamble:
   _``All nations which have broad-based representative government
and civil liberties have most of their economic activity organized
by the market.
   _``Economic conditions in market economies are generally
superior to those in nations (with a comparable culture and a
comparable resource base) in which the government has the dominant
economic role.''
   A major objective of the Reagan economic program, therefore, was:
   ``... to reduce the Federal government's role in economic
decision-making while strengthening the economic role of
individuals, private organizations and state and local
governments.''
   That objective, the report stated, emanated from a belief that:
   ``... the politicization of price decisions _ whether of wages,
commodities, or interest rates _ tends to reduce both the breadth
of popular support for the government and the efficiency of the
economy.''
   Nations all over the world, large and small, socialist,
capitalist and mixed, took their cue from the United States,
developing the concept of privatization, or turning over
governmental functions to the private sector.
   In every instance the goal was the same, to achieve economic
efficiency _ a higher level of responsiveness to individual and
collective needs _ by drawing on the creative self-interest of
private individuals and institutions.
   The revolution was smoothly accomplished in mostly capitalist
nations, sometimes convulsively in socialist economies, but to some
degree it occurred almost everywhere.
   Historians eventually will unravel the reasons for the
economic-political upheavals in the late 1980s, but even now they
can follow one fine thread to that 1982 economic report.
   It was written by Chairman Murray L. Weidenbaum and members
Jerry L. Jordan and William A. Niskanen, and transmitted to
Congress on February 6, 1982.

<HEAD>Dallas Firm Announces Common Stock Dividend Suspension</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plastics-maker Rexene Corp. says it will suspend
its quarterly common stock dividend, citing ``current industry
conditions, changes in the financial markets and other operating
factors.''
   The suspension of the quarter-per-share dividend comes less than
six months after Dallas-based Rexene borrowed $500 million to pay a
special $7 per share dividend to stockholders. The company, which
has forecast improved fourth quarter earnings, also is selling off
assets to pay off debt.
   Rexene was taken private in a $456 million buyout in April,
1988, financed through high yield, or junk, bonds sold by Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Four months later, Rexene went public again, selling stock at
$21.50 per share. The stock has fallen dramatically since then,
standing at $3.75 a share at mid-day Thursday, down 50 cents from
Wednesday, when it fell $1.87{ in composite trading on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Almost half of the company's new stock is held by partnerships
controlled by current or former Drexel employees, the Wall Street
Journal reported Thursday.
   In the past year, Rexene has announced a 10-percent work force
reduction, plus sales of manufacturing facilities in Bayport and
Odessa, Texas, where more than half of its employees are located.
   The Bayport facility, which includes polypropylene and
polyethylene plants, was sold to Lyondell Petrochemical Co. for $88
million. Analysts had anticipated it would bring about $100 million.
   The Odessa Styrene plant also is on the block, and the company
said Wednesday it still is looking for buyers.
   Other asset sales need to occur soon, analysts said, because an
anticipated downturn could cut their value.
   ``We are in for another shakeout so their timing in getting on
with it is rather critical,'' said Peter Savage, a vice president
at consulting firm DeWitt &amp; Co. in Houston.
   Rexene said the dividend suspension will be reviewed quarterly.
   In the latest quarter, Rexene lost $9.1 million, or 29 cents per
share, compared with a profit in 1988 of $35.5 million.
   The company, formerly known as El Paso Products Co. and based in
Odessa, makes thermoplastic resins and petrochemical products used
in the manufacture of such items as plastic milk cartons and other
containers.

   Stocks opened strongly in the wake of Wednesday's gains. But
then selling aimed at collecting profits and a weak pound pushed
shares lower.

<HEAD>Sly Ad Asks Japanese Businessman: Can You Fight 24 Hours?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GROSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They are singing it, dancing it, acting it, even
chanting it: ``Yellow and black are the sign of courage. Can you
fight 24 hours? Businessman, businessman, Japanese businessman.''
   Japan has gone wild over this catchy theme song to a television
commercial for an energy-restoring health tonic called Regain.
   Whether seen as an ode to the Japanese businessman or as a
satire of his excesses, the Regain commercial has achieved a
popularity akin to Wendy's ``Where's the Beef'' in the United
States.
   Companies play it over loudspeakers. Businessmen sing it at
parties. Students dramatize it at culture festivals. Some Japanese
even use it get out of bed every morning.
   Sankyo Co., the drink manufacturer and Japan's No. 2 drug maker,
says that since the song was first broadcast in May his office has
received 10 to 20 inquiries per day from people anxious to learn
the lyrics.
   The companies that have called Sankyo read like a list from a
Who's Who of the Tokyo Fortune 500: Nissan Motor Co., Nippon Life
Insurance Co., Shiseido Co., Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.,
Recruit Corp., Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals Inc., Mitsubishi Electric
Corp., Japan Airlines and many others.
   Not only companies, but also the Economic Planning Agency, a
police station and a city government office have requested copies
of the song, Sankyo says.
   Even students at prestigious Nada High School, perhaps
anticipating the day when they too will join the ranks of Japan's
business elite, dramatized the song at a school fest.
   The commercial features the swarthy young television star Saburo
Tokito as a businessman stalking deals in foreign lands, keeping
his strength up with the tonic drink.
   In one version, Tokito is rowed through the canals of Venice to
a ship. He climbs a rope ladder while belting out the song and is
greeted on deck by executives waiting for him to sign a contract.
They explode in applause, confetti and clicking cameras. Before the
shot pans to the tonic bottle with its yellow-and-black label,
there is a glimpse of a newspaper headline in English: ``Japanese
Businessman Pulls it Off.''
   A group of engineers at the Hitachi VLSI Device Development
Center used three weeks of their overtime and weekends to adapt the
Regain tune for a company song contest. In their version,
businessmen wielding attache cases dance their way through crowded
train stations and sexy barmaids _ while singing about the trials
of being a Hitachi businessman.
   Why all the fuss?
   Yukichi Amano, a well-known advertising critic, says the
self-lampooning in the commercial has found a very receptive
audience.
   ``Singing in loud voices with one's comrades this obviously
unrealistic, parodying, comic song fits the taste of today's
Japanese,'' he says, citing the absurdity of the song's call to
work 24 hours a day.
   Tokito's robot-like singing and expressionless face when kissed
by a South Pacific beauty in one version of the commercial are jabs
at the stereotypical overserious, overworked Japanese businessman,
Amano says.
   ``That Japan has become the richest country in the world does
not make Japanese truly happy. They love expressing their cynicism,
even self-scorn.''
   Jun Moriwaki, who was Regain's commercial planner, says the ad
was not originally designed to mock the businessman.
   ``We thought of it from the start as a pep song, that if you
drink (Regain) you'd feel energetic again.''
   Moriwaki says he and associates at Dentsu Inc., Japan's biggest
advertising firm, were looking to create a new image of the
businessman, a new ``Japanese hero.''
   ``There's a pattern to the Japanese who appear in Hollywood
movies: with thick glasses and cameras hanging from their
shoulders. We wanted to start off from there. If Tokito is the
Japanese businessman, when he is with foreigners he would not
cower; he would stand equal to them. To go one step further, he
might even look down at them.''
   To the 29-year-old Moriwaki, the image of the Japanese
businessman who never takes a break has always been depressing:
even when he goes home he is ignored by his wife who pays more
attention to the kids. But Moriwaki says his peers, who are now
filling the work force and at whom he is aiming the commercial, are
different.
   ``When we work, we work very hard and don't care about going
without sleep to do our work. But when we rest, we insist on taking
our vacations. The younger the person is, the better he is able to
divide his life that way. These people just enjoy the commercial as
a kind of joke.''
   Some Japanese do not seem to have gotten the punch line, however.
   Shortly after the song appeared, the Labor Ministry made an
informal protest to Sankyo. Ministry officials wanted to make sure
the sponsors of the commercial were not obstructing government
efforts to get Japanese to work less hard.

   KeyCorp Chairman and President Victor J. Riley
Jr. on Thursday was elected to serve a three-year term as a
director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
   Riley was selected by middle-sized banks _ those with capital
and surplus between $30 million and $400 million _ in the second
Federal Reserve district to serve as one of the board's class A
directors, succeeding Alberto M. Paracchini, chairman of the Banco
de Ponce.
   The middle banks also re-elected John A. Georges, chairman of
International Paper, to a second term as a class B director.
   Each year a different group of banks elects two directors. Six
of the New York Fed's nine directors are elected by the district's
member banks. The class A directors, who control three seats, are
bankers. The remainder _ three class B and three class C directors
_ represent various interests including agriculture, commerce,
industry, services, labor and consumers.
   Separately, the Federal Reserve System's Board of Governors
reappointed Cyrus R. Vance, a partner in the Simpson, Thacher &amp;
Bartlett law firm, as a class C director. He and Barnard College
President Ellen V. Futter were reappointed chairman and deputy
chairman, respectively, of the New York Fed's board.
   The appointments take effect Jan. 1.

<HEAD>Ames to Close 15 Stores in February</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKY HILL, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ames Department Stores Inc., still
adjusting to its purchase last year of hundreds of Zayre stores,
announced Thursday that it will close 15 stores in Feburary.
   The retailer said most of the stores are former Zayre stores and
14 of them are in areas where Ames stores will continue to operate.
The chain announced the closing of three other stores on Christmas
Eve.
   ``After we acquired the Zayre stores in October 1988, we closed
74 underperforming stores,'' Peter B. Hollis, Ames president and
chief excecutive officer said Thursday.
   ``We also identified additional Ames and Zayre stores with
overlapping trade areas,'' Hollis said. ``After reviewing recent
sales results, which reflect a fragmentation of the market, we have
decided to close these 15 stores and focus our efforts on the
remaining stores in these areas.
   ``We have no current plans for future closings, and hope to be
able to offer positions in nearby Ames stores to many of the
affected stores associates,'' Hollis said.
   Bill Roberts, a spokesman for Ames, said sales at the 15 stores
were not strong, but he said the chain was also concerned about the
prospect for future sales.
   ``When you have two stores in that proximity, you're essentially
competing with yourself,'' he said.
   Ames, one of the nation's biggest discount retailers, operates
629 Ames stores and 61 Zayre stores in 20 states.
   The stores to be closed Feb. 3 are in Norwich, Conn.; Panama
City, Fla.; Brunswick, Maine; Rockland, Maine; Ellsworth, Maine;
Presque Isle, Maine; Plaistow, N.H.; and Somersworth, N.H.
   Also to be closed are stores in Lockport, N.Y.; Brockport, N.Y.;
Plattsburg, N.Y.; Harrisburg, Pa.; Cleona, Pa.; Woodbridge, Va.;
and Barre, Vt.
   The retailer announced Dec. 24 that it was closing stores in
Seabrook, N.H., Muncie, Ind., and West Bridgewater, Mass.
   Ames, based in Rocky Hill, Conn., bought Zayre Corp.'s discount
division for $778 million in October 1988. The acquisition included
more than 300 stores and the names on 254 of them were changed to
Ames this past October.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Climb on Rumored East Europe Meal Buying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices rose strongly Thursday on
the Chicago Board of Trade, leading the grain markets higher amid
widespread rumors of new buying interest from Eastern Europe.
   The Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary
all were said to be in the market for soybean meal.
   Algeria was rumored to have bought some U.S. soybean meal
overnight.
   The rally halted a downward trend in the soybean market, which
had been drifting lower for more than a week.
   A pickup in soybean meal sales in Europe also supported the
market, analysts said.
   The strength in the soybean complex spilled over to the corn and
wheat markets, which had opened nearly unchanged due to a lack of
significant new export business.
   At the close, wheat futures were } cent to 2{ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in March at $4.08\ a bushel; corn was 1
cent to 2\ cents higher with March at $2.40 a bushel; oats were 1\
cents to 2 cents higher with March at $1.54 a bushel; soybeans were
4\ cents to 7{ cents higher with January at $5.70 a bushel.

   Assets of the nation's 469 money market mutual
funds fell $1.10 billion in the latest week to $366.01 billion, the
Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The decline in the seven-day period ended Wednesday followed a
$210.0 million increase in the funds' assets the previous week, the
Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. The rise originally
was reported as $208.2 million but the institute revised it upward.
   Fund assets hit a record high $368.23 billion in the week ended
Nov. 21, 1989.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 227 general purpose funds fell $523.8 million to $119.98
billion, assets of 98 broker-dealer funds dropped $371.5 million to
$158.41 billion, and assets of 144 institutional funds declined
$208.1 million to $87.61 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.87 percent from 7.91 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.91 percent from 7.92 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
41 days, down from 42 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts fell to 6.35 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.36 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.08 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.93
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.95
percent the previous week. Yields were 7.95 percent on 1-year CDs,
down from 7.98 percent; 7.91 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 7.94
percent; and 7.92 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 7.95 percent.

<HEAD>Cattle Industry Says Beef Demand Stabilizing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cattle industry said Thursday that demand
for beef is stabilizing after several years of decline, in part
because farmers and ranchers have responded to consumer tastes by
producing leaner cuts.
   If bones are counted, Americans buy more chicken. If the bones
are omitted from retail weights, beef is the leader.
   The National Cattlemen's Association said it expects little
change next year in average per capita beef supplies and average
consumer prices.
   The association's president-elect, John Lacey, said the cutting
away fat from retail cuts has helped improve beef's image. He also
cited breeding and feeding advances as further boosts for the
industry.
   Topper Thorpe, general manager of Cattle-Fax, a market
information service, said no dramatic changes are expected in the
nation's cattle herd or in U.S. beef production in 1990.
   But today's total cattle herd of about 100 million head,
including dairy animals, is producing almost as much beef as the
much larger herds of the 1970s, Thorpe told a news conference.
   Cattle herds peaked at about 132 million head in the mid-1970s
and generally have fallen because of oversupply, rising production
costs, drought and other factors. Thorpe said the herd liquidation
has ended and a ``modest expansion'' has begun.
   ``Now, if weather is favorable and if financing becomes cheaper,
more producers may hold back heifers and expand their breeding
herds,'' he said. ``However, we do not see foresee rapid
expansion.''
   Using one method based on bone-in retail weights, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture says per capita consumption of beef in
1990 may drop slightly to an average of 67.8 pounds from 68.6
pounds in 1989 and 72.1 pounds in 1988. The peak was 94 pounds in
1976.
   Total poultry, which includes broilers, baking hens and turkeys,
has been setting records annually and is forecast to average 89.4
pounds in 1990, up from 84.4 in 1989 and 80.6 in 1988. Poultry
first passed beef in 1987.
   But the cattle industry says in its promotion campaign that if
you take away the bones, beef is still far ahead of poultry.
   Richard Stillman of USDA's Economic Research Service said that
on a boneless basis 1989 per capita beef consumption may average
67.1 pounds, down from 68.2 in 1988. A further slight decline is
expected in 1990.
   On the same boneless basis, he said, 1989 poultry consumption
may average 59.9 pounds, up from 57.2 pounds in 1988, with another
gain in the works next year.

<TEXT>
   Government officials on Thursday outlined a package
of tax incentives, tariff eliminations and other measures aimed at
reversing past trade policies and making Japan an importing
powerhouse in the 1990s.
   Trade experts in the United States welcomed the plan as a sign
Japan has recognized it must import more goods. But they were
hesitant to comment on how much of an impact the program ultimately
might have on the availability of U.S. goods in Japan.
   Reacting to the Japanese announcement, U.S. Trade Representative
Carla Hills said, ``We applaud any efforts to open markets.'' But
she cautioned that U.S. officials would be watching for actual
results.
   ``The tax program appears to be quite complicated and we will
have to wait and see whether and how it affects importing
behavior,'' she said.
   The trade program comes as the United States is pressuring Japan
to remove what it considers impediments to free trade, which the
United States blames for worsening its huge foreign trade deficit.
   A report released by the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry called the package of import expansion measures _ which
will be submitted to Parliament early next year _ ``unparalleled in
history.''
   ``It is a 180-degree turnaround from the old (export-oriented)
policies of the 1960s,'' said Masahisa Naito, director general of
the ministry's International Trade Administration Bureau. ``We will
try to assure that imports, which are a latecomer into the Japanese
marketplace, will take root.''
   The report said MITI plans to boost the import-expansion related
budget to $50 million in fiscal 1990, which begins April 1, from
$13.5 million this fiscal year.
   The money would be used to finance a nationwide information
network and computer databank, promote trade missions and boost the
exchange of trade experts to act as ``match-makers'' for potential
exporters and importers.
   MITI also intends to eliminate tariffs on 1,004 items, and
reduce levies on four more. The value of imports of these items
currently totals $13 billion, the report said.
   The total package, Naito said, would cost the government $1
billion a year in lost taxes.
   The tariff-cutting measures are the first of their kind since
1986, when the government slashed levies on 1,800 items as part of
its market-opening ``action program.''
   Naito said the plan includes a tax cut for companies that import
10 percent more than their highest previous level, and an
additional depreciation rate of 10 percent to 20 percent on some
imported machinery and equipment.
   Retailers and wholesalers would be allowed to set aside 20
percent of the increased import value, tax-free, to be used for
marketing imported goods.
   The report said more than half of all capital goods, including
semiconductors and computers, qualify for import promotion under
the program. Other items covered include automobiles, electrical
appliances and sporting goods.
   The government also would offer $1.5 billion in loans and import
credits.
   In Washington, some trade experts said it could be too early to
determine how effective the plan would be once it actually was
implemented.
   ``I think we should welcome this as recognition by Japan that
there is a problem,'' said Ronnie Goldberg, senior vice president
at the U.S. Council for International Business. ``But whether it's
as good as it sounds, I really don't know.
   ``In the past there has been less than what met the eye coming
out of these kinds of initiatives,'' said Goldberg, whose group
represents U.S. businesses in international economic organizations.
   Willard M. Berry, vice president of the National Foreign Trade
Council, a lobbying group for U.S. companies, had a similar
reaction. ``Is this really market access? I can't say without
studying'' the plan.
   Naito said MITI expects the measures to eliminate discrepancies
between the costs of products in Japan and abroad, make the
Japanese distribution system more efficient, and lead to the
breakdown of the ``keiretsu'' system in which many Japanese
companies are clustered in tightly knit groups.
   All of those issues are on the table in the U.S.-Japan
``Structural Impediments Initiative'' trade talks.
   Naito said a government economic forecast for fiscal 1990
approved by the Cabinet on Thursday predicted a $3 billion decline
in Japan's trade surplus next year, from the current $81 billion to
$78 billion.
   ``This (prediction) reflects how sincere and convinced we are of
the effects these measures will generate,'' Naito said.
   He said the forecast was based on an estimated 10.3 percent
increase in imports in the coming year, bringing their total value
from $195 billion in fiscal 1989 to $215 billion.
   The government also estimated exports will grow from $276
billion to $293 billion next year, an increase of 6.2 percent, he
said.
   Naito said the Japanese government has realized the need to
drastically reduce its huge trade surplus, which has been roughly
$90 billion a year for the past three years.
   ``We believe that it is not appropriate for Japan to continue
with such a large trade surplus, and that if it does continue, the
preservation of the free trade system could become difficult,'' he
said.

   Stock prices inched ahead Thursday, continuing
their tentative yearend rally in the next-to-last session of 1989.
   Much of the activity appeared to be devoted to final maneuvering
by investors for tax and yearend portfolio reporting purposes.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.90 to 2,732.30,
bringing its gain over the past two trading days to 23.04 points.

Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the

   Analysts said money managers at many investing institutions had

   Advance estimates call for a flat to slightly higher showing by

   With only Friday's trading left in 1989, the Dow Jones

   The dollar finished sharply higher in domestic
trading Thursday after putting in a mixed performance overseas.
   Gold prices fell. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold
bullion for current delivery settled at $398.60 a troy ounce, down
$2.20 from Wednesday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a
late bid for gold at $399.50 an ounce, off $1.50.
   Trading was thin in Europe, where the dollar was buffeted by
trading in other currencies. Dealers in Frankfurt said the Bank of
England and the central bank of the Netherlands intervened to curb
the strength of the West German mark against their currencies.
   But when dealings shifted to the United States, the dollar moved
sharply higher on technical factors, traders said. The dollar's
biggest move came against the Japanese yen, which was adversely
affected by reports of political uncertainty in the face of coming
elections.
   The dollar traded in seesaw fashion throughout the session. Its
moves were ``accentuated by the thin market,'' said Michael
McDonald, a trader at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
   ``The (West German) mark remained the strongest currency in the
world,'' he said, noting that interest-rate differentials are
tipping in favor of West Germany over the United States. Further
bolstering the mark is the assumption that the opening of East
Germany will spur a demand for West German products.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 142.15 Japanese yen from
142.10 yen on Wednesday. Later in London, it rose to 143.15 yen. In
New York the dollar closed at 143.55 yen, up from 142.00 yen on
Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6137 from $1.6255 late
Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.6045 to buy one pound, cheaper
than Wednesday's $1.6275.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday included: 1.6875 West German marks, up from 1.6855;
1.5390 Swiss francs, up from 1.5295; 5.7675 French francs, up from
5.7600; 1,264.15 Italian lire, up from 1,263.75, and 1.1568
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1574.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday
included: 1.6905 West German marks, up from 1.6895; 1.5385 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5355; 5.7665 French francs, down from 5.7760;
1.9000 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9080; 1,264.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,266.00, and 1.1563 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1587.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $399.50 a troy ounce,
from $406.25 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a
closing bid of $400.00, from $406.00 bid late Wednesday. Earlier in
Hong Kong, gold fell $6.88 to close at a bid $401.61.
   Silver prices also declined. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $5.150 a troy ounce, down from
$5.240 on Wednesday. Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid
price of $5.15 a troy ounce, from $5.41 bid late Wednesday.

   Orange juice futures prices added to their freeze-driven gains
Thursday on news that Brazilian officials had halted orange-juice
exports to assess the Florida situation and decide whether to raise
prices.
   Near-month heating oil futures closed lower for the first time
in nine days as waves of profit-seeking sellers swept through the
market.
   On other commodity markets, precious metals retreated; grains
and soybeans advanced; and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   All frozen concentrated orange juice futures rose the
5-cents-a-pound daily limit on the New York Cotton Exchange except
the limitless contract for January delivery, which soared 7.85
cents to $1.58 a pound.
   The January contract had fallen on Wednesday, perhaps indicating
the market had fully absorbed the price impact of the weekend
freeze in Florida.
   But rumors surfaced late Wednesday, and were confirmed on
Thursday, that Brazil had suspended exports of orange juice until
Tuesday. Brazil is the world's largest producer of orange juice and
a major supplier to the U.S. market.
   ``I believe that caused a little bit of panic on the part of the
trade and the speculators,'' said Celeste Georkakis, an analyst
with Cargill Investor Services Inc.
   Forecasts for warmer temperatures in the Florida citrus belt
spurred further buying of futures. A warmup would hasten the
falling and rotting of freeze-damaged fruit, frustrating the
efforts of orange producers to get it all picked and processed
before it spoils.
   Heating oil for January delivery ended sharply lower on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, but not as sharply as it was down earlier
in the session during a virtual tidal wave of profit-taking.
   The selling peaked late in the morning when the January contract
fell to 88 cents a gallon, 11.71 cents below the previous day's
settlement, after peaking at $1.02. The contract finished Thursday
with a loss of 3.31 cents.
   ``The contract had gained almost 20 cents a gallon in a little
over two days' trading,'' noted analyst Andrew Lebow of E.D.&amp; F.
Man International Futures Inc. in New York. ``Certainly a market
like that is due for some liquidation and I think we saw it today.''
   The recent gains reflected tightening supplies of heating oil
due to unusually cold weather.
   Wholesale home heating oil settled 3.31 cents lower to .28 cent
higher with January at 96.40 cents a gallon; West Texas
Intermediate crude oil finished 17 cents to 28 cents lower with
February at $21.50 a barrel; unleaded gasoline was .44 cent to 1.06
cents lower with January at 60.11 cents a gallon.
   Gold and silver futures fell sharply for the second straight day
on New York's Commodity Exchange amid a continued lack of investor
demand for precious metals.
   Gold futures settled $2.40 to $3.50 lower with February at
$401.40 a troy ounce; silver was 9.6 cents to 11.6 cents lower with
January at $5.15 a troy ounce.
   Soybean futures prices rose strongly on the Chicago Board of
Trade, leading the grain markets higher amid widespread rumors of
new buying interest from Eastern Europe.
   Soybean futures settled 4{ cents to 7{ cents higher with January
at $5.69 a bushel; wheat was } cent to 2{ cents higher with March
at $4.08{ a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2\ cents higher with March
at $2.40 a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 2 cents higher with March
at $1.54 a bushel.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, pork belly futures advanced
in reaction to a monthly Agriculture Department cold-storage report
issued Wednesday that showed fewer-than-expected bellies in the
nation's commercial freezers.
   Most livestock futures retreated in light trading.
   Live cattle futures were .08 cent to .15 cent lower with
February at 77.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to
.25 cent lower with January at 84.70 cents a pound; live hogs were
.40 cent lower to .07 cent higher with February at 48.85 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .40 cent to .57 cent higher with
February at 49.75 cents a pound.

<HEAD>GM Plans to Cut 3,200 Jobs at Kansas, Georgia, Oklahoma Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>

   General Motors Corp. will cut about 3,200
production jobs at three plants in February and March because of
slow auto sales, the nation's biggest automaker said Thursday in
another indication of the industry's severe slump.
   The cuts are in addition to temporary shutdowns announced last
week by GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. and mark the second
major production cuts announced by GM in as many weeks.
   ``The market is forecast to be continually weak into the first
part of 1990,'' said William Steele of Montgomery Securities Inc.
in San Francisco.
   The Big Three auto companies said last week they planned
temporary January shutdowns at 42 of their 53 U.S. assembly plants,
affecting more than 127,000 workers.
   Ford and Chrysler spokesmen said Thursday their companies hadn't
made plans for further cuts.
   At GM, production will be cut in February and March at three
midsize car assembly plants, spokeswoman Nettie H. Seabrooks said.
   On Feb. 26, the company will lay off the 1,900-employee
afternoon shift at the Doraville, Ga., plant where the Oldsmobile
Cutlass Supreme is made, Seabrooks said.
   On the same date, about 700 of the 4,200 workers at GM's
Fairfax, Kan., plant will be laid off, cutting production of the
Pontiac Grand Prix, she said.
   On March 26, about 600 of the 6,000 employees at GM's Oklahoma
City plant will be taken off assembly line work as Buick Century,
Pontiac 6000 and Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera production is slowed.
   The Oklahoma City employees won't be laid off, but will be
transferred to a ``jobs bank'' that provides them with other work
while production jobs are suspended, Seabrooks said.
   She said the cutbacks are for an indefinite period.
   General Motors on Dec. 22 announced it planned to eliminate a
production shift at its Linden, N.J. on Feb. 26, resulting in
indefinite layoffs for about 1,600 workers. The automaker also cut
or indefinitely idle a total of about 1,040 jobs at three Canadian
plants.
   GM is cutting production because of slow auto sales that have
bloated inventories at a time that slow economic growth is not
expected to help reverse the trend.
   ``With so much talk of recession, it causes people to hold off
on their big ticket purchases,'' Steele said.
   However, he predicted, sales are likely to revive with easing
interest rates late in the first half of 1990.
   Steele said that after a slow start, car and light truck sales
would total 14.4 million for 1990 _ falling short of an expected
14.9 million total for 1989 _ and then rally to 15.5 million in
1991.

   Advertisements for the Infiniti luxury car
finally show the mysterious car itself.
   After months of new age ads featuring rocks and crashing waves,
Nissan Motor Corp.'s Infiniti Division and its advertising agency
switched gears Wednesday with two-page ads in major daily
newspapers nationwide.
   The ads in The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times and other
papers in 34 metropolitan areas featured 15 photos of the new
Infiniti Q45 luxury sedan.
   ``This is the evolution of the directional side of our
campaign,'' Chuck Kushell, executive vice president and general
manager of Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos Inc.'s Marina del
Rey, Calif., office, said Thursday.
   The first phase of the advertising campaign featured serene
nature scenes and was intended to establish Infiniti's image,
Kushell said.
   In the new phase, he said, ``We have an opportunity to talk
about the products and actively support our dealers by telling
people that there's a dealer in their home town and where they can
find the car to drive it.''
   Kushell said the more general, image-setting ads will continue,
along with the more specific ads in areas with dealers.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices, which had risen sharply
in recent days, dropped Thursday amid profit-taking and higher
deposit requirements imposed by the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   January heating oil, which has led the recent price jump, fell
3.31 cents to 96.40 cents a gallon on the exchange after surging
7.23 cents Wednesday. The February contract rose 0.28 cent to 74.17
cents a gallon, while contracts for later delivery fell between
0.54 cent and 1.43 cents.
   Meanwhile, wholesale unleaded gasoline for January delivery lost
0.74 cent to close at 60.11 cents a gallon and West Texas
Intermediate, the U.S. key grade of crude oil, dropped 28 cents to
$21.50 cents a barrel.
   Analysts said selling activity began at the opening bell after
Wednesday's late announcement by the New York Merc that it was
raising margin, or deposit, requirements for customers.
   At the start of trading Thursday, cash deposits for spot heating
oil and unleaded gasoline contracts, rose from $4,000 to $7,000 per
contract, said Nacamah Jacobovits, spokeswoman for the exchange.
   Those requirements will go up to $10,000 starting Friday and to
$15,000 on Tuesday, the next regular trading day after the New
Year's Day holiday.
   ``To raise the money, many investors have to liquidate their
contracts,'' Ms. Jacobovits said.
   Energy analysts said the new requirements began forcing out the
weaker players in the market.
   ``It put a big damp towel on the market and got rid of the
phonies _ the people that don't belong there,'' said Kevin Breslin,
analyst with United Energy Inc.
   Heating oil and gasoline contracts comprise 42,000 gallons each.
   Analysts said profit-taking also contributed to the price
erosion after the recent steady rise in futures prices.
   Heating oil had soared more than 40 percent in the the last two
weeks _ from 70.42 cents a gallon on Dec. 15 for the January
contract to 99.71 cents on Wednesday.
   Analysts said in addition to the margin requirements, new
imports may help to dampen prices in coming days, which would be
good news for consumers.
   About 30 cargos, or 270 million gallons, of heating oil are
headed for the United States from Europe, said Sal Gilbertie,
assistant vice president and energy analyst with Elders Futures Inc.
   ``When prices rose sharply everyone with spare heating oil in
Europe began shipping to the U.S.,'' he said.
   Record-setting cold temperatures across the nation in the last
two weeks raised the demand for heating oil, depleted already low
inventories and sent retail prices rocketing. In some states,
heating oil prices nearly doubled.
   Furthermore, frigid weather caused refinery problems in Texas
and Louisiana that delayed the shipment of crude oil to some areas.
   ``We hope to see retail prices stabilize over the next week,''
Gilbertie said.

   The three principal measures of the nation's
money supply rose in the week ended Dec. 18, the Federal Reserve
Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose
to a seasonally adjusted $795.7 billion from $793.2 billion the
previous week.
   The measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $3,215.6
billion from $3,208.7 billion.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,036.6 billion from $4,036.2 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 4.4 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 3.3 percent, which is below the
Fed's target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,185.8 billion, a 7.5
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,018.6 billion, up 2.4 percent, while M1
rose 6.2 percent to an average of $789.0 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $496 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$168 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $293.6 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, down from $295.7 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Interest Rates Soar to 600 Percent a Month</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interest rates skyrocketed to 600
percent a month Thursday amid continuing economic turmoil and
runaway inflation.
   Banks paid their biggest depositors the 600 percent rate to
retain funds that otherwise may have been withdrawn and converted
to U.S. dollars.
   Investors have bought dollars heavily for two months, driving
down the austral, Argentina's national currency, to a value of
1,950-1 on Thursday from 728-1 on Nov. 1, a devaluation of 63
percent.
   The monthly interest rates amounted to six times the rates
quoted two days ago. It is impossible to predict what rates might
be next Tuesday, when banks open after yearend holidays Friday and
Monday.
   Virtually no one can afford to borrow except the government,
which pays that much and more on the reserves it requires banks to
set aside. Reserves average about 63 percent of banks' total
deposits.
   As the austral has lost its value, prices have soared.
   A survey by the Federation of Commercial Centers indicated that
in Buenos Aires medicine prices soared by an average 334 percent in
December; food, 210 percent; hardware items, 240 percent; clothing,
200 percent.
   Pharmacies reported their distributors were refusing to deliver
goods, particularly imported medicines, for fear of charging too
little and not being able to resupply.
   A quart of milk cost 470 australs, or 24 cents, on Thursday, up
from about 170 australs earlier this month. A movie ticket cost
2,100 australs, $1.07, up from about 900 australs.
   Since November, one economy minister and two Central Bank
presidents have been sacked, two stabilization plans launched and
financial institutions closed four times by government order.
   ``Did someone tell you they see a light at the end of the
tunnel? I don't, not now or in 1990,'' said a Central Bank official
speaking condition of anonymity.
   Analysts attribute the financial turmoil to a lack of public
confidence in President Carlos Menem's ability to carry out a
proposed program of economic reform in the face of opposition by
unions, businesses that sell to the state and his own Peronist
Party.
   Menem won national elections in May and took office in July.
   The core of the program is the reduction of state expenditures
that contribute to chronic inflation and the sale of public
companies that annually ring up huge deficits.
   Wages are linked to the government's calculation of inflation
but have failed to keep pace. Many public and private employees
received raises of 6.5 percent in early December to compensate them
for the cost of living in November.
   Economy Minister Antonio Gonzalez predicted that inflation in
December may top 50 percent.
   Inflation for the first 11 months of 1989 increased by 3,731
percent, according to the National Institute of Statistics and
Census, including 114 percent in June and 197 percent in July.

<TEXT>
   SmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratories Inc.
has agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle a federal investigation of
alleged kickbacks for physicians who referred Medicare and Medicaid
business to the company, the government said Thursday.
   The Department of Health and Human Services' inspector general
found that more than 100 physicians were investors in three
California laboratories managed by the company.
   The inspector general's office said the arrangement under which
doctors were recruited as investors and lab profits were
distributed to those same doctors violated a federal law
prohibiting payments intended to induce referrals of Medicaid and
Medicare patients.
   The $1.5 million settlement was the largest ever made under the
law, the inspector general's office said.
   SmithKline spokeswoman Tobey Dichter said the settlement ``is an
agreement that was reached to avoid costly litigation and
disruption to our business.
   ``It is not an admission of liability in any way. We say there
was no wrongdoing. We believe it is an ambiguous statute,'' she
said.
   The inspector general proposed the three laboratories be barred
permanently from participating in Medicare, Medicaid, Social
Security and California health care programs and that some
individuals and companies linked to the labs be barred for several
years.
   The inspector general's office said the arrangement cost the
federal health care programs an unspecified amount of money.
   ``Our studies have shown that with this type of arrangement
there is a significant amount of overutilization by those
doctors,'' said D. McCarty Thornton, chief of litigation in the
inspector general's office. Doctors ordering unecessary tests
``does cost the program significant amounts of money,'' he said.
   The company agreed to cooperate in the continuing investigation.
The inspector general's office said documents on agreements the
company has with 56 other physician-owned laboratories indicate
there may be other illegal arrangements.
   ``Physicians referring (business) to entities in which they have
an ownership interest and contractual arrangements such as those
involved here are very common in the industry,'' the inspector
general's office said in a statement.
   The labs covered in the settlement were established by the
Hanlester Network of Santa Ana, Calif. SmithKline Beecham Clinical
Laboratories Inc., based in King of Prussia, Pa., contracted to
manage the facilities.
   Under the inspector general's recommendation, the Pacific
Physicians Clinical Laboratory Ltd. of Santa Ana, the Omni
Physicians Clinical Laboratory Ltd. of Pasadena and the Placer
Physicians Clinical Laboratory Ltd. of Sacramento would be barred
from the various government health care programs.
   Patric Hooper, a Los Angeles lawyer representing the three labs,
said they will challenge the HHS attempt to bar them from the
programs on the ground that the department lacks authority to take
the action.
   He added that payments to the physician-investors were based on
amount of ownership, not on referrals, and that the investment was
marketed to physicians because they ``have an interest in
maintaining the quality of the laboratory to which they send a
specimen.''

<HEAD>Dallas Man Wants To Buy Braniff, Turn It Into Business Fliers' Carrier</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Braniff Inc. would be returned to Texas and
revived as a business fliers' airline _ with some entire flights
reserved for corporations _ under a Dallas businessman's plan to
buy the company now in bankruptcy reorganization.
   Kay Cohlmia, a former Braniff employee and aviation company
owner, said Thursday he has lined up some investors, but hasn't
arrived at a price for the airline. Braniff, based in Orlando,
Fla., filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in late
September and has ceased operations.
   ``We don't know how much money it's going to take to buy it,''
he said.
   Cohlmia said he talked to attorneys for Braniff's unsecured
creditors' committee, to Merrill Lynch Capital Partners and to
Teamsters union officials.
   ``We're going to take a look and see what his idea is,'' said
Richard Levy, an attorney in New York for Braniff's unsecured
creditors.
   But Levy cautioned, ``It's nothing like there's something that's
moving with any pace here. We'll consider all appropriate ideas, as
I hope (Braniff) will.''
   Cohlmia said he would go to Orlando to discuss his plans with
various people involved in Braniff's bankruptcy proceeding on Jan.
6, the same day a series of court hearings are scheduled.
   He said he hasn't talked to Braniff officials because ``they
won't appoint anybody there'' to run the airline.
   Braniff moved its headquarters from Dallas to Orlando earlier
this year, but Cohlmia said he would return the carrier to its
traditional home.
   Cohlmia _ who once proposed a ``smokers' airline'' _ provided
only bare outlines of his plan, which he said includes a contract
with Dallas company JOH Inc. to lease jets for the first outbound
and last inbound flights daily out of Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport.
   He described JOH as a diversified holding company owned by Jo
Ann Harris. Ms. Harris had not returned phone calls late Thursday.
   ``Depending on how many planes we're allowed to get,'' he said a
Cohlmia-run Braniff would be a long-haul, one-price carrier,
ferrying businessmen from New York to Dallas and other cities. He
envisions a round-trip fare at $399 between Dallas and New York.
The current full-price, round-trip fare is about $900 on most
carriers.
   ``We have a great plan, an incredible plan,'' he said.
   Cohlmia worked for Braniff in the 1960s as a baggage handler
before founding Cohlmia Aviation Inc., which ferried checks for the
Federal Reserve System.
   Then in 1984 and 1985, he said, ``I put the first mail hub
together, operating the western part of the United States, using
Las Vegas as our hub.''
   ``I thought he was a good operator,'' Las Vegas postmaster
Joseph A. Ryan said, adding Cohlmia lost the contract to a lower
bidder after 18 months.
   Braniff had 4,800 employees, including about 450 in Dallas, when
it filed for bankruptcy protection on Sept. 28.
   BIA Acquisitions, an investor group formed by PaineWebber Group
Inc., bought Braniff in 1988 for about $100 million.

   The revelry of the New Year's weekend marks the
end of bourbon's 200th year, but the only truly American liquor
faces declining consumption as drinkers turn to sipping cordials
and gulping vodka.
   Outside the United States, especially in Japan, ``bourbon is
accepted as a very sophisticated, very American, very high price,
very quality spirit,'' said Barry Berish, president of Jim Beam
Brands Co., which makes the best-selling U.S. bourbon.
   But that's at odds with bourbon's image back home, where it's
considered an everyday kind of liquor, summoning images of
two-fisted drinkers throwing back shots of bourbon or patrician
Southerners sipping bourbon in the form of mint juleps.
   Bourbon has only half the share of the U.S. distilled spirits
market it had 20 years ago, falling from 20.7 percent in 1970 to
about 10 percent in 1988, the last year for which numbers were
available.
   After hitting a high of 25.5 million cases in 1973, U.S. bourbon
consumption has fallen to 15.3 million cases in 1988, according to
Jobson's Liquor Handbook, an industry guide.
   ``Basically, it's the white goods _ the vodkas, gins, tequilas,
rums and cordials'' that are gaining, said Jobson's Editor Nicholas
Furlotte. Vodka's now the most popular stiff drink in America, with
30.2 million cases sold in 1988.
   Bourbon is generally considered to be the legacy of a pioneer
Baptist minister living in the wilds of what was then Bourbon
County, Va., a region that's now part of Kentucky.
   Sometime in 1789 _ probably September, according to the
Dallas-based Bourbon Information Bureau _ the Rev. Elijah Craig
mixed spring water, corn, rye, barley malt and who knows what else
to concoct bourbon.
   Within 21 years, the region had 2,000 stills and bourbon had
even become an unofficial currency.
   Today, Kentucky is home to 14 bourbon distilleries and produces
80 percent of the world's bourbon supply.
   The liquor Craig devised was clear, however, not the amber
bourbon we know today. The reason, according to even less provable
lore, has to do with a barrel maker's mistake.
   ``According to legend, a 19th century barrel maker was steaming
and bending barrel staves over an open fire,'' the Bourbon
Information Bureau says. ``He didn't watch the staves carefully
enough and they soon began to char. Being a frugal fellow, he went
ahead and used them anyway, not bothering to tell the distiller.
   ``However, the distiller who used the barrel found that his
whiskey had improved in flavor and picked up a rich color. Needless
to say, he insisted that all of his barrels in the future have
charred staves.''
   And now, according to a federal law passed in 1964, a liquor can
only be called bourbon if it contains more than 51 percent corn in
the mash, and is aged in ``new charred oak containers'' for at
least two years. Some bourbons, however, contain more corn and are
aged longer.
   The holidays are an especially important time in the liquor
business. In 1988, 13.7 percent of bourbon sales were in December,
according to Jobson's, and Furlotte estimates that 25 percent to 35
percent of sales come between Thanksgiving and New Year's.
   Bourbon apparently is most popular in Washington, D.C., which
leads the per capita rankings for bourbon consumption.
Washingtonians drink up 161.3 cases per thousand people _ almost
three times the national average of 62.2 cases.
   Kentucky is second at 139.5 cases per thousand residents.
   While consumption of bourbon and other distilled spirits has
been declining, Jobson's says the fall seems to have slowed, and
``people want the best, but they don't want to feel as if they're
being taken.''
   The Bourbon Information Bureau, a promotional office funded by
the Schenley American Whiskey Group, says ``a shakeout is taking
place among marginal and less-profitable brands,'' leaving the
market open for the biggest bourbon producers.
   Jim Beam's Berish agrees, sayings his brands' market share and
volume are increasing in the United States, where the company is
using a ``back-to-basics'' advertising campaign to capitalize on
bourbon's history and tradition.
   In addition, ``We see a marvelous potential to sell and promote
what is the American spirit throughout the world,'' Berish said.
   Industry officials aren't sure how much bourbon is sold in
Japan, but Berish said Jim Beam's international sales are up 11
percent to 15 percent.
   ``The Japanese love American products,'' he said. ``They like
our food, they like our music, they like our clothes and they like
our bourbon.''

<HEAD>Eastern Cutting 600 Jobs, Salaries</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: ADDS final graf to UPDATE with Eastern getting extension on
deadline for reorganization plan; No pickup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines announced Thursday it will cut 600
jobs and temporarily trim salaries for about 10,000 workers as the
retrenching carrier prepares to sell its Latin American routes and
shrink its home base.
   The downsizing is part of Eastern's plan for reorganization in
the wake of the strike that idled the Miami-based carrier for
several months early this year.
   Eastern President Phil Bakes said the pay and benefit reductions
were ``something we wanted to avoid,'' but large losses are
expected to continue in the first half of the new year.
   The belt-tightening package is expected to save $100 million
next year for Eastern, which posted a net loss of $185.2 million in
this year's third quarter.
   The announcement reflects Eastern's intention to return to its
original reorganization plan cutting its pre-strike operations by a
third. In August, dogged by failure to sell the profitable Latin
American routes, Eastern had decided to pare operations by only 10
percent.
   Attrition and early retirement will blunt the effects of the
cutbacks, but a number of operational employees will be out of work
Jan. 31 as Miami operations are reduced from 75 daily flights to 50.
   Job cuts also will come July 1 when rival American Airlines
plans to take over the Latin American routes, Eastern Senior Vice
President Tom Matthews told a news conference in Miami.
   After months of negotiations, American said Dec. 19 it would buy
Eastern's Latin American routes and certain other assets from
Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp. for $471 million.
   Federal officials and the U.S. bankruptcy judge overseeing
Eastern's Chapter 11 reorganization must approve the deal.
   Separately Thursday, Pan Am Corp. said it intends to protest to
the government American's planned purchase of the Latin American
routes. Pan Am contends that the route transfer from ailing Eastern
to the nation's largest airline will hinder competition.
   Eastern said pilots, flight attendants and Machinists will not
be affected by the job cuts. The airline has hired thousands of
employees in those categories, mostly non-union, to replace members
of the striking unions.
   But half of Eastern's 20,000 employees _ including management,
pilots and flight attendants working at the higher pre-strike wage
levels _ will have their wages reduced by 10 percent to 20 percent
for a year, beginning Jan. 16.
   About 850 pilots will see their $72,000-a-year salaries slashed
by 20 percent for six months. Half of the cut will be restored
after six months, and pay will return to normal after a year. About
950 newly hired pilots are working for $27,500 a year and will not
be affected.
   Flight attendants earning a pre-strike salary of $30,000 a year
also will take cuts, but those hired under the new wage levels of
$15,000 will not.
   The wage cuts are subject to union negotiations, Matthews said.
Officials of the Air Line Pilots Association were not immediately
available for comment on Eastern's action. Mary Jane Barry, head of
the Eastern flight attendants union, said she couldn't comment
since contract negotiations are ongoing.
   The pilots and flight attendants unions, which walked out in
sympathy with the Machinists' strike, called off their actions just
before Thanksgiving but few got their jobs back.
   Matthews said he expects the latest round of cuts to be the last
necessary to achieve the reorganization plan.
   Eastern employed about 32,000 before the strike began March 4.
The airline filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from
creditors five days later.
   Eastern plans to reshape itself at about two-thirds of its
pre-strike size with its major hub in Atlanta. Matthews denied
speculation that Eastern plans eventually to move its headquarters
from Miami to that city.
   Rising fuel prices and the prospect of only modest growth in air
travel in 1990 also were factors in the decision to cut jobs, the
airline said.
   Also Thursday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland extended
until Feb. 12 Friday's deadline for Eastern to submit its revised
reorganization plan. The judge already has given the airline
several such extensions.

<TEXT>
   American Express Bank Ltd., the international
banking arm of financial giant American Express Co., said Thursday
it agreed to sell its Geneva subsidiary to a Swiss firm for $1
billion in cash.
   The sale of TDB American Express Bank to privately held
Compagnie de Banque et d'Investissements will allow American
Express to focus on more established businesses overseas, said G.
Richard Thoman, president of American Express International Corp.
   ``Our goal is to concentrate on global businesses where we are
already market leaders _ card products, travelers checks, travel
services and financial services ... and to seek partnerships that
complement our businesses,'' Thoman said.
   American Express International was formed in July to help
American Express expand globally.
   Under terms of the agreement, TDB will be combined with CBI's
operation and a new bank called TCB-CBI will be formed. CBI will
own 80 percent of the new operation and American Express will hold
a 20 percent equity stake.
   American Express would not disclose how much it paid for that
minority stake.
   The new company will be headed by Edgar de Picciotto, managing
director and principal shareholder of CBI.
   The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval.
   American Express Bank has assets totaling $16 billion, including
$14.5 billion from client funds. The bank does not break down
assets of individual units.

<HEAD>Investment Firm To Buy Color Tile For $450 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York investment firm said
Thursday it had agreed to pay $450 million to purchase Color Tile
Inc., a Fort Worth-based national floor covering retailer.
   Investcorp, which has purchased such firms as Tiffany &amp; Co.,
Gucci and the Carvel Ice Cream company in recent years, said it
would buy Color Tile from Knoll International Holdings Inc.
   Investcorp said current Color Tile management participated in
the deal.
   Color Tile operates 700 U.S. stores and said it expects 1989
revenues of more than $460 million.
   Knoll International is a private, New York-based company whose
holdings include the office-furniture maker Knoll and New York's
``21'' Club. It put Color Tile up for sale in June. It had acquired
the chain in 1986 for an undisclosed price.

<HEAD>Dollar Surges, Share Prices Rise Slightly</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Nikkei close for day and dollar
morning close.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose
slightly Friday in the last session of 1989 trading, while the U.S.
dollar surged against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose 38.93
points, or 0.10 percent, finishing the year at 38,915.87. The Tokyo
exchange's key barometer began the year at 30,243.66, increasing
8,672.21 points during 1989.
   The stock exchange closed for the day at the end of the morning
session for the New Year's holiday, which runs from Saturday
through Wednesday, Jan. 3.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar opened at 143.45 yen,
up 1.30 yen from its close here Thursday of 142.15 yen, and moved
from 143.35 to 143.60 yen during morning trading. It finished the
morning session at 143.30 yen, up 1.15 from the previous day's
close here.
   Dealers attributed the higher stock market start to dollar
selling on a news report that Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic
Party might lose an election for the powerful lower house of
Parliament early next year.
   But Shinzo Yamamoto, a dealer with Daiwa Bank, said the rise was
caused more by year-end position adjustments.
   With dollar-based account settlements becoming due, ``some
dealers found themselves short on collection and bought dollars,''
he said.
   On the stock exchange, a dealer with Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru
Securities Co. said transactions of trading firm issues dominated
the selling.
   ``This shows that the new year will open with trading firm
issues at the center of trading,'' he said, speaking anonymously.
   ``That the year ended with four consecutive days of increases
shows the great expectations dealers have for next year,'' the
trader added.
   He said that although the tremendous rise in the Nikkei showed
the health of the Tokyo markets, dealers were dissatisfied by the
pattern of this year's growth.
   ``Performance has not improved in proportion to the increase in
the Nikkei average,'' he said.
